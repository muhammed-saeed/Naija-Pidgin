SEC. 701. NEIGHBORHOOD 
COMMERCIAL DISTRICT PROVISIONS. 

This Article is adopted specifically for Neigh- 
borhood Commercial Districts, as shown on the 
Zoning Map of the City and County of San 
Francisco. The provisions set forth or referenced 
in Article 7 shall apply to any use, property, 
structure, or development which is located in a 
Neighborhood Commercial District, unless oth- 
erwise provided for within this Code. In the 
event of conflict between provisions of Article 7 
and other provisions of this Code, the provisions 
of Article 7 shall prevail. (Added by Ord. 69-87, 
App. 3/13/87) 

SEC. 701.1. PURPOSE OF ARTICLE 7. 

This Article is intended to provide a compre- 
hensive and flexible zoning system for Neighbor- 
hood Commercial Districts which is consistent 
with the objectives and policies set forth in the 
San Francisco Master Plan. More specifically, 
the purposes of this Article are: 

(a) To provide in one article a complete 
listing of or cross-reference to all of the zoning 
categories, definitions, control provisions, and 
review procedures which are applicable to prop- 
erties or uses in Neighborhood Commercial Dis- 
tricts. 



(b) To establish a zoning system which will 
accommodate all classes of Neighborhood Com- 
mercial Districts including general districts for 
citywide area groupings and individual districts 
which are tailored to the unique characteristics 
of specific areas. 

(c) To provide zoning control categories which 
embrace the full range of land use issues in all 
Neighborhood Commercial Districts, in order that 
controls can be applied individually to each dis- 
trict class to address particular land use con- 
cerns in that district. (Added by Ord. 69-87, App. 
3/13/87) 

SEC. 701.2. REPORT TO THE BOARD OF 
SUPERVISORS. 

The Director of City Planning shall prepare a 
report to the Board of Supervisors on the Neigh- 
borhood Commercial Zoning controls enacted by 
Ordinance No. 69-87 and Ordinance No. 445-87 
within twenty-four months from the eifective 
date of Ordinance No. 445-87, and every twenty- 
four months thereafter. The City Planning Com- 
mission shall hold a public hearing on the Neigh- 
borhood Commercial Zoning controls to solicit 
public input on a comprehensive review of said 
controls prior to forwarding the report, and any 
recommended amendments, to the Board of Su- 
pervisors. (Added by Ord. 445-87, App. 1112/87) 

SEC. 702. CLASSES OF 
NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL, 
DISTRICTS. 

The following classes of districts are estab- 
lished for Neighborhood Commercial Districts. 
(Added by Ord. 69-87, App. 3/13/87) 

SEC. 702.1. NEIGHBORHOOD 
COMMERCIAL USE DISTRICTS. 

(a) The following districts are established 
for the purpose of implementing the Commerce

NCT Districts are transit-oriented moderate- 
to high-density mixed-use neighborhoods of vary- 
ing scale concentrated near transit services. The 



NCT Districts are mixed use districts that sup- 
port neighborhood-serving commercial uses on 
lower floors and housing above. These districts

Sec. 702.1.

are well-served by public transit and aim to 
maximize residential and commercial opportuni- 
ties on or near major transit services. The district&apos;s 
form can be either linear along transit-priority 
corridors, concentric around transit stations, or 
broader areas where transit services criss-cross 
the neighborhood. Housing density is limited not 
by lot area, but by the regulations on the built 
envelope of buildings, including height, bulk, 
setbacks, and lot coverage, and standards for 
residential uses, including open space and expo- 
sure, and urban design guidelines. Residential 
parking is not required and generally limited. 
Commercial establishments are discouraged or 
prohibited from building accessory off-street park- 
ing in order to preserve the pedestrian-oriented 
character of the district and prevent attracting 
auto traffic. There are prohibitions on access (i.e. 
driveways, garage entries) to off-street parking 
and loading on critical streetches of commercial 
and transit streets to preserve and enhance the 
pedestrian-oriented character and transit func- 
tion. (Added by Ord. 69-87, App. 3/13/87; amended 
by Ord. 262-00, File No. 001426, App. 11/17/ 
2000; Ord. 72-08, File No. 071157, App. 4/3/2008)

(b) Use Limitations. The uses permitted 
in Neighborhood Commercial Districts are either 
principal, conditional, accessory, or temporary 
uses as stated in this Section, and include those 
uses set forth or summarized and cross-refer- 
enced in the zoning control categories as listed in 
Paragraph (a) in Sections 710.1 through 729.95 
of this Code for each district class. 

(1) Permitted Uses. All permitted uses 
shall be conducted within an enclosed building in 
Neighborhood Commercial Districts, unless oth- 
erwise specifically allowed in this Code. Excep- 
tions from this requirement are: uses which, 
when located outside of a building, qualify as an 
outdoor activity area, as defined in Section 790.70 
of this Code; accessory off-street parking and 
loading and other uses listed below which func- 



tion primarily as open-air uses, or which may be 
appropriate if located on an open lot, outside a 
building, or within a partially enclosed building, 
subject to other limitations of this Article 7 and 
other sections of this Code.

If there are two or more uses in a structure 
and none is classified below under Section 
703.2(b)(1)(C) of this Code as accessory, then 
each of these uses will be considered separately 
as independent principal, conditional or tempo- 
rary uses. 

(A) Principal Uses. Principal uses are per- 
mitted as of right in a Neighborhood Commercial 
District, when so indicated in Sections 710.1 
through 729.95 of this Code for each district 
class. 

(B) Conditional Uses. Conditional uses are 
permitted in a Neighborhood Commercial Dis- 
trict when authorized by the Planning Commis- 
sion; whether a use is conditional in a given 
district is indicated in Sections 710.10 through 
729.95. Conditional uses are subject to the pro- 
visions set forth in Sections 178, 179, 303, and 
316 through 316.8 of this Code. 

(i) An establishment which sells beer or 
wine with motor vehicle fuel is a conditional use, 
and shall be governed by Section 229. 

(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of 
this Article, a change in use or demolition of a 
movie theater use, as set forth in Section 790.64, 
shall require conditional use authorization. This 
Subsection shall not authorize a change in use if 
the new use or uses are otherwise prohibited. 

(iii) Notwithstanding any other provision of 
this Article, a change in use or demolition of a 
general grocery store use, as defined in Section 
790.102(a), shall require conditional use autho- 



Supp. No. 12, November/December 2007 



Sec. 703.2.

rization. This Subsection shall not authorize a 
change in use if the new use or uses are other- 
wise prohibited. 

(C) Accessory Uses. Except as prohibited 
in Section 728 and subject to the limitations set 
forth below and in Sections 204.1 (Accessory 
Uses for Dwelling Units in R and NC Districts), 
204.4 (Dwelling Units Accessory to Other Uses), 
and 204.5 (Parking and Loading as Accessory 
Uses) of this Code, a related minor use which is 
either necessary to the operation or enjoyment of 
a lawful principal use or conditional use, or is 
appropriate, incidental and subordinate to any 
such use, shall be permitted as an accessory use 
when located on the same lot. Any use which 
does not qualify as an accessory use shall be 
classified as a principal or conditional use, un- 
less it qualifies as a temporary use under Sec- 
tions 205 through 205.2 of this Code. 

No use will be considered accessory to a 
permitted principal or conditional use which 
involves or requires any of the following: 

(i) The use of more than l k of the total floor 
area occupied by such use and the principal or 
conditional use to which it is accessory, except in 
the case of accessory off-street parking and load- 
ing; 

(ii) Any bar, restaurant, other entertain- 
ment, or any retail establishment which serves 
liquor for consumption on-site; 

(iii) Any take-out food use, as defined in 
Section 790.122, except for a take-out food use 
which occupies 100 square feet or less (including 
the area devoted to food preparation and service 
and excluding storage and waiting areas) in a 
general grocery or specialty grocery store; 

(iv) Any take-out food use, as defined in 
Section 790.122, except for a take-out food use 
operating as a minor and incidental use within a 
full-service restaurant; 

(v) The wholesaling, manufacturing or pro- 
cessing of foods, goods, or commodities on the 
premises of an establishment which does not 
also use or provide for primarily retail sale of 
such foods, goods or commodities at the same 
location where such wholesaling, manufacturing 
or processing takes place. 



The foregoing rules shall not prohibit take- 
out food activity which operates in conjunction 
with a fast-food restaurant or a self-service res- 
taurant. A fast-food restaurant or a self-service 
restaurant, by definition, includes take-out food 
as an accessory and necessary part of its opera- 
tion. 

(D) Temporary Uses. Temporary uses are 
permitted uses, subject to the provisions set 
forth in Section 205 of this Code. 

(2) Not Permitted Uses. 

(A) Uses which are not specifically listed in 
this Article are not permitted unless they qualify 
as a nonconforming use pursuant to Sections 180 
through 186.1 of this Code or are determined by 
the Zoning Administrator to be permitted uses in 
accordance with Section 307(a) of this Cede. 

(B) No use, even though listed as a permit- 
ted use, shall be permitted in a Neighborhood 
Commercial District which, by reason of its na- 
ture or manner of operation, creates conditions 
that are hazardous, noxious, or offensive through 
the emission of odor, fumes, smoke, cinders, 
dust, gas, vibration, glare, refuse, water-carried 
waste, or excessive noise. 

(C) The establishment of a use that sells 
alcoholic beverages, other than beer and. wine, 
concurrent with motor vehicle fuel is prohibited, 
and shall be governed by Section 229. (Added by

SEC. 703.3. FORMULA RETAIL USES. 
(a) Findings. 

(1) San Francisco is a city of diverse and 
distinct neighborhoods identified in large p&gt;art by 
the character of their commercial areas. 

(2) San Francisco needs to protect its vi- 
brant small business sector and create a support- 
ive environment for new small business innova- 
tions. One of the eight Priority Policies of the 



Supp. No. 12, November/December 2007 



949 



Neighborhood Commercial Districts 



Sec. 703.3. 



City&apos;s General Plan resolves that &quot;existing neigh- 
borhood-serving retail uses be preserved and 
enhanced and future opportunities for resident 
employment in and ownership of such busi- 
nesses enhanced.&quot; 

(3) Retail uses are the land uses most criti- 
cal to the success of the City&apos;s commercial dis- 
tricts. 

(4) Formula retail businesses are increas- 
ing in number in San Francisco, as they are in 
cities and towns across the country. 

(5) Money earned by independent busi- 
nesses is more likely to circulate within the local 
neighborhood and City economy than the money 
earned by formula retail businesses which often 
have corporate offices and vendors located out- 
side of San Francisco. 

(6) Formula retail businesses can have a 
competitive advantage over independent opera- 
tors because they are typically better capitalized 
and can absorb larger startup costs, pay more for 
lease space, and commit to longer lease con- 
tracts. This can put pressure on existing busi- 
nesses and potentially price out new startup 
independent businesses. 

(7) San Francisco is one of a very few major 
urban centers in the State in which housing, 
shops, work places, schools, parks and civic fa- 
cilities intimately co-exist to create strong iden- 
tifiable neighborhoods. The neighborhood streets 
invite walking and bicycling and the City&apos;s mix 
of architecture contributes to a strong sense of 
neighborhood community within the larger City 
community. 

(8) Notwithstanding the marketability of a 
retailer&apos;s goods or services or the visual attrac- 
tiveness of the storefront, the standardized ar- 
chitecture, color schemes, decor and signage of 
many formula retail businesses can detract from 
the distinctive character of certain Neighbor- 
hood Commercial Districts. 

(9) The increase of formula retail busi- 
nesses in the City&apos;s neighborhood commercial 
areas, if not monitored and regulated, will ham- 
per the City&apos;s goal of a diverse retail base with 
distinct neighborhood retailing personalities com- 
prised of a mix of businesses. Specifically, the 



unregulated and unmonitored establishment of 
additional formula retail uses may unduly limit 
or eliminate business establishment opportuni- 
ties for smaller or medium-sized businesses, many 
of which tend to be non-traditional or unique, 
and unduly skew the mix of businesses towards 
national retailers in lieu of local or regional 
retailers, thereby decreasing the diversity of 
merchandise available to residents and visitors 
and the diversity of purveyors of merchandise. 

(10) If, in the future, neighborhoods deter- 
mine that the needs of their Neighborhood Com- 
mercial Districts are better served by eliminat- 
ing the notice requirements for proposed formula 
retail uses, by converting formula retail uses 
into conditional uses in their district, or by 
prohibiting formula retail uses in their district, 
they can propose legislation to do so. 

(b) Formula Retail Use. Formula retail 
use is hereby defined as a type of retail sales 
activity or retail sales establishment which, along 
with eleven or more other retail sales establish- 
ments located in the United States, maintains 
two or more of the following features: a standard- 
ized array of merchandise, a standardized fa- 
cade, a standardized decor and color scheme, a 
uniform apparel, standardized signage, a trade- 
mark or a servicemark. 

(1) Standardized array of merchandise shall 
be defined as 50% or more of in-stock merchan- 
dise from a single distributor bearing uniform 
markings. 

(2) Trademark shall be defined as a word, 
phrase, symbol or design, or a combination of 
words, phrases, symbols or designs that identi- 
fies and distinguishes the source of the goods 
from one party from those of others. 

(3) Servicemark shall be defined as word, 
phrase, symbol or design, or a combination of 
words, phrases, symbols or designs that identi- 
fies and distinguishes the source of a service 
from one party from those of others. 

(4) Decor shall be defined as the style of 
interior finishings, which may include but is not 
limited to, style of furniture, wallcoverings or 
permanent fixtures. 



Supp. No. 12, November/December 2007

(5) Color Scheme shall be defined as selec- 
tion of colors used throughout, such as on the 
furnishings, permanent fixtures, and wallcover- 
ings, or as used on the facade. 

(6) Facade shall be defined as the face or 
front of a building, including awnings, looking 
onto a street or an open space. 

(7) Uniform Apparel shall be defined as 
standardized items of clothing including but not 
limited to standardized aprons, pants, shirts, 
smocks or dresses, hat, and pins (other than 
name tags) as well as standardized colors of 
clothing. 

(8) Signage shall be defined as business 
sign pursuant to Section 602.3 of the Planning 
Code. 

(c) &quot;Retail sales activity or retail sales es- 
tablishment&quot; shall include the following uses, as

facility,&quot; &quot;eating and drinking use,&quot; &quot;liquor store,&quot; 
&quot;restaurant, large fast-food,&quot; &quot;restaurant, small 
self-service,&quot; &quot;restaurant, full-service,&quot; &quot;sales and 
service, other retail,&quot; &quot;sales and service, retail,&quot; 
&quot;movie theatre,&quot; &quot;video store,&quot; &quot;amusement and 
game arcade,&quot; and &quot;take-out food.&quot; 

(d) Formula Retail Uses Permitted. Any 

use permitted in a Neighborhood Commercial 
District, which is all a &quot;formula retail use&quot; as 
defined in this Section, is hereby permitted. 

(e) Formula Retail Use Prohibited. Not- 
withstanding subsection (d), any use permitted 
in the Hayes-Gough Neighborhood Commercial 
District, or the North Beach Neighborhood Com- 
mercial District, which is also a &quot;formula retail 
use&quot; as defined in this Section, is hereby prohib- 
ited. 

(f) Conditional Uses. Notwithstanding sub- 
sections (d) or (e), any use permitted in the 
Haight Street Neighborhood Commercial Dis- 
trict, the Japantown Special Use District as 
defined in Section 249.31, or in the Small-Scale 
Neighborhood Commercial District along Divisa-

yan Streets (Block 1276, Lot 21), which is also a 
&quot;formula retail use&quot; as defined in this Section, is 
hereby permitted only as a conditional use. Ad- 
ditional criteria to be used by the Planning 
Commission when considering granting condi- 
tional use permits to formula retail uses in these 
districts are listed in Section 303(i). 

(g) Neighborhood Commercial Notifica- 
tion and Design Review. After the effective 
date of this Ordinance, any building permit 
application for a use permitted in a Neighbor- 
hood Commercial District which is also a &quot;for- 
mula retail use&quot; as defined in this section shall 
be subject to the Neighborhood Commercial No- 
tification and Design Review Procedures of Sec- 
tion 312 of this Code. 

(h) Discretionary Review Guidelines. 

The Planning Commission shall develop and 
adopt guidelines which it shall employ when 
considering any request for discretionary review 
made pursuant to this Section. These guidelines 
shall include but are not limited to consideration 
of the following factors: 

(1) Existing concentrations of formula re- 
tail uses within the Neighborhood Commercial 
District. 

(2) Availability of other similar retail uses 
within the Neighborhood Commercial District. 



Supp. No. 12, November/December 2007 



951 



Neighborhood Commercial Districts 



Sec. 709. 



(3) Compatibility of the proposed formula 
retail use with the existing architectural and 
aesthetic character of the Neighborhood Com- 
mercial District. 

(4) Existing retail vacancy rates within the 
Neighborhood Commercial District. 

(5) Existing mix of Citywide-serving retail 
uses and neighborhood-serving retail uses within 
the Neighborhood Commercial District. 

(i ) Determination of Formula Retail Use. 
After the effective date of this Ordinance, in 
those areas in which &quot;formula retail uses&quot; are 
prohibited, any building permit application de- 
termined by the City to be for a &quot;formula retail 
use&quot; that does not identify the use as a &quot;formula 
retail use&quot; is incomplete and cannot be processed 
until the omission is corrected. Any building 
permit approved after the effective date of this 
Ordinance that is determined by the City to have 
been, at the time of application, for a &quot;formula 
retail use&quot; that did not identify the use as a 
&quot;formula retail use&quot; is subject to revocation at 
any time. 

After the effective date of this Ordinance, in 
those areas in which &quot;formula retail uses&quot; are 
subject to the Neighborhood Commercial Notifi- 
cation and Design Review provisions of subsec- 
tion (e), any building permit application deter- 
mined by the City to be for a &quot;formula retail use&quot; 
that does not identify the use as a &quot;formula retail 
use&quot; is incomplete and cannot be processed until 
the omission is corrected. After the effective date 
of this Ordinance, any building permit approved 
that is determined by the City to be for a &quot;for- 
mula retail use&quot; that does not identify the use as 
a &quot;formula retail use&quot; must complete the Neigh- 
borhood Commercial Notification and Design Re- 
view required in subsection (e). 

If the City determines that a building permit 
application or building permit subject to this 
Section of the Code is for a &quot;formula retail use,&quot; 
the building permit applicant or holder bears the 
burden of proving to the City that the proposed 
or existing use is not a &quot;formula retail use.&quot;

SEC. 703.4. CONDITIONAL USE 
AUTHORIZATION FOR FORMULA 
RETAIL USES. 

(a) This Ordinance shall be known as the 
Small Business Protection Act. 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 703.3(d) and 
except for Section 703.3(e), establishment of a 
formula retail use, as defined in Section 703.3, in 
any Neighborhood Commercial District, as iden- 
tified in Article 7, shall require conditional use 
authorization pursuant to the criteria of Sections 
303(c) and 303(i) and be subject to the terms of 
Sections 703.3(g) and (i). 

(c) Nothing herein shall preclude the Board 
of Supervisors from adopting more restrictive 
provisions for conditional use authorization of 
formula retail use or prohibiting formula retail 
use in any Neighborhood Commercial District. 
(Added by Proposition G, § 2, 11/7/2007) 

SEC. 709. GUIDE TO UNDERSTANDING 
THE NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL 
DISTRICT ZONING CONTROLS. 

Neighborhood Commercial District controls 
are set forth in the Zoning Control Tables in 
Sections 710.10 through 729.95, or referenced in 
Section 799 of this Code. 

(a) The first column in the Zoning Control 
Table, titled &quot;No.&quot; provides a category number 
for each zoning control category. 

(b) The second column in the table, titled 
&quot;Zoning Control Category,&quot; lists each zoning con- 
trol category which is regulated in Article 7 of 
this Code. 

(c) The third column, titled &quot;§ References,&quot; 
contains numbers of other sections in the Plan- 
ning Code and other City Codes, in which addi- 
tional control provisions, including exceptions 
and definitions, where pertinent, are contained. 

(d) In the fourth column, the controls appli- 
cable to the various Neighborhood Commercial 
Districts are indicated either directly or by ref- 
erence to other Code Sections which contain the 
controls. 

The following symbols are used in this table: 

P — Permitted as a principal use. 



Supp. No. 12, November/December 2007 



Sec. 709. 



San Francisco - Planning Code 



952 



C — Permitted as a conditional use, sub- 
ject to the provisions set forth in Sec- 
tions 178, 179, and 316 through 316.8 
of this Code. 
— A blank space on the table or the 
symbol &quot;NP&quot; indicate that the use or 
feature is not permitted. Unless a use 
or feature is permitted or required as 
set forth in the Zoning Control Tables 
or in those sections referenced in Sec- 
tion 799 of this Code, such use or 
feature is prohibited, unless deter- 
mined by the Zoning Administrator to 
be a permitted use pursuant to Sec- 
tion 307(a) of this Code. 
# — See specific provisions listed by sec- 
tion and zoning category number at 
the end of the table. 
1st — 1st story and below 
2nd — 2nd story 
3rd+ — 3rd story and above 
(e) At the end of each table, footnotes to 
zoning control categories marked with the sym- 
bol &quot;#&quot; provide additional controls and/or refer- 



ences for additional controls applicable to certain 
portions of districts as identified and/or refer- 
enced therein. 

(f) All uses, buildings and features in NC 
Districts shall comply with all controls set forth 
for the district in which they are located. Where 
different controls conflict or overlap within the 
same NC District, the use, building or feature 
shall abide by the most restrictive of all controls. 
For example, in an NC-2 District, a residential 
unit on the second story is proposed for conver- 
sion into a business service. Residential conver- 
sions at the second story in an NC-2 District 
require conditional use authorization under Sec- 
tion 711.38, while business services at the second 
story in an NC-2 District are permitted as prin- 
cipal uses under Section 711.53. Following the 
most restrictive control, the applicant must ob- 
tain conditional use authorization and all other 
necessary permits in order to legally convert the 
residential unit to a business service. (Added by 
Ord. 69-87, App. 3/13/87) 



SEC. 710.1. NC-1 — NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL CLUSTER DISTRICT. 

NC-1 Districts are intended to serve as local neighborhood shopping districts, providing conve- 
nience retail goods and services for the immediately surrounding neighborhoods primarily during 
daytime hours. 

These NC-1 Districts are characterized by their location in residential neighborhoods, often in 
outlying areas of the City. The commercial intensity of these districts varies. Many of these districts 
have the lowest intensity of commercial development in the City, generally consisting of small clusters 
with three or more commercial establishments, commonly grouped around a corner; and in some cases 
short linear commercial strips with low-scale, interspersed mixed-use (residential-commercial) devel- 
opment. 

Building controls for the NC-1 District promote low-intensity development which is compatible 
with the existing scale and character of these neighborhood areas. Commercial development is limited 
to one story. Rear yard requirements at all levels preserve existing backyard space. 

NC-1 commercial use provisions encourage the full range of neighborhood-serving convenience 
retail sales and services at the first story provided that the use size generally is limited to 3,000 square 
feet. However, commercial uses and features which could impact residential livability are prohibited, 
such as auto uses, financial services, general advertising signs, drive-up facilities, hotels, and 
late-night activity; eating and drinking establishments are restricted, depending upon the intensity of 
such uses in nearby commercial districts. 

Housing development in new buildings is encouraged above the ground story in most districts. 
Existing residential units are protected by prohibitions of conversions above the ground story and 
limitations on demolitions.

SEC. 711.1. NC-2 — SMALL-SCALE NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL DISTRICT. 

The NC-2 District is intended to serve as the City&apos;s Small-Scale Neighborhood Commercial District. 
These districts are linear shopping streets which provide convenience goods and services to the 
surrounding neighborhoods as well as limited comparison shopping goods for a wider market. The 
range of comparison goods and services offered is varied and often includes specialty retail stores, 
restaurants, and neighborhood-serving offices. NC-2 Districts are commonly located along both 
collector and arterial streets which have transit routes. 

These districts range in size from two or three blocks to many blocks, although the commercial 
development in longer districts may be interspersed with housing or other land uses. Buildings 
typically range in height from two to four stories with occasional one-story commercial buildings. 

The small-scale district controls provide for mixed-use buildings which approximate or slightly 
exceed the standard development pattern. Rear yard requirements above the ground story and at 
residential levels preserve open space corridors of interior blocks. 

Most new commercial development is permitted at the ground and second stories. Neighborhood- 
serving businesses are strongly encouraged. Eating and drinking and entertainment uses, however, 
are confined to the ground story. The second story may be used by some retail stores, personal services, 
and medical, business and professional offices. Parking and hotels are monitored at all stories. Limits 
on late-night activity, drive-up facilities, and other automobile uses protect the livability within and 
around the district, and promote continuous retail frontage. 

Housing development in new buildings is encouraged above the ground story. Existing residential 
units are protected by limitations on demolition and upper-story conversions.

SEC. 712.1. NC-3 — MODERATE-SCALE NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL DISTRICT. 

NC-3 Districts are intended in most cases to offer a wide variety of comparison and specialty goods 
and services to a population greater than the immediate neighborhood, additionally providing 
convenience goods and services to the surrounding neighborhoods. NC-3 Districts are linear districts 
located along heavily trafficked thoroughfares which also serve as major transit routes. 

NC-3 Districts include some of the longest linear commercial streets in the City, some of which have 
continuous retail development for many blocks. Large-scale lots and buildings and wide streets 
distinguish the districts from smaller-scaled commercial streets, although the districts may include 
small as well as moderately scaled lots. Buildings typically range in height from two to four stories 
with occasional taller structures. 

NC-3 building standards permit moderately large commercial uses and buildings. Rear yards are 
protected at residential levels. 

A diversified commercial environment is encouraged for the NC-3 District, and a wide variety of 
uses are permitted with special emphasis on neighborhood-serving businesses. Eating and drinking, 
entertainment, financial service and certain auto uses generally are permitted with certain limitations 
at the first and second stories. Other retail businesses, personal services and offices are permitted at 
all stories of new buildings. Limited storage and administrative service activities are permitted with 
some restrictions. 

Housing development in new buildings is encouraged above the second story. Existing residential 
units are protected by limitations on demolitions and upper-story conversions.

SEC. 713.1. NC-S — NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL SHOPPING CENTER DISTRICT. 

NC-S Districts are intended to serve as small shopping centers or supermarket sites which provide 
retail goods and services for primarily car-oriented shoppers. They commonly contain at least one 
anchor store or supermarket, and some districts also have small medical office buildings. The range of 
services offered at their retail outlets usually is intended to serve the immediate and nearby 
neighborhoods. These districts encompass some of the most recent (post-1945) retail development in 
San Francisco&apos;s neighborhoods and serve as an alternative to the linear shopping street. 

Shopping centers and supermarket sites contain mostly one-story buildings which are removed 
from the street edge and set in a parking lot. Outdoor pedestrian activity consists primarily of trips 
between the parking lot and the stores on-site. Ground and second stories are devoted to retail sales 
and some personal services and offices. 

The NC-S standards and use provisions allow for medium-size commercial uses in low-scale 
buildings. Rear yards are not required for new development. Most neighborhood-serving retail 
businesses are permitted at the first and second stories, but limitations apply to fast-food restaurants 
and take-out food uses. Some auto uses are permitted at the first story. Limited storage and 
administrative service activities are permitted with some restrictions. 

Housing development in new buildings is permitted. Existing residential units are protected by 
limitations on demolitions and prohibitions of upper-story conversions.

SEC. 714.1. BROADWAY NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL DISTRICT. 

The Broadway Neighborhood Commercial District, located in the northeast quadrant of San 
Francisco, extends along Broadway from west of Columbus Avenue to Osgood Place. It is part of a 
larger commercial area which includes North Beach to the north, Chinatown to the south and west, 
and Jackson Square to the southeast. Broadway&apos;s fame and popularity as a Citywide and regional 
entertainment district is derived from a concentration of nightclubs, music halls, adult theaters, bars, 



Supp. No. 12, November/December 2007 



Sec. 714.1. 



San Francisco - Planning Code 



976 



and restaurants between Grant Avenue and Montgomery Street. These places attract locals and 
visitors alike, mainly in the evening and late-night hours. In addition to the entertainment and some 
retail businesses, Broadway contains many upper-story residential hotels. Due to its proximity to 
downtown, there is strong pressure to develop upper-story offices. 

The Broadway District controls are designed to encourage development that is compatible w ith the 
existing moderate building scale and mixed-use character, and maintain the district&apos;s balance of 
entertainment uses, restaurants, and small-scale retail stores. New buildings exceeding 40 feet in 
height will be carefully reviewed and rear yards at residential levels are protected. Most commercial 
uses in new buildings are permitted at the first two stories. Neighborhood-serving businesses are 
strongly encouraged. In order to protect the livability of the area, limitations apply to new fast-food 
restaurants and adult entertainment uses at the first and second stories, as well as late-night activity. 
Financial services are allowed on the ground story subject to certain limitations. Nonretail offices are 
prohibited in order to prevent encroachment of the adjoining downtown office uses. Due to the high 
traffic volume on Broadway, most automobile and drive-up uses are prohibited in order to prevent 
further traffic congestion. Parking garages are permitted if their ingress and egress do not disrupt the 
traffic flow on Broadway. 

Housing development in new buildings is encouraged above the second story. Existing housing is 
protected by limitations on demolitions and upper-story conversions.

SEC. 715.1. CASTRO STREET NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL DISTRICT. 

The Castro Street District is situated in Eureka Valley, close to the geographic center of San 
Francisco between the Mission District, Twin Peaks, and Upper Market Street. The physical form of 
the district is a crossing at Castro and 18th Streets, the arms of which contain many small, but 
intensely active commercial businesses. The multi-purpose commercial district provides both conve- 
nience goods to its immediate neighborhood as well as comparison shopping goods and services on a 
specialized basis to a wider trade area. Commercial businesses are active both in the daytime and late 
into the evening and include a number of gay-oriented bars and restaurants, as well as several 
specialty clothing and gift stores. The district also supports a number of offices in converted residential 
buildings. 

The Castro Street District controls are designed to maintain existing small-scale development and 
promote a balanced mix of uses. Building standards permit small-scale buildings and uses and protect 
rear yards above the ground story and at residential levels. In new buildings, most commercial uses 
are permitted at the ground and second stories. Special controls are necessary to preserve the existing 
equilibrium of neighborhood-serving convenience and specialty commercial uses. In order to maintain 
convenience stores and protect adjacent residential livability, controls prohibit additional eating and 
drinking establishments and permit with certain limitations new late-night uses, adult and other 
entertainment, and financial service uses. The continuous retail frontage is maintained by prohibiting 
most automobile and drive-up uses. 

Housing development in new buildings is encouraged above the second story. Existing housing 
units are protected by limitations on demolitions and upper-story conversions.

(2) The large fast food restaurant will be located in a. building 
jointly occupied by a nonprofit community group providing 
medical, cultural, social, or other community services to 
the Castro Street NCD; 

(3) The fast food restaurant will contribute substantially to

ability to locate and operate in that building by paying the 
nonprofit&apos;s rent and maintenance costs for the building for 
at least seven years and by making a one-time cash contri- 
bution of $120,000 to an AIDS-related community group; 

(4) That portion of the building occupied by the community 
use shall be at least twice the floor area occupied by the 
large fast food restaurant; and

SEC. 716.1. INNER CLEMENT STREET NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL DISTRICT. 

The Inner Clement Street Commercial District is located on Clement Street between Arguello 
Boulevard and Funston Avenue in the eastern portion of the Richmond District of northwest San 
Francisco. The district provides a wide selection of convenience goods and services for the residents of 
the Inner Richmond neighborhood. Inner Clement Street has one of the greatest concentrations of 
restaurants of any commercial street in San Francisco, drawing customers from throughout the City 
and region. There are also a significant number of professional, realty, and business offices as well as 
financial institutions. The pleasant pedestrian character of the district is derived directly from the 
intensely active retail frontage on Clement Street. 

The Inner Clement Street District controls are designed to promote development that is consistent 
with its existing land use patterns and to maintain a harmony of uses that supports the district&apos;s 
vitality. The building standards allow small-scale buildings and uses, protecting rear yards above the 
ground story and at residential levels. In new development, most commercial uses are permitted at the 
first two stories, although certain limitations apply to uses at the second story. Special controls are 
necessary to preserve the equilibrium of neighborhood-serving convenience and comparison shopping 
businesses and protect adjacent residential livability. These controls prohibit additional financial 
service and limit additional eating and drinking establishments, late-night commercial uses and 
ground-story entertainment uses. In order to maintain the street&apos;s active retail frontage, controls also 
prohibit most new automobile and drive-up uses. 

Housing development is encouraged in new buildings above the ground story. Existing residential 
units are protected by prohibitions on upper-story conversions and limitations on demolitions.

INNER CLEMENT STREET LIQUOR LICENSES FOR FULL- 
SERVICE RESTAURANTS Boundaries: Applicable to the Inner Clem- 
ent Street Neighborhood Commercial District Controls: (a) In order to 
allow certain restaurants to seek an ABC license type 47 so that liquor 
may be served for drinking on the premises, a bar use, as defined in 
§ 790.22, may be permitted as a conditional use on the ground level if, 
in addition to the criteria set forth in Section 303, the Planning 
Commission finds that: 

(1) The bar function is operated as an integral element of an establish- 
ment which is classified both as: (A) a full-service restaurant as defined 
in §790.92 and (B) a bona-fide restaurant as defined in §781. 8(c); and 

(2) The establishment maintains only an ABC license type 47. Other 
ABC license types, except those that are included within the definition 
of a full-service restaurant pursuant to §790.22, are not permitted for 
those uses subject to this Section. 

(b) Subsequent to the granting of a conditional use authorization under

SEC. 717.1. OUTER CLEMENT STREET NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL DISTRICT. 

The Outer Clement Street Neighborhood Commercial District is located on Clement Street between 
19th Avenue and 27th Avenue in the western portion of the Richmond District. The shopping area 
contains small-scale convenience businesses, as well as many restaurants and a movie theater. The 
district&apos;s restaurants serve a neighborhood and Citywide clientele during the evening hours, while 
convenience shopping uses cater for the most part to daytime neighborhood shoppers. Outer Clement 
Street contains many mixed-use buildings with some fully commercial and fully residential buildings 
interspersed between them. 

The Outer Clement Street District controls are designed to promote development that is in keeping 
with the district&apos;s existing small-scale, mixed-use character. The building standards monitor large- 
scale development and protect rear yards at all levels. Future commercial growth is directed to the 
ground story in order to promote more continuous and active retail frontage. Additional eating and 
drinking establishments are prohibited, while ground-story entertainment and financial service uses 
are monitored in order to limit the problems of traffic, congestion, noise and late-night activity 
associated with such uses and to protect existing neighborhood-serving businesses. Other controls 
restricting late-night activity, hotels, automobile uses, and drive-up facilities are designed to preserve 
the low-intensity character of the district. 

Housing development in new buildings is encouraged above the ground story. Existing residential 
units are protected by prohibitions of upper-story conversions and limitations on demolitions.

SEC. 718.1. UPPER FILLMORE STREET NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL DISTRICT. 

The Upper Fillmore Street Neighborhood Commercial District is situated in the south-central 
portion of Pacific Heights. It runs north-south along Fillmore Street from Jackson to Bush and extends 
west one block along California and Pine Streets. This medium-scaled, multi-purpose commercial 
district provides convenience goods to its immediate neighborhood as well as comparison shopping 
goods and services on a specialized basis to a wider trade area. Commercial businesses are active 
during both day and evening and include a number of bars, restaurants, specialty groceries, and 
specialty clothing stores. 

The Upper Fillmore District controls are designed to protect the existing building scale and 
promote new mixed-use development which is in character with adjacent buildings. Building 
standards regulate large lot and use development and protect rear yards above the ground story and 
at residential levels. Most commercial uses are permitted at the first two stories of new buildings. 
Special controls are designed to preserve the existing equilibrium of neighborhood-serving convenience 
and specialty commercial uses. In order to maintain convenience stores and protect adjacent livability, 
additional eating and drinking establishments are prohibited and ground-story entertainment and 
financial service uses are limited. In order to promote continuous retail frontage, drive-up and most 
automobile uses are prohibited. 

Housing development in new buildings is encouraged above the second story. Existing residential 
units are protected by limitations on demolitions and upper-story conversions.

SEC. 719.1. HAIGHT STREET NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL DISTRICT. 

Northwest of the City&apos;s geographical center, the Haight Street Neighborhood Commercial District 
is located in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, extending along Haight Street between Stanyan and 
Central Avenue, including a portion of Stanyan Street between Haight and Beulah. The shopping area 
provides convenience goods and services to local Haight-Ashbury residents, as well as comparison 
shopping goods and services to a larger market area. The commercial district is also frequented by 
users of Golden Gate Park on weekends and by City residents for its eating, drinking, and 
entertainment places. Numerous housing units establish the district&apos;s mixed residential-commercial 
character. 

The Haight Street District controls are designed to protect the existing building scale and promote 
new mixed-use development which is in character with adjacent buildings. The building standards 
regulate large-lot and use development and protect rear yards above the ground story and at 
residential levels. To promote the prevailing mixed-use character, most commercial uses are directed 
primarily to the ground story with some upper-story restrictions in new buildings. In order to maintain 
the balanced mix and variety of neighborhood-serving commercial uses and regulate the more 
intensive commercial uses which can generate congestion and nuisance problems, special controls

Sec. 719.1. 



prohibit additional eating and drinking uses, restrict expansion and intensification of existing eating 
and drinking establishments, and limit entertainment and tourist hotels. Prohibitions of most 
automobile and drive-up uses protect the district&apos;s continuous retail frontage. 

Housing development in new buildings is encouraged above the ground story. Existing residential 
units are protected by prohibition of upper-story conversions and limitations on demolitions.

SEC. 720.1. HAYES-GOUGH NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL TRANSIT DISTRICT. 

The Hayes-Gough Neighborhood Commercial Transit District is located within walking distance of 
the Civic Center, lying west of Franklin Street and east of Laguna Street, with its southern edge 
generally at Lily Street, with an extension sough along both sides of Octavia Boulevard to Market 
Street. This mixed-use commercial district contains a limited range of retail commercial activity, which 
primarily caters to the immediate need of the neighborhood. The few comparison goods that it does 
provide attract clientele from a wider area outside its neighborhood, mostly the Performing Arts and 
Civic Center workers and visitors. There are a number of restaurants and art galleries, but other types 
of retail activity are limited. 

The Hayes-Gough District controls are designed to allow for growth and expansion that is 
compatible with the existing building and use scales. Building standards protect the moderate building 
and use size and require rear yards at residential levels. To maintain the mixed-use character of the 
district, most commercial uses are permitted at the first and second stories and housing is strongly 
encouraged at the third story and above. In order to encourage lively pedestrian-oriented commercial 



Supp. No. 16, April 2008 



Sec. 720.1. 



San Francisco - Planning Code 



1008 



activity, but restrict certain sensitive and problematic uses, eating and drinking, and entertainment 
uses are directed to the ground story. Retail sales activity, especially neighborhood-serving businesses, 
is further promoted by restricting new ground-story medical, business and professional offices. To 
protect continuous frontage, drive-up and most automobile uses are prohibited, above-ground p»arking 
is required to be setback or below ground, and active, pedestrian-oriented ground floor uses are 
required on Hayes Street and portions of Octavia Boulevard. 

Housing development in new buildings is encouraged above the second story, and is controlled not 
by lot area but by physical envelope controls. Existing residential units are protected by limitations on 
demolitions, mergers, subdivisions, and upper-story conversions. Given the area&apos;s central location and 
accessibility to the downtown and to the City&apos;s transit network, accessory parking for residential uses 
is not required. The code controls for this district are supported and augmented by design guidelines 
and policies in the Market and Octavia Area Plan of the General Plan. (Ord. 72-08, File No. 071157,

SEC. 721.1. UPPER MARKET STREET NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL DISTRICT. 

The Upper Market Street Neighborhood Commercial District, on Market Street from Church to 
Castro, and on side streets off Market, is situated at the border of the Eureka Valley, Buena Vista, and 
Duboce Triangle neighborhoods. Upper Market Street is a multi-purpose commercial district that 
provides limited convenience goods to adjacent neighborhoods, but also serves as a shopping street for 
a broader trade area. A large number of offices are located on Market Street within easy transit access 
to downtown. The width of Market Street and its use as a major arterial diminish the perception of the 
Upper Market Street District as a single commercial district. The street appears as a collection of 
dispersed centers of commercial activity, concentrated at the intersections of Market Street with 
secondary streets. 

The Upper Market Street district controls are designed to promote moderate-scale development 
which contributes to the definition of Market Street&apos;s design and character. They are also intended to 
preserve the existing mix of commercial uses and maintain the livability of the district and its 
surrounding residential areas. Large-lot and use development is reviewed for consistency with existing 
development patterns. Rear yards are protected at residential levels. To promote mixed-use buildings, 
most commercial uses are permitted with some limitations above the second story. In order to maintain 
continuous retail frontage and preserve a balanced mix of commercial uses, ground-story neighborhood- 
serving uses are encouraged, and eating and drinking, entertainment, and financial service uses are 
limited. Continuous frontage is promoted by prohibitions of most automobile and drive-up uses. 



Supp. No. 16, April 2008 



1012.3 Neighborhood Commercial Districts Sec. 721.1. 



Housing development in new buildings is encouraged above the second story. Existing upper-story 
residential units are protected by limitations on demolitions and upper-story conversions.

SEC. 722.1. NORTH BEACH NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL DISTRICT. 

The North Beach Neighborhood Commercial District is a nonlinear district centered on Columbus 
Avenue, located in the valley between Telegraph Hill and Nob Hill north of Broadway. North Beach 
functions as a neighborhood-serving marketplace, citywide specialty shopping, and dining district, and 
a tourist attraction, as well as an apartment and residential hotel zone. Traditionally, the district has 
provided most convenience goods and services for residents of North Beach and portions of Telegraph 
and Russian Hills. North Beach&apos;s eating, drinking, and entertainment establishments remain open 
into the evening to serve a much wider trade area and attract many tourists. The balance between 
neighborhood-serving convenience stores and Citywide specialty businesses has shifted gradually, as 
some convenience stores have been replaced by bakeries, ice cream parlors, and restaurants. The 
proliferation of financial services has also upset the district&apos;s balance of uses. The relocation of 
business and professional offices from downtown to North Beach threatens the loss of upper-story 
residential units. 

The North Beach District controls are designed to ensure the livability and attractiveness of North 
Beach. Building standards limit new development to a small to moderate scale. New buildings which 
exceed 40 feet in the 65-foot height district will be carefully reviewed, and rear yards are protected 
above the ground story and at residential levels. Most new commercial development is permitted at the 
first two stories. Small-scale, neighborhood-serving businesses are strongly encouraged. Special 



Supp. No. 12, November/December 2007 



Sec. 722.1. 



San Francisco - Planning Code 



1018 



controls limit additional ground-story eating and drinking, entertainment, and business and profes- 
sional office uses. Financial services are prohibited from locating in the portion of the district south of 
Union Street, while new financial services locating in the portion of the district north of Union Street 
are limited. Restrictions on automobile and drive-up uses are intended to promote continuous retail 
frontage and maintain residential livability. 

In keeping with the district&apos;s existing mixed-use character, housing development in new buildings 
is encouraged above the second story. Existing residential units are protected by prohibitions of 
upper-story conversions and limitations on demolitions.

SEC. 723.1. POLK STREET NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL DISTRICT. 

Sitting in the gulch between Nob and Russian Hills and Pacific Heights, the Polk Street 
Neighborhood Commercial District extends for a mile as a north-south linear strip, and includes a 
portion of Larkin Street between Post and California Streets. Polk Street&apos;s dense mixed-use character 
consists of buildings with residential units above ground-story commercial use. The district has an 
active and continuous commercial frontage along Polk Street for almost all of its length. Larkin Street 
and side streets in the district have a greater proportion of residences than Polk Street itself. The 
district provides convenience goods and services to the residential communities in the Polk Gulch 
neighborhood and to the residents on the west slopes of Nob and Russian Hills. It has many apparel 
and specialty stores, as well as some automobile uses, which serve a broader trade area. Commercial 
uses also include offices, as well as movie theaters, restaurants, and bars which keep the district active 
into the evening. 

The Polk Street District controls are designed to encourage and promote development which is 
compatible with the surrounding neighborhood. The building standards monitor large-scale develop- 
ment and protect rear yards at residential levels. Consistent with Polk Street&apos;s existing mixed-use 
character, new buildings may contain most commercial uses at the first two stories. The controls 
encourage neighborhood-serving businesses, but limit new eating, drinking, other entertainment, and 
financial service uses, which can produce parking congestion, noise and other nuisances or displace 



Supp. No. 12, November/December 2007 



Sec. 723.1. 



San Francisco - Planning Code 



1024 



other types of local-serving convenience goods and services. They also prohibit new adult entertain- 
ment uses. Restrictions on drive-up and most automobile uses protect the district&apos;s continuous retail 
frontage and prevent further traffic congestion. 

Housing developed in new buildings is encouraged above the second story, especially in the less 
intensely developed portions of the district along Larkin Street. Existing housing units are protected 
by limitations on demolitions and upper-story conversions.

SEC. 724.1. SACRAMENTO STREET NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL DISTRICT. 

Located in the Presidio Heights neighborhood in north-central San Francisco, the Sacramento 
Street Neighborhood Commercial District functions as a small-scale linear shopping area. It extends 
along Sacramento Street between Lyon and Spruce. Interspersed among residential buildings and 
garages, the district&apos;s daytime-oriented retail stores provide a limited array of convenience goods to the 
immediate neighborhood. Sacramento Street also has many elegant clothing, accessory, and antique 
stores and services, such as hair salons, which attract customers from a wider trade area. Its numerous 
medical and business offices draw clients from throughout the City. Evening activity in the district is 
limited to one movie theater, a few restaurants, and some stores near Presidio Avenue. 

The Sacramento Street District controls are designed to promote adequate growth opportunities for 
development that is compatible with the surrounding low-density residential neighborhood. The 
building standards monitor large-scale development and protect rear yards at the grade level and 
above. Most new commercial development is permitted at the first story; general retail uses are 



Supp. No. 12, November/December&apos; 2007 



1029 



Neighborhood Commercial Districts 



Sec. 724.1. 



permitted at the second story only if such use would not involve conversion of any existing housing 
units. Special controls are designed to protect existing neighborhood-serving ground-story retail uses. 
New medical service offices are prohibited at all stories. Personal and business services are restricted 
at the ground story and prohibited on upper stories. Limits on new ground-story eating and drinking 
uses, as well as new entertainment and financial service uses, are intended to minimize the 
environmental impacts generated by the growth of such uses. The daytime orientation of the district 
is encouraged by prohibiting bars and restricting late-night commercial activity. New hotels and 
parking facilities are limited in scale and operation to minimize disruption to the neighborhood. Most 
new automobile and drive-up uses are prohibited to promote continuous retail frontage. 

Housing development in new buildings is encouraged above the second story. Existing residential 
units are protected by limitations on demolitions and prohibitions of upper-story conversions.

SEC. 725.1. UNION STREET NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL DISTRICT. 

The Union Street Commercial District is located in northern San Francisco between the Marina 
and Pacific Heights neighborhoods. The district lies along Union Street between Van Ness Avenue and 
Steiner, including an arm extending north on Fillmore Street to Lombard. The shopping area provides 
limited convenience goods for the residents of sections of the Cow Hollow, Golden Gate Valley, and 
Pacific Heights neighborhoods immediately surrounding the street. Important aspects of Union 
Street&apos;s business activity are eating and drinking establishments and specialty shops whose clientele 
comes from a wide trade area. There are also a significant number of professional, realty, and business 
offices. Many restaurants and bars as well as the district&apos;s two movie theaters are open into the 
evening hours, and on weekends the street&apos;s clothing, antique stores and galleries do a vigorous 
business. 



Supp. No. 12, November/December 2007 



Sec. 725.1. 



San Francisco - Planning Code 



1034 



The Union Street District controls are designed to provide sufficient growth opportunities for 
commercial development that is in keeping with the existing scale and character, promote continuous 
retail frontage, and protect adjacent residential livability. Small-scale buildings and neighborhood- 
serving uses are promoted, and rear yards above the ground story and at all residential levels are 
protected. Most commercial development is permitted at the first two stories of new buildings, while 
retail service uses are monitored at the third story and above. Controls are necessary to presei&apos;ve the 
remaining convenience businesses and to reduce the cumulative impacts which the growth of certain 
uses have on neighborhood residents. Such controls prohibit additional eating and drinking establish- 
ments and limit entertainment and financial service uses. Most automobile and drive-up uses are 
prohibited in order to maintain continuous retail frontage and minimize further traffic congestion. 

Housing development in new buildings is encouraged above the second story. Existing residential 
units are protected by limitations on demolitions and upper-story conversions.

SEC. 728.1. 24TH STREET 
DISTRICT. 



NOE VALLEY NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL 



The 24th Street — Noe Valley Neighborhood Commercial District is situated along 24th Street 
between Chattanooga and Diamond in the Noe Valley neighborhood of central San Francisco. This 
daytime-oriented, multi-purpose commercial district provides a mixture of convenience and compari- 
son shopping goods and services to a predominantly local market area. It contains primarily retail 
sales and personal services at the street level, some office uses on the second story, and residential use 
almost exclusively on the third and upper stories. 

The 24th Street — Noe Valley District controls are designed to allow for development that is 
compatible with the existing small-scale, mixed-use neighborhood commercial character and surround- 
ing residential area. The small scale of new buildings and neighborhood-serving uses is encouraged 
and rear yard open space corridors at all levels are protected. Most commercial uses are directed to the 
ground story and limited at the second story of new buildings. In order to maintain the variety arid mix 
of retail sales and services along the commercial strip and to control the problems of traffic, congestion, 
noise and late-night activity, certain potentially troublesome commercial uses are regulated. Addi- 
tional eating and drinking establishments are prohibited, and ground-story entertainment and 
financial service uses are restricted to and at the ground story. Prohibitions on drive-up and most 
automobile uses help prevent additional traffic and parking congestion. 

Housing development in new buildings is encouraged above the ground story. Existing he using 
units are protected by prohibitions on upper-story conversions and limitations on demolitions.

ABC license type 47 so that liquor may be served for drinking 
on the premises, a bar use, as defined in § 790.22, may be per- 
mitted as a conditional use on the ground level if, in addition 
to the criteria set forth in Section 303, the Planning Commis- 
sion finds that: 

(1) The bar function is operated as an integral element of an 
establishment which is classified both as: (A) a full-service 
restaurant as defined in § 790.92 and (B) a bona-fide restau- 
rant as defined in § 781.8(c); and 

(2) The establishment maintains only an ABC license type 47. 
Other ABC license types, except those that are included 
within the definition of a full-service restaurant pursuant to 

§ 790.92, are not permitted for those uses subject to this Sec- 
tion. 

(b) Subsequent to the granting of a conditional use authoriza- 
tion under this Section, the Commission may consider imme- 
diate revocation of the previous conditional use authorization 
should an establishment no longer comply with any of the 
above criteria for any length of time.

Controls: (a) A full-service restaurant may be permitted as a 
conditional use on the ground level if, in addition to the crite- 
ria set forth in Section 303, the Planning Commission finds 
that: 

(1) The full-service restaurant does not occupy space thai: has 
been occupied by a basic neighborhood service since the effec- 
tive date of this Section. For the purposes of this Section, a 
&apos;basic neighborhood service&apos; shall be considered to include, but 
not necessarily be limited to, the following: hardware stores, 
shoe repair facilities, bookstores, and grocery stores that sell a 
wide variety of staple goods and collect less than 50% of gross 
receipts from the sale of alcoholic beverages; 

(2) Should the full-service restaurant seek the use of public 
sidewalk space through the Department of Public Works or 
another City agency, such use is conducted in a manner con- 
sistent with: (A) nearby commercial and residential uses and 
structures, and (B) the width of the sidewalk along the subject 
property and adjacent properties. New, expanded, or intensi- 
fied use of public sidewalk space for a full-service restaurant 
authorized under this Section shall require a new conditional 
use authorization pursuant to Section 303; 

(3) The Planning Commission has approved no more than a 
total of three (3) full-service restaurants in accordance with 
this Section. Should a full-service restaurant permitted under 
this Section cease operation and complete a lawful change of 
use to another principally or conditionally permitted use, the 
Commission may consider a new full-service restaurant in ac- 
cordance with the terms of this Section; and 

(4) No more than 60 months have elapsed from the effective 
date of this Section.

SEC. 729.1. WEST PORTAL AVENUE NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL DISTRICT. 

Located in the southwestern part of the City, the West Portal Avenue Neighborhood Commercial 
District stretches for three long blocks along West Portal Avenue from Ulloa Street to 15th Avenue and 
extends one block east along Ulloa Street from the Twin Peaks Tunnel entrance to Claremont 
Boulevard. West Portal Avenue provides a selection of goods and services for customers coming mainly 
from the surrounding west of Twin Peaks and Sunset single-family residential neighborhoods. The 
lively, small-scale retail frontage is interrupted at several locations by large-scale financial institutions 
which take up a large amount of commercial ground-story frontage. More than half of the number of 
medical, professional and business offices are located at the ground level. Except for one three-movie 
theater complex, West Portal offers no entertainment uses and its restaurants are mainly family- 
oriented. 

The West Portal Avenue District controls are designed to preserve the existing family-oriented, 
village character of West Portal Avenue. The building standards limit building heights to 26 feet and 
two stories and maintain the existing pattern of rear yards at the ground level and above. The height, 
bulk and design of new development, especially on large lots, should respect the small-scale character 
of the district and its surrounding residential neighborhoods. Lot mergers creating large lots are 
discouraged. Individual nonresidential uses require conditional use permits above 2,500 square feet 
and are restricted to 4,000 square feet as an absolute limit to conform with the existing small use sizes 
in the district. 

Special controls on commercial uses are designed to protect the existing mix of ground-story retail 
uses and prevent further intensification and congestion in the district. No new financial services are 
permitted. Because the district and surrounding neighborhoods are well served by the existing number 
of eating and drinking establishments, new bars, restaurants and take-out food generally are 
discouraged: any proposed new establishment should be carefully reviewed to ensure that it is 
neighborhood-serving and family-oriented, and will not involve high-volume take-out food or generate 
traffic, parking, or litter problems. Large fast-food restaurants and small self-service restaurants are 
prohibited. Medical, business or professional services are permitted at the first two stories, but 



Supp. No. 12, November/December 2007 



Sec. 729.1. 



San Francisco - Planning Code 



1056 



additional ground-story locations are to be closely monitored to ensure that the current balance 
between retail and office uses is maintained. Existing service stations are encouraged to continue 
operating, but changes in their size, operation, or location are subject to review. Other automotive uses 
are prohibited. The neighborhood-oriented, retail character of the district is further protected by 
prohibiting hotels and nonretail uses. The daytime orientation of the district is maintained by 
prohibitions of entertainment uses and late-night commercial operating hours. 

Housing development is limited. Existing residential units are protected by limitations on 
demolition and prohibition of upper-story conversions; new construction is to be carefully reviewed to 
ensure appropriate scale, design and compatibility with adjacent development.

SEC. 730.1. INNER SUNSET NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL DISTRICT. 

The Inner Sunset Neighborhood Commercial District is located in the Inner Sunset neighborhood, 
consisting of the NC-2 district bounded by Lincoln Way on the north, Fifth Avenue on the east, 
Kirkham Street on the south, and Nineteenth Avenue on the west. The shopping area provides 
convenience goods and services to local Inner Sunset residents, as well as comparison shopping goods 
and services to a larger market area. The commercial district is also frequented by users of Golden 
Gate Park on weekends and by City residents for its eating, drinking, and entertainment places. 
Numerous housing units establish the district&apos;s mixed residential-commercial character. 

The Inner Sunset District controls are designed to protect the existing building scale and promote 
new mixed-use development which is in character with adjacent buildings. The building standards 
regulate large-lot and use development and protect rear yards above the ground story and at 
residential levels. To promote the prevailing mixed use character, most commercial uses are directed 
primarily to the ground story with some upper-story restrictions in new buildings. In order to maintain 
the balanced mix and variety of neighborhood-serving commercial uses and regulate the more 
intensive commercial uses which can generate congestion and nuisance problems, special controls 
prohibit additional eating and drinking uses, restrict expansion and intensification of existing eating 
and drinking establishments, and limit entertainment and tourist hotels. Prohibitions of most 
automobile and drive-up uses protect the district&apos;s continuous retail frontage. 

Housing development in new buildings is encouraged above the ground story. Existing residential 
units are protected by prohibition of upper-story conversions and limitations on demolitions.

SEC. 731.1. NCT-3 — MODERATE-SCALE NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL TRANSIT 
DISTRICT. 

NCT-3 Districts are transit-oriented moderate- to high-density mixed-use neighborhoods of varying 
scale concentrated near transit services. The NCT-3 Districts are mixed use districts that support 
neighborhood-serving commercial uses on lower floors and housing above. These districts are 
well-served by public transit and aim to maximize residential and commercial opportunities on or near 
major transit services. The district&apos;s form can be either linear along transit-priority corridors, 
concentric around transit stations, or broader areas where transit services criss-cross the neighbor- 
hood. Housing density is limited not by lot area, but by the regulations on the built envelope of 
buildings, including height, bulk, setbacks, and lot coverage, and standards for residential uses, 
including open space and exposure, and urban design guidelines. Residential parking is not required 
and generally limited. Commercial establishments are discouraged or prohibited from building 
accessory off-street parking in order to preserve the pedestrian-oriented character of the district and 
prevent attracting auto traffic. There are prohibitions on access (i.e. driveways, garage entries) to 
off-street parking and loading on critical stretches of NC and transit streets to preserve and enhance 
the pedestrian-oriented character and transit function. 

NCT-3 Districts are intended in most cases to offer a wide variety of comparison and specialty goods 
and services to a population greater than the immediate neighborhood, additionally providing 
convenience goods and services to the surrounding neighborhoods. NCT-3 Districts include some of the 
longest linear commercial streets in the City, some of which have continuous retail development for 
many blocks. Large-scale lots and buildings and wide streets distinguish the districts from smaller- 
scaled commercial streets, although the districts may include small as well as moderately scaled lots. 
Buildings may range in height, with height limits varying from four to eight stories. 

NCT-3 building standards permit moderately large commercial uses and buildings. Rear yards are 
protected at residential levels. 

A diversified commercial environment is encouraged for the NCT-3 District, and a wide variety of 
uses are permitted with special emphasis on neighborhood-serving businesses. Eating and drinking, 
entertainment, and financial service uses generally are permitted with certain limitations at the first 
and second stories. Auto-oriented uses are somewhat restricted. Other retail businesses, personal 
services and offices are permitted at all stories of new buildings. Limited storage and administrative 
service activities are permitted with some restrictions. 

Housing development in new buildings is encouraged above the second story. Existing residential 
units are protected by limitations on demolitions and upper-story conversions. (Added by Ord. 72-08,

SEC. 732.1. PACIFIC AVENUE NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL DISTRICT. 

The Pacific Avenue Neighborhood Commercial District, on Pacific Avenue from just east of Polk 
Street to all four corners of Pacific Avenue and Jones Street, is situated on the north slope of the Nob 
Hill neighborhood and south of the Broadway Tunnel. Pacific Avenue is a multi-purpose, small-scale 
mixed-use neighborhood shopping district on a narrow street that provides limited convenience goods 
to the adjacent neighborhoods. 

The Pacific Avenue Neighborhood Commercial District controls are designed to promote a small, 
neighborhood serving mixed-use commercial street that preserves the surrounding neighborhood 
residential character. These controls are intended to preserve livability in a largely low-rise develop- 
ment residential neighborhood, enhance solar access on a narrow street right-of-way and protect 
residential rear yard patterns at the ground floor. (Added by Ord. 167-07, File. No. 070681, App.

Sec. 733.1. San Francisco - Planning Code 1070.8 

SEC. 733.1. UPPER MARKET STREET NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL TRANSIT 
DISTRICT. 

The Upper Market Street Neighborhood Commercial Transit District is located on Market Street 
from Church to Noe Streets, and on side streets off Market. Upper Market Street is a multi-purpose 
commercial district that provides limited convenience goods to adjacent neighborhoods, but also serves 
as a shopping street for a broader trade area. A large number of offices are located on Market Street 
within easy transit access to downtown. The width of Market Street and its use as a major arterial 
diminish the perception of the Upper Market Street Transit District as a single commercial district. 
The street appears as a collection of dispersed centers of commercial activity, concentrated at the 
intersections of Market Street with secondary streets. 

This district is well served by transit and is anchored by the Market Street subway (with stations 
Church Street and Castro Street) and the F-Market historic streetcar line. All light-rail lines in the 
City traverse the district, including the F, J, K, L, M, and N, and additional key cross-town transit 
service crosses Market Street at Fillmore and Castro Streets. Additionally, Market Street is a primary 
bicycle corridor. Housing density is limited not by lot area, but by the regulations on the built envelope 
of buildings, including height, bulk, setbacks, and lot coverage, and standards for residential uses, 
including open space and exposure, and urban design guidelines. Residential parking is not required 
and generally limited. Commercial establishments are discouraged or prohibited from building 
accessory off-street parking in order to preserve the pedestrian-oriented character of the district and 
prevent attracting auto traffic. There are prohibitions on access (i.e. driveways, garage entries) to 
off-street parking and loading on Market and Church Streets to preserve and enhance the pedestrian- 
oriented character and transit function. 

The Upper Market Street district controls are designed to promote moderate-scale development 
which contributes to the definition of Market Street&apos;s design and character. They are also intended to 
preserve the existing mix of commercial uses and maintain the livability of the district and its 
surrounding residential areas. Large-lot and use development is reviewed for consistency with existing 
development patterns. Rear yards are protected at all levels. To promote mixed-use buildings, most 
commercial uses are permitted with some limitations above the second story. In order to maintain 
continuous retail frontage and preserve a balanced mix of commercial uses, ground-story neighborhood- 
serving uses are encouraged, and eating and drinking, entertainment, and financial service uses are 
limited. Ground floor-commercial space is required along Market and Church Streets. Most automobile 
and drive-up uses are prohibited or conditional. 

Housing development in new buildings is encouraged above the second story. Existing upper-story 
residential units are protected by limitations on demolitions and upper-story conversions. (Added by 
Ord. 72-08, File No. 071157, App. 4/3/2008) 

Editor&apos;s Note: 

Ord. 72-08, File No. 071157, approved April 3, 2008, amended the Planning Code by adding provisions 
designated as a new section 732.1. Inasmuch as there already exist provisions so designated, said provisions have 
been included herein as a new section 733.1.

SEC. 781.8. MISSION ALCOHOLIC 
BEVERAGE SPECIAL USE SUBDISTRICT. 

There is an unusually large number of estab- 
lishments dispensing alcoholic beverages, includ- 
ing beer and wine, for both on-site and off-site 
consumption in this area. The existence of this 
many alcoholic beverage establishments appears 
to contribute directly to numerous peace, health, 
safety and general welfare problems in the area, 
including loitering, littering, drug trafficking, 
prostitution, public drunkenness, defacement and 
damaging of structures, pedestrian obstructions, 
as well as traffic circulation, parking and noise 
problems on public streets and neighborhood 
lots. The existence of such problems creates 
serious impacts on the health, safety and welfare 
of residents of nearby single- and multiple- 
family areas, including fear for the safety of 
children, elderly residents and of visitors to the 
area. The problems also contribute to the dete- 
rioration of the neighborhood and concomitant 
devaluation of property and destruction of com- 
munity values and quality of life. The number of 
establishments selling alcoholic beverages and 
the associated problems discourage more desir- 
able and needed commercial uses in the area. In 
order to preserve the residential character and 
the neighborhood-serving commercial uses of the 
area, there shall be a Mission Alcoholic Beverage 
Special Use Subdistrict to prohibit new estab- 
lishments, or expansion of existing establish- 
ments, selling alcoholic beverages for the prop- 
erty in the area generally bounded by Guerrero 
Street, San Jose Avenue, Randall Street, Mission 
Street, Cesar Chavez Street, Potrero Avenue and 
Fourteenth Street as designated on Sectional 
Map Numbers 7SU and 8SU. 

The following restrictions shall apply within 
such district: 

(a) Prohibition of New Establishments 
Selling Alcoholic Beverages. No new estab- 
lishment where alcoholic beverages are sold,

district as set forth below: 

(1) No new bar, as defined in Planning Code 
Section 790.22, shall be permitted in this special 
use district; 

(2) No new off-sale liquor establishment shall

sale liquor establishment&quot; shall mean any estab- 
lishment that is defined in Section 790.55 of this 
Code. 

(b) Prohibition of Expansion of Exist- 
ing Establishments Selling Alcoholic Bever- 
ages. Any establishment selling alcoholic bever- 
ages lawfully existing prior to the effective date 
of this resolution and licensed by the State of 
California for the retail sale of alcoholic bever- 
ages for on-site and off-site consumption, so long 
as otherwise lawful, may continue in existence, 
provided such establishment remains in use, as 
follows: 

(1) In the event that any such establish- 
ment ceases to operate or discontinues operation 
for 30 days of longer as set forth in State law, 
such use shall be deemed abandoned; 

(2) No establishment selling alcoholic bev- 
erages may substantially change the mode or 
character of operation of the establishment, nor 
may it expand the square footage devoted exclu- 
sively to the sale of alcoholic beverages, signifi- 
cantly increase the percentage of alcoholic bev- 
erage sales as a portion of total sales, or change 
its type of retail liquor license within a license 
classification. 

(c) Exception for Bona Fide Restau- 
rant. A bona fide restaurant shall be permitted 
to serve alcoholic beverages in this special use 
district. A &quot;bona fide restaurant&quot; shall mean a 
place which is regularly used and kept open for 
the service of meals to guests for compensation 
and which has (1) suitable kitchen facilities for 
the cooking of an assortment of foods which may 
be required for meals, (2) a primary use of 
sit-down service to patrons, (3) adequate seating 
arrangements for sit-down patrons provided on 
the premises, (4) take-out service that is only 
incidental to the primary sit-down use, (5) alco- 



holic beverages which are sold or dispensed for 
consumption on the premises only when served 
at tables or sit-down counters by employees of 
the restaurant, and (6) a minimum of 51 percent 
of the restaurant&apos;s gross receipts shall be from 
the sale of meals. A &quot;bona fide restaurant&quot; does 
not include any billiard or pool hall, bowling 
alley, or adult entertainment business as defined

consumption in the Haight-Ashbury neighbor- 
hood. A concentration of alcoholic beverage es- 
tablishments in a neighborhood disrupts the 
desired mix of land uses that contribute to a 
livable neighborhood and discourages more de- 
sirable and needed commercial uses in the area. 
A concentration of establishments selling alco- 
holic beverages in an area may therefore contrib- 
ute to the deterioration of the neighborhood and 
to the concomitant devaluation of property and 
destruction of community values and quality of 
life. These effects contribute to peace, health, 
safety and general welfare problems in these 
areas, including loitering, littering, public drunk- 
enness, driving while intoxicated, defacement 
and damaging of structures, pedestrian obstruc- 
tions, as well as traffic circulation, parking and 
noise problems on public streets and neighbor- 
hood lots, and other nuisance activities. The 
existence of such problems creates serious im- 
pacts on the health, safety and welfare of resi- 
dents of nearby single- and multiple-family ar- 
eas. These impacts include fear for the safety of 
children, elderly residents and visitors to the 
area. 

( a ) Haight Street Alcohol Restricted Use 

Subdistrict Established. In order to preserve 
the residential character and the neighborhood- 
serving commercial uses of the Haight-Ashbury 
neighborhood, the Haight Street Alcohol Re-

fined in Code Section 790.64 that contains only a 
single screen and auditorium, has seating for 
150 or fewer persons, and is not a formula retail 
use as defined in Code Section 703.3(b).

quor Establishments. In the Haight Street Alco- 
hol RUSD, any Prohibited Liquor Establishment

Section 180 through 186.2, subject to the follow- 
ing provisions. For purposes of this Section, the 
Haight Street Alcohol RUSD shall be considered 
to include, pursuant to Section 186 of this Code 
and to the Special Provisions for NC-1 Districts, 
the area within V4-mile of the Haight Street

SEC. 782. THIRD STREET ALCOHOL 
RESTRICTED USE DISTRICT 
ESTABLISHED. 

There is an unusually large number of estab- 
lishments dispensing alcoholic beverages, includ- 
ing beer and wine, for both on-site and off-site 
consumption in the Bayview area. The existence 
of this many alcoholic beverage establishments 
appears to contribute directly to numerous peace, 
health, safety and general welfare problems in 
the area, including loitering, littering, drug traf- 
ficking, prostitution, public drunkenness, deface- 
ment and damaging of structures, pedestrian 
obstructions, as well as traffic circulation, park- 
ing and noise problems on public streets and 
neighborhood lots. The existence of such prob- 
lems creates serious impacts on the health, safety 
and welfare of residents of nearby single- and 
multiple-family areas, including fear for the safety 
of children, elderly residents and of visitors to 
the area. The problems also contribute to the 
deterioration of the neighborhood and concomi- 
tant devaluation of property and destruction of 
community values and quality of life. The num- 
ber of establishments selling alcoholic beverages 
and the associated problems discourage more 
desirable and needed commercial uses in the 
area. 

(a) In order to preserve the residential char- 
acter and the neighborhood-serving commercial 
uses of the area, the Third Street Alcohol Re- 



stricted Use District (Third Street Alcohol RUD) 
is hereby established for the property in the area 
generally bounded by Islais Creek to the North, 
Quint Street, Phelps Street, Tampa Street, Brid- 
geview Drive, Newhall Street, Venus Street and

(1) No new on-sale or off-sale liquor estab- 
lishment shall be permitted in the Third Street 
Alcohol RUD. 

(2) The prohibition on Liquor Establish- 
ments shall not be interpreted to prohibit the 
following: 

(A) Temporary uses, as described in Plan- 
ning Code Section 205.1 or 205.3; or 

(B) Establishment of a Liquor Establish- 
ment if application for such Liquor Establish- 
ment is on file with the California Department of 
Alcoholic Beverage Control prior to the effective 
date of legislation establishing the Third Street 
Alcohol RUD. 

(3) Continuation of existing Prohibited Li- 
quor Establishments. In the Third Street Alcohol 
RUD, any Prohibited Liquor Establishment may

SEC. 783. DIVISADERO STREET 
ALCOHOL RESTRICTED USE DISTRICT 
ESTABLISHED. 

There are an unusually large number of 
establishments dispensing alcoholic beverages, 
including beer and wine, for off-site consumption 
in the Small-Scale Neighborhood Commercial 
District along Divisadero Street between Haight 
and Geary Streets. The existence of this many 
alcoholic beverage establishments appears to 
contribute directly to numerous peace, health, 
safety and general welfare problems in the area, 
including loitering, littering, public drunken- 
ness, defacement and damaging of structures, 
pedestrian obstructions, as well as traffic circu- 
lation, parking and noise problems on public 
streets and neighborhood lots. The existence of 
such problems creates serious impacts on the 
health, safety and welfare of residents of nearby 
single- and multiple-family areas, including fear 
for the safety of children, elderly residents and of 
visitors to the area. The problems also contribute 
to the deterioration of the neighborhood and 
concomitant devaluation of property and destruc- 
tion of community values and quality of life. The 
number of establishments selling alcoholic bev- 
erages and the associated problems discourage 
more desirable and needed commercial uses in 
the area. 

(a) In order to preserve the residential char- 
acter and the neighborhood-serving commercial 
uses of the area, the Divisadero Street Alcohol 
Restricted Use District (Divisadero Street Alco- 
hol RUD) is hereby established for the properties

Map numbers 2 and 7. The Divisadero Street 
Alcohol RUD is designated on Sectional Map

(1) No new off-sale liquor establishments

ment if an application for such Liquor Establish- 
ment is on file with the California Department of 
Alcoholic Beverage Control prior to the effective 
date of legislation establishing the Divisadero 
Street Alcohol RUD. 

(C) Re-location of an existing liquor estab- 
lishment from outside the Divisadero Street Al- 
cohol RUD to a location within the Divisadero

received conditional use authorization from the 
City Planning Commission prior to the effective 
date of this legislation.

SEC. 790.68. NEIGHBORHOOD-SERVING 
BUSINESS. 

A neighborhood-serving business cannot be 
defined by the type of use, but rather by the 
characteristics of its customers, types of merchan- 
dise or service, its size, trade area, and the 
number of similar establishments in other neigh- 
borhoods. The primary clientele of a &quot;neighbor- 
hood-serving business,&quot; by definition, is com- 
prised of customers who live and/or work nearby. 

While a neighborhood-serving business may 
derive revenue from customers outside the im- 
mediately surrounding neighborhood, it is not 
dependent on out-of-neighborhood clientele. 

A neighborhood-serving use provides goods 
and/or services which are needed by residents 
and workers in the immediate neighborhood to 
satisfy basic personal and household needs on a 
frequent and recurring basis, and which if not 
available require trips outside of the neighbor- 
hood. 

A use may be more or less neighborhood- 
serving depending upon its trade area. Uses 
which, due to the nature of their products and 
service, tend to be more neighborhood-serving, 
are those which sell convenience items such as 
groceries, personal toiletries, magazines, and 
personal services such as cleaners, laundromats, 
and film processing. Uses which tend to be less 
neighborhood-oriented are those which sell more 
specialized, more expensive, less frequently pur- 
chased comparison goods such as automobiles 
and furniture. 

For many uses (such as stores selling ap- 
parel, household goods, and variety merchan- 
dise), whether a business is neighborhood- 
serving depends on the size of the establishment: 
the larger the use, the larger the trade area, 
hence the less neighborhood-oriented. 

Whether a business is neighborhood-serving 
or not also depends in part on the number and 
availability of other similar establishments in 
other neighborhoods: the more widespread the 



Supp. No. 16, April 2008 



Sec. 790.68.

(h) after this 30-day period, the Planning 
Commission shall schedule a hearing to consider 
whether to exercise its discretionary review pow- 
ers over the building permit application for a 
medical cannabis dispensary. The scheduling and 
the mailed notice for this hearing shall be pro- 
cessed in accordance with Section 312(e) of this 
Code; 

(i) Medical cannabis dispensaries that can 
demonstrate to the Planning Department, based 
on any criteria it may develop, that they were in 
operation as of April 1, 2005 and have remained 
in continuous operation since then, and that they 
have filed an application for a medical cannabis 
dispensary permit as provided in San Francisco 
Health Code section 3304 on or before July 1, 
2007, must obtain a final permit on or before 
March 1, 2008, or must cease operations on 
March 1, 2008, or upon denial of a permit appli- 
cation if it occurs before March 1, 2008. Medical 
cannabis dispensaries that were in operation as 
of April 1, 2005, and were not in continuous 
operation since then, but can demonstrate to the 
Planning Department, based on any criteria it 
may develop, that the reason for their lack of 
continuous operation was not closure due to an 
actual violation of federal, state or local law, also 
must obtain a permit on or before March 1, 2008, 
or must cease operations on March 1, 2008, or 
upon denial of a permit application if it occurs 
before March 1, 2008. Notwithstanding the fore- 
going, in no case shall a dispensary that had or 
has a suspended or revoked permit be considered 
to be in continuous operation. Any dispensary 
that began operation after April 1, 2005, and any 
dispensary that failed to file a permit application 
with the Department of Public Health as pro- 
vided in San Francisco Health Code section 3304 
on or before July 1, 2007, and have failed to file 



completed applications, including a California 
Environmental Quality Act categorical exemp- 
tion application and a discretionary review ap- 
plication, with the Planning Department by Au- 
gust 15, 2007, must immediately cease operations; 
(j) any permit issued for a medical cannabis 
dispensary shall contain the following statement 
in boldface type: &quot;Issuance of this permit by the 
City and County of San Francisco is not intended 
to and does not authorize the violation of State or 
Federal law.&quot; (Added by Ord. 275-05, File No.

(b) Use Limitations. Uses in Chinatown 
Mixed Use Districts are either permitted, condi- 
tional, accessory, temporary, or are not permit- 
ted. 

(1) Permitted Uses. All permitted uses in 
Chinatown Mixed Use Districts shall be con- 
ducted within an enclosed building, unless oth- 
erwise specifically allowed in this Code. Excep- 
tions from this requirement are: accessory off- 
street parking and loading; uses which, when 
located outside of a building, qualify as an out- 
door activity area, as defined in Section 890.71 of 
this Code; and uses which by their nature are to 
be conducted in an open lot or outside a building, 
as described in Sections 890 through 890.140 of 
this Code. 

If there are two or more uses in a structure 
and none is classified under Section 803.2(b)(1)(C) 
of this Code as accessory, then each of these uses 
will be considered separately as an independent 
permitted, conditional, temporary or not permit- 
ted use. 

(A) Principal Uses. Principal uses are per- 
mitted as of right in a Chinatown Mixed Use 
District, when so indicated in Sections 810.1 
through 812.96 of this Code for each district 
class. 

(B) Conditional Uses. Conditional uses are 
permitted in a China-town Mixed Use District 
when authorized by the Planning Commission; 
whether a use is conditional in a given district is 
indicated in Sections 810 through 812. Condi- 
tional uses are subject to the provisions set forth 
in Section 303 of this Code. 

(i) An establishment which sells beer and 
wine with motor vehicle fuel is a conditional use, 
and shall be governed by Section 229. 



(ii) Any use or feature which lawfully ex- 
isted and was permitted as a principal or condi- 
tional use on the effective date of these controls 
which is not otherwise nonconforming or ncncom- 
plying as defined in Section 180 of this Code, and 
which use or feature is not permitted under this 
Article is deemed to be a permitted conditional 
use subject to the provisions of this Code. 

(iii) Notwithstanding any other provision of 
this Article, a change in use or demolition of a 
movie theater use, as set forth in Section 890.64, 
shall require conditional use authorization. This 
Subsection shall not authorize a change in use if 
the new use or uses are otherwise prohibited. 

(iv) Notwithstanding any other provision of 
this Article, a change in use or demolition of a 
general grocery store use, as set forth in Section 
890.102(a) and as further defined in Section 
790.102(a), shall require conditional use autho- 
rization. This Subsection shall not authorize a 
change in use if the new use or uses are ether- 
wise prohibited. 

(C) Accessory Uses. Subject to the limita- 
tions set forth below and in Sections 204.1 (Ac- 
cessory Uses for Dwelling Units in R Districts) 
and 204.5 (Parking and Loading as Accessory 
Uses) of this Code, a related minor use which is 
either necessary to the operation or enjoyment of 
a lawful principal use or conditional use or is 
appropriate, incidental and subordinate to any 
such use, shall be permitted in Chinatown Mixed 
Use Districts as an accessory use when located 
on the same lot. Any use not qualified as an 
accessory use shall only be allowed as a principal 
or conditional use, unless it qualifies as a tem- 
porary use under Sections 205 through 205.2 of 
this Code.

Mixed Use Districts 



Sec. 803.3. 



No use in a Chinatown Mixed Use District 
will be considered accessory to a principal use 
which involves or requires any of the following: 

(i) The use of more than V3 of the total floor 
area occupied by both the accessory use and the 
principal use to which it is accessory, combined, 
except in the case of accessory off-street parking; 

(ii) Any bar, restaurant, other entertain- 
ment, or any retail establishment which serves 
liquor for consumption on-site; 

(iii) Any take-out food use, except for a 
take-out food use which occupies 100 square feet 
or less (including the area devoted to food prepa- 
ration and service and excluding storage and 
waiting areas) in a retail grocery or specialty 
food store; 

(iv) The wholesaling, manufacturing or pro- 
cessing of foods, goods, or commodities on the 
premises of an establishment which does not 
also provide for primarily retail sale of such 
foods, goods or commodities at the same location 
where such wholesaling, manufacturing or pro- 
cessing takes place. 

The above shall not prohibit take-out food 
activity which operates in conjunction with a 
fast-food restaurant. A fast-food restaurant, by 
definition, includes take-out food as an accessory 
and necessary part of its operation. 

(D) Temporary Uses. Uses not otherwise 
permitted are permitted in Chinatown Mixed 
Use Districts to the extent authorized by Sec- 
tions 205, 205.1 or 205.2 of this Code. 

(2) Not Permitted Uses. 

(A) Uses which are not listed in this Article 
are not permitted in a Chinatown Mixed Use 
District unless determined by the Zoning Admin- 
istrator to be permitted uses in accordance with 
Section 307(a) of this Code. 

(B) No use, even though listed as a permit- 
ted use or otherwise allowed, shall be permitted 
in a Chinatown Mixed Use District which, by 
reason of its nature or manner of operation, 
creates conditions that are hazardous, noxious, 
or offensive through the emission of odor, fumes, 
smoke, cinders, dust, gas, vibration, glare, refuse, 
water-carried waste, or excessive noise. 



(C) The establishment of a use that sells 
alcoholic beverages, other than beer and wine, 
concurrent with motor vehicle fuel is prohibited, 
and shall be governed by Section 229. (Added by 
Ord. 131-87, App. 4/24/87; amended by Ord.

SEC. 803.6. FORMULA RETAIL USES IN 
THE WESTERN SOMA PLANNING AREA 
SPECIAL USE DISTRICT. 

(a) Findings. 

(1) San Francisco is a City of diverse and 
distinct neighborhoods identified in large part by 
the character of their commercial areas. 

(2) San Francisco needs to protect its vi- 
brant small business sector and create a support- 
ive environment for new small business innova- 
tions. One of the eight Priority Policies of the 
City&apos;s General Plan resolves that &quot;existing neigh- 
borhood-serving retail uses be preserved and 
enhanced and future opportunities for resident 
employment in and ownership of such busi- 
nesses enhanced.&quot; 

(3) Retail uses are the land uses most criti- 
cal to the success of the City&apos;s commercial dis- 
tricts. 

(4) Formula retail businesses are increas- 
ing in number in San Francisco, as they are in 
cities and towns across the country. 

(5) Money earned by independent busi- 
nesses is more likely to circulate within the local 
neighborhood and City economy than the money 
earned by formula retail businesses which often 
have corporate offices and vendors located out- 
side of San Francisco. 

(6) Formula retail businesses can have a 
competitive advantage over independent opera- 
tors because they are typically better capitalized 
and can absorb larger startup costs, pay more for 
lease space, and commit to longer lease con- 
tracts. This can put pressure on existing busi- 
nesses and potentially price out new startup 
independent businesses.

San Francisco - Planning Code

(7) San Francisco is one of a very few major 
urban centers in the State in which housing, 
shops, work places, schools, parks and civic fa- 
cilities intimately co-exist to create strong iden- 
tifiable neighborhoods. The neighborhood streets 
invite walking and bicycling and the City&apos;s mix 
of architecture contributes to a strong sense of 
neighborhood community within the larger City 
community. 

(8) Notwithstanding the marketability of a 
retailer&apos;s goods or services or the visual attrac- 
tiveness of the storefront, the standardized ar- 
chitecture, color schemes, decor and signage of 
many formula retail businesses can detract from 
the distinctive character of certain neighborhood 
commercial districts. 

(9) The increase of formula retail busi- 
nesses in the City&apos;s neighborhood commercial 
areas, if not monitored and regulated, will ham- 
per the City&apos;s goal of a diverse retail base with 
distinct neighborhood retailing personalities com- 
prised of a mix of businesses. Specifically, the 
unregulated and unmonitored establishment of 
additional formula retail uses may unduly limit 
or eliminate business establishment opportuni- 
ties for smaller or medium-sized businesses, many 
of which tend to be non-traditional or unique,

national retailers in lieu of local or regional 
retailers, thereby decreasing the diversity of 
merchandise available to residents and visitors

THE MIXED USE DISTRICT ZONING 
CONTROLS. 

Mixed Use District controls are set forth in 
the Zoning Control Tables in Sections 810 through 
818, and in Section 827 or referenced in Section 
899 of this Code. 

(a) The first column in the Zoning Control 
Table, titled &quot;No.&quot; provides a category number 
for each zoning control category. 



(b) The second column in the table, titled 
&quot;Zoning Control Category,&quot; lists zoning control 
categories for the district in question. 

(c) The third column, titled &quot;§ References,&quot; 
contains numbers of other sections in the Plan- 
ning Code and other City Codes, in which addi- 
tional relevant provisions are contained. 

(d) In the fourth column, the controls appli- 
cable to the various Mixed Use Districts are 
indicated either directly or by reference to other 
Code Sections which contain the controls. 

The following symbols are used in this table: 

P — Permitted as a principal use. 
C — Permitted as a conditional use, sub- 
ject to the provisions set forth in this 
Code. 
— A blank space on the tables in Sec- 
tions 810 through 812 indicates that 
the use or feature is not permitted 
within the Chinatown Mixed Use Dis- 
tricts. Unless a use or feature is per- 
mitted or required in the Chinatown 
Mixed Use Districts as set forth in the 
Zoning Control Tables or in those sec- 
tions referenced in Section 899 of this 
Code, such use or feature is prohib- 
ited, unless determined by the Zoning 
Administrator to be a permitted use. 
NP — Not Permitted. Section 803.4 lists cer- 
tain uses not permitted in any South 
of Market District. NP in the Article 8 
control column of Tables 813 through 
818 also indicates that the use or 
feature is not permitted in the appli- 
cable South of Market District.

Supp. No. 1, September 2006 



Sec. 810.1. San Francisco - Planning Code 1148.2 

SEC. 810.1. CHINATOWN COMMUNITY BUSINESS DISTRICT. 

The Chinatown Community Business District, located in the northeast quadrant of San Francisco, 
extends along Broadway from the eastern portal of the Broadway Tunnel to Columbus Avenue and 
along Kearny Street from Columbus to Sacramento Street. This district also includes portions of 
Commercial Street between Montgomery Street and Grant Avenue and portions of Grant Avenue 
between Bush and California Streets. It is part of the larger core area of Chinatown. 

The portions of Broadway, Kearny and Commercial Streets and Grant Avenue in this district are 
transitional edges or entries to Chinatown. North and east of the two blocks of Broadway contained in 
this district are North Beach and the Broadway Entertainment Districts. Kearny and Columbus 
Streets are close to intensive office development in the Downtown Financial District. Both Grant 
Avenue and Commercial Street provide important pedestrian entries to Chinatown. Generally, this 
district has more potential for added retail and commercial development than other parts of 
Chinatown. 

This zoning district is intended to protect existing housing, encourage new housing and to 
accommodate modest expansion of Chinatown business activities as well as street-level retail uses. 
The size of individual professional or business office use is limited in order to prevent these areas from 
being used to accommodate larger office uses spilling over from the financial district. 

Housing development in new buildings is encouraged at upper stories. Existing housing is 
protected by limitations on demolitions and upper-story conversions.

SEC. 811.1. CHINATOWN VISITOR RETAIL DISTRICT. 

The Chinatown Visitor Retail Neighborhood Commercial District extends along Grant Avenue 
between California and Jackson Streets. This district contains a concentration of shopping bazaars, art 
goods stores and restaurants which attract visitors and shoppers and contribute to the City&apos;s visual 
and economic diversity. Grant Avenue provides an important link between Downtown retail shopping 
and the Broadway, North Beach and Fisherman&apos;s Wharf areas. 

This district is intended to preserve the street&apos;s present character and scale and to accommodate 
uses primarily appealing to visitors (e.g tourist gifts shops, jewelry stores, art goods, large restaurants. 
In order to promote continuous retail frontage, entertainment, financial services, medical service, 
automotive and drive-up uses are restricted. Most commercial uses, except financial services are 
permitted on the first two stories. Administrative services, (those not serving the public) are prohibited 
in order to prevent encroachment from downtown office uses. There are also special controls on 
fast-food restaurants and tourist hotels. Building standards protect and complement the existing 
small-scale development and the historic character of the area. 

The height limit applicable to the district will accommodate two floors of housing or institutional 
use above two floors of retail use. Existing residential units are protected by prohibition of upper- story 
conversions and limitation on demolition.

SEC. 812.1. CHINATOWN RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL DISTRICT. 

The Chinatown Residential Neighborhood Commercial District extends along Stockton Street 
between Sacramento and Broadway and along Powell Street between Washington Street and 
Broadway. It is generally west and uphill from Grant Avenue and is close to the relatively intensely 
developed residential areas of lower Nob and Russian Hills. Stockton Street is a major transit corridor 
which serves as &quot;Main Street&quot; for the Chinatown neighborhood. Both Stockton and Powell Streets 
contain a significant amount of housing as well as major community institutions supportive to 
Chinatown and the larger Chinese community. This daytime-oriented district provides local and 
regional specialty food shopping for fresh vegetables, poultry, fish and meat. Weekends are this area&apos;s 
busiest shopping days. 

Because Stockton Street is intended to remain principally in its present character, the Stockton 
Street controls are designed to preserve neighborhood-serving uses and protect the residential 
livability of the area. The controls promote new residential development compatible with existing 
small-scale mixed-use character of the area. Consistent with the residential character of the area, 
commercial development is directed to the ground story. Daytime-oriented use is protected and 
tourist-related uses, fast-food restaurants and financial services are limited. 

Housing development in new and existing buildings is encouraged above the ground floor. 
Institutional uses are also encouraged. Existing residential units are protected by limits on demolition 
and conversion.

SEC. 813. RED — RESIDENTIAL ENCLAVE DISTRICT. 

Residential Enclave Districts (RED) encompass the clusters of low-scale, medium density, predomi- 
nantly residential neighborhoods located along the narrow side streets of the South of Market SLR 
district. Within these predominantly residential enclaves lie a number of vacant parcels, parking lots 
and other properties in open storage use. These properties are undeveloped or underdeveloped and are 
viewed as opportunity sites for new, moderate-income, in-fill housing. 



Supp. No. 12, November/December 2007 



1165 



Mixed Use Districts 



Sec. 813. 



The zoning controls for this district are tailored to the design needs and neighborhood character- 
istics of these enclaves and are intended to encourage and facilitate the development of attractive, 
compatible and economically feasible in-fill housing while providing adequate residential amenities to 
the site and neighborhood. 

Dwelling units are permitted as a principal use. Social services and institutional uses are 
permitted as conditional uses. Group housing, retail, entertainment, general commercial and services 
light industrial uses are not permitted. Existing commercial activities in nonresidential structures 
may continue as nonconforming uses subject to the termination requirements of Sections 185 and 186. 
Live/work units limited to arts activities are permitted within the district as a principal use. Existing 
live/work units with other nonresidential uses may continue as nonconforming uses.

SEC. 814. SPD — SOUTH PARK DISTRICT. 

South Park is an attractive affordable mixed-use neighborhood. The South Park District (SPD) is 
intended to preserve the scale, density and mix of commercial and residential activities within this 
unique neighborhood. The district is characterized by small-scale, continuous-frontage warehouse, 
retail and residential structures built in a ring around an oval-shaped, grassy park. Retention of the 
existing structures is encouraged, as is a continued mix of uses and in-fill development which 
contributes positively to the neighborhood scale and use mix. 

Most retail, general commercial, office, service/light industrial, arts, live/work and residential 
activities are permitted. Group housing, social services, and other institutional uses are conditional 
uses. Hotels, motels, movie theaters, adult entertainment and nighttime entertainment are not 
permitted. (Added by Ord. 115-90, App. 4/6/90)

SEC. 815. RSD — RESIDENTIAL/SERVICE MIXED USE DISTRICT. 

The Residential/Service Mixed Use District (RSD) serves as a buffer between the higher-density, 
predominantly commercial area of Yerba Buena Center to the east and the low-scale, predominantly 
service/industrial area west of Sixth Street. The RSD serves as a major housing opportunity area 
within the South of Market District. The district controls are intended to facilitate the development of 
high-density, mid-rise housing, including residential hotels and live/work units, while also encouraging 
the expansion of retail, business service and commercial and cultural arts activities. 

Residential hotels are subject to flexible standards for parking, rear yard/open space and density. 
Continuous ground floor commercial frontage with pedestrian-oriented retail activities along major 
thoroughfares is encouraged. 

General office, hotels, nighttime entertainment, adult entertainment, massage establishment, 
movie theaters and heavy industrial uses are not permitted. (Added by Ord. 115-90, App. 4/6/90)

SEC. 816. SLR — SERVICE/LIGHT INDUSTRIAL/RESIDENTIAL MIXED USE DISTRICT. 

The Service/Light Industrial/Residential (SLR) Mixed Use District is designed to maintain and 
facilitate the growth and expansion of small-scale light industrial, home and business service, 
wholesale distribution, arts production and performance/exhibition activities, live/work use, general 
commercial and neighborhood-serving retail and personal service activities while protecting existing 
housing and encouraging the development of housing and live/work space at a scale and density 
compatible with the existing neighborhood. 

Housing and live/work units are encouraged over ground floor commercial/service/light industrial 
activity. New residential or mixed use developments are encouraged to provide as much mixed-income 
rental housing as possible. Existing group housing and dwelling units would be protected from 
demolition or conversion to nonresidential use by requiring conditional use review. 

General office, hotels, nighttime entertainment, movie theaters, adult entertainment and heavy 
industrial uses are not permitted. (Added by Ord. 115-90, App. 4/6/90)

SEC. 818. SSO — SERVICE/SECONDARY OFFICE DISTRICT. 

The Service/Secondary Office District (SSO) is designed to accommodate small-scale light indus- 
trial, home and business services, arts activities, live/work units, and small-scale, professional office 
space and large-floor-plate &quot;back office&quot; space for sales and clerical work forces. Nighttime entertain- 
ment is permitted as a conditional use. Dwelling units and group housing are permitted as conditional 
uses. Demolition or conversion of existing group housing or dwelling units requires conditional use 
authorization. 

Office, general commercial, most retail, service and light industrial uses are principal permitted 
uses. Large hotel, movie theater, adult entertainment and heavy industrial uses are not permitted. 

Small hotels of 75 rooms or less are permitted in this District only as a conditional use. Any such 
conditional use authorization requires a conditional use finding that disallows project proposals that 
displace existing Production, Distribution and Repair (PDR) uses. (Added by Ord. 115-90, App. 4/6/90; 
amended by Ord. 174-05, File No. 050830, App. 7/29/2005)

SEC. 825. DTR — DOWNTOWN 
RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS. 

Description. Downtown Residential (DTR) 
Districts are transit-oriented, high-density mixed- 
use residential neighborhoods in and around 
downtown. These areas are generally transition- 
ing from a variety of commercial and industrial 
to residential uses. The intent of this district is to 
enable a mix of new day and nighttime activities, 
with an emphasis on encouraging new housing 
within walking distance or a short transit-ride of 
downtown, supported by a mix of retail, and 
neighborhood services to meet the needs of resi- 
dents and the larger downtown community. 

High-density residential uses, including resi- 
dential towers in select locations, are allowed 
and encouraged within the limits set by height 
and bulk controls. Given the district&apos;s proximity 
to downtown, a range of commercial uses is 
permitted on the lower stories, with active pe- 
destrian-oriented retail, service, and entertain- 
ment uses on the ground floor. Along special 
streets, pedestrian-oriented uses are required on 
the first floor. Ground floor entries to individual 
dwelling units are encouraged on streets that 
will become primarily residential. 

There is generally no pattern of mid-block 
open space or of rear yards. While lot coverage is 
limited for all levels with residential uses, tradi- 
tional rear yard open spaces are not required 
except in the limited instances where there is an 
existing pattern of them. Specific height and 
bulk controls establish appropriate heights for 
both towers and mid-rise development, and en- 
sure adequate spacing between towers and pre- 
serve light and air to streets and open spaces. 



Setbacks are required where necessary to buffer 
ground floor residential uses or to ensure sun- 
light access to streets and open spaces. To sup- 
port the intensification of land uses in these 
districts, detailed traffic, streetscape and open 
space improvements will take place over time. 

Downtown Residential Districts include all of 
the individual DTR districts governed by Section 
827 of this Code. The Transbay Downtown Resi- 
dential District (TB-DTR), as set forth in Section 
828, is governed by the Transbay Redevelopment 
Plan and its Development Controls and Design 
Guidelines. (Added by Ord. 217-05, File No. 
050865, App. 8/19/2005; Ord. 94-06, File No. 
050182, App. 5/19/2006) 

SEC. 825.1. USES PERMITTED IN 
DOWNTOWN RESIDENTIAL DISTRIC TS. 

(a) Use Categories. A use is the specified 
purpose for which a property or building is used, 
occupied, maintained, or leased. Whether or not 
a use is permitted in a specific Downtown Resi- 
dential District is generally set forth, summa- 
rized or cross-referenced in Section 827 of this 
Code for each district class. 

(b) Use Limitations. Uses in Downtown 
Residential Districts are either permitted, con- 
ditional, accessory, temporary or are not permit- 
ted. 

(1) Permitted Uses. If there are two or 
more uses in a structure, any use not classified 
below under Section 825.1(b)(1)(C) of this Code 
as accessory will be considered separately as an 
independent permitted, conditional, temporary 
or not permitted use. 

(A) Principal Uses. Principal uses are; per- 
mitted as of right in a Downtown Residential 
District, when so indicated in Section 827 of this 
Code for the district. Additional requirements 
and conditions may be placed on particular uses 
as provided pursuant to Section 803.5 and other 
applicable provisions of this Code. 

(B) Conditional Uses. Conditional uses are 
permitted in a Downtown Residential district, 
when authorized by the Planning Commission; 
whether a use is conditional in a given district is 
generally indicated in Section 827 of this Code. 



Supp. No. 15, March 2008

shall require conditional use authorization. This 
Section shall not authorize a change in use if the 
new use or uses are otherwise prohibited. 

(C) Accessory Uses. Subject to the limita- 
tions set forth below, in Section 151.1, and else- 
where in this Code, an accessory use is a related 
minor use which is either necessary to the opera- 
tion or enjoyment of a lawful principal use or 
conditional use, or is appropriate, incidental and 
subordinate to any such use, and shall be per- 
mitted as an accessory use in a Downtown Resi- 
dential District. In order to accommodate a prin- 
cipal use which is carried out by one business in 
multiple locations within the same general area, 
such accessory use need not be located in the 
same structure or lot as its principal use pro- 
vided that (1) the accessory use is located within 
1,000 feet of the principal use, (2) the multiple 
locations existed on the effective date of this 
amendment; and (3) the existence of the multiple 
locations is acknowledged in writing by the Zon- 
ing Administrator within 60 days after the effec- 
tive date of this amendment. Any use, which 
does not qualify as an accessory use, shall be 
classified as a principal use. 

No use will be considered accessory to a 
principal use, which involves or requires any of 
the following: 

(i) The use of more than one-third of the 
total occupied floor area which is occupied by 
both the accessory use and principal use to which 
it is accessory, combined, except in the case of 



accessory off-street parking or loading which 
shall be subject to the provisions of Sections 151, 
151.1, 156 and 157 of this Code; 

(ii) Nighttime entertainment, massage es- 
tablishment, large fast food restaurant, or movie 
theater use; 

(iii) Any sign not conforming to the limita- 
tions of Section 607.2(f)(3). 

(D) Temporary Uses. Temporary uses not 
otherwise permitted are permitted in Downtown 
Residential Districts to the extent authorized by 
Sections 205 through 205.3 of this Code. 

(E) Prohibited Uses. 

(i) Uses which are not specifically listed in 
Section 827 or Article 6 are not permitted unless 
they qualify as a nonconforming use pursuant to 
Sections 180 through 186.1 of this Code or are 
determined by the Zoning Administrator to be 
permitted uses in accordance with Section 307(a) 
of this Code. 

(ii) No use, even though listed as a permit- 
ted use or otherwise allowed, shall be permitted 
in a Downtown Residential District which, by 
reason of its nature or manner of operation, 
creates conditions that are hazardous, noxious,

SEC. 827. RINCON HILL DOWNTOWN RESIDENTIAL MIXED USE DISTRICT (RH 
DTR). 

The Rincon Hill Downtown Residential Mixed Use District (RH DTR), the boundaries of which are 
shown in Section Map No. 1 of the Zoning Map, is established for the purposes set forth below. 

The RH DTR District is adjacent to the southern edge of the downtown, generally bounded by 
Folsom Street, the Bay Bridge, the Embarcadero, and Essex Street. High-density residential uses and 
supporting commercial and institutional uses are allowed and encouraged within the limits set by 
height, bulk, and tower spacing controls. Folsom Street is intended to develop as the neighborhood 
commercial heart of the Rincon Hill and Transbay neighborhoods, and pedestrian-oriented uses are 
required on the ground floor. Individual townhouse dwelling units with ground floor entries directly to 
the street are required on streets that will become primarily residential, including First, Fremont, 
Beale, Main, and Spear Streets. 

While lot coverage is limited for all levels with residential uses that do not face onto streets or 
alleys, traditional rear yard open spaces are not required except in the limited instances where there

is an existing pattern of them, such as smaller lots on the Guy Place block. Specific height, bulk, and 
setback controls establish appropriate heights for both towers and mid-rise podium development and 
ensure adequate spacing between towers in order to establish a neighborhood scale and ensure light 
and air to streets and open spaces. Setbacks are required where necessary to provide transition space 
for ground floor residential uses and to ensure sunlight access to streets and open spaces. Off-street 
parking must be located below grade. 

Given the need for services and open space resulting from new development, projects will provide 
or contribute funding for the creation of public open space and community facilities as described in the 
Rincon Hill Area Plan of the General Plan. The Rincon Hill Streetscape Plan, part of the Area Plan, 
proposes to enhance and redesign most streets in the district to create substantial new open space 
amenities, improve pedestrian conditions, and improve the flow of local traffic and transit. Detailed 
standards for the provision of open spaces, mid-block pathways, and residential entries are provided 
to ensure that new buildings contribute to creating a public realm of the highest quality in Rincon Hill.

(a) Development Concept. The development concept is for podium development up to 85 feet in 
height, with slender residential towers spaced to provide ample light and air to the district;. New 
development will contribute to the creation of a substantial amount of public open space, as well as 
provide private common areas, courtyards, and balconies. Streets will be improved to provide widened 
sidewalks with substantial public open space. Ground floor uses will be pedestrian-oriented in 
character, consisting primarily of retail on Folsom Street, and individual townhouse-style residential 
units on First, Fremont, Beale, Main, and Spear Streets, as well as on alleys and mid-block pathways. 
Parking will be located below grade, and building utilities (loading bays, service doors, garage doors) 
will be located in sidewalk vaults or on secondary frontages.

(b) Residential Use Controls. 

(1) Residential Density. There shall be no density limit for residential uses, as defined by 
Section 890.88 of this Code, in the Rincon Hill Downtown Residential District. The provisions of 
Sections 207 through 208 related to residential density shall not apply. 

(2) Required Residential to Non-Residential Use Ratio. For newly constructed buildings or 
additions which exceed 20 percent or more of an existing structure&apos;s gross floor area, at least six 
occupiable square feet of residential use shall be provided for each occupiable square foot of 
non-residential use, excluding accessory parking, on any lot legally existing. Lawfully existing 
live/work units shall be considered as non-residential uses for the purpose of this section, and do not 
satisfy the residential requirement. Exemption from the required use ratio for building additions of 
less than 20 percent may not be granted for any single lot if such an exemption would increase the total 
square footage of the building to an amount 20 percent greater than existed on the lot since the 
adoption of this Section. 

(3) Required unit size mix. No less than 40 percent of all units on-site must have at least two 
bedrooms or more. Projects are encouraged to have at least 10 percent of all units on site with three 
bedrooms or more. 

(4) For newly constructed buildings or additions, which exceed 20 percent or more of an existing 
structure&apos;s gross floor area, all building area above 85 feet in height shall be devoted to residential use. 

(5) Housing Requirement for Residential Developments. The requirements of Sections 315 
through 315.9 shall apply in the RH DTK subject to the following exceptions: 

(A) If constructed on-site, a minimum of 12 percent of the total units constructed, and if 
constructed off-site, a minimum of 17 percent of the total units constructed, shall be affordable to and 
occupied by qualifying persons and families as defined elsewhere in this Code. 

(B) Below-market-rate units as required by Sections 315 through 315.9 that are built off-site 
must be built within the area bounded by Market Street, the Embarcade.ro, King Street, Division 
Street, and South Van Ness Avenue. 

(C) No less than fifty percent (50%) of the fees that are paid due to development in the Rincon Hill 
Area Plan under Section 315.4(e)(2) and 315.6 shall be paid into the Citywide Affordable Housing 
Fund, but the funds shall be separately accounted for and designated exclusively to increase the supply 
of affordable housing in the SOMA area. 

(D) Fifty percent (50%) of the below-market rate units as required by Section 315 through 315.9 
that are built on- or off-site must be provided as rental units for the life of the project, as defined in 
Planning Code Section 315.7(a). 

(E) The Mayor&apos;s Office of Housing must submit a resolution to the Board of Supervisors with a 
plan for the use of all in lieu fee payments generated from the Rincon Hill Plan prior to any 
expenditure of the Funds. 

(c) Street-Facing Use Requirements. Pedestrian-oriented retail, residential, institutional 
uses, and community services are required ground floor uses on all street facing frontages, except for 
the minimum frontage required for fire doors, parking and loading access, and other utilities. 

(1) Required Ground Floor Retail Spaces. For frontages facing Folsom Street, ground floor 
space suitable for retail use is required for no less than 75 percent of all frontages, as specified in 
Section 145.4. 

(2) Required Individual Ground Floor Residential Units. For building frontages facing 
Fremont, First, Main, Beale and Spear Streets more than 60 feet from an intersection with Folsom, 
Harrison, or Bryant Streets, and for building frontages facing Guy Place and Lansing Street, 
individual ground floor residential units with direct pedestrian access to the sidewalk are required at

intervals of no greater than 25 feet, except where residential lobbies, parking and loading access, 
utilities, and open space are necessary and provided pursuant to the allowances of Section 827 and 
other sections of this Code. Individual ground floor residential units are also encouraged along 
Harrison Street, Bryant Street, and alleys and mid-block pedestrian paths where appropriate.

( d ) Building Design Standards. 

(1) Required Streetwall. Building area 
below 85 feet in height is required to be built to 
100 percent of all property lines facing public 
rights-of-way, except where setbacks are re- 
quired by this Section and except where publicly 
accessible open space is provided according to 
the provisions of this Section. Recesses, insets 
and breaks between buildings are permitted to 
provide vertical articulation to the facade, pro- 
vided the overall integrity of the streetwall is 
maintained. 

( 2) Lot Coverage. The requirements of Sec- 
tion 134 shall not apply in the RH DTR District. 
Lot coverage is limited to 80 percent at all 
residential levels except on levels in which all 
residential units face onto a public right-of-way 
or mid-block pedestrian path meeting the mini- 
mum standards of this Section. The unbuilt 
portion of the lot shall be open to the sky except 
for those obstructions permitted in yards pursu- 
ant to Section 136(c). Exceptions to the 20 per- 
cent open area requirement may be granted, 
pursuant to the provisions of Section 309.1, for 
conversions of existing non-residential struc- 
tures where it is determined that provision of 20 
percent open area would require partial demoli- 
tion of the existing non-residential structure. 
Lots fronting only on the north side of Guy Place 
are permitted up to 80 percent lot coverage. 

(3) Dwelling Unit Exposure. The require- 
ments of Section 140 shall apply. Reductions in 
this requirement may be granted though the 
procedures of Section 309.1. 

(4) Upper Story Setback. To ensure ad- 
equate sunlight to streets, alleys, and pedestrian 
pathways, upper story setbacks are required as 
follows: 

(A) All buildings are required to set back at 
least 10 feet above a height of 65 feet along 
Spear, Main, Beale, Fremont and First Streets. 



This requirement shall not apply to street front- 
age occupied by a building taller than 85 feet. 
This upper story setback requirement shall also 
not apply to the first 60 linear feet of frontage 
from corners at Folsom, Harrison, and Bryant 
Streets. 

(B) Buildings greater than 60 linear feet 
from a major street along Guy Place, Lansing 
Street, and any proposed or existing private or 
public mid-block pedestrian pathways, are re- 
quired to be set back at least 10 feet above 45 feet 
in height from said right-of-way. 

(C) In order to increase sun access to mid- 
block pathways and uses along such pathways, 
all building frontage on the southeast side of 
mid-block pathways not occupied by a building 
taller than 85 feet must set back upper stories by 
10 feet above a building height of 45 feet. For 
projects on the south side of a mid-block pedes- 
trian pathway taller than 65 feet, an additional 
upper story setback of 10 feet is required above a 
building height of 65 feet. 

(i) Modifications. For any lot on the north 
side of a required mid-block pedestrian pathway, 
a modification from the required upper story 
setback of 10 feet above a height of 45 feet may 
be granted according to the provisions of Section 
309.1, provided that, in total, the building is set 
back by a volume equal to what would be re- 
quired by meeting the standard in (C) above, and 
the modification would substantially improve 
the accessibility, design and character of the 
mid-block pedestrian pathway.

(5) Ground Floor Residential Units. 

Where ground floor residential units are re- 
quired along Spear, Main, Beale, Fremont, and 
First Streets, the following design standards 
apply. Ground floor residential units along Guy 
Place and Lansing Street, within the footprint of 
towers taller than 105 feet, and those that are 
proposed in locations where they are not re- 
quired, are encouraged to meet the standards in 
this subsection to the greatest degree possible. 

(A) Facade Articulation. Individual resi- 
dential units are required to be vertically articu- 
lated at regular intervals of no greater than 25 
feet. Changes in vertical massing, architectural 
projections and recesses may be used to achieve 
this articulation. 

(B) Setback Dimensions. Building set- 
backs are required to create a transitional space 
between the public realm of the street and the 
private realm of the individual dwelling unit. 
The setback shall be implemented according to 
the following specifications, and as illustrated in 
Figures 827(E) and 827(F): 

(i) The entire building facade must be set 
back from the street-abutting property line a 
minimum of three feet, an average of five feet, 
and not in excess of ten feet. 

(ii) All projections allowed by Section 136 
permitted in front setbacks are permitted, except 
for garages and driveways. Architectural projec- 



tions, such as bay windows, are encouraged and 
may extend down to the ground provided they do 
not encroach within the 18-inch landscaping 
strip required by subsection (hi). Railings, fences, 
and grilles up to a height of 3 feet 6 inches that 
are at least 75 percent open to perpendicular 
view are permitted on top of an landing or porch, 
regardless of the combined total height of the 
railing and porch from street grade. 

(iii) A landscaped strip at grade with the 
sidewalk is required for the first 18 inches of the 
setback, for at least 50 percent of the width of 
each residential unit. 

(iv) Setbacks proposed to be greater than 
five feet are encouraged to provide a porch or 
landscape area at grade with the residential 
entry 

(C) Residential Entries. 

(i) Residential entries are required to be 
raised an average of three feet above street 
grade. 

(ii) Each entry is required to have a vesti- 
bule at least one foot in depth from the building 
facade. The entry vestibule may be no less than 
five feet wide and no less than the height of&quot; the 
ground story. 

(D) Landscaping in Setbacks. All build- 
ing setback areas not occupied by steps, porches 
or other occupiable space must be landscaped. 



Supp. No. 3, November/December 2006 



1205 



Mixed Use Districts 



Sec. 827 



Setbacks should be designed to provide access to 
landscaped areas, encouraging gardening and 
other uses by residents. 

(i ) A water source must be provided for each 
residential setback. 



(ii) To allow for landscaping and street trees 
at street grade, parking must be located for 
enough below the surface of the setback to pro- 
vide a minimum soil depth of 3 feet 6 inches. A 
continuous soil trough should be provided with 
adequate centrally-operated irrigation.

a minimum depth of 25 feet from the Folsom 
Street facade. 

(B) Minimum Ceiling Height. Ground floor 
non-residential spaces along Folsom Street must 
have a minimum 12 foot 6 inch clear ceiling 
height for the first 25 feet of depth fronting 
Folsom Street. 

(C) Transparency and Fenestration. Non- 
residential frontages must be fenestrated with 
windows and doorways for no less than 60 per- 
cent of the facade area. No less than 75 percent 
of the fenestrated area must be transparent. The 
use of dark or mirrored glass is not permitted or 
required transparent area. 

(D) Maximum Frontage. A single ground 
floor commercial tenant may not occupy more 
than 75 linear feet of frontage for the first 25 feet 



of depth from the street facing facade along any 
major street. Separate individual storefronts shall 
wrap large footprint ground floor uses for the 
first 25 feet of depth. 

(7) Lighting. Pedestrian-scaled lighting 
shall be provided as an integral element of all 
building facades and shall be designed and lo- 
cated to accentuate the uses facing the street. 
Pedestrian-scaled lighting shall be incorporated 
into all facades and landscaped setback areas in 
the form of wall sconces, entry illumination and 
low-level lighting set into edging features. Light- 
ing should be designed to accentuate ground 
floor retail and residential entries. Incandescent 
or color-corrected lighting sources must be used.

parking in the RH DTR shall be built below 
street grade. The design of parking on sloping 
sites must be reviewed through the procedures of 
Section 309.1, according to the; following stan- 
dards: 

(i) For sloping sites with a grade change of 
at least ten feet laterally along the street, no less 
than 50 percent of the perimeter of all floors with 
off-street parking shall be below 7 the level of said 
sloping street; and 

(ii) For sites that slope upwards from a 
street, no less than 50 percent of the perimeter of 
all floors with off-street parking shall be below

Sec. 827. 



Pursuant to the procedures of Section 309.1, 
the Planning Commission may reduce the mini- 
mum on-site provision of required residential 
open space to not less than 18 square feet per 
unit in order to both create additional publicly 
accessible open space serving the district and to 
foster superior architectural design on con- 
strained sites. 

(B) Parking and Loading Access. 

(i) Width of openings. Any single develop- 
ment is limited to a total of two facade openings 
of no more than 11 feet wide each or one opening 
of no more than 22 feet wide for access to 
off-street parking and one facade opening of no 
more than 15 feet wide for access to off-street 
loading. Shared openings for parking and load- 
ing are encouraged. The maximum permitted 
width of a shared parking and loading garage 
opening is 27 feet. The maximum permitted 
width of all combined parking and loading open- 
ings on Guy Place and Lansing Street for any 
single project is 20 feet. 

(ii) Folsom Street. Access to off-street park- 
ing is not permitted on Folsom Street for lots 
with frontage on another street. For lots fronting 
solely on Folsom Street, access to parking on a 
Folsom Street frontage is permitted only through 
the processes established by Section 309.1 by 
demonstrating that every effort has been made 
to minimize negative impact on the pedestrian 
quality of the street. Loading may not be ac- 
cessed from Folsom Street. 

(iii) Sidewalk narrowings or porte cocheres 
to accommodate passenger loading and unload- 
ing are not permitted. For the purpose of this 
section, a &quot;porte cochere&quot; is defined as an off- 
street driveway, either covered or uncovered, for 
the purpose of passenger loading or unloading, 
situated between the ground floor facade of the 
building and the sidewalk. 

(e) Open Space. 

(1) Amount Required. 

(A) Residential. For all residential uses, 
75 square feet of open space is required per 
dwelling unit. All residential open space must 
meet the provisions described in Section 135 
unless otherwise established in this Section. 



Open space requirements may be met with the 
following types of open space: &quot;private usable 
open space&quot; as defined in Section 135(a) of this 
Code, &quot;common usable open space&quot; as defined in 
Section 135(a) of this Code, and &quot;publicly- 
accessible open space&quot; as defined in this Section. 
At least 40 percent of the residential open space 
is required to be common to all residential units. 
Common usable open space is not required to be 
publicly-accessible. Publicly-accessible open space, 
including off-site open space permitted by this 
Section, meeting the standards of this Section 
may be considered as common usable open space. 
For residential units with direct access from the 
street, building setback areas that meet the 
standards in Section 827(d)(4) may be counted 
toward the open space requirement as private 
non-common open space. 

(B) Non-residential. One square foot of 
publicly-accessible open space is required for 
every 50 gross square feet of non-residential uses 
over 10,000 square feet. All non-residential open 
space must meet the standards of Section 827 for 
publicly-accessible open space. 

(2) Off-site provision of required open 

space. The provision of off-site publicly-acces- 
sible open space may be counted toward the 
requirements of both residential and non-resi- 
dential open space provided it is within the RH 
DTR or within 500 feet of any boundary of the 
RH DTR District, and meets the standards of 
this Section. 

(A) At least 36 square feet per residential 
unit of required open space and 50 percent of 
required non-residential open space must be 
provided on-site. Pursuant to the procedures of 
Section 309.1, the Planning Commission may 
reduce the minimum on-site provision of re- 
quired residential open space to not less than 18 
square feet per unit in order to both create 
additional publicly-accessible open space serving 
the district and to foster superior architectural 
design on constrained sites. 

(B) Open Space Provider. The open space 
required by this Section may be provided indi- 
vidually by the project sponsor or jointly by the 
project sponsor and other project sponsors, pro- 



Sec. 827. 



San Francisco - Planning Code 



1208 



vided that each square foot of jointly developed 
open space may count toward only one sponsor&apos;s 
requirement. With the approval of the Planning 
Commission, a public or private agency may 
develop and maintain the open space, provided 
that (i) the project sponsor or sponsors pay for 
the cost of development of the number of square 
feet the project sponsor is required to provide, (ii) 
provision satisfactory to the Commission is made 
for the continued maintenance of the open space 
for the actual lifetime of the building giving rise 
to the open space requirement, and (hi) the 
Commission finds that there is reasonable assur- 
ance that the open space to be developed by such 
agency will be developed and open for use by the 
time the building, the open space requirement of 
which is being met by the payment, is ready for 
occupancy. 

(3) Publicly-Accessible Open Space Stan- 
dards. Any open space intended to fulfill the 
requirements of off-site or publicly-accessible 
open space required by this Section must meet 
the following standards and be approved by the 
Planning Commission according to the proce- 
dures of Section 309.1 of this Code. 

(A) Open space must be of one or more of 
the following types: 

(i) An unenclosed park or garden at street 
grade or following the natural topography, in- 
cluding improvements to hillsides or other unim- 
proved public areas according to the Rincon Hill 
Area Plan; 

(ii) An unenclosed plaza at street grade, 
with seating areas and landscaping and no more 
than 10 percent of the floor area devoted to food 
or beverage service; 

(iii) An unenclosed pedestrian pathway that 
meets the minimum standards described in Sec- 
tion 827(g)(3); 

(iv) A terrace or roof garden with landscap- 
ing; 

(v) Streetscape improvements with landscap- 
ing and pedestrian amenities that result in ad- 
ditional space beyond the pre-existing sidewalk 
width and conform to the Streetscape Plan of the 
Rincon Hill Area Plan, such as sidewalk widen- 
ing or building setbacks, other than those ground 



floor setbacks required by Section 827(d)(4) or 
intended by design for the use of individual 
ground floor residential units; and 

(vi) Streetscape improvements with land- 
scaping and pedestrian amenities on Guy Place 
and Lansing Street, beyond basic street tree 
planting or street lighting as otherwise required 
by this Code, in accordance with the Streetscape 
Plan of the Rincon Hill Area Plan. 

(B) Open space must meet the following 
standards: 

(i) Be in such locations and provide such 
ingress and egress as will make the area conve- 
nient, safe, secure and easily accessible to the 
general public; 

(ii) Be appropriately landscaped; 

(iii) Be protected from uncomfortable winds; 

(iv) Incorporate ample seating and, if appro- 
priate, access to limited amounts of food and 
beverage service, which will enhance public use 
of the area; 

(v) Be well signed and accessible to the 
public during daylight hours; 

(vi) Be well lighted if the area is of the; type 
requiring artificial illumination; 

(vii) Be designed to enhance user safety and 
security; 

(viii) Be of sufficient size to be attractive 
and practical for its intended use; and 

(ix) Have access to drinking water and toi- 
lets if feasible. 

(C) Maintenance. Open spaces shall be 
maintained at no public expense, except as might 
be provided for by any community facilities dis- 
trict that may be formed in the RH DTR. The 
owner of the property on which the open space is 
located shall maintain it by keeping the area 
clean and free of litter and keeping in a healthy 
state any plant material that is provided. Con- 
ditions intended to assure continued mainte- 
nance of the open space for the actual lifetime of 
the building giving rise to the open space require- 
ment may be imposed in accordance with the 
provisions of Section 309.1.

Mixed Use Districts 



Sec. 827. 



• 



(D) Informational Plaque. Prior to issu- 
ance of a permit of occupancy, a plaque of no less 
than 24 inches by 36 inches in size shall be 
placed in a publicly conspicuous location outside 
the building at street level, or at the site of any 
publicly-accessible open space, identifying said 
open space feature and its location, stating the 
right of the public to use the space and the hours 
of use, describing its principal required features 
(e.g., number of seats, availability of food ser- 
vice) and stating the name and address of the 
owner or owner&apos;s agent responsible for mainte- 
nance. 

(E) The Zoning Administrator shall have 
authority to require a property owner to hold 
harmless the City and County of San Francisco, 
its officers, agents and employees, from any 
damage or injury caused by the design, construc- 
tion or maintenance of open space, and to require 
the owner or owners or subsequent owner or 
owners of the property to be solely liable for any 
damage or loss occasioned by any act or neglect 
in respect to the design, construction or mainte- 
nance of the open space. 

(f) Reduction of Ground Level Wind Cur- 
rents. 

(1) Requirement. New buildings and addi- 
tions to existing buildings shall be shaped, or 
other wind-baffling measures shall be adopted, 
so that the developments will not cause ground- 
level wind currents to exceed, more than 10 
percent of the time year-round, between 7:00 
a.m. and 6:00 p.m., the comfort level of 11 m.p.h. 
equivalent wind speed in areas of substantial 
pedestrian use and seven m.p.h. equivalent wind 
speed in public seating areas. The term &quot;equiva- 
lent wind speed&quot; shall mean an hourly mean 
wind speed adjusted to incorporate the effects of 
gustiness or turbulence on pedestrians. 

(2) When preexisting ambient wind speeds 
exceed the comfort level, or when a proposed 
building or addition may cause ambient wind 
speeds to exceed the comfort level, the building 
shall be designed to reduce the ambient wind 
speeds to meet the requirements. 



(3) Exception. The Zoning Administrator 
may allow the building or addition to add to the 
amount of time the comfort level is exceeded by 
the least practical amount if (i) it can be shown 
that a building or addition cannot be shaped and 
other wind-baffling measures cannot be adopted 
to meet the foregoing requirements without cre- 
ating an unattractive and ungainly building form 
and without unduly restricting the development 
potential of the building site in question, and (ii) 
the Zoning Administrator concludes that, be- 
cause of the limited amount by which the comfort 
level is exceeded, the addition is insubstantial. 

The Zoning Administrator shall not grant an 
exception, and, no building or addition shall be 
permitted that causes equivalent winds speeds 
to reach or exceed the hazard level of 26 miles 
per hour for a single hour of the year. 

(g) Streetscape Standards. 
(1) Sidewalk Treatments. 

(A) For all frontages abutting a public side- 
walk, the project sponsor is required to install 
sidewalk widening, street trees, lighting, decora- 
tive paving, seating and landscaping in accor- 
dance with the Streetscape Plan of the Rincon 
Hill Area Plan, developed by the Planning De- 
partment and approved by the Board of Super- 
visors. 

(B) Prior to approval by the Board of Super- 
visors of a Streetscape Plan for Rincon Hill, the 
Planning Commission, through the procedures of 
Section 309.1, shall require an applicant to in- 
stall sidewalk widening, street trees, lighting, 
decorative paving, seating, and landscaping in 
keeping with the intent of the Rincon Hill Area 
Plan of the General Plan and in accordance with 
subsections (C) — (F) below. 

(C) Sidewalk treatments shall comply with 
any applicable ordinances and with any appli- 
cable regulation of the Art Commission, the 
Department of Public Works and the Bureau of 
Light, Heat and Power of the Public Utility 
Commission regarding street lighting, sidewalk 
paving, and sidewalk landscaping. 

(D) The Streetscape Plan and any Commis- 
sion requirement pursuant to subsection (B) shall 
require the abutting property owner or owners to

for each tree is connected. 

(3) Mid-Block Pedestrian Pathways. For 

developments on Assessor&apos;s Blocks 3744 — 3748, 
the Commission may require, pursuant to Sec- 
tion 309.1, the applicant to provide a mid-block

SEC. 828. TRANSBAY DOWNTOWN 
RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT (TB-DTR). 

The Transbay Downtown Residential Dis- 
trict, which is wholly within the Transbay Rede- 
velopment Project Area, comprises mostly pub- 
licly owned parcels containing infrastructure or 
underutilized land related to the Transbay Ter- 
minal and former Embarcadero Freeway. This 
district generally extends along the north side of 
Folsom Street from Spear to Essex Streets, and 
between Main and Beale Streets to the north 
side of Howard Street. Laid out in the Transbay 
Redevelopment Plan and its companion docu- 
ments, including the Design for the Development 
and the Development Controls and Design Guide- 
lines for the Transbay Redevelopment Project, is 
the comprehensive vision for this underutilized 
area as a high-density, predominantly residen- 
tial, district within walking distance of the down- 
town core, transit facilities, and the waterfront. 
The plan for the district includes: a mix of 



widely-spaced high-rises, mixed with a street- 
defining base of low- and mid-rise buildings with 
ground floor townhouses; a public open space on 
part of the block bounded by Folsom, Beale, 
Howard, and Main Streets; ground-floor retail 
along Folsom Street; and several new alleyways 
to break up the size of the blocks. 

(a) Basic Controls. Development controls 
for this district are established in the Transbay 
Redevelopment Plan as approved by the Plan- 
ning Commission on December 9, 2004, and 
January 13, 2005, specifically the Development 
Controls and Design Guidelines for the Transbay 
Redevelopment Project. On matters to which 
these Redevelopment documents are silent, con- 
trols in this Code pertaining to the C-3-0 District 
shall apply. (Added by Ord. 94-06, File No. 050182,

SEC. 890.68. NEIGHBORHOOD-SERVING 
BUSINESS. 

A neighborhood-serving business cannot be 
defined by the type of use, but rather by the 
characteristics of its customers, types of merchan- 
dise or service, its size, trade area, and the 
number of similar establishments in other neigh- 
borhoods. The primary clientele of a &quot;neighbor- 
hood-serving business,&quot; by definition, is com- 
prised of customers who live and/or work nearby. 

While a neighborhood-serving business may 
derive revenue from customers outside the im- 
mediately surrounding neighborhood, it is not 
dependent on out-of-neighborhood clientele. 

A neighborhood-serving use provides goods 
and/or services which are needed by residents 
and workers in the immediate neighborhood to 
satisfy basic personal and household needs on a 
frequent and recurring basis, and which if not 
available require trips outside of the neighbor- 
hood. 

A use may be more or less neighborhood- 
serving depending upon its trade area. Uses 
which, due to the nature of their products and 
services, tend to be more neighborhood-serving, 
are those which sell convenience items such as 
groceries, personal toiletries, magazines, and 
personal services such as cleaners, laundromats, 
and film processing. Uses which tend to be less 
neighborhood-oriented are those which sell more 
specialized, more expensive, less frequently pur- 
chased comparison goods such as automobiles 
and furniture. 

For many uses (such as stores selling ap- 
parel, household goods, and variety merchan- 
dise), whether a business is neighborhood- 
serving depends on the size of the establishment: 
The larger the use, the larger the trade area, 
hence the less neighborhood-oriented. 

Whether a business is neighborhood-serving 
or not also depends in part on the number and 
availability of other similar establishments in 
other neighborhoods: the more widespread the 
use, the more likely that it is neighborhood- 
oriented. (Added by Ord. 131-87, App. 4/24/87)

Districts are either principal, conditional, acces- 
sory, or temporary as provided below. 

(1) Principal Uses. Principal uses are per- 
mitted as of right in a Mission Bay Use District, 
when so indicated in Sections 906 through 916 
for each district class. 

(2 ) Conditional Uses. Conditional uses are 
permitted when a use is indicated as conditional 
in Sections 906 through 916 for each district 
class and is authorized by the City Planning 
Commission pursuant to the provisions of Sec- 
tion 303. Certain rules applicable to conditional 
3 uses are contained in Section 984. 

(3) Accessory Uses. A related minor use 
which is either necessary to the operation or 
enjoyment of a lawful principal use or condi- 
tional use or is appropriate, incidental and sub- 
ordinate to any such use is permitted, subject to 
the limitations contained in Section 986, as an 
accessory use when located on the same lot. 

(4) Temporary Uses. Uses not otherwise 
permitted are permitted as temporary uses to 
the extent authorized by Section 985. 

(5) Multiple Permitted Uses in a Struc- 
ture. If there are two or more uses in a structure 
and none is classified as accessory, then each of 
these uses will be considered separately as inde- 
pendent principal, conditional, or temporary uses. 

(6) Enclosure of Permitted Uses. All per- 
mitted uses shall be conducted within an en- 
closed building, unless otherwise specifically al- 
lowed in this Code. Exceptions from this 
requirement are: uses which, when located out- 
side of a building, qualify as an outdoor activity 
area, as defined in Section 790.70; uses which by 
their nature are to be conducted in an open lot or 
outside a building, as described in Sections 790 
through 790.140; and temporary uses as pro- 
vided in Section 985. 

(b) Uses Not Permitted.

916 for each district class, and are not permitted 



accessory or authorized temporary uses, unless 
determined by the Zoning Administrator to be 
permitted uses in accordance with Section 307(a), 
are not permitted. 

(2) Nuisances. No use, even though listed 
as a permitted use or otherwise allowed, shall be 
permitted if by reason of its nature or manner of 
operation, it creates conditions that are hazard- 
ous, noxious, or offensive through the emission of 
odor, fumes, smoke, cinders, dust, gas, vibration, 
glare, refuse, water-carried waste, or excessive 
noise. 

(3 ) Certain Non-Permitted Uses All owed 
to Remain. Certain non-permitted uses may be 
permitted to remain as non-conforming uses 
subject to the provisions of Section 983. 

(c) Compliance of Uses with Controls. 
All uses, buildings and features shall comply 
with all controls set forth for the district in which 
they are located. Where different controls con- 
flict or overlap within the same use district, the

restrictive of all controls. (Added by Ord. 63-91,

(b) Assignment of Densities to Lots as 
Development Blocks are Subdivided. As each 
development block is subdivided and re-subdi- 
vided from time to time pursuant to the provi- 
sions of the Subdivision Code it shall be estab- 
lished to the satisfaction of the Zoning 
Administrator that the number of dwelling units 
to be assigned to each lot in the subdivision can 
be accommodated in a building or buildings 
which conform to the applicable building stan- 
dards of the district and the design guidelines of 
the Mission Bay Plan, 

(c) Transfer and Increase of Residen- 
tial Densities. 

(1) Transfer. The number of dwelling units 
on a specific development block, as defined in 
Section 996&lt;b)( 1), may be up to 10 percent greater 
or less than the number specified in Table 920 
provided that the greater or lesser number of 
units is compensated for by an equal decrease or 
increase in units in another development block 
or blocks. When more than one development 
block or lot are aggregated to form a single 
development project, as defined in Section 
996flb)(T0), the number of dwelling units as- 
signed to particular blocks or lots may vary by 
more than 10 percent from the numbers listed in 
Table 920 provided that the total number of 
dwelling units in the single development project 
equals the total of the numbers specified for all 
the blocks and lots in the single development 
project. 

(2) Increase. The total number of dwelling 
units initially authorized in Table 920 for Afford- 
able Housing Development Blocks may be in- 
creased by 366 units, and for all other develop- 
ment blocks by 268 units, pursuant to the 
procedures set forth in Subsection (d)(1) below. 
The term &quot;Affordable Housing Development 
Blocks&quot; refers to those development blocks listed 
in Table 920 which contain the letter &quot;A&quot; in the 
block number. 

(d) Limitations on Transfer of Densi- 
ties. The following limitations on the transfer of 
density shall apply: 

(1) As a condition of approval of a transfer 
of dwelling units or an increase in the number of 
dwelling units in any development block or lot, it 



shall be established to the satisfaction of the 
Zoning Administrator that the increased number 
of units can be accommodated in a building or 
buildings on the block or lot which conform to the 
applicable building standards of this Article and 
the design guidelines of the Mission Bay Plan 
and that the guidelines on unit size can be met. 
(2) The Zoning Administrator may deny any 
request for a transfer of density if, at the time of 
the request, the total number of dwelling units 
constructed or under construction on all blocks 
or lots on which density has been increased or 
decreased, as provided in Subsection (c) above, is 
200 units less than the total number of units 
initially authorized in Table 920, for all blocks or 
lots on which the density has been increased or 
decreased. 

(e) Recording Transfers of Density. As 

the number of dwelling units permitted and 
required on each development block is modified 
from time to time, as permitted in this Section, a 
new table, to be titled &quot;Table 920-R, Residential 
Density Table with Density Transfers,&quot; shall be 
prepared to reflect the modifications. A revised 
table shall be submitted as part of the request for 
density transfer, approved by the Zoning Admin- 
istrator as part of the transfer approval, and 
published in a form suitable for insertion in the 
Planning Code. (Added by Ord. 63-91, App. 2/27/ 
91; amended by Ord. 248-97, App. 6/18/97)

property line of the lot, or, in the case of a corner 
lot, from the two front property lines, except as 
provided in Subsection (d). 

(b) MB-NC-3 District. The occupied floor 
area of nonresidential uses permitted by Section 
910 on the first and second story of buildings on 
lots in the MB-NC-3 District shall be limited to 
the area of the first and second stories to a depth 
of 80 feet from the front property line of the lot, 
or, in the case of a corner lot, from the front two 
property lines, except as provided in Subsection 
(d). 

(c) MB-CN-S Districts. The gross floor area 
of nonresidential uses permitted by Section 911 
in the MB-CN-S Districts shall be limited as

(d) In Development Blocks 27A, 33A and 
50A, additional occupied floor area shall be per- 
mitted for non-profit live-work, child care, cul- 
tural, educational, health, recreational or social 
service facilities to the extent that the additional 
floor area will be accommodated in a building or 
buildings which conform to the applicable build- 
ing standards of the district and the design 
guidelines of the Mission Bay Plan. The facilities 
may be located above the first story provided 
that the number of units specified by Section 
920, or as modified pursuant to the provisions of 
Section 920, will also be provided. Provision of 
these facilities shall not preclude open space 
amenities on these sites. (Added by Ord. 63-91, 
App. 2/27/91) 

SEC. 923. DENSITY OF USES IN M B-O

(a) Gross Floor Area Permitted. The den- 
sity of all uses permitted m the MB-0 District by 
Section 912 and in the MB-CI District by Section 
913 shall be limited to a gross floor area which is 
equal to a floor area ratio of 4.5 to 1 in the MB-0 
District and 3.0 to 1 in the MB-CI District 
applied to a lot area which excludes the area 
occupied by a midblock lane required by the 
Mission Bay Plan. 



(b) Exclusions from Gross Floor Area. 

The term &quot;gross floor area&quot; is defined in Section 
102.9. In addition to the exclusions from gross 
floor area provided in Section 102.9(b)(1) through 
(10), the following exclusions shall apply in the 
MB-0 and MB-CI Districts: 

1. An interior space provided as an open

(1) one or more arts activities as defined in 
Section 102.2 are the primary nonresidential use 
and that other nonresidential activities are lim- 
ited to those otherwise permitted in the district 
or otherwise conditional in the district and spe- 
cifically approved as a conditional use; and (2) 
the provisions of Section 940(b) are satisfied. 

(c) Transfer of Permitted Gross Floor 
Area. In order to accommodate the creation of a 
smaller number of accessory parking structures 
serving more than one building and to facilitate 
building articulation, as provided in the Mission 
Bay Plan, the permitted gross floor area for any 
building or development on a lot in the MB-0

windows contained in Section 136 are modified 
as follows: 

( 1 ) In addition to other bay windows permit- 
ted by Section 136, the Zoning Administrator 
may allow a bay window of any shape which is 
determined to enhance the visual appearance of 
the structure provided that: 

(A) The total area of the horizontal projec- 
tion of whatever height does not exceed 45 square 
feet for each increment of 25 feet of lot width; 

(B) The projection into the required open 
area does not exceed three feet in depth and is no 
closer than eight feet to the centerline of any 
midblock lane, and 

(C) There is a horizontal separation be- 
tween bay windows of at least four feet. 

(2) In addition to other permitted corner 
bay windows permitted by Section 136, the Zon- 
ing Administrator may allow a corner bay win- 
dow of any shape which is determined to en- 
hance the visual appearance of the structure 
provided that: 

(A) The bay at each line establishing the 
required open area is no greater than 15 feet in 
width; 



(B) The total area of the horizontal projec- 
tion of whatever height does not exceed 90 square 
feet; 

(C) There is a horizontal separation be- 
tween the corner bay and other bays of at least 
four feet; and

area does not exceed three feet span and is no 
closer than eight feet to the center line of any 
midblock lane. 

(3) Cornices at the top of bays, projecting no 
more than the permitted projection of the bays, 
which link two rows of bay windows to establish 
a + 25 foot building articulation are permitted. 

(c) Obstructions by Minor Architec- 
tural Features. Within the area of minimum 
vertical clearance required by Section 136 for 
obstructions over usable open space, horizontal 
projections, not to exceed six inches, of a purely 
architectural or decorative character, such as

skylights, and antennae for transmission, recep- 
tion, or relay of radio, television, or other elec- 
tronic signals when a permitted use in the dis- 
trict shall be enclosed and screened: (i) in such a 
manner that the enclosure is designed as a 
logical extension of the building form and an 
integral part of the overall building design; and 
its cladding and detailing is comparable to that 
of the rest of the building; or (ii) by a rooftop form 
which is appropriate to the nature and propor- 
tions of the building, and is designed to obscure 
the rooftop equipment and appurtenances smd to 
provide a more balanced and graceful silhouette 
for the top of the building. Minor features, not

Perimeter Dwelling None 

Units 

For group housing structures, the minimum 
amount of usable open space provided for use by 
each bedroom shall be V3 the amount required 
for a dwelling unit as specified above. For pur- 
poses of these calculations, the number of bed- 



rooms shall in no case be considered to be less 
than one bedroom for each two beds. Where the 
actual number of beds exceeds an average of two 
beds for each bedroom, each two beds shall be 
considered equivalent to one bedroom. 

(b) Character of Open Space Provided. 

Usable open space shall be composed of an out- 
door area or areas designed for outdoor living, 
recreation or landscaping, including such areas 
on the ground and on decks, balconies, porches 
and roofs, which are safe and suitably surfaced 
and screened, and which conform to the other 
requirements of this Section. Such area or areas 
shall be on the same lot as the dwelling units (or 
bedrooms in group housing) they serve, except as 
provided in (f)3 below, and shall be designed and 
oriented in a manner that will make the; best 
practical use of available sun and other climatic 
advantages. &quot;Private usable open space&quot; shall 
mean an area or areas private to and designed 
for use by only one dwelling unit (or bedroom in 
group housing). &quot;Common usable open space&quot; 
shall mean an area or areas designed for use 
jointly by two or more dwelling units (or bed- 
rooms in group housing). The slope of any area 
credited as either private or common usable open 
space shall not exceed five percent. 

(c) Access to Open Space. Usable open 
space shall be as close as is practical to the 
dwelling unit (or bedroom in group housing) for 
which it is required, and shall be accessible from 
such dwelling unit or bedroom as follows: 

1. Private usable open space shall be direct 
and immediately accessible from such dwelling 
unit or bedroom, and shall be either on the same 
floor level as such dwelling unit or bedroom, with 
no more than one story above or below much 
floor level with convenient private access. 

2. Common usable open space shall be eas- 
ily and independently accessible from such dwell- 
ing unit or bedroom, or from another common 
area of the building or lot. 

(d) Permitted Obstructions Over Open 
Space. The obstructions listed in Section 136 for 
usable open space shall be permitted over pri- 
vate or common usable open space. 



1305 



Mission Bay Districts 



Sec. 952. 



(e) Additional Standards for Private Us- 
able Open Space. 

1. Minimum Dimensions and Minimum 
Area. Any space credited as private usable open 
space shall have a minimum horizontal dimen- 
sion of six feet and a minimum area of 36 square 
feet if located on a deck, balcony, porch or roof, 
and shall have a minimum horizontal dimension 
of 10 feet and a minimum area of 100 square feet 
if located on open ground, a terrace, or the 
surface of an inner or outer court. 

2. Exposure. In order to be credited as 
private usable open space, an area must be kept 
open in the following manner: 

(A) For decks, balconies, porches and roofs, 
at least 30 percent of the perimeter must be 
unobstructed except for necessary railings. 

(B) In addition, the area credited on a deck, 
balcony, porch or roof must either face a street, 
face or be within a rear yard, or face or be within 
some other space which, at the level of the 
private usable open space, meets the minimum 
dimension and area requirements for common 
usable open space as specified in Paragraph 
951(f)(1) below. 

(C) Areas within inner and outer courts, as 
defined by Section 102.4, must either conform to 
the standards of Subparagraph (f)2(B) above or 
be so arranged that the height of the walls and 
projections above the court on at least three sides 
(or 75 percent of the perimeter, whichever is 
greater) is such that no point on any such wall or 
projection is higher than one foot for each foot 
that such point is horizontally distant from the 
opposite side of the clear space in the court, 
regardless of the permitted obstruction referred 
to in Subsection (d) above. 

3. Fire Escapes as Usable Open Space. 

Normal fire escape grating shall not be consid- 
ered suitable surfacing for usable open space. 
The steps of a fire escape stairway or ladder, and 
any space less than six feet deep between such 
steps and a wall of the building, shall not be 
credited as usable open space. But the mere 
potential use of a balcony area for an emergency 
fire exit by occupants of other dwelling units (or 



bedrooms in group housing) shall not prevent it 
from being credited as usable open space on 
grounds of lack of privacy or usability. 

4. Use of Solariums. The area of a totally 
or partially enclosed solarium shall be credited 
as private usable open space if (i) such area is 
open to the outdoors through openings or clear 
glazing on not less than 50 percent of its perim- 
eter and (ii) not less than 30 percent of its 
overhead area and 25 percent of its perimeter 
are open or can be opened to the air. 

(f) Additional Standards for Common 
Usable Open Space. 

1. Minimum Dimensions and Minimum 
Area. Any space credited as common usable 
open space shall be at least 15 feet in every 
horizontal dimension and shall have a minimum

PART VIII 
SIGNS 

SEC. 970. SIGNS: GENERAL 
PROVISIONS. 

(a) Purposes. These sections 970 through 
973 are adopted in recognition of the important 
function of signs and of the need for their regu- 
lation in Mission Bay Use Districts under the 
Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance of the City 
and County. In addition to those purposes of the 
City Planning Code stated in Section 101, it is 
the further purpose of these provisions to safe- 
guard and enhance property values in residen- 
tial, commercial and industrial areas; to protect 
public investment in and the character and dig- 
nity of public buildings, open spaces and thor- 
oughfares; to protect the distinctive appearance 
of San Francisco which is produced by its unique 
geography, topography, street patterns, skyline 
and architectural features; to provide a physical 
environment which will promote the develop- 
ment of business; to encourage sound practices 
and lessen the objectionable effects of competi- 
tion in the size and placement of signs; to mini- 
mize the impact of signs which are essential to 
the economic vitality of commercial districts on 
the livability of residential units in or adjacent 
commercial districts; to enhance the visual envi- 
ronment by relating the type, quality and size of 
signs to the scale and character of the districts in 
which they are located; to reduce hazards to 
motorists and pedestrians traveling on the pub- 
lic way; and thereby to promote the public health, 
safety and welfare.

Code shall apply to the same terms used in 
Section 971 through 973.

harmony with the public purposes of the prop- 
erty and with the surrounding area, and the 
restrictions of this Code for signs in other dis- 
tricts. No general advertising sign shall be per- 
mitted. (Added by Ord. 63-91, App. 2/27/91)

on the wall to which the sign is attached. 

(ii) Such signs are a minimum of 200 feet 
apart. 

(iii) The sign is distinctive and attractive in 
its design and use of materials and will make an 
important contribution to the visual quality and 
character of the street. 

(iv) To the maximum extent practicable given 
the specific uses on the street frontage, the sign 
identifies major destination points or places of 
public assembly such as theaters and cultural 
centers or public or quasi-public facilities such as 
parking garages. 

(v) The sign identifies the name of the busi- 
ness, service or other activity offered or con- 
ducted on premises or the generic type of com- 
modities sold on the premises, rather than the 
specific brand names or symbol of commodities 
sold on premises. (Added by Ord. 63-91, App.

PART XII RULES FOR 

NONCONFORMING 

USES AND NONCOMPLYING 

STRUCTURES AND 

CONDITIONAL, TEMPORARY 

AND ACCESSORY USES 

SEC. 983. RULES REGARDING 
NONCONFORMING USES AND 
NONCOMPLYING STRUCTURES. 

(a) General. The provisions of Section 180 
apply to nonconforming uses and noncomplying 
structures in Mission Bay Use Districts which 
uses or structures existed lawfully at the effec- 
tive date of the adoption of this Article 9, but 
which fail to conform to the regulations of this 
Article 9. 

(b) Enlargements, Alterations and Re- 
constructions. In the Mission Bay Use Dis- 
tricts, a nonconforming use, and any structure 
occupied by such use, shall not be significantly 
enlarged, intensified, extended, or moved to an- 
other location, unless the result will be the 
elimination of the nonconforming use, except as 
provided in this Section 983(b). A nonconforming 
use, and any structure occupied by such use may 
be significantly enlarged, intensified, extended 
or expanded, provided that such enlargement, 
intensification, extension or expansion is ap- 
proved by the Zoning Administrator under the 
procedures for notice and hearing applicable to 
variances as set forth in Section 305, including 
notice to the owner of the fee title to the affected 
property, upon a determination that such enlarge- 
ment, intensification, extension or expansion is 
consistent with the implementation provisions of 
the Mission Bay Plan and will not impede the 
orderly development of Mission Bay as contem- 
plated in the Mission Bay Plan and the Mission 
Bay Development Agreement. Any such enlarge- 
ment, intensification, extension or expansion shall 
not exceed 25 feet in height and shall comply 
with requirements that would apply if the use in 
question was located within an M-l Use District. 
Notwithstanding any such enlargement, intensi- 
fication, extension or expansion, the provisions 
of Section 983(e) shall continue to apply to such 
nonconforming use, or structure occupied by 



Sec. 983. 



San Francisco - Planning Code 



1316 



such use, including such enlargement, intensifi- 
cation, extension or expansion. In addition, the 
provisions of Section 181(b) and (d) and Section 
188 shall apply in Mission Bay Use Districts; 
provided, however, that, notwithstanding any 
restoration pursuant to Section 181(d), the pro- 
visions of Section 983(e) shall continue to apply. 

(c) Changes of Use. The provisions of Sec- 
tion 182(a) and (b) shall apply in Mission Bay 
Use Districts, provided that, notwithstanding 
any change in use permitted under Section 182(b), 
the provisions of Section 983(e) shall continue to 
apply. 

(d) Discontinuance and Abatement. The 

provisions of Section 183 shall apply in Mission 
Bay Use Districts. 

(e) Termination. Nonconforming uses in 
Mission Bay Use Districts shall be terminated as 
provided in this Subsection. 

(1) Purpose. The purpose of this Subsec- 
tion is to provide for the gradual elimination or 
conversion, after a reasonable allowance of time 
for the amortization of investments therein, of 
nonconforming uses in buildings and nonconform- 
ing uses of land in order to encourage and 
promote the orderly and beneficial development 
of the land and buildings with conforming uses. 
This subsection is intended to apply to land and 
buildings whose use is at variance with the 
regulations of this Article, and is safeguarded 
against unnecessary hardship in application by 
provision for continuance for a minimum period 
of 10 years, by procedures for extension and by 
the requirement of notice. It is further declared 
that the requirement of eventual removal, or 
conversion to conforming use, of such buildings 
and land subject to the exceptions set forth, is in 
the public interest and is intended to promote 
the general welfare. 

(2) Application. This subsection shall ap- 
ply to nonconforming uses occupying buildings 
and to non-conforming uses of land whether or 
not an enclosed building located on the same lot 
is involved in such use, when such uses would 
not be permitted as a principal or conditional use 
in the Mission Bay Use District in which the use 
is located. 



(3) Amortization Period. Every such build- 
ing and use to which this Section applies may be 
continued in such use for at least 10 years; from 
the effective date of this Section, and for fully 
enclosed warehouse buildings east of Third Street 
such use may continue for an additional period of 
at least 25 years after the expiration of the initial 
10-year period, and in either case for such addi- 
tional periods as may be permitted by an exten- 
sion or extensions granted pursuant to Subsec- 
tion (e)(4) below. 

(4) Extensions. An extension of time may 
be granted, in accordance with the procedures 
for notice and hearing applicable to variances as 
provided in Section 305, including notice to the 
owner of the fee title to the affected property if 
the Zoning Administrator determines that either 
(i) special circumstances apply to any such build- 
ing or use which do not apply generally to other 
affected buildings and uses or (ii) an extension 
will not impede the orderly development of Mis- 
sion Bay as contemplated in the Mission Bay 
Plan and Mission Bay Development Agreement. 
In considering an application for extension of an 
industrial use served by a rail freight spur track, 
consideration shall be given to the necessity for 
granting an extension of such rail freight spur 
track use. No extension shall be for a period in 
excess of two years. Successive extensions., sub- 
ject to the same limitations, may be granted 
upon new application. 

(5) Removal or Alteration and Conver- 
sion. Upon the expiration of the amortization 
period and any extension or extensions granted 
pursuant to Subsection (e)(4), the use or build- 
ings shall be completely removed or altered and 
converted to a conforming use provided, how- 
ever, that if the termination of the use of any 
Public Transportation Facility requires the ap- 
proval of any State or federal commission, or 
agency under any applicable State or federal law 
or regulation, the nonconforming use of such 
facility may continue until all such required 
approvals have been obtained. Nothing herein 
shall require the development of the minimum 
number of dwelling units required under Section 
920, until such time as a parcel is developed in 
accordance with this Article 9.

trator not to exceed 10 years, upon the determi-

tural styles of the past or are landmarks in the 
history of architecture, or which are unique and 
irreplaceable assets to the City and its neighbor- 
hoods, or which provide for this and future 
generations examples of the physical surround- 
ings in which past generations lived; 

(b) The development and maintenance of 
appropriate settings and environment for such 
structures, and in such sites and areas; 

(c) The enhancement of property values, 
the stabilization of neighborhoods and areas of 
the City, the increase of economic and financial 
benefits to the City and its inhabitants, and the 
promotion of tourist trade and interest; 

(d) The preservation and encouragement of 
a City of varied architectural styles, reflecting 
the distinct phases of its history: cultural, social, 
economic, political and architectural and 

(e) The enrichment of human life in its 
educational and cultural dimensions in order to 
serve spiritual as well as material needs, by 
fostering knowledge of the living heritage of the 
past. (Added by Ord. 27-67, App. 1/26/67)

SEC. 1004. DESIGNATION OF 
LANDMARKS AND HISTORIC 
DISTRICTS. 

(a) Pursuant to the procedures set forth 
hereinafter: 

(1) The Board of Supervisors may, by ordi- 
nance, designate an individual structure or other 
feature or an integrated group of structures and 



features on a single lot or site, having a special 
character or special historical, architectural or 
aesthetic interest or value, as a landmark, and 
shall designate a landmark site for each land- 
mark; and 

(2) The Board of Supervisors may, by ordi- 
nance, designate an area containing a number of 
structures having a special character or special 
historical, architectural or aesthetic interest or 
value, and constituting a distinct section of the 
City, as a historic district. 

(b) Each such designating ordinance shall 
include, or shall incorporate by reference to the 
pertinent resolution of the Planning Commission 
then on file with the Clerk of the Board of 
Supervisors, as though fully set forth in such 
designating ordinance, the location and bound- 
aries of the landmark site or historic district, a 
description of the characteristics of the land- 
mark or historic district that justify its designa- 
tion, and a description of the particular features 
that should be preserved. Any such designation 
shall be in furtherance of and in conformance 
with the purposes of this Article 10 and the 
standards set forth herein. 

(c) The property included in any such des- 
ignation shall upon designation be subject to the 
controls and standards set forth in this Article 
10. In addition, the said property shall be subject 
to the following further controls and standards if 
imposed by the designating ordinance: 

(1) For a publicly-owned landmark, review 
of proposed changes to significant interior archi- 
tectural features. 

(2) For a privately-owned landmark, review 
of proposed changes requiring a permit to signifi- 
cant interior architectural features in those ar- 
eas of the landmark that are or historically have 
been accessible to members of the public. The 
designating ordinance must clearly describe each 
significant interior architectural feature subject 
to this restriction. 

(3) For a historic district, such further con- 
trols and standards as the Board of Supervisors 
deems necessary or desirable, including but not

as identified in the designating ordinance. 

(d) The Board of Supervisors may amend or 
rescind a designation at any time, subject to all 
of the procedures set forth in this Article 10 for 
an original designation; provided, however, that 
in the event that a landmark is accidentally 
destroyed or is demolished or removed in confor- 
mity with the provisions of Section 1007, or is 
legally demolished or relocated after compliance 
has been had with the provisions of Section 
1006.2, the Director of Planning may request the 
Planning Commission to recommend to the Board 
of Supervisors that the designation be amended 
or rescinded, and in such case the procedures for 
an original designation set forth in Sections 
1004.1, 1004.2 and 1004.3 hereof shall not apply. 
(Amended Ord. 112-71, App. 5/7/71; Ord. 327-99, 
File No. 991871, App. 12/23/99; Ord. 82-07, File 
No. 070021, App. 4/20/2007) 

SEC. 1004.1. INITIATION OF 
DESIGNATION. 

Initiation of designation shall be by the Board 
of Supervisors or by a resolution of intention by 
the Planning Commission, the Art Commission 
or the Advisory Board, or on the verified appli- 
cation of owners of the property to be designated 
or their authorized agents. Any such application 
shall be filed with the Department upon forms 
prescribed by the Planning Commission, and 
shall be accompanied by all data required by the 
Planning Commission. Where such an applica- 
tion is submitted for designation of a historic 
district, the application must be subscribed by or 
on behalf of at least 66 percent of the property 
owners in the proposed district. (Added Ord. 
27-67, App. 1/26/67) 

SEC. 1004.2. REFERRAL TO 
LANDMARKS PRESERVATION ADVISORY 
BOARD. 

The proposed designation, resolution or ap- 
plication shall be promptly referred to the Advi- 
sory Board for review and report to the Planning 
Commission as to conformance with the pur- 
poses and standards of this Article 10. The 



Advisory Board shall recommend approval., dis- 
approval or modification of the proposal, or shall 
report its failure to reach a decision thereon, 
within 60 days after such referral. If no recom- 
mendation is rendered within 60 days, the Plan- 
ning Commission may consider the proposed 
designation as provided in Section 1004.3 below 
notwithstanding the lack of such a recommenda- 
tion. (Added Ord. 27-67, App. 1/26/67; Ord. 26- 
07, File No. 061068, App. 2/9/2007) 

SEC. 1004.3. HEARING BY CITY 
PLANNING COMMISSION. 

After receiving a report from the Advisory 
Board or after the expiration of 60 days from the 
date of referral to the Advisory Board, whichever 
is sooner, the Planning Commission shall hold a 
public hearing on the proposal; the Department 
shall set a time and place for such hearing. A 
record of pertinent information presented at the 
hearing shall be made and maintained as a 
permanent record. 

(a) Notice of Hearing. Notice of the time, 
place and purpose of such hearing shall be .^iven

date of hearing to the owners of all property 
included in the proposed designation, using for 
this purpose the names and addresses of the last 
known owners as shown on the records of the 
Assessor. Failure to send notice by mail to any 
such property owner where the address of such 
owner is not a matter of public record shaH not 
invalidate any proceedings in connection with 
the proposed designation. The Department may 
also give such other notice as it may deem 
desirable and practicable. 

(b) Time Limitation. The Planning Com- 
mission shall consider the report and recommen- 
dation of the Advisory Board, if any, and shall 
consider the conformance or lack of conformance 
of the proposed designation with the purposes 
and standards of this Article 10. The Planning 
Commission shall hold a public hearing and 
shall approve, disapprove or modify the pro posal 
within 90 days from the date of referral of the

proposed designation to the Advisory Board. Fail- 
ure to act within said time shall constitute 
approval. The Board of Supervisors may, by 
resolution, extend the time within which the 
Planning Commission is to render its decision. 

(c) Notice of Action Taken. The Planning 
Commission shall promptly notify the applicant 
of action taken. If the Planning Commission 
approves or modifies the proposed designation in 
whole or in part, it shall transmit the proposal 
together with a copy of the resolution of ap- 
proval, to the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors. 

(d) In the event that a proposed designation 
has been initiated prior to July 18, 2006, and the 
Planning Commission has failed to act upon such 
proposed designation as of the effective date of 
this ordinance, the Board of Supervisors may act 
on the proposed designation notwithstanding the 
Planning Commission&apos;s failure to act on the 
proposed designation. (Added by Ord. 27-67, 
App. 1/26/67; Ord. 26-07, File No. 061068, App.

as the said Board may deem necessary. The 
Board of Supervisors may approve, or modify

1/26/67) 

SEC. 1004.5. APPEAL TO BOARD OF

Board of Supervisors within 30 days by a protest 
subscribed by the owners of at least 20 percent of 
the property proposed to be designated, or by any 
governmental body or agency, or by an organiza- 
tion with a recognized interest in historical pres- 
ervation; provided, however, that if the proposal 
was initiated by the Board of Supervisors, the 



Clerk of the said Board shall be notified imme- 
diately of the disapproval without the necessity 
for an appeal. 

(a) Hearing. The Board of Supervisors shall 
hold a public hearing on any such proposal 
appealed to it or initiated by it, after due notice 
to the owners of the property included in the 
proposal, and such other notice as the said Board 
may deem necessary. 

(b) Decision. The Board of Supervisors may 
overrule the Planning Commission and approve, 
or modify and approve, the designation by a 
majority vote of all its members. 

(c) Resubmission, Reconsideration. If a 
proposal initiated by application has been disap- 
proved by the Planning Commission or by the 
Board of Supervisors on appeal, no subsequent 
application that is the same or substantially the 
same may be submitted or reconsidered for at 
least one year from the effective date of final 
action of the original proposal. (Added by Ord. 
27-67, App. 1/26/67)

teration, removal or demolition of a structure or 
any work involving a sign, awning, marquee, 
canopy, mural or other appendage, for which a 
City permit is required, except in conformity 
with the provisions of this Article 10. In addition, 
no such work shall take place unless all other 
applicable laws and regulations have been com- 
plied with, and any required permit has been 
issued for said work. 

(b) (1) Installation of a new general adver- 
tising sign is prohibited in any Historic District 
or on any historic property regulated by this 
Article 10. 

(2) The Central Permit Bureau shall not 
issue, and no other City department or agency 
shall issue, any permit for construction, alter- 
ation, removal or demolition of a structure or any 
permit for work involving a sign, awning, mar- 
quee, canopy, mural or other appendage on a 
landmark site or in an Historic District, except 
in conformity with the provisions of this Article 
10. In addition, no such permit shall be issued 
unless all other applicable laws and regulations 
have been complied with. 

(c) (1) Where so provided in the designat- 
ing ordinance for a historic district, any or all 
exterior changes visible from a public street or 
other public place shall require approval in ac- 
cordance with the provisions of this Article 10, 
regardless of whether or not a City permit is 
required for such exterior changes. Such exterior 
changes may include, but shall not be limited to, 
painting and repainting; landscaping; fencing; 
and installation of lighting fixtures and other 
building appendages. 

(2) The addition of a mural to any landmark 
or contributory structure in a historic district 
shall require compliance with the provisions of 
this Article 10, regardless of whether or not a 
City permit is required for the mural. 

(3) Alterations to City-owned parks, squares, 
plazas or gardens on a landmark site, where the 
designating ordinance identifies such alter- 
ations, shall require approval in accordance with 
the provisions of this Article 10, regardless of 
whether or not a City permit is required. 



(d) The Department shall maintain with 
the Central Permit Bureau a current record of 
designated landmarks and historic districts. Upon 
receipt of any application for a permit to carry 
out any construction, alteration, removal or demo- 
lition of a structure or any work involving a. sign, 
awning, marquee, canopy, mural or other append- 
age, on a landmark site or in a historic district, 
the Central Permit Bureau shall, unless the 
structure or feature concerned has been declared 
unsafe or dangerous pursuant to Section 1007 of 
this Article 10, promptly forward such permit 
application to the Department. 

(e) After receiving a permit application from 
the Central Permit Bureau in accordance with 
the preceding subsection, the Department shall 
ascertain whether Section 1006 requires a. Cer- 
tificate of Appropriateness for the work pro posed 
in such permit application. If such Certificate is 
required and has been issued, and if the permit 
application conforms to such Certificate, the per- 
mit application shall be processed without fur- 
ther reference to this Article 10. If such Certifi- 
cate is required and has not been issued, or if in 
the sole judgment of the Department the permit 
application does not so conform, the permit ap- 
plication shall be disapproved or held by the 
Department until such time as conformity does 
exist; the decision and action of the Department 
shall be final. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in 
the following cases the Department shall process 
the permit application without further refe rence 
to this Article 10: 

(1) When the application is for a permit to 
construct on a landmark site where the land- 
mark has been lawfully demolished and the site 
is not within a designated historic district; 

(2) When the application is for a permit to 
make interior alterations only on a privately-

review of such alterations to the privately- or 
publicly-owned structure pursuant to Section 
1004(c) hereof; 

(3) When the application is for a permit to 
do ordinary maintenance and repairs only. For 
the purpose of this Article 10, &quot;ordinary mainte-

purpose and effect of which is to correct deterio- 
ration, decay or damage, including repair of 
damage caused by fire or other disaster; 

(4) When the application is for a permit to 
comply with the UMB Seismic Retrofit Ordi- 
nances and the Zoning Administrator deter-

UMB Retrofit Architectural Design Guidelines, 
which guidelines shall be adopted by the Plan- 
ning Commission.

that such removal is the only feasible means to 
meet the standards for seismic load and forces of 
the latest adopted version of the San Francisco 
Building Code and the State Historical Building 
Code. 

(g) The following procedures shall govern 
review of the addition of murals to any landmark 
or contributory structure in a historic district: 

(1) Where the mural is proposed to be added 
to a landmark or contributory structure in a 
historic district, located on property owned by 
the City, no Certificate of Appropriateness shall 
be required. On such structures, the Art Com- 
mission shall not approve the mural until the 
Advisory Board has provided advice to the Art 
Commission on the impact of the mural on the 
historical structure. The Advisory Board shall 
provide advice to the Art Commission within 50 
days of receipt of a written request for advice and 
information regarding the placement, size and 
location of the proposed mural; 



(2) Where the mural is proposed to be added 
to a landmark or contributory structure in a 
historic district, located on property that is not 
owned by the City, a Certificate of Appropriate- 
ness shall be required. The Advisory Board shall 
not act on the Certificate of Appropriateness 
until the Art Commission has provided advice to 
the Advisory Board on the mural. The Art Com- 
mission shall provide advice to the Advisory 
Board within 50 days of receipt of a written 
request for advice and information regarding the 
proposed mural. (Amended by Ord. 222-72, App.

cates of Appropriateness; provided, however, that 
the designating ordinance for a historic district, 
or for a City-owned park, square, plaza or garden 
on a landmark site, may modify or add to these

ateness is required, the application for said Cer- 
tificate shall be reviewed by the Department 
with the advice of the Advisory Board. The 
Department, with the advice of the Advisory 
Board, shall determine within 20 days after the 
application is accepted for filing, whether or not 
the proposal would have a significant impact 
upon, or is potentially detrimental to, the land- 
mark site or historic district; and the Depart- 
ment shall notify the applicant of the determi- 
nation made. If it is determined that there would 
be no such significant impact or potential detri- 
ment, the Department shall issue a Certificate of 
Appropriateness to the applicant.

would have a significant impact upon, Dr is 
potentially detrimental to, the landmark site or 
historic district, or upon request of the Planning 
Commission, the Planning Commission shall hold 
a public hearing on the application. 

(b) Construction, Removal or Demoli- 
tion. The Planning Commission shall hold a

SEC. 1006.3. SCHEDULING AND 
NOTICE OF HEARING. 

When an application for a Certificate of Ap- 
propriateness has been filed and Section 1006.2 
provides that the Planning Commission shall 
hold a public hearing thereon, the Department 
shall set a time and place for said hearing within 
a reasonable period. Notice of the time, place and 
purpose of the hearing shall be given by the 
Department as follows: 

(a) By mail to the applicant; 

(b) By mail not less than 10 days prior to 
the date of the hearing to the owners of all real 
property that is the subject of the application 
and, if said property is in a historic district, to 
the owners of all real property within the historic 
district, using for this purpose the names and 
addresses of the owners as shown on the latest 
citywide assessment roll in the office of the Tax 
Collector. Failure to send notice by mail to any 
such property owner where the address of such 
owner is not shown on such assessment roll shall 
not invalidate any proceedings in connection 
with such action; 

(c) By publication at least once in a news- 
paper of general circulation in the City not less 
than 20 days prior to the date of the hearing; 

(d) Such other notice as the Department

SEC. 1006.4. REFERRAL TO ADVISORY 
BOARD PRIOR TO HEARING. 

Where a public hearing before the Planning 
Commission has been scheduled thereon, the 
application for a Certificate of Appropriateness 
shall be promptly referred to the Advisory Board 
and shall be considered by the Advisory Board at 
its next regular meeting, or at a special meeting 
called for that specific purpose. The Advisory 



Board shall render a report to the Planning 
Commission at or prior to the scheduled public 
hearing; failure of the Advisory Board to con- 
sider the application or to render a report shall 
not constitute grounds for continuation of the 
public hearing. (Amended by Ord. 222-72, App. 
8/9/72) 

SEC. 1006.5. CONDUCT OF HEARING; 
DECISION. 

Where a public hearing before the Planning 
Commission has been scheduled: 

(a) Report and Recommendation. The 

Department shall make necessary investigations 
and studies prior to the hearing of the Planning 
Commission. The report and recommendation of 
the Director of Planning shall be submitted at 
the hearing. 

(b) Record. A record shall be kept of the 
pertinent information presented at the hearing, 
and such record shall be maintained as a part of 
the permanent public records of the Department. 
A verbatim record may be made if permitted or 
ordered by the Planning Commission. 

(c) Continuations. The Planning Commis- 
sion shall determine the instances in which 
cases scheduled for hearing may be continued or 
taken under advisement. In such cases, new 
notice need not be given of the further hearing 
date, provided such date is announced at the 
scheduled hearing. 

(d) Decision. The decision of the Planning 
Commission shall be rendered within 30 days 
from the date of conclusion of the hearing; failure 
of the Commission to act within the prescribed 
time shall be deemed to constitute disapproval of 
the application. The decision of the Planning 
Commission, in either approving or disapproving 
the application pursuant to Section 1006.6, shall 
be final except upon the filing of a valid appeal to 
the Board of Supervisors as provided in Section 
1006.8. The decision of the Planning Commis- 
sion, in suspending action on an application 
pursuant to Section 1006.6, shall be final. If the 
Planning Commission, or the Board of Supervi- 
sors on appeal, approves the application, or after 
the expiration of any suspension period imposed 



Supp. No. 7, April 2007 



Sec. 1006.5. 



San Francisco - Planning Code 



1374 



by the Commission, the Department shall issue 
a Certificate of Appropriateness to the applicant. 

(e) Time Limit for Exercise. When ap- 
proving an application for a Certificate of Appro- 
priateness as provided herein the Planning Com- 
mission may impose a time limit for submission 
of a permit application conforming to the Certifi- 
cate; otherwise, such permit application must be 
submitted within a reasonable time. 

(f) Delegation of Hearing. The Planning 
Commission may delegate to a committee of one 
or more of its members, or to the Director of 
Planning or his designee, or to the Advisory 
Board, or to any combination of the foregoing, 
the holding of the hearing required by this Ar- 
ticle 10 for a Certificate of Appropriateness. The 
delegate or delegates shall submit to the Plan- 
ning Commission a record of the hearing, to- 
gether with a report of findings and recommen- 
dations relative thereto, for the consideration of 
the Commission in reaching its decision in the 
case. 

(g) Reconsideration. Whenever an appli- 
cation has been disapproved by the Planning 
Commission, or by the Board of Supervisors on 
appeal as described in Section 1006.8, no appli- 
cation, the same or substantially the same as 
that which was disapproved, shall be resubmit- 
ted to or reconsidered by the Planning Commis- 
sion within a period of one year from the effective 
date of final action upon the earlier application. 
(Amended by Ord. 222-72, App. 8/9/72) 

SEC. 1006.6. NATURE OF PLANNING 
COMMISSION DECISION. 

The decision of the Planning Commission 
after its public hearing shall be in accordance 
with the following provisions: 

(a) If the application for a Certificate of 
Appropriateness proposes construction or alter- 
ation of a structure or any work involving a sign, 
awning, marquee, canopy, mural or other append- 
age, or exterior changes in a historic district 
visible from a public street or other public place, 
the Planning Commission shall approve or dis- 
approve the application in whole or in part. 



(b) If the application proposes removal or 
demolition of a structure on a designated land- 
mark site, the Planning Commission may disap- 
prove or approve the application, or may sus- 
pend action on it for a period not to exceed 180 
days; provided that the Board of Supervisors by 
resolution may, for good cause shown, extend the 
suspension for an additional period not to exceed 
180 days, if the said Board acts not more than 90 
days and not less than 30 days prior to the 
expiration of the original 180-day period. 

(c) If the application proposes removal or 
demolition of a structure in a designated historic 
district, other than on a designated landmark 
site, the Planning Commission may disapprove 
or approve the application, or may suspend ac- 
tion on it for a period not to exceed 90 days, 
subject to extension by the Board of Supervisors 
as provided in the preceding subsection; pro- 
vided, however, that the designating ordinance 
for the historic district may authorize the sus- 
pension of action for an alternate period which 
shall in no event exceed 90 days, without exten- 
sion, and in such event the provision of the 
designating ordinance shall govern. 

(d) In the event action on an application to 
remove or demolish a structure is suspended as 
provided in this Section, the Planning Commis- 
sion, with the advice and assistance of the Advi- 
sory Board, may take such steps as it determines 
are necessary to preserve the structure con- 
cerned, in accordance with the purposes of this 
Article 10. Such steps may include, but shall not 
be limited to, consultations with civic groups, 
public agencies, and interested citizens, recom- 
mendations for acquisition of property by public 
or private bodies or agencies, and exploration of 
the possibility of moving one or more structures 
or other features. (Added by Ord. 222-72, App. 
8/9/72; amended by Ord. 97-96, App. 3/6/96; Ord. 
249-96, App. 6/19/96) 

SEC. 1006.7. STANDARDS FOR REVIEW 
OF APPLICATIONS. 

The Planning Commission, the Department, 
and the Advisory Board shall be guided by the 
standards in this Section in their review of 
applications for Certificates of Appropriateness 



Supp. No. 7, April 2007 



1375 



Preservation of Historical 
Architectural and Aesthetic Landmarks 



Sec. 1006.8. 



for proposed work on a landmark site or in a 
historic district. In appraising the effects and 
relationships mentioned herein, the Planning 
Commission, the Department and the Advisory 
Board shall in all cases consider the factors of 
architectural style, design, arrangement, tex- 
ture, materials, color, and any other pertinent 
factors. 

(a) The proposed work shall be appropriate 
for and consistent with the effectuation of the 
purposes of this Article 10. 

(b) For applications pertaining to landmark 
sites, the proposed work shall preserve, enhance 
or restore, and shall not damage or destroy, the 
exterior architectural features of the landmark 
and, where specified in the designating ordi- 
nance pursuant to Section 1004(c), its major 
interior architectural features. The proposed work 
shall not adversely affect the special character or 
special historical, architectural or aesthetic in- 
terest or value of the landmark and its site, as 
viewed both in themselves and in their setting, 
nor of the historic district in applicable cases. 

(c) For applications pertaining to property 
in historic districts, other than on a designated 
landmark site, any new construction, addition or 
exterior change shall be compatible with the 
character of the historic district as described in 
the designating ordinance; and, in any exterior 
change, reasonable efforts shall be made to pre- 
serve, enhance or restore, and not to damage or 
destroy, the exterior architectural features of the 
subject property which are compatible with the 
character of the historic district. Notwithstand- 
ing the foregoing, for any exterior change where 
the subject property is not already compatible 
with the character of the historic district, reason- 
able efforts shall be made to produce compatibil- 
ity, and in no event shall there be a greater 
deviation from compatibility. Where the required 
compatibility exists, the application for a Certifi- 
cate of Appropriateness shall be approved. 

(d) For applications pertaining to all prop- 
erty in historic districts, the proposed work shall 
also conform to such further standards as may be 
embodied in the ordinance designating the his- 
toric district. 



(e) For applications pertaining to the addi- 
tion of murals on a landmark or contributory 
structure in a historic district, the Advisory 
Board and the Planning Commission shall con- 
sider only the placement, size and location of the 
mural, to determine whether the mural covers or 
obscures significant architectural features of the 
landmark or contributory structure. For pur- 
poses of review under this Article 10, the City 
shall not consider the content or artistic merit of 
the mural. (Amended by Ord. 41-73, App. 2/1/73; 
Ord. 249-96, App. 6/19/96; Ord. 82-07, File No. 
070021, App. 4/20/2007) 

SEC. 1006.8. APPEALS FROM 
PLANNING COMMISSION DECISION. 

(a) Right of Appeal. The action of the 
Planning Commission in approving or disapprov- 
ing in whole or in part an application for a 
Certificate of Appropriateness shall be subject to 
appeal to the Board of Supervisors in accordance 
with this Section. An action of the Commission so 
appealed from shall not become effective unless 
and until approved by the Board of Supervisors 
in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this 
Section shall be construed to authorize the ap- 
peal of any decision under Section 1006.6 of this 
Article 10 to suspend action on an application. 

(b) Notice of Appeal. Any appeal under 
this Section shall be taken by filing written 
notice of appeal with the Board of Supervisors 
within 30 days after the date of action by the 
Planning Commission. In the case of a historic 
district, the notice of appeal shall be subscribed 
by the owners of at least 20 percent of the 
property affected by the proposed Certificate of 
Appropriateness; for the purposes of this calcu- 
lation, the property affected shall be deemed to 
be all property within the historic district. In the 
case of a landmark not in a historic district, the 
notice of appeal shall be subscribed by the prop- 
erty owner, or by any governmental body or 
agency, or by an organization with a recognized 
interest in historical preservation. 

(c) Hearing. Upon the filing of such writ- 
ten notice of appeal so subscribed, the Board of 
Supervisors or the Clerk thereof shall set a time 
and place for hearing such appeal, which shall be 



Supp. No. 7, April 2007 



Sec. 1006.8. 



San Francisco - Planning Code 



1376 



not less than 10 nor more than 30 days after such 
filing. The Board of Supervisors must decide 
such appeal within 30 days of the time set for the 
hearing thereon; provided that, if the full mem- 
bership of the Board is not present on the last 
day on which said appeal is set or continued for 
hearing within said period, the Board may post- 
pone said hearing and decision thereon until, but 
not later than, the full membership of the Board 
is present; provided, further, that the latest date 
to which said hearing and decision may be so 
postponed shall be not more than 90 days from 
the date of filing of the appeal. Failure of the 
Board of Supervisors to act within such time 
limit shall be deemed to constitute approval by 
the Board of the action of the Planning Commis- 
sion. 

(d) Decision. In acting upon any such ap- 
peal, the Board of Supervisors may disapprove 
the action of the Planning Commission only by a 
vote of not less than of all members of the Board. 

(e) Decisions Affecting City Hall. The 

provisions of this Subsection shall govern deci- 
sions by the City Planning Commission on a 
Certificate of Appropriateness for alteration work 
to be done at City Hall, in lieu of any other 
provision set forth above. Upon the approval or 
disapproval by the City Planning Commission of 
a Certificate of Appropriateness for alteration of 
City Hall, the Secretary of the City Planning 
Commission shall transmit to the Clerk of the 
Board of Supervisors written notification of the 
Commission&apos;s decision. The Clerk shall set a 
time and place for hearing on the decision, which 
shall be not less than 10 nor more than 30 days 
after receipt of such notification. The Board of 
Supervisors may either approve, disapprove, or 
modify the Commission&apos;s decision by majority 
vote. The Board of Supervisors must take this 
action within 30 days of the time set for the 
hearing thereon, provided that, if the full mem- 
bership of the Board is not present on the last 
day on which said hearing is set or continued 
within said period, the Board may postpone said 
hearing and decision thereon until, but not later 
than, the full membership of the Board is present; 
provided further, that the latest date to which 
said hearing and decision may be so postponed 



shall be not more than 90 days from the date of 
the receipt of written notification. Failure of the 
Board of Supervisors to act within such time 
limit shall be deemed to constitute approval by 
the Board of the action of the City Planning 
Commission. (Amended by Ord. 222-72, App. 
8/9/72; Ord. 163-87, App. 5/14/87) 

SEC. 1007. UNSAFE OR DANGEROUS 
CONDITIONS. 

None of the provisions of this Article 10 shall 
be construed to prevent any measures of con- 
struction, alteration, or demolition necessary to 
correct the unsafe or dangerous condition of any 
structure, other feature, or part thereof, where 
such condition has been declared unsafe or dan- 
gerous by the Superintendent of the Bureau of 
Building Inspection or the Chief of the Bureau of 
Fire Prevention and Public Safety, and where 
the proposed measures have been declared nec- 
essary, by such official, to correct the said condi- 
tion; provided, however, that only such work as 
is absolutely necessary to correct the unsafe or 
dangerous condition may be performed pursuant 
to this Section. In the event any structure or 
other feature shall be damaged by fire, or other 
calamity, or by Act of God or by the public enemy, 
to such an extent that in the opinion of the 
aforesaid officials it cannot reasonably be re- 
paired and restored, it may be removed in con- 
formity with normal permit procedures and ap- 
plicable laws. (Added by Ord. 27-67, App. 1/26/ 
67) 

SEC. 1008. COMPLIANCE WITH 
MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS. 

The owner, lessee or other person in actual 
charge of a landmark, or of a structure in an 
historic district, shall comply with all applicable 
codes, laws and regulations governing the main- 
tenance of the property. It is the intent of this 
Section to preserve from deliberate or inadvert- 
ent neglect the exterior portions of such land- 
mark or structure, the interior portions thereof 
when subject to control as specified in the desig- 
nating ordinance, and all interior portions thereof 



Supp. No. 7, April 2007

Architectural and Aesthetic Landmarks 



Sec. 1011. 



whose maintenance is necessary to prevent de- 
terioration and decay of any exterior portion. 
(Amended by Ord. 222-72, App. 8/9/72) 

SEC. 1009. ADVICE AND GUIDANCE TO 
PROPERTY OWNERS. 

The Advisory Board may, upon request of the 
property owner, render advice and guidance with 
respect to any proposed work for which a Certifi- 
cate of Appropriateness is not required, on a 
designated landmark site or in a designated 
historic district. In rendering such advice and 
guidance, the Advisory Board shall be guided by 
the purposes and standards in this Article 10. 
This Section shall not be construed to impose 
any regulations or controls upon any property. 
(Amended by Ord. 222-72, App. 8/9/72) 

SEC. 1010. PROPERTY OWNED BY 
PUBLIC AGENCIES. 

(a) The Department shall take appropriate 
steps to notify all public agencies which own or 
may acquire property in the City, about the 
existence and character of designated landmarks 
and historic districts; if possible, the Department 
shall cause a current record of such landmarks 
and districts to be maintained in each such 
public agency. In the case of any publicly owned 
property on a landmark site or in a historic 
district which is not subject to the permit review 
procedures of the City, the agency owning the 
said property shall seek the advice of the Plan- 
ning Commission prior to approval or authoriza- 
tion of any construction, alteration or demolition 
thereon; and the Planning Commission, with the 
aid of the Advisory Board and in consultation 
with the Art Commission in appropriate cases, 
shall render a report to the owner as expedi- 
tiously as possible, based on the purposes and 
standards in this Article 10. If Planning Com- 
mission review of a public project involving con- 
struction, alteration or demolition on a land- 
mark site or in a historic district is required 
under any other law, or under the Charter, the 
Planning Commission shall render the report 
referred to in this Section to such public agency 
without specific request therefor. 



(b) All officers, boards, commissions and 
departments of the City shall cooperate with the 
Advisory Board and the Planning Commission in 
carrying out the spirit and intent of this Article 
10. 

(c) Nothing in this Article 10 shall be con- 
strued to imposed any regulations or controls 
upon designated landmarks owned or controlled 
by the Golden Gate Bridge Highway and Trans- 
portation District. (Added by Ord. 27-67, App. 
1/26/67; amended by Ord. 244-98, App. 7/31/98) 

SEC. 1011. RECOGNITION OF 
STRUCTURES OF MERIT. 

(a) The Advisory Board may recommend, 
and the Planning Commission may approve, a 
list of structures of historical, architectural or 
aesthetic merit which have not been designated 
as landmarks and are not situated in designated 
historic districts. The said list may be added to 
from time to time. The purpose of this list shall 
be to recognize and encourage the protection, 
enhancement, perpetuation and use of such struc- 
tures. The Advisory Board and the Planning 
Commission shall maintain a record of historic 
structures in the City which have been officially 
designated by agencies of the State or federal 
government, and shall cause such structures to 
be added to the aforesaid list. 

(b) Nothing in this Article 10 shall be con- 
strued to impose any regulations or controls 
upon such structures of merit included on the 
said list and neither designated as landmarks 
nor situated in historic districts. 

(c) The Planning Commission, with the ad- 
vice of the Advisory Board, may authorize such 
steps as it deems desirable to recognize the merit 
of, and to encourage the protection, enhance- 
ment, perpetuation and use of any such listed 
structure, or of any designated landmark or any 
structure in a designated historic district, includ-

SEC. 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 

The Board of Supervisors finds that the area 
known and described in this ordinance as Jack- 
son Square contains a number of structures 
having a special character and special historical, 
architectural and aesthetic interest and value 
and constitutes a distinct section of the City. The 
Board of Supervisors further finds that designa- 
tion of said area as a Historic District will be in 
furtherance of and in conformance with the pur- 
poses of Article 10 of the City Planning Code and 
the standards set forth therein, and that preser- 
vation on an area basis rather than on the basis 
of individual structures alone is required in 
order to prevent the needless destruction and 
impairment of Jackson Square. 

This ordinance is intended to further the 
general purpose of historic preservation legisla- 
tion as set forth in Section 1001 of the City 
Planning Code, to promote the health, safety and 
general welfare of the public through: 

(a) The protection, enhancement, perpetua- 
tion and use of structures, sites and areas that 
are reminders of past eras, events and persons 
important in local, State or national history, or 
which provide significant examples of architec- 
tural styles of the past or are landmarks in the 
history of architecture, or which are unique and 
irreplaceable assets to the City and its neighbor- 
hoods, or which provide for this and future 
generations examples of the physical surround- 
ings in which past generations lived; 

(b) The development and maintenance of 
appropriate settings and environment for such 
structures, and in such sites and areas; 



(c) The enhancement of property values, 
the stabilization of neighborhoods and areas of 
the City, the increase of economic and financial 
benefits to the City and its inhabitants, and the 
promotion of tourist trade and interest; 

(d) The preservation and encouragement of 
a City of varied architectural styles, reflecting 
the distinct phases of its history: Cultural, social, 
economic, political and architectural; and 

(e) The enrichment of human life in its 
educational and cultural dimensions in order to 
serve spiritual as well as material needs, by 
fostering knowledge of the living heritage of the 
past. 

In addition, this ordinance is intended to 
maintain the scale and basic character of Jack- 
son Square, through: 

(a) Protection and preservation of the basic 
characteristics and salient architectural details 
of structures insofar as these characteristics and 
details are compatible with the Historic District; 

(b) Affording the widest possible scope for 
continuing vitality through private renewal and 
architectural creativity, within appropriate con- 
trols and standards. It is intended to foster a 
climate in which Jackson Square may continue 
to exist as a living, changing commercial area 
and not a static museum; 

(c) Encouragement of the development of 
vacant and incompatibly developed properties in 
accordance with the character of the area; 

(d) Encouragement of maximum use by and 
convenience to pedestrians. (Added Ord. 221-72, 
App. 8/9/72) 

SEC. 2. DESIGNATION. 

Pursuant to Section 1004 of the City Plan- 
ning Code, Chapter II, Part II of the San Fran- 
cisco Municipal Code, Jackson Square is hereby 
designated as a Historic District, this designa- 
tion having been duly approved by resolution of 
the City Planning Commission. (Added Ord. 221- 
72, App. 8/9/72) 



App. B, Sec. 3.

SEC. 3. LOCATION AND BOUNDARIES. 

The location and boundaries of the Jackson 
Square Historic District shall be as designated 
on the Jackson Square Historic District Map, the 
original of which is on file with the Clerk of the 
board of Supervisors under File No. 276-72, 
which Map is hereby incorporated herein as 
though fully set forth. (Added Ord. 221-72, App. 
8/9/72) 

SEC. 4. RELATION TO CITY PLANNING 
CODE. 

(a) Article 10 of the City Planning Code is 
the basic law governing historic preservation in 
the City and County of San Francisco. This 
ordinance, being a specific application of Article 
10, is both subject to and in addition to the 
provisions thereof. 

(b) Except as may be specifically provided 
to the contrary in this ordinance, nothing in this 
ordinance shall supersede, impair or modify any 
City Planning Code provisions applicable to prop- 
erty in Jackson Square, including but not limited 
to existing and future regulations controlling 
uses, height, bulk, coverage, floor area ratio, 
required open space, off-street parking and signs. 
(Added Ord. 221-72, App. 8/9/72) 

SEC. 5. JUSTIFICATION. 

The characteristics of the said Historic Dis- 
trict justifying its designation are as follows: 

(a) History of the Area. The Historic Dis- 
trict contains virtually the sole surviving com- 
mercial buildings from the 1850&apos;s and 1860&apos;s. In 
effect this area, in close proximity to Portsmouth 
Plaza where the major segment of the modern 
City began, was the central business district of 
these early times. Its waterfront location led to 
its use for mercantile and financial purposes, 
consulates and offices; and many distinguished 
men had businesses or property in the area, 
including General William Tecumseh Sherman, 
Colonel Jonathan Stevenson, James King of Wil- 
liam, Mayors Charles Brenham and Ephraim 
Burr, Domingo Ghirardelli and Anson Hotaling, 
Paxon Dean Atherton, William Lent, Alexander 
Grogan and James de Fremery. The original 



waterline came to about Montgomery and Jack- 
son Streets and the present district is partly on 
filled ground, some of the fill consisting of the 
hulls of ships abandoned in the rush to the; gold 
fields. 

More than any other existing part of San 
Francisco, this area recalls the Gold and Silver 
era and the days of the Vigilante movement. 

The Barbary Coast, north of the original 
commercial area, had a somewhat different but 
noteworthy history. Although the present build- 
ings do not date from the 19th century, many of 
them were rebuilt immediately after the 1906 
Earthquake and Fire and embody the spirit and 
appearance of the earlier City. In fact, this area 
to the south of Telegraph Hill had an interna- 
tional reputation from the 1850&apos;s on. 

(b) Basic Nature of the Area. The His- 
toric District includes historically and architec- 
turally significant buildings ranging from the 
1850&apos;s to the early years of the present: century. 
The vast majority of buildings are under 40 feet 
in height. The area is large enough to be viable, 
but yet is compact. It is predominantly oriented 
to the pedestrian rather than the automobile. 
There is a healthy and vital mixture of activities. 
Interior streets are narrow and there are no 
major through arteries. Streetscapes are an im- 
portant part of the District&apos;s character. 

(c) Architectural Character. Then? are 
common architectural features tying the area 
together and providing visual distinction and 
pleasure. These common elements, used through- 
out the District in varying patterns and empha- 
ses, pertain to overall form and continuity, scale 
and proportion, fenestration, materials, color, 
texture, detail and decorative features. A high 
quality of architecture of buildings and their 
features is well-distributed throughout the His- 
toric District. Visual distinction is due in many 
cases to the original construction, often carefully 
restored, but in some cases it is due to thoughtful 
remodeling that captures the historic character 
of the District. 

(d) Uniqueness and Location. Jackson 
Square includes the City&apos;s only surviving early 
commercial area. Its distinct quality is further 



1395 



Preservation of Historical 
Architectural and Aesthetic Landmarks 



App. B, Sec. 6. 



enhanced by a downtown location, affording an 
impressive contrast with the adjacent office core. 

(e) Visual and Functional Unity. The His- 
toric District, within the selected boundaries, 
has an identifiable scale and common architec- 
tural features. Narrow interior streets, street 
trees, quiet alleys, pedestrian orientation and 
intimacy of view in most of the District also 
contribute to its visual unity, as does the contrast 
with surrounding areas. In terms of function, 
there has been a coalescence of commercial de- 
velopment, uses and exterior building treat- 
ment. 

(f) Dynamic Continuity. Jackson Square 
is a continually evolving commercial area, not a 
static museum. The area has proven its capacity 
for incremental adaptation to new uses. 

(g) Benefits to the City and its Resi- 
dents. Economically, the area houses specialized 
enterprises which demand a unique, prestige 
location; and it is a vital part of the fabric of the 
historical City that attracts tourists and is ac- 
tively promoted by the City for this very purpose. 
Culturally, it provides a strong historical and 
educational resource. Aesthetically, its architec- 
tural and visual appeal are immediate, while its 
value in terms of urban design within the City 
pattern as a whole is equally important. (Added 
Ord. 221-72, App. 8/9/72) 

SEC. 6. FEATURES. 

The exterior architectural features of the 
said Historic District that should be preserved 
are described and depicted in the Jackson Square 
Report dated June 1971, including the Facade 
Elevations and Descriptions therein, and the 
photographs, case reports and other material on 
file in the Department of City Planning in Docket 
No. LM72.1 (HD); the summary description be- 
ing as follows: 

Overall Form and Continuity. On interior 
streets, building height is generally well-related 
to street width. Buildings are typically two or 
three stories high at the street. 

Facades are continuous at the property line. 

Scale and Proportion. Ground floors are 
frequently high, some as much as 20 feet from 



street level, often with cornice separating them 
from upper floors, providing continuity along the 
street frontage. There is a regularity of overall 
form and proportion. On the ground floor this 
typically takes the form of bays closely spaced, 
10 to 12 feet apart on center, with deep-set 
openings and inset entrances. 

Ground-floor treatment is definitely open in 
nature, with openings separated by narrow strip- 
ings or pillars of brick or cast iron. The open 
emphasis orients the ground floors toward the 
pedestrian, with attractive show windows. 

Fenestration. Glazing is deeply recessed, 
producing a strong interplay between light and 
shade. Protruding window frames are common. 

Windows are narrow and vertical in empha- 
sis, rhythmically spaced, and match the bay 
spacing below and the shape and proportion of 
windows in nearby buildings. Door openings are 
frequently narrow and high. 

At the upper floors, the proportion of win- 
dows to solid wall is typically less than 50 
percent. 

Materials. Standard brick masonry is pre- 
dominant, at times exposed and at times painted, 
with thick bearing walls. Some buildings are 
stuccoed over the brick and some are concrete. 
The sides of buildings are frequently of brick and 
form a significant part of the view from the street 
where they are higher than adjacent buildings. 
Cast iron is often used in details and decorative 
features, notably in pilasters. Iron shutters are 
also found. 

Color. Red brick is typical. Earth tones pre- 
dominate, with painted brick, where it occurs, 
typically in muted but not timid tones. Reds, 
browns, yellows, greens, grays and blues are 
found. 

Texture. Typical facing materials give a rough, 
textured appearance. 

Overall texture of the facades is fine-grained. 

Detail. Arches are common at ground floor, 
and frequently upper floors. 

Upper terminal cornices as well as lower 
cornices are typical, often heavy and projecting. 



App. B, Sec. 6. 



San Francisco - Planning Code 



1396 



Classical features predominate, including pedi- 
ments, columns or pilasters, and parapets. 

Frequent exposed anchor plates are visible, 
holding in place the tie rods used to prevent the 
bearing walls from bulging. 

Decorative Features. Characteristic signs 
and awnings are modest in size, restrained in 
design, do not obscure building features, and are 
integrated into the facade. Sign lettering is gen- 
erally tasteful. 

There are many attractive and appropriate 
light fixtures. 

Well-designed planter boxes provide welcome 
touches of greenery. (Added Ord. 221-72, App. 
8/9/72) 

SEC. 7. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS FOR 
CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS. 

The procedures, requirements, controls and 
standards in Sections 1006 through 1006.8 of 
Article 10 of the City Planning Code shall apply 
to all applications for Certificates of Appropriate- 
ness in the Jackson Square Historic District. In 
addition, the following provisions shall apply to 
all such applications; in the event of any conflict 
or inconsistency between the following provi- 
sions and Article 10, those procedures, require- 
ments, controls and standards affording stricter 
protection to landmarks, landmark sites and the 
Historic District shall prevail. 

(a) Character of the Historic District. 

The standards for review of all applications for 
Certificates of Appropriateness are as set forth 
in Section 1006.7 of Article 10. For the purposes 
of review pursuant to said standards, the &quot;char- 
acter of the Historic District&quot; shall mean the 
exterior architectural features of the Jackson 
Square Historic District referred to and de- 
scribed in Section 6 of this ordinance. 

(b) Additional Standards for Certain 
Features. Facade line continuity is desirable. 
Therefore, setbacks and arcades, not generally 
being features of Jackson Square, should be 
carefully considered, but interior courts and in- 
terior pedestrian areas offer great potential. 



(c) Exterior Changes Requiring Ap- 
proval. Regardless of whether or not a City 
permit is required, all exterior changes within 
the Jackson Square Historic District, visible from 
a public street or other public place, shall require 
approval pursuant to the provisions of Article 10 
of the City Planning Code. Such exterior changes 
shall include, but shall not be limited to, paint- 
ing and repainting; landscaping; fencing; and 
installation of lighting fixtures and other build- 
ing appendages. 

(d) Demolition of Non-Landmarks. The 

provisions of this Subsection (d) shall apply to 
any proposed removal or demolition of a struc- 
ture in the Jackson Square Historic District, 
other than on a designated landmark site. Not- 
withstanding any other provision of this Section, 
the Planning Commission shall not suspend ac- 
tion on an application for a Certificate of Appro- 
priateness for any such proposed removal or 
demolition for a period in excess of the period 
specified in this Subsection, and the Board of 
Supervisors shall not extend any such period of 
suspension. 

(1) The property owner or his authorized 
agent may at any time submit a written request 
to the Department for a finding of incompatibil- 
ity with respect to a structure in the Historic 
District, other than on a designated landmark 
site. If the Department, with the advice of the 
Advisory Board, finds that the structure is clearly 
incompatible with the character of the Historic 
District as described in this ordinance, the De- 
partment shall so indicate by letter to the owner 
or his agent. Said finding, unless subsequently 
revoked by the Department (by letter to the 
owner or his agent, prior to submission of a 
permit application for removal or demolition), 
shall be conclusively deemed to constitute a 
Certificate of Appropriateness for removal or 
demolition of the structure. 

(2) Except where such finding of incompat- 
ibility has been made by the Department and 
has not been so revoked, any application for a 
Certificate of Appropriateness for removal or 
demolition of a structure in the Historic District, 
other than on a designated landmark site, shall 



1397 Preservation of Historical App. B, Sec. 7 

Architectural and Aesthetic Landmarks 

be the subject of a public hearing before the City 
Planning Commission, as provided in Section 
1006.2 of Article 10. After holding a public hear- 
ing in accordance with the provisions of Article 
10, the Planning Commission shall determine 
whether or not the existing structure is incom- 
patible with the character of the Historic District 
as described in this ordinance. If the Commis- 
sion, in its sole and final discretion, determines 
that the structure is substantially compatible 
with the District, the Commission may request 
the applicant to submit a facade remodeling 
feasibility study and information regarding any 
new structure or other development proposed for 
the site, but the applicant shall not be required 
to submit any such material. The Commission 
shall then approve the application, or suspend 
action of the proposed removal or demolition for 
a period not to exceed ISO days, giving consider- 
ation to any such additional material that may 
have been submitted as well as to the standards 
in Section 1006.7 of Article 10. 

(3) Where action on a proposed removal or 
demolition has been suspended by the Planning 
Commission pursuant to this Subsection (d) and 
the Commission determines, at any time during 
the period of suspension, that there is no reason- 
able chance of preserving the structure, the 
Commission shall immediately terminate the 
suspension and the suspension period shall ex- 
pire. 

(4) Where action on a proposed removal or 
demolition has been suspended by the Planning 
Commission pursuant to this Subsection (d), and 
an application for a Certificate of Appropriate- 
ness for construction or alteration on the site has 
also been filed, the said suspension of action 
shall not constitute grounds for postponement or 
continuation of the public hearing or decision on 
the proposed construction or alteration. 

(5) If the Planning Commission has deter- 
mined that the existing structure is incompat- 
ible, or after the expiration of any suspension 
period imposed by the Commission, the Depart- 
ment shall issue to the applicant a Certificate of 
Appropriateness for removal or demolition. (Added 
Ord. 221-72, App. 8/9/72)

SEC. 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 

The Board of Supervisors hereby finds that 
the area known and described in this ordinance 
as the Northeast Waterfront has a special char- 
acter and special historical, architectural and 
aesthetic interest and value and constitutes a 
distinct section of the City. The Board of Super- 
visors further finds that designation of this area 
as an Historic District will further and conform 
to the purposes and standards of Article 10 of the 
City Planning Code, and that preservation on an 
area basis, rather than on the basis of individual 
structures alone, is required in order to preserve 
the character of the Northeast Waterfront Dis- 
trict. 

This ordinance is intended to further the 
general purpose of historic preservation legisla- 
tion as set forth in Section 101 of the City 
Planning Code through: 

(a) The protection, enhancement, perpetua- 
tion and use of structures, sites and areas that 
are reminders of past eras, events and persons 
important in local, State or national history, or 
which provide significant examples of architec- 
tural styles of the past or are landmarks in the 
history of architecture, or which are unique and 
irreplaceable assets to the City and its neighbor- 
hoods, or which provide for this and future 
generations examples of the physical surround- 
ings in which past generations lived; 

(b) The development and maintenance of 
appropriate settings and environment for such 
structures; 



(c) The enhancement of property values, 
the stabilization of areas of the City, the increase 
of economic and financial benefits for the City 
and its inhabitants, and the promotion of tourist 
trade; 

(d) The preservation and encouragement of 
a city of varied architectural styles, reflecting 
the distinct phases of its architectural, cultural, 
economic, political and social history; 

(e) The enrichment of human life in its 
educational and cultural dimensions; to serve 
spiritual and material needs by fostering knowl- 
edge of the past. 

In addition, this ordinance is intended to 
maintain the scale and basic character of the 
Northeast Waterfront Historic District, through: 

(a) Preservation of the basic characteristics 
and salient architectural details of structures 
within the Historic District; 

(b) Affording the widest possible scope for 
continuing vitality through private renewal and 
architectural creativity, within appropriate con- 
trols and standards; 

(c) Encouragement of the development of 
vacant and incompatibly developed properties in 
accordance with the character of the area. (Added 
Ord. 171-83, App. 4/8/83) 

SEC. 2. DESIGNATION. 

Pursuant to Section 1004 of the City Plan- 
ning Code, Chapter II, Part II of the San Fran- 
cisco Municipal Code, the Northeast Waterfront 
is hereby designated as an Historic District, this 
designation having been duly approved by Reso- 
lution No. 9517 of the City Planning Commis- 
sion. (Added Ord. 171-83, App. 4/8/83) 

SEC. 3. LOCATION AND BOUNDARIES. 

The location and boundaries of the Northeast 
Waterfront Historic District shall be as desig- 
nated on the Northeast Waterfront Historic Dis- 
trict Map, the original of which is on file with the 
Clerk of the Board of Supervisors under File No.

SEC. 4. RELATION TO CITY PLANNING 
CODE. 

(a) Article 10 of the City Planning Code is 
the basic law governing historic preservation in 
the City and County of San Francisco. This 
ordinance, being a specific application of Article 
10, is both subject to and in addition to the 
provisions thereof. 

(b) Except as may be specifically provided 
to the contrary in the ordinance, nothing in this 
ordinance shall supersede, impair or modify any 
City Planning Code provisions applicable to prop- 
erty in the Northeast Waterfront Historic Dis- 
trict, including but not limited to existing and 
future regulations controlling uses, height, bulk 
coverage, floor area ratio, required open space, 
off-street parking and signs. (Added Ord. 171-83, 
App. 4/8/83) 

SEC. 5. STATEMENT OF 
SIGNIFICANCE. 

(a) History of the Area. The Northeast 
Waterfront District contains commercial ware- 
house buildings from nearly every decade of San 
Francisco&apos;s history. The area reflects the water- 
front storage and maritime activities which, un- 
til recently, were an important aspect of San 
Francisco business history. These buildings range 
in age from the early clipper ship warehouses of 
Scotsman Daniel Gibb in the 1850&apos;s to the prop- 
erties owned by the General Engineering and 
Drydock Co., a company crucial to the shipbuild- 
ing effort that made San Francisco Bay the 
major Pacific maritime support facility during 
World War II. 

The original shoreline of Yerba Buena swept 
in a curve from Montgomery Street to roughly 
Jackson Street and on to the deeper waters 
slightly east of Battery. This point was known as 
Punta del Embarcadero. The cove itself fronting 
on the settlement was shallow and could be 
navigated only by small craft of shallow draft. 
The historic district boundary begins at what 
was the site of the first deep water landing in 



San Francisco at Clark&apos;s Point. The first vessel 
to moor at a wharf tied up at this site and 
discharged cargo in 1848. The first Pacific Mail 
steamer to arrive in San Francisco disembarked 
passengers in this area in 1848 and the unique 
clipper ships built expressly for San Francisco&apos;s 
Gold Rush trade docked in this area in large 
numbers. 

During the Gold Rush era, the boundaries of 
the area were extended eastward by landfill into 
the Bay in order to create new warehousing 
space. Large sections of Telegraph Hill were 
excavated for the fill. In the late 1880&apos;s a sea wall 
was built which settled the eastern boundaries of 
the area. The clipper ships of the Gold. Rush era 
and paddlewheel steamers of the delta and river 
trade docked alongside its wharves discharging a 
multitude of cargo, much of which passed through 
local warehouses. In the 1880&apos;s and 1890&apos;s large 
numbers of iron-hulled square riggers were in- 
volved in hauling grain From California&apos;s Cen- 
tral Valley to European markets. The new trans- 
continental trains were loaded on barges from 
the other side of the Bay and were docked and 
discharged in this area. A number of ships are 
presumed to have been buried beneath the fill 
used to extend the district. A ship buried in 1851 
as an extension of Frederick Griffing&apos;s wharf was 
recently unearthed during the excavation for 
Levi&apos;s Plaza on the northern boundary of the 
district. 

Many distinguished San Francisco names 
and firms have been associated with the ware- 
houses in the area: William T. Coleman head of 
the Vigilante Committee; George Howes, opera- 
tor of clipper ships; Daniel Gibb, builder of the 
earliest warehouses in the area which were bought 
in 1861 by John Sanborn; Charles Minturn, 
steamboat tycoon; Isaac Friedman, the &quot;Vfheat 
King&quot;; and Samuel Haslett, founder of a leading 
warehouse firm in the Bay Area. Pioneer firms 
such as American Bisquit Co., Cowell&apos;s Lime and 
Cement Co., W.P Fuller Co., the Petri Italian- 
American Cigar Co., and the California Fruit 
Packing Co., have major extant structures in the 
area. After 1906 firms such as Bemis Bag Co., 
National Ice and Cold Storage, Cudahy Meat 
Packing, Armour and Co., Ciocca-Lombardi Wine 



1405 



Preservation of Historical 
Architectural and Aesthetic Landmarks 



App. D, Sec. 5. 



Co., and the Italian- American Canning Co. lo- 
cated in the area. In the 1920&apos;s and 1930&apos;s the 
Sunset Press, Security Lithograph, and various 
typography and lithography operations were set 
up in the district, reflecting the increasing im- 
portance of this industry in San Francisco&apos;s 
economic development. In 1940 General Engi- 
neering and Drydock marshalled a number of 
buildings for ship repair and maintenance dur- 
ing World War II. 

These warehouse facilities have been in con- 
tinuous industrial use from the Gold Rush to the 
mid 1960&apos;s. Since that decade showrooms, office 
and retail uses have been integrated into reno- 
vated warehouse structures. 

The area is architecturally significant as a 
representation of warehouse and industrial build- 
ings from the brick structures of the Gold Rush 
era to the reinforced concrete buildings intro- 
duced after the turn of the century. Some of the 
present buildings date from well before the turn 
of the century, though they were rebuilt after the 
1906 fire. Since warehouse architecture did not 
undergo profound stylistic changes until the in- 
troduction of reinforced concrete, the pre- and 
post-fire brick warehouses embody the original 
appearance and spirit of the early warehouse 
district. Of particular note is the block bounded 
by Front, Battery, Union, and Green streets, the 
most cohesive extant brick warehouse complex 
from this era in the City. In addition, cobblestone 
paving and the standard and narrow gauge belt 
line railroad track which served the district are 
visible at the foot of Commerce Street. The area 
clearly serves as a visual reminder of San 
Francisco&apos;s earlier maritime-warehousing com- 
merce. 

(b) Basic Nature of the Area. The His- 
toric District includes historically and architec- 
turally significant buildings dating from the 1850&apos;s 
to the present century. The buildings vary in 
height from approximately six stories closest to 
the base of Telegraph Hill to a maximum of four 
stories at The Embarcadero and the Bay. The 
area was pre-dominantly oriented toward ship- 
ping, drayage and warehousing, and is now 
being converted to low rise office space. The 



addition of Levi&apos;s Plaza on the northern bound- 
ary offers a modern structure compatible with 
the district. 

(c) Architectural Character. Common ar- 
chitectural features tie the area together and 
provide visual distinction. Two major building 
materials were used in the area; brick since the 
Gold Rush era and reinforced concrete after the 
1906 fire. 

Common architectural elements are repeated 
throughout the District. Of particular note are 
the large bulk and minimal fenestration of the 
earlier warehouse structures. Other common fea- 
tures are scale and proportion, materials, color, 
texture, and the minimal use of decorative ele- 
ments. Visual distinction is due in some cases to 
the original construction plus the carefully de- 
signed addition of upper stories as evidenced in 
the original two-story Cudahy Meat Packing 
building by Henry Gielfus (1907) with a two- 
story addition by Ward and Blohme (1918). 

(d) Uniqueness and Location. The unique 
quality of the Northeast Waterfront Historic 
District stems from the fact that so many build- 
ings from approximately 14 decades of San Fran- 
cisco history are clustered within this nine-block 
area. Its distinct character is contrasted by Gate- 
way Commons on the south and Levi&apos;s Plaza on 
the north. The district is close to the downtown 
high-rise core and the Jackson Square Historic 
District. 

(e) Visual and Functional Unity. The His- 
toric District has an identifiable character and 
common architectural features. The primary uni- 
fying factors are scale and the texture of the 
buildings, as well as materials. In terms of 
function, there has been a continuous transition 
from the clipper ship services of the 1850&apos;s through 
the warehousing and shipping services of the 
early twentieth century, to the gradual transfor- 
mation of warehouses into premium office space 
within walking distance of the downtown. 

(f) Dynamic Continuity. The Northeast 
Waterfront District is an evolving commercial 
area. The area has proven its capacity for incre- 



App. D, Sec. 5. 



San Francisco - Planning Code 



1406 



mental adaption to new uses. Designation as an 
historic district is intended to complement the 
economic viability of the area. 

(g) Benefits to the City and its Resi- 
dents. Economically, the area in the past has 
housed specialized enterprises and is currently 
evolving into a satellite office district of the 
downtown core. Culturally, it provides a strong 
historical and educational resource and link with 
the past. Aesthetically, its architecture and vi- 
sual appeal are immediate, while its value in 
terms of urban design within the City pattern as 
a whole is equally important. (Added Ord. 171- 
83, App. 4/8/83) 

SEC. 6. FEATURES. 

(a) Overall Form and Continuity. Build- 
ing height is generally within a six-story range, 
with the higher structures closer to the base of 
Telegraph Hill and lower buildings near the 
water. Many of the oldest structures are one or 
two stories in height. 

(b) Scale and Proportion. The buildings 
are of typical warehouse design, large in bulk, 
often with large arches and openings originally 
designed for easy vehicular access. There is a 
regularity of overall form. The earlier brick struc- 
tures blend easily with the scaled-down Beaux 
Arts forms of the turn of the century and the 
plain reinforced-concrete structures characteris- 
tic of twentieth century industrial architecture. 

(c) Fenestration. Minimal glazing is deeply 
recessed, producing a strong shadow line. The 
earliest structures have few windows expressing 
their warehouse function. They are varied in 
size, rhythmically spaced, and relate in shape 
and proportion to those in nearby buildings. 
Larger industrial sash windows began to be 
incorporated in structures built from the 1920&apos;s 
and onward. Door openings are often massive to 
facilitate easy access of bulk materials. 

(d) Materials. Standard brick masonry is 
predominant for the oldest buildings in the Dis- 
trict, with reinforced concrete introduced after 
the 1906 fire. Some of the brick facades have 



been stuccoed over. One of the structures still 
has its metal shutters, which were once typical of 
the area. 

(e) Color. Red brick is typical, with some 
yellow and painted brick. Muted earth tones 
predominate in shades of red, brown, £p*een, 
gray, and blue. 

(f) Texture. Typical facing materials j^ive a 
rough-textured appearance. The overall texture 
of the facades is rough-grained. 

(g) Detail. Arches are common at the ground 
floor, and are frequently repeated on upper floors. 
Flattened arches for window treatment are&apos; typi- 
cal. Cornices are simple and generally tend to be 
abstract versions of the more elaborate cornices 
found on downtown commercial structures from 
the nineteenth century. Most of the surfaces of 
the later buildings are plain and simple, reflect- 
ing their function. Some of the earlier brickwork 
contains suggestions of pilasters, again highly 
abstracted. Where detail occurs, it is often found 
surrounding entryways. 

(h) Age. All of the buildings in the area 
were either partially or totally destroyed by the 
earthquake and fire of 1906. As in the Jackson 
Square area, many were rebuilt along the lines 
of the previous design, often using materials 
salvaged from the construction site. (Added. Ord. 
171-83, App. 4/8/83) 

SEC. 7. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS FOR 
CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS. 

The procedures, requirements, controls and 
standards in Sections 1006 through 100(5.8 of 
Article 10 of the City Planning Code shall apply 
to all applications for Certificates of Appropriate- 
ness in the Northeast Waterfront Historic: Dis- 
trict. In addition the following provisions shall 
apply to all such applications; in the event of any 
conflict or inconsistency between the following 
provisions and Article 10, those procedures, re- 
quirements, controls and standards affording 
stricter protection to landmarks, landmark sites 
and the Historic District shall prevail. 

(a) Character of the Historic District. 

The standards for review of all applications for 
Certificates of Appropriateness are set forth in 



1407 



Preservation of Historical, 
Architectural and Aesthetic Landmarks 



App. D, Sec. 7 



Section 1006.7 of Article 10. For purposes of 
review pursuant to these standards, the charac- 
ter of the historic district shall mean the exterior 
architectural features of the Northeast Water- 
front Historic District described in Section 6 of 
this ordinance. 

(b) Additional Standards for Certain 
Features. 

(1) Facade Line Continuity. Facade line 
continuity is historically appropriate. Therefore, 
setbacks and arcades, not generally being fea- 
tures of the Northeast Waterfront Historic Dis- 
trict, are not acceptable. 

(2) Fenestration and Design Elements 

for New Construction. In areas with a concen- 
tration of older brick buildings, new construction 
should reflect in design the predominant use of 
deeply recessed, limited fenestration. In addi- 
tion, verticality and a high proportion of mass to 
void should be incorporated. In areas character- 
ized by newer buildings in concrete or stucco 
with industrial-style fenestration, new construc- 
tion should reflect those design elements. 

(3) Roof Treatment. Historically the view 
from Telegraph Hill over the Northeast Water- 
front District has been one of roofs characterized 
by numerous regularly spaced industrial sky- 
lights. In renovation or new construction, these 
particular design features should be retained or 
incorporated. 

(4) Signs shall be governed by the appli- 
cable provisions of Article 6, section 609.14, and 
this Appendix D. In the event of inconsistency 
among these provisions, the most restrictive pro- 
vision shall prevail unless this Code specifically 
provides otherwise. 

(c) Exterior Changes Requiring Ap- 
proval. Exterior changes within the Northeast 
Waterfront Historic District shall require a Cer- 
tificate of Appropriateness pursuant to the pro- 
visions of Article 10 when such work requires a 
city permit. In addition, a Certificate of Appro- 
priateness shall be required for cleaning ma- 
sonry surfaces with abrasives and/or treatment 
of such surfaces with waterproofing chemicals. 
Sandblasting and certain chemical treatments 



detrimental to older brick will not be approved.

SEC. 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES, 

The Board of Supervisors hereby finds that 
the area known and described in this ordinance 
as Alamo Square Historic District contains a 
number of structures having a special character 
and special historical, architectural and aes- 
thetic interest and value and constitutes a dis- 
tinct section of the City. The Board of Supervi- 
sors further finds that designation of said area 
as an Historic District will be in furtherance of 
and in conformance with the purposes of Article 
10 of the City Planning Code and the standards 
set forth therein, and that preservation on an 
area basis rather than on the basis of individual 
structures alone is in order. 

This ordinance is intended to further the 
general purpose of historic preservation legisla- 
tion as set forth in Section 1001 of the City 
Planning Code, to promote the health, safety and 
general welfare of the public. (Added Ord. 324- 
84, App. 7/6/84) 

SEC. 2. DESIGNATION. 

Pursuant to Section 1004 of the City Plan- 
ning Code, Chapter II, Part II of the San Fran- 
cisco Municipal Code, the Alamo Square Historic 
District is hereby designated as an Historic Dis- 
trict, this designation having been duly approved 
by Resolution No. 9954 by the City Planning 
Commission. (Added Ord. 324-84, App, 7/6/84) 

SEC. 3. LOCATION AND BOUNDARIES. 

The location and boundaries of the Alamo 
Square Historic District shall be as designated 



on the Alamo Square Historic District Map, the 
original of which is on file with the Clerk of the 
Board of Supervisors under File 90-84-9, which 
Map is hereby incorporated herein as though 
fully set forth. (Added Ord. 324-84, App. 7/6/84) 

SEC. 4. RELATION TO CITY PLANNING 
CODE. 

(a) Article 10 of the City Planning Code is 
the basic law governing historic preservation in 
the City and County of San Francisco. This 
ordinance, being a specific application of Article 
10, is both subject to and in addition to the 
provisions thereof. 

(b) Except as may be specifically provided 
to the contrary in this ordinance, nothing In this 
ordinance shall supersede, impair or modify any 
City Planning Code provisions applicable to prop- 
erty in the Alamo Square Historic District, in- 
cluding but not limited to existing and future 
regulations controlling uses, height, bulk, lot 
coverage, floor area ratio, required open space, 
off-street parking and signs. (Added Ord. 324-84, 
App. 7/6/84) 

SEC. 5. STATEMENT OF 
SIGNIFICANCE. 

The Alamo Square Historic District is signifi- 
cant as a continuum of distinguished residential 
architecture by distinguished architects span- 
ning the period from the 1870&apos;s to the 1920&apos;s. The 
towered Westerfield House, the renowned &quot;Post- 
card Row&quot; with its background of the downtown 
skyline, and the neighboring streetscapes are as 
identified worldwide with San Francisco as the 
cable cars and Coit Tower. With a variety of 
architectural styles, the District is unified in its 
residential character, relatively small scale, con- 
struction type, materials (principally wood), in- 
tense ornamentation (especially at entry and 
cornice), and use of basements and retaining 
walls to adjust for hillside sites. Boundaries 
include the park, its edges, the nearby buildings 
rated highest on the City&apos;s architectural survey, 
and infill structures for rational planning. Most

of the original owner-residents were moderately 
successful businessmen. A higher than average 
percentage of the houses were designed by archi- 
tects, including a virtual cross-section of the 
City&apos;s better professionals. The District has al- 
ways housed a varied ethnic group. With a high 
degree of integrity to its original designs, the 
District clearly serves as a visual reminder of 
how businessmen lived two to four generations 
ago. (Added Ord. 324-84, App. 7/6/84) 

SEC. 6. FEATURES. 

The exterior architectural features of the 
said Historic District that should be preserved 
are described and depicted in the Landmark 
Preservation Advisory Board&apos;s case report with 
appendix titled &quot;Alamo Square Historic Dis- 
trict,&quot; adopted January 18, 1984, which is hereby 
incorporated herein and made a part hereof as 
though fully set forth. (Added Ord. 324-84, App. 
7/6/84)

SEC. 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 

The Board of Supervisors hereby finds that 
the area known and described in this ordinance 
as the Liberty-Hill Historic District contains a 
number of structures having a special character 
and special historical, architectural and aes- 
thetic interest and value and constitutes a dis- 
tinct section of the City. The Board of Supervi- 
sors further finds that designation of said area 
as an Historic District will be in furtherance of 
and in conformance with the purposes of Article 
10 of the City Planning Code and the standards 
set forth therein, and that preservation on an 
area basis rather than on the basis of individual 
structures alone is in order. 

This ordinance is intended to further the 
general purpose of historic preservation legisla- 
tion as set forth in Section 1004 of the City 
Planning Code, to promote the health, safety and 
general welfare of the public. (Added Ord. 484- 
85, App. .10/25/85) 

SEC. 2. DESIGNATION. 

Pursuant to Section 1004 of the City Plan- 
ning Code, Chapter II, Part II of the San Fran- 
cisco Municipal Code, the Liberty-Hill Historic 
District is hereby designated as an Historic Dis- 
trict, this designation having been duly approved 
by Resolution No. 10266 by the City Planning 
Commission. (Added Ord. 484-85, App. 10/25/85) 

SEC. 3. LOCATION AND BOUNDARIES. 

The location and boundaries of the Liberty- 
Hill Historic District shall be as designated on 



the Liberty-Hill Historic District Map, the origi- 
nal of which is on file with the Clerk of the board 
of Supervisors under File 90-85-2, w T hich Map is 
hereby incorporated herein as though fully set 
forth. (Added Ord. 484-85, App. 10/25/85) 

SEC. 4. RELATION TO CITY PLANNING 
CODE. 

(a) Article 10 of the City Planning Code is 
the basic law governing historic preservation in 
the City and County of San Francisco. This 
ordinance, being a specific application of Article 
10, is both subject to and in addition to the 
provisions thereof. 

(b) Except as may be specifically provided 
to the contrary in this ordinance, nothing in this 
ordinance shall supersede, impair or modify any 
City Planning Code provisions applicable to prop- 
erty in the Liberty-Hill Historic District, includ- 
ing but not limited to existing and future regu- 
lations controlling uses, height, bulk, lot coverage, 
floor area ratio, required open space, off street 
parking and signs. (Added Ord. 484-85, App. 
10/25/85) 

SEC. 5. STATEMENT OF 
SIGNIFICANCE. 

The Liberty-Hill Historic District is signifi- 
cant as an intact representation of nineteenth 
century middle class housing and developmental 
practices. It is one of the earliest residential 
&quot;suburbs&quot; to be developed in San Francisco, with 
major development: starting in the 1860s and 
continuing until the turn of the century. Since 
the fire following the 1906 earthquake was stopped 
at the Twentieth Street boundary of the District, 
the District contains examples of all architec- 
tural styles prevalent during the developmental 
period. 

The District&apos;s houses range in size from the 
small &quot;workingman&apos;s cottages&quot; on Lexington and 
San Carlos Streets, with their uniform facades 
and setbacks, to the individually built houses 
found, for example, on Liberty and Fair Oaks 
Streets, with varying architectural facades and 



Supp. No. 3, November/December 2006 



App. F, Sec, 5. 



San Francisco - Planning Code 



1414 



setbacks. While there are only a few &quot;grand&quot; 
houses in the District, a number were designed 
by architects well known in the Bay Area, includ- 
ing Albert Pissis, the Newsom brothers, Charles 
Shaner, William H. Toepke, Charles Havens, and 
Charles J. Rousseau. 

The &quot;suburban&quot; quality of the Liberty-Hill 
area is retained to this day It is enhanced by 
extensive street tree plantings and the very low 
incidence of commercial establishments in the 
residential areas. The great majority of District 
businesses are on Valencia Street, an historic 
and unifying commercial corridor, as compared 
to the typical San Francisco pattern of a grocery 
store or saloon on nearly every corner. 

The District is significant in its representa- 
tion of San Francisco development modes of the 
period. The San Francisco Homestead Union, the 
earliest such organization in the City, owned and 
subdivided one block in the District in the 1860s. 
The Real Estate Associates (TREA), the largest 
builder of speculative housing in San Francisco 
in the 1870&apos;s, developed Lexington and San 
Carlos Streets as well as a number of other sites 
in the District. Other blocks were purchased by 
real estate developers and sold lot by lot. 

The initial residents in the Liberty-Hill His- 
toric District comprised a mix of professionals, 
laborers and small scale entrepreneurs. There 
have been a number of famous residents and 
visitors to the District, including James Rolph, 
Jr., John Daly, Susan B. Anthony and Lotta 
Crabtree. In addition, the District is associated 
with both the last alcalde of San Francisco under 
Spanish sovereignty, Jose de Jesus Noe, and the 
first mayor under American rule, Washington 
Bartlett. 

Seventy percent of all the buildings in the 
District are Victorian, with 42 percent being 
Italianate, 20 percent Stick and eight percent 
Queen Anne. Of the buildings in the District, 
approximately x fo are architect designed. Over- 
all, 163, or over half of all buildings, are classi- 
fied as &quot;contributing&quot; to the Victorian character 
of the District, while 74 are &quot;potentially contrib- 
uting&quot; in that reversal of inappropriate alter- 



ations could restore the original character of the 
buildings. (Added Ord. 484-85, App. 10/25/85) 

SEC. 6. FEATURES. 

The exterior architectural features of the 
said Historic District that should be preserved 
are described and depicted in the Landmarks 
Preservation Advisory 7 Board&apos;s case report with 
appendix titled &quot;Liberty-Hill Historic District,&quot; 
adopted January 16, 1985, which is hereby in- 
corporated herein and made a part hereof as 
though fully set forth. (Added Ord. 484-85, App. 
10/25/85)

442-86, App. 11/13/86) 

SEC. 5. STATEMENT OF 
SIGNIFICANCE. 

Telegraph Hill is one of the most famous hills 
in the world, as well-known as Sugar Loaf in Rio 
de Janeiro, and a visual landmark to sailors 
entering the Bay since its European discovery by 
Capt. Juan Manuel de Ay a la in the San Carlos on 
August 5, 1.775. The second European to enter 
the Bay, Capt. George Vancouver in 1792, spe- 
cifically mentioned the fine anchorage he had 
between two promontories, one of which was 
Loma Alta, the original name for Telegraph Hill. 
Telegraph Hill is famous as &quot;the hill that&apos;s been 
around the world&quot; as great portions of it were 
blasted out for ballast in sailing ships, &quot;ulti- 
mately to be used to pave the streets of various 
exotic places&quot; (Lotchin). The Hill&apos;s present con- 
figuration is the historical expression of the 
ravages created by quarrying. The rock was used 



Supp. No. 3, November/December 2006 



App. G, Sec, 5. 



San Francisco - Planning Code 



1418 



not only for ballast, but also to build Gold Rush 
era warehouses (in a combination of brick and 
stone known as rubble), to fill the Bay for flat- 
lands east of the Hill, and to build the seawall 
which stabilized San Francisco&apos;s waterfront. The 
last quarrying occurred as late as 1914. 

The Historic District is a unique expression 
of the pattern of development which took place 
on the east slope of Telegraph Hill from 1850 to 
1939. Topographical constraints shaped the origi- 
nal settlement of the Hill. The difficulty of access 
on hillside and cliffs, and the proximity to the 
City&apos;s most active waterfront area first produced 
a community of waterfront workers housed in 
&quot;cloth lined&quot; shacks and modest vernacular Gothic 
Revival houses. Intact groupings of these build- 
ings remain within the District, and comprise 
the City&apos;s largest concentration of pre-1870 struc- 
tures. While other areas of the City experienced 
ongoing development through the nineteenth 
and early twentieth centuries, Telegraph Hill 
remained isolated. Bypassed by cablecar or street- 
car lines and with vehicular access limited to 
Union Street, infill residential construction from 
1870 — 1935 was limited to small-scale vernacu- 
lar construction stylistically comparable to the 
earliest development on the Hill. Due to the 
cliffside location, steps, wooden walkways and a 
hidden network of footpaths developed through- 
out the area. Street paving of Montgomery and 
Alta in 1931 and Union and Calhoun in 1939 — 
1940 improved general accessibility, and her- 
alded new development in the area. Low prop- 
erty values facilitated real estate development. 
Owners retained an array of architects who 
produced a collection of noteworthy and (then) 
innovative designs. Among these are Richard 
Neutra&apos;s International Style Kahn House at 
66—70 Calhoun Terrace (1939), and Irvine 
Goldstine&apos;s Art Moderne Malloch Apartment 
Building at 1360 Montgomery Street (1936). 
This change in style, scale and pattern of devel- 
opment punctuates the district&apos;s period of signifi- 
cance. 

The steep cliffs, a decisive factor in determin- 
ing the historic development pattern of the area, 
are a highly significant aesthetically important 
component defining the setting of the District. 



The abrupt changes in grade produce dramatic 
and unique vistas at points throughout the Dis- 
trict. Unimproved street rights-of-way are valu- 
able open spaces ranging in character from the 
well-tended, renowned Grace Marchant and 
Valetta&apos;s Gardens on Filbert and Greenwich 
Streets, to the rock-face cliffs of Green and 
Calhoun Streets. (Added by Ord. 442-86, App. 
11/13/86) 

SEC. 6. FEATURES. 

The architectural features of the said His- 
toric District that should be preserved are de- 
scribed and depicted in the Landmarks Preser- 
vation Advisory Board&apos;s case report with appendix 
titled &quot;Telegraph Hill Historic District,&quot; adopted 
August 7, 1985, as amended by the City Plan- 
ning Commission, which is hereby incorporated 
herein and made a part hereof as though fully set 
forth. (Added by Ord. 442-86, App. 11/13/86) 

SEC. 7. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS FOR 
CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS. 

The procedures, requirements, controls and 
standards in Sections 1005 through 1006.8 of 
Article 10 of the City Planning Code shall apply 
to all applications for Certificates of Appropriate- 
ness in the Telegraph Hill Historic District. In 
addition, the following provisions shall apply to 
all such applications; in the event of any conflict 
or inconsistency between the following provi- 
sions and Article 10, those procedures, require- 
ments, controls and standards affording stricter 
protection to the Historic District shall prevail. 

(a) Character of the Historic District. 

The standards for review of all applications for 
Certificates of Appropriateness are as set forth 
in Section 1006.7 of Article 10. For purposes of 
review- pursuant to said standards, the character 
of said Historic District shall mean the architec- 
tural features and historic open space of the 
Telegraph Hill Historic District referred to and 
described in Section 6 of this ordinance. 

(b) Height. Buildings should relate to the 
height of structures immediately adjacent and in 
the general area with the intent that the build- 



Supp. No. 3, November/December 2006

Preservation of Historical 
Architectural and Aesthetic Landmarks 



App. G, Sec. 7, 



ing should be contained within an envelope that 
slopes upward or downward with the slope of the 
property. 

(c) Alterations and New Construction. 

Alterations and new construction shall be com- 
patible with the nearby contributory buildings 
within the Historic District, and shall conform to 
the following provisions: 

(1) Style. New r construction in a contempo- 
rary idiom is encouraged, with specific regula- 
tion as follows: 

(a) Bay windows and porticos are not char- 
acteristic of the District, and are discouraged. 

(b) Porches and balconies are characteristic 
design features of the District, and are encour- 
aged. 

(c) Gable roof forms are encouraged. 

(d) The mass of new buildings should relate 
to the topographical contour of the site, and be 
compatible with adjacent buildings. 

(e) Horizontal rustic wood siding is the tra- 
ditional building material in the District, and its 
use is encouraged over other surfacing materi- 
als, including wood shingles. Masonry surfaces 
may be appropriate in subareas with a concen- 
tration of Art Moderne or International Style 
building. 

(f) Fenestration should be proportionate and 
in scale with traditional patterns within the 
District. Wooden sash is encouraged over alumi- 
num or other metal sash. 

(g) Detailing should relate to the simple, 
straightforward traditional vernacular forms 
found in the District. 

(2 ) Landscaping. All applications for Cer- 
tificates of Appropriateness for construction shall 
include landscaping plans for required yards, 
setbacks and areas counting toward useable open 
space requirements of Section 135 of the City 
Planning Code. All construction activities, such 
as but not limited to demolition, storage of con- 
struction materials, excavation, and application 
of concrete and other chemicals shall be con- 
ducted to minimize interference w-ith historic 
gardens in public rights-of-way and in historic 



gardens adjoining them. Fences shall not ob- 
struct views of private gardens abutting historic 
public rights-of-way. 

(3) Access. Access for demolition and/or 
construction shall utilize existing paths, steps 
and walkways. The project sponsor shall replace 
in kind and value any landscaping features on 
public space which may be damaged or destroyed 
by such activities. 

(d) Wooden Walkways and Steps. Exist- 
ing wooden steps on Filbert Street and board- 
walk on Napier Lane shall be maintained as 
unique contributors to the setting of the District. 

(e) Public Rights-of-Way. Unimproved sec- 
tions of public rights-of-way shall be treated as 
open space. In such spaces gardens are encour- 
aged: Ornamental gardens where the terrain 
slopes gently, and &quot;natural&quot; gardens elsewhere. 
Changes in the existing circulation patterns shall 
not be made except when such change is clearly 
preferable to provide for public safety. 

(f) Street Furniture. Street furniture in- 
cluding but not limited to lighting fixtures, trash 
receptacles, and benches shall require a Certifi- 
cate of Appropriateness. Such features shall 
complement the scale and character of the Dis- 
trict. 

(g) Demolition. Demolition of Contribu- 
tory and Contributory/Altered buildings shall be 
subject to the maximum controls allowed under 
Article 10 of the City Planning Code. A demoli- 
tion permit shall not be issued until all other 
required permits for new construction have been 
approved. No application for a demolition permit 
shall be deemed complete until all building per- 
mits for the replacement structure have been 
approved.* 

fh) Cliffs. Applications for Certificates of 
Appropriateness proposing new construction on 
lots located upon the cliff areas of the District 
shall conform to the following provisions: 

{ 1) Applications shall include geological stud- 
ies made by a licensed civil engineer whose 
principle practice area is rock mechanics. 

(2) At the hearing on the Certificate of 
Appropriateness pursuant to Sections 1006.2(b) 
and 1006.3, the Planning Commission shall de- 



Supp. No. 3, November/December 2006 



App. G, Sec. 7. 



San Francisco - Planning Code 



1420 



termine whether the construction proposed by 
the applicant will have a reasonable probability 
of endangering life, limb, or property due to 
landsliding or structural failure. The Planning 
Commission&apos;s determination shall be based upon 
the geological studies submitted by the applicant 
or any interested party, as well as based upon 
testimony from, but not limited to, geotechnical 
and structural engineers. 

(3) If the Planning Commission finds, based 
on the evidence presented at the hearing, that 
there is a reasonable probability that the pro- 
posed construction will endanger life, limb, or 
property of any person due to landsliding or 
structural failure, the Planning Commission shall 
disapprove the Certificate of Appropriateness. 

(4) If the Planning Commission determines 
that the proposed construction can be safely 
undertaken without endangering life, limb, or 
property of any person clue to landsliding or 
structural failure, the applicant shall take a 
&quot;soft&quot; approach to cliff retention, such as rock 
bolts and prestressed tendons, in order to pre- 
serve the integrity of the cliffs. 

(i) Significance of Individual Buildings 
to the Historic District. The history of each 
parcel within the Historic District is documented 
on the survey worksheets (Appendix A to the 
Telegraph Hill Historic District Case Report). 
Each building is assigned a finding from the 
three following categories: 

(1) Contributory. This category identifies 
buildings which date from the Historic District&apos;s 
period of significance and retain their historic 
integrity. These structures are of the highest 
importance in maintaining the character of the 



Historic District. The maximum suspension pe- 
riod allowable under Article 10 shall be imposed 
on applications for demolition of Contributory 
buildings. 

(2) Contributory/Altered. This category 
identifies buildings which date from the Historic 
District&apos;s period of significance but have had 
their historic integrity compromised by inappro- 
priate alterations. Appropriate restoration of such 
buildings is encouraged. The maximum suspen- 
sion period allowable under Article 10 shall be 
imposed on applications for demolition of Con- 
tributory/Altered buildings. If a building in this 
category were to be appropriately restored, the 
category designation may be amended to &quot;Con- 
tributory.&quot; 

(3) Noncontributory. This category iden- 
tifies buildings which postdate the Historic 
District&apos;s period of significance. Demolition per- 
mit applications for these buildings will be pro- 
cessed without reference to the suspension pro- 
visions of Article 10. Alterations to 
Noncontributory buildings would require Certifi- 
cate of Appropriateness review in order to mini- 
mize conflicts with the historic character of the 
District. (Added by Ord. 442-86, App. 11/13/86) 

* It is not the intent of this section to prohibit 
consideration and approval of permits for new 
construction and demolition on the property 
while it is subject to the demolition prohibition 
set forth herein. 

SEC. 8. PAINT COLOR. 

Nothing in this legislation shall be construed,

SEC. 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 

The Board of Supervisors hereby finds that 
the area known and described in this ordinance 
as the Blackstone Court Historic District con- 
tains a number of structures having a special 
character and special historical, architectural 
and aesthetic interest and value, and constitutes 
a distinct section of the City. The Board of 
Supervisors further finds that designation of 
said area as an Historic District will be in 
furtherance of and in conformance with the pur- 
poses of Article 10 of the City Planning Code and 
the standards set forth therein, and that preser- 
vation on an area basis rather than on the basis 
of individual structures alone is in order. 

This ordinance is intended to further the 
general purpose of historic preservation legisla- 
tion as set forth in Section 1001 of the City 
Planning Code, to promote the health, safety and 
general welfare of the public. (Added by Ord. 
464-87, App. 11/19/87) 

SEC. 2. DESIGNATION. 

Pursuant to Section 1004 of the City Plan- 
ning Code, Chapter IT, Part II of the San Fran- 
cisco Municipal Code, the Blackstone Court His- 
toric District is hereby designated as an Historic 
District, this designation having been duly ap- 
proved by Resolution No. 10997 of the City- 
Planning Commission. (Added by Ord. 464-87, 
App. 11/19/87) 

SEC. 3. LOCATION AND BOUNDARIES. 

The location and boundaries of the Black- 
stone Court Historic District shall be as desig- 



nated on the Blackstone Court Historic District 
Map, the original of which is on file with the 
Clerk of the Board of Supervisors under File 
115-87-13, which Map is hereby incorporated 
herein as though fully set forth. (Added by Ord. 
464-87, App. 11/19/87) 

SEC. 4. RELATION TO CITY PLANNING 
CODE. 

(A) Article 10 of the City Planning Code is 
the basic law governing historic preservation in 
the City and County of San Francisco. 

This ordinance, being a specific application of 
Article 10, is both subject to and in addition to 
the provisions thereof. 

(B) Except as may be specifically provided 
to the contrary in this ordinance, nothing in this 
ordinance shall supersede, impair or modify any- 
City Planning Code provisions applicable to prop- 
erty in the Blackstone Court Historic District, 
including but not limited to existing and future 
regulations controlling uses, height, bulk, lot 
coverage, floor area ratio, required open space, 
off-street parking and signs. (Added by Ord. 
464-87, App. 11/19/87) 

SEC. 5. STATEMENT OF 
SIGNIFICANCE. 

The significance of Blackstone Court Historic 
District is more historical than architectural, 
though enough physical evidence of past history 
remains to create a sense of the former place and 
time in this unusual mid-block enclave of five 
structures on a blind alley. The north line of the 
ally, Blackstone Court, follows the north line of 
an early trail shown on U.S. Coast Survey maps 
of the 1850&apos;s and 1860&apos;s, a trail that ran from 
town toward the Presidio, around the north end 
of Washerwoman&apos;s Lagoon (now drained and 
filled; so named for the Gold Rush laundries). 
The western end of Blackstone Court is the 
western edge of William Eddy&apos;s 1849 Lagoon 
Survey which set up a grid parallel to Market 
Street, facing the view through the Golden Gate. 
On a lot alignment perpendicular to the north

edge of the old trail, 9-11 Blackstone Court 
appears to date from the 1850&apos;s because of its 
Gothic Revival veranda and its interior plan and 
finish. It is first documented on its site in 1893 
(possibly moved to clear a street right-of-way 
designated by the Laguna Survey of 1889-91). 
Before 1899 it was raised a story by the Favilla 
family from North Beach, very early Italian- 
American residents in what became the Marina 
District. Abraham House, 30 Blackstone Court, 
was constructed in 1885 by Charles Abraham, 
and enlarged by him in 1905. Abraham was the 
horticulturally significant founder of Western 
Nursery, which operated on most of this block 
from 1885 to 1947. It was the last expression of 
the Cow Hollow/Marina District agricultural en- 
terprises. An Australian peppermint tree and a 
Monterey Cypress appear to date from the nurs- 
ery. All of these elements combine to present a 
unique physical expression of the pre-1906 settle- 
ment patterns of this section of the City: the 
pre-Gold Rush trail, the lot lines perpendicular 
to it, the nursery, the modest old houses and 
early, pre-1900 Italian-American investment in 
the Marina District. (Added by Ord. 464-87, App. 
11/19/87) 

SEC. 6. FEATURES. 

The architectural features of the said His- 
toric District that should be preserved are de- 
scribed and depicted in the Landmarks Preser- 
vation Advisory Board&apos;s case report with appendix 
titled &quot;Blackstone Court Historic District,&quot; adopted 
June 4, 1986, which is hereby incorporated herein 
and made a part hereof as though fully set forth. 
(Added by Ord. 464-87, App. 11/19/87&quot;) 

SEC. 7. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS FOR 
CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS. 

The procedures, requirements, controls and 
standards in Sections 1005 through 1006.8 of 
Article 10 of the City Planning Code shall apply 
to all applications for Certificates of Appropriate- 
ness in the Blackstone Court Historic District. 

In addition, the following provisions shall 
apply to all such applications; in the event of any 
conflict or inconsistency between the following 
provisions and Article 10, those procedures, re- 



quirements, controls and standards affording 
stricter protection to the Historic District shall 
prevail. 

(A) Character of the Historic District. 

The standards for review of all applications for 
Certificates of Appropriateness are as set forth 
in Section 1006.7 of Article 10. For purposes of 
review pursuant to said standards, the character 
of said Historic District shall mean the architec- 
tural features and historic street and lot lines, 
freestanding buildings, and low scale and inten- 
sity of development of the Blackstone Court 
Historic District. 

(B) Alterations to Contributory and Con- 
tributory/Altered Buildings. Alterations to Con- 
tributory and Contributory/Altered buildings shall 
be compatible with the architectural and historic 
fabric of the building. New construction shall be 
compatible with the character of the historic 
district defined in Section 7(A) above, including 
but not limited to materials, fenestration, scale, 
bulk, detailing and intensity of development. 

Alterations or new construction shall main- 
tain and enhance existing visual access to the 
historic buildings in the district. 

(C) Landscaping. All applications for Cer- 
tificates of Appropriateness for construction shall 
include landscaping plans for required yards, 
setbacks and areas counting toward usable open 
space requirements of Section 135 of the City 
Planning Code. All construction activities, such 
as but not limited to demolition, storage of con- 
struction materials, excavation, and application 
of concrete and other chemicals shall be con- 
ducted so as to minimize interference with gar- 
dens. 

(D) Street Furniture. Street furniture in- 
cluding but not limited to lighting fixtures, trash 
receptacles, and benches shall require a Certifi- 
cate of Appropriateness. Such features shall 
complement the scale and character of the dis- 
trict. 

(E) Demolition. Demolition of Contribu- 
tory and Contributory/ Altered buildings shall be 
subject to the maximum controls allowed under 
Article 10 of the City Planning Code. A demoli- 
tion permit shall not be issued until all other 



Supp. No. 3, November/December 2006 



1425 



Preservation of Historical 
Architectural and Aesthetic Landmarks 



App. H, Sec. 8. 



required permits for new construction have been 
approved, except in situations considered unsafe 
or dangerous pursuant to Section 1007 of Article 
10 of the City Planning Code. No applications for 
a demolition permit shall be deemed complete 
until all building permits for the replacement 
structure have been approved. 

(F) Significance of Individual Build- 
ings to the Historic District. The history of 
each parcel within the historic district is docu- 
mented on the survey worksheets (Appendix A to 
the Blackstone Court Historic District Case Re- 
port). 

Each building is assigned a finding from the 
three following categories: 

(1) Contributory. This category identifies 
buildings which date from the historic district&apos;s 
period of significance and retain their historic 
integrity. These structures are of the highest 
importance in maintaining the character of the 
historic district. The maximum suspension pe- 
riod allowable under Article 10 shall be imposed 
on applications for demolition of Contributory 
buildings. 



(2) Contributory/Altered. This category 
identifies buildings which date from the historic 
district&apos;s period of significance but have had 
their historic integrity compromised by inappro- 
priate alterations. 

Appropriate restoration of such buildings is 
encouraged. The maximum suspension period 
allowable under Article 10 shall be imposed on 
applications for demolition of Contributory/ 
Altered buildings. If a building in this category 
were to be appropriately restored, the category 
designation may be amended to Contributory. 

(3) Noncontributory. This category iden- 
tifies buildings which post-date the historic 
district&apos;s period of significance. Demolition per- 
mit applications for these buildings will be pro- 
cessed without reference to the suspension pro- 
visions of Article 10. Alterations to 
Noncontributory buildings would require Certifi- 
cate of Appropriateness review in order to mini- 
mize conflicts with the historic character of the 
district. (Added by Ord. 464-87, App. 11/19/87) 

SEC. 8. PAINT COLOR. 

Nothing in this legislation shall be construed 
to regulate paint colors within the District. (Added 
by Ord. 464-87, App. 11/19/87)

Map is hereby incorporated as though fully set- 
forth. (Added &quot;by Ord. 104-90, App. 3/23/90)&quot; 

SEC. 4. RELATION TO CITY PLANNING 
CODE AND REDEVELOPMENT PLAN 
FOR THE RINCON POINT-SOUTH BEACH 
PROJECT AREA. 

(a) Article 10 of the City Planning Code is 
the basic law governing historic preservation in 
the City and County of San Francisco. This 
ordinance, being a specific application of Article 
10, is both subject to and in addition to the 
provisions thereof. 

(b) Except as may be specifically provided 
to the contrary in the ordinance, nothing in this

trict. (Added by Ord. 104-90, App. 3/23/90) 

SEC. 5. STATEMENT OF 
SIGNIFICANCE. 

(a) History of the area: For decades after 
the 1849 Gold Rush, San Francisco was the 
principal seaport and connection with the out- 
side world for California and the West Coast. 
San Francisco&apos;s expansion and transformation 
into one of the most important cities in North

America is attributable to the eminence of its 
port which, because of its sheltered location and 
deep water, became one of the best-suited on the 
Pacific Ocean. 

The development of warehouses over a 120- 
year period along the southern waterfront pro- 
vides a benchmark from which to view architec- 
tural and technological responses to the rapid 
changes of growing industrial nation state and 
city. The interdependence of architecture and 
history can be seen from a look at the evolution 
of warehouse forms along the southern water- 
front. Unlike most other areas of the San Fran- 
cisco waterfront, the South End District contains 
an extraordinary concentration of buildings from 
almost every period of San Francisco&apos;s maritime 
history. Several street fronts — such as Second, 
Third and Townsend — are characterized by solid 
walls of brick and reinforced concrete ware- 
houses. With this harmony of scale and materi- 
als, the South End Historic District is clearly a 
visually recognizable place. 

One-story warehouses were common in the 
nineteenth century but rare in the early twenti- 
eth due to the increasing cost of land. Two of the 
oldest warehouses in the historic district are one 
story in height: Hooper&apos;s Warehouse (1874) and 
the California Warehouse (1882). Their horizon- 
tal orientation is accentuated through the use of 
strong cornice lines with decorative brick pat- 
terns. 

Multi-story buildings have been more com- 
mon along the southern waterfront since the 
turn of the century. After 1906, almost all new 
warehouses were constructed to be at least three 
stories in height, and several warehouses on 
Second and Townsend Streets reached six sto- 
ries. The invention of the forklift in the 1930s 
eliminated advantages which multi-story build- 
ings enjoyed over single-story structures. Since 
1945, almost all warehouses constructed in the 
United States have been one story in height. 
Many multi-story warehouses and industrial 
buildings have been converted to other uses or 
are vacant because they have become obsolete 
for most warehouse or industrial functions. 



South End&apos;s period of historical significance, 
1867 to 1935, comprises the era during which the 
waterfront became a vital part of the City&apos;s and 
nation&apos;s maritime commerce. The buildings of 
the South End Historic District represent a rich 
and varied cross-section of the prominent local 
architects and builders of the period. Four build- 
ings remain from the nineteenth century; an- 
other four were constructed in the six-year inter- 
val preceding the 1906 earthquake. The majority 
of the buildings were erected between 1906 and 
1929, a period during which trade along the 
waterfront increased dramatically. 

Several events shaped this part of San Fran- 
cisco. The building of Long Bridge in 1865 on the 
line of Fourth Street south to Point San Quentin 
or the Potrero district, opened up opportunities 
for new industrial development in the southern 
part of the city. The Second Street cut of 1869, 
through fashionable Rincon Hill, allowed access 
from downtown to the southern waterfront. The 
completion of the transcontinental railroad in 
1869 (and the eventual extension of railway lines 
into the area) was the single most important 
event to impact the district. The fire of 1906 and 
the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914 were 
further impetuses to warehouse construction in 
this area, as were the seawall and the Belt Line 
Railway. 

Prominent figures in San Francisco history 
have been associated with the district. William 
Ralston, founder of the Bank of California, builder 
of the Palace Hotel, and financier of San Fran- 
cisco and the West, owned property in the dis- 
trict and was a major force in politically engi- 
neering the Second Street cut in 1869. William 
Sharon, a U.S. Senator from Nevada in 1875 — 
1881, acquired much of Ralston&apos;s estate arid also 
co-owned and built the California Warehouse on 
the corner of Second and Townsend for Haslett 
and Bailey in 1882. 

William P. Aspinwall founded the internation- 
ally important Oriental Warehouse (Pacific Mail 
Steamship Company) in this district during the 
Gold Rush. John Hooper built Hooper&apos;s South 
End Grain Warehouse at Japan and Townsend 
Streets in 1874 for California&apos;s lucrative grain

trade. Hooper was a member of a family known 
particularly for its lumber trade, with large land 
holdings just south of the South End Historic 
District. 

The leading warehouse firms in San Fran- 
cisco were those of the Haslett and Lamb fami- 
lies. Samuel Haslett, a native of Ireland, came to 
San Francisco in the 1870s and became a part- 
ner with J.W. Cox at the Humboldt Warehouse 
on Rincon Point. Haslett&apos;s sons continued the 
business after his death, and Samuel Haslett IV 
is now president of the firm. Once nationally 
known in warehousing, the Hasletts built or are 
associated with seven warehouses in the district. 
George Lamb founded the South End Warehouse 
Company in 1905, and later co-founded the dray- 
age and hauling firm of King and Company. 
South End operated six warehouses in the area 
at various times. 

Charles Lee Tiiden (1857—1950) built 111— 
113 Townsend, a Haslett warehouse, and the 
Overland warehouse at Third and Tbwnsend 
Streets. Tiiden, a highly successful business en- 
trepreneur, also founded the East Bay Regional 
Park system in 1934. Charles Norton Feiton 
(1828 — 1914), Senator, Congressman, and early 
developer of oil in California, is associated with 
warehouses at 275 Brannan Street and 601 
Second Street. 

The proposed historic district is an important 
visual landmark for the City as a w r hole. The 
large number of intact masonry warehouses which 
remain to this day are reminders of the maritime 
and rail activities w r hich helped to make San 
Francisco a great Turn-of-the-Century Port City. 
The warehouse district, because of its distinct 
building forms, is identifiable from many parts of 
San Francisco and the greater Bay Area. Addi- 
tional historical information may be found in the 
South End Historic District Case Report No. 
89.065L. (Added by Ord. 104-90, App. 3/23/90) 

SEC. 6. FEATURES. 

(a) Features of Existing Buildings. 

1. Overall Form and Continuity. Build- 
ing height is generally within a six-story range, 
and many of the oldest structures are one or two 
stories in height. 



2. Scale and Proportion. The buildings 
are of typical warehouse design, large in bulk, 
often with large arches and openings originally 
designed for easy vehicular access. There is a 
regularity of overall form. The earlier brick struc- 
tures blend easily with the scaled-down Beaux 
Arts forms of the turn of the century and the 
plain reinforced concrete structures characteris- 
tic of twentieth-century industrial architecture. 

3. Fenestration. The earliest structures 
have few windows, expressing their warehouse 
function. They are varied in size, rhythmically 
spaced, deeply recessed, produce a strong shadow 
line, and relate in shape and proportion to those 
in nearby buildings. Larger industrial sash win- 
dows began to be incorporated in structures built 
from the 1920s and onward. Door openings are 
often massive to facilitate easy access of bulk 
materials. 

4. Materials. Standard brick masonry is 
predominant for the oldest buildings in the dis- 
trict, with reinforced concrete introduced after 
the 1906 fire, although its widespread use did 
not occur until the 1920s. Brick and stone paving 
treatments on Federal and First and De Boom 
Streets respectively are extant as well as Belt- 
line Railroad Tracks which run throughout the 
District. 

5. Color. Red brick is typical, with some 
yellow and painted brick. Muted earth tones 
predominate in shades of red, brown, green, gray 
and blue. 

6. Texture. Typical facing materials give a 
rough textured appearance. The overall texture 
of the facades is rough grained. 

7. Detail. Arches are common at the ground 
floor, and are frequently repeated on upper floors. 
Flattened arches for window treatment are typi- 
cal. Cornices are simple and generally tend to be 
abstract versions of the more elaborate cornices 
found in downtown commercial structures from 
the nineteenth century. Most of the surfaces of 
the later buildings are plain and simple reflect- 
ing their function. Some of the earlier brick work 
contains suggestions of pilasters, again highly 
abstracted. Where detail occurs, it is often found 
surrounding entryways.

(b ) Standards for New Construction and 
Alterations. 

1. Facade Line Continuity, Facade line 
continuity is historically appropriate. Therefore, 
setbacks at lower floors and arcades, not gener- 
ally being features of the South End Historic 
District, are generally not acceptable. 

2. Fenestration and Design Elements 

for New Construction. In areas with a concen- 
tration of buildings characterized by a high pro- 
portion of mass to void and deeply recessed 
openings, vertical orientation and limited fenes- 
tration, the design of new construction should 
relate to those elements. In areas characterized 
by buildings with industrial style fenestration, 
new construction should relate to those design 
elements. 

3. Signs. 

(A) Principal Signs. Only one sign will be 
allowed per establishment per street frontage. A 
flush sign with lettering intended to be read from 
across the street is permitted. On brick surfaces, 
signs should be mounted with a minimum num- 
ber of penetrations of the wall, and those pen- 
etrations only in the mortar joints. 

(B) Secondary Signs. One per establish- 
ment per street frontage. A secondary sign is 
intended to be viewed close-up and consists of: 
(a) Lettering on a door or window which contains 
only the name and nature of the establishment, 
hours of operation and other pertinent informa- 
tion, (b) A projecting sign not exceeding two 
square feet in area used in conjunction with a 
principal flush sign. 

(c) Exterior Changes Requiring Ap- 
proval. Any exterior change within the South 
End Historic District shall require a Certificate 
of Appropriateness pursuant to the provisions of 
Article 10 when such work requires a city per- 
mit. In addition, a Certificate of Appropriateness 
shall be required for cleaning masonry surfaces 
with abrasives and/or treatment of such surfaces 
with waterproofing chemicals. Sandblasting and 
certain chemical treatments detrimental to older 
brick will not be approved. (Added by Ord. 104- 
90, App. 3/23/90) 



SEC. 7. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS FOR 
CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS. 

The procedures, requirements, controls and 
standards in Sections 1006 through 1006.8 of 
Article 10 of the City Planning Code shall apply 
to all applications for Certificates of Appropriate- 
ness in the South End Historic District. I:a addi- 
tion the following provisions shall apply to all 
such applications; in the event of any conflict or 
inconsistency between the following provisions 
and Article 10, those procedures, requirements, 
controls and standards affording stricter protec- 
tion to landmarks, landmark sites and the His- 
toric District shall prevail. 

(a) Character of the Historic District. 

The standards for review of all applications for 
the Certificate of Appropriateness are set forth 
in Section 1006.7 of Article 10. For purposes of 
review pursuant to these standards, the charac- 
ter of the historic district shall mean the exterior 
architectural features as well as the historic 
brick and stone paving materials described in 
Section 6 of this ordinance. 

(b) New Construction. New construction 
on vacant sites should conform to the general 
profile of the District, especially as to scale, 
sculptural qualities of facade and entrance de- 
tailing, fenestration patterns and materials de- 
scribed in Section 6 of this ordinance. 

(c) Masonry, Brickwork and Ston€&gt;work. 

A Certificate of Appropriateness shall be re- 
quired for painting previously unpainted ma- 
sonry, brick or stone exterior surfaces, for clean- 
ing such surfaces with abrasives and/or treatment 
of such surfaces with waterproofing chemicals. 
Sandblasting and certain chemical treatment 
detrimental to masonry will not be approved. 

(d) Alterations. It is recognized that cer- 
tain alterations to the exteriors of buildings 
within the Historic District may be necessary in 
order to accommodate adaptive reuse of, and to 
provide sufficient light and air in, such build- 
ings. Substantial alterations to principal fa- 
cades, as defined in Planning Code Section 102.21, 
should be discouraged. Substantial alterations to 
non-principal facades, not originally intended to

be viewed from the street, may be appropriate, 
provided such alterations maintain the charac- 
ter of the historic district. 

(e) 200 Brannan Street, Lot 24 within 
Assessor&apos;s Block 3774 is a site proposed for high- 
density mixed-income housing within the Rincon 
Point-South Beach Redevelopment Project Area 
Plan. The subject property is a donut-shaped 
group of buildings of different dates behind a 
single unifying wall and the continuous facade 
wall which runs along the First and Brannan 
Streets is the contributory element of the site 
and adaptive reuse of the subject property is 
acceptable. (Added by Ord. 104-90, App. 3/23/90)

BUILDINGS TO THE HISTORIC 
DISTRICT. 

The history of each parcel within the Historic 
District is documented on the survey worksheets 
(Appendix A to the South End Historic District 
Case Report No. 89.065L). This classification of 
buildings in the South End Historic District is 
delineated in Case Report No. 89.065L. Each 
building is designated as one of the following: 

1. Contributory. This category identifies 
buildings which date from the Historic District&apos;s 
period of significance and retain their historic 
integrity. These structures are of the highest 
importance in maintaining the character of the 
Historic District. 



2. Contributory — Altered. This category 
identifies buildings which date from the historic 
district&apos;s period of significance but have had 
their historic integrity compromised by inappro- 
priate alterations. Appropriate restoration of such 
buildings is encouraged. If a building in this 
category were to be appropriately restored, the 
category designation may be amended by the 
L.P.A.B. to &quot;Contributory.&quot; 

3. Noncontributory. This category identi- 
fies buildings which are outside the Historic 
District&apos;s period of significance or are so signifi- 
cantly altered that they have lost their integrity. 
A Certificate of Appropriateness shall not be 
required for demolition of a noncontributory build- 
ing. Construction of new buildings on a demol- 
ished building site, additions to, and major alter- 
ations of noncontributory buildings should be 
compatible with the character of the Historic 
District, and w r ould require a Certificate of Ap- 
propriateness in order to ensure compatibility 
with the character of the historic district. (Added 
by Ord. 104-90, App. 3/23/90) 

SEC. 9. PAINT COLOR. 

Nothing in this legislation shall be construed 
as authorization to regulate paint colors used 
within the District. (Added by Ord. 104-90, App. 
3/23/90)

SEC. 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 

The Board of Supervisors hereby finds that 
the area known and described in this ordinance 
as the Civic Center Historic District contains a 
number of structures having a special character 
and special historical, architectural and aes- 
thetic interest and value, and constitutes a dis- 
tinct section of the City. The Board of Supervi- 
sors further finds that designation of said area 
as an Historic District will be in furtherance of 
and in conformance with the purposes of Article 
10 of the City Planning Code and the standards 
set forth therein, and that preservation on an 
area basis rather than on the basis of individual 
structures alone is in order. 



This ordinance is intended to further the 
general purpose of historic preservation legisla- 
tion as set forth in Section 1001 of the City 
Planning Code, to promote the health, safety and 
general welfare of the public. (Added by Ord. 
413-94, App. 12/23/94) 

SEC. 2. DESIGNATION. 

Pursuant to Section 1004 of the City Plan- 
ning Code, Chapter II, Part II of the San Fran- 
cisco Municipal Code, the San Francisco Civic 
Center Historic District is hereby designated as 
an Historic District, this designation having been 
duly approved by Resolution No. 13719 of the 
City Planning Commission and Resolution No. 
454 of the Landmarks Preservation Advisory 
Board. (Added by Ord. 413-94, App. 12/23/94) 

SEC. 3. LOCATION AND BOUNDARIES. 

The location and boundaries of the San Fran- 
cisco Civic Center Historic District generally 
bounded by Golden Gate Avenue to the north, 
Franklin Street to the west, Jones Street to the 
east and Market Street to the south shall be as

erty in the San Francisco Civic Center Historic 
District, including but not limited to existing and 
future regulations controlling uses, height, bulk, 
lot coverage, floor area ratio, required open space, 
off-street parking and signs. (Added by Ord. 
413-94, App. 12/23/94) 

SEC. 5. STATEMENT OF 
SIGNIFICANCE. 

The San Francisco Civic Center possesses a 
unique place and significance in the areas of 
architecture, history, and environment worthy of 
protection as an historic district. 

The land on which the Civic Center stands 
was declared a City Hall Reservation as early as 
1870. Portions of that reservation land were sold 
to raise funds for City Hall construction, and Old 
City Hall — located on the site that had first been 
used as the Yerba Buena Cemetery, approxi- 
mately where the present library stands — was 
erected between 1871 and 1897, in a lengthy 
project marked by the now well known City 
government corruption of that time. 

In 1899, B.J.S. Cahill, with the encourage- 
ment of Mayor Phelan, proposed a grander vi- 
sion for the area, with the dual goal of clearing 
up land titles clouded by the dubious practices of 
the promoters of the Old City Hall and, at the 
same time, of creating an imposing setting for 
the entire area. This plan envisioned clearing 
out smaller structures and visually uniting the 
remaining monumental structures — Old City Hall, 
the Main Post Office, the Hibernia Bank build- 
ing, and other larger structures — and setting 
them off against new open spaces (such as a 
planned extension of the Golden Gate Park pan- 
handle to Market Street). Conflicting new devel- 
opments were blocked for a time, but the plan 
eventually failed, in large part because of gen- 
eral distrust — bred of experience, perhaps — of 
large government projects. 

Undaunted, former Mayor Phelan soon led 
the formation of an Association for the Improve- 
ment and Adornment of San Francisco. In 1904, 
the Association invited Daniel Burnham to de- 
sign a grand plan for the City, with B.J.S. Cahill 
providing a design for the Civic Center. This 



produced two visions of the Civic Center: Cahill, 
with the practicality borne of personal and local 
experience, proposed using existing structures 
and City-owned land to create a central plaza, 
surrounded by major buildings, and, again, con- 
nected to a Golden Gate Park panhandle exten- 
sion; Burnham proposed a grander Civic Center, 
with buildings connected by a generally circular 
series of boulevards and grand open vistas. The 
Burnham Plan, though politically impractical, 
fired the public imagination and was submitted 
to and adopted by the Board of Supervisors on 
September 27, 1905. 

Following the 1906 earthquake, the public 
desire to rebuild and reclaim what had just been 
lost confirmed in practice what Cahill had per- 
ceived before: that political expediency set limits 
to the definition of the Civic Center. Competition 
continued between the different views of Burn- 
ham and Cahill of what the Civic Center might 
become, but by 1912 the Board of Supej&apos;visors 
had endorsed the Cahill Plan as modified in 
1909. The momentum of growing civic pride and 
the Civic Center development effort — spear- 
headed by then-Mayor Rolph and the coming of 
the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition — was fo- 
cused into the general outlines sketched by Ca- 
hill. 

Mayor Rolph, a reform candidate, selw the 
Civic Center as a central civic improvement, the 
symbol of a new unity of the people under a new 
and honest political era and a permanent expres- 
sion of the grandeur and vitality which the 1915 
Exposition would exemplify on a temporary scale. 

The World Columbian Exposition in Chicago, 
in 1893, was the source of inspiration for the 
&quot;City Beautiful&quot; movement which emphasizes 
formal plan and composition of monumental scale, 
neoclassical style buildings fronting plazas, bou- 
levards and grand public gathering spaces. The 
order, harmony, cleanliness, and grandeur of the 
exhibition, called &quot;The White City,&quot; was in sharp 
contrast to the rapid, chaotic growth that most 
U.S. cities had experienced in the preceding era 
of rapid immigration and industrialization. 

Several world&apos;s fairs were held throughout 
the country in the later 1800&apos;s, spreading the 



1435 



Preservation of Historical 
Architectural and Aesthetic Landmarks 



App. J, Sec. 5. 



ideals of classical architecture, Beaux Arts forms, 
and the concepts of planning and cooperation for 
ensemble effect in design. These planning and 
design schemes were an important influence for 
forty years, with their primary manifestation 
coming in designs for cities, parks, and civic 
centers. Numerous City plans were commis- 
sioned in the early years, but only Cleveland and 
San Francisco implemented a portion of their 
plans, with San Francisco more nearly reaching 
completion. 

The historic significance of the &quot;City Beauti- 
ful&quot; movement lies in the manner in which it 
reformed and refocused architectural vision, con- 
tributing to something of a national style of 
architecture; and, on a practical level, in the 
formation of City Planning Departments and 
schools or courses devoted to City Planning. 

The design of the San Francisco Civic Center 
is an example of the development of those sig- 
nificant contributions. More particularly, the San 
Francisco Civic Center is an expression of a 
nation ready to display its new international 
importance in an architectural statement. At the 
time it took form, geography and historical events 
had made San Francisco the center of western 
America. Monumental classical architecture for 
the City&apos;s central public space expressed this 
consciousness, as well as the accompanying be- 
lief that such inspiring surroundings should be 
democratically available to all, not just a privi- 
leged few. 

The Exposition Auditorium, the Central Plaza, 
and the Powerhouse were completed before the 
1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition, and the new 
City Hall was completed in late 1915. The library 
was completed in 1916; the State Building in 
1921; and the Public Health Building in 1932 
and the Old Federal Building in 1936. The present 
Opera House and Veterans Building expanded 
the Civic Center to the west in 1932 and 1933, 
respectively, much in the manner the original 
proponents envisioned. The original plaza was 
excavated in 1956 to add the underground park- 
ing garage. At this time the ground level details 
were changed into the present reflecting pool 
and semi-park. United Nations Plaza, which 



opens the vista to the east of City Hall in a 
manner consistent with the original vision of the 
Civic Center, was created in the mid-1970&apos;s. 

It is an exemplary City Beautiful complex in 
the best of the American Academic Beaux Arts 
tradition. Designed and built in the revival of 
classical style, stemming from the Chicago World&apos;s 
Fair of 1893 that has been called the &quot;American 
Renaissance,&quot; it succeeds in making a strong 
impression of Civic dignity and pride. The San 
Francisco Civic Center Historic District consists 
of a principal aggregation of monumental build- 
ings around a central open space, with addi- 
tional buildings extending the principal axis at 
either end. It includes all or part of the fifteen 
City blocks. There are eight major buildings, a 
group of secondary buildings, three unrealized 
building sites, and a large plaza within the 
Historic District. 

Each building in the Civic Center was faced 
with the problem of providing modern, func- 
tional facilities in a classical idiom. The classical 
Beaux Arts style was deemed suitable as the 
traditional style of American governmental build- 
ings, and was amenable to City Beautiful ideals 
of harmony among many buildings on a grand 
scale. The formal composition of &quot;City Beautiful&quot; 
architecture, plantings, street embellishments 
and plazas was meant to be an expression of civic 
authority and pride — intending to impress and 
overawe. The classical style aptly expressed the 
mood of a nation eager to redefine its newly 
achieved international importance in architec- 
tural terms. It reflected a mood and an existing 
state of affairs as much as an inspiration to 
dominance. In San Francisco, it represented the 
city&apos;s emergence as a regional center of national 
importance, and within the City, it symbolized 
the united efforts of a population recently di- 
vided along many lines. 

In terms of &quot;democratic&quot; architecture, or ar- 
chitecture for an ever larger segment of the 
population, monumental classical architecture 
uncompromisingly demonstrated the enhanced 
concern for the general public. Only a few years 
earlier, such splendor was exclusively reserved 
for the rich and the privileged few. To this day, no

1436 



greater public interiors have been built in the 
United States than those influenced by and 
representative of the City Beautiful Movement, 
including among the very finest, the San Fran- 
cisco City Hall. 

Within the scope of turn of the century clas- 
sical architecture in the United States, the San 
Francisco Civic Center contains several fine ex- 
amples of the mode and one superlative example 
in its City Hall. The other buildings in the group, 
although less interesting individually cannot prop- 
erly be evaluated in the same way. In particular, 
the State Building, the Federal Building, the 
Health Building and the War Memorial group 
would probably appear rather dull compared to 
City Hall, as if they were missing an essential 
ingredient. But seen in the context of the Civic 
Center as a whole, and in relation to City Hall, 
all the buildings together achieve distinction. 

The criteria on which the buildings are judged, 
then, must be the degree to which each enhances 
the group without distracting from City Hall. 
These qualities are achieved through a harmony 
of color, material, scale, size, texture, rhythm 
and style. Within these constrictions the build- 
ings achieve individual interest through the imagi- 
native manipulation of the elements. 

The historic Civic Center buildings are uni- 
fied in the Beaux Arts classical design. They are 
organized into horizontal bands of vertically pro- 
portioned elements, with the grand order of the 
facade displayed on two or three floors above a 
usually rusticated base of one or two ground and 
partially sub-ground floors. Civic Center His- 
toric District contains standard features such as 
overall form, massing, scale, proportion, orienta- 
tion, depth of face, fenestration and ornamenta- 
tion, materials, color, texture, architectural de- 
tailing, facade line continuity, decorative and 
sculptural features, street furniture, granite curb- 
ing and grille work. 

The Civic Center is designated as both a 
National Historic Landmark District and a His- 
toric District on the National Register of Historic 
Places, the former designation occurred on Feb- 
ruary 27, 1987, the latter, October 10, 1978. 
These designations offer recognition that certain 



properties within the Historic District are wor- 
thy of preservation and alterations undertaken 
both in the local and federal districts shall com- 
ply with the Secretary of the Interior&apos;s Stan- 
dards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. 
Said Standards were adopted by the Landmarks 
Preservation Advisory Board at its Regular Meet- 
ing of October 2, 1985, the amended Standards 
were readopted by the Landmarks Board at its 
Regular Meetings of February 6, 1991 and Au- 
gust 3, 1994. (Added by Ord. 413-94, App. 12/23/ 
94) 

SEC. 6. FEATURES. 

The architectural features of said Eistoric 
District that should be preserved are set f Drth in 
this ordinance and described and depicted in the 
Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board&apos;s Case 
Report &quot;San Francisco Civic Center Historic Dis- 
trict&quot; including Appendix A: Survey of Parcels. 
Said Case Report was adopted by the Land- 
marks Preservation Advisory Board at its Regu- 
lar Meeting of October 6, 1993 by Resolution No. 
454 and was adopted and amended by the City 
Planning Commission at its Regular Meeting of 
July 7, 1994 by Resolution No. 13719. The archi- 
tectural features, formal plan composition and 
streetscape elements of said Historic District 
that should be preserved and strengthened are 
also identified in the Civic Center Plan, an 
Element of the City&apos;s Master Plan, and in the 
Civic Center Urban Design Guidelines adopted 
by the Planning Commission pursuant to that 
plan. (Added by Ord. 413-94, App. 12/23/94) 

SEC. 7. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS FOR 
CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS. 

The procedures, requirements, controls and 
standards in Sections 1005 through 1006.8 of 
Article 10 of the City Planning Code shall apply 
to all applications for Certificates of Appropriate- 
ness in the San Francisco Civic Center Historic 
District. 

In addition, the following provisions shall 
apply to all such applications. In the event of any 
conflict or inconsistency between the following 
provisions and Article 10, the procedures, require- 
ments, controls and standards affording stricter 



1437 



Preservation of Historical 
Architectural and Aesthetic Landmarks 



App. J, Sec. 8. 



protection to the Historic District shall prevail, 
except for the provisions of Section 8 of this 
designation ordinance. 

A Certificate of Appropriateness shall be re- 
quired for all major alterations, as set forth 
below, to Contributory or Contributory/Altered 
buildings sites, structures or objects within the 
Historic District. Within 10 days after the Cen- 
tral Permit Bureau refers any permit application 
to the Department, the Zoning Administrator 
and the Secretary to the Landmarks Preserva- 
tion Advisory Board shall determine in writing 
whether the proposed alteration is a major alter- 
ation or a minor alteration. The decision of the 
Zoning Administrator shall be final. 

(a) An alteration is considered major if any 
of the following apply: 

(1) The alteration will remove or cover an 
exterior architectural feature or a portion of an 
exceptionally significant interior as set forth in 
Section 10, or replace it with substitutes that are 
inappropriate in material, scale, color or archi- 
tectural style. This provision shall apply to ex- 
ceptionally significant interior public spaces des- 
ignated in Section 10 of said ordinance; or 

(2) The alteration would affect all or any 
substantial part of a structure&apos;s interior or exte- 
rior column or load-bearing wall, exterior walls 
or exterior ornamentation; or 

(3) The alteration results in a substantial 
addition of height above the height of the struc- 
ture; or 

(4) The cumulative impacts of serial per- 
mits may be determined to be a major alteration. 
An alteration, in combination with other alter- 
ations authorized within the preceding five years, 
shall be deemed a major alteration if the cumu- 
lative impact of said alterations may be consid- 
ered a major alteration as described above. 

(b) An alteration is considered minor if the 
criteria set forth in Subsection (a) do not apply or 
the work consists of ordinary repair and mainte- 
nance. 

(c) The Department of City Planning in 
consultation with the Landmarks Preservation 
Advisory Board, may promulgate Rules and Regu- 



lations to distinguish major alterations from 
minor alterations for this Historic District con- 
sistent with this Section 7. 

(d) Permit applications determined to be for 
minor alterations shall be returned, with that 
determination noted, to the Central Permit Bu- 
reau for further processing; provided, however, 
that the Zoning Administrator may take any 
other otherwise authorized action with respect to 
the application. (Added by Ord. 413-94, App. 
12/23/94) 

SEC. 8. APPEALS FROM THE 
LANDMARKS PRESERVATION ADVISORY 
BOARD AND CITY PLANNING 
COMMISSION DECISIONS ON 
CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS. 

(a) Certificate of Appropriateness decisions 
of the Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board 
may be appealed to the City Planning Commis- 
sion pursuant to the provisions of Planning Code 
Section 1006.8. Nothing in this ordinance shall 
supersede, impair or modify provisions of the 
City Charter or laws governing the State of 
California and the United States of America. All 
governmental bodies shall work cooperatively 
with the Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board 
on proposed exterior and interior changes to 
ensure that the alteration of buildings within 
this Historic District comply with the Secretary 
of the Interior&apos;s Standards for Rehabilitation, 
Revised 1990 (and subsequent revisions). 

(b) This ordinance designating the Civic 
Center Historic District shall in no way diminish 
the powers, rights and duties vested in the Art 
Commission, the War Memorial Board of Trust- 
ees, the Library or the Asian Art Museum. It is 
the intent of the Board of Supervisors, however, 
to retain its authority, and the authority of the 
Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board and 
the Planning Commission, over historic preser- 
vation decisions in the Civic Center Historic 
District in order to ensure the appropriate treat- 
ment of the historical elements of this historic 
district. 



App. J, Sec. 8.

1438 



(c) The entities referenced in Subsection 
8(b) above shall consult with the Landmarks 
Preservation Advisory Board on any proposed 
interior alterations to the publicly accessible 
spaces of their buildings, regardless of whether a 
Certificate of Appropriateness is required by this 
ordinance or by Article 10. (Added by Ord. 413- 
94, App. 12/23/94) 

SEC. 9. STANDARDS FOR REVIEW OF 
APPLICATIONS. 

(a) The standards for review of all applica- 
tions for Certificates of Appropriateness are as 
set forth in Section 1006.7 of Article 10 and are 
as follows: 

(b) For applications pertaining to sites, build- 
ings, structures and objects in the Civic Center 
Historic District, any alteration, construction, 
relocation or demolition, shall comply with the 
standards contained in Section 1017(c), and shall 
(1) be compatible with respect to height, mass- 
ing, fenestration, materials, color, texture, de- 
tail, style, scale and proportion, signage, land- 
scaping and street furniture which may define 
the character of the historic district as described 
in Section 5 of this designating ordinance and in 
the Civic Center Urban Design Guidelines adopted 
by the City Planning Commission; and (2) pre- 
serve, enhance or restore, and not damage or 
destroy, the exterior architectural appearance of 
the subject site, building, structure and object 
which is compatible with the character of the 
Historic District. 

(1) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any ex- 
terior change to a site, building, structure and 
object which is not already compatible with the 
character of the Historic District shall bring the 
site, building, structure and object closer to com- 
patibility. Where the required compatibility ex- 
ists, the application for a Certificate of Appropri- 
ateness shall be approved. 

(2) Except as provided in Planning Code 
Subsection 1017(d), no application for a demoli- 
tion permit in a Historic District may be ap- 
proved until a Certificate of Appropriateness for 
the replacement structure has been approved by 
the Landmarks Board. 



(c) Alterations to Contributory and Contribu- 
tory/Altered buildings shall be compatible with 
the architectural and historic character of this 
Historic District. New construction shall be com- 
patible with the character of the Historic District 
as described in the Landmarks Preservation 
Advisory Board San Francisco Civic Center His- 
toric District Case Report and its Appendix: A and 
with the Civic Center Urban Design Guidelines 
adopted by the City Planning Commission. Said 
Case Report was adopted by the Landmarks 
Preservation Advisory Board at its Regular Meet- 
ing of October 6, 1993 by Resolution No. 4J54 and 
was adopted and amended by the City Planning 
Commission at its Regular Meeting of July 7, 
1994 by Resolution No. 13719 and is contained in 
Board of Supervisors File No. 115-94-10. 

(d) Treatment of Stone Surfaces. Numerous 
structures in the Historic District exhibit stone, 
terra cotta, or brick exterior surfacing. Proposed 
treatment of said masonry surfaces with any 
acid wash, sandblasting, high pressure wash or 
other abrasive methods is discouraged as such 
abrasive treatments can severely damage his- 
toric masonry surfaces. (Added by Ord. 413-94, 
App. 12/23/94)

in Public Corridor 290 (Rooms 190, 192, 193, 290 
and 291 A); and the Main Program Spaces (Rooms 
200, 201, 202, 203, 210 and 218). 

(c) The Public Health Department, 101 Grove 
Street, a Contributory Building to the Historic 
District. The following exceptionally significant 
interior public spaces shall be designated: the 
Main Entry and Elevator Lobby; the Marble 
Lined Corridors (All Floors) and the Third Floor 
Board Meeting Room/Auditorium. 

(d) No other sites, buildings, structures and 
objects have exceptionally significant interior 
public spaces and would be subject to this Sec- 
tion. (Added by Ord. 413-94, App. 12/23/94) 

SEC. 11. SIGNIFICANCE OF 
INDIVIDUAL BUILDINGS TO THE 
HISTORIC DISTRICT. 

The history of each parcel within the Historic 
District is documented in Appendix A: Survey of 
Parcels, and is included in the San Francisco 
Civic Center Historic District Case Report as 
readopted by the Landmarks Board on October 
6, 1993 by Resolution No. 454 and as amended 
and readopted by the City Planning Commission 
on July 7, 1994 by Resolution No. 13719 and is 
located in Board of Supervisors File No. 115-94- 
10. 

Each building is assigned a finding from the 
three following categories: 

1. Contributory. This category identifies 
buildings which date from the Historic District&apos;s 
period of significance (1906 to 1936) which re- 
flect a Beaux Arts style and which retain their 
historic and architectural integrity. These struc- 



tures are of the highest importance in maintain- 
ing the character of the Historic District. Recog- 
nizing the unique character of this Historic District 
which is derived from its expression of an his- 
toric plan, some structures within the Historic 
District may date from the Historic District&apos;s 
period of significance but do not contribute to the 
intended original plan in their architecture, de- 
tailing, height or scale. Such buildings are des- 
ignated noncontributory and may be considered 
for replacement with structures designed in a 
monumental style and manner which would com- 
plete the San Francisco Civic Center Plan as 
originally conceived. 

The following buildings are deemed Contribu- 
tory to the Historic District: Newton Tharp Com- 
mercial High School, 170 Fell Street, Lot 1 
within Assessor&apos;s Block 815; (a portion of Land- 
mark No. 140), Federal Building, 50 Fulton 
Street, (50 United Nations Plaza) Lot 35 within 
Assessor&apos;s Block 351; Exposition Auditorium, 99 
Grove Street, Assessor&apos;s Block 812; Department

Francisco Public Library, 200 Larkin Street, Lot 
1 in Assessor&apos;s Block 353; Orpheum Theater 
Building, 1182—92 Market Street, Lot 22 in 
Assessor&apos;s Block 351; 1212 Market Street, Lot 3 
in Assessor&apos;s Block 355; 1240—1242 Market 
Street, Lot 6 in Assessor&apos;s Block 355; Hotel 
Avalon, 1272—1276 Market Street, Lot 9 in 
Assessor&apos;s Block 355; 1278—1298 Market Street, 
Lot 10 in Assessor&apos;s Block 355; Methodist Book 
Concern, 83 McAllister Street, Lot 32 in Assessor&apos;s 
Block 351; Old State Office Building, 50 McAl- 
lister Street, Lot 2 in Assessor&apos;s Block 765; 
Barbara Apartments, 580 McAllister Street, Lot 
8 in Assessor&apos;s Block 767; 1 United Nations 
Plaza (35 — 57 Fulton Street); Lot 37 in Assessor&apos;s 
Block 351; the High School of Commerce, 135 
Van Ness Avenue, (a portion of Landmark No. 
140), Lot 1 in Assessor&apos;s Block 815; War Memo- 
rial Opera House, 301 Van Ness Avenue (a por- 
tion of Landmark No. 84), Lot 1 in Assessor&apos;s 
Block 786; San Francisco City Hall, 400 Van 
Ness Avenue (Landmark No. 21), Lot 1 in 
Assessor&apos;s Block 787; War Memorial Veteran&apos;s

1440 



Landmark No. 84), Lot 1 in Assessor&apos;s Block 786; 
and, the Corinthian Court Apartments, 500 — 
524 Van Ness Avenue, Lot 6 in Assessor&apos;s Block 
766. 

2. Contributory/Altered. This category 
identifies buildings which date from the Historic 
District&apos;s period of significance and have had 
alterations as detailed on page 22 of the San 
Francisco Civic Center Historic District Case 
Report located in Board of Supervisors File No. 
115-94-10. Appropriate restoration of such build- 
ings is encouraged, though in certain situations 
(see No. 1 above) their demolition and replace- 
ment may be more appropriate in order to achieve 
completion of the original San Francisco Civic 
Center plan. Such replacement should adhere to 
any Civic Center Urban Design Guidelines 
adopted by the City Planning Commission. 

The following buildings shall be deemed Con- 
tributory/Altered within the Historic District: 
Marye Building, 1200-1208 Market Street, Lot 
15 in Assessor&apos;s Block 355; 1220-1232 Market 
Street (29 Grove Street), Lot 4 in Assessor&apos;s 
Block 355; 1236 Market Street (37—39 Grove 
Street), Lot 5 in Assessor&apos;s Block 355; the Wells 
Fargo Building, 1256—1264 Market Street, Lot 
8 in Assessor&apos;s Block 355. The following site shall 
also be deemed Contributory/Altered within the 
Historic District: Civic Center Plaza, being all of 
Block 788. 

3. Noncontributory. This category identi- 
fies buildings which post-date the Historic 
District&apos;s period of significance or have had their 
integrity compromised by inappropriate alter- 
ations as detailed on page 21 of the San Fran- 
cisco Civic Center Historic District Case Report. 
Demolition permit applications for these build- 
ings will be processed without reference to the 
suspension provisions of Article 10. Alterations 
to Noncontributory buildings will require Certifi- 
cate of Appropriateness if determined to be a 
major alteration in order to minimize conflicts 
with the historic character of the Historic Dis- 
trict. Replacement buildings should adhere to 
Civic Center Urban Design Guidelines adopted 
by the City Planning Commission. 



The remaining buildings shall also be deemed 
to be Noncontributory within the Historic Dis- 
trict: California State Courts Building, 455 Golden 
Gate Avenue, Lot 3 within Assessor&apos;s Block 765; 
vacant lot, 41 — 47 Grove Street, Lot 12 in 
Assessor&apos;s Block 355; vacant lot, southeast cor- 
ner of Grove Street at Larkin Street, Lot 11 in 
Assessor&apos;s Block 355; vacant lot, 165 Grove Street, 
Lot 21 in Assessor&apos;s Block 811; Library Annex, 45

lister Street., Lot 4 in Assessor&apos;s Block 766; 460 
McAllister Street, Lot 5 in Assessor&apos;s Block 766; 
vacant lot, 401 Polk Street, Lot 2 in Assessor&apos;s 
Block 766; 10 United Nations Plaza, Lot 50 in

phony Hall, 201 Van Ness Avenue, Lot 1 in 
Assessor&apos;s Block 810; 234 Van Ness Avenue, Lot 
18 in Assessor&apos;s Block 811; 240 Van Ness Avenue, 
Lot 19 in Assessor&apos;s Block 811 and the Edmund

SEC. 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 

The Board of Supervisors hereby finds that 
the area known and described in this ordinance 
as the Bush Street — Cottage Row Historic Dis- 
trict contains a number of structures having a 
special character and special historical, architec- 
tural and aesthetic interest and value and con- 
stitutes a distinct section of the City. The Board 
of Supervisors further finds the designation of 
the said area as an Historic District will be in 
furtherance of and in conformance with the pur- 
poses of Article 10 of the City Planning Code and 
the standards set forth therein, and that the 
preservation on an areas basis rather than on 
the basis of the individual structures alone is in 
order. 

This ordinance is intended to further the 
general purpose of historic preservation legisla- 
tion as set forth, in Section 1001 of the City 
Planning Code, to promote the health, safety and 
general welfare of the public. (Added by Ord. 
324-91, App. 9/4/91) 

SEC. 2. DESIGNATION. 

Pursuant to Section 1004 of the City Plan- 
ning Code, Chapter II, Part II of the San Fran- 
cisco Municipal Code, the Bush Street — Cottage 
Row r Historic District is hereby designated as an 
Historic District, this designation having been 
duly approved by resolution of the City Planning 
Commission. (Added by Ord. 324-91, App. 9/4/91) 



SEC. 3. LOCATION AND BOUNDARIES. 

The location and boundaries of the Bush 
Street — Cottage Row Historic District Map, the 
original of which is on file with the Clerk of the 
Board of Supervisors under File 115-91-8, which 
Map is hereby incorporated herein as though 
fully set forth. (Added by Ord. 324-91, App. 
9/4/91) 

SEC. 4. RELATION TO 
REDEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR THE 
WESTERN ADDITION A-2 PROJECT 
AREA. 

Nothing in this Ordinance shall supersede, 
impair or modify any provisions of the Redevel- 
opment Plan for the Western Addition Redevel- 
opment A-2 Project Area which are applicable to 
property located in such Redevelopment Project 
Area and designated part of this Bush Street — 
Cottage Row Historic District. Procedures found 
in Planning Code Article 10 shall not apply to the 
Bush Street — Cottage Row Historic District as 
long as the Western Addition A-2 Project Area 
Redevelopment Plan is in effect. The Board of 
Supervisors urges the San Francisco Redevelop- 
ment Agency to work cooperatively with the 
Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board on pro- 
posed exterior alterations within the Bush Street — 
Cottage Row Historic District. (Added by Ord. 
324-91, App. 9/4/91) 

SEC. 5. STATEMENT OF 
SIGNIFICANCE. 

The Bush Street — Cottage Row Historic Dis- 
trict is a remarkably intact group of architectur- 
ally consistent Italianate and Stick residential 
buildings constructed between 1870 and about 
1885. It demonstrates several different modes of 
speculative housing during those years, from the 
mass builder The Real Estate Associates, which 
developed whole square blocks, through inves- 
tors John H. Smyth and Charles L. Taylor, who 
built houses to hold and rent out for income, to

App. K, Sec. 5. 



San Francisco - Planning Code 



1444 



the single homeowner. This District is rated high 
on local surveys and is listed in the National 
Register of Historic Places. 

The Bush Street — Cottage Row Historic Dis- 
trict comprises 22 residences, a walkway and a 
small park. There is continuity of height and 
setback; houses step downhill evenly from the 
northeast to conform with the land contour; lots 
are narrow and deep. Almost all the houses were 
developed in four groups, so that six on Bush 
Street are essentially identical to each other, as 
are three different ones on Bush Street, two on 
Sutter Street and six on Cottage Row. All are 
two-story frame structures of Italianate or early 
Stick Style, with channel rustic siding, double- 
hung windows and paneled entry recess. They 
are tall, narrow buildings with tall, narrow open- 
ings balanced by heavy, bracketed cornices on 
patently false fronts. All except Cottage Row 
have bay windows on facade or rear. 

Since they were originally built, the houses 
continued to be used as residences, with some 
alteration due to subdivision into units. At least 
two residences were resurfaced, and one of these 
has been restored. The walkway of Cottage row 
continued until 1944 as part of a single piece of 
private property with 2109 — 2113 Bush Street 
and 1 — 6 Cottage Row. The Cottage Row houses 
were separated into individual ownerships gradu- 
ally from 1956 — 1967, and only on the last date 
was the walkway singled out as an individual 
holding separate from any house. Taylor himself 
had chosen the name &quot;Cottage Row,&quot; which was 
listed among San Francisco&apos;s streets as early as 
the 1886 Directory. In the 1930s the walkway 
was popularly called &quot;Japan Street,&quot; because the 
entire District was inhabited by Japanese- 
Americans until their internment during World 
War II. In the tiny rear yards of Cottage Row 
they grew vegetables, which they offered for 
public sale at an informal weekly open market 
held every Saturday along the Row. (Added by 
Ord. 324-91, App. 9/4/91) 



SEC. 6. FEATURES OF EXISTING 
BUILDINGS. 

1. Overall Form and Continuity. The 

massing of the existing buildings relates to the 
topographical contour of the site, and is compat- 
ible with the adjacent area. 

2. Scale and Proportion. Buildings in the 
District relate to the height and setback, of the 
structures immediately adjacent and in the gen- 
eral area, contained within an envelope that 
slopes upward or downward with the slope of the 
properties. 

3. Fenestration. Existing fenestration is 
predominantly double-hung wooden sash and is 
proportionate and in scale with 19th century 
stylistic patterns within the District. 

4. Materials. Horizontal rustic wood siding 
is the traditional cladding material in the Dis- 
trict. 

5. Detail. Detailing found in the district 
usually follows simple, straightforward Italian- 
ate or Stick Style forms. (Added by Ord. 324-91, 
App. 9/4/91) 

SEC. 8. SIGNIFICANCE OF INDIVIDUAL 
BUILDINGS TO THE HISTORIC 
DISTRICT. 

The history of each parcel within the Historic 
District is documented on survey worksheets 
(Appendix A to the Bush Street — Cottage Row 
Historic District Case Report No. 90.288L). This 
classification of buildings in the Historic District 
is delineated in the Case Report No. 90.288L. 
Each building is designated as follows: 

(1) Contributory. This category identifies 
buildings which date from the Historic District&apos;s 
period of significance and retain their historic 
integrity. These structures are of the highest 
importance in maintaining the character of the 
Historic District. All buildings identified within 
this Historic District are Contributory to the 
Historic District. 

(2) Noncontributory. This category iden- 
tifies buildings or vacant lots which are outside 
or are not relevant to the Historic District&apos;s 
period of significance or are so significantly al- 
tered that they have lost their historic integrity. 



Supp. No. 3, November/December 2006 



1445 Preservation of Historical App. K, Sec. 8. 

Architectural and Aesthetic Landmarks 

Construction of new buildings on a demolished 
or vacant sites and additions to or major alter- 
ation of Noncontributory buildings should be 
compatible with the character of the Historic 
District. Vacant parcels, including the City- 
owned right-of-way known as Cottage Row (Lot 
46) and the City-owned Mini Park (Lot 12), are 
both rated Noncontributory. (Added by Ord. 324-

SEC. 5. STATEMENT OF 
SIGNIFICANCE. 

The Dogpatch Historic District possesses a 
unique place and significance in the areas of 
architecture, history, and environment worthy of 
protection as an historic district. Dogpatch is an 
approximately nine-block enclave of industrial 
workers&apos; housing located east of Potrero Hill, in 
San Francisco&apos;s Central Waterfront district. The 
neighborhood is comprised of almost one-hun- 
dred flats and cottages, as well as several indus- 
trial, commercial, and civic buildings, most of 
which were erected between 1870 and 1930. 

The neighborhood is significant under Na- 
tional Register Criterion A (Events/Patterns of 
History) and Criterion C (Design/Construction). 
The neighborhood is significant at the local level 
under Criterion A (Events/Patterns of History), 
within the category of Industry, as the oldest and 
most intact concentration of industrial workers&apos; 
housing hi San Francisco. No other district of 
San Francisco or California was industrialized to 
the degree of Potrero Point during the last quar- 
ter of the 19th Century. The shipyards and other 
maritime-related industries of Potrero Point re- 
quired a steady supply of inexpensive immigrant 
labor in an area that was geographically cut off 
from the rest of the City. Local developers and 
landholders, including Santa Fe Land Improve- 
ment Company, responded to this need by con- 
structing rows of inexpensive cottages and sell- 
ing individual parcels to laborers and their 
families, allowing the neighborhood to develop 
as an informal company town. Dogpatch is also 
significant at the local level under Criterion A 
(Events/Patterns of History), within the category 
of Exploration/Settlement, as the first housing 
developed in the Potrero District. Initially devel- 
oped in the early 1870s, Dogpatch became the 
nucleus of the Potrero District that would evolve 
after the 1906 earthquake. Finally, Dogpatch is 
significant under Criterion C (Design/Construc- 
tion), within the category of Architecture, as a 
moderately intact district of mostly Victorian 



and Edwardian-era workers&apos; dwellings con- 
structed between 1870 and 1910. Residences 
within the district reflect vernacular forms of 
architectural styles that were prevalent through- 
out the country, including Greek Revival, Queen 
Anne, Italianate, Eastlake and Classical Revival 
styles, or combinations thereof. The district has 
several clusters, and pairs of identical dwellings, 
including a group of thirteen identical Eastlake- 
style cottages based on the plans of San Fran- 
cisco architect John Cotter Pelton, Jr. While the 
significance of Union Iron Works/Bethlehem Steel 
is national in scope, the significance of Dogpatch 
under this criterion remains local. 

The period of significance for the district 
dates from 1867, the opening of Long Bridge and 
the beginning of construction in the neighbor- 
hood, to 1945, the end of World War II. Addi- 
tional historic information may be found in the 
Dogpatch Historic District Designation Report, 
which is hereby incorporated herein as though 
fully set forth. This document is on file at the 
Planning Department under Case No. 
2002.99775L. (Added by Ord. 66-03, File No. 
020972, App. 4/18/2003) 

SEC. 6. FEATURES. 

(a) Residential— Features of Existing 
Buildings. 

1. Overall Form and Continuity. Build- 
ing height is generally within a three-story range, 
with a substantial number of structures built at 
one or two stories in height. The majority of 
structures have been either elevated or altered 
to allow for the construction of a garage level at 
grade. However, despite these and other alter- 
ations, the majority of residences in the district 
retain their historic integrity. Residential build- 
ings are generally set back an average of 10 feet 
from the public right-of-way. 

2. Scale and Proportion. The buildings 
vary in height, bulk, scale and proportion. The 
width of lots in Dogpatch range from single lots 
of 20 feet to 40 feet for larger lots. Early homes in 
Dogpatch constructed circa 1870 were designed 
in a vernacular style with Greek Revival influ- 
ences. Later homes continued in the Greek Re-

Architectural and Aesthetic Landmarks 



App. L, Sec. 6. 



vival form, but were joined by homes designed in 
the Queen Anne, Italianate and Classical Re- 
vival styles, as well as the Eastlake-styled Pel- 
ton Cottages. Multi-story residences are large in 
bulk, often as great as 3,500 square feet. Smaller 
cottage-size structures, typically 800 square feet, 
are well scaled to the smaller lots. 

3. Fenestration. Existing fenestration con- 
sists of predominantly double-hung, wood sash 
window&apos;s that are vertical in orientation. Resi- 
dential buildings feature a fairly symmetrical 
and regular pattern of windows with consistent 
dimensions along primary facades. Generally, 
the size and shape of window openings have not 
been altered over time, 

4. Materials. Horizontal rustic wood siding 
is the traditional cladding material found in the 
district. However, fishscale wood shingles and 
asbestos siding are also found throughout the 
district. 

5. Design Features, Recessed porches and 
entry porticos are characteristic design features 
of the district. 

6. Architectural Detail. Architectural de- 
tail found in the district usually follows transi- 
tional elements associated with the Greek Re- 
vival, Eastlake, Queen Anne, Italianate and 
Classical Revival architectural styles. 

(b) Industrial/Commercial — Features of 
Existing Buildings. 

1. Overall Form and Continuity. Build- 
ing height is generally within a four-story range 
and many of the industrial/commercial struc- 
tures are one or two stories in height. Typically, 
these buildings are constructed closer to the 
property line than the residential structures 
found hi the district. 

2. Scale and Proportion. The buildings 
are of typical warehouse design, large in bulk, 
often with large, ground level openings origi- 
nally designed for rail or vehicular access. Indus- 
trial/commercial structures are found through- 
out the district, often surrounded by residential 
buildings. While gaps may exists, because of 
height, bulk and setback, there is regularity to 
the overall form of industrial/commercial build- 
ings. A small cluster of brick and stucco public 



buildings (police, fire, and hospital) are easily 
recognizable from other industrial/commercial 
structures found in the district. These resources, 
while offering a different scale and proportion, 
are compatible with the plain reinforced concrete 
and brick-faced structures characteristic of 20th 
century industrial architecture. 

3. Fenestration. For the most part, the 
district&apos;s industrial/commercial buildings lack 
strong fenestration patterns, which typically are 
not supportive of a warehouse function. Windows 
exist near entrances and in some cases, offer 
small storefronts to display products. Early 20th 
century warehouse buildings were often con- 
structed with office spaces above warehouse func- 
tions. In this case, double-hung, residential-type 
windows can be found. Larger industrial, metal 
sash windows are prevalent on commercial build- 
ings built after 1920. Door openings are often 
massive to facilitate easy access of bulk materi- 
als. 

4. Materials. Standard brick masonry is 
found on the older industrial/commercial build- 
ings in the district: reinforced concrete was in- 
troduced as a cladding material following the 
earthquake and fire of 1906. Concrete block and 
stucco are also found on some 20th century, 
industrial/commercial build ings . 

5. Color. Red brick is typical, with some 
yellow and painted brick. Muted earth tones of 
red, brown, green, gray, and blue are found on 
reinforced concrete, concrete block, and stucco- 
faced buildings. 

6. Texture. Typical facing materials give 
both a rough textured or smooth appearance, 
depending on the cladding material. 

7. Architectural Detail. Industrial and 
commercial buildings typically lack ornamenta- 
tion. Warehouses by their very nature are utili- 
tarian; warehouses constructed tow r ards the end 
of the Dogpatch Historic District period of sig- 
nificance (1943) have even less ornamentation 
than older counterparts. Cornices are simple and 
may be abstract versions of more elaborate cor- 
nices found on larger, commercial structures in 
San Francisco&apos;s Financial District. Where detail

occurs, it is often found surrounding entryways 
to industrial/commercial buildings. (Added by 
Ord. 66-03, File No. 020972, App. 4/18/2003) 

SEC. 7. STANDARDS FOR REVIEW OF 
APPLICATIONS. 

Any exterior change within the Dogpatch 
Historic District shall require a Certificate of 
Appropriateness, pursuant to the provisions of 
Article 10, when such work requires a City 
permit. The procedures, requirements, controls 
and standards of Article 10 of the Planning Code 
shall apply to all applications for Certificates of 
Appropriateness in the Dogpatch Historic Dis- 
trict. In addition, the following specific stan- 
dards for review shall apply to all applications 
for Certificates of Appropriateness. In the event 
of any conflict or inconsistency between the pro- 
visions set forth below and Article 10, those 
procedures, requirements, controls and stan- 
dards affording stricter protection to the Historic 
District shall prevail. 

(a) Character of the Historic District. 

The general standards for review of all applica- 
tions for Certificates of Appropriateness are as 
set forth in Article 10. For purposes of review 
pursuant to said standards, the character of said 
Historic District shall mean the features of the 
Dogpatch Historic District referred to and de- 
scribed in Section 6 of this ordinance. For projects 
on buildings that have been previously compro- 
mised by incompatible alterations or additions, 
proposed exterior changes which bring these 
buildings closer to their original, historic appear- 
ance and make the buildings more in conformity 
with the character of the district are encouraged. 

(b) Residential — Alterations and New 

Construction. Exterior alterations or new ad- 
ditions to a contributory or non-contributory 
residential resource in the Dogpatch Historic 
District shall not destroy historic materials that 
characterize the resource or its environs. New 
additions, exterior alterations, or related new 
construction shall not destroy historic materials, 
features and spatial relationships that charac- 
terize the property. Any new work shall be dif- 
ferentiated from the old and shall be compatible 
with the historic materials, features, size, scale 



and proportion, and massing to protect the in- 
tegrity of the property and its environment, and 
must conform to the following provisions: 

1 . False Historicism. False historicism and 

the conjectural replication of historic styles and 
details is discouraged; if restoration is the se- 
lected alteration approach, historic documenta- 
tion through original architectural plans, his- 
toric photographs, or physical investigation will 
be required. Where original plans or historic 
photographs are unavailable, close physical ex- 
amination of the building and existing scar traces, 
along with a comparison to buildings of the same 
age and style in the neighborhood, may be suffi- 
cient to reveal evidence necessary to guide the 
restoration. 

2. Materials. Horizontal rustic wood siding 
is the traditional cladding material in the dis- 
trict and its use is encouraged over other clad- 
ding materials, including wood shingles (except 
where appropriate). 

3. Fenestration. Fenestration should be 
proportionate and in scale with traditional pat- 
terns within the district. Double-hung wood sash 
windows are encouraged over vinyl or metal sash 
windows. &quot;Slider&quot; windows of vinyl or aluminum 
construction are discouraged, especially on pri- 
mary facades. True divided lites, rather than 
snap-in or faux muntins, are encouraged when 
divided lite wood windows are appropriate. 

4. Style. New construction in a contempo- 
rary yet compatible, idiom is encouraged. 

5. Scale and Proportion. New construc- 
tion must be compatible with the massing;, size, 
scale and architectural details of residential re- 
sources found in the district. 

6. Setbacks. New construction should con- 
form to existing setback patterns found in the 
district. 

7. Roofline. Gabled roof forms and raised 
parapets are encouraged on new construction. 

8. Detailing. Detailing on new construc- 
tion should relate to the simple, traditional ver- 
nacular forms found in the district. 

(c) Industrial/Commercial — Alter- 
ations and New Construction. Exterior alter- 
ations or new additions to a contributory or 



Supp. No. 3, November/December 2006 



1451 



Preservation of Historical 
Architectural and Aesthetic Landmarks 



App. L, Sec. 7, 



non-contributory industrial/commercial resource 
in the Dogpatch Historic District shall not de- 
stroy historic materials that characterize the 
resource or its environs. New additions, exterior 
alterations, or related new construction shall not 
destroy historic materials, features and spatial 
relationships that characterize the property. Any 
new work shall be differentiated from the old 
and shall be compatible with the historic mate- 
rials, features, size, scale and proportion, and 
massing to protect the integrity of the property 
and its environment, and must conform to the 
following provisions: 

1. Materials. The traditional cladding ma- 
terials of industrial/commercial structures found 
in the district are brick, reinforced concrete, 
cinder block, and stucco; they are encouraged 
over other cladding materials. 

2. Fenestration. Fenestration should be 
proportionate and in scale with traditional pat- 
terns within the district. Wood or metal sash 
windows are encouraged, while&quot;slider&quot; windows 
of vinyl or aluminum construction on either 
industrial or commercial buildings are discour- 
aged. 

3. Roofline. Flat roof forms are encouraged 
on .industrial and/or commercial structures; gabled 
roof forms may be appropriate for commercial 
structures that include residential upper floors. 

4. Parapets. Raised parapets are typically 
found on industrial and/or commercial struc- 
tures in the Dogpatch Historic District and are 
encouraged where appropriate. Parapets should 
be kept to a minimum height necessary to screen 
rooftop equipment, or to facilitate characteristic 
design features. 

5. Design Features. The addition of bay 
windows, porches, balconies or other typically 
residential features to new or existing industrial/ 
commercial structures in the district are discour- 
aged. These elements may be appropriate on 
commercial structures that include residential 
upper floors. 

6. Style. New construction in a contempo- 
rary, yet compatible, idiom is encouraged. 



7. Scale and Proportion. New construc- 
tion must be compatible with the massing, size, 
scale and architectural details of industrial/ 
commercial resources found in the Dogpatch 
Historic District. 

8. Setbacks. New construction should con- 
form to existing setback patterns found in the 
district. 

9. Detailing. Detailing on new construc- 
tion should relate to the simple, traditional ver- 
nacular forms found on industrial/commercial 
structures in the district. 

(d) Ordinary Maintenance and Repair. 

A Certificate of Appropriateness shall not be 
required if the work consists of ordinary mainte- 
nance and repair, which is defined in Article 10 
as any work the sole purpose and effect of which 
is to correct deterioration, decay or damage, 
including repair of damage caused by fire or 
other disaster. 

(e) Garages and Garage Doors. The ad- 
dition of garages at the front elevation of resi- 
dential buildings shall seek to minimize the 
physical and visual impacts on the significant 
architectural features of the existing building. 
The design of garages and garage doors should 
be unobtrusive and simple, with an emphasis on 
minimal size and dimensions of the structure as 
well as the door opening. Garage doors should be 
recessed from the garage structure to create an 
adequate shadow line, with wood being the pref- 
erable material. While remaining simple and 
unobtrusive, the design of the garage door may 
relate to the existing residence in material, de- 
tail and orientation. Retention of historic side- 
hinged garage doors is encouraged. 

(f) Masonry, Brickwork and Stonework. 

A Certificate of Appropriateness shall be re- 
quired for painting previously unpainted ma- 
sonry, brick or stone exterior surfaces, for clean- 
ing such surfaces w r ith abrasives and/or treatment 
of such surfaces with waterproofing chemicals. 
The painting of unpainted masonry, brickwork 
and stonework is discouraged. Sandblasting and 
certain chemical treatment detrimental to ma- 
sonry will not be approved.

(g) Demolition. Demolition of Contribu- 
tory buildings shall be subject to the maximum 
controls allowed under Article 10 of the Planning 
Code. A demolition permit shall not be issued 
until all other required permits for new replace- 
ment construction have been approved. No ap- 
plication for a demolition permit shall be deemed 
complete until all building permits for the re- 
placement structure, preferably located on the 
demolition site, have been approved. 

(h) Seismic Upgrade. Seismic upgrades 
shall seek to minimize the alteration of the 
significant architectural features of a structure. 
Proposed Unreinforced Masonry Building (UMB) 
upgrades should follow the &quot;Architectural De- 
sign Guide for Exterior Treatments of Unrein- 
forced Masonry Buildings during Seismic Retro- 
fit,&quot; prepared by the American Institute of 
Architects. When enforcing the terms of this 
provision during seismic upgrade work, due con- 
sideration shall be given to approving modest 
alterations for seismic upgrade purposes when 
enforcing the terms of these provisions, for ex- 
ample, the replacement of relatively unobtrusive 
building elements such as a brick foundation on 
a wood frame building. (Added by Ord. 66-03, 
File No. 020972, App. 4/18/2003) 

SEC. 8. SIGNIFICANCE OF INDIVIDUAL 
BUILDINGS TO THE HISTORIC 
DISTRICT. 

An architectural description, building history 
and evaluation of each parcel within the Historic 
District is documented on the State of California — 
Department of Parks and Recreation Primary 
Record (DPR 523A — descriptive) survey forms 
and Building, Structure, and Object Record (DPR 
523B — evaluative) survey forms. These forms 
are part of the Dogpatch Historic Resource Sur- 
vey which was endorsed by the Landmarks Board 
on October 17, 2001 (Resolution No. 545), and 
then by the Planning Commission on December 
13, 2001 (Resolution No. 16300). These survey 
forms are hereby incorporated herein as though 
fully set forth, and is [sic] on file at the Planning 
Department under Case No. 2002.0775L. It is 
important to note that street address numbers 
are subject to change, and that the most reliable, 



official method for identifying a property within 
the Historic District is to refer to it by its 
assigned Assessor Block and Lot number. Each 
building is assigned to either of the two following 
categories. 

Contributory. This category identifies build- 
ings, which date from the Historic District&apos;s 
period of significance and retain their historic 
integrity. These structures are of the highest 
importance in maintaining the character of the 
Historic District. The category also includes build- 
ings which date from the Historic District&apos;s pe- 
riod of significance, but have had their historic 
integrity compromised by inappropriate alter- 
ations. Appropriate restoration of such buildings 
is encouraged. The maximum suspension period 
allowable under Article 10 shall be imposed on 
applications for demolition of Contributory build- 
ings. 

The following buildings are deemed Contribu- 
tory to the Historic District: 2300 3rd St., 2310 
3rd St., 2342—44 3rd St., 2476—78 3rd St.,

Noncontributory. This category identifies 
buildings which postdate the Historic District&apos;s 
period of significance. Demolition permit appli- 
cations for these buildings will be processed 
without reference to the suspension provisions of 
Article 10. Alterations to Noncontributory build- 
ings would require Certificate of Appropriate- 
ness review in order to ensure that alterations 
and new construction would be compatible with 
the historic character of the District in terms of 
scale, massing, fenestration, materials and de- 
tail.

SEC. 1101. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 

(a) It is hereby found that a substantial 
number of the buildings in the C-3 District have 
a special architectural, historical, and aesthetic 
value. These buildings contribute substantially 
to San Francisco&apos;s reputation throughout the 
United States as a City of outstanding beauty 
and physical harmony. A substantial number of 
these special buildings have been and continue 
to be unnecessarily destroyed or impaired, de- 
spite the feasibility of preserving and continuing 
their use, and without adequate consideration 
for the irreplaceable loss to the people of the City 
of their aesthetic, cultural, historic and economic 
value. 

(b) It is further found that distinct and 
definable subareas within the C-3 District pos- 
sess concentrations of buildings that together 
create a unique historic, architectural, and aes- 
thetic character which contributes to the beauty 
and attractiveness of the City. The quality of 
these geographic areas has been and continues 



to be degraded by the unnecessary demolition of 
buildings of substantial architectural and aes- 
thetic merit, by their replacement with buildings 
which conflict with the character and scale of the 
area, and by alteration of buildings in a manner 
which conflicts with the character and scale of 
the area. 

(c) It is therefore declared that the protec- 
tion, enhancement, and perpetuation of build- 
ings and definable subareas of special architec- 
tural, historical, and aesthetic interest is necessary 
to promote the health, safety, prosperity and 
welfare of the people of the City. Accordingly, the 
purposes of this Article are: 

(1) The protection, enhancement, and per- 
petuation of structures and subareas of special 
architectural, historical, and aesthetic character 
which contribute to the urban environment; 

(2) The maintenance and improvement of a 
healthy economy for the City by enhancing both 
property values and the City&apos;s attractiveness as 
a place to do business; 

(3) The protection and improvement of the 
City&apos;s attractiveness to tourists and other visi- 
tors, and the stimulus to business provided 
thereby; 

(4) The enrichment of the educational, cul- 
tural, aesthetic and spiritual life of the inhabit- 
ants of the City by fostering knowledge of the 
heritage of the City&apos;s past and retaining the 
quality of the City&apos;s urban environment. 

(d) It is further found that the use of Trans- 
ferable Development Rights as provided herein 
is necessary to promote the urban planning and 
design goals of the Master Plan by (1) maintain- 
ing appropriate overall development capacities 
in each zoning district within the C-3 area, as 
defined by applicable floor area, height, bulk and 
other parameters; (2) encouraging and directing 
development into the Special Development Dis- 
trict in order to maintain a compact downtown 
financial district; and (3) facilitating the reten- 
tion of Significant Buildings, and encouraging 
the retention of Contributory Buildings, and the 
compatible replacement or alteration of Unrated 
buildings in Conservation Districts, as defined 
herein. (Added Ord. 414-85, App. 9/17/85)

Historical, and Aesthetic Importance in the C-3 Districts 



Sec. 1102.1. 



SEC. 1102. STANDARDS FOR 
DESIGNATION OF BUILDINGS. 

The buildings in the C-3 Districts are divided 
into five categories according to the Building 
Rating methodology as set forth and explained in 
the Preservation of the Past section of the Down- 
town Plan, a component of the Master Plan. 
Those categories are as follows: 

(a) Significant Buildings - Category I. 

Buildings which: 

(1) Are at least 40 years old; and 

(2) Are judged to be Buildings of Individual 
Importance; and 

(3) Are rated Excellent in Architectural De- 
sign or are rated Very Good in both Architectural 
Design and Relationship to the Environment. 

(b) Significant Buildings - Category II. 

Buildings: 

(1) Which meet the standards in Section 
1102(a) above; and 

(2) To which, because of their depth and 
relationship to other structures, it is feasible to 
add different and higher replacement structures 
or additions to height at the rear of the structure, 
even if visible when viewing the principal fa- 
cades, without affecting their architectural qual- 
ity or relationship to the environment and with- 
out affecting the appearance of the retained 
portions as separate structures when viewing 
the principal facades. The designation of Cat- 
egory II Buildings shall identify for each build- 
ing the portion of the building beyond which 
such additions may be permitted. 

(c) Contributory Buildings - Category 

III. Buildings which: 

(1) Are located outside a designated Conser- 
vation District; and 

(2) Are at least 40 years old; and 

(3) Are judged to be Buildings of Individual 
Importance; and 

(4) Are rated either Very Good in Architec- 
tural Design or Excellent or Very Good in Rela- 
tionship to the Environment. 



(d) Contributory Buildings - Category 

IV. Buildings which: 

(1) Are located in a designated Conserva- 
tion District; and 

(2) Are at least 40 years old; and 

(3) Are judged to be Buildings of Individual 
Importance, and are rated either Very Good in 
Architectural Design or Excellent or Very Good 
in Relationship to the Environment. 

(4) Are judged to be Buildings of Contextual 
Importance and are rated Very Good in Architec- 
tural Design and/or Excellent or Very Good in 
Relationship to the Environment. 

(e) Unrated Buildings - Category V. Build- 
ings which are not designated as Significant or 
Contributory. (Amended Ord. 414-85, App. 9/17/ 
85)

SEC. 1103. STANDARDS FOR 
DESIGNATION OF CONSERVATION 
DISTRICTS. 

Portions of the C-3 District may be desig- 
nated as Conservation Districts if they contain 
substantial concentrations of buildings that to- 
gether create subareas of special architectural 
and aesthetic importance. Such areas shall con- 
tain substantial concentrations of Significant 
and Contributory Buildings and possess substan- 
tial overall architectural, aesthetic or historic 
qualities justifying additional controls in order 
to protect and promote those qualities. (Added 
Ord. 414-85, App. 9/17/85) 

SEC. 1103.1. CONSERVATION DISTRICT 
DESIGNATIONS. 

The following Conservation Districts are

SEC. 1104. NOTICE OF DESIGNATION. 

(a) The Zoning Administrator shall notify 
by mail the owners of every building designated 
by this ordinance as a Significant or Contribu- 
tory Building and every building within a con- 
servation district as established by this ordi- 
nance. 



(b) With respect to buildings designated Sig- 
nificant or Contributory by this ordinance , notice 
shall also be given by posting each such building 
in a conspicuous place as well as by publication 
pursuant to the provisions of California Govern- 
ment Code Section 6064. The notice shall state 
that the owner of every building so designated 
has the right to request a change of designation 
and the time permitted for making such a re- 
quest. 

(c) The Zoning Administrator shall cause a 
copy of this ordinance, or notice thereof, to be 
recorded in the office of the County Recorder for 
properties designated as Significant or Contribu- 
tory, and for properties designated within a con- 
servation district, by this ordinance. (Added Ord. 
414-85, App. 9/17/85) 

SEC. 1105. RECONSIDERATION OF 
DESIGNATION. 

(a) Request for Reconsideration. Within 
45 days of the effective date of this ordinance, a 
request for reconsideration and change of a des- 
ignation may be filed by any affected property 
owner, by any organization or group which has 
historic preservation stated as one of its goals in 
its bylaws or articles of incorporation, or the 
application of at least 50 registered voters of the 
City, based on the grounds that under the stan- 
dards contained in Section 1102 the designation 
set forth in this ordinance is incorrect. Such a 
request shall be filed with the Department of 
City Planning on forms provided for that pur- 
pose. The Department of City Planning shall not 
accept or act upon any application filed after 45 
days have passed. Once a request for reconsid- 
eration has been made as to any building, no 
additional requests shall be accepted as to that 
building; however, another applicant may seek a 
change of designation different from that sought 
in the original reconsideration request. Any prop- 
erty owner who contends that the designation 
applicable to its property deprives the owner of a 
constitutionally protected property right, or that, 
by reason of such application, the property owner 
is entitled to compensation, shall assert such 
argument in connection with and in aid of the 



1505 



Preservation of Buildings and Districts of Architectural, 
Historical, and Aesthetic Importance in the C-3 Districts 



Sec. 1106. 



application filed under this Section and provide 
all evidence in the property owner&apos;s possession 
in support of such contention. 

(b) Referral to the Landmarks Preser- 
vation Advisory Board; Review by the De- 
partment of City Planning. Upon determina- 
tion by the Zoning Administrator that an 
application is complete, the Zoning Administra- 
tor shall promptly refer the matter to the Land- 
marks Preservation Advisory Board for review 
and recommendation, and the Department of 
City Planning shall undertake a study of the 
reconsideration request and prepare a report 
and recommendation. The Landmarks board shall 
recommend approval, disapproval, or approval 
with modifications of the application within 30 
days of receiving it; provided, however, that if 
more than 30 applications are received within 
any 15-day period at the Department of City 
Planning, the Zoning Administrator may extend 
the time for Advisory Board action with respect 
to those applications for an additional period of 
time not to exceed 45 days, and if more than 50 
applications are received within such time, for 
an additional period of time deemed necessary to 
allow sufficient time for Board review. If the 
Landmarks Board fails to respond within the 
allowed time the City Planning Commission shall 
proceed without a recommendation from the 
Landmarks Board. 

(c) Submittal to the Planning Commis- 
sion. Upon completion of the study by the De- 
partment of City Planning and recommendation 
by the Landmarks Advisory Board, the matter 
shall be scheduled for public hearing before the 
Planning Commission; provided, however, that 
in no event shall it be scheduled later than 30 
days after the Advisory Board has made its 
recommendation unless the applicant consents 
to an extension of this time limit. Notice of the 
hearing shall be given by mail to the applicant 
and to any other persons requesting notice. 

(d) City Planning Commission Deci- 
sion. The Planning Commission may approve, 
disapprove, or approve with modifications the 
reconsideration application. The building shall 
be deemed to be designated according to the 



decision of the Planning Commission and the 
provisions of this Article 11 applicable to that 
designation shall apply to the building notwith- 
standing another designation of the building in 
Appendices A, B, C or D to this Article. (Added 
Ord. 414-85, App. 9/17/85) 

SEC. 1106. CHANGE OF DESIGNATION: 
DESIGNATION OF ADDITIONAL 
BUILDINGS. 

Buildings may be designated or their desig- 
nation may be changed through amendment of 
Appendices A, B, C and D of this Article. Such 
designation or change of designation shall be 
governed by the following provisions in lieu of 
the provisions of Section 302: 

(a) Initiation. The designation or change 
of designation of a building may be initiated by 
motion of the Board of Supervisors, by resolution 
of the Planning Commission or the Landmarks 
Preservation Advisory Board, by the verified 
application of the owner or authorized agent of 
the affected property, by the application of any 
organization or group which has historic preser- 
vation stated as one of its goals in its bylaws or 
articles of incorporation, or by the application of 
at least 50 registered voters of the City. Except in 
the case of initiation by governmental bodies, 
any such application shall be filed with the 
Department of City Planning upon forms pre- 
scribed by the Department of City Planning, and 
shall be accompanied by all data required by the 
Department. 

(b) Notice; Referral to the Landmarks 
Preservation Advisory Board; Review by 
the Department of City Planning. Upon de- 
termination by the Zoning Administrator that a 
verified application is complete and contains all 
necessary information or upon receipt of the 
motion or resolution of one of the governmental 
bodies set forth in Subsection (a) above, the 
Zoning Administrator shall (1) send notice of the 
proposed designation or change of designation by 
mail to the owner of the affected property, unless 
the application is that of the owner, and (2) 
promptly refer the matter to the Landmarks 
Preservation Advisory Board for review and the 
submittal of a recommendation. The Depart- 



Sec. 1106. 



San Francisco - Planning Code 



1506 



ment of City Planning shall also undertake a 
study of the proposed designation or change of 
designation. 

(c) Action by the Planning Commission. 

Upon completion of the review of the proposed 
designation or change of designation by the De- 
partment of City Planning and the submittal of 
the report by the Landmarks Board, the matter 
shall be placed on the agenda of the Planning 
Commission for public hearing. The Planning 
Commission shall determine the appropriate des- 
ignation or change in designation of the building. 
If the Planning Commission approves or modi- 
fies the designation or change of designation in 
whole or in part, it shall transmit the proposal, 
together with a copy of the resolution of ap- 
proval, to the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors. 

(d) Designation by Board of Supervi- 
sors. The Board of Supervisors, or a committee 
thereof, shall hold a public hearing on any pro- 
posal so transmitted to it. The Board of Supervi- 
sors may approve, modify and approve, or disap- 
prove the designation or change of designation 
by a majority vote of all its members. 

(e) Appeal to Board of Supervisors. If 

the Planning Commission disapproves the pro- 
posed designation or change of designation, such 
action shall be final except upon the filing of a 
notice of appeal to the Board of Supervisors 
within 30 days by the applicant or any of the 
persons, organizations or groups listed in Sec- 
tion 1106(a); provided, however, that if the pro- 
posal was initiated by the Board of Supervisors, 
the Clerk of the said Board shall be notified 
immediately of the disapproval without the ne- 
cessity for an appeal. 

(f) Hearing and Decision. The Board of 
Supervisors, or a committee thereof, shall hold a 
public hearing on any such proposal appealed to 
it or initiated by it. The Board of Supervisors 
may uphold the Planning Commission, overrule 
the Planning Commission and approve, or modify 
and approve, the designation or change of desig- 
nation by a majority vote of all its members. 

(g) Notice of Proceedings. Notice of the 
hearing scheduled before the Planning Commis- 
sion and Board of Supervisors, and of the avail- 



ability of applicable reports, shall be given by 
mail to the initiators of the designation or change 
of designation, to the owners of any affected 
building, to appellants, and to any other inter- 
ested person or organization requesting notice, 
(h) Grounds for Designation or Change 
of Designation. The designation of a building 
may be changed if (1) changes in the area in the 
vicinity of a building located outside a Conserva- 
tion District warrant a change in the rating of 
the building with respect to its relationship to 
the environment and therefore place it in a 
different category, pursuant to Section 1102; or 
(2) changes in Conservation District boundaries 
make a building of Contextual Importance fall 
outside a Conservation District and therefore no 
longer eligible for designation as a Contributory 
building, or, conversely, make a building of Con- 
textual Importance fall within a Conservation 
District and therefore eligible for designation as 
a Contributory Building; or (3) changes in the 
physical features of the building due to circum- 
stances beyond the control of the owner, or 
otherwise permitted by this Article, warrant 
placing the building in a different category pur- 
suant to the standards set forth in Section 1102; 
or (4) restoration of the building to its original 
quality and character warrants placing the build- 
ing in a different category pursuant to the stan- 
dards set forth in Section 1102; or (5) lay the 
passage of time, the building has become at least 
40 years old, making it eligible to be considered 
for designation as a Significant or Contributory 
building, pursuant to Section 1102; or (6) the 
discovery of new factual information (for ex- 
ample, information about the history of the build- 
ing) makes the building eligible for rating as a 
Building of Individual or Contextual Importance 
and, therefore, eligible to be designated as a 
Significant or Contributory Building. (Added Ord. 
414-85, App. 9/17/85)

Historical, and Aesthetic Importance in the C-3 Districts 



Sec. 1108. 



Section 1103.1 of this Article 11. Such designa- 
tion or boundary change shall be governed by the 
following provisions in lieu of the provisions of 
Section 302. 

(a) Initiation of Designation or Bound- 
ary Change. The designation of an area of the 
C-3 District as a Conservation District or the 
change of District boundaries may be initiated 
by motion of the Board of Supervisors, by reso- 
lution of the Planning Commissioner the Land- 
marks Preservation Advisory Board, upon the 
verified application of the owners or other autho- 
rized agents of greater than 25 percent of the 
structures in the area proposed for designation 
(or, as to an alteration, 25 percent of the struc- 
tures of the proposed new district unless it would 
be an area smaller than the existing district, in 
which case it shall be 25 percent of the struc- 
tures of the existing district), upon the verified 
application of any organization or group which 
has historic preservation stated as one of its 
goals in its bylaws or articles of incorporation, or 
upon the verified application of at least 150 
registered voters of the City. Except in case of an 
initiation by governmental bodies, any such ap- 
plication shall be filed with the Department of 
City Planning upon forms prescribed by the 
Department of City Planning, and shall be ac- 
companied by all data required by said Depart- 
ment. 

(b) Notice; Referral to the Landmarks

Commission shall be as set forth in Section 
1106(c) of this Article. 

(d) Designation by Board of Supervi- 
sors. The Board of Supervisors, or a committee 
thereof, shall hold a public hearing on any pro- 
posal so transmitted to it. The Board of Supervi- 
sors may approve, modify and approve, or disap- 
prove the designation or boundary change by a 
majority vote of all its members. 



(e) Appeal to Board of Supervisors. If 

the Planning Commission disapproves the pro- 
posed designation or boundary change, such ac- 
tion shall be final except upon the filing of a 
notice of appeal to the Board of Supervisors 
within 30 days by the applicant or any of the 
persons, organizations, or groups listed in Sec- 
tion 1107(a); provided, however, that if the pro- 
posal was initiated by the Board of Supervisors, 
the Clerk of the said board shall be notified 
immediately of the disapproval without the ne- 
cessity for an appeal. 

(f) Hearing and Decision. The Board of 
Supervisors, or a committee thereof, shall hold a 
public hearing on any such proposal appealed to 
it or initiated by it. The Board of Supervisors 
may uphold the Planning Commission, overrule 
the Planning Commission and approve, or modify 
and approve, the designation or boundary change 
by a majority vote of all its members. 

(g) Notice of Proceedings. Notice of the 
hearing scheduled before the Planning Commis- 
sion shall be given by mail to the initiators of the 
designation or alteration, the owners of all lots 
within 300 feet of the proposed new district or of 
that portion of the district being altered, as well 
as to interested individuals or organizations who 
request such notice. 

(h) Standards Applicable to Designa- 
tion or Boundary Change. The standards gov- 
erning the designation and change of District 
boundaries are those set forth in Section 1103. 
Areas may be removed from Conservation Dis- 
tricts if the character of the area has changed 
such that the area no longer qualifies under the 
standards set forth in Section 1103. (Added Ord. 
414-85, App. 9/17/85) 

SEC. 1108. NOTICE OF DESIGNATION. 

When a building has been designated Signifi- 
cant or Contributory or its designation is changed 
pursuant to Section 1106, or when a new Con- 
servation District is established or the boundary 
of a Conservation District changed pursuant to 
Section 1107, the Zoning Administrator shall 
notify each affected property owner by mail and 
shall cause a copy of the ordinance, or notice

thereof, to be recorded in the office of the County 
Recorder. (Added Ord. 414-85, App. 9/17/85) 

SEC. 1109. PRESERVATION LOTS: 
ELIGIBILITY FOR TRANSFER OF 
DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS. 

For the purpose of transfer of development 
rights (TDR) as provided in Section 128 of this 
Code, lots on which are located Significant or 
Contributory Buildings, or Category V Buildings 
in those certain Conservation Districts and por- 
tions thereof as indicated in Section 8 of the 
Appendix relating to that District are eligible 
preservation lots as provided in this Section: 

(a) Significant Buildings. Lots on which 
are located buildings designated as Significant 
Buildings - Category I or Category II - are 
eligible to transfer the difference between the 
allowable gross floor area permitted on the lot by 
Section 124 of this Code and the gross floor area 
of the development on the lot, if all the require- 
ments for transfer set forth in Section 128 are 
met. Lots on which are located Significant Build- 
ings which have been altered in conformance 
with the provisions of this Article retain eligibil- 
ity for the transfer of TDR. 

(b) Contributory Buildings. Lots on which 
are located buildings designated as Contributory 
Buildings - Category III or Category IV - are 
eligible to transfer the difference between the 
allowable gross floor area permitted on the lot by 
Section 124 of the Code and the gross floor area 
of the development on the lot, if all the require- 
ments for transfer set forth in Section 128 are 
met. Alteration or demolition of such a building 
in violation of Section 1110 or Section 1112, or 
alterations made without a permit issued pursu- 
ant to Sections 1111 through 1111.6, eliminates 
eligibility for the transfer of TDR; provided, 
however, that such eligibility may nonetheless 
be retained or acquired again if, pursuant to 
Section 1114(b), the property owner demon- 
strates as to any alteration that it was not major, 
or if the property owner restores the demolished 
or altered building. Once any TDR have been 
transferred from a Contributory Building, the 
building is subject to the same restrictions on 



demolition and alteration as a Significant Build- 
ing. These restrictions may not be removed by 
the transfer of TDR back to the building. 

(c) Category V Buildings in Conserva- 
tion Districts. Where explicitly permitted in 
Section 8 of the Appendix establishing a Conser- 
vation District, lots located in such a District on 
which are located Category V Buildings (desig- 
nated as neither Significant nor Contributory) 
are eligible to transfer the difference between 
the allowable gross floor area permitted on the 
lot under Section 124 of the Code and the gross 
floor area of the development on the lot, if all the 
requirements for transfer set forth in Section 
128 are met; provided, however, that a lot is 
eligible as a Preservation Lot pursuant to this 
Section only if (1) the exterior of the building is 
substantially altered so as to make it compatible 
with the scale and character of the Significant 
and Contributory Buildings in the district, in- 
cluding those features described in Sections 6 
and 7 of the Appendix to Article 11 describing the 
relevant district, and has thus been determined 
a Compatible Rehabilitation, and the building 
meets or has been reinforced to meet the stan- 
dards for seismic loads and forces of the 1975 
Building Code or (2) the building on the lot is 
new, having replaced a Category V Building, and 
has received approval as a Compatible Replace- 
ment Building, pursuant to Section 1113. The 
procedures governing these determinations are 
set forth in Section 309. (Added Ord. 4:14-85, 
App. 9/17/85) 

SEC. 1110. ALTERATION OF 
SIGNIFICANT OR CONTRIBUTORY 
BUILDINGS OR BUILDINGS IN 
CONSERVATION DISTRICTS. 

With respect to a designated Significant or 
Contributory Building or any Category V Build- 
ing in a Conservation District, no person shall 
carry out or cause to be carried out any alter- 
ation to the exterior of a building for which a 
permit is required pursuant to the Building Code 
unless the permit is approved pursuant to the 
provisions of Sections 1111 through 1111.6 of this 
Article; provided, however, that this approval is 
not required with respect to the owner of a

Sec. 1111.1. 



Contributory Building of Category III who has 
not transferred any TDR and who elects to 
proceed with a major alteration without refer- 
ence to Sections 1111 through 1111.6. Election to 
proceed without a permit pursuant to this Sec- 
tion may be made at the time that the Zoning 
Administrator determines that the proposed al- 
teration is major pursuant to Section 1111.1. If 
no election is made at the time of the Zoning 
Administrator&apos;s determination that an alter- 
ation is major, the applicant may make such 
election at any time thereafter. Review under 
Sections 1111 through 1111.6 shall cease after 
such election has been made and the permit 
shall be processed without regard to the require- 
ments of that Section. Election shall be made in 
writing on a form provided by the Zoning Admin- 
istrator. Where an owner elects not to proceed 
pursuant to Sections 1111 through 1111.6, the 
proposed alteration for which the application is 
filed shall be deemed not to meet the require- 
ments of Section 1111.6, and if the alteration 
permit is issued and work commenced thereun- 
der, the Zoning Administrator shall not issue a 
Statement of Eligibility for the lot on which the 
building is located. (Added Ord. 414-85, App. 
9/17/85) 

SEC. 1111. APPLICATIONS FOR 
PERMITS TO ALTER. 

The Zoning Administrator may define catego- 
ries of alterations which are deemed to be minor 
alterations and individual permits falling within 
those categories shall be reviewed and acted 
upon without referral to the Zoning Administra- 
tor for review pursuant to Sections 1111 through 
1111.6. All other applications for permits to un- 
dertake any alteration of a building designated 
Significant or Contributory or a building in any 
Conservation District shall be referred to the 
Zoning Administrator by the Central Permit 
Bureau within five days of receipt. An applicant 
for a major alteration permit for a Category V 
Building in any of the Conservation Districts 
which provides for such eligibility may request 
on the application a determination that if the 
proposed alteration is completed as approved, 
the building will be deemed a Compatible Reha- 



bilitation under Section 1109(c) so that the lot on 
which the building is located becomes eligible as 
a Preservation Lot for the transfer of TDR. 
(Added Ord. 414-85, App. 9/17/85) 

SEC. 1111.1. DETERMINATION OF 
MAJOR ALTERATION. 

Within 10 days after referral by the Central 
Permit Bureau, the Zoning Administrator shall 
determine in writing if the proposed alteration is 
a Major Alteration or a Minor Alteration. 

(a) An alteration is considered Major if any 
of the following apply: 

(1) The alteration will substantially change, 
obscure or destroy exterior character-defining 
spaces, materials, features or finishes; or 

(2) The alteration would affect all or any 
substantial part of a building&apos;s structural ele- 
ments, exterior walls or exterior ornamentation; 
or 

(3) The alteration occurs by virtue of con- 
struction which results in a substantial addition 
of height above the height of the building. 

(b) An alteration is considered minor if: 

(1) The criteria set forth in Subsection (a) 
do not apply; or 

(2) It is an alteration of the ground-floor 
display areas within the architectural frame 
(piers and lintels) of the building to meet the 
needs of first-floor commercial uses; or 

(3) The sole purpose and effect of the alter- 
ation is to comply with the UMB Seismic Retrofit 
Ordinances and the Zoning Administrator deter- 
mines that the proposed work complies with the 
UMB Retrofit Architectural Design Guidelines, 
which guidelines shall be adopted by the Plan- 
ning Commission. 

(c) The Zoning Administrator shall mail to 
the applicant and any individuals or organiza- 
tions who so request the written determination 
as to the category of the proposed alteration. 
Decisions of the Zoning Administrator may be 
appealed to the Board of Permit Appeals within 
10 days of the written determination in the 
manner provided in Section 308.2.

dation. 

(b) Simultaneously with the proceedings be- 
fore the Landmarks Board, the application shall

Planning shall be placed on the consent calendar 
of the City Planning Commission; provided, how- 
ever, that upon the request of the applicant or of 
any person prior to the City Planning Commis- 
sion meeting or by a member of the Commission 
at the meeting, the matter may be removed from 
the consent calendar and calendared for a public 
hearing before the Planning Commission at a 
later meeting, which shall be the next regular 
meeting of the Commission unless the applicant 
otherwise consents. 

(b) Notice of the time, place and purpose of

approve or approve with conditions an applica- 
tion for an alteration permit and, where appli- 
cable, for a determination that the building is a 
Compatible Rehabilitation, and shall make find- 
ings in support of its decision. If the Planning

Sec. 1111.6. 



Commission approves the recommendation of 
the Director of Planning, it may adopt or modify 
the findings of the Director of Planning as ap- 
propriate. Where the Planning Commission dis- 
approves the recommendations of the Director of 
Planning, it shall make findings supporting its 
decision. If the Commission disapproves the ap- 
plication for a permit to alter, it shall recommend 
disapproval to the Central Permit Bureau which 
shall deny the application. The Planning 
Commission&apos;s determination that a building quali- 
fies or fails to qualify as a Compatible Rehabili- 
tation is a final administrative decision. Any 
decision of the Planning Commission rendered 
pursuant to this Section shall be rendered within 
30 days from the date of conclusion of the hear- 
ing. (Added Ord. 414-85, App. 9/17/85) 

SEC. 1111.6. STANDARDS AND 
REQUIREMENTS FOR REVIEW OF 
APPLICATIONS FOR ALTERATIONS. 

The Board of Permit Appeals, the City Plan- 
ning Commission, the Director of Planning, and 
the Landmarks Board shall be governed by the 
following standards in the review of applications 
for major alteration permits. 

(a) The proposed alteration shall be consis- 
tent with and appropriate for the effectuation of 
the purposes of this Article 11. 

(b) For Significant Buildings - Categories I 
and II, and for Contributory Buildings - Catego- 
ries III and IV, proposed alterations of structural 
elements and exterior features shall be consis- 
tent with the architectural character of the build- 
ing, and shall comply with the following specific 
requirements: 

(1) The distinguishing original qualities or 
character of the building may not be damaged or 
destroyed. Any distinctive architectural feature 
which affects the overall appearance of the build- 
ing shall not be removed or altered unless it is 
the only feasible means to protect the public 
safety. 

(2) The integrity of distinctive stylistic fea- 
tures or examples of skilled craftsmanship that 
characterize a building shall be preserved. 



(3) Distinctive architectural features which 
are to be retained pursuant to Paragraph (1) but 
which are deteriorated shall be repaired rather 
than replaced, whenever possible. In the event 
replacement is necessary, the new material shall 
match the material being replaced in composi- 
tion, design, color, texture and other visual quali- 
ties. Repair or replacement of missing architec- 
tural features shall be based on accurate 
duplication of features, substantiated by his- 
toric, physical or pictorial evidence, if available, 
rather than on conjectural designs or the avail- 
ability of different architectural elements from 
other buildings or structures. Replacement of 
nonvisible structural elements need not match 
or duplicate the material being replaced. 

(4) Contemporary design of alterations is 
permitted, provided that such alterations do not 
destroy significant exterior architectural mate- 
rial and that such design is compatible with the 
size, scale, color, material and character of the 
building and its surroundings. 

(5) The degree to which distinctive features 
need be retained may be less when the alteration 
is to exterior elements not constituting a part of 
a principal facade or when it is an alteration of 
the ground-floor frontage in order to adapt the 
space for ground-floor uses. 

(6) In the case of Significant Buildings - 
Category I, any additions to height of the build- 
ing (including addition of mechanical equip- 
ment) shall be limited to one story above the 
height of the existing roof, shall be compatible 
with the scale and character of the building, and 
shall in no event cover more than 75 percent of 
the roof area. 

(7) In the case of Significant Buildings - 
Category II, a new structure or addition, includ- 
ing one of greater height than the existing build- 
ing, may be permitted on that portion of the lot 
not restricted in Appendix B even if such struc- 
ture or addition will be visible when viewing the 
principal facades at ground level, provided that 
the structure or addition does not affect the 
appearance of the retained portion as a separate 
structure when so viewing the principal facades 
and is compatible in form and design with the 



Supp. No. 1, September 2006 



Sec. 1111.6. 



San Francisco - Planning Code 



1512 



retained portion. Alteration of the retained por- 
tion of the building is permitted as provided in 
Paragraphs (1) through (6) of this Subsection (b). 

(c) Within Conservation Districts, all major 
exterior alterations, of Category V Buildings, 
shall be compatible in scale and design with the 
District as set forth in Sections 6 and 7 of the 
Appendix which describes the District. (Added 
Ord. 414-85, App. 9/17/85) 

SEC. 1111.7. PERMITS FOR SIGNS. 

(a) Installation of a new general advertising 
sign is prohibited in any Historic District or 
Conservation District or on any historic property 
regulated by this Article 11. 

(b) Wherever a permit for a sign is required 
pursuant to Article 6 of this Code, an application 
for such permit shall be governed by the provi- 
sions of this Section in addition to those of Article 
6. 

(c) Apart from and in addition to any grounds 
for approval or disapproval of the application 
under Article 6, an application involving a per- 
mit for a business sign, or general advertising 
sign, identifying sign, or nameplate to be located 
on a Significant or Contributory Building or any 
building in a Conservation District may be dis- 
approved, or approved subject to conditions if the 
proposed location, materials, means of illumina- 
tion or method or replacement of attachment 
would adversely affect the special architectural, 
historical or aesthetic significance of the build- 
ing or the Conservation District. No application 
shall be denied on the basis of the content of the 
sign. 

(d) The Director of Planning shall make the 
determination required pursuant to Subsection 
(b). Any permit applicant may appeal the deter- 
mination of the Director of Planning to the City 
Planning Commission by filing a notice of appeal 
with the Secretary of the Commission within 10 
days of the determination. The City Planning 
Commission shall hear the appeal and make its 
determination within 30 days of the filing of the 
notice of appeal. (Added Ord. 414-85, App. 9/17/

SEC. 1112.2. DISPOSITION OF 
APPLICATIONS TO DEMOLISH 
CONTRIBUTORY BUILDINGS AND 
UNRATED BUILDINGS IN 
CONSERVATION DISTRICTS. 

(a) The Zoning Administrator shall deter- 
mine, within five days of acceptance of a com- 
plete application, the designation of the building 
and, with respect to Contributory Buildings, 
whether any TDR have been transferred from 
the lots of such buildings. 

(b) If the Zoning Administrator determines 
that TDR have been transferred from the lot of a 
Contributory Building, the application for demo- 
lition of that building shall be reviewed and 
acted upon as if it applied to a Significant Build- 
ing. 

(c) The Zoning Administrator shall approve 
any application for demolition of a Contributory 
Building in a Conservation District from which 
no TDR have been transferred, or an Unrated 
Building located in a Conservation District, if a 
building or site permit has been lawfully issued 
for a replacement structure on the site, in com- 
pliance with Section 1113. The Zoning Adminis- 



trator shall approve an application for demoli- 
tion of a Significant Building - Category II if a 
building or site permit has been lawfully issued 
for an alteration or replacement structure on the 
portion of the site which would be affected by the 
demolition, in compliance with Section 1111.6(b)(7). 

The Zoning Administrator shall disapprove 
any application for a demolition permit where 
the foregoing requirement has not been met; 
provided, however, that the Zoning Administra- 
tor shall approve any otherwise satisfactory ap- 
plication for such a permit notwithstanding the 
fact that no permit has been obtained for a 
replacement structure if the standards of Section 
1112.7 for allowing demolition of a Significant 
Building are met. 

(d) The Zoning Administrator shall approve 
applications to permit demolition of a Contribu- 
tory Building - Category III from which no TDR 
have been transferred only if a building or site 
permit for a replacement building on the same 
site has been approved, and it has been found, 
pursuant to review under the procedural provi- 
sions of Section 309, that the proposed replace- 
ment will not adversely affect the character, 
scale or design qualities of the general area in 
which it is located, either by reason of the quality 
of the proposed design or by virtue of the relation 
of the replacement structure or structures to 
their setting. Notwithstanding the preceding sen- 
tence, the Zoning Administrator shall approve 
any such demolition permit application if the 
standards of Section 1112.7 for allowing demoli- 
tion of a Significant Building are met. (Added

in this Section in their review of applications for 
a permit to demolish any Significant or Coutribu- 
tory Building from which TDR have been trans- 
ferred. 

No demolition permit may be approved un- 
less: (1) it is determined that under the designa- 
tion, taking into account the value of Transfer- 
able Development Rights and costs of 
rehabilitation to meet the requirements of the 
Building Code or other City, State or federal 
laws, the property retains no substantial remain- 
ing market value or reasonable use; or (2) the 
Superintendent of the Bureau of Building Inspec- 
tion or the Chief of the Bureau of Fire Prevention 
and Public Safety determines, after consultation, 
to the extent feasible, with the Department of 
City Planning, that an imminent safety hazard 
exists and that demolition of the structure is the 
only feasible means to secure the public safety. 
Costs of rehabilitation necessitated by alter- 
ations made in violation of Section 1110, by 
demolition in violation of Section 1112, or by 
failure to maintain the property in violation of 
Section 1117, may not be included in the calcu- 
lation of rehabilitation costs under Subsection 
(1). (Added Ord. 414-85, App. 9/17/85) 

SEC. 1113. NEW AND REPLACEMENT 
CONSTRUCTION IN CONSERVATION 
DISTRICTS. 

No person shall construct or cause to be 
constructed any new or replacement structure or 
add to any existing structure in a Conservation 
District unless it is found that such construction 
is compatible in scale and design with the Dis- 
trict as set forth in Sections 6 and 7 of the 
Appendix which describes the District. Applica- 
tions for a building or site permit to constmct or 
add to a structure in any Conservation District 
shall be reviewed pursuant to the procedures set 
forth in Section 309 and shall only be approved 
pursuant to Section 309 if they meet the: stan- 
dards set forth herein, if a building or site permit 
application for construction of a building is ap- 
proved pursuant to this Section and if the build- 
ing is constructed in accordance with such ap- 
proval, and if the buildings located in a 
Conservation District for which, pursuant to

Preservation of Buildings and Districts of Architectural, 
Historical, and Aesthetic Importance in the C-3 Districts 



Sec. 1115. 



Section 8 of the Appendix establishing that dis- 
trict, such a transfer is permitted, the building 
shall be deemed a Compatible Replacement Build- 
ing, and the lot on which such building is located 
shall be eligible as a Preservation Lot for the 
transfer of TDR. (Added Ord. 414-85, App. 9/17/ 
85) 

SEC. 1114. UNLAWFUL ALTERATION OR 
DEMOLITION. 

(a) In addition to any other penalties pro- 
vided in Section 1119 or elsewhere, alteration or 
demolition of a Significant or Contributory Build- 
ing or any building within a Conservation Dis- 
trict in violation of the provisions of this Article 
shall eliminate the eligibility of the building&apos;s lot 
as a Preservation Lot, and such lot, if it is the 
site of an unlawfully demolished Significant Build- 
ing, or Contributory Building from which TDR 
have been transferred, may not be developed in 
excess of the floor area ratio of the demolished 
building for a period of 20 years from the unlaw- 
ful demolition. No department shall approve or 
issue a permit that would authorize construction 
of a structure contrary to the provisions of this 
Section. 

(b) A property owner may be relieved of the 
penalties provided in Subsection (a) if: (1) as to 
an unlawful alteration or demolition, the owner 
can demonstrate to the Zoning Administrator 
that the violation did not constitute a major 
alteration as defined in Section 1111.1; or (2) as 
to an unlawful alteration, the owner restores the 
original distinguishing qualities and character of 
the building destroyed or altered, including ex- 
terior character-defining spaces, materials, fea- 
tures, finishes, exterior walls and exterior orna- 
mentation. A property owner who wishes to effect 
a restoration pursuant to Subsection (b)(2) shall, 
in connection with the filing of a building or site 
permit application, seek approval of the pro- 
posed restoration by reference to the provisions 
of this Section. If the application is approved and 
it is determined that the proposed work will 
effect adequate restoration, the City Planning 
Commission shall so find. Upon such approval, 
and the completion of such work, the lot shall 
again become an eligible Preservation Lot and 



the limitation on floor area ratio set forth in 
Subsection (a) shall not thereafter apply. The 
City Planning Commission may not approve the 
restoration unless it first finds that the restora- 
tion can be done with a substantial degree of 
success. The determination under this Subsec- 
tion (b)(2) is a final administrative decision.

SEC. 1115. CONFORMITY WITH OTHER 
CITY PERMIT PROCESSES. 

Except where explicitly so stated, nothing in 
this Article shall be construed as relieving any 
person from other applicable permit require- 
ments. The following requirements are intended 
to insure conformity between existing City per- 
mit processes and the provisions of this Article: 

(a) Upon the designation of a building as a 
Significant or Contributory Building, or upon the 
designation of the Conservation District, the 
Zoning Administrator shall inform the Central 
Permit Bureau of said designation or, in the case 
of a Conservation District, of the boundaries of 
said District and a complete list of all the build- 
ings within said District and their designations. 
The Central Permit Bureau shall maintain a 
current record of such Buildings and Conserva- 
tion Districts. 

(b) Upon receipt of any application for a 
building permit, demolition permit, site permit, 
alteration permit, or any other permit relating to 
a Significant or Contributory Building or a build- 
ing within a designated Conservation District, 
the Central Permit Bureau shall forward such 
application to the Department of City Planning, 
except as provided in Section 1111. If the Zoning 
Administrator determines that the application is 
subject to provisions of this Article, processing 
shall proceed under the provisions of this Article. 
The Central Permit Bureau shall not issue any 
permit for construction, alteration, removal or 
demolition of any structure, or for any work 
involving a Significant or Contributory Building 
or a building within a Conservation District 
unless either the Zoning Administrator has de- 
termined that such application is exempt from

under this Article have been obtained. The issu- 
ance of any permit by a City department or 
agency that is inconsistent with any provision of 
this Article may be revoked by the Superinten- 
dent of the Bureau of Building Inspection pursu- 
ant to Section 303(e) of the San Francisco Build- 
ing Code. 

(c) No abatement proceedings or enforce- 
ment proceedings shall be undertaken by any 
department of the City for a Significant or Con- 
tributory building or a building within a Conser- 
vation District without, to the extent feasible, 
prior notification of the Department of City Plan- 
ning. Such proceedings shall comply with the 
provisions of this Article where feasible. (Added 
by Ord. 414-25, App. 9/17/85) 

SEC. 1116. UNSAFE OR DANGEROUS 
CONDITIONS. 

Where the Superintendent of the Bureau of 
Building Inspection or the Chief of the Bureau of 
Fire Prevention and Public Safety determines 
that a condition on or within a Significant or 
Contributory Building is unsafe or dangerous 
and determines further that repair or other work 
rather than demolition will not threaten the 
public safety, said official shall, after consulting 
with the Department of City Planning, to the 
extent feasible, determine the measures of re- 
pair or other work necessary to correct the con- 
dition in a manner which, insofar as it does not 
conflict with State or local requirements, is con- 
sistent with the purposes and standards set 
forth in this Article. (Added by Ord. 414-85, App. 
9/17/85) 

SEC. 1117. MAINTENANCE 
REQUIREMENTS AND ENFORCEMENT 
THEREOF. 

(a) Maintenance. The owner, lessee, or other 
person in actual charge of a Significant or Con- 
tributory Building shall comply with all appli- 
cable codes, laws and regulations governing the 
maintenance of property. It is the intent of this 
Section to preserve from deliberate or inadvert- 
ent neglect the exterior features of buildings 
designated Significant or Contributory, and the 
interior portions thereof when such maintenance 



is necessary to prevent deterioration and decay 
of the exterior. All such buildings shall be pre- 
served against such decay and deterioration and 
free from structural defects through prompt cor- 
rections of any of the following defects: 

(1) Facades which may fall and injure mem- 
bers of the public or property; 

(2) Deteriorated or inadequate foundation, 
defective or deteriorated flooring or floor sup- 
ports, deteriorated walls or other vertical struc- 
tural supports; 

(3) Members of ceilings, roofs, ceiling and 
roof supports or other horizontal members which 
sag, split or buckle due to defective material or 
deterioration; 

(4) Deteriorated or ineffective waterproof- 
ing of exterior walls, roofs, foundations or floors, 
including broken windows or doors; 

(5) Defective or insufficient weather protec- 
tion for exterior wall covering, including lack of 
paint or weathering due to lack of paint or other 
protective covering; 

(6) Any fault or defect in the building; which 
renders it not properly watertight or structurally 
unsafe. 

(b) Enforcement Procedures. The proce- 
dures set forth in Building Code Section 203 
governing unsafe buildings or property shall be 
applicable to any violations of this Section. (Added 
by Ord. 414-85, App. 9/17/85) 

SEC. 1119. ENFORCEMENT AND 
PENALTIES. 

Enforcement and Penalties shall be as pro- 
vided in Sections 176 and 176.1 of this Code.

10. 



RELATIONSHIP TO ARTICLE 



Buildings or areas within the C-3 District 
designated pursuant to the provisions of both 
Article 10 and Article 11 shall be regulated 
pursuant to the procedures of both Articles. In 
case of conflict, the more restrictive provision 
shall control. 

Notwithstanding the rating of a building in a 
C-3 District pursuant to the provisions of Article 
11, buildings may be designated as landmarks 
according to the provisions of Article 10. 

Where an appeal is taken from a decision 
regarding alteration of a building which is both a 
landmark under Article 10 and a Significant or 
Contributory Building under Article 11, the ap- 
peal shall be taken to the Board of Supervisors 
pursuant to the provisions of Article 10. (Added 
by Ord. 414-85, App. 9/17/85) 



SEC. 1124. SEVERABILITY. 

If any part of this Article 11 is held to be 
unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall 
not affect the validity of the remaining portions 
of this Article 11 or any part thereof. The Board 
of Supervisors hereby declares that it would 
have passed all portions of this Article irrespec- 
tive of the fact that any one or more portions be 
declared unconstitutional or invalid. (Added by 
Ord. 414-85, App. 9/17/85) 



SEC. 1121. NOTICE OF AMENDMENT. 

Notice of any hearing before the City Plan- 
ning Commission, or, if no hearing, notice of the 
first hearing before the Board of Supervisors, of 
a proposed amendment to this Article which 
materially alters the limitations and require- 
ments applicable to any building or class of 
buildings shall be given to the owners of such 
buildings by mail. (Added by Ord. 414-85, App. 
9/17/85) 

SEC. 1122. NOTICE PROCEDURE. 

When any provision of this Article requires 
notice by mail to a property owner, the officer or 
body providing the notice shall use for this 
purpose the names and addresses as shown on 
the latest citywide Assessment Roll in the 
Assessor&apos;s Office. (Added by Ord. 414-85, App. 
9/17/85) 



SEC. 1123. TIME PROVISIONS. 

Unless otherwise indicated, all time provi- 
sions governing the taking of action by City 
officials are directory and not mandatory. (Added 
by Ord. 414-85, App. 9/17/85)

SEC. 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 

It is hereby found that the area known and 
described in this Appendix as the Kearny-Market- 
Mason-Sutter Street area is a Subarea within 
the C-3 District that possesses concentrations of 
buildings that together create a subarea of archi- 
tectural and environmental quality and impor- 
tance which contributes to the beauty and attrac- 
tiveness of the City. It is further found that the 
area meets the standards for designation of a 
Conservation District as set forth in Section 1103 
of Article 11 and that the designation of said area 
as a Conservation District will be in furtherance 
of and in conformance with the purposes of 
Article 11 of the City Planning Code. 

This designation is intended to promote the 
health, safety, prosperity and welfare of the 
people of the City through the effectuation of the 
purposes set forth in Section 1101 of Article 11 
and the maintenance of the scale and character 
of the Kearny-Market-Mason-Sutter area by: 

(a) The protection and preservation of the 
basic characteristics and salient architectural 
details of structures insofar as these character- 
istics and details are compatible with the Con- 
servation District; 

(b) Providing scope for the continuing vital- 
ity of the District through private renewal and 
architectural creativity, within appropriate con- 
trols and standards. It is intended to foster a 
climate in which the Kearny-Market-Mason- 



Sutter District may continue as the prime Bay 
Area retail district and a center for tourists from 
around the country and the world; 

(c) The maintenance of an identity separate 
from the financial district by maintaining the 
relatively small scale and sunlit sidewalks and 
open spaces. (Added Ord. 414-85, App. 9/17/85)

SEC. 5. JUSTIFICATION. 

The characteristics of the Conservation Dis- 
trict justifying its designation are as follows: 

(a) History of the District. Since the 
Kearny-Market-Mason-Sutter District covers a 
large area, individual streets within the district 
have had unique histories which have often 
changed dramatically over time. Maiden Lane 
(originally called Morton Street) was once the 
site of numerous houses of prostitution. Yet, 
after the fire and the opening of nearby depart- 
ment stores the renamed Union Square Avenue 
became the service entrance for those stores. In 
time, restaurants and retail stores opened, pav- 
ing the way for the emergence of Maiden Lane as 
an exclusive retail address. Similarly, before the 
earthquake Powell Street, home to many the- 
aters and restaurants, was known as the &quot;up- 
town tenderloin.&quot; In the 1920&apos;s, the opening of 
numerous hotels and retail stores led to a gradual 
change of character on the street. 

These changing land-use patterns were in 
part determined by the movement of high- 
quality retail stores. Throughout the years, the 
closing or movement of larger department stores 
has often provided new space for smaller stores, 
and has strongly influenced their locations. The 
best known stores of the retail district were 
located on Kearny Street in the 1870&apos;s and 
1880&apos;s. The growth of the City, due in part to the 
introduction of cable car service, led to the move- 
ment of the retail district towards both Market 
Street and the Grant Avenue/Union Square area. 
Beginning in the 1880&apos;s, department stores such 
as the Emporium and Hale Brothers opened 
large stores on Market Street. However, the 
large width of Market Street and its distance 
from high income residential neighborhoods on 
Nob Hill hindered its further development as a 
high class retail district. By the 1920&apos;s, Market 
Street had become San Francisco&apos;s family shop- 
ping street. 

The prominence of the Grant Avenue/Union 
Square retail area as an exclusive shopping 
district was assured when I. Magnin (originally 
on Third Street) moved from Market Street to 
the corner of Grant Avenue and Geary Street. 



The location of the City of Paris at the corner of 
Geary and Stockton Streets across from Union 
Square firmly established Union Square as the 
most desirable location in the retail district. I. 
Magnin eventually moved to a building across 
from Union Square and O&apos;Connor Moffat (now 
Macys) located at the corner of Geary and Stock- 
ton Streets. A side effect of the development of 
Union Square as a retail district was the dis- 
placement of many medical and dental offices by 
beauty parlors and restaurants catering to the 
new retail trade. Since the 1920&apos;s, Lower Grant 
Avenue and the Union Square area have been 
the City&apos;s premier shopping district. 

Concurrent with the development of Grant 
Avenue/Union Square as a retail district were 
the relocations of the hotel and theater districts. 
By the 1890&apos;s, the theater district relocated from 
Bush Street (between Grant and Kearny) to the 
area west of Union Square. Whereas hotels were 
once clustered at the intersection of Montgomery 
and Market Streets, after the 1906 Fire most 
hotels also moved to the area west of Union 
Square. The establishment of the St. Francis 
Hotel on the west side of the square was a major 
impetus to the hotel relocation. Before the fire, 
this area had been the site of many household 
goods establishments. 

(b) Basic Nature of the District. The 

pattern of development is one of small-scaled, 
light- colored buildings predominantly four to 
eight stories in height. The height and scale 
provide for a streetscape which is attractive to 
the pedestrian because of the comfortable scale 
and sunlit sidewalks. This dense area is the 
heart of San Francisco&apos;s retail and tourist sec- 
tors, containing a concentration of fine shops, 
department stores, theaters, hotels, and restau- 
rants. As such, it is one of the main attractions to 
tourists from around the country and world, as 
well as the prime retail district in the Bay Area. 
The District is further defined by the location of 
Union Square in its heart. This square is, in 
many ways, the premier public open space in the 
City, as well as a primary public forum. 

(c) Architectural Character. The charac- 
ter of the area is determined by the many fine 
quality structures, among the best in the City, 



1547 



Preservation of Buildings and Districts of Architectural, 

Historical, and Aesthetic Importance in the C-3 Districts 



App. E, Sec. 6. 



and supported by a number of contributory build- 
ings. Since the entire area was built in less than 
20 years, and the major portion in less than 10 
years, buildings were constructed in similar styles 
and structural technology. Perhaps even more 
importantly, architects were of like backgrounds, 
schooled in the classical Beaux Arts tradition. 

In addition to their individual architectural 
features, the scale and design of buildings in the 
district related very well with neighboring build- 
ings, streets and open spaces. This effect was 
achieved in large part by the alignment of cor- 
nice and belt course lines. The buildings used 
compatible detailing, colors, materials, massing, 
and scale. Ornament was derived from Classical, 
Renaissance, Gothic and Romanesque sources. 
In a limited number of examples, ornament was 
developed from early Spanish Colonial models. 

(d) Uniqueness and Location. The 
District&apos;s character, although it has many build- 
ings of recent vintage, is largely intact. It is one 
of the few homogeneous collections of early Twen- 
tieth Century commercial architecture of its type 
in the United States. Of a total of 324 buildings 
in this District, 114 are architecturally signifi- 
cant and 140 are contributory. Only 98 buildings 
are not rated. Union Square, an integral part of 
the District, is a unique resource and ranks with 
the finest open spaces in the country. The area is 
centrally located and easily accessible to the 
Financial District, Nob Hill, the Tenderloin, and 
the South of Market, as well as outlying districts 
of the City. The Powell Street Cable Car lines is 
a unique feature which relates the area to the 
entire northeastern quadrant of the City and 
attracts tourists to the area. 

(e) Visual and Functional Unity. The char- 
acter of the area is determined by a series of 
buildings whose compositions and use of materi- 
als and ornament are complementary, as well as 
by the regular street pattern which creates in- 
teresting views and vistas down the streets. 
Within the District, several subareas increase 
the variety and complexity of the District while 
retaining its essential architectural character. 

(f) Dynamic Continuity. The District is 
the center of San Francisco&apos;s retail market and is 
constantly responding to new trends and needs. 



The area has seen the recent opening of two 
major department stores and, in addition, many 
new small stores. Indeed, much of the pedestrian 
interest so important to the District is a result of 
the ever-changing shop windows and stores. 

(g) Benefits to the City and its Resi- 
dents. The District provides a wide range of 
benefits to both the City and its residents. Much 
of the retailing area&apos;s vitality is attributable to 
its physical character. The mix of shops and 
unique buildings is not duplicated in suburban 
shopping malls, and, because of this, the area 
attracts shoppers from around the Bay Area. The 
District is a prime destination for tourists and is 
therefore an important part of San Francisco&apos;s 
image. The prevailing architectural character is 
an important legacy from the Beaux Arts tradi- 
tion and contains many fine examples of com- 
mercial architecture. (Added Ord. 414-85, App. 
9/17/85) 

SEC. 6. FEATURES. 

The exterior architectural features of the 
Kearny-Market-Mason-Sutter Conservation Dis- 
trict are as follows: 

(a) Massing and Composition. The com- 
positions of the building facades reflect the dif- 
ferent architectural functions of the building. 
For the most part, building facades in the district 
are two- or three-part vertical compositions con- 
sisting either of a base and a shaft, or a base, a 
shaft and a capital. In more elaborate designs, 
transitional stories create a stacked composition, 
but the design effect is similar. 

In addition, the facade of a building is often 
divided into bays expressing the structure (com- 
monly steel and reinforced concrete) beneath the 
facade. This was accomplished through fenestra- 
tion, structural articulation or other detailing 
which serves to break the facade into discrete 
segments. A common compositional device in the 
District is an emphasis placed upon either the 
end bays or the central bay. 

The massing of the structures is usually a 
simple vertically oriented rectangle with a ratio 
of width to height generally from 1:2 to 1:4. This 
vertically oriented massing is an important char- 



App. E, Sec. 6. 



San Francisco - Planning Code 



1548 



acteristic of the District. In addition, continuous 
streetwall heights are a characteristic of most 
blockfronts. 

Almost without exception, the buildings in 
the Kearny-Market-Mason-Sutter Conservation 
District are built to the front property line and 
occupy the entire site. Where buildings have not 
followed this rule, they do not adequately enclose 
the street. The massing of structures often re- 
flects unique or prominent site characteristics. 
Corner buildings often have rounded corner bays 
to express the special requirements of the site 
and to tie its two blockfronts together. 

(b) Scale. The buildings are of small to 
medium scale. The bay width is generally from 
20 feet to 30 feet. Heights generally range from 
four to eight stories on lots 40 feet to 80 feet 
wide, although a number of taller buildings 
exist. The wider frontages are often broken up by 
articulation of the facade, making the buildings 
appear narrower. The base is generally delin- 
eated from the rest of the building giving the 
District an intimate scale at the street. 

(c) Materials and Colors. Buildings are 
usually clad in masonry materials over a sup- 
porting structure. The cladding materials in- 
clude terra cotta, brick, stone and stucco. Wood, 
metal and metal panels are not facade materials, 
although painted wood and metal are sometimes 
used for window sash and ornament. 

The materials are generally colored light or 
medium earth tones, including white, cream, 
buff, yellow, and brown. Individual buildings 
generally use a few different tones of one color. 

To express the mass and weight of the struc- 
ture, masonry materials are used on multidimen- 
sional wall surfaces with texture and depth, 
which simulates the qualities necessary to sup- 
port the weight of a load-bearing wall. 

(d) Detailing and Ornamentation. This 
area has been the heart of the retail district since 
it was reconstructed after the fire. Buildings use 
the expression of texture and depth on masonry 
material (e.g., rustication, deep window reveals) 
to simulate the appearance of load-bearing walls. 
The buildings are not constructed in a single 
style, but with ornament drawn from a variety of 



historical sources, primarily Classical and Re- 
naissance. Gothic detailing is also well repre- 
sented. Popular details include, arches, columns, 
pilasters, projecting bracketed cornices, multiple 
belt-courses, elaborate lintels and pediments, 
and decorated spandrels. Details were used to 
relate buildings to their neighbors by repeating 
and varying the ornament used in the surround- 
ing structures. (Added Ord. 414-85, App. 9/17/85) 

SEC. 7. STANDARDS AND GUIDELJtNES 
FOR REVIEW OF NEW CONSTRUCTION 
AND CERTAIN ALTERATIONS. 

(a) All construction of new buildings and all 
major alterations, which are subject to the pro- 
visions of Sections 1110, 1111 through 1111.6 and 
1113, shall be compatible with the District in 
general with respect to the building&apos;s composi- 
tion and massing, scale, materials and colors, 
and detailing and ornamentation, including those 
features described in Section 6 of this Appendix. 
Emphasis shall be placed on compatibility with 
those buildings in the area in which the new or 
altered building is located. In the case of major 
alterations, only those building characteristics 
that are affected by the proposed alteration shall 
be considered in assessing compatibility. Signs 
on buildings in conservation districts are subject 
to the provisions of Section 1111.7. 

The foregoing standards do not require, or 
even encourage, new buildings to imitate the 
styles of the past. Rather, they require the new to 
be compatible with the old. The determination of 
compatibility shall be made in accordance with 
the provisions of Section 309. 

(b) The guidelines in this Subsection are to 
be used in assessing compatibility. 

(1) Composition and Massing. Although 
the District is quite large and contains a wide 
variety of building forms, new construction should 
maintain its essential character by relating to 
the prevailing height, mass, proportions, rhythm 
and composition of existing Significant and Con- 
tributory Buildings. The height and massing of 
new buildings should not alter the traditional 
scale of existing buildings, streets and open 
spaces. In addition to the consideration of sun- 



1549 



Preservation of Buildings and Districts of Architectural, 

Historical, and Aesthetic Importance in the C-3 Districts 



App. E, Sec. 7. 



light access for the street, an appropriate street- 
wall height is established by reference to the 
prevailing height of the buildings on the block 
and especially that of adjacent buildings. If the 
adjacent buildings are of a significantly different 
height than the rest of the buildings on the block, 
then the prevailing height of buildings on the 
block should be used as a guide. A setback at the 
streetwall height can permit additional height 
above the setback without breaking the continu- 
ity of the street wall. 

Most existing buildings are built to the prop- 
erty or street line. This pattern, except in the 
case of carefully selected open spaces, should not 
be broken since it could damage the continuity of 
building rhythms and the definitions of streets. 

The standard proportions of new buildings 
should be established by the prevailing street- 
wall height and width of lots. To ensure that an 
established set of proportions is maintained, it is 
necessary to break up the facades of new build- 
ings into smaller sections that relate to those 
existing proportions. The use of smaller bays and 
multiple entrances are two ways of relating the 
rhythm of a new building with those of historic 
buildings. 

The design of a new structure should repeat 
the prevailing pattern of two- and three-part 
vertical compositions. A base element is neces- 
sary to define the pedestrian environment. This 
division of a building allows flexibility in the 
design of the ground story while encouraging a 
uniform treatment of the upper stories. 

(2) Scale. A major influence on scale is the 
degree to which the total facade plane is broken 
into smaller parts (by detailing, fenestration, 
bay widths) which relate to human scale. While 
department stores and hotels are of a medium 
scale, the traditional pattern for the District has 
consisted of small scale-buildings. The existing 
scale of the buildings in the vicinity should be 
maintained. This can be accomplished in a vari- 
ety of ways, including: a consistent use of size 
and complexity of detailing in regards to sur- 
rounding buildings, continuance of existing bay 
widths, maintenance of an existing streetwall 
height, and incorporation of a base element (of 



similar height) to maintain the pedestrian envi- 
ronment. Large wall surfaces, which increase a 
building&apos;s scale, should be broken up through the 
use of detailing and textural variation. 

Existing fenestration (windows, entrances) 
rhythms and proportions which have been estab- 
lished by lot width or bay width should be 
repeated in new structures. The spacing and size 
of window openings should follow the sequence 
set by Significant and Contributory structures. 
Large glass areas should be broken up by mul- 
lions so that the scale of glazed areas is compat- 
ible with that of neighboring buildings. Case- 
ment and double-hung windows should be used 
where possible. 

(3) Materials and Colors. The use of like 
materials can relate two buildings of obviously 
different eras and styles. Similarly, the use of 
materials that appear similar (such as substitut- 
ing concrete for stone) can link two disparate 
structures, or harmonize the appearance of a 
new structure with the architectural character of 
a conservation district. The preferred surface 
materials for this district are brick, stone, and 
concrete (simulated to look like terra cotta or 
stone). 

The texture of surfaces can be treated in a 
manner so as to emphasize the bearing function 
of the material, as is done in rustication on 
historic buildings. 

Traditional light colors should be used in 
order to blend in with the character of the 
district. Dissimilar buildings may be made more 
compatible by using similar or harmonious col- 
ors, and to a lesser extent, by using similar 
textures. 

(4) Detailing and Ornamentation. A new 

building should relate to the surrounding area 
by picking up elements from surrounding build- 
ings and repeating them or developing them for 
new purposes. Since the District has one of the 
largest collections of finely ornamented build- 
ings in the City, these buildings should serve as 
references for new buildings. Detailing of a simi- 
lar shape and placement can be used without 
directly copying historical ornament. The new 
structure should incorporate prevailing cornice

lines or belt courses and may also use a modern 
vernacular instead of that of the original model.

San Francisco - Planning Code 



1554 



The characteristics of the Conservation Dis- 
trict justifying its designation are as follows: 

(a) History of the District. This corridor 
forms one of the earliest attempts to extend the 
uses of the financial and retail districts to the 
South of Market area. Since Montgomery Street 
was the most important commercial street in the 
1870&apos;s, New r Montgomery Street was planned as 
a southern extension from Market Street to the 
Bay. Opposition from landowners south of Howard 
Street, however, prevented the street from reach- 
ing its original bayside destination. William Ral- 
ston, who was instrumental in the development 
of the new street, built the Grand Hotel and later 
the Palace Hotel at its Market Street intersec- 
tion. A w r all of large hotels on Market Street 
actually hindered the growth of New Montgom- 
ery Street and few 7 retail stores and offices ven- 
tured south of Market Street. The unusually 
wide width of Market Street acted as a barrier 
between areas to the north and south for many 
years. 

A small number of office buildings w r ere built 
on New Montgomery Street as far south as Atom 
Alley (now Natoma Street) after the fire. Many 
buildings were completed in 1907, and most of 
the street assumed its present character by 1914. 
At 74 New Montgomery Street, the Call newspa- 
per established its first headquarters. A notewor- 
thy addition to the streetscape was the Pacific 
Telephone and Telegraph Building. At the time of 
its completion in 1925, it was the largest build- 
ing on the West Coast devoted to the exclusive 
use of one firm. Until the 1960&apos;s, the office 
district on New r Montgomery Street was the 
furthest extension of the financial district into 
the South of Market area. More characteristic 
were warehouses and businesses which sup- 
ported the nearby office district. For example, 
the Furniture Exchange at the northwest corner 
of New Montgomery and Howard Streets, com- 
pleted in 1920, was oriented to other wholesale 
and showroom uses along Howard Street. 

One block to the east, Second Street had a 
different history from New Montgomery Street. 
The future of Second Street as an extension of 



the downtown depended upon the southward 
extension of the street through the hill south of 
Howard Street. At one time there was even a 
proposal to extend Second Street north in order 
to connect with Montgomery Street. The decision 
to extend Montgomery Street south rather than 
Second Street north due to the high cost of the 
Second Street Cut, however, discouraged retail 
and office growth on the street. As a result, by 
the 1880&apos;s Second Street was established as a 
wholesaling rather than retail or office area. In 
the 1.920&apos;s, Second Street contained a wide mix- 
ture of office support services. These included 
printers, binderies, a saddlery, a wholesale phar- 
maceutical outlet, and a variety of other retail 
stores and smaller offices. Industrial uses were 
commonly located on the alleyways such as Minna 
and Natoma and on Second Street, south of 
Howard Street. 

(b) Basic Nature of the District. New 

Montgomery Street is characterized by large 
buildings that often occupy an entire section of a 
block defined by streets and alleys or a major 
portion of these subbiocks. The building&apos;s are of a 
variety of heights, but the heights of most of the 
buildings range from five to eight stories. Second 
Street is characterized by smaller, less architec- 
turally significant buildings, but, because of their 
continuous streetwall, they form a more coher- 
ent streetscape. Without some sort of projection 
for the less significant buildings, the quality of 
the district would be lost due to pressure from 
the expanding office core. 

(c) Architectural Character. Although the 
scale and size of the structures on New Mont- 
gomery Street are somewhat monumental, the 
area remains attractive for pedestrians. The 
street has a number of outstanding buildings 
concentrated on New Montgomery, such as the 
Palace Hotel, the Pacific Telephone tower, and 
the Sharon Building. The styles range from the 
Gothic skyscraper massing and Art Deco detail- 
ing of the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Build- 
ing to the Renaissance Palazzo style of the Pal- 
ace Hotel. The primary building materials are 
earthtone bricks, stone or terra cotta, with, orna- 
mental details executed in a variety of materials 
including terra cotta, metal, stucco and stone.

App. F, Sec. 6. 



Second Street has a smaller, more intimate 
scale. While on New Montgomery Street, build- 
ings typically occupy an entire subblock, on Sec- 
ond Street, three or four small buildings will 
occupy the same area. The buildings are gener- 
ally mixed-use office and retail structures, three 
to five stories in height, with Renaissance- 
influenced ornament. 

The two streets are unified by several ele- 
ments, including an architectural vocabulary 
which draws from similar historical sources, 
similar materials, scale, fenestration, color, sty- 
listic origins, texture, and ornament. 

(d) Uniqueness and Location. The Dis- 
trict is located close to the central core of the 
financial district and is adjacent to an area 
projected for the future expansion. It is one of the 
few architecturally significant areas remaining 
largely intact in the South of Market area. 

(ej Visual and Functional Unity. The Dis- 
trict has a varied character ranging from the 
small and intimate on the alley streets to a more 
monumental scale on New Montgomery. In spite 
of this wide range, the district forms a coherent 
entity due to the buildings&apos; common architec- 
tural vocabulary and the rhythm of building 
masses created by the District&apos;s intersecting 
alleys. 

(f) Dynamic Continuity. The District is 
an active part of the downtown area, and after 
some years of neglect is undergoing reinvest- 
ment, which is visible in the rehabilitation of the 
Pacific Telephone Building, and the repair and 
rehabilitation of other buildings in the District. 

(g) Benefits to the City and Its Resi- 
dents. The District is a microcosm of twentieth 
century commercial architecture, ranging from 
low-level speculative office blocks to the City&apos;s 
premier hotels and executive offices of the time. 
The District now houses a variety of uses from 
inexpensive restaurants and support commercial 
uses, such as printers, to executive offices. The 
area retains a comfortable human scale, which 
will become increasingly important as neighbor- 
ing areas of the South of Market become more 
densely developed. (Added Ord. 414-85, App. 
9/17/85) 



SEC. 6. FEATURES. 

The exterior architectural features of the 
New Montgomery-Second Street District are as 
follows: 

(a) Massing and Composition. Almost 
without exception, the buildings in the New 
Montgomery-Second Conservation District are 
built to the front property line and occupy the 
entire site. Building massings along New Mont- 
gomery and Second Streets have different direc- 
tional orientations. For the most part, the large 
buildings on New T Montgomery Street are. hori- 
zontally oriented, since they are built on rela- 
tively large lots, often occupying an entire block- 
face. Their horizontal width often exceeds their 
height. The buildings on Second Street are built 
on much smaller lots, and hence have a vertical 
orientation. An exception on New Montgomery is 
the tower of the Pacific Telephone Building, 
whose soaring veiiicality is unique for that street. 

To express the mass and weight of the struc- 
ture, masonry materials are used on multi- 
dimensional wall surfaces with texture and depth, 
which simulates the qualities necessary to sup- 
port the weight of a load-bearing wall. 

Despite their differing orientation, almost all 
buildings share a two or three-part composi- 
tional arrangement. In addition, buildings are 
often divided into bays which establish a steady 
rhythm along the streets of the District. The 
rhythm is the result of fenestration, structural 
articulation or other detailing which breaks the 
facade into discrete segments. A common compo- 
sitional device in the District is the emphasis 
placed upon either the end bays or the central 
bay. 

(b) Scale. The scale of the District varies 
from the small buildings on Second Street to 
medium-scaled structures on New Montgomery 
Street. On the latter street, the large facades are 
not commonly divided into smaller bays, estab- 
lishing a medium scale when combined with the 
five- to eight-story height of the buildings. Simi- 
larly, the use of elaborate ornament on many of 
the buildings breaks their large facades into 
smaller sections and accordingly reduces their 
scale. Second Street is characterized bv much

App. F, Sec. 6. 



San Francisco - Planning Code 



1556 



smaller buildings with more frequent use of 
vertical piers whose scale is very intimate for the 
South of Market area. 

(c) Materials and Color. Various forms of 
masonry are the predominant building materials 
in the district. A number of buildings on the 
northern end of New Montgomery use brown or 
buff brick. Terra cotta is also used as a facing 
material, and is frequently glazed to resemble 
granite or other stones. On Second Street, many 
buildings are faced in stucco. To express the 
mass and weight of the structure, masonry ma- 
terials are often rusticated at the ground and 
second stoiy to increase the textural variation 
and sense of depth. 

The materials are generally colored light or 
medium earth tones, including white, cream, 
buff, yellow, and brown. Individual buildings 
generally use a few different tones of one color. 

(d) Detailing and Ornamentations. Build- 
ings range from industrial brick and stucco office/ 
warehouses to ornately decorated office build- 
ings. The details on the latter buildings are 
generally of Classical/Renaissance derivation and 
include projecting cornices and belt courses, rus- 
tication, columns and colonnades, and arches. 
Industrial commercial buildings are noted by 
their utilitarian nature, with limited areas or 
ornament applied at the cornice entablature and 
around windows. (Added Ord. 414-85, App. 9/17/ 
85) 

SEC. 7. STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES 
FOR REVIEW OF NEW CONSTRUCTION 
AND CERTAIN ALTERATIONS. 

(a) Standards. All construction of new build- 
ings and all major alterations, which are subject 
to the provisions of Sections 1110, 1111 through 
1111.6 and 1113, shall be compatible with the 
District in general with respect to the building&apos;s 
composition and massing, scale, materials and 
colors, and detailing and ornamentation, includ- 
ing those features described in Section 6 of this 
Appendix. Emphasis shall be placed on compat- 
ibility with those buildings in the area in which 
the new or altered building is located. In the case 
of major alterations, only those building charac- 



teristics that are affected by the proposed alter- 
ation shall be considered in assessing compatibil- 
ity. Signs on buildings in conservation districts 
are subject to the provisions of Section 1111.7. 

The foregoing standards do not require, or 
even encourage, new buildings to imitate the 
styles of the past. Rather, they require the new to 
be compatible with the old. The determin.cit.ion of 
compatibility shall be made in accordance with 
the provisions of Section 309. 

(b) Guidelines. The guidelines in this sub- 
section shall be used in assessing compatibility. 

(1) Composition and Massing. New con- 
struction should maintain the character of sur- 
rounding buildings by relating to their prevail- 
ing height, mass, proportions, rhythm and 
composition. 

In addition to the consideration of sunlight 
access for the street, an appropriate streetwall 
height is established by reference to the prevail- 
ing height of the buildings on the block and 
especially that of adjacent buildings. The prevail- 
ing height of buildings on New Montgomery 
Street is between five and eight stories while 
buildings on Second Street commonly range from 
three to six stories. A setback at the streetwall 
height can permit additional height above the 
setback up to the height limit without breaking 
the continuity of the street wall. 

Almost ail existing buildings are built to the 
property or street line. This pattern, except in 
the case of carefully selected open spaces, should 
not be broken since it could damage the continu- 
ity of building rhythms and the definition of 
streets. 

Proportions for new buildings should be es- 
tablished by the prevailing streetwall height and 
the width of existing buildings. On New Mont- 
gomery Street, the historic pattern of large lot 
development permits new buildings to have a 
horizontal orientation. In order to ensure that an 
established set of proportions is maintained on 
Second Street, new construction should break up 
facades into discrete elements that relate to 
prevailing building masses. The use of smaller

1557 



Preservation of Buildings and Districts of Architectural, 

Historical, and Aesthetic Importance in the C-3 Districts 



App. F, Sec. 8. 



bays and multiple building entrances are ways 
in which to relate the proportions of a new 
building with those of existing buildings. 

The design of a new structure should repeat 
the prevailing pattern of two- and three-part 
vertical compositions. One-part buildings with- 
out bases do not adequately define the pedes- 
trian streetscape and do not relate well to the 
prevailing two- and three-part structures. 

(2) Scale. The existing scale can be accom- 
plished in a variety of ways, including: a consis- 
tent use of size and complexity of detailing with 
regard to surrounding buildings, continuance of 
existing bay widths, maintenance of the existing 
streetwall height, and the use of a base element 
(of similar height) to maintain the pedestrian 
environment. Large wall surfaces, which in- 
crease a building&apos;s scale, should be broken up 
through the use of vertical piers, detailing and 
textural variation to reduce the scale of Second 
Street. 

Existing fenestration (windows, entrances) 
and rhythms which have been established by lot 
width or bay width should be repeated in new 
structures. The spacing and size of window open- 
ings should follow the sequence set by historic 
structures. Large glass areas should be broken 
up by mullions so that the scale of glazed areas is 
compatible with that of neighboring buildings. 
Casement and double-hung windows should be 
used where possible since most existing build- 
ings use these window types. 

(3) Materials and Colors. The use of ma- 
sonry and stone materials or materials that 
appear similar (such as substituting concrete for 
stone) can link two disparate structures, or har- 
monize the appearance of a new structure with 
the architectural character of a Conservation 
District. The preferred surface materials for this 
District are brick, stone, terra cotta and concrete 
(simulated to look like terra cotta or stone). 

The texture of surfaces can be treated in a 
manner so as to emphasize the bearing function 
of the material, as is done with rustication on the 
Rialto Building. Traditional light colors should 
be used in order to blend in with the character of 
the district. Dissimilar buildings may be made 



more compatible by using similar or harmonious 
colors, and to a lesser extent, by using similar 
textures. 

(4) Detailing and Ornamentation. A new 

building should relate to the surrounding area 
by picking up elements from surrounding build- 
ings and repeating them or developing them for 
new purposes. The new structure should incor- 
porate prevailing cornice lines or belt courses. A 
variety of Renaissance/Baroque, Gothic and Mod- 
erne ornament in the District provides sources 
for detailing in new buildings in order to 
strengthen their relationship. Similarly shaped 
forms can be used as detailing without directly 
copying historical ornament. (Added Ord. 414- 
85, App. 9/17/85)

SEC. 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 

It is hereby found that the area known and 
described in this Appendix as the Commercial- 
Leidesdorff area is a Subarea within the C-3 
District that possesses concentrations of build- 
ings that together create a Subarea of architec- 
tural quality and importance which contributes 
to the beauty and attractiveness of the City. It is 
further found that the area meets the standards 
for designation of a Conservation District as set- 
forth in Section 1103 of Article 11 and that the 
designation of said area as a Conservation Dis- 
trict will be in furtherance of and in conformance 
with the purposes of Article 1.1 of the City Plan- 
ning Code, 

This designation is intended to promote the 
health, safety, prosperity and welfare of the 
people of the City through the effectuation of the 
purposes set forth in Section 1101 of Article 11 
and the maintenance of the scale and character 
of the Commercial -Leidesdorff area by: 

(a) The protection and preservation of the 
basic characteristics and salient architectural 
details of structures insofar as these character- 
istics and details are compatible with the Con- 
servation District; 

(b) Providing scope for the continuing vital- 
ity of the District through private renewal and 
architectural creativity, within appropriate con- 
trols and standards. It is intended to foster a 
climate in which the Commercial-Leidesdorffarea 



may continue to exist as an important part of the 
City&apos;s commercial base, providing a quiet con- 
trast to the bustle of the rest of the Financial 
District; and 

(c) Encouragement of the continued inten- 
sive use of the District by financial district 
workers during the noon hours. (Added Ord. 
414-85, App. 9/17/85) 

SEC. 2. DESIGNATION. 

Pursuant to Section 1103.1 of Article 1.1, of 
the City Planning Code (Part II, Chapter XI of 
the San Francisco Municipal Code), the Commer- 
cial-Leidesdorff area is hereby designated as a 
Conservation District. (Added Ord. 414-85, App. 
9/17/85) 

SEC. 3. LOCATION AND BOUNDARIES. 

The location and boundaries of the Commer- 
cial-Leidesdorff District shall be as designated 
on the Commercial-Leidesdorff Conservation Dis- 
trict Map, the original of which is on file with the 
Clerk of the Board of Supervisors under File No. 
223-84-4, which Map is hereby incorporated herein 
as though fully set forth, and a facsimile of which 
is reproduced hereinbeiow. (Added Ord. 414-85, 
App. 9/17/85) 



SEC. 4. 
CODE. 



RELATION TO CITY PLANNING 



(a) Article 11 of the City Planning Code is 
the basic law governing preservation of buildings 
and districts of architectural importance in the 
C-3 District of the City and County of San 
Francisco. This Appendix is subject to and in 
addition to the provisions thereof. 

(b) Except as may be specifically provided 
to the contrary in this Code, nothing in this 
Appendix shall supersede, impair or modify any 
City Planning Code provisions applicable to prop- 
erty in the Commercial-Leidesdorff Conserva- 
tion District, including, but not limited to, regu- 
lations controlling uses, height, bulk, coverage,

floor area ratio, required open space, off-street 
parking, and signs. (Added Ord. 414-85, App. 
9/17/85) 

SEC. 5. JUSTIFICATION. 

The characteristics of the Conservation Dis- 
trict justifying its designation are as follows: 

(a) History of the District. In the 1840 ! s, 
Montgomery Street (where Captain Jack Mont- 
gomery landed) was the wharfside street of the 
new City. During the Gold Rush a few years 
later, the new street running parallel with the 
extended shoreline was named after William 
Alexander Leidesdorff, the owner of a warehouse 
at the water&apos;s edge. Commercial Street, origi- 
nally one block between Kearny and Montgom- 
ery Streets, grew to the east as land was filled 
around the Long Wharf. 

The first relocation of financial offices in the 
downtown happened when banks moved their 
offices, which had been at Portsmouth Square, to 
the intersection of Montgomery and Commercial 
Streets. Since that time, Montgomery Street has 
been the financial center for San Francisco. 
While financial uses gradually moved south on 
Montgomery Street towards Market Street in 
the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, by 
the 1920&apos;s, the banking center was reestablished 
in the vicinity of Montgomery and California 
Streets. 

The completion of the Pacific Gas and Elec- 
tric Substation at the corner of Sacramento and 
Leidesdorff Street in 1923, largely completed the 
redevelopment of the Commercial-LeidesdorfF Dis- 
trict. Buildings along Montgomery Street such 
as the Bank of Italy Building and the former 
Bank of Canton Building retained the scale of 
the pre-fire city. A classical design was used for 
these banking temples in order to impress the 
public with the soundness and stability of the 
bank. The Bank of America (then known as the 
Bank of Italy) had its headquarters located in 
the District for many years. 

While Montgomery Street has historically 
been the preferred address for major banks and 
offices, Commercial and Leidesdorff Streets con- 
tained a wide variety of uses which found it 



convenient to be located near the office district. 
In the 19th century, Leidesdorff Street connected 
the A. Paladini Fish Market on Clay Street with 
the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce on 
Pine. In the 1920&apos;s, these streets boasted several 
printers and binderies, a cigar factory (554 Com- 
mercial), photoengravers, a chemical storage ware- 
house as well as a paints, oils and varnish 
business. 

(b) Basic Nature of the District. The 

special character of this block is created by the 
intersection of Commercial and Leidesdorff 
Streets, dividing the block into quadrants. The 
northeast quadrant of the block has been devel- 
oped by a highrise of insensitive scale and design 
and was therefore excluded from this District. 
The remaining three quadrants of the Conserva- 
tion District remain intact. The small size of the 
parcels determines narrow width of the build- 
ings. 

Focusing on the intersection of the two al- 
leys, the District is a quiet area contrasting with 
the intensity of the Financial District. Because of 
the small scale, presence of sunshine, and vari- 
ety of restaurants, this area is extremely popular 
at lunchtime. 

(c) Architectural Character. The charac- 
ter of the area is established by a number of 
buildings of outstanding merit serving as an- 
chors for the District. The contributory buildings 
are of relatively high quality and are unusually 
supportive of the District&apos;s character. A wide 
variety of styles exists in the small district, 
including Classical banking temples, three Pa- 
cific Gas and Electric substations with Ro- 
manesque and Classical ornament, and one of 
the more unique Gothic-ornamented structures 
in the downtown. This collection of styles creates 
rich visual interest within a concentrated pedes- 
trian environment. 

(d) Uniqueness and Location. The area 
is located on the northern edge of the Financial 
District and is separated from the Jackson Square 
Historic District by the Transamerica Pyramid. 
The District is readily accessible from China- 
town, North Beach and Telegraph Hill, as well as 
the downtown adjacent development. There are 




Supp. No. 3, November/December 2006 



1561 



Preservation of Buildings and Districts of Architectural, 

Historical, and Aesthetic Importance in the C-3 Districts 



App. G, Sec. 6. 



no inappropriate modern structures located within 
its boundaries. Alterations to the ground story 
have generally been sympathetic to both the 
character of the district and the buildings them- 
selves. 

(e) Visual and Functional Unity. The char- 
acter of the area is one of a common small scale 
and intimacy created, by its intersecting alleys, 
small lots, masonry structures and buildings 
with, classically derived ornament. Commercial 
Street links the area to surrounding older devel- 
opment, with views down Commercial Street to 
the Ferry Building tow r er in one direction, and to 
Chinatown in the other direction. The narrow- 
ness of the alley and small scale of its buildings 
makes the district attractive to pedestrians. 

(f) Dynamic Continuity. The District is a 
center for restaurants catering to a lunch and 
after-work clientele. In addition to its entertain- 
ment functions, banking, office, retail and indus- 
trial uses insure a healthy and productive mix of 
activities throughout the day. 

(g) Benefits to the City and its Resi- 
dents. The District provides a variety of older 
buildings incorporating space for commercial uses. 
The area serves as an architectural resource for 
its concentration of early 20th Century architec- 
ture. (Added Ord. 414-85, App. 9/17/85) 

SEC. 6. FEATURES. 

The exterior architectural features of the 
Commercial- Lei desdorff District are as follows: 

(a) Massing and Composition. For the 

most part, the buildings are two- or three-part 
vertical compositions consisting either of a base 
and a shaft, or a base, a shaft and a capital. The 
District has a number of low, one-part buildings. 
These are banking temples and the Pacific, Gas 
and Electric substations. Some of the smaller 
buildings use central entryways to create a sym- 
metrical composition. These designs relate well 
to their context, largely because the narrow 
streets do not demand a high building or one 
with multiple parts to maintain a street enclo- 
sure. 

In addition, buildings are often divided into 
bays expressing the structure. This was accom- 



plished through fenestration, structural articu- 
lation or other detailing which serves to break 
the facade into discrete segments. A common 
compositional device in the district is an empha- 
sis placed upon either the end bays or the central 
bay, creating a varied facade. 

Lots are narrow and shallow, typically 20 feet 
x 60 feet, encouraging a predominant building 
form of from one to four stories. Buildings up to 
eight stories on Montgomery Street reflect its 
function as a prime financial office address. 

Almost without exception, the buildings in 
the Commercial-Leidesdorff Conservation Dis- 
trict are built to the front property line and 
occupy the entire site. A number of buildings 
have &quot;L&quot;-shaped massing or through-block lots 
with frontages on two streets. This reflects the 
high land values of this District at the time of 
construction, and the function of the alleys for 
building service access. 

(b) Scale. The buildings are of small scale, 
created by elaborate detailing and low height. A 
major influence on scale is the degree to which 
the total facade plane is broken into smaller 
parts. Window and door openings are relatively 
small, creating large wall areas, which are fre- 
quently heavily ornamented. The bay width is 
generally from 15 feet to 20 feet. The narrow 
spacing between the vertical elements creates a 
regular rhythm. As noted above, the wider front- 
ages are often broken up by articulation of the 
facade, making the buildings appear narrower. 
Heights generally range from one to four stories 
on lots 20 feet to 30 feet wide, although a few 
taller and wider buildings exist. The base is 
generally delineated from the rest of the build- 
ing, giving the District an intimate scale at the 
street. The alleys are only 30 feet to 36 feet wide, 
creating an intimate scale. Sacramento Street, 
the narrowest major street in the downtown at 
49 feet, also enhances this small scale. 

(c) Materials and Colors. Buildings are 
either clad in masonry over a supporting struc- 
ture, or are constructed of masonry with load- 
bearing walls. The cladding materials include 
brick, terra cotta, stucco, and stone. The build- 
ings fronting on the alleys use materials with 



Supp, No. 3, November/December 2006 



App. G, Sec, 6. 



San Francisco - Planning Code 



1562 



rough surface treatments, reflecting the build- 
ings&apos; utilitarian nature. Wood, metal, and metal 
panels are not commonly used facade materials 
in the District, although painted wood and metal 
are sometimes used for window sash and orna- 
ment. 

The materials are generally colored of light 
or medium earth tones, including cream, buff, 
yellow, grey, and brown. Individual buildings 
generally use a few different tones of one color, 
highlighting the ornament. Dark or intense col- 
ors are not commonly used. 

(d) Detailing and Ornamentation. The 

buildings are not constructed in a single style, 
but with ornament drawn from a variety of 
historical sources, primarily classical sources. 
Arcades and arched entryways are common ele- 
ments in the buildings. Popular details include 
arches, columns, pilasters, projecting bracketed 
cornices, multiple belt-courses, elaborate lintels, 
and pediments. Details were used to relate build- 
ings to their neighbors by repeating and varying 
the ornament used in the surrounding struc- 
tures. (Added Ord. 414-85, App. 9/17/85) 

SEC. 7. STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES 
FOR REVIEW OF NEW CONSTRUCTION 
AND CERTAIN ALTERATIONS. 

(a) Standards. All construction of new build- 
ings and all major alterations, which are subject 
to the provisions of Sections 1110, 1111 through 
1111.6 and 1113, shall be compatible with the 
District in general with respect to the building&apos;s 
composition and massing, scale, materials and 
colors, and detailing and ornamentation, includ- 
ing those features described in Section 6 of this 
Appendix. Emphasis shall be placed on compat- 
ibility with those buildings in the area in which 
the new or altered building is located. In the case 
of major alterations, only those building charac- 
teristics that are affected by the proposed alter- 
ation shall be considered in assessing compatibil- 
ity. Signs on the buildings in Conservation 
Districts are subject to the provisions of Section 
1111.7. 

The foregoing standards do not require, or 
even encourage, new buildings to imitate the 



styles of the past. Rather, they require the new to 
be compatible with the old. The determination of 
compatibility shall be made in accordance with 
the provisions of Section 309. 

(b) Guidelines. The guidelines in this sub- 
section are to be used in assessing compatibility. 

(1) Composition and Massing, New con- 
struction should maintain the character of the 
District by relating to the prevailing height, 
mass, proportions, rhythm and composition of 
existing historic buildings. 

The height and massing of new buildings 
should not alter the traditional scale of existing 
buildings, streets and open spaces. On the inte- 
rior of the block, the existing streetwall height 
should be maintained. An appropriate streetwall 
height is established by reference to the prevail- 
ing building height on the block and especially 
that of adjacent buildings. If the adjacent build- 
ings are of a significantly different height than 
the rest of the buildings on the block, then the 
prevailing height of buildings on the block should 
be used as a guide. A setback at the streetwall 
height can permit additional height above the 
setback without breaking the continuity of the 
street wall. On blockfronts where the street wall 
is less well-defined, greater latitude in height 
may be allowed. 

Most existing buildings are built to the prop- 
erty or street line. This pattern should not be 
broken since it could damage the continuity of 
building rhythms and the definition of streets. 

The standard proportions of new buildings 
should be established by the prevailing street- 
wall height and width of lots. Lot assembly 
should be discouraged to maintain the existing 
lot pattern and building proportions. In cases 
where lot assembly does occur, it is necessary to 
break up the facades of new buildings into dis- 
crete elements that relate to prevailing building 
proportions. The use of smaller bays is a way in 
which to relate the proportions of a new building 
with those of historic buildings. 

The design of a new structure should repeat 
the prevailing pattern of two- and three-part 
vertical compositions, although low buildings 
could use a one-part vertical division. A base

element is necessary to define the pedestrian 
environment. Alterations to existing structures 
should maintain the existing vertical and hori- 
zontal divisions, and should respect the original 
ground story enframement. Cornices and belt 
courses should not be removed or altered. 

(2) Scale. The existing scale of the immedi- 
ate area and the Conservation District should be 
maintained. This can be accomplished in a vari- 
ety of ways, including: a consistent use of size 
and complexity of detailing in regards to sur- 
rounding buildings, continuance of existing bay 
widths, maintenance of an existing street-wall 
height, and incorporation of a base element (of 
similar height to existing bases) to maintain the 
pedestrian environment. Large wall surfaces, 
which increase a building&apos;s scale, should be bro- 
ken up through the use of detailing and textural 
variation to reduce the scale. 

Existing fenestration (windows, entrances) 
rhythms and proportions which have been estab- 
lished by lot width or bay width should be 
repeated in new structures. The spacing and size 
of window openings should follow the sequence 
set by historic structures. Large glass areas 
should be broken up by mullions so that the scale 
of glazed areas is compatible with that of neigh- 
boring buildings. Casement and double-hung win- 
dows should be used where possible. 

(3) Materials and Colors. The use of like 
materials can relate two buildings of obviously 
different eras and styles. Similarly, the use of 
materials that appear similar (such as substitut- 
ing concrete for terra cotta) can link two dispar- 
ate structures, or harmonize the appearance of a 
new structure with the architectural character of 
a conservation district. The preferred surface 
materials for this district are brick, terra cotta, 
stone, and concrete (simulated to look like terra 
cotta or stone). The texture of surfaces can be 
treated in a manner so as to emphasize the 
bearing function of the material, as is done in 
rustication on historic buildings. In addition, in 
some cases it may be appropriate to leave the 
surface roughly dressed, emphasizing the utili- 
tarian character of the interior frontages. 



Traditional light colors should be used in 
order to blend in with the character of the 
district. Dissimilar buildings may be made more 
compatible by using similar or harmonious col- 
ors, and, to a lesser extent, by using similar 
textures. 

(4) Detailing and Ornamentation. A new 

building should relate to the surrounding area 
by picking up elements from surrounding build- 
ings and repeating them or developing them for 
new purposes. An ornamental detail can be taken 
from an adjacent building and used in a new 
building to relate the latter to the surrounding 
area. Alternately, similarly shaped forms can be 
used without directly copying historical orna- 
ment. The new structure should incorporate pre- 
vailing cornice lines or belt courses and may use 
a modern vernacular instead of that of the origi- 
nal model. (Added Ord. 414-85, App. 9/17/85)

SEC. 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 

It is hereby found that the area known and 
described in this Appendix as the Front-Califor- 
nia Street area is a Subarea within the C-3 
District that possesses concentrations of build- 
ings that together create a Subarea of architec- 
tural quality and importance which contributes 
to the beauty and attractiveness of the City. It is 
further found that the area meets the standards 
for designation of a Conservation District as set 
forth in Section 1103 of Article 11 and that the 
designation of said area as a Conservation Dis- 
trict will be in furtherance of and in conformance 
with the purposes of Article 11 of the City Plan- 
ning Code. 

This Designation is intended to promote the 
health, safety, prosperity and welfare of the 
people of the City through the effectuation of the 
purposes set forth in Section 1101 of Article 11 
and the maintenance of the scale and character 
of the Front-California area by: 

(a) The protection and preservation of the 
basic characteristics and salient architectural 
details of structures insofar as these character- 
istics and details are compatible with the Con- 
servation District; 

(b) Providing scope for continuing vitality of 
the District through private renewal and archi- 
tectural creativity, within appropriate controls 
and standards. It is intended to foster a climate 



in which the area continues to provide a variety 
of retail and commercial uses of significant value 
to the City. 

(c) Encouragement of the continued inten- 
sive use of the District by financial district 
workers during the noon hours. (Added Orel. 
414-85, App. 9/17/85)

CODE. 



RELATION TO CITY PLANNING 



(a) Article 11 of the City Planning Code is 
the basic law governing preservation of buildings 
and districts of architectural and environmental 
importance in the C-3 District of the City and 
County of San Francisco. This Appendix is sub- 
ject to and in addition to the provisions thereof. 

(b) Except as may be specifically provided 
to the contrary in this Code, nothing hi this 
Appendix shall supersede, impair or modify any 
City Planning Code provisions applicable to prop- 
erty in the Front-California Conservation Dis- 
trict including, but not limited to, regulations 
controlling uses, height, bulk, coverage, floor 
area ratio, required open space, off-street park- 
ing and signs. (Added Ord. 414-85, App. 9/17/85) 



Supp. No. 3, November/December 2006 



App. H, Sec. 5. 



San Francisco - Planning Code 



1566 



SEC. 5. JUSTIFICATION. 

The characteristics of the Conservation Dis- 
trict justifying its designation are as follows: 

(a) History of the District. Located to the 
east of the financial district on filled land, this 
District was outside of the major downtown 
growth corridors in the nineteenth and early 
twentieth centuries. The location of the Federal 
Reserve Bank on Battery Street and the construc- 
tion of several office buildings (Southern Pacific, 
Matson) in the 1920&apos;s, linked the financial dis- 
trict with port-oriented buildings on lower Cali- 
fornia and Market Streets. While office uses 
have been located on California Street since 
1906, the area east of Battery Street was not 
fully integrated into the financial district until 
1920, when the street assumed, its present char- 
acter. 

The development of Front Street proceeded 
at a slower pace and was not complete until the 
1930&apos;s. Front Street was redeveloped after the 
fire, with warehouses and industrial buildings 
serving the produce district to the north and 
office support services serving the office core to 
the west and on California Street. Buildings on 
Front Street commonly contained stores and 
offices at the ground level while upper stories 
were used for stock purposes and general stor- 
age. Several offices and printers were also lo- 
cated on the street. 

(b) Basic Nature of the District. The low 

height and small scale of this District create a 
contrast to the rest of the financial district and 
the adjacent Embarcadero Center. The District 
still retains its post-fire appearance, as most of 
the architecturally significant buildings were 
constructed in the short period from 1907 through 
1918. Six of the District&apos;s 1.9 buildings are archi- 
tecturally significant and six are contributory to 
the District. Only seven buildings are unrated. 

The low buildings on Front Street and the 
narrow lot widths create an open, sunlit 
streetscape. Because of the character of the Dis- 
trict and its proximity to the financial district, a 
variety of commercial (especially retail) enter- 
prises serve pedestrians from the surrounding 
financial district. The scale of the California 



Street buildings is kept low by Halleck Street, 
which runs parallel to California and limits the 
lot size on that street. The street also divides 
Front in half on the west side, enhancing the 
small scale of that block. 

(c.) Architectural Character. Although the 
Front Street buildings are lower and of lesser 
quality than the California Street buildings, 
similar design elements in the buildings tie them 
together to form a coherent entity. The buildings 
on Front Street are generally in the two- to 
four-story range, while most of the buildings on 
California Street are in the four- to seven-story 
range. The buildings&apos; ornament is generally de- 
rived from Renaissance sources and the build- 
ings employ similar scale, height, fenestration, 
texture, and materials. 

(d) Uniqueness and Location. This dis- 
trict, along with the nearby Commercial-Leides- 
dorff District, forms one of the last small-scale 
areas with architecturally significant buildings 
in the northern section of the financial district. It 
provides a low-intensity contrast to the dense 
office core and the Embarcadero Center develop- 
ment. 

(e) Visual and Functional Unity. The Dis- 
trict forms a coherent entity. Outside the bound- 
ary, the older buildings become larger and are 
interspersed with more modern structures. The 
similar character and scale of the buildings unify 
the District. 

(f) Dynamic Continuity. The area has dem- 
onstrated economic viability evidenced, by its mix 
of active retail and commercial uses. 

(g) Benefits to the City and Its Resi- 
dents. The District provides a variety of retail 
and commercial uses in small older structures. 
The area is an architectural resource for its 
collection of small industrial buildings. The Dis- 
trict still retains the scale and character, if not 
the actual Victorian buildings, of the pre-fire 
commercial district. (Added Ord. 414-85, App. 
9/17/85) 

SEC. 6. FEATURES. 

The exterior architectural features of the 
Front-California District are as follows: 

(a) Scale, Form, and Proportion. The 

buildings in this District are of a variety of 
heights, ranging from one story to 11 stories. 




Supp. No. 3, November/December 2006 



1567 



Preservation of Buildings and Districts of Architectural, 

Historical, and Aesthetic Importance in the C-3 Districts 



App. H, Sec. 7 



Unlike other districts which have a prevailing 
streetwall height, this District has a varied street- 
wall height, allowing sunlight to penetrate to the 
street most of the day. Lot widths range from 25 
feet to 60 feet, lot depths range from 60 feet to 
140 feet. 

(b) Materials, Color, Texture. Facade ma- 
terials include exposed brick, stucco, metal, and 
terra cotta panels. Colors include white, grey 
masonry and terra cotta, red brick, and deep 
reds and greens. The texture of the buildings 
varies from smooth stucco to richly textured and 
ornamented terra cotta panels. 

(c) Details. Building styles range from utili- 
tarian brick industrial with decorative brick- 
work to ornate Renaissance Revival buildings. 
Details include glazed brickwork, arches, deco- 
rated spandrels, projecting cornices and belt 
courses, pilasters, and rustication. (Added Ord. 
414-85, App. 9/17/85.) 

SEC. 7. STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES 
FOR REVIEW OF NEW CONSTRUCTION 
AND CERTAIN ALTERATIONS. 

(a ) Standards. All construction of new 7 build- 
ings and all major alterations, which are subject 
to the provisions of Sections 1110, 1111 through 
1111.6 and 111.3, shall be compatible with the 
District in general with respect to the building&apos;s 
composition and massing, scale, materials and 
colors, and detailing and ornamentation, includ- 
ing those features described in Section 6 of this 
Appendix. Emphasis shall be placed on compat- 
ibility with those buildings in the area in which 
the new or altered building is located. In the case 
of major alterations, only those building charac- 
teristics that are affected by the proposed alter- 
ation shall be considered in assessing compatibil- 
ity. Signs on buildings in Conservation Districts 
are subject to the provisions of Section 1111.7. 

The foregoing standards do not require, or 
even encourage, new buildings to imitate the 
styles of the past. Rather, they require the new to 
be compatible with the old. The determination of 
compatibility shall be made in accordance with 
the provisions of Section 309. 



(b) Guidelines. The guidelines in this sub- 
section are to be used in assessing compatibility. 

(1) Composition and Massing. New con- 
struction should maintain the character of both 
Front and California Streets by relating to the 
prevailing height, mass, proportions, rhythm and 
composition of historic buildings. 

The height and massing of new buildings 
should not alter the traditional scale of existing 
buildings, streets and open spaces. Since build- 
ings on California Street commonly range from 
five to eight stories, new- buildings should relate 
to those heights. Similarly, new buildings on 
Front Street should relate to the existing pattern 
of buildings under five stories in height. A set- 
back at the predominant streetwall height can 
permit additional height above the setback with- 
out breaking the continuity of the streetwall. 

Almost all existing buildings are built to the 
property or street line. This pattern, except in 
the case of carefully selected open spaces, should 
not be broken since it could damage the continu- 
ity of building rhythms and the definitions of 
streets. 

Vertical and horizontal proportions for new 
buildings should be established by heights of 
existing streetwall and the width of existing 
buildings (and lots). Due to the regular rhythm 
of small structures on Front Street, a new build- 
ing which is built on a large site should break up 
its facade into discrete sections that relate to the 
small building masses. This can be best accom- 
plished through the use of vertical piers and 
separate entrances for the different sections. 
However, the slightly larger lots on California 
Street would allow buildings to have greater 
horizontal dimensions as well as greater heights. 
The use of smaller bays is another way in which 
to relate the proportions of a new building with 
those of historic buildings. 

The design of a new structure should also 
repeat the prevailing pattern of two- and three- 
part vertical compositions. One-part buildings 
without base sections do not adequately define 
the pedestrian streetscape and do not relate well 
to the historic two- and three-part structures. 



Supp. No. 3, November/December 2006 



App. H, Sec. 7. 



San Francisco - Planning Code 



1568 



This division of a building allows flexibility in 
the design of the ground story while encouraging 
a uniform treatment of the upper stories. 

(2) Scale. The existing scale of the Front- 
California Conservation District is one of its 
most important assets and should be main- 
tained. This can be accomplished by the consis- 
tent use of size and complexity of detailing in 
relation to surrounding buildings. In addition, 
the continuance of existing bay widths and the 
incorporation of a base element (of similar height) 
help to maintain the pedestrian environment. 
Especially on Front Street, large wall surfaces, 
which increase a building&apos;s scale, should be bro- 
ken up through the use of detailing and textural 
variation to reduce the scale. 

Existing fenestration (windows, entrances) 
rhythms and proportions which have been estab- 
lished by lot width or bay width should be 
repeated in new structures. The spacing and size 
of window openings should follow 7 the sequence 
set by historic structures. Most glass areas should 
be broken up by mullions so that the scale of 
glazed areas is compatible with that the neigh- 
boring buildings. Casement and double-hung win- 
dows should be used where possible. 

(3) Materials and Colors. The use of his- 
toric materials or those that appear similar (such 
as substituting concrete for stone) can link tw r o 
disparate structures, or harmonize the appear- 
ance of a new structure with the architectural 
character of a Conservation District. The pre- 
ferred surface materials for this district are 
brick, stone and concrete (simulated to look like 
terra cotta or stone). 

Traditional light colors should be used in 
order to blend in with the character of the 
District. Dissimilar buildings may be made more 
compatible by using similar or harmonious col- 
ors, and to a lesser extent, by using similar 
textures. 

(4) Detailing and Ornamentation. A new 

building should relate to the surrounding area 
by picking up elements from surrounding build- 
ings and repeating them or developing them for 
new purposes. Since most buildings on Front 
Street are not extensively detailed, new struc- 



tures should incorporate prevailing cornice lines 
or belt courses. On California Street, the historic 
details of existing buildings can serve as models 
for detailing in new buildings in order to 
strengthen their relationship. Alternately, simi- 
larly shaped ornament can be used as detailing 
without directly copying historical ornament.

SEC. 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 

It is hereby found that the area known and 
described in this Appendix as the Kearny-Belden 
Street area is a Subarea within the C-3 District 
that possesses concentrations of buildings that 
together create a Subarea of architectural qual- 
ity and importance which contributes to the 
beauty and attractiveness of the City. It is fur- 
ther found that the area meets the standards for 
designation of a Conservation District as set 
forth in Section 1103 of Section 11 and that the 
designation of said area as a Conservation Dis- 
trict will be in furtherance of and in conformance 
with the purposes of Article 11 of the City Plan- 
ning Code. 

This Designation is intended to promote the 
health, safety, prosperity and welfare of the 
people of the City through the effectuation of the 
purposes set forth in Section 1101 of Article 11. 
In addition, this designation is intended to pre- 
serve the scale and character of the Kearny- 
Belden area by: 

(a) The protection and preservation of the 
basic characteristics and salient architectural 
details of structures insofar as these character- 
istics and details are compatible with the Con- 
servation District; 

(b) Providing scope for the continuing vital- 
ity of the District through private renewal and 
architectural creativity, within appropriate con- 
trols and standards; 



(c) Encouragement of the continued inten- 
sive use of the District by financial district 
workers during the noon hours. (Added Ord. 
414-85, App. 9/17/85) 

SEC. 2. DESIGNATION. 

Pursuant to Section 1103.1 of Article 11 of the 
City Planning Code (Part II, Chapter XI of the 
San Francisco Municipal Code), the Kearny- 
Belden area is hereby designated as a Conserva- 
tion District. (Added Ord. 414-85, App. 9/17/85) 

SEC. 3. LOCATION AND BOUNDARIES. 

The location and boundaries of the Kearny- 
Belden Conservation District shall be as desig- 
nated on the Kearny-Belden Conservation Dis- 
trict Map, the original of which is on file with the 
Clerk of the Board of Supervisors under File No. 
223-84-4, which Map is hereby incorporated herein 
as though fully set forth, and a facsimile of which 
is reproduced herein below. (Added Ord. 414-85, 
App. 9/17/85) 

SEC. 4. RELATION TO CITY PLANNING 
CODE. 

(a) Article 11 of the City Planning Code is 
the basic law governing preservation of buildings 
and districts of architectural importance in the 
C-3 District of the City and County of San 
Francisco. This Appendix is subject to and in 
addition to the provisions thereof. 

(b) Except as may be specifically provided 
to the contrary in this Code, nothing in this 
Appendix shall supersede, impair or modify any 
City Planning provisions applicable to property 
in the Kearny-Belden Conservation District, in- 
cluding, but not limited to, regulations control- 
ling uses, height, bulk, coverage, floor area ratio, 
required open space, off-street parking, and signs. 
(Added Ord. 414-85, App. 9/17/85) 

SEC. 5. JUSTIFICATION. 

The characteristics of the Conservation Dis- 
trict justifying its designation are as follows: 

(a) History of the District. In the nine- 
teenth century, private alleys were cut to permit 
access to the interiors of blocks, allowing more 



Supp. No. 3, November/December 2006 



App. I, Sec. 5. 



San Francisco - Planning Code 



1572 



intensive development than would otherwise have 
been possible. In this immediate area, the blocks 
were typically cut by one or more alleys. Some of 
these, like Belden Street and St. George Alley, 
still exist. Others, such as Lick Alley and Sum- 
mer Alley, have been incorporated into new de- 
velopments. Thus, the character of this District 
was established when Belden Street was cut 
through between Pine and Bush Streets. Belden 
Street is one of the best remaining examples of 
the development pattern of the pre-flre era. 

Buildings along Kearny, Bush and Pine Streets 
were completed several years before the small 
structures on the interior portion of Belden Alley. 
Since the District was only a few blocks south of 
Portsmouth Square, Kearny Street had a large 
number of businesses serving both nearby resi- 
dents as well as mercantile and port activities. 
As the City grew in the 1870&apos;s, Kearny Street 
became the most fashionable retail street in the 
City. Yet, by the turn of the century 7 , the move- 
ment of retail stores to Market Street and the 
Union Square/Grant Avenue area eclipsed Kearny 
Street&apos;s prominence. After the lire of 1906, Kearny 
Street found itself located between the financial 
and retail districts. By 1931, Kearny Street was 
a low-rent area of small stores and hotels. Some 
support uses for nearby Montgomery Street found 
Kearny a convenient location and printers, sign 
painters and some offices located on the street. 
While Belden Street was originally a service 
alley, restaurants located on the small street 
during the 1920&apos;s and 1930&apos;s. 

(b) Basic Nature of the District. The 

District consists of the east side of the 300 block 
of Kearny Street and the buildings which front 
on Belden Street, which runs parallel to Kearny. 
The depth of the lots is from 40 to 60 feet, which 
has served as an. effective limit on the height and 
scale of the buildings. The District has become 
the location for a number of small, moderately 
priced restaurants and the Belden Street right- 
of-way is closed down during the lunch hours to 
create a pedestrian mall which is heavily used. 
During this time, restaurants move tables out 
into the street for open-air dining. In addition, 
street trees have been planted and benches in- 
stalled. 



(c) Architectural Character. The District 
has only a few individual buildings of outstand- 
ing quality. Its unique quality is based on its 
character, rather than its examples of outstand- 
ing architecture. The District is also important 
as an example of historic building and d evelop- 
ment patterns. The District is expressive: of the 
different requirements of the street frontages. 
The character of the District is maintained by 
the small-scale, red brick structures on Belden 
Street, often utilitarian in character, with mini- 
mal ornament. The facades fronting on Kearny 
Street are more elaborate, with ornament de- 
rived from Renaissance sources. 

(d) Uniqueness and Location. The Dis- 
trict is almost entirely intact, except for one 
unsympathetically remodeled building. Alter- 
ations to the lower stories have generally been 
compatible with the District, and in recent years 
commercial alterations have been effected more 
compatible with the character of the District. 
The area is located on the edges of the Financial 
and Retail Districts, and at the foot of Nob Hill 
eastern slope. 

(e) Visual and Functional Unity. The char- 
acter of the area is determined by the use of a 
consistent scale, fenestration, materials, colors, 
and style. 

(f) Dynamic Continuity. The District sup- 
plies a variety of services to the working popula- 
tion of the downtown area. The shops and res- 
taurants are active and thriving. 

(g) Benefits to the City and Its Resi- 
dents. The district provides a variety of retail 
and commercial uses, including moderately priced 
restaurants and an attractive setting in which to 
enjoy lunch. The restaurants generally locate in 
small, older structures. The area serves as a 
respite from the dense financial district to the 
east. (Added Ord. 41.4-85, App. 9/17/85) 

SEC. 6. FEATURES. 

The exterior architectural features of the 
Kearny-Belden District are as follows: 

(a) Massing and Composition. The Kearny 
Street facades are elaborate designs, while the 
Belden Street facades are utilitarian in charac-

Preservation of Buildings and Districts of Architectural, 

Historical, and Aesthetic Importance in the C-3 Districts 



App. 1, Sec. 7. 



ter. The treatment of the facades reflects the 
differing character of the streets. Kearny Street 
is a major pedestrian and vehicular corridor, and 
a prime shopping street. For the most part, the 
Kearny Street facades are two- or three -part 
vertical compositions consisting either of a base 
and a shaft, or a base, a shaft and a capital. 
Belden Street is a narrow alley, originally cre- 
ated to allow access to the interior of the block. 
The facades on Belden Street are largely unor- 
namented, perhaps with a corbelled cornice or a 
decorative tile roof. The compositions are simple 
one-part structures from one to four stories high. 
There are a few small stucco buildings, probably 
built as warehouses. These designs are success- 
ful in maintaining the street enclosure, largely 
because the narrow widths of the streets do not 
demand a high building or one with multiple 
parts. 

In addition, the Kearny Street facades are 
often divided into bays expressing the structure. 
This was accomplished through fenestration, 
structural articulation or other detailing which 
serves to break the facade into discrete seg- 
ments. 

Both the scale and height of the buildings in 
the District are extremely small, a result of the 
lot and street patterns. The lot depth is generally 
under 60 feet, and half the lots have frontages on 
Kearny and Belden Streets. As a consequence of 
the limited size of lots, most of the buildings are 
limited to four stories or less. A number of the 
buildings are only one story high. 

Without exception, the buildings in the 
Kearny-Beiden Conservation District are built to 
the front property line and occupy the entire site. 

(b) Scale. The buildings are of small scale, 
created by the buildings&apos; elaborate detailing and 
low height. A major influence on scale is the 
degree to which the total facade plane is broken 
into smaller parts which relate to human scale. 
Window and door openings are relatively small, 
creating large wall areas, which are frequently 
heavily ornamented. The bay width is generally 
from 15 feet to 20 feet. Heights generally range 
from one to four stories on lots 20 feet to 30 feet 
wide, although a few taller and wider buildings 



exist. As noted above, the wider frontages are 
often broken up by articulation of the facade, 
making the buildings appear narrower. On the 
Kearny Street facades, the base is generally 
delineated from the rest of the building, giving 
the district an intimate scale at the street. 

(c) Materials and Colors. Buildings are 
either clad in masonry over a supporting struc- 
ture, or are constructed of masonry with load- 
bearing walls. The cladding materials include 
brick, terra cotta, and stucco. Materials have 
rough surface treatments, especially those lo- 
cated on the alleys, reflecting the building&apos;s 
utilitarian nature. Wood, metal, and metal pan- 
els are not commonly used facade materials in 
the District, although painted wood and metal 
are sometimes used for window sash and orna- 
ment. 

The materials are generally colored of light 
or medium earth tones, including cream, buff, 
yellow and red. Individual buildings generally 
use a few different tones of one color, highlight- 
ing the ornament. Dark or intense colors are not 
commonly used. 

The Belden Street facades are simply treated 
wall surfaces, with little expression of weight or 
mass from wall articulation. The small unit of 
the brick creates a textured facade, and reduces 
the scale of the undifferentiated facades. 

(d) Detailing and Ornamentation. The 
Kearny Street frontages are not constructed in a 
single style, but with ornament drawn from a 
variety of historical, primarily Classical, sources. 
Popular details include arches, columns, pilas- 
ters, projecting bracketed cornices, multiple belt- 
courses, elaborate lintels, and pediments. De- 
tails were used to relate buildings to their 
neighbors by repeating and varying the orna- 
ment used in the surrounding structures. 

The Belden Street frontages are unadorned, 
except for slight corbelled cornices at the upper 
levels or false tile roofs on the stucco buildings. 
(Added Ord. 414-85, App. 9/17/85) 

SEC. 7. STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES 
FOR REVIEW OF NEW CONSTRUCTION 
AND CERTAIN ALTERATIONS. 

(a) Standards. All construction of new build- 
ings and all major alterations, which are subject 
to the provisions of Sections 1110, 1111 through 



Supp. No. 3, November/December 2006 



App. I, Sec. 7. 



San Francisco - Planning Code 



1574 



1111.6 and 1113, shall be compatible with the 
District in general with respect to the building&apos;s 
composition and massing, scale, materials and 
colors, and detailing and ornamentation, includ- 
ing those features described in Section 6 of this 
Appendix. Emphasis shall be placed on compat- 
ibility with those buildings in the area in which 
the new or altered building is located. In the case 
of major alterations, only those building charac- 
teristics that are affected by the proposed alter- 
ation shall be considered in assessing compatibil- 
ity. Signs on buildings in Conservation Districts 
are subject to the provisions of Section 1111.7. 

The foregoing standards do not require, or 
even encourage, new buildings to imitate the 
styles of the past. Rather, they require the new to 
be compatible with the old. The determination of 
compatibility shall be made in accordance with 
the provisions of Section 309. 

(b) Guidelines. The guidelines in this sub- 
section are to be used in assessing compatibility. 

(1) Composition and Massing. New con- 
struction should maintain the character of the 
District by relating to the prevailing height, 
mass, proportions, rhythm and composition of 
existing historic buildings. 

The height and massing of new buildings 
should not alter the traditional scale of existing 
buildings, streets and open spaces. On the Kearny 
Street, the existing streetwall height should be 
maintained. An appropriate streetwall height is 
established by reference to the prevailing height 
of the buildings on the block and especially that 
of adjacent buildings. If the adjacent buildings 
are of a significantly different height than the 
rest of the buildings on the block, then the 
prevailing height of buildings on the block should 
be used as a guide. A setback at the streetwall 
height can permit additional height above the 
setback without breaking the continuity of the 
street wall. On Belden Street, where the street 
wail is less well defined, greater latitude in 
height may be allowed. The height limit of 50 
feet should be used as a guide to the appropriate 
height. 

Existing buildings are built to the property or 
street line. This pattern should not be broken 
since it could damage the continuity of building 
rhythms and the definition of streets. 



The standard proportions for new buildings 
should be established by the prevailing street- 
wall height and width of lots. Maintenance of the 
existing lot pattern and building proportions 
should be encouraged. In cases where lot assem- 
bly does occur, the facades of new buildings 
should be broken into discrete elements that 
relate to prevailing building proportions. The 
use of smaller bays can be used to relate the 
proportions of a new building with those of 
historic buildings. 

The design of the new structure should re- 
flect the characteristics of the blockfront. Kearny 
Street facades should repeat the prevailing pat- 
tern of two- and three-part vertical compositions, 
although low buildings could use a one-part 
vertical division. A base element is necessary to 
define the pedestrian environment. Belden Street 
facades should be simply treated, with a cornice 
or other definition at the roof level. 

(2) Scale. The existing scale of the immedi- 
ate area and the Conservation District should be 
maintained. This can be accomplished in a vari- 
ety of ways, including a consistent use of size and 
complexity of detailing with regard to surround- 
ing buildings, continuance of existing bay widths, 
maintenance of an existing streetwall height, 
and incorporation of a base element (of similar 
height) to maintain the pedestrian environment. 
Large wall surfaces, which increase a building&apos;s 
scale, should be broken up through the use of 
detailing and textural variation to reduce the 
scale. 

Existing fenestration (windows, entrances) 
rhythms and proportions which have been estab- 
lished by lot width or bay width should be 
repeated in new structures. The spacing and size 
of window openings should follow the sequence 
set by historic structures. Large glass areas 
should be broken up by mullions so that the scale 
of glazed areas is compatible with that of neigh- 
boring buildings. Casement and double -hung win- 
dows should be used where possible. 

(3) Materials and Colors. The use of like 
materials can relate two buildings of obviously 
different eras and styles. Similarly, the use of 
materials that appear similar (such as substitut- 




Supp. No. 3, November/December 2006 



1575 Preservation of Buildings and Districts of Architectural, App. 1, Sec. 7. 

Historical, and Aesthetic Importance in the C-3 Districts 

ing concrete for terra cotta) can link two dispar- 
ate structures, or harmonize the appearance of a 
new structure with the architectural character of 
a Conservation District. The preferred surface 
materials for this District are brick, or concrete 
(simulated to look like terra cotta or stucco). The 
texture of surfaces can be treated in a manner so 
as to emphasize the bearing function of the 
material, as is done in rustication on historic 
buildings. In addition, in some cases it may be 
appropriate to leave the surface roughly dressed, 
emphasizing the utilitarian character of the in- 
terior frontages. 

Traditional light colors should be used in 
order to blend in with the character of the 
Kearny Street facades. Dissimilar buildings may 
be made more compatible by using similar or 
harmonious colors, and to a lesser extent, by 
using similar textures. Belden Street facades 
should use red brick and stucco-like materials. 

(4) Detailing and Ornamentation. A new 

building should relate to the surrounding area 
by picking up elements from surrounding build- 
ings and repeating them or developing them for 
new purposes. An ornamental detail can be taken 
from an adjacent building and used in a new 
building to relate the latter to the surrounding 
area. Alternately, similarly shaped forms can be 
used without directly copying historical orna- 
ment. The new structure should incorporate pre- 
vailing cornice lines or belt courses and may use 
a modern vernacular instead of that of the origi- 
nal model. (Added (3rd. 414-85, App. 9/17/85)

SEC. 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 

It is hereby found that the area known and 
described in this Appendix as the &quot;Pine-Sansome 
Street area&quot; is a Subarea within the C-3 District 
that possesses concentrations of buildings that 
together create a Subarea of architectural qual- 
ity and importance which contributes to the 
beauty and attractiveness of the City. It is fur- 
ther found that the area meets the standards for 
designation of a Conservation District as set 
forth in Section 1103 of Article 11 and that the 
designation of said area as a Conservation Dis- 
trict will be in furtherance of and in conformance 
with the purposes of Article 11 of the City Plan- 
ning Code, 

This designation is intended to promote the 
health, safety, prosperity and welfare of the 
people of the City through the effectuation of the 
purposes set forth in Section 1101 of Article 11 
and the maintenance of the scale and character 
of the Pine-Sansome area by: 

(a) The protection and preservation of the 
basic characteristics and salient architectural 
details of structures insofar as these character- 
istics and details are compatible with the Con- 
servation District; 

(b) Providing scope for the continuing vital- 
ity of the District through private renewal and 
architectural creativity, within appropriate con- 
trols and standards; 



(c) Encouragement of the continued inten- 
sive use of the District for financial and business 
office activities. (Added Ord. 414-85, App. 9/1.7/ 
85) 

SEC. 2. DESIGNATION. 

Pursuant to Section 11.03.1 of Article 1.1, of 
the City Planning Code (Part II, Chapter XI of 
the San Francisco Municipal Code), the Pine- 
Sansome area is hereby designated as a Conser- 
vation District. (Added Ord. 414-85, App. 9/17/ 
85) 

SEC. 3. LOCATION AND BOUNDARIES. 

The location and boundaries of the Pine- 
Sansome Conservation District shall be as des- 
ignated on the Pine-Sansome Conservation Dis- 
trict Map, the original of which is on file with the 
Clerk of the Board of Supervisors under File No. 
223-84-4, which Map is hereby incorporated herein 
as though fully set forth, and a facsimile of which 
is reproduced hereinbelow. (Added Ord. 414-85, 
App. 9/17/85.) 

SEC. 4. RELATION TO CITY PLANNING 
CODE. 

(a) Article 11 of the City Planning Code is 
the basic law governing preservation of buildings 
and districts of architectural importance in the 
C-3 District of the City and County of San 
Francisco. This Appendix is subject to and in 
addition to the provisions thereof. 

(b) Except as may be specifically provided 
to the contrary in this Code, nothing in this 
Appendix shall supercede, impair or modify any 
City Planning Code provisions applicable to prop- 
erty in the Pine-Sansome Conservation District, 
including, but not limited to, regulations control- 
ling uses, height, bulk, coverage, floor area ratio, 
required open space, off-street parking and signs. 
(Added Ord. 414-85, App. 9/17/85) 

SEC. 5. JUSTIFICATION. 

The characteristics of the Conservation Dis- 
trict justifying its designation are as follows: 

(a) History of the District. The flat land- 
filled area east of Montgomery Street became an 
early center of household furnishings on Pine 



Supp. No. 3, November/December 2006 



App. J, Sec, 5. 



San Francisco - Planning Code

Street and hotels on Sansome Street. The block 
of Leidesdorff Street near Pine was once known 
as Pauper&apos;s Alley. By 1875, financial offices from 
nearby Montgomery Street had located in the 
area. A stock exchange subdistrict, established in 
the late 1870&apos;s, included the Stock and Exchange 
Board, the Pacific Exchange and the California 
Stock Exchange. This District remained largely 
intact until the Earthquake and Fire of 1906 
when two of the exchanges located elsewhere. In 
the 1920&apos;s, as banks moved their offices north 
along Montgomery Street, some banks and more 
insurance companies located on Pine Street near 
Sansome. 

When the U.S. Subtreasnry Building added 
its 12-story office extension in the late 1920&apos;s, 
the district largely assumed its present architec- 
tural character. The replacement of the Subtrea- 
sury by the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange in the 
1930&apos;s, one of the most important financial insti- 
tutions in the Western United States, was an 
important factor in solidifying the District&apos;s sta- 
tus as a financial center. Ever since then the area 
has played an important role in the financial life 
of the City. 

(b) Basic Nature of the District. The 
distinguishing characteristic of the District is 
the relationship between the street and alley 
network and the series of distinguished office 
and financial buildings from the early part of the 
twentieth century. Buildings are defined and set 
off from each other by an intricate network of 
public and private alleys. Although most build- 
ings are built to the property lines, in several 
cases alleys divide their facades. The network of 
alleys creates open spaces between buildings 
which distinguishes the District from other parts 
of the downtown. The rhythm of buildings and 
street spaces establishes a human scale in the 
District. Another definitive feature is the Pacific 
Coast Stock Exchange, set back from the street 
upon a base of broad steps. Since the building&apos;s 
forecourt provides an intimate open space with 
adequate sunshine, it is a popular daytime gath- 
ering place. 

(c) Architectural Character. The build- 
ings in the District are of high design quality, 
executed in a variety of ornamental styles. Ex- 



amples of Classical Moderne, Skyscraper Gothic, 
Gothic, Georgian Revival, as w r ell as the more 
familiar buildings derived from Renaissance 
sources, create a rich mix of twentieth century 

styles. 

(d) Uniqueness and Location. Near the 

western edge of the financial district, the Dis- 
trict is a large intact example of early twentieth 
century office architecture in the financial dis- 
trict. Aside from other assemblages of historic 
office buildings on California and Montgomery 
Streets, the Pine Sansome district is one of the 
only remaining areas where an entire pre-World 
War II streetscape is intact. 

(e) Visual and Functional Unity. The area 
has a coherent character created by similar small 
to moderate scale buildings executed in like 
materials and colors, and situated on intercon- 
nected alleys and small lots. The series of build- 
ings on the south side of Pine Street is con- 
structed out of grey granite, or terra cotta fired 
to resemble granite. 

(f) Dynamic Continuity. The District has 

been and continues to be an active part of the 
financial district. It contains a variety of uses, 
including offices, banks, services, retail establish- 
ments and small restaurants. 

(g) Benefits to the City and its Resi- 
dents. The District provides a variety of benefits 
to the City and its residents. A range of commer- 
cial services are located within the District, 
including the City&apos;s stock exchange, and a num- 
ber of examples of pre- 1930 office development. 
(Added Ord. 414-85, App. 9/17/85) 

SEC. 6. FEATURES. 

The exterior architectural features of the 
Pine-Sansome Conservation District are as fol- 
lows: 

(a) Massing and Composition. For the 

most part, the buildings are two- or three-part 
vertical compositions. In more elaborate designs 
transitional stories create a stacked composition, 
but the design effect is similar. In addition, 
buildings are often divided through fenestration 
or other detailing into bays to express their 




Supp. No. 3, November/December 2006 



1579 




Preservation of Buildings and Districts of Architectural, 

Historical, and Aesthetic Importance in the C-3 Districts 



App. J, Sec. 7 




internal structure. A common compositional de- 
vice in the District is the emphasis placed upon 
the central bays. 

The massing of the structures is usually a 
simple vertically oriented rectangle with a ratio 
of width to height generally from 1:2 to 1:6, an 
important characteristic of the District. The build- 
ing heights range from 45 feet to 200 feet. 
Building frontages are relatively consistent, gen- 
erally ranging from 40 feet to 75 feet. In addi- 
tion, continuous streetwall heights are a charac- 
teristic of the west side of Pine Street, The 
heights of the buildings step down towards the 
west. With the exception of the Pacific Coast 
Stock Exchange, the buildings in the Pine- 
Sansome Conservation District are built to the 
front property line and occupy the entire site. 

(b) Scale. The buildings are of small to 
moderate scale with bay widths generally from 
20 feet to 30 feet, Wider frontages are often 
broken up by articulation of the facade, making 
the buildings appear narrower. The street front- 
ages are broken up by the aforementioned alleys, 
further limiting the scale of the District. The 
base is generally delineated from the rest of the 
building, giving the District an intimate scale at 
the street, 

(c) Materials and Colors. Buildings are 
constructed of masonry or terra cotta, or various 
shades of brick. The buildings are light-colored 
grays or cream colors, with some red brick build- 
ings. Through the use of rich detailing, often 
executed in deep relief, textural facades are 
emphasized. 

(d) Detail and Ornamentation. The build- 
ings in the District are richly detailed in a wide 
variety of styles for such a small area. Ornamen- 
tal types include rich sculptural groups in the 
Moderne style, bas reliefs, rusticated bases, colon- 
ades, pointed and round headed arches, brack- 
eted cornices, belt courses, and decorative key- 
stones. (Added Ord. 414-85, App. 9/17/85) 

SEC. 7. STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES 
FOR REVIEW OF NEW CONSTRUCTION 
AND CERTAIN ALTERATIONS. 

(a) Standards. Within Conservation Dis- 
tricts, all construction of new buildings and all 
major alterations, which are subject to the pro- 



visions of Sections 1110, 1111 through 1111.6 and 
1113, shall be compatible with the District in 
general with respect to the building&apos;s composi- 
tion and massing, scale, materials and colors, 
and detailing and ornamentation, including those 
features described in Section 6 of this Appendix. 
Emphasis shall be placed on compatibility with 
those buildings in the area in which the new r or 
altered building is located. In the case of major 
alterations, only those building characteristics 
that are affected by the proposed alteration shall 
be considered in assessing compatibility. Signs 
on buildings in Conservation Districts are sub- 
ject to the provisions of Section 1111.7. 

The foregoing standards do not require, or 
even encourage, new buildings to imitate the 
styles of the past. Rather, they require the new to 
be compatible with the old. The determination of 
compatibility shall be made in accordance with 
the provisions of Section 309. 

(b) Guidelines. The guidelines in this Sub- 
section are to be used in assessing compatibility 

(1) Composition and Massing. New con- 
struction should maintain the character of the 
District by relating to the prevailing height, 
mass, proportions, rhythm and composition of 
existing historic buildings. 

The height and massing of new buildings 
should not alter the traditional scale of existing 
buildings, streets and open spaces. Existing street- 
wall heights should be maintained. An appropri- 
ate streetwall height is established by reference 
to the prevailing building height on the block 
and especially to that of adjacent buildings. If 
the adjacent buildings are of a significantly dif- 
ferent height than the rest of the buildings on 
the block, then the prevailing height of buildings 
on the block should be used as a guide. A setback 
at the streetwall height can permit additional 
height above the setback without breaking the 
continuity of the streetwall. 

Most existing buildings are built to the street 
or alley line. This pattern should not be broken 
since it could damage the continuity of building 
rhythms and the definition of streets. 

The standard proportions for new buildings 
should be established by the prevailing street- 



Supp. No. 3, November/December 2006 



App. J, Sec. 7. 



San Francisco - Planning Code 



1580 



wall height and width of lots. Lot assembly 
should be discouraged to maintain the existing 
lot pattern. In cases where lots are combined, 
facades of new buildings should be broken into 
discrete elements that relate to prevailing build- 
ing proportions. The use of smaller bays can be 
used to relate the proportions of a new building 
with those of historic buildings. 

The design of a new structure should repeat 
the prevailing pattern of two- and three-part 
vertical compositions. 

(2) Scale. A major influence on scale is the 
degree to which the total facade plane is broken 
into smaller parts which relate to human scale. 
The existing scale of the immediate area and the 
Conservation District should be maintained by a 
consistent use of size and complexity of detailing 
with regard to surrounding buildings, and the 
continuance of existing bay widths. Base ele- 
ments (of similar height to existing bases) should 
be used to maintain a sense of human scale on 
streets and sidewalks. Large wall surfaces, which 
increase a building&apos;s scale, should be broken up 
through the use of detailing and textural varia- 
tion to reduce the scale. 

Existing fenestration (windows, entrances) 
rhythms and proportions which have been estab- 
lished by lot width or bay width should be 
repeated in new structures. The spacing and size 
of window openings should follow the sequence 
set by existing structures. Large glass areas 
should be broken up by muilions so that the scale 
of glazed areas is compatible with that of neigh- 
boring buildings. 

(3) Materials and Colors. The use of like 
materials can relate two buildings of obviously 
different eras and styles. The use of materials 
that appear similar (such as substituting con- 
crete for terra cotta) can link two disparate 
structures, or harmonize the appearance of a 
new structure with the architectural character of 
a Conservation District. 

The preferred surface materials for this Dis- 
trict are brick, terra cotta, stone, and concrete 
(simulated to look like terra cotta or stone). New 
buildings should use more than one facade ma- 
terial to repeat the pattern prevalent in existing 



structures. Since the common colors of the Dis- 
trict are those of red brick and grey stone, these 
colors as well as earth tones should be used in 
new construction. 

(4) Detailing and Ornamentation. A new 

building should relate to the surrounding area 
by picking up elements from surrounding build- 
ings and repeating them or developing them for 
new purposes. Ornamental details, such as col- 
umns, lintels and arches, can be taken from an 
adjacent building and used in a new building to 
relate the latter to the surrounding area. Simi- 
larly shaped forms can be used without directly 
copying historical ornament. The new structure 
should incorporate prevailing cornice lines, belt 
courses or rusticated bases and may use a mod- 
ern vernacular instead of that of the original 
model. (Added Ord. 414-85, App. 9/17/85)

SEC. 1201. TITLE. 

This ordinance shall be known as the &quot;Oil 
and Gas Facilities Ordinance.&quot; (Added by Ord. 
306-90, App. 8/23/90) 

SEC. 1201.1. OIL AND GAS FACILITIES 
DISTRICT PROVISIONS. 

The provisions set forth in this Article 12 
shall regulate the land use activities, structures, 
equipment and/or facilities associated with oil 
and gas exploration, development and process- 
ing. In the event of conflict between provisions of 



Article 12 and other provisions of this Code, the 
provisions of Article 12 shall prevail. (Added by 
Ord. 306-90, App. 8/23/90) 

SEC. 1202. PURPOSE AND INTENT OF 
ARTICLE 12. 

This Article is intended to regulate all land 
use activities associated with oil and gas explo- 
ration, development and processing, in order to 
ensure consistency between this Code and the 
Master Plan of the City and County of San 
Francisco. More specifically, the purposes of this 
Article are: 

(a) To provide in one Article a comprehen- 
sive listing of zoning categories, control provi- 
sions and review procedures which are appli- 
cable to permits for land use activities associated 
with oil and gas exploration, development and 
processing; 

(b) To establish zoning control categories 
which regulate the full range of land use activi- 
ties that are associated with oil and gas explora- 
tion, development and processing; 

(c) To establish a zoning system which will 
ensure compatibility of land uses permitted within 
neighboring zoning districts, to the maximum 
extent feasible; 

(d) To protect existing and future land use 
activities which are not related to oil and gas 
exploration, development and processing from 
the potential harmful effects of activities which 
are associated with oil and gas exploration, de- 
velopment and processing. (Added by Ord. 306- 
90, App. 8/23/90) 

SEC. 1203. OIL AND GAS FACILITIES 
OVERLAY DISTRICTS. 

The following two classes of overlay zoning 
districts are established for the purpose of regu- 
lating land use activities associated with oil and 
gas exploration, development and processing: 

(a) M-2(OGS): Heavy Industrial, Oil and 
Gas Support Facilities, Overlay District; and
