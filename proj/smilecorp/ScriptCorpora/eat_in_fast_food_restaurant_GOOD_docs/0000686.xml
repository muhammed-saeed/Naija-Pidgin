About


 
We’re here to make food you love, the kind you talk about and look forward to eating. The Clover Food Lab is serving up a new type of fast food. This food is local, it’s just-cut, when we can it is organic.

I always loved the food trucks at MIT when I was a student. September 2008 I thought: what better way to kick things off pre-restaurant than with a truck of our own. A bunch of things fell into place and here we are. Now we have restaurants and trucks around Boston and Cambridge.

The menu will be changing with the seasons, and we’ll keep the latest posted on this site. You can expect french fries made from just-cut PEI potatoes, fresh juices like you’ve never had before, perfect sandwiches, and we’ll be ladling out just-made soups in the winter, salads in the summer.

So keep an eye on this site to follow the journey.

I just discovered Clover and wrote up a review on my local food blog: http://www.meghaneatslocal.com/2012/06/clover-food-lab-fast-food-experiment.html 

I’m based in Santa Barbara, California, but I was glad to find some yummy, local food around Harvard Square! Thanks for a delicious meal (and a fun place to wait out the thunder storms).

Sullen Surly Saturday night at the the Hub: 2 guys doing mostly prep, not a smile in the place; 15 minutes for 6 stalks of asparagus that were bitter and fiber-y on the ends. When I expressed skepticism (3 bucks for 6 stalks? I mean, I know that it’s about 3 bucks a pound at Russo’s), he just shrugged and walked away. You know Clover, we can go other places. So sad.

Thanks so much for sharing this, David. Really sorry she had a bad experience.

We’ve been hearing a few things about eggs being overcooked on the breakfast sandwich. Working on making sure it’s fixed across the board.

Haven’t heard anything negative about the coffee. Will follow up on that.

Alicia,

Thanks so much for the note and for noticing. Couple reasons for the disposable packaging. One is that we’re trying to build Clover as fast food. You may not feel this when you’re waiting for your food, but that’s what we have in mind. You don’t see chinaware at McDonalds, right? It’s also simpler operationally for us if everything goes out in the same packaging (one less step for employees building the food to decide whether it’s to-go or for-here).

Maybe we should make up some mugs/glasses that people could bring back and re-use? We’ve played around a bit with that for beer, but it might work for other stuff too…

Really sorry you had a sad time at the HUB. Was this your first time at Clover? Or do we know you from the MIT truck?

I think a couple issues are at work here:
We didn’t have a manager on, if Bridget had been there she would have been able to answer your questions about the asparagus.
We need to do better training on the 3pm specials. For example, if Jay and Eddie had been trained properly, they would have known how to deal with a fibrous asparagus.

Thanks for reaching out. We’re going to figure out some better staffing and better training for evenings over there. Hope to see you by again.

Thanks Nancy. I think I remember you!

Clover in Santa Fe would be really fun, we could do some pretty amazing hot sauces out there…

We’ll keep you updated if we do a cookbook.

I love chick pea fritter, but had few bad experiences recently.

Recently my sandwich is soggy at the end. It happened to me 3 times in last few weeks. It has juice dripping off and bread gets soggy from inside.

Is their any instruction I can tell order taker, so they reduce the juicy thing inside it?

Thanks.

I am obsessed with your food. It is amazing and healthy and so affordable. The cucumber seaweed salad I had a week ago was the best thing ever. You should come to Davis square!

Please bring back the orange Clover T-shirts (the one with the carrot). I will buy many. And eat at Clover everyday. Every. day.

Really sorry this has been happening to you. It’s a training issue. Just emailed you,
 
 lucia on 9 July, 2012 at 9:59 am 
 
Thanks! Let us know if there’s ever anything we screw up on. And thanks for the location suggestion.
 
 lucia on 9 July, 2012 at 10:02 am 
 
Thanks for the enthusiasm Peter. We love you too!

We make the shirts in limited batches so there are no more carrot ones. There’s one I’m really excited about coming next few weeks, but I’m not allowed to say what it is!

Al,

Super sorry you had a bad time at the HUB. Do we know you from the MIT truck?

This sort of stuff always makes us sad. We’re going to have assistant managers working evenings over there. Should help with 2 things you’re pointing to: training/education about the food and execution of the food.

Would love to hear more from future visits.
