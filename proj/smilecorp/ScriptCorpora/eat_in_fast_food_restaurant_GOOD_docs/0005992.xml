 Family, It’s What’s for Dinner 
 23 12 2011 
My father, Jerry Wendt, is an agriculture teacher and FFA advisor in Stoughton, Wisconsin. My mother, Sharon Wendt, is the director for career and technical education programs for the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction. Growing up as the son of these two agriculture and career focused parents was the best gift I could have ever asked for. I have many fond memories of growing up on our small pumpkin hobby farm. Autumn was my favorite season. The bright orange pumpkins on the front lawn, the crisp cool air rustling through the leaves and, of course, Sunday afternoons watching my Green Bay Packers.

The best part about those Sundays was watching my dad put a beef roast or whole turkey into the oven before church and coming home to the delightful aromas that awaited us at the dinner table. Both my parents, despite their busy schedules, made sure my brother, sister and I ate dinner together with them every night of the week. It’s pretty remarkable when you think about how such a simple act of eating a home cooked meal together, made such an impact on our family. Eating together was more than just a chance to hear about everyone’s day or plan the week out, it was a chance to bond over a good meal. Those dinners are something that I will cherish for my whole life.

As I grew up, I got more involved with FFA, school, sports and other activities. My brother and sister also branched out and like our parents, took every opportunity to get involved. As our family got older we got busier and those nightly meals together began to occur less frequently. As I graduated from high school, it was common that two or more of us five people would be occupied with some other event. Family dinner seemed less important.

I tell you about my family because I think it’s true of many in America these days. The pressures of work and school force family time to take a back seat to other commitments. That family time that was centered around cooking a meal for family dinner was lost. Certainly dinner and how we eat changes as we grow older and I think that is something we need to be very concerned about as agriculturalists.

Processed foods have found a niche in the fast-paced society we now live in. Americans want their food fast, hot and ready to go. Food processors have capitalized on this demand and will continue to do so for as long as these food products are desired.

I am most certainly not going to demonize processed foods. As an aspiring food scientist, I recognize the need for processed foods for the food security and longevity they provide. Going back to those family dinners, every one had some item processed. No, we were not eating ready to eat microwavable dinners every night, but milk was at every dinner, a product that undergoes considerable processing. Whether it be in canned fruits and vegetables or meat products there was some element of processing.

These dinners, though, always had some element of cooking as well. Be it heating the canned foods, or cooking the meat or baking a dessert. There was always some time put into dinner. My parents invested their time into food, with the knowledge that it would better the family.

That is what I feel is being lost in America today.

There are a lot of problems regarding food and health these days. I personally don’t have the expertise to speak about heart disease or diabetes. However this is what I do know. Everybody has some element of family in their lives and everybody needs to eat. Lets focus on bringing those two things, food and family, together more often.

The good news is that it’s relatively easy to do because it’s all about your mindset. Rather than make a mad dash to the nearest fast food restaurant at 5:30 for dinner see what’s in your cupboard that you could cook. Dinner need not be stressful, but I think many people don’t feel they have the time or skills to make a good dinner so they don’t even attempt it. We need to work together as consumers and producers to find ways to get families to eat together again.

Make food fun. Make a list of your planned dinners for the week and shop for just those items. Get excited to cook. Involve the family. Give your children a night where they get to make the dinner. Teach them how to cook.

American’s have lost their intimate relationship with food and getting that back has to be the most important thing. It doesn’t matter if you choose organic, natural or traditional foods, if its vegetarian, vegan or meat lovers. Invest your time into making dinner, and invest that dinner in your family and surely good things will follow.

The Wendt family owes much of its love for one another to those family dinners. We had a variety of food from a variety of sources. The food was the focal point that we used to bring us all together. So stop skimping on your family time and invest in you, your children and your family and plan a dinner this week. Cook it together, enjoy it together and, please, stay together.

 Farming, Family and the Future 
 25 11 2011 
Rarely does a day go by that I’m not thankful for how I was brought up. Working on my family’s dairy farm, I was blessed to learn so many important values, a strong work ethic and knowledge I use to this day.

True, I may not have given you such an idyllic response in my younger years. Trudging through snow on a chilly January morning to feed baby calves or clean cattle pens was not always my idea of a great time. I’ll admit that there were many times when I loathed the position of my friends living“in town,”many of whom, I surmised, might still be wrapped up in a warm bed.

The older I get, however, the more I realize how I wouldn’t have traded that upbringing for the world. As a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I witness fellow students who quite frankly don’t have the character or work ethic that I do. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t mean to stereotype every student at a Big Ten school as lazy or somehow less motivated than me, but I notice a difference in my classmates who came from a production agriculture background. It’s those experiences that have made us the people we are.

And in a perfect example of government overregulation, the U.S. Department of Labor has announced it intends to create new rules that would end many of the experiences that have influenced young people in agriculture so positively. These new rules make many simple farm practices, things I’ve done for years, off-limits to youth. The proposed rules represent a complete lack of understanding of modern production agriculture and disregard the future of our food system.

I think most people involved with agriculture recognize the inherent dangers present. Farm implements are increasingly large and powerful. Livestock are unpredictable at times and need to be worked with cautiously.

Consequently, safety has become a key theme on farms. I know that my parents always made the welfare and safety of my sister and me a top priority as we grew up. Every day was not only an opportunity to learn the finer points of farming, it was an opportunity to learn how to farm safely. Further, I don’t think any farmer would put their kids in a situation they didn’t perceive as completely safe.

Modern agriculture is likely safer than it has ever been in the past. In recent years, we’ve seen renewed emphasis on farm safety for everyone involved in agriculture. Education has served a key role in reducing fatalities and injuries in a dangerous profession. As a youth, I attended a tractor safety course offered through cooperative extension and the local technical college. This course is required for youth operators in Wisconsin, and represents a great example of a local program improving farm safety.

Perhaps the greatest risk of these rules comes in pushing the next generation of agriculturists away from farming. We live in a society that I believe is truly blessed to have a great food system.

However, if U.S. agriculture is about to feed a growing world appetite for food, fuel and fiber, we need another generation of farmers. The average farmer is age 57 and jobs in agriculture are projected to grow substantially in coming years. Prohibiting youth from working on farms until, in some cases, age 18 will lead them away from agriculture and the positive benefits that I know result from an upbringing on the farm.

As we face the question of how to create a better food system, the answer is not to push young people away from the farm. Rather, our federal government should consider how they can improve farm safety and actively foster continued involvement by the next generation in agriculture. It’s time to resist the idea that regulation is the answer, and instead start finding common sense solutions to improving farm safety.

Thomas Jefferson once said,“Farming may not always be the best of times, but it is the best of lives.”It’s time to encourage the Department of Labor to recognize the value of youth in agriculture and the positive benefits it brings to them, because while feeding calves on a cold summer morning or unloading hay on a hot summer afternoon, I became a better person.
