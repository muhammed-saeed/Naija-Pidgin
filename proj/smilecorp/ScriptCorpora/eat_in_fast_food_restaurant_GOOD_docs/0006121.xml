1/4 x 1 1/4 Phillips Pan Wall-Dog™ Light Duty Anchors White - Box (100) - The Wall-Dog™ is an all steel, one-piece screw anchor, which features high-profile threads for easy fastening into wallboard and other masonry base materials. The deep cutting, corkscrew-like threads provide for smooth entry and a powerful hold. When removed, the Wall-Dog™ leaves a much smaller hole than toggles or other systems. For aesthetic appearances, the Wall-Dog™ is available in two color finishes: white and chrome; and in two head styles; pan and oval. For fastening into wallboard or wood, no pre-drilling is required - the anchor is inserted through the fixture and screwed in with an ordinary Phillips screwdriver. Fastening into concrete, hollow or grout-filled concrete masonry, brick and plaster requires a pre-drilled hole using a 3/16” ANSI bit. Wall-Dog™ anchors are ideal for light to medium duty anchoring. Typical applications include lightweight fixtures, drapery supports, as well as electrical, telephone and cable accessories. Less

This daily formula gives your pet both Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids for skin support at an economical price. Contains a more-preferred ratio of these two fatty acids than both Derm Caps and Shed Stop. Also contains the antioxidant nutrients Vitamin E and Vitamin C, plus zinc, to help maintain the body&apos;s natural defenses. We recommend combining with Biotin. How the key ingredients work Omega-3 helps stabilize normal cells against the effects of potentially damaging substances. Linoleic acid is an Omega-6 fatty acid that helps keep moisture in the skin. When the skin has a normal amount of moisture, it supports a healthy, lustrous haircoat. Vitamin E, Vitamin C and zinc are antioxidant nutrients. Antioxidant nutrients help neutralize outside cell invaders called &quot;free radicals.&quot; Free radicals oxidize components of the cells, including those in the skin, and damage them, like rust oxidizes and damages steel. Zinc also works with over 200 enzymes in the body for proper cell health and metabolism and skin function. Capsules: For small dogs and cats Suggested daily use: One capsule for up to 20 lbs of body weight. (For a 40 lb dog, we recommend 2 capsules daily.) Liquid: For dogs and cats Suggested daily use: For dogs: 0.5 ml per30 lbs, 1 ml per 60 lbs of body weight, 1.5 ml per 90 lbs of body weight. For cats (any size) 0.1 - 0.2 ml per day. Capsules: For large dogs Suggested daily use: One capsule per 40 pounds of body weight. Please click on &quot;More Information&quot; for further details.

1/4 x 1 1/4 Square Pan Wall-Dog™ Light Duty Anchors Zinc - Box (100) - The Powers Wall-Dog™ is the industry’s first all steel one-piece screw anchor, which features high-profile threads for easy fastening into wallboard and other masonry base materials. Its deep cutting, corkscrew-like threads provide for smooth entry and a powerful hold, and when removed the Wall-Dog leaves a much smaller hole than toggles or other systems. For aesthetic appearances, the Wall-Dog is available in five color finishes: White, Chrome, Black, Brass and Bronze. It is also available in five head styles: Hex, Wafer, Robertson, Oval and Pan. For fastening into wallboard or wood, no pre-drilling is required. The anchor is inserted through the fixture and screwed in with an ordinary Phillips screwdriver or screw gun. Fastening into concrete, hollow or grout-filled block, brick and plaster requires a pre-drilled 3/16” ANSI hole. Powers Wall-Dog™ anchors are ideal for light to medium duty anchoring. Typical applications include lightweight fixtures, drapery supports as well as electrical, telephone and cable accessories. Less
