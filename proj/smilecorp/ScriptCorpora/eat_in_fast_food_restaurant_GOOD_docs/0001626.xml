Quick high calorie meals?
 I&apos;m trying to gain weight, since I&apos;m dramatically under weight. My doctor said I need to gain weight soon. So what are some quick and easy meals that have high calories?

 Rather than going for high fat content, I recommend high carbohydrates and increasing (&quot;healthy&quot;) fat consumption only slightly. I&apos;m also trying to put on weight (although only three or four kilos) as I&apos;m a bit on the thin side and we&apos;re in flu season here. I&apos;m concerned about eating lots of fats and having this effect my cholesterol etc as thin does not equal healthy!
Try eating a lot of pasta and potatoes, and add a little extra fat where you can.
For snacks:
Cut a slit in the top of a medium sized potato, microwave on high for seven minutes. Fill the potato with cheese, add olives if you wish, season with black pepper.
Crusty bread with pate and creamy cheeses.
Peanut butter on toast.
Half an avocado with frozen shrimp and black pepper.

For meals:
pasta with tomato-based sauce and ground beef (fry meat with onions, add a tin of tomatoes, some herbs, salt, pepper, stir until heated through)
curry and rice - cook meat of your choice in a large frying pan with onions and mushrooms, add one tin of coconut cream, ginger, coriander, cumin to taste, plus one tin of tomatoes, heat until reduced slightly.

Try to slightly larger portions than you normally would, and more often than you usually do, but don&apos;t eat so much that you feel ill! Once you start to eat more, your metabolism and appetite should both increase (this is a good thing!)

It also helps to take back some of those&quot;thin&quot;choices and reverse them - add a little extra cheese to meals and snacks, drink whole milk instead of trim,&quot;real&quot;coke instead of diet, have olive oil on salads instead of just vinegar etc.

 Pastas are very good for that and very cheap. Spaghetti, lasagna, etc.

Also something with potatoes or fries as a side as they&apos;re very starchy. You can just buy the instant potatoes if you quick and easy...or the frozen french fries.

Also, things that are breaded like fish sticks, etc. The breading adds a surprising amount of calories.

 Here are a couple good links that suggest the best way to gain weight and a link for a healthy diet/the best food to eat to help gain weight. Although you can gain weight quickly, fast foods is the wrong kind of fat to eat....you can gain weight by eating healthy fats.

Complex carbohydrates (starches) such as whole grains, pasta, cereals, beans, yams, potatoes and rice also have higher calorie densities than fibrous carbs. A typical restaurant sized serving of pasta contains 800-1000 calories. Obviously, pasta and other complex carbohydrates are great foods for gaining weight.

 Stick to whole wheat breads, cereals and pastas. Lean beef, chicken and fish. And load up on fruits and vegetables. Drink a protein shake each day as well. Eat 5-6 small/medium size meals a day. Eat between 3250-4000 calories each day. This will help you gain weight in a healthy way.

Stay away from fast food, sugar and snacks. That will only make you gain&apos;bad&apos;weight and will clog your arteries and cause health problems.
