 changed for the worse, new look, miz grazi burgers and seasoned fries ARE GONE!. I went to Backyard Burgers for the first time in a while because it is always out of my way to get there. I always loved making the special trip to get a miz grazi burger, a totally unique spicy kind of burger, and scrumptious, delicious seasoned fries. Well, they are GONE, defunct, extinct, no more, adiosed, au revoired, and out of here.

So am I. Once BB would have gotten five stars from me. Looks like I am not the only one who is bummed out. Notice the good reviews are from 2002 and the bad ones are from this year.

Change is splendid when it is for the better. This change is far from peachy keen. BRING BACK THE MIZ GRAZI AND SEASONED FRIES IF YOU WANT MY BUSINESS! …

 I can&apos;t believe that this place is still open!. My first experience with Backyard Burgers was a few years ago in Mississippi, I was impressed and remember saying&quot;I wish we had one of these back home&quot;. The place was always busy and the food was way ahead of the other burger joints. Well, we have one back home now, and to tell you the truth I wish we didn&apos;t. I&apos;m trying to be nice but I just can&apos;t find a way to do it. Last time I ate there, everything that typically could go wrong in a fast food restaurant did, big time. The place wasn&apos;t clean, they almost short changed me, they were verrry slow, then when I got up to check and see what the problem was, they told me my order was cancelled because they couldn&apos;t find me. I NEVER LEFT. I WAS SITTING THERE THE WHOLE TIME watching other people get their food. Hey, no problem right, but then the little kid running the place piped up with a&quot;you must have left or my guy here would have saw you&quot;, (his guy had a chip on his shoulder the size of a boulder). Not wanting to argue with him BEFORE I got my food I remained calm, but in hindsight should have got a refund and just split. They did eventually give me my burger and fries (nothing special) and I got out of there. I have heard of similar experiences from people that I know, and to sum it up the general consensus is to avoid the place. The manager (scooter) wasn&apos;t worried about the trash all over the place or the mess, he was sticking by the other kid who had an attitude, apparently out of frustration caused by my unwillingness to accept incorrect change. Did I mention that they were not that busy? That&apos;s been a little while ago and I certainly have no intention of going back for more, they seemed to start out with a winning concept and I used to be a fan, but poor regional management will be the death of this company, mark my words. …

 Who&apos;s backyard are these cooked in?. I had the unpleasant experience of eating at Backyard Burgers near the airport. The burger was cold, all the ice tea was gone from the dispensers and when another customer mentioned it, no one cared.The burger was mealy, yucky and I will never go to another Backyard Burger.On a positive note, the fries were good and the service was also good. …

 Char-grilled Black Angus burgers taste like they came from your own backyard.. In Short
 By all appearances, Back Yard Burgers doesn&apos;t differ from your average fast-food restaurant. What sets this chain apart is the high-quality beef. Touted as the &quot;Original Gourmet,&quot; Back Yard burgers are 100-percent Black Angus beef. The menu offers several specialty burgers, including the spicy Black Jack, a blackened patty topped with pepper jack cheese and tangy Creole mayonnaise. Those who shy away from red meat go for juicy charbroiled chicken sandwiches, veggie burgers and salads. …

 Beef Tips are here!. This is definately the best burger in town. The toppings were fresh and the cheese was even melted. But dont drive thru- they arent as good for some reason.

 makesmehungry. I would recommend these hamburgers to anyone--they are huge, juicy,&amp;done the way you want--as close to my own homemade as you get.
