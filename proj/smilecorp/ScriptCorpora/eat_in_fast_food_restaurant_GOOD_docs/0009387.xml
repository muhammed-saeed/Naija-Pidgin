The food and service is pretty darn good!
 I mainly get their sliced pork chops with gravy&amp;onions! De-licious!! I&apos;ve never eaten at the restaurant and gotten sick afterwards. Most fast food/restaurant food will upset my tummy; but not Foodtopia. I&apos;ve been patronizing this spot for over 2 years, and they&apos;ve never let me down. I have a pretty outgoing personality so generally don&apos;t have trouble with people. In other words, their staff seems and is very friendly to me and the people that has been in there when I went. B/c I&apos;m such a regular for their pork chops, the Asian man who generally takes care of the buffet...smiles at me b/c he knows im headed for the pork chops. When they are out, b/c I may take a very late lunch; he always says,&quot;you have to come earlier...we are all out.&quot;We both laugh and then i have to select other menu items. He&apos;s a very nice guy. I guess it depends on what service you are looking for; afterall, this is not Capital Grille. LOL In summary, I will continue to patronize this business b/c again...I love their food, the choices, and their staff. Hope you go soon...but don&apos;t eat all the pork chops and gravy!

Good Food choice, bad service and sanitary
 When I visited Foodtopia, the selection of food was good, but the employees there were not friendly and the area was dirty. There were crumbles of food everywhere and they didn&apos;t clean well. cocosua88 • Mar 02, 2009 • Follow this reviewer • Report this review 
 

Excellent buffet Style!
 I eat at Foodtopia a couple times a week for lunch and am never disappointed! Hot food, cold food, grill and soups are all fresh and cooked perfect! The best thing is there is no horrible garlic smell on their food! The hand carved turkey&amp;roast beef are excellent and the pork chops w/gravy&amp;onions...oh so tender. You can&apos;t go wrong at Foodtopia!! applebee • Feb 17, 2009 • Follow this reviewer • Report this review 
 

Foodtopia - You Will Never be disappointed!!
 This restaurant provides a wide variety of food and fruits. Its food is always taste the same and is extremely delicious. I am not quiet sure how this is achieved but the fruits are always fresh and sweet! Excellent customer service in making each customer feel like he or she is the only one being served. I have had the opportunity to dine in, carry out, and use the catering service. I have nothing but good words for this restaurant, its management, and employees.
I give this establishment 5 stars! Feb 07, 2007 • Report this review
