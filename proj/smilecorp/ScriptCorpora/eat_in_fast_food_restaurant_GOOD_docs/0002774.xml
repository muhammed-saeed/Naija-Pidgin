Chicken time! If you like chicken, odds are good you&apos;ve been to Nando&apos;s at some point. One of the better imports from South Africa and inspired by the Portuguese, Nando&apos;s is a prime choice when you want a cheap and cheerful meal that&apos;s somewhat healthy (compared to KFC) and fairly quick. But odds are good you knew that so let&apos;s get into specifics.

This particular Nando&apos;s is very spacious and during the week you are likely to be seated immediately or at worst wait a few minutes. Weekends are a bit trickier and I&apos;ve been told of waits up to 30 minutes (which isn&apos;t too bad for a restaurant, but for Nando&apos;s is an eternity!). With the high turnover, you are almost guaranteed freshly grilled meats, crisp and crunchy chips, and corn on the cob that&apos;s bursting with flavour (and thankfully not butter).

Foodwise, the chicken is just like every other Nando&apos;s (gotta love franchise standardisation). Most times, they get it right with flavour filled skin and tender moist chicken. However, there are those occasions where the chicken comes out dry and no amount of sauce will help. With this particular one, I&apos;d say they get it right 4 times out of 5 which is a pretty good ratio.

Make sure you get your sauces as soon as possible. Given the high ratio of eaters to sauce bottles and the tendency of people to grab every sauce they might want, there have been occasions here where no sauce could be found and you had to go table to table hoping to strike it lucky and borrow a bottle. Not much fun when all you want to do is dive into your food.

Wine and beer are available at more than reasonable prices (a glass of red wine costs £2.10 for example) so easily a place to get your drink on while you eat. It makes Nando&apos;s a great pre-night out spot. This location has plenty of table staff so you can wave one over for another drink instead of trekking out and waiting 15 mins in line again.

The front door is a bit tricky when it&apos;s cold out as the heat from the grills just inside create a high pressure area that takes a bit of elbow grease to barge through. It does provide entertainment while waiting in line though so overall a plus point. The lines tend to be a bit long so expect to wait 10-15 minutes to place your order.

Overall, definitely the best Nando&apos;s for groups that I&apos;ve been in and something to keep in mind anytime you&apos;re out near LB.

Reading some other reviews, I think it makes a big difference when you eat at this Nandos. We had an early dinner for 15 of us and a few of us came away proclaiming it was our favourite Nandos of all time. Ok, that was probably the Super Bock talking, but I think you could do worse. It&apos;s huge, I like the arches feel and it&apos;s right on the river.

Being on the river might just be it&apos;s downfall though - as I&apos;m sure it attracts hella lot of tourists, which traditionally means surly, tired staff. Not on the occasion we visited, but I bet you could find yourself on the end of a tongue-lashing should you hold up the queue.

I&apos;ll go back though!

You&apos;ve gotta try Nando&apos;s, Stephy! Ya just gotta!

And so I did and I think I can safely say that this building is far too cool for a Nando&apos;s to call home. Nando&apos;s is a chain, you see, and while the chicken was tasty and the meal somewhat satisfying, Nando&apos;s has no business calling such a rad space home. It&apos;s just wrong.

For starters, this place is HUUUUGE. We are talking super high ceilings, gorgeous exposed brick walls, views of the water and a layout large enough to house a circus! But all of this for chicken? Clearly the chain must be doing well, but I shudder to imagine how much the rent must cost here.

As for the food, it&apos;s chainy. I ordered the 6 lil&apos; chicken wings and with spicy rice and garlic toast and they were tasty enough, but after just coming back from Portugal and eating my own weight in delicious authentic fare, this definitely tasted like a chain to me.

Also, with this location soooo close to the market up the way with a wide array of tasty nibblies to choose from, I say, go local and ditch the chain.

While visiting the London, our British hosts raved about Nandos! This location is really cool because it&apos;s built along the river bank, using the previous industrial structure.

The chicken is grilled to a juicy perfection. They have an array of sauces that compliments the chicken nicely. The spicy rice was okay but the ratatoulle was very bland and mushy.

In life, there are Nan-DOs, and Nan-DON&apos;Ts

This is definitely a nan-DON&apos;Ts

Closing up 15 minutes early, huffing and puffing through our take-away orders, and asking if I want to scrape up the excess frozen yogurt from the drip tray (oh, I&apos;m dead serious)... this pretty much closed the Nando&apos;s book for me. For good.

And I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll live hap-peri-perily ever after sans-o Nandos.

The end.

Beware the ginger dragon that doth guard the hallowed gates of PeriPeri-topia. Cross her and she will snarl and snipe and withhold fro-Yo!

As I said to Laura N last night, sometimes a vicious Yelping just doesn&apos;t do it. So this particular experience will end up in one of my infamous customer service complaint letters. After being denied tapas, a bunch of relatively sober Yelpers toddled along to Nando&apos;s, skipping with glee as we imagined chicken from drawers and halloumi goodness. But the manager behind the counter snidely told us it was take out only and we had 5 minutes to order.

Sigh! Okay we all lined up to order and quickly realised this lady was in a baaad mood. She rebuked all of us in some way or another, snapped and bitchily took our orders. Thinking it was just me and Ciaran R, I asked the rest what they thought and ruuuude was the answer. It was to get worse though. I ordered fro-yo and got a big cup to fill from the machine, which I thought switched off automatically... Err no it didn&apos;t, my bad!

So when Laura N went up to order her fro-yo, she was denied by the lady because &apos;your friend left the machine on&apos; (oops). She followed it up by &apos;but you can pay, I&apos;ll give you a cup and you can scrap off what&apos;s left on the drip tray ... (!!) Yeah I effed up, but there was no instructions on the machine and no staff to help. Even so, this kind of attitude is totally unacceptable. Regardless of the time you enter, 2pm or 11pm, you should be treated with the same courtesy and respect.

This Nando&apos;s gets two stars though because the building is beautiful and the only problem with the place was her. She needs to be reminded that the unemployment rate is hitting record high numbers.

I always forget about this place when I&apos;m making dinner plans but it&apos;s really good food. I love this particular branch of the chain though because it&apos;s designed to fit in with the surrounding buildings, using arches and bare brick work like in the clink beside it.

The food is always good here, last time I went with my friend we both got a chicken burger with fries and she got a corn on the cob as well. The corn was a little dry but everything else was delicious. What makes Nandos unique is that they can serve restaurant quality Portuguese food at below restaurant level prices because they have eliminated waiter service, making it a kind of gourmet fast food restaurant. You&apos;re seated when you arrive, then you go to the counter to order your food, and they deliver it to your table once it&apos;s cooked. You also help yourself to drinks and cutlery.

It costs £5.80 for a chicken fillet with fries, and a side order of corn was £1.70. Unlimited drinks cost £1.90 which is brilliant as I usually order a few cokes at dinner. If helping yourself to drinks and forks means getting such delicious food for this price I hope the good word will spread to all the overpriced restaurants in town!

This is by far my favourite Nando&apos;s.  It sits perfectly within its surroundings, working around the impressive arches and vaults, making it a rather spectacular venue for a fast-food restaurant.  There are large tables throughout the spacious interior and the service is as quick as it should be in a Nando&apos;s.

As you might already know, Nando&apos;s specializes in selling chicken.  Best on the menu is the grilled chicken which can be spiced to your liking.  Funnily enough, last time I was here we ordered a half spiced, half lemon-zest whole chicken, so they do leave you the opportunity to personalize your meals and have a taste of both.  Even though most of the people I know adore Nando&apos;s, I still can&apos;t help but feel that the food is a bit dry at times, but their famous Peri Peri always does wonders to make this better.  I also do quite enjoy the Nando&apos;s routine of having control over drink refills, sauces, plates and cutlery.

This is the perfect place to venture when feeling peckish after a stroll down the beautiful London Southbank.

Went here for dinner, was thoroughly confused initially, but I figured it out quickly (why do all restaurants in London have vastly different ordering/seating methods?).  Got the Hot Chicken Breast in a Pita with a side salad.  Chicken was pretty dry, but covered in a delicious sauce.  I also had the roasted red pepper dip, which was pretty good.  Overall, pretty decent meal, not on the top of the list, but still pretty good.  Also, when they say Hot, they mean Hot, so be ware if you can&apos;t stand the heat.

From what I understand, Nando&apos;s is a chain in London. For a chain, this isn&apos;t bad and is unique -- for London? Why do I say for London you might ask? Well, because I&apos;m from the US and I live near a town called Newark that has TONS of similar establishments to Nandos, that are much more authentic. When I hear Portuguese roast chicken I think of juicy, fall off the bone goodness. Nandos? It was definitely fall off the bone and juicy, but was seriously lacking in flavor. I tried the mango something one and didn&apos;t taste any seasoning at all, simply tasted like chicken. I had to douse my chicken in their Peri Peri sauce, which i will praise. It is garlicky and spicy. Not the spicy that hits you right away, but definitely does after a few bites. Very yummy and wanted to steal a bottle of it ha. The two sides that I got were chips and rice. The chips weren&apos;t crispy :( I like them crispy, but were tasty with the Periperi sauce. I could probably eat everything with that peri peri sauce!! Rice was OK... nothing special. Overall, it was a decent dinner, but it didn&apos;t live up to the authentic Portuguese roast chicken I&apos;ve had in Newark, NJ.
