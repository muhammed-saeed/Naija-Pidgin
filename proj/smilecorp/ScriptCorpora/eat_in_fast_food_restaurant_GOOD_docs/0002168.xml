Open Containers in Cars

 By Brenda Williams 
 
When I was in college, a few of my friends and I were getting ready to go out to a popular dance club one night. Since I wasn&apos;t really a &quot;drinker&quot;, this quickly translated into me being the designated driver. After I had made my rounds to pick up all of my friends in my Jeep, one of the friends of my friend announced that the &quot;party was getting an early start&quot;. I quickly glanced around to see her whipping a bottle of liquor out of her purse. We had just made a pit stop at a local fast food restaurant before getting on the road, and suddenly it made sense why. Glancing in the rear view mirror, I saw the girls pouring each other soda into individual cups and then adding a decent amount of liquor to each cup. I couldn&apos;t believe it. Almost immediately, my car started to smell like alcohol.

Because I was driving (and also because I&apos;m really not a &apos;drinker&apos;), I focused on the road before me and did not engage in the drinking activities. It crossed my mind (several times) that I should say something because I knew that if for some strange reason we were to get pulled over, we could all be arrested for having an open container of alcohol in the vehicle. How could my friends be so selfish. I made a decision from that point on to not allow anyone to drink in my car. But in the meantime, I totally let it slide. Once we got to our final destination, it was all that I could do to make sure that the liquor bottle was properly disposed of and that my car was allowed to air out a little before we left to go inside. I was furious and still could not believe how incredibly selfish my friends had acted. Needless to say, my night had been ruined.

There are countless numbers of other people out there who have to deal with the same types of issues that I was forced to deal with. However, there is nothing like having to face your peers in order to defend yourself and make sure that your message to them is clear: don&apos;t open and consume alcoholic beverages while you are in a car. Even if you are not the driver, you can all risk getting into trouble and getting arrested. I wanted to scream this at the top of my lungs, but back then I was too much of a coward. Today, my friends know where I stand. They also have had time to wise up about the decisions that they make with regards to alcohol as many of them have had one too many close calls. These close calls could have cost my friends their lives or the lives of other people around them.

Drinking and driving will never get you anywhere except for the back seat of a police car. I should know because I used to be a police officer.
