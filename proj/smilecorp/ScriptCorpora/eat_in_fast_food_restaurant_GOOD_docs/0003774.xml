 The Ultimate AC Manual, Make $2000 Monthly 
 
 The Complete Associated Content  
 Guide To Making $2000+ a Month 
 &quot; Friend Of A Former Associated Content Employee Reveals All &quot; 
 
 IF YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO WORK  
 HARD THEN THIS IS NOT FOR YOU! 
 UNLIKE MOST E-BOOKS I&apos;M NOT PROMISING  
 YOU EASY MONEY AT ALL. YOU GOTTA WORK.   
 
 TREAT MY COMPLETE ASSOCIATED CONTENT GUIDE TO MAKING $2000 A MONTH LIKE A REAL BUSINESS WITH A SOLID BUSINESS PLAN&amp;WORK ETHIC 
 DO THAT YOU WILL BE SUCCESSFUL, OTHERWISE DON&apos;T WAST YOUR TIME 
 
 I know everyone online has been approached with the proposition of a &quot;Make Money Fast&quot; scheme on the internet. Offering the magic e-book that will allow you to do minimal work on the internet while you watch the money just come pouring in. Well let me tell you something... this is not one of those offers&amp;to be quite frank; nothing of that sort exists. If it does it&apos;s either illegal or short lived; most of the time it is both! 

 That&apos;s why The Complete Associated Content Guide To Making $2,000 A Month E-Book was written. You can make real good $$ with it, it just doesn&apos;t come easy. You will have to put in hours of work a day, but it&apos;s worth it. 

 What I&apos;m offering you is actually a source to make money that will last. It really has the potential to make you steady income the more consistent you are with sticking to the plan in the e-book every day. If your a slacker this won&apos;t work. The longer you work the plan the more residual income you can learn in the long run. There are many testimonials of people who quit completely and received small residual checks for years after words every sing month. Nothing crazy, but most reported about $ 100 -$ 150 a month residual for even a year after quitting Associated Content . 

 If your looking for an e-book that&apos;s going to get you rich&amp;do it so fast you&apos;ll be banking 20k a month then this e-book is not for you&amp;stop chasing fantasies. For all of you out there who live in a realistic world like me, I can teach you how to make your self between $ 1000 -$ 2000 a month with Associated Content if you have some self determination after reading The Complete AC Guide To Making $2,000 a Month 

 These numbers are not the max either, I just don&apos;t promise people something that is not the normal outcome. I can say those who have scaled up this method of using Associated Content with simple outsourcing, have cleared $ 5,000 

 If you don&apos;t already know of Associated Content than let me direct you to Associated Content.com It&apos;s a content company that pays you for submitting articles in all types of categories. You can basically write about anything as long as it&apos;s 400 words or more. They pay you $ 1.50 per 1000 page views of your article.   
 The Complete Associated Content Guide To Making $2,000 a Month covers in depth how to get max payouts for page views,&amp;even tricks for getting your page view count up fast. 

 You see, this is where things get tricky with Associated content. You can also submit your articles for upfront payment with page view payouts on top of that. As long as your a US citizen and Associated Content excludes certain categories from upfront payments. I cover all of this in the Complete Associated Content Guide To Making $2,000 a Month E-Book . 

 Associated content claims they pay between $ 1 -$ 20 per 400+ word article. Not quite a lie but sure not exactly true. You have to be a Clout Level 5 before you can even go near an article worth $10 or more, which I will also show you how to achieve. Regular users just starting out are lucky to get between $ 1.00 -$ 2.50 . That is it, period. Occasionally you will get a freak article that make $ 3.00 when your starting out. But it&apos;s very uncommon. The E-Book Guide covers this in depth&amp;shows you how to get higher upfront payments quickly. 

 Ready to do some math? How many articles do you think you could write a day? All of them being 400+ words. You have to proof reading, cite your sources, and go through at least a 10 min. process to submit them. I&apos;ll be honest, I&apos;m a 4 article a day average writer when writing 100% new original content articles. On a day where I REALLY hustle I&apos;ve hit 7 articles. That&apos;s working a 8 hr day in my home office. So here it goes in the BEST case scenario starting out with no guidance. 
 
( Which won&apos;t happen, it&apos;s really hard after months&amp;months of training my work habits to get to 7 finished a day that are acceptable articles. If you turn in 7 maybe only 5 will qualify for upfront payment ) 

 
1) You got 7 articles in a day written&amp;submitted. Lets say they accepted 6 for upfront payments
 
 2) You got the MAX payment possible as new comer $3 for each article (once again unlikely)

 3) 7 articles X $ 3.00 = $ 21.00 for the whole 8 hour day of work.

 4) $ 21.00 a day for 5 days = $ 105 for the week&amp;$ 420 for the entire month working FULL TIME. 
 
 
 The Complete Associated Content Guide To Making $2,000+ a Month will teach you exactly how to fix this problem if you are willing to work hard. 
  
 This is a sad amount of pay for someone working full time. Part time working at a fast food restaurant would net you more money.

 The trick to Associated Content is knowing first &quot;What They Want&quot; in your writing. Which My E-Book covers from an inside perspective. Being a friend of a former employee I know how there software works that determines your upfront payments or if you even receive one. Another secret I&apos;ll reveal here is they have editors as well that read your articles after the software scans it through. I&apos;ll break down what they look at as well to determine your pay. 

 With the right amount of determination&amp;thinking outside the box I can get your payments up to $ 5 -$ 7 consistent&amp;teach you how to get these elusive $ 10 -$ 20 articles. These articles are guaranteed as well, they tell you how much they are going to pay you before you write them. 

 7 articles a day X $ 5.00 = $ 35.00 a day X 5 days = $ 175 a week X 4 weeks = $ 700 a month. Not bad at all but still not the $ 2,000 I&apos;m promising,&amp;nowhere near the stories of $ 5,000 a month. 

 THE KEY IS HOW TO OUTSOURCE &amp;DO IT RIGHT. I WILL TEACH YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW TO TURN YOUR AC ACCOUNT INTO An AC BUSINESS! I&apos;LL TEACH HOW TO FIND, HIRE, TRAIN,&amp;MANAGE QUALITY RE-WRITERS FOR $ 1 AN ARTICLE. THEN GET AC TO PAY YOU BACK $ 5 AN ARTICLE. 

 With all of my inside knowledge being a friend of a former 


 AC employee I will teach you how to work AC in a manner that will make you at least $ 2,000 a month if you are dedicated and treat my The Complete Associated Content Guide To Making $2000+ a Month like a real business plan, and work it like a real business day in and day out.
