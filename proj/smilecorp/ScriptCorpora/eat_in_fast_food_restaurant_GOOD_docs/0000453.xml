 June 1, 2012 Really likes it good stuff by gm ( 13 reviews ) burgers are great. meat have flavor, they just dont pile on the condiments. i like the blue cheese burger and the BIG hot dog. the hot dog surprised me. TRY THE BIG HOT DOG June 28, 2012 Likes it Great Burger by Lisa ( 2 reviews ) Lucy&apos;s has a new look and new owners - the food is awesome - and the homemade ice cream is amazing!!!! Everyone there is very friendly - how nice to have great food, great prices and friendly service! June 30, 2012 Likes it Pretty good, but pricey by JB ( 1 review ) Let&apos;s break this down into the atmosphere and the actual facilities, the service, the food, and then the overall opinion. The Restaurant Itself Lucy&apos;s is very typically Abilene, TX. Small city, everybody knows everybody sort of feel. There&apos;s plaques, photos, posters, and memorabilia all around that are mostly local bits of history and activities. The restaurant is clean, but the tables, lighting, and floor leave something wanting. There are no booths, and the chairs could be better. The overall decoration is sparse, and the restaurant can feel cramped at times. But, the overall cleanliness is what surprised me. The Service While our waitress was extremely nice, service was quite slow. It took a while for her to get us our drinks, and then longer to get our order even though we were ready when she had brought us the drinks. Everything is made fresh so I can understand food coming out in a less than timely manner, but the soft drinks were just fountain drinks so that bit... more» Let&apos;s break this down into the atmosphere and the actual facilities, the service, the food, and then the overall opinion.

The Service While our waitress was extremely nice, service was quite slow. It took a while for her to get us our drinks, and then longer to get our order even though we were ready when she had brought us the drinks. Everything is made fresh so I can understand food coming out in a less than timely manner, but the soft drinks were just fountain drinks so that bit was frustrating. Other than that, she made accommodations for us and was very sweet. The Food Drink sizes are very generous, a very large cup and (if memory serves correctly) free refills. If you even finish the first glass. The food is limited to burgers, hot dogs, chicken, and desserts. Luckily, for someone like me who enjoys local food but is a vegetarian in a very not-vegetarian-friendly town, they have a portobello mushroom burger. My boyfriend got a chili-cheese hot dog, and my mother got a bleu cheese burger. The burgers are served on a sort of focaccia bun, and tend to come in generous portions with fries. They advertise their jalapeno ketchup and peanut butter ice cream, as well, so we also tried that. My burger, the mushroom burger, was delicious. It was tender and the richness of the mushroom was softened by the bun and condiments. The jalapeno ketchup is good for those who don&apos;t care for spice, but like the taste of jalapenos anyway. I was a little disappointed, as I love spice. It doesn&apos;t mean the ketchup is bad, it&apos;s actually quite good, I just missed that kick. My mother said she enjoyed her burger, but if she really wanted a good bleu cheese burger, she would just go to Chili&apos;s. It wasn&apos;t much of anything to her, just another burger. My boyfriend said the chili-cheese dog was good, but, overall, mediocre. Nothing special. The homemade peanut butter ice cream was something the staff talked up but when we went in and ordered it, they said they didn&apos;t have any. I sat there flabberghasted and essentially said,&quot;It&apos;s one of your most advertised menu items and it&apos;s one of the reasons we came to eat here. Do you seriously not make it in bulk?&quot;The waitress said she would go check and see if the ice cream was being made or if it was ready. She was able to bring us the ice cream, granted it had not quite finished churning. The presentation was unimpressive. Small cup, small scoop. BUT, the actual ice cream fully made up for that. The flavor was exquisite and I loved it. It was smooth, creamy, and it was hard to not gobble it up. My mother also tried it and agreed. So good. But I was REALLY disappointed to learn that all it is is vanilla ice cream with name-brand peanut butter mixed in. I would have been more excited about it if it had been homemade peanut butter (not hard to make) put into homemade ice cream. But now comes the not so great part. $41. For three people and a tiny cup of ice cream. My burger was the only one that I believed should have been so pricey. But for a mediocre bleu cheese burger and chili-cheese dog? And a tiny cup of ice cream? Ridiculous. I know times are tough, but the reason why I love my local restaurants is because they tend to be generous with their portions and easy on your wallet. Not in this case. Would I eat there again? If I happened to have a special occasion and if I&apos;m not the one footing the entire bill. Do I recommend it to others? Yeah, sure, try it, but frankly if you just want a good, ol&apos; fashioned, local burger, go eat at Larry&apos;s Better Burger (I love all of their sides, they have a wider selection of food, and it is truly a local, family owned business), or try Rick and Carolyn&apos;s (they often have a $1 burger night). Now, if they changed their prices, then I can totally justify letting Lucy&apos;s take over as my new favorite burger joint. Otherwise? Kind of meh. PROS: Friendly service, vegetarian options, generous portions, clean facilities, great ice cream CONS: Slow service, too expensive, mediocre food with a few exceptions,&quot;homemade&quot;is only partially true, limited food options March 23, 2012 Likes it Great burger&amp;ice cream by Mac Murry ( 28 reviews ) We ordered two #1 The Lucy burgers--they were as good as any local hamburger I&apos;ve eaten. We finished our meal with Lucy&apos;s homemade peanut butter ice cream--a heavenly cup of yummy deliciousness. Friendly service. Overall, an enthusiastic thumbs up for Lucy&apos;s. June 29, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it Meh... by Food Truck Speed Bump ( 14 reviews ) Buns were great, hockey puck inside....not so much. I think they depend on the mustard to carry the flavor. The burger was swimming in it... so were the menus, table, salt shaker - if you love yellow mustard HERE IS YOUR PLACE. Let the beef speek for itself and accent it with the condiments!!!! The fries...greasy and flabby - is it that had to fry em untill they are crispy??? A little pricey for the quality. 2 out of 2 found this review helpful May 12, 2011 Likes it AWESOME!! by Gail ( 1 review ) Lucy&apos;s is AWESOME...food...prices...staff..cleanliness, etc. It&apos;s very disheartening to read some of the comments on here...Lucy&apos;s is very clean...staff is very friendly...food is awesome.....and the prices are great!! If you want a&quot;fast food&quot;burger...then go to a&quot;fast food&quot;restaurant and get one that has been sitting under a warmer for awhile....I like to go to Lucy&apos;s because I know my burger is being prepared fresh for me...I don&apos;t mind it taking more than 2 minutes! The place is very clean...if you want to make comments that are helpful to others...be honest...seems to me others are just trying to bash Lucy&apos;s for whatever reason....so, if you want an honest opinion...Lucy&apos;s is all around AWESOME...if you want an 8th grade jealous opinion...go with the others! 2 out of 3 found this review helpful June 20, 2011 Likes it Mobile review by Plaineater ( 82 reviews ) Very good hamburger, excellent bun. We had great service. The #1, Lucy, is large. The Swiss mushroom is excellent. There is one chicken sandwich on the menu&amp;a couple of hot dogs. Home-made ice cream. A couple of smaller burgers. All burgers, etc, come with genuine home cut fries. Good. September 28, 2011 Likes it Gail by sbell ( 1 review ) Lucy&apos;s uses 100% pure beef, fresh never frozen. No fillers or additives used. If your going to make a comment,make sure your facts are correct.FYI, reviews include BOTH locations. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful August 29, 2010 Likes it Clean Restaurant, Good Burgers and Fantastic Ice Cream by bigrod ( 59 reviews ) Lucy&apos;s has got to be the cleanest restaurant I&apos;ve EVER been in. It was nice to see that the young ladies who worked there were dedicated not only to their customers, but to keeping Lucy&apos;s clean. All too often young people could care less, kudos to them. Now to the food...good hamburgers, the buns are amazing. It&apos;s great to find a burger joint that still serves home style fries. The jalapeno ketchup is really good. Their ice cream is simply AMAZING - we weren&apos;t going to try it but were talked into it by our server. I am so glad that she convinced us to do so, I would go back just for the ice cream! Overall we had a very nice dining experience. May 6, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!! by JustJoe ( 1 review ) Today I went to Lucy&apos;s as people think this is&quot;hands down&quot;the best burger in town. When I got there, NO ONE acknowledged that I was even there. There was a four top tables open (lunch time) and the waitress bypassed me like I wasn&apos;t even there, seated the next 3 behind me. I was with 3 other people so the 4 top would&apos;ve fit perfectly. I told the waitress that she ignored me and sat the people down behind me.....her response was a very un-sincere&quot;sorry&quot;and moved on. We waited for 20 minutes for another table to open and we stat ourselves since the lady was really not concerened with seating us. We sat and waited for almost another ten minutes before we asked the waitress if she was able to wait on us. She seemed very rude and asked us what we wanted. We got our drinks a while after and went on her way. Our food took about 15 minutes to show up and the buns were cold, meat wasn&apos;t that good and fries were soggy. All in all, Glorias and Hef&apos;s is WAY better than this place. I for one will never be going back to (sarcasm here) this&quot;best place ever&quot;(sarcasm off). IT SUCKS! 2 out of 4 found this review helpful August 19, 2011 Likes it Best Burgers by JohnnyBoY ( 2 reviews ) Love Lucys and Heffs!!! I would reccomend both, but Lucys edges them out by a hair!!! 1 out of 1 found this review helpful August 25, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it Terrible by Lisa ( 1 review ) went there with 2 other people and none of us could eat it. The meat was white inside because of so much filler. Fries were good and homemade icecream was good. Won&apos;t go back for a burger. 1 out of 2 found this review helpful August 9, 2011 # 1 in Abilene by meateater ( 1 review ) Lucy&apos;s is the best burger in Abilene, not much better than Heff&apos;s. I&apos;m about to go to Lucy&apos;s tonight even though Heff&apos;s is 15 miles closer. The bun is what makes the difference. And yes, the people there are a little indifferent (esp the old guy that takes your money) I get it to go. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful July 14, 2011 Mobile review by David Jones ( 1 review ) There are some astoundingly stupid comments about Lucy&apos;s. They provide a very excellant meal at a fair price and if you don&apos;t like their burgers then stop smoking, get your taste buds in proper working order and try again! Personally I like Glorias and Lucys. I own a small small service oriented business and know how difficult it is to please everybody. If you don&apos;t have the ability or givacrapidness to start your own,.. then you really have no right to accuratley complain!! 1 out of 2 found this review helpful April 29, 2010 Likes it Mobile review by C-Roy ( 12 reviews ) It just might be the best burger I&apos;ve ever eaten. Well worth the drive to Tuscola. I&apos;m hooked! September 20, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it Old or New?? by Rhonda Davison ( 6 reviews ) What I want to say is that the&quot;Rave&quot;reviews are from the old location-not new--- November 12, 2011 Likes it Yummy! by Hungry Hungry Hippo ( 2 reviews ) Loved Lucy&apos;s and the HUGE burger! I should have kept reading the menu and ordered the Lu though; I was stuffed about half way through the burger. But don&apos;t worry, I brought it home and it ate it the next day for lunch! And thank you Lucy&apos;s for the military discount! This military family will be back! May 13, 2011 Likes it delicious! by localyokel ( 12 reviews ) Just started eating burgers again after a hiatus of many years -- so now working my way through the local scene. Here, I love the Lucy burger and the Blue Cheese burger! The fries are not quite crispy enough for me - but not a big deal, they&apos;re just a sideline to what&apos;s on the buns! Just wish they were open later -- went by tonight to find they were closed at 8 pm on a Friday.
