 Dealing with Life’s Storms 
 Posted on July 5, 2012 by admin Leave a comment 
I talked with a woman recently who is in a struggling marriage. She loves her husband and prays for reconciliation. However, he doesn’t know if, after 28 years of marriage, he wants to be in the marriage or not. Her heart aches for her own possible loss as well as for the hearts of her children and grandchildren.

So she waits. And hopes for healing. And draws close to God, relying on Him to guide her steps, guard her heart, and meet her family’s needs.

A dear friend is battling a disease that has attacked her body repeatedly. Treatment after treatment has taken a toll, leaving her weary and worn.

So she waits. And hopes for healing. And draws close to God, relying on Him to guide her steps, guard her heart from the discouragement and fears that can easily take hold, and meet her needs.

A young adult man I’ve known for many years lost his job and had to move back in with his parents. The job market for someone with his skills is tough right now and his situation is complicated by an illness that zaps him from time to time. Financial pressures are mounting. Depression and discouragement tug at his mind each day, making it more and more difficult to find the optimism needed to present himself positively as he searches for a job and battles his disease.

So he waits. And hopes for healing. And draws close to God, relying on Him to guide his steps, guard his heart, and meet his needs.

Recently we watched wildfires and storms cause devastation to families, businesses, and communities in several areas of our country. My husband and I dealt with the destruction of a hurricane and a flood. So, I remember the initial shock I experienced at the damage done, then the relief that my family was safe and things were not worse, followed by the grief and fatigue that set in as the slow, tedious, and costly recovery process took place.

So my prayer support goes out to those who are now facing their own fire and storm recovery as they wait. And as they hope for healing in their own lives and in their communities. If you are one of the many families who are now experiencing this devastation, I pray that you will draw close to God and rely on Him to guide your steps, guard your hearts, and meet your needs.

The stories of struggle go on and on for so many. You hear them as I do. You and your children experience them at times in your lives as I do. While the pictures may look different, there are common threads weaving through them. Life is hard at times and not always fair. Tragedy happens and suffering comes.

How comforting to know that in the midst of life’s storms, God is there to lift us up, wrap us in His cloak of love, and meet our needs.

There’s a familiar scripture passage that’s part of a collection of songs—songs of sorrow, songs of despair, and songs of joy. It is the 23 rd chapter of the book of Psalms. If you or your children are in the midst of a life storm, let these words encourage you as you wait, as you hope, and as you draw close to God.

 God, my shepherd! I don’t need a thing. 

 You have bedded me down in lush meadows, 

 You find me quiet pools to drink from. 

 True to your word, 

 You let me catch my breath 

 and send me in the right direction. 

 

 Even when the way goes through Death Valley, 

 I’m not afraid when you walk at my side. 

 Your trusty shepherd’s crook 

 makes me feel secure. 

 

 You serve me a six-course dinner 

 right in front of my enemies. 

 You revive my drooping head; 

 My cup brims with blessing. 

 

 Your beauty and love chase after me 

 every day of my life. 

 I’m back home in the house of God 

 for the rest of my life. 

(Taken from The Message by Eugene Peterson)

 Heads Up, Dads—and Grandfathers, Too! 
 Posted on June 13, 2012 by admin Leave a comment 
This coming Sunday we’ll take time to honor fathers and grandfathers: men who have the privilege and responsibility of providing for, educating, protecting, guiding, challenging, and encouraging children.

As a mother of two sons, I know the importance of encouraging my husband and supporting him in his role as father. Now I’m seeing that role with fresh eyes as my son has stepped into this role and my husband is now both father and grandfather.

I shared words of encouragement and challenge with fathers recently, thinking about the role they have in the lives of their children as they are growing up. Looking back over those thoughts, I recognize the tips are applicable to dads of adult children and to grandfathers as well.

Children from infants to adults are bombarded with countless influences and need to know where to turn for sound guidance. Who will lead them down the right path? Who will be there to walk along side and offer a hand when they need help? Who will caution them if they stray off course? Who will love them unconditionally, reflecting the same love God has for us as his children?

Fathers can play that important role in the lives of children, and grandfathers have a unique role as another significant male influence.

Our father-child relationship has a powerful impact on our other relationships and on our own development. Our connection with the world around us, our self-esteem, and our ability to cope with the challenges of life are impacted by that relationship. Even our vision of God as our Heavenly Father is influenced by the relationship we have with our earthly Father.

Dads, here are a few tips to encourage a strong connection between you and your children, perhaps your grandchildren as well. Consider how you can foster a positive relationship with them physically, emotionally, and spiritually, no matter what their age.

• Spend one-on-one time with each of your children and grandchildren. You can do so in person, on the phone, through email, or perhaps via Skype. That one-on-one attention is important.

• Show interest in and respect for what’s important to them.

• Encourage them to share their experiences, discoveries, concerns, successes, even their failures, not just their grades or job descriptions. Listen with a desire to understand. Acknowledge their thoughts with compassion. If the door is open, give direction rather than mere judgment. Express concerns respectfully.

• Find an activity they express interest in and join them. Let the emphasis be on having fun.

• Let them work along side you in the garage, around the house, with the car. Teach them what they’ll need to know as they take on those adult responsibilities. Be open to learning from your adult children. Ask their advice.

• Look for opportunities to share your principles, values, and wisdom gained from your life experiences—without lecturing. Ask the Lord to help you teach these by example.

• Share meals at the table.

• Recognize the power of the first and last thoughts you express in your time together. Rather than criticism or punishment, let your first and last words that linger in their minds be positive affirmation.

• Hug your children.

• Be available when they need you.

• Tell them about God’s love for them and his desires for their lives. Pray with them and for them.

• Tell them you love them. Then show them you mean it in ways they’ll understand.

Heads up, dads and grandfathers. Amidst the busyness of your own life, give your children and grandchildren the gift of your active, caring presence. It’s a priceless expression of God’s love through you.

 A word to moms and grandmothers : Ask God to help you be the best support to your husband and son/son-in-law as they fill the role God has given them. If there is not a father or grandfather actively present in your children’s/grandchildren’s lives in a healthy, loving way, pray that God will bring other men along side them—teachers, church leaders, family members, neighbors, friends—who will be a positive influence in their lives.

 Supporting Our Children in the Military 
 Posted on May 30, 2012 by admin Leave a comment 
 Earlier this week, our country paused to pay tribute to the men and women who have committed their lives to protect and defend us.

If you are the parent of a young man or woman now serving in the military or someone who has recently been discharged from active duty, you have some unique challenges and also some great opportunities to show your love and support.

As I was writing my book, I talked with Sara Horn, wife of a Navy reservist and founder of Wives of Faith, about the challenges unique to families of those in the military. I asked her to comment about the varying perspectives of parents and spouses of those serving. Here are her comments that were included in my chapter for parents with special challenges:

There has always been an interesting dynamic between the mother of a soldier and the wife of a soldier. Since I interact mainly with the wives of soldiers, I have heard countless stories of the “crazy” mother-in-law—the one who seems to cry more than the spouse at the mere mention of a deployment. Or the one who insists on the soldier coming home to her house for R&amp;R instead of to his wife and their home. Or the one who doesn’t connect or stay in touch at all with the spouse or even the service member while he/she serves overseas.

Parents and spouses have different perspectives when it comes to their loved one serving in uniform. Both love, but the parent also wants to protect; the spouse wants to support.

I asked Sara to advise parents who want to be the best support to their children in the military and to the spouses and families of those serving. Her comments are directed toward parents who have a son serving but she shares the same advice with those who have a daughter in the military:

First, recognize the important service your son is performing for his country and be proud of him. Whether or not you agree with his decision to join the military (especially if you don’t agree with the current wars), your child has made a decision to serve the greater good and do something that makes a difference for others.

When it comes to supporting the spouse of your soldier, be sensitive to her needs as well as emotions. Deployment is an incredibly emotional thing and it can be hard to gauge sometimes what everyone wants or needs. Don’t be afraid to ask your daughter-in-law what she needs from you. Is it help with the grandkids? A listening ear? Prayer?

Don’t go to your soldier son’s wife and complain about his military service, or express your serious fears about him being overseas. You need another friend to talk to about these issues; your daughter-in-law has enough fear and stress of her own, and it is a difficult role to live as the wife versus the mom. For the wife, it isn’t just about the heartstrings—she is living it on a daily basis as she keeps her home going, her kids going, and encourages her husband while he’s away.

Do offer your daughter-in-law and grandchildren your full support and let them know you’re available to help them as they need it. Give specifics of how you can help. For example, if you live close enough, volunteer to have a Grammy night once a week so your daughter-in-law can have a little break. Or make plans to visit as often as you’re able and show your support in tangible ways.

Do give your daughter-in-law the “right-of-way” when it comes to any decisions regarding the deployment—departure, R&amp;R, homecoming. Honor Ephesians 5:31 and recognize your son is now the head of his own household. Let them know if you’d like to be part of the departure or homecoming festivities but be sensitive to what they may be feeling. Don’t demand—request. Respect your adult child and his spouse’s wishes if they just want themselves and children to be together before/after he leaves or comes back.

Be a blessing to your grandchildren. Offer them encouragement and tell them often how proud you are of them and what they’re accomplishing while their parent is gone.

You’ll find these comments from Sara along with additional tips from a mom whose son is serving in the Marines in Chapter 8 of my book, Secrets to Parenting Your Adult Child .

 When a Relationship Ends 
 Posted on May 2, 2012 by admin Leave a comment 
When we held our little ones in our arms, we dreamed about how we wanted their futures to unfold as we prayed for God’s guidance and protection. We tried to do our best to raise them to be healthy, safe, secure, happy adults, and we encouraged them to seek out loving, healthy relationships with others. Perhaps as we read stories and fairy tales to them, we hoped their own relationships would also live “happily ever after.”

And yet, we knew they would face difficulties along their life journey, trials that would bring pain and loss. This is especially tough when it involves their relationships. We’re hopeful our children’s friendships and marriages will last throughout their lifetimes. But sometimes those relationships end in death or divorce.

Dreams are shattered and hearts are broken—theirs and ours as well. We don’t want them to struggle. Yet we know they must ultimately travel the journey of grief and recovery on their own.

If you are facing this kind of trial in the life of your family, perhaps these tips will bring encouragement as you love and support your adult child. The insight comes from my own personal journey as a parent, as well as the experiences of friends and clients whose children have experienced the loss of a loved one through death or divorce.

 • Be available and willing to listen when they want to talk, without feeling the need to “fix” things for them. Recognize the power of your presence, even in the quiet times.

 • Express your confidence in their ability to work through their grief. Say, “I know with God’s help you’ll get through this time.”

 • Offer your assistance, “Let me know how I can support you through this.” Leave the door open but don’t pressure them to involve you.

 • Be careful and respectful in your conversations. Remember: their decisions are ultimately theirs to make and to work through. Don’t compound their grief and adjustments with your negative comments and criticism. Be ready to offer guidance if they ask while also recognizing they may or may not heed your advice. Don’t pressure them to respond as you direct, unless something like their safety is at risk.

 • Recognize that you have your own grief to work through as you let go of dreams and expectations you had, and as you let go of the person your child brought into your life. Find safe, healthy ways to process your feelings. Seek out confidential, caring people to help you deal with your own concerns so your grief doesn’t complicate your child’s situation.

 • If you have grandchildren, be careful to manage your emotions so that you can be in a healthy position to offer them your support, attention, stability, and assurance that you are there for them. Watch how you answer their questions and don’t criticize their parents. Express your concerns if they ask but don’t elaborate on your own feelings.

 • If your children remarry, help everyone adjust to their new blended family. Support everyone by welcoming new step-family members that may come along.

 • Let your children know you are praying for them. Assure them of God’s presence, his love, his protection, and his provision as they cope with their losses and move on with their lives. If your children are receptive, share some verses from God’s word that offer comfort and encouragement.

Above all: may we remember (and remind our children) God has been present throughout the ups and downs of our lives. He is with us on this journey as well, ready to heal our hurts and fill our hearts with his grace, his forgiveness, his compassion, and his love.

 A New Season Arrives on Wings of Hope 
 Posted on April 4, 2012 by admin Leave a comment 
 Some weeks are filled with ordinary days. Days when we follow familiar routines. Days that seem to come and go without particular notice.

While I have my ordinary days, just as you do, this time of the year also brings some special occasions. Days to celebrate and days to reflect.

This past month my family celebrated my little granddaughter’s second birthday and the precious blessings of love, joy, and hope God gives us through her.

Later in March, we all opened our doors to spring. A season of new beginnings. A time to clean out the dust and clear away the clutter of days passed to make room for the changes in store. It’s a time to plan and plant, then wait in anticipation of what’s to come. It’s a time of hope .

A few days ago I celebrated another birthday. How old? Well, let’s just say my granddaughter can’t count quite that high. Actually, this is a good time in my life. I’m taking opportunities to reflect back on the blessings that have been a part of my past and am looking forward to new memories yet to come. While I’d like to avoid any more gray hair or aching joints, I do want to see what God has in store for me in the days ahead. For me, it’s a time of hope .

While this past month brought some times of celebration, it also brought some challenges for my family. Disappointments to face. Losses to grieve. Dreams and plans to set aside. Questions without answers, and uncertainties for the future.

As a parent, it is always difficult to see my children deal with life’s struggles. I want to “fix it” for them and shield them from the arrows of pain and disappointment. Yet I know that often times we learn life’s greatest lessons through life’s most difficult challenges.

And those tough times can strengthen our faith and allow us to see God at work, guiding, sustaining, providing, preparing, and drawing us closer to Him. So, I find myself standing beside them as we work through the changes and wonder what the future will hold.

As this Easter season unfolds, I’ve found myself reflecting on how Jesus’ followers dealt with such a time in their lives. They had spent three years believing they were on a journey toward deliverance and that Jesus was, indeed, the Messiah they had been waiting for.

They sat at the feet of their teacher as He opened the eyes of their heart to a deeper understanding of God. They stood by His side, ministering to others and they shared their hearts with Him as they broke bread together. The future looked full of promise.

Then, suddenly, their dreams shattered and their joyful hearts flooded with fear, grief, and hopelessness as they watched their Messiah taken from them, crucified and then buried in a tomb.

The next day for them was the Sabbath, a day of worship. What a challenge to draw close to God in worship and obedience in the midst of what seemed like profound loss and future uncertainty.

Yet, He carried them through that Sabbath into a new day and showed them that what felt like an ending was a vital part of His ultimate plan for their lives—and for ours. Once again, God’s songs of love filled their hearts with hope as they met their risen Savior—God’s promise fulfilled.

Easter is a season of joyful celebration and a time of hope . For us and for our children. A reminder that when we experience losses, when the road ahead looks uncertain and we don’t have a map at hand to guide us, when life seems to be at a standstill and things aren’t moving as we think they should, we need to hold on, press through the darkness, draw close to God in the silence, wait on Him, listen for His voice, remember His promises, celebrate His love, and then watch as He leads us into the promise of a new day.

May the hope of Easter fill your heart and home.

 A New Season Calls for Pruning 
 Posted on March 21, 2012 by admin Leave a comment 
 In my garden . . . 

Pruning the plants: I’ve been told it’s an important step toward ushering in the spring season. My husband, the family gardener, has explained the significance of this annual process. Approaching the plants with sharpened clippers, he carefully examines each one to determine its state of health and potential for growth. Which branches should remain and which ones have fulfilled their purpose and now need to be trimmed back. Then he proceeds to cut. Oh, it’s not just a little nip here and a tuck there. He cuts, and cuts, and cuts again.

I tolerantly stand by and observe this ritual, trying to be supportive of his dedication to grooming our yard and providing such beautiful blooms throughout the spring and summer. I have a difficult time when he’s pruning the plants, however, even though I’m certain he means well.

Knowing my struggle, he patiently tolerates my complaints that he may be too aggressive with those clippers as he explains the purpose of this procedure once again. I just know what I see. There before me are plants that once were tall, mature-looking, well-formed specimens. Having demonstrated their productive capabilities, they’ve now been stripped of their tender limbs right down to the main arteries that give them life and hope for the future. Once prolific branches are set aside with the promise that new life will soon emerge.

There we stand, side by side, my husband with a sense of accomplishment and me with a sense of bewilderment. Then we wait.

Now, my husband knows patience doesn’t always come easily for me and letting go can be difficult at times. So, with all the empathy he can muster, he gently turns my attention from a past loss to a future possibility. We begin to talk about the potential for these plants and recall past pruning that provided us with beautiful, fragrant flowers.

Reality also reminds us it will take time, patience, and attention to details. We’ll need to fertilize, water, and pay attention to how the sun will greet the plants each day. We must watch for any unexpected last minute dips in the thermometer and protect tender new growth from the March winds. My role is to do what I can, to trust my gardener, and to wait for the results to come.

 In my life . . . 

While I wait for new buds on the bushes in my yard I’m also experiencing a time of pruning in my life. Perhaps you are as well. Now that my children are grown, God has been pruning away activities, demands, roles, and responsibilities that channeled my time, attention, energy, and resources while my sons were growing up.

Some of His trimming process has been welcomed, but I must admit I’ve struggled as He cuts away things in my life that I enjoyed for so long. Roles and opportunities I savored as a mom of two young boys. I know seasons begin and end in our lives and I know that those changes involve letting go, sometimes with sadness and other times with joy. And yet, knowing that principle doesn’t always make the process easy, does it?

 What’s next? 

I’m watching to see what will emerge in my garden as this new spring season unfolds, trusting that my husband’s pruning efforts will bring forth new growth and new blooms to enjoy. And I’m watching and wondering as pruning and preparation take place for whatever God has planned for my life in the days ahead. Trusting that He is at work in ways I can’t see or may not understand, and that His pruning, painful as it sometimes can be, will bring about new growth, new joy, and new blessings.

If you, too, are experiencing a time of pruning and preparation in your life for what is to come, then my friends, consider God’s promises, follow His direction, and find hope in His faithfulness as you wait on Him. Know that He has great things in store for this new season of your life.

 Be encouraged!

 Bring Your Children Before the Lord 
 Posted on March 7, 2012 by admin Leave a comment 
It’s important to pray for our children.

Of course, as parents we know that to be a part of our calling. We ask God to guide and direct their steps. To be with them in all they do. To love and protect them. To draw them close to Him.

As we watch them deal with adult issues in a challenging world, our prayers are the most important means of support we can give them. I’ve written about this before and know the principle to be true. Yet, my sons are going through some tough challenges in their lives right now and I’m spending more time talking with God about those trials and struggles as I seek His direction and protection for their lives.

Once again, I’ve gone back to a book that has been a source of personal encouragement and a reference for my own writing. In her book The Power of Praying for Your Adult Children, author Stormie Omartian gives specific ways we can pray for our children. I want to share her chapter titles with you because they suggest that as we bring our children before the Lord, we can pray that they will:

• See God pour out His Spirit upon them

• Develop a heart for God, His Word, and His ways

• Grow in wisdom, discernment, and revelation

• Find freedom, restoration, and wholeness

• Understand God’s purposes for their lives

• Work successfully and have financial stability

• Have a sound mind and a right attitude

• Resist evil influences and destructive behavior

• Avoid all sexual pollution and temptation

• Experience good health and God’s healing

• Enjoy a successful marriage and raise godly children

• Maintain strong and fulfilling relationships

• Be protected and survive tough times

• Walk into the future God has for them

As we consider these desires for our children’s lives, let’s ask God to show us areas where they may be struggling so we can pray more specifically for them. Sometimes our children will share their challenges. Other times, they may not do so. And yet, God will quicken our hearts if we are listening to Him and will prompt our conversations with Him as we bring our children before Him in our prayers.

I find that the more I release my concerns and fears to the Lord, the more I am then able to envision His power, grace, mercy, and love at work in my children’s lives. And as I celebrate the positive things that are happing with prayers of thanksgiving, my trust and my hope are strengthened as I anticipate how God will continue to care for them.

A passage from the Bible that speaks to me clearly right now with both challenge and comfort as I support my sons through their present challenges is found in Philippians 4:6-9.

 Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things. Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me—put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you. 

May God guide our minds and hearts as we seek to parent our adult children in a way that honors Him, supports them, strengthens our family ties, and draws us all closer to Him.

 You can read more about this gift and responsibility in Chapter 7 of Secrets to Parenting Your Adult Child (Bethany House, 2011)—“Bring Your Children Before the Lord.”

 All We Can Do Is All We Can Do 
 Posted on February 22, 2012 by admin Leave a comment 
 “I am only one, but I am one. I cannot do everything, but I can do something. And I will not let what I cannot do interfere with what I can do.” 

Edward Everett Hale, author

I came across this quote as I was writing to parents about managing special challenges. It was at a time in my life when I, too, was experiencing the limitations that sometimes come for us as parents when we see our children in need and recognize life for them, and for us, may not be as we planned.

I looked around and found friends, colleagues, and clients who were in a similar position, trying to discern how to respond as parents of adult children with special challenges and needs.

When our children were little, we dreamed that life for them would be filled with joy and wonder. We envisioned sharing exciting experiences with them as they grew into happy, healthy and well-adjusted adults.

Then, as I share in my book , “We carefully tucked our dreams and wishes into a nice, neat little box called the future, which we tied with a ribbon of hope. We set our box on the shelf of expectation and began our parenting journey, confident all would go according to plan.” 

In the life of my family, perhaps in yours as well, some of those plans did unfold as we envisioned. But, we also know life sometimes takes unexpected twists and turns. Our lives and those of our children don’t always follow those wishes and dreams we so carefully tucked away.

Some challenges and changes are met with joy and excitement while others bring shock, disappointment, heartbreak and pain.

• A child who becomes a single parent.

• One who struggles with an addiction or a mental health disorder.

• A child born with a disability.

• One who suffers with a chronic or acute illness or injury.

• A child who must serve time in prison.

• A child who loses his/her own son or daughter.

Recently, I spent time with a woman whose son stepped into his young adult years, full of joy and hope. A life filled with promise was suddenly shattered by a tragic choice. Plans and expectations for him shifted from those of an athletic and academic star to a man now serving an 18-year prison term.

I also met a woman whose young adult daughter experienced a near-fatal accident that left her permanently disabled.

Both mothers shared how God has been leading them through a journey of grief as their families come to terms with a major life shift. They have had to set aside yesterday’s dreams and are now learning to create a “new normal” for today as they cling to promises of God’s faithfulness for their tomorrows.

When our adult children face challenges, particularly painful life-changing ones, we want to do all we can to help them cope. As we come to terms with the impact on both their lives and our own, and as we seek understanding and direction from God, we must recognize the scope and limitations of our assistance, “All I can do is all I can do. So, with God’s help, I’ll do my best to love and support my child in whatever ways possible.”

 “It may mean we have to unpack the box of dreams and plans we formed in our minds and hearts when they were young. We can take out whatever dreams no longer fit, add new hopes and plans, and bind it together with new expectations and the promises of God’s love and provision.” 

Whatever challenges and life shifts come along in our lives and those of our children, let’s hold on tightly to God’s promise to guide our steps and to help us be the parents He has called us to be.

 For more insight and encouragement on managing special challenges, refer to Chapter 8 in Secrets to Parenting Your Adult Child (Bethany House, 2011).

 Taking Out Our Emotional Trash 
 Posted on February 8, 2012 by admin Leave a comment 
 We’re off and running toward what I hope will be a great year for all of us—a year to be healthy physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Healthy eating plans, exercise equipment or gym memberships, time management programs, organizational tips, and study guides offer us tools to promote healthier living.

As we clean out our closets, cook healthier meals, exercise, and organize, we also know we need to make certain our minds and hearts are ready for the experiences ahead. We may have tucked away special keepsakes and fond memories from the past, but we may also be holding onto negative things in our lives that we need to discard, clutter that’s been weighing us down.

 Emotional trash. 

Hurts, disappointments, resentments and even fears from the past may be tucked away in our minds and hearts, impacting the relationships we’re building with our children now that they’re grown. If we struggled with problems as they were growing up, particularly during their teenage years, we might be holding onto some residual negative feelings of which we may or may not be aware.

Psychologist and author Georgia Shaffer cautions us, “Even the best intentions to eat well and exercise can be sabotaged by last year’s emotional trash. Emotional trash is any negative thoughts, feelings and attitudes such as petty grudges, long-held resentments, or destructive guilt. If not dealt with and removed, our emotional trash creates many problems in our lives and relationships. In fact, experts say avoiding, hiding, or soothing our feelings with food (emotional eating) is the main reason we fail to stick to our diets.”

In her book, Taking Out Your Emotional Trash: Face Your Feelings and Build Healthy Relationships (Harvest House, 2010), Georgia makes the point that while your emotional trash might be different from mine, the truth is we all have it.

Here are some questions Georgia challenges us to ask as we consider any emotional trash we might be carrying into this new year, particularly from past struggles and strains in family relationships.

• What am I ignoring that is weighing me down? Hurtful comments? Disappointment in your own actions as a parent? Discouragement or frustrations in the choices made by others? Choosing to ignore or hide these hurts, disappointments, or shame allows them to pile up and create more pain; you may find yourself doing unhealthy things to soothe your emotions.

 • What have I grown use to that is weighing me down? It’s a subtle, gradual process where one day we’re aware we’re holding onto a grudge but then slowly over time this resentment becomes so much a part of us that we don’t even know it’s there.  Like living near a fast food restaurant, at first you’re aware of all the smells but after awhile you don’t even know they exist.

 • What am I blinded to that is weighing me down? I would like to think we can be objective in our evaluation of life, however we all do have blind spots and are sometimes unable to see things as they really are.

I want to experience this new year without any emotional baggage, and I’m asking God to help me face any negative emotions and release them in healthy ways so I can move forward with a clean mind and heart. Forgiveness—for myself and for others—is part of that healing journey.

It’s not always easy to let go of hurts and pain, but I’ve found that steps like prayer, personal reflection through journaling, and talking to a trusted friend, pastor, or counselor can help identify and release negative emotions carried from the past. I want my relationships to be the best they can be so I’m ready for God to create in me a clean heart and renew a right spirit.

 So, what about you? 

As you consider your family relationships, take the steps you need to dump any emotional trash that might be interfering. Free yourself from whatever weighs you down—physically, emotionally, even spiritually—so you can experience all God has in store for you in the days ahead.

 What If We Don’t Approve? 
 Posted on February 1, 2012 by admin Leave a comment 
 Nancy, I’m worried about my daughter. She met a guy a few months ago, says she’s in love, and is already planning a wedding. I think it’s too soon. Aside from the timing, my husband and I have some real concerns about her choice in a mate. They come from very different backgrounds and seem to have some significant differences in beliefs. 

 We’ve just met him a couple of times and he seems nice, but we sense he is pushing a bit. She seems caught up in the romance and when I ask questions, she just tells me they’re in love and everything is going to be fine. I want to talk to her and share our concerns, but I don’t want her to get mad and pull away from us. I don’t want to cause problems but things are moving so fast. What can I do? 

My friend’s concerns echo the fears I’ve heard from other parents who are concerned about their adult children’s marriage plans. We may be concerned about their choice in a mate, the timing of their marriage, or perhaps adjustment challenges we may foresee as they begin life as husband and wife.

I’ve counseled parents who struggled when their children opted to marry someone of a different culture, background, or faith. Some have watched with concern, perhaps even fear, as their children compromise values and beliefs. Others have had to come to terms with their child’s choice to share life with a live-in partner without marrying.

When our children make choices that concern us, we may struggle through shock, confusion, disagreement, disappointment, hurt, even feelings of failure and shame as we try to find a place of acceptance. We know—in theory—our children are adults and will make up their own minds about their beliefs and choices. And they have to deal with the consequences of those choices.

Still, it’s hard when we as parents believe they are making choices that may bring about some difficulties; when they make decisions about a life partner that clash with the values and beliefs we tried to instill in them as young children.

We don’t want to seem controlling; we don’t want to slam the door on our relationship with them either. So, what can we do if we find ourselves in this place?

Perhaps the place to start is to ask ourselves if we’re upset because they’re not making the choice we want them to or if they are stepping into problem areas that could be harmful or difficult as they try to build a marriage. Sometimes, we need to accept they have different opinions and desires; that they are in charge of their choices and the consequences that result. We may need to keep our preferences to ourselves unless asked.

If we do have concerns we feel we must share, particularly in the areas of physical, emotional or financial safety or well-being, we need to ask God’s guidance in determining if, when, and how to talk with our children. There are situations when we do need to step in and help our child leave an unsafe situation.

Here are some questions you might consider asking your child, if you find yourself struggling with these concerns. The questions may prompt him/her to consider choices without feeling lectured, pressured, or judged.

• You come from different life experiences, so I’m wondering if you’re finding some common ground, and how you’ll manage conflicts that may come up as a result.

• You seem to have strong opinions about—.  Do you share the same beliefs?

• Have you discussed how you will handle—(finances, children, religion, sex, careers, household responsibilities, holidays, celebrations)?

• Are you comfortable with the way you work through conflicts and disappointments?

• Honesty, safety, respect and trust are vital to a healthy relationship. Are you confident these things are in place and do you see them in action?

As we struggle to know how to manage concerns like these, I have learned a valuable lesson that I’ve shared with clients, included in my book, and applied in my own life: Ultimately, we need to ask God to grant us wisdom and grace to know how to respond to our children’s choices, those we applaud and those that concern us.

To handle those concerns in the best way possible for all of us and to help us keep our concerns from becoming roadblocks to building a healthy relationship with our children.

 You’ll find these suggestions and additional comments in Chapter Six of my book, Secrets to Parenting Your Adult Child (Bethany House, 2011).
