 Get Ripped 

Myron Mielke
 A Commonsense Approach 
Page 1

If youve tried but repeatedly failed to reveal your six-pack abs, Ive got the perfect plan for you. Many of the countless articles over the years on weight loss and shedding bodyfat offer sound advice and can produce incredible results. Even so, they always seem to miss the bridge between no diet and dieting.

That in itself makes some plans difficult, perhaps impossible, to follow. Whatever results a plan might be capable of producing, if the average person cant follow it, it isnt going to be effective.

 Dont Go Cold Turkey 

Lets say you follow a somewhat typical off-season bodybuilding diet. You try to eat four to six times per day and try to eat protein with each meal. You drink one or two protein shakes a day, and you lift three to five days per week.

You dont count carbs, and you dont limit desserts and high-fat foods. Pizza and burgers are part of your mass-building diet. Your abdominal muscles are not visible, but if you pull down on your stomach skin, you can sort of see one row of abs peeking through. By summer (June or July) youd like to see a six-pack.

Ive seen people start diets at the beginning of January. They know theyve added a few pounds of pure fat during the holiday season, and theyre fired up to get rid of it. Monday morning comes around, and they make up their own diet. One grapefruit and a bowl of raisin bran for breakfast are a good start, especially since Fridays breakfast was an Egg McMuffin, hashbrowns and a pastry.

Lunch consists of a hardboiled egg, two slices of melba toast, carrot sticks and a diet soda. Dinner is a huge salad with about one-half cup of ranch dressing. A bedtime snack is a few celery sticks. Day two ends up being much the same. By day three many are ready to cave in. McDonalds drive-through is just too hard to resist for both breakfast and lunch.

The person I just described was making up a diet based on what he thought a diet should be like. What about the person who reads about someones incredible 12-week transformation?

That transformer, who eats an astonishing six to seven times per day, writes about his very own secret recipes. After trying the transformers secret recipe for frozen oatmeal-and-sucralose Popsicles, the would-be dieter throws in the towel again, and McDonalds drive-through awaits with open arms.

The moral of the two stories: Gradually adjust your diet by making small changes. Dont go from eating Snickers to carrot sticks (or frozen oatmeal Popsicles). Thats really hard to do. Most people fail when they try such an abrupt switch.

 Starting Off on the Right Foot 

A typical get-ripped diet lasts 12 to 16 weeks. That gives you plenty of time to slowly ease into your diet without abruptly changing anything. Its much easier to make a few small changes at a time.

Week 1: Make sure you eat five to six meals with high-quality protein. Stick with the high-protein meals throughout the whole plan. Next, eliminate one junk food from your diet. If you eat chocolate or drink regular soda, stop. Drink diet soda instead. Thats it for week one. Simple, huh?

Week 2: Eliminate all burgers and pizza. If you eat at a fast-food restaurant, order a grilled-chicken sandwich and a small side salad with low-cal dressing instead of the fries.

Week 3: Stop eating desserts. Many people love to finish dinner with a tasty dessert. Youll need to eliminate desserts six days per week. Have a dessert or two on Sundayas a treat and reward.

Week 4: Salad time. Replace one meal per day with a large lettuce salad. Id recommend dinner, since a lower carb intake later in the day helps burn bodyfat. Any vegetables are fine in the salad; just leave off the croutons, cheese and high-calorie dressing. Eat a grilled chicken breast with the salad.

Week 5: Introduce cardio. Incorporate three to four 30-minute cardio sessions into your weekly schedule. It doesnt matter what kind of cardio you do. Find something you like. I prefer walking, running or biking outside.

Staying Ripped

Dave Goodin
 
Q: I had the pleasure of seeing you guest pose at shows in Ohio and Indiana many years ago. I just saw a clip of you on Facebook guest posing at the 09 NPC Texas Natural State Championships in July. Its been 10 to 12 years since I saw you pose in person, and you look like youre still in ripped conditionbut bigger. Thats impressive! How old are you now? How do you stay in such great condition all the time? And why is it that youre in fantastic shape for appearances, but most of the IFBB pros Ive seen guest pose look 30 to 40 pounds out of shape?
 
GOODIN RIPPED

Steve Holman
 
Dave Goodin flew to L.A. from Texas last May to shoot with Michael Neveux, and to say that Mike was impressed would be an understatement. After the shoot he called me immediately to rave about Dave (Dave and I have known each other since college). The guy was incredibly ripped and full, Mike said. Hes got to be one of the best over-40 drug-free bodybuilders in the country. I agreed wholeheartedly.
