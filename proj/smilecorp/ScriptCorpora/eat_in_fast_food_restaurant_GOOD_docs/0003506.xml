 Engineered? What are Foote-Mats™made of? The Foote-Mats™system uses a durable, 
 soft-flex rubber base combined with disposable top sheets. The 
 base is made with &quot;stay-put&quot; pegs 
 to hold each fresh new top sheet in place. 
 The Foote-Mat™top sheet is made of four 
 layers, each with its own job. The top layer is a tough, 
 apertured material and it practically snaps drops of moisture out 
 of mid-air. The black color hides drips and stains. The second 
 layer is a super-absorbent material that also eliminates odor 
 causing bacteria. The third layer blocks all moisture from getting 
 down to the restroom floor. And the fourth layer is a scrim material 
 that keeps everything held together tightly while adding a nice, 
 fabric feel to the product. As you can see, Foote-Mats™aren’t just paper towels! They’re engineered! 
 Back to top What makes Foote-Mats™different from the rest? Foote-Mats™offer a simple, innovative 
 system to eliminate drips, stains, and odors! The absorbent Foote-Mats™top sheet retains moisture, is cost-efficient, and is easily 
 disposable. The principal competition for Foote-Mats™are large, bulky trays with plastic grids over white diaper material
 that shows all drips and stains. Moreover, these trays are 
 hard to dispose of, don’t adhere well to bathroom floors, can’t 
 be private labeled with your company’s logo, and cost more than 
 three times as much as Foote-Mats™. Click here to download a comparison chart. Back to top Will I be able to mop less frequently when I use Foote-Mats™? 
Yes, if you’re currently mopping once every two days (say, in an office environment), you can modify that schedule to once every three days or even once a week. This can reduce the time required to close down your restroom and lessen slip-and-fall hazards. You can even mop over the Foote-Mats™with a damp mop to remove dusty footprints or to refresh.

Remember, by preventing urine from reaching the bathroom floor you are also preventing the spread of urine throughout the bathroom by the feet of bathroom users. The majority of the mess and odor in the bathroom will be eliminated.
 Back to top How do I ensure that our Foote-Mats™stay in place? Foote-Mats™have a durable, soft-flex rubber base with two pegs in the back two corners that are adhered to the bathroom floor with double-stick foam tape. These pegs prevent Foote-Mats™from moving around the floor when stepped on, accidentally kicked, or mopped over.

It is very important to install the Foote-Mats™rubber mat only on clean and dry bathroom floors under urinals. The location on the floor for the two floor pegs must be cleaned with alcohol or glass cleaner and allowed to dry before putting the base into position. It is best to steer clear of grout lines or uneven floor surfaces for good peg adhesion. Refer to the installation video for proper positioning under the urinal.

Coming soon–we will be offering industrial strength pegs for high-traffic restrooms. Back to top What if the pegs come off of the floor? 
There have been times when curiosity about the product has prompted people to pull, tug or kick the product quite violently and thus cause the two rear pegs to come off of the floor. Hopefully you will find that this destructive behavior goes away once the novelty of the installed Foote-Mats™product wears off.

One reason that the pegs might pull from the floor prematurely is improper installation. It is very important to install the Foote-Mats™rubber base mat only on clean and dry bathroom floors under urinals. The location on the floor for the two floor pegs must be cleaned with alcohol or glass cleaner and allowed to dry before putting the base into position. It is best to steer clear of grout lines or uneven floor surfaces for good peg adhesion. Refer to the installation video for proper positioning under the urinal.

Finally, if your Foote-Mats™are located in high-traffic restrooms, you may need to purchase our heavy duty pegs to ensure that the product stays in place. These pegs have a much larger surface area for adhering to the floor and stay put about five times (5x) as well as our standard pegs. These pegs should be available after July 1.

 Back to top How long do Foote-Mats™last? Can one make them last longer? Foote-Mats™generally last up to two weeks (14 days) in office installations. 
 We recommend changing-out Foote-Mats™according to the following schedule: 
 Recommended
Frequency of Change Type of Facility Uses per Day Every day Airport, rest areas More than 300 Every 3 days Bar, fast food restaurant Up to 300 Every 5 days Full service restaurant Up to 200 Every 7 days (1 week) Retail store Up to 100 Every 14 days (2 weeks) Office Up to 50 
 If you find that Foote-Mats™are 
 dirty or dusty from shoeprints, they can be &quot;cleaned up&quot; 
 by spraying them with a water mist or whatever spray-type surface 
 cleaner you are currently using. This washes the dirt down into 
 the Mat where it’s invisible to the restroom user. If you want to add a clean scent to your Foote-Mats™, 
 just spray them with a spray-type surface cleaner and the cleaning 
 spray is absorbed into the Mats in just seconds. 
 Simply spray to refresh 10 seconds later! 
 Back to top Do Foote-Mats™control odors? Independent lab tests showed that Foote-Mats™kill odor-causing bacteria by design. This inherent property of 
 the materials used in the construction of the mat simply offers 
 no viable environment in which the bacteria can reproduce 
 and thus cause odors. Back to top If Foote-Mats™are stepped on will the user get urine on his shoes? No. The top layer of Foote-Mats™is specially engineered to pull the moisture away from the surface 
 into the center of the Mat without letting it come back up . 
 Once the moisture reaches the absorbent layer it is spread out 
 and quickly dries up. Back to top What should I do if our logo chip comes loose or knocks out easily? To keep the Foote-Mats™logo chip firmly in place, remove the chip and place some hot melt glue, silicone caulk, or other adhesive inside of the chip well. You can now reinsert the chip, making sure that you snap it securely in place. Back to top Will drops of urine sit on top of Foote-Mats™? No. The Foote-Mats™are designed 
 so that the moment moisture hits the top layer it is instantly 
 absorbed. It’s incredible to see. Back to top How do I install my new Foote-Mats™? Refer to the installation video for proper positioning of the base mat under the urinal as well as the installation of Foote-Mats top sheets. Back to top If Foote-Mats™are completely soaked will they leak through to the bathroom floor? No. Below the layer of 
 absorbent material in the Foote-Mats™top sheet are an impermeable barrier of plastic to stop 
 urine (even in instances of extreme saturation) from reaching the 
 floor. Back to top How do I eliminate drips that flow down the urinal? To eliminate the problem of drips flowing down the front of the urinal to a low point that is too near the wall and missing the Foote-Mats™, apply a silicon bead at an inconspicuous area as shown in the installation diagram in figure 3 or on the installation video . Back to top Won’t stained Foote-Mats™be just as unsightly as a stained bathroom floor? Foote-Mats™and their bases are made 
 in black to hide the nasty stains associated with urine. Not only 
 does the bathroom user have a more sanitary experience, but the 
 grout on your restroom floors is also being protected from the 
 urine. Back to top How do I prevent moisture under Foote-Mats™? When placing the rubber base mat into position, it is best to ensure that the floor under the mat is completely dry. Coming soon–we will have sheets available that you can place under Foote-Mats™to help absorb moisture. Back to top Is black the only color Foote-Mats™are available in? Yes. Black not only conceals the unsightly stains but it also 
 provides users with a clean, upscale look. These mats are beautiful! Back to top Can I get my company’s logo put on the Mats? Companies are able to customize the Foote-Mats™base with corporate logos. Back to top Do you offer Foote-Mats™for regular toilets? At this time Foote-Mats™are only available
 for urinals. In the future, however, we will offer 
 Mats for normal toilets or commodes. Back to top How much urine can Foote-Mats™hold? Urine normally comes into contact with Foote-Mats™, 
 of course, in small drips over long periods of time and the wicking 
 properties of our absorbent Mats makes quick work of drying out 
 urine - certainly much faster than it would dry out just sitting 
 on a tile floor! However, if Foote-Mats™were to be saturated with 220 drips in a 6&quot;x6&quot; area, 
 they would be completely dry in approximately 7 hours 
 assuming 72°temperature and 45% humidity. This amount represents 
 a sustained rate of 30 drips per hour that the Mat can handle 
 without becoming saturated in this small area of a much larger mat. 
 That’s a lot of urine! Is there any research available on the value of restroom cleanliness? Yes. Research shows that a clean restroom is CRITICAL to customer satisfaction! 
 According to the 2001 Cleaning Maintenance and 
 Management in-house survey, &quot;the number one building maintenance 
 complaint is dirty, stinking restrooms.&quot; (Kaivac Cleaning Systems) 85% of senior citizens said a dirty restroom would 
 have a negative impact on a restaurant experience. 80% of women 
 said a dirty restroom would cause them to question a restaurant’s 
 food-handling practices. The 2003 Procter and Gamble Contract Cleaning Benchmarking 
 Survey Report showed that restroom cleanliness issues account for 
 over 33% of all types of customer complaints. A recent Hilton Hotel customer survey ranked bathroom 
 cleanliness as more important than perceived safety and hotel service. The Maritz Poll found that 80% of Americans rate 
 interior cleanliness as their number one concern when selecting 
 a fast-food restaurant. 78% of people surveyed agreed that a clean restaurant restroom is a strong indicator of a clean kitchen (from Franchise Times Magazine, May 2004). Cleanliness was the top consideration for returning to a particular restroom in one survey, with 85 percent citing it as the chief reason. In a related question, 73 percent selected this as their most important concern about public restrooms (from BSCAI Services Magazine, April 2006). The International Facility Management Association (IFMA) surveys its members every year to determine the top 10 office complaints and says that“dirty restrooms”are a top 3 complaint amongst employees every year the study has been conducted. The 2004 Pioneer Eclipse In-House Cleaning Operations Benchmarking Survey Report once again pinpointed bathroom cleanliness as the target of most complaints by building occupants. 
 Back to top How much do Foote-Mats™cost? Foote-Mats™cost only pennies per day! Your daily cost from using Foote-Mats™can be calculated as follows: 
 $1.49 – average retail price of single Foote-Mat™top sheet ÷14 – four weeks (typical life of Foote-Mat™in office environment) 10.6¢ – cost per day per urinal 
But it gets better! Of course using Foote-Mats™ saves costs associated with mopping and cleaning labor, 
 cleaning chemicals, grout replacement, carpet cleaning, losing business due to dirty bathrooms, etc. But how does one determine these costs? We used a big, fat formula and found out that Foote-Mats™can save you money (not cost you!) but there are guesses and assumptions involved: is $8 per hour for labor the 
 right wage? 10 minutes per restroom cleaning? How should we account for higher employee retention and fewer workman’s compensation claims? 
 Is 25¢in chemicals per mopping a good number? How about needing less odor control, or fewer carpet cleanings outside of 
 the men’s restrooms, or happier customers because the bathroom is not closed down so much? It’s complicated! The bottom line, however, is not complicated:  for just pennies per day (much less, once the savings are figured in), 
 you can make your customers, co-workers, and cleaning staff happier and healthier! Give Foote-Mats™a try. You’ll be glad you did. To order give us a call at 1.866.752.0323 or click here to order. Back to top
