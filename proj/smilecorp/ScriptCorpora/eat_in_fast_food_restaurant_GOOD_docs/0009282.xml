Question:
 

 Your case seems to be valid and sounds like product liability/negligence on the food provider’s end. Considering you incurred damage and medical expenses, and the fact that you have gathered evidence, you should immediately contact your attorney to discuss the next steps. Your lawyer will discuss payment for your pain and suffering. However it is helpful to have an idea of the value of your tooth damage before you speak with a lawyer. Also keep in mind there are time limits for filing personal injury lawsuits in which you are no longer able to sue after a certain amount of time.
