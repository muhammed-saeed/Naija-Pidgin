Ten things that are supposed to be easy

 1/ Getting a haircut 
“What are we doing with your hair today, then?”he says, in what you’ll look back and realise was a shrewd tactical move to share culpability. The problem is, no matter what you say–even if it’s“Just a little tidy up”–he hears“Give me one of those One Direction-esque coifs and don’t spare the Brylcreem, my good man”. Still, it’ll make a nice change for your beanie to get some use in July, eh?

 2/ Making a bed 
Everyone can make their bed, right? Mum showed you when you were younger. It&apos;s just simple geometry - and yet here we are, stuck halfway inside a duvet cover, swearing at an undersheet. How is everything supposed to stay level? How do you make it the creases go away? MYSTERY. 
 

 3/ Making sandwiches that taste like the ones in the supermarket 
Sandwich maker:“Dude, it’s easy. Bread, mayo, bacon, lettuce, tomato. Bam! Just like Tesco.”Sandwich eater:“Tastes weird. Flavourless. Piggy.”Maker:“Any suggestions?”Eater:“Here, use this. Sodium nitrate.”Maker:“What does it do?”Eater:“Makes stuff taste like seawater siphoned through a cat litter tray.”Maker:“Delicious.”
 
4/ Getting comfortably drunk 
Everyone else seems to be having a lovely time. So why do you keep finding yourself staring forlornly into yet another over-expensive pint at about quarter to eleven, feeling either a) entirely, unfairly sober and actually a bit tired or b) slightly too pissed to risk finishing your glass?

 5/ Keeping plants alive 
As nature ordained, all they need is water and sunlight. That’s what Biology GCSE and Titchmarsh say too. So why does the basil have leprosy? What’s the deal with the house plant looking like a fish skeleton? Andy why the hell has that amazing ornamental tree in the garden started to smell like spunk?

 6/ Telling if food is off or not 
Is this milk off? It smells like... well, it smells like milk. How is milk supposed to smell? You can&apos;t tell. You&apos;ve never smelled it on day of purchase. That&apos;d be weird. You take a sip and then, regardless of how it tastes, pour the whole lot down the sink.
 
7/ Supporting the England football team 
For three weeks every two years, you’re forced to cheer on players you normally spend every Saturday afternoon despising. Imagine Ashley Cole is Jesus (petrifying, int it?) and you’re Judas. But Judas is wearing a four-year-old England shirt and Jesus is getting skinned for the umpteenth time by a 17-year-old Brazilian.  
 
8/ Eating a banana 
There was a time when primeval man could grunt,“Ug ug. Just eating a banana there, are you? Ug. Cool. Ug”. But, hundreds of years, several Carry On films and some dodgy potassium-heavy pornos later, it’s a veritable minefield of social awkwardness. Make eye contact with a stranger while sliding the herbaceous member into your mouth and you may as well have licked their face and let our a girlish squeal while tickling your balls.

 9/ Shaving your own head 
Plug the clippers in, grade two, attack from the front, accidentally carve a swastika in the back. Oh FFS.

 10/ Paying your girlfriend a compliment 
You look really nice in that…“What do you mean by that?”You know, nice.“Nice?”Yeah, like, pretty… “I don’t want to be‘pretty’, you should think I’m sexy.”I do. You do look sexy!“So you’re saying I’m cheap?”
