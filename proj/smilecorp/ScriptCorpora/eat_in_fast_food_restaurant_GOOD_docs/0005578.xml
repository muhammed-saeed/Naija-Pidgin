 In my opinion I&apos;d say El Pollo Loco and Yoshinoya besides Subway, Togos, and Quizno&apos;s.

 Subway. If not, I&apos;d have to say Del Taco if its a real mexican place (I&apos;ve never heard of it so you&apos;ll have to figure that out) If not, its probably Burger King because they charbroil their burgers rather than grilling them in grease and fat.

 Well, what I consider fast food is McDonalds, BK, Wendy&apos;s, Taco Bell, KFC, and Arby&apos;s...so out of those I say Wendy&apos;s because they have things like Baked Potatoes and Healthier Salads and stuff...McDonalds is def. the unhealthiest though

 McDonalds, obviously. I get a 10 piece chicken selects, large fries and a strawberry milkshake and I know I am doing something healthy for myself.
Actually, McDonald&apos;s is working on reformulating their foods to low/no calorie versions.

 Chick-Fil-A. There are a ton of options on the menu that are very low in fat and have low calories also. My favorite is the chargrilled chicken sandwich with the fruit cup. It comes out to only 350 calories.

 subway is the healthiest and subway is also the most fattening... it all depends on what you order... i only order a roast beef sandwich at subway so that is pretty healthy

 Subway or Wendy&apos;s have the most healthy selections but McDonalds and Burger King also provide soups and salad so just be careful what you order. Subway is your best bet though!

 Out of the choices above, I would probably say McDonalds because they do have some healthy foods (not many). But the best place is Subway.
