 Elevation Burger Coming To South Florida 
 
 Elevation Burger , the Virginia-based chain that prides itself on making burgers with organic grass-fed beef and other environmentally-friendly ingredients, is coming to South Florida this year. The company has signed a franchise agreement with two entrepreneurs who plan to open at least three units in Broward and Palm Beach Counties.

The menu is concise: there are beef or vegetarian patties, which you can even mix together in a double stack burger. Sides are fries (fried in olive oil), salads, mandarin oranges and cookies. Add a shake or malt and that sounds like a good meal.

 Palm Beach Commissioners Considering Peanut Island Restaurant 
 
The Maritime Museum is pushing for a restaurant on undeveloped Peanut Island, eight years after the last proposal was voted down by coastal towns fearing increased traffic and parking headaches.

Peanut Island, which was created by the sediment dug out to make the Port of Palm Beach, is popular with boaters and has a much-used campground. The Maritime Museum, also on the island, would like to add a restaurant to give boaters a spot for some food and drink. A private company made a similar proposal in 2001—for a 4,000-square foot restaurant—and promised to give a portion of the earnings to the museum. There&apos;s also some concern that one restaurant will lead to more development on the island and completely change Peanut Island.

Unless the museum plans to bring in a great chef and make the island a dining destination, it&apos;s probably not going to attract extra people to Peanut Island, which is already very crowded as is. So we can&apos;t imagine a small museum restaurant would cause an increase in traffic in coastal towns, and it might be a good way for the museum to make some extra money by feeding the people who are already there.

What do you think? Have you been to Peanut Island, and would a restaurant there be helpful?

 Quattro Owners Opening Pizzeria 
 
The owners of Quattro Gastronomia Italiana are planning to open a Neapolitan-style pizzeria on Lincoln Road, just across the street from the restaurant. According to a spokesperson for the pizzeria, called Sosta Enoteca, the owners are importing an authentic wood-burning oven from Italy and expect to open May 1.

 Tasters Grille Market Opens In Tavernier 
 
East meets west at the new Tasters Grille Market, which has taken over the old Anthony&apos;s spot in Tavernier. It&apos;s run by a sommelier who&apos;s no stranger to the Keys dining scene—he&apos;s also consulted for Braza Leña , Snapper&apos;s and Old Tavernier Restaurant —and a kitchen veteran who&apos;s mastered South Carolina&apos;s low country cooking and South Florida&apos;s own brand of Caribbean-style cuisine. The menu is all over the map, although it keeps the focus on locally-caught fish cooked in Caribbean and Asian flavors, like crab rangoon or mahi mahi tacos, which come with pico de gallo. We&apos;re actually most intrigued by the &quot;Keys Limeade,&quot; made with key limes, fresh ginger and cane sugar. Certainly sounds refreshing.

 Little River Not Pretty Enough For Good Morning America 
 
 Good Morning America &quot;visited&quot; Red Light—or so they say: While in Key Biscane [sic], Fla., Sam Champion visited the Red Light restaurant, which will be a year old in April and the brainchild of South Florida chef Kris Wessel. Wessel is originally from New Orleans, but his grandmother landed in Miami Beach in 1925 and built the restaurant inside of a notorious prostitute- and drug-filled motel on Biscayne Boulevard in the heart of Miami. Huh? Seriously? We&apos;re scratching our heads over the grandmother thing—is that just abysmally worded, or is there more to this restaurant&apos;s history than Wessel let on to us ?

The restaurant is also very much NOT on Key Biscayne, although it&apos;s pretty clear the segment was shot there, with a beautiful view of the bay in the background. We&apos;re assuming GMA was in the area for the Sony Ericsson Open, held on Key Biscayne. (We didn&apos;t catch the show, and the video is apparently nowhere to be found on the GMA site.) So it was likely easier, and more picturesque than that Upper East Side stretch of Biscayne Boulevard, to do the segment nearby, although it would seem weird talking about the motel&apos;s checkered past and the Little River as an urban haven for manatees while filming Wessel in a neighborhood with a six-figure median family income. (Wessel, by the way, demonstrated how to make Red Light Snapper, with a red lentil salad and tomatoes, conch ceviche with citrus and hot sauce, and a key lime and mulberry parfait on the show.)

In the end, a local guy who&apos;s putting out great food is getting national coverage, which is always a good thing.

 Learn To Cook With Edgar Leal 
 
 Edgar Leal, head chef and owner of Cacao Restaurant in Coral Gables, is teaching a cooking class at La Cuisine Gourmet on Saturday. Cost is $80 per person, and you&apos;ll have to make a reservation.

On the menu: pumpkin foam, ceviche, risotto and chocolate souffle. Assuming that pumpkin foam is the same as the one that&apos;s on the menu, then that recipe alone is worth the $80 class fee. It is that good.

 Food Festival-Filled Weekend 
 
Foodies are in luck this weekend, what with the plethora of food festivals going on around here. Here are the details on food events for Saturday and Sunday:

 Metropolitan Cooking&amp;Entertaining Show 
The South Florida Fairground&apos;s Americraft Expo Center hosts the first-ever Metropolitan Cooking&amp;Entertaining Show in West Palm Beach, with cooking demonstrations, workshops, food samples and celebrity appearances. Bobby Flay, Paula Deen and the Neelys will be around to sign cookbooks, entertain the crowds, etc. The event runs Saturday and Sunday, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., respectively. Tickets are $20/$10 adults/children in advance and $25/$12 on site, but if you want to see the big celebrities, you&apos;ll have to pay $80 ($30 for kids) for that ticket.

 Taste of MiMo 
This Miami Modern food festival is back this Saturday. From noon to 5 p.m., walk up and down Biscayne Boulevard between 67th and 78th Streets for food samples from 11 different restaurants, like Che Sopranos Pizza&amp;Pasta , Moshi Moshi , Moonchine Asian Bistro and Red Light , among others. The event is free, but the food samples will cost between $2 and $5 each.

 Deering Seafood Festival 
Head over to the Deering Estate on Sunday for lots of local seafood: lobster, blue crabs, crawfish, conch, shrimp and dolphin. Chefs from Ortanique on the Mile , The Oceanaire Seafood Room , Bizcaya Grill and 3030 Ocean will be on hand for cooking demonstrations and to offer samples of seafood dishes. And when you&apos;re done eating, there&apos;s a rock climbing wall and a pontoon boat tour. (Come to think of it, those activities are probably best done before lunch.) Entrance to the festival is $15 for adults and $5 for kids ages 4-14, although keep in mind that it doesn&apos;t include food, drink, pontoon boat or rock climbing wall. All that will cost you extra.

 Grand Opening At BLT Steak 
 
The much-anticipated BLT Steak , Miami&apos;s first Laurent Tourondel restaurant, is officially open at The Betsy Hotel on South Beach. The restaurant held a grand opening party yesterday evening where the entire menu was served buffet-style.

This is the ninth BLT Steak location; the first one opened in New York in 2004. Rather than offer the same menu at each restaurant, Tourondel seems to tailor it to the area. For example, there&apos;s a variation on the Cuban sandwich (pressed pork belly and speck with garlic fries) on the Miami Beach menu, while the New York menu doesn&apos;t offer sandwiches at all. The same goes for chimichurri, which is one of the sauces available down here. The Miami menu offers fewer meat options—no Kobe steak, for one thing—and more local seafood, like stone crabs and red snapper. And he&apos;s hit the nail on the head with the dessert menu: lots of citrus, tropical fruits, sorbets and mousse, which are sweet, light, and refreshing. Exactly what&apos;s needed while on the beach.

Sara at All Purpose Dark has photos from the grand opening party—the meat looks great, but it&apos;s the cheese table photo, even with the poor lighting and the grainy quality, that is making us swoon.

 New Lounge 251 Palm Beach Opening Tonight 
 
The owner of the old 251 Sunrise in Palm Beach is returning to the exact same spot with a new lounge called 251 Palm Beach. It opens tonight with a VIP reception at 9 p.m.; if you&apos;re not on the VIP list, you can head over after 11 p.m. For now, it&apos;s just a lounge, but owner Gus Renny, who also co-owns Grease Burger Bar in West Palm Beach, expects to add a restaurant in another few weeks, according to the Palm Beach Post .

Renny points out that there&apos;s a need on Palm Beach for a swanky place to go. The problem? All of these trendy people are about to fly away home to their summer retreats. &quot;Is this really the right time, especially on the island that is so seasonal?&quot; asks bartender J.P. Bowles. &quot;You&apos;re not really going to have a summer crowd, but we&apos;re confident it&apos;s the right time, even though it&apos;s not the right time.&quot; Well, that&apos;s sure to instill confidence. If they can make it to October, they&apos;ll be in good shape.

 Review Of The Week: Can&apos;t Say Enough 
 
Our review of the week comes from &quot;Blondie,&quot; who left a comment for Extreme Pizza titled &quot;The Best Pizza in Florida.&quot; Well, that&apos;s quite a claim! Here&apos;s the text of the review: I love this place. I cant say enough, try it and you will see what I mean. Hands down, simply the Best! Going back tonight... For someone who can&apos;t say enough about the pizza, Blondie certainly said very little. In the interest of actually providing some guidance for other users, a few more descriptions might&apos;ve been useful. The complete lack of specifics makes us think that this most likely came from someone who just wanted to bump up the restaurant&apos;s star rating on the site.

 Marlins Expecting A Lot Out Of Little Havana 
 
So, the Marlins will finally have a stadium. It comes at a cost to the taxpayer, of course, but at this point, we&apos;re just happy there&apos;s finally an agreement. Today&apos;s Miami Herald has a very pie-in-the-sky take on what 2012, the first season in the new park, will look like for the Marlins: a sellout every game (ha!), a payroll right about in the middle range when compared to other teams, and an assurance from management that at least 1,000 tickets will be $15. Which is interesting, because they couldn&apos;t sell tickets even when the Fish Tank was still $3 for a seat; now the cheapest seats will be five times as much?

But we hope we&apos;re wrong. When it comes to food, team president David Samson said there will be a large plaza inside the ballpark with &quot;Taste of Miami&quot; food courts offering croquetas, sushi and stone crabs. A little upmarket for a ballpark, but OK. And city manager Pete Hernandez suggested that a restaurant like ESPN Zone might be a possibility for the surrounding area, which is currently dominated, at least in terms of dining options, by small Cuban cafeterias and Nicaraguan fritangas.

Maybe it&apos;ll work. That wasn&apos;t the case with the other big ballpark in Florida, the Tampa Bay Rays&apos; site in St. Petersburg, where restaurant turnover has been incredibly high.

What would you like to see inside and outside the ballpark in terms of food?

 Miami Beach&apos;s VFW Post Makes Dive Bar List 
 
Drinks and views of the bay don&apos;t come cheap on Miami Beach, unless you&apos;ve managed to find the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 3559 which offers both cheap beer and a spectacular view. It&apos;s the definition of a dive, which is why it made Details&apos; Best Dive Bars in America list. There&apos;s a juke box, pool table, cheap drinks, and an entertaining cast of characters—what more could one want?

The bar is located at 650 West Avenue, underneath The Floridian condo building. But getting there is a bit more complicated than just finding the address. According to Yelper Maria A .: You drive up to a condo, park in a private little lot, find a non descript door go up a few stairs, ring a doorbell, get buzzed in, take an elevator one floor up, and when the doors open c&apos;est magic and voila you are at the VFW. Easy enough for the locals, and just enough hoops to go through to keep the tourists away.

 Get Your Cheap Wine Here 
 
Sara at All Purpose Dark clues us in to some great wine deals at DeVito South Beach (all wines under $200 are half off on Monday nights) and Bistro One LR , where 75 wines are 60 percent off on Wednesday nights. And at Pizza Fusion , if you order $25 of food on a Tuesday, you get a free bottle of organic house wine. The restaurant has so many deals on different days (check out each one at Short Order ) that we imagine the servers must have a hard time keeping them straight.

 Bayside Chatter: All About Govind Armstrong 
 
 8 Oz Burger Bar has been making quite a buzz this past week. There was the review in the Herald last week, and there have been plenty of opinions on Chowhound . Most seem to agree that while the food is great, the service can be clueless and disorganized when the restaurant is busy. Natalie over at Natalie&apos;s Nibbles visited the burger spot recently and had a similar complaint. But the food! We might put up with quite a bit to get deep-fried chorizo-stuffed olives (which, by the way, are also available at Table 8 ) and fried mozzarella-topped burgers.

In other Govind Armstrong news, the ladies over at FoodTastic! went to Table 8 to sample the Winter Spice menu. More raves for the stuffed olives, in addition to the cilantro margaritas, duck confit and the vanilla panna cotta.

 Mai-Kai Introduces Half-Priced Happy Hour Deals 
 
Show up at Mai-Kai between 5 and 7 p.m. and you can get your Shanghai chicken or crab rangoon for half off the regular menu price. That goes for drinks too. This might be a good way to experiment with some of the more interesting drinks—&quot;Shrunken Skull&quot; anyone?—on the long list. Two exceptions to the half-priced deal: the Sidewinder&apos;s Fang (which serves two!) and the Mystery Drink.

After 58 years, the The Olde Lighthouse Restaurant in Jupiter has shut its doors. According to the Palm Beach Post, the restaurant&apos;s last day was Saturday. It&apos;s tough when a bad economy counts a piece of history among its victims.

 Lime Expanding To Midtown Miami 
 
 The new location of Lime Fresh Mexican Grill opens early next month in Midtown Miami at 3201 N Miami Ave. According to chief operating officer Tom Ingersoll, everything is ready to go, and they&apos;re just waiting for the final inspections.

The grand opening is set for April 16 , where there will be complimentary hors d&apos;oeuvres, cocktails and Dos XX, in addition to a mariachi band. If the free food doesn&apos;t entice you enough, perhaps this will: the company is presenting a $2,000 check to the Humane Society of Greater Miami&apos;s Adopt-A-Pet program.

We&apos;ve had our eyes on a few restaurants opening up in the coming weeks. Here&apos;s what we&apos;ve got on the dining docket:

• The Sports Exchange has set an opening date: April 1. And it&apos;s not an April Fool&apos;s Day joke. Well, at least we don&apos;t think so...

• Fresh Bistro&amp;Nightclub , in the old Swig Bartini spot, has been serving the food on the old menu but will be introducing a new menu next week. Swig&apos;s , in the meantime, is on the hunt for a new location.

•The Texas-based Uncle Julio&apos;s Fine Mexican Cuisine is opening its first South Florida location in Boca Raton&apos;s Mizner Park on March 31.

 Review Of The Week: Cover Your Eyes, Children 
 
For this week&apos;s wonderful-yet-unpublishable review, we go back a few weeks to a colder, darker time: late January in Chicago. The nights fell early, the snow fell often, and restaurant workers suffering a dip in their income and morale due to the nation&apos;s collective holiday hangover, fell for each other.

Or at least that&apos;s what one would-be reviewer would have you believe, though we doubt this particular tale. For one thing, nobody&apos;s desperate/forgetful enough to do this right in the window. For another, this reviewer, who happens to know the name of the two employees and the identity of the owner, is about 99.9 percent certainly a disgruntled ex-employee of the soul food restaurant that will go unnamed: [Name redacted], Chicago, 1/30/09 
I&apos;m no longer going to this place due to the fact that while walking to work one night I pass by the restaraunt to find the cook (name redacted) having sex with the girl at the front counter (name redacted), right in the kitchen. Huge store window and they were right there. Thats nasty and i wouldnt recommend this place to anyone. Also, they customers and boss are rude and disrespectful. Beware. Right. You&apos;ll have to come up with a more subtle (though hopefully no less juicy) story than that to get published here. Oh, wait.

 Charges Dropped Against 264 The Grill Owner 
 
Patricia Gatti, co-owner of 264 The Grill , won&apos;t be charged for attempting to influence an employee&apos;s vote in the presidential election. Gatti allegedly threatened to fire all of the restaurant&apos;s black employees if Obama won. Turns out that the evidence didn&apos;t support beyond a reasonable doubt that she corruptly influenced voting.

So, basically, Gatti threatened to fire employees over something they had little to no control over—a handful of votes would not have changed the results of the election. And she apparently wrote &quot;KKK&quot; on at least one employee&apos;s timecard. Isn&apos;t this less about influencing voting and more about harassment, and don&apos;t the employees have a real case there? And the crazy thing is that the restaurant&apos;s co-owner is black. How that business partnership came to be is a mystery.

 RJ Gator&apos;s Founder Gives Restaurants Another Try 
 
The founder of RJ Gator&apos;s is back in the restaurant business . Tim Timoteo is opening a new 125-seat spot called Berry Fresh Cafe in Port St. Lucie later this month. He sold his Palm Beach County house, bought a smaller place in Port St. Lucie, and pumped the rest of the money from the sale into the restaurant. Interestingly enough, the bad economy pushed him back into the restaurant business; he couldn&apos;t make enough money as a realtor in this market, so he went back to what he knew best.

In another sign of a bad economy, Timoteo has already received 600 applications for just 30-35 positions at the new restaurant.

 Thank God For Broke College Students 
 
 Our brother was just complaining about the pasty-white spring breakers clogging Collins Avenue, and sure enough, the Miami Herald tells us today that the economic recession has not deterred college students from descending upon South Florida and spending what little money they have on booze. (Well, they also need hotels, cabs, and food, although we know where the bulk of the money goes.) These party-hard types have never been all that popular among local business owners, but this year, after a slow winter season, they&apos;re being welcomed with open arms—well, except in Broward County, where the tourism bureau recently issued a statement titled &quot;Bad Economy or Not, Greater Fort Lauderdale Steadfastly Says &apos;No Thanks&apos; to Spring Break.&quot; Yeah, good luck with that.

Over on South Beach, some places are actually giving away free booze, which is just asking for trouble on spring break: [Catalina Hotel general manager Linsey] Harris tracks the rush by the hotel&apos;s nightly free cocktail hour.

&apos;&apos;In February, I was looking at a case of vodka a night for all three bars,&apos;&apos; she said. ``Now I&apos;m up to nearly three cases in one night alone. And this is just for one hour.&apos;&apos; Alcohol consumption tripling? That sounds about right.

 Review Of The Week: Striking Gold 2.0 
 
This week&apos;s Review Of The Week comes, once more, from New York. Why do we keep looking to the Big Apple for fodder here? Because it is crazy full of restaurants and people reviewing them on MenuPages. Also because it is crazy.

However, this review, for Wai Lee , holds the distinction of not only being our favorite review to read this week, but also one that we could actually run (it was on point, involved no libel, and actually delivered useful information about the restaurant). Also, it is way funny: When the delivery man shouted &quot;Chinese food! Open the door!&quot; into my cell phone (the building&apos;s intercom system is dead-- maybe this guy&apos;s been here before), I felt like he must be bring us something so special and urgently delicious that anything less than my running down five flights of stairs would have been irresponsible to him, me, and my date.

His curt bow of thanks reinforced my feeling that this would be a
no-nonsense meal; the MSG-laden fumes emanating from the plastic bag told me that we could be expect to be pummeled by fists of flavor. Wai Lee was rated 4/5 for value on Menupages yet only $/$$$$ for price, and had a solid 18 reviews. (Note: many reviews doesn&apos;t necessitate popularity. The notorious Saigon Grill has been reviewed 127 times, mostly due to its dodgy treatment of deliverypeople). So here’s my attempt quantify and come to a verdict.

Plusses
+ Guy who answers phone speaks great English. Just as important, he&apos;s a terrific listener. His laser-like focus on your every order is
undeterred by pots and pans crashing in the background. He makes you feel like you are the only person in his world. He&apos;s a Chinese Bill Clinton.
+ Free can of Coke. I don&apos;t even like Coke, but come on people, it&apos;s
free. Too bad I forgot that Coke + rice = tsunami for your stomach.
+ &quot;Bean curd&quot; not euphemistically, Americanistically referred to as
&quot;tofu,&quot; which sounds like a martial art performed only with the tips
of the feet.

Minuses
- No chopsticks. Though I rarely use these ancient implements, their
absence was disappointing on a spiritual level, kind of like going to
the East Village and not seeing any mohawks. Also, how much does bamboo even cost? I recently saw a PBS special on bamboo (I&apos;ve had many lonely Saturday nights), showing how bamboo grows so quickly and plentifully in Southeast Asia that the field rats feeding off it and breed at algorithmic rates--you can actually hear them break the sound barrier when they mate en masse-- can&apos;t quite keep up with the
newly-sprouting shoots of bamboo.
- No fortune cookie. I&apos;m all about cutting back the frills in today&apos;s
economy, but again, how costly could this flour-water-sugar treat be? I saw an episode of NOVA on fortune cookies the other night and--just kidding. Thus not knowing my fortune, I cannot say whether it&apos;s in my future to order from Wai Lee again, whether or not my hearing ever comes back. Aaaaand.... Scene! If only newspaper reviewers were so funny.

 Michael Psilakis Coming To The Viceroy 
 
The New York Post reports that Michael Psilakis and partner Donatella Arpaia, who own Anthos in New York City, will be managing the The Restaurant at Viceroy Miami beginning sometime next month. There&apos;s no name yet, but the Post claims the focus will be on seafood.

A spokesperson for the Viceroy refused to confirm the information, saying that the deal is not yet finalized and that there&apos;s no definite date for the restaurant&apos;s revamping. (It&apos;s currently serving an &quot;interim menu.&quot;) Psilakis is a big name, and he&apos;ll likely do well, although we wonder at the timing—add that month mentioned above plus another one or two months for standard opening delays, and this restaurant should be launching its new concept right as the summer low season begins.

 $5 Footlong Campaign Began In South Florida 
 
 Did you know that the $5-footlong campaign from Subway started in South Florida? We don&apos;t really frequent Broward or Palm Beach Subways, so we weren&apos;t familiar with the local franchises that started it all: That’s because the idea for the promotion came from Boynton Beach-based entrepreneur Steve Sager, who owns franchise rights to all Subway restaurants from Indian River through Broward counties. He also owns 10 of those locations.

In 2007, Sager noticed a slowdown in his restaurants because of the economy.

One store in particular, in Broward County, was struggling.

“I came up with the idea of offering $5 foot-longs all day, every day,” Sager said. “My partner said, ‘You’re nuts,’ and threw the banner I made in the back room for about two months.”

But Sager succeeded in getting the promotion going at the store in October 2007. Within a week of putting up the sign, the store saw sales jump 30 percent, he said. By the end of the month, they had skyrocketed 90 percent. He called Subway&apos;s founder, and the rest is history.

 TV Exposure Really Helps South Florida Chefs 
 
Despite sometimes lagging a behind other large cities in the dining department, South Florida has managed to be well represented in the reality chef TV world, and even if a chef doesn&apos;t do well, it can be a huge boost to his or her career: &apos;I stopped in West Bumble, Texas, on the way back from L.A., and an old lady at a Cracker Barrel said, `I know who you are. I love you,&apos; &apos;&apos; said Josh Wahler, a contestant on the third season of Fox&apos;s Hell&apos;s Kitchen. ``The show was huge for my career.&apos;&apos;

Wahler, 28, went from being a junior sous chef at Nobu in Miami Beach to running the kitchen at 5300 Chop House at the new Blue Resort in Doral. This, even though Hell&apos;s Kitchen host Gordon Ramsay berated him for eight weeks running, then declared him &apos;&apos;f---ing useless&apos;&apos; and kicked him off the show. (&apos;&apos;Didn&apos;t bother me,&apos;&apos; Wahler said.)
 The Herald also has a few tips from former Top Chef and Hell&apos;s Kitchen contestants for those looking to audition for upcoming seasons. And if you&apos;d like to see Top Chef judge Tom Colicchio up close and personal, check out the next Celebrity Chef Series on March 19. Former contestant Jeff McInnis will host the event, where Colicchio will talk about his personal culinary journey and do a cooking demonstration.

 Straight From The Chefs&apos; Mouths 
 
Check out the New Times&apos; restaurant-themed insert this week, called Taste 2009 if you haven&apos;t already. It&apos;s mostly ads with a few recipes interspersed between them, but it&apos;s the interviews with prominent local chefs that are great. The paper talks to Cindy Hutson of Ortanique on the Mile about being self-taught, Allen Susser of Chef Allen&apos;s about reinventing his restaurant, Jonathan Eismann of Pacific Time on how the &quot;pizza-munchers and ice-cream lickers&quot; killed Lincoln Road, Clay Conley of Azul on how Miami compares to other cities where he&apos;s worked, Michael Schwartz of Michael&apos;s Genuine Food&amp;Drink on being local and sustainable (he employs a forager!), and Kris Wessel of Red Light about the state of independent chef-owned and -operated restaurants. It&apos;s a really great read that gives a good sense of what is happening in the Miami dining scene now, and it makes us feel really good about its future.

 Hive Five: Tapas 
 
 Welcome to High Five, a new feature where we let you in on some of the most popular restaurant listings on MenuPages in the past month, as determined by what you (yes you!) click on. Today: the top tapas restaurants in February. 

1. Sra Martinez 
2. El Pimiento 
3. Rincon Espanol Restaurant 
4. El Carajo Tapas&amp;Wine 
4. El Carajo International Tapas&amp;Wine 

No, that&apos;s not a typo—the two El Carajos tied for fourth place with the exact same number of clicks. (We should also note that while they may have been affiliated with each other at the beginning, they most certainly are not anymore.) And as for Sra. Martinez, well that&apos;s hardly a surprise; the restaurant received more than four times as many hits as El Pimiento.

 Exactly How Much Butter Do You Want In Your Chicken? 
 
 If you too are a fan of the butter chicken at Royal India , now you can make it at home . The Sun-Sentinel asked chef/owner Robert Solomon for the recipe, and he obliged. Check out the recipe here . The dish certainly lives up to its name; the recipe given is supposed to be for one (albeit rather large) serving, and it calls for a whole stick of butter.

 Review Of The Week: Disgruntled Employee And Boyfriend Sound Off 
 
Perhaps we&apos;re tipping our hand too much in telling you we can see the IP addresses of those who leave us user reviews. That usually doesn&apos;t mean much, except in the case of this week&apos;s Review Of The Week, which are actually two that we&apos;re pretty sure was left by a disgruntled employee and her boyfriend.

Either that, or one employee at New York&apos;s City Gourmet has an extremely dedicated fan base who all live in the same house.

3/2/09 10:27pm from user &quot;Sam&quot;
 I just can&apos;t take it anymore. I used to eat there in the morning before work. The people who work there just make you want to go somewhere else. It used to be this real sweet girl who used to work there and even she left. I think it time for me to move on also. 

10:32pm from user &quot;Tina&quot;—same IP address as Sam above
 But it could be awhole lot better. I know the girl your talking about. I think they called her Zee. Yea she was real sweet and good to talk to. I don&apos;t know what happen to her. I think they let her go. But anyhow I missed the loved she used to bring to the store. Now it seem cold and it this guy whole works there who think he knows it all. always take my order wrong. Yes, Tina. That man is cold, so cold. What ever happened to poor Zee? You seem to know a lot about her. Maybe you could leave another review and tell us the rest of her story.

 Koi Is Now Sekai 
 
 Coconut Grove Grapevine reports that the new pan-Asian restaurant in the old Señor Frog&apos;s location has changed its name from Koi to Sekai in its first month of existence. It seems there was some confusion about the name; people thought it was linked to the Koi restaurants with branches in Los Angeles , New York , Las Vegas and Bangkok. The Coconut Grove restaurant, obviously, is not related. And you can rule out any affiliation with Red Koi in Coral Gables too.

 The Sad State Of Banh Mi In South Florida 
 
 Helen at MP: Chicago posted earlier this morning about banh mi , the Vietnamese sandwich that is becoming increasingly popular in Chicago and New York, which got us thinking about the nonexistent state of this sandwich in South Florida. We expected the find-a-food search to turn up empty, but to our surprise, we got two hits for banh mi:

• Pho Hoa in Tamarac: It&apos;s a national Vietnamese chain that focuses, as one might imagine, on pho, not sandwiches. The &quot;banh mi&quot; listed on the menu is a carrot beef stew that you can get with a baguette or noodles.

• Saigon Cuisine in Margate: There&apos;s an appetizer of banh mi with pork meatballs and an entree of &quot;bo kho and banh mi,&quot; or Vietnamese beef stew with bread.

And that&apos;s it. Is the state of the banh mi really so dire in South Florida, or did we miss some place? There&apos;s no reason that sandwich couldn&apos;t do well down here.
