Designed to look and operate just like the real machine. Radio crystals inside the hand controller and receiver limit communication to only the specified frequency. This means less interference from outside electrical sources. Radio crystals also extend the distance of operation. The loader operates just like the real machine. There is a separate control for independent bucket dump and rollback. The large hand controller operates the forward, reverse and turning functions as well as raising and lowering the booms. Front and rear lights function when the controller levers or buttons are activated. The T190 is powered by a rechargeable 7.2v battery pack. The hand controller, battery, charger, and a 9v battery for the hand controller, are packaged with each unit. Approx. size 12 1/2&quot; long to the bucket and 7 1/2&quot; high. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR OUTDOOR USE, NOT RECOMMENDED FOR CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 8 YEARS OLD Less

Ultimate Performance. If your forced induction or built 2005-2010 Mustang GT delivers massive horsepower and torque but needs a clutch that will let your Pony run with the herd on the street, a SPEC Stage 3+ is the clutch for you. Blending performance with drivability, the Stage 3+ combines the type of compound used in the Stage 3 Clutch to deliver a clutch capable of handling up to 850 ft-lb of torque, but a full-faced disc design means there is less of the &quot;on-off&quot; feel associated with true race-only clutches. Street and Strip. The SPEC Stage 3+ Clutches are designed to be the perfect clutch for a high powered street or race car. Unlike other pure &quot;race type&quot; clutches, the pedal feel of the 3+ is still worthy of the strip, but not so unforgiving as a &quot;puck style&quot;. Combining elements of a race clutch with a street clutch means a Stage 3+ will hold up to many passes on the strip while still letting you drive your Pony to and from the track. Premium Quality.
