Nice big park with pretty views.
Middle of the day is when its quietest and super busy at the weekends with everybody taking their pups for walks.

Some very nice people bring their pets here and are nice to chat to while the pups play.

Went once on a Saturday in May.

The three stars is because I was not thrilled with the fence.  The fence is the kind I had during college in my own yard and was all I could afford.  Its the kind that is metal rectangles where metal grids can come undone and stick out -- eek -- into a dogs eye.  Due to the weeds  could not see if there were holes or pieces sticking out.  It also had gaps at the bottom which is bad for the tiny dogs.  I expect at least a cyclone fence (or better) from a city/county dog park.  For what its worth, as of this review, I have been to 31 dog parks so I am accustomed to what is the norm at dog parks.

The skinny......

Seal Point Dog Park is located in a &quot;Powerline Park&quot; (see photos). You know the tall power lines that stretch for miles? It is a good use of open land that is not suitable for housing.

The dog park has a small dog section and an all dog section.
Double-gates.
Super easy to get to off the highway.
Good parking.
Fresh water -- but you have to go out of the park to refresh the water.
It has shade structures with benches, trash cans, restrooms....everything you need.

Maybe it was the day I was there and did not get the best first impression, or could not see well in the glare, or that I had to run from end to end to keep up with my dog who was new to that park, a puppy, and looking at *everything*.   There is also two sets of gates in the small dog section to watch.  I never like having to watch my dog so he does not get stolen out of two sets of gates.

Some people could not figure out to come in the first gate and shut it before opening the second gate.  Of course, they also had their closest 12 relatives with them in tow (that is when all hell breaks loose because grandma leaves the gate wide open).  Amazing that I have to explain what seems obvious:   SHUT the first gate and THEN open the second gate.  That is ONE reason the double gates are there....no escapes.  The other reason is for unleashing BEFORE you get into an off-leash area.

Am I picky?  Sure.  Should I be?  Hell yes.  We go to dog park *everyday*.  Our chances of injury are higher - and well, its just not that hard to read the rules and follow them.  Some things are not so obvious (ie: leash aggression in an off-leash dog park) so TALK to people....get to know how to be at dog park.  Most people are more than happy to explain what they know.

I can see why people like it.  I like what it looks like.....and its right off the freeway.  I think if I had a bigger dog maybe I would have liked it better (mine is 15 lbs.).

We bailed early and went over to the Central Park Fremont Dog Park instead.  Had an AWESOME, wicked good time......as always.

*Note*

This is a review I did back in 10/2008 but like a dumbass posted it and the photos to the wrong establishment, called out by another Yelper.  So thanks for the heads up!

I&apos;m all for dog parks.  I don&apos;t care if they are concrete, dirt, grass, fake turf, seaweed, rocky, iced, sandy.....as long as the material is walkable, let&apos;s have a hurray for towns that are able to provide public access for people and their furry friends.  We have access to trails.  Let the dogs have access to a park all their own.

I had an interview in the area and of course did not get the job (it was a conspiracy among Asians : basically if you are younger, cuter, and thinner than the hiring group of chubby 40 something pushing 50 ugly people, you will never ever get the job) but on a follow-up where I drove all the way up to the darn place to drop off thank you cards, I decided to stop and let my pooch out for a quick romp.

Now, usually I take her to Pt. Isabel where a wide area is well maintained with nice grass;  Foster City Dog Park is actually all dirt/gravel with only fake grass mats for the smaller dogs in their fenced in area.  I was not in there but could only imagine what it must smell like.  I was lucky in that my pooch gets along with all dogs, small or large, so I set her loose.  The walking area is actually paved for the human owners so we could keep an eye on our furry little rascals.  I noticed most people picked up after their dogs otherwise incur the wrath of responsibles such as myself.

The area is located underneath massive power lines so if anything fell, we would have all been dead within seconds.  However, I was in love with the little fire hydrants lined up for the urine cycle and the rest area was well covered with an overhang.  The people here with their dogs were friendly and made conversations as our dogs hung out and did the customary rear salutations.

Once outside the security gates, there is a clean concrete area with water faucets for the dogs as well as their humans.  There is also a nice path running parallel to the dog park where I saw several cute guys jogging by on their lunch breaks.  I can see that the city does a great job in keeping this well maintained as well as clean and efficient.  Of course on a hot day the smells might become overwhelming, but such are the hazards of being humans to our furry friends who don&apos;t have access to their own type of toilets.  I&apos;m impressed with Foster City.

Great public location for locals to utilize and thanks to the city for adding a little part of land for our furry friends!

I would give this 3.5 if I could.

pros
1. small dog area and large dog area
2. doggie poo bags
3. nice to have an area for your dog to be off leash

cons
1. dirt - no grass anywhere.  Your dog will get dirty.  I usually take pooch here right before I give her a bath.
2. very windy.  For some reason, each time I&apos;ve been here it has been super windy.  Not sure if it&apos;s the location by the water or just the weather.
3. people are not very good about picking up after their dogs and even though there are poo bags, there&apos;s still piles of poo in the area. NOT Cool.
4. Some of the dogs here are not friendly and really should have a muzzle.

I love this place! It is absolutely enormous!

There is a definite difference from Seal Point Park and the Seal Point Dog Park, I know a lot of reviewers are saying its for people too - not the dog park area. Please don&apos;t bring your small children for a stroll in here, they will get run over!

There is a parking lot outside the gate and a hose station at the entrance with bowls and such. It&apos;s great if you need to hose your dog down too!

There are some picnic tables and seats throughout the area - just a ton of space!! The only real downside is that it is all dirt, no grass. So if it has been raining, you might not want to come down here unless you are ready to bring home a muddy dog!

Pretty much all the owners I&apos;ve met have been super friendly and the only time I had a problem with an aggressive dog, it was entirely my fault. I wanted to take a stroll through the big dog area with my little pug because it looked pretty empty, but there was a dog at the other end of the park that I didn&apos;t see and he didn&apos;t appreciate a tiny running dog. I had to pick up my dog and scoot out of there, but the other was awesome and was right on top of her dog too.

If this park had grass or astroturf, it would be just about perfect. It is HUGE, the largest enclosed dog park I&apos;ve ever been to and it has all sorts of interesting terrain/things to keep dogs interested.  I thought the fire hydrants were a cute touch.  I went during the middle of the day on a weekday so it was fairly quiet, I&apos;m sure this place gets super busy on the weekends.  The people and the dogs were all pretty friendly.

Like everyone says, it gets windy here and having lived in the bay area almost my entire life, I&apos;m guessing it&apos;s pretty much always windy here bc of the location.  It&apos;s set close the the Bay, you can see the San Mateo bridge and planes from SFO.

Bring a towel with you to wipe down balls that will pick up dirt and to wipe down your pooch&apos;s mouth, he will get dirt on his nose and inside his mouth if he likes balls.

I&apos;ll def be back to explore the other parts of the park, looks like a great place for a run or hike.

The views are great here but I think at times I&apos;d prefer artificial turf over dirt. Maybe I caught an off day but I was a bit taken back by what I saw at this park. Piles of dog poop just sitting there and owners nonchalantly NOT watching their dogs poop and walking away.

Owners to me at least seem more responsible at the Foster City park because I see rarely see piles of dog poop there. Owners do also watch out for their dogs a bit more as well.

The fountain is cool since you can operate the lower ones with your foot. No read need to bring a bowl if the dog can drink straight from the fountain. May return one day.

This place doesn&apos;t look like much from the street.  Though Yelp lists it as a dog park, there&apos;s more to the place than that.  It&apos;s a nice place for humans, too.

We came here recently for a picnic.  This is one of the few hilly spots right on the SF Bay, so you get a lovely view of the bay, Coyote Point, the Oakland and SF skylines, and many other sights.  There are a few funky sculptures on the hilltops, plus many walking trails.

There aren&apos;t any trees here.  On a windy day, it&apos;s not too pleasant.  Come when it&apos;s warm and sunny, and you won&apos;t be in a hurry to leave.

When we&apos;ve taken our well behaved, small terrier to Seal Point in San Mateo, we have unfortunately have had to deal with the following: 1. a kid on a self-propelling skateboard inside the small dog park and the useless parent who stood around and didn&apos;t discipline him, 2. an unsupervised, eight year old running after and antagonizing the smaller dogs in the small dog area, and again, the parent just standing around and not doing squat  -- but note, if your dog bites the stupid kid, it&apos;s YOUR dog&apos;s fault, not the stupid kid or the lazy parent, 3. aggressive, weird owners who pick fights and yell at other dog owners for all sorts of random weirdness like not picking up their dog&apos;s poo &quot;fast enough&quot; (yes, this sounds crazy, but we&apos;ve witnessed grown adults have screaming matches over how fast they can need to pull dog shit duty), and 4. thug life/stripper types with unneutured pit bulls who roam around, not monitoring their dogs, posing like they are &quot;so tough&quot;. All of the aforementioned is unfortunately true and has happened... We never know what to expect when we go there and it&apos;s not a feeling we relish.

Overall, even though the space is large and free, it really is not very well taken care of or monitored in any any way, shape or form. The best way to take advantage of the space is to take your dog for a run up and around the park with light socializing inside the dog park itself.... otherwise, it is an unpredictable space with odd energy/people.

Perhaps it is the massive, powerful electrical towers that affect people and cause such weirdness? Whose to say. Again, it can be fun to take your dog to such a large, free space, but you do so at your own risk.

I highly recommend Mitchell Dog Park or Burlingame Dog Park, on Airport Blvd., for a more relaxed, safe experience.

Love it!

My dog gets so excited in the car when we pull into this place that she cries in excitement and can&apos;t contain herself. I am usually unimpressed with most dog parks because they are small, dirty or just simply, an eye sore. This place is very much the opposite. This place is enormous and pretty! There are two areas open for small dogs and big dogs. I like that they are separated because I am always worried about my little Lily getting trampled on or hurt. There&apos;s tons of open space for the dogs to run around and I have found that for the most part people generally pick up well after themselves.

Not only is this a great place for dogs but also for people! It has bike and hiking trails as well as a beautiful view once you climb over the hill that is set aside the park. There&apos;s tons of open space and lots of parking available. I highly recommend this place (and so does Lily)!

I first discovered this dog park through my BFF, we did a doggie playdate here.  It&apos;s so big!  The small dog section is separated from the big dog section and there is a nice water station between the two entrances.  My dog likes coming here because there is plenty of space for her to run around and meet new doggies while still investigate surroundings on her own without feeling crowded.

As a dog owner with a dog that can handle herself with small and big dogs, I always appreciate coming to dog parks that cater to small and big dogs because a lot of dog owners are not always comfortable with their little doggie being around the big ones.  I&apos;ve never seen any scuffles or bad situations between the small and the big dogs and all the owners have been pretty friendly.  There are trails around the park, some that lead down by the water, which make for a very nice, scenic afternoon with your pet.  Everytime I bring my dog here, I feel like she experiences soemhing new and fun!  :)

Seal Point Dog Park is like a second home for my Chihuahua mix, my boyfriend and I.  There are so many things we love about this park.

We start out our visit by taking a nice leasurly walk on one of the trails called the &apos;wind walk&apos; which has sculptures along the trail that chime and spin in the wind.  We enjoy the beautiful view of the bay as well.  This walk gets our little entergetic guy focused so he can play nicely with the other dogs. (It&apos;s our little dog whisper trick, thank you Cesar Milan!!)

Then its off to the little dog section, which is actually quite a big area.   Our doggy is then able to play to his hearts content.  He has  learned how to sociallize quite well since bringing him to Seal Point.  It has taken some time because he was a rescue with very little socialization, but he and most other dogs I encounter do great here.  I&apos;m sure the mellow upbeat atmosphere helps.  Of course like all dog parks, it makes sense to supervise your dog and take a break if you feel there is an overly aggressive dog or an unresponsible owner, which certainly can happen from time to time.

Other points:

I am not a large dog owner so have no experience with the large dog area, but I can say that it is a very large area and I see a lot of dogs running and playing quite well. A word of caution; even though it is common practice for people to take their smalll dogs into the large dog area, I would advise against it.  I have seen some squirmishes that could have been dangerous if a small dog was involved.  I have also stories of small dogs being pinned down and hurt, even just in innocent play.

There are decent bathrooms near the dog park and at different points a long the trail.  There is pleanty of parking and a nice faucet area to clean off dogs and water up. There are dog clean up bags as well.

The fire hydrents inside the park are a cute touch.  There are also some shaded benches near the back end of the park.

I took my dog here today for the second time.  My dog is a very mild mannered, happy go lucky pug.  He gets along with other dogs, doesn&apos;t bother them, and doesn&apos;t bark at all when he is at the dog park.

Regretfully, there are several dog owners at Seal Point who aren&apos;t responsible.

Today my dog was attacked by another dog.  The other dog nipped him twice and was aggressively chasing and barking at my dog.  The other dog was very aggressive and was this way with other dogs as well.

The owner could care less. I told her she should&apos;t bring her dog her if he acts this way.  She didn&apos;t care.  Her friend who was also there said he comes everyday.  If you see him and his white Chihuahua STAY AWAY.  He thought the other dog attacking my dog was fine. And I quote &quot;Some dogs don&apos;t like other dogs, just like people.  This dog is just aggressive&quot;.

If you don&apos;t want your dog to get attacked, don&apos;t bring them here.

I also took my dog in the large dog are and had no issue.  The owners there seem more responsible.  .

Anyone who reads this and brings there dog there, hopefully you are more responsible then these two people.  It only takes one incident to shut down the park, then you&apos;ve ruined it for everyone else.

Overall, the park is scenic.  I like it because you can use the small and large dog area and there is also a walking trail.  There is water and poop bags, but other parks have that as well.  However, my dog getting injured doesn&apos;t make the scenic park worth it.

This is the best dog park that I have been to in the Bay Area. My Saint is as happy as can be and greets all of the other dogs.

There&apos;s a small dog area and a big dog area, though I have seen some small dogs come into the big dog side... then their owners get upset that the big dogs are running after their dogs. Hello? You&apos;re on the wrong side?! Anyhow...

There are doggie bags all around the park and there&apos;s several water fountains for the canines to drink out of.

It really is an amazing place to be with your dog, and it makes it all the more better that the other owners are so friendly.

Beautiful Beautiful Beautiful place.

The weather has been so gorgeous lately, and finally both my boyfriend&amp;my schedule has freed up. We decided to walk our pup and pug out, get them to socialize. They&apos;re both chickens, 5 pound maltipom, 40 pound pug(DONT ASK). The maltipom actuall beats up on the pug.. So yeah, chickens for you.

Our babies refused to be social.. So we ended up sitting with some doggy lovers. Some were overly friendly, yet some were overly aggressive. We decided to go walk on the trail up to where the view was. It was right around sunset, perfect weather, perfect lighting, perfect timing. Both of them were dead tired while we sat to enjoy the view. We decided to head home and they fell right to sleep. Good day.

My dog had lots of fun here. There is plenty of space for dogs to run and many friendly dogs and owners. The only reason it&apos;s getting four stars instead of five is because there is no grass. However it is a good park to tire out your dog.

Why I&apos;m a fan:
-Easy to get to off 101, 3rd ave exit.
-There&apos;s a small dog area and a large dog area. My pup is still getting used to dog parks and I like the option of the small dog area in case it&apos;s too overwhelming with the big dogs. i don&apos;t mind the lack of grass inside the fenced in areas and i don&apos;t think my pup minds either.
-They have poop bags.
-There are also several trails overlooking the bay with great scenery for you to soak in
-well maintained area and bathrooms and not stinky

LOVE THIS PLACE! Well actually my dog Samson loves this place =) The area for large dogs is huge and there are always plenty of other dogs to play with. It is very clean with a poop bag dispenser, water filling station, and places for owners to sit and enjoy some puppy play time. It is a great place for Samson to socialize and meet other dogs of all shapes and sizes. No complaints here as Samson has been snoozing for the last couple of hours after a fun time at Seal Point Dog Park.

Lovely park. Ample space to run, the best in the area by far. Could use more greenery.

Your experience will vary according to the types of people and dogs there that day.

IDKWTF moment: last time I went, a father and his 2 young children (read: toddlers) were in the big dog area playing soccer, running and screaming with no apparent dog in tow. Dogs largely ignored them, but I wanted to shake him and say, &quot;Can you be more stupid?&quot;

Also, little dog people, please stay on the little dog side. Even if your little dog &quot;thinks he&apos;s a big dog.&quot; That&apos;s why it&apos;s there. That way your dog isn&apos;t shaking in fear when the horde of big dogs come roaming by. I see this happy every day. Big dogs can mistake little dogs for prey. I used to have 2 little dogs and yes they preferred the big section, but it just was not safe. You&apos;ve been warned.

WOW, talk about dog heaven. This is one of the largest dog parks I&apos;ve ever been to and I used to think the one in Foster City was pretty darn big! I&apos;ve been to quite a few dog parks although I don&apos;t have a dog, but I accompany people here while they exercise *their* dogs.

If you drive up one level, there is an area where you can go for a walk -- like me, who doesn&apos;t have a dog -- and from up there, you can totally see how big this dog park truly is!!

The rangers are quite efficient here -- my cousin lost her car keys and the rangers found them for her!

For everybody: This dog park is actually pretty good. No grass is okay with me. Busy during peak hours and a grassy hill to walk on afterwards. Parking is a breeze and finding it from the freeway is even easier. Not enough trashcans and bags for the size of the place.

To the owner of the German Sheppard who bit our innocent cattle dog yesterday: Your irresponsibility of not watching your aggressive dog angers me greatly. You shouldn&apos;t be allowed to bring your dog to the park, as you ruin it for everybody. As soon as my dog screamed her bloody head off, and started limping, you should have been right there to pull your dog off mine and take it out of the park immediately. Instead you are nowhere to be found but I suspect your one of the old men on cell phones ignoring the situation and sitting on the giant electrical tower base. You are so irresponsible it makes me sick.

As somebody who goes to a dog park EVERYDAY with their dog, even in the rain, I have never seen somebody so negligent. This wasn&apos;t normal behavior, your dog attacked mine. No play bow, no smelling, no aggressive stance. Mine was simply running and chasing a ball and your dog decided &quot;No - I won&apos;t allow that&quot; charge and then bit her hard on the back. You are soooo lucky it didn&apos;t draw blood. Why don&apos;t you get off your cell phone and watch your aggressive dog?

Fort Funston is sooooo much better.

This park is located at about 1701 East 3rd Ave in San Mateo between  Newbridge Ave and Detroit Drive. There are two entrances to the dog park. One is in the parking lot near the ranger station and the other is on the street across from Detroit Drive. If coming from 101 you have to take the first left turning lane available after the road curves to the right - otherwise take a RIGHT on Detroit Drive and then a U-turn near the cement plant.

North Dog Park enterance http://maps.google.com/m… 

This park could easily get 5 stars from me if it fixed a few major issues. This is a VERY large dog park, possibly larger than Sigmund Grove Dog park in SF!! I&apos;d guess that it takes 5+ minutes to walk end to end.

-1 Star for:

Water dispensers are only at one end of the park. If you enter this park at the Detroit Drive side then you are completely out of luck and must walk all the way to the other end to get a drink. Whats worse is that the water is located outside the Dog enclosure so you must leash up and go into the parking lot every time!

Poop bag dispenser is on the farthest end of the park. If your pooch decides to poop in the middle of his play time which happens to be in the middle of the park its a long walk back to get a bag and by then you will forget where it was! I know this can be remedied by bringing a bag with you but most other dog parks dont have this issue.

During certain times of the year the bacteria in the bay let off a very potent sulfur smell. While visiting the souther end of the dog park this smell is extreme and sometimes overpowering (causing people to gag).

There is a stop sign at the entrance of the round about. The point of a round about is that you DON&apos;T need to stop!

Bike riders like to use up many of the spots in the dog park lot. They don&apos;t seem to know there is a lot nearly twice the size right near the entrance.

With all the complaints aside I will still visit and enjoy this park. It is large enough to handle 50 dogs not including the separate area for smaller dogs at the north end of the park.

Bring some toys to donate to the park! The last few times I went there was only 2 balls in the whole park :(

The entrance can be easy to miss and then you have to drive down several blocks before you can turn around, so keep a look out for it.

Seal Point Dog Park RULES!!! It was my first time ever at a dog park and I had such a great time with my pomeranian Tater Tot. I was sorta nervous because Tater has never been to a dog park and I was afraid he might not get along with all the dogs, but he absolutely loved it and made tons and tons of new friends.

Don&apos;t be nervous to bring your pup to Seal Point! Sometimes Tater can be feisty on walks, but being off-leash in the small dog area was no problem. He occasionally wandered over to the gate between the small dog area and the big dog section and barked at the bigger doggies (Tater&apos;s a little dude and barking makes him feel more manly) but other than that he was cool as a cucumber.

PLUS you get to meet and mingle with other dog lovers...and let&apos;s be honest, dog people are the best kind of people. I can&apos;t wait to start coming to Seal Point regularly for Tater to play!

Impressions:

Area is not just for people with dogs. There is a nicely maintained paved trail for all.

Very cool sculptures that move and make charming noises.

Clean and well situated by the Bay.

A beautiful people-sized suspension bridge.

Today we were there with the sunset and we had none of the regular wind but all of the ambiance.

If you have the time, sit in front of one of the moving air sculptures and listen to the chimes activate as the sculpture moves in the breeze. Then gaze out at the water and just de-stress.

Seal Point Dog Park is the best dog park on the Peninsula because it&apos;s enclosed, there&apos;s a separate play area for big and little dogs and there&apos;s real grass.

The best time to go is in the afternoon around 4pm (M-F). If you go any earlier, Fido may or may not have any four-legged friends to play with. Weekends when the weather is nice are always crowded with lots of dogs, which makes for lots of fun. Make sure to bring a sweater for your small dog, because in the late afternoon, it can be windy and cold.

If you want to take your dog for a walk outside of the enclosed play areas, there&apos;s a nice trail along the bay (one goes toward Foster City and the other goes to Coyote Point), as well as one that goes up from the parking lot to a high plateau where you can hear the air traffic control directing incoming planes to SFO.

Doggies galore.  Dg fenced lots for smaller types and big dogs alike.  Mind your pets like you&apos;d bus your own table.  Simple and to the point.  Closes daily at 6:45pm.

I shadowed my nephew and niece when they took their beautiful dog out here yesterday. We hiked up to the top where it becomes a park of kinetic stainless steel sculptures sprinkled about. On clearer days, you command fine views from the City to the San Mateo Bridge&amp;beyond.  Also some cool&amp;easy geocaches for you geeks.

I asked Sato what he thought about the Seal Point Dog Park, and he said &quot;......&quot;

Alright, so he&apos;s a dog and can&apos;t tell me what he thought, but I could tell by his wiggly butt and ear to ear grin that he had a kick ass time!

This park is HUGE!  There&apos;s not much to look at inside except a covered area with some benches and  a walkway down the middle.  There&apos;s no grass to speak of, only dirt, dirt, dirt.  One thing is for sure, you will always know where your dog is because there&apos;s no place for them to hide.

There was a plethora of tennis balls everywhere.  There was also a shit-load of...well, shit!  I would give this place 5 stars, but the mass quantities of dog doodie was crazy!  I guess people don&apos;t pick up poop on the peninsula?!

I like the large space for Sato to get his roam on.  I like that he can go balls out running and not run out of room.  I also like that they segregate - I mean - they have a separate area for the large hairy rats (AKA small dogs).  It&apos;s nice to keep the little dogs with the Napoleon complexes in a space of their own...and they say Pit bulls are vicious!!

This is a great dog park for puppies, small dogs, medium and big dogs and humans alike. The park has two fenced enclosures - a small dog park and a big dog park. It is the largest fenced in dog park in the Peninsula. Parking is fairly easy. If you and your dogs don&apos;t feel like socializing, then just go up the hill, take in the beautiful bay view and walk along the Bay.

We are so lucky to live in this area...

loved it!! my dog kiro had a great time playing around. This was my first time there but when i went it was a great experience.  I feel like the other people there were pretty resonsible.  I didn&apos;t have to worry about my dog being attacked like another dog park that i know of.

my dog loved both the big dog section and little.  It was all dirt, but the only thing that really got me were those prickly weeds that like to stick on your tennis ball....ouch!!

but other than that great experience..if it wasn&apos;t sooo far from me, i&apos;d bring my dog there all the time!!

This is a great park, Its open and easy to remove your dog from a group if needed. Beware, there is a man who likes to stalk the perimeter and taunt dogs in the park with 2 aggressive pits. one gray, one white.

My 1st time yesterday! Its a really nice park for dogs, point is &quot;DOG PARK&quot; not HUMAN than DOG Park. The pups were having so much fun and I like how there is a section of smaller dogs.

I understand why there would be poop everywhere, most owners wouldn&apos;t know when and where their dogs go understandable.

I know the idea of picking up for someones dog isn&apos;t the great thing, but hey it helps out the dog community. YES I know its nasty but its not so bad.

Meh. This place is NOT that big, takes about 3 minutes to walk the whole thing and it has nothing for the dogs to do but play with other dogs and run. It&apos;s nothing but dirt, so in the winter it&apos;s also mud. This is not a place to bring a dog who&apos;s a housedog, unless you plan on giving a bath afterwards. I didn&apos;t notice any more poop here than anywhere else. Dog owners were are open and friendly. The drinking station is smart with a nice drain so it&apos;s not all muddy and disgusting, but it is at the entrance to the park.

While there is nothing green whatsoever, and nothing to explore, my pup still had great time for awhile because there are so many dogs to play with. He did get bored and just started laying around within about an hour.  Good for the occasional visit, but would get old quick.  I think people confuse this one with the Burlingame dog park because both are off coastline. (While the Burlingame dog park smells of sewage, because it&apos;s literally next door to the treatment plant, the amount of trees, shrubs and hillside stuff for dogs to explore is vastly superior to this park.)  If you live close-by it&apos;s okay, but don&apos;t make a special trip for this one.

Meh. This place is huge by comparison to every other dog park I&apos;ve ever been to. However, and perhaps I&apos;ve been jaded, but we typically go to St. Mary&apos;s Dog Park in San Francisco where the dog park has grass not some barren desert. Though huge, this place is depressing.

This place was completely dirt, pebbles and rocks. If we needed to find our dog we just had to look for a cloud of dust to figure which way he is running. The dogs weren&apos;t very dirty afterwards, but our balls were. We ended up throwing them out. I&apos;m glad this area exists, but it could be so much more.

On a more positive note, up on the horizon of the hill we saw bunnies happily bouncing around, and the fire hydrants are hilarious.

This is a great dog park! Big dog and small dog area (there were a LOT of little dogs), bathrooms, water fountains, a hose, water bowls, poop bags, a shaded bench area and trash bins big enough to hold bags for days.  The city of San Mateo did a great job with this.

There were lots of dogs and their owners there, but we noticed a lot of poop laying around.  Hmm... Not sure what that was about.  I even witnessed some people watch their dog poop and not pick it up. &quot;Um, excuse me.  Do you need a bag? There are some right THERE at the gate.&quot;

The dog park is also surrounded by trails and grassy hillsides. After the dog park, I couldn&apos;t resist taking the pups up to the hillside to snap some shots of them in the grass.

It&apos;s a little windy here (which is great because it helps keeps the poop/pee pee smell to a minimum) so if you go, bring a windbreaker, sunglasses and tie your hair back if you have long hair ;)
We&apos;ll be back!

Nothing beats all the amazing parks, beaches and forested areas for dogs in San Francisco -- the sheer number of places, and almost every one spectacular! -- probably unequaled in the U.S. and maybe the world (IMHO).  However, as far as dog parks on the Peninsula&amp;the South Bay go, and I&apos;ve been to at least a dozen, Seal Point wins hands down.  Just the size alone, plus how it is laid out, plus where it&apos;s located with access to the cool Bay breezes makes it special, but also it definitely is a place where the city planners actually took the time to RESEARCH to find out what makes a good dog park.  I can&apos;t tell you the countless parks in this area that have so little thought put into them, it&apos;s embarrassing.  Why spend all the money if you&apos;re not going to do it right?

At Seal Point, there is plenty of parking, doggie bags, water fountains, places to sit, bathrooms for humans, and access to the walk along the Bay which can be so spectacular.  All dogs can go into the large area; but if you want to keep your small dog apart from the large, there is a designated small dog area that is larger than some large dog areas at other parks.  Also, the park ranger&apos;s office is nearby, which is helpful in case there is a question or an emergency.

The other well-known parks on the Peninsula&amp;South Bay just don&apos;t cut it compared to Seal Point, and I&apos;m referring to Mountain View, Shore Dogs (Redwood Shores), Reed Street (Santa Clara), Las Palmas (Sunnyvale), Mitchell Park (Palo Alto) and pretty much any of the parks in San Jose.  (Foster City can use some improvement, but get points for being open until 10pm, and plenty of parking.)

Plain and simple, none have the same intelligent planning or care as Seal Point.

More than that, the City of San Mateo has set up four other fenced areas in various parks around town where you can take your dogs, as alternative places.  Although not as nice as Seal Point, it&apos;s great that they have them in case people want a place closer to where they live.

Very large kudos to the city planners of San Mateo -- I am very impressed.  Not only a well-done downtown, but terrific parks, too.

It&apos;s nice that they have separate big dog/small dog areas and also have a gate to get from one to the other without leaving the park.

It&apos;s not so nice that there isn&apos;t much grass and there are several electric towers right in the middle.

You can get some pretty nice views of the bay if you go to the far end of the big dog park and there&apos;s a nice trail close by that you can take your dogs on if you aren&apos;t a fan of the park.

They do have doggie bags available and some shade/seats.  Not a bad park at all but it would be WAY better if there were some grassy areas.

Doggie desert this is...

Maybe, if there were an oasis...

Maybe, if there were some trees...

Maybe, if there were some brush...

This place is totally barren!  Just dirt, Dirt, and more DIRT!  A path winds down the middle from the one end of the park to the other.  There are two entrances, one at each end.

It was a nice sunny day when I introduced Fozzie here.  There were lots of balls tossed about but my dog knows his own and will not retrieve another dogs ball.

Fine points about this dog park is :

- this is two parks separated for small and large dogs.
- poop bags were available at designated stations.
- water bowls or fountain were available along the walk.
- there is a small shaded area with some seating.
- dog owners tend to pick-up after their dog.
- area wise this dog park is huge.
- there are hydrants galore for your dog (or you for that matter.  ha-ha)

Wishful thinking...  It would be nice to have someplace for poochy to swim.
