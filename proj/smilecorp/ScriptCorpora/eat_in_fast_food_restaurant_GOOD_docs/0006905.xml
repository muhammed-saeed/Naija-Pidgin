Attorney disbarred, ordered to jail for ethics violations

NASHVILLE — A Nashville attorney has been disbarred and ordered to serve jail time over contempt charges and several allegations that he mistreated clients.

The Tennessee Supreme Court disbarred Michael Sneed for numerous ethical violations and ordered him to serve 50 days in jail for criminal contempt because he disobeyed a court order to stop practicing law after a suspension last year.

Sneed, reached by phone Tuesday, said he didn’t believe the complaints against him had any merit and he plans to proceed with a federal suit that says he was improperly suspended and his constitutional rights were violated.

So 50 days is supposed to be a big, harsh penalty for a pettifogger?

I wonder what&apos;ll happen after those 50 days are served, that he continues to practice law, even though he&apos;s been disbarred? Anyway, he can always start a new career now. Let&apos;s see, he can go to work as a grill cook at a McDonald&apos;s or other local fast food restaurant, dishwasher, grill cook or busser for a local sit down restaurant, Greet people or stock shelves at a local Wal-Mart, stock shelves or bag groceries at a local grocery store, build cars on an assembly line at a factory,unload/load shelves in a warehouse,pick up garbage along on a highway, work in a landfill or dump, or dig ditches.

Since you can be a self professed criminal and still be the law director for Knox county, maybe he could try for that.

I guess he could do that. I wonder why they&apos;ve not went ahead and disbarred Herbert Moncier as well? People are entitled to the honest, ethical lawyer available, but there are too many foxes in the chicken houses.

Oh yeah....The Tennessee Supreme Court dsbarred him for ethical violations?

Shoot...everyone of those Judges on that Court violated some ethics to get elected.

Talk about throwing stones from a glass house...but at least when the Court Justices do it they get a benefit from it like the victim is a&quot;sacrificial lamb&quot;that makes those Justices appear to really give a damn about doing the right thing.

Wise men?....self professed.
