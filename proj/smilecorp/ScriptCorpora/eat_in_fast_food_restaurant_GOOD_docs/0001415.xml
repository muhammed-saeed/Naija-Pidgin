What convictions automatically place you on a pova list ?

I many years ago was arrested and taken to court for credit card fraud, does this automatically place me on a pova , and list 99 , ,,, i haven&apos;t re-offended in 20 years would that make a difference ,

and yes i am ashamed , but back then i was young and naive

List 99 is a list of adults who are prevented from working with children. Convictions for the following offences will automatically place you on List 99. 1) A serious sexual offence committed against a child under the age of 16. 2) Possessing indecent photographs of children. Credit card fraud does not place you on List 99.

It wouldn&apos;t put you on the POVA (Protection of Vulnerable Adults) list either. But as others have already told you, your conviction will show up. Certain jobs (including care work) are exempt from the Rehabilitation Of Offenders Act 1974 so spent convictions do show up on the enhanced CRB.

If you have been honest with your potential employer&amp;declared it on your application then he/she may still consider your subsequent good character&amp;employ you on an extended trial basis. I suspect you haven&apos;t declared it so chances are when your CRB comes back they may decline to employ you. Honesty is always the best policy in these cases&amp;in future you should be up front about your past.

No - you won&apos;t be included. It&apos;s unlikely to cause you any major problems, provided you&apos;re upfront and honest about it on job applications and at interview etc.

**Dont know who gave my answer a thumbs down or why but just to point out that CRB / POVA and POCA / checks run completely separately to CRBs (now overseen by Independent Safeguarding Authority)

CRBs check only for cautions, convictions, reprimands etc. They dont hold information about someone whose working practices, known associates or work history is of serious concern and places vulnerable adults or children at risk.

A person could still be considered unsuitable to work with vulnerable adults or with children and included on this register - even if they were not cautioned or convicted of anything. Thats the idea behind it.

It will still show up on an Enhanced CRB check. No idea what a list 99 is.

POVA register shows up if you have assaulted/abused a vulnerable person.

Nothing else will show on a POVA check but your arrest will come up on your CRB disclosure.
