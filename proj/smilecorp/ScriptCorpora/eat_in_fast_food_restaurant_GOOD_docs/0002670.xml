 *The author RHJ sent 
 the manuscript of 
 this book for 
 criticism to a 
 friend who returned 
 it with the 
 notation. It 
 Works. This 
 judgment born of 
 experience was 
 adopted as the title 
 of the book 
 Publishers 1926 

      Table 
 of Contents    Book Excerpt 

 The book It Works was 
 originally published 
 in 1926, and is 
 reported to have 
 immediately risen to 
 sales of over 
 1,000,000 as people 
 were hungry for the 
 information that 
 could help them to 
 make their dreams 
 come true. In this 
 expanded version, 
 some of the examples 
 were updated to fit 
 more with todays 
 times however, 
 humankind has not 
 changed. We still 
 have the same needs, 
 desires, and dreams. 
 In that truth, this 
 information is 
 timeless. 
 
 People are always 
 blaming their circumstances 
 for what they are.
I 
 don&apos;t believe in 
 circumstances.
The 
 people who get on in this 
 world are the people who get 
 up and look for the 
 circumstances they desire.
And if they can&apos;t find 
 them, they make them .
~ George Bernard Shaw ~

 Everything that RHJ 
 says in It Works , actually does work. However, in its 
 simplicity, some 
 people miss the 
 depth of The Plan, 
 as seen in the 
 cartoon included in 
 the book by Sydney 
 Harris. 

 Throughout 
 the book you will 
 find keys, which 
 are excepts from the Simple Keys teachings. These 
 keys are suggestions 
 and exercises to 
 assist you in 
 utilizing the 
 information 
 presented In It Works . 
 The Simple Keys support The 
 Plan and the Three Short Rules. The Keys   assist 
 you in accelerating 
 the achievement, 
 manifestation and 
 receiving process.

 This same 
 information has been 
 repeated over the 
 decades. Quotes from 
 various authors and 
 educators, past and 
 present, are 
 included with the Simple Keys text. 
 Acknowledgements and 
 references are 
 included for each 
 author&apos;s quote used 
 in the text.

 Book 
 excerpts:
      A concise, definite, 
 result-full plan 
 with rules, 
 explanations and 
 suggestions for 
 bettering your 
 condition in 
 life....
   If you are one of 
 these millions of 
 thoughtless talkers 
 or wishers and would 
 like a decided 
 change from your 
 present condition, 
 you can have it; but 
 first of all, you 
 must KNOW what you desire and 
 this is no easy task 
 for some....  
    When you can train your objective, conscious mind (the one you use everyday) to decide 
 definitely upon the 
 things or conditions 
 you desire, you will 
 have taken your 
 first big step in 
 accomplishing or 
 securing what you 
 know you desire .... 
    To get what you desire is no 
 more mysterious or 
 uncertain that the 
 stereo waves all 
 around you....
    Tune in correctly 
 and you get a 
 perfect result, but 
 to do this of 
 course, it is 
 necessary to know 
 something of your 
 equipment and have a 
 plan of operation.
      You 
 have within you a mighty power , 
 anxious and willing 
 to serve you, a 
 power capable of 
 giving you that 
 which you seriously 
 desire . 

 Your objective 
 mind and personal 
 will are so 
 wishy-washy that you
usually only 
 WISH for things and 
 the wonderful,
 capable power 
 within you does not 
 function.
Your 
 Wish simply Washes 
 away in your next 
 breath. 

 
     Most wishes are 
 simply just 
 meaningless words.. 
 Jimmy, the fast food 
 restaurant cashier 
 gave no thought to 
 actually having the 
 red Hummer. Erik, 
 the salesman, was 
 not thinking of any 
 other job or even 
 thinking at all. 
 President Alexander 
 knew he had hay 
 fever and was 
 expecting it. 
 Davids business was 
 quite likely 
 successful and the 
 single mother no 
 doubt had fun with 
 her friends, that 
 day, but they had no 
 fixed ideas of what 
 they really desired 
 for their children 
 to accomplish and 
 were actually 
 helping to being 
 about the same 
 unhappy conditions 
 which existed....

If you are really serious about changing your present condition, here is a concise, definite, result-full plan, with rules,explanations and suggestions. 

Remember, nothing can prevent you from having that which you seriously desire.  
 
Others have these 
 things. Why not 
 you? 
 
 &quot; It&apos;s 
 not that some people 
 have willpower and some 
 don&apos;t.
It&apos;s that 
 some people are ready to 
 change and others are 
 not. &quot;
