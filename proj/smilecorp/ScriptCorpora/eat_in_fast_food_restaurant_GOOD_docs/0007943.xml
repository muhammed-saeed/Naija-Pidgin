 Edmonton Business Broker–Value Drivers That Increase the Price of a Business 
 July 11, 2012, 11:24 am 
Ten Value Drivers That Increase Sale Price of a Business 
 
 Business Value—What Drives It? 
 A valuation is not about determining what a company is worth in the current owner’s hands, it is about the company’s transferable value. The purpose of this article is to help you evaluate your company through the eyes of a buyer. From that perspective we will ask you to focus on ten value drivers. Each driver is a characteristic of a business that either reduces the risk associated with owning the business or enhances the prospect that the business will grow significantly in the future. Simply put, the better your performance in these areas, the greater the selling price of your business. The likely result is that you will sell at the higher range of the multiples normally associated with your industry.
 Value Driver #1: Stable and Predictable Cash Flow 
Think of revenue and the bottom line cash flow of your business as the first introduction to a buyer. Revenue and cash flow is the number one attraction. A business with an established pattern of growth will bring a premium price when it is sold. The value associated with acquiring the available cash flow is directly related to risk. The lower the risk of losing that cash flow in a transfer of ownership, the higher the price will be to acquire it. If recurring revenues comprise a material portion of a company’s overall revenues, the recurring revenue stream can be valued at a higher level than the non-recurring revenues. Examples of recurring revenues are maintenance contracts, monthly support agreements, annual license agreements, warranties, subscriptions, or other revenue streams that are contractual and repeating in nature. Buyers are willing to pay the highest amount when their perception is that cash flow is predictable and will increase into the future.
 Value Driver #2: Reliable Financial Information 
Reliable financial records are not only a critical element of business management but also support the claim that a company is consistently profitable. In the purchase of a business, the buyer will perform some level of financial due diligence. If the buyer is not comfortable when reviewing the company’s past financial performance, there is no deal, or at best a reduced value for the company. If a buyer faces a seller of a business who asserts that the company has been making $1 million per year for the past three years and is projected to make at least that much in the future, the seller will be required to prove it. If the seller then produces past financial statements that are incorrect, insupportable, or incomplete, the buyer would most likely be gone. The lack of financial integrity is one of the most common hurdles encountered during the sale process.
 Value Driver #3: Customer Diversity 
A broad customer base in which no single client accounts for more than 5 to 10 percent of total sales helps to insulate a company from the loss of any single customer. It reduces the risk of serious cash flow issues if one or more customers do not stay under new ownership.
 Value Driver #4: Human Capital / Quality of Workforce 
Keep your talent, they are your business. Buyers look for situations where management and / or key employees want to stay for the long term. The quality of the workforce, including experience, expertise and depth of knowledge, is also considered. An in-place team that can provide continuity and assist in the growth of the business under new ownership is a valuable asset. If a company’s success is reliant on capable, well-trained employees – not the owner – it means the business will not be negatively impacted under new ownership. This reduction of risk will pay off with increased purchase price.
 Value Driver #5: Growth Potential 
When an owner can describe realistic opportunities for growth that specifically illustrate the reasons why cash flow and the business itself will grow after it is acquired, a higher value can be achieved. A documented growth plan demonstrates the viability of the company’s future and may identify opportunities that a buyer had not considered. Some areas to consider in developing a growth plan: 
 Is your business in a growth industry? Are there additional markets that a new owner should pursue? What additional products could be delivered to existing customers? Where are the best profit margins realized and can they be expanded? Can your technology be licensed? Will demand for your product or service increase as population grows? How will enhanced marketing campaigns and sales efforts affect growth? Are there opportunities to grow through acquisition? Can growth be achieved by expanding territory or manufacturing capacity? 

 Value Driver #6: Operating Systems and Procedures 
The establishment and documentation of standard business procedures and systems demonstrate that the business can be maintained profitably after the sale. Business systems include the computerized and manual procedures used in the business to generate its revenue and control expenses, as well as the methods used to track how customers are identified and how products or services are delivered. The following are examples of business systems that enhance business value.

 Personnel recruitment, training and retention Human resource management (an employee manual) New customer identification, solicitation, and acquisition Product or service development and improvement Inventory and fixed asset control Product or service quality control Customer, vendor and employee communication Selection and maintenance of vendor relationships Business performance reports for management 

 Value Driver #7: Facility and Equipment Condition 
The business facilities and equipment should be well maintained to realize maximum value. A buyer will not pay a premium, and may very well discount an offer, for a disorganized warehouse, office or other building. Seeing disorganized or poorly maintained facilities and equipment may cause the buyer to perceive that other aspects or the business may be similarly disorganized (employee records, financial records, compliance records, etc.). Owners should ensure that facilities and equipment are organized and maintained in peak condition before beginning the sale process. Buyers will appreciate that their investment will not include major repairs and that all equipment and inventory will be easy to locate and identify. Lastly, are the facilities large enough and machinery sufficient to accommodate some level of modest sales growth? A buyer does not want to have to look for additional space or immediately invest in new equipment shortly after closing.
 Value Driver #8: Goodwill 
This value driver involves stability and consistency. Name recognition, customer awareness, history, ongoing operations, and reputation are all part of business goodwill and influence value. Even if the company does not have many hard assets, relationships are key. The fact that customers have been with the company for a period of time does matter. Brand recognition, service or product reliability, and high customer satisfaction are distinguishing factors that add value. This driver of goodwill should not be overlooked in a valuation because it is helps mitigate perceived risk.
 Value Driver #9: Barriers to Competitive Entry 
Features that give a business an advantage over its competitors, strengthen its strategic position, or that can be leveraged for future gain boost value and lessen perceived risk. Buyers will pay a premium for a niche that has barriers to competitive entry. One way to describe this Barrier Value Driver is to use Warren Buffet’s term,“Business Moat.”Buffet compares a castle’s moat to the protection that a business needs to encroaching competitors. For instance, the wider the moat, the more easily a castle could be defended. A narrow moat did not offer much protection and allowed the castle to be breached. To Buffett, the castle is the business and the moat is the barrier that protects the business’competitive edge. The following are example barriers that widen the moat and hinder competitors from breaching the company’s castle.

 Copyrights Trademarks Patents Trade Secrets Developed Processes Proprietary Designs Proprietary Know-How Brand or Trade Names Engineering Drawings Customized Software Programs Step-by-Step Training Systems Customized or Proprietary Databases Published Articles or Industry Press Hard-to-get licenses, zoning, permits, or regulatory approvals Contracts with difficult-to-penetrate entities (government, for example) 

 Value Driver #10: Product Diversity 
A narrow product set increases risk and drives down value. Diversity of revenue sources lowers the inherent risk of the business. Therefore, businesses with a healthy product mix, good gross profit diversification, or with products or services sold into multiple industries, receive a higher perceived value from prospective buyers.

 Performance Business Brokers–Maximize Value When Selling Your Business 
 July 9, 2012, 11:46 am 
Maximize Value When Selling Your Business - Get Rid of Excess Inventory
 When selling a business , maximizing value is of primary importance to the business owner. One element that can drag down business value is poor inventory management in the form of excess inventory. Maintaining proper inventory levels is essential to maximizing value. 
When running a business, the goal should be to tie up as little cash as possible in inventory, while having enough inventory to meet ordinary business needs. After all, a prospective buyer looking at your business as a possible acquisition would rather have fully flexible cash not less flexible inventory weighing profits down. Any additional dollar that can be found to help bottom line earnings when selling a business will be rewarded by a higher price when the business is sold.
 There is a delicate balance where it begins to cost more to carry the inventory than it costs to not carry the inventory. Carrying unneeded inventory can decimate profitability and cash flow in a hurry. Not only does excess inventory tie up a lot of cash, but there are day-in and day-out costs associated with that inventory as well. From the expense of financing that inventory, to the costs of markdowns due to age and obsolescence, to the incremental payroll costs of moving it around, to the hidden costs of not being able to merchandise more productive inventory in its place, it all adds up, and hits the bottom line.
These costs affect the profitability of the business and include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 Cost of Capital–There is a cost of the capital that you have tied up in inventory which may be in the form of interest that you are paying for the financing of the inventory. With every sales transaction, cash is generated, which drives the operating cycle. Cash is used to purchase inventory and pay expenses. But when your inventory is too high, your cash is tied up in that inventory. In cases where inventory is not being converted to cash efficiently, the need for an increased line of credit is the consequence. Paying more interest on the increased debt is obviously costly when you should be generating those funds internally. Storage–There is a cost for taking up space in a warehouse. You may be leasing more space than you actually need. You may also have higher utility expenses that are associated with leasing this larger space. Handling–There is a cost associated with servicing and maintaining inventory such as material handlers and record keeping staff. Opportunity Costs–This cost is associated with the funds you have tied up that you cannot put to use elsewhere. This cost can be determined by evaluating what you could have done with the money if you hadn’t spent it on inventory. Whether it is invest in upgraded technology, equipment, staff, or something else you could have done with that money. Any higher gains that could have been achieved from those other investments is a lost opportunity and is a cost of carrying inventory. Insurance and Taxes–You may be paying more taxes and higher insurance premiums than necessary to maintain excess inventory. Risk of obsolescence–There is increased chance for obsolesce, deterioration, or damage when you have too much inventory. Higher Selling and Advertising Costs–If you are carrying an excess level of inventory, you will incur additional and probably unplanned selling and advertising expenses in order to sell the excess merchandise. 
 
There are other issues concerning inventory that can derail the successful sale of a business. Be sure to discuss any inventory issues you may have with your business broker prior to marketing the business for sale.

 Edmonton Business Broker–Due Diligence When Selling a Business 
 June 26, 2012, 9:46 am 
 P assing Financial Due Diligence When Selling A Business Due Diligence is the final hurdle of the business sale process. It is the time when the buyer requests from the seller any documents and materials needed to verify that all representations made by the seller are accurate and occurs after a purchase contract is signed by both parties in the transaction. The contract is contingent upon the business passing due diligence inspection by the buyer, which is usually scheduled to last about two weeks. While there are many aspects of the business that will be explored by the buyer, such as as personnel, operational, market, and legal, it is financial due diligence that is one of the biggest reasons deals fall apart. Having proper documentation to present to a prospective buyer that proves revenues and earnings of the business is key to attaining a successful sale in a timely manner. With good financial records a prospective buyer could readily verify earnings and be able to arrange bank financing, if applicable. On the other hand, poor financial records would not yield such a rosy outcome. First, the buyer would most likely need additional time to verify and make sense of the information, which could delay closing and require the business owner to produce additional data. Secondly, if the buyer feels the books are unsatisfactory or inconsistent, a higher risk in purchasing the business would be perceived. Consequently, depending on the risk tolerance of the buyer, s/he would either pull out of the deal or offer a lower price than originally negotiated in the contract. There are things that may be uncovered during due diligence of which the seller may or may not have been aware that could affect the transaction. In many cases, these issues can be worked out. Small issues usually involve some give and take from both parties and the transaction will stay on track. Major findings, however, could result in a dead deal or a deal that gets renegotiated. Due diligence preparations should be made prior to the business sale process to avoid delays and facilitate a smooth experience for everyone involved. The more expeditiously that clear and organized information that demonstrates the full financial benefits of owning the business can be made available to a prospective buyer, the more likely the business will sell as negotiated and close on time. With that in mind, the following are individual items that may be requested by a prospective buyer in order to substantiate the financial aspects of the business. 
 Income statements Balance Sheet Assets on balance sheet Tax returns GST clearance (Certificate of No Tax Due) Customer and / or vendor contracts Bank statements Documentation of the owner’s discretionary earnings Inventory reports Asset depreciation list General ledgers Insurance policies Sales and backlog Equipment leases Accounts receivable and payables reports

 Performance Business Broker–Business for Sale&amp;Price Negotiation 
 June 20, 2012, 9:59 am 
 
Should the Owner of a Business for Sale Expect to Negotiate Price?
 This is a common question asked by business owners who are thinking about putting their business on the market for sale. They want to understand the parameters of a business deal and what to expect from prospective buyers. 
 
 Negotiation may seem a daunting task, but when explained in a balanced manner, negotiation should be deemed a positive approach rather than a negative one. When a serious qualified prospective buyer comes along, the negotiation strategy should be one that results in a winning deal for both the seller and the buyer. It’s not about who strong-arms the other. Nor is it a game at which you either win or lose. It’s a complex process for sure. A good deal is never one-sided. Both parties should work as allies since the goal of one will achieve the goal of the other. If the parties can determine the factors that are most important to each, the price and the terms of the deal can be structured to meet those needs. The short answer to the title question is that“a successful sale is not just about the price tag. The terms and structure are what make the deal.” Negotiating tips that can make a deal work: 
 Resolve the toughest issues first. Don’t get bogged down in minor details. Keep egos at bay. Focus on common interests. Discuss different scenarios to solve any particular problem before making a decision.

 Buy a Business - Asset Purchase vs. Stock Purchase 

 Buying a business , especially if it is your first time, can be overwhelming. Will you purchase the assets of the business, or its stock? Which is more beneficial for you? There is no clear-cut answer to this question as it really depends on your circumstances.

In an asset purchase, you buy the company’s assets – furniture, vehicles, equipment, inventory, etc. The shares of stocks remain with the seller. In a stock purchase, you are buying everything the seller owns – stocks, assets and liabilities. You take over as the new owner of the business.

 Should You Buy Assets or Stock When Buying a Business? 

It is worthwhile to seek the services of a corporate lawyer and an accountant before buying a business. They can advise you on what is the best purchase option for you.

If a business for sale is doing well, you can opt for a stock purchase. However, if the business isn’t profitable, a stock purchase may not be the best option because you may be assuming its liabilities. Find out why the business is being sold.

If you want to build your own company, go ahead with an asset purchase. Before doing so, conduct thorough due diligence. Choose the assets you want to acquire, and the liabilities you intend to assume.

Two key factors – liabilities and depreciation – could determine which is the better option for you. When you purchase company stock, you also assume all its liabilities – disclosed or unknown. A seller may not be forthright about all the liabilities during negotiations. You could have also missed uncovering these liabilities during due diligence. In an asset purchase, you can avoid most of the liabilities. You are responsible only for those identified in the purchase agreement.

Depreciation is the process of deducting a portion of the cost of an asset from the income each year. In a stock purchase, you, as the new asset owner, will just continue deducting depreciation as the previous owner did. In an asset sale, though, the tax law allows you to depreciate the entire purchase price.

 Asset Purchase vs. Stock Purchase: Advantages&amp;Disadvantages 

 In an asset purchase, the assets and liabilities are recorded at fair market value. You can claim the fair market value of tangible assets for depreciation, which results in lower taxes. In a stock purchase, the assets and liabilities are carried over and depreciated as before the purchase. You acquire the entire business, including all assets and liabilities when you purchase the company’s stock. In an asset purchase, you assume some of the liabilities. You can also choose the useful assets you want for your new company. An asset purchase may require more documentation. The transfer of ownership of the assets, liabilities and related contracts may need to be filed with the appropriate government agencies. This is not a requirement in a stock transaction. A stock purchase is easier and cheaper to implement, especially if the company only has a few shareholders. 

In a stock purchase, you inherit the contracts, permits and licenses. In an asset purchase, you need to file or register for these with the appropriate agencies.

 There is no problem with minority shareholders who refuse to sell in an asset transaction. Multiple shareholders could block a buyer’s desire to own 100% of the company in a stock purchase. You may need to pay for sales or transfer taxes on the sale of assets. A stock transaction avoids some of these taxes. 

 Buying a business is complicated in itself. Each business purchase transaction is unique. Obtaining professional legal and accounting assistance is a must for a successful business acquisition. As a business buyer, which purchase option is better for you?

Share Sale vs Asset Sale

When buying an existing business you may have the option of either purchasing the shares of the business or the assets of the business. If you purchase the shares of the business , you inherit the debts and liabilities of the business at that time. You also have an exposure to any debts and liabilities which may arise in the future (even if they relate to events before the shares were acquired).

If you are purchasing shares in the company it may be prudent to negotiate a legal indemnity with the vendor to cover any debts which may arise.
