I really like this place.  They have pretty good food at a reasonable price.  Service is quick, and they will deliver for a small fee to the rest of the mall (I work there) in case I can&apos;t get away to walk over and get it.  With delivery though, they usually forget a piece of your order - a drink, chicken on a salad, something.  Not a huge deal, as they will fix it, but a small annoyance if you&apos;re really hungry!

I am sad to see that the toasted ravioli are not on the menu anymore.  They were delicious.  The food is really pretty good for a quick-serve type place.  The chopped salad is fantastic and is my favorite thing on the menu.  It&apos;s enough for two, really.  The half-pizza is really great too.  Better than a by-the-slice, and enough to feed one really hungry person or two less hungry people.  I have not tried the pasta, but the chicken parm is good both as an entree and as a sandwich.  Mozzarella sticks are also a win.  :)

Comparing this location to our usual Lincolnshire spot:

Not to mention that several years ago, the sign out front in the hall way almost fell on my daughter, this place overall is not as spotless or put together as the other. The layout here is a mess and very cramped to get around.

While dining here recently, the busboy was trying to carry WAY to many dishes and ended up dropping the entire thing all over the floor.  Problem was that there were 2 families, including us that where dining in the spot.  It could have been a lot worse, but they did get some sauce on my wife&apos;s shoes; missed everything else.  It also looked like they got some on the other table&apos;s shoes.  They came by to clean it up, but at no point did anyone ask if we are ok and clean.

Outside of that, the food is very consistent and while not great, is decent.
The kids pasta seemed to be a smaller portion here and so did my chik parm sandwich.

Go Roma took ownership to a level above and beyond.  I was contacted by not only the store manager, but the area manager as well.  They appreciated my honest feedback, and were sincere about wanting to improve.

That is something I can appreciate.  Stay tuned for my next visit!

This is sort of a combination of a fast food restaurant and sit-down restaurant. You order your food at the counter, and then you find a place to sit and they bring you your meal. My mom and I ordered the vegetable and goat cheese pizza and it was excellent! It tasted hot, fresh and delicious, at half the price of a fancier restaurant. And the warm chocolate pudding cake was AMAZING! They also had one of my favorite drink machines where you can choose your soda and then choose a flavor. We&apos;re definitely going to go back here. If you have Foursquare on your phone, you can get 10% off one entree just by &quot;checking in&quot; and showing it to them!

I&apos;m giving this place four stars because they have done something important: they are honest about who they are in their pricing, service and market position. They are not a fancy Italian place, yet their food is better than some I&apos;ve had at higher-priced places. There is no pretension.

Stopped here for a quick bite with my family while taking two of my Macs into the Genius Bar at the Apple store in Deer Park. Very &quot;Noodles&quot; like. I would say it was very good. Fresh ingredients and minimal processing at a fair price; this place does it right. They have a few small tables outside, which is were we ate.

Tip: Order the smaller portions - they should still be enough to share.

I have been looking for a tasty lunch place around the area - and i have found one! I think their lunch special - 1/2 salad + soup or 1/2 pizza is a great option.
Today i am having mushroom marsala soup  and spinach + goat cheese pizza. The soup is excellent. About the pizza - even though my favorite is very thin crust cooked in the oven (e.g. trattoria d.o.c.) go roma does a good job of preparing their version.
Also - i like the pizza boxes :)

My mom and I came here for a quick bite to eat while we were shopping at Deer Park.  We both ordered the Tuscan salad.  It came with a garlic breadstick in a big bowl.  The salad was fresh and delicious.  The different flavors of the baby greens, green beans, corkscrew pasta, roasted red peppers and cherry tomatoes all came together to make a tasty salad.  It was definitely filling.

The space is nice and it&apos;s a quick serve Italian restaurant.  The prices are reasonable.  The pizza looks amazing and I definitely want to try the pick two.  Since this location is far from where I live, I probably won&apos;t be coming here as often.  But when I am shopping here again, I will be stopping in!

This place remind s me a lot of Noodles&amp;Company. You stand in line and order, then you get a number and bring you your food.

The food was ok. I had a &quot;combo&quot; with half smoked chicken&amp;pear salad, and half Italian sandwich.

Sit up near the front door to the restaurant. The back hallway by the soda machines smells like hot garbage&amp;spoiled milk. Throw some bleach on that mess yo!

Go Roma sits in the niche that&apos;s not fast food, but not a real dinner out, either. I&apos;m never sure how to rate these sorts of places.

I will say the &quot;half&quot; portion is a generous full-sized meal. A &quot;regular&quot; portion could easily feed two people. The misto salad was fresh and the dressing was nice. The bread was bleah. The alfredo sauce was soupy. Meh overall, but maybe that&apos;s just me.

I wasn&apos;t sure based on the look of the restaurant or their website if calling ahead was required for take out, or if it was like Panera in that you order up front and specify &quot;for here&quot; or &quot;to go&quot;. So I called ahead. Turns out it&apos;s more like Panera. But my soup and sandwich were in my hands within seconds!

I had the minestrone, and found it to have more parsley than I normally like. But it was still tasty and had loads of fresh vegetables.

I wasn&apos;t expecting my sandwich to be toasted, but it was. It was good, not great. And I was not expecting fries to come with my &quot;pick two&quot; lunch, either. What a tasty surprise.

I&apos;d definitely come back!

Fast food Italian at sit down restaurant prices.  Despite the price, I still find myself coming here again and again.  The food is always delicious even if the service is a little slow and the line is out the door.  The tomato basil soup here is top notch and the rigatoni country style is a guilty pleasure of mine.

A little more space, a little lower price, and faster service and this place would be five stars.

I think of Go Roma like an Italian Cosi or Panera Bread, in that odd zone between fast food and a full-fledged restaurant.  You place your order at the register, they give you a number, then they&apos;ll deliver your food to you at your table.

I&apos;ve been to Go Roma now about half a dozen times, and every time I get the chicken parmesan.  I&apos;m just hooked on it.  For about $11, I can get their dinner portion chicken parmesan (that comes with a side of pasta and a breadstick) and a soda.  I think it tastes fantastic, especially for the price.  I&apos;m definitely heading back soon and often.

Used to live near this location and how I miss the tomato-basil soup.  Panini, pizza, pasta -- all good.  Very nice staff, too.  A great spot for lunch or easy dinner.
(I heard that this chain was started by guys formerly employed by Lettuce Entertain U.  Whether that&apos;s true or not, you can tell they know how to create a venue.  The food quality compares with Corner Bakery, but I like Go Roma a tad better.)

If I wanted fast food cafeteria style italian, I&apos;d make it at home.  Enuff said on that.  Good thing they have a liquor license, get boozed up before they bring your food to the table a la Ponderosa style and you won&apos;t notice how bleh the food is.

I used to love this Go Roma location and would have my mother take me here for every birthday.  Unfortunately, this location has gone downhill over the years.  I get the feeling that it has undergone new management because of the vast difference in staff, quality, and atmosphere.

The food is okay...but it&apos;s a far cry from the excellent quality it used to be.  As my mother put it tonight when I took her out to Roma for the first time in a LONG time, &quot;I used to look forward to every bite, but not it&apos;s just okay.  It&apos;s good...but just okay.&quot;  The portions have drastically decreased and the prices are too high for the quality.  While the fries remain yummy, everything else has gone way down.  Either the sandwiches are overcooked or the pasta is practically mushy.  Tonight, I had the wheat rotini with meat sauce and was pretty unimpressed with the sauce.  I feel like someone messed something up with the recipe or reheating or something because not only was the sauce too sweet, but it almost had a frostbitten aftertaste.

By far the worst part has to be the staff.  We were yelled at by the young Hispanic cashier to tell her our orders while we were trying to politely allow another few customers to pass in front of us.  She snapped at us again when we stepped up to the register.  We gave her our order and I paid.  She found a conversation with one of the kitchen staff who poked his head out to be far more interesting than giving me my receipt.  Granted, our food came out fast...but it was almost TOO fast for the food to be fresh.  At these prices, I don&apos;t want to buy my mother a frozen or reheated Chicken Parmesan Sandwich!  We were seated at one of the few available tables that happened to be near the register.  The cashier that helped us served every customer with the same impatient, brusque, and rude manner that obviously bespoke of an extreme desire not to be there.  I have worked in the service industry and understand having an off day, but there&apos;s a point where one&apos;s rudeness is unacceptable.  When there was no line, she went on to roll silverware at the counter...while she was eating!!!  Who does that?  Talk about unappetizing!  She found speaking to the other cashier far more interesting than answering the phone to take orders and sniped at each and every customer she took an order from over the phone.  A member of the kitchen staff poked his head out of the kitchen after one of these phone calls and they began having a conversation at the top of their voices!  They were yelling at one another!  I am all for friendships with coworkers, but this was absurd!  There is no need to yell to one another over customers.  Nothing can be that important and it was extremely unprofessional.  Worst of all, the woman in charge saw it all and did nothing.  There was not a look or word exchanged in reprimand and I am astonished.  Everyone seems very close, but it&apos;s too close for a professional workplace.  I&apos;ve worked in situations like this before where everyone has their friends hired and this creates an unprofessional and unpleasant situation for customers.  Obviously, I cannot say this is the situation with the Deer Park Go Roma, but it sure seems that way.

I&apos;m fairly disappointed in my experience at this location.  I&apos;ve been a loyal customer for years and I don&apos;t know how long I&apos;ll continue my patronage.

What is really a shame is that I work in the Deer Park Mall as well and my coworkers and I love to drop by for sandwiches, salads, and soups.  We have been offered a small discount if we tell them we are calling from our store.  Personally, I know I have about a 50/50 shot of getting the discount first try.  My most recent experience with this was with the very same cashier I had tonight&apos;s experience with.  I called and asked for my discount.  She was short and impatient with me on the phone and she was obviously not listening.  Sure enough, I got there, paid for my order and THEN she gave me the receipt for my order (without checking to make sure it was even mine, let alone that it was correct) and it was wrong--without the discount.  I&apos;m pretty fed up with this locations for several reasons and saddened at the downhill spiral of this location.  Unfortunately, I&apos;m so close to dissuading the rest of my coworkers from ordering our dinners and lunches here (though they have all had similar experiences, so I don&apos;t know how much persuading they really need).

Someone needs to check out this location and make sure all is in order.  Some serious corners are being cut and this is seriously going to hurt the business.  It will leave a bad taste in every customer&apos;s mouth for all Go Roma locations.  I know I saw several traumatized customers leave while I took only as long as I needed to eat my meal before escaping.  I&apos;m sorry I didn&apos;t offer to take my mother somewhere else.  She deserves better than yelling, rude, and snippy cashiers and reheated Chicken Parmesan.

Go Roma is a cute little Italian type of fast food restaurant.  The salads are good but I wish they offered more than just 4 kinds.  It is never too packed so you can always find a seat.

Decent food overall and even better when other places have an hour + wait. I have only tried a few pasta dishes (Roma Alfredo&amp;Marsala Chk) and one side. Both dishes were good, but the roma def needs chicken and their chicken &quot;additions&quot; are laughable, at best unfortunately. The marsala sauce is also much sweeter then I expected both times I tried it. No complaints on the toasted ravs other then I wish they were so bad for you :(  but thats why they taste so good.

Simple, classic recipes. The freshest ingredients. An easy-going atmosphere. And a price that&apos;s a real treat.

Real. Easy. Italian.
Go Roma.
 
History
 
 Established in 2004 

Four restaurateur friends wondered why there wasn&apos;t a restaurant that served really great-tasting Italian food ... quickly and conveniently ... at reasonable prices ... that could be enjoyed in a relaxed, casual environment or carried out easily. They decided to turn their vision into a reality.

When the first Go Roma opened in Warrenville, Illinois, in 2004, people quickly recognized that there was no other restaurant like it. They kept coming back for the real, chef-inspired recipes. For every dish made to order. For a place that&apos;s easy to dine in, carry out, or get catering. And for the really easy prices.

It&apos;s the deliciously different Go Roma experience:
Real. Easy. Italian.
