		2. CASE STUDY: METRO
MANILA 


 2.1 Introduction

Manila supports a substantial market for live, fresh, frozen,
cured fish and canned fishery products. The Metropolitan Manila Area (MMA) was
established in 1975 through Presidential Decree 824 and amended by Presidential
Decree 1396, which established this geographical area as the National Capital
Region (NCR). Under the administration of the Metropolitan Manila Development
Authority, the NCR comprises the following cities: Manila, Quezon City,
Caloocan, Pasay, Mandaluyong, Pasig, Makati, Muntinlupa, Marikina, and Las
Piñas. Currently the NCR is administratively divided into seven
municipalities, namely: Malabon, Navotas, Parañaque, Pateros, San Juan,
Taguig and Valenzuela, with an estimated population of 10.4 million in 2000,
which represents about 12.8 percent [1] of the
countrys total population. According to latest estimates, the total
projected population of the Philippines [2] for
2000 is about 81 million. Under the 1991 Local Government Code, the City Council
of Metro Manila was granted local autonomy and regulatory powers concerning
basic city services, and enforcement of inspection of food products and urban
sanitation. It is also in charge of policy formulation and supervision of retail
food markets and street food vending.

In 1997, FAO fisheries statistics reported an apparent annual
per capita fish supply of 31.7 kg in the Philippines. Currently the Philippines,
Malaysia and Singapore have the highest per capita supply of fish in the
ASEAN [3] region. A breakdown of the annual per
capita supply of fish for the Philippines in 1997 is shown in Table 3.

ASEAN countries, particularly the Philippines, Singapore and
Malaysia, offer a strong regional fish and fishery products market with
significant fish imports. The Philippines is by far the major importer of small
pelagics, either frozen (sardine, sardinella, mackerel and round scad), fish
meal (mainly sardine, anchovy and mackerels) or canned (mainly sardines in
tomato sauce). Japan and Russia are the main suppliers of frozen small pelagics
and over 80 percent of the fishmeal comes from Chile and Peru. In 1997, the
total imports of fishery products were 295,015 metric tonnes with a FOB value of
US$ 138.1 million. The total exports of fishery products for the same period
were 173,887 metric tonnes with a FOB value of US$ 549.8 million. In 1999,
official statistics [4] showed that the
countrys total fish catches were 2.86 million metric tonnes, with 34.2
percent coming from aquaculture production, 33.3 percent from commercial fishing
and 32.5 percent from small-scale fishing.

 2.2 Fish Distribution
Channels

The domestic market for fish and fishery products is
distinguished principally by the dependence on supplies from aquaculture,
small-scale fisheries and commercial fisheries. It should be noted that a
significant proportion of aquaculture produce, particularly shrimp, is exported.
Both freshwater and marine fish and fishery products are regularly being traded
in Metro Manilas domestic seafood market. Fish and fishery products are
staple foods in the Filipino diet, and constitute the main source of animal
protein. Chilled and live seafood is landed at the main Metro Manila fishing
port, namely Navotas Fishing Port Complex (NFPC), which handles about 260,000 to
280,000 metric tonnes of fish annually. The Philippines Fisheries Development
Authority (PFDA) is in charge of the management and operation of NFPC and of
monitoring and compilation of fishery statistics and related fish marketing
information. Average daily volumes of seafood landed in Navotas FPC vary
according to the fishing season from about 430 to 980 metric tonnes. Navotas FPC
is equipped with two main trading halls with a market floor area of 8,320 m2, on
which the brokers or commission agents display and trade fish. Fish at the
wholesale marketing halls is sold mainly by secret bidding (whispering) in a
public auction conducted by brokers, who sell to retailers, institutional
buyers, processors and seafood traders. The wholesale market halls operate
regularly at night from about 20:00 hours to 03:00 hours. During 10:00 hours to
13:00 hours, wholesale/retail marketing operations are also conducted at Navotas
auction halls for fish coming from small-scale fisheries and aquaculture farms.
However, some of the fish and shellfish coming from other landing places or fish
farms, do not go through the Navotas auction halls, but are sold through
wholesale trade at the Divisoria Central Market, Metro Manilas major food
wholesale market, and Pasig wholesale market (mainly dealing with cultured
brackishwater fish coming from the Laguna de Bay area).

Live fish

There is a significant domestic live fish trade, a portion of
which does not go through the auction, but are handled by private wholesalers.
These wholesalers usually operate small live fish carrier trucks (with tanks and
aeration systems), collecting live milkfish ( Chanos chanos ), groupers and
freshwater fish (tilapia, catfish, snakehead) produced by aquaculture farms.
Domestic live shellfish trade comprises molluscs such as cultivated green mussel
( Perna viridis ) and oyster ( Crassostrea spp.); crustaceans include
mangrove crabs ( Scylla spp.). These live shellfish are regularly
distributed in the Philippines using air, sea and road transport; supplies come
from brackishwater ponds and small-scale fisheries. Most of the production of
oysters and green mussels are sold alive and a relatively limited proportion is
sold as shucked flesh, either fresh or salted. There is a very limited export
trade of frozen, chilled and dried oysters to Hong Kong and Singapore. Oysters
and green mussel farm operators usually sell their production either through
middlemen wholesalers or to a lesser extent, by direct retailing. Mussels and
oysters are generally packed and distributed in woven plastic bags (usually
holding about 30 kg) and traditional vegetable fibre baskets (locally known as kaing ), holding about 20 - 25 kg.

There is also a significant export trade of live reef fish,
particularly groupers, with supplies coming from capture fisheries. Export
markets for live groupers include Hong Kong and Singapore. The domestic market
is growing, but is limited mainly to Chinese restaurants. Current ex-farm prices
for marine cage and brackishwater pond-cultivated live groupers are about US$
7.5 - 9/kg.

Crabs

Four species of crabs are of commercial importance in Metro
Manila; these are pelagic swimming crab ( Portunus pelagicus ), mangrove
crab ( Scylla serrata ), peregrine crab ( Varuna litterata ) and
horned ghost crab ( Ocypode spp ). Mangrove crabs are considered a delicacy
and are always marketed alive. The Metro Manila market is characterised by
consumer preference for live mangrove crabs which command high prices; in
particular, ripe females fetch premium prices. The domestic market is supplied
with mangrove crab the year-round, with a peak season from May to September.
During the Christmas period, there is an increased demand and prices of live
mangrove crab are relatively higher.

There is a significant export trade of live mangrove crab to
Taiwan and Singapore; Table 4 shows the size grading of live mangrove crabs for
export markets. With the increasing demand both from export and domestic
markets, the current production has increased significantly to about 4,000
metric tonnes annually. Size requirements of live mangrove crab in the domestic
market vary from market to market. The catering sector, particularly restaurant
chains and specialised seafood restaurants, prefer small, medium and large
sizes; in the retail markets the most common sizes available are small and
medium. The minimum commercial size for export purposes is more than 200
g/piece; however, market requirements are oriented toward medium to large sizes,
with strong preference for ripe females which fetch premium prices. The
relatively high survival rates (5 - 7 days) of mangrove crabs out of the water
may be explained based on the fact that they have gill structures that allow
adequate levels of oxygen uptake in air. Therefore, local handling methods based
on a practical understanding of the crabs physiology are used to minimise
capture and transport stress and to cover the overall logistics of export
marketing as well as for the domestic trade. Main preventive handling practices
for live mangrove crabs include the control of temperature, humidity and careful
handling to avoid injuries.

Channels for Live Mangrove Crab 
 

Dried fish

There is an important dried fish market in Metro Manila for
products such as dried anchovies, dried-salted and salted mackerel, shrimp,
squid, cuttlefish and oyster. Small sardines and anchovies are usually
brine-salted and dried whole; larger fish are split open, cleaned, salted and
sun-dried. Traditional smoked fish products, in particular sardines, mackerel
and milkfish are also sold at retail markets in Metro Manila. Speciality cured
fishery products such as boneless smoked milkfish are usually sold under several
commercial brands well packed in plastic bags; marinated split open and dried
milkfish (with garlic, ginger, black pepper, vinegar and salt) is also sold at
retail level, especially in the public markets. The domestic dried fish
production is significant and the countrys per capita apparent consumption
of cured fish (including dried-salted fish) is one of the highest in the region.
In addition, locally produced fresh as well as dried seaweed products are also
offered in the market. Fresh Caulerpa and Gracilaria seaweeds are
usually consumed raw or blanched as the main ingredient in traditional salad
dishes or as garnishes for other seafood dishes.

Table 5 shows the average retail prices of dried fish in Metro
Manila during 1999. The most expensive products were dried squid at US$ 9.4/kg,
followed by dried anchovies and dried-salted groupers at US$ 3.2/kg and US$ 2.96
respectively. The cheapest products were dried whole sardines, split
dried-salted bigeye scads and Indian mackerel at US$ 2.1/kg, US$ 2.2/kg and US$
2.3/kg respectively.

Canned products

With population rising and coastal fishery stocks declining,
the Philippines is becoming increasingly reliant on imports of frozen fish to
satisfy local fish canning industry demand. Canned fish, in particular canned
tuna and sardine products, are locally manufactured, while imported canned
sardines in tomato sauce are very popular in supermarket chains, public markets
and small grocery retail outlets.

Metro Manila still boasts a large number of small-scale
independent grocery/food retail shops locally known as sari sari stores,
that serve mostly neighbourhood clientele and which proliferate in every urban
area. Many of these retail outlets sell a wide variety of canned seafood and
some cured and fermented fishery products. Sari sari stores and
supermarket chains have the largest share of the canned seafood retail
market.

Popular canned seafood packs include the following:

 
Sardines in tomato
sauce, in cylindrical cans with net contents of 155 g
 
Mackerel in tomato sauce or in
vegetable oil, in round cans with net contents of 180 g to 250 g
 
Tuna in oil, solid, chunk and
grated packs, in round cans with net contents of 180 g
 
Squid in natural ink, in round
cans with net contents of 400 g
 
Tuna with vegetables&amp;seasonings, mechado, afritada, caldereta and hot&amp;spicy packs, in
cylindrical cans with net contents of 155g
 
Milkfish in oil, tomato sauce
and in brine (salmon style)
 

The consumption habits in Metro Manila vary according to the
consumers socio-economic level, with upper and middle income homes buying
more high value tuna packs and lower income homes buying low-priced sardine
products. The most frequent practice of consuming canned tuna products is either
as a salad or with bread (sandwiches); canned sardines and milkfish are usually
served with cooked rice or bread as a snack, as well as sautéed with
garlic, onions and vegetables.

Table 6 shows the average retail prices of canned seafood
products in Metro Manila during 1999. In general, canned squid and tuna in oil
packs were the most expensive products; the cheapest canned products were
sardine in tomato sauce and mackerel in tomato sauce or in oil.

Seafood reaches Metro Manila consumers through a multi-level
system, which may involve at least three to four transactions before a fish or
fishery product is purchased by a consumer in a public fish market, or
supermarket, or eaten in a restaurant/food stall. The channels of distribution
incorporate locally caught and processed seafood, live and chilled cultured
species and frozen imported items from the region and around the world, which
can be processed locally. A long chain of traders/middlemen usually
distinguishes the seafood distribution chain in Metro Manila, starting from
Navotas FPC to the final consumer. Supermarket chains often obtain supplies from
direct importers or distributors of frozen and canned seafood products, which
makes possible a shorter distribution chain.

 2.3 Metro Manilas Retail Fish
Market

Metro Manilas urban area is home to a variety of retail
establishments offering live, fresh, frozen, cured and canned seafood to
consumers. The range of shopping options include public retail markets,
supermarkets and street hawkers which offer a wide selection of live fish, fresh
fish, frozen and canned fishery products as well as cured and fermented fish.
Public markets currently hold a significant share of the retail trade of
chilled, live fish, fermented and cured fishery products. Large supermarket
chains and medium-sized independent supermarkets offer mainly chilled, frozen,
cured and canned seafood. Supermarkets are currently handling a less significant
portion of the retail market share for chilled fish and fishery products. The
sales of chilled fish in supermarkets are still not significant, because
housewives associate fresh/chilled fish with public markets and only grocery
goods/canned fish with supermarkets. Despite the fact that most supermarkets are
low-cost, low-margin, high volume, self-service operations designed to provide
the consumers total needs for food and household-maintenance products,
there is still a strong preference to shop for chilled/fresh seafood in the
public retail markets, and to a lesser extent at street hawker stalls. Most
supermarkets have well-defined seafood product sales strategies, including
adequate product mix and a variety of frozen, fermented fish products, fish
sauce, and canned seafood products.

The most popular product form is whole fresh fish and
preferred species of seafood are: milkfish, Spanish mackerel, Indian mackerel,
all tunas, Loligo squid, round scad, slipmouth, red snapper, groupers,
anchovies, sardines, golden Caesio , lizardfish, tilapia, shrimps and
mangrove crabs. Recent trends indicate that tilapia (hybrid strains) is
increasingly becoming popular in the domestic market, and is now considered as a
substitute for milkfish, which is regarded as first-class fish. When comparing
retail prices of fresh tilapia with milkfish, currently tilapia is sold at lower
price levels, with average retail prices of about US$ 1.7 - 1.9 per kg and US$
2.57 - 2.69 per kg respectively. Some fish retailers indicated that sometimes
both species are sold at the same price level.

Table 7 shows the comparative retail prices for fresh fish at
selected street seafood markets and public markets in Metro Manila. In general,
retail prices at street seafood markets were slightly lower than public markets
with a price difference of 4.3 to 12%, however some products like Indian
mackerel and hairy shrimp were at the same price level. Taking into
consideration that most supermarkets have similar or slightly higher prices than
public markets, we can conclude from this relatively limited data that street
seafood markets are currently offering slightly lower retail prices for fresh
seafood in Metro Manila.

out by the author and counterparts in February 2000. 
 
Table 8 shows a comparison of average wholesale and retail
prices for selected fish species in Metro Manila for 1999. The estimated market
margins for chilled fish ranged from 11.8 to 136 percent, with an average
marketing margin of 57.6 percent. Based on the relatively limited data obtained
from the field surveys in general, the results obtained were in line with the
above marketing margins.

At most public markets, there are full-service seafood stalls
in charge of taking and preparing orders from consumers. Preparation may include
weighing a specific quantity of fish or shellfish, gutting, cleaning or cutting
a whole fish to the desired size or product form. Orders are then wrapped for
the consumer in plastic bags. This service is considered as a marketing tool
used to maintain the loyalty of regular clientele and attract new
customers.

Live fish and shellfish, including mangrove crab, oysters,
mussels, catfish, snakehead and tilapia, are well-established products in the
domestic market. They are sold in simple water tubs, bamboo baskets or cages.
Live crab retailers interviewed at the Seaside private fish market indicated
that their daily sales range from P. Peso 6,000 to 12,000 and during Christmas,
sales could reach up to P. Peso 36,000/day. These specialised shellfish
retailers usually operate from 4:00 hours to 23:00 hours, seven days per week.
They indicated that their average daily sales comprised 40 to 50 kg of live
crab, with an estimated 3 - 5 kg sold in chilled form at reduced prices. The
catering sector is also an important outlet for mangrove crab, oyster, mussels,
catfish, and tilapia, and recently for giant freshwater prawn. Some
restaurateurs indicated strong consumer preference for mangrove crabs, oysters
and mussels, traditionally cooked grilled, steamed or fried with vegetables
(with coconut milk). Giant freshwater prawn are sold through the catering sector
in specialised restaurants including some Thai restaurants operating in Metro
Manila. The species is well accepted by local consumers, but there is a need to
develop the market and create regular demand. However, supplies of giant
freshwater prawn are limited, coming mainly from a few freshwater ponds within
Central Luzon.

Seasonal variations in supplies and prices of fresh fish are
currently affecting demand for fresh/chilled fish and its substitute products.
At the retail level, the main substitute product to fresh fish is dressed
chicken, followed by pork. When prices of preferred species such as fresh
milkfish increase, consumers may shift to dressed chicken or to low-cost species
such as fresh sardines, Indian mackerel or round scad, if available. Retail
prices of fresh cultivated milkfish and dressed chicken have not increased
significantly since 1998 and this trend is basically market-determined. In 1999,
a PFDA study of the milkfish industry [5] indicated that relatively lower domestic wholesale and retail prices for
milkfish had aggravated the already delicate situation of milkfish producers,
who were facing significant increases in the costs of inputs (mainly imported
feeds and feed components) and declining demand caused by a drop in consumer
buying power. Local production of cultivated milkfish is highly dependent on
imported fish meal and other feed ingredients; therefore any significant
currency fluctuation or price rise could result in a cost-revenue squeeze with
declining profits.

Public retail markets and supermarkets currently offer a
variety of traditional minced fish products and surimi-based products. These
products include fish balls, squid/cuttlefish balls, native fish sausages, fish
burgers, and surimi analogues. In addition, minced fish-based dried fish/shrimp
crackers (locally processed and imported) are also offered. Traditional fish&amp;squid balls and native fish sausages (fish quekiam ), and snack type
foods, which are consumed mainly deep fried and dipped in sweet and sour sauce,
are very popular among consumers. The average wholesale prices of squid balls
and native fish sausages varied from P. Peso 78 to 80 per kg (US$1.71 - 1.96 per
kg) and P. Peso 60 to 64 per kg (US$1.46 - 1.56 per kg) respectively. The main
sources of raw material are from by-catch, market surpluses and some low-cost
freshwater species.

Besides the above-mentioned minced fish products, value-added
products such as cuttlefish/squid/fish/shrimp nuggets and patties and shrimp
tempura are locally processed and marketed. Some supermarket chains are also
offering pre-packed chilled and frozen imported seafood, including
Japanese-style sushi products (e.g. shrimp roe, tuna tekka maki , minced
tuna&amp;chilli, crab stick roll).

Imported frozen fish (mainly low-cost small pelagics and
cuttlefish) are increasingly being distributed in Manilas retail markets
at relatively lower prices than locally caught species. During field surveys, it
was noticed that imported frozen fish blocks were regularly traded in both the
Navotas FPC and Divisoria wholesale markets. This market trend apparently is in
response to the increased domestic demand for fish, particularly during the lean
fishing season. Therefore, consumersattitudes toward frozen fish are
gradually changing; it now appears that frozen fish is considered more
desirable, but still not superior to its fresh/chilled counterpart, particularly
in terms of its texture. This is a significant change from previous years, when
most consumers strongly preferred fresh/chilled fish; frozen fish was not well
accepted even if they were the same, or fresh fish prices are relatively too
high. In general, these imported frozen fish are currently retailed at prices 15
to 35 percent lower than similar fresh/chilled species.

 2.4 Street Food Hawkers in Metro
Manila

Street food hawkers in Metro Manila, in particular those
selling fresh seafood and ready-to-eat seafood, are considered to be catering to
middle and low-income consumers. Current data on the total number of street food
hawkers indicates an estimate of some 15,000 (about 5,000 are licensed),
according to the Manila Hawkers Permit Services, Bureau of Permits, Office of
the Mayor. This number includes those vending ready-to-eat foods and beverages,
raw food (fruits, vegetables, seafood, poultry) and native sweets and
delicacies. Street seafood hawkers currently play a significant role as
fresh/chilled seafood suppliers in Metro Manila; however, there is no detailed
data on the number of hawkers operating in the city. The main characteristics of
fresh/chilled fish street hawkers include the following:

 
Setting up
temporary stalls on busy streets during certain times of the day. This is the
simplest market system, making use of existing road infrastructure and with a
low level of investment. In general, it is easy to relocate facilities/equipment
to another site, which often causes street congestion and traffic management
problems. They are usually not allowed to operate in areas surrounding public
markets as they compete with the permanent fish retailers;
 
Carrying fresh seafood in
baskets, metal/plastic tubs or insulated boxes from the wholesale markets to the
street marketing areas using either motorcycles, taxis, public transportation
and private cars and vans (jeepneys);
 
Limited provision of adequate
potable water supplies and waste disposal systems to ensure appropriate sanitary
conditions;
 
In general, street food
markets, when compared with public markets or supermarket chains, offer
significantly less variety of fishery products, but with the advantage of being
less expensive. In most street food markets visited, besides fish and fishery
products, vegetables, fruits and other items such as charcoal, noodles, pork
meat and fresh dressed chicken, were also offered;
 
In addition to the regular
practice of selling by weight, a kind ofpantryservice was also
available, where fish and fishery products are sold in extremely small
quantities and in fractions of the most common units of sale, e.g. sales by
small dishes or small heaps.
 

Retail sales of raw food, in particular fresh fruits and
vegetables, and fresh cured seafood at busy streets or around public markets by
informal vendors in Metro Manila, are an integral part of the Filipino
marketplace. These market outlets are locally known as talipapas and
according to municipal legislations, are not permitted to operate within a
radius of 200 meters from the public markets. However, itinerant street fish
vendors peddling from place to place and carrying two baskets for fish
display/transport on shoulder poles were not common in urban areas.

In the past, Metro Manila was besieged by the problem of
street hawkers, sidewalk vendors and ambulant peddlers. Municipal authorities
were then authorised to establish flea markets ( tiangge ) or vending areas
in selected streets, roads and open spaces. The municipal ordinance No. 79 - 2
of 1/5/79, issued by the Metropolitan Manila Commission, indicated that the
Mayors of the cities and municipalities in Metro Manila were in charge of the
design, measurements and specifications of the structures and equipment to be
used in these flea markets or vending areas; the allowable distances; the days
and times allowed for conduct of the business authorised; the rates of fees or
charges to be imposed, levied or collected; the kinds of merchandise, goods and
commodities sold and service rendered; and other matters and activities related
to the establishment, maintenance, management and operation of the flea markets
and vending areas. However, the establishment of such flea markets and vending
areas under such terms and conditions was subject to the final approval of the
Metropolitan Manila Commission.

With the implementation of the Presidential Decree 856, Code
of Sanitation of the Philippines, hawkers are no longer allowed to sell food on
the streets. The City Council of Metro Manila formulates and implements policies
on the operation, licensing and control of hawkers. The Bureau of Permits under
the City Council of Metro Manila, Office of the Mayor, is directly in charge of
licensing street hawkers and enforcing local regulations. Street food vending is
considered illegal under the following local legislation:

 
 Offence/Violation 
 
 Legislation 
 
 i) Traffic obstruction
 
Police Manual Provisions
 
ii) Prohibition in the use of utensils for ambulant
vendors
 
Code of Sanitation
 

Nevertheless, street food hawkers are still operating in Metro
Manila and current trends indicate that their number is increasing in the more
commercial areas. Currently, a municipal fine (P.Peso 5) is levied on all street
vendors found plying their trade within a 200-metre distance from public markets
for the use and occupancy of city property, in accordance with Executive Order
No. 41. The main factors for this growth in street food vending can be explained
as follows:
 
i) Local eating habits, the cultural significance
of street food hawkers, socio-economic environment, high unemployment rates,
rapid urbanisation and urban population growth;

ii) Loyal patronage by a growing clientele; street food
vending has emerged in response to a socio-cultural need for inexpensive
nutritious foods. In the particular case of fresh seafood, informal street
markets operating at strategic locations during the busy hours of the day save
customers time and/or money;

iii) The effects of the Asian financial crisis, which dragged
the countrys economic growth down, had severely hit the urban poor
population. Therefore, street food vending activities flourished;

iv) The change in the role of the Metro Manila municipal
authorities, which is operating under difficult conditions, including the
negative effects of the economic crisis on the urban poor population. The
implementation of a participatory approach and education programmes in street
food business, public information campaigns and the recognition of street food
marketing as an important informal activity were necessary changes in policy,
which helped to clarify the benefits and disadvantages of unregulated street
food vending. However, specific interventions (such as adequate training,
credit, improved food safety, hygiene and inspection, equipment/infra-structure
development programmes and policy formulation to support regulated street food
vending) are still confronted by financial problems and lack of adequate
manpower for law enforcement. In most cases, it will require some time to
gradually implement the necessary changes.
 
Currently the City Council of Metropolitan Manila is planning
to regulate street food vending to include the designation of specific areas in
the city for vending as well as provision of support to vendors through the
construction of inexpensive food stalls (with sanitary facilities).

It was observed during field surveys that the fish offered by
street hawkers was of acceptable to good quality. Most consumers interviewed at
informal street fish markets mentioned that they had a good to acceptable
experience with fish purchased there. In addition, it appeared that consumers
appreciated the convenience of obtaining readily available seafood at street
fish markets. Based on observations, most street fish markets visited were well
accepted by consumers and provided personalised services. It was evident that
consumers appreciate seafood hawkers, who were in general, knowledgeable about
seafood and who cared about the needs of the consumers. Most street fish market
outlets surveyed catered to middle and low-income consumers on busy corners of
Metro Manila. Low-income families may purchase fish in small lots
(heaps/dishes). Based on direct observation and limited survey data, we
recognise that convenience, strategic location and affordable prices directly
influence repeat purchase of street vended fish, rather than solely customer
satisfaction and loyalty.

At most street food markets outlets visited, acceptable to
fair conditions were observed regarding fish handling practices. Usually,
seafood was displayed without ice; however some small pelagics, shrimp and squid
were kept in plastic tubs or trays in a slush of ice and water. Most street fish
vendors had at least one insulated box to keep chilled fish with crushed ice and
one (1) 10 - 15 litres capacity plastic bucket or container with a cover for
storage of potable water for fish cleaning. Regarding the variety of fish and
fishery products at street markets, most stalls had between four to eight
fresh/chilled fish species or 2 - 4 fishery products (mainly cured fish and
fermented) on display. Fresh/chilled fish stalls offered only fresh fish, while
specialised stalls displayed only cured fish (smoked and dried-salted fish).
Most fish hawkers indicated that they handled inventories of fresh fish for one
working day, while a few indicated that they kept fresh fish on ice for two
days. On average, street seafood vendors operated about 6 to 8 hours daily; most
indicated that the average number of working days is about 7 days per week. The
average daily sales per stall are about 50 kg of fresh fish and shellfish, 5 - 7
kg of dried fish and 4 - 5 kg of smoked fish.

Provision for solid waste to be deposited in bins was
inadequate to fair in most street fish market outlets. However in most of the
street markets visited, there was not much solid wastes in evidence. Most
vendors indicated that they manage solid waste collection and disposal by
themselves. The most common procedure was to store wastes in a woven fibre
basket or plastic bag which stood without a lid until full. Hygienic conditions
could be greatly improved, if adequate potable water supplies (tap water) and
solid waste bins with lids could be made available to street fish
markets.

The use of simple dial metallic thermometers is suggested to
regularly measure the temperature of fish on display at street fish markets.
Dial thermometers can easily be calibrated to a known temperature by adjusting a
hex nut located under the dial. These thermometers were available at some
supermarkets and specialised shops. This basic tool could be included as part of
the training kit for street fish vendors. In addition, the provision of an
adequate wastewater drainage system to street fish market outlets is greatly
needed. Water is used extensively in fish markets not only for fish cleaning,
but also to flush offal and blood from equipment and floors, and to flume
wastewater to floor drains and collection sumps. The first step for the
implementation of potable water supplies (tap water) to individual stalls at
street fish markets should be to analyse water use patterns, install water
meters and regularly record water consumption. The next step should be to
undertake a survey of all market area and ancillary operations to identify
wasteful practices and undertake corrective actions. Each street fish vendor
should pay according to their water consumption and proportionally for the
provision of wastewater drainage systems.

Although street vending may be a family business, the survey
indicated that women were the main operators. This reflects the need of most
poor women to balance income generation with household responsibilities. A
limited gender analysis showed that most women and men run street vending as a
family business. Other observations with regard to women engaged in street
seafood vending were:

 
Women were more
personal when it comes to dealing with consumers. In general, they were careful
with words and more patient in handling business problems;
 
Consumers, fish
wholesalers/middlemen, local government inspectors and police officers tended to
be more patient and friendly when dealing with women;
 
Some women indicated the
difficulty in balancing the demands of business and family. However, most women
interviewed indicated that street fish vending gave them greater time
flexibility than other types of jobs/businesses, with the advantage that it does
not need as much capital or skills;
 
Taking into consideration
womens predominant role in street fish marketing, greater female
participation in training activities in the fields of small business management,
fish handling and marketing should be encouraged.
 

The principal challenges with regard to informal street fish
vending in Metro Manila are therefore the need for effective and sustainable
interventions and the formulation of a comprehensive policy. To be effective,
statutory requirements (including licensing), should be properly linked to
training, monitoring, supervision and equipment/infrastructure development
programmes. In particular, seafood street vending should have adequate provision
of basic facilities for handling, chilled storage, preparation and waste
disposal which can be provided in the street areas where seafood vendors
regularly operate. In addition, depending on the type of seafood prepared and
sold (e.g. chilled raw fish and cooked fish/squid balls), working hours, working
places, and modus operandi (with fixed stalls or itinerant vendors with
push carts), vendors may require other equipment and facilities. They may also
have different views regarding proposed improvements of their services and
facilities. The views of street fish vendors and their clientele should be taken
into account during the formulation of statutory requirements and legislation
applicable to street fish vending. Sanitary regulations and codes of practice
for street seafood vending should be drafted using simple non-technical
language, and if possible, well illustrated versions of these regulations in
both English and Tagalog should be prepared for training purposes and the
information disseminated.

Regular training courses on fresh/chilled seafood handling and
hygiene should be part of any development programme for street fish vendors
organised by the City Council of Metro Manila or Metro Manila Development
Authority in co-ordination with the relevant government agencies. This training
should be aimed at providing adequate guidance and technical assistance to fish
hawkers on proper seafood handling and personal hygiene practices. All stall
holders and their assistants who are involved in the preparation and sale of
seafood should be required to attend and pass this training course.

Basic technical fields, which may be relevant for training
courses intended for street fresh fish vendors, are as follows:

 
Introduction to
the concepts of freshness, quality, wholesomeness and nutritive value.
 
The care of live and fresh
fish, handling methods, use of ice, receiving deliveries, quality inspection,
storage of live and chilled fish; hygiene and sanitation for fish retailers,
selection and application of detergents and disinfectants.
 
Quality of fish and quality
aspects at retail level; assuring seafood safety at street fish markets; retail
display of fish; promotion of fish sales techniques. Avoiding bad marketing
practices.
 
National and municipal
regulations and codes of practice for seafood vending.
 
Introduction to business
planning and simple economics in fish retailing.
 
Equipment and facilities
development programmes for street fish vending.
 

In addition, ready-to-eat seafood vending is a flourishing
small-scale business in Metro Manila, which requires adequate training for
vendors to improve safety and reduce the risk to public health from poor quality
products. Training programmes should focus on improving hygienic conditions at
the point of sale, use of potable water, and assuring overall safety of popular
street-vended snacks/dishes.

Based on field surveys carried out in Metro Manila, the
following street-vended fish snacks/dishes were very popular:

 
Fish/squid
balls
 
Native fish sausage
( quekiam )
 
Mussel soup
 
Rice noodles with vegetables
and pre-cooked shrimps ( shrimp pansit )
 
Fish/shrimp soup with
vegetables ( fish/shrimp sinigang )
 
Deep-fried fish
 
Cooked fish with ginger and
vinegar ( paksiw na isda )
 

 2.4.1 Examples of Street Market
Outlets in Metro Manila

In most raw food market outlets ( talipapas ) surveyed,
the following food items were offered:

 
Fresh fish and
live shellfish (live mussels and oysters)
 
Cured fish (traditional smoked
small pelagics and milkfish; dried fish)
 
Fermented fish sauce and paste
( patis and bagong )
 
Squid/fish balls
 
Noodles and rice
 
Dressed chicken
 
Fresh pork and beef;
traditional sausages&amp;frankfurters
 
Fresh fruits and
vegetables
 
Ready-to-eat food and
beverages (quail eggs, fish quekiam , pineapple juice , sago
gulaman, roasted peanuts, fish balls)
 
Common salt
 
Charcoal
 

Figure 3 illustrates the layout of a typical street market
food outlet ( talipapa ) located in Cubao District, Quezon City. At this
outlet, about 65 stalls were in operation, of which some 19 stalls were selling
fresh and live fish and shellfish (live mussels and oysters) as well as cured
fish. Most fresh and live fish stalls were concentrated in the 15th Avenue area
and a few were along First Camarilla Street. Considering the significant area
occupied by this street market and the variety of food items offered, we can
conclude that it is an important outlet in comparison to other markets
visited.

 Figure 3: Layout of a Typical
Street Food Market in Metro Manila (Cubao District, Quezon City) 

The layout of another typical street food market outlet
( talipapa ) located in Project 3, Quezon City, is illustrated in Figure 4.
About 18 stalls were there, of which 12 were selling either fresh or live fish
and shellfish or smoked fish. Most stalls were concentrated in Molave Street,
with some chicken and fresh pork and meat vendors operating in Narra Street.
This appears to be a medium size market outlet (with few food items offered) in
comparison to other street markets visited. Most vendors interviewed in both
street markets indicated that their daily sales were about 50 kg of fresh and/or
live fish, 5 - 6 kg of dried-salted fish and 5 - 8 kg of smoked fish.

The preferred source of fresh fish in both street markets was
the Farmers Market in Cubao, and the main source of cured fish and minced
fish products was the Divisoria wholesale market.

The street markets in Manila are usually located around public
markets or busy corners of main streets. According to all street fish vendors
interviewed in the Quezon City area, there is no fixed opening time for street
markets, taking into account that they are considered as illegal vendors.
However, in most of the markets visited, vendors indicated that they usually
operate from 13.00 hours to 20.00 hours, seven days per week. The solid wastes
were regularly collected by the street vendors and placed in plastic bags for
further disposal. Street vendors were in charge of the cleaning of their working
area after market hours.

The basic equipment of a street fish vendor consisted of small
wooden tables, a wooden cutting board, trash bin, umbrella, water for washing
fish and cleaning the stall area, insulated boxes, weighing scale and plastic
display dishes. Most of the smaller stalls were equipped with only secondhand
wooden packaging crates as a framework for wooden tops, or round flat
bamboo/rattan trays for fish display, weighing scale and cutting boards. The
typical sales or table area per seafood retailer would be in the range of 1.5 to
3 m2. The larger stalls use up more space to keep insulated boxes that may not
fit below the wooden tables. The most common material used for manufacturing the
round display trays was rattan. In most locations visited, retailers displayed
their fish on wooden tops lined with plastic sheets; in some stalls, whole Acetes shrimp, small pelagics or squids were displayed in small plastic
dishes (on top of the tables) and sold by the dish (volume).

 Figure 4: Layout of a Typical
Street Food Market in Metro Manila (Project 3, Quezon City) 

Some vendors, operating in the outskirts of Metro Manila, were
offering live freshwater fish and shellfish, mainly snakehead, catfish, mussels
and oysters. Basic equipment for live fish sales consisted of metal tubs or
plastic bins filled with water, weighing scale, round display trays (rattan) and
chopping boards. Mussels and oysters were displayed on round display trays and
kept moist with regular sprinkles of seawater. Snakehead and catfish were
displayed in metal tubs or plastic bins filled with freshwater. In general,
green mussel was the predominant species offered in live form; this was
available in most of the street markets visited. According to most vendors, the
sales of mussels and oysters are regularly affected by red tide. As a result,
the Government sometimes imposes a complete ban on the harvesting and sales of
these bivalves in the interest of public safety. These bans negatively affect
marketing operations and the livelihood of street fish vendors specialised in
live shellfish vending.

 2.5 Improved Equipment and
Technologies for Street Seafood Vending

In contrast to the considerable emphasis on modern food
vending equipment in outlets which cater to the middle/high income consumers,
very little consistent effort is directed for the benefit of low-income
consumers. It remains a fact that much technology and expertise exists locally
today, which, if adapted to the needs of the low-income sector, could play an
important role in improving and streamlining the safety and quality of
ready-to-eat street seafood. Among the major deficiencies observed during field
surveys of traditional street fish/squid balls vendors in selected areas of
Metro Manila, were the lack of basic facilities (running potable water for hand
washing, cleaning worktops and utensils), and limited access to
refrigerated/chilled storage for their daily stock of fish balls.

A successful pilot scheme on food carts for street food
vending sponsored by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute in co-ordination
with other local agencies/institutions was implemented in San Juan, Metro Manila
and Los Baños, Laguna during 1996. It provided improved food cart
prototypes to selected street food vendors on arent-to ownbasis
and a flexible payment scheme which considered the prevailing street
vendors payment capabilities. The prototypes were locally constructed and
the cost ranged from P. Peso 3,500 to 4,200. This scheme was aimed at field
testing two models for integrating the street food system into feeding
operations in selected urban schools. However, during the field work, there was
insufficient technical information available on the design and materials used
for the construction of these improved food cart prototypes to allow a proper
analysis.

 2.5.1 Improved Pushcart for Retailing
Fish/Squid Balls and Native Fish Sausage

A good example of improved equipment locally developed for the
retail of fish/squid balls and native fish sausage ( fish quekiam ) was
identified by the field survey team in Quezon City area. This improved pushcart
(locally known as carreton ) was an initial attempt by a local propane gas
company to focus attention on development of low-cost equipment (see next
section). It was technologically-based and motivated by a desire to improve the
traditional preparation and retailing habits of local vendors and as well as
promote the safe use of propane gas. In Metro Manila, street vendors of fish
balls traditionally prepare and retail their products using poorly designed
wooden pushcarts. According to the improved pushcart operator, the fish balls
and fish quekiam stock is kept in a home refrigerator. During trading
hours she uses an insulated box to store the fish/squid balls and fish
quekiam .

Street vendors should be advised not to store fish balls for
more than three (3) days under chilled storage conditions and to cook them
thoroughly before selling them to their clientele. A research
study [7] suggested that fish balls were included
among the ready-to-eat food items sold by Metro Manilas street food
vendors, which were associated with the risks of cholera infection. However,
that research study concluded that only pansit (rice noodles with shrimp,
meat and vegetables), mussel soup and the absence of piped water at home
remained as risk factors associated with cholera transmission in Metro Manila.
Infrastructure requirements for fish balls vending to ensure that they are
hygienic and safe, will depend on whether the fish balls were prepared at the
vendors home or purchased semi-prepared (ready-to-fry) for completion at
the point of sale. According to the results of the field surveys, most of the
fish/squid balls were processed elsewhere and purchased at wholesale markets by
vendors. At wholesale level, it was observed that most fish/squid balls and quekiam were adequately packed in plastic bags, and kept either chilled
or frozen. Therefore, the main concerns were the storage conditions of
fish/squid balls after purchase and during the time of storage.
Refrigeration/chilled facilities for traditional street seafood vendors were
very limited and were not normally encountered among these vendors during field
surveys. However, block ice was very accessible in Metro Manila; it is widely
used by street vendors to cool soft drinks and for preparation of a traditional
delicacy called halo halo (crushed ice mixed with chopped fruits, milk
and ice cream).

 2.5.1.1 Operation of the Improved
Pushcart

The improved pushcart prototype was constructed locally by a
propane gas company, using stainless steel sheets for the body and a stainless
steel angle frame. The heating system consisted of one cooking stove,
constructed of angle iron frame and fitted with one burner and gas storage tank
with a manual safety on-off valve. The main body was attached to a bicycle with
one turnable and two fixed wheels. A canvas cover with a metallic pipe frame was
fixed to the main body for protection against rain and sunshine. This pushcart
has significant advantages over the traditional carreton , which uses
kerosene-cooking stoves for frying fish balls and are considered more prone to
accidents due to malfunction. It had a well-designed gas cooking stove with a
protective surface against strong draughts, thus avoiding disturbed combustion.
The manufacturer has paid particular attention to the necessity for regular
inspection and maintenance of this equipment, particularly of safety devices, in
order that they may be relied upon to give adequate service to the user. The gas
storage tank was located far away from the heated area of the pushcart and it
was easy to detect any possible gas leaks. It also included adequate storage
space below the worktop which was used to keep an insulated box for chilled
storage of fish balls/squid balls during the trading day.

Traditional pushcarts are constructed in wood, without
adequate chilled storage facilities (insulated boxes), as well as lacking a
suitable worktop area which can be easily cleaned and sanitised. During the
trading day, fish balls are kept at ambient temperature and, as a result, they
deteriorate in quality and value. The use of improved pushcarts, it was
suggested, would improve returns and reduce financial risks to the fish balls
vendor by:
 
i) Increasing marketing range

ii) Maintaining the fish balls in high value condition longer,
thus reducing losses and spoilage.

iii) Reducing the risk to public health from poor quality
products; improving hygienic conditions at the point of sale; improving the
safety of street-vended fish/squid balls and native fish sausage ( fish
quekiam ).

iv) Improving clientele loyalty and encouraging repeat
purchases
 
This street seafood enterprise can be characterised as
small-scale, requiring relatively simple cooking and administrative skills, a
small amount of initial capital to start the business and only basic facilities
at home for storage of raw materials and preparation of sauces. The main capital
input required comprised the purchase of the improved pushcart; this was done
through a special credit arrangement with the propane gas company, with a small
down payment and regular monthly instalments. This scheme was initially aimed at
assisting the development of small-scale fish balls businesses among family
members of the propane gas companys employees, thus ensuring adequate
repayment. The interviewed owner and operator of the improved pushcart can be
characterised as a casual street vendor selling fish balls as a supplement to
other activities.

The operations of this small-scale street seafood business
include the following:
 
i) Forecasting and planning the daily operations.
From the forecasting (based on the experience of the vendors) comes the planning
regarding the number of raw fish/squid balls and native fish sausages ( fish
quekiam ) to carry daily; how much freshly made sweet and sour sauce to
prepare; how many staff will be needed and when;

ii) Organising all needs including regular wholesale purchases
of fish/squid balls, native fish sausages ( fish quekiam ), ingredients for
sauce preparation and non-returnable packaging materials at Divisoria wholesale
market or making arrangements with a wholesaler for regular deliveries of
purchase orders (the squid balls&amp; quekiam vendor interviewed
indicated that she had an arrangement with a wholesaler for deliveries twice a
week). Organising for adequate chilled storage of raw materials to avoid
spoilage. Arranging practical training in the use of equipment and cooking
techniques. Cleaning schedules for all kitchen utensils and the
pushcart.

iii) Controlling of staff and products and preventing
pilferage as well as improving performance. It is important to check that
fish/squid balls and fish quekiam is of the right standard, (that is to
say the correct quality and quantity); checking to prevent waste and that the
staff operates the cooking stove properly. Checking that the cooking times are
correct, avoiding undercooking or excessive shrinkage due to overheating. In
general, vendors start preparing fish/squid balls or quekiam once the
clientele has placed their orders; tried products are normally not kept on
display. Sweet and sour seasoned vinegar and traditional sauces are prepared at
home at least every two days. For each trading day, small quantities of fresh
sauces are placed in plastic dispensers or glass bottles and the leftovers are
removed at the end of the day.

iv) Understanding the preferences, eating habits, purchasing
behaviour and needs of the consumers to encourage repeat purchases. Therefore,
lastly and perhaps most important, a good knowledge of the target market is a
great asset, to be able to formulate simple marketing tactics. A brief analysis
of the competition, namely small low-cost restaurants (locally known as carinderia ) and fast food chains is of some importance. For example, the
apparent declining sales in restaurants and fast food chains in Metro Manila
since 1998 (due to the economic crisis and consequently lower consumer demand)
had positive effects on the sales of street food. As we can easily figure out,
the main target market comprises the younger sector of the population, including
students and workers looking for low-cost, tasty and convenience snacks. We must
realise that lower income consumers (D and E socio-economic
class [8] ) represent about 65 - 70 percent of the
population in Metro Manila and they may be looking for low-cost seafood
products. Small-scale enterprises offering inexpensive seafood products should
consider marketing strategy clearly identifying their seafood products as meant
for price-conscious consumers.

v) As a marketing tool, the sales of soft drinks and the
traditional delicacy locally known as halo halo , helps to provide
consumers with a wider variety of products, which combine well with the main
seafood products offered. In the case of the improved pushcart operator
interviewed, she mentioned that she could offer these additional products,
considering the fact that she currently places her selling point in front of her
home, placing some wooden benches for consumers to sit and enjoy her products.
The halo halo snack is prepared at her kitchen, under good hygienic
conditions using her domestic refrigerator (with a freezing compartment to keep
ice) to store all ingredients. The operators home had a well-designed
kitchen with potable water supply and suitable facilities for hand washing, and
washing dishes and utensils. In addition, suitable sanitation and waste
management facilities were observed at her selling point. Disposable paper
plates and bamboo sticks were used for retailing fish/squid balls and quekiam ; returnable glass cups used for retailing halo halo were
well cleaned with running water and detergent and looked tidy and
clean.
 
The estimated investment costs of the improved pushcart
prototype for street vending fish/squid balls and quekiam are shown in
Table 10. The major investment cost consists of the pushcart itself which is
about US$ 367, representing 95 percent of the total investment cost. The
operator of this improved pushcart indicated that her daily gross sales was on
average, P. Peso 500 to 600 and a daily gross income of P. Peso 300; currently
she was only operating 4 - 5 hours/day and 5 days/week. A daily gross income
when operating 8 hours/day was estimated to be about P. Peso 350 to 480. Average
retail prices of squid balls and quekiam were P. Peso 2 and P. Peso 1 per
piece respectively. The average daily sales were 2 - 3 kg of fish balls and 3 -
4 kg of quekiam. Her target market consisted of mainly middle class
consumers (but also included some D class consumers), in particular, students
and housewives, as well as government workers.

Based on the assumption of an average daily gross income of P.
Peso 400/day and operating 7 days/week, the expected monthly gross income would
be P. Peso 11,200. After accounting for labour costs, electricity, propane gas,
ice, raw materials and equipment depreciation at P. Peso 4,800, it is expected
that monthly net revenues of the improved pushcart would be about P. Peso 6,400.
Assuming that a loan is taken for capital expenditure on the improved pushcart,
the repayment period would be about 10 months, with monthly instalments of P.
Peso 1,500.

Challenging conventional wisdom about the informal sector,
this example documents street fish and fishery products vending as an economic
activity that produces an income ranging from minimum wage to higher than
average income depending on the ownership, working schedules and market
strategies used. It is important to note that most successful street
ready-to-eat fish/squid balls vendors work in the trade for a lifetime, but
there are also a few casual street vendors selling as a supplement to other
activities.

The critical factors affecting the acceptability of the
improved pushcart prototypes in gaining acceptance among street seafood vendors
include the following:
 
i) Provision of adequate credit and
flexible/affordable payment terms, considering the limited financial
capabilities of street seafood vendors. These schemes should also emphasise the
specific benefits of improved technologies and equipment. In simple words, it
should explain what the vendors would miss if they dont own the improved
equipment

ii) Development of improved prototypes suitable for the
different type of seafood snacks/dishes being offered regularly; these would
need to be simple, cost effective and suitable to local conditions

iii) Provision of training programmes to street seafood
vendors on improved hygienic conditions and safety of ready-to-eat seafood
products

iv) Provision of adequate programmes to formalise and monitor
the commercial activities of street seafood vendors aimed at orderly integration
and development of street seafood vending

v) Provision of consumer education programmes to create
awareness on the nutritional quality and safety of street seafood vending under
the proposed improved scheme.
 
Although the use of traditional pushcarts will probably
continue amongst the poorer street fish balls vendors, greater local research
and adaptation would be required to result in the introduction of improved
designs, alternative materials and better features to upgrade food safety and
sanitation. For example, an alternative form of pedal-powered equipment known as
the Oxtrike could be considered as a possible improvement. Its three-speed
gearbox and differential drive overcomes some of the design deficiencies of
traditional tricycles. This modern tricycle is specifically designed for
carrying loads (150 - 300 kg) and could be adapted to improve traditional
pushcarts retailing fish balls. Benefits that would result from using improved
pedal-powered equipment and pushcarts include the following:

 
Less time and
effort may be required to move a mobile cart for vending fish balls. In
addition, the efficiency of street vending may be improved by making fish balls
available to consumers at the right time and place
 
Domestic manufacturers, using
local resources and materials can make low-cost improved pedal-powered equipment
and pushcarts. In addition, the manufacture and maintenance of this low-cost
equipment can provide employment and their use will provide safer ready-to-eat
fishery products at a low investment cost.
