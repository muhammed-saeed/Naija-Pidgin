Plan for fast-food restaurant at high-profile East Parkway location stalls

A deal that would place a fast-food restaurant across from Overton Park, at the southeast corner of East Parkway and Summer, is at least in limbo and may have fallen through, according to some of the parties involved.

&quot;I&apos;ve canceled my contract,&quot; said Larry Mayall, one owner of two abutting pieces of property needed by a hamburger chain.

The negotiations are now &quot;in limbo,&quot; said Lee McWaters of McWaters&amp;Associates, the broker representing the owner of the other, corner lot, where a gas station once stood.

&quot;They had a snag with some of their due diligence,&quot; McWaters said of the chain, which he identified only as a national restaurant franchise. &quot;They haven&apos;t pulled out yet. ... I think we need another month or so.&quot;

But Mayall, who is also principal with First National Realty, said he has pulled out of the restaurant negotiations because other prospective buyers are interested in his vacant apartments. He owns the long-vacant Overton Manor Apartments, at 528 E. Parkway North.

The restaurant would have needed that half-acre plus the cleared, corner lot, four-tenths of an acre.

Meanwhile, Mayall said he has been receiving calls from others interested in buying and rehabbing his 16-unit apartment building.

The location has the &quot;hottest potential&apos;&apos; considering its proximity to Overton Park, Rhodes College, the Fairgrounds and the zoo, and the number of cars that pass by, Mayall said.

The apartment building may look in poor condition, but stripped to its studs, it&apos;s &quot;as solid as the rock of Gibraltar,&quot; he said.

&quot;I think it&apos;s kind of the ugly stepsister right now on that block. But given its proximity and the amount of real estate that surrounds it, I just think it&apos;s a sleeper.&apos;&apos;

About a decade ago, neighborhood associations and other organizations successfully opposed a proposal to put a Walgreens on the same corner. They fought commercialization on the historic parkway system and demolition of the then-occupied apartments, built in the 1920s.

The property is zoned for residential use.

Shame on you, Mr. Mayall for allowing that property to remain in that condition for so long!

Just what we need in one of the fattest, most unhealthy cities the country....another fast food restaurant.

The fact that it would be that close to Overton Park makes this deal that much worse!

I hope this deal stays off the table.

If that apt building can be rehabbed, then now is the time to do it. Broad Ave is booming and there will soon be a greenline connector running through there.

+1 absolutely!

In fact, property tax should be calculated on what a property would be worth if it were properly maintained. Otherwise, it is cheaper for absent property owners to do nothing but bring the rest of the neighborhood down!

Yeah....the old place looks awful, but really...those apts were ancient. I&apos;ll bet it would have taken a huge sum of dough to renovate the building into something livable by today&apos;s standards. My guess is that it&apos;s pretty expensive to have something razed, too. I&apos;d love to know what the proposed plans of the other bidder may be...

They use the highest and best use appraisals. If not, how do they defend some of these exorbitantly high appraisals.

If your house is falling down after a tree fell on it last year...you will get the same appraisal as you got last year.

That property is and has been an eyesore for many years. The names of people like Mr. Mayall should be publicized more often so the public can know who is to blame for this sort of blight that drags us all down.

Good for him for pulling out of the burger joint contract. It&apos;s a good apartment building in a good location. So rehab it already.

Somehow I think Joan West and her merry band of busybodies are somehow behind this. I really doubt that apartment building can be rehabbed. It&apos;s set vacant for several years now and no telling how bad it is inside. Joan blocked a Walgreens store from going there. I believe they built a new one almost across the street instead. High traffic corners like this are too valuable except for fast food, gas stations, and other commercial applications. It&apos;s not gonna be residential.

June West (not Joan) doesn&apos;t do anything. She represents the wants of a group of property owners (tax payers). If there wasn&apos;t a large base of support, then Memphis Heritage would not exist.
June West and Memphis Heritage had nothing at all to do with this. If they did, it would have been public information.
Why would the owner of the apartment building lie about whether it can be rehabbed or not?
It would actually be to his benefit to say that it can&apos;t be rehabbed. Then he could justify selling to a fast food joint or a dollar store.

Uh...it&apos;s June, not Joan, and as I recall, the MH folks did rally against a Walgreens going up on that corner. Whether or not they get the glory or the blame, depending on how one thinks about it, for it not going up, I&apos;m not sure.

I used to live there as well! However, nothing much happened in my apartment, so my walls wouldn&apos;t be saying much, except&quot;paint me.&quot;

I was in the audience at the council meeting that blocked the Walgreen&apos;s. The reason people thought it was unnecessary was that there was a Walgreen&apos;s already across the street from it and Walgreen&apos;s wanted to tear down the apartments across the street to build a new one. At the time the renters of the apartment didn&apos;t want to be evicted from their apartment and the neighborhood didn&apos;t want the Scenic Parkways ordinance to be dismantled for a redundant Walgreen&apos;s.

Of course, all this was done with the belief that the owner of the apartment complex wouldn&apos;t be an awful person and let his building turn to junk. A refurbished apartment building with Broad Street coming into its own would be valuable to the community. That area&apos;s already got enough fast food and gas stations.

Larry Mayall is the worst kind of opportunist. He has mastered the art of promoting his various business interests. However in this instance, the public has seen a peek of his true character. He would rather let his&quot;sleeper&quot;of an investment continue to decline while he waits for a better offer. It is an eyesore that affects not only the neighborhood residents but to the vistors of Overton Park. Fine him, Mayor Wharton!
