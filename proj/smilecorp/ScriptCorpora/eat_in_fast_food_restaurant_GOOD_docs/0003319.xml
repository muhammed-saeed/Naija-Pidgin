 New Super Computer Has The Power Of 2 Million Laptops??? 
 
 Posted On 2:33 PM

                                   As of last year 2011, what was once thought to be decades away has been debuted and whats left to ponder is what it means for our world. Since the early 1980&apos;s IBM has been developing a super computer...not just any super computer....one that has the power of two million laptops! The Sequoia puts the top 500 super computers in the world to shame and while it has made history it will dramatically change the future of not only our lives but our world as well...whether we like these changes or not. Announced at The American Physical Society in Boston by IBM, the multi-billion dollar empire was contracted by the U.S. government to build such a computer. Amazing, huh?Lets take a look at some of the capabilities of a super computer that can make the technological advances of the past 40 years look like child&apos;s play and why some would have a problem with a super computer being able to make our world dramatically better or dramatically worse in the hands of the exceedingly wealthy and greedy.
             The basis of a super computer (.....and the Sequoia exceeds this...) is that it replaces regular binary bits &quot;1&quot; when on and &quot;0&quot; when off with quantum bits that have the ability to be &quot;1&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, or both simultaneously. However, although tremendously faster super computers was the expectation, the quantum bits were previously too unstable for use yet scientists have found a way to reduce their instability enough to put them on a chip...hence, the Sequoia, the only complete and solely quantum computer in the world. The speed of it is hard to imagine and it contains a whopping 1.6 million processors that work mind-bogglingly fast...in fact the word &quot;fast&quot; is an understatement. Well what can it do? The super computer developed in the 1970&apos;s created all of the technological advancements we have today...like advancements in weather prediction, code breaking, encrypting and decrypting and so forth. This in turn has effected us by allowing more accurate models to be made. This is a crucial and key point. Models make up the entire world of technology and technology makes up our entire world. More accurate models effects business, money, capital, industries, politics and everything else you can think of. The Sequoia creates faster and amazingly accurate models, more accurate than any super computer ever created. This computer, belief or not, allows pharmaceutical industries to simulate the effect of drugs in the human body, giving them more control over whats getting put out in our world and what it can do to us. More power is not what the drug industries need but they now have it. This super computer also allows Wall Street to simulate the effects of events on the stock market, hence the appearance of man made catastrophes in the name of politics...because Wall Street is the vehicle for politics. The Sequoia can simulate human blood flow. This either means two things, crazy advancements in cloning...like cloning maybe...humans! Or it could mean creating artificial intelligence that isn&apos;t so artificial. All making sense yet? A super computer of this magnitude does not only have the power to change our world but it also the power to destroy it.
              The U.S government has allowed the use of the Sequoia to simulate nuclear testing for the U.S Department of Energy at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Yes, the super computers main use is for war. What did you think it was for? Making our lives better?
In conclusion, the love of money and insatiable greed has put the fate of our world into the hand of computers....excuse me...SUPER computers.

 Racism is Taught. Stop Teaching It! 
 
 Posted On 10:47 AM

by Olivia Marie Jones 0

                     In reality, racism still exists and is NEVER going to end. Sounds a bit harsh but it is indeed true simply because there will never stop being different types of races on our planet. As long as there&apos;s races there will be racism. However, has anyone ever taken the time to analyze the behaviour of children? Sure! We all have at some point, right? Children are always asking questions, exploring and trying to find out more and more about this world we live in, mostly because they&apos;re new here. This behavior implies what we already know is true; Kids don&apos;t know everything! That means to a child, unless he is taught to see people as different from himself, everyone is the same to him! Shocking, huh?
           Racism is not inherited. Its not a trait that gets passed down through our blood and through our genial lineage. Racism is taught. The only way that this ugly set of beliefs can be stopped is to stop the teaching of it to our future generations. This means our children.
          Would you agree that kids learn even when we don&apos;t want them to? Whatever you do you can almost trust that they are right behind you doing the same thing because they want to be like us. We&apos;re all that they know! This can be understandably frustrating, especially when you&apos;re doing and saying things you wouldn&apos;t want them to do or say. Yet the fact remains, children learn everything they are taught and we as adults never cease to be teachers, whether of good things or bad things. This is sadly how racism is carried on through generations in spite of years of trying to be corrected. One racial slur belted out in a fit of rage or softly whispered because you think no one is around to hear you is in fact being heard by the tiniest of ears. Comments and jokes that contain racially insensitive content is not &quot;just a joke&quot; or &quot;just a comment&quot;. Its racism in its biggest form because of the fact that its taken so lightly. To think how many times a child encounters or over hears a racist remark or term expressed in everyday life is appalling considering that there are actually some people who literally tell their children not to associate or to be afraid of, and generally frown upon a certain race of people or all races that are not their own. Then there&apos;s the media, and though we cannot hide from it, we can counteract it by our own simple choice. We must choose to change ourselves first in order for racism to stop effecting future generations and though it is a change we all must make, each person must make their own personal commitment to stop teaching racism in our deeds, actions, habits, words, and beliefs because aren&apos;t these the real things that make us who we are?

 Haiti Two Years Later: A Million Haitians Still Homeless 
 
 Posted On 6:14 PM

                     Two years ago January 12, a completely devastating earthquake hit the country of Haiti, a country that was already known to be one of the most poorest countries, and now the number of homeless and hungry has increased! Since the earthquake there has been over $4.6 billion pledged to the rebuilding of Haiti by donors across the globe yet experts reveal the shocking truth that it could very well be ten years before any &quot;visual&quot; recovery is made in the country. After two long years only a measly 43% of relief funds have been disbursed and still over 500,000 Haitians are without homes, not to mention the millions without food or decent amenities.           So where did all the money go???? Watchdog groups claim that charities failed to govern and facilitate the funds properly, importing overpriced equipment and supplies /personnel, and shelling out millions for board members in high end renting. Another pitiful account for the funding is campaigns that cost millions! Telling people to help Haiti costed more than actually helping the country! Organizations, groups, charities, television appearances, newly formed social societies all in the name of the country&apos;s earthquake sucked the funding dry by the millions, leaving a still suffering Haiti to wonder does anyone care at all.       American Red Cross, one of the largest organizations that fled to Haiti&apos;s rescue received a staggering $486 million in donations following the country&apos;s earthquake. They however announced that their main focus would be on building &quot;permanent&quot; homes and repairing the damaged ones instead of constructing temporary residences. So basically this means that they would rather take years to build permanent housing and risk the lives and safety of millions of women and children than to act now and build a home, permanent or temporary, to satisfy the quite obvious needs of the Haitian people. Poor excuse and reasoning in every one&apos;s book I&apos;m sure. According to president and CEO of the American Red Cross, Gail McGovern, &quot;Recovery is well underway&quot;. This statement is quickly contradicted pictures and first hand accounts of the suffering of people in Haiti two years later.         So is there hope for Haiti? Oxfam, an organization created to solve infrastructure problems in Haiti states, &quot;The second anniversary of the devastating earthquake must be a call to action!&quot; (Cecilia Millan, Oxfam&apos;s country director in Haiti). While this sounds a tad bit promising, another organization offers a quite clear perspective on reality. &quot;Quite honestly, donor funding is never going to be enough&quot;, says Tom Adams, U.S State Department&apos;s Haiti special coordinator to the Miami Herald. &quot;In some areas we are really just starting&quot;.

 New Found Liberty To A New Generation of Iraqi Youth 
 
 Posted On 7:45 PM

by Olivia Marie Jones 0

                    War doesn&apos;t always destroy and divide, no matter how much it is meant to. The human spirit can&apos;t be outlawed and neither can it be snuffed out by machine guns, bombs, tear gas or the pain and sorrow of loved ones lost in battle along with bitter memories of terror at home. According to popular sources as American military forces leave Iraq and the war life behind they also leave a bit of hope and liberation in the shining eyes of Iraqi youth who have now took to many of America&apos;s cultural expression. Hip Hop has now become just one of the parts of American culture infiltrated in a society teeming with Iraqi youth. Others are dialect, rap, popular art forms and music, dancing, clothing, and even life goals and aspirations. Freedom and liberty may not have always been an option but anyone can argue that expressing oneself sure beats the tyranny of a strict government and the misery of living a life of constant social and religious restraint such as the ones lived by Iraqi youth for years. For these teens a new culture infiltration is a great release, a liberation that war can&apos;t bring. The youth have this form of liberation and made it their own, adopting a free culture&apos;s way of living and that change can be the beginnings of a new day in Iraq for so many! While some may see the American culture with its hip hop music, rap, tattoos, slang, and other forms of self expression as a nuisance to society, many may not consider what it may mean to an Iraqi youth who has spent his life dreaming about having freedom of expression in a highly militaristic nation occupied by armed forces day and night.                      It has been estimated that with eight million Iraqi born since American troops first invaded the country in 2003, half of the country&apos;s population is under the age of 19. Can you imagine growing up in a country where all you know and see is war, restriction, danger, and loss? Can you fathom how hard it would be to express who you are and what you want, how you feel, and your dreams in a place where dreams died everyday with killed family members which add to the drop in the economic status of the people living there? All would understand the loss of spirit but instead the Iraqi youth have taken a piece of American culture into their lives and to them this is their freedom, a way to express themselves because they never got a chance to.                      &quot;While others may stop being rappers after the Americans leave, I will go on till I reach N.Y&quot;, says Mohammed who teaches part time at a primary school and carries his new found dream of being heard by millions. He is just one of the many youth that have taken to American hip hop culture as a way of expressing himself, his life, his struggles, and his opinions that have otherwise been silenced.                  Just like American youth, Iraqi youth now enjoy the liberties of their age group. They go to movies, Rollerblade, eat pizza and hamburgers, sport the latest clothing and hair styles, listen to rock, rap, hip hop, and R&amp;B, and most have facebook profiles they keep up with. To many older Iraqi citizens this behavior seems quite disturbing and in some ways sacrilegious to how they were accustomed to life as a youth.              Losing friends of different beliefs, family members suddenly disappearing in the night....its no wonder the new generation of Iraqi citizens have taken to America&apos;s liberating culture and have gone as far as to learn English as well, all of these things being introduced to them by American troops who occupied the country for eight years and have become a sort of idol to the youth there. &quot;I love the American soldiers&quot;, says Mohammed Adnan, a 15 year old boy living in Baghdad, a city known for its Anti-American terrorist groups that threaten violence against U.S. troops who stay in the city after 2011.            Cellphones, TV, and internet all seemed like a dream come true to youth after the harsh dictatorship of Saddam Hussein. Iraqi society is changing and small liberties bring light to the eyes of its youth who fill the streets with break dancing, doing the craziest moves and most amazing flips like the best of them in the 1980&apos;s American hip hop culture. However there are many adult Iraqi who oppose this. They argue that their youth are imitating American culture because they feel that by this they will obtain a higher status in life or because they simply want to rebel now that they are free to. The Iraqi society leaders also argue that the population of poor people in Iraq exceeds the number of poor Americans by half and the effects of American culture on a nation of such low economic status will be devastating. Or will it? Can true freedom of expression be a light in a dark tunnel for the youth of Iraq who hold the future of the country in their hands? Can what seems to be the negative aspects of one country be taken and used to bring out the positive aspects of another? Why don&apos;t we ask the Iraqi kids who are now learning to play baseball instead of how to operate a machine gun.

 Do Short-Lived Celebrity Marriages Give Holy Matrimony A Bad Look? 
 
 Posted On 8:53 PM

              We all know that no one is perfect and even the people that are idolized in our society for their appearance or special talents are sure as heck not perfect, having all of their most vulnerable moments strewn into the public eye day after day. How many embarrassing celebrity moments have we seen on television and the web....the public breakdowns....the legal drama... the list never ends! Still, with all of this being realized, we as human beings idolize each other all the more when fame is involved...no matter what we hear or see about each other. Take celebrities for example. We still listen to their music, flaunt their fashion line, sell-out their movies on the big screen and tune in to their reality shows faithfully. Could this be creating a responsibility on celebrities subconsciously? Being in the public eye means you definitely have a responsibility to the public in what you do and how you portray yourself. The slightest misunderstanding can cause a on-sleight of unwanted trends. Celebrity looks aren&apos;t the only thing beings copied or made apart of the life of the average population of their viewers. Even personalities, motives, and alarmingly so, many beliefs are adopted as well due to the words and actions of many of the rich and famous. Like marriage! Being married in the celebrity world surely doesn&apos;t mean &quot;til death do us part&quot;. In fact, marriages in the public eye could begin and end as fast 24 hours! Could this atrocious fact slowly be giving marriage a bad look?                              To many people around the globe, marriage is not a casual union, neither is it a mere shallow agreement. In some countries, religions, and cultures, marriage is a most sacred act and is done not out of selfish ambition or with the intent to end it in 72 days. These beliefs have held up and esteemed marriage in the eyes of people everywhere, so much so that as children we are taught that marriage is an honor, an achievement, and a lifelong commitment to look forward to with someone that you love. Many religions consecrate marriages in the presence of a minister, priest, or holy clergy signifying the holiness of the act, meaning that it is a commitment made in the acknowledgement of both God and man. For marriage in the public eye to be taken so casually could even be found as blasphemous but because money and fame are two of the most valued things in our society, this idea is overlooked and swept under the carpet.                             Lets slow down here! You may be thinking that celebrities aren&apos;t the only people on earth who get married with false intentions and impure motives and they certainly aren&apos;t the only people getting married and divorced within the same year. You are correct! However there is a major difference between what I do and what someone else does with the fame and fortune of Kim Kardashian. You have never met me in your life and you probably never knew me before you came across this blog. Kim Kardashian is a well known figure and even though you probably never met her, you&apos;d bet your bottom dollar that you knew about her and so does the rest of the world for Pete&apos;s sake! When I go out to eat people don&apos;t take pictures of what I&apos;m wearing and post them in everyday fashion magazines around the world for women to idolize and try to mimic. Do you see what I&apos;m saying? What the average citizen does is non-existent to some extent compared to what a celebrity does and how it effects people. A simple outing for me does not change fashion history or cause a media frenzy. So for a celebrity to partake in a sacred union and break it in 72 days is like giving the okay to their fans and the general public to denounce marriage and all that it stands for....after all, marriages come and go! This the wrong idea to have about a life-long relationship and commitment! Marriage is a commitment and commitments are born out of convenience or someone having too much to drink and suddenly feeling loved. When its portrayed as such by people who are highly respected in some way, the morals and values of such a decision begins to die. People begin to form unwise similarities in society between dating and getting married. Dating is not the same a marriage. Dating someone for 72 days is different from marrying them for 72 days but our minds have become so numb to the fact that such short and unthought-out decisions are made in the eye of the media that we say, &quot;Oh, well&quot;, instead of saying &quot; This is horrible&quot;. Our reactions have become so passive to the promotion of what is wrong and the demotion of what is right. This is extremely dangerous because who is going to hold up our beliefs if we don&apos;t. No one. They disappear like &quot;the gentlemen&quot;, or &quot;the virgin&quot;. Such things don&apos;t hold value anymore and are forgotten, seen as ancient characteristics. The sad part is that ancient characteristics almost always belong to a once great civilization that now belongs to history.
