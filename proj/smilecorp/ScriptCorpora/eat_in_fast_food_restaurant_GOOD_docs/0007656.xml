View Full Version : Golden Select Laminate Flooring @ Costco - any experiences? 
 
 RTM Jul 10th, 2009, 11:20 PM This flooring was mentioned in another thread back in 2008, and I&apos;m wondering if anyone has used it? It&apos;s imported and distributed by jsonic (http://www.jsonic.ca/flo_laminate.php) and is made in China.

It works out to about $1.83 per square foot, includes 3 different plank lengths per box, has the foam backing pre-applied to the back of each panel (saving the cost of a foam sheet underneath the floor.

I&apos;m looking at a project where my (5/8&quot;plywood) subfloor with vapour barrier is ready and nailed down.

My other brand is Kronotex (made in Germany) Beaufort Sacramento Pine (http://www.kronotexusa.com/beaufort-collection.htm) for about $2.13 per square foot.

Any real-world experiences from fellow RFDers ?

Rob CSK&apos;sMom Jul 10th, 2009, 11:31 PM Yep and there is even discussion of Costco laminate in this forum.

We did out living room, dining room and hallway earlier this year in the Golden Select from Costco in the walnut. Not a single person that has walked into our house since we put it down can tell it&apos;s laminate, they all think it&apos;s hardwood. It doesn&apos;t&quot;ting&quot;like cheap laminate thanks to the HDF core and has the wood grain embossed into the boards along with the&quot;v&quot;groove edges. Because it&apos;s HDF it&apos;s more water resistent as well. We left all the scraps sitting out in the rain for weeks and they didn&apos;t swell and could still be properly clicked together. It goes together beautifully and the edges don&apos;t chip like the cheap stuff. Transitions to match can be bought at HD as well.

Hubby is a flooring installer by trade and none of his contacts could come even close to the price of Costco for a similar product. Even at cost + 5% we couldn&apos;t get a similar product for under $5/sqft. Just make sure you buy a couple of extra boxes to be absolutely sure you have enough.

Not sure why you have vapour barrier down though.. ;) zoolander Jul 10th, 2009, 11:57 PM We have this in our basement office, sits on DeltaFL (http://www.deltafl.com/) (avail at Lowes) and nothing else. It is level and over the year no separating seams have developed which I was afraid of because we didn&apos;t put down a plywood subfloor. In Maple colour, the minor scratches are difficult to see, not sure of the same if you used a darker colour.
Upstairs in our main family room, I&apos;d like to put down this laminate I saw at HomeDepot, it is the strongest laminate I&apos;d ever come across, keys could not scratch the sample, can&apos;t remember the name, was $4 or $5/sf. virgoan Jul 13th, 2009, 01:41 PM We just bought 20 boxes of these laminate floor...have not install it yet...but they do looks good! We are planning to put it on 1/2&quot;plywood w/ ridgid insulation board underneath... Went with Oak colour... beachmom Jul 13th, 2009, 01:59 PM We bought the walnut laminate for our kids playroom in the basement. Its only been in for a few weeks, but it really looks great!

Our contractor really liked the rubber foam backing on it too. Saved him extra work installing it Matrix_dot_ca Jul 21st, 2009, 01:18 PM Can someone post pictures of this laminate flooring.

Rob

I installed Kronotex last year in my condo rental. Along with the laminate I also used a rubber underlay. Once installed, I never wore my shoes or slippers on it. It felt very soft and smooth. Secondly my carpenter buddy dropped his hammer about 3 feet in the air and not a single scratch. My tennants love the new flooring they received!!!! The rating on the flooring that I installed by Kronotex (can&apos;t remember the exact name) was AC5 (commercial grade)

sk entilza Jul 26th, 2009, 11:15 PM Where do you get the Kronotex in Toronto?

I am considering the Golden Select at Costco, it looks very nice compared to the stuff I saw at homedepot and the price seems great.

Currently It&apos;s $44 per box ~ 23 sqft per box.

I think it was 14mm very thick, also has the underpadding.

I am considering this for the master bedroom and maybe upstairs hallway.. Any other comments on this? Thx entilza Sep 11th, 2009, 10:18 PM Just a bump, I noticed this flooring at Costco on sale today for $34.99 a box $7 off per box.. I am very interested in this, it looks like very good quality at the store atleast when I compared to stuff I&apos;ve seen at HomeDepot, etc.

~ 22 sq/box pretty good.
14mm thick with foam backer
Textured laminate, looks like it has a groove too.

Anyway let me know if anyone else has experience with this. I am about to pull the trigger on this.

There was two styles one walnut the other a lighter/orange/red finish.

I would do your search on RFD first. I remember when the Costco flooring first went on sale everyone was raving about it. However once their project was complete most of the RFDers swore never again as the install was a pain!!!

Does the 14mm include the attached underpadding?

It&apos;s made by someone else now (in China?). I thinks it&apos;s different from the original Costco laminate

The original Costco laminate was called&quot;Allegria&quot;and was made in Canada by Uniboard. The company that owns Uniboard then bought out Pergo and now it&apos;s products are all sold under the Pergo name brand. CSK&apos;sMom Sep 12th, 2009, 10:57 AM We&apos;ve had ours installed since spring and still loving it. It&apos;s been through hell this summer as well with other renos, painting, new furniture, 2 dogs, 3 kids and one of them moving out. Not a scratch or any other issues.

Yes norm, this stuff has a 2mm rubber underlay attached right to the boards. As I said earlier in the thread, even with all of hubby&apos;s contacts at the retail level and all of them pretty much selling to us at cost +5% no one could even come close to this stuff at the same quality level. Add in the attached rubber underlay on the Costco laminate and it was a no brainer for us. entilza Sep 13th, 2009, 04:11 PM Ok, Thanks I guess I will try it.

It&apos;s 14 mm with the backer I think the foam backer is like 2mm.

It&apos;s made by Jsonic, yes from China. I&apos;m not sure if Jsonic has changed the name from anything else I saw the older threads on RFD but wasn&apos;t sure if it was the same product.

They also have Hardwood at a reasonable price as well. CSK&apos;sMom Sep 13th, 2009, 05:03 PM Just make sure you buy a couple of extra boxes entilza. As we all know with Costco, it can be there today and gone tomorrow... Keelie Sep 13th, 2009, 05:29 PM I would do your search on RFD first.

A pain to install yes.
After 2 years not a mark on it and have had 6 people think it was real hard wood... to me thats worth all the pain :) entilza Sep 13th, 2009, 08:43 PM Just make sure you buy a couple of extra boxes entilza. As we all know with Costco, it can be there today and gone tomorrow...

Lol Ya thanks, That was one thing that concerned me, they did have quite a large number of skids of this stuff there so if I do like it I may stock up...

I liked the Walnut version and I figure if I ever do another room a walnut texture is pretty common so... But thanks..... Good luck to anyone else who goes with this stuff... virgoan Sep 13th, 2009, 10:32 PM Just a bump, I noticed this flooring at Costco on sale today for $34.99 a box $7 off per box..

Hi entilza,

Do how long is the sale? Konowl Sep 14th, 2009, 12:22 AM I was going to go with Home Depot stuff due to my $500 gift card but if everyone raves about this stuff I might give it a shot.... price is good! What colours ARE available though - thing I hate about Costco in Ottawa is that, while there are three locations, each location can have different colours of flooring, and I have no way of getting a sample to take it home to see how it looks.

What colour is best for small places? I&apos;m assuming a light colour... Quick_lude Sep 14th, 2009, 01:00 AM A pain to install yes.
After 2 years not a mark on it and have had 6 people think it was real hard wood... to me thats worth all the pain :)
A pain to install? :confused: We put down about 400 sqft for a client and it wasn&apos;t bad, with the proper tools of course. The only thing that&apos;s a pain is that you pretty much have to lay down each board individually. virgoan Sep 14th, 2009, 07:27 AM A pain to install? :confused: We put down about 400 sqft for a client and it wasn&apos;t bad, with the proper tools of course.

What kind of tools do you need to install this thing? I thought all we need is a hammer and a piece of 2x4? t3359 Sep 14th, 2009, 07:55 AM What kind of tools do you need to install this thing? I thought all we need is a hammer and a piece of 2x4?

We did a few rooms with non-Costco laminate (Uniclic/Autoclic from Quick Style) using the Traffic Master kit from Home Depot... had a plastic block (instead of the 2x4), a pull bar, and a bunch of spacers... think it was less than $20.

Mitre saw, jig saw, etc etc...

bjl BushCaddy Sep 14th, 2009, 08:08 AM I called Costco, and the lady there said the sale was on until the 27th.

At this price I&apos;m going to do my whole upstairs. virgoan Sep 14th, 2009, 09:08 AM I called Costco, and the lady there said the sale was on until the 27th.

Sweet! Thanks!

I am gonna get a big price adjustment! Just bought 44 boxes at $43.49/box beachmom Sep 14th, 2009, 12:29 PM How long will Costco honour a price adjustment for? We bought ours in June- can I still get a price adjustment now? mmhassa2 Sep 14th, 2009, 12:43 PM Can anyone post some photos of the flooring installed? virgoan Sep 14th, 2009, 02:20 PM How long will Costco honour a price adjustment for? We bought ours in June- can I still get a price adjustment now?

In the past...they have always been really good about it...even if it was like 6 months old...they don&apos;t really care...

I got mine in July...it has been more than 2 months...but I think it shouldn&apos;t be a problem..i&apos;ll report back after my price adjustment tonight. beachmom Sep 14th, 2009, 03:52 PM I went to Costco at lunch, and got $125 back in price adjustments. Some of the laminate was bought in May, and some in July. They did the adjustment on both, with out a problem!

THANKS so much, for telling me about the sale!! virgoan Sep 14th, 2009, 10:01 PM Just got back from Costco...got my price adjustment...no hassle at all..except they took about an hour to do it...apparently, it&apos;s&quot;too complex&quot;for most of them...they have to call on their supervisor/manager to do it.

Worth the wait tho...got $295.63 back...sweet! Thanks RFD! fireguy9 Sep 14th, 2009, 10:37 PM We&apos;ve had ours installed since spring and still loving it.

what kind of dogs we talking? We have a 6ft bernese mtn dog (bear) 130lbs and size 12 paws with claws that can do serious damage. He does the scooby doo burnout to get in motion when he stands up on hard wood or such. So far he has not been able to destroy or scratch our uniclic tile laminant, but others he has destroyed and of course hardwood is disasterous.
Would love to replace the 50yr old hardwood which now looks very rustic and worn right out but it has to withstand the dog or we wait til there is no dog. lak8 Sep 14th, 2009, 11:14 PM I just got a price adjustments for my hardwood flooring today which i must say was a big hassle!!!.

At first i ask for a price adjustment. The lady said no problem ok hold on, and talks to the mangers on the phone... comes back and says sorry, cant give you any money back since its over the due date... I was only 7 days over the 60 days policy for the adjustment. I explain the whole situation tiring to be as nice as i could possibly be, but no dice.. her and the manger seem to be buddy buddy and wont budge and thought they were going to make a statement thinking there some kind of costco law enforcers. They were not going to do it at all (made her speak to the manager twice). I was very polite at the beginning but all gloves had to come off. I Basicly said... Look i don&apos;t me to be rude, but basicly whats stopping me from making you guys load it onto the pallet, me pay for it, and walking it right back over to you at custom service and use my old receipt to take this **** back. LOL Needless to say my refund was back on my CC within 30secs. :!: Some times you just have to show who is boss CSK&apos;sMom Sep 14th, 2009, 11:25 PM what kind of dogs we talking?

My dogs are rough on floors. A jack and a jack-a-poo. The pure jack has the typical terrier feet made for digging, complete with naturally long nails. They literally do the scoobydo slide while running circles around the main floor. From hallway to kitchen to living/diningroom at full speed while&quot;playing&quot;. They destroyed a prefinished hardwood floor within a yr at our last house. I will never, ever make that mistake again (prefinished hardwood). I guess that&apos;s why I always chuckle at some of the knuckleheads around here that insist laminate is ghetto and destroys a houses&apos; resale value. May be true for cheap .79 cent wide board, first generation laminates but definitely not for the current generations of laminates like the single board, v-grooves. b dubbin Sep 14th, 2009, 11:27 PM Well, I bit the bullet and bought 24 boxes of Walnut to do my basement. I just came across the sale by fluke (I was willing to pay $43.99/box) and came here to let everyone know, but obviously I&apos;m a few days behind.

Sure glad there was still some in stock as I&apos;ve been eyeing this stuff for a few months now. I&apos;ll let you all know what I think of the product once it&apos;s installed in a couple months. canukeneh Sep 16th, 2009, 12:31 AM I installed over 600 sq ft of the walnut on my main floor two months ago when it was on sale earlier (not quite as cheap as it is now), and it was a snap, literally. The hardest part is cutting edges if you don&apos;t have square walls (i.e. around islands or walls that run at an angle). You shouldn&apos;t have a lot of scrap left if you pay attention to what you are doing, and mixing up the various lengths. BTW I should mention that this is the first time I have installed laminate, and we have gotten compliments from everyone that has seen it.

Lastly, before buying the laminate at costco, we had looked everywhere, other big box stores like rona, home depot, totem, and specialty flooring stores, and it seemed like anything equivalent to this flooring was selling for twice as much. Anything that sold for roughly the same price per sq ft was nowhere near the same quality, and quick frankly looked cheap. While I could go in for a price adjustment, I won&apos;t cause I still got a good price on it, and their price protection policy is normally 30 days. While I know costco tends to be flexible, I don&apos;t want to abuse this as if everybody does, we will see prices go up, or much stricter changes in return policies, as they have done so with their electronics. In all honesty, even at the regular price, this product is well worth the money and far superior to others at this price point and higher.

Hope this helps people on the fence. Also, I forgot to mention that this product is great to walk on, not as hard as other laminates. napoleon1769 Sep 16th, 2009, 01:38 AM How many boxes do you need to do an average bedroom? Is everything included in the box or do you need tools and extra padding or material? I don&apos;t know anything. Keelie Sep 16th, 2009, 10:25 AM How many boxes do you need to do an average bedroom?

If you read through this thread I believe all your questions will be answered. I recall seeing one box covers 22sq feet, the padding is already attached and you will have to look yourself for the needed supplies. Konowl Sep 18th, 2009, 01:29 AM I&apos;m going to pick some up to do my 600 sq ft house this weekend (yes you read that right) and really can&apos;t decide on colour. The walnut, which I believe is the darker of the two colours availalbe, looks fantastic (fair bit better than the lighter one) but I think it will just make my house look too small. The light colour is still nice, but... ugh... decisions decisions... asennad Sep 18th, 2009, 03:01 PM Laminate is a very low end flooring product in my opinion. If you are going to use it the best option is the Ikea flooring for about $1.25 square foot.

If you are willing to pay anymore than that then I would just go with a hardwood. Seen some good ones at Rona for around $3.

Obviously you know nothing about Laminate as there are cheap laminates, and there are higher end quality laminates. shybutsly Sep 18th, 2009, 07:45 PM ... there are cheap laminates, and there are higher end quality laminates.

Precisely, I couldn&apos;t agree more. I am currently looking at laminate to replace a 3 yr old engineered hardwood that scratches when you look at it the wrong way. I am considering the golden select based on these great reviews. I really don&apos;t want to make a second mistake on my flooring choice.

The sad part is that when I originally looked I was shown wilsonart laminate, but choose the engineered because it was a bit cheaper and I would have &apos;real&apos; hardwood. Oh well, live and learn. asennad Sep 18th, 2009, 10:02 PM :rolleyes: and we care about your uneducated&quot;opinion&quot;why?

High end laminate is like lipstick on a pig. No matter how much you pay for laminate it&apos;s still laminate. To many people - anybody with taste - laminate is always going to be a lowend flooring.

I hate to tell you but you obviously don&apos;t read many&quot;real world&quot;real estate listings. My educated opinion (hubby a flooring installer for almost 25 years ;) ) is that todays pre-finished hardwood is absolute crap for houses that are actually lived in. I have lived with very high end pre-finished hardwood and it was utter crap. Within 1 year with 3 kids ad 2 dogs the floor was a mess. And I won&apos;t even get ito the stains comin through the wood under the finish due to it not being a continuous finish on the floor. Today&apos;s hardwoods are nothing like the hardwood from 30-50 years ago. They are from managed forests resulting in much softer woods with much looser grains. They dent and scratch even when babied. Most folks want to actually live in their house and walk on their floors and not have to worry about ruining their floors.... :rolleyes:

For gods sake,, dont type something when you know jack squat about it:idea:
Your lack of knowledge shines on the laminate topic.
I have a high end laminate that is in my entrance and goes into kitchen and dining room. You cannot even tell it is laminate unless you touch it. It will not scratch and its 5yrs old now and we have a monster of a dog (130lbs,6ft) with big claws that totalled our hardwood and yet to do a thing to the laminate. mork Sep 19th, 2009, 10:39 AM why turn this thread into a debate about hard wood versus laminate.

Anyways, I had a look at this yesterday in Costco and it looks amazing for the price. I am going to buy it to do my yet-to-be-finished basement in.

My immediate preference was for the darker walnut.. but I am wondering if I am better off go lighter for a basement. Could anyone who has installed either colour post some pictures? Hugh Jass Sep 19th, 2009, 03:49 PM I hate to tell you but you obviously don&apos;t read many&quot;real world&quot;real estate listings.

Actually, as much as he&apos;s ill-informed about the advantages of laminate over hardwood, he&apos;s right about real estate listings. I&apos;ve looked at hundreds, if not thousands of listings over the past year and it&apos;s rare than laminate floors are highlighted the way hardwood is.

FWIW, we have both in our house. I would advise laminate in basements and high traffic areas ( esp with pets) and hardwood in living rooms and bedrooms.

Please do, very curious to see how they looked installed. :) mork Sep 21st, 2009, 10:08 AM I bought 450 sq. ft. of the Walnut yesterday. Hopefully I&apos;ll get around to installing it in the next couple of weeks. mork Sep 21st, 2009, 05:06 PM For those who have installed this, I see the instructions are recommending a 5/8&quot;gap around the perimeter. This seems pretty large. Later in the instructions it says to put on your baseboards and then add a quarter-round to hide the gap.

my baseboards are not wide enough at the base to hide anywhere near 5/8&quot;and I would rather not do the quarter-round.

how big of a gap did you guys leave? eliza Sep 23rd, 2009, 01:36 PM Online I am only able to find reference to 15mm laminate from the Madrid collection. Is this the same? Is it only available in stores? CSK&apos;sMom Sep 23rd, 2009, 01:42 PM For those who have installed this, I see the instructions are recommending a 5/8&quot;gap around the perimeter.

You really do need to leave a gap, preferably the full 5/8&quot;recommended. All laminates wil lexpand and contract with the weather. If the gap isn&apos;t left on all walls and installed properly around door frames (undercut the jambs) the laminate will buckle when it expands.

eliza, what&apos;s shown online is not the same as instore. loudsubz Sep 23rd, 2009, 01:57 PM I got some 14.3mm laminate from brampton hardwood. Was $1.85 sqft with the padding built into the planks. It looks like real hardwood and feels very solid. Just another alternative.

I kind of want to redo the basement floors with this stuff but both finishes seem a little dark for the basement. Comments?

If you could let me know what one box of the laminate from Costco weighs, as well as the dimensions, that would be awesome!

Thanks.:D Tiggs Sep 24th, 2009, 03:28 PM We bought 25 boxes of the Walnut to do our living room, family room and dining room on the main floor. Has anyone looked into the trim/transitions yet?

There is a phone number / e-mail address on the box but I&apos;m wondering if Home Depot/Rona/Lowes sells a product that matches. If you found one for the Walnut what brand was it and where did you fid it?

You can get the matching 3 piece transitions for both colors at HD. The 3 piece transition allows for several options like hard surface to laminate, tile to laminate, etc. deltone Sep 25th, 2009, 12:03 AM Anyone that bought the stuff from Costco could do me a favour?

We just bought 26 boxes on Monday. They weigh 75 pounds each. They are 4 feet long but I&apos;m not sure of the other measurements. We put all 26 boxes in the back of a Ford pickup truck and they filled up the truck bed. GOOD LUCK, these suckers are heavy. marciemp Sep 30th, 2009, 12:38 PM We are looking at buying this laminate for our basement playroom/family room. We need a nice looking and durable floor that can be wiped clean for our family of 3 (soon to be 4) kids who will ride bikes and ride on toys around, a 70 pound dog with bear claws and 2 cats. We installed hardwood in our living room in December and the family has pretty much destroyed it in less than a year :( Hoping the laminate will be better, I did scrape it with my keys at the store and it looked pretty good. The floor is awesome looking compared to the IKEA stuff we were considering as it is so ugly!

Does anyone know if it is still for sale or if it will be again? Would like to have it installed before the baby comes (december) and the more affordable the better. Also does anyone know if there are different colours available at the different Calgary Costco&apos;s?

Nope, no longer on sale and probably won&apos;t be in the near future. aplin Sep 30th, 2009, 04:49 PM We are looking at buying this laminate for our basement playroom/family room.

This is no longer on sale. We are in also Calgary and it took husband too long to decide on pulling the trigger on this deal because he fall in love with another one from timbertown but that one is at least 50 cents /sq ft more. I couldn&apos;t agree with him. We went at Sunday afternoon at 4:30 but there was no way for us to transport it home then (we have a civic) and they won&apos;t let us leave it there until Monday night. However one of the customer service person told us that the rebate is on quite often. I think last time I see it on rebate (which isn&apos;t as good as this one but still better then no rebate) was about 6 month ago. I would say wait until just before you want to do the project to purchase and hope for a rebate within 6 month so you can do price adjustment. That is what husband and I are planning, short of getting a good discount on the one from timbertown. We found the walnut too dark in our basement. We were looking at the oak one. Konowl Nov 3rd, 2009, 11:21 PM For the life of me I couldn&apos;t find a matching molding at HD. How close is the trim/transition you guys used to the Walnut flooring? CSK&apos;sMom Nov 4th, 2009, 12:11 AM Konowl, HD has them but you may need to really look or ask. Ask for the 3 piece transitions. We found them in the small bins under the laminate and engineered displays. They match perfectly. I&apos;ll post a pic once I get my computer back in the next day or 2. Vyseguy Nov 22nd, 2009, 09:30 AM I am in the process of installing the Golden Select Walnut laminate, and was able to find moldings that are pretty well an exact colour match at HD. The product is Simple Solutions Four-in-one moldings and the model number on the packaging for the colour that matches the walnut laminate is #36395M.

Cheers,

Jayson holysmokes Nov 26th, 2009, 10:04 AM Hi I was thinking of putting this down in my basement reno and didn&apos;t know if a vapour barrier would be needed between the laminate and the concrete floor? Layed laminate once before in a family members home and we used 6mm poly and the foam backing for his floors. Curious if the foam backing that is attached would be sufficient and if the vapour barrier is still necessary with this product.

Thanks, Vyseguy Nov 26th, 2009, 10:43 PM The instructions for the laminate explicitly say for on concrete floors to use at least 0.15mm (0.006&quot;) thick vapor barrier on the base.

+1. You have to have a sealed barrier. Very cheap in the big box stores. laika Dec 13th, 2009, 12:38 PM Hello,
I am considering putting this in my walkout basement which is used by messy kids and pets.
Has anyone had any experiences yet with water spills? Has anyone used it in a bathroom?
How washable is it?
Also, I have a scooba which I LOVE!!! Has anyone used a scooba on this stuff? I really want to find a flooring that is scooba proof! kobe Dec 14th, 2009, 06:48 AM Is there a maple colour?

This laminate is single plank, both in design and installation. Single plank means that each plank is narrower, looking more like a traditional hardwood board, unlike the HD stuff on sale which is 3 boards IIRC to a plank. This stuff is bevel edge on all 4 sides of the plank. It goes in piece by piece, the boards are also staggered lengths. Very easy to install with just one person, no matter the room size. By the way, I just got my winter coupon book and this laminate is sale again in March. The coupon is valid March 8-21st and is for $7 off per box. Again, both walnut and mountain oak finishes. densil_lopez Jan 1st, 2010, 02:18 PM This laminate is single plank, both in design and installation.

thanks for the answer. Survivor2008 Jan 2nd, 2010, 09:19 PM We just bought 12 boxes and will be doing 2 more trips to costco to pick up the rest. The boxes are heavier than they look. That will be our last step in finishing off the basement. Keep in mind you will need to put in a vapour barrier of some sort if you are pllaning to install it directly onto the basement floor. lakeman67 Jan 11th, 2010, 12:19 AM T I just got my winter coupon book and this laminate is sale again in March. The coupon is valid March 8-21st and is for $7 off per box. Again, both walnut and mountain oak finishes.

I was over at Costco today and saw the Golden Select brand. Is this the brand that will be on sale in March? I wish I remembered the colors. One was a dark chocolate brown. the other was closer to a cherry finish. It was going for about $1.74 sq./ft.

I&apos;m doing my basement in March and I will be laying down DeltaFL and if i buy this stuff at 14.33mm w/foam attached, I should be good. I&apos;m wondering if I even need any black roofing paper under the DeltaFL to stop any potential noise. At 14.33mm, I&apos;m guessing it won&apos;t float much, so less likely to make noise. CSK&apos;sMom Jan 11th, 2010, 01:18 AM Yes lakemen, it&apos;s the Golden Select that is on sale again in March. The dark brown in Walnut and the other they call Mountain Oak which is a little more red than the typical oak in most brands.

There is no typical laminate&quot;ting&quot;with this floor. It&apos;s made with an HDF core vs the MDF seen in cheap(er) laminate. The attached underlay also makes a huge difference as it&apos;s more rubber&apos;y than the cheap foam. pepper3245 Jan 11th, 2010, 01:29 AM for the golden select the box is printed with&quot;Certified E0.5&quot;, does anyone know if this is related to VOC? Emailed the manufacturer but reply yet. wcoastmom Jan 11th, 2010, 01:48 AM Wow - I&apos;m sold&amp;I haven&apos;t even seen the stuff yet! Just have to convince hubby to change the doors on the kitchen cabinets&amp;figure out how a no hassle way to stain the stairway banister&amp;railing. :eek:

Because we have an open floor plan, I&apos;d like to know what people think of having this flooring in the kitchen, powder room&amp;entry way. Is this flooring that good? Could it withstand the daily issues of a family with 3 boys&amp;a dog? marciemp Jan 11th, 2010, 02:11 AM With the coupon in March this floor works out to about $1.46 a sq foot! It is a very nice laminate floor and I think it would hold up to kids and a dog better than a real wood. We put real wood in our living room last Christmas and it is so damaged from the 3 kids and the big dog already. We went to various floor and home improvement stores to compare and you have to spend at least $2.50ish to $2.90ish plus an underlay to compare. I scratched it with my keys and it did really well (my laminate floor test!) I am interested in the indoor air quality and voc comment, will be checking back to see what was said. wcoastmom Jan 11th, 2010, 09:27 PM Went to Costco today&amp;saw the Golden Select - it&apos;s listed at $39.99/box. Looks great - as long as you want any of those 2 colours.

Also stopped in at Nucasa&amp;found 12.3 mm (no foam) laminate which looks pretty comparable - it&apos;s the V groove stuff (couldn&apos;t find a brand name). Rated AC3&amp;E1 for $1.59/square foot. Requires underlay. More colour options: golden teak, maple mocha, walnut&amp;mahogany. Not as cheap, but seems like a pretty good price. I checked on line - no info on their website about this flooring.

Seems to me that people prefer the single plank with the v groove because it looks more like the real thing? Doesn&apos;t a lot of crud get caught in btwn?

Can someone tell me what the AC3&amp;E1 ratings are?

Also, FYI - underlay at Nucasa is 49 cents/sq foot. At HD you can get the moisture barricade that&apos;s 120sq ft for $13.49. marciemp Jan 12th, 2010, 12:57 AM The AC rating is hardness of laminate. The higher the number the more durable it wil be. AC3 is considered heavy residential light commercial I think. AC 4 is commercial, and there is an AC 5 which is heavy commercial, probably like they use in stores. I haven&apos;t figured out the other numbers yet. wcoastmom Jan 12th, 2010, 01:13 AM does anyone know what the AC rating on the Golden Select is?

I believe the E rating has something to do with emissions - but I don&apos;t know what a good number is. marciemp Jan 12th, 2010, 01:18 AM I think the rating is AC 3 and E 0.5. I think you are right it does have to do with emmisions but I can&apos;t tell if it is better to be higher or lower. I am assuming lower number means lower emmisions. I was reading that most laminates are made with water based glues and varnishes so they are supposed to be pretty good as far as VOCs go. CSK&apos;sMom Jan 12th, 2010, 01:27 AM We&apos;ve been living with this floor for almost a year now with 3 teens, 2 dogs and a gravel driveway. It still doesn&apos;t have a mark on it. We&apos;ve lived with pre-finished hardwood before and will never go back. This floor replaced a cheap laminate (via previous homeowner) that I hated the color of and I don&apos;t regret it for a moment. The v-groove doesn&apos;t catch any more crud than any other flooring. I vacuum about every other day or the dog hair dust bunnies take over though.

In a residential setting you&apos;d really never want any laminate rated above AC3. AC4 and AC5 really are for commercial applications and are much rougher in texture. Definitely not anything you&apos;d want to walk on in bare feet or even just socks. The E1 rating does have to do with VOC. The max emission allowed to receive the E1 rating is 0.1ppm. Laminate is considered virtually emission free usually testing at 0.005ppm and 0.03ppm for formaldehyde per most manufacturers. Because of this it would be considered really odd and a red flag if a laminate was not E1 rated. marciemp Jan 12th, 2010, 01:30 AM As far as I can tell the E1 rating is a standard on formaldehyde emissions. This is from the flooroption.com website about pergo laminate: The limit for E1 which is a german standard for wood based boards is 0.13 mg per cubic meter. For your info the pergo flooring is 0.05, so I am assuming that the floors we have talked about on this site are maybe 0.05 and 0.1 but I am just assuming this. I wouldn&apos;t think they would be higher but European countries are a lot stricter about emissions and fire retardants etc, so maybe they are 0.5 and 1?! Still researching this. marciemp Jan 12th, 2010, 01:32 AM Thanks csk&apos;s mom that was the exact info I was looking for you saved me much annoying internet searching!

I did find one very interesting read on the emission standards http://blogs.findanyfloor.com/green/HealthIssues/E1andE0FormaldehydeEmissionStandardsforGreenAdhesi ves.xhtml lakeman67 Jan 12th, 2010, 11:35 AM I think the rating is AC 3 and E 0.5.

Hi, marcieemp. did you say E0.5 or E0.05 emissions? deep Jan 12th, 2010, 11:41 AM I installed this in my basement playroom, and it was a great install, very good looking product.

Sadly, it has received its first mark, as I dropped a hammer on it while putting together a bookshelf. Claws down, small mark.

I would highly recommend it, at the coupon rate. marciemp Jan 12th, 2010, 12:48 PM Pepper3245 said in a previous post it says on the box Certified E0.5 so I am not sure exactly what that means, but it is better to be certified E0 than E1 (check out my link in my last post) so it sounds like a pretty good floor toxin wise for those who worry about that (like me) wcoastmom Jan 12th, 2010, 03:51 PM So what is the price adjustment policy/time period for Costco? We&apos;d like to put a new floor in sooner, rather than wait 6 weeks for the coupon to kick in. oxford99 Jan 13th, 2010, 01:42 AM So what is the price adjustment policy/time period for Costco? We&apos;d like to put a new floor in sooner, rather than wait 6 weeks for the coupon to kick in.

I would also like to know. If I buy this stuff before the end of the month, it can go towards the HRTC that ends Jan 31. mork Jan 13th, 2010, 01:41 PM I&apos;ve never had problems with price adjustments at Costco.. even quite a while after the fact (months later on a major item). No hassles - maybe call and ask the policy?

I am hoping to get to work on the basement this week and finish off the floors, so I should be able to provide some additional comment on installation and final look. lakeman67 Jan 13th, 2010, 06:33 PM I just called and asked them...they say it&apos;s a 30 day policy, but it&apos;s up to the individual store manager. So, I would guess 50/50 shot at getting the rebate. Maybe I should buy half my flooring before end of January....to benefit from the HRTC and then buy the rest in March. That way I can show the manager how I bought twice and got ripped off in January.

One question though....I heard the deadline for HRTC could go til Feb.15th. I couldn&apos;t find anything online. Does anyone know if there&apos;s any truth to this? pepper3245 Jan 14th, 2010, 04:04 AM Costco (Brighton) told me they have a 45 day price protection, so ymmv. Sunmax Jan 19th, 2010, 01:16 PM Quick question, is the attached padding at the back enough for noise insulation? It looks so thin. I am planning to install it on second floor of a house. napoleon1769 Jan 19th, 2010, 03:22 PM What is the rebate and when does it end? napoleon1769 Jan 19th, 2010, 03:23 PM Is this a complete kit? Like what tools do I need besides the ones that come in the box? Do I need any&quot;padding&quot;to put underneath? BushCaddy Jan 19th, 2010, 05:46 PM I&apos;m half way through installing this laminate in my house, and thought I would add my experiences for everyone.

As a reference, this is the third type of laminate I have installed in a house.

First of all the good:

1. VERY easy install, as the short ends don&apos;t actually&quot;click&quot;into each other, you simply insert the tongue on the long side, and let the piece&quot;drop&quot;onto the last one.

2. Looks very nice with the bevelled edges and different plank lengths.

Now the not so good:

1. Inconsistent quality control. There can be large differences between boxes in terms of color and shine. I realize it&apos;s nice to have a variety of shades, but a lot of the pieces have an almost grey color to them, almost like the protective layer is cloudy.

2. Many of the pieces have chips or damage, I factored in 10% extra for waste, but I&apos;ll need to go back for more boxes. If I was being pickier, I could probably throw out 20% of the pieces.

3. The boards are somewhat weak. The tongues will snap if you press down too hard during install, you need to&quot;wiggle&quot;them into place carefully.

4. The matching trim pieces from the company are not very good. I thought I would spend the extra money and get the official ones from the company to make for a more professional looking job, but they looked cheap to me, and the stair nosing weren&apos;t even designed for laminate that is this thick. To the companies credit though, they had the pieces picked up. (although I am still waiting for the refund). I found some nice wood transition pieces at Rona for less money that are a nice match.

5. The top layer scratches fairly easily. As I mentioned, I am only half way through the install and I already have several pieces that are scratched or chipped.

In summary, I would say for the price on coupon that this laminate is adequate, although if I were to do it again, I would buy a higher quality laminate. I&apos;m kind of surprised that everyone else on the forum is so happy with the laminate, maybe I&apos;m just being too picky. lakeman67 Jan 20th, 2010, 09:30 PM thx for the feedback BUSHCADDY. It was beginning to look too good to be true.

Did you buy the lighter or darker laminate?

and if you don&apos;t mind me asking, did you find the stair nosing at Rona too, or just the transitions?

what kind of sub-floor did you have?

what was it that scratched the surfaces easily?

sorry for all the questions, but I&apos;ve got to decide to whether or not to bite the bullet soon. BushCaddy Jan 21st, 2010, 10:33 AM thx for the feedback BUSHCADDY. It was beginning to look too good to be true.

sorry for all the questions, but I&apos;ve got to decide to whether or not to bite the bullet soon.

I went with the lighter color, went better with my current decor.

Rona had all the different transition strips. The color that matched best was Cherry I believe. They&apos;ve got it in 3 different thicknesses, I went with the thickest one, but I think the middle size would have worked too. I&apos;m only using the stair nosing on the part where the floor meets the top of the stairs. For the actual staircase I decided to buy the wood veneer treads from Rona, that way I don&apos;t have a lip on every single stair. By the time you factor in the price of the nosing for each stair, it&apos;s not much more expensive to do it this way.

I&apos;m installing this on my main floor, so my subfloor is 5/8&quot;chipboard. My problem is that the floor is REALLY unlevel, and I find this laminate is not tolerant of of this at all (others I&apos;ve used could handle some imperfections, not this stuff). If your subfloor is pretty level it shouldn&apos;t be a problem.

I&apos;m not sure what&apos;s causing the scratches. It just seems everytime I turn around there&apos;s another one. It&apos;s possible they were there straight out of the box and I didn&apos;t notice them. A brown Sharpie is a pretty good match!

Don&apos;t get me wrong, you can&apos;t beat the price when this is on coupon. Just don&apos;t think you a getting a top of the line laminate though. As I said, for the amount of work it&apos;s taking to install this (i&apos;m doing 800 sqft), I should have bought better laminate, that way I won&apos;t have to do this all again in a couple of years.

If you have any other questions, let me know. lakeman67 Jan 21st, 2010, 12:11 PM I went with the lighter color, went better with my current decor.

For the actual staircase I decided to buy the wood veneer treads from Rona, that way I don&apos;t have a lip on every single stair. By the time you factor in the price of the nosing for each stair, it&apos;s not much more expensive to do it this way.

I&apos;m installing this on my main floor, so my subfloor is 5/8&quot;chipboard. My problem is that the floor is REALLY unlevel, and I find this laminate is not tolerant of of this at all (others I&apos;ve used could handle some imperfections, not this stuff). If your subfloor is pretty level it shouldn&apos;t be a problem.

I&apos;m not sure what&apos;s causing the scratches. It just seems everytime I turn around there&apos;s another one. It&apos;s possible they were there straight out of the box and I didn&apos;t notice them. A brown Sharpie is a pretty good match!

Don&apos;t get me wrong, you can&apos;t beat the price when this is on coupon. Just don&apos;t think you a getting a top of the line laminate though. As I said, for the amount of work it&apos;s taking to install this (i&apos;m doing 800 sqft), I should have bought better laminate, that way I won&apos;t have to do this all again in a couple of years.

If you have any other questions, let me know.

hey BUSHCADDY,

I&apos;m gonna do about 850 sqft. in my basement which&quot;looks&quot;pretty level. I TOO am going with the cherry(mountain oak), but I&apos;m having second thoughts now, especially after you mention re-doing it all again in a couple of years. Is it really THAT bad? Would you be re-doing it because of all the scratches? I would really appreciate it if you could post some pix.


I like your idea for the stairs. Did the veneer treads match the cherry?


It would also be great if all the GOLDEN SELECT lovers could give us an update re: scratches, discoloring, chips, etc... All of a sudden GOLDEN is looking pretty BRASSY.


thanks for the prompt responses CSK&apos;sMom Jan 21st, 2010, 12:27 PM Ours has been in for almost a year now. We have 3 kids, 2 crazy dogs, a pool and a gravel driveway. Not a single scratch or other issue. Ours is through our mainfloor... livingroom, dining room and hallway. I move furniture a couple of times a week as well and it all has just the factory installed&quot;buttons&quot;on the legs. The previous owner installed cheap laminate and this stuff is far superior, no question. The rubber pad and HDF core handles noise far better and there is no&quot;ting&quot;of cheap laminate.

Hubby has installed pretty much every make of laminate out there, in all price ranges over the years (installer for 25+years) and he really enjoyed putting this in. ot a single one of his contacts could come close to the price of this floor for the same quality, even with his cost + 5% discounts. I think BushCaddy&apos;s problems are all to do with the unlevelness of his sub. Because of the thickness of this floor it&apos;s not going to give at all over the dips and peaks. Any laminate (or hardwood for that matter) will have issues depending on how bad the issue is... I&apos;ll try to get some pics up later today for you Lakeman. lakeman67 Jan 21st, 2010, 12:57 PM Ours has been in for almost a year now. We have 3 kids, 2 crazy dogs, a pool and a gravel driveway.

thanks for your feedback CSK&apos;sMom. It now sounds like 2 different laminates. BUSHCADDY&apos;s scratches...yours doesn&apos;t. Did you buy the mountain oak finish or the dark brown? Pictures would be excellent.

Like I said earlier...I really have to make the RIGHT decision soon. We&apos;re talking about 850 sq.ft. and this is the first time I install the stuff. Lots of how-to videos on laminate and subfloor installation online. Sunmax Jan 21st, 2010, 03:46 PM I went to Costco last night and check out the laminate floor again, with some sample from my contractor for comparisons. I like the Golder Select one. I even use my keys to scratch the Golden Select sample and nothing, not even a single scratch.

I googled Golden Select and didn&apos;t find any more information regarding this product. On Builddirect&apos;s website, they list the product with information like edge swelling rating (http://www.builddirect.com/Laminate-Flooring/toklo_14mm_flooring-Meranti/ProductDisplay_6951_P1_10068425.aspx) on some products. I emailed them and haven&apos;t heard a reply yet. samab Jan 21st, 2010, 04:51 PM As the OP stated, a company in Montreal (jsonic.ca) imports these flooring from China under its own name. If you live near Montreal, you can go and take a look at their stuff directly.

You can also buy the flooring directly from them and have it delivered --- but you have to pay for the delivery (you have to call them) and you lose the costco refund convenience. BushCaddy Jan 21st, 2010, 04:58 PM hey BUSHCADDY,

Hey Lakeman, I don&apos;t mean to scare you off, I seem to be the only one with any issues with the flooring.

As for replacing this in a couple of years, that&apos;s only a guess based on how easy it seems to be scratching. In comparison to the other review that said they couldn&apos;t scratch it with their keys, mine will scratch with even a light swipe. It&apos;s possible I got a bad batch, as there also seems to be a lot of imperfections right out of the box. I&apos;ll see if I can get a chance to post some pics, but I don&apos;t think they will do the scratches justice.

As for the stairs, the veneer I bought is unfinished, so I&apos;ll have to stain and clear coat it myself. The main reason I went this way is that I have an&quot;open&quot;staircase, and to try and get all the mitres on the nosing perfect would be pretty tough. If I had a closed staircase, I probably would just have gone with the laminate and nosing, although then you end up with the lip on each step.

The transition strips I got are made by Quickstyle and are designed for floors that are 13-16mm thick, and I believe were called Cherry color. I haven&apos;t installed the transitions yet, so not sure if they are going to be the right thickness, but the color match is just about perfect.

You could always buy the laminate and then if you don&apos;t like it, just take it back to Costco, although that will be a large pain in the ... virgoan Jan 21st, 2010, 06:03 PM We installed the mountain oak colour a few months ago...we absolutely LOVE it...it&apos;s high quality stuff! no scratch so far...

We use 1&quot;Rigid Insulation + 5/8&quot;plywood as subfloor...turns out great! very warm.

Wow, you must have fingernail like Wolverine. :D I used my keys to scratch and couldn&apos;t even create a mark.

Kidding aside, are you sure you was looking at the laminate floor? Costco also has the hardwood floor, which most likely will be right next to the laminate ones.

too funny.:lol:

I haven&apos;t done the scratch test yet jtkv Jan 26th, 2010, 10:36 AM Rona currently has a 7mm laminate for sale at 0.84c sq.ft.
I actually like the feel of this smooth top laminate, as I do not like the ones with the fake grain. Lowe&apos;s also has similar 7mm smooth top laminates for 0.99c sq.ft.

So how is a 10mm or 12mm laminate better than a 7mm laminate?
As the price will double for the thicker laminates, I am wondering if this is decent for the basement, where I plan to lay down rigid foam and OSB sub-flooring.


regards,
jtkv NiagaraFallsCDC Jan 26th, 2010, 01:39 PM first off, thank you all for your comments about the golden select laminate flooring, it has all been very helpful! Last night we purchased a box of each as we&apos;re having troubles which colour to choose, originally I thought I would prefer the darker walnut, however after seeing the photos of the other, I had to compare a larger sample. All this to say, we have a friend who laid the same product a number of years ago and he has a son who (it seems) is hell bent on destroying the floor, however he has been unable to. My question for you now is this: before finding this product we were planning on laying the 3 in 1 underlayment found at HD and Rona, however I&apos;m wondering now if it will be too&quot;squishy&quot;or if it&apos;s ok?

Thanks NiagaraFallsCDC Jan 26th, 2010, 02:00 PM Hi CSK...I suppose I should have said, i&apos;m looking to install it in the basement which for the most part I don&apos;t find overly cold as it is CSK&apos;sMom Jan 26th, 2010, 02:00 PM This has a good quality rubber based underlay attached. There is no need to use any other underlay for an above grade install. newfieinthefalls Jan 26th, 2010, 02:31 PM Hi, I&apos;ve been watching this thread for a while and am trying to convince my better half (haha) to go take a look at this stuff. Called St. Catharines Costco to see if they would do a price adjust in March if we purchased end of Jan to take advantage of both the Home Reno credit and the coupon, but the store told me it was 30 days firm. Oh well...maybe I&apos;m too greedy. Has anyone else heard differently in the GTA? rossnick Jan 26th, 2010, 04:12 PM I just bought 32 boxes of the walnut finish from my local Costco. Boy those suckers are heavy.

I now have a neat pile in my basement. I can&apos;t wait to install it. I just want to do the plastering and painting first. Sunmax Jan 26th, 2010, 04:54 PM This has a good quality rubber based underlay attached. There is no need to use any other underlay for an above grade install.

Read the intsructions in the box. It has the specs for exactly what you need to put down for below grade installs.

Well I can tell you our 20 yr old lives in our basement. Our dogs used to drive him nuts on the old laminate and he says there is a huge difference with this laminate. For the most part he can no longer hear the dogs walking, or should I say running around. Now I&apos;ll say from my perspective I don&apos;t hear our son as much now either, his music or surround sound, etc. Sunmax Jan 27th, 2010, 03:04 AM Well I can tell you our 20 yr old lives in our basement.

Wow! That&apos;s great! Thanks for the info.

Another question, today I talked to an installer and he said with the attached foam backer, it can&apos;t be install on the stairs. Is that true? He said stairs normally don&apos;t use underlay. jjasond Jan 27th, 2010, 07:33 AM My question for you now is this: before finding this product we were planning on laying the 3 in 1 underlayment found at HD and Rona, however I&apos;m wondering now if it will be too&quot;squishy&quot;or if it&apos;s ok?


I recently installed the Costco laminate in my basement. I used an additional underlay to provide a vapour barrier and am happy with the feel of the floor. It has a comfortable spring but is not&quot;sqishy&quot;. If you are installing on a wood subfloor, I would not bother using underlay though. Sunmax Jan 27th, 2010, 06:36 PM Just FYI, I finally able to contact J-Sonic customer service and get more information. Their laminate floor foam backer has a 58 for the IIC rating and 53 for STC, which I think is pretty good. deep Jan 27th, 2010, 07:48 PM I&apos;m just going to stick in another quick query re: stair nosings for this product....anyone seen them? How much?

Thanks! NiagaraFallsCDC Jan 28th, 2010, 10:41 AM this is the image that j.sonic sent me when I asked about mouldings&amp;trim...ok someone is going to have to tell me how to insert a picture from my desktop!! Lothar Zogg Jan 31st, 2010, 12:23 AM I&apos;m looking for some darker laminate for my basement and reading the posts on here, this sounded like a good option. I picked up a small piece from an open box at Costco and brought it home to check the colour. It wasn&apos;t bad -- not really ideal but decent for the price. I also had some other laminates, in the $2-$4 range (including brands like Armstrong, Bruce, Wilsonart, and some other cheaper&quot;store brands&quot;).

I have 2 kids under 4, so I was really interested to see how well these would hold up to kid abuse. I got the idea for the soup can test from the Wilsonart laminate marketing. Their top layer is supposed to be the strongest of all the laminates, and they advertise that you can drop a 14oz soup can from counter-height with 0 damage.

I tried the test with a small (10 oz) soup can. The Costco stuff showed significant marks from dropping it from a height of only 12&quot;. None of the other stuff had and marks at this height. At 24&quot;, there were big gauges left on the Costco stuff, 1-2&quot;long. Basically, it looks like the paper gets ripped right through. For the other stuff, the cheapest of it ($2/sf) had some very small marks on the top finish, but not right through the paper, and the better stuff, still no damage. And yes, the Wilsonart stuff took a full hit from 36&quot;without any damage.

This gave me enough information to tell me that if I want the floor to look good in a couple of years, I should spend a bit more to get something more durable. Sure, the better stuff is double the price, but I&apos;ve already spent $10K to finish the basement, I don&apos;t mind an extra $1k to have a floor that maintain its appearance. And of course, by spending a bit more, there is a much more choice in colour/style, so I can pick something we really love, rather than one of two options.

Although, I didn&apos;t have the kids who are going to abuse the floor, this might be an option. Aside from the lack of durability, it&apos;s not bad for the price. I&apos;m not trying to scare any one off, but if you do need the durability, this might not be the laminate for you. maddmike Feb 5th, 2010, 12:45 PM Hiya, Ive been looking at this stuff as well...would be a great addition to the house and walnut color would work perfectly.

1) How moisture resistant is it? ( My basement has an ongoing problem in a couple of corners during spring thaw )

2) Has anyone used a scooba on it?

3) I would be interested in knowing how well the floor is holding up. How long have you had your floor.

4) Any ideas how much it would cost to get it installed? ( 905 west of GTA )

Thanks so much!

laika oldpaint Feb 18th, 2010, 04:45 PM I am doing some renos in the basement and am planning on buying this Costco Golden Select laminate when it goes on sale in March. Something that bothers me though is much talk here regarding Basement applications and either:
- Buying expensive underlays such as Delta FL.
- Or, even more expensive and time consuming subfloor construction

Knock on wood -- but I have not had any unusual moisture problems in the basement. The installation guideline calls for a minimum 6 mil poly. This is a lot less expensive option than the two above.

To get such a great deal on this product (~$1.50/ft2) and then go spend another 75+ cents/sq foot for underlayment drives the price up to $2.25/sq ft (possibly more!). Seems to start defeating what is otherwise a great bargain. The product already has a 2mm underlayment -- isnt this enough?

If I could visualize the value of adding extra underlayment -- I might go ahead and do so. But I also worry about getting a spongy feel from all the padding. On the flip side I also worry that a 6 mil poly (as minimum recomended) could cause the 2mm padding included on this product to sweat as it is unable to breath. I can see where a subfloor might be ideal -- but I have a bit of an issue with the cost, time involved and also some height considerations.

Ok, my 2 cents for what it&apos;s worth.... Yep there is tons of talk here about subfloors in basements. Personally I think they are an added expense with very little in the way of returns. They will also cut down on your headroom. We&apos;ve never done a subfloor in any of our finished basements. With the heating done right (registers routed down to the floor instead of in the ceilings) they aren&apos;t cold either. Our current basment is carpeted and kids lay on the floor all the time down there.

The poly the manufacturer recommends is because the concrete can hold moisture. Laminates and moisture don&apos;t mix well. The 2mm attached pad is rubber based and there won&apos;t be any sweating between it and the poly. The poly is to prevent any moisture from getting to the attached pad and ultimately the laminate. The poly just needs to get rolled out and tuck-taped at the seams, it is nothing more than a sheet of plastic. There is no way it could make the floor any&quot;more&quot;spongy, which this floor isn&apos;t BTW... oldpaint Feb 18th, 2010, 06:18 PM The poly the manufacturer recommends is because the concrete can hold moisture.

Thanks for your comments CSK. I am not worried about the floor being spongy going with the manufacturers recomendation of a 6 mil poly. What I was referring to was a possible spongy effect if going with a higher quality underlay that adds extra padding (such as Delta FL, or equivalent). Some here have suggested this is how they intend to install it. What would be the purpose?

- Extra Warmth? I tend to agree with CSK on this -- extra padding probably wont help as much as a pair of slippers, room temperature, positioning of heat vents, etc.
- Extra Comfort? Perhaps there is no spongy feel. Perhaps the added padding offsets the concrete being harder than a plywood surface.
- Better moisture control? Perhaps Delta FL or other products have better moisture barriers than a 6 mil poly -- or the added padding is extra measure for any kind of sweating working its way up. We have had carpet down there for a very long time and there have been no moisture problems.
- Better levelling? A basement floor is likely to be less level than a main floor or subfloor. Perhaps a higher quality underlayment helps with this. I have a couple spots where I need to do some self leveling -- other than that I think I am within the manufacturers even-ness tolerances.
- Noise? I cannot see this being an issue from what others have stated here and what I have observed from buying a box and testing it.

Perhaps it is an &apos;all of the above thing&apos;? --- just curious why anyone would want to go with higher grade underlayment -- and/or other opinions like CSK&apos;s that it might be over-kill!

If all I need is the 6 mil poly then I am a pretty happy camper --- but then again, I want to do this right the first time. With a 25 year warranty, one would think you could expect at least 10 years out of this product. If it is necessary to do something a little extra to get this kind of life expectancy -- I am willing to go for it -- but dont want to waste any money either. laika Feb 18th, 2010, 11:22 PM I think I have similar concerns regarding choosing the best underlay.
Has anyone used the Deltafloor with this?

Absolutely. Think about it logically. Heat rises. If the registers are left in the ceiling the heat that comes out of them will be at ceiling height vs down at the floor. If the room is warm at the level that people are it will be much more comfortable feeling all around KWIM? barsuk666 Feb 20th, 2010, 10:53 AM laika
As others mentioned no laminate is moisture resistant, as to the cost we had couple of quotes and all were $2/ft2 scomintay Feb 22nd, 2010, 12:18 PM Hello everyone....New member here...

I&apos;m from Indiana in the US and I&apos;ve appreciated everyone&apos;s thoughts/experiences on the golden select flooring. I just bought 1500 sq.ft. of the walnut for my basement last week...plan to install starting this weekend. I&apos;m a fairly experienced DIY&apos;er and have installed other laminates such as Pergo.

Some have asked about or mentioned DeltaFL. I purchased 5 rolls of DeltaFL from Lowe&apos;s for about $850 total...yes it is expensive. I did alot of research on it prior to buying because I wanted an extra precaution against the chance of standing water/moisture wicking coming up from the slab. DeltaFL provides&quot;extra protection&quot;and warmth from the concrete slab. I say&quot;extra&quot;because we had some minor flooding from the slab (water underneath) due to excessive rains that season and a higher than normal water table. The main protection we implemented was the installation of a complete interior drain system under the slab to reroute ground water. That combined with the DeltaFL should provide some pretty solid protection in case there is wicking or slab moisture from underneath due to excessive rains/snow melts. In the event we get a little standing water it is automatically routed under the DeltaFL to the sumps and pumped out.

I will say that if you&apos;re a homeowner that doesn&apos;t have historic water/moisture issues DeltaFL may be entirely unnecessary. 6mil plastic would probably do the trick. But for a $20K basement buildout, we figured the extra $850 in our situation was well worth it.

We&apos;re excited about getting the floor down and I&apos;ll be sure report back with progress and completion notes.

Scomintay mikalh78 Feb 23rd, 2010, 10:46 AM I keep on hearing mixed reviews for this flooring and its making me have a hard time deciding if I should buy this flooring or not. I&apos;m looking to get the Bamboo style flooring that will go over existing wood flooring that is level but has seen better days. Should I wait until March to pick this up from Costco? I may stop by there tonight and see if they have it in my area and do the scratch test. scomintay Feb 23rd, 2010, 11:35 AM I keep on hearing mixed reviews for this flooring and its making me have a hard time deciding if I should buy this flooring or not.

I may stop by there tonight and see if they have it in my area and do the scratch test.

Just an fyi...I took a key pretty aggresively to a couple of the walnut boards in one of the boxes I bought. The scratches that did show were very subtle and couldn&apos;t be seen unless you got down with your face close the boards in the right light. From above or any normal&quot;real life&quot;angle, you couldn&apos;t see a thing. My wife and I thought about it and determined that if any guest in our home goes to that extent to evaluate our flooring, they will be shown the door with my size 12. I also took a blade screw driver and dropped it from 3-4 feet high. It also left a very small gouge that penetrated the top layer. Again, hardly noticeable unless you were looking for it. My point is, I don&apos;t know of any laminate that can completely withstand aggressive impact with sharp objects without blemish, but this flooring held up quite well in our opinion. I have a very good laminate flooring from Mohawk in our first floor that took a hit from the edge of a VCR awhile back and it left a gouge about 1/16 inch deep. That was 4 months ago...we don&apos;t even notice it anymore and we don&apos;t plan to make a habit of dropping objects on the floor from 4 ft high. No laminate or any floor material for that matter is indestructable. For the price, so far I believe this floor is as quality a floor as any of the $3-4 per sq ft floors about there. I&apos;ve done the same tests on samples from those floors and they also scratch. But again, I have yet to install mine and use mine. I&apos;ll note progress as it happens.

Hope this helps.

I use a microfibre pad mop (similar to a swiffer but with a reusable, washable microfibre pad) and have no streaks at all. Be prepared though if you&apos;ve never lived with a dark floor.... It shows all the dust, dog hair, etc like crazy. It&apos;s a tradeoff though if one loves the look of dark floors. laika Mar 6th, 2010, 06:35 PM I have decided to get the costco laminate-

I just helped my parents buy a load in an old 97 F1-150 half-ton truck. Had costco use a forklift to load a full pallet (36 boxes) in to the back and the truck really dropped, but it was fine (although I wouldn&apos;t have wanted to do many more). In your Freestar, I would probably go considerably less than 36 boxes. Weight is the constraint moreso than space. With rear seats removed, you&apos;ll have no problems fitting a lot of boxes.. 20 should be plenty safe (at a complete guess). runmama Mar 7th, 2010, 01:46 AM I am helping my parents with some minor renos and we&apos;re on a really tight budget. I would love to get the Golden Select laminate for their entry-way, kitchen, and dining room (open-concept). I have two concerns:

1) They currently have old lino in these areas that will be very difficult to remove. Can I just put the laminate over the old lino?
2) Their house is built on a cement slab that is somewhat uneven. It appears even and furniture doesn&apos;t teeter on it, but my mom assures me it isn&apos;t even. She worries that over time the laminate joints will break because the floor isn&apos;t even enough. I read in a few posts that people have put this product down on uneven floors without problems but I am wondering if over time anyone has had any problems.

Any advice would be appreciated. I&apos;m really trying to convince my mom to go with laminate rather than lino again! It costs way less and looks WAY better.

You can install right over the lino, not an issue at all. This floor, like all laminates will tolerate a certain amount of unlevelness. If you can&apos;t see it and furniture appears level it shouldn&apos;t be an issue. I would caution though that you say it&apos;s built on a cement slab, make sure you follow the installation instructions fully.

You just think it&apos;s dense, even indoor/outdoor turf has give to it. Carpet will always have a certain amount of&quot;give&quot;and the laminate will in all likelyhood pop apart at the joints due to this. Carpet would also restrict the ability to float properly and expand and contract. Read the instructions on any box of laminate or click type flooring, over carpet is a no-no. For the 30 minutes it would take to rip out the carpet it&apos;s a small investment to ensure a good install that will last over time... runmama Mar 7th, 2010, 06:26 PM You can install right over the lino, not an issue at all.

It&apos;s definitely a good idea to put the poly down, even above grade. The cement can release moisture which is the death of laminate. For the minimal cost of the poly and tuck tape and time to do it it&apos;s a good insurance policy to have in place KWIM? The vinyl is probably paper backed so it has absolutely no vapour barrier qualities. runmama Mar 7th, 2010, 07:29 PM It&apos;s definitely a good idea to put the poly down, even above grade.

If the room is cold and over a garage nothing you put down on the floor is going to help. It needs to be addressed properly, as in checking the insulation and vapor barrier in the garage ceiling. This is a known issue in new builds with rooms over garages. Builders rarely insulate and vapor barrier the area properly which is what causes this room to be cold. scomintay Mar 8th, 2010, 10:40 AM Just an fyi...I took a key pretty aggresively to a couple of the walnut boards in one of the boxes I bought.

As promised a note on installation progress. I just started laying the first few rows of the walnut golden select. So far so good. I put down Delta FL first which also went down extremely easily. As for the flooring, the first row is always trickly because it wants to slide around since it doesn&apos;t really got&quot;locked in&quot;until the next row goes on...but after 4 rows it it going down without any snags and looks great so far...and my wife loves it, which ultimately is all that matters :cheesygri

I was about to get the Delta MS, but decided to contact Delta first. The rep said that while MS and FL are structurally similar, FL is made from new material, while MS is made of recycled material and could possibly have a bad smell?

Has anyone any experience with the MS? I am still considering it as it is about 1/2 the proce of the FL. Fr0sty Mar 9th, 2010, 11:53 PM OK, so I got 18 boxes and going back to get another 6 tommorrow, been trying to read all the posts but cant find the exact answer Im looking for.

I have 2 friends who recently installed this flooring in their basements;

1) he installed the flooring directly on the concrete, no subfloor or anything at all.

2) he installed a vapor barrier (plastic) and then some &apos;concrete board&apos; looking sheets over the vapor barrier, then laid the flooring directly over.

I am not comfortable going with option #1, and #2 was what I was considering doing - but now after some reading I&apos;m interested in this DeltaFl subfloor.

I&apos;ve read that some people put a vapor barrier below the DeltaFL, and some people lay sheets of plywood over the DeltaFL

Is it possible to simply lay the DeltaFL directly on the concrete and the flooring directly on the DeltaFL? laika Mar 10th, 2010, 07:11 AM There are more comments about Delta here

One recommendation is that floors laid with Delta tend to make a clicking sound when walked on and that this problem can be addressed by laying landscape fabric directly on the concrete, and then putting the Delta on that.

Laying that landscape fabric directly on the concrete would seem to be defeating the purpose. Seems to me that the landscape fabric is going to absorb moisture and hence a mold trap. Mike Holmes recommends that not even lumber should come in contact with the concrete.... but then again he has deep pockets and recommends against laminate all together.

Hearing about this clicking noise with the Delta pretty much makes my mind up to put it directly down on top of the poly per manufactures recomendations. Going to seal up the poly around the edges with some acuostiseal. How do you folks cut this stuff? Are fine tooth blades in the mitre saw and table saw important (I still have the original blades in mine)? slouie Mar 11th, 2010, 04:32 PM I just got my money back from Costco for the sale price on my mountain oak i bought in January to take advantage of the HRTC-woot.

2. Those who have used DeltaFL as the subfloor, did you also install OSB over top? If not, did you get the clicking sound people have talked about? laika Mar 13th, 2010, 10:51 AM 2. Those who have used DeltaFL as the subfloor, did you also install OSB over top? If not, did you get the clicking sound people have talked about?

Before you buy DeltaFl, check out Platon at Home Depot. It is considerably cheaper.

From what I read somewhere else the clicking sound is from the underlay (delta/platon) tapping on the concrete and can be minimized by laying landscape fabric directly on the concrete first.

Laika bail42 Mar 13th, 2010, 05:01 PM Picked up 12 boxes today in my Mazda 3 at Costco -Dartmouth Crossing. Going back for 10 more boxes tomorrow. There were TONS left, and extra stock still up on pallets. gyunei Mar 13th, 2010, 09:50 PM Picked up 15 boxes of Mountain Oak today in Gatineau. No shortage of either colour in the Ottawa area (~800 boxes per store). They look very nice, and the price is excellent. Dimensions are approx 4&apos;x10.5&quot;x 6&quot;, something like 30lbs per box. I&apos;ve been waiting for this sale for a few months now; can&apos;t wait to see it installed. Rainy weekend, might as well get started tomorrow. jonathanq Mar 14th, 2010, 11:51 AM 1. Has anyone installed this in a bathroom? How does it stand up to water?

I am by no means an expert - however we installed this floor in our bedroom (the walnut) and love it. We also have a cheap laminate in our kitchen and have noticed bubbled sections as well.

When we do the rest of our home renovation - we are replacing all of the laminate in the kitchen with the DuPont laminate that looks like tile (Tuscan Stone Bronze Flooring (http://www.homedepot.ca/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CatalogSearchResultView?D=976915&amp;Ntt=976915&amp;catalogId=10051&amp;langId=-15&amp;storeId=10051&amp;Dx=mode+matchallpartial&amp;Ntx=mode+matchall&amp;recN=112448%204294964797&amp;N=0&amp;Ntk=P_PartNumber) from Home Depot). It is very moisture resistant. Laminate isn&apos;t. I don&apos;t think any wood-like laminate is (regardless of quality). I would suggest you don&apos;t go with laminate in the bathroom.

For our ensuite - we purchased this tile (Eliane 6x23 Forest Ebano Glazed Porcelain Tile (http://www.homedepot.ca/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CatalogSearchResultView?D=903783&amp;Ntt=903783&amp;catalogId=10051&amp;langId=-15&amp;storeId=10051&amp;Dx=mode+matchallpartial&amp;Ntx=mode+matchall&amp;recN=112462%204294966653&amp;N=0&amp;Ntk=P_PartNumber) from Home Depot) which looks like small hardwood boards when laid. It&apos;s similar to our Costco laminate and looks good transitioning from the closet to the bathroom.

I attached a picture of our bathroom floor with the tile - and yes the purple wall has already been re-painted, just don&apos;t have an updated picture handy.

&lt;edit&gt;I also added a picture of the Costco Golden Select laminate we installed (it hasn&apos;t been vacuumed yet, this was right after we finished installing it).

I just finished removing the old carpet.

Could someone clarify is delta ms is for me or is the foam backing enough?

Im planning to install this on plywood and not concrete....

Any info would be greatly appreciated. :) Enermac Mar 15th, 2010, 12:13 AM Schwinn

I would suggest a layer of tar paper even on the wood subfloor just staple it down. Tarpaper is a vapor retarder and will stop any moisture from comming up. Also now is the time to re-screw your wood floors down if you can. shwinn Mar 15th, 2010, 12:51 AM Thanks for the quick reply.

Im not planning a big renovation. My main goal was just to replace the old carpet. This Costco sale on the Golden select flooring was perfect timing.

I was just a bit concerned about the possibility of cold floor from the switch from carpet to flooring. So was thinking about adding some extra insulation. After reading all the threads about people using delta, i thought maybe i should also.

So instead of using delta ms, I could use some tar paper on the plywood and start installing flooring? scomintay Mar 15th, 2010, 10:19 AM Just an another update. So far I&apos;ve stalled 14 boxes of the walnut in my basement over DeltaFL, then 3/4 OSB T&amp;G. I decided to use the OSB to smooth out some of the unevenness in the concrete slab. It is more expensive but using the DeltaFL as its own shimming mechanism just wasn&apos;t working well. All in all I&apos;ll have about $300-400 in OSB added to the overall cost for 2000 sq ft. of flooring. I got my Walnut for $1.48/ sq ft. So far the install is going very well and my wife is very pleased with the look and solid feel of the floor. She and my daughter even helped my install a couple rows over the weekend. I post a couple pictures when I get a chance. scomintay Mar 15th, 2010, 10:24 AM Laying that landscape fabric directly on the concrete would seem to be defeating the purpose. Seems to me that the landscape fabric is going to absorb moisture and hence a mold trap. Mike Holmes recommends that not even lumber should come in contact with the concrete.... but then again he has deep pockets and recommends against laminate all together.

Hearing about this clicking noise with the Delta pretty much makes my mind up to put it directly down on top of the poly per manufactures recomendations. Going to seal up the poly around the edges with some acuostiseal. How do you folks cut this stuff? Are fine tooth blades in the mitre saw and table saw important (I still have the original blades in mine)?

This laminate floor cuts pretty easily and cleanly. I use a 60 tooth blade (fine or combination blade) to cut it on both my table and chop saw. deep Mar 15th, 2010, 10:28 AM Did the hardwood go on sale along with the laminate? I recall last time they both went on at the same time... mork Mar 15th, 2010, 11:12 AM Did the hardwood go on sale along with the laminate? I recall last time they both went on at the same time...

No, it isn&apos;t as far as I recall. I saw someone wanting to buy the hardwood but they didn&apos;t even have it in stock for some reason. The laminate was filling its spot on the floor. laika Mar 15th, 2010, 02:50 PM Does anyone know where to get compatable transition moldings and t-moldings?

Home Depot has a 3 piece transition that matches perfectly.


Is it necessary to put down paper or padding on the plywood subfloor with the foam padding on the back of the laminate already?

No, the rubber pad on the laminate is far superior to any other laminate underlay... mgs157 Mar 16th, 2010, 02:31 PM I purchased the golden select walnut from Sam&apos;s club and had a question about installation. It appears that you install this floor plank by plank, is this correct? Also, I seem to be having the problem that when I install a plank a lot of the time the one next to it pops out.

One more thing, and I only have 3 rows done, but is it normal for the long edge of the boards to bow up a bit until you install another row?

Any tips that anyone who has installed this could provide would be greatly appreciated. oldpaint Mar 16th, 2010, 04:54 PM I purchased the golden select walnut from Sam&apos;s club and had a question about installation.

Assuming this is the same stuff as from Costco - yes plank by plank. Provided the floor is smooth and within level tolerances the planks should lay pretty flat before moving on to the next. Are you tapping them with a tapping block per the instructions? Planks need to be tapped to click into place and drop.

Because my floor (basement concrete) is a little uneven in places, I find that I often have to tap them a little directly on the groove (gently with a white mallet) before the plank will drop to where I can hit it the rest of the way with a tapping block. It&apos;s hard to tap them with a tapping block unless they drop to a low angle to the floor - so in those instances just a little love tap directly on the grooved edge. If they still refuse -- I start over as something is probably not lined up. Not to make the process complicated --- cause it isn&apos;t. Just takes a bit to get the hang of it. But most boards should lay pretty flat -- unless there is some very uneven-ness. The only place I had a board that would not stay down was one of the boards kept popping up in the first row (ie. the end of the board). It seemed to happen when I was on the third row or so -- I fiddled with it a bit but figured it will be held down fine when I put the base boards in. I have only done a room 12x15 so far - there was a hump in the center of the room that concerned me as it was at the limit of the tolerance - I was quite surprised how well it went in through that section.

About the best advise I can give is make sure the plank is lined up at the suggested 45 degree angle all the way -- then &apos;tap, tap, tap&apos; (but not too hard) until things fall into place. I only use a rubber mallet (white to prevent marks) - never a hammer. Use a tapping block where you can -- but I have found I do lots tapping directly on the groove edge of the plank too. In tight spots (egs. Last and second last rows) where you cannot tap the edge --- you have to tug back with your hands the best you can -- once it drops more or less into place I tap it with a scrap piece on top of the plank (rubber side of scap piece down) - careful not to force it though.

PS. Does anyone have any hints as to concrete floor leveling products? IE - best and worse. I have a pretty deep pot hole at the bottom of the stairway I have to fill in when I tackle the next stretch. Could get ugly too as I know I have to remove some lino under the carpet -- and possibly some lino adhesive left behind (possibly some paint too). mgs157 Mar 17th, 2010, 11:05 AM Thanks for the info, maybe I am not tapping them hard enough, I was worried about damaging the plank. The problem seems to be that I have to lift up the previous plank to slide the next one in and when I lift it up to tap it in it lifts up the previous plank and that&apos;s when it will sometimes pop out a little bit. Not sure if I am explaining this well, when I get home tonight I will take some pictures so you can see what I am doing wrong.

Thank you for all your help, I&apos;m a noob at this and appreciate it. mork Mar 17th, 2010, 12:00 PM mgs157 - I can envision what your saying perfectly. I would say you are not getting them clicked in quite right.

When you pull two attached pieces out of the box and put them on the floor, you will see they are perfectly flat/level and are quite secure. It is tough to get them to snap in - I couldn&apos;t do it by hand / applying pressure.. tapping/hammering is a must with this laminate.

I actually stood on the most recent row, grabbed a piece for the next row and held it at an angle and hammered it with a white rubber mallet using a decent amount of force (but not excessive). As I hammered, it really wanted to flatten out from the starting angle as it locked. Its tough to explain my technique, but it worked quite well.. didn&apos;t damage a single piece, and went very fast. oldpaint Mar 17th, 2010, 01:16 PM For those who have installed this, I see the instructions are recommending a 5/8&quot;gap around the perimeter. This seems pretty large. Later in the instructions it says to put on your baseboards and then add a quarter-round to hide the gap.

my baseboards are not wide enough at the base to hide anywhere near 5/8&quot;and I would rather not do the quarter-round.

how big of a gap did you guys leave?

Mork,
I was going through the thread to see if there were any comments about what seems to be larger expansion gap than normal. Glad to see you are still checking in here -- I am curious as to what size of expansion gap you ended up using. My first room (12x15) fell under the 3/8&quot;spacing. I am putting in new baseboards but was planning on using some left over from a previous project (at least for this room). The baseboards are 1/2&quot;- so as long as the plank is tight against the spacer it leaves about 1/8&quot;for shrinkage, etc. That in itself is not very much - so I found myself fiddling with my end cuts a lot and treating the accuracy like finishing work.

The area I am moving to now is much larger -- and therefore falls under the 5/8&quot;spacing requirement. I have talked to a couple carpenter types who tell me the standard expansion gap for laminate in this area is 1/4&quot;. I am left to wonder if the manufacturers suggested expansion gaps are meant for worst case climates that shift dramatically from humid to dry over the seasons. Since you live in a similar dry climate as me -- I would be interested in how you tackled this aspect.

I agree with your concern about adding the quarter round - I really don&apos;t want to do that either. It seems that one should be allowing at least 1/4&quot;coverage with the baseboard. To get this with a 5/8&quot;expansion spacing -- I would need to move to a 7/8&quot;+ baseboard - just seems very excessive. Anyone else willing to chiime in -- please do. mgs157 Mar 18th, 2010, 10:53 AM Ok, here are some pictures to illustrate what is going on. I tried tapping them harder but it did not seem to help. Also, I know there is carpet, but this is commercial grade (the previous owners used this as their office) that does not have any give. I was told I could leave it down and it would not cause a problem and would actually help as a barrier.

Thanks again for all your help. oldpaint Mar 18th, 2010, 12:46 PM mgs,
It looks like you are installing it in reverse. Turn the boards around 180 degrees (with the other side of the plank facing your starting wall). You will then be dropping the upper lip (containing the tongue) on to the lower lip (containing the groove) of the previously placed row. Continue going left to right (as it seems you are doing) so at the ends (as the plank falls into place) you are dropping the top lip onto the bottom lip of the previously placed plank.

Those planks you cut for your first row look pretty wide - so they should hopefully be salvagable when you reach your final row. Good Luck! mgs157 Mar 18th, 2010, 01:29 PM Wow do I feel foolish. I knew I had to be doing something wrong, glad I only did 3 rows. Thank you so much for your help! Tomcat2010 Mar 18th, 2010, 08:56 PM I went by Costco in Mississauga today, they only had 3 boxes of Walnut left. Associate checked stock for local stores but all were just about sold out. I am looking for 33 boxes, any help appreciated. Tom Melete Mar 19th, 2010, 01:31 AM Just bought 36 boxes over the weekend. We are just in the planning stage of finishing our basement and aren&apos;t anywhere near ready to put any flooring down but while researching laminate flooring I came upon this thread and decided that this was the stuff for us!

My brother-in-law works at Rona and he told us that even with his discount nothing at Rona could touch this laminate in terms of quality and price.

I can&apos;t wait to put this down in my basement. Maybe having the flooring waiting to be installed will get our butts in gear to finally get the basement finished;) deltone Mar 19th, 2010, 12:32 PM We had this installed in our bunkie (we bought it a few months back when it was last on sale), and we LOVE it.

I went ahead with a small gap, using spacers but mostly eyeballing it. It&apos;s too soon to tell yet whether I&apos;ll regret it or not.. Using a narrow basebaord (typical cheapo ones) I do have a small gap in a couple of places, but it was immediately apparent due to my own poor installation and not any sort of contraction. A little silicone will fix that up.

From past experience, I put laminate in a basement a long time ago in a previous house and did the same thing. It was cheap/thin stuff and probably much more susceptible to contraction and expansion and i never had problems with it.

We&apos;re going to be putting the same stuff in my parents place and plan to use a smaller-than-advised gap there as well. NoSmoke Mar 19th, 2010, 07:44 PM Just wondering how the Mountain Oak laminate will stand up to sunlight (I have lots of windows in the room in question). I expect it might fade or discolour but have had no experience with this type of product.

Any assistance appreciated....... nora578 Mar 20th, 2010, 12:03 AM MGS,

The boards should not bow upwards in the middle like that on their own. There is two possiblilities causing that;
1. The boards are too tight against your shim or the wall, the boards should never be a tight fit on the side, leave an expansion gap.
2. The floor is grossly uneven. If it is a basement you will need to address that issue before continuing. The boards should never slap downwards when you walk on them.

I am in the process of finishing my basement floor and I get a very light click noise with my Platon subfloor in some spots but it&apos;s not overly noticable and once you put furniture or something down it&apos;s gone. Once i&apos;m done I will post my pics of my Mountain Oak flooring. I didn&apos;t haul out my mitre saw for this flooring, I just used a jigsaw and it worked great. I have about a 30 foot run from the front to back and did not use a transistion piece (fugly). When comes to expansion gaps it depends on the temperature changes in that room from season to season as well as the humidity change. If you have a climate/humidity controlled house then 1/4 inch on both ends of the strip should be sufficient. The flooring companies always over do it to avoid the worst case scenario. oldpaint Mar 20th, 2010, 12:11 PM I went ahead with a small gap, using spacers but mostly eyeballing it.

Thanks for the reply Mork -- I will probably keep the 3/8&quot;gap in the larger area (34&apos; longest wall) -- might even downgrade to 1/4&quot;. From things I have heard here and other people I have talked to, 5/8&quot;is way overkill (at least for our drier climate).

If you&apos;re installing below grade (basement) you need to put a vapor barrier down to prevent moisture from coming through. IIRC, the instructions say a 6mil poly tuck taped. This laminate is nothing like the old glue stuff. If you have high or low spots you can deal with it a couple of different ways. A self levelling product or grinding the concrete down. The tolerances for unlevel are in the instructions... shaolinmonk Mar 21st, 2010, 11:07 AM Self leveling sounds good to me lol..

This was actually the first time i did any kind of home renovations.

Im really happy with the results. I think this Golden Select is much better than any of the ones i saw at HD,RONA and RenoDepot.

I sure hope i wont have any problems about the joints buckling due to humidity or whatever..... In certain corners of the room the space between the floor/wall is tight....

Sorry I&apos;m supposed to poly tuck tape the floor?

When putting the floor on top of concrete you use a poly vapour barrier (6mm) and where you have seams you seal them by using Tuck Tape (the red tape). This keeps the vapour barrier continuous. mgs157 Mar 22nd, 2010, 11:05 AM Just wanted to post an update. Now that I am doing it the correct way it is going in very easy!

2) Is it necessary remove the grooves on the planks facing the wall/transition pieces? And what is the best way to do it to avoid damaging the planks?

Yes there are 3 lengths of boards with this floor. Ideally you want to do a random stagger, just like you would with hardwood. And no, you do not remove the groove facing the wall or transitions. Against walls you need to leave an expansion gap and the same at transitions. Laminate transitions consist of a metal track that gets screwed to the floor and the actual transition snaps into the track.

Thanks for your response! My first question is answered. However for my 2nd question, I just read the instructions that came with the laminate and it states:

&quot;The tongue on the first row of planks should always be removed and the bottom lip of the groove side on the last row of the planks should always be removed&quot;

So this step can be ignored? If so, when you measure the expansion gap do you measure from the tongue or the finished surface? mgs157 Mar 24th, 2010, 02:34 PM I actually e-mailed the manufacturer and they said as long as you keep the expansion gap you can leave them.

Use a scrap cut off for your expansion gap. It&apos;s the easist thing to do and a trick the pros use. Wether you&apos;ll be cutting the first or last row will depend on your layout. Ideally you want the same widths of boards at each end. If you&apos;re lucky enough to have full boards at each end you don&apos;t have to cut the tongues or grooves off for the transitions that HD sells that match. If you&apos;re layout requires the first and last rows to be ripped down then you rip off the correct side of the plank.

I think what that quote you pulled is referring to is the way the floor is installed. You want to start the install with the tongue away from you, against the wall. You should be working in such a way as the plank you are installing will be putting the tongue of that plank into an already installed plank with a groove KWIM? Wiseman Mar 24th, 2010, 02:53 PM Ok, so for the expansion gap, is it measured from the end of the tongue or from the finished surface? (the tongue sticks out further).

Great info so far :) CSK&apos;sMom Mar 24th, 2010, 02:59 PM From the tongue. When the floor expands you want clearance from anything it can rub or get restricted against. That is why you undercut door jambs as well. The floor then sits under them but but still has room to expand. Wiseman Mar 24th, 2010, 04:13 PM I think I will cut the tongue on the first row of planks. Leaving the tongue on would mean you&apos;ll need to hide a 5/8&quot;gap + tongue length. Has anyone done this? I assume a table saw is required. oldpaint Mar 25th, 2010, 01:52 PM I think I will cut the tongue on the first row of planks. Leaving the tongue on would mean you&apos;ll need to hide a 5/8&quot;gap + tongue length. Has anyone done this? I assume a table saw is required.

When MGS relayed to me what he had found out from the manufacturer -- initially I thought it would be a big time saver. But you are right Wiseman - by leaving the tongue on you are adding almost another 1/8&quot;on to what seems like very excessive expansion gap recommendations from the manufacturer. One of the timesavers though will be on the end cuts at the start of each row (where there is no overlap in the finished plank and where the tongue extends).

My first room was smaller and fit under the 3/8&quot;recommendation. I cut the tongue off and am glad I did because the baseboards I plan on using are only 1/2&quot;thick. The larger room I will be doing soon (34 foot max wall) - I will probably continue with a 3/8&quot;expansion gap (5/8&quot;seems too excessive at least for this climate where 1/4&quot;is the norm). And I will continue cutting off the edge tongue (ie. first and last rows). To go with a 5/8&quot;gap + leave the tongue would mean going to either a 1&quot;thick baseboard -- OR quarter round - which I just feel would look out of place for my application.

One word of advice. Before doing your first cut and installing your first row - do some careful planning as to what the final row width will be and how this initial cut also affects any obstacles in between. And take measurements at various points in the room. At very least at both ends. In the smaller room I did - I only measured at one end and almost came up short with the final row at the other end of the room.

My next phase has a more complicated configuration. The starting wall is 34 feet wide. The ending wall (primarily an entrance into a bedroom) will be about 4 feet wide. In between are several other end walls, angles and obstacles. I plan on plotting all the points on a spread sheet and calculate different scenarios in picking the most suitable starting plank width.

The other important thing to remember is you cannot install this product backward. Some configurations might require that. It&apos;s best to plan around this rather than suddenly get stumped and have to rip it out and start all over, or put in a transition where it would look very out of place. saritzie Mar 27th, 2010, 05:21 PM we were sooo excited to buy the walnut shade of this flooring and installed it throughout our livingroom, dining room, and hallways. We have different laminate flooring in almost every other room, and this was by far the nicest looking, and by far the worst decision we have ever made. It scratches if you look at it the wrong way, and it&apos;s bubbling in areas that have never seen a drop of water. We have lots of experience with laying, using, and caring for laminate, and have had no issues like this in any of the other rooms. I found this thread trying to look up the company to see if I could get my money back and signed up to this site just to warn potential buyers. It looks great, but if you plan on doing any sort of&quot;living&quot;(including adjusting chairs on the floor), you will regret buying this. BushCaddy Mar 27th, 2010, 09:39 PM I agree with the previous post. I am NOT impressed with this flooring. I posted comments to that effect several pages back, but no on else seemed to agree, thought it was just me.

As the previous poster said, it scratches if you look at it the wrong way, and if you drop something on it, from even a foot or two, it will leave a nasty chip. Also, the top coat is fading inconsistently between boards. Some look brand new, and others look weathered and old, after only 2 months.

I definitely would not buy this stuff again.

I&apos;m going to see about some kind of refund as well. jumbojones Mar 28th, 2010, 08:45 AM Costco will accept most anything back, I returned a elliptical 10 months after I bought it.

After reading the last two complaints regarding this flooring, I decided to do some stress tests on one of these laminate boards. I dropped a can of beans at 1ft height twice.. no marks at all.. Then I did a drop at 2 feet at an angle.. it resulted in a big gash.. not good.. but it&apos;s not likely a can would be dropped in the living room, so I moved on to test with dinky cars. What an eye opener.. after 4 drop tests, I have 4 marks on the laminate.. Two direct drops at 1 ft and 2 light tosses at 1ft, all resulting in scarring of the laminate..

I&apos;m glad I did this test before installing the stuff, and am seriously considering returning this to Costco. Has anyone else besides Bushcaddy and Saritzie experienced this flakiness? Could it be the finish colour (I bought Mountain Oak). My kids often drop their toys, so this is a definate problem for me. CSK&apos;sMom Mar 28th, 2010, 10:59 PM Ours has been fine and in for a full year now. Hubby was dropping hammers, utility knife(blade out), a drywall saw and screws galore today from up to ceiling height today and nothing. We were walking all over it with sawdust, knife blades and drywall dust too and nothing. We have 2 dogs that run laps, drag furniture around regularly (gotta move stuff out for the full wii experience :D), wear our shoes on it, drag wheeled hockey bags and we don&apos;t have a single mark. And I will say that we are hard on floors. We&apos;ve had high end, pre-finished hardwoods and totally trashed it within a year...

Wow.. is it possible that the manufacturing has changed over the past year? Or are they are now made by someone else but labelled Golden Select? Your experience vs my tests are like night and day.. a 1 ft drop of a 2 inch toy car defaced the laminate. noodles Mar 28th, 2010, 11:54 PM More confused than ever now!! :confused: CSK&apos;sMom Mar 29th, 2010, 12:18 AM Wow.. is it possible that the manufacturing has changed over the past year?

Could be, I don&apos;t know. We haven&apos;t been into Costco in a bit either so I haven&apos;t seen the latest stock. We&apos;re building a wall right now in one corner of the room for the flatscreen and a fireplace, hence all the dropping in the last couple of days. ;) deltone Mar 29th, 2010, 01:34 AM Yikes, now I&apos;m getting scared. Our 575 sq feet have already been installed (and we paid to have it done) so if it&apos;s junk, we&apos;re scr*wed because no way we&apos;re uninstalling it and carting it back to Costco.

We&apos;re not using it as yet so not sure how it will withstand stuff but I&apos;m praying it does cause of where it is it&apos;ll be somewhere that will not be treated as fragile. UGH mork Mar 29th, 2010, 03:16 PM I&apos;ve had this installed in the basement for a couple of months (dark Walnut colour) and picked up another 1300sq.ft. for my parents place..

My experience has been positive, but in light of recent comments I took a spare piece from my installed batch and subjected it to some testing.

Normal key - applying quite firm pressure I vigorously attempted to scratch it and there was nothing to be seen from the torture I inflicted.

Wrench - dropping a large crescent wrench from various distances yielded various results.. usually no detectable damage even from 4+ feet up. Some hits did leave a impression that is only visible when really looking for it and a couple of hits did chip through the coloured layer and expose the layer beneath. I think those hits are when the sharp edge of the wrench open hit.

Nails/screws - dropped from any height do nothing.

small hammer - lightly hitting with the claws of the hammer chipped the flooring just about every time. This surprised me a little, as the strength of the strikes were very light.. equal and stronger taps from the blunt end left no damage. Hard strikes left dents.

So, durable to an extent, but my experiments seem to suggest sharp/pointy objects will easily chip through (I was surprised how easily). For scratching, the key test I did was probably more abuse than a floor would experience in normal use and it survived fine.

I&apos;m not sure how this compares to other laminates. For what it is worth, my expensive pre-finished hard wood flooring would have been extremely damaged from these torture tests.

A friend has had the flooring for 6 months in his basement and pretty much confirms your comments. I have 26 boxes here in my apt. awaiting a basement installation when I take possesion of my house in June.

From what I gather, under average basement wear the flooring holds up. but I wouldn&apos;t expect to install this flooring in my kitchen and expect it to hold up the same as $6/ sq ft hardwood flooring (using a more extreme example just for contrast) mork Mar 30th, 2010, 01:05 PM Weirdest thing. So I take a piece of my parents yet-to-be-installed dark walnut to demonstrate to them the durability and the stuff was basically indestructible. Very hard stabs with a screw driver weren&apos;t even breaking the top layer, it just nearly-invisible dents. Drops of heavy soup cans from several feet did nothing.

hmm.. mgs157 Mar 30th, 2010, 01:26 PM I also did some testing with a scrap piece and it seemed pretty durable. I dropped a set of keys from about 5 ft and no damage and scraped it and had no problems either. Dropping a screwdriver and a can of soup also produced no damage. Dropping a masonry drill bit did some damage but would think you could hide it with a little bit of nail polish if it was somewhere that did not get a lot of light. It just chipped a bit of the finish off.

This is the walnut colored and I purchased it at Sam&apos;s Club in the US. nora578 Mar 31st, 2010, 09:00 AM People remember we are talking about wood drop anything heavy and sharp onto a piece of wood and guess what the sharp thing will win. I guess thats why they make saws sharp?!?

The only method that is worth anything is the scratch test and this is pretty durable stuff, more so because of the price. I was having a real hard time using a 3 inch framing nail to scratch a cut line onto this laminate when I was installing it. Try dropping an edge of a soup can on 3/4&quot;real hardwood and watch the owner cry. Life happens and so will dents and chips, just find a good filler or touchup product for those unfortunate circumstances. As far as I can tell this stuff is durable and looks good to boot. If you want expensive buy something more expensive. Sorry just my rant, nothing personal.

Golden Select Mountain Oak. rioriorio Apr 2nd, 2010, 09:20 PM Great feed back on the Golden Select Laminate. I&apos;m about to do my basement with the mountain oak, but have a few questions:

- I&apos;ve read its best to lay the flooring in the direction sunlight would
be coming in. I have 3 windows in my stubby t style basement (top of
the t is 40&apos; with 9&apos; on each end then 16&apos; in the middle) I was hoping
to install length wise to save on cutting.

- At 40&apos; long, is this to long or do I have to worry about some kind of
transition point.

- Regarding the delta / platon underlay, where we initially had carpet, would
this extra under-pad improve warmth or do I stick with the 6mm moisture
barrier? I not crazy about the potential clicking sound or the added 1/2&quot;
or so its would add as I have a couple of rooms where the tile is quite low.

Any comments would be appreciated marciemp Apr 3rd, 2010, 01:38 AM We just installed something very similar in our basement and we did 32 feet, you don&apos;t need a transition. We were looking at the Costco stuff but decided on a different brand just due to the colours at Costco not being what we have in our house as far as wood goes. You can install with just the underlay on the floor with a vapor barrier. We added a similar foam underlay on our floor because it did not have a built in one like the Costco one but it is pretty much the same idea. It was easy to install. Our windows are along the long wall and we installed in the same direction, going along parallel to the long wall. I can see a benefit to going the other way because our floor is not perfectly level, when the light shines in the windows you can see the dips and raised areas a bit (some boards slightly higher than others) due to the shadows the sun casts. But because it is in a basement and we will eventually have blinds on the windows to prevent such a harsh light it will not be as noticeable, also once there is furniture. It is not really noticeable anyway unless you are staring at it for that reason. CSK&apos;sMom Apr 3rd, 2010, 02:27 PM Great feed back on the Golden Select Laminate.

Ok, here goes. It not imperative to install in the direction of the sunlight. Esthetics come into play as well. For that reason alone we changed the direction when we put this laminate in. We have a first generation of open concept. Living room/dining room along one side of the house with a hall wall with a huge archway opening. Both the living/dining and hall open into the kitchen along the back of the house. We opted to run the laminate side to side this time to avoid the bowling alley look in the hallway. Visually it makes the rooms look wider.

Now, do you have any doorways? If you do and choose to install along the 40 foot run that install a transition in the doorway. 40 feet is really pushing it without a transition at some point, especially in a basement.

You don&apos;t have to install Delta. It&apos;s really just a safety net for water. If you know your basement is dry the vapour barrier is fine, especially if you have other finish floors to take into consideration. rioriorio Apr 3rd, 2010, 08:02 PM Regarding the 40&apos; length, don&apos;t have any door ways. I have a couple of rooms where there is tile and concrete and will take your advise on the HD 3pc transition kit. Is there a comparable match with the mountain oak?

The basement is as dry/moist as basements go. I run a dehumidifier (60pints/28L) in the summer and at 60% setting it fills up twice a week. Never really had any problems with the moisture. My parents put down a 12mm laminate in their basement and their floor seems very cold now. Our kids have bad dust mite allergies hence ripping out the carpeting and going with the laminate. Thought the platon subfloor would take some edge off the coldness.

Still kinda worried about the 40&apos; length though. Not crazy about laying the flooring the other direction.

I agree with this comment. For the price, so far I&apos;ve been pleased. Just finished installing this floor in approx. 1800 sq ft in my basement. Installed over Delta FL (as an extra precaution) and plywood subfloor (we have 9 ft ceiling in the basement so plenty of room. I&apos;ve installed Pergo before and this installed just as easily and I would say the durability is good, not exceptional but good, particularly for the price. I was not easy on it during the installation and only had to scrap about 6-7 pieces (out of 60 cases used) from excessive force pounding it into place (misstrikes from hammer, etc). There was sawdust and various debris on the floor for 3 1/2 weeks that was walked on over and over. No sign of wear, looks great. I don&apos;t plan on dropping hammers, soup cans, etc on the floor. If I do, then I accept the potential damage that could be done. I $3-4/sq ft floor has the same potential for damage with those types of objects.

I&apos;ll send some pictures soon. It is by far one of the most beautiful looking floors I&apos;ve seen. We&apos;ve already received wonderful compliments from family/friends and interior designers that have seen it. And for the $1.50/sq ft price, good overall quality value in my opinion. laika Apr 14th, 2010, 09:36 AM I not crazy about the potential clicking sound

I followed the suggestion on another forum and put landscape fabric over the concrete before rolling out the platon. There is absolutely NO clicking sound!

First, which side had the tongue ? to me, when you are looking at a single plank directly from above, the MDF colored lip that you see sticking out from under the board should be the tongue.

Is that right ?


and if it is right, every board i install, i insert at a 45 degree angle, press down firmly, and then with a tapping block, i tap is sideways untill it locks with the board beside it. however 70 percent of the time a small peice of the tongue breaks off. is that normal ?


anyway, tommorow afternoon im suppsoe to finish the floor, i have only done 4 rows so far, and i could really use some help


Thanks ! mork Apr 17th, 2010, 10:58 PM You shouldn&apos;t really need to tap them sideways.. and if you are tapping on the tongue (which you have correctly defined) then it will probably break.

For your first row, the long-end tongue should be against the wall and the short-edge tongue should be in to the room. The rest of the 1st row you just put them down, one on top of the next (no tapping or angles will be required).

For the 2nd row, you insert the 1st piece by holding it at an angle while lowering it and pressing firmly (I actually tap it in with a mallet as I lower it). The next piece of row-2, put it on the lip while holding it at the 45 degree angle and slide it over to its correct place and push it down/in.

From what you&apos;ve described I think you started with the short-edge tongue also against the wall and so each subsequent piece you have to tap sideways afterwards. I find that these lock together good enough that tapping them over requires a lot of force.

Try starting your next row from the other side of the room and you&apos;ll see what I mean. mork Apr 17th, 2010, 11:05 PM FYI. I had to order a bunch of transition pieces for my parents installation.

Thanks for this post - it helped us decide to do try out the floors.

We had at a local Sam&apos;s club so 12 boxes are warming to the room temperature (per the instructions).

We took a box apart and started laying out east/west and north/south and it looks good (a little wide) but not bad for laminate.

A national floors shop actually sold us on it when they showed us really crappy laminate and the Golden Select was priced pretty aggressive for what it is (nice walnut finish as well).

So we are installing it tomorrow (well starting it out) - there is a ton of prep work, etc.

I am also using some of the tips from the list


scraps for expansion gaps
finer blade for the saw (mine is rough)


So thanks to you all - and I will try and post pictures, etc.

BZ vluzhko Apr 21st, 2010, 12:33 PM Hi
I&apos;m in process of installing this laminate in my 800 sq.f. basement. I need a transition between rooms as total length comes to 40&apos;. So I decided to put transition under the door.
HD has color matching 3 piece transition but it says it can accommodate up to 12 CM thick laminate. Golden Select is almost 15 cm. Am I missing something. does HD have another transition?
Can people who installed this transition from HD confirm that it will click into transition holder?

Thanks CSK&apos;sMom Apr 21st, 2010, 12:42 PM Yep, the HD 3 piece transition is just fine. This laminate is actually 12mm with 2 mm pad attached... vluzhko Apr 21st, 2010, 01:29 PM Does anyone know where I can find 96&quot;long transition for this laminate? I have laundry separated from room by wide mirror sliding doors. There is tile floor in there which is lower then laminate. What would be better solution.
As an option I can put Tile transition (dark aluminium). BushCaddy Apr 21st, 2010, 09:34 PM FYI. I had to order a bunch of transition pieces for my parents installation.

I ordered these transition strips and had to send them back. They were cheap looking and the dimensions didn&apos;t match the ones listed in the diagram. As near as I could tell, they were for a much thinner laminate flooring.

In fairness to J Sonic, they took them back no problem, and even paid for shipping both ways.

Ended up buying real wood transition strips from Rona that were a perfect match. lakeman67 Apr 22nd, 2010, 11:24 AM Hi,

I&apos;m installing my golden select laminate in my basement this weekend. The baseboards are already on, with an approximate half inch gap above the concrete. I will be laying down delta FL and then the laminate on top. My question to anyone is...If the gap to the walls is bigger than 3-5/8s, what, if any problems would this cause? When completed I plan on nailing a matching routed shoe moulding that matches the baseboards...makes it look like all one baseboard.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. lakeman67 Apr 22nd, 2010, 01:36 PM I&apos;ve watched quite a few&quot;how to&quot;videos on installing laminate and these seem pretty good.

A larger gap is not a problem. Just make sure your shoe moulding covers it, check frequently during install. Remember when installing the shoe moulding to not nail it through the laminate, only into the baseboard...

Transitions don&apos;t come that long, 94&quot;is the max. You&apos;ll have to do it in 2 pieces. If you use the tile transition just remember to not fasten it through the laminate at all, only through the tile itself. lakeman67 Apr 23rd, 2010, 11:07 AM can someone tell me how I insert a picture in this forum? mgs157 Apr 23rd, 2010, 11:14 AM You have to host it somewhere like http://imageshack.us/

thx for the tips folks. barf Apr 23rd, 2010, 01:41 PM Is this laminate okay to use for the kitchen? Do I need to add some kind of sealant (like click seal) to keep out water? laika Apr 24th, 2010, 03:31 PM I also am desperately wondering about some kind of sealant!

My VERY BAD CAT has decided, now that the floor is , to NOT USE her litter boxes! (she uses the new floor as her litter box!)

I am shocked at how bad the damage is already, especially as I tried soaking a sample board in water for a couple of days before I started installing the floor, and that piece was not affected at all.

I would really appreciate any advice on how to treat the floor to minimize any further damage. Getting rid of the 10 yr old cat is not an option.

Personally, I wouldn&apos;t worry about putting it in a kitchen. My parents are planning to do their living room and possibly kitchen with it. Sure, there are water sources in the kitchen, but how often do you have a big puddle on the floor that you don&apos;t attend to right away? cRaZyRaVr Apr 26th, 2010, 08:25 AM For those who put this on concrete floor... did you use any extra padding or did you just go with whats on the panels? I will be doing my living/dining and bedroom with this next weekend and need to know if I should pick up any padding or am I safe with it as is. laika Apr 26th, 2010, 10:55 AM get platon from home depot,( its cheaper than the delta product) and lay landscape fabric directly on the concrete first to keep the floor quiet! lakeman67 Apr 26th, 2010, 04:57 PM get platon from home depot,( its cheaper than the delta product) and lay landscape fabric directly on the concrete first to keep the floor quiet!

1000 lb/sqft is quite a bit actually. Significantly more than your average office tower floor loading limit. How often do you have things over 1000lb resting in an area 30 cm x 30 cm? That is more than strong enough to park a car on. cRaZyRaVr Apr 27th, 2010, 08:35 AM So wait... I have to get two things now? Platon and landscape fabric or are these two the same thing?

- laminate

Is this how that goes? Wouldnt a roll of a cheap base material do it since the laminate already has the padding on it? CSK&apos;sMom Apr 27th, 2010, 10:43 AM So wait... I have to get two things now? Platon and landscape fabric or are these two the same thing? Could someone please clarify?

Are you installed above or below grade? If below grade and you absolutely know you have a dry basement then all you need to do is to put down vapour barrier and tuck tape it then install the laminate. If you&apos;re not 100% sure the basement is dry all the time then go the platon route.
Read the instructions in the box when all else fails. :) cRaZyRaVr Apr 27th, 2010, 11:24 AM This is in a 14th story condo so I am well above grade lol :) CSK&apos;sMom Apr 27th, 2010, 01:03 PM This is in a 14th story condo so I am well above grade lol :)

So you&apos;ll be good to go. Just make sure you check with your condo assoc. for sound deadening requirements before installing or risk having them force you to remove it if someone complains. ;) vluzhko Apr 27th, 2010, 02:21 PM I just finished installing laminate in my basement. All 800 sq.feet. Looks very nice. Will post pictures soon, when finish vacuum the mess after miter and table saws.
Now I&apos;m about to refinish basement stairs.
So here is question. How do I finish L-Shaped landing. My idea was to put laminate on it and then stain oak steps and raisers into walnut so it will match the laminate. But how do I make first step of the landing? Is there bullnose available of the same thickness as this laminate?
Normally Laminate should match any bullnose without even transition as this edge could be one of finished edges of laminate and can be very smooth without cutting.
What is those bullnose (which manufacturer provides) made of? Is this MDF like laminate or solid wood?
I would rather go with solid wood as this will be traffic area. MAy be someone knows a store in Mississauga area with bulnoses available.

thanks lakeman67 Apr 27th, 2010, 04:32 PM so, i&apos;ve got the costco mountain oak laminate ready to go.. I&apos;ve covered half my basement floor with Delta FL. Now my concerns are 1- should i have laid down roofing paper or landscape paper under the Delta to avoid noise?...or is the 14mm laminate heavy enough that it won&apos;t make noise when we walk?

2- should I be sealing the Delta at the drywall perimeter (under the baseboards)with low expansion foam?

help! laika Apr 27th, 2010, 09:17 PM Since Platon and Delta are semi stiff plastic they make a tapping sound when placed directly on concrete. If you are concerned about the floor making a noise when you walk on it, get a big roll of landscape fabric from Costco and roll the concrete first. It helps muffle the tapping. laika Apr 27th, 2010, 09:19 PM Is there any way to fill in the grooves in this flooring?
Thanks! crackerjacksue May 4th, 2010, 11:03 AM Hi, does anyone know what the costco laminate flooring actual Brand is?
is 15mm a good quality?

thanks, sue mgs157 May 4th, 2010, 11:19 AM The brand we are talking about here is called Golden Select. I bought mine at Sam&apos;s Club but believe other people have bought it as costco as well. This is 14mm think and I have not seen anything at home depot/lowes that was anywhere near as thick. It is really good stuff and a hell of a deal. mork May 4th, 2010, 12:23 PM The brand is&quot;Golden Select&quot;and is imported and distributed by J. Sonic Services Inc.

I just purchased t-molding and reducer from flooring store&quot;Oscar Flooring&quot;in Brampton. It is much better quality and price then transition in Home Depot.
1. It is long (8&apos;) exactly matching color for 24$ comparing to HD $20 for 3&apos;. So you can make 3 transitions for the price.
2. Transition for different height is solid one, not from 2 or 3 pieces.

In addition I purchased laminate bullnose for my stair landing. This bullnose is much better then one from supplier. It overlaps laminate on one side for more then 1.4&quot;and has this nosing matching stair step.
They can even stain it for you, but I&apos;m doing it myself. Wiseman May 10th, 2010, 06:57 PM I just purchased t-molding and reducer from flooring store&quot;Oscar Flooring&quot;in Brampton. It is much better quality and price then transition in Home Depot.

Which colour did the transition match exactly?
Walnut or Mountain Oak? crackerjacksue May 10th, 2010, 07:12 PM I have a couple of questions
1. why is the costco lam so much thicker than most 8mm lam
2. does the product come with a foam back installed?
3. should I add an additional layer to avoid&quot;click&quot;(have dog)
4. are the transition pieces readily available?

2. does the product come with a foam back installed?
3. should I add an additional layer to avoid&quot;click&quot;(have dog)
4. are the transition pieces readily available?

1. Because it was made that way. There are laminates available just as thick, but usually at a higher price point. Thicker laminates generally give a better&quot;feel&quot;and less laminate-sound and less flex. Generally speaking, thicker is better.. but other things determine quality as well.

2. yes. It is a convenient feature of this flooring. makes installation that much easier and saves cost in buying other foam.

3. Not sure

4. Yes. Information on ordering from J. Sonic is in this thread as well as other discussion regarding other suitable transitions. cRaZyRaVr May 11th, 2010, 12:08 PM I just installed the floors in my apartment and it looks amazing and with all the hummer dragging on the floor, furniture moving back and forth and not being overly careful, no scratches yet.
I went to HD to looks for transition pieces (floor to tile) but nothing matches color wise. Today after work will go to that Oscar Flooring shop someone mentioned. If I dont find anything there... where do I go? I got the darker floor tiles. cRaZyRaVr May 12th, 2010, 09:39 AM Just to verify, Oscar Flooring in Brampton has the transtions that perfectly match the dark laminate at they are $20 for 8&apos; long piece. lakeman67 May 20th, 2010, 12:40 PM Hey Virgoan

Once again.. fantastic job!

Well, I got my Mountain Oak laminate ready to go. The question I wanted to ask you is....The length of my basement is over 35ft long. Should I lay my laminate across the width to avoid having to use a transition at the 35ft mark as per instructions. Was your length longer than the 35ft.?

The room is longer vs. wider and running the length will give the bowling alley effect. Running the width will fool the eye into thinking the room is wider than it is. lakeman67 May 20th, 2010, 01:40 PM lakeman, purely for esthetic reasons I would run the laminate across the room vs. the length.

I love your basement too! very well done.

I agree with CSK&apos;sMom...I would lay it across the room. I am not sure what is the length of our basement..probably around 35ish too. aegean May 25th, 2010, 12:17 AM Just wondering if Golden Select ever goes on sale? Thanks in advance. rossnick May 25th, 2010, 09:00 AM Just wondering if Golden Select ever goes on sale? Thanks in advance.
It was in febuary or march this year. It was something like 7$ off per box. If I had known, I would not have bought it on january 30th to get it on my tax return, I would have saved more.

Anyway, I took advendtage of the long weekend of the patriot&apos;s day (not sure it is canada-wide), do finaly do finish the walls so I can paint next weekend and hopefully install my flooring the weekend after.

As for the subfloor, I decided to go with delta-fl. I found it in Quebec city at 55$/roll of 105 s.f. Not sure if it&apos;s a special, I will pick it up later today, they had none in stock. pdangcil May 25th, 2010, 11:03 PM I&apos;m here in the states (Utah) and bought these at Sam&apos;s Club. I&apos;m in the process of installing them. However, I don&apos;t know what to do with the ones closest to the stairs? Can&apos;t seem to find a matching color.
I heard (several posts back) that the stairnoses are pretty much crap. If this is the case, what would be the best way for me to finish with the boards closest to the stairs (going down). shaolinmonk May 26th, 2010, 10:09 AM did any of you guys use the self leveling compound for your basement floors? if so did you just pour it throughout or only where the dips are??

Would love to hear any ideas to make the laminate more water/ pet proof too.

I would NEVER put laminate in the kitchen. There will always been small water spills that you don&apos;t see that will cause expansion which can only be repaired by replacing the piece. I&apos;ve also seen some unexpected fridge leaks causing large patches of damage. noodles May 26th, 2010, 01:48 PM Any idea when it will be on sale again?

My guess is not untill next year, if not 2012... Then, it might not be availaible again. Even at it&apos;s regular price of 40$ per box, it&apos;s realy not too expensive.

I beleive it&apos;s a damn good for the price. pdangcil May 27th, 2010, 12:46 AM It&apos;s still on sale at Sam&apos;s club!

Anyways, didn&apos;t get a reply back about the stairnoses... should i just buy a regular stairnose and stain with the same color as the walnut?

I put one from the manufacturer in my parents installation. It wasn&apos;t too expensive and seems okay. Matches fine. rossnick May 30th, 2010, 04:12 PM Hi !

I just begun installing my laminate. I decided to fo with delta FL I got for 59$/105&apos; roll from my local Home Hardware. I also decided to put a landscape weedprotector-type fabric under the delta fl. It doesn&apos;t add much to the cost and it&apos;s a pain to install afterwards ;-)

So, strangly, I had to begin in a closet. I encountered my fitrst embush when exiting the closet :

http://iweb.cybercat.ca/~rossnick/golden.jpg

Excuse me of the quality of the photo, I took it with my iPhone.

So, at the right, I cut my piece to fit just under the closet casing. But because of the casing I cannot put the piece at the correct angle to make it snap. How do I do that ? mork May 30th, 2010, 04:50 PM I can&apos;t see whats going on in the pic.. but hammer it in. Use a scrap piece mated to it as a hammering block.. i did a few where I wasn&apos;t able to angle. rossnick May 30th, 2010, 05:13 PM Sorry for the quality of the pic.

I tried putting the piece flat and hammer it in using a notched piece of wood, and I couldn&apos;t get the piece in place. I guess I&apos;ll have to hammer harder. mork May 30th, 2010, 10:34 PM Sorry for the quality of the pic.

I tried putting the piece flat and hammer it in using a notched piece of wood, and I couldn&apos;t get the piece in place. I guess I&apos;ll have to hammer harder.

I employed a few techniques.. try putting a crowbar or pry-bar under the piece and lifting to give it even a bit of an angle while hammering.

You may also want to look for some way to slide it in to place.. attach it to the previous row further up and tap it until it is in place.

I hit many jams in my installation.. I planned those rows (by cutting the first piece against the wall as needed) so that a a board would end right at the jam and then I could do the above with the following piece. e.g. I would have no pieces with a&quot;notch&quot;cut out in their centers, only pieces with notches cut at either end of it. I think this is the situation you are in (?).. if all else fails, redo the row with a specific length board starting it so you end up as I&apos;ve described.

I apologize if mm description makes no sense. :) laika May 31st, 2010, 09:19 PM Transitions for all colours are available at Brampton Hardwood flooring. laika May 31st, 2010, 09:24 PM (have dog)

Unless your dog is fool proof 100%garanteed housetrained and will never ever have an&quot;accident&quot;on the floor DO NOT get this product!

(probably applies to toddlers too)

Laika laika May 31st, 2010, 09:33 PM The main area of the basement is done ( a 20 X30 L shape ), but having experienced how badly it reacts to pet damage I need to find something else for the landing area. ( 10 X15 )

I don&apos;t like the feel of ceramic

Does anyone have any experience with groutable peel and stick vinyl tiles? Home depot has some that look decent for between $1.50 andd $2.00 a piece.

Thanks,
Laika CSK&apos;sMom May 31st, 2010, 10:22 PM laika, your problem with your pet is not the floor per say. It&apos;s that the accident has been left unnoticed long enough to damage the floor. If you think the damage you&apos;re seeing is bad, just think about what hardwood would look like. For the record, the wood turns black from underneath the finish and can not be removed, even with refinishing. Sitting liquid is bad for any wood/laminate floor, typical spill and wipe up is something entirely different.

If your cat is that bad why not vinyl, either sheet goods or a solid product. The solid products come in both square and plank formats. You can get patterns with everything from tile to stone to wood to cork and the crazy like grass. :) HD sells the TrafficMaster brand which is actually a very good solid product that is a floating floor and easily repairable. laika May 31st, 2010, 11:06 PM laika, your problem with your pet is not the floor per say.

It took seconds!
I caught the little beast in the act, wiped up immediately, and put flat boards and a heavy weight on top to try and stop the floor from swelling - no success. BushCaddy Jun 1st, 2010, 05:49 PM I&apos;ve got to agree that this floor is damaged REALLY easily by water/pet urine.

this is definitely not a good sign... i just installed mine and am wondering what other people&apos;s experience is. i installed mine in my living room all the way to the kitchen. however, on a side note, i really love the look and feel of mine!:lol: rossnick Jun 7th, 2010, 10:04 AM Installed one room last weekend. Boy my knees hurts ;-)

http://iweb.cybercat.ca/~rossnick/salon.jpg

I am not as advanced as I would have loved, but that&apos;s another storry. I installed with delta-fl and landscape fabric under. For the low cost it adds, I do not regret the landscape fabric under the delta-fl, it makes a difference.

As for the variate plank size, it&apos;s a great look, but sometime it&apos;s a plain to make joints that are at least 8&quot;apart. I had to accept one or 2 7&quot;...

Even if the surface is solid and seems resistant to use, during the installation, it is easily&quot;chipable&quot;. I chipped several pieces will installing them, and on others I chipped the corner of them.

As for water resistance, my 4-years old drop a glass of juice on my newly finished floor, and I wiped it dry ASAP, and I didn&apos;t see any damage except for a little bumps in the middle of one plank, and I&apos;m not sure it&apos;s because of the spill.

That brings me to a question, once install, how do we change a plank in the middle of the place ?

I&apos;m moving in August and I hope it goes on sale between now and then... :) mgs157 Jun 14th, 2010, 12:53 PM I was concerned over the posts claiming issues with water so I did a little test last night. I took two scraps and locked them together, placed them on my sink and poured some water on the seam. I let it sit for a couple minutes and then dried it with a paper towel. As of this morning there is not any sign of damage whatsoever. This was to simulate spilling and cleaning up immediately, which would normally be the case. Tonight I will let the water sit all night without cleaning to see how bad the damage will be.

Also, as a couple people have already asked, what is the best way to replace a damaged plank? CSK&apos;sMom Jun 14th, 2010, 01:00 PM kramerz, this floor isn&apos;t in the summer savings book. This time around it&apos;s hardwood and golden select bamboo.

mgs, there are 2 ways to replace a damaged plank. Because it&apos;s click, remove the floor back to the damamge and replace. The other option is to actually cut out the damaged plank and replace, just like hardwood. kramerz80 Jun 15th, 2010, 01:44 PM kramerz, this floor isn&apos;t in the summer savings book.

Costco doesn&apos;t do&quot;sales&quot;per say, they do coupons. 4 times a year members get a coupon book listing everthing that will be on coupon each week. When this floor has been on coupon it&apos;s always been in the book. It may be in the fall book but we&apos;ll have to wait and see... noodles Jun 16th, 2010, 12:25 PM Sorry for the questions as I&apos;m also not currently a Costco member. When does the fall book come out? August? September?

My basement is in the (slow) process of being finished and I may want to hold off on the floor if this is going to go on sale at some point this year. CSK&apos;sMom Jun 16th, 2010, 12:33 PM The next book should be out in August as the summer book is good through August 29th. pepper3245 Jun 16th, 2010, 02:14 PM Also, as a couple people have already asked, what is the best way to replace a damaged plank?

I think the only way to replace a plank is to&quot;reverse engineer&quot;your install. I did it once for a piece that did not click in. Took about an hour to remove/install a 10&apos; x 8&apos; section. mork Jun 18th, 2010, 07:51 PM Just wanted to post another update.

All my scrap/cut pieces sat outside through many rains over several weeks and hardly had any damage. literally submerged at times. There was some minor swelling of the bottom, but no surface damage/peeling/etc.. there seems to be some varying quality on these floors.. other have said theirs dents/scratches very easily and mine seems to be reasonably durable. mork Jun 18th, 2010, 07:54 PM You could saw down the middle of the damaged plank and break it out of its spot without damaging the surrounding planks. The replacement piece would need its tongue/whatever cut off on the one side and then slip it in to place. In order to secure it you could use some glue under it or a couple of nails through it (not ideal) that you cover afterwords with some wax filled. I don&apos;t know how this laminate would handle having a nail shot through it.. it might split the surface layer. newfieinthefalls Jun 20th, 2010, 04:35 PM All my scrap/cut pieces sat outside through many rains over several weeks and hardly had any damage. literally submerged at times.

We installed the walnut laminate in our bedrooms upstairs. One of the kids knocked over a glass with some water in it and I didn&apos;t find it till the morning. The wood swelled terribly. We hoped if we left it for a few days it would dry and shrink back but no go. We had to rip out and replace a 2x4 foot section. Needless to say, no more drinks in the bedrooms! vanskelig Jun 20th, 2010, 06:56 PM I have this in my basement, or rather had. Minor water seeped in and destroyed a section of it a few weeks ago and then, with the weather, the whole thing was wiped out from moisture from the concrete.

I dont plan on replacing it with more laminate. laika Jun 28th, 2010, 03:20 PM Just wanted to post another update.

I soaked the smaller boards in water and left cut pieces in the rain with no damage, so was shocked at how quickly pet pee damaged the floor.

The type of liquid seems to make a big difference.

Also,when I opened the boxes, the boards were packed in two very different ways. I wonder if this is made in more than one factory/location and if that might account for differing levels of quality.

Thanks! dealman5 Jul 29th, 2010, 12:14 AM Ordered direct thru manufacturer, and they ship it direct to your house mgs157 Jul 29th, 2010, 09:15 AM Take a piece to your local lumber yard with the dimensions you need and they should be able to make you whatever trim you need. mbalgavy Jul 29th, 2010, 12:09 PM Had experience with the hardwood, not laminate. While the quality was pretty good for the price paid (as our installer mentioned), we ended up having problem when we tried to extend into next room few months later. The particular color of hardwood was discontinued in Costco, and it was really hard to find a color match. Also, the individual boxes had a great variation in color.
This should be less of an issue with laminate, but still something to think about. Costco tends to rotate their stock, and particular color/widths might come and go unannounced.

order direct from manufacturer of the flooring,,,,, but I decided to stain my own to match with solid oak trim from a local supply store which sells a bigger selection then a home depot. It matched perfectly with the stain as well. andrewsiv9 Aug 11th, 2010, 09:27 AM a few pages back it was mentioned that the fall coupon book comes out in august and that will tell us if the laminate goes on sale anytime soon.

Would there be any benefit to using extra foam underlay?

At minimum, you need a 6 mil (not mm) poly as a vapour-barier. For my part, I highly recommend putting a sub-floor like delta-fl. It comes down to about 0.50 per square feet. It helps keep the floor warmer, and acts as a vapour-barier. I did this in mine, and didn&apos;t regret it a second.

If you go this way, you might consider puthing some sort of cloth, like a landscaping fabric under the delta-fl, because it tends to&quot;clicks&quot;on the concrete on non-even areas. starvx Sep 10th, 2010, 03:06 PM Do you lose much ceiling height with the delta-fl? Also does that act as the vapour barier, if I can tape the seams?

it&apos;s about half an inch thick. So with the floor, the total is about one inch flat. Even if it&apos;s the summer, I can notice the difference with my feet. jjasond Sep 10th, 2010, 09:58 PM I am planning on using this flooring in my basement, but am not planning on installing a subfloor.

Just wanted to confirm.

Would there be any benefit to using extra foam underlay?

I did mine with vapour barrier, as well as foam underlay, no subfloor. The reason for the underlay is that the floor is a but uneven (there is old vinyl tile in some places that I didn&apos;t take up) and I wanted something to absorb the changes in floor level. I recognize that this may not be the &apos;best&apos; way to deal with this, but it was the simplest. If your floor is really flat, I see no reason for underlay, although it would provide a small degree of insulation and may keep the floor warmer. I have not had a warmth problem with mine, but I don&apos;t spend much time down there with bare feet.

You can by an underlay with built in vapour barrier for ~$1 / sq. ft. at HD. Without vapour barrier, you can get underlay for $0.25/sq. ft. and lay it overtop of a poly vapour barrier which costs almost nothing per square foot.

If I were you, I would look into the Delta FL product the other poster mentioned though. I know nothing about it, but if it is only .5/ft^2, acts a a vapour barrier, and keeps the floor warmer, it may be worth it. chris647 Sep 11th, 2010, 09:04 PM Picked up 35 boxes for my basement.

- Very thick
- Underpad really quickens the installation
- Thickness can cause problems going from one room to another as it&apos;s much thicker than most other brands
- It&apos;s very scratch resistant but it&apos;s not impact resistant. I&apos;ve dropped stuff(metal) and chipped it a few times. This compared to some Dupont RealTouch flooring from Home Depot (Faus makes it) that is just awesome(dropped hammers on that stuff without any damage)...

LIP Lucky 13 Sep 19th, 2010, 11:08 AM Thanks for the quick reply.

Im not planning a big renovation. My main goal was just to replace the old carpet. This Costco sale on the Golden select flooring was perfect timing.

I was just a bit concerned about the possibility of cold floor from the switch from carpet to flooring. So was thinking about adding some extra insulation. After reading all the threads about people using delta, i thought maybe i should also.

So instead of using delta ms, I could use some tar paper on the plywood and start installing flooring?

Hi Shwinn,

We want to replace our old carpet in our upstairs. We think our situation is some what like yours. Did you use the tar paper to eliminate noises and coldness? What is your result? We just bought 45 boxes of the Mountain Oak colour for our living room, hallway, and 3 bedrooms. This is our first time with laminate product. We would appreciate any feed back of using tar paper instead of the other insulation. CSK&apos;sMom Sep 19th, 2010, 11:41 AM Hi Shwinn,

You&apos;re doing an above grade installation you don&apos;t need anything else other than the underlay that is already on the boards. Because this product is thick and HDF core, noise transfer isn&apos;t an issue like cheap laminates. BTW, tar paper won&apos;t eliminate noise transfer for any flooring product and has absolutely no insulation features either. ;) Break open a box and read (and re-read) the installation instructions before starting. entilza Sep 19th, 2010, 01:38 PM How do you install this type of flooring around staircase rails like in the upstairs hallway for example?

It depends on how&quot;handy&quot;you are. There are a couple of ways to handle the situation, depending on your existing railing setup and ultimately how handy you are. It would also ultimately be the time to change to something like wrought iron spindles if that is something you&apos;re interested in doing at some point... entilza Sep 23rd, 2010, 09:51 AM The back of the panel with the padding smell is quite strong, after installation is this smell noticeable?

I have the same issue. Did you buy the Walnut laminate? It takes about 5-6 weeks to get that strong smell out its pretty bad.

You can absolutely change a piece if need. The old laminate that was glued you couldn&apos;t but you definitely can with this or any other&quot;click&quot;laminates. We actually took a good 10 feet of ours out earlier this year to build an angled fireplace wall to mount our tv on and a window seat with storage.

Your cracking noise is probably one of a couple of things. This is the time of year when the most expansion and contraction happens. You may be slightly buckled if you&apos;re too tight to the wall or door frame if you didn&apos;t follow the gap specs (I know a lot here didn&apos;t as they didn&apos;t want use quarter round, thought it was excessive, etc.). You could hear a cracking noise if you installed over a sag in the subfloor as well that was more than the specs allow as well.

I&apos;m working my my way down the basement, but eventually I am going to reach a doorway on the left or right hand side. I can lay the floor into these rooms, but how would I work my way back up the floor? I would have to install backwards?

It&apos;s hard to explain, but pretend you had a layout shaped like a large S and you are laying the floor so it is orientated vertically. No matter where you start you will eventually have to&quot;work backwards&quot;, unless you do some incredibly accurate measurements. pepper3245 Nov 1st, 2010, 05:01 PM Has anyone successfully install this product on a concrete floor that is heated by an underfloor hot water system and were there any problems?

Did mine with radiant (electrical) heating. It was concrete floor&gt;cables&gt;thinset/self levelling concrete (hint do all the pouring in one sitting)&gt;6 mils poly&gt;laminate.

I was afraid the laminate would be too thick for the heat to pass through but we could feel the heated floors when set to 22C (wait for 3-4 hours though).

Don&apos;t screw down the transition pieces - use liquid nails on the piece itself rather than using the metal rail. Lost Monkey Nov 2nd, 2010, 10:05 AM Finally at the stage of installing this in my basement. I have a question about installing it.

You should start from the furthest point (which sounds like it would be the back wall of the room with the doorway on the left) and do some incredibly accurate measurements - or install a transition piece at the doorway on the left.

I have a really long room with a 12 foot piece that juts out at the far end. I didn&apos;t want to rip boards all the way down the long wall so I laid out one row of the floor down the wall to where it juts out and then built a single row of planks back to the back wall - this allowed me to get an accurate measurement of what size to rip my starting boards to and then I just started laying it down - when I got to the long wall it matched up really nicely, so I was able to continue from the beginning of the long wall.

It was thicker (over 15mm) and had a 30year warranty vs. the 25yr. All the other specs looked the same as was the price. I would&apos;ve went for it except I&apos;m installing this in my basement and want to keep it bright. Anyone familiar with this product?

Is there some wy to replace a damaged section in the middle of a room without ripping up the whole floor?
Thanks! CSK&apos;sMom Nov 27th, 2010, 12:24 PM Is there some wy to replace a damaged section in the middle of a room without ripping up the whole floor?
Thanks!

Nope. I know it sounds daunting to take it out to replace a piece but it&apos;s really not. All your cuts are done so it&apos;s really a pretty quick process. Take off the quarter round and start taking it out, row by row and pile it in rows in order. By doing that you save yourself the headache of looking for the right cuts when putting it back in... mork Nov 27th, 2010, 12:42 PM Is there some wy to replace a damaged section in the middle of a room without ripping up the whole floor?
Thanks!

Alternatively, you can cut the damaged piece down its center, being careful not to cut the adjacent pieces (something like a dremel would be a good tool to use) and pop it out. You won&apos;t be able to properly lock in the replacement piece on all 4 sides.. you&apos;ll need to cut the tongue off of two sides of it (can be easily cut with a knife).

When putting it in, it also won&apos;t stay put since you had to remove the interlocking tongue from it.. so you&apos;ll need to glue it. You could glue its edges to its neighbors or glue it down to the subfloor (but since all other pieces are&quot;floating&quot;, it could be an issue). Probably need to put some weight on it until the glue dries. If it isn&apos;t staying put, you could put a couple of small finishing nails through it and fill the nail holes with a matching filler and you&apos;d never know.

I haven&apos;t done this with the golden select, but I did it with a different laminate floor a few years ago and it worked perfectly. It might be worth a shot before you undo the entire floor (which is the ideal solution). mork Nov 27th, 2010, 12:48 PM Here&apos;s a video animation demonstrating a process similar to what I described above.

Looks pretty nice. I can&apos;t wait to be at that stage with my basement. Still a few months away from putting the floor down so hopefully I see a deal before then.

I notice you have the darker of the 3 colours costco offers. I like that one but am thinking of the middle one based on seeing dark laminate at a friend&apos;s place. I found it really showed smudges. It may have been that he had a glossy finish. I worry it would show dirt/scratches etc more than a lighter colour.

What has your experience been?

Also, last time I was in costco, I noticed they have a dark brown that is a little thicker and has a 30yr vs 25yr warranty. I am leaning towards the darker one but need some convincing that it won&apos;t look all smudgy. Fr0sty Dec 28th, 2010, 01:31 AM Looks pretty nice.

I know how u feel - took me 3 months of evenings to get my basement where it is right now (and a few months to go till it&apos;s set up the way I pictured).

I may have gone with a lighter color if I didnt have darker hardwood throughout the rest of our house - I wanted to have some semblance of flow in colors. The flooring does in fact show smudges and dust more than a lighter color would - but it&apos;s really not that bad of a &apos;problem&apos;.

A true test of durability.

Transition pieces I found to expensive and went to specialty shop and bought Oak pieces that I needed and sanded and stained to match with 4 coats of gloss urethene.;) couturegirl Jan 6th, 2011, 01:48 AM I need to pick up a ton of this flooring when it goes on sale but I am only in love with the walnut colour and the sale states it will only have 3 colours available.

Does anyone know if the colour code for walnut is 310365?

Thanks so much! mallorymoon Jan 8th, 2011, 02:50 PM Just bought 2500 sq ft of Golden Select Walnut laminate from Sams Club. About 1/2 will be installed downstairs on concrete subfloor and 1/2 upstairs on wood subfloor. What are the best underlayments for each? My main concern is noise. I hate the sound that laminates make. If I just put down a cheap 6 mil vapor barrier will the floor sound like wood or will it clack like laminate? It also seems to me that putting plastic underneath it will prevent any spilled liquids from being able to drain anywhere. Seems like something like tar paper would at least absorb some of the liquid. I&apos;ve seen some floor mufflers, but they are .50-.70 per sq foot so I&apos;ll be looking at about $1700 extra dollars on this project that I don&apos;t want to spend if it is not needed.


Also, I bought some laminate t molding that matches, but the leg of the T seems to be too short (about 3/8 in deep) so it will not reach the subfloor since this floor is so thick. how should I install it? That would be a pretty tall bead of liquid nails.

About how much is the shipping on the molding from JSonic. I have not been able to get a reply from them, and you have to put your credit card number in before it will tell you during check out.

Thanks, Nikki dealsdeamon Feb 3rd, 2011, 09:03 PM First post after having followed this thread for a few months now. We&apos;re about to invest in some Golden Select laminate from Costco and were curious if anyone had any installed pictures of the Brazilian Walnut. My wife is concerned with the texture (actual tactile feel) of the laminate making it look and feel like plastic. Anyone have anything the can add or share about the flooring feeling/looking plasticy?

DD Chasem Feb 19th, 2011, 02:27 PM Looks like Costco is out or running in short supply of this particular brand of laminate. I asked if they could order some more, but the service people say they won&apos;t being do so.

Seems strange that they that won&apos;t. We were at their stores just a month ago and they seemed to have ample supply of each variety. It&apos;s mostly gone now, and I presume it was sold. It would only make sense to order more. jpatel1984 Feb 23rd, 2011, 02:13 PM Is golden select the same as GEF?
This stuff is $2/sqft.

The new Brazilian Walnut is too dark. Checked two Costco stores today and asked them to check the system - not much out there in Walnut colour.

Does anyone know how often they get new shippments? Also, is March 7-20 sale confirmed? jjzzbb Mar 5th, 2011, 10:04 PM My basement is not ready for the flooring yet but maybe very soon. Anyone knows when the next sale will be on? If it will be in the next 2-3 months, I might can wait until then. couturegirl Mar 5th, 2011, 10:16 PM I just asked at my local costco and the only colours that are on sale according to the coupon are the Brazillian Walnut, Black Oak and Mountain Oak. I&apos;m also looking for the Walnut but it seems to be gone from Costco for now :( canadianexpress Mar 7th, 2011, 12:54 AM I was looking for the walnut colourl for my basement. This is not good if they are not getting anymore. dealsdeamon Mar 7th, 2011, 11:07 PM I just picked up a couple of boxes of the Brazilian Walnut to do a test to see if my wife will like it. Will need to go back and pickup 11 more boxes if all goes well. $7 off right now brings the price down to $32.99 for 23sq/ft.

I read in another post (see below)e that the transitions from jsonic were not as advertised. Anyone have a different experience?

DD



I ordered these transition strips and had to send them back. They were cheap looking and the dimensions didn&apos;t match the ones listed in the diagram. As near as I could tell, they were for a much thinner laminate flooring.

In fairness to J Sonic, they took them back no problem, and even paid for shipping both ways.

Ended up buying real wood transition strips from Rona that were a perfect match. Calman45 Mar 12th, 2011, 07:37 PM We grabbed 32 boxes of the Golden Select (Sunset Oak or whatever it&apos;s called) Laminate from Costco this morning. Looks really good, but on opening up a box and examining a couple of planks, one looked a little rough, with minor chips on the lipped edge (now a little worried ... hoping this is simply a BAD PLANK?)

someone else previously was having similar issues and it turned out they were installing it backwards. I&apos;m 50% done and not having many issues at all, just around my cuts/angles. Make sure you&apos;ve got the tongue end facing the starting wall.

DD EugW Mar 18th, 2011, 08:26 AM Nice pix and good prices. I went with engineered hardwood (9-layer), but at considerably more expense. At $1.50-1.75 per square foot that laminate flooring seems like a steal. Yeah, some of you are gonna get pee damage, etc., but then again if you&apos;re saving that much money on the initial expense it&apos;s hard to complain. Most of the&lt;$2 flooring I&apos;ve seen in the big box stores is absolute crap - 8 mm stuff that&apos;s as soft as butter. Judging by the descriptions, this flooring is light years better. However, could someone post a closeup of the flooring, including the sides?

Also, while I&apos;m not too surprised at the pee damage or the damage by sharp objects in falls from height, what does concern me is the fade resistance. My GF had good quality laminate installed in her condo and I would have expected the same water/pee damage and did see similar chipping as described, even though she paid much more for her flooring (years ago). However, what she didn&apos;t get was any fading even in direct sun. I see some people here saying the flooring fades quickly, but are other people (with significant sun hitting the floor) seeing this too? b0xy Mar 18th, 2011, 01:15 PM Costco Mississauga seemed to have run out of the 14mm thick laminate on sale for $29.99 but they&apos;ve replaced it with a 15.3mm thick (same thickness as the brazilian walnut)&quot;hand scraped&quot;sunset oak laminate for the same price. Boxes are 19sqft each (versus the ~22 of the brazilian walnut) and seem to only contain one length of board. I picked up 11 boxes for a small reflooring project, half the skid was gone by the time I left. jonnyyaa Mar 18th, 2011, 02:43 PM how is the quality of the 15.3mm stuff vs. the 14mm? can anyone comment on that? b0xy Mar 18th, 2011, 08:53 PM From what I could tell just by looking at the boxes and samples:

I didn&apos;t see&quot;hand scraped&quot;on the 14mm stuff (whatever that means)
14mm seems to be the same with regards to hardness/scratch resistance/material. waterbottle1234 Mar 18th, 2011, 10:32 PM i was at the markham costco today and they had maybe around 20 boxes of walnut left! EXCEPT of course walnut is the only colour not included in the $7 off :( so it is still $39.99 per box. it`s too bad because i liked the walnut colour the best. the other colours -brazillian walnut (really dark brown), sunset oak (reddish brown), and black oak (kind of yellowy and black) - had the $7 off and there were lots left.

and now i&apos;m contemplating going back for the braazillian walnut or sunset oak... napoleon1769 Mar 21st, 2011, 12:59 AM Ok, I just bought a skid and a half of this. What do I need to install this? Does it come with a video in the box?

You could get a kit from home depot that will help. Rubber mallet, spacer for the wall, and tapping block.
Otherwise, a circular/sliding mitre saw and jigsaw are necessities as well, imo.
Yep, you could install right over subfloor and it has the foam backing included. johnsmithy Mar 21st, 2011, 04:22 PM Just a recommendation. If you plan to install a large area of laminate, I would highly suggest renting a laminate shear from Home Depot. Get the one shaped like a&quot;T&quot;, not the one shaped like a paper cutter. It will make cross cuts so much easier, faster and cleaner (zero saw dust, just a little bit of chipping) than using a mitre saw (especially after the blade starts to dull). It only does 90 and 45 angles cuts but those should make up 90% of the cutting anyway. Will save on buying new saw blades too. You&apos;ll still need a jig saw for the little cuts around corners, etc.

Just my 2cents. tealab Mar 22nd, 2011, 12:04 AM I&apos;d been eying up the Golden Select laminate in stores at Costco after reading the positive reviews online. The price couldn&apos;t be beat, but I wasn&apos;t thrilled about the colour choices (walnut/mountain oak). However, I was thrilled when my local costco started carrying the Brazilian walnut colour. The recent coupon for $7 off literally came out the day I closed on my new condo, so I took the opportunity to rip out the old dingy carpets.

I haven&apos;t lived on it yet to try it out - but I LOVE the look of it. It&apos;s still a tad dusty, but you get the idea!

This looks great - thanks for the pictures Chelelynn Mar 30th, 2011, 11:14 AM High end laminate is like lipstick on a pig. No matter how much you pay for laminate it&apos;s still laminate. To many people - anybody with taste - laminate is always going to be a lowend flooring.

How many real estate listings promote laminate flooring?&quot;Look honey this house has wall to wall laminate!&quot;Wow.

The cheapest hardwood beats the most expensive laminate any day.

Don&apos;t you mean you take the money out of the sellers pocket in order to have a quicker sale? How much do you subtract for worn carpet?.....scratched hardwood?....chipped or cracked ceramic?

Oh well, I&apos;m installing the Golden Select product as I write this and I think it looks great but the only thing I would suggest to anyone installing this is to start with the tongue on the long side of the plank against the wall and go right to left with the&quot;groove&quot;or cut side on the end against the wall. The instructions say to go left to right but you have to lift you previously placed piece to get the next piece in......just a suggestion but it makes it MUCH easier to install!! mgs157 Apr 5th, 2011, 09:31 AM Don&apos;t you mean you take the money out of the sellers pocket in order to have a quicker sale?

You must not sell very many houses lol. Laminate nowadays can be very nice and very closely mimic hardwood. Laminate also has it&apos;s advantages when it comes to installation and resistance against scratching. tealab Apr 11th, 2011, 12:44 PM I don&apos;t really buy that putting in laminate lowers the value of a property. Our condo would show a million times better with our new laminate than it did with the dingy white carpet it had when we purchased it. Either way, we didn&apos;t put it in solely for resale purposes. We just bought the place and wanted hardsurface flooring that wouldn&apos;t scratch/dent easily.

Anyways, many of the other properties we were looking at advertised new &apos;hard surface flooring&apos;. While we weren&apos;t look&quot;Yippee it has laminate, how exciting!!!!&quot;, it looked very nice in some of the places and we definitely wouldn&apos;t have changed it out.

Typically the $7.00 off coupon has come out in March and September. I did inquire at the desk (London) when getting a price adjustment for purchase made a few weeks before coupon was valid if that was to be the case again this year, and although the girl at the customer service desk said she was not supposed to inform anyone of when the coupons would be back, she did indicate that I was correct in assuming they would return in September. parmcat Apr 13th, 2011, 02:32 PM Hello,

Indeed. I myself prefer hardwood, but good laminate most definitely can look very good, and can have advantages over hardwood.

Even though I&apos;m a person with a whole house full of hardwood - solid on the main and top floors and engineered in the basement, I&apos;d consider buying a home or a condo with laminate. My GF&apos;s condo was (good) laminate and it looked very nice, and it was considered a positive selling point for the place. Slashbub Apr 16th, 2011, 07:43 AM Hello,

Cheers, MelanieLily Apr 16th, 2011, 08:13 PM We had Golden Select Brazilian Walnut (the dark one) installed in our house last week. We had contractors in as we do not have any installation skills to speak of. The contractor says that he loves the product at Costco because it is thick and the backing takes away a step from installation. We did our hallway, two sets of stairs, livingroom, kitchen, diningroom and three bedrooms. The steps were done with oak nosing purchased at windsor plywood and stained to match the laminate, went to Fancy Flooring and purchased beautiful wide pre-primed baseboards for .50 cents a li ft. and painted them bright white...they look stunning in contrast with the dark flooring, we also purchased lovely brushed steel vent covers for $12.00/2 vents at costco. It looks absolutely fantastic!! Of course the first thing we did was put the flooring to the test. I was washing our new tile in the bathroom and my husband kicked over my water bucket...onto our brand new laminate. We immediately and thoroughly mopped up the spill....laminate would normally become warped due to this....but ours was no problem...wiped it up ...dry...good as new. It is relatively cushy for laminate, due to the backing...and simple to clean. As with any laminate, be certain to use just water and maybe a little vinegar with a damp mop...no soaking wet mops. It stays shiny and is a fantastic alternative for anyone with allergies. :):):):) We&apos;ve had tons of compliments on it too!! dealsdeamon Apr 16th, 2011, 08:53 PM We had Golden Select Brazilian Walnut (the dark one) installed in our house last week.

Hi Melanie/Anyone from edmonton area ,
Just wondering if you purchased this product directly from an Edmonton costco or if the contractor priced out and purchased it himself? I&apos;m seeing on here that this product has been $7 off per box but I&apos;m not sure if we missed the edmonton sale on this product already for this year? Please advise if you have any information thanks! I also see costco here has the brazilian walnut which looks beautiful and another colour no one seems to mention sunset oak but beyond that I didn&apos;t see other colours. KayBee01 Apr 17th, 2011, 11:53 AM Does anyone know if this flooring is available at Costco in St.Catharines, Ontario? Slashbub Apr 18th, 2011, 07:50 AM Does anyone know if this flooring is available at Costco in St.Catharines, Ontario?

Yes that is where we purchased it about a month ago while they had them at $7 off per box. I was just there this past weekend and it is still there at 35.99 per box. You have to be careful though.......Golden Select makes several different colours and the square footage may be different per box and more importantly the thickness (including the attached underpad) may be different. We were told by some flooring experts to try and go with at least 1/2&quot;flooring for best performance.......we chose the Black Oak leonkaz May 5th, 2011, 08:16 PM Thank you all for sharing your experience here. I stumbled upon this thread just as I was thinking about finishing part of the basement.
Well, today I finished laying down the laminate in the room I built.
Here&apos;s my 2 cents. I was cursing it at first and recalling some posts saying it was very hard to lay down to click.
My basement floor is reasonably even, I haven&apos;t measured, but I think it&apos;s within 1/4&quot;as stated in the instructions.
Let&apos;s say I assembled my walls on the floor and they&apos;re reasonably flat and even.
Also, I had landscaping fabric and Delta-FL under the planks.
Long story short, 2/3 through the job I got tired and desperate and started wacking the planks in place hardwood installer style - I grabbed short piece of laminate, put it on the plank I was installing and wacked it with 2x4 (I don&apos;t have a mallet). It went much faster and better :) I admit it&apos;s my first time installing laminate and perhaps others know how to do it better... but having read and followed the instructions, my method is better :twisted:

I think my colour is Black Oak.

I have the stair nosing as well and am not having any issues. Are you working on stairs that are completely boxed square before applying the laminate and nosing? Can you take a picture of what you&apos;re trying to describe?

Long story short, 2/3 through the job I got tired and desperate and started wacking the planks in place hardwood installer style - I grabbed short piece of laminate, put it on the plank I was installing and wacked it with 2x4 (I don&apos;t have a mallet). It went much faster and better :) I admit it&apos;s my first time installing laminate and perhaps others know how to do it better... but having read and followed the instructions, my method is better :twisted:

I think my colour is Black Oak.

Very nice. How is the noise when you walk on it? I am also going to do landscape fabric + delta-FL. Do you find the floor cold? leonkaz May 18th, 2011, 08:38 AM Very nice. How is the noise when you walk on it? I am also going to do landscape fabric + delta-FL. Do you find the floor cold?

no noise at all, I can feel couple low spots where the laminate flexes when I step on it
The floor is colder than upstairs, but not very cold
I find it quite satisfactory. The_dream2k May 24th, 2011, 12:19 PM Is this the best laminate for the money? I saw other laminate 12mm from quickstyle at around the same price per sqft. What makes it better? sluggy May 29th, 2011, 01:43 PM OK. I think I&apos;m at the point where I&apos;m deciding between this laminate or a cheap hardwood. I know that there are fans for both sides, but here is my situation. Hopefully I can get some opinions to make my decision easier.

I live in a house approximately 30 years old. Most of the house is hardwood except for the bedrooms which are a very dingy carpet. The bedrooms are small. In total, there are three that make up approximately between 300-400 sqft. No kids, no pets, but I use one room as an office/computer storage with parts and such.

My main goal is really to remove the carpet, fix the subfloor, and install some sort of flooring. I&apos;m almost even ready to go back to carpet if the prices for the other two are too ridiculous. Honestly, I&apos;ve been going between this thread and the hardwood thread changing my mind every so often. I&apos;m really stuck here.

Sorry if I hijacked this thread to talk about choices between this or hardwood since this is a golden select laminate flooring thread, but any suggestions would be appreciated. Please PM me if needed. jjzzbb Jun 6th, 2011, 01:27 PM So where I can find the molding for the color of Sunset Oak other than order it online which I heard it is not that good from this fourm. It has 15mm thickness and I tried the HD, Rona and a few loca flooring stores with no luck. dealsdeamon Jun 6th, 2011, 10:14 PM So where I can find the molding for the color of Sunset Oak other than order it online which I heard it is not that good from this fourm.

So what colour do you have? I decieded to order it online this afternoon and still waiting for the shipping quote. How long it take to ship to you after you confirm the order? dealsdeamon Jun 7th, 2011, 10:01 PM So what colour do you have?

I&apos;ve got the Brazilian Walnut. T Mouldings took about 2-3 weeks, stair nosings closer to 5 weeks

DD lavar Jun 7th, 2011, 10:11 PM I bought a few transitions for the black oak laminate I installed. I bought a reducer, t-molding, and stair nose. The colour match was good but I wasn&apos;t very impressed with the quality. wound up just using a little t-molding in one area (planned to use it in 3 spots) used the stair nosing and did not use the reducer at all. I found it easier and better to just buy unfinished oak moldings and transitions and staining those myself. Much stronger (especially for the stair nosing). jjzzbb Jun 7th, 2011, 11:52 PM I&apos;ve got the Brazilian Walnut. T Mouldings took about 2-3 weeks, stair nosings closer to 5 weeks

How come it take so long to ship it? They make it after you ordered it? Big Daddy G Jun 7th, 2011, 11:53 PM Lots of good info in this thread, thanks everyone.

Can anyone provide some pictures of installed floors with the Sunset Oak and/or the Black Oak colors? I&apos;m trying to decide between the two, even without the sale prices, still a pretty good deal. dealsdeamon Jun 8th, 2011, 06:53 AM How come it take so long to ship it?

they were out of stock on the nosing so were waiting to ship everything together. I was able to get them to split ship after a few emails back and forth.

Wow, that is exactly what I was looking for, thanks!

Looks very good by the way!

I bought a package of Black Oak and a package of Sunset Oak, and have been comparing the two at home. For whatever reason, the Sunset Oak has been chipping and leaving dents way worse then the Black Oak. Must have something to do with the two different finishes. I think the Sunset Oak is&quot;handscraped&quot;where the other one is not.

Any one else have any pictures to share or experiences with some of the newer colors of Golden Select? Mennonite Jun 18th, 2011, 11:02 PM I also bought the stairnose from jsonic but it doesn&apos;t seem to work properly with my stairs since they have an overhang that is thicker than what the stair nose covers. Any suggestions on how to make this work?

I&apos;ve been looking at the stair nose piece on the manufacturer&apos;s website (http://jsonic.ca/moldings/laminate/stair-nose-in-walnut-us) and wondering the same thing. I&apos;m putting laminate on concrete in my basement, and I&apos;ve got a short run of stairs, only 5 or 6, which are your typical plain wooden stairs leading to the basement, but they all have noses / overhang. It seems like those pieces would only work on stairs without noses, which have simple 90 degree angle edges.

I&apos;m not seeing much discussion of stairs in this thread. What are people generally doing about stairs? I&apos;m torn between just copping out and sanding and painting the stairs, or trying to do laminate, if I can figure out how.

You have to cut the noses off the stairs when installing laminate or wood. Be forewarned though, laminate on stairs, even this stuff, can be slippery. Personally I find wood on stairs too slippery as well. Maybe paint and a runner if you don&apos;t choose to do laminate...

Very interesting, thanks for the info. Go through all the work of cutting the noses off only to end up with slippery laminate&apos;d stairs that I&apos;d probably have to cover with a runner anyways?! Nah... paint it is I guess. Jaremy T Jun 20th, 2011, 04:45 PM I saw these at Windsor Plywood the other day while looking at transitions (which are $4/lf and can be cut longer than 6ft btw).

Price in Regina started at $39.99. parmcat Jun 23rd, 2011, 09:04 AM Just unstalled this in the bedrooms and hallway upstairs. My installer had a few things to say about it.

First, the look is fantastic. The wide planks look awesome and the beveled edges really make it look like wood.

He did say that the&quot;click&quot;with this stuff is very subtle, almosy mushy. He did say some boxes clicked better the others, so be aware of that. As for the stairs, he said the noses are really not great quality. They are too small and there is a lot of weight on them, for the size they are. He would recommend something bigger snd then stain them to match.

I had my tranistions 10 days after I ordered them. Great service from Jsonic really.

Persian-Rice Jul 6th, 2011, 01:07 PM Does anyone know the IIC&amp;STC ratings for the 15.3 laminate floors? I saw the rating in this thread for the attached padding, but not the laminate itself.
I&apos;m having a very hard time getting an answer to this from jsonic. They don&apos;t answer the phone, and when they do, they don&apos;t get back to you as promised..... jaindough Jul 7th, 2011, 11:28 AM We just finished an install of the same product parmcat has posted. We replaced the carpet in our basement (it was right on the concrete floor), laid down a DriCore subfloor and then placed down the laminate on top of that.

We were having a heck of a time getting the boards to stay together at the beginning because we were being too gentle. After watching the install videos that someone posted we used the tapping block method and a not-too-shy tapping to get the boards to snug together nicely. We have yet to put up our new baseboards and quarter round to finish off the project, but we are really happy with the look and feel of the flooring.

The product itself seems to be quite durable to regular wear and tear and the cosmetic change to our den is very nice. watergirl73 Jul 7th, 2011, 06:21 PM Love the stairs they look great especially the back pannel on each step. We used the Tango and my husband did the stairs as well. It took a while since we also sanded and restained the hand rails from oak to a darker color. I love it. It turned out perfect. We were told $200.00 per step to get it done but since my husband is meticulous in everything he does it looks amazing. My father is a contractor and says it looks great for laminate. Thanks for sharing your pics. I posted one of ours although not the greatest close up it&apos;s all I have at the moment.
Well I tried to add a pic but the jpeg won&apos;t load and when I shrink it in paint its tiny and still says it exceeds... not sure why.. oh well.

How does this floor actually feel walking on it? Does it feel&quot;spongy&quot;? Right now, I am considering hardwood since that&apos;s what I have always had, but in the past, we had to refinish because of the scratching from the dog....and laminate would probably be the better choice for that reason alone.

Mine makes a tappy sound and creaks a lot. I installed it in a basement with a somewhat typically uneven floor. I am sure the creaking would be better if it were installed on a plywood sub-floor, but it would still be tappy sounding.

After installing this product - and I have installed 2 other similar products, I wouldn&apos;t buy it again. I find the quality is very inconsistent, even from the same box... I have pieces that have scratches from moving a couch with felt pads on the feet. Busfan Aug 4th, 2011, 09:00 PM We just finished installing about 250 sq ft of the Sunset Oak laminate in our basement. So, thought I would share our experiences:

1) Those friggin boxes are heavy! After loading 13 of those suckers into the van and hauling them down to the basement I was ready for the physiotherapist!

2) Unlike other laminate, the sunset oak comes in 4 ft planks roughly 6 3/8 inches wide. They are also 15.3 mm deep including an attached foam cushion layer.

3) Unlike other thinner and narrower laminate, this stuff does not simply click together. Be prepared to use two people with rubber mallets and wood blocks. Shall we say it involves a little more than just&quot;tapping&quot;:)

4) Our basement is partly finished so, following the advice in the instructions and everywhere else in the web, we started against the longest wall using spacers. Unfortunately, there are a couple of jogs in and out along the wall for columns and etc., and, there is an opening to a hallway. Trying to start a row against this wall was a total exercise in frustration, but we finally managed to get three rows down before quitting for the day.

Tip: Measure your dimensions and start the first two or three rows away from the wall, in the middle of the floor, then slide it in. The success of adding further rows depends on having a solid three or more initial rows to connect to.

5) Once the&quot;foundation&quot;rows were in place, the boards went down fairly smoothly (not easy, but smoothly). These are large planks with high precision joints that rely on laser accurate alignment. Save yourself a lot of grief. If there is any type of gap between the existing row and the board you just laid, (if you can feel it with your nail) pull the board up and reinstall it.

TIP: We found a good technique whereby we banged (I mean tapped;) ) a board into place a few inches away from the narrow end of the last board. Once we were satisfied that we had a good joint lengthwise, we tapped it backwards until the small sides joined up. From here on in, it went quite well.

6) I used a jig saw exclusively for cutting around obstacles and etc. Wear a mask and eye protection and be prepared for lots of fine dust.


7) Once all the boards were in, we did discover a couple of areas where it would deflect slightly (uneven bsmt floor), but nothing intolerable.

8) After reading this thread, we tried to find transitions at HD or Lowes, but they do not carry anything made for 15.3 mm thick planks. I decided to bite the bullet and order reducer transitions from Jsonic. I placed the order on Sunday and received an email on Monday with shipping charges and requesting confirmation. The email said to expect delivery in 1 to 3 weeks. Well, I was shocked when I came home on Tuesday and found them delivered (in less than 24 hours!)

One thing to note, if the board is viewed at a certain angle, you can see machine grooves that run the length of the board, beneath the surface finish. It does have a very slight cushion feel due to the foam pad and a few creaks here and there, but in general, we are happy with the overall appearance and quality of the floor and would recommend buying it. jmfish Aug 11th, 2011, 12:42 PM We are installing the same floor (Sunset Oak - handscratched) throughout the upper level of our new house, and I found this site to see if anyone else was having a similar problem. My husband has installed a number of different laminates before and this floor has kind of taken him for a loop. It&apos;s been days and there are only about 3 rows of flooring down. The tongue&amp;groove system just doesn’t seem to work that well – pieces are popping every time we lay another piece, which brings us back to square one. There were some very minor bumps in the floor which wouldn’t normally cause for concern with other laminates, and we went through the trouble of doing a floor leveling to see of it would make the installation easier, and no luck. We have thought about bringing it back, but it&apos;s not that appealing to load up the 45 (very heavy) boxes and try to find another floor that matches all of the 11 oak stairs, bull-nosing, and railings that I have stained myself to match this floor. Reading through some of the old posts in this forum when I get home I am going to make sure we are not laying them backwards, but I am almost certain we have started exactly how has been recommended. We have many tapping blocks, and rubber mallets and lots of manpower, this floor just doesn’t seem to want to lay seamlessly. It’s getting to be pretty frustrating, and disappointing. On a positive note, we absolutely love how the floor looks cosmetically.

http://jsonic.ca/instal_video.htm mgs157 Aug 12th, 2011, 11:20 AM Could you take some pictures and show us how you are installing it? kellyjmason Aug 12th, 2011, 12:39 PM I installed 900 sq ft of this on the main level of my house, and it went perfectly. I layed down a layer of 5/16&quot;proboard first(pl and screws, then the laminate. I found the odd piece that seemed irregular, but I bought all mine from a truck rollover auction and only paid $1/ft, so I&apos;m not complaining. The only trick I found is that if a piece did not tap in easily, I would slide it back and forth a few times while at a slight angle (about 20 deg.), and this would seem to help it lock in after. It is solid, and does not slap or feel cheap in any way. I also did 1000 sq ft in the basement, directly onto the cement pad, and it is fine, but there are one or two spots where there are some irregularities in the cement, and you can feel it when you walk on the floor, but it is minor. If I was to do it again I would most likely put down some sort of sub floor (dricore?). A friend did his basement and did not follow the recomended end spacing, and in the spring when the humidity climbed up to 80-90% the floor expanded and heaved in one hallway. I installed mine when it was -40 out(flooring was stored in an unheated garage) with humidity of&gt;10%, and then through spring and summer with humidity of&lt;90% and temps up to +35c and there has been zero problems, but I did follow the end gap recomendations. I have 4 big dogs (a Dane and 3 greyhounds) who destroyed the engineered wood that was in the house in months, this stuff is way more durable, but like all laminate, can be damaged by heavy impacts or deep scratches. I would buy it again. Lauralai Aug 19th, 2011, 10:16 PM Does anyone happen to know when this will go on sale again? lavar Aug 20th, 2011, 06:53 PM should be september, it has followed a march and september schedule the last couple years I believe. capitainefritz Aug 20th, 2011, 07:42 PM Just installed 400sqft in my basement, on top of Subflor tiles (Rona Dricore). Install was very smooth. Couple of hours only to complete everything.

Very happy :) ginger2 Aug 29th, 2011, 05:29 PM HI - I am just wondering if you finished your project. I have almost 800sq feet to cover and my contractor is getting very frustrated with the Sunset Oak laminate. I love the way it looks, but after one day they have only completed five rows in my bedroom. As previously mentioned, they said that the product is a very tight fit and that once they get a row done, they often have to start over because a seam&quot;pops up&quot;. Is this product worth the trouble? Do you or does anyone else that has purchased this product have any other installation tips?



We are installing the same floor (Sunset Oak - handscratched) throughout the upper level of our new house, and I found this site to see if anyone else was having a similar problem. My husband has installed a number of different laminates before and this floor has kind of taken him for a loop. It&apos;s been days and there are only about 3 rows of flooring down. The tongue&amp;groove system just doesn’t seem to work that well – pieces are popping every time we lay another piece, which brings us back to square one. There were some very minor bumps in the floor which wouldn’t normally cause for concern with other laminates, and we went through the trouble of doing a floor leveling to see of it would make the installation easier, and no luck. We have thought about bringing it back, but it&apos;s not that appealing to load up the 45 (very heavy) boxes and try to find another floor that matches all of the 11 oak stairs, bull-nosing, and railings that I have stained myself to match this floor. Reading through some of the old posts in this forum when I get home I am going to make sure we are not laying them backwards, but I am almost certain we have started exactly how has been recommended. We have many tapping blocks, and rubber mallets and lots of manpower, this floor just doesn’t seem to want to lay seamlessly. It’s getting to be pretty frustrating, and disappointing. On a positive note, we absolutely love how the floor looks cosmetically. 9999 Aug 30th, 2011, 11:38 AM I only need a small area covered about 10x10 in the basement. Do I need a rubber mallet or can I just use my hands, sliding back and forth if needed to click it in? Lauralai Sep 7th, 2011, 11:33 PM Has anyone gone over to the states to SAMs club to get the walnut colour? It is a fair bit cheaper at $27 a box and a nice colour. I know I would have to pay 13% if I did get stopped at the border ( more than likely with such a high $ for a lot of boxes) but it still seems like not a bad deal. I&apos;m waiting for it to come on sale here if not, I heard that it goes on in sept.


Also on the jsonic website they have cottage oak. Is that a new colour? I don&apos;t recall seeing it at costco.
Thanks Lauralai Sep 8th, 2011, 06:51 PM FYI, I went to costco tonight and it&apos;s on sale for $7 off. Looks like I will be putting the Brazilian Walnut on my main floor. Rednose Sep 9th, 2011, 09:46 AM FYI, I went to costco tonight and it&apos;s on sale for $7 off. Looks like I will be putting the Brazilian Walnut on my main floor.
Thanks for the head up. I&apos;m in Ottawa, and was looking into it yesterday, it&apos;s not on sale. Is $38.99 regular price for the Brazilian Walnut? Anyone know? Thanks in advance. MbMike Sep 9th, 2011, 02:28 PM I can confirm that the Black Oak and the Brazilian Walnut are both on sale ($7 off) in Winnipeg (St. James).

Black Oak - $27.99 (I Think)

Brazilian Walnut - $30.99 (purchased 44 cases) gstylez Sep 9th, 2011, 09:34 PM went tonight and got 15 boxes, im short another 20 but they were out on the floor
it said sale was good till sept 25 im hoping that they have more in stock:confused: kikipebbles Sep 9th, 2011, 11:54 PM Costco Kanata has black oak and brazillian walnut at 7$ off. Anyone know a location with lighter colors? Big Daddy G Sep 10th, 2011, 06:12 PM Been watching this thread for a few months now, glad I waited as I saved 126 bucks today when I bought 18 boxes of the Black Oak from the NW Calgary location.

A while ago, I had bought one each of the Sunset Oak and Black Oak and brought them home to do some testing. I brought out one board of each and dropped random objects from different heights. For whatever reason, the Black Oak stood much better then the Sunset Oak, even though the Sunset was my original preference.

Hopefully I can start getting them installed in the basement in the next few weeks, and then upload a few pics. Thanks to all in this thread, lots of great information. Crossing my fingers that the installation is a breeze. kikipebbles Sep 12th, 2011, 03:07 PM Has anyone seen the Sunset Oak color in the Ottawa area? Lauralai Sep 13th, 2011, 11:29 AM We installed some of this yesterday and my step dad knocked over some vinegar and water. He cleaned it up right away with a towel and thought nothing of it, well this morning the boards in the grooves are raised and bubbled. I guess he didn&apos;t get it out of the cracks. I knew laminate and water doesn&apos;t mix but this is horrible. Anyone else have an experience like this? It&apos;s the Brazilian walnut colour with the grooves would the sunset oak fair any better? LOVE the look of it but I&apos;m not keeping a floor that damages so easily.

Pretty normal for laminate of any kind, especially a bucket full of liquid. Hardwood, you&apos;d be seeing a huge black mark under the finish.... Lauralai Sep 13th, 2011, 11:58 AM Pretty normal for laminate of any kind, especially a bucket full of liquid. Hardwood, you&apos;d be seeing a huge black mark under the finish....
It wasn&apos;t a bucket though. It was about 1-2 cups and cleaned up almost instantly. I wonder if because it was freshly installed. As in installed earlier in the day maybe the joints weren&apos;t set, even though we tapped them all tight.


Edit...
Ok apparently it wasn&apos;t vinegar and water, my mother said it was wallpaper stripper and water. Can totally see why it got damaged now those chemicals aren&apos;t that nice.

Does anyone know if gluing the seams will make it more water resistant in the future. As we went looking at other floors today and we dont like anything as much as we like this.
Thanks retireat50 Sep 13th, 2011, 10:26 PM Finally ready to pick up some of the Black oak now that it is on sale. Just a couple questions. Are other people putting this on their main floor, or mainly basement projects? Mentioned I&apos;m doing his to a guy at work and he kind of snickered that i&apos;d be spending too little lol.

Also, I am terrible at DIY so will be paying someone to rip out my existing laminate and carpet (it&apos;s about 50/50), remove baseboards, level floor and then install floor. Any ideas what the cost per SF would be? I&apos;m thinking around $3.50 to $4 for all of that kryton619 Sep 13th, 2011, 10:27 PM I just finished installing 40 boxes of Sunset Oak at the cottage. If it does go on sale this month in Ontario....I plan on going in for a price adjustment. Can anyone confirm that it is on sale? BillyH Sep 15th, 2011, 09:12 PM It is. Confirmed Sunset Oak, Black Oak and the dark one (forget the name). $7 off each. capitainefritz Sep 15th, 2011, 09:16 PM Confirmed as well in Laval, $7 off laminate gstylez Sep 15th, 2011, 09:44 PM anyone know how much jsonic charges for shipping for mouldings BARTONd Sep 16th, 2011, 07:28 AM anyone know how much jsonic charges for shipping for mouldings
The shipping charges are $ 21.68 kha_ Sep 16th, 2011, 11:58 AM Can anyone confirm brazilian walnut is on sale?

Recently spent 2gs on the stuff and a price adjustment would go a long way! retireat50 Sep 17th, 2011, 08:22 PM I can confirm the brazilian walnut is on sale

What are you guys using to clean this flooring? tsat Sep 19th, 2011, 08:53 AM My 2 year old son must have been in-tune to the fact that this was on sale...After he woke up from his nap, he proceeded to play with a large container of Penaten diaper cream and smeared hand-fulls of it into the carpet in his room :-0

Carpet had to be replaced so i picked up some of this stuff, hopefully will have it done tonight. JohnF1444 Sep 19th, 2011, 08:15 PM I just picked up 15 boxes of Moka Walnut Golden Select laminate flooring from Costco in Laval. It was on sale last week. I contacted Jsonic (the distributor, who also happens to be close by in Montreal) inquiring on the moldings for this color. THEY DON&apos;T HAVE ANY!! Not just &apos;out of stock&apos; - they just don&apos;t have any made in that color!! :-0&gt;:( They offered me a 15.3 mm white MDF molding. That will ruin after a couple of days of stepping on it.

I went to my local HD, Rona&amp;Reno Depot but none carry a 15.3 thick transient or reducer molding. The thickest they have is only 12mm thick - too small for the Golden Select 15.3mm.
How can a company sell the floor but not the molding?? How can you install it without?

Does anyone know where I can get 15.3mm molding for this floor? I really like the laminate and the price was right. But I&apos;m ready to ship it all back to Costco if I can&apos;t get the molding. I don&apos;t see how I can properly install it without the molding. Spray Sep 19th, 2011, 08:21 PM So can you just put this directly on concrete in the basement? Or do you need plastic underneath it as well?

I see Bamboo is on sale for the same price as this...why go laminate over bamboo? Maculosa Sep 20th, 2011, 10:01 PM bamboo need to be nailed, so you need a false floor in your basement to install bamboo.

I&apos;m planning to get around 900-1000 feet sqare of black oak laminated floor, anyone can confirm if the distributor have the molding for this color?
Thanks. lavar Sep 22nd, 2011, 01:40 PM I installed about 700sqf in my home in May. Jsonic had all of the moldings available when I did this. (I did find however that they were of inferior quality and that I wound up using unfinished oak in many areas in place of the provided molding and just stained and sealed them myself).

Thanks. Maculosa Sep 22nd, 2011, 09:52 PM My house is build on a clay soil so my basement tend to be moist.
Someone told me to not use this kind of laminated flooring that costco sell (one with underlayment foam) that will be used as a vapor barrier and can cause moisture under the floor.
He tool me to use standard laminated flooring that do not have underlayment foam and use airguard prenimum underlayment that will make the floor to breath and avoid any future moisture problem.

Is that true? If so i can&apos;t use the costco flooring. :( pcboy Sep 23rd, 2011, 12:59 PM hi guys,

I brought 25 boxes of those laminate floors (28 ea), and plan to install them in the basement. I have a couple questions:

1. Do I have to put anything underneath given it already has the padding?
2. Is it recomended to put them in the basement? Our basement floor is concrete. Many thanks. tsat Sep 26th, 2011, 12:12 PM I got my sons room completed, finally...

I don&apos;t know what everyone else&apos;s experience has been but this was a total pain in the a$$ to put together. It started off fine, then after about 4 rows I couldn&apos;t get new pieces to click together... After messing around with the same pieces for hours i just opened a new box and it would start going together fine. This problem repeated itself, and i suspect it&apos;s a quality control issue from the manufacturer. Or my own retardation, who knows.

Don&apos;t get me wrong, the end result is very nice and i&apos;m very happy with it. But it shouldn&apos;t have taken me 3 days of laying it after work to put down 100 square feet.

And to everyone who keeps asking... If you&apos;re putting this down on concrete you need a vapor barrier underneath. Read the instructions, or this thread. What is on the back is not a vapor barrier, it&apos;s just foam to prevent squeaks and creaking. pcboy Sep 27th, 2011, 12:53 PM I got my sons room completed, finally...

this is also our experience.... So how did you made them to click eventually? I m thinking of returning it. Can somebody post a picture on the gap between each plank? teamkelly Oct 1st, 2011, 07:31 PM Those of you who have installed Sunset Oak - can you please comment of quality/durability/installation of this product? We are hoping to install approx 500 sq feet - including 14 stairs (walk-up house) and main floor and hallway. We have no pets - just toddlers! And our friend, a seasoned contractor will install. Your thoughts are appreciated before we purchase! cykelvin Oct 3rd, 2011, 02:53 AM Just curious, any of you have installed the Golden Select Laminate Floor in a condo? I know condo/apartment has strict restrictions on the underlay, just want to know if the pre-attached back foam thats included met the requirments or not. Thanks in advance. cykelvin Oct 5th, 2011, 04:43 PM Just curious, any of you have installed the Golden Select Laminate Floor in a condo?

I also read from an earlier post indicate the IIC rating for the back foam is 58 and 53 for STC rating. Just called j-sonic customer service, they told me it is a basic universal back foam that they used, there is no IIC or STC rating for it. I am not sure if thats accurate or not, can someone just confirm this? tsat Oct 6th, 2011, 10:12 AM this is also our experience.... So how did you made them to click eventually?

It basically took brute force to get them together, that and i got my wife to help put in a few planks, having a second person on the same board can help the process a lot. But i&apos;ve always found that if you&apos;re trying to do something and it&apos;s not working out for you, walk away for 20 minutes and come back. When i was having the problem with boards not going together i was getting so frustrated that i was ready to take every box outside and burn it. After taking a breather i came back and was able to get them to start going together, sometimes your own frustration is the problem.

After the fact i&apos;m pretty sure that i know what the problem was. In my sons room there&apos;s a slight dip in the sub-floor right before the floor vent and this is where i was having troubles. It just took enough screwing around to get it done... I&apos;m a stubborn person and wasn&apos;t going to let a piece of MDF win :cheesygri

There shouldn&apos;t be a gap between the planks, if there is they aren&apos;t completely together. When i get home i&apos;ll try to get a picture for you.

Last weekend i did the floor in my daughters room, and it took half the time and went together much easier probably because i knew what to expect and how to deal with the problems i had before.

Sunset oak is what i installed in my kids rooms. The top laminate layer is very durable and strong, where it&apos;s weak is at the edges but if it&apos;s installed right there should be no danger of chipping the laminate. That is unless you drop something heavy on it (like i did with a hammer claw&gt;:(). When i read some people&apos;s horror stories of pieces getting wrecked from water spillage i was a little worried. I purposely left some of my off-cuts out in the rain for 2 days and they didn&apos;t swell or anything so i&apos;m not too worried about it anymore. I have a chocolate lab and he was horsing around in my sons room last night, no scratches from him and my kids can be rough on floors as they&apos;ve already scratched my mainfloor hard-wood. But so far their rooms are still ok.

As for installation it can be a serious pain. If you don&apos;t do much DIY this may not be the right project for you since the planks can be stubborn to go together. I broke a couple groves just by being too rough on the boards when trying to force them together. But like i said just be persistent, take a break if you&apos;re getting frustrated Konowl Oct 6th, 2011, 07:29 PM For the life of me, I can&apos;t get the dark version of the flooring CLEAN at all.

You are absolutely right about walking away for 20min. My dad watched the video on golden select&apos;s website, and now it works perfectly. You basically have to use a 2nd piece to hammer them into the groove one by one.

I hammered every piece in to make sure everything was&quot;clicked&quot;together.. broke a few along the way, but they&apos;re cheap.. a cut piece for a block and a small rubber mallet and I cruised right along. Lauralai Oct 9th, 2011, 06:34 PM I ended up installing it on my main floor with the glue and then the second floor. Glued EVERY single plank. I know it&apos;s not recommended but I had no plans of ever taking it apart other than eventually replacing it. Our dogs have had a few accidents and spilt a little water and it hasn&apos;t damaged at all. Even a pet mess that wasn&apos;t cleaned up immediately was fine. I know it might not be that way forever but the glue has seemed to help a lot. I love the look of it and only have the stairs left. Just need to get the stair nose and trim pieces. retireat50 Oct 10th, 2011, 11:10 PM For the guy who has streaking on the dark floors. I just installed the same floor and use a Swiffer (the dry ones) with the stuff specifically made for wood/laminate floors. No streaking for me. These floors do get dirty easily but that is the case with all dark floors. For us the extra cleaning is worth it as it looks pretty sharp.

Anyone know how much shipping is on the touchup pen? Also is the touch up pen worth it? I haven&apos;t found any reviews on it at all. Fr0sty Oct 11th, 2011, 08:42 PM this is also our experience....

Are you guys sure you are following the instructions exactly? I had the same experience at first. Around the 4th or so row it became increasingly difficult to install. I re-read the instructions and found that I was starting at the wrong end. I took it all apart and started from the other end and it went together quite easy - I barely had to tap any in. (for the life of me, I can&apos;t remember if it was left to right or right to left - I installed 10 months ago, pics on page 28). tsat Oct 12th, 2011, 11:16 AM Are you guys sure you are following the instructions exactly?

It&apos;s left to right and yes i went over the instructions several times to try and figure out what the problem was. As far as I can tell i followed the instructions to the letter.

I had some pieces that went together like a dream, and others not so much... really hard to say gstylez Oct 12th, 2011, 11:24 AM I just finished installing about 800sqf didnt notice any difficulties like being mentioned here
only time i had to tap a bit harder was when theres a slight dip on the floor, what i did here was use the smaller board pieces. anyhow overall im happy with the product wished it was a bit more shinier. pv2298 Oct 13th, 2011, 12:25 PM We purchased the Golden Select laminate walnut to put in our basement a few months ago and forgot to get some transitions . The colour is now discontinued and can&apos;t get them from the company in Quebec . We are now trying other stores with no luck everyone says thie laminate it thicker then a lot that they have seen, does everyone have any suggestions on where to get it?, we live in the Oshawa area. jaindough Oct 15th, 2011, 03:32 PM Okay so I thought I would post a quick update post install of our Sunset Oak laminate flooring in our basement. We previously had carpeting laid directly over the concrete which we tore up prior to laying down a dricore subfloor and then the actual sunset oak laminate on top of that. We installed our flooring in mid June of this year.

The feel of the flooring is still solid, with no clicking or dipping anywhere. We had left ample expansion margins so there are no issues with buckling either. We have a stocky medium sized dog and there is no damage from his claws on the floor as of yet. There is no obvious chipping, denting or scratching anywhere. With the baseboards and quarter round insalled, the finished look is really nice and we are very happy with the quality of the flooring. The subfloor seems to make the floor feel warmer as well though we will put that to the test in the dead of winter.

One quick note; my husband and I were shopping in Costco in either late august or early september and noticed that the exact flooring we had purchased at full price was now on sale for 7 bucks off a box. On 22 boxes, that&apos;s a sweet rebate. We promptly went to customer service and asked if we could get the rebate even though we had made the purchase a couple of months prior. They said it shouldn&apos;t be a problem provided we still had our original receipt. Well lucky thing we did and we got a nice little sum in return for having asked about it. Big Daddy G Oct 19th, 2011, 12:43 PM I finally started installing the Black Oak in my basement this past weekend and I have an embarrassing confession. I&apos;ve read and re-read this thread multiple times to make sure I picked up any tips for installation. I made sure I started with the tongue against the starting wall and began working my through it. Started to encounter lots of issues by the third row and needed to&quot;hammer&quot;the pieces in like others have mentioned they needed to do as well.

Only problem was I didn&apos;t realize which side was the tongue and which was the groove. So in reality I was putting the groove against the wall. Obviously my own fault, just wondering if others are getting the two mixed up as well. IMO it is easy to confuse as the big part that sticks out I would logically have thought to be the tongue. :o

Oh well, once I figured it out I started over again and man it was like night and day! I was able to install double the amount of flooring in half the time with very little effort.

I hope that my silly story saves someone a few hours of stress. lavar Oct 19th, 2011, 02:59 PM Judging from your experience and some of what I have read recently I expect that there are still quite a few people who are/were installing it backwards and refuse to believe/try it the other way. Carpe Diem Oct 26th, 2011, 12:53 PM I finally started installing the Black Oak in my basement this past weekend and I have an embarrassing confession. I&apos;ve read and re-read this thread multiple times to make sure I picked up any tips for installation. I made sure I started with the tongue against the starting wall and began working my through it. Started to encounter lots of issues by the third row and needed to&quot;hammer&quot;the pieces in like others have mentioned they needed to do as well.

Thanks for sharing, I&apos;m about to start laying some down. Are you happy with the Black Oak? firerose617 Oct 26th, 2011, 02:33 PM We are&quot;trying&quot;to lay the Golden Select Walnut flooring in our living room, dining and hallway. I LOVE THE FLOOR - but our subfloor is OSB:( So, we laid new 3/8&quot;plywood over it thinking that would help&quot;flatten&quot;the floor. Unfortunately, there are still some spots that are either low or high. The high spot appears to be where beam that runs underneath the floor (ceiling of lower level). We have tried everything we can think of to fix this to no avail.

We have tried sand and 15 lb. felt which work pretty good for the low spots, but the high spot along the beam is a different story - at it&apos;s highest it&apos;s probably almost 1/2&quot;higher than the rest of the floor and then it slowly slopes away to flat again.

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. I have a floor installer coming today to give me ideas of what can be done, but we didn&apos;t buy the floor from him (we bought it at Sam&apos;s) and I don&apos;t think he is too happy about looking at it. At this point I would gladly pay someone to&quot;flatten&quot;the floor because I&apos;m about to lose my mind with this. I&apos;m not so sure he is going to be willing to do it.

Has anybody hired a installer for the job? If so, what is the going rate? I&apos;m in the US

Update: Just read on Ask The Builder website that you can use shingles to fill in the low spots - thoughts?


Thanks!

Forget the installer.....purchase some self leveling cement at Lowes. Level the sub floor and then install the laminate. Big Daddy G Oct 26th, 2011, 03:35 PM Thanks for sharing, I&apos;m about to start laying some down. Are you happy with the Black Oak?

So far so good, about half done 123tiguy Oct 30th, 2011, 03:51 PM I got my sons room completed, finally...

I don&apos;t know what everyone else&apos;s experience has been but this was a total pain in the a$$ to put together. It started off fine, then after about 4 rows I couldn&apos;t get new pieces to click together... After messing around with the same pieces for hours i just opened a new box and it would start going together fine. This problem repeated itself, and i suspect it&apos;s a quality control issue from the manufacturer. Or my own retardation, who knows.

Don&apos;t get me wrong, the end result is very nice and i&apos;m very happy with it. But it shouldn&apos;t have taken me 3 days of laying it after work to put down 100 square feet.

And to everyone who keeps asking... If you&apos;re putting this down on concrete you need a vapor barrier underneath. Read the instructions, or this thread. What is on the back is not a vapor barrier, it&apos;s just foam to prevent squeaks and creaking.

Watching the Golden Select video and reading the instructions should certainly help reduce the problems mentioned. I&apos;ve installed 2 different brands of laminate in the past and noticed the same problem occuring in both installations. Sawdust etc. from the manufacturing process gets in the groove making for a tighter abnormal fit or no fit at all.. Some boxes are ok. Others are bad.
An eneven floor will cause you problems as well.
Remember to&quot;SWEEP THE GROOVES AND TONGUES CLEAN&quot;with a short broom in a separate room first. If you are making a cut to the board,sweep again. This sure helped me make the job a lot easier. deepstuff Nov 15th, 2011, 11:27 PM So what stain are you guys using on transition pieces to match golden select Black Oak?


Thanks! deepstuff Nov 18th, 2011, 10:27 AM Or where can I get transition pieces to match? nin72 Nov 21st, 2011, 04:10 PM Iam looking for the same transition pieces for the black oak too. derekfromcanada Dec 16th, 2011, 10:35 PM So, I have watched this thread, shopped around, and picked up a box of Costco Golden Select laminate in Black Oak. Love the look and texture--and price. Laid some out over the carpet to see what it looked like in the room. It became apparent that the pattern repeated itself a lot. When I counted I found that out of the 12 pieces in the box, there were 7 of one pattern, then 2 and 3 of another...only three patterns in total. I think that installed over an area of 180 square feet that the repeating pattern would seem quite artificial looking. Anyone else experience this with Golden Select? The other available style in my local store is the Dark (Brazilian?) Walnut, which apparently comes in 3 different lengths in each box so it may offer more variation. We preferred the lighter colour of the Black Oak because we felt that it would show less dirt, debris and scratches (however, we do have a chocolate lab....hmmmm.) I sent an email to distributor Jsonic to see if more variation would appear if I bought more boxes (or if all the boxes on the pallet have the same three patterns) and have not received a reply. The whole pattern repeat thing is the only thing holding up this project. Thanks for any feedback. dealman5 Dec 17th, 2011, 08:55 PM Iam looking for the same transition pieces for the black oak too.

There is more than 3 patterns.... more like 7 or 8 different patterns. I noticed when installing to pick from two boxes at a time as a few boxes have alot of the boards with the same pattern while other boxes have a mixture of the patterns. VeeJayDee Jan 2nd, 2012, 12:49 AM Hi everyone,
Reading through the 39 pages of this thread took quite a while, but thanks to everyone (over the last 3 years!!!) for all the good information.

As expected, I received the 2012 Winter Savings book last week, and the Golden Select laminate will be on sale again March 5-18, 2012 ($7 off).

It says the following will be on sale:
- 310372
- 310373
- 310363

Does anyone know what the colors are for each of those codes? JSonic/Costco.ca websites don&apos;t say, and I can&apos;t get to a Costco for a few more weeks...

Thank you!

Should be Black Oak, Sunset Oak and Brazilian Walnut if it&apos;s based off of the same Fall selection VeeJayDee Jan 2nd, 2012, 06:22 PM It says the following will be on sale:
- 310372
- 310373
- 310363


Should be Black Oak, Sunset Oak and Brazilian Walnut if it&apos;s based off of the same Fall selection


I was able to go to Costco Ottawa East today in the end, and they had the following in-store:



310373 = Autumn Oak, Handscraped Laminate ($39.99 for 21.13 square feet, so $1.89/sq. ft.) --&gt;When on sale at $32.99, it will be $1.56/sq. ft.
310363 = Black oak, Regular Laminate (as per jsonic website (http://jsonic.ca/flo_laminate.htm)) ($36.99 for 19.69 sq. ft, so $1.88/sq. ft) --&gt;When on sale at $29.99, it will be $1.52/sq. ft.
And then they also had 310361, which was the Brazilian Walnut regular laminate at $36.99 as well, as per website, but that one is not listed on sale in the Coupon Book.


I suspect 310372 is probably another color of the handscraped kind, which looks really good. I could see that people had scratched the display pieces with their keys, but because it&apos;s handscraped and meant to look rustic, I don&apos;t think it would really bother me if it got scratched during every day use.

Has anyone installed the handscraped JSonic laminate yet? If so, how do you like it, and do you have pictures??

Thank you,
VJ MrFrugal1 Jan 3rd, 2012, 03:59 PM My lovely wife misfired a single person tea bag into the compost bucket under the sink. It bounced off the rim, I guess, and landed directly on a seam. It sat unnoticed, camouflaged nicely, on the walnut laminate overnight. Now there is a nice bulge at that spot. Who knew there was that much water in a used tea bag?

Definitely NOT for use anywhere there is moisture, or the possibility thereof. lisalanche Jan 26th, 2012, 12:02 PM Hi there, we are looking to put in the&quot;newer&quot;colour Mocha Walnut in March. Called Golden Select directly and they said that this colour has replaced the Walnut in Canada. This item is one of the sale items for the laminate coming up in March, item # 310372. Just wondering if anyone happens to have any pictures of it installed? Thanks Coleus Mar 7th, 2012, 12:02 AM how is the golden select laminiate comparing to the GEF that is on sale also at costco?

Anyone knows beside the golden select is a little bit cheaper?

Thanks $lacker Mar 17th, 2012, 10:51 AM ...and now based on experience, do not try to put more than 20 at a time in a Freestar. You will strain the suspension, and have trouble climbing hills!

I fit 26 boxes in the back of a CRV last night with no issues
I figured the total weight would be about the same as a fat American family on vacation, so it&apos;d be fine Krisalis Apr 6th, 2012, 06:55 PM My husband just laid the 15mm Brazilian Walnut in our house ( bought from Costco). He was concerned because he had a contractor say it was harder to lay, but it looks great and he said it really wasn&apos;t any harder.
Our only problem now is finding transition and stair nosing to match. We may end having to order directly from the company. expergo May 1st, 2012, 06:08 PM I purchased this from Costco and have some extra. I believe it&apos;s this one:

Keep It! If you ever damage a board it&apos;s easy to replace but only if you have the extra boards to actually do it. ;) proveau May 10th, 2012, 10:18 PM Installed this Jsonic brand Dark Walnut from Costco over the last few weeks. Our living/dining room, three bedrooms and stairway including landing and 14 steps, plus upper halway/landing. I bought 7 pc&apos;s stair nose and assorted trim from Jsonic&apos;s website. Delivery was quick and very well packaged in two solid hard tubes about 5&quot;or so in diameter by courier.
Installing this laminete was easier than cheap 9mm laminete I have installed in the past. It is more like installing hardwood without the nailing. It can be tricky sometimes, just keep all the grooves clean and if a board does not fit right don&apos;t force it! Rather reposition it slightly and try again. I used the usual laminete flooring install tool kit with wedge type spacers and tapping block and metal tapping tool for tight against the wall tapping. I did give most boards a couple light tap to make sure they were snugly in place. Finished up with new quarter round. Looks like real hardwood unless you look carefully for repeat patterns in the boards as there are only about 8 different patterns. Some boxes only had 2 or 3 patterns so we opened several boxes and sorted the boards and leaned them against the far wall from where we were installing. Laid the boards so no two same boards were too close to each other.
So far quite pleased but do not install where standing water will get on the floor and soak into the seams as the laminete will swell and raise up. I would not put it in a kitchen or bathroom myself. I put ceramic tile look laminete in my kitchen and bath.

In summary, looks like hardwood, feels great to walk on, solid and thick so no noise and fairly simple to install but does not like to get too wet. canuckgirl May 11th, 2012, 09:55 AM We are installing this this weekend over Delta FL on a concrete floor. It&apos;s pretty sloping so i&apos;m sure we&apos;ll have our moments of cursing. I&apos;ll let you guys know how it goes! expergo May 11th, 2012, 10:09 AM Keep It!

I didn&apos;t install it myself. If a piece is damaged/scratched in the middle of the room, I can just take out that one piece? 1needhelp May 15th, 2012, 05:23 PM Hi, has anyone installed the Mocha Walnut laminate from Costco? I am looking to find some transitions&amp;flush mount nosing. Any suggestions to where to find this would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. CSK&apos;sMom May 15th, 2012, 11:06 PM I didn&apos;t install it myself. If a piece is damaged/scratched in the middle of the room, I can just take out that one piece?

This laminate all clicks together. It can be taken apart to the damaged board and that board replaced. It&apos;s actually incredibly easy, we had to do when we built a wall and window seat in our living room. Because the cuts are already made, it&apos;s super fast too. We took out about 8-10 feet and reinstalled in about 20 minutes. Vancity Boy May 17th, 2012, 12:29 PM does anyone know if i can still put down underlay for this floor, even though it has &apos;built-in&apos; underlay, to give it that extra sound absorbing effect? nin72 May 17th, 2012, 02:45 PM Hi, has anyone installed the Mocha Walnut laminate from Costco?

You can order transition and nosing from the supplier at http://www.goldenselect.ca bottlecap May 17th, 2012, 02:51 PM You can order transition and nosing from the supplier at http://www.goldenselect.ca

For those that ordered nosing, were your shipping fees excessive? I looked at getting 11 - 4&apos; pieces of stair nosing and 1 piece of 8&apos; transition (total 200$) and they want 70$ to ship to Burlington, seems excessive to me, at this rate I&apos;m better off putting in oak veneer stairs instead. scottyohno Jun 10th, 2012, 12:51 PM I am in the process of installing of installing 35 boxes of the autumn oak on the main floor of my house. It&apos;s going together really well, I&apos;m very happy with it so far. Coleus Jun 11th, 2012, 07:00 PM anyone know where i can find the flush stair nose for mocha walnut. The one from supplier is not flush by the look of installation instruction

Thanks vancityallstar93 Jun 15th, 2012, 11:38 AM Just checking out the costco coupons in the states, and they have their laminate for $16 off, which brings the price for flooring between .95 to 1.10 a foot.

Was trying to decide on which one to get, the golden select or the harmonics from costco in the states. Not knowing a lot about flooring, can anyone see much of difference in the two? Below is the floor we&apos;re looking at in the states

Thanks

http://harmonics-flooring.com/products.cfm?item=11 Mattones Jun 27th, 2012, 07:29 PM I really like the Mocha Walnut one they have. I will be doing most of the main floor in it. Roughly 48 boxes. lol!

How did everyone get theirs home? I have a truck and a trailer so its not much of an issue. Just being noisey and wondering if everyone rented a Uhaul. retireat50 Jun 30th, 2012, 11:06 PM I really like the Mocha Walnut one they have. I will be doing most of the main floor in it.

I have a hatchback and did 4 or 5 individual trips.

So prior to last winter after installing my floor (Brazilian Walnut) I had a couple excess pieces. left one out all winter on my deck as i was curious to see what would happen. Anyways, here it is 8 months later and no swelling, buckling, bubbling anything to this one piece. Pretty impressive as the common wisdom with any laminate is that any amount of water will damage it quickly eternitybc Jul 5th, 2012, 01:15 PM Does anyone know if this is still available in the GVR? eternitybc Jul 5th, 2012, 02:27 PM I second the request for anyoen who&apos;s used harmonics - $16 off is a pretty good deal!
