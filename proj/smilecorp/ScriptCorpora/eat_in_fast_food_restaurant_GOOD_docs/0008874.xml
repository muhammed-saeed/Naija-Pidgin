 Poised Professionalism 

 By Lauren Morgan 

   

 An organized 
and professional shopper will not only enjoy their job more, but they will 
actually make more money doing it. Before you begin any assignment remind 
yourself that you must be professional in your appearance and in your 
demeanour. You certainly dont have to be dressed to the nines, but you should 
always have on clean, pressed clothing. If you are doing a business service 
shop or a high-end restaurant shop you should wear appropriate business or dress 
clothing. Always dress to suit the shop, and ensure your hair is neatly combed, 
and that you have paid close attention to personal hygiene. In most cases your 
dress will be smart casual wear. 

 Once you are 
dressed appropriately, ensure you are in the right frame of mind for the shop. If you just hand an argument with your spouse, or you are feeling really down in 
the dumps, this may not be your best day to shop. It is very important your own 
mood not interfere with the actual shop. If you cant change your mood by going 
for a walk and getting some fresh air or chatting with a friend, it is probably 
best to leave your shop for another day. (If the shop time frame allows for 
this). 

 If you are in a 
good disposition, it is time to begin your shop! Before you enter the doors of 
the place of business that you are to shop, erase from your mind of any personal 
opinion you have of the company. If it is a restaurant, and the last time you 
were there your waiter dropped a bowl of pasta on your lap, erase it!  If 
it is a clothing store, at the last time you were there you had a very pushy 
sales associate, erase it! If you are at the gym that has that cute, 
friendly, new instructor, erase it! If you are doing a bank shop, and you 
think that their interest rates are too high, erase it!  You must not 
enter the Shop with preconceived ideas or opinions. You must be able to wipe 
the slate clean, before you enter the doors. If you truly had a horrible 
experience that you cannot forget, I would advise you not to accept the shop. You are to act as an impartial, unbiased observer. If for any reason you cant 
follow through, it is not fair to the client who is paying for your services. 

 One final word 
about professionalism, I have come across some shoppers who believe it is their 
job to catch the person they are shopping make a mistake. Sometimes 
these shoppers relish in finding others errors. As shoppers, we are to provide 
feedback of both positive and negative situations, but it is NOT our job 
to embellish, or blow a tiny error out of proportion. For example, if a server 
at a fast food restaurant gave you an order of small fries instead of the large 
order that you requested, but then caught their mistake and corrected it, it 
would not be appropriate to state: 

 Mary completely 
mixed up my order, I think her head was in the clouds, after all, this was a 
simple request! 

 A more appropriate 
and professional way to word this might be: 

 Mary brought me a 
small order of fries instead of the large fries I had ordered. When all the 
food I ordered was on my tray, Mary double-checked my order against her 
printout. She caught the error, smiled and apologized, and brought me a fresh 
order of large fries, and gave me an extra ketchup packet to go with them. 

 Remember a simple 
mistake like this does not mean you were put out and your order or request was 
ruined. It is important to have an open and reasonable approach to your shops, 
and not an overly critical one. Always conduct yourself in a professional 
manner, no matter what type of service you receive.  This is your job, and 
you are being paid for it , always put forward the appropriate behaviour.

 Shopper Tips 

 
 I receive a lot of assignments for banks. It is my 
 experience that the cards are no longer easily available. You either have 
 to be offered a card or ask for one. It is rather difficult to ask for the 
 lobby host or hostess card. I have learned to write their name on the back 
 of the card that is given to me by the person I talk to in my assessment of 
 the bank. This reminds me to mention this person in my report.- Laura 
 I just viewed your section 
 in the newsletter about note taking. I find that my PDA is a great way to 
 take notes while&quot;waiting&quot;. I also use my cell phone that allows me to 
 input text and it looks like I&apos;m playing games!!! Denise 
 I have a four year old Granddaughter who lives with me. She&apos;s cute 
 as a button and is the perfect prop for my shops. As we enter the store, I 
 hand her a&quot;shopping list&quot;for her to check off. She loves to say&quot;check and 
 pretend she marked off the correct article. When I get near the deli, I say,&quot;Let Grandma add something to your list&quot;. She hands me the pad and I write 
 down the names of the Managers on the next page, add another item to her 
 list and we carry on business. It&apos;s great fun for her and it helps me with 
 the hardest part of the shop, the correct spelling of manager&apos;s names. -

 SSC Staff Spotlight Terri Lawrence 

 Compiled 
by Karen Widdifield, Former SSC Senior Editor 

   

 Terri 
Lawrence has been with The Secret Shopper Company since July 2002. She started 
as a trainee and was soon promoted to Junior Editor. By October of that year, 
Terri had moved up to Senior Editor. In March 2003 Terri took on additional 
responsibilities when she became a Project Manager. She currently holds the 
position of Director of Training and Performance, and she continues to serve as 
Project Manager for several large SSC accounts.  

   

 In her 
role as Director of Training and Performance, Terris duties include training 
new editors and monitoring the staff performance at SSC. New editors go through 
a two-month training period to develop and refine their editing skills. They 
learn about each of the accounts, take quizzes and perform edits on their own. Throughout the process, they are encouraged with constructive feedback on their 
work. At the end of the two months, they are given a test to gauge their 
skills. If they pass, they are awarded the title of Junior Editor. 

   

 Terri also 
monitors the performance levels of the existing staff and provides help where 
needed. SSC maintains high standards for all of its editors. Quizzes and other 
interactive games are frequently offered to promote and increase awareness of 
what is required for all of the SSC clients. SSC also offers bonuses and prizes 
based on performance levels. Terri reports, Enlighten, Educate, Motivate and 
Reward is our motto, and we stick by it! 

   

 In 
addition to her duties at SSC, Terri keeps busy with her family. She has six 
children in all, two in college and four at home. Her one-year-old is the 
youngest of the clan. In her spare time, if she can find any, she loves to read 
and especially enjoys Anne Rice novels!

 Commas, where oh, where do they go? 

 By Nickole 
Montoya 

   

 Do you put 
commas all over the place or hardly use them? Here are some rules to keep in 
mind as you write an SSC report as to when to use commas and when to leave them 
out. 

   

 Commas are used in these instances: 

             

 1.        If a compound sentence 
consists of independent clauses that stand on their own, use a comma. (i.e. The 
associate smiled at me , and he asked how she could assist me.)  

 2.        You would use a comma 
before or after a quotation. (i.e. Hi, lets see if I can help you find what 
you want, said Shawna. Or Shawna said, Hi, lets see if I can help you find 
what you want. 

 3.        A clause that starts 
with which goes inside commas. (The rod, which was the most expensive, had all 
the features I wanted.) 

   

 Commas are not used in these instances: 

   

 1.        If a compound sentence 
consists of dependent clauses that do not stand on their own, do not use a 
comma. (i.e. The associate smiled at me and asked how she could assist me.) 

 2.        A comma should not be 
used around that clauses. (The rod that had all the features I wanted was the 
most expensive.)
