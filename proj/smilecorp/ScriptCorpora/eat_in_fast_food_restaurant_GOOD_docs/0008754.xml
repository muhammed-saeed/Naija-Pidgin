 Processing, Value Addition&amp;Uses 

 

 

 The popular recipes prepared using pineapple in this area 
are juice, squash, halva, jam, candy, pickles, chutney and vine.The Pineapple 
fruit is processed into a range of refreshing food products. Recognizing the 
vast potential of Keralas finest farms, a project Kerala Horticulture 
Development Programme (KHDP) was promoted jointly by the European Union and 
Government of Kerala. A fruit processing unit was established under this project 
at Nadukkara, near Vazhakulam. The delicious fruits of Kerala are transformed 
into a wide range of products with brand identity JIVE.

 Pineapple in syrup 

   

 Processing 

 Reception and 
 weighing of pineapples. Select the raw material and remove damaged parts. Remove the stem. Wash the pineapples in drinking water. 

 Peel the pineapples 
 and remove the inedible parts. Cut the pineapples as required. They may be 
 cut into slices (rings), chunks, and tidbit or may be crushed. 

 

 

 Heat the pineapple 
 pieces in the pot, as illustrated. Fill the jars with the pieces while they 
 are still warm, up to approximately two thirds of their capacity. 

 The
 hot syrup is added to the fruit, which has been arranged in the jars. 
 Make sure that the jars are filled to the brim. Let the jars settle for 5 
 minutes to allow them and the fruit to warm up. Seal the jars hermetically. 
 Sterilize the jars in boiling water for 20 minutes after placing them in 
 bags to prevent them from knocking against each other and breaking when the 
 water begins to boil. Cool the jars with running water. Dry, seal with 
 adhesive tape, label and store. 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Pineapple juice  

 Procedure: 

 Remove peel from 1 large 
 pineapple, grind, put into kettle with water to barely cover and boil 
 rapidly 10 minutes. 

 Strain juice through 
 cheesecloth bag. Pour juice into clean jars to within 1/2 inch of top of 
 jar. Put on cap, screwing the band tight.  

 Process in boiling water 
 bath for 10 minutes. Packing may be plastic bottles or bags, coated cans, 
 multilaminate (plastic, paper, metal foil) or any newer materials. 

 The pH values of the product 
 must be controlled so it remains agreeable for human consumption. It is a 
 common practice to blend batches of juices to attain proper acidity and 
 sensory qualities.  

 Pineapple fruit jam   

 Raw material : 

 Pineapples: 6 kg (peeled)
Sugar: 3 kg
Lemon juice: 50 ml   

 Processing : 

 Remove the unripe fruit and 
 those affected by blemishes or signs of decay. Wash in abundant water and 
 let drip. Remove the skin, according to the fruit being processed. Cut the 
 fruit in halves or quarters, according to its size, and place in a pot. 

 Cook on low heat and stir 
 frequently with a wooden spoon to prevent the product from sticking to the 
 bottom of the pot and burning. Simmer for 15 minutes. Cook on a higher flame 
 for 15 more minutes and stir frequently with the wooden spoon. 

 Add 1 kg of sugar and 
 dissolve rapidly. Let cook for 30 minutes. Add 50 ml of lemon juice. Add the 
 remaining 2 kg of sugar, dissolve rapidly and boil for 15-20 minutes. When 
 the product has become thicker and has reached the setting point, remove 
 from the fire. 

 Fill the previously washed 
 and dried glass jars with the hot jam up to 1.5 cm from the rim. Clean the 
 upper part of the jars from possible jam residues. Close with screw-band 
 lids. Turn the lid-bearing jars upside down, to sterilize the lids until the 
 content cools off. Remove all jam residues from the outside of the jars and 
 lids. Label each container, indicating the name of the product, the 
 ingredients and date on which the product was prepared. Place a strip of 
 adhesive paper over jar and lid, so as to be able to check whether the 
 container was previously opened, before consuming the contents. Store in a 
 dry place, free from dust and away from light. The product may be preserved 
 for at least 12 months. Since less sugar than normal is used to make an 
 extra-quality jam, once the jar is opened the product must be stored in the 
 refrigerator. 

   

 Pineapple Dried 

   

 Processing :

Pineapple has 
been known to be excellent for drying. In this product, most of the free water 
of the fruit is eliminated. To prepare, select fully ripe, fresh pineapple. 
Remove skin and eyes from pineapple with a sharp knife. Usually, chunks or 
slices are prepared for better presentation and make handling easier. Final 
moisture is near 5%, and this allows the dried fruit to have a long shelf life 
as long as proper packing is provided and storage is done in a fresh place.

 

 Pretreatments prevent fruits from darkening during long-term storage 

   

 Sulfuring: 

In this method, 
sublimed sulfur is ignited and burned in an enclosed box with the fruit. The 
sulfur fumes penetrate the fruit and act as a pretreatment by retarding spoilage 
and darkening of the fruit. The sulfur fumes also reduce the loss of vitamins A 
and C.

   

 Sulfite 
dip: 

Sulfite dips can 
achieve the same long-term anti-darkening effect as sulfuring, but more quickly 
and easily. Either sodium bisufite or sodium meta-bisulfite that are USP (food 
grade) or Reagent grade (pure) can be used.

Directions: 
Dissolve to 1 teaspoons sodium bisufite per quart of water. (If using sodium 
sulfite, use 1 to 3 teaspoons. If using sodium meta-bisulfite, use 1 to 2 
tablespoons.) Place the prepared fruit in the mixture and soak 5 minutes for 
slices, 15 minutes for halves. Remove fruits, rinse lightly under cold water and 
place on drying trays for drying.

   

 Ascorbic 
Acid :

Ascorbic acid 
(vitamin C) mixed with water is a safe way to prevent fruit browning. However, 
its protection does not last as sulfuring or sulfiting.

Directions: Mix 
3000 mg ascorbic acid tablets, crushed in 2 cups of water. Place the fruit in 
the solution for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove fruit, drain well and place on dryer 
trays. After this solution is used twice, add more ascorbic acid.

   

 Fruit 
juice dip :

A fruit juice 
that is high in vitamin C can also be used as a pretreatment, though it is not 
as effective as pure ascorbic acid. Juices high in vitamin C include orange, 
lemon, pineapple, and grape. Each juice adds its own color and flavor to the 
fruit.

Directions: Place 
enough juice to cover the fruit in a bowl. Add sliced fruit. Soak 3 to 5 
minutes, remove fruit, drain well and place on dryer trays. This solution may be 
used twice, before being replaced.

   

 Honey dip :

Honey dipped 
fruit is much higher in calories.

Directions: Mix 
cup sugar with 1 cups boiling water. Cool to lukewarm and add cup honey. 
Place fruit in dip and soak 3 to 5 minutes. Remove fruit, drain well and place 
on dryer trays.

   

 Preparing and Using Sugar Syrups 

Adding syrup to 
canned fruit helps to retain its flavor, color, and shape. It does not prevent 
spoilage of these foods. The following guidelines for preparing and using syrups 
offer new&quot;very light&quot;syrup, which approximates the natural sugar content of 
many fruits. The sugar content in each of the five syrups is increased by about 
10 percent. Quantities of water and sugar to make enough syrup for a canner load 
of pints or quarts are provided for each syrup type.

**Many fruits that are typically packed in heavy 
syrup are excellent and tasteful products when packed in lighter syrups. It is 
recommended that lighter syrups be tried, since they contain fewer calories from 
added sugar.

   

 Uses of Pineapple 

   

 Food Uses 

Field ripe fruits 
are best for eating fresh, and it is only necessary to remove the crown, rind, 
eyes and core. In India, flesh of larger fruits is cut up in various ways and 
eaten fresh, as dessert, in salads, compotes and otherwise, or cooked in pies, 
cakes, puddings, or as a garnish on ham, or made into sauces or preserves. In 
Panama, very small pineapples are cut from the plant with a few inches of stem 
to serve as a handle, the rind is removed except at the base, and the flesh is 
eaten out-of-hand like corn on the cob. Malayans utilize the pineapple in 
curries and various meat dishes. In the Philippines, the fermented pulp is made 
into a popular sweetmeat called nata de pina. The pineapple does not 
lend itself well to freezing, as it tends to develop off flavors.

Canned pineapple 
is consumed throughout the world. The highest grade is the skinned, cored fruit 
sliced crosswise and packed in syrup. Undersize or overripe fruits are cut into&quot;spears&quot;, chunks or cubes. Surplus pineapple juice used to be discarded after 
extraction of bromelain. Today there is a growing demand for it as a beverage. 
Crushed pineapple, juice, nectar, concentrate, marmalade and other preserves are 
commercially prepared from the flesh remaining attached to the skin after the 
cutting and trimming of the central cylinder. All residual parts cores, skin and 
fruit ends are crushed and given a first pressing for juice to be canned as such 
or prepared as syrup used to fill the cans of fruit, or is utilized in 
confectionery and beverages, or converted into powdered pineapple extract which 
has various roles in the food industry. Chlorophyll from the skin and ends 
imparts a greenish hue that must be eliminated and the juice must be used within 
20 hours as it deteriorates quickly. A second pressing yields&quot;skin juice&quot;which 
can be made into vinegar or mixed with molasses for fermentation and 
distillation of alcohol.

In Africa, young, 
tender shoots are eaten in salads. The terminal bud or&quot;cabbage&quot;and the 
inflorescences are eaten raw or cooked. Young shoots, called &quot;hijos de pina&quot; are sold on vegetable markets in Guatemala.

 

 Toxicity 

When unripe, the 
pineapple is not only inedible but also poisonous, irritating the throat and 
acting as a drastic purgative. Excessive consumption of pineapple cores has 
caused the formation of fiber balls (bezoars) in the digestive tract.

 

 Other 
Uses 

 

 Bromelain: The proteolytic enzyme, bromelain, or bromelin, was formerly derived from 
pineapple juice; now it is gained from the mature plant stems salvaged when 
fields are being cleared. The yield from 368 lbs (167 kg) of stern juice is 8 
lbs (3.6 kg) of bromelain. The enzyme is used like papain from papaya for 
tenderizing meat and chill proofing beer; is added to gelatin to increase its 
solubility for drinking; has been used for stabilizing latex paints and in the 
leather-tanning process. In modern therapy, it is employed as a digestive and 
for its anti-inflammatory action after surgery, and to reduce swellings in cases 
of physical injuries; also in the treatment of various other complaints.

 

 Fiber: Pineapple leaves yield a strong, white, silky fiber which was extracted by 
Filipinos before 1591. Certain cultivars are grown especially for fiber 
production and their young fruits are removed to give the plant maximum 
vitality. The &apos;Perolera&apos; is an ideal cultivar for fiber extraction because its 
leaves are long, wide and rigid. In India the thread is prized by shoemakers and 
it was formerly used in the Celebes. Chinese people in Kwantgung Province and on 
the island of Hainan weave the fiber into coarse textiles resembling grass 
cloth. It was long ago used for thread in Malacca and Borneo. In West Africa it 
has been used for stringing jewels and also made into capes and caps worn by 
tribal chiefs. The people of Guam hand-twist the fiber for making fine casting 
nets. They also employ the fiber for wrapping or sewing cigars. Pina cloth made 
on the island of Panay in the Philippines and in Taiwan is highly esteemed. In 
Taiwan they also make a coarse cloth for farmers&apos; underwear. The outer, long 
leaves are preferred. In the manual process, they are first decorticated by 
beating and rasping and stripping, and then left to ret in water to which 
chemicals may be added to accelerate the activity of the microorganisms which 
digest the unwanted tissue and separate the fibers. Retting time has been 
reduced from 5 days to 26 hours. The rested material is washed clean, dried in 
the sun and combed. In mechanical processing, the same machine can be used that 
extracts the fiber from sisal. Estimating 10 leaves to the lb (22 per kg), 
22,000 leaves would constitute one ton and would yield 50-60 lbs (22-27 kg) of 
fiber.

 

 Juice: Pineapple juice has been employed for cleaning machete and knife blades and, 
with sand, for scrubbing boat decks.

 

 Animal 
Feed: Pineapple crowns are sometimes fed to horses if not needed for 
planting. Final pineapple waste from the processing factories may be dehydrated 
as&quot;bran&quot;and fed to cattle, pigs and chickens.&quot;Bran&apos;&apos; is also made from the 
stumps after bromelain extraction. Expendable plants from old fields can be 
processed as silage for maintaining cattle when other feed is scarce. The silage 
is low in protein and high in fiber and is best mixed with urea, molasses and 
water to improve its nutritional value.

 

 Folk 
Medicine: Pineapple juice is taken as a diuretic and to expedite labor, 
also as a gargle in cases of sore throat and as an antidote for seasickness. The 
flesh of very young (toxic) fruits is deliberately ingested to achieve abortion 
(a little with honey on 3 successive mornings); also to expel intestinal worms; 
and as a drastic treatment for venereal diseases. Indians in Panama use the leaf 
juice as a purgative, emmenagogue and vermifuge. In Africa the dried, powdered 
root is a remedy for edema. The crushed rind is applied on fractures and the 
rind decoction with rosemary is applied on hemorrhoids.

 

 Ornamental Value 

The pineapple 
fruit with crown intact is often used as a decoration and there are variegated 
forms of the plant universally grown for their showiness indoors or out
