Muffin Tin Sizes
 
Muffin tins (also called muffin pans or muffin rings) are used for making muffins. These come in different sizes and their styles can be distinct too. Here are some of the products currently being sold.

Muffin Tin Sizes: Fox Run Set

The Fox Run Set has four metal rings. The rings are 3 3/4 inches in diameter and an inch deep. The product is made of tin plated steel and comes with rolled edges.

The tins can be used not just for making muffins but also for serving up eggs and even crackers. The tins can also be used for making hamburger buns too.

The rings are solidly connected so they can be used all the time without breaking down. The metals are thin but durable. Applying some spray oil can help the tins become even more durable.

Muffin Tin Sizes: Wilton Easy Flex Silicone 6 Cup

The Wilton Easy Flex Silicone 6 Cup Muffin Pan measures 1.3 x 6.8 x 11.8 inches. The flexible pan is designed to withstand stain and does not absorb odor either. The shape makes the product easy to hold and store.

The tin can be used in ovens up to 500 F. It is also safe to use in a microwave and can be stored in a freezer or the fridge. The muffin tin can be washed by hand or cleaned in the dishwasher. Because the pan is flexible and light, it can be carried with ease.

Muffin Tin Sizes: Fat Daddio’s

Fat Daddio’s 6-Cup Muffin Top/Crown Pan measures 4 inches in diameter at the top x 3 3/4 inch (bottom) and is 3/4 Inches deep. This measurement is for the individual cavity.

The pan is heavy duty 18 gauge anodized aluminum. Because the product is anodized, the aluminum is totally sealed. This makes it resistant to scratching. This also makes the surface smooth. Most importantly, this prevents leaching and cross contamination of the material into food.

The bakeware does not react to dairy or acidic ingredients. Besides making muffins, the pan can be used for making eggs, chicken, meatloaf and burgers. The muffin tin distributes the heat uniformly and safely. The product can be washed by hand or cleaned in any dishwasher.

Muffin Tin Sizes: Wilton Aluminum 6-Cup Jumbo

The Wilton Aluminum 6-Cup Jumbo muffin tins measures 2 x 9.4 x 13.8 inches. The generous specs let you bake muffins in an extra large size. The container is made from anodized aluminum.

This results in uniform heating and makes it more robust. The tins have straight sides so taking the food out is easier to do. Each cup is 3¾inches at the top with a depth of 2 inches. The base is 2¼inches. The package comes with a recipe guide. The rim design keeps batter in place. It also keeps dripping down.

With plenty of muffin tin sizes to choose from, it should be easy to find one that suits your baking fancy. The other aspect that you should look at is the material used to make the pan as it affects durability.
