El Cajon man shot by police outside fast-food restaurant dies
 July 8, 2010 |  11:05 am 
A 56-year-old El Cajon man shot by police during a knife-wielding incident outside a fast-food restaurant has died, police said Thursday.

Moses Jovid Muhammad was shot Friday by Officer Nick Sprecco after refusing commands to drop a knife that he had used to menace several persons, police said. He died this morning at a San Diego area hospital.



Sprecco, a motorcycle officer with seven years&apos; experience, is the son of El Cajon Police Chief Pat Sprecco.



The incident is being probed by the San Diego County district attorney&apos;s office, which is standard procedure in an officer-involved shooting.

Where possible, police should have to repeatedly warn a suspect to drop a weapon or face death by gunshot. Simply telling them to&quot;drop it&quot;is not enough. The warnings should be explicit, such as&quot;drop it, or I&apos;m going to shoot you in the head right now.&quot;If such warnings were given, I think there&apos;d be less of these capital punishment without trial shootings.

Went the police order you to drop your weapon, I guess you should do it. Good work Officer Sprecco.

Fairness -

A officer is holding a weapon pointed at you and tells you to&apos;drop&apos;something....well you DROP everything....or you get shot and dead. Very simple instructions -&apos;Drop it!&apos;I assume if it was up to you, you have the Officer give a group hug to the bad guy first, right?

&apos;Fairness&apos;, the article said the perp had received commmands
(plural), not a command (singular) to drop the knife. How many times does law enforcement need to warn knife-wielders? Stop watching so many cop shows!

If an officer is pointing a gun at you, ordering you to&quot;drop it&quot;, how much more of a warning do you expect him to give? What is so confusing about that when you are holding a weapon? Should the officer tell you to drop the weapon so you don&apos;t mistakenly drop your pants? Good job officer, it&apos;s people like&quot;Fairness&quot;that are killing this state.

Many people do not listen to officers&apos;orders.

I just don&apos;t get it.

A person with a gun giving me orders would get my attention.

Do El Cajon police carry Tasers?

i notice a lot of death-happy people here! just to play devil&apos;s advocate for a second - aren&apos;t police able to use non-lethal methods these days, like say - tazer gun?

just a thought. we don&apos;t know any of the circumstances surrounding this, so let&apos;s not jump to conclusions and find happiness in the shooting of someone.
