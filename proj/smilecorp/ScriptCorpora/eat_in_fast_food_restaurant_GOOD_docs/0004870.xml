 Its my 30th birthday 

Your 30th birthday marks another decade in your life. You’ve learned a lot of things and are leaving your immaturity behind. You now have more responsibilities to other people, but life is still fun because of all the knowledge you’ve gained through the years.

Celebrate your 30th birthday by giving yourself a birthday bash that you and your guests will remember for the rest of your lives. There are many things to consider, including the invitations , decorations , games and activities, and food . Here are some tips on how to celebrate your 30th birthday party.

Your Party Invitations

 30th Birthday Invitation 

The first thing you should plan is which party invitations to use. You can purchase traditional party invitations from shops. These invitations have different designs, so you can surely find one that matches your taste. All you have to do is write the details of the party, including the date, time, and venue, inside.

If you want a custom party invitation, consider using photo-editing and greeting card programs like Adobe Photoshop and GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program). You can choose the look of your invitation from the existing templates of these programs. Filling up the invitations is easy because all you need to do is edit the entries as you wish.

Once you’re done editing the invitations on the computer, you can print them or send them online. Printing invitations might not be a practical idea though. If you have more than 20 guests coming to your party and if the invitations have many colors, the printer’s ink might run out. In this case, a better option would be to just send the invitations online . Save the invitations on your hard drive and then send them to guests via e-mail.

Decorations For Your Birthday Bash

 30th Birthday streamers 

You can make the number 30 the theme of your birthday party. Put huge streamers in the shape of the number 30 all over the venue to emphasize the theme. You may also use posters with your age to decorate the venue. It’s your option whether to make the decorations simple or elaborate.

There are many other birthday party themes to choose from. If you’re a big fan of a certain movie, you can use that movie as the theme of your party. For example, if you’re a Star Wars fan, then everyone in the party should dress up as characters from the Star Wars films. Whatever theme you choose, make sure that your guests can dress up appropriately for it.

Search the Internet for items that you can use as decorations for the theme of your 30th birthday party. This is the easiest way to get the decorations you need. Select all the items you need for your party, pay for them online, and just wait for them to be delivered to your home.

Games and Activities For 30 Year Olds

Games and activities at your 30th Birthday party should be appropriate for the age of your guests. Sure, you can have fun with children’s games like Pin the Tail on The Donkey, but remember that some of your guests might find it awkward to play these games. Try to make the party fun without turning it into a children’s party, unless that is the theme you chose. The following games and activities should make your party fun and memorable:

 Musical chairs: While musical chairs is a classic children’s game, it’s still appropriate for your party because it’s simple and fun to do. Arrange several chairs in a circular formation and ask for participants. If you have 30 guests or more, consider playing a game with 30 chairs to emphasize your birthday.

Check this movie and have fun watching their Musical Chairs Game.

The number of chairs should always be one less than the number of players. Play a song on your sound system, then ask the players to dance around the chairs as the music plays. Players must quickly sit on the chairs when you stop the music. There’s always one player left standing because there aren’t enough chairs for everybody. That player leaves the game and the game continues as chairs are removed one by one. The player who gets the last chair wins the game.

 The hat game: To play this game, first, get some hats and ask for participants. It’s best if you choose 30 participants to stick to the theme of the party. Tell all the participants to put the hats on and don’t take them off until you do. The objective of this game is NOT to be the last player wearing a hat. Next, continue talking to other people at the party until you notice that players have forgotten that they’re even playing the game. Take off your hat and watch other players as they also take off their hats. The last player to take off his hat loses the game.

 Charades: Charades is another classic party game that will surely appeal to both young and adult guests. To play the game, first, fill a bowl with strips of paper with words written on them belonging to a single category.

Watch this movie and learn some tricks on how to play the Charades Game.

For the category movies for instance, you can have:“The Matrix,”“Cinderella Man,”“Lord of the Rings,”or“Casablanca.”Divide players into two or three teams. Each team picks a player who will act out the words on the strips of paper. Other people in the team try to guess the word by interpreting the actor’s pantomime of the words. Remember to set a time limit to how long teams can guess a word. Give scores to teams who guess the words within the time limit. The team who scores the highest wins the game.

 Who am I: This is a thinking game that may be greatly appreciated by your older guests. First, pick a category, such as vegetables, movie stars, and cartoon characters. Pin words belonging to these categories on the back of guests as they arrive. The objective of this game is for them to find out who they are by asking other guests.

Participants can’t ask just any question, though. Questions should only be answered by yes or no. Also, participants can’t remove their tags to find out who they are. You may play this game while moving around or seated as a group. Before the end of the game, participants must group themselves according to what they gathered about the tags at their backs. Vegetables should have their own group, movie stars have their own, and also cartoon characters. Players who are wrong about the groups that they choose lose and the winning players get a prize.

Food for Your 30th Birthday Party

Food is another important consideration in your 30th Birthday party. Here are some party treats that can surely satisfy your guests.

 Spaghetti: Spaghetti is an all-time favorite meal, which makes it perfect for your 30th birthday party. It’s also rich in flavor and can keep people’s spirits high. Remember to top spaghetti with plenty of cheese and meatballs to make it even more delicious. Drumsticks: Chicken drumsticks are crispy, tasty and fun to eat. You may arrange 30 of them in a circular formation on a plate if you have 30 guests or fewer. If you have more guests, just pile them up on a big plate and let your guests eat them to their hearts’content. Pizza: Pizza ’s main advantage over other party treats is that it is delicious, meaty, and easy to eat. You have the option to either make your own pizza or order from a fast food restaurant. Choose meaty and thick pizzas to make your guests happy.

 Cookies and muffins: Cookies and muffins are perfect for guests who refuse to eat anything heavy. Put cookies on a tray and muffins on a separate tray, then serve both to your guests. Hot dogs: Hot dogs, like cookies and muffins, are always a hit at parties because they are easy to eat. Hot dogs are meaty, juicy, and are sure to keep your guests coming back to the table for more. Coffee or Tea: If you’re holding the party at night, consider having a cup of coffee before you let your guests go. You’ve lived a long, beautiful life for 30 years, so it’s just appropriate that you spend some time with other people to share your stories. Guests can also share their own life experiences over cups of coffee. Birthday cake: A birthday party is not complete without a birthday cake . Buy a candle in the shape of the number 30 and put it atop the cake. Once guests are done singing your birthday song, blow out the candle, and cut the cake for your guests.

Make your 30th birthday party a memorable one by planning everything beforehand. Meticulous planning is key to avoid awkward silences during the party and other unfortunate events. Don’t fuss too much over your guests during the party though. Have fun because this party is for you, after all.

* Many people dread turning 30. They’re not “young” anymore, and they’ve reached the age where their life will be filled with nothing but responsibilities. Of course, that doesn’t mean they don’t get to have fun! Here are some cool things to do before turning 30.
