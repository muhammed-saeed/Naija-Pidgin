Author: timosha21 The Mass Rapid Transit or MRT is a rapid transit system that forms the backbone of the railway system in Singapore, spanning the entire city-state. The initial section of the MRT, between Yio Chu Kang Station and Toa Payoh Station, opened in 1987 establishing itself as the second-oldest metro system in Southeast Asia, after Manila&apos;s LRT System. The network has since grown rapidly as a result of Singapore&apos;s aim of developing a comprehensive rail network as the main backbone of the public transport system in Singapore with an average daily ridership of 1.952 million in 2009, just over 63% of the bus network&apos;s 3.085 million in the same period. - The MRT has 79 stations with 129.7 kilometres of lines and operates on standard gauge. The rail lines have been constructed by the Land Transport Authority, a statutory board of the Government of Singapore, which allocates operating concessions to the profit-based corporations SMRT Corporation and SBS Transit. These operators also run bus and taxi services, thus ensuring that there is a full integration of public transport services. The MRT is complemented by the regional Light Rail Transit (LRT) systems that link MRT stations with HDB public housing estates. Services operate from about 5:30 am and usually end before 1 am daily with frequencies of approximately three to eight minutes, and services extended during festive periods. http://wn.com/Metro_subway_in_Singapore,_Singapore_MRT

 Economics of Land Transport in Singapore - Market Structures and Public Transport Policy

Author: LTAsingapore Jointly developed by LTA and MOE and launched in August 2010 for A&apos;Levels Economics students, this is the second of a series of four case study videos that illustrate how economic concepts and principles apply to the land transport system in Singapore. Market Structures and Public Transport Policy in Singapore: The different modes of public transport in Singapore operate under different market structures, evolving with the needs of the commuters. In the early 1960s, public bus services operated in a monopolistic competition market as opposed to the duopolistic structure today. The mass rapid transit (MRT) system started off with a monopoly before evolving to a duopoly today. With lower barriers to entry and more firms entering the market, taxi services operate in an oligopoly. Find out why each industry is shaped as such and how they fit into the market structure continuum, and why government intervention is necessary. http://wn.com/Economics_of_Land_Transport_in_Singapore_Market_Structures_and_Public_Transport_Policy

 Reform Party Tells Singapore Don&apos;t Fear Change Of Government 
 Order: Reorder Duration: 1:48 Published: 24 Mar 2010 Updated: 04 Mar 2012 
Author: SingaporeDaft -in.reuters.com Mar. 12, 2010 reported ---- - It is time for people in one-party ruled Singapore to have more say in politics and not be fearful of a change of government, a hedge fund manager turned opposition leader said on Friday. Kenneth Jeyaretnam, whose late father and veteran opposition leader was bankrupted in defamation lawsuits by the ruling People&apos;s Action Party (PAP), said his two-year-old Reform Party was encouraging people to come out and offer different views.&quot;Firstly, do not be afraid. You have a right to exercise, to have a say, in how your country is run,&quot;Jeyaretnam told Reuters in an interview.&quot;Singapore is not going to collapse. Competition in politics is as necessary as it is in economics to ensure efficiency.&quot;Jeyaretnam, 51, who graduated from Cambridge in 1983 with double-first class honours in economics and once ran a London-based hedge fund, said his party was aiming for the same audience as the PAP in the next election, due by February 2012. Jeyaretnam said he would focus his political campaign on offering alternative policies rather than attacking personalitities in the PAP or the government. The Reform Party proposes the possible privatisation of Singapore&apos;s two multi-billion dollar state wealth funds -- Government of Singapore Investment Corp and Temasek -- to allow more transparency. Jeyaretnam would keep taxes low to make Singapore a top investment destination, but said a wider healthcare system was needed to deal with an ageing population. http://wn.com/Reform_Party_Tells_Singapore_Don&apos;t_Fear_Change_Of_Government

Author: NTDTV CHAN: In Singapore, migrant workers are facing unemployment and debt from recession. The once economically bright island city is coming to terms with the reality of the global economic crisis. STORY: Singapore&apos;s rapid development pace has been built on the backs of migrant workers from the region, who for decades have worked in the shipping and construction industries. But the economic reality is that this island city, once a major success story in Asia, is facing tough times. Singapore&apos;s founder and former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew is saying the economy could shrink by as much as 10 percent this year. Worse affected by the economic downturn are migrant workers as massive construction projects are halted or companies are simply unable to make ends meet. John Gee, head of Transient Workers Count Too, a Singapore-based organization dedicated to looking after the welfare of migrant workers, says many more workers have been coming to them for help in the past few months. [John Gee, President,&quot;Transient Workers Count Too&amp;#8221;]:&quot;Most workers who come here, they fulfill their contracts, they go home. It&apos;s not a big problem, but definitely in the economic crisis, we are seeing more employers being squeezed for cash and among the first victims will be migrant workers. They look where they can make the cut and that&apos;s what happens. So, first of all a payment runs late and then it becomes non-payment.&quot;The organization runs a&quot;Free Meal Program&quot;every weekday for breakfast and&lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt; http://wn.com/Plight_of_Singapore&apos;s_Migrant_Workers

The cuisine of Singapore is said to be similar to the diverse cuisine of Penang, Malaysia, as most of the foods in Singapore can also be found in the state of Penang.

The initial section of the MRT, between Yio Chu Kang Station and Toa Payoh Station, opened in 1987 establishing itself as the second-oldest metro system in Southeast Asia, after Manila&apos;s LRT System. The network has since grown rapidly as a result of Singapore&apos;s aim of developing a comprehensive rail network as the main backbone of the public transport system in Singapore with an average daily ridership of 1.952 million in 2009, just over 63% of the bus network&apos;s 3.085 million in the same period. - The MRT has 79 stations with 129.7 kilometres of lines and operates on standard gauge. The rail lines have been constructed by the Land Transport Authority, a statutory board of the Government of Singapore, which allocates operating concessions to the profit-based corporations SMRT Corporation and SBS Transit. These operators also run bus and taxi services, thus ensuring that there is a full integration of public transport services. The MRT is complemented by the regional Light Rail Transit (LRT) systems that link MRT stations with HDB public housing estates. Services operate from about 5:30 am and usually end before 1 am daily with frequencies of approximately three to eight minutes, and services extended during festive periods. 8:44 Part 1 of 3: Banned in Singapore: Video of Dr Lim Hock Siew Part 1 of 3.

Because in the material world, for the maintenance of equilibrium of the society, sometimes killing is necessary. Just like fight, war. When the enemy has come to your country, you cannot sit idly; you must fight. But that does not mean that you are allowed to kill everyone as you like. That is a special circumstances when fighting must be there. Therefore the ksatriyas are required to give protection. Like the government is keeping military, police, soldiers, that does not mean government is after killing only. That department will be utilized when there is necessity, not that government is meant for killing. Government has other departments also. But this is also maintained. If there is necessity, it should be utilized. So Krsna, when He is on the battlefield, that was a necessity. He has got two business. Paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam. Those who are demons, those who are disturbing elements, they should be killed. And those who are honest and peaceful, they should be maintained. But because it is material world, the world of duality, there are good and evil, so you have to curb down the evil. Sometimes force is required. So that killing is not bad. When the enemy is aggressive and you are killing, that killing and poor animal who is supplying milk... You are drinking milk, your mother, and you are killing. This killing and that killing is not the same thing.

Market Structures and Public Transport Policy in Singapore: The different modes of public transport in Singapore operate under different market structures, evolving with the needs of the commuters. In the early 1960s, public bus services operated in a monopolistic competition market as opposed to the duopolistic structure today. The mass rapid transit (MRT) system started off with a monopoly before evolving to a duopoly today. With lower barriers to entry and more firms entering the market, taxi services operate in an oligopoly. Find out why each industry is shaped as such and how they fit into the market structure continuum, and why government intervention is necessary. 4:18 Part 3 of 3: Banned in Singapore: Video of Dr Lim Hock Siew Part 3 of 3.

Kenneth Jeyaretnam, whose late father and veteran opposition leader was bankrupted in defamation lawsuits by the ruling People&apos;s Action Party (PAP), said his two-year-old Reform Party was encouraging people to come out and offer different views.&quot;Firstly, do not be afraid. You have a right to exercise, to have a say, in how your country is run,&quot;Jeyaretnam told Reuters in an interview.&quot;Singapore is not going to collapse. Competition in politics is as necessary as it is in economics to ensure efficiency.&quot;Jeyaretnam, 51, who graduated from Cambridge in 1983 with double-first class honours in economics and once ran a London-based hedge fund, said his party was aiming for the same audience as the PAP in the next election, due by February 2012. Jeyaretnam said he would focus his political campaign on offering alternative policies rather than attacking personalitities in the PAP or the government. The Reform Party proposes the possible privatisation of Singapore&apos;s two multi-billion dollar state wealth funds -- Government of Singapore Investment Corp and Temasek -- to allow more transparency. Jeyaretnam would keep taxes low to make Singapore a top investment destination, but said a wider healthcare system was needed to deal with an ageing population. 5:29 Eating in Singapore Locally (Hawker Center Scenes in Singapore) scenes from the oriental food courts in Singapore.

The once economically bright island city is coming to terms with the reality of the global economic crisis. STORY: Singapore&apos;s rapid development pace has been built on the backs of migrant workers from the region, who for decades have worked in the shipping and construction industries. But the economic reality is that this island city, once a major success story in Asia, is facing tough times. Singapore&apos;s founder and former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew is saying the economy could shrink by as much as 10 percent this year. Worse affected by the economic downturn are migrant workers as massive construction projects are halted or companies are simply unable to make ends meet. John Gee, head of Transient Workers Count Too, a Singapore-based organization dedicated to looking after the welfare of migrant workers, says many more workers have been coming to them for help in the past few months. [John Gee, President,&quot;Transient Workers Count Too&amp;#8221;]:&quot;Most workers who come here, they fulfill their contracts, they go home. It&apos;s not a big problem, but definitely in the economic crisis, we are seeing more employers being squeezed for cash and among the first victims will be migrant workers. They look where they can make the cut and that&apos;s what happens. So, first of all a payment runs late and then it becomes non-payment.&quot;The organization runs a&quot;Free Meal Program&quot;every weekday for breakfast and&lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt; 10:37 Economics of Land Transport in Singapore - Managing Traffic Congestion in Singapore Jointly developed by LTA and MOE and launched in August 2010 for A&apos;Levels Economics st... published: 11 May 2011 author: LTAsingapore Economics of Land Transport in Singapore - Managing Traffic Congestion in Singapore Jointly developed by LTA and MOE and launched in August 2010 for A&apos;Levels Economics students, this is the last of a series of four case study videos that illustrate how economic concepts and principles apply to the land transport system in Singapore.
