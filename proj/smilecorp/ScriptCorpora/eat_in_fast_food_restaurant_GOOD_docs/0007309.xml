Improving Interstate 64’s Exit 91 interchange in Fishersville is critical to the area’s economic future and must become a VDOT priority, leaders and business people said.

Beyond economics, it’s a public safety issue, House District 25 Del. Steve Landes said.

The interchange is a primary artery off the interstate for nearby Augusta Health, which steadily has grown since opening in the mid-1990s.

There are also trucking companies, fast food restaurants , new residential developments and Augusta Expoland close to the interchange, as well as increasing traffic–transportation officials estimate the current volume of 16,600 vehicles per day north of the ramps will double by 2035.

“It’s critical the (I-64) bridge be widened so people can get to the hospital,”said Landes , R- Weyers Cave , who is one of three members of the local legislative delegation to write Gov. Bob McDonnell about prioritizing the project. Landes emphasized the hospital location in his letter.

Still, not a solitary shovelful of dirt has been turned.

Discussion about the Exit 91 project started about a decade ago, but engineering only was authorized in 2007. The work includes a total replacement and the widening to four lanes of the bridge over I-64 at the exit, as well as expanding Route 285, or Tinkling Spring Road, to four lanes with turn lanes from Expo Road to just beyond Goose Creek Road.

The Virginia Department of Transportation , using a 2018 estimate, calculated the Exit 91 project cost at $35.6 million .

Under the best-case scenario, VDOT officials said, construction would not start until 2013 and would finish in 2015.

The stalled project’s impact on the local economy can be found a short distance from Exit 91 at the corner of Expo Road.

Charlottesville-based Southern Development owns 100 acres of land there and has sold other adjacent parcels to a hotel developer , a convenience store and a fast food restaurant .

But Charlie Armstrong , the vice president of land development for the company, said something needs to happen with the I-64 bridge for significant movement to occur on the property.

 Armstrong said“larger commercial users need infrastructure improvement before committing to locating here.”

In recent weeks, local leaders have lobbied VDOT and state officials in Richmond about the project.

 Landes and two other members of the area’s legislative delegation have written McDonnell , asking him to make Exit 91 a priority, particularly in light of the recent news of VDOT finding $1.4 billion in unspent funds.

 Sen. Emmett Hanger , R- Mount Solon , said a large portion of the money was not spent because of $654 million in federal stimulus money the state received. Millions of dollars in maintenance and construction money went unused because VDOT pulled back on spending, he said.

Those who own businesses along Tinkling Spring said the construction can’t happen soon enough.

“This is vitally important for the well-being of the county,”said Jim Bailey , a former Augusta County supervisor and vice president of safety and human resources for Wilson Trucking , located just off Tinkling Spring.

 Bailey said his truckers carefully avoid the bottlenecks that form at the interchange during the morning and afternoon rush hours.

Augusta Health officials said traffic at the hospital on Goose Creek Road just off Tinkling Spring has grown dramatically since the facility opened in 1994.

“This is the main artery and feeds one of the largest growing areas in the county,”said Kathleen Heatwole , vice president for planning and development for Augusta Health .

 Heatwole said the hospital’s outpatient visits alone now number more than 500,000 annually, and Augusta is the area’s largest employer with 1,700 full-time workers.

 Augusta County economic development officials met with VDOT and Virginia’s secretary of transportation two weeks ago to see if the project could be
prioritized.

Augusta County Economic Development Director Dennis Burnette said no commitment was made, but the county is in a strong position when construction money becomes available.

Getting local projects on the front burner long has been a battle given the attention demanded by clogged roads in Northern Virginia.

 Wayne District Supervisor Wendell Coleman said Augusta County has continued to“lean on VDOT”to get the project done.

 Coleman said that in addition to the comings and goings at busy Augusta Health, at least seven independent trucking companies use the I-64 Exit 91 interchange.

 Tim Fitzgerald , director of community development for Augusta County , pointed out that the interchange is also close to UPS, FedEx and other commercial properties, such as Sheetz and McDonald’s.

 Landes said area legislators have told the Commonwealth Transportation Board for years of the importance of the Exit 91 project.

The 17-member board gives approval to VDOT-recommended projects, as well as locating routes and approving funding for airports and seaports.

“Unfortunately, the transportation board has not found it (the project) a higher priority than they have,” Landes said.

 Landes said the project is more cost-effective than other highway projects in the commonwealth.

 Hanger said while there have been some incremental improvements on Virginia roads, they have not been adequately addressed.

 Hanger considers Exit 91 the top priority in his senate district and said he will follow up with transportation board members on the upgrade.
