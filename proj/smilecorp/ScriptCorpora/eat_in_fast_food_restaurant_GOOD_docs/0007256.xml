 This is the place where you can personalize your profile!
But, how? 
 By moving, adding and personalizing widgets. You can drag and drop to rearrange. You can edit widgets to customize them. The bottom has widgets you can add! Some widgets you can only access when you get a premium membership. Some widgets have options that are only available when you get a premium membership. 
 

 We&apos;ve split the page into zones! 
 Certain widgets can only be added to certain zones. &quot;Why,&quot; you ask? Because we want profile pages to have freedom of customization, but also to have some consistency. This way, when anyone visits a deviant, they know they can always find the art in the top left, and personal info in the top right. Don&apos;t forget, restraints can bring out the creativity in you! 
 

 Now go forth and astound us all with your devious profiles!

 Sorry to spam your inboxes, this is more or less a reminder for myself. It&apos;s my project list of art trades, requests and whatnot. Anyway, what do you guys think of the new icon? It&apos;s my first time doing pixel art, so it didn&apos;t come out all that good I&apos;ll see how it goes for a week, and if not, I&apos;ll go back to the old icon Thank you to ~ byaburry for the base!

The doctor said that if they took you out, I would die, because i couldn&apos;t live with out such a good friend. Give this heart to everyone you don&apos;t want to lose in 2012 including me if you care. Try to collect twelve, it is not easy. Be honest and send this to anyone who made you smile this year.

Hey, it says in your signiture about art trades or comissions. If you&apos;re up for a comission, would you do it for points? If not, art trade?
