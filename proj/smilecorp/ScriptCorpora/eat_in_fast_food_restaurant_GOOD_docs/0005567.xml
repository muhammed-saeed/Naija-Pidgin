 it could be, however some fast food restaurants do offer healthier choices to the public. a women ate McDonald&apos;s salads for a month everyday and ended up losing something like 30 pounds. it depends on the kind of fast food you eat if its a burger and fries every single day you are going to gain weight and become at risk to health problems. fast food and home cooked meals in my opinion are completely different.my mom makes sure that we sit down as a family every night for a homemade meal. this is a social opportunity as well. most people are over weight because most convenience foods just happen to be unhealthy (a.k.a fast food restaurants). some people are just to busy to have a home cooked meal everyday so they go to a fast food restaurant. they do have and option to make a healthy choice of ordering a salad though.

 I do not think is fast food.. it is the life style of people what really makes them gain weight. We are getting too comfortable and we get things really easily without making an effort. Therefore, people are getting lazy, unproductive and fat. Fast food, or any food that is not rich in esential nutrients, combined with lack of motion and exercise and routine is what puts people&apos;s health in risk.

 Young adults who frequently eat fast food are far more likely to gain weight and develop type 2 diabetes than those who don&apos;t, researchers at the University of Minnesota, Children&apos;s Hospital in Boston, and elsewhere have found.&apos;&apos;While this sounds like a no-brainer, there really isn&apos;t much science at all&quot;linking fast-food diets to an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, said Mark Pereira, assistant professor of epidemiology in the University of Minnesota&apos;s School of Public Health.&apos;&apos;It could be argued that this is a first-of-its-kind study.&quot;In the 15-year study, published in the current issue of the British journal, The Lancet, Pereira and his colleagues found that 3,000 young adults who consumed fast food more than twice a week gained 10 additional pounds and had twice the risk of develop diabetes than those who ate fast food less than once a week.&apos;&apos;The more frequently they went to these restaurants, the worse their diets were,&quot;Pereira said. Super-sized meals are&apos;&apos;a bargain for the wallet but not for the waistline or the emergency room.&quot;Eating at Fast-food Restaurants More than Twice Per Week is Associated with More Weight Gain and Insulin Resistance in Otherwise Healthy Young Adults
Young adults who eat frequently at fast-food restaurants gain more weight and have a greater increase in insulin resistance in early middle age, according to a large multi-center study funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and published in the January 1 issue of The Lancet*.

After 15 years, those who ate at fast-food restaurants more than twice each week compared to less than once a week had gained an extra ten pounds and had a two-fold greater increase in insulin resistance, a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Diabetes is a major risk factor for heart disease.

“Obesity and diabetes are on the rise in this country and this important study highlights the value of healthy eating habits,” said NHLBI Acting Director Barbara Alving, M.D.

Fast-food consumption has increased in the United States over the past three decades. “It’s extremely difficult to eat in a healthy way at a fast-food restaurant. Despite some of their recent healthful offerings, the menus still tend to include foods high in fat, sugar and calories and low in fiber and nutrients,” said lead author Mark Pereira, Ph.D., assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Minnesota. People need to evaluate how often they eat meals at fast-food restaurants and think about cutting back, according to Pereira.

One reason for the weight gain may be that a single meal from one of these restaurants often contains enough calories to satisfy a person’s caloric requirement for an entire day.

Participants were asked during the physical examinations given as part of the study how often they ate breakfast, lunch or dinner at fast-food restaurants. Researchers found that the adverse impact on participants’ weight and insulin resistance was seen in both blacks and whites who ate frequently at fast-food restaurants, even after adjustment for other lifestyle habits.

Study participants included 3,031 young black and white adults who were between the ages of 18 and 30 in 1985-1986. The participants, who were part of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, received dietary assessments over a 15-year period. CARDIA centers are located in Birmingham, AL, Chicago, IL, Minneapolis, MN, and Oakland, CA.

According to the study, men visited fast-food restaurants more frequently than women and blacks more frequently than whites. Black men reported an average frequency of 2.3 visits per week in 2000-01. White women had the lowest frequency, at an average of 1.3 visits per week in 2000-01.

“It is important to watch carefully what you eat, especially at a fast-food restaurant. Knowing the nutritional content is important. Consumers may want to ask for this information,” said NHLBI’s Gina Wei, M.D., project officer for CARDIA. Salads and grilled foods tend to be lower in fat than fried foods, she said.

Keep portion sizes small, and ask that high-fat sauces and condiments, such as salad dressing and mayonnaise, be “on the side” and use them sparingly to reduce calories, Wei said.

Super Size Me is a 2004 documentary film, directed by and starring Morgan Spurlock, an American independent filmmaker. It follows a time period in which he eats only McDonald&apos;s fast food, three times a day, every day, for thirty days, eating everything on the McDonald&apos;s menu at least once—and stops exercising regularly—and it documents the physical and psychological effects this has upon him. In addition, Spurlock explores the corporate influence of the fast food industry and how it encourages poor nutrition for its own profit.

Spurlock, age 33, was healthy and slim, with a body weight of 185.5 lb (84.1 kg). Spurlock&apos;s height is 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m). After thirty days, he gained 24.5 lb (11.1 kg), an increase of 13% of his body mass; his Body Mass Index raised from 23.2 (within the&apos;healthy&apos;range of 19-25) to 27 (&apos;overweight&apos;). He also experienced mood swings, sexual dysfunction, and nearly catastrophic liver damage. It took fourteen months to lose the weight he gained and return to normal.

The driving factor for Spurlock&apos;s investigation was the increasing spread of obesity throughout U.S. society, which the Surgeon General has declared&quot;epidemic&quot;, and the corresponding lawsuit brought against McDonald&apos;s on behalf of two overweight girls, who, it was claimed, became obese as a result of eating too much McDonald&apos;s food. Spurlock points out that, although the lawsuit against McDonald&apos;s failed, much of the same criticism of the tobacco companies applies to fast food franchises.

The film opened in the U.S. on May 7, 2004, and grossed a total of $28,548,087 worldwide, making it the 7th highest grossing documentary film[1]. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary, but lost to the film Born into Brothels.

In February 2005, Super Size Me Educationally Enhanced DVD edition was released. It is an edited version of the film designed to be integrated into a high school health curriculum.

The experiment

As the film begins, Spurlock is physically above average, as attested to by three doctors (a cardiologist, a gastroenterologist, and a general practitioner), whom he enlists to track his health during the month-long binge. All three predict the&quot;McMonth&quot;will have unwelcome effects on his body, but none expect anything too drastic, one citing the human body as being&quot;extremely adaptable&quot;.

Spurlock starts the month with a McBreakfast near his home in Manhattan, where there is one McDonald&apos;s per ¼ mi² (0.6 km²). The month also sees an increase in his use of taxis, as he aims to keep the distances he walks in line with the 5000 steps walked per day by the average American. Spurlock has several rules which govern his eating habits:

He must eat three McDonald&apos;s meals a day.
He must sample every item on the McDonald&apos;s menu at least once.
He must only ingest items on the menu. Bottled water is on the menu, so he may drink it.
He must&quot;Super Size&quot;his meal whenever the option is offered.
He must have a salad every 10th day.
Day 2 brings Spurlock&apos;s first Super Size meal, which happened to be a Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese meal, which he spends almost an hour eating. He experiences steadily increasing discomfort during the process, which culminates in Spurlock vomiting in the car park.

After five days Spurlock has gained almost 10 pounds (5 kg). It is not long before he finds himself with a feeling of depression, and not much longer until he finds his bouts of depression, lethargy and headaches are relieved by a McDonald&apos;s meal. One doctor describes him as&quot;addicted&quot;. He has soon gained another 10 pounds, putting his weight at 203 lb (92 kg). By the end of the month he weighs about 210 lb (95.5 kg), an increase of almost 25 lb (11 kg). Because he could only eat McDonald&apos;s food for a month, Spurlock refused to take any medication at all.

Spurlock&apos;s girlfriend, Alexandra Jamieson, attests to the fact that Spurlock has lost much of his energy and sex drive during his experiment. It was not clear at the time if Spurlock would be able to complete the full month of the high-fat, high-carb diet, and friends and family began to express worry.

Around day 20, Spurlock experiences heart palpitations. Consultation with his concerned general practitioner, Dr Daryl Isaacs, reveals that Spurlock&apos;s liver is&quot;pâté&quot;, and the doctor advises him to stop what he is doing immediately to avoid any serious heart problems. He compares Spurlock with the protagonist in the movie Leaving Las Vegas who deliberately drinks himself to death over a similar time period. Despite this warning, Spurlock decides to continue the experiment. He later stated in an interview that he was inspired to do so by his brother who, when Spurlock confided his doubts about continuing, responded,&quot;Morgan, people eat this **** their whole lives!&quot;

Spurlock makes it to day 30 and achieves his goal. In thirty days, he&quot;Supersized&quot;his meals nine times along the way (five of which were in Texas, the state with the highest number of&quot;fat cities&quot;in the U.S., according to one study[1]). All three doctors are surprised at the degree of deterioration in Spurlock&apos;s health.

Text at the conclusion of the movie states that it took Spurlock five months to lose 20 lb (9 kg) and another nine months to return to his original weight. His girlfriend (now wife) Alexandra Jamieson, a vegan chef, began supervising his recovery with her&quot;detox diet,&quot;which became the basis for her book, entitled The Great American Detox Diet.

Spoilers end here.
[edit]
Summary
Alongside Spurlock&apos;s personal travails are interviews and sections detailing various factors that could account for the USA&apos;s high obesity rates. He discusses the lack of healthful food available in many US schools, the&quot;luring in&quot;of youth by advertising and McDonald&apos;s kid-friendly play parks and clowns, and the relationship, if any, between food companies&apos;stockholder profit and their customer health concerns.

Like Eric Schlosser&apos;s Fast Food Nation, the film alleges there is a dark side of the fast food industry.&quot;The bottom line, they&apos;re a business, no matter what they say, and by selling you unhealthy food, they make millions and no company wants to stop doing that.&quot;The lack of exercise is only partially addressed, and critics claim this would change the overall tone of the piece.

The movie ends with a rhetorical question,&quot;Who do you want to see go first, you or them?&quot;with a tombstone for Ronald McDonald as a backdrop.

In the DVD release of the movie, a short epilogue was added about McDonald&apos;s recent emphasis of healthier menu items such as salads. It is shown that these can contain even more calories than hamburgers. The movie created an idea for Spurlock, entitled 30 Days which airs on the American Cable Channel FX

[edit]
Impact
Subsequent to the showing of the film at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival, McDonald&apos;s phased out its Supersize meal option, and began offering healthier menu items in addition to its customary fare, though McDonald&apos;s denied that this was in reaction to the movie. The corporation did, however, issue a press release on their website, denouncing Spurlock&apos;s film and blaming the filmmaker for being a part of the problem, and not the solution.[2]

The film received the highest-ever opening for a documentary in Australia and, within two weeks of release, sparked a massive negative ad campaign, with an estimated cost of 1.4 million USD, from McDonald&apos;s of Australia. CEO Guy Russo described the documentary, on television commercials which aired on all major Australian networks, as being&quot;about a person who decides to overeat&quot;, and attempted to minimize Spurlock&apos;s claim of the unhealthiness of fast food by agreeing with the essential unhealthiness of their food but blaming the customer for overindulging. Russo stated to News Limited that customers had been surprised that the company had not addressed the claims. McDonald&apos;s placed a 30-second ad spot in the opening trailers of all viewings of Super Size Me and also offered to pay movie theatres to allow McDonald&apos;s employees to distribute apples to patrons as they exited the film.[citation needed]

In the United Kingdom, McDonald&apos;s placed a brief ad in the trailers of showings of the film, pointing to the website www.supersizeme-thedebate.co.uk. The ads simply stated,&quot;See what we disagree with. See what we agree with&quot;.

In April 2006, when British newspaper The Guardian distributed a free DVD of the film, McDonald&apos;s placed a full-page advert on the back, which included a telephone number for complaints.

[edit]
In popular culture
Comedian Dave Chappelle spoofed the film in a sketch called&quot;Maximize Me&quot;in his sketch comedy show, Chappelle&apos;s Show, and while it never aired on television, it is available on the DVD release of Chappelle&apos;s Show: The Lost Episodes. It has him as an already obese man eating WacArnolds for a month then at the end it shows that he has lost a lot of weight.

US comedians Whitest Kids U Know filmed a parody called Super Size Me With Whiskey where the main person attempts to drink nothing but whiskey for 30 days.

[edit]
Alternative experiments
Various similar experiments were made in response to Super Size Me, in an effort to provide alternative scenarios and/or refute the impressions made by the film. These experiments, however, were mainly balanced diets and healthy eating programs, capable of demonstrating that it is possible to eat from the McDonald&apos;s menu without upsetting one&apos;s health, but hardly capable of illustrating the healthiness of a typical McDonald&apos;s consumer&apos;s choice (the quintessential&quot;burger, Coke and fries&quot;meal). What these alternate studies do not address is the frightening alterations that occurred to Spurlock&apos;s blood chemistry and related body functions from a fast-food diet.

In the Netherlands Wim Meij, a reporter with the Algemeen Dagblad (a Dutch newspaper), performed another experiment. He also limited himself to eating at McDonald&apos;s, but instead of choosing just any meal from the menu, he chose carefully, with an emphasis on salads. However, as with Scott Caswell below, these salads were not available during Super Size Me&apos;s filming. He came out at least as healthy as he was before he started his 30-day experiment and lost 6.5 kg (14 lb) in the process[citation needed].

In New Jersey, USA, documentary filmmaker Scott Caswell also performed a similar experiment. The results of his diet can be seen in his movie, which is titled Bowling for Morgan. It can be seen for free at BowlingForMorgan.com. Like Spurlock, Caswell consumed only McDonald&apos;s food, but generally opted for the healthier choices and did not gorge himself -- a fact that Caswell oftens compares to the overeating done by Spurlock, who was often seen forcing himself to eat when he was not hungry. Over the course of the experiment, he lost 19 pounds and his cholesterol fell sharply. It should be pointed out, however, that Caswell&apos;s film depicted him eating many Premium Salads from McDonald&apos;s that were not available during the making of Super Size Me. Caswell never itemizes his meals, spells out nutritional information on any of his choices, says how much he is eating a day, or reveals any other details of his experiment.

Soso Whaley, of Kensington, New Hampshire, made her own film about dieting at McDonald&apos;s, called Me and Mickey D. The film follows Whaley as she spends three 30-day periods on the diet. She dropped from 175 to 139 pounds, eating 2,000 calories a day at McDonald&apos;s. The film was funded by the Competitive Enterprise Institute (Whaley holds a C.E.I. fellowship).

Raleigh, North Carolina resident Merab Morgan went on a 90-day diet in which she ate at McDonald&apos;s exclusively, but she limited her intake to 1,400 calories (5,900 kilojoules) per day. She lost 37 pounds in the process.

San Antonio, Texas resident Deshan Woods went on a 90-day diet in which he lost nearly 14 pounds. He documented the entire experiment on his website [[[3]]]. His overall health improved while sticking to a diet mainly in burgers and fries. He stayed away from sugary drinks and stuck to non-caloric beverages instead. His average caloric intake was 2,500 a day, which included 130 grams of fat. His cholesterol dropped from 204 to around 160.

By way of comparison, the Starvation Study conducted at the University of Minnesota in 1944-45 used a starvation diet of approximately 1570 calories a day on conscientious objectors for six months, causing an average 25% loss in body weight, simulating the loss of residents of the Warsaw Ghetto. The starvation study found for purposes of weight loss—and subsequent weight gain—it really did not matter what food one ate: what mattered was how many calories one ate. Of course, the focus of that study was not on blood chemistry, cholesterol, or liver function.

Professor James Painter, chair of Eastern Illinois University’s School of Family and Consumer Sciences, made the documentary Portion Size Me. The film follows two graduate students, one a 254-pound male and the other a 108-pound female, as they ate a fast-food diet for a month but in portions appropriate for their size. Both students lost weight and their cholesterol improved by the end of the experiment.

The bottom line is that people need to use common sense. If they demand healthy choices by not buying the unhealthy ones, fast food restaurants will be forced to offer better choices. Believe it or not, we do have the ability to say no and/or cook at home. Restaurants should not be held liable, because customers make bad choices over and over again. They stuff their faces with high-fat, high-cholesterol, and low-fiber foods, don&apos;t exercise, and expect to win lawsuits againt these companies. At what point, will they take responsibility for their own actions? I cook, and as far as I am concerned they will make their money on someone else.

 Fast food does make people gain weight. also its bad to have it almost everyday of the week. I was studying it in High School and a Teacher of mine was comparing an old person with a clean heart to a younger person with a scabby heart. The reason why the younger person had a scab like heart was because he had eaten fast food almost everyday of his life, as oppose to the Old man who ate healthy meals and exercised on a daily basis.

 I think the fast food business is ruining the American public every day diet. In homes were both parents work, or even single parent homes. People find it much easier to just stop and get a meal to take home for their family,&gt;Rather than preparing a meal. But that is what leads to over weight people and even children. There are way to many people who eat fast food on a daily bases. I would rather cook meals ahead of time and freeze them, or use the crock pot to make healthy meals for my family.
Yes I like the taste of fast food. But I only eat it in moderation. Maybe twice a month. It makes no sense to eat fast high calorie food. And then have to work twice as hard at the gym to keep the weight of. Plus I do believe that home made meals do taste better.

 trans fat,saturated fat are few of the bad constituents of our fast meals. so if life is running so fast and we should follow its pace by all means,we could always prepare our food at home ( in the fast way too) without making our life pass so fast too

 I don&apos;t think that fast food necessarily makes someone over weight its actually how much you comsume! And lots of people don&apos;t have homemade meals as they think that they are too busy in there life-so stopping at a fast food joint is easier for them.

 NO IT DOES NOT

As an individual who worked in restaurants for years, and had most of daily meals there i did not gain a pound.

For the fats do not gain your weight, may damage your health though.

A lot of kids today are not as active that of kids in the 70&apos;s,
look at kids that are very active a lot of them eat chips drink pop (non diet) eat fast food and such , but they are active.
Weight is gained on the individual for inactivity I have seen fat vegetarians(won&apos;t eat meat) but never stopped the chips and pop though.

Fact is no matter what research you do, each body is different.
A guy I know was born to fat parents (big boned as well) They were already big he cannot no matter what he tries to do can get rid of all the fat because of his body size demands some fat tissue.

When you eat at fast food places what you choose will effect your health, home cooked meals can be just as fattening, on how they are prepared. To much pasta can create fat when the carbohydrates are turned to sugar and stored. But for a very active individual, it creates energy, for a lazy person it turns to fat unless you have a high metabolism.

There are healthy alternatives in fast fod industry that is not a negative to your health, but you can eat healthy, but sitting around and not being active can cause weight gain.

The less fatty foods period will be more beneficial to your health.
But sitting around and being inactive is not beneficial to your health either.

As it is said a good balance of diet and excersize is the best for your health.

So if you eat a lot of fatty foods better be more active to burn the fight, or suffer the consequences.

And there is a difference of walking to work and enjoyable recreation.
