10 Best Japanese Fast Food Chains
         posted by John Spacey , Japan Talk, February 10, 2012 

 Japan has dozens of unique fast food chains — these are the best.


1. Yoshinoya
 Yoshinoya is a chain of beef bowl (gyūdon) restaurants in Japan. It&apos;s more popular with men than women. Every lunch hour, Yoshinoya is filled with white collar and blue collar workers. Everyone focuses on eating and conversation is kept to a minimum.

It&apos;s Japan&apos;s most unique and tasty fast food experience. Yoshinoya also has restaurants in the US and Asia but they&apos;re quite different.

 


2. Matsuya
Matsuya is one of Japan&apos;s biggest fast food chains with 833 locations. It&apos;s a fierce competitor of Yoshinoya — its main dish is also beef bowl. It also serves curry rice dishes.

Foreigner&apos;s are less likely to go to Matsuya (mainly because its sign has no English). However, it&apos;s just as good as Yoshinoya.

 


3. Freshness Burger
Locals often just call it Freshness. Freshness Burger has both huge burgers and tiny burgers. It also has decent coffee and vegetarian items.

Unlike many Japanese fast food chains, Freshness isn&apos;t cheap with condiments. There are usually around 20 full sized condiment containers available. Condiments include standard items like mustard, ketchup, Tabasco and mayo but also includes a series of exotic sauces.

 


4. MOS Burger
MOS Burger&apos;s thing is loading burgers with sauce and toppings. They put wax paper around the burger but it&apos;s challenging to eat without loosing half the toppings.

 


5. Lotteria
Lotteria started out in Japan in 1972 and expanded to South Korea in 1979. It was more successful in South Korea — its the number one fast food chain with a 45% market share. In Japan, McDonald&apos;s is number one.

Lotteria serves hamburgers, teriyaki burgers and shrimp burgers. They change the menu on a regular basis.

 


6. Sukiya
Sukiya is another good beef bowl chain with over 1000 locations in every prefecture of Japan.

 


7. First Kitchen
Locals call First Kitchen — &quot;Fakkin&quot;. Yes, it&apos;s pronounced like the f-word. First Kitchen have 126 restaurants in Japan. Most of them are in the greater Tokyo area.

The menu is strange for people who are accustomed to American fast food. They have burgers but also have things like pizza, pasta, and fried chicken.

 


8. Jef
Jef is a fast food chain that has 5 locations on the main island of Okinawa.

Okinawan food is known for it&apos;s use of bitter melon (goya) — a very bitter tasting green vegetable. Jef&apos;s menu includes several exotic menu items made from bitter melon including goya burger, goya rings, goya juice and goya omelets.

They also have normal burgers.

 


9. CoCo Ichiban
A large chain of curry rice restaurants.

 


10. Tenya
A tempura rice chain with 110 stores (mostly in Tokyo).
