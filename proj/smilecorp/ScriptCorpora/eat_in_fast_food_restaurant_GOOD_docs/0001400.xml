McDonald&apos;s have come a long way since they first began in the 1970&apos;s, as they are now totally upfront about ingredients inside their food. There has been a lot said about the lack of company ethics but of course they have denied all allegations.

McDonalds first came to the UK in 1974, in South London. And had continued to grow across the UK since then, there are now around 1250 McDonalds in the UK!!! 

Now, McDonalds is like I said one of the most popular fast food restaurants in the world, but in recent years the stores have changed dramatically, reducing fat and salt in their meals, and putting...
