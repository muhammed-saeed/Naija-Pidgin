Overview - EDMARK FUNCTIONAL WORD SERIES PROGRAM


The comprehensive Edmark Functional Word Series teaches students 400 basic functional words which are helpful for independent living. Each of four categories is divided into two modules teaching 50 words at a time. Each category includes 100 vocabulary words with 300 reproducible activities. A total of 1,200 reproducible activities provide students with various forms of exercises to promote retention.

The series incorporates the proven Edmark Reading Program&apos;s multisensory technique to teach 400 functional words. The program teaches sight words from each of the four categories:

 Signs Around You 
Teaches community information and protection vocabulary.

 Fast Food/Restaurant Words 
Teaches fast food or restaurant-menu words.

 Grocery Words 
Teaches common grocery item terms.

 Job/Work Words 
Teaches common workplace terms.

Teachers will find teaching suggestions throughout the series. Models provide cuing suggestions to help students retain and comprehend vocabulary. Also includes scores of extension activities and reinforcement suggestions. The lessons are neatly divided and separated by index tabs.

Components
-Word recognition activities
-Posttests
-Worksheets
-Record keeping forms
-Vinyl Display Mask (used for lessons and posttests)

In each lesson, students learn sight words, practice sight recognition, reinforce that recognition, and associate the word with its meanings through illustrations. To reinforce retention, sight words are presented in several formats: uppercase, uppercase and lowercase, and all lowercase letters. The short steps and multiple repetitions used throughout the program also reinforce learning.

Another reinforcement tool is the use of worksheets. The 400 worksheets stimulate interest while promoting comprehension. The worksheets are designed to improve work habits, review the words so they are reinforced, and demonstrate understanding or meaning of the word or phrase. The worksheets are also great for students who are disabled. Students learn to follow directions, stay on task, increase fine motor skills, and improve&quot;paper and pencil&quot;tasks. Teachers can also trace student progress with these practical worksheets.

Sample vocabulary students learn include:
-Telephone
-Taxi
-Do Not Enter
-No Smoking
-Poison
-Pizza
-Cheese
-Chicken
-Biscuit
-Bacon
-Tuna
-Shampoo
-Flour
