 Alternative Dining Experience Restaurants Management L.L.C., a leader in alternative and innovative dining concepts, has announced that it has started exploratory talks with several GCC entrepreneurs and investors to open new outlets of Dukkan Falafel in different cities across the region, during its participation at Gulfood 2012 in Dubai. Alternative Dining further revealed that it is pursuing an aggressive expansion drive in the GCC to take advantage of the robust growth forecast of the region’s fast-food restaurant industry, with the UAE and Saudi markets alone expected to sustain a 5 per cent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in sales from 2010 to 2014.

Dukkan Falafel, the home-grown UAE-based fast-food franchise, currently has 18 outlets under development in the UAE, in addition to seven outlets that are already open. Dukkan Falafel will open more new outlets in the first quarter of 2012, while outlets in Enoc Ghusais, Khalifa City, Abu Dhabi and in Sports City, Dubai will open in March this year. Another outlet in Al Ain will open in the second quarter of 2012.

Rami Wardeh, CEO and Co-Founder of Alternative Dining, said: “Dukkan Falafel continues to attract new investors because of its unique business model and innovative fast-food dining concept. Moreover, Dukkan Falafel has gained a loyal and fast-growing customer base propelled by the company’s commitment to use the best-quality ingredients. These key attributes, combined with the excellent growth forecast of the GCC’s restaurant industry, has certainly opened more exciting possibilities that will sustain our growth plans in the GCC. In this regard, the Gulfood 2012 exhibition provides an ideal networking platform for Alternative Dining to reach out to more potential investors and strategic partners in the region.”

Alternative Dining established itself as a leader in introducing the unique Falafel fast food franchise concept in the UAE with the launch of the Dukkan Falafel brand, which has been gaining ground as a favourite dining destination in the UAE. Dukkan Falafel has remained highly competitive in the fast food chain market with its wide selection of food choices that are prepared with the freshest and best-quality ingredients. The growing popularity of Dukkan Falafel has attracted new investors, particularly the middle and high-income group who are actively looking for high-potential investment schemes.

Alternative Dining Experience Restaurant Management L.L.C, established in 2009, operates, manages and franchises restaurants, and has ventured into the luxury segment of catering in the UAE. The company’s strategy is to differentiate its restaurants by emphasizing consistently on high-quality food and service, serving generous portions at moderate prices in distinctly designed restaurants.
