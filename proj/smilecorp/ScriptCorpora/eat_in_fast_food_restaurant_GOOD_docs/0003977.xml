 The Decaf Dilemma : 
 I enjoy eating breakfast around town but I encounter a frequent problem: wait 
 staff with good intentions refill my decaf coffee with regular 
 caffeinated brew. For example. last weekend I ate at one of my favorite 
 breakfast haunts Cajun Kitchen . The food is terrific as is the service. However, 
 when my decaf cup was half full, the coffee guy came over and filled it 
 with the regular stuff. I had to request they take it away and give me 
 just decaf. A few minutes later, when my decaf cup was empty, a 
 different wait person arrived and filled it with caffeinated coffee 
 again. I again had to ask they take it away and bring me a cup of decaf. 
 This problem happens nearly every time I eat breakfast at an average 
 priced eatery on the South Coast - except for a few restaurants such as Farmer Boy and Alphies . 
 These restaurants have come up with an elegant solution to this problem and my 
 cup is always refilled with decaf. They put an orange paper doily under the coffee cup for anyone who orders 
 decaf. When the coffee guy or gal roams for refills, they know exactly 
 what I am drinking. I highly encourage all Cajun Kitchens (and other 
 restaurants) to use this simple solution to 
 a frequent problem for decaffers like myself.

 New Name : 
 Reader Foodie Dan let me know that Maria&apos;s Italian Kitchen has 
 changed their name to Milano Italian Kitchen . Everything else has stayed the same 
 including management and menu.

 Last Day Of The Survey : 
 Today is the last day of 2007 which also means it is the last day to get 
 in your votes for the Santa Barbara Survey 2008 . 
 If you haven&apos;t done so already, fill out the form today!

 Cafe (La Cumbre Plaza) and N oodle

 Santa Barbara Survey : 
 The second annual Santa Barbara Survey of your favorite places for food&amp;drink is almost over. The online survey runs from Thanksgiving to New 
 Years and the results will be displayed in the this restaurant guide 
 throughout 2008. Winners receive a glossy, customized 11x14 award poster 
 hand-delivered by yours truly (I made over 70 deliveries last year). 
 Recently I asked readers if any new categories should be created for the 
 2008 survey and this resulted in six additions:&quot;Best Bargain,&quot;&quot;Best 
 Place for a First Date,&quot;&quot;Best Place for Large Groups,&quot;&quot;Best Place for 
 Cheese,&quot;&quot;Best Place for Chocolate,&quot;and a new grand prize category:&quot;Best Overall Restaurant.&quot;The Santa Barbara Survey 2008 is online at SantaBarbara.com/survey through Monday.

 The Real Thing : 
 A lot of people were upset when Coca-Cola changed their 
 formula in the 1980&apos;s and created&quot;New Coke.&quot;This product was a 
 flop and was quickly discontinued. But many people don&apos;t realize 
 that the Coca-Cola Company dramatically and permanently changed 
 the taste of their famous soft drink in the 1970&apos;s without so 
 much as a peep of complaint from the general public. This flavor 
 alteration occurred when Coca-Cola switched from sugar to 
 corn syrup as their primary sweetener. When you buy a can of 
 Coca-Cola Classic,&quot;Classic&quot;really means&quot;post-1970&apos;s.&quot;Is is 
 possible to still find a bottle of The Real Thing? The answer is 
 yes and you have Mexico to thank for it. Mexico, and 
 several other countries, have continued to use sugar as the 
 primary sweetener in Coca-Cola. Take a sip of this 
 south-of-the-border soft drink and you will experience REAL 
 Coca-Cola Classic. It tastes quite a bit different from the 
 flavor we are all used to and there is a growing movement 
 to officially reintroduce&quot;Classic&quot;Classic Coke in the United 
 States. Coca-Cola from Mexico has been available at small 
 eateries and markets throughout the U.S. but it has always been 
 hard to locate and expensive. Until now. Costco has 
 officially introduced Mexican-made Coca-Cola in their stores 
 throughout the nation and it is significantly less expensive 
 than what Mom&amp;Pop charge. So go to Costco today and&quot;Have a 
 Coke and a Smile.&quot;

 Merry Christmas! My column in this week&apos;s Daily Sound happened to 
 fall on the Christmas holiday so it will instead appear in tomorrow&apos;s 
 paper.

 Santa Center Update : 
 I have been so swamped here at the Santa Claus Call Center I won&apos;t have 
 much restaurant news until after Christmas. There is photograph of 
 call center volunteers Mady Widyasurya , Erin O&apos;Connor &amp; Fallon 
 Leung on the front 
 page of the Los Angeles Times today. Yesterday anchor Fredricka Whitfield at CNN did a story about the call center ( see 
 video ). I have created a web site with pictures of all the 
 volunteers and more information (such as what toys were most popular). 
 It is online at AccidentalSanta.org . Merry 
 Christmas!

 Santa Center Update : 
 I have been so swamped here at the Santa Claus Call Center I won&apos;t have 
 much restaurant news until after Christmas. The volunteers have been 
 absolutely amazing - true heroes. Some have been talking to 50-60 
 children per *hour*. It can be quite emotional too. Not every child 
 calls with a happy story and several volunteers have been moved to 
 tears. 99% of calls are sweet, adorable children excited to be talking 
 to Mr.&amp;Mrs. Claus. The calls tend to come in groups from the same area 
 code soon after a TV broadcast in that region. I love getting calls from 
 the southern part of the U.S. from children who have adorable accents 
 and call Santa&quot;Sir&quot;and Mrs. Claus&quot;Mam.&quot;And they ask a thousand 
 questions:&quot;When is Rudolph&apos;s birthday?&quot;&quot;What happens when the sleigh 
 runs out of gasoline?&quot;One child requested that Santa *not* to come to 
 their home. When I asked why, the little boy replied:&quot;I don&apos;t want 
 Rudolph to poo on our roof!&quot;
 I have launched a web site for the call center: AccidentalSanta.org . It 
 includes dozens of pictures of volunteers and web movies plus links to 
 news stories.
 I have been told that the Los Angles Times will have a story about 
 the call center any day now. CNN is planning a live 
 interview this Sunday at 1:30pm. Anchor Fredericka Whitfield will be in 
 Atlanta while I am in CNN&apos;s studio in Agoura Hills.

 We are still in need of volunteers . If you 
 think you can help, please use our Mr.&amp;Mrs. Claus signup form .

 End Of An Era : 
 A single scoop of Thrifty Ice Cream no longer costs less than a dollar. 
 When I was a kid their famous cylindrical scoops cost about a 
 dime and the price has hovered at 99 cents for much of the last 
 decade. That is until last month when a single serving broke though the 
 buck-barrier and reached $1.19 per scoop.
   The Thrifty brand has 
 been around for decades. In 1919, brothers Harry and Robert Borun founded Borun Brothers, a Los Angeles drug wholesaler. In 
 1929, they opened their own retail outlets under the name 
 Thrifty in Los Angeles. In 1996 the drug store chain was bought 
 by Rite Aid but the Thrifty brand of ice cream was retained 
 because it had won several important awards in its history.
   I asked the ice cream clerk at a local Rite Aid to tell me which flavor 
 inspires the most passion. He said&quot;When we run out of a flavor 
 people usually pick another, except in the case of Chocolate 
 Malted Crunch. If we are out of that, kids 
 fall down on the ground in a seizure and their parents quickly start looking 
 for another Rite Aid.&quot;
   A buck-nineteen for a single scoop of ice cream is still a good deal in 
 town. Baskin Robbins costs $2.79. Ben&amp;Jerry&apos;s charges $3.22. McConnell&apos;s asks for $3.34 while Cold Stone 
 Creamery commands $3.59 for a scoop. However, if you go to Great Pacific 
 Ice Cream Co. on Stearns Wharf, that spectacular 
 ambience comes at a premium. The price of a single scoop will set you back $3.75 which 
 is ironic because Great Pacific serves (you guessed it) Thrifty 
 Ice Cream. Hence the most expensive ice cream in town is also 
 the cheapest!

 Santa Claus Call 
 Center Opens : The Santa Claus Call Center 
 officially opened today at 1010 State Street. It is open December 17-24 
 8am-8pm. Here are some pictures : front window , front room , back room . The phones 
 are now ringing off the hook. The answering system in the call center 
 can handle 4000 voice mails and was full within a couple hours of the 
 interview. If you wish to volunteer to talk to kids, their are still 
 some openings on the signup form . I&apos;ll be 
 there 12 hours a day for the next 8 days, managing the center and 
 talking to children.
   I went down to NBC Studios in Burbank for two live interviews 
 about the call center yesterday. I was interviewed by MSNBC anchor Alex 
 Witt who was in New York City. Here is an online video of one of the interviews and a picture taken at 
 the studio news room .

 MSNBC : I have

 how the citizens of Santa Barbara have come together to talk to 
 children. The first will be 7:15am PT (10:15am ET) and the second will 
 be 8:30am PT (11:30am ET). I&apos;ll be at NBC Studios in Burbank for the

 Remembering Emilio DePaola : 
 I received this word today from reader Patty:&quot;I don&apos;t like being the 
 one to bring bad news but our beloved Emilio DePaola has passed 
 on ( Emilio&apos;s 
 Restaurant ). I hope you have all had the chance to know this 
 angel of a man, like I have. He was a true treasure of a man, always 
 smiling and making everyone who crossed his path feel like they were 
 life-long friends. He loved life, loved dancing, loved his family, and 
 his friends. He will be missed immensely!&quot;There will be a tribute tonight at Madisons at 9pm for Emilio, who died on Sunday of a 
 heart attack.

 Hospital during its 2007 Thanks and Giving Campaign. Domino&apos;s stores 
 are asking customers through December 31 to donate a dollar or more to 
 benefit the children of St. Jude. The goal is to raise between $3 
 million to $5 million for the hospital.

 Canary : In a 
 recent column I mentioned how the 31 West restaurant at Hotel Andaluca is getting a new name:&quot;Coast.&quot;It 
 turns out the the entire hotel will be getting a new name as well:&quot; Canary .&quot;Rumor has it that in response, the Bacara will rename themselves&quot;The Parakeet 
 Resort,&quot;Biltmore plans to be known as the&quot;Four Seasons Falcon&quot;and the 
 San Ysidro Ranch is scheduled to be called the&quot;San Ysidro 
 Yellow-billed Cuckoo.&quot;

 Noodle City 
 Open : Reader Kha let me know that Noodle City at 5869 
 Hollister Ave is now open, replacing the recently closed Asian Cafe . 

 Wine Hound : 
 Reader Steve Weixel tells me that there is a big sign in the window of 
 1221 Chapala saying&quot;Coming Soon The Wine Hound&quot;. Rumor has it 
 they are owned by wine club Vinesse , and will 
 *not* be having a tasting room, but will instead have tastings at local 
 restaurants. It is reportedly managed by the&quot;wine guy&quot;from Lazy Acres.

 Sage&amp;Onion closing tomorrow; Seagrass arrives 
 Christmas Eve : Sage&amp;Onion , after serving happy customers for nine years at 
 38 E. Ortega St, closes their doors tomorrow (Saturday) night. Opening 
 in its place on December 24th will be Seagrass , a fine dining 
 seafood restaurant brought to you by Mitchell Sjerven . A 
 twenty-five-plus year restaurant veteran, Mitchell also owns&amp;operates Bouchon Santa 
 Barbara. His passion lies in providing an authentic, regional dining 
 experience. Seagrass will be open seven nights a week, Sun-Thu 
 5:30pm-9pm and Fri-Sat 5:30pm-10pm. Chef Josh Brown , who has 
 managed the kitchen&amp;staff at Bouchon since 2003, will take on the 
 additional duty of being the executive chef at Seagrass. Brandon 
 Hughes , Bouchons sous-chef, will be chef de cuisine at Seagrass. 
 Sage&amp;Onions departing co-owners, Stephen Giles and Norbert 
 Furnee , have decided to move on to other opportunities (read about 
 it here soon). Stephen tells me that he and Norbert thoroughly enjoyed 
 serving the community for nearly a decade, helping charity events and 
 much more. Sage&amp;Onion will certainly be missed! I plan to have dinner 
 their Saturday night. It&apos;s an end of an era.

 Albertsons Closing : The Coastal 
 View News in Carpinteria reports that Albertsons market on Casitas Pass Rd is closing for good in the late spring of 
 2008. The grocery giant has been unable to renew its lease, which 
 expires this summer. Vons, located on Linden Ave in Carpinteria, is 
 considering relocating to the Albertsons site.

 Sweet Sorrow : Carvel Ice Cream , 
 in the Vons shopping center off of Fairview Ave, will not be open much 
 longer. Although they are still in operation, the space is available for 
 lease.

 Goodbye Pierre : Pierre Lafond in the Paseo Nuevo mall suddenly closed its doors for good last 
 Saturday. No word yet on what will replace it in that location. Pierre Lafond Bistro at 516 State Street is still operating normally.

 31 West Update : 31 West inside Hotel Andaluca has been undergoing a remodel and it appears that 
 the name of the restaurant is being updated as well (thank you to reader 
 Steve Weixel for providing the tip). The new name for 31 West is&quot; Coast 
 Santa Barbara &quot;which follows the naming convention of their&quot;Coast 
 Santa Monica&quot;restaurant inside Shutters On The Beach in Santa Monica. 
 Coast will have a totally new layout, new furnishings, a new entrance, a new menu and a 
 seafood bar. The opening of Coast Santa Barbara is tentatively scheduled 
 for January.

 Specials Spotlight : Neighborhood bar&amp;restaurant at 235 W. Montecito St has a food special going on

 pound cheeseburger for only $4.95. You can enjoy your food outdoors this 
 winter on their new heated patio. Call 963-7600.
 
Wednesday, December 5, 2007

 Visual Update : 
 The Cheese Shop was rumored to be coming to Paseo Nuevo early 
 December. They are definitely on their way but I would guess January 
 based on the current progress [ see 
 photo ].

 Center Of Town : 
 Suppose you wanted to dine downtown, but not just anywhere downtown - at 
 the *exact* center of town. Where would you eat? I typed&quot;Santa Barbara&quot;into Google Maps, 
 turned on&quot;satellite view&quot;and zoomed in. Upon studying the image 
 carefully I discovered that the center of town, as defined by Google, is 
 the middle of State Street near Chipotle , with Pascucci running a very close second. For Goleta, the center-of-town winner is Wendy&apos;s on 
 Hollister Ave. For Carpinteria, the center is at the Tee Time Driving 
 Range which would make nearby Surf Dog at 
 Ballard Ave the champion. Montecito&apos;s winner is China Pavilion while in Summerland  Tinker&apos;s gets the nod. And finally, in Santa Ynez, Willows at the 
 Chumash Casino appears to have won the jackpot.

 Montecito Is Jealous : 
 A residence in Carpinteria made Forbes Magazine&apos;s list of the Ten priciest U.S. home sales in 2007 . Price: $35 million. According 
 to Forbes:&quot;Hedge fund manager Bruce Kovner accumulated $83.5 million 
 worth of property in Carpinteria, Calif., which is outside of Santa 
 Barbara. The most expensive acquisition was a $35 million property that 
 sits on three acres and has a Mediterranean-style villa. The other 
 ocean-view acres include a $20 million four-bedroom house and a polo 
 field bought from actor Kevin Costner.&quot;
 
Tuesday, December 4, 2007

 Christmas Gift : China Pavilion , located at 1202 
 Chapala St and 1070 Coast Village Rd has a holiday gift card special 
 going on right now. Buy $500 worth of gift cards and receive a free $125

 a free $50 gift card. Gift cards must be in increments of $50 and the 
 offer expires at the end of the year.

 Rib $16.95, Thursday - $5 off any entree if you wear a Hawaiian shirt!

 Expansion : Williams-Sonoma in La Cumbre Plaza is planning to expand into the

 leaves at the end of the year.
 
Monday, December 3, 2007

 Coming Soon : Reader Dianne let me 
 know that the South 
 Coast Deli will be opening another location at 1436 Chapala St 
 (where Chapala crosses Micheltorena St). The previous occupant of this 
 address was Cafe La 
 Luz which closed last July.

 Renovation : California Pasta , 
 located in Paseo Nuevo Mall downtown, will be closing for two 
 months for a full remodel of the restaurant starting January 7, 2008. Apparently this location has had many years of restaurant activity with 
 very few upgrades. They will be adding all new equipment and raising the 
 overall level of appearance.

 Confectionery Of The Month : This 
 month&apos;s honorees are Jean-Michel&amp;Jill-Marie Carr, founders of Chocolats du CaliBressan that opened in Carpinteria last month. I went to their official launch 
 party last Friday night and it was packed with well-wishers enjoying 
 champagne and lots of fine chocolate. 
 
Friday, November 30, 2007

 Clean Creeks Certified : Rusty&apos;s Downtown Pizza at 232 W. Carrillo St and Rusty&apos;s Lighthouse 
 Pizza at 15 E. Cabrillo Blvd have been added to the city of 
 Santa Barbara&apos;s list of Clean Creeks Certified Businesses. Previous

 Savoy, Garrett&apos;s Whale Tail, Elements, Arigato, California Pizza

 Freebirds Delivers : 
 The popular Freebirds 
 World Burrito in Isla Vista now delivers. You can either call or 
 visit www.FreebirdsDelivery.com to place an order. Their delivery times 
 are NOT 24-hour, so check the website first before you order. You can read about this new service on the UCSB Daily Nexus web site.

 Marry Me Leyla : 
 Speaking of UCSB, I was running on the Ellwood Mesa near campus 
 yesterday and spotted a huge sign in the sand, made out of kelp, that 
 proclaims&quot; MARRY ME LEYLA &quot;[ see 
 
 photo ]. Does anyone know if Leyla said&quot;yes?&quot; Email me if you 
 know her answer!

 Four Diamond Rating : The Chumash 
 Casino Resort and its restaurant, T he 
 Willows have earned the AAA Four 
 Diamond Award. The award is given to hotels and restaurants in Southern 
 California by the Automobile Club. This is the casino and restaurant&apos;s 
 fourth consecutive year of Four Diamond status.

 La Tolteca Closed : 
 For the first time in decades there is no La Tolteca Restaurant in Santa Barbara. The original on Haley St closed about two years ago 
 and the Milpas location ended operations last month.

 Tabasco Taboo : Denny&apos;s , 
 represented locally at 3614 State St and 5677 Calle Real, has stopped 
 offering Tabasco sauce at all of their 1,500 locations. They now offer 
 an inferior&quot;Louisiana Gold&quot;that does not have the quality or flavor of 
 the legendary pepper sauce. I am sure they saved lots of money by making 
 this move but I believe it is a faux pas to use generic brands for 
 essential condiments in a restaurant. Perhaps next they will 
 switch to Kirkland Ketchup?

 As If You Care : After weeks of 
 planning, I first launched this restaurant news blog December 19, 2006, 
 which was the day before the&quot;Wrong Number Santa&quot;story broke 
 (see below). Ensuing 
 events forced me to immediately cancel this blog (and scrap all 
 the time-sensitive stories I had pre-written). I premiered this blog a second time on January 4th, 2007.

 Seeking Mr.&amp;Mrs. Claus : Some of 
 you may have heard my crazy Christmas story last year. It goes 
 like this: This web site&apos;s toll-free number 
 (1-800-SantaBarbara) that I launched late last year turned out to be 
 just one digit off from 1-800-SantaClaus . I started receiving 
 tons of misdialed calls from kids telling me their Christmas wishes. 
 Rather than play Scrooge, I played along and answered the calls all day 
 long for two weeks, pretending to be Santa. I spoke to 973 kids in all 
 and tens of thousands of kids called but couldn&apos;t get through my jammed 
 phone line. The odd story managed to find its way to newspapers all over 
 the nation, labeling me the&quot; Wrong Number Santa .&quot;I ended up 
 doing live TV interviews on Fox News, NBC News, the Today Show and spoke 
 on NPR. To top it all off, a CNN satellite truck came to my home on 
 Christmas Eve for a live interview. It was all very weird, but also very 
 fun talking to so many excited and anxious little kids.
  I am working with Montecito Bank&amp;Trust to make it happen 
 again this year. We have setup an official&quot; Santa Claus Call Center &quot;at 1010 State Street (near State&amp;Carrillo) with five telephone 
 lines (and one international Skype line). It will be open December 
 17-24 8am-8pm . I am looking for volunteers to help spend 2 
 hours talking to children on the phone, taking their Christmas wishes. 
 Men will be Santa Claus and women will be&quot;Mrs. Claus&quot;which kids really enjoyed last 
 year when several kind ladies helped fill in for me.
  I have created a web page that has actual phone calls from kids 
 last year you can listen to. The page also has a signup form for those 
 of you who can help me out this year:

 Ruth&apos;s Chris Opens 
 Uptown : La Cumbre Plaza has a new tenant. No, it&apos;s 
 not another shoe store. I am talking about the famous Ruths 
 Chris Steakhouse which had its grand opening yesterday.

 home to buy a little steak house in New Orleans named Chris 
 Steak House. The public company now has 117 locations around the 
 world and is based in Heathrow, Florida. The new Santa Barbara

 after by all popular night spots: a dance permit . In 
 addition to enjoying great food&amp;drink at Stateside, you can 
 now twist&amp;shout!

 Turducken : 
 Reader Dave asked me if there are any restaurants in town that 
 serve a&quot;Turducken dinner.&quot;I politely told him that I didn&apos;t 
 know and then asked:&quot;What the hell is a Turducken?&quot;A 
 Turducken is a turkey stuffed with a duck stuffed with a 
 chicken , with stuffing in between. He tells me it yields 
 multiple layers of flavor. You can read more 
 about it online at : wikipedia.org/wiki/Turducken

 C&apos;est Cheese : 
 If they were any hotter, the cheese would melt. That sums up the 
 popularity of Cest Cheese , a specialty store at 825 
 Santa Barbara St that features over 100 cheeses from around 
 the world [ photo ]. It is little tucked-away gems like this that 
 Santa Barbara is famous for and I thank reader Todd McRay for 
 finding this one for me.
  Started in 2003 by Michael&amp;Kathryn Graham , Cest Cheese has built 
 up a large and loyal fan base. Many restaurants source all of 
 their cheeses at C&apos;est Cheese, including top rated French 
 hotspot Bouchon , Intermezzo and more. They have a regular 
 following of people who come in every week or two to get their 
 cheeses. Saturday is their biggest day.
  Popular cheeses include Brie, Stilton, Red Hawk by Cowgirl 
 Creamery and Gruyere. Owner Michael Graham told me that many 
 customers are surprised when they taste the quality. People 
 think they know Gruyere and then they taste this and their whole 
 world has changed, he said. They also have many rare&amp;exotic 
 cheeses that no one else in the area sells. Michael showed me the Memoire, 
 a Dutch Gouda infused with black truffles, as an example [ photo ].
  Though the focus is cheese, Cest Cheese is also a high-end 
 grocery [ photo ] with wines 
 [ photo ], olive oils, vinegars, crackers, salami, prosciutto, pat, artisan honey and more. We prefer to stock 
 artisan items rather than big store commodity products, Michael said as 
 he picked up a small jar of spicy sun-dried tomatoes. This is 
 made by a family in Tunisia, he said.
  For those with a sweet tooth they also have a display of chocolate truffles [ photo ]. The most popular item is Caramel with 
 Fleur de Sel that is embedded with small salt crystals. Salt&amp;chocolate is amazing, he said. Another truffle in high demand 
 is Coeur, a dark chocolate infused with raspberry.
  Cest Cheese is open Monday-Friday 10am-7pm and Saturday 8am-6pm. 
 For more information call 965-0318 or visit CestCheese.com .

 Specials Spotlight :

 vegetable medley, caramelized roasted yams and fresh dinner

 Visual Update : 
 It appears construction of some kind has begun at 1129 State St 
 [ photo ], the former home of Restaurant Nu . 
 There is a rumor floating around that the next occupant will be The Melting Pot Restaurant . As always, this rumor might 
 be completely false or a brilliant forecast of future events. 
 Your call.

 Ruth&apos;s Chris : Rumors about the 
 exact day of Ruth&apos;s Chris Steakhouse opening have been 
 bouncing all over the calendar. Last Friday I sat down with Ruth&apos;s 
 Chris general manager Christopher Goodyear and he gave me the 
 official scoop. The grand opening of the new La Cumbre Plaza 
 restaurant is Monday, November 19th at 5pm . Here is a [ photo ] 
 of their shiny new digs 

 Guest Blogger : I am leaving the country this week to visit my sister and 
 her family in El Salvador . Her husband works for the

 Who Caters Sushi? Reader Meridith is 
 searching for a local catering company that offers fresh sushi and I put 
 that question in yesterday&apos;s blog. Thank you to readers Steve Weixel, 
 Anita, Chris&amp;Steve V. for helping Meridith find the answer!
 It appears the best 
 option for sushi catering in Santa Barbara is a company called Sushi 
 on Site that has a van often seen around town. Sushi is made fresh to 
 order on the premises and they will set up a sushi lounge for you. Their 
 sushi bar lounge is advertised as great for weddings, birthdays, and 
 corporate events. Sushi on Site was founded by Arief Norman who has been 
 a professional master sushi chef for more than 15 years. Call 
 805-708-7127 or visit SushiOnSite.com for menus and photos.

 For Peet&apos;s Sake : 
 Reader Richard followed up on the rumor about Peets Coffee coming to downtown State St and it appears that it might not be 
 happening any time soon. Here is the official communication he 
 received from corporate headquarters: Dear Richard, Thank 
 you very much for your inquiry. I am not aware of any immediate 
 plans for a new Peet&apos;s in Santa Barbara. New store openings have 
 only been announced through January 2008, and Santa Barbara is 
 not on the list. Sincerely, Ginny Phillips, Customer Service, 
 Peet&apos;s Coffee&amp;Tea. 

 Visual Update : I first spotted a 
 sign for Wahoo&apos;s Fish Taco in mid-October and mentioned 
 it in my October 15th blog. They are taking over the former Taiko location at 511 State St. It appears Wahoo&apos;s has finally started 
 construction ( see photo ).

 Thanksgiving and running through New Years, I&apos;ll be conducting my

 Beachbreak Cafe at 324 State St is having some dinner 
 specials: prime top sirloin w/ a bleu cheese reduction sauce or 
 chicken picatta for 8.95, good through 11/19. Running through 11/26 
 is the same top sirloin special or pan seared Ahi for 8.95. Mention 
 the specials to get the discount. Zaffiro Restaurant in Camino Real Marketplace is offering some specials 
 through the end of the year: A 50% discount on a glass of their wine 
 specials with every entre. A 5% discount on parties of over 15 
 guests. A 10% discount on catering. A 15% discount on their Gourmet

 combined with any other discount program. Baja Fresh Mexican Restaurants (7127 Hollister Ave, 3851 State St) now has a 
 Kids Eat Free special that runs on Saturdays&amp;Sundays. 

 Coming Soon? : I 
 also stopped by a restaurant-in-progress named Saffron on De La Guerra 
 St. About a month ago in this column I mentioned that it looked like 
 construction was going on inside. I snuck a peek last weekend and 
 nothing had changed at all since my previous visit so plans appear to be 
 stalled.

 Luck Cafe : In January 2005 a 
 notice about the pending arrival of&quot; Luck Cafe &quot;appeared on a 
 door at 18 E. Cota St, between Blue Agave and Square One . 
 Then nothing happened. The paper on the windows was down recently and it 
 appears that there finally is some construction going on inside. They 
 are combining two separate addresses into one larger space. See view 
 through left window and right window . Rumor has it that 
 the lease is held by Gene Montesano, owner of Lucky&apos;s , Joe&apos;s Cafe &amp;more. Perhaps this location will become the rumored new downtown Lucky&apos;s that was mentioned in my blog on October 9th?

 New In The Guide : At the request of 
 reader Angela, I finally made it 
 over to Boris Cake 
 Bakery at 423 N. Milpas St and added them to the guide.

 A Restaurant Odyssey : Santa Barbara has some 
 great restaurants, but dining venues with a 
 view looking down on our spectacular city are all but non-existent. Granada Hills, a city on the 
 edge of the San Fernando Valley, doesn&apos;t have this problem. I was in 
 Granada Hills recently and came across the most amazing restaurant named The 
 Odyssey . The Odyssey is situated high above the San Fernando Valley 
 and has the most incredible view. Nearly every seat in the house has a prime vantage point 
 ( see 
 photos ). Imagine if someone built a restaurant at the top 
 of the Santa Barbara Riviera , lined it with windows and you dined there at sunset. That 
 would be similar to the experience I am 
 talking about.
  The food and service was up there with the best Santa Barbara has 
 to offer and, much to my surprise, the prices were very inexpensive. I 
 ordered the 10oz Prime Rib (which was fantastic) and it only cost $22.95 
 including bread, vegetables&amp;potato. Our waiter named Stavros , 
 who has worked there for 20 years, was very friendly and knowledgeable 
 and provided some of the best service I have ever had. 
  In addition to the restaurant, the Odyssey offers five banquet 
 rooms. The&quot;Apollo Ballroom,&quot;the largest space adorning the Odyssey, 
 displays 100 feet of floor-to-ceiling windows giving all guests a 
 panoramic view of the entire San Fernando Valley. The next time you are 
 near the valley around dinner time, you must stop by and pay them a 
 visit. The Odyssey Restaurant, 15600 Odyssey Dr., Granada Hills, CA 
 91344. Phone: (818) 366-6444, TheOdysseyRestaurant.com 

 Visual Update : I stopped by the 
 future home of Esau&apos;s Cafe at 721 Chapala St. The last I heard 
 they were looking for a December 2007 opening. From the looks of the 
 inside, I don&apos;t think December is going to happen. See photos of outside &amp; inside .

 Changes To The Guide : Starting 
 today I have changed the SantaBarbara.com Restaurant Guide&apos;s 
 review expiration period from 3 years to 2 years. In other 
 words, reviews older than 730 days are no longer displayed. Previously 
 the maximum number of days in the life a review was 1095. This is the first modification to the 
 formula in the six years since the review system was first added 
 to the guide. While this 
 suddenly removes thousands of the oldest reviews, it also makes 
 this restaurant guide more relevant. Two years is still an 
 eternity for a restaurant. There will continue to be a 12 review 
 minimum, meaning that reviews stop expiring if a restaurant only 
 has a dozen (or fewer) reviews.

 The Zagat Zone : In a recent 
 column I published the winners of the Zagat Survey for 
 Santa Barbara. After looking at the list of winners for&quot;Best 
 Food,&quot;it suddenly occurred to me that Santa Barbara has formed 
 what I&apos;ll call a&quot;Zagat Zone.&quot;All the top ranked 
 Santa Barbara 
 restaurants ( Arigato Sushi , Bouchon , Downey&apos;s &amp; Olio E Limone ) are 
 clustered near the intersection of State&amp;Victoria ( see photo ). 
 To further illustrate their proximity I counted out the 
 number of steps between each dining venue. Using Bouchon as the 
 starting point, it takes only 91 steps to reach Arigato. I paced 
 off 88 steps to Downey&apos;s and a mere 30 steps to Olio E Limone.
 Picture Of 
 The Day : State Street has always had people trying a 
 variety of gimmicks to attract&quot;personal&quot;donations. One 
 clever guy seems to have hit upon a winning formula that is raking 
 in cash. The novelty: he has a mouse on top of a cat, while 
 the cat is on top of a dog (see photo 1 , photo 2 ). Now that a 
 successful business model has been discovered, we can expect to see a 
 flood of traditional foes paired together in harmony downtown, such as 
 Spider/Fly, Cheetah/Gazelle, Coke/Pepsi...
 Halloween : Have a safe and 
 Happy Halloween and try to ease up on the junk food intake! If 
 you happen to be near Loreto Plaza on upper State St, be sure to 
 stop by Harry&apos;s Plaza Cafe for their Halloween costume contest.

 Saigon Express Reopens : Reader 
 Stephen tells me that he walked by Saigon Express in Isla Vista recently and it appears they have reopened and are under 
 new management.

 Sand Shark : Earlier this week I 
 reported that Sandbar was recently reinvented as a Mexican restaurant&amp;tequila bar. I appears 
 that the reason for the change is that they are under new ownership. 
 Sandbar was purchased by its State Street neighbor Sharkeez a little 
 over a year ago.

 Halloween : Sweet Alley , 
 located at 1103 State St, 
 has stocked up on Halloween treats this year, including:

 Pumpkin-faced caramel apples Chocolate dipped marshmallows and Rice Krispie Treats, decorated with 
 spiders, ghosts&amp;skeletons Edible larvettes Pumpkin-faced chocolate lollipops Sour pumpkins Assorted fall mix Candy corn (of course!) Gummi spiders 

 Menu Online : Reader Mike tells me 
 that popular Cota St restaurant Blue Agave now 
 lists their complete 
 menu on their web site. I haven&apos;t been to Blue Agave in years so I 
 told Mike, who is having dinner at Blue Agave soon, that if he gives it 
 a thumbs up , I&apos;ll immediately make reservations for dinner. I&apos;ll 
 keep checking their reviews to see what Mike&apos;s verdict is and I&apos;ll post 
 the results here.

 Ethiopian Eatery : Saba 
 Tewolde, recently featured in the Santa Barbara Daily Sound, 
 plans to open a local restaurant named Lalibela that 
 specializes in Ethiopian cuisine . I spoke with her at 
 length recently and Saba hopes to find a restaurant location in 
 the next six months. She currently owns and operates the 
 Lalibela catering service that serves Ventura to Santa Barbara. 
 Lalibela catering handles groups from 5 up to 100 people, 
 including events, birthday parties and more. Ethiopian food is 
 served traditionally and includes Injera (flat bread), fish, 
 chicken, lamb, beef, spinach, lentil, beans dishes and cucumber 
 yogurt salad. Call 963-4053.
 Careers That Sizzle : Ruth&apos;s Chris Steakhouse , scheduled to open in La Cumbre 
 Plaza this November, is beefing up their staff. This is a 
 medium-rare opportunity to find a job as a server, bartender, 
 host/hostess, cook, steward, dishwasher or food runner. If you 
 have dining experience and want to join their herd, apply in 
 person Mon-Fri, 10am-5pm at Holiday Inn Goleta, located at 5650 
 Calle Real.
 New Web Site : Stateside 
 Restaurant&amp;Lounge , Santa Barbara&apos;s newest restaurant, 
 located at 1114 State St in La Arcada, has just launched their web site that includes pictures, menus and more.
 As If You Care : In my 
 September 10th blog I mentioned how my friends and I 
 took a group photo while on vacation at Northern 
 California when we were teenagers . At that time the five of us 
 all vowed to 
 return every five years and retake that picture, sitting 
 in the exact same location, lined up in the same order, with the 
 same posture and even the same facial expressions ( see 
 photos ). We have somehow managed to keep that vow intact for 25 years 
 and the story of our odd ritual is featured in today&apos;s 
 News-Press .

 Thanksgiving and running through New Years, the SantaBarbara.com

 will be displayed on the guides Best Of 2008 page all next year.

 Rumor Of The Day : In Carpinteria, Giannfranco&apos;s 
 Trattoria has grown in popularity so much they need to expand 
 the size of their kitchen. When the time comes, they will be closed for 
 the duration of the remodel. As always, this rumor might be completely 
 false or a brilliant forecast of future events. Your call.

 AOK BBQ : A friend of mine who is a 
 BBQ connoisseur tells me that the new JR&apos;s BBQ at Creekside in Goleta is fantastic. Last week he dined at JRs, located at 4444 
 Hollister Ave in Goleta (near Modoc), and said they were packed. My 
 friend offered lots of praise for the quality of the food and the chefs 
 attention to detail and said a visit to JRs is a must for BBQ fans. I 
 tried it myself last night (I ordered the baby back ribs) and it was 
 phenomenal. Looks like we just found another hidden gem. Call 
 964-5118.
 
Monday, October 22, 2007

 Turkish Festival : This Sunday, 
 October 28, 11am-5pm, Mediterra Cafe&amp;Market at 5575 Hollister Ave (next to Sizzler ) is 
 holding their second-annual Turkish Festival. They were overwhelmed last 
 year so organizers are making this years event even bigger. The 
 festival will have live entertainment, arts and crafts, belly dancing, 
 folk dancing, Gyros, Baklava, Turkish coffee and activities for 
 children. Admission is free. For pictures&amp;information visit sb.turkishfestival.us on the web or call 696-9323.

 Rumor Of The Day : 
 I was in the Scavenge costume shop at 418 State St the other day, 
 buying my outfit for this Halloween (I&apos;ll be Santa Claus, it&apos;s a long 
 story...), when I heard that they may move to 
 a different location. Two different organizations have approached 
 Scavenge about opening restaurants at that location. As always, this rumor might be completely 
 false or a brilliant forecast of future events. Your call.

 Sandbar Goes Mex : 
 I was walking down the windy, blinding, ash-choked State St corridor last Saturday 
 night when I happen to notice things looked very different at Sandbar . 
 Sandbar, located at 514 State St, has completely changed their concept. 
 They are now a Mexican Restaurant&amp;Tequila Bar. And they were 
 totally packed with customers. Looks like a good move. Call 966-1388.
 
Friday, October 19, 2007

 JR&apos;s Opens For Business : JR&apos;s BBQ at Creekside opened last Friday night at 4444 Hollister Ave (near Upper State St&amp;Modoc Rd) and I added them to the guide today. They feature southern-style barbeque ribs, pork shoulder, 
 beef brisket and Jamaican Jerk chicken. Dinner hours are from 4-10pm, 
 with a separate late night bar menu with tacos, burgers and appetizers. 
 Dinners range from $7.50 to $25. The restaurant features family dining,

 The owners of Brophy 
 Bros. , Cafe 
 Buenos Aires , Greek House Cafe , Jake&apos;s , Left At Albuquerque , Silvergreen&apos;s

 control panel accounts. Control panel accounts in the SantaBarbara.com 
 Restaurant Guide are free of charge and allow owners to post responses 
 to public reviews written about their restaurant. They can also enter 
 extended descriptions of their restaurant and information about 
 specials, hours, web site, menus, etc. The total number of restaurant 
 owners that have opened control panel accounts in the guide stands at 102 . Welcome aboard!

 As If You Care : It&apos;s a slow news day 
 so here is something random for you: Today Paramount 
 Pictures finished casting all the parts for the next Star Trek movie, which is supposed to be set in the crew&apos;s younger, academy days. I 
 searched Google and found pictures of the new actors : Kirk , Spock , Bones , Scotty , Sulu , Uhura &amp; Chekov . I have a suspicion the 
 new movie will suck. It arrives in theaters December 
 2008.

 Barramundi : I was at Outback Steakhouse on Calle Real last night with my friends Wedge&amp;Trish who are big 
 fans of Australia. They travel down under frequently and were very 
 surprised to see that Outback now offers Barramundi fish on the menu. Wedge said it is a very delicious type of fish only found in 
 the waters of Australia and is hugely popular there. He told me this 
 is the first time he has ever seen it served in the U.S. because it is 
 so hard to import. We ordered it and it was indeed fantastic.

 Speaking Of Outback : I also noticed 
 that Outback 
 Steakhouse has a new&quot; No Worries Wednesday s&quot;special 
 where they offer a mixed grill for $17.95. Here is their official 
 description:&quot;Savor our succulent slow-roasted top cap sirloin, tender, 
 flame-grilled chicken breast, and seasoned shrimp all served with fresh 
 steamed French-style green beans and vanilla bean mashed sweet 
 potatoes.&quot;

 The Hollister Brewing 
 Co. has brewed the official Lemonale for the California Lemon Festival in Goleta this weekend. Their brewer, Eric 
 Rose, has brewed this very special ale using local lemons from Glen 
 Annie Canyon, lemongrass, and ginger. HBC has sampled this beer from the

 beer. They will be serving this at Hollister Brewing Co. starting this

 Stateside Opens Downtown : Stateside Restaurant&amp;Lounge opened its doors last week in La Arcada at 1114 State St, 
 in the former location of Acapulco Restaurant. General Manager Warren 
 Butler gave me an extensive tour a few weeks ago and I was very 
 impressed. As designed, they will be able to open up parts of the 
 restaurant to accommodate large events and then scale back the visible 
 space to keep the atmosphere cozy&amp;intimate. In addition to being a 
 fine local restaurant featuring Californian Cuisine with an Asian 
 influence, I can see 11,000-square-foot Stateside quickly becoming the 
 preferred special events location in town. The restaurant features an 
 outdoor patio, two bar areas, a private dining room and an upstairs 
 mezzanine lounge. Hours are 11am - close. Call 564-1000.

 Lemon Festival : For the past 
 fifteen years the California 
 Lemon Festival has been the biggest celebration in the Goleta 
 area and it continues this weekend October 20-21. In addition to great 
 lemon food and lots of family activities, the festival has expanded to 
 include the Goleta Fall Classic Car, Motorcycle and Street Rod Show, and 
 the Girls Inc. 5K Run. As always, the Lemon Festival will feature the 
 most extensive &apos;Safety Street&apos; in the county, a pie-eating contest, arts 
 and crafts vendors, a petting zoo and amusement park rides.

 Winemaker&apos;s Dinner : This 
 Thursday, October 18 at 6:30pm, Four Seasons Biltmore features Sunstone 
 Winery for an October Winemakers Dinner in the Bella Vista restaurant. Price $95 plus tax&amp;gratuity. For reservations call 
 565-8232.

 Now FireFox Compatible : Reader 
 Gene let me know that there was some issues with the FireFox web 
 browser not displaying my blog correctly. I had never viewed my blog 
 with FireFox before and the font sizes were a mess! I have made changes to the fonts 
 on the page 
 so it now displays correctly in both Internet Explorer and the latest 
 version of FireFox.

 DOH! That is the sound Homer 
 Simpson makes when he has just committed another huge blunder. I now 
 know how he feels. Last Tuesday in my column in the Daily Sound I reported that the Cheesecake Factory was coming to town which 
 is not true , as it turns out. My blog was immediately corrected 
 but there are no keys to press that will fix my column after it is 
 sitting in 
 news racks all over town. My well-deserved punishment was 
 swift as flame mails informing me of my error quickly torched my 
 inbox . On the bright side, in addition to having learned a valuable 
 lesson about double-checking sources, I now know that my mom is not the 
 only person reading my print column!

 Wahoo&apos;s Fish Taco : Last 
 night I enjoyed a nice dinner on a cozy sidewalk table at Holdren&apos;s Steaks&amp;Seafood . As I savored my grilled shrimp, 
 artichoke soup and baby back ribs, I happened to notice a big sign 
 
 across the street ( see photo ). 
 On the front window of 511 State St, the former location of Taiko restaurant, there is now a colorful banner announcing that Wahoos Fish 
 Taco is coming to town. Wahoos is a taco chain started in 1988 in O.C. 
 and currently has more than 50 locations throughout California and 
 Colorado. Remodeling of the restaurant space has not started yet. For 
 more information, go to wahoos.com.

 Eclectic I.V. Reopens : Eclectic I.V. , 
 located at 6530 Pardall Rd in Isla Vista, has reopened after closing its 
 doors for remodeling last August.

 Fire At Lito&apos;s : 
 Workers fixing the roof at Lito&apos;s Mexican 
 Restaurant on Haley St accidentally started a fire that 
 partially damaged the structure. No word yet on when they will reopen.

 Rumor Of the Day : 
 The popular Jake&apos;s Cottage Cuisine Caf on De La Vina St is considering opening a second location in Goleta. As 
 always, this rumor might be completely false or a brilliant forecast of 
 future events. Your call.

 Fresco Zagat Rated : Seaside 
 restaurant Fresco at 
 the Beach is now rated in the 2008 Zagat Survey .&quot;The 
 fact that we made it into the guide during our first year of business is 
 quite remarkable&quot;says owner Jill Brouillard.&quot;Our score, a very 
 respectable 20 for food. 23 for decor and 20 for service is even more 
 significant because it relates to the time period of our first six 
 months in operation and our original menu, which has been improved upon 
 greatly.&quot;The Zagat Survey describes Fresco at the Beach this way: &quot;A pleasant surprise at the Santa Barbara Inn, this comfortable new 
 Californian leads off with fabulous ocean views and follows with 
 skillfully made signatures like rack of lamb and bouillabaisse: though a 
 bit more casual than its predecessor, Citronelle, it&apos;s also more 
 reasonably priced, and once the kitchen gets up to speed a few pros 
 predict it&apos;ll be top-notch.&quot;

 Speaking Of Awards : Baja Fresh Mexican Grill , 
 located in Goleta and on Upper State St, received the 2007 Platinum 
 Award from Restaurants&amp;Institutions Magazine , a leading news source for the 
 restaurant chain industry.

 the hours are 11am - close. Call 564-1000.

 Poll: Who Serves An English Breakfast? Reader Eric has asked me to ask you if you know any places in town that 
 serve an English Breakfast . An English breakfast consists of Eggs 
 (poached, sunny side up, or over easy), bacon (called rashers), baked 
 beans, sausages, hash browns or sauted potatoes, fried mushrooms, a 
 grilled tomato, toast, and hot tea. Some variants of it are 
 the Scottish, Welsh, and Irish breakfast (but all of them are very 
 similar to the English breakfast). If you have any suggestions, please 
 send me an email .

 lower State Street, a block from the beach, there is a huge sign on the 
 side of a building that says:&quot; Hot Spots has moved. Opening 
 at new location soon. 505 State 
 St .&quot;To be more accurate, the sign should say:&quot;Hot Spots ALREADY moved to 505 State St 
 and then crashed&amp;burned so Cafe Nirvana moved in and quickly 
 tanked and now the current occupant, Mad Dogs, is kicking serious 
 butt!&quot;Better yet, they should remove the sign.

 Fine Dining At Petit Valentien : 
 Reader Lemonjelly shares her pictures of an exquisite 
 French meal
 La Petit 
 Valentien - Our table outside at la Petit Valentien in la 
 Arcada downtown. This was before the endless plates of little 
 morsels decended upon us. Fresh bread - We were the first patrons at la Petit Valentien on Saturday 
 morning. The bread is fresh from the oven. I had time to take 
 photos because it was too hot to eat immediately. Your food is 
 served! - Our waitress at la Petit Valentien brings out 
 the cheese plate. She was so nice! Cheese plate - The cheese plate might come out first, but don&apos;t eat it 
 first because the cheese needs to come to room temp. Then it&apos;s 
 super buttery and nice. There are five cheeses here, including 
 a brie and Manchego. Two had blue veins and were our 
 favorites. Roasted beet, 
 green bean and goat cheese salad - One of our salads from 
 la Petit Valentien. The little beans were the best I&apos;d ever 
 eaten, they were perfectly crisp tender. Mediterranean 
 chopped salad - The chopped salad was tomatoes, cucumbers, 
 red onions, fennel and feta cheese. Piled up in a ring mold. 
 The olive oil was also very light and tasty. 

 Fine Dining At Costco : John 
 Dickson shares his pictures of an exquisite American meal
 Ambiance - 
 Outdoor seating, 4 lines, with a large menu above, offering 
 hot dogs, pizza, chicken wraps and dessert. Service - Our 
 friendly waiter gave us prompt, courteous service. Presentation - 
 I ordered the $1.50 pup&amp;cup lunch. The hot dog is wrapped 
 in foil and cleverly stored in the paper cup to make 
 carrying your meal easier. Refreshments - 
 You get unlimited refills of soda. I chose the Sprite and 
 refilled it once. Condiment Buffet - You have your choice of ketchup, mustard, deli mustard, 
 onions or relish. I chose the ketchup, mustard and relish. 
 The foil not only keeps your meal warm but also acts as a 
 serving dish. 

 Speaking Of Dogs : Guinness Book of World Records announced the world&apos;s smallest dog today.

 Dinner Buffet : 
 Indian restaurant Spice Avenue , located at 1027 State Street, now

 New In The Guide : Today I 
 added more dining locations, all from Los Olivos &amp; Santa Ynez . Next time I am in the area I&apos;ll take pictures 
 for the guide. New entries are: Burger Barn , El Rancho Market , Pizza Shack , Restaurant 
 Marcella , Roasted Bean 
 Coffee House and Santa Cota 
 Market&amp;Deli .
 Speaking Of Santa Ynez : 
 Yesterday AT&amp;T Wireless caused some grief in the 
 valley . Until yesterday, cell phone service in Santa Ynez 
 Valley from AT&amp;T Wireless was delivered using their own cell 
 towers and those of other providers with whom AT&amp;T Wireless had 
 a sharing agreement. Yesterday AT&amp;T Wireless decided that their 
 one tower was good enough for the whole valley and shut off 
 all other towers, without warning . Now the whole valley shares a single tower 
 and service has dramatically degraded (90% connection

 Channel One : Gordon 
 Ramsay , a Scottish celebrity chef and star of several Fox 
 Network food-themed TV programs, brought his cameras and 
 crew to Square One Restaurant yesterday to tape an episode of 
 one of his shows. Owner/Chef Jason Tuley is the focus.

 Rumors Of the Day : Rocks , located at 801 State St, will soon 
 begin construction of a third story which will be the future 
 home of another downtown eatery they own: Piranha 
 Restaurant&amp;Sushi Bar . Last week I wrote that Zelo 
 Restaurant will be taken over by 
 the Tonic nightclub. Rumor has it that Chris Dixon, the former 
 GM of popular nightclub Wildcat 
 Lounge , will be heading up and 
 partnering in this new project. As always, these rumors might be 
 completely false or a brilliant forecast of future events. Your 
 call.
 JRs BBQ Coming To Creekside : JR&apos;s BBQ at Creekside opens next week at 4444 Hollister Ave

 to soon become&quot; Noodle City .&quot;

 Hi-Def Plasmas with Direct TV showing all the NFL games on

 donating their time and delicious food to the event. Here are some pictures : Jake of Jake&apos;s

 Rudy&amp;Joe : The former mayor of New 
 York City, Rudy Giuliani , stopped by Joe&apos;s Cafe yesterday. He wandered around the place, mostly meeting with diners 
 eating in booths and meeting with employees of the cafe. I took pictures and shot a   movie of the 
 scene surrounding his brief visit to Joe&apos;s.

 For Sale : Reader Foodie Dan spotted 
 an ad in Craig&apos;s List that indicates that the Deli Planet in Goleta is for sale for $139,999. Speaking of local businesses up for 
 sale, there is another online advertisement that indicates a local unnamed Japanese 
 restaurant chain is for sale for $2.5 million. My best guess is that the mystery 
 business is Sushi Teri . Here is the text of the ad:&quot;Japanese Sushi 
 Restaurants With Locations In Ventura And Santa Barbara Counties. Nice 
 Menu With Charbroiled Beef, Chicken, Fish And Sushi For Lunch And Dinner 
 At Affordable Prices, Beer&amp;Wine, Eat In Or Take Out. All Locations

 Don&apos;t SCARE Me Like That : Reader 
 John reported that the popular sushi saloon Edomasa is displaying ominous signs of needing a plot of land in SantaBarbara.com&apos;s&quot;Restaurant Cemetery.&quot;I quickly drove by, and, to my horror , there was no furniture at all inside the building. 
 Invisible 
 furniture is always the swan song of the dining departed . I noticed 
 that the 
 door was unlocked and that the owner was inside so I entered the 
 premises to give my condolences. The first words out of his mouth:&quot;We&apos;re remodeling. Come back tomorrow!&quot;

 Visual Update : On July 30th, I 
 relayed an interview the Santa Barbara News-Press had with the owner of 
 up-and-coming restaurant Renaud&apos;s Patisserie and Bistro . In the interview, owner Renaud 
 Gonthier said he 
 would be open mid-September. Seeing that it is now the END of September, 
 I thought I would drive over yesterday to Loreto Plaza and deliver some smiles and shake some 
 hands . My first clue that the opening has been delayed was seeing the 
 name of the previous occupant, Italian Bakery, still on the building ( see 
 exterior photo ). I then peeked over the paper covering the front 
 window and snapped an interior 
 picture that reveals the extent of the delay .

 We Deliver : The Beach Grill at Padaro at 3765 Santa Claus Lane in Carpinteria is now delivering their 
 full menu to Montecito, Summerland and Carpinteria. However, 
 because of their spectacular seaside setting (and perhaps the most kid&amp;dog friendly restaurant on the South Coast) I highly recommend you enjoy 
 the BGAP in its full glory: on site. Call 566-0566.

 Depot Day : The Goleta Depot is having its 25th annual&quot;Depot Day&quot;that will celebrate the 106th 
 birthday of this local treasure. The party is scheduled for Sunday, 
 September 30th, 11am-4pm. Enjoy train rides, a barbeque, musical 
 entertainment and lots of family fun. 300 N. Los Carneros Rd, Goleta. 
 Call 964-3540.

 Poll: Who Serves the Best 
 Chile Relleno? Reader Seth tells me that he has yet to find a 
 good Chile Relleno served in town. Email me 
 your opinion!

 Reader Chris says:&quot;Your readers have left off the most unique rendition 
 we&apos;ve found in town - the chile relleno at La Super Rica Taqueria . 
 Their recipe puts white cream and cheese sauce over the fried pepper - 
 muy bueno relleno. It&apos;s only available on Monday and Tuesday as a daily 
 special.&quot; Reader Margie says:&quot;Carpinteria - Oaxaca Fresh . 
 All their food is amazing.&quot; Reader Foodie Dan says:&quot;I think the best chile 
 rellano is served by Del Pueblo Cafe . They roast the poblanos before stuffing them 
 and that gives them a sweet almost nutty flavor.&quot; Reader Christine says:&quot;I know of no chile rellano 
 in SB....BUT, if you travel a bit north to Guadalupe- OH BOY- La 
 Simpatia Restaurant makes fresh ones right in front of your eyes! And 
 they are delicious!&quot;

 Locals Night : Fresco at the Beach , 
 901 E. Cabrillo Blvd, now offers&quot;Locals Wine Night&quot;every Monday. 
 Fresco offers a complimentary glass of wine with every entree. Call 
 963-0111

 Vegan Night : Chamomile Cafe , 
 915 Linden Ave in Carpinteria, now offers dinner five nights a week. 
 They are serving a vegan menu with an emphasis on organic grains 
 and produce. Call 566-5954 to request a list of menu items or to make 
 reservations. Closed Mondays and Tuesdays.

 Visual Update : Saffron is 
 an Indian restaurant coming to 113 W. De La Guerra St (near Chapala). I 
 stopped by and took a picture of 
 the progress from the driver&apos;s side window of my 1989 Nissan Maxima. 
 In the photo, the window&amp;door to the right is a different business. Realizing that a boarded-up front window doesn&apos;t tell the story, I 
 parked my car and sneaked a peek in the side window. There appears to be 
 construction in progress with a few months of work left to do. I saw new 
 hardwood floors and some blueprints on a table. Work on the whole front 
 of the building (inside&amp;outside) doesn&apos;t appear to have started yet.

 Extra! Extra! Coffee Shop Coming To State 
 Street! The number of coffee shops on State Street is 
 increasing from 17 to 18. Craig Smith reports in today&apos;s Santa Barbara 
 Daily Sound that the former location of La Salsa at 1131 
 State St (across from the Museum of Art) will be transforming into a Peet&apos;s Coffee . And not a moment too soon. Last weekend, while I was 
 walking past that location, I noticed that a continuous half-block of State Street (on the west side, from Anapamu St on down) was closed or boarded up . And in the other half block that still had 
 viable businesses paying their leases, the largest tenant, an 
 international furniture store, had a huge going-out-of-business banner 
 displayed in the front. It was like a ghost town on the 1100 
 block of State St. A good latte from Peet&apos;s should cheer the place up!

 Unity Shoppe Party : Tomorrow is 
 the 90th anniversary party for Santa Barbara&apos;s Unity Shoppe . I&apos;ll be 
 there.
FOOD: bbq tri-tip, chicken, salad chips and guacamole
MUSIC: Live band&quot;Still Evolving&quot;is coming to Santa Barbara !

 Rumor Of The Day : Zelo Restaurant is going to be completely remodeled and turned into a VIP 
 extension of the Tonic nightclub. The facility will have 
 new staff, new management and a new name. Im not sure when the 
 construction is set to begin (or to be complete, for that 
 matter), but I have been told that the new head chef is already 
 hired. As always, this rumor might be completely false or a 
 brilliant forecast of future events. Your call.

 Boomerang : As soon as a 
 Mexican restaurant flew from Goleta, a new one came right back. Lilia&apos;s Mexican restaurant in old town Goleta has been replaced by Del Valle 
 Grill Mexican restaurant, which I added to the guide 
 today. I published a tip from reader Foodie Dan back on August 28th 
 that Del Valle Grill was on its way.

 Visual Update : Two restaurants 
 are coming to La Cumbre Plaza in November/December. Here are pictures of Ruth&apos;s Chris Steakhouse and Marmalade Cafe in 
 their current state of construction as of 9/24/07.
 Photoholics Anonymous : I grabbed my 
 thoroughly worn-out Sony Cyber-shot DSC-P92 digital camera (the 
 picture counter has already reset at 9,999 TWICE) and stopped by La Arcada on 
 State Street to take pictures inside and 
 out of Petit 
 Valentein which opened last Friday. While I was there I grabbed a copy of their current menu for you to checkout . 
 Their menu will change frequently but this gives you a feel for 
 what it will be like.
 Steak Patrol : Patrick Gilliland , a SantaBarbara.com writer and 
 steak connoisseur in search of the perfect Filet Mignon, will 
 soon be sharing his Steak Patrol adventures with Santa Barbara Daily Sound readers in a new restaurant review column.

 He&apos;s Dead, Jim : Reader Danny let me 
 know that a Romulan Bird-of-Prey has crossed through the Neutral Zone, 
 decloaked and pulverized Tiramisu restaurant in Paseo Nuevo. I stopped by yesterday 
 afternoon and took a couple of pictures with my iPhone to prove the restaurant 
 has closed (see photo of outside and inside ). A note on the 
 door (dated 9/20/07) from County Environmental Health services reads:&quot;Observed all food equipment removed and facility closed this date. This 
 facility shall not be reopened as a food facility without approval by 
 Environmental Health Services.&quot;

 Rumor Of The Day : 
 Gene Montesano, owner of many local restaurants including Lucky&apos;s and Joe&apos;s Cafe , 
 has reportedly sold his share in the recently-closed El Cazador restaurant to Tony Arroyo , founder of the Los Arroyos restaurants (on Figueroa St downtown and on Coast Village Rd in 
 Montecito). Could a Los Arroyos restaurant be coming in to replace El 
 Cazador in De la Guerra Plaza? As always, this rumor might be completely 
 false or a brilliant forecast of future events. Your call.

 Opening In Solvang : Cabernet Bistro reopens in a new location, 485 Alisal Rd, on September 
 30 th and includes a new wine lounge. Theyre open for dinner 
 Wed-Sun 5pm-10pm. Founders Jacques&amp;Diana Toulet, who were owners of 
 Les Pyrenees Restaurant in Santa Monica for twenty years, still offer 
 their renowned duck entrees, once quoted by Elmer Dills as being The 
 Best Duck in Los Angeles. Call 688-8871 or visit CabernetBistro.com.
 
 Friday, September 21, 2007 

 The Name Game : This is the sixth column in a series 
 about food locations in far away cities that have been given names that 
 you will find very familiar. When it&apos;s time to watch the World Cup 
 soccer game, a hugely popular place to go is Santa Barbara Pub , a 
 Brazilian sports bar and restaurant. Fear not, Dargan&apos;s fans, your 
 popular Irish Pub is still World Cup Grand Central on the South Coast. 
 That is because Santa Barbara Pub is located in Hudson, Massachusetts. The city 
 of Hudson is 28 miles west of Boston and has a population of 18,000, 
 many of Portuguese decent. Santa Barbara Pub&apos;s menu, found online at SantaBarbaraPub.com , lists their most popular items as steaks&amp;salads&quot;Santa Barbara style.&quot;Perhaps Paul Dargan could call these kind folks 
 in Hudson and start an official&quot;sister pub&quot;program? 

 Speaking Of Sports Bars : Santa Barbara 
 Brewing Company , located at 501 State St, 
 
 now offers NFL Breakfast Sundays beginning at 9am. They have 22 
 large HD plasma TV&apos;s and include all DirecTV college games as well. Call 
 730-1040. If sports is your religion, you can also find a Sunday morning 
 house of worship at Hollister Brewing Co. (Camino Real Marketplace) and Downtown Brewing Co. (3755 State St). 

 Who Serves The Best Mud Pie? : It&apos;s Reader Poll time again. Email me 
 your opinion!

 Reader Laura says&quot;While there&apos;s a lot of good mud pie out there, 
 my favorite at this point has been at the Endless Summer .&quot; Reader Christine says Mattei&apos;s Tavern has the best Mud Pie I personally believe that the Elephant Bar&amp;Restaurant takes the prize 

 Dear John : Letters from readers - dated 
 9/4/07
 
DEAR MR. DICKSON,

I HAVE SELDOM READ THE&quot;DAILY SOUND&quot;, BUT AFTER READING YOUR 
 COLUMN IN A DOCTOR&apos;S OFFICE AND ENJOYING IT, I SHALL READ THE PAPER 
 MORE OFTEN.

I REALLY LIKE YOUR BRIEF, FACTUAL, AND COMMONSENSE APPROACH TO TELLING 
 THE READER ABOUT RESTAURANTS&apos; COMINGS AND GOINGS. FAR MORE ENJOYABLE 
 THAN THE ARCH REVIEWS OF RESTAURANTS BY PEOPLE ON EXPENSE ACCOUNTS WHO 
 RAVE ON AND ON ABOUT THE TWENTY OR SO DISHES THEY&quot;SAMPLED&quot;IN SOME 
 OVERPRICED JOINT AT NO COST TO THEMSELVES. HARDLY FOR THE COMMON MAN.

MY COMPLAINT ABOUT SANTA BARBARA AREA RESTAURANTS IS THE SURFEIT OF 
 EXPENSIVE&quot;GOURMENT&quot;RESTAURANTS ALL OVER THE PLACE IN RATHER DUMPY 
 SURROUNDINGS. PLACES LIKE&quot;OLIO E LIMONE&quot;,&quot;SAGE AND ONION&quot;, AND&quot;BOUCHON&quot;HAVE GOOD FOOD, BUT THEY ARE FAR TOO EXPENSIVE, AND NOT VERY&quot;SHOWY&quot;TO JUSTIFY THE COST. THE ONLY RESTAURANT THAT CAN BE A LITTLE PRICEY 
 THAT I REALLY LIKE IS&quot;CA DARIO&quot;.

THERE SEEM TO BE FEWER AND FEWER REASONABLY PRICED MIDDLE CLASS 
 RESTAURANTS FOR US TO TAKE OUR FAMILIES TO FOR A GOOD MEAL THAT WON&apos;T 
 BREAK THE BANK. I THINK OF&quot;CLEMENTINE&apos;S&quot;OR THE&quot;PARADISE CAFE&quot;, 
 PERHAPS&quot;CAFE DEL SOL&quot;, AND&quot;PASCUCCI&quot;. COULD YOU LET ME KNOW, EITHER 
 BY DIRECT REPLY OR IN YOUR COLUMN, WHAT YOUR OWN CHOICES FOR BEST&quot;FAMILY NIGHT OUT&quot;RESTAURANTS IN OUR AREA WOULD BE? I WOULD 
 APPRECIATE YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS, AND SO I THINK WOULD MANY OTHER 
 LOCALS.

MANY THANKS.
WILLIAM

P.S.: I HOPE THE&quot;SOUND&quot;GROWS TO THE POINT WHERE IT CAN CHALLENGE THE 
 NEWS-PRESS. THIS TOWN NEEDS ANOTHER FULL-GROWN NEWSPAPER.

 He&apos;s Dead, Jim :
 Reader James tells me that the The Zone Sports Grille in Carpinteria has been killed by a dikironium cloud creature on Argus X. 
 Reader Krista 
 passed word that El Cazador in 
 De La Guerra Plaza has crashed into a foggy, rocky area of Taurus II, 
 and the Enterprise is unable to locate her. Meanwhile reader Ruth let me know that Don Pepe&apos;s at 
 Chapala&amp;Ortega was swallowed up by the Doomsday Machine, broken 
 down into rubble then consumed for fuel.

 Rumors Of The Day : Back on Earth, I 
 am told that The Melting Pot restaurant, a periodic source of speculation in this column as a 
 potential new arrival to Santa Barbara, is planning to open 
 at 1129 State St, the former location of Restaurant NU . 
  As mentioned above, The Zone Sports Grille in Carpinteria has closed its doors for good. The owner of that building - Laxman Peralta 
 of Sushi Teri - has 
 allegedly bought the business and is rumored to be reselling to, or 
 partnering with the ex-chef/partner of Lucky&apos;s in Montecito. Are we getting 
 a high-end steakhouse in Carpinteria? As always, t hese 
 rumors might be completely false or a brilliant forecast of future 
 events. Your call. 

 Specials Spotlight : Longboards 
 Grill on Stearns Wharf has a Fish&amp;Chips special running right now; Mahi Mahi, freshly breaded, fried, 
 served with cole slaw&amp;seasoned fries for only $6.95. Valid Mon-Thu and 
 after 5pm Sundays. The special ends 10/4/07. Speaking of Stearns Wharf, 
 the Moby Dick 
 Restaurant has a Wild Salmon or Top Sirloin Steak special. With your entree your receive soup or 
 salad, potato&amp;fresh vegetables for $13.95. Valid Mon-Fri only.

 Dog&amp;Blonde : Neighboring businesses Mad 
 Dogs (505 State St) and James Joyce (513 State St) 
 have joined forces to offer a special happy hour. Their new ad campaign 
 says&quot;Man&apos;s two best friends: a dog and a blonde.&quot;The happy hour runs 
 every day from 3pm to 6pm at both locations. A hot dog&amp;blonde beer 
 combo costs $6.

 Dear John : Letters from readers - 
 dated 8/26/07 
I think you should get the IDIOT OF THE MONTH AWARD.

Read what you wrote. (8/23/07)
 Sizzler Robbed: Sizzler Restaurant on Hollister in Goleta was the 
 victim of an armed robbery. Bahram Jabaroghli of Pasadena held up the 
 restaurant and was ultimately captured after employees from Toyota 
 (across the street) pointed him out to police as the suspect. Reader 
 Andi directs you to see this YouTube video of the commotion 
 surrounding the robbery. Mr. Jabaroghli receives SantaBarbara.com&apos;s 
 first-ever Idiot Of The Month Award. 

IS HE CONVICTED YET?
DID YOU SEE HIM HOLD UP THE RESTAURANT?
IS HE A SUSPECT?
IS HE GOING TO SUE YOU IF THEY FIND HIM NOT GUILTY?

 Petit Valentien Opens Tomorrow : 
 French to modern American restaurant Petit Valentien opens tomorrow at 1114 State St #114 in La Arcada, the former location 
 of Bogart&apos;s Cafe . 
 The hours are Mon-Wed 11:30am-5pm, Thu-Sat 11:30am-9pm. The restaurant 
 will be geared towards smaller, affordable portions in the $5-$15 range. 
 It will be a casual bistro-style caf (seating 35 inside, 12 outside) 
 similar to a Mediterranean tapas. Petit Valentien plans to change the 
 menu frequently. For the Wednesday opening, the menu will have a variety 
 of items including scallops with black bean&amp;orange and a dish of 
 sauted pork tenderloin garnished with shrimp, scallops, clams&amp;mussels.
  This is the third restaurant owned by founder Robert Dixon who has 
 lived in Carpinteria for three years. Previously he operated a high-end 
 French restaurant in Bakersfield and a restaurant in the outskirts of 
 New York that was highly rated (27 food score) in the Zagat survey. Call 
 966-0222.

 Dear John : Letters from readers - dated 9/17/07 
John,

I&apos;ve been somewhat enjoying the&quot;Steak Patrol&quot;reviews posted on your 
 site, despite the fact the Filet is one of the most overrated and 
 flavorless pieces of meat out there. It does however still seems to 
 satisfy the masses, so I guess it&apos;s not a totally bad choice of cut 
 for your site. (but as you&apos;ve already seen, each restaurants 
 definition of&quot;filet&quot;varies).

Anyways, as a chef I felt I had to speak up about the most recent 
 review by&quot;Sgt. Gilliland.&quot;How could you have someone that is 
 obviously uneducated about meat be one of your reviewers? While it 
 sounds like he was served a poor imitation of a&quot;filet,&quot;his comments 
 on marbling are a clear sign he doesn&apos;t know what he is talking about. 
 Fat = Flavor (in the meat world). No way to deny that. Now a big 
 honking piece of fat is not desirable understandably, but a beautiful 
 finely marbled steak is one of life&apos;s best culinary treats. It makes 
 no sense that Gilliland complains he was likely served a&quot;Choice&quot;grade steak instead of&quot;Prime,&quot;as a Prime steak will have, guess 
 what, more marbling (fat). If he is in search of the ultimate Filet 
 without any sauce to muddy up the taste of the meat, then he should be 
 searching for the dreaded aged fat laced marbled beef, as when that 
 filet hits the heat, those fine lines of fat melt and result in a 
 tasty steak. It also does not make sense that a reviewer of steaks is 
 ranting about how unhealthy they have become. For most diners, a fine 
 steak is a treat, not something enjoyed everyday and when they order 
 it they are not looking for health food. As a steak&quot;purist&quot;I agree 
 that a steak should not be drenched in a heavy sauce and the only 
 additions I usually make are a topping of a compound butter just as 
 the steak leaves the heat. Thankfully due to more&quot;artisan&quot;meat 
 purveyors high quality marbled beef is actually more accessible these 
 days and the customers sure do love the flavor, who wouldn&apos;t? I guess 
 maybe the so called, Sgt. Gilliland? Maybe it&apos;s time to send him back 
 to the Academy?

Happy Dining,
Seth

 New Steak Patrol Review : Steak 
 expert Patrick Gilliland of the Santa Barbara Steak Patrol reviews the Filet Mignon at 
 the Tee-Off Restaurant . The Steak Patrol goes to restaurants throughout Santa Barbara, reviewing just the Filet 
 Mignon for a common point of comparison. Ratings range from A- to AAA+. The final rating must 
 not put much emphasis on the quality of side dishes or the service. Its 
 all about the beef. 

 Salsa Festival : The 5th annual Salsa Festival is this Saturday, September 22nd at Ortega Park . Hours are 10:30am-9pm and it includes food, a salsa 
 making contest, salsa dancing and a children&apos;s play zone.

 Visual Update : Here is a 9/16/07 picture of Storke Rd 
 Drive-Inn currently under reconstruction. It appears they have 
 removed all the front windows and are making the drive-thru window (left 
 side) the centerpiece of the new design.
 
 Friday, September 14, 2007 

 McCelebration : Starting 
 today and running through Sunday, McDonald&apos;s on Upper State, the restaurant that served the world&apos;s first Egg McMuffin , will celebrate its first major remodel since 
 1970. Big Macs will sell for 70 cents and they will have 
 other specials and giveaways. Herb Peterson , who owns all 
 area McDonald&apos;s, invented the Egg McMuffin in 1972.

 New In Isla Vista : McMaster&apos;s Steak&amp;Hoagie opened September 4th in the former location of New York 
 Buffalo Wings on Embarcadero Del Norte. Owner George 
 McMaster has opened a dozen Hoagie shops around the state 
 including several Great Western Hoagie&apos;s in Los Angeles. Here is 
 a picture of their menu .

 New In Isla Vista : 
 Reader Patrick sent me a tip that Berrilicious opened this week at 956 Embarcadero Del Norte. They serve 
 all-natural frozen yogurt with an assortment of toppings. 
 Patrick says the concept at Berrilicious is basically the same 
 as frogurt shops Pink Berry, Red Mango&amp;Snow Berry in Los 
 Angeles which are big hits.

 New In Isla Vista :  El Sitio Mexican restaurant opened at 6850 Pardall Rd. They have been 
 open for seven months and I just discovered them. There are four 
 other El Sitio locations in Santa Barbara and Goleta.

 Not New In Isla Vista : I 
 finally got around to adding Isla Vista Food 
 Cooperative to the restaurant guide. They are a market, 
 health food store and deli and have locally-grown organic 
 produce. It is managed by members who pay $30/year until they 
 achieve a total donation of $150. Anyone can shop there but 
 members become part owners and receive more than $200 annually 
 in discounts. The Co-op began as an experiment in the early 
 1970&apos;s when a small group of local people joined together to 
 take control of food prices and to get foods that local stores 
 were unwilling to provide. They have had more than $50 million in sales since 
 then.

 Game Over : Coastal View 
 News reports that Moon Doggies sports bar in Carpinteria

 Reporting From SB : I finally made it 
 home from vacation after a series of flight cancellations, flight 
 rerouting and flight delays (I circled above San Francisco waiting for the fog to clear - see 
 my air photo ). Upon arriving at the SB airport ( see 
 my sequence of air 
 photos ), my pager went off signaling a hardware 
 failure of one of SantaBarbara.com&apos;s critical computer servers. After I fixed 
 that, another server crashed, keeping me busy most of 
 yesterday. I haven&apos;t had problems with any servers in 5 years then - 
 wham bam - two in 24 hours. Neither rain, nor sleet, nor snow nor CPU 
 cooling fan failure can stop Santa Barbara restaurant news from 
 being delivered!

 Garden Of Eat&apos;n : Reader Trish 
 tells me that the Santa Barbara Botanic Gardens has upgraded 
 their food offerings to include sandwiches, salads and desserts for their 
 hungry visitors. This new catered sandwich service replaces snack 
 offerings that just weren&apos;t up to the task.

 Rumor Of The Day : The owners of 
 the Natural Cafe are considering opening an authentic Mexican restaurant right next door 
 to their 508 State Street location. This rumor might be completely false or a 
 brilliant forecast of future events. Your call. 

 Chainsaws R Us : The new owners of the Wine Cask in El Paseo are in trouble with the city for chopping down a 60 foot 
 eucalyptus tree and removing a courtyard fountain, all without consent. 
 The city has a legal easement over external modifications on the 
 property because El Paseo is a local landmark.

 Reporting from Medford : 
 I am in the Medford, Oregon airport, heading home from my vacation in 
 northern California. This airport has 100% free Wi-Fi Internet access. 
 Turn your laptop on and - presto - you&apos;re online. When the powers that 
 be finish building the new Santa Barbara airport, I hope they make 
 Internet access free too. It is a really nice touch and a nice gesture 
 to hurried travelers. Most airports try to squeeze a few bucks out of 
 you rather than recognize that, these days, Internet access is as 
 important as restroom access. And airports don&apos;t charge to use the John.
 
 Happy Hour : Pizza Guru at 
 3534 State St now has happy hour everyday 3-7pm. $3 off large pizza, $2 
 off medium pizza, $6 pitchers, $2 pints. Call 563-3250.

 Reporting From Mt. Shasta : 
 On my last day of vacation before I return to Santa Barbara, my friends 
 and I have continued a 25 year tradition . Four friends 
 (all from Santa Barbara) and I took a group picture here at Copco Lake near Mt. Shasta when we were teenagers. We all vowed 
 to return every 5 years and retake that group picture sitting in the 
 exact same location, lined up in the same order, with the same posture 
 and even the same facial expressions. Some marriages have come and gone 
 over the decades, but our teenage vow has yet to be broken. Here are our group photos, taken every 5 years since 
 1982 . I&apos;m the one on the right.

 Reporting From Mt. Shasta : 
 This morning I went on a hike to the top of a hill we call Kirok 
 Mountain. From the peak you have a great view of the Copco Lake ( see 
 photo ) and surrounding countryside. This entire area is covered with 
 ancient lava flows and cinder cones.

 saving a customer&apos;s life when the woman had a heart attack. Gill 
 performed emergency CPR until paramedics arrived. 


 

Wednesday, September 5, 2007
 
 Reporting From Mt. Shasta : 
 I am vacationing with friends at Copco Lake, an undiscovered 5-mile wide 
 hideaway on the Klamath river next to Mt. Shasta in northern California. 
 The lake was formed with the construction of a dam from 1918-1922. Here 
 is a picture of our cabin and 
 the boat dock .

 Frog Leg Friday : Apparently 
 Copco Lake isn&apos;t the only place with lots of frogs. You can also find 
 them at Mimosa restaurant which serves French and&quot;Casual Cuisine.&quot;Every Friday from 
 5-6:30pm you can order $5 appetizers including Frog Legs, Ahi, Salmon 
 Tartar, Escargo and Mussels. Mimosa also has good food&amp;drink specials 
 with wines by the glass and specialty martinis&amp;margaritas.

 Helping Heather : Heather Mattoon , a popular young local artist became paralyzed from the waist down after falling from her 
 third-story apartment. With no insurance and daily rehabilitation from 
 her spinal cord injury, she has a big financial hurdle to overcome as 
 well. On Saturday, September 8th, local restaurants are donating 5% of 
 their proceeds to Heathers fundraising efforts. 
 Participating venues include: Bouchon, Elements, Emilios, Hollister 
 Brewing Co, Hungry Cat, Indochine, Luckys, Olio y Limone, Piranha, 
 Quantum, Sevilla, Square One and Wine Cask. This Thursday, September 
 6th, Fresco Museum Caf at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art will to 
 donate 5% of sales from their First Thursday Night Event. The event is 
 tomorrow from 5pm to 7pm and they will be serving Hors doeuvres and 
 wine and beer. For more info about First Thursday please email cafe@sbma.net. 

 Meals On Wheels : Volunteer 
 drivers are needed for the Santa Barbara&quot;Meals On Wheels&quot;program that

 your time (10am-noon) and makes a huge difference in the lives of our 
 homebound citizens. Volunteers must have your own car, drivers license 
 and insurance. Call 683-1565 9am-noon or email sbmealsonwheels@verizon.net

 Reporting From Mt. Shasta : 
 On my way to vacationing I took a picture of Mt. Shasta from my airplane and a picture of the lake where I am 
 staying, a few miles to the north of Shasta. 

 $120 Montecito Margarita : 
 The Montecito Journal reports that the San Ysidro Ranch offers a $120&quot;Montecito Margarita&quot;for those well-to-do visitors and guests that like 
 to spare no expense for entertainment. Beverage director Thomas Johnson 
 says they use two ounces of Don Julio Real tequila (normally 
 $95 per 1.5oz shot) and one ounce of Grand Marnier 150th Anniversary Orange Liqueur 
 (normally $48 per 1.5oz shot) along with fresh lime juice and pure agave 
 nectar. The ranch sells five to ten Montecito Margaritas per month and 
 occasionally sells several to the same guest in one sitting. The two 
 restaurants at the ranch are Stonehouse Restaurant and Plow&amp;Angel .

 Speaking Of Montecito : Cava Restaurant&amp;Bar on Coast Village Rd is now offering&quot; Fiesta 
 Paella &quot;every Wednesday night. This is a 3-course Spanish 
 dinner with live Flamenco guitar. Meal includes glass of Sangria, 
 Albarino or Passion Fruit iced tea. Choose from roasted tortilla 
 soup or Caesar salad. The three available Paellas are seafood, 
 chicken or vegetarian. Dessert is fresh strawberries with shaved 
 chocolate and sweet cream. Call 969-8500.

 
Monday, September 3, 2007 
 Reporting From SBA : It&apos;s 6:05am and I 
 am in the Santa Barbara airport typing 
 this blog using my new Sprint broadband Internet card and my 17&quot;Dell Inspiron 9300. I am starting an eight day 
 vacation to Copco Lake (about 1/2 mile from the Oregon border in 
 northern California), next to Mount Shasta.

 Local Paper Duped By Hoax : 
 While waiting in the airport (see above) I was reading a local paper and 
 spotted a big goof - right on the front page! The Santa Ynez 
 Valley Journal &apos;s current issue has a front page story (complete 
 with large color photo) about Mars appearing as large 
 as the moon on August 27th. Unknown to the editors (at least at 
 press-time anyway), this Mars story is a hoax that has been circulating 
 the Internet since 2003. Search Google for&quot;Mars August 27&quot;to see that 
 it is an urban legend. Here is a picture of the front page.

 Spam Spam Spam Spam : For some 
 people Spam is a daily headache that arrives in your email inbox. For 
 others Spam is a joke from a popular Monty Python comedy sketch . For the folks at L&amp;L Hawaiian 
 Barbecue in Goleta (in the University Plaza) Spam is actually 
 something you eat! Yes, L&amp;L&apos;s menu is full of food items that are 
 popular in Hawaii, and Hormel Foods&apos; SPAM is a big hit in the Aloha State. At L&amp;L you can order 
 plain Spam. Or grilled Spam (with soup). Or a Spamburger. Or a Spam&amp;egg burger. 
 Or Spam sushi. Or Spam and fried egg served with steamed rice. I wonder 
 if local resident John Cleese has ever eaten there?



 
Friday, August 31, 2007

Rockin&apos; Yogurt : Today I added Rockin&apos; Yogurt to the guide. They are located next to the Metro 4 theater on State St. 
 Speaking of frozen yogurt, I was in the city of Northridge recently and 
 spotted a Penguins frozen yogurt. I had thought they 
 were long gone! 

 Couchez Closez : Couchez Restaurant and Nightclub at 215 State St has closed their doors after 11 
 months in business. Their web site is gone and all phone calls go to 
 voice mail. A peek in the window reveals extensive remodeling going on 
 inside, with lots of new drywall going up. A rumor circulating is that 
 they plan to reopen as a nightclub-only facility.

 Vacation Time...Again : I leave on 
 vacation again (I love summer!) on Monday for 8 days. This time I am 
 going to Copco Lake in northern California, near the city of Yreka . The lake is about a half-mile from the Oregon border and a 
 friend owns a house there. Even though Internet speed at the lake is 
 horrendously slow (19kb dial-up), I should be able to keep up with my 
 blog. Keep sending your juicy news tips!

 Laptop Fridays : In case 
 your are interested in high-speed Internet over the cell phone network (aka&quot; 3G &quot;) for your laptop computer, I did some 
 research and discovered there is only one game in town: Sprint . 
 AT&amp;T and Verizon have not yet upgraded their cell towers in the Santa 
 Barbara area to handle 3G. Verizon plans to sometime next year, but that 
 launch date has been pushed back a few times already. AT&amp;T has no local 
 3G and no plans to bring 3G here anytime soon. Sprint&apos;s network is here 
 and works well. The price is $60/mo and the the PC Card required for 
 your computer is $0 after mail-in rebate. With my new-found Internet freedom, I 
 am planning to run SantaBarbara.com (and my other businesses) from Borders on State Street on Friday afternoons. Stop by and say hi. I am the guy with the 
 giant silver Dell.

 The Big Yellow Wreck : The thunder 
 and lightning we all enjoyed last evening set the perfect tone for my 
 visit to the Big Yellow House , 
 which resembles a haunted mansion these days. In this 
 column back in February I relayed a story from Coastal View News that a 
 new restaurant called the Yellow Rose would be opening in that 
 location September 1st, 2007. I drove to Summerland 
 yesterday expecting to 
 interview the new owners as they put finishing touches on their shiny 
 new restaurant. My first clue that plans had gone awry was noticing 
 that the giant sign out front still said&quot;Big Yellow House.&quot;Uh oh. As I 
 walked up to the building, I saw weeds growing out of the asphalt 
 parking lot, cracked cement steps, faded&amp;chipped paint and a broken window. 
 
 Uh oh. Upon close inspection it appears that someone started to tear 
 down the interior for a remodel and abruptly cancelled the project. In it&apos;s current 
 state of disrepair it would take a new owner a year or more to fix the wreck 
 that is the Big Yellow House. Here are some pictures I took 
 through the windows: front door , east side and west side (notice 
 blueprints neatly rolled up on the table).

 Avo Fest : Carpinteria&apos;s annual Avocado Festival is set to take place October 5-7th, 2007 along 
 Linden Avenue. This festival is packed with people every year and 
 includes lots of food and entertainment. Be sure to try the avocado 
 ice cream ! See avofest.com for details.

 Stateside Update : I spoke with Juan 
 the general manager of Stateside Restaurant&amp;Lounge that will be 
 opening in the former location of Acapulco Restaurant. He says they will 
 be opening their doors at the end of September . They will serve 
 lunch&amp;dinner, have a happy hour and also offer a late night menu. In 
 addition to being a restaurant, this 11,000 sq ft building will include 
 a lounge, a nightclub and a private room for special functions. The food 
 will be&quot;Californian cuisine with a Asian twist.&quot;

 Steak Patrol : The Santa Barbara Steak Patrol , a team that wanders the 
 city reviewing only the filet mignon, has a new recruit. Officer 
 Wedge writes a review of the filet mignon at Kona Ranch House.

 Paradise Store : Reader Steve Weixel 
 stopped at the Paradise Store&amp;Grill on highway 154 and learned that the Cold 
 Spring Tavern isn&apos;t the only business suffering a slow down of business 
 because of the Zaca Fire. The owner said business has been slow because 
 most people don&apos;t realize it&apos;s open again, and was hoping it would pick 
 up for Labor Day weekend. Pay a visit to Paradise Store!

 New Restaurant Coming to Isla Vista : McMaster&apos;s Steak&amp;Hoagie will be opening September 4th in the 
 former location of New York Buffalo 
 Wings . Owner George McMaster has opened a dozen Hoagie shops 
 around the state including several Great Western Hoagie&apos;s in Los 
 Angeles.

 Restaurant Fad In Isla Vista: Closing : 
 Reader Paul let me know that Saigon Express in Isla Vista 
 had closed. I called the number and it was disconnected. I then decided 
 to drive by 
 to see for myself and it indeed was shut down, with a sign on the door 
 saying&quot;New Management.&quot;I guess new management services are being 
 provided by the Grim Reaper . 
 While in town, I walked around and noticed that New York Buffalo 
 Wings had followed Saigon&apos;s lead and also closed its doors. Not 
 to be outdone, Eclectic I.V. appears to have joined the parade and shut down. The sign on the 
 door at Eclectic I.V. says they are remodeling and changing the menu and 
 plan to reopen in mid-September. Only the Grim Reaper knows for sure. 
 Lastly, reader Jonathon let me know that Isla Vista Spot bit the dust too. Who&apos;s next ?

 Psych! : The TV show Psych , 
 which is fictionally based in Santa Barbara (but filmed in Canada) has 
 contacted me to create the Santa Barbara wall calendar for their 
 set. I am using select photos that I took for SantaBarbara.com and 
 photos from local 
 photographer John 
 Wardlaw .

 Del Valle Coming To Goleta : Legendary reader Foodie Dan reports that Del 
 Valle Grill Mexican restaurant will be coming to 5746 Hollister Ave 
 in Goleta, replacing Lilia&apos;s Mexican 
 restaurant.

 Your Wish Is My Command : The most requested 
 new feature, average ratings , has now been fulfilled. The guide 
 now has sortable columns for name, average food&amp;service rating, price and number of reviews. Tip : sorting 
 by number of reviews in the various cuisine categories often gives the 
 most accurate picture of the best restaurants.

 Cold Spring Tavern Reopens : Head for 
 the hills! Cold Spring 
 Tavern , which is suffering a serious slow down in business 
 because of threats caused by the Zaca Fire, has reopened. During the 
 darkest hour, highway 154 was closed and the fire crews wrapped the 
 entire restaurant with a foil shield to protect it from fire incase the 
 flames suddenly turned toward the tavern. Matt Bush, manager of the 
 tavern, tells me that the news media gave extensive coverage of the 
 restaurants closing but hardly printed a word about it reopening. Matt 
 says that many people mistakenly think that the restaurant and highway 
 154 are still closed which has caused business to drop off 
 significantly. I am showing support by making the Cold Spring Tavern 
 SantaBarbara.coms Restaurant of the Month for September. I also 
 brought a party of five for a delicious dinner at the tavern last Friday 
 night. Show your support for the Cold Spring Tavern and head for the 
 hills for dinner!
  To prove I actually went to the tavern, I took some pictures to share with you: Cold Spring Tavern , your 
 friendly tavern crew , Treasures 
 and Trash , the bar , our party of five , bobcat head , bear head , moose head , not-sure-what-it-is head .

 Coming Soon : 
 Reader Foodie Dan tells me that Creekside bar has 
 a sign saying that a restaurant will be opening soon that mentions 
 something to the effect of&quot; Jakes BBQ and Briskets .&quot;I remember a 
 guy named Jake launched a kabob restaurant at that location 2 1/2 years 
 ago that ended up in restaurant Heaven. Perhaps he has returned to Earth 
 for a second try? 
 
Friday, August 24, 2007

 Online Menu : Del Pueblo Cafe in Goleta has a new web site (delpueblocafe.biz) that includes their 
 menu. I now link to their home page and menu in the restaurant guide.

 Jobs At Stateside : Stateside Restaurant&amp;Lounge will be opening soon at 1114 State St (former location of the 
 Acapulco Restaurant) and is now hiring for all positions. Email: info@statesidesb.com
 
Thursday, August 23, 2007

 Chill-out Town : A controversy is 
 brewing over the exterior paint job recently added to Chili Town on 
 North Milpas. Apparently the entire front of the building was painted to 
 be one big, exceptionally&quot;groovy&quot;sign indicating the name of 
 the business. Now there is a battle between those that call it art 
 and those who say it breaks the city&apos;s sign ordinance. Perhaps the owner 
 should paint a giant blue line across the front of the building to make 
 peace with the city.

 Arrivederci Maria : Reader Foodie 
 Dan spotted an ad that says that the restaurant&amp;equipment owned by Maria&apos;s Italian 
 Kitchen in Five Points Shopping Center is for sale for $350k.

 Sizzler Robbed : Sizzler Restaurant on Hollister in Goleta was the victim of an armed robbery. Bahram 
 Jabaroghli of Pasadena held up the restaurant and was ultimately 
 captured after employees from Toyota (across the street) pointed him out 
 to police as the suspect. Reader Andi directs you to see this YouTube 
 video of the commotion surrounding the robbery. Mr. 
 Jabaroghli receives SantaBarbara.com&apos;s first-ever Idiot Of The Month Award.

 Bay Brunch : Bay Cafe at 
 131 Anacapa St has started offering a Saturday&amp;Sunday brunch. They 
 also now offer wine tasting Fri-Sun and live music Thu-Sun (6-9pm). Call 
 963-2215

 Esau&apos;s Update : As reported in 
 this column in June, Esau&apos;s Cafe , which closed on State Street last year after 52 
 years of service, is planning to reopen on Chapala St. The grand opening 
 has been moved from November to December.
 
Wednesday, August 22, 2007

 Ashes To Ashes : When I left my car 
 at the Santa Barbara Airport parking lot 12 days ago to go on vacation, 
 my 1989 Nissan Maxima was spotless . Here is how it looked when I 
 arrived home, courtesy of the Zaca fire (see photos of windshield and roof ). I imagine the car wash 
 places are making a fortune right now with all the ash being dumped on 
 the South Coast. If your car is as dirty as mine, the cheapest car wash I know 
 of is Fairview Car Wash that has a 
 new drive-thru exterior wash for only $9 .

 Let&apos;s Do Zen Yai : Reader Huyen as 
 informed me that ever-popular Thai dinner spot Zen Yai at 425 
 State St has started serving lunch. She tells me that lunch hours are 
 Tues-Fri, 11:30-2:15. Zen Yai has a special lunch menu, in addition to 
 their regular menu.

 Pizza Wars : Reader Jeramy informs me 
 that my 8/14/07 rumor about Giovanni&apos;s Pizza coming to the Mesa is not really a rumor - it&apos;s fact. Apparently Giovanni&apos;s owns 
 the plot of land that is currently being redeveloped. There will be retail 
 and office space in addition to Giovanni&apos;s. Giovanni&apos;s is set to join Mesa Pizza Company , Dean-o&apos;s and Domino&apos;s in 
 an all-out Mesa pizza war!

 Secret Menu - Part Two : In-n-Out Burger (4865 Calle Real, Goleta), was founded in 1948 in Los Angeles and 
 inspires loyalty that other restaurant chains can only dream of. Part of 
 this mystique comes from their secret, unpublished menu (see yesterday&apos;s 
 column for Part One). Next time you&apos;re at In-N-Out Burger, order one 
 these off-the-menu specials: Fries&quot;Well-Done&quot;= extra crispy fries 
 (excellent!). Fries&quot;Light&quot;= opposite of fries well-done, more raw than 
 normal.&quot;2-by-4&quot;= two meat patties and four slices of cheese.&quot;Flying 
 Dutchman&quot;= two meat patties, two slices of cheese and nothing else - 
 not even a bun!&quot;Veggie Burger&quot;= burger without the patty or cheese 
 (huh?). Extra Toast leaves your bread on the grill a tad longer 
 resulting in crispy buns.&quot;Neapolitan&quot;Shake = strawberry, vanilla and 
 chocolate blended together.
 
Tuesday, August 21, 2007

 Reporting From SB : I arrived home 
 last night to nice cool, dry weather, a welcome relief from the humid, 
 95 degree nights in the Lone Star State - which explains the huge real 
 estate price differential mentioned yesterday. I noticed a smoothie shop 
 in the main lobby of the airport. I&apos;ll have to add it to the guide!

 Secret Menu : In-n-Out Burger (4865 Calle Real, Goleta), was founded in 1948 in Los Angeles and 
 inspires loyalty that other restaurant chains can only dream of. Part of 
 this mystique comes from their secret, unpublished menu. Next time you&apos;re 
 at In-N-Out Burger, order one these off-the-menu specials:&quot;Animal 
 Style&quot;= the meat is cooked and fried with mustard and then pickles are 
 added, extra spread and grilled onions are added.&quot;Animal Style Fries&quot;= 
 fries with cheese, spread, grilled onions and pickles.&quot;Protein Style&quot;= 
 burger with no bun (wrapped in lettuce).&quot;3-by-3&quot;= three meat patties 
 and three slices of cheese. Also available: 4x4 on up to 100x100 
 (really!).&quot;Double Meat&quot;= like a Double Double without cheese.&quot;Grilled 
 Cheese&quot;= no meat, just melted cheese, tomato, lettuce and spread on a 
 bun. Tomorrow: Secret Menu - Part Two.

 Visual Update : Two restaurants 
 are coming to La Cumbre Plaza in November. Here are pictures of Ruth&apos;s Chris Steakhouse and Marmalade Cafe in their 
 current state of construction.

 Reporting From 27,000 ft : 
 I am flying home to the smokey South Coast today. Just before I left 
 Friendswood, Texas, I spotted a flier for a home for sale across the street from where I have been visiting. Though Texas locals 
 would think nothing of it, the flier is quite shocking for anyone used to the 
 high price of real estate in Santa Barbara. Here is a photo of the mansion I am 
 talking about. Specs: Single family home, 4 bedrooms, 3 full&amp;1 half 
 baths, includes kitchen + breakfast room + living room + study/library + 
 den + game room + laundry room + food pantry, 2 car detached garage, 2 story, build sq ft: 3,384, lot 
 size 1/3 acre. Price: $329,000

 Fess Parker Opens Restaurant Marcella : Fess Parkers 
 Wine Country Inn has a new sign out front, proudly displaying,&quot;Restaurant Marcella&quot;.&quot;It has a nice ring to it,&quot;explains Fess Parker, 
 the gracious host and former actor, who brought Davy Crockett and Daniel 
 Boone into America&apos;s living rooms from the mid-50s until 1970. 
 Restaurant Marcella replaces Wine Cask and Intermezzo, the Santa Barbara 
 restaurant company that managed the food and beverage operation at the 
 inn for the past two years. The restaurant will serve breakfast, lunch 
 and dinner to locals, day visitors and its overnight guests. Carlos De 
 Leon, General Manager of Fess Parkers Wine Country Inn, will also 
 oversee the restaurant operation. Shannon Cummins, former Sous Chef for 
 Bacara Resort, has been named Executive Chef of Restaurant Marcella. 
 
 Carl&apos;s Coming To Carp : The 
 Coastal View News reports that the former location of Coco&apos;s Restaurant 
 in Carpinteria, a long-vacant property visible from the 101 freeway, 
 will become a Carl&apos;s Jr. The building and 1.14 acres of 
 land, located at 4610 Carpinteria Ave, was recently purchased for 
 approximately $2.5 million by CKE Restaurants Inc, the parent company of 
 Carl&apos;s Jr.

 Reporting From Texas : 
 This is the final day of my vacation. I decided to fly home Monday in 
 advance of Hurricane Dean which is apparently 
 meandering my way (near Houston). Even NASA has decided to pack it in. 
 They are bringing the Space Shuttle home a day early so they will have 
 time to evacuate employees at nearby Johnson Space Center. 
  Speaking of evacuating , that&apos;s what I felt like doing 
 after they served my entree at Santa Barbara Italian Cafe here in Friendswood, Texas. I suppose it was my own fault for ordering a 
 Filet Mignon at an Italian restaurant, but it was one of the specials 
 mentioned by our waiter. My steak, which was ordered medium-rare, came 
 very well-done. Occasionally I receive a medium when ordering 
 medium-rare, but I have never had a steak arrive incinerated like this 
 little piece of charcoal. Worse yet, I suspect the meat was not even 
 Filet Mignon. After having experienced nearly a dozen Filet Mignons to 
 create the Steak Patrol guide, I don&apos;t 
 recall anything looking or tasting like this. The steak was not the only 
 disappointment. The restaurant had nothing to do with Santa Barbara, 
 other than using the name. No stucco and terra cotta. No Spanish-Moorish 
 interior. No picture of the Mission. They didn&apos;t even serve wine. While 
 I was there I took a couple of pictures ( outside , inside ). Perhaps this restaurant 
 didn&apos;t borrow their name from the South Coast after all (though I 
 strongly suspect they did). I searched Google and discovered a Santa 
 Barbara, Italy .
  
Saturday, August 18, 2007

 Reporting From Texas : 
 As promised in this column earlier this year, I will visit Santa 
 Barbara Italian Cafe tonight, which is a restaurant near where 
 I am currently vacationing near Houston, Texas. Will they have stucco 
 walls and terra cotta tiles? Will there be a picture of the Mission? 
 Will they serve Santa Barbara wine? The secrets of this mysterious South 
 Coast outpost will be revealed in tomorrow&apos;s column! FYI, Hurricane Dean is rapidly heading my way. NASA&apos;s Johnson Space 
 Center, located just 15 minutes from where I am typing this column, is 
 considering cutting short the current space shuttle mission in case Dean 
 tries to do a Katrina to Mission Control. I might fly home this week as 
 planned. Or I might instead be in a monstrous freeway traffic jam 
 heading to safer ground! 
 
Friday, August 17, 2007

 Reporting From Texas : 
 The Earth-shaking news that Firestone Vineyards has 
 sold their winery to Foley Estates has managed to send tremors all the 
 way to Friendswood, Texas, where I am vacationing. It is hard to believe 
 that the family would part from such an important part of their history. 
 I am sure it was in their best interest and I wish them well.

 Reporting From New Orleans : I am leaving New Orleans today 
 and heading to Texas. Here are a variety of pictures from around the 
 city, mostly in the French Quarter: John at the Mississippi river , St. Louis 
 Cathedral , Bourbon Street sign , Bourbon Street , building , building ,&quot; Love 
 Acts &quot;, building , statues of music legends , restaurant , the popular Pat O&apos;Brien&apos;s bar, courtyard&amp;fountain , building , mannequin , Superdome . 
 
New Tasting Room : Kalyra , the only 
 local winery actually mentioned by name in the movie Sideways, has 
 opened a tasting room on this side of the mountains. It is two blocks 
 from the beach at 212 State St, across from the train station and is 
 open every day from Noon 7pm. Call 965-8606

 Rumor Of The Day : There is 
 a rumor floating around that Kahuna Grill in Camino Real Marketplace is looking to open another location in 
 downtown Santa Barbara. This might be completely untrue or a brilliant 
 forecast of future events. Your call. 
 
Wednesday, August 15, 2007 

 Reporting From New Orleans : I 
 visited a high-end seafood restaurant today named Bourbon House located, of course, on Bourbon Street, in the French Quarter. This was 
 highly recommended by a friend who is a local. It is a relatively new 
 restaurant run by Dickie Brennan, a BIG name in town, who operates 
 several of the high-end local eateries. We ordered a seafood platter for 
 our table and my friend recommended the&quot;Redfish on a Shell&quot;as an 
 example of a very local cuisine. Redfish can be ordered in many other 
 cities but serving it&quot;on the shell&quot;, meaning they crisp one side of the 
 fish so that it becomes a platter from which you scoop your meal, is 
 only served in New Orleans. It was amazing and comes with crab and 
 sauted onions on top. I&apos;ll have to talk to the Palace Grill to see if they would consider offering this dish! Here are some pictures 
 of Bourbon House ( outside , inside , oyster bar , seafood platter , redfish on a shell ). The interior 
 design was great and even included second floor balconies (with dining 
 tables) designed to look like the external balconies on nearly every 
 building in the French Quarter. 

 New Business Park : 
 The 92-acre Cabrillo Business Park at Hollister Ave and Los Carneros Rd 
 has received approval from the City of Goleta to triple in size, adding 
 650,000 square feet of space. I am told that the expansion will add 
 retail space, including a restaurant.

 All You Can Scarf : Q&apos;s Sushi A Go Go now offers&quot;All You Can Eat&quot;sushi. Mon-Thu 7pm-9:30pm for $25. 
 

Tuesday, August 14, 2007 

 Reporting From New Orleans : Today I endured 100 degree 
 weather, high humidity and wandered down Bourbon Street. The news said 
 it was the hottest day of the year in town. I met up with a friend&apos;s 
 dad, Dr. Marx, who is a professor at Tulane University in New Orleans. 
 He showed me around the French Quarter and pointed out a very 
 significant landmark: Antoine&apos;s . Antoine&apos;s is the 
 oldest restaurant in America and has been run by the same family since 
 1840. Here are some pictures ( outside 
 1 , outside 2 , sign , inside ). Dr Marx tells me that 
 only tourists sit in the front room by the entrance and locals always 
 request a seat in one of the many charming interior dining rooms. They 
 don&apos;t take reservations and can be crowded so the only way to get a 
 table in advance is to know a waiter. Locals call their favorite waiter 
 and request a table be set aside. Again, only locals know how to do it 
 right!

 Tea Room : Reader Huyen came down 
 from Hearst Castle recently and stopped in downtown Lompoc and had a 
 wonderful lunch at Penelope&apos;s Teas&amp;Gifts. She said this is the only 
 tearoom in Santa Barbara County and that it was delightful. They have 
 over 60 different loose-leaf teas, British-style entrees for lunch and 
 have a charming decor. 105 West Ocean Ave, Lompoc, CA, 805-736-1122

 Rumor Of The Day : Reader 
 Nick tells me that he heard that the construction at the corner of Meigs 
 Rd and Cliff Dr (the former location of a gas station) will include a 
 Giovanni&apos;s Pizza. Right next door to that location is the Mesa Pizza 
 Company.

 Reporting From New Orleans : This 
 blog is being written from the La Quinta Inn at 301 Camp St in New 
 Orleans, Louisiana. Today Flip and I (and his 2 kids) visited the Tabasco factory on Avery Island. Though 90% of the peppers are grown 
 in South America, every bottle of Tabasco is packaged here in Avery. 
 Here are some pictures of the factory ( welcome 
 sign , factory floor , barrel of pepper mash ). Later in the day 
 we ended up at Hard Rock Cafe in New Orleans then had dessert at the 
 famous Cafe Du Monde that has been serving coffee since the 
 1860&apos;s ( outside pic , inside pic , landmark plaque ).

 Speaking Of Tabasco : About six 
 years ago, I was having lunch at Cajun Kitchen - Goleta (at that time they were located near the airport) when a friend told me 
 about his favorite dip for french fries. He said he likes to put a 
 little bit of ketchup on his plate and pour Tabasco sauce on 
 it. I thought that was kind of odd but was willing to give it a try. To 
 my total surprise, the taste was absolutely amazing . Don&apos;t go 
 over board with the Tabasco, just drizzle a little bit on top of a small 
 pile of ketchup. Ever since that fateful day, I have used ketchup&amp;Tabasco for almost every type of potato dish that comes my way. Most 
 frequently the destination is french fries and hash browns, but the secret sauce is now starting to make its way on to the burger too. 
 Where will it end? Give it a try.

 Chili Town Opens On Milpas : Reader Aubrey tipped me off to 
 the arrival of Chili 
 Town at 730 N. Milpas, the former location of the DogHouse . 
 Chili Town specializes in chili char burgers ( see 
 picture of menu) and is run by Mark Abrishami, who also owns Luigis 
 Pizza&amp;Pasta in Goleta. Everything is made fresh, including the 
 burgers, the chili and even the bun. Luigis in Goleta started offering 
 chili burgers and they soon became very popular. Expanding the burger 
 selection at an Italian restaurant would go against the theme so Mark 
 decided to instead start a new restaurant that specialized in fresh char 
 burgers. You can also order hot dogs, chili dogs, corn dogs, fries, 
 chili fries, onion rings, a shake or a sundae.

 New In The Guide : Yesterday 
 reader Huyen wrote me an enthusiastic email about Laguna Store&amp;Deli at 512 Laguna Street so I added them to the deli section of the guide 
 today. Here is her message:&quot;I had a giant Carne Asada Chimichanga there 
 for only $5.00! They serve mainly Mexican food and hamburgers too. Beer&amp;Wine, basic convenient market items too. Very reasonable prices and 
 they also have patio seating and a parking lot.&quot;

 Time For A Vacation : I am leaving 
 on a plane this morning to visit my good friend Flip in Friendswood, 
 Texas (just south of Houston). I&apos;ll be gone for two weeks and it will be 
 insanely hot and humid (which will make me appreciate Santa Barbara that 
 much more!) As part of the vacation, Flip and I will be driving to New 
 Orleans. It will be the first time there for both of us. Flip started 
 his professional life working at McDonald&apos;s in Victoria Court on State 
 Street and now is a doctor with a mansion and a swimming pool. How&apos;s 
 that for climbing the corporate ladder? I&apos;ll keep in touch from the 
 road.
 
 Thursday, August 9, 2007 

 Pavilion Gardens : Reader Foodie Dan tells me that a new 
 restaurant is coming to 415 N. Milpas St, the former location of Hibachi 
 and, more recently, Las Brisas. It will be called Pavilion Gardens . 
 I stopped by to take a peek and the place is completely gutted. No need 
 to start forming a line outside just yet.

 Breakfast Barn : The Burger 
 Barn at 3621 Sagunto in Santa Ynez has started serving breakfast on 
 weekends. They are now serving omelets, waffles, pancakes, french toast 
 and south of the border specials. Hours Mon-Fri 11am-3pm, Sat-Sun 
 8am-4pm.

 Summerland Special : Cafe Luna at 
 2354 Lillie Ave in Summerland has three specials going on right now. 
 Mondays: free medium cup of coffee 7-10am. Wednesdays: buy one pastry 
 get one free. Fridays: free iced tea with your lunch order.
 
 Wednesday, August 8, 2007 

 La Arcada Update : Two restaurants will be opening soon in 
 La Arcada (1114 State St). Stateside Restaurant&amp;Lounge, which is 
 replacing Acapulco Restaurant, will offer a lunch to late night menu 
 with a California-Asian focus. Petite Valentien, occupying the former 
 location of Bogart&apos;s Cafe, will offer small plates and tapas.

 Breaking Down The Walls : Reader John tells me that Beachbreak Cafe in downtown Santa Barbara has taken over the space occupied by an 
 adjacent business, doubling the restaurant&apos;s size. As SantaBarbara.com&apos;s 
 very first&quot;Restaurant of the Month&quot;in October 2004, not long after 
 they opened, I am happy to see Beachbreak continue to do well. Their 
 food and service were excellent and it inspired me to create the monthly 
 honor.

 Gimme S&apos;more : I 
 was dining at Holdrens in Thousand Oaks recently and discovered 
 that they have an unusual dessert offering real smores that you roast 
 right at your dinner table. I overheard the people next to me ordering 
 this so I asked my kind waiter Chad if he could give me a demonstration. 
 Before I knew it, he brought out a small flaming goblet on plate of 
 colored stones (see photo ). 
 What follows the fire is familiar to everyone: marshmallows, graham 
 crackers, chocolate bars and, of course, cooking sticks! After a lengthy 
 discussion about iPhones with Chad, he told me that this classic 
 campfire dessert is also available at Holdren&apos;s Steaks&amp;Seafood in Santa Barbara.

 Father (and Mother) Knows 
 Best : I had lunch recently with my parents and discovered 
 that they have a favorite burger in town: the $6.79 Mushroom-Swiss 
 Burger at Chili&apos;s in Goleta. They like to stop at Chilis after a Costco run. The burger 
 comes with sauted mushrooms, aged Swiss cheese, mayo, shredded lettuce, 
 tomato&amp;pickle, all on a bed of fries. In addition to enjoying the 
 food, Mom said to tell you that the service at Chili&apos;s is excellent.

 Corkage Fees : 
 There is an interesting discussion going on between Curtis, Larry, Art, 
 JB and Mike about corkage fees on the Trattoria Vittoria page.

 Brown Pelican Update : Apparently Brown Pelican&apos;s 25-year 
 lease ends this December, which is the reason the County is taking 
 action now to look for new management. The current management has begun 
 a letter-writing campaign (2981 Cliff Drive, Santa Barbara CA 93109) to 
 drum up support. One look at the reviews from locals over the past year 
 tells me that they have their work cut out for them. An employee of 
 Brown Pelican told me recently that they couldn&apos;t take their visiting 
 mother to dinner at their own restaurant because the food was so bad. 
 That&apos;s exactly what they said. I haven&apos;t eaten there in over 5 years so 
 I personally haven&apos;t had a bad experience there. Perhaps it is time to 
 pay a visit! I&apos;ll report back here to let you know how it goes.

 Taste Of The Nation : A nationwide culinary benefit, Taste 
 of the Nation, supports the fight to end childhood hunger in America and 
 is in the planning stages to bring their event to Santa Barbara. The 
 event attracts over 50,000 guests each year nationwide. Sponsored by 
 American Express, the benefits are held in different cities, which 
 include food and wine tastings, seated dinners and outdoor barbeques. 
 For details, see TasteOfTheNation.org

 Change Of Guard At The Brown Pelican : Reader Foodie Dan tells 
 me he saw a bid acceptance proposal from the County of Santa 
 Barbara, requesting bids to operate the restaurant and snack bar at 
 Hendrys Beach, currently occupied by the Brown Pelican restaurant. They have put out a similar notice for the concession stand 
 at Jalama Beach. Here is a quote from the press release: 
 
The County of Santa Barbara/Parks Department is seeking a 
 corporation, business, or individual to lease and operate a 
 restaurant and snack bar at Arroyo Burro Beach County Park. The 
 licensed premises consist of an area of approximately 3,600 square 
 feet of lease space located at Arroyo Burro Beach County Park, 2981 
 Cliff Drive, Santa Barbara, California 93109. The intent of this RFP 
 process is to result in a concession lease agreement for a 
 restaurant and snack bar at Arroyo Burro Beach County Park.
 
 New Indian Restaurant : The 
 explosion of new Indian restaurants in Santa Barbara continues! Back 
 in May I mentioned in this column about a new restaurant named Saffron opening at 113 W. De La Guerra St (near Chapala). Reader 
 John confirms that this will be an Indian restaurant. Flavor of 
 India used to be the only game in town. Over the last few years 
 Santa Barbara has seen a variety of choices appear on State St 
 including All India Caf, Spice Avenue and The Taj Caf. Isla Vista 
 saw the opening of Indian restaurant Naan Stop last year.

 Restaurant Of 
 the Month : Max&apos;s Restaurant on upper State Street is being highlighted this month in the 
 SantaBarbara.com Restaurant Guide. Owner Henrietta Forystek started 
 working at the restaurant in 1984 and became owner in 2002. She 
 tells me that she was impressed by the way everything is made from 
 scratch and continues the tradition. Popular breakfast items include 
 souffl-style omelets (Brie omelet and Guatemalan omelet), orange 
 pecan pancakes, corned beef hash and turkey sausage (all made from 
 scratch). You can even use a French press to make gourmet coffee 
 right at your table. Lunches include soups made from scratch (clam 
 chowder plus soup-of-the-day), Santa Fe turkey melt and more. Their 
 popular salads include albacore tuna, cobb and muffelata salads.

 Jazz Dinner At SOhO : Minnie 
 Driver&amp;Special Guest, Sunday, August 12th, 8pm, $23/$18 with 
 dinner, all ages. Harp Magazine says:&quot;Minnie Driver isnt like most 
 actors who treat making records as a hobby. Shes actually good... 
 Volleying between lush, ethereal, British pop melodies and 
 easy-strumming Americana, the disc is composed of songs about all 
 kinds of love... Ever since [landing a deal with Zo/Rounder 
 Records] shes been blasting holes in the actor-singer stigma.&quot; SOhO Restaurant&amp;Music 
 Club . Call for reservations 962-7776

 Fiesta Dignatarios at the Zoo : 
 Yesterday I took 99 
 pictures of happy faces wandering the hilltop at the Santa 
 Barbara Zoo for the Fiesta Dignatarios celebration. I then 
 fired up my digital movie camera and wandered the dance floor and 
 grounds.

 The Habit Sold : Owners Brent and 
 Bruce Reichard have sold an 80 percent stake of their Habit hamburger 
 chain to a group of investors lead by Karp Reilly in Connecticut. As 
 part of the deal to sell the 20-location chain, founded in Goleta in the 
 late 1960&apos;s, the Reichard&apos;s will retain 100% ownership of all Santa 
 Barbara and Goleta Habit locations. The new owners plan to expand 
 rapidly, opening 16 new restaurant locations over the next two years.

 Dine and Dash : Five juveniles 
 left Denny&apos;s in 
 Goleta without paying their $55 bill. They were last seen 
 fleeing in a&quot;newer Volkswagen Beetle.&quot;

 It Lives Up To The Hype : I 
 finally broke down and bought an iPhone . I researched the thing 
 to death but couldn&apos;t decide whether or not to make the leap until my 
 friend let me borrow hers. Only Steve Jobs could have the vision and 
 determination to dictate the creation of a phone so advanced and easy to 
 use at the same time. And this is coming from a guy who has never owned 
 a Mac. I have retired my relatively new, previously cutting-edge web&amp;email-enabled Treo 700wx cell phone. It is a dinosaur by comparison. The iPhone doesnt just bring Internet bells&amp;whistles to the table 
 it reinvents voice mail too. With the iPhone, your voice mail 
 automatically downloads directly into the phone so you can listen to 
 them in any order, just like email. Given that the iPhone is already 
 years ahead of everything else on the market, and will only get better 
 and cheaper over time, Motorola, Nokia and the rest of the cell phone 
 industry must be shaking in their boots. The Blackberry will be with us 
 forever, but most other&quot;smart&quot;phones might be extinct in 5 years. I 
 can pretty much run my SantaBarbara.com from the iPhone, which means 
 less back strain from sitting in an office chair and a better tan!

 Fiesta Pequena : 
 Last night I went to opening ceremonies of Fiesta. I took some pictures&amp;movies to 
 share with you! 
 
 Wednesday, August 1, 2007 

 Fiesta : It&apos;s finally here! Check out a complete list of events .

 State Side Open For Fiesta : 
 Reader Huyen emailed me my first Fiesta tip! Though the grand opening is 
 later this year, Stateside Restaurant at 1114 State St (the 
 former location of Acapulco ) will be opening their patio for drinks and finger food 
 during Fiesta. Open Wednesday through Saturday...afternoons and 
 evenings. DJ will be playing background lounge and house music every 
 evening.
 
 Tuesday, July 31, 2007 

 Joe&apos;s Cafe Opens Today : The grand 
 opening was delayed a month but it was worth it. Remodeled to its 
 original 1928-era look, Joes Caf is ready for Fiesta!

 Goleta Welcomes Mediterranean Caf : Mediterra , a 
 local ethnic market near Sizzler in Goleta, has expanded its offerings to include a 
 full Mediterranean Caf that specializes in Turkish cuisine, coffee and 
 tea. Founded by Nell Demir and Julia Komili, the new caf, open 11am-2pm 
 Mon-Sat, also serves Armenian, Greek and Middle-Eastern food. They 
 decided to add the caf because many customers of their popular market 
 wanted to sample the products on the store shelves. All ingredients of 
 the cafs meals (including their popular Greek Gyro) can be purchased 
 right at Mediterra. Each cup of Turkish tea is hand-made using an 
 urn-shaped silver-plated samovar. You can have your Turkish coffee made 
 with a Turkish bean, Greek bean or Lebanese bean, all imported from 
 their respective countries, and all available for sale at the market. 
 5575 Hollister Ave, Goleta. (805) 696-9323

 Trivia Of The Day : Borders 
 bookstores uses Seattle&apos;s Best as their in-house coffee shop. 
 Barnes&amp;Noble instead uses Starbucks to deliver their java. 
 However, which ever chain you decide to use as the source of your next 
 steaming latte, your money ends up in the same bank account. Starbucks 
 acquired Seattle&apos;s Best in 2003.
 
 Monday, July 30, 2007 

 Chili Town Coming To Milpas : Reader Aubrey sent me a tip about a new burger place 
 opening at 730 N. Milpas St, the former location of the DogHouse . 
 I spoke with the owner, Mark Abrishami and he said the restaurant will 
 be named Chili Town and will specialize in chili burgers. He 
 expects to be open in about 10 days. 

 New Yogurt Shop Opening On State : Reader Aubrey also informs me that a new eatery called
 Rockin&apos; Yogurt is opening on State St in mid-August. 

 Dinner With The O&apos;s : In 1999, Goleta 
 introduced a meal that caught lots of attention: the $1.50 pup&amp;cup 
 lunch at Costco . 
 Not one to be outdone, Montecito has finally responded with an 
 attention-getting meal of its own: the $50,000 Dinner . On 
 September 8 th 2007, media mogul Oprah Winfrey is lending her 
 support to presidential hopeful Senator Barack Obama by hosting a 
 fundraiser at her East Valley Rd estate. A $50K pledge will win a dinner 
 with Miss Winfrey and the candidate.

 Update : Renaud&apos;s Patisserie and Bistro , first announced in this blog July 
 13th, plans to open by mid-September in Loreto Plaza, says the Santa 
 Barbara News-Press. Owner Renaud 
 Gonthier will offer breakfast&amp;lunch, including traditional French 
 pastries and sandwiches.

 Tequila Dinner : 
 Restaurant Zaffiro presents a Patron Spirits Dinner, Aug 1, 7pm. $34.95 per person. Call 
 968-6201

 Undiscovered : 
 The Discovery Store in Paseo Nuevo Mall closed its doors for good 
 yesterday. I walked in just as they were selling the last of their stock 
 at a discount. I enjoyed this store and am sad to see it go. I asked the 
 soon-to-be-unemployed lady at the sales counter if she knew what 
 business will be the next tenant in this space and she didn&apos;t know.
 
 Friday, July 27, 2007 

 Coming Soon : Reader Aubrey tells me that a new burger place 
 is opening at 730 N. Milpas St, the former location of the DogHouse .

 Freebirds Sold : The popular Freebirds World 
 Burrito , opened in Isla Vista in 1987 by Mark Orfalea and Pierre 
 Dube, has been sold to Tavistock Restaurants LLC, a private investment 
 company based in Emeryville, CA. Tavistock owns about two dozens cafes 
 and breweries coast to coast, in addition to investments in sports, real 
 estate, biotechnology and financial services. There are seven other 
 Freebirds locations, all in Texas. Tavistock has ambitious plans to 
 expand Freebirds, with a target of 60 new locations over the next five 
 years. Mark Orfalea&apos;s cousin, Paul Orfalea, also started a little 
 business in Isla Vista that became very successful. It&apos;s called Kinko&apos;s .

 Ventura Fever : It appears that 
 the hottest thing for a Santa Barbara restaurant to do these days is 
 expand to Ventura. Brophy Bros. , a popular seafood restaurant at the Santa Barbara 
 Harbor just opened their second location, this time at the Ventura 
 Harbor. It even has the look and feel of the Santa Barbara location, 
 complete with upstairs outdoor dining and a full bar. The southbound 
 parade continues with Holdren&apos;s Steaks&amp;Seafood (2 locations), Cajun Kitchen (7 
 locations) and Blenders in the Grass (12 locations) all setting up shop in 
 Ventura County in the last 6 months. Even I am guilty of catching 
 Ventura fever. Two years after launching SantaBarbara.com, I started Ventura.com and expanded my restaurant guide to the south.
 
 Wednesday, July 25, 2007 

 The Birds : Many restaurants with 
 outdoor patios suffer from hungry-bird attacks that would make Alfred 
 Hitchcock proud. The DoubleTree Resort in Santa Barbara, which has 
 several eateries and regular outdoor wedding buffets, has come up with a 
 solution; they hired Stephanie Sayre at Sky Patrol . Sky Patrol is 
 owned by Tony Sufferdini of Simi Valley. Stephanie wanders the premises 
 with an Auger Hawk from Africa named&quot;Arrow&quot;, a Saker Falcon (also from Africa) named&quot;Clint&quot;, and a Tawny Owl from Europe 
 named&quot;Groovy.&quot;They are perched on her leather glove to scare away 
 birds and it works I saw it first hand. Sparrows&amp;seagulls, a common 
 nuisance at the resort, take one look at these predators and disappear. 
 With humans, Stephanie&apos;s birds have the opposite effect - they draw a 
 crowd! I took pictures of Stephanie holding Arrow the Hawk ( photo ) 
 and Groovy the Owl ( photo 1 , photo 2 ). The birds are on duty at the DoubleTree Resort Fri-Sun 
 through Labor Day.

 Speaking Of The DoubleTree : Today 
 I added Cafe Los 
 Arcos to the restaurant guide. Cafe Los Arcos is an American 
 restaurant located inside the DoubleTree Resort and is open every day 
 6:30am-10pm.

 New Mediterranean Cafe in Goleta : 
 Reader Foodie Dan let me know that a new restaurant Mediterra Cafe&amp;Market has opened near Sizzler in Goleta. I have now added it to the guide. 
 Owner Nell Demir tells me they are open for lunch Mon-Sat and that they 
 offer&quot;delicious Italian, Greek, Turkish. Armenian, Iranian, Kosher 
 specialties and imported gift items.&quot;
 
 Tuesday, July 24, 2007

 Market Research : My three nieces 
 Katy, Victoria&amp;Heather are visiting from Reston, Virginia. Spotting a 
 market research opportunity, I asked them for a restaurant-related idea 
 for my column. Without hesitation, Victoria told me KFC doesnt have 
 dessert. Intrigued by this shocking news, I checked out the KFC in Goleta and, at first glance, it appears she was right - that they dont offer 
 any dessert. As I looked more carefully at the menu (above the cash 
 register) I finally noticed in small print off to the side, a mention of 
 cake&amp;pudding.
 
 Monday, July 23, 2007 

 Black&amp;Blue Ball : I attended the Black&amp;Blue Ball at the 
 Doubletree resort yesterday along with about 1000 other extremely happy 
 locals. All monies raised at this event 
 benefit the local chapter of the Muscular Dystrophy Association. I have 
 put online pictures and a movie from the 
 event. 

 Did He Order The King Crab? : The 
 reigning monarch of Jordan, King Abdullah II was seen driving a 
 Harley-Davidson motorcycle last Thursday with his son and 11 friends 
 (not to mention a fleet of U.S. Secret Service agents) along Stearns 
 Wharf to dine at the Harbor Restaurant . 
 His Santa Barbara stop is part of motorcycle trip down the coast of 
 California.

 New Weekend Brunch : Starting this weekend, Zaffiro Restaurant begins serving brunch on Saturdays and Sundays, 10am-2pm. Take a sneak 
 peek at their new brunch menu .
 
 Thursday, July 19, 2007 

 The Habit Opening Near La Cumbre Plaza : The Habit will 
 open in February 2008 at 3890 La Cumbre Plaza Lane, the former location 
 of Kayser Nutrition, behind Vons . The Habit first opened in the late 1960&apos;s as the&quot;Hamburger Habit&quot;in Isla Vista and Goleta. The current owners, brothers 
 Bruce and Brent Reichard, purchased the Habit in 1980 and have since 
 expanded to 21 outlets, located in Goleta, Santa Barbara, Ventura, Los

 Monte Cristo : As a follow-up to my July 3&amp;12 blogs, 
 reader Maritza and reader Fran both sent emails letting me know that A Capella Restaurant on Bath St also sells the Monte Cristo sandwich. A Monte Cristo sandwich 
 consists of ham, turkey, and Swiss cheese between two slices of bread, 
 soaked in an egg-based batter and grilled or deep-fried. The sandwich is 
 often served with fresh fruit or with maple syrup on the side.
 Breakfast Burritos : Reader Aubrey asked me to ask you which 
 restaurant serves the best breakfast burrito . Please email me with your opinion!
 Reader Margie suggests Longhorn Coffee 
 Shop in Santa Ynez Reader Darrol says The 805 Deli is the&quot;best in town by far&quot;. Lito&apos;s on Haley 
 is next on his list. Reader Lemonjelly suggests Metropulos , 
 with bacon and a dollop of sour cream, no salsa! Reader Lemonjelly also tells me that The Cantina in I.V. is very popular with students. Reader Huyen says D&apos;Vine Cafe has a wonderful breakfast burrito..the veggie 
 one is great and you can add meat to kick it up a notch. Reader Brandon says that he biggest are definitely at the Mesa 
 Super Cucas and El Sitio on de la Vina location are 
 great. Smallish and a little overpriced, the breakfast burrito at Daily Grind is very tasty. Rose cafe &apos;s chorizo is killer, 
 though again, the burritos are a little small.

 Steak Patrol : Today I launch a special review page called the Steak Patrol that compares top steak 
 restaurants throughout Santa Barbara County. The guide includes a steak 
 tutorial and a meat map. I am proud to introduce steak expert and 
 talented writer Patrick Gilliland as the lead reviewer. Patrick 
 has an incredible depth of knowledge about the proper preparation and 
 serving of a good steak dinner. We have already visited 8 restaurants 
 since May. We review only the best places, and the ratings range from A- 
 to AAA+. The Steak Patrol page reviews only the Filet Mignon (to have a 
 common point of comparison) and the final rating does not put much 
 emphasis on the quality of side dishes or the service. Its all about 
 the beef.

 Holdren&apos;s 2.0 : The hugely popular Holdren&apos;s Steaks&amp;Seafood has opened their second 
 restaurant, this time at 1714A Newbury Rd, in Thousand Oaks 
 (805-498-1314). It is a beautiful place complete with Captain&apos;s wine 
 room and a replica of the bar in Santa Barbara they had custom made. I 
 ate at the new location last Friday night and took some pictures with 
 my cell phone (click here to see outside , inside ). Everything was 
 outstanding, from the delicious grilled shrimp cocktail and roasted red 
 pepper soup, to the absolutely perfect prime rib with garlic mash 
 potatoes. The place was packed and the cozy ambience of the Santa 
 Barbara location was artfully replicated. I had an enjoyable 
 conversation with the manager Blake and he told me that they have 
 received many inquiries from visiting patrons to have Holdren&apos;s open 
 additional locations, including Las Vegas, Palm Springs, San Diego and 
 San Francisco. No new locations are currently planned but they would 
 like to eventually have a fleet of 10 Holdren&apos;s restaurants throughout 
 the west.

 Thank You Fire Crew : Richard 
 Klingman at the Los 
 Olivos Grocery has started a fund to pay for food and various

 excellent pitch, and supple sense of time, Gazarek is steeped in the 
 jazz tradition, but is not afraid to embrace the music that moves her 
 generation. Call for reservations (805) 962-7776
 Remote Control : I wrote Monday&apos;s Al Steinman news 
 clip from my Treo 700wxi cell phone while driving on the 101 freeway to 
 a campground at Montana de Oro state beach. I sent the last-minute story 
 to the Santa Barbara Daily Sound (where I write a column every Tuesday) 
 as I was driving past the beautiful Shell Beach. A little while later, 
 from my tent at the campground, I used this glorious gadget to remotely 
 control my home desktop computer, with complete screen, mouse&amp;keyboard 
 access. With my&quot;virtual&quot;presence in Santa Barbara established, I 
 posted the same story to this online blog from my cell phone. I love 
 technology! I just got back (for real, not virtually) and have received 
 confirmation that Moby Dick&apos;s hugely-popular Al Steinman has indeed 
 retired. He will be missed.

 Counting Monte Cristo : Speaking of polls, last week reader 
 Danny inquired about places that serve a Monte Cristo sandwich. I put 
 the question into my blog and received several responses. Reader 
 Christine suggested the Bit O&apos; Denmark restaurant in Solvang. Reader Margie suggests Garrett&apos;s on 
 State St and Pea Soup 
 Andersens in Buellton. Reader Justine said that Garrett&apos;s 
 sandwich is different from the classic in that they put egg in it. 
 Justine also said that she saw the Monte Cristo sandwich on the menu at Beachbreak Cafe on lower State St. We&apos;ll consider this poll completed!
 Fiesta Wine Tasting : Elements Restaurant&amp;Bar is hosting their second-annual Old 
 Spanish Days wine tasting event at the the Santa Barbara Courthouse. 
 There will be hors doeuvres paired with wines from over 30 wineries. 
 The event occurs July 28th from 4pm-7pm. For more information, 
 contact 963-4408.
 Jazz Dinner 
 at SOhO : Nate Birkey, Wednesday, July 18th, 8:30pm. SOhO says:&quot;Nate Birkey&apos;s quiet but intense demeanor typifies an artist 
 restlessly pursuing the evolution of his own musical personality. As 
 composer, trumpeter and vocalist, he imbues warmth and broiling energy 
 into his music, as heard in his most recent CD release.&quot;Dinner 
 reservations ensure priority seating. Call for reservations (805) 
 962-7776 
 No News Is Good News : 
 I read in the Coastal View business notices section that the popular 
 Xanadu Bakery in Montecito was abandoning their name. I called them to 
 confirm and was told their was a&quot;legal mishap&quot;but that the problem was 
 resolved and their name will remain&quot;Xanadu Bakery.&quot;

 Attention Night Owls : Not 
 everybody has breakfast in the morning, lunch in the afternoon and 
 dinner in the early evening. Some people find themselves awake in the 
 middle of the night, hungry and no where to go. For those deprived souls 
 who feel like munching on a pre-dawn donut or perhaps an after-nightclub 
 snack at 2:30am, I have compiled a list of all the local fresh food 
 locations open 24-hours a day: Carrow&apos;s , Denny&apos;s - Goleta , Denny&apos;s - Santa 
 Barbara , Freebirds World Burrito , Jack in the Box - 
 Goleta , Jack 
 in the Box - Milpas , McDonald&apos;s - Fairview , Spudnuts - Downtown and Winchell&apos;s Donuts . 
 Note to students: Super Cuca&apos;s in Isla Vista is also open 24-hours on Fridays and 
 Saturdays.

 Where&apos;s Al? : I have heard from two people that Moby Dick&apos;s famous Al Steinman is no longer with the restaurant and that all 
 his Sinatra memorabilia and life size photo are gone. I called the 
 restaurant and they say he is on&quot;vacation.&quot;What&apos;s the scoop Santa 
 Barbara?

 Black&amp;Blue Ball : One of my duties as committee member and 
 webmaster for the Muscular Dystrophy Association &apos;s annual Black&amp;Blue Ball , is to help get the word out. Voted the Best Charity 
 Event by the Santa Barbara Independent Readers Poll, the Black&amp;Blue 
 Ball occurs on July 22nd at the Fess Parkers Doubletree Resort. With

 hours as the restaurant (Mon-Sun 11am-9pm). There is a live lobster tank 
 and plenty of local catch including thresher shark, halibut, sea bass&amp;red snapper. They also have seafood flown in from Japan including 
 hamachi (yellowtail), ahi tuna, flying fish roe and seaweed salads. The 
 Bay Cafs new Fish Market even has all the stuff you need to make your 
 own sushi including seaweed, rice, ginger, wasabi, rolling mats and a 
 wide selection of sake.

 French Festival : 
 The 20 th annual French Festival is the place you 
 should be this weekend (July 14&amp;15, 11am-7pm). Taking place at Santa 
 Barbaras Oak Park, it is the largest French celebration in the Western 
 United States and admission is free. Dozens of chefs prepare fine French 
 food ... everything from crpes to quiche, from caf au lait to decadent

 huge Eiffel Tower. Local eateries participating at the French Festival 
 include Le Bon Cafe and Pacific Crepes .

 New Ownership At Barcliff&amp;Bair : Shelley Shoemaker and David Bozzini are the new 
 owners of Barcliff&amp;Bair at 1112 State Street in La Arcada. I am told that they 
 bought the business when best-friends (and co-owners) of the restaurant, 
 Connie Barcliff and Alicia Bair, felt it was time for a change. 
 Shoemaker grew up in a&quot;hotel family&quot;that owned hotels where customer 
 service is everything. At Barcliff and Bair they invested in the menu, 
 updating it with daily specials, fresh lemonade, soups, salads, 
 sandwiches and now have extended afternoon hours on weekends. 
 Additionally, they now offer a champagne mimosa service that features 
 fresh strawberries, chocolate of the day, half or whole bottles of vueve 
 cliquot and a carafe of orange juice.

 Vons Boutique : Vons Market in 
 Montecito, first opened in 1968, will be undergoing a major remodel 
 beginning in 2008. It will be redesigned as a Vons Lifestyle Store in 
 the same fashion as Fairview Vons in Goleta, including upscale 
 amenities, new floors and big selection of organic produce. Look out Lazy Acres !
 Restaurant Of The Month : Baja Fresh in 
 Goleta is SantaBarbara.coms Restaurant of the Month for July. To say 
 that I am a frequent patron is an understatement. I order the same lunch 
 here nearly every day (2 Baja-style chicken tacos and a small drink). 
 Managers Patricia, Juan and Jose no longer ask for my order; they just 
 punch it into the register when I get to the front of the line. Heres a 
 tip: on Mondays, with your order of a meal, they give you a coupon for a 
 free taco ($2 value).

 Taco Tuesday : One of my

 Sound is doing the hard labor to find you good restaurant deals. Heres 
 one: New Baja Grill in Camino Real Marketplace offers Taco Tuesday from 4pm-9pm every 
 week. Tacos are 2 for 2.50 (chicken, steak, carnitas at half the normal 
 price), 2 for 2.99 beers (Pacifico) and 99 cent sodas. With thousands of

 Jamba Jamboree : If you would like to win a batch of smoothies 
 and have them delivered to your door, you might be interested in the new Jamba Juice contest running from July 6 to Aug 10. They have a web site JambaFruitfulLiving.com where you can enter the contest. 65 winners 
 will each receive a batch of 25 smoothies delivered to your home/office 
 and 15 winners will each each be awarded $500.
 Silver&amp;Gold : Two local 
 restaurants have reached truly amazing milestones. Downey&apos;s , 
 opened in 1982 by John&amp;Liz Downey, is celebrating its 25th anniversary 
 in business. Sambo&apos;s on the Beach is the original and only remaining site of the once great 
 restaurant chain founded in 1957 by Sam Battistone Sr. and Newell 
 Bohnett. Now in its 50th year, Sambos is currently owned and operated 
 by their grandson, Chad Stevens, founder of Chad&apos;s Restaurant on Chapala 
 St.
 Rumor Of The Day : I have been 
 told there is a rumor running wild in Summerland that Gene Montesano 
 (owner of Lucky&apos;s, Tre Lune, D&apos;Angelo&apos;s, Bucatini and Joe&apos;s Caf) may 
 buy the Summerland 
 Market and turn it into a high-end New York-style deli. The 
 Summerland Market closed earlier this year.
  
 Friday, June 29, 2007 

 Dining At The Miramar : The Miramar Hotel in Montecito has 
 been closed since 2000. The current owner, Rick Caruso, will soon tear 
 it down and completely rebuild a&quot;plantation&quot;themed resort, scheduled 
 for opening in 2009. That&apos;s a bit far off in the distance, but I thought 
 I would give you a sneak peek into their dining plans. The Montecito 
 Journal reports that the main building of the new Miramar Hotel will 
 house the lobby and the second floor will be the location of their 
 primary dining room. It will seat 120. Breakfast&amp;lunch will be served 
 there in a casual dining experience. At night time, however, it will 
 transform into an upscale dinner restaurant, complete with dim lights 
 and linens. Outside, by the pool, will be a second restaurant, covered 
 by a porch. It will seat 138. A third food option at the new&amp;improved 
 Miramar Hotel will be a snack bar at the beach. And, finally, they may 
 add a malt shop in another area for kids. I grew up next to this hotel 
 and spent my youth at the beach there, running from Jacques, the 
 Miramar&apos;s infamous lifeguard/security guard. We used to eat at the&quot;train&quot;that was parked on the property. I am glad to hear the beach 
 will have a real snack bar. It always needed one!
 New In The Guide : Today I took a 
 trip downtown and added Fresco Museum Cafe to the restaurant guide. Fresco, located inside the Santa Barbara Museum 
 of Art&apos;s gift shop at 1130 State Street, opened on May 26th. 
 Thursday, June 28, 2007 

 Food&amp;Fireworks : Hotel Andalucia&apos;s 31 West restaurant is offering a 4th of July dinner at their El Cielo rooftop 
 bar. Here is their official promotion:&quot;A Fabulous Fourth: Join us for 
 an extravagant rooftop celebration on Wednesday, July 4th in honor of 
 Independence Day. We&apos;re featuring a bountiful BBQ, festive cocktails, 
 and fabulous desserts...all followed by an unparalleled view of Santa 
 Barbara&apos;s fireworks. $60 per person. Reservation required. 
 5:30pm-9:30pm. 31 W. Carrillo Street. Call 805-879-9100&quot;

 Speaking of Fireworks : I have finally launched a 4th of 
 July information page . I have run this site for 11 years without any 
 mention of our proud country&apos;s Independence Day. There is a reason for 
 my neglect, however. I have lived in Santa Barbara my whole life, but, 
 since the day I was born, I have only experienced one 4th of July in 
 town. Our family has a tradition of spending the 4th of July every year 
 with friends in Newport Beach, CA on the Balboa Peninsula . If someone is interested in volunteering, I could seriously use some pictures of the parade and other 4th 
 festivities to add to SantaBarbara.com. I am never around to take any!

 Now Serving Lunch : The popular organic/vegetarian 
 restaurant Spiritland 
 Bistro (230 E. Victoria St) has expanded their menu and is now 
 serving lunch. The new lunch hours are Mon-Fri 11:30am-2pm. SB describes 
 their restaurant as serving&quot;raw, vegan, ethnic, wholesome, organic, 
 living cuisine&quot;

 Job Opening : Mondial Santa Barbara Inc. is looking for 
 experienced full-time catering kitchen staff, including nights and 
 weekends. Experience is a must. Please fax a resume to 805-884-0993 or 
 email to peter@mondialsantabarbara.com 
 Wednesday, June 27, 2007 

 Esau&apos;s Returning To Santa Barbara : I have received 
 confirmation from the Carpinteria Esau&apos;s that there is a 90% chance that Esau&apos;s Cafe , 
 which closed on State Street last year, is planning to reopen in Santa 
 Barbara. The address will be 721 Chapala Street, which is a mixed-use 
 (residential/commercial) building currently under construction, but 
 nearly completed. Esau&apos;s triumphant return to paradise is scheduled for 
 October or November.
 New Chef At Harbor 
 Restaurant : I have received a tip that David Cecchini , formerly the executive chef with Restaurant NU , 
 will be the new chef at the Harbor Restaurant , 
 starting sometime in July. 
 Monday, June 25, 2007 

 The New Joes Caf : Whats old is new. On July 1st, Santa 
 Barbarans will see something for the first time in decades: the 
 reincarnation of much of the original 1928-era Joe&apos;s Cafe . 
 The Montecito Journal reports that Joe&apos;s has been completely remodeled, 
 using a 1928 photo of Joe Ferario (with his bar in the 
 background) as the inspiration. Gene Montesano, who also operates Lucky&apos;s , Tre Lune , D&apos;Angelo&apos;s , Bucatini , 
 bought Joe&apos;s Cafe four years ago and is the driving force behind the 
 changes. The booths will have new leather cushions and are designed with 
 a tilted back to be more comfortable. The floor has been removed and 
 replaced with oak. The bar has been completely stripped down to natural 
 wood and includes brass foot rails and hooks for ladies purses. Even 
 the front doors are being updated to the original look. Though the kitchen has been completely remodeled, the most popular items on the 
 menu will remain the same. Owner Gene remarks&quot;I would like Joes to 
 have the best food on State Street, and not necessarily the most 
 expensive, but the best.&quot;The staff Santa Barbara has come to know and 
 love will all return, including long-time bar tender Frankie Calvillo (38 years of service) and Jim O&apos;Tool (39 years at Joe&apos;s). During 
 the first week of July expect an enormous party at Joe&apos;s Cafe. For the 
 festivities, burgers might be priced as they were in 1928. 
 Friday, June 22, 2007 

 Grinding To A Halt : Reader Rif tells me that the Coffee Grinder on Linden Avenue in Carpinteria has closed their doors. I tried calling 
 their phone number and it is disconnected and their web site is gone 
 too. For a small town, it is sad to see a popular local shop close. 
 Fortunately there are other java options nearby, including the Coffee Bean , 
 that opened last October.
 Terrific Tri-Tip : 
 My Tuesday column in the Santa Barbara Daily Sound contained my 
 secrets to barbecuing great tri-tip. Daily Sound reader Ray Gates , 
 who has been cooking tri-tip for over 50 years, passed me some tips 
 about handling the juices. Ray tells me that all meat must rest after 
 being cooked, except if it is a thin hamburger. Apparently, if the meat 
 is allowed to rest, the meat will be naturally juicy. For tri-tip Ray 
 suggests tenting the meat in foil for a good ten minutes before slicing.
 Wieners&amp;Wine : For the second year in a row Oreana Winery (205 Anacapa St) will rip the fancy facade off the world of wine and get 
 down to what really matters on hot July afternoons hot dogs, provided 
 by Lettuce B. Frank . 
 Winemaker Christian Garvin will be offering his newest releases 
 including Santa Barbara County Pinot Noir, Syrah, Sauvignon Blanc and 
 sparkling wine. Rock group Holden will perform on a flatbed truck which 
 serves as the impromptu stage. In addition to the food and wine, 
 Telegraph Brewery will be tapping some locally made ales and there are 
 also fun events for the kids. The event starts at 11:00 a.m. on Sunday 
 July 1, and runs until Sundown.
 John Scott&apos;s Secret Empire : Did you know that many of Santa 
 Barbara&apos;s popular restaurants are owned by one company? I discovered 
 this the other night while dining at the Tee-Off. Scottco Hospitality, 
 run by local restaurant guru John Scott, owns and operates the following 
 dining locations: El 
 Paseo Restaurant , Harbor Restaurant , Harry&apos;s Plaza Cafe , Kona Ranch House , Longboards Grill and the Tee-Off 
 Restaurant . Not to be content with being the restaurant king in 
 Santa Barbara, Scottco also owns the Scotch&amp;Sirloin in Ventura. 
 Thursday, June 21, 2007 

 More Sunset Magazine : Reader Zach Miller pointed out that 
 my June 18 news item about the top 10 seafood restaurants on the west 
 coast (as ranked by Sunset Magazine), failed to mention that the Shoals Restaurant , 
 also made the list. Congrats Shoals! Here is what Sunset had to say:&quot;Hidden inside the Cliff House Inn, north of Ventura, the Shoals serves 
 fine and fresh seafood: sea bass, shrimp, scallops, calamari, and clams, 
 bathed in delicious sauces. The restaurant fills up fast, so make 
 reservations. Just beyond the patio tables lies the surf break of Mussel 
 Shoals; from here on a summer night, you might see the dark forms of 
 dolphins gliding past, backlit by glittering moonlight.&quot;

 Sting&amp;The Boys : I went to The Police concert last night at Staples Center. It was packed. 
 Though my seats were in the clouds, it was still an excellent show. I 
 took pictures of the crowd and stage with my cell phone. Can 
 you guess which song they were playing when I took this shot ? Here is a YouTube video from their recent concert in Vancouver. Towards the end of the show I 
 scanned the crowd with my binoculars to see if I could recognize any 
 celebrities enjoying far better seats than my own. I spotted one: actor 
 Jake Gyllenhaal, standing front row left. 
 Wednesday, June 20, 2007 

 Visiting Chef&apos;s Dinner : The San Ysidro Ranch welcomes Luca Rutigliano from CordeValle , in 
 San Martin, CA, as a guest chef at the Stonehouse Restaurant on June 30th, 2007. Rutigliano will be 
 joining the ranch&apos;s regular chef, John Trotta in creating a series of 
 culinary delights, including amuse bouche, fresh herb crusted Ahi tuna 
 sashimi, crispy soft shell crab, polenta dusted filet of sea bream and 
 ranch herb roasted rack of lamb. $85 per person, $135 per person with 
 wine pairings.

 And Now For Something Completely Different : 
 In an effort to expand their test marketing, McDonald&apos;s has 
 announced that all Santa Barbara locations will be included in a test of 
 the new premium Angus beef burger . The burgers, available now in 
 local restaurants, are seen as a key way McDonald&apos;s is working to 
 compete with rivals Burger King, Hardee&apos;s and Carl&apos;s Jr., who have been 
 selling bigger, premium burgers for several years. The Santa Barbara 
 region is also included in a test of the new Southwest Salad . 
 Monday, June 18, 2007 

 Seafood At Sunset : The current issue 
 of Sunset Magazi ne honors the West Coast&apos;s&quot;top ten 
 seafood spots by the sea&quot;and the Endless Summer Bar-Cafe , 
 located at the Santa Barbara Harbor, is included on the elite list. 
 Sunset Magazine says:&quot;Epitomizing the town&apos;s casual surfer chic, this 
 harborside gem has surfboards hanging from the ceiling and surf videos 
 scrolling, reminders of the world&apos;s perfect waves. And, yes, Bruce 
 Brown, director of the original Endless Summer (1966), eats here. But 
 it&apos;s the food that stars: seafood fresh off the docks, transformed via 
 the lightest batter and seasonings into something mouthwatering. Try the 
 popcorn shrimp or the sesame-crusted ahi on a warm spinach salad.&quot;The 
 other nine honorees were from California, Oregon, Washington, Victoria 
 B.C. and Hawaii.

 Lettuce B. Frank Opens On State : Hot 
 dog, salad and chicken specialists Lettuce B. Frank opened for business today at 413 State Street. Readers who have been 
 following this column know that LBF is brought to you by the founders of 
 the DogHouse on Milpas St, that closed late last year. This time around, their East 
 Coast dogs, though still delicious as ever, are only part of the menu , which includes 
 salads, rotisserie chicken, sliders (mini burgers) and fish&amp;chips. I 
 stopped in and spoke with Vinny (one of the founders) and he told me 
 that everything is made fresh at LBF. They make chili fresh daily, 
 onions are sauted daily, they hand roll out beef daily, cheesesteaks 
 are sliced daily and the pulled pork is braised 3 or 4 times a week. 
 Everything that is fried is hand-dipped in house-made batter. Vinny 
 tells me that the french fries come from the highest quality Idaho 
 russet potatoes, and that they use zero trans-fat oils. Welcome back 
 guys!
 Top Chef Eliminated : As mentioned 
 in this column earlier this week, Clay Bowen , sous-chef at the 
 University Club of Santa Barbara (1332 Santa Barbara St), was selected 
 to compete on the Bravo channel&apos;s popular TV show&quot;Top Chef: Season 3.&quot;Thousands of chefs from all over the country applied for a chance to 
 compete on the show, taped in Miami Beach last February, and Bowen was 
 one of the elite few to be chosen. Unfortunately Mr. Bowen was 
 eliminated in the first round this week, with his wild boar chop with a 
 side of scorpion fish and corn bread. He still had a lot of fun and was 
 glad he did it. The new season of Top Chef can be seen on Wednesdays at 
 10pm on Bravo TV.

 I Said&quot;NO ANCHOVIES!!!&quot; : 
 More than pizza dough was flying at Rusty&apos;s Pizza on 
 Cabrillo Blvd last Tuesday evening. Lt. Paul McCaffrey of the Santa 
 Barbara Police Dept reports that&quot;chairs were thrown and knives were 
 drawn&quot;as gang members got out of control. No customers or employees 
 were injured. By the time the SBPD arrived, the gang members, who 
 momentarily turned the parlor into a real-life video game, had fled.

 New In The Guide : Today I added two dining locations to 
 the SantaBarbara.com Restaurant Guide. These places have been around for 
 quite awhile: Sandbar and Neighborhood . 
 I didnt add them sooner because it simply never occurred to me that 
 they offered food, in addition to being a bar. I was walking by both 
 last weekend and saw some very tasty lunches being served (see a picture of fish&amp;chips at Neighborhood), when the eternally dim light bulb floating above my 
 head finally lit up.

 Tech Brew : The El Paseo Restaurant will once again be hosting Tech Brew. What is Tech Brew?&quot;It is Santa 
 Barbara&apos;s regional premier networking event for high tech professionals, 
 cutting edge entrepreneurs, innovators, business managers&amp;leaders&quot;says founder Dennis Cagan. Date: Monday, June 25, Time: 5pm - 8pm, 
 Price: FREE, No Host Bar, Casual Business Attire, RSVP: 
 alan@smallbizentrepcntr.org, Info: (805) 879-1729

 State Street Stats : I was browsing 
 through the SantaBarbara.com restaurant database recently and pulled 
 together some statistics for you hungry number crunchers out there. On 
 State Street there are 144 dining locations consisting of: 
 American (31), Coffee (17), Mexican (15), Japanese (11), Italian (10), 
 Burger (7), Pizza (7), Smoothie (7), Ice Cream (5), Bakery (4), Chinese 
 (4), Indian (4), Steakhouse (4), Thai (3), Seafood (4), Brewery (2), 
 Donuts (2), Hot Dogs (2), Markets (2), Argentinean (1), Bagel (1), 
 Danish (1), French (1), Moroccan (1).
   The dining locations span 6 miles from Eladio&apos;s (1 
 State Street) to Eller&apos;s Donuts&amp;Thai Food (4317 State Street). With all the 
 recent talk about corporate caffeine invading State Street, no stats 
 would be complete without mention of our friendly java outlets. The 
 highest density of coffee shops (11) is between Starbucks at Cota and Starbucks at 
 Victoria where you can buy a Cuppa Joe approximately every 336 
 feet.
 Top Chef : Clay Bowen , 
 sous-chef at the University Club of Santa Barbara (1332 Santa 
 Barbara St), has been selected to compete on the Bravo channel&apos;s popular 
 TV show&quot;Top Chef: Season 3.&quot;Thousands of chefs from all over the 
 country applied for a chance to compete on the show, taped in Miami 
 Beach last February, and Bowen was one of the elite few to be chosen. 
 The new of season Top Chef premieres tonight at 10pm on Bravo.
 Local Breweries In LA Times : Reader Jonathon Schuhrke informs 
 me that there is an in-depth article in today&apos;s Los Angeles Times about the growth of 
 breweries in Santa Barbara County. 
 Tuesday, June 12, 2007 

 TV Dinners : Independent columnist Barney Brantingham reports 
 that Giada De Laurentiis, of the Food Network, was in town during 
 Memorial Day weekend. Apparently she dined at Bouchon , Brown Pelican , Elements , Trattoria Grappolo and even stopped to have dessert at McConnell&apos;s . Her 
 Santa Barbara visit will air on July 27th as part of the Food Network&apos;s&quot;Weekend Getaways&quot;program.
 Out&amp;In Burger : Tom Schultz of the Santa Barbara Newsroom 
 (santabarbaranewsroom.com) reports that a Goleta burger icon that went 
 out of business in October 2005, will soon be back in action. Restaurant owner John Price says he intends to renovate Storke Road Drive Inn (370 Storke Rd), in business under various 
 names since 1966. Price also plans to open the long-closed drive-in 
 window, a feature Santa Barbara County has rarely allowed since 1981. 
 Because the restaurant pre-dates county laws restricting drive-ins, it 
 will be allowed to proceed with that classic feature. Nearby McDonald&apos;s, 
 in Camino Real Marketplace, was denied a permit to activate their 
 drive-in window when it opened in 2000. Previous names for the 41 year 
 old diner include&quot;Aloha Restaurant&quot;and&quot;Dairy Delight.&quot; 
 Monday, June 11, 2007 

 Mama&apos;s Bakery : Reader Sam informs me that the Italian Bakery in Goleta is cooking up a new name. The new name 
 will be&quot;Mama&apos;s Bakery.&quot;Apparently the changeover has already occurred 
 - they just haven&apos;t put up a new sign yet. 
 Friday, June 8, 2007 

 10,000 Reviews And Counting : Reader Foodie Dan won a 
 SantaBarbara.com Restaurant Guide contest today that honored the person 
 who submits the milestone 10,000th restaurant review. The restaurant 
 guide was launched in 1996 and the review system was added in 2001. 
 Foodie Dan, who tells me he went to extraordinary effort to calculate 
 the exact moment to submit his review, won $600 in dining gift 
 certificates, a $400 pile-o-cash and a plaque commemorating the event. 
 I would like to thank all reviewers who have done such tremendous work 
 and displayed such creativity over the years. Perhaps the next prize 
 should be a Costco 
 Dog bonanza for everyone?
 Entertainment Nights : Bricks Cafe (509 State St, 899-8833) now offers nightly entertainment. Mondays: 
 music by Rooster Fish and Lady Blue 7:30pm-9:30pm. Tuesdays: music by 
 Martinez Bros&amp;Alberto Negroni 7:30pm-9:30pm. Wednesdays: Jazz night

 Thursday, June 7, 2007 

 Esau&apos;s Returning To Santa Barbara? : Reader Foodie Dan spotted 
 an application for a new business named&quot; Esau&apos;s Cafe &quot;to open at 
 721 Chapala Street in Santa Barbara. Esau&apos;s Cafe - State St closed last year while Esau&apos;s Cafe - Carpinteria is alive and well and was recently 
 voted Best Restaurant in Carpinteria.
 Spreading The Love : Having been 
 voted Best Pizza by the general public in SantaBarbara.com&apos;s 2007 
 restaurant poll, Pizza 
 Mizza (140 S. Hope Ave, 566-3900) is expanding their popular pie 
 empire to the south. Pizza Mizza now delivers to Summerland and 
 Carpinteria.
 Karaoke In Carp : 
 Starting June 13 and running until the end of summer, Giovanni&apos;s Pizza (5003 Carpinteria Ave, 684-8288) in Carpinteria is having Karaoke night 
 every Wednesday from 5:30pm-10pm. Hosted by Marty Rosales and Larry 
 Nimmer. 
 Tuesday, June 5, 2007 

 Bakeries Merged : The Italian 
 Bakery on Upper State Street in Loreto Plaza has closed its doors 
 and merged with its sister location in Goleta. The Italian 
 Bakery (5342 Hollister Ave, 692-1666) in Goleta will be the 
 combined bakery. 
 Monday, June 4, 2007 

 I.V.N.Y. : A new restaurant/deli specializing in wings opened 
 up in Isla Vista last week. New York Buffalo 
 Wings (910 Embarcadero Del Norte, 685-7010) offers five flavors 
 of chicken wings, wraps, subs and healthy salads. Restaurant owner Sam 
 is the same person who owned the previous business at that location, Jerusalem Garden Cafe , 
 which closed last month. I spoke with Sam (a very kind and business 
 savvy gentleman) at the I.V. Deli Mart around the corner (another business he owns), 
 and he told me that New York Buffalo Wings will also be serving an 
 American breakfast. Everything costs less than $10, which is par for the 
 course in student-mecca Isla Vista.

 Speaking Of Isla Vista : UCSB 
 students enjoyed another grand opening recently: Pho Bistro (903 Embarcadero Del Norte, 685-3610), which specializes in Vietnamese 
 cuisine, has opened its doors in Halloween Heaven. Check out their menu . Pho Bistro is 
 right next door to the regional caffeine E.R. known as IV Drip . 
 Friday, June 1, 2007 

 The Starbucks Diet : Starbucks Corp ., which has 13 
 locations on the South Coast, announced it will replace whole milk with 
 2 percent for espresso drinks in all of it&apos;s North American stores. 
 Drinks will soon be made by default with the lower-fat milk, but 
 customers can still request their cappuccino with whole milk, the 
 company said. Starbucks said that low-fat milk in drinks has become 
 increasingly popular in its stores.
 La Salsa Update : It was reported 
 here on May 23rd that Baja Fresh purchased the La Salsa chain. I have received confirmation that La Salsa (3987 
 State St), in Five Points Shopping Center, will be converted into a Baja Fresh restaurant. Due to the similarity of their menus, the 
 Baja-Salsa change-over should go smoothly, without any panic in the 
 streets. 
 Thursday, May 31, 2007 

 Sub Surfaces In Carpinteria : Reader Jonathon Schuhrke was 
 manning the crow&apos;s nest when he spotted Rincon Sub (1108 Casitas Pass Rd) in Casitas Plaza. This location was formerly 
 occupied by El Jirasol 
 Subs which recently had a burial at sea. Rincon Sub, which was 
 added to the guide today, is known for their&quot;Tri-Tip Monster Sub&quot;and&quot;Chile Verde Torta&quot;(Mexican sandwich). Owners Tommy&amp;Yolanda Moreno 
 tell me they are having an official grand opening (complete with ribbon 
 cutting) on Friday June 22nd. Festivities, which include live music and 
 prizes, continue that Saturday.
 Mollie&apos;s Meatballs : The Montecito Journal reports that Mollie 
 Ahlstrand, owner of Trattoria Mollie (1250 Coast Village Rd) in Montecito, and her 
 chef Eduardo Carranza were invited to Palm Beach, Florida to cook for 
 the All Star Celebrity Polo Challenge fundraiser. Mollie was honored 
 with the Star Diamond Award signed by notable chefs Alain Ducasse, 
 Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Le Cirque owner Sirio Maccioni. Mollie 
 spoke about the people who helped make it happen.&quot;I want to thank all 
 my loyal customers for their support,&quot;she says.&quot;My family and staff 
 are the best. And finally to Oprah , for making my turkey meatball 
 so well known.&quot;
 Solstice Fundraiser : Aldo&apos;s Italian 
 Restaurant (1031 State St) will donate 10% of food sales to the 
 Summer Solstice Parade fund, when you eat at Aldo&apos;s on Tuesdays during 
 June. 
 Wednesday, May 30, 2007 

 Barbecue Bandit : According to Santa Barbara police 
 spokesman Lt. McCaffrey, officers arrested Lynn Catalina Gutierrez, 22, 
 on suspicion of check forgery after she&quot;purchased&quot;a $140 barbecue meal 
 from the State Street Cafe (440 E. Ortega St). Fortunately the felonious feast was delivered by the 
 State Street Cafe to a residential address, making it relatively easy to 
 locate the culprit again, once the scam was discovered.
 Dinner At Esau&apos;s : Esau&apos;s Cafe , 
 recently voted Best Restaurant in Carpinteria, is known for serving a 
 terrific breakfast and lunch. They have now added dinner to their menu, 
 on Fridays&amp;Saturdays. Their new dinner hours are 5pm-8:30pm and the 
 menu continues their American food tradition, including meatloaf, prime 
 rib, garlic mash potatoes and more.

 Fresco Opening Downtown Location : I was strolling down State 
 Street past the Santa Barbara Museum of Art last Sunday night when I 
 decided to check my email with my Palm Treo 700. There, smiling at me 
 from my inbox, was a tip from reader Tony, telling me that a new 
 restaurant is opening up next to the Santa Barbara Museum of Art.
  I literally stopped dead in my tracks, turned my head to the left 
 and, sure enough, there was a big public notice plastered on a door ( see 
 photo ). The sign read Applicant: Brouillards, Inc. License: On-sale 
 Beer&amp;Wine Eating Place. Business name: Fresco Museum Caf . 
 Address: 1130 State Street.
  Like thousands of other people in town, I am a huge fan of Fresco 
 (I recently ate at Fresco uptown and Fresco at the Beach , 
 on the same day). Fresco Museum Cafe has the potential to turn a 
 relatively sleepy block of State Street into the next dining hotspot. In 
 the tradition of Star Wars (which first hit theaters 30 years ago this 
 week), I just might get my sleeping bag and start camping out so I can 
 be first in line!
 Here&apos;s Looking At You, Kid : Reader 
 Tony informs me that, after 10 years of faithful service in downtown 
 Santa Barbara, Bogart&apos;s Cafe has closed its doors in the La Arcada shopping mall. Apparently it will 
 be replaced by a business (possibly a restaurant) named Petite 
 Valentien . I dont have any more details than what could be gleaned 
 from papered over windows and the sign telling the name of the new place&quot;coming soon.&quot;
 When SantaBarbara.com launched in 1996, its first office was upstairs in 
 La Arcada and, at that time, Bogarts Cafe was a video rental store 
 named Bogarts. They also had great coffee and great food that I 
 frequented regularly. By the time I left La Arcada, Bogarts had 
 transformed into one of Santa Barbaras most popular cafes. 
 Garden Of Eat&apos;n : The Garden Market on Santa Claus Lane near Carpinteria has expanded its menu and hours in 
 addition to opening a new wine bar. They are now offering early dinners 
 on Fridays and Saturdays until 7pm that includes specially prepared 
 tapas. On Saturdays they will also be featuring entertainment by local 
 musicians. In March the Garden Market added a wine bar. The public is 
 encouraged to sample new wines and can also setup private wine tastings. 
 Friday, May 25, 2007 

 Italian Street Painting Festival : Starting today, and continuing throughout Memorial 
 Day weekend, the plaza of the Old Mission will be 
 transformed with 200 colorful, large-scale street paintings created by 
 400 artists and young people. The artists (madonnari) begin working on 
 Saturday morning of the Memorial Day weekend and continue drawing 
 throughout the three-day festival or until their street paintings are 
 completed. For 25,000 annual visitors, the festival also features live 
 music on the Mission lawn and free evening concerts in the church, authentic Italian cuisine , and a special street painting area for 
 children. 

 Santa Barbara Wine Festival : The 20th Annual Santa Barbara 
 Wine Festival will be held Saturday, June 30, 2007 from 2:00-5:00PM 
 at the Santa Barbara Natural History Museum, located at 2559 Puesta del 
 Sol Road in Mission Canyon, just beyond the Old Mission. The festival 
 features more than 50 of the best Central Coast wineries, complemented with local restaurants and caterers in a spectacular 
 setting along the beautiful, oak-shaded Mission Creek. In addition, 
 savvy experts present on topics such as cooking with Central Coast wines 
 and pairing wine with food.
 Get Paid To Eat : Now that&apos;s MY kind 
 of job! Craig Smith , creator of the popular Craig Smith&apos;s Blog is reporting today that the Santa Barbara 
 News-Press has a freelance job opening for a restaurant critic . 
 The ideal candidate will have&quot;journalism experience and a food or 
 restaurant background.&quot;One article will be published each week, for 
 $125, which includes dining expenses. Respond to Keri Bradford, Arts&amp;Entertainment Editor, at kbradford@newspress.com . 
 Good Deed Of The Day : This week, El Torito (29 
 E. Cabrillo Blvd) provided meeting space and free delicious hors 
 d&apos;oeuvres for the Black&amp;Blue Ball committee (I&apos;m a member) 
 which puts on an annual fundraiser for the Muscular Dystrophy 
 Association. Whenever I see a restaurant go out of their way for 
 charity, expect a nice plug here! You will soon see a lot of plugs on 
 this site for the Black&amp;Blue Ball charity event, which occurs July 22, 
 2007 at the DoubleTree.

 Baja Fresh To Buy La Salsa : This 
 information has not even made the papers yet, or the web for that matter 
 (until now). I received an insider tip that the two Mexican food empires 
 are planning to combine. It is not clear to me what the direct result of 
 that will be. There are two local Baja Fresh locations: Baja Fresh - Goleta and Baja Fresh - Upper 
 State . Perhaps La Salsa - Five Points Center will become a Baja 
 Fresh? Your guess is as good as mine. I did notice that Baja 
 Fresh recently started serving mango salsa, which, until now, was only 
 available at La Salsa. That should have been my first clue of the 
 pending merger! 
 Monday, May 21, 2007 

 Restaurant Marcella Update : 
 Apparently Fess Parker did not buy Wine Cask - Los Olivos as reported here earlier. Wine Cask was a tenant in Mr. Parker&apos;s hotel 
 in Los Olivos and he did not renew their lease. He will be opening his 
 own dining location, called Restaurant Marcella , in its place. 

 Stellar Experience : 
 Last Saturday night, a rare celestial event occurred when two bright 
 lights in the night sky (Venus and the moon) came together, within 1 arc 
 of each other ( see my photo ). 
 Things also came together in spectacular fashion that night at the Hollister Brewing 
 Company . I wanted to 
 try out their new Hollister Burger and, when I arrived, I encountered a packed house ( see 
 photo ) of locals entertaining a similar idea.
  While I was waiting to dine, I counted 84 people inside, 26 people 
 on the patio and 12 people in line. Much to my surprise, the first thing 
 I noticed was families with small kids having dinner at Hollister. I 
 expected the place to be full of drunk UCSB students, but this was 
 definitely not the case. Hollister has a good mix of singles and 
 families, and, that night, ages ranged from 3 to 65. I noted that about 
 20% of the customers were college age.
 As promised by the hostess, I was sitting at a table within 15 minutes. 
 Service was also good, considering the galaxy of customers in the 
 building and I was munching on my burger 16 minutes after ordering. 
 Though I ordered a medium burger and it arrived well-done, it was still 
 very delicious. The bread they use is soft and delicate and does not 
 overwhelm the beef. The service was great and the whole operation seemed 
 to be running smoothly even though the place was busting at the seams 
 with customers.
 The owner, Larry Kreider, who also founded the Santa Barbara Brewing 
 Company, told me that the mix of people (age range, families, singles) 
 that have come to dine at Hollister is exactly what they had hoped for. 
 And they have already had to brew new beer 17 times since opening, to 
 keep up with demand. Unlike many brewing companies, the locally owned 
 and operated Hollister Brewing Company creates their beer onsite.
  Larry gave me a tour of the brewery ( see 
 photo ) and explained to me how the whole brewing process works. What 
 was especially amazing to me was the fact that the taps at the dining 
 room bar are connected directly to the brewery ( see 
 photo ). Basically you&apos;ve got water, malt, hops and yeast brewing at 
 one end of the room and refrigerated taps filling beer mugs at the 
 other.
  The Hollister Brewing Company is a well-thought-out and 
 well-executed operation that is a welcome and valuable addition to 
 Goleta. The stars have shined on The Good Land. 

The Name Game : This is the fifth column in a series 
 about food locations in far away cities that have been given names that 
 you will find very familiar. When visiting New York City, I recommend 
 you see the Empire State Building, the Statue of Liberty and Times 
 Square. And, if you happen to be on 12th St, don&apos;t forget to stop by Santa Barbara Deli Superette (551 E 12th St, NY, NY) and stock up on 
 groceries. If for some reason they don&apos;t have just what you are looking 
 for, you can always head over to Santa Barbara Deli Grocery (2499 
 Boston Rd, Bronx, NY) which has a dependable selection of food 
 essentials. Tell them John sent you! 
 Friday, May 18, 2007 

 Joe&apos;s Closed : I was walking on State St last night went I 
 felt that something was amiss. I realized there wasn&apos;t the usual hustle&amp;bustle going on in front of Joe&apos;s Cafe (536 
 State St). It was closed! I quickly walked over to check out what was 
 going on. My fears that Joe&apos;s had been replaced by yet another cell 
 phone outlet were quickly displaced as I read, with great relief, a sign that said&quot;closed for 
 remodeling.&quot; I called their answering machine and the voice mail 
 says they are reopening July 1st, 2007.
 New Restaurant On De La Guerra? : 
 Speaking of reading signs, I spotted an official-looking notice posted 
 on a building on De La Guerra St (west of Paseo Nuevo Mall). It appears 
 a new restaurant (or perhaps a bar) named Saffron will be opening 
 in that location. The sign says&quot;Public notice of application to sell 
 alcoholic beverages. Type of license: on-sale beer&amp;wine, eating place. 
 Name: Saffron, 113 W. De La Guerra St.&quot;The sign was dated March 19, 
 2007. Glancing in the window, I could tell the remodeling of that 
 location had not yet begun, so it will probably be a few months before 
 they open.

 Rodney&apos;s Tops in 2007 Zagat Survey : Rodney&apos;s Steakhouse (633 E. Cabrillo Blvd) at Fess Parker&apos;s Doubletree Resort, has been 
 awarded high ratings from the Zagat Survey that separately rates the 
 qualities of a restaurant (Food, Decor, Service) based on a 30-point 
 scale. Rodney&apos;s ratings of 27-Food, 24-Dcor and 23-Service; mark it as 
 one of the top restaurants in Santa Barbara.
  The recently released ratings report says :A&quot;find&quot;in Santa 
 Barbara, this&quot;surprisingly good&quot;steakhouse in Fess Parker&apos;s Doubletree 
 Resort delivers&quot;fantastic&quot;steaks,&quot;delicious&quot;desserts, and an&quot;extensive menu of drinks&quot;; a&quot;carefully overseen&quot;staff shows that it&quot;cares&quot;about its customers in the&quot;well lit&quot;art deco setting. 
 Wednesday, May 16, 2007 

 Jake&apos;s Does Breakfast : Reader Dianne passed me a tip that Jake&apos;s Cottage 
 Cuisine Cafe (2911 De La Vina St) is now open . I spoke with 
 Jake and he was a very nice guy with a lot of restaurant experience. 
 While I was there he personally met with each of his customers to be 
 sure everything was just right.
  The main focus of Jakes is serving breakfast, including omelets 
 and quiche. They are serving breakfast and lunch seven days a week, 
 7am-3pm, in addition to espresso drinks and fresh baked goods provided 
 by Anna&apos;s Bakery. The original plan was to be closed Mondays but the 
 positive response from the public will keep Mondays open too. On 
 Sundays, Jake&apos;s will have a buffet.
  Here&apos;s a secret (shhhhh...): when ordering your meal, add the words A-Plenty  (for example,&quot;scrambled eggs-a-plenty&quot;) and Jake&apos;s 
 will greatly increase the size of the meal, at no extra cost . For 
 more information, check out Jake&apos;s menu: side 1 , side 2 .
 Brewmaster Dinners and Tequila Dinner : 
 New Belgium Brewing Company and their popular Fat Tire Amber Ale takes 
 center stage at Zaffiro Restaurant in Goleta in June. Chef Amy McNelis will team up with Fat 
 Tire to create a special four-course menu, pairing her foods with the 
 popular New Belgium brew on June 21, 2007 , beginning at 7:00 pm. 
 Our previous three monthly Brewmaster dinners have been sell-outs, 
 explained McNelis. Im excited to work with the New Belgium Brewing 
 Company for our next special event.
  On July 19, 2007 , David Walker from Firestone Walker Brewing 
 Company is the featured guest at Zaffiro, pairing the local Firestone 
 brew with Zaffiros four-course menu.
  In celebration of Santa Barbaras traditional Fiesta , Zaffiro 
 welcomes Patron Tequila to the Goleta restaurant for a special dinner on August 1, 2007 . Many dishes can be created with a tequila 
 influence, explained McNelis. It will be fun matching flavors with 
 Patron. Reservations are required for the specialty dinners by calling 
 the restaurant at 805-968-6201. The cost is $34.95 per person, not 
 including tax and gratuity.

 Fess Parker Opening Restaurant Marcella : Reader Alan let me know that changes were happening in the Santa Ynez 
 Valley at Wine Cask - 
 Los Olivos . Fess Parker did not renew the lease for Wine Cask - 
 Los Olivos and will be opening his own restaurant named Restaurant 
 Marcella. Right now they are in the process of updating the decor and 
 menu. 

 As If You Care : I celebrated my 
 birthday over the weekend by BBQing tri-tip for 80 people in my 
 backyard. I have discovered an amazing sauce for tri-tip that 
 everyone was raving about. Just before you cook the tri-tip, rub in some &quot;Suzie Q&apos;s Santa Maria Seasoning&quot; (available at Costco). This 
 seasoning consists of salt, pepper, garlic, parsley and sugar. 
 Generously rub the powder into both sides. Cook the tri-tip medium-rare 
 to medium, on a BBQ, on low flame, for about an hour.
  Be sure to use a professional high-quality knife (and not that beat 
 up old knife sitting in your drawer). Sharpen just before use and cut 
 the meat cross-grain, in the thinnest slices you can possibly achieve 
 (thin slices are only possible with a good knife). Cross-grain cutting 
 makes the meat much more tender to chew. Chop the whole tri-tip in half 
 (with the grain) before slicing so each piece is smaller. As you 
 chop it up, save the juices and pour them back on top of the meat in the 
 serving tray.
  I have found that really large tri-tips are hard to cook all the 
 way through, and don&apos;t taste as good. Costco seems to get this right 
 too. Their tri-tips are just the right size and have all the fat 
 removed. When someone asks you how you made this amazing meal, tell them 
 it&apos;s your Uncle John&apos;s secret recipe .

 will be open until midnight. It will be the only dessert bar in the area 
 where you can go after dinner or late at night and get some dessert, 
 coffee, espresso, after dinner drinks etc. Speaking of Zaffiro, they 
 will also be starting a brunch at the end of this month or beginning of 
 June. Details coming soon!
 Four Restaurant Owners Join The Guide : The 
 owners of Szechuan 
 Restaurant , Whale Tail Deli , Barcliff&amp;Bair and Quantum Kitchen&amp;Cocktails contacted me and have opened control 
 panel accounts. Control panel accounts in the SantaBarbara.com 
 Restaurant Guide, which are free of charge, allow owners to post 
 responses to public reviews written about their restaurant. They can 
 also enter extended descriptions of their restaurant and information 
 about specials, hours, web site, menus, etc. The total number of 
 restaurant owners that have joined the guide stands at 90. Welcome 
 aboard!

 Hollister Brewing Co. Opens In Goleta : Camino Real 
 Marketplace just got a little bit happier. Hollister Brewing 
 Company opened today, next to Borders, in the former location of 
 now-closed Camino Real 
 Cafe . Hours are 7 days a week, 11am-11pm. I spoke with the 
 manager Larry and he gave me the inside scoop. Unlike many brewing 
 companies that dont actually make beer onsite, Hollister has five large 
 fermenters and six serving tanks that will brew about a dozen different 
 types of beer right on the premises. But its not all about the beer. 
 Hollister Brewing Co. also wants to be known for great food. Larry 
 really emphasized to me how they are going to great lengths to build a 
 reputation for serving fresh, high quality meals. Their menu offers 
 appetizers, paninis, pizza, soups, salads, a variety of sandwiches and 
 local wines by the glass or bottle. I hereby officially predict that 
 their Hollister Burger (hand ground&amp;formed Masami Kobi beef, 
 cooked to order) will become the burger-lover&apos;s talk of the town.
 Downtown Brewing Co. Opens On Upper State : 
 Reader Tony let me know that yesterday another brewing company opened to 
 the public. The Downtown Brewing Company , which has locations in San Luis Obispo 
 and Paso Robles, has food, pool, lots of TV&apos;s and, of course, plenty of 
 brew. Their brewmaster, Steve Courier, has won several awards in 
 connection with his work at the SLO Brew location and is nationally 
 recognized for his brewing skills. Their beer list includes Lager, Honey 
 Blonde Ale, Pale Ale, Amber Ale, India Pale Ale, Wheat, Blueberry Ale, 
 Double Blonde, Irish Stout, Oatmeal Stout, ESB and Hemp Ale. In case you 
 are wondering why an uptown Santa Barbara brewco would name themselves&quot;Downtown,&quot;it is because their flagship brewery is located in&quot;downtown&quot;San Luis Obispo.

 They Should Just Call It&quot;Water&quot; : 
 Here is a tip for those of you, who, like myself, enjoy caffeine-free 
 diet colas. I used to think it was impossible to find a restaurant that 
 serves caffeine-free Diet Coke on tap in Santa Barbara. Every place sells Sprite, lemonade, etc, but a 
 caffeine-free diet coke? No chance. Starting this week, however, Baja Fresh - 
 Goleta and Baja Fresh - Santa 
 Barbara switched from Pepsi to Coke and now offer caffeine-free Diet Coke, on tap. I 
 believe they are the only place in town that offers this.

 Brewmaster Dinner : Amy McNelis, Chef of Zaffiro Restaurant in Goleta is teaming up with Brian Thompson, Brewmaster of 
 Santa Barbaras Telegraph Brewing Company for another special evening of 
 fine Italian cuisine being paired with award-winning microbrews. The May 
 9 event at Zaffiro will be the third in a series of Brewmaster Dinners 
 that have been sellouts for the Italian eatery located in the Camino 
 Real Marketplace in Goleta. Brewmaster Dinners at Zaffiro are $34.95 per 
 person, not including tax and gratuity. Seating is limited and advanced 
 reservations are required by calling 805-968-6201.

 Epiphany Opening New Wine Bar : 
 Celebrating six years in business on June 12, Epiphany is now 
 in the construction phase of opening a new wine bar in Montecito that is 
 currently scheduled to debut this July. It will be called Sesto Senso wine and carpaccio bar. (www.sestosensoca.com) They will feature a large 
 selection of wine by the glass (focus is local, California and some 
 imports) and their carpaccio bar will feature carpaccio&apos;s, charcutterie, 
 artisinal cheese, caviar, shellfish, light appetizers and then homemade 
 chocolates for dessert.

 Good Deed Of The Day : Last week Restaurant Nu provided meeting space and free delicious hors d&apos;oeuvres for the Black&amp;Blue Ball committee (I&apos;m a member) which puts on an annual fundraiser 
 for the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Whenever I see a restaurant go 
 out of their way for charity, expect a nice plug here!

 Happy Holidays : Last week 
 SantaBarbara.com had our Christmas party , which we have each year 
 at the Palace Grill . Christmas party in April? Let me explain. 
 Last Christmas my holiday plans were thrown out the window when, 
 starting December 12th, I ended up playing Santa Claus to kids who were 
 dialing my phone number by mistake. Somehow the story ended up on national news . With the 
 ensuing media circus and my phone ringing off the hook, I dropped 
 everything for two weeks, including our Christmas party. Shari Falter, 
 who wrote much of the content on SantaBarbara.com, happened to be in 
 town last week so I gathered up my friends and finally threw our annual 
 Christmas bash. The Palace Grill staff kindly played right along with it 
 and owners Michael and Sandy DeRousse even came over and had a nice chat 
 with us. Much to our surprise, they brought out an artwork made out 
 of chocolate as our dessert, created by their talented in-house 
 chocolate artist Sheryl . Below is a picture of this 
 mocha-masterpiece, complete with chocolate Mission, sailboats&amp;Stearns 
 Wharf. I highly recommend the Palace Grill for all festive occasions.

 Grand Re-Opening : The Bay Cafe reopens 
 to the public on today. After closing last year, the restaurant has new 
 ownership, new management and new energy to welcome Santa Barbara back! In addition to the restaurant, they are opening a wine bar inside the 
 main building. Just outside the main building, in June, they are 
 planning to open a new fresh fish market and gourmet store.
 Ocean Views : Today I launch a new Ocean Views page that is designed to help tourists find a restaurant 
 to dine at while enjoying great ocean views. For each restaurant listed 
 on the page, I have included an aerial photo, an exterior photo and an 
 interior/close-up shot. This new listing replaces the&quot;By The Beach&quot;page which has been retired. 
 Friday, April 27, 2007 

 The Cat Comes Home : Reader 
 Jonathan alerted me to the arrival of The Hungry Cat , 
 a new restaurant that just opened at 1134 Chapala St, which used to be 
 the home of the now-closed L&apos;ombretta . From 
 looking at their web site, it appears they have another location in 
 Hollywood and offer a lot of seafood options in the $15-$25 range. 
 Welcome to Santa Barbara Hungry Cat! 
 Thursday, April 26, 2007 

 McBrophy&apos;s : I just found out that a rumor about Brophy&apos;s 
 becoming a McDonald&apos;s has been spreading around town like wildfire. I 
 am to blame for this one. On April 1st, I added an April Fools 
 joke to this column, detailing how Brophy Bros. will be replaced by&quot;McDonald&apos;s at the Harbor&quot;that will have&quot;the best 
 view of any McDonald&apos;s in the country&quot;and will be using&quot;local catch 
 for their filet-o-fish.&quot;Just below that fish story was an April 
 Fools disclaimer, that apparently nobody read. D&apos;Oh!!! 
 Tuesday, April 24, 2007 

 Extra! Extra! : Starting today, this column will also appear 
 in print in the Santa Barbara Daily Sound , a daily newspaper that 
 specializes in comprehensive local news. The column will appear every 
 Tuesday. You can also read the Santa Barbara Daily Sound on the web at www.dailysoundonline.com 
 My Mi-steak : It turns out the 
 information I received previously about Ruth&apos;s Chris Steakhouse coming to downtown Santa Barbara was incorrect. Ruth&apos;s Chris will be 
 opening in La Cumbre Plaza. The eatery will be replacing the woman&apos;s 
 clothing store&quot;Express&quot;- near the middle of La Cumbre Plaza. The 
 official address will be 3815 State St. I called La Cumbre Plaza 
 corporate headquarters and they said Ruth&apos;s Chris will be opening 
 mid-November 2007.
 Speaking Of La Cumbre 
 Plaza : Another eatery coming soon to our friendly uptown 
 shopping mall is Marmalade Cafe . This is an upscale dining chain that has quality 
 food and a very rustic and home-like decor. It is replacing the 
 now-closed Red Robin . 
 I called La Cumbre Plaza corporate headquarters (and Marmalade Cafe 
 corporate headquarters) and was told that it should open late 
 October/early November 2007. The official address will be 3825 State St.
 Low Down on Downtown : I spoke with the manager at the Downtown Brewing Company that will be opening soon at 3744 State St, 
 which used to be the location of the Sandman Bar&amp;Grill . 
 They will be having a&quot;soft&quot;opening next week and an official opening 
 during early May. The original March opening was held up because of 
 typical red tape (inspections, license delays, etc). He said they have 
 had 20-30 people per day stopping by, asking when they are opening. All 
 the signs are indicating a pent up demand for a quality brewco on upper 
 State St. The Downtown Brewing Company may be on to something BIG. In 
 case you are wondering why an uptown brewco would name themselves&quot;Downtown,&quot;it is because their flagship brewery is located in&quot;downtown&quot;San Luis Obispo. 
 Monday, April 23, 2007 

 Easy Come, Easy Go : Reader Emily 
 tells me that Cuzcatlan Salvadorian 
 Cuisine at 2911 De La Vina St, has closed its doors for good. In 
 its place will be Jakes Cottage Cuisine Caf that is scheduled 
 to open May 1st. I dropped by and had a nice conversation with Jake 
 himself, who also is the new owner of the building. He told me that he 
 used to own a couple of restaurants on the East coast and now is going 
 to give Santa Barbara a try. The main focus of Jakes will be serving 
 breakfast, including omelets and quiche. The restaurant will be divided 
 into 3 sections. The left side will be an express bar for pastries, 
 donuts, croissants, bagels and take-out coffee. The right side will be 
 the dining room where they will serve breakfast (followed by lunch) from 
 6:30am-3pm Tue-Sun. In the back will be a private room that the public 
 can use for meetings.
 Coming Soon : 
 This is a follow-up to my February 12th blurb about The Melting Pot Restaurant coming to Santa Barbara. I called them today and they said 
 that they are definitely coming to Santa Barbara in 2007 but do not yet 
 have a location picked out. 
 Saturday, April 21, 2007 

 Helping Out : I went to a fundraiser last night for Unity 
 Shoppe and noticed some local restaurants donating for the cause. Restaurant Nu , Blue Agave and Bougainvillea spent the entire evening dishing out freshly prepared (and donated) food 
 to the guests. All seafood at the event was donated by the Harbor 
 Meat&amp;Seafood Company . 
 Friday, April 20, 2007 

 New In The Guide : Today I added 
 the Plow&amp;Angel to this restaurant guide, under&quot;Californian&quot;cuisine category. The Plow&amp;Angel, closed for over two years for remodeling and reconstruction 
 after a fire, is located at the San Ysidro Ranch in Montecito. I will 
 swing by this weekend and take some photos. 
 Thursday, April 19, 2007 

 Return of Hibachi? : Observant reader Foodie Dan tells me 
 that he has noticed two fictitious business name 
 statements for a Hibachi restaurant at the address 415 Milpas St. This 
 is the same address where a Hibachi restaurant used to be located and 
 has since closed. 
 Saturday, April 14, 2007 

 Gone But Not Forgotten : The Italian&amp;Greek Market at 636 State St closed today. Always at the top of their game, Italian&amp;Greek Market leaves Santa Barbara a winner. They won the most votes in 
 two categories of this guide&apos;s 2007 Santa Barbara Survey: Best Deli and Best Greek Restaurant . I will still send the owner, Johnny, his 
 award poster. Speaking of Johnny, he emailed me a message today to be 
 relayed to all of you:

 John,

Johnny from the Italian and Greek deli. Please update your report that 
 we did not sell our building, but leased it out to Verizon. Please thank 
 everyone for us. Santa Barbara has truly blessed my family.

Thank you, Johnny 

 We Deliver : Yesterday I was out 
 of the office all day. The weather was so nice, it was the perfect time 
 to deliver the award posters for the first-annual Santa 
 Barbara Survey . I drove to over 30 restaurants yesterday and still 
 have a couple dozen deliveries to go. Here is a sneak peek at 
 this year&apos;s poster: 
 Tuesday, April 10, 2007 

 New Owner : The Wine Cask Restaurant has been sold. I am told that the new owners will be bringing new energy 
 and investment into the business and will expand the already-large wine 
 selection. 
 Monday, April 9, 2007 

 Closing Soon : The Italian&amp;Greek Market at 636 State St is closing in a few days on April 14. The family that 
 has owned it for decades, has leased the building to a new tenant: a 
 Verizon Super Store. The owners have already opened up Trattoria Vittoria on Victoria St, so their spirit and talent lives on!

 Moving Soon : Mel&apos;s , a 
 downtown bar since 1963, is moving. It has been at its current location 
 for decades but the rent at its Paseo Nuevo Mall location was recently 
 doubled. The sad part is that Mel&apos;s didn&apos;t ask to be part of the mall. 
 It was comfortable at its De La Guerra St location when the powers that 
 be decided to build Paseo Nuevo Mall around it. Rumor has it that it 
 will be moving to the former location of Zeno Manue at 411 
 State St. There are two doors at that location. One door will lead to Lettuce Be Frank , the coming-soon reincarnation of the now closed DogHouse . The 
 other door will take you to Mel&apos;s.
 Remodeling : I spoke with a 
 manager at 31 West , 
 the restaurant located inside Hotel Andalucia on Carrillo St. They are 
 planning a major remodel. There has been an ongoing problem with the 
 current design because the hotel lobby seating area was merged with the 
 restaurant, creating noise issues, among other things. The current lobby 
 seating area will become part of the restaurant. They are planning on 
 removing one of the large pillars between the restaurant and lobby and 
 moving the bar there. Open archways between the current lobby seating 
 area and the hotel entrance/staircase, will be filled in, further 
 separating the restaurant from hotel. 
 Friday, April 6, 2007 

 Beefing Up Holdren&apos;s : The hugely 
 popular Holdren&apos;s 
 Steak&amp;Seafood has opened their second restaurant, this time at 
 1714A Newbury Rd, in Thousand Oaks (805-498-1314). It is in the new 
 development with the two new Marriot hotels. They opened last night with 
 a soft opening for the regulars from SB and some friends of the 
 restaurant. Everything went really well, I am told. It is the same menu 
 as SB along with the wines and spirits. I am told it is a beautiful 
 place complete with Captain&apos;s wine room and a replica of the bar in SB 
 they had custom made. It has the same feel, food, and service as their 
 SB location and they are officially opening to the community tonight. 
 Tuesday, April 3, 2007 

 BrewMaster Dinner : For two nights Zaffiro will

 Dates: April 11,&amp;May 9, 2007 --- both starting at 7:00 P.M. Each night

 purchased beforehand and are $34.95 plus tax and gratuity per person, 
 all inclusive. Any questions, please call Zaffiro at 968.6201 and ask 
 for any available manager. 
 Monday, April 2, 2007 

 10,000th Review : The total review count currently stands at 
 about 9,200. Today I posted information about a prize to the person who writes the 10,000th review ($600 in dining gift 
 certificates). Of interested on that page is some trivia about the restaurant guide, including:
 Who wrote review #1? Shari Falter on November 19, 2001 Who wrote the most reviews?  John 
 Dickson 90, LemonJelly 53, Hajir Sailors 40, JB 34, Chee 25 Who has emailed the most 
 information tips to the restaurant guide? Steve Weixel Who is the most photographed person in the guide?  Sarah Latta W ho was the first&quot;Restaurant of 
 the Month?&quot; Beachbreak Cafe , 
 October 2004 What was the first restaurant 
 added to the guide? Moby Dick Restaurant , 
 February 25, 1996 When did the restaurant guide 
 first go online? March 4, 1996 

 Grand Opening : Introducing Greek House Cafe at 5 W. Haley St, which opened on March 19th. In addition to their 
 cafe, Greek House Cafe offers&quot;Greek To Go,&quot;&quot;Take Home Greek&quot;and 
 imported Greek grocery items. 
 Friday, March 30, 2007 

 Closing Soon : Restaurant NU has announced that they are closing their doors on May 28th, 2007. The 
 owner of the property at 1129 State St has decided to reconstruct it and 
 asked all tenants to leave by the end of May. They were notified just a 
 few days ago by their landlord and they are hoping to find a new 
 location, but don&apos;t expect to be able to with such short notice. 

 Squash That Rumor : 
 A rumor is going around that Piranha 
 Restaurant&amp;Sushi Bar on State Street will be 
 closing. i am in that restaurant right now as I type this from my Treo 
 700. I asked the chef and the manager and they both said that the rumor 
 is false and they are NOT closing. With that settled, I think I will 
 order a Manzano roll. 
 Thursday, March 29, 2007 

 Opening Soon : The Bay Cafe is planning to re-open in mid-April. New owners and new management are 
 doing great new things to this location. In addition to the restaurant, 
 they are opening a wine bar inside the main building. Just outside the 
 main building, in June, they are planning to open a new fresh fish 
 market and gourmet store. They had a one-day pre-opening party 
 recently, which is why the rumor was going around that they had 
 re-opened. They will soon!

 Opening Soon : The Greek House 
 Cafe is opening soon at 5 W. Haley St, just west of State St. I 
 stopped by yesterday and they were still painting the interior.
 Opening Delayed : Reader Darryl tells me that the March 
 31st opening of the Downtown Brewing Company on upper State St is 
 being delayed. Apparently there is a holdup on the liquor license.
 Speaking Of Brewing Companies : 
 Reader Steve Weixel tells 
 me that he saw brewing tanks sitting outside the future home of Hollister Brewing Company in Camino Real Marketplace. The windows 
 are still papered over so it is hard to gauge how far along things are. 
 Tuesday, March 27, 2007 

 Returned From The Sea : I have 
 received word from two different readers that Bay Cafe is open 
 once again. Their phone number has changed so I haven&apos;t been able to 
 call and confirm. I&apos;ll swing by and take a look. 
 Monday, March 26, 2007
   
New Rating: No Rating : Today I introduce two new rating 
 options: and . During the Food Forum Friday face-to-face meeting with reviewers last week, 
 I received several suggestions of ways to improve this restaurant guide. 
 I have now implemented one of those suggestions. Starting today, there 
 are two new restaurant rating options: Food: No Rating and Service: No Rating . It was suggested 
 to me that at times, having a rating might not be relevant. For example, 
 when you sit down at a restaurant forever and no one gets around to 
 serving you, you might decide to leave. You could rate the service 
 accordingly, and not rate the food, because you didn&apos;t have a chance to 
 eat there. Another case might be a dining establishment that doesn&apos;t 
 really have&quot;service,&quot;such as a fast food restaurant. You could rate 
 the food but not rate the service. Finally, you might have something 
 important to say about a restaurant, while not wanting to rate the food 
 or service at all.

 Sale In Isla Vista : A tipster 
 passed to me the news that Jerusalem Garden Cafe in Isla Vista is for sale. It is still open at this time. Now, if I 
 had the will and the means to buy this place, I would open a 24-hour Spudnuts donut shop to compliment the 24-hour Freebirds World 
 Burrito across the street. It would be a match made in heaven.
 New In The Guide : I was working 
 on this guide when I suddenly heard the music of Santa Barbara&apos;s famous 
 mobile ice cream parlor, known to kids as simply&quot; The 
 Blue Truck &quot;. I grabbed my digital camera, dashed downstairs, ran 
 across my backyard, scaled the back fence, crossed the street and 
 ordered an ice cream cone with peanuts on the top. Before I knew it, 6 
 kids were pressed up against this rusty rover, going through the menu 
 plastered on the side. Only one of them had any money, so 
 SantaBarbara.com bought a round of desserts for the little ones! 
 Friday, March 23, 2007 

 Something&apos;s Brewing : Reader Darryl tells 
 me that he spoke with Charlie, the owner/manager of the 
 soon-to-be-open-on-upper-State-Street Downtown Brewing Company . 
 Charlie said they are opening next Friday, March 30th, for friends&amp;family. 
 Grand public opening is Saturday, March 31st.

 Grand 
 Opening : Coffee Bean&amp;Tea Leaf - 
 State&amp;Victoria has opened its doors today next door to the Granada 
 Theater. The official opening is Monday, March 26th at 5:30am. At that time 
 they will be having lots of giveaways. The first 200 customers on Monday 
 receive coupons, mugs, half pound of Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee or half 
 pound of Kona coffee.

 Thursday, March 22, 2007 

 New In The Guide : Today I added Gelateria Gioia in Montecito to the guide. This delightful dessert location is named 
 after the manager&apos;s daughter Gioia who can be seen at the counter in the 
 lower photograph on their page that I created today. Gelateria Gioia is 
 owned by the same people who bring you two other Montecito favorites: Pane e Vino and Via Vai Trattoria&amp;Pizzeria . 
 Tuesday, March 20, 2007 

 No Cheesecake Factory : I called the Cheesecake Factory and 
 asked that they confirm the rumor I had heard, that they are coming to 
 Santa Barbara. They told me to contact their exclusive real estate 
 company. I did, and the real estate company said they are NOT coming 
 to Santa Barbara . They said they have looked around Santa Barbara 
 but have not found any suitable location. 
 Monday, March 19, 2007 

 Hot Dog Update : I have new information about the new hot dog 
 place called Lettuce Be Frank that will be opening soon at 411 
 State Street. In addition to hot dogs, they will have the&quot;best salad 
 bar in town&quot;, hamburgers and fried chicken. And everything will be made 
 from scratch, including spices. They will be open until 3am on the 
 primary nightclub evenings. They are considering putting kiosks in the 
 various downtown bars so people can order dogs to be delivered at the 
 bar. The interior designer is the same person who designed the recently 
 opened Milk&amp;Honey . 
 The owners of Lettuce Be Frank are the guys who started the now closed Dog House on 
 Milpas St. They sold all rights to the Dog House and no longer have any 
 association with it. The grand opening of Lettuce Be Frank is currently 
 scheduled for mid-April, 2007.

 Made For Television : Reader Barry 
 tells me that during the Santa Barbara Film Festival , an episode 
 of the Food Network &apos;s TV show called Dinner Impossible was filmed 
 outside the Arlington Theater. Apparently the show&apos;s chef, Robert 
 Irvine, was filmed running around town to various local markets trying 
 to get everything he needed for the main event that evening. He even had 
 to physically build an entire kitchen near the entrance to the 
 Arlington. This episode will air on Wednesday, March 21, 2007 at 10:30pm 
 on the Food Network. 
 Friday, March 16, 2007 

 Google Maps : 
 Thanks to a suggestion from reader Dave, I finally got around to adding 
 a mapping feature to every restaurant listing in the guide. When you 
 click on the new Map link in the guide, it takes you to Google Maps, 
 with the page centered on a restaurant&apos;s address. 

 Food 
 Forum Friday II : Our next scheduled Food Forum Friday is March 23rd, 2007 at noon (next week). FFF is a chance for 
 SantaBarbara.com Restaurant Guide reviewers to get together in person, 
 during the lunch hour, and discuss the local restaurant scene. The 
 location will again be Mad Dogs on 
 State Street. I will be there and already have confirmation from a few 
 others. 
 Thursday, March 15, 2007 

 Jimmy&apos;s 
 Oriental Visitor Center : Jimmy&apos;s Oriental Gardens restaurant, that closed last year, will be preserved and become part of 
 the El Presidio de Santa Barbara State Historic Park. The Santa Barbara 
 Trust for Historic Preservation purchased the property and are 
 considering turning it into a interpretive center to showcase the 
 history of Santa Barbara&apos;s long-gone Chinatown. They are even 
 considering leasing part of it to a new restaurant owner. 
 Wednesday, March 14, 2007 

 Let Them Eat Cake : Reader Angela 
 passed me a tip that The Cheesecake Factory might occupy the 
 former location of the Acapulco Restaurant . 
 This is just a rumor at this point. I&apos;ll keep you posted.

 Burgers&amp;Beer : The Hollister Brewing Company will soon be 
 occupying the former location of Camino Real Cafe . 
 Reader John Wardlaw tells 
 me that, in addition to serving beer, they will also offer gourmet hamburgers . 

 Grand 
 Re-Opening : The restaurant Quantum , which closed two 
 years ago, is having a re-opening party tomorrow under the new name of Quantum Kitchen&amp;Cocktails , at their same 201 W. Carrillo St 
 location. 
 Tuesday, March 13, 2007 

 Dining By 
 The Beach : I have created a new section about Waterfront Dining . I receive many 
 requests for information about restaurants near the beach, so I created 
 a page with aerial photos showing exactly where the restaurants 
 are, relative to water&apos;s edge. 
 Monday, March 12, 2007 

 A 
 Restaurant Location No More : Reader Steve Weixel informs me 
 that the corner of La Cumbre Rd and State St, which once was a Koo 
 Koo Roo and, more recently, a Sushi Teri , looks 
 like it is becoming some sort of financial institution, complete with 
 office chairs, desk&amp;computers. 

 People 
 Eat Sushi From A Market? : Reader Steve Weixel also informs 
 me that the sushi counter at the Fairview Vons was closed by the health department last week. The woman he spoke to at 
 Vons didn&apos;t know when, or if, it would be back. 
 Saturday, March 10, 2007 

 We Got The Scoop : 
 Introducing Trattoria Vittoria , 
 a new Italian restaurant downtown at 30 E. Victoria St. They occupy the 
 former location of Pascuals Restaurant , 
 which, I am sad to report, is now closed. Trattoria Vittoria has been 
 open for dinner for a week, but have not put the official word out to 
 the public yet. The owners are Giovanni Comini and his wife Sofia 
 Gallina. Giovanni Comini was a proprieter of Pascual&apos;s so this is not an 
 ownership change - it&apos;s a complete restaurant change and also includes 
 live music. Sofia Gallina is owner of the Italian&amp;Greek Deli downtown, so there is a lot of solid, local experience backing this hot 
 new dinner delight. 
 Ready To Go : A few days ago I 
 mentioned that the new Coffee Bean&amp;Tea Leaf on State St might 
 be ready in 6 to 8 weeks. It looks like my estimate was off by 6 to 8 
 weeks. I glanced in the window today, and, miraculously, remodeling was 
 completed! They should be open soon. 
 Friday, March 9, 2007 

 Four New Categories : For the last 3 
 months, I have been calling each restaurant to find out what their hours 
 are and whether or not they serve breakfast. After calling 661 
 restaurants, and spending 39 hours on the phone (I feel like a teenager 
 again!), I finished the task this morning at 8:30am. Why would a person 
 subject themselves to such torture? For you, my friend. With this new 
 data in hand, I created four new categories that I launched this 
 morning: Breakfast , Open Before 8am , Open After 10pm and Open 24 Hours . Keep in mind that restaurants change their hours and 
 never tell me about it, so you might want to call them to confirm. 
 Thursday, March 8, 2007 

 Basics of Eggs Class : 10am-2pm this 
 Sunday at Williams-Sonoma in La Cumbre Plaza. Egg selection&amp;handling will be discussed, including cooking techniques such as 
 omelets, poaching and frittata. Reservations taken up to a day before

 Sneak Peak : Reader Foodie Dan noted that the sign at the former Sandman Bar&amp;Grill has been replaced with a sign promoting the Downtown Brewing Company . 
 I took a sneak peak inside and they are almost ready for business. A man 
 sweeping the floor inside said the owners had hoped to open by St. 
 Patricks Day but doesn&apos;t think they will be ready in time.

 Sneak Peak : Reader Jonathan let me 
 know that the sign is up at Pattaya Thai Restaurant&amp;Music Club in Old Town Goleta. I took a sneak peak through the window and, from 
 what I can tell, they might be ready by the end of the month. They still 
 have a bit of work to do on the place but their web site looks 
 complete.

 Sneak Peak : I was on State Street 
 and took a sneak peak in the window at the future home of Coffee Bean&amp;Tea Leaf , which used to be occupied by the Santa Barbara Sandwich 
 Company . Things are pretty torn up inside but it is taking 
 shape. Normally I would say it might open in 3 months, but this location 
 is part of a national chain, and probably has a significantly higher 
 remodel budget. So I give it 6-8 weeks if they push it.

 Name Change : Read Steve Weixel let me know 
 that Maeda Sushi has been renamed East but the 
 menus still say&quot;Maeda&quot;. I took a new exterior photo and spoke with the 
 manager. She said that it has the same owner but they are&quot;trying a 
 different concept.&quot;I heard a rumor it is supposed to be Thai - Japanese 
 fusion.

 DogHouse Re-Opening? : Reader Dave 
 was passing by the DogHouse and saw a sign on the window that said,&quot;The Doghouse 
 will re-open in March, sorry for the inconvenience.&quot;Perhaps they are 
 planning to revive the existing location?

 Changes To The Guide : Today is the 
 beginning of the 12th year of this restaurant guide. A few changes are 
 taking place. The guide will no longer expand into Solvang and Buellton as originally planned. The extra workload required to 
 maintain those regions isn&apos;t something I can take on at this point. And 
 the further you get away from Santa Barbara, a restaurant becomes less 
 relevant to a Santa Barbara restaurant guide. From this point forward, 
 I&apos;ll limit the Santa Ynez Valley section of the guide to Los Olivos and Santa Ynez , with the exception of Ballard Inn and The Hitching Post . 
 A few Solvang and Buellton locations were removed from the guide.
  Also, I decided to not include locations in the guide that don&apos;t 
 have storefronts. Places with no storefronts can&apos;t be photographed, and 
 this is a photo-centric restaurant guide. Because of this, a few 
 non-storefront bakeries were removed. The only exception is the Catering 
 category, which is reserved for sponsors.
  And finally, I am going to limit this column to restaurant news. It 
 has been fun chatting about everything under the sun in the column, but 
 it is eating up more of my time than planned and other parts of 
 SantaBarbara.com are suffering because of it. Limiting it to news for 
 the time being will mean this column might not be daily, unless the news 
 tips roll in frequently.

 100% Photo Coverage Finally Achieved! : 
 All 661 restaurants, coffee shops, etc have photographs, inside and out. 
 The photo project, started in early 2005, was finally completed last 
 Saturday - just over 2 years after it began. Before 2005, there was not 
 a single picture in the guide and no restaurant hours (hard to believe, 
 but true). The very first picture was taken on January 28th, 
 2005 while having lunch at the El Encanto on the 
 Riviera. The last picture was taken March 3rd, 2007 at the The Hitching Post in Buellton.  The total number of pictures taken, including 
 restaurants that have since gone out of business, is 1470 . I have 
 now physically been to every location from Santa Ynez Valley to 
 Carpinteria - perhaps a first for an individual in the modern history of 
 Santa Barbara? 

 Santa Ynez Photos Added : 
 The last set of photos, taken Saturday, were of the restaurants in the Santa Ynez Valley 
 section of the guide (I don&apos;t go to the valley very often, so it 
 took awhile). Restaurants with new pictures added include Ballard Inn 
 Restaurant , Big Tom&apos;s Backyard BBQ , Grappolo Trattoria , Hitching Post , Los Olivos Grocery , Panino - Los Olivos , R Country Market , Santa Ynez Burrito , The Porch and Volare .

 Winter Wine Down : The reason I was 
 in Santa Ynez Valley to take all the above-mentioned photos is because I 
 spent the day at Gainey Vineyard for a Muscular Dystrophy Association 
 fundraiser called the Winter Wine Down, where I was asked to be a food 
 judge for the culinary competition. Here is a picture of the judges in action 
 (left to right: Philip O&apos;Keefe head chef for Willows at the Chumash Casino, yours truly, and Michelle Mastrangelo owner of Epiphany Restaurant and 
 Bar ). It was a terrific event, very classy and there was a huge 
 turn out. I highly recommend you attend next year!

 New In The Guide : While I was in 
 Santa Ynez Valley shooting pictures, I added a few new restaurants to 
 the guide, including Corner House Coffee (Los Olivos) and   Volare 
 Deli &amp; Longhorn Coffee Shop (Santa Ynez). Tips: Longhorn Coffee Shop 
 has been serving breakfast&amp;lunch since 1963 and is open at 4:30am. 
 Corner House Coffee also serves smoothies and McConnell&apos;s ice cream.

 Restaurant Re-opening : Quantum , 
 closed to the public for 2 years after it transformed into a private 
 dining room, re-opens March 12 as a public restaurant again. They will 
 be open for lunch Mon-Fri and dinner Thu-Sat.

 New Name : At the beginning of 
 February 2007, Italian restaurant Paoli&apos;s changed its name to Bougainvillea . It 
 has the same owner and still serves Italian food. 

 Great 
 Vegetarian Pizzas : I am hearing from many people about how 
 great a place Pizza 
 Guru is for vegetarians and vegans. They even offer soy 
 cheese . Check &apos;em out! 

 500th Phone 
 Call : As some of you know, since January 1st, I have been 
 calling all 650+ restaurants in the guide to update the hours (when they 
 open and close each day). Yesterday I made the 500th phone call . 
 This is the first data cleanup I have done in a decade. Many restaurants 
 had no hours listed in the guide so there will be lots of new 
 information when I&apos;m done. The main reason I am doing this is so I 
 can launch new categories that show which restaurants are open late, 
 which are open early, and who serves breakfast. The award for most 
 descriptive hours goes to El Encanto Dining Room (which is closed for renovation). Here&apos;s their 
 schedule:&quot; Monday-Saturday Breakfast 7:30am-10:30am&amp;Lunch 11:30am-2:30pm&amp;Dinner 6pm-9:30pm, Sunday Breakfast 7:30am-11am&amp;Brunch 11am-2:30pm&amp;Dinner 6pm-9:30pm &quot;. 
 By contrast, Carrows hours are:&quot; Mon-Sun 24 hours &quot;

 Restaurant of the Month : 
 Congratulations to Panino - Goleta , you&apos;re Restaurant of the Month! Having recently 
 opened to the public and offering that killer #10 sandwich (read my Feb 
 12th column), Panino is more than deserving of the recognition. FYI, I 
 came back recently and tried the #10 again and it was just as 
 good as the first time! 

 A Birthday Gift To You : Le Bon Cafe has been added to the list of restaurants offering discount s in honor of this restaurant 
 guide&apos;s 11 birthday . This Sunday, March 
 4th, if you buy any entre at Le Bon Cafe, get the second entre at half price. 
 That&apos;s a killer deal. Other restaurants offering discounts include Zaffiro , Left at Albuquerque , Spiritland Bistro and Chad&apos;s . 
 Chad&apos;s is not open Sunday so they are offering their great discount on 
 Monday, March 5th. 

I&apos;ll Be The Judge Of That : I&apos;ve been invited 
 to be one of three judges at the Winter Wine Down Culinary 
 Competition that will be held 1pm-4pm this Saturday at Gainey Vineyard , 
 3950 E. Highway 246, Santa Ynez. Local restaurants will compete in five 
 categories and wineries will provide tastings. Music by Rick Reeves, 
 Blue and Crosby Loggins. Proceeds benefit the Mid-State Chapter of the 
 Muscular Dystrophy Association. Tickets $125 VIP, $75 general in advance 
 or $85 at the door. Info: 805-563-0456

 New in the Guide : Completing my 
 scouring of Goleta&apos;s Magnolia Shopping Cente r for restaurant 
 guide material, I have now added Lassen&apos;s Health Food to the Markets category. 
 Wednesday, February 28, 2007 

 New Look to the Guide : 
 I added thumbnail images to the category lists yesterday. This was the first major change to the look of those pages in 
 6 years. I could use some feedback from you about it. The pages are now 
 longer, which means more scrolling, and they are slower to load because 
 of the images. But they also add color to the page and give you a 
 glimpse at what&apos;s inside before you click. Waddayathink? It won&apos;t hurt my feelings if you tell me it sucks. 

 Restaurant Rumors : The 
 current word is that Ruth&apos;s Chris Steak House , 
 mentioned in an earlier column here, is going into the Limited Express 
 space, next to Macy&apos;s on State Street, downtown. 

 New in the Guide : I pulled 
 into Magnolia Shopping Center the other day, and, much to my surprise, I 
 spotted a deli way in the back! Subway - 
 Magnolia Center has now been added to the guide. With so many eyes and ears out there 
 sending me tips, I am amazed I was the first one to spot it! 

 East Meets West : 
 I discovered that New York Magazine recently did a story on Santa 
 Barbara, and, as part of the article, they highlighted five area 
 restaurants. Here is a lengthy quote:

&quot;In this sandal-wearing town, Sevilla s 
 orange- and gold-hued interior counts as opulent. Despite a boxy stucco 
 exterior, the Spanish restaurants urban attitude comes through in its 
 inventive tapas (the tuna seviche with passion fruit and avocado is 
 especially good) and its darkly intimate, and very busy, bar.

You cant make a reservation at the popular Arigato Sushi , 
 but the unexpectedand surprisingly deliciouscombinations make it worth 
 the wait. Dont expect leisurely service; this place likes to turn 
 tables fast.

Ask for a table on the patio at Elements , so you 
 can gaze on Santa Barbaras lovely 1929 Spanish-Moorish courthouse, 
 right across the street. The panko-crusted halibut is perfect for a 
 diet-conscious spa weekend, and the list of Sideways-caliber local wines 
 is long.

The vegetarian-friendly SpiritLand Bistro specializes in organic global fare, with a tangy Thai coconut yellow 
 curry sharing the bill with Italian vegetable risotto.

New on the scene is the crowd-drawing Fresco at the Beach , 
 which replaced a much pricier restaurant in the Santa Barbara Inn. The 
 grilled prawns with Tuscan beans served over warm arugula is spa-healthy 
 dining at its finest. Prices are good, the view even better: Its one of 
 the only restaurants in town directly overlooking the ocean.&quot;- New York

 The Big 
 Yellow House returns : As reported by Coastal View News, the 
 property formerly known as the Big Yellow House will be reopening as the Yellow Rose on September 1st, 2007 in 
 Summerland. The restaurant, a dinner house, will be operated by the 
 Rosenson family who also own The Sky Room in 
 Long Beach. The Yellow Rose will offer the same kind of fine dining as 
 The Sky Room and will be open for dinner nightly with lunch served 
 Thursday through Sunday. The cuisine will be&quot;American Continental&quot;and 
 the decor&quot;American Traditional&quot;with live music and dancing.

 Dessert Discovery of the Day : If you 
 are looking for amazing gelato or sorbet, rivaling 
 anything found in Italy, head on over to Montecito and visit Here&apos;s The Scoop , 
 which I added to the restaurant guide today. It is all the rage in 
 Montecito right now - for good reason. The Scoop is run by Bob&amp;Ellie 
 Patterson and they make everything fresh. The Scoop has raised the bar 
 for quality and taste so high, they really stand alone in the dessert 
 category. In the 20 minutes or so that I was there, one customer after 
 another would arrive and be astonished at what they found (and tasted). 
 So was I. Their most popular gelato flavor is Peanut Butter w/Reeses. 
 For those of you who don&apos;t know (like I didn&apos;t) gelato is not the 
 same thing as typical ice cream . It is more dense (less air mixed 
 in), has less fat (fat increases aftertaste) and simply tastes better . 
 Many of their sorbets are made from fresh fruit, purchased at the 
 Montecito farmers market and include flavors you may have never tried. 
 Did you know there is a fruit that is a cross between an orange and 
 grapefruit? Well there is, and they make fresh sorbet with it. One local 
 farmer grows a unique extra-tasty strawberry that is the foundation for 
 a special flavor of sorbet that has started a local following. The Scoop 
 is very much part of the Montecito community and serves their gelato and 
 sorbet to all the local elementary schools. They even have a wall inside 
 their shop displaying artwork by local 
 children . The Scoop has a gelato cart (complete with umbrella and 
 six flavors) that you can rent for weddings, fundraisers, etc. I also 
 learned that Here&apos;s the Scoop is the supplier of gelato for Northstar Coffee on State St. Every now and then, I find a hidden gem in Santa Barbara. 
 This place is one of them. 

 Just 
 Sugar : Speaking of all things sweet, Food Forum reader John Wardlaw has started a new web site called Just Sugar . It contains 
 information about how Coca-Cola and other soft drink companies switched 
 from sugar to corn syrup in the mid-1980&apos;s, dramatically altering the 
 taste of their products for generations to come. He tells how you can 
 still locate REAL Coca-Cola and other products that use sugar. Sugar 
 products don&apos;t have the strong aftertaste that corn syrup does. Just 
 Sugar is currently a small web site but it is growing as John continues 
 his research.

 Oscar @ Madison&apos;s : 
 They may appear to be an Odd Couple, but Oscar&amp; Madison&apos;s Grill&amp;Tavern are getting together this Sunday night for a party. At the same time 
 pre-Academy Awards festivities begin, so do the events at Madison&apos;s. 
 This first-annual Academy Awards party is a formal attire affair and you 
 can watch the Oscars on dozens of TV screens inside.

 Music to my Ears : Zaffiro has 
 announced that they are bringing back live music. Every Thursday night 
 they have a solo or duo classical guitarist that walks around the 
 restaurant and plays tableside. Fridays or Saturdays they will have live 
 Jazz in their lounge as well. I will give you more information when 
 their calendar is completely set. FYI, they just launched their web 
 site: ZaffiroRestaurant.com 

 New in the Guide : My recent 
 Carpinteria rendezvous is now complete with the addition of Rainbow Ice Cream&amp;Yogurt Parlor to the restaurant guide today. They are now 
 members of the new Desserts category.

 The Name Game : This is the 
 fourth column in a series about restaurants in far away cities that have 
 been given names that you will find very familiar. Should you decide to 
 hire catering services for your event, you probably don&apos;t want to call Santa Barbara Catering Company . I am sure 
 there is nothing wrong with their food, and their service is probably 
 terrific. There&apos;s just one problem: they are located in Tempe, Arizona. 
 You can even find them on the web at SantaBarbaraCatering.com. To add to 
 the confusion, their web site uses the acronym&quot;SBCC&quot;which, of course, 
 is a well known acronym for our local college. To top it all off: if you 
 search for&quot;Santa Barbara Catering&quot;in Google, they&apos;re listed #1. 
Thursday, February 22, 2007

 New in the Guide : Last 
 weekend I visited my friend Preston in Carpinteria and I used that 
 opportunity to gather up a few restaurants that had thus far eluded me. 
 This time I successfully tracked down the Worker Bee Cafe on Linden Ave in Carpinteria and added them to the guide. The Worker Bee 
 Cafe is owned and operated by Oscar&amp;Jamie Beaulieu. They serve 
 breakfast and lunch.

 Cell Phone Pictures of the Day : 
 I had lunch with a friend the other day at Fresco! , 
 and, of course, ordered the Crackwich Award -winning Hot 
 Mushroom Combo sandwich. This time I ordered the beef stew instead of my 
 usual mixed green salad. While I was there, I took pictures of the outside , the patio , the order line and the dining room .

 The Name Game : This is the 
 third in a series about restaurants in far away cities that have been 
 given names that you will find very familiar. If you want to go to the Montecito Restaurant&amp;Bar , you won&apos;t locate it on 
 Coast Village Road. It&apos;s not in the upper Montecito village area either. 
 You instead need to fly to Denver, Colorado to enjoy this 
 little taste of home. Their web site is MontecitoRestaurant.com . I found the following blurb about them:&quot;Named for a small village on the central coast of California, this 
 whimsical bistro features eclectic foodstuffs culled from California, 
 Italy and France. The intimate dining room--flanked by cinnamon-hued 
 parasols illuminated with tiny white lights--mimics the sophisticated 
 and playful menu. Upscale guests dine on Chef Adam Mali&apos;s grilled 
 Vermont cheddar and Macintosh apple sandwiches, Tuscan minestrone soup 
 or Colorado lamb Bolognese. The well-chosen wine list proffers about 10 
 by-the-glass pours.&quot;

 Restaurant Rumors : Well, 
 the rumor I heard yesterday was completely full of it. Well... not 
 completely. Partially. It turns out that a restaurant named Marmalade Cafe is moving into the space previously occupied by Red Robin at 
 La Cumbre Plaza. Marmalade Cafe has locations in Santa Monica, Malibu, 
 Sherman Oaks, Westlake Village and Calabasas. Visit their web site for details. Ruth&apos;s Chris Steak House is definitely coming to town but where will they be going? Reader Foodie 
 Dan thinks they may go in the spot previously occupied by Acapulco Restaurant . There I go again - spreading 
 unsubstantiated rumors!

 New in the Guide : As 
 mentioned in a previous column, a fancy Italian restaurant named Giannfranco&apos;s Trattoria opened in Carpinteria recently and I have now added them to the guide. 
 They are not the only Italian restaurant in town but the first with that 
 white-table-cloth-high-end-not-a-pizza-place feel. So how did they come 
 up with the name of their restaurant? Hint: the principles are named 
 Giovanni, Anne and Frank. Feeling hungry for good Italian food? They are 
 located at 666 Linden Ave and serve lunch&amp;dinner. You&apos;ll have a hell 
 of a good time.

 The Name Game : This is the 
 second in a series about restaurants in far away cities that have been 
 given names that you will find very familiar. If you are ever studying 
 for a law degree at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, be 
 sure to stop by Santa Barbara Cafe . Here&apos;s a map , in case you have trouble finding it. I located the following 
 description:&quot;Decorated in green, white, and pink tones, this small 
 Santa Barbara dining room offers a cheerful escape from its bustling 
 surroundings. Students and professionals enjoy calorie-conscious fare 
 like smoked turkey, humus sandwiches, and various chicken and pasta 
 salads.&quot;So, from what I can tell, we stereotype them as a bunch of 
 lawyers, and they stereotype us as the pastel, cheerful, 
 calorie-conscious type. I think we&apos;re both correct!

 Restaurant Rumors : I&apos;ve 
 heard a rumor that an upscale dining venue may be coming to La 
 Cumbre Plaza, in the location formerly occupied by Red Robin . 
 The restaurant is named Ruth&apos;s Chris Steak House . Their web site contains the following 
 description:&quot;From the U.S. Prime steaks, broiled to perfection at 1800 
 degrees, to the expertly executed seafood, New Orleans-inspired 
 appetizers, unforgettable desserts and award winning wine list, this is 
 a steakhouse to which others aspire.&quot;

 New in the Guide : The last 
 of a series of restaurants referred to me by reader Christine, I added a 
 little place in Los Olivos named R Country 
 Store . I am told this is a great little deli with tri tip 
 sandwiches and cool drinks. Christine says it is a very local place for 
 great deli sandwiches, and hand scooped ice cream from McConnell&apos;s . 

 The Name Game : This is the 
 first in a series about restaurants in far away cities that have been 
 given names that you will find very familiar. Last summer, I was 
 visiting my childhood friend who had moved from Santa Barbara to 
 Friendswood, Texas, a small city 30 minutes south of Houston. One hot, 
 humid, summer day, while we were driving with the windows rolled-up and 
 the air conditioning blasting, I noticed a large sign that caused me to 
 do a double-take. The sign said Santa Barbara Italian Cafe . 
 My first thought was&quot;Hey! You&apos;re sponging my city&apos;s name!&quot;I then 
 realized how cool it was to be in the middle of nowhere (no offense 
 Friendswood) and finding a restaurant that was promoting your home town. 
 Unfortunately, I didn&apos;t get a chance to stop in to see if they actually 
 dressed up the interior with stucco walls and red tiles, but I did 
 manage to find their web 
 site . I plan to return to Friendswood, Texas again this summer and 
 will stop in and take a picture.

 You Gotta Start Somewhere : 
 Speaking of my friend in Texas, I thought that Herb Peterson (the owner of all locals McDonald&apos;s and the inventor of the Egg McMuffin) might be interested in knowing 
 what became of one of his former employees. My Lone Star State pal got 
 his first job at McDonald&apos;s - 
 State St (at the time it was located a few doors down where Chef Karim&apos;s currently resides). He later attended UCSB then Stanford, where he 
 graduated with a degree in biochemistry. He went on to get his MD&amp;PhD 
 and is currently a doctor working in an ER. He has a family of 5 and 
 owns a mansion, complete with swimming pool and outdoor kitchen. Now I 
 wish I had worked at McDonald&apos;s!

 New in the Guide : I 
 discovered a great little ice cream shop tucked far away in a corner in 
 the Fairview Shopping Center. It is just to the right of OSH, down a 
 small alley of stores. This little dessert haven is named Carvel . 
 Carvel is a big name on the east coast (their equivalent of Baskin 
 Robbins) but is relatively unknown out west. It is the nation&apos;s first 
 retail ice cream franchise, founded in 1934 by Tom 
 Carvel and is credited with creating the&quot;soft-serve&quot;ice cream (you 
 know, those swirly cone ice cream dispensers we see everywhere). I spoke 
 with owner Rajni and he said that their&quot;Wednesday is Sundae&quot;special is 
 very popular (buy one classic sundae on a Wednesday, receive a second 
 one free). Rajni told me that the really big draw of Carvel is his ice 
 cream cakes because they are made fresh (and are pure ice cream - no 
 sponge cake). Most places sell ice cream cakes that have been frozen for 
 months. His store sells fresh ice cream cakes that are never more than a 
 week old. He makes them as he needs them. The Carvel-brand ice cream 
 cakes you might find in the supermarkets are shipped from out of town 
 and are not fresh-made like his. You need to go to the Fairview store to 
 get the good stuff .
 
 Cell Phone Pictures of the Day : 
 I stopped by La 
 Super Rica on Friday night for dinner. As always, there was 
 a line but I was able to get a plate of their tasty chicken alambre (the 
 #8) that consists of chicken, onions, green bell peppers and a tortilla 
 made fresh right there. I took pictures of the kitchen (making their famous fresh 
 tortillas), the dining area , and, of 
 course, the line .
 
 New Restaurant Owner Control Panel : 
 The owners of Restaurant NU contacted me and have requested a free control panel account. This means 
 you will be able to read more information about them and see responses 
 to reviews. Welcome aboard Restaurant NU!

 Secret Sauce : About six 
 years ago, I was having lunch at Cajun Kitchen - Goleta (at that time they were located near the airport) when a friend told me 
 about his favorite dip for french fries. He said he likes to put a 
 little bit of ketchup on his plate and pour Tabasco sauce on 
 it. I thought that was kind of odd but was willing to give it a try. To 
 my total surprise, the taste was absolutely amazing . Don&apos;t go 
 over board with the Tabasco, just drizzle a little bit on top of a small 
 pile of ketchup. Ever since that fateful day, I have used ketchup&amp;Tabasco for almost every type of potato dish that comes my way. Most 
 frequently the destination is french fries and hash browns, but the secret sauce is now starting to make its way on to the burger too. 
 Where will it end? Give it a try.

 Chocoholics Anonymous : 
 The 20th annual Chocoholics Festival is happening 
 tomorrow 11am to 2pm in Lompoc. Location is Grange Hall, 435 N. G Street . Walk down&quot;Chocolate Street&quot;and sample hand-made chocolates! $7 
 donations benefits a local scholarship fund. 805-736-8083 

 Carpintrattoria : 
 Reader Jonathon Schuhrke tells me a new restaurant named Giannfranco&apos;s Trattoria has opened in Carpinteria in the former 
 location of the Deli House , at 666 Linden Ave. He says it&apos;s been open a 
 couple weeks now and anytime he goes by at lunch, the place is packed. 
 Time for me to put new batteries in my digital camera and head south to 
 check it out!
 
 Friday Night Wine Tasting : 
 I have heard from many people how cool the Friday night wine tastings 
 are at East Beach Wine , 201 S. Milpas St. Tastings are 
 4-7pm and tonight is the&quot;7th Annual Anniversary Tasting&quot;Special guests 
 include Blair Fox Cellars, Carhatt Vineyard and Ampelos Cellars. $8 at 
 the door, no arrivals after 6:45pm. From what I am told, it is also a 
 cool place to socialize. For that matter, the entire city of Santa 
 Barbara is a cool place to socialize. 

 As If You Care : I 
 created a web page about my Santa 
 Claus escapade that occurred last December. It has online videos of 
 most of the national interviews I did, including CNN, Fox News and 
 MSNBC. Believe it or not, I am STILL getting phone calls from kids, even 
 as of mid-February!

 New Restaurant Owner Control Panel : 
 The owners of Savoy Truffles contacted me and have requested a free control panel account. This means 
 you will be able to read more information about them and see responses 
 to reviews. Welcome aboard Savoy Truffles! 

 Breakfast in America : 
 Reader Jenss Chang tells me he passed by Dish Cafe the other day, and they had a banner up that said that they were now 
 serving breakfast. They are now open at 8am instead of 11:30am.

 Reader Pictures : Starting 
 today, readers who submit news to the Food Forum can also have their 
 photo included with the story. Readers Steve Weixel , LemonJelly and John Wardlaw were the first 
 on board! 

 New in the Guide : Reader 
 Christine Cunningham submitted two restaurants from Solvang that are now 
 in the guide. Today I added Chef&apos;s Touch and Mandarin 
 Touch .

 Restaurant Rumors : Reader 
 Anita Blakemore passed word on to me that the web site for The 
 Melting Pot , a fondue restaurant with franchises nationwide, 
 now lists Santa Barbara as&quot;Coming Soon&quot;and even have a page on their web site setup for Santa Barbara. So where do we, the 
 diners of the South Coast, think they will be located? Anita at first 
 thought they might move into the old Sushi Teri location at State&amp;La Cumbre - but now thinks it is too small. Her 
 best guess is the former home of Acapulco Restaurant in La Arcada in downtown Santa 
 Barbara. Keep in mind that we are just speculating here. I&apos;ll give you 
 the cold hard facts moments after they hit my inbox...
 
 &quot;Most 
 Number of Sauces On Your Table&quot;Award : This prestigious 
 honor goes to none other than Cajun Kitchen - Goleta with a total of 9 sauces (mostly hot) on my table when I was seated for 
 lunch yesterday. Lest you not believe me, see a picture I took with my 
 Treo 700wx cell phone of this amazing sight. From left to right I had 
 Apple Butter, fresh salsa, Tabasco Red Pepper Sauce, Cholula Hot Sauce, 
 Tony Chachere&apos;s Louisiana Pepper Sauce, Cajun Powder Garlic Sauce, 
 Tabasco Green Pepper Sauce, Tapatio Salsa Picante Hot Sauce and last but 
 not least, an ever-dependable bottle of Heinz Tomato Ketchup. In case 
 you are dying to know, I used the Apple Butter (for my bread), red 
 Tabasco and Ketchup.

 New in the Guide : Reader Steve Weixel was the first 
 to inform me of the opening of Panino - Goleta . 
 No more than five minutes after Steve&apos;s email, I received Food Forum 
 feedback with an official announcement of Panino&apos;s opening in Goleta 
 from Carter Benson, Chief Operating Officer of Panino, Inc. 
 Congratulations Panino for opening your fifth location!

 Excellent Meal of the Day : [Crackwich Alert] Speaking of Panino - Goleta , 
 I drove over to their new restaurant to take pictures and spoke with 
 manager Stephen Hoke for awhile. I asked him what was the most popular 
 item on the menu, and, without hesitation, he told me it was The Number Ten . The #10 is a grilled chicken sandwich 
 with provolone. It includes sun-dried tomatoes, fresh basil and honey 
 mustard. He said the sandwich is best when served with focaccia bread. 
 He made a point to emphasize the importance of choosing that particular 
 bread. Having just had lunch elsewhere, I decided to order the #10 to go 
 and have it for dinner later that evening. Fast forward 15 minutes and I 
 am sitting in my car in a parking lot in downtown Santa Barbara. Before 
 I go off to a business meeting, I decide to try just a nibble of the #10 so I don&apos;t have to wait until dinner to see what the 
 excitement over this sandwich is all about. One bite and my plans for 
 saving this sandwich for dinner were doomed. Rather than go immediately 
 to my appointment as planned, I decided to instead stay in my car and 
 devour this delicious beast. To hell with saving it for dinner. 
 This sandwich receives our coveted Crackwich award for it&apos;s lethally addicting qualities! Tell &apos;em

 New in the Guide : 
 Reader Christine Cunningham sent me a list of restaurants from Santa 
 Ynez Valley that I will add to the guide. Today I added two locations 
 from her list, both from the city of Santa Ynez. Santa Ynez Burrito on Edison St is located inside Rio Markets. Apparently they serve organic Mexican food which is awesome. Also added was Volare , an 
 Italian restaurant also on Edison St. When I refer to these restaurants 
 as being in Santa Ynez, I don&apos;t mean just anywhere in the Santa Ynez 
 Valley. These are actually in the city of Santa Ynez near the Chumash 
 Casino.

 Starbucks Redux : Continuing 
 my February 1st story about Starbucks serving breakfast, reader Steve Weixel informs me 
 that the Starbucks - Fairview does NOT have the new breakfast sandwiches, but he has had visual 
 confirmation at Camino Real , 5-Points , La Cumbre Plaza , 
 and Victoria .

 The Mexican Food Diet : I 
 lost nearly 20 pounds last year. How did I do it? For breakfast each day 
 I had a protein shake made from Trader Joe&apos;s vanilla-flavored soy protein powder. I put cold water in a blender, two 
 scoops of protein powder and 2 packets of Splenda artificial sweetener. 
 For lunch I ate at Baja Fresh almost every day (the staff and I are now on a first-name basis). I 
 ordered two original-style Baja tacos, mild salsa and a diet 
 caffeine-free Pepsi. The tacos come with chips which I also consumed, 
 but I did not have a side of rice&amp;beans. For dinner I had two Lean 
 Cuisine frozen meals except on Tuesday nights when I would have dinner 
 at New Baja Grill instead (that&apos;s their 2-for-1 taco night). I ordered (you guessed it) 
 two chicken tacos. If I was downtown during lunch or dinner time I would 
 usually eat at Chipotle . I ordered three soft chicken tacos (because they 
 give less meat in their tacos) with the corn-salsa topping. In the 
 beginning of the diet, it takes a while to adjust to consuming much less 
 food than I used to. This meant I would feel hungry. In the early days I 
 would have a Zone bar in the afternoon until my hungry stage passed 
 (after a week or two) and I was used to eating less. I still 
 occasionally have a protein shake in the afternoon if I am hungry. Going 
 for a run for 30 minutes, four times a week, was the final piece of the 
 puzzle (along with push-ups and sit-ups). Be sure to weigh yourself 
 every day and be extremely conscious of what you eat every day. I mostly 
 cut out desserts, because having one would make me crave sugar for days. 
 I still have them on occasion. One final note: keep in mind that weight 
 loss occurs at different speeds. In the beginning I would lose a pound a 
 week, then it changed to a pound a month with the exact same eating 
 habits. Nature can be cruel!

 Back in Business : Reader John Wardlaw tells me that Kahuna Grill has reopened, having successfully recovered from a fire that started in 
 the kitchen during the night a week ago. The fire started in a 
 refrigerator or all places, and the automatic sprinkler system saved the 
 day. Unfortunately the water did a number on all of Dale&apos;s cool surfing 
 paraphernalia.

 Caffeine Headache : 
 Reader Steve Weixel informs 
 me that he was talking with the barista at Fairview Starbucks the other day and was told that Fairview Starbucks would be closing for 
 some time so that it can be gutted and remodeled. No need to panic 
 however; there is another Starbucks just 50 feet away, inside Vons Market . 
 
New in the Guide : Reader Christine Cunningham sent me a 
 list of restaurants from Santa Ynez Valley that I will add to the guide. 
 Today I added three locations from her list, all from Buellton. First 
 onboard is a Japanese restaurant named A-RU . She 
 says that this is the best sushi around and that the owner Gina is 
 notorious for her standards. I also added a Mexican restaurant named Taco Roco that Christine says has the best carnitas and is her favorite place in 
 SB County to have a fish taco. Taco Roco has another location in 
 Solvang. Finally, I added a bakery/deli named PattiBakes . 
 Christine says this is a gem of a place in a hidden corner of a 
 nondescript mall - great bakery items&amp;cupcakes, great lunches 
 including paninis, soups&amp;sandwiches.

 I&apos;m Going to Start Camping Outside : 
 Reader Steve Weixel rode by 
 the future home of Panino Goleta last night and the door was open while they were working and he had a 
 peek inside. He said it looked like they were almost done. I wouldn&apos;t be 
 surprised if they open very soon.

 Sign of the Times : In Old 
 Town Goleta, at the former location of Alex&apos;s Cantina (next to Natural 
 Cafe ), reader Steve Weixel spotted a new sign up for&quot; Pattaya Bar&amp;Grill &quot;and said that the building has a fresh coat of paint. Last summer I 
 heard rumors that a Thai restaurant was going to open at this location 
 but then nothing ever seemed to materialize. It sounds like things are 
 back on track. This will be a welcome addition to Goleta and I look 
 forward to trying them out!

 She Loves Me, She Loves Me Not : 
 Well, here we go once again, rapidly approaching Valentines Day . 
 And you might be thinking to yourself&quot;where should I take my honey 
 bunny on the 14th?&quot;My official recommendation is not located on State 
 Street. It&apos;s not even downtown for that matter. And you won&apos;t find it in 
 Goleta. You see, on February 14th, the price of Valentines Day dinners 
 all over the city tend to be jacked-up through the roof and frequently 
 you are limited to a special&quot;Valentines Day menu&quot;that might be 
 something you wouldn&apos;t normally order. I highly recommend you take your 
 lovey-dovey, schmoopie-doopie or future-ex out to a spectacular dinner 
 on February 13th. Or, better yet, on Valentines Day, you should stay 
 home and cook her a romantic meal yourself (Chinese take-out 
 not allowed). Setup a romantic dinner table with two long candles, your 
 best dinnerware, cloth napkins and Andrea Bocelli on your stereo. For 
 dessert, bring out two scoops of her favorite ice cream with a side of 
 fresh strawberries. Finish off the evening by cuddling up to the movie Love Actually . 

 Down From the Heavens : 
 Last night the Plow&amp;Angel restaurant, located at Ty 
 Warner&apos;s San Ysidro Ranch in Montecito, finally re-opened for business. 
 Enjoy a cozy ambiance complete with fireplace and live music on 
 weekends. They serve until 10PM but currently have no reservations.

 Today on the Radio : Today from 2pm-3pm the SantaBarbara.com Restaurant 
 Guide is featured on radio AM 1290 .   I&apos;ll 
 be a guest for the full hour on the Business&amp;Technology Show . For the first part of the show I&apos;ll 
 be talking about SantaBarbara.com and this restaurant guide. To give the 
 restaurant owner perspective, they have invited Chad Stevens, owner of Chad&apos;s Restaurant and Sambos to talk 
 about the restaurant guide&apos;s impact on his businesses and the community. 
 The second half of the show I&apos;ll be talking about how I became the&quot;Accidental Santa Claus&quot;last Christmas, a story that made nationwide 
 news. See my January 4th column (below) for details and pictures of that 
 peculiar event! The show will be rebroadcast at 10pm tonight and at 2pm 
 on Sunday, February 11th and will be archived on 
 business-and-technology.com for listening anytime.

 Food Forum Fest : Last 
 Wednesday I had lunch with reviewer LemonJelly to discuss the restaurant scene in 
 Santa Barbara. I had never met a restaurant reviewer face-to-face 
 before. We had lunch at Mad Dogs on 
 State Street and Eric Hamor, owner of Mad Dogs, joined in the 
 discussion. It was so much fun, I thought I would give the gathering an 
 official name: Food Forum Fest. We&apos;ll meet again later this 
 month and this time it is open to everyone (except my 11th grade math 
 teacher). We will meet for one hour at Mad Dogs and discuss anything and 
 everything food-related in Santa Barbara. I&apos;ll give you details in this 
 column when the next Food Forum Fest takes place.

 Excellent Meal of the Day : 
 Speaking of Chad&apos;s Restaurant , you 
 must try the Chad&apos;s Sampler Platter. A meal this good is even worth a 
 drive from L.A. to Santa Barbara just to check it out. This platter is a 
 three course tour of Chad&apos;s specialties. Start with Caesar salads 
 followed by full entrees of Blackened Filet, Caramelized Halibut and 
 Chicken Tchoupitoulas. Finish the experience with their delicious 
 Chocolate Jack Daniel&apos;s Soufflé. I discovered this meal the first time 
 I visited Chad&apos;s years ago and it sent me into taste bud euphoria. If I 
 remember correctly, the Chad&apos;s Sampler Platter is a dinner for two, not 
 just one person. Tell &apos;em SantaBarbara.com sent you.

 Something&apos;s Brewing on State : 
 Reader Foodie Dan tells me that he just noticed a fictitious business 
 statement for the&quot; Downtown Brewing Co .&quot;to open at the 
 address of the current Sandman Bar and Grill . 
 Will the Santa 
 Barbara Brewing Company soon have some new competition? 

 Speaking of Brew : 
 The Camino Real 
 Cafe at Camino Real Marketplace is long gone and will soon 
 be replaced by the Hollister Brewing Company . 
Thursday, February 1, 2007

 Would You Like Room for Ketchup? : 
 Reader Steve Weixel tells 
 me that he went to the Starbucks - Camino Real 
 Marketplace yesterday and noticed they started selling 
 breakfast sandwiches. There are 5 varieties and they can heat them up 
 for you. According to the barista, they just started the previous day 
 (1/30) and are available at all Starbucks locations in town.
 
 Lettuce Try Again : A 
 tipster informed me that the DogHouse , 
 recently closed on Milpas St, will reopen on State Street in the former 
 location of Zeno 
 Manue which unfortunately closed recently. This new doggy 
 delight will be named Lettuce Be Frank and will sell 
 salads and hot dogs. 

 New Turkish Market : 
 Reader Caroline tells me that a new Turkish market named Mediterra has opened next to Sizzler in Goleta. Apparently they 
 are a market and deli. I&apos;ll go check it out and report back to you ASAP! 

 Restaurant of the Month : 
 Congratulations to Milk&amp;Honey - you&apos;re Restaurant of the Month! Milk&amp;Honey offers a Tapas bar and is 
 brought to you by the same people who operate Alcazar on 
 the Mesa.

 SantaBarbara.com Survey 2007 : 
 I conducted an online survey during last November&amp;December to 
 determine the most popular restaurants in the Santa Barbara area. The 
 number of responses to the poll far exceeded my expectations and it took 
 me 28 days to tabulate the results. Next year I will come up with a more 
 efficient system to get the results out much more quickly. Here they are 
 folks - the results of your votes - the Best 
 Restaurants of Santa Barbara . These results will be on display all 
 year. Congratulations to the winners!
 
 Tunes and &apos;Tainment : Bricks Cafe now has entertainment 7 days a week. From live Bossa Nova / Brazilian 
 Jazz with Teka and Alberto Negroni to Stand Up Comedy. Check them out! 

 That&apos;s Greek To Me : 
 In my January 18, 2006 Food Forum column I told you that the Santa 
 Barbara News-Press reported that the Italian&amp;Greek Market is closing. Now I am not so sure if McCaw&amp;Company are correct. Reader 
 Hajir Sailors sent me this message yesterday:&quot;I just wanted to tell you 
 that when I stopped by at the Italian and Greek Market earlier today I 
 asked them if they were really closing...they said they weren&apos;t and 
 somehow the rumor was getting around . &quot; 

 New Restaurant Owner Control Panel : 
 The owners of Sweet Alley contacted me and have requested a free control panel account. This means 
 you will be able to read more information about them and see responses 
 to reviews. Welcome aboard Sweet Alley!

 A Fire at Kahuna : 
 Reader John Wardlaw tells 
 me there has been a fire at Kahuna Grill in Camino Real Marketplace. There was $20,000 worth of damage and the 
 fire apparently started in the ceiling. They are closed until further 
 notice. My best wishes to Dale and the whole crew at Kahuna. Like so 
 many others, I eat there a lot. I hope you reopen quickly!
 
New in the Guide : Finding myself on Milpas St, I dropped 
 into Scolari&apos;s , 
 took pictures, gathered info and added them to this restaurant guide. 
 They were added to three categories: Markets, Bakeries and Deli. 
 
 Cooking with Class :  Spiritland Bistro writes:&quot;Chef Joel Koch from Spiritland Bistro is announcing 
 cooking classes that are scheduled every other Tuesday at 6:00-8:30 P.M. 
 from January 23rd, 2007- June 2007. Go to the website at 
 spiritlandbistro.com or call 805-884-8710 to learn more specific 
 information on the cultures, styles and techniques that Chef Joel will 
 be demonstrating. The classes are fun, entertaining, and educational and 
 the class includes a full three course meal. Come join us but class size 
 is limited and pre-registration is required.&quot; 

 Santa Barbara&apos;s Most Wanted : 
 Agent Steve Weixel took 
 over command of the Smoothie Task Force and rounded up a huge batch of 
 hideouts, including Northstar Coffee , Goleta Coffee , Daily Grind , Cafe Luna , Java Station , Garden Market , Pierre Lafond - 
 Montecito , Natural Cafe (all locations), Dish Cafe , Le Bon Cafe , Sojourner &amp; Lazy Acres . 
 Here is a picture from one 
 of Steve&apos;s many bicycle trips around town in search of smoothie nirvana. 

 Wine, Women and Song : 
 Reader Duncan Westley puts out this urgent request to all Food Forum 
 Fans:&quot;I&apos;m trying to find a bottle of the 2001 Au Bon Climat 
 Chardonnay Harmony Chardonnay , with no luck. It&apos;s my girlfriend&apos;s 
 favorite wine, and it&apos;s our three year anniversary coming up.&quot;

 Dog Zombie : It 
 appears DogHouse has pushed aside its tombstone and risen from the dead. DogHouse has 
 been spotted leaving the pet cemetery, eyes glazed, paws sticking 
 straight out, slowly marching towards State St. The Santa Barbara 
 News-Press reports that DogHouse has indeed closed, but now have plans 
 to open on State St, as soon as they find a place. They plan to stay 
 open until 3am at the State St location. Is a dog fight coming soon 
 between DogHouse and Mad Dogs to 
 see who is leader of the pack?

 Memory Lane : Traveling to 
 my old homestead, I recently stopped by Montecito Village 
 Grocery , took pictures, gathered information and added them 
 to the Markets section of this restaurant guide. When I was a kid, 
 growing up off of San Ysidro Rd in Montecito, this market was called&quot;Isaia&apos;s.&quot;My friends and I used to leave Montecito Union School at 3pm 
 and go up to Isaia&apos;s or Pierre Lafond for our daily candy run. The funny thing is that Montecito Village 
 Grocery has not changed a bit since I was a kid. It is one part of 
 Montecito that has been locked in time, and avoided&quot;Rodeo Drive 
 syndrome&quot;afflicting many other commercial venues. It remains your 
 friendly neighborhood grocery store with (gasp!) reasonable prices.

 Smoothie Criminal : It tried 
 to avoid detection but I successfully tracked down, and found in hiding, 
 a smoothie location off of Carrillo Street downtown. Cornered by my 
 smoothie bloodhounds, Spudnuts - Downtown confessed to harboring a smoothie service behind their 
 voted-best-in-town-every-year donut selection. I encourage others to 
 join my smoothie task force and email me if they spot a rogue blender 
 seeking refuge in a restaurant or coffee shop near you. 
Wednesday, January 24, 2007

 New in the Guide : I 
 drove over to the west side of Santa Barbara and visited Foodland market, where I took pictures and gathered information from the manager. 
 This is the largest market on the west side of town. I have added 
 Foodland to the Markets section of the restaurant guide. 
 
 Good Deed of the Day : Thank you to Fish 
 House restaurant on Cabrillo Blvd for providing free 
 appetizers and a meeting space for the Black&amp;Blue Ball committee 
 meeting yesterday. These weren&apos;t just any appetizers, mind you. They 
 were gourmet seafood platters with calamari and stuffed prawns, just to 
 name a few of the ingredients. They also included bread and water 
 refills for the whole crew. I recently joined the Black&amp;Blue Ball 
 committee to help out the annual event (Sunday, July 23, 2007) which 
 raises money for the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Expect to see LOTS 
 of plugs for the Black&amp;Blue Ball on SantaBarbara.com over the next few 
 months! 

 Excellent Meal of the Day : 
 The award goes to D&apos;Angelo for 
 having the very best waffle in town . I don&apos;t think anyone else 
 comes close. D&apos;Angelo has a crispy buckwheat waffle (none of that soggy 
 waffle stuff here!), and uses real maple syrup. To accompany your 
 waffle, they also offer one of the best cups of coffee in town. Tell &apos;em 
 SantaBarbara.com sent you.

 Lights, Camera, Action : Elements 
 Restaurant , Bar and Catering will be a sponsor of this year&apos;s Santa Barbara 
 International Film Festival. Elements is the selected caterer for a host 
 of Film Festival events, including the Montecito Award Tribute 
 after-party for Bill Condon and the American Riviera Award Tribute 
 after-party for Forest Whitaker. Elements will also cater the 
 hospitality lounges and green rooms throughout the eleven-day event. 
 Meanwhile, back at Elements, producers and composers will gather for a 
 panel luncheon during the Festival. $22 Menus Offered in Honor of the 
 Festival&apos;s 22nd Year, January 25 through February 4, 2007 
 
The Spiritland Channel : Chef Joel at Spiritland Bistro is featured on Channel 18 this month with a cooking presentation of 
 eating healthy in 2007. The segment on Inside Santa Barbara about Healthy Food is now airing on City TV, Channel 18. Here is the 
 schedule: Monday 8:00&amp;8:30PM, Tuesday 5:00&amp;5:30PM, Wednesday 6:30PM, 
 Saturday 9:00&amp;9:30PM Sunday 10:30&amp;11:00PM

 New In The Guide : I have nearly completed the list of the larger Markets in town. 
 Yesterday I stopped by Trader Joes - De la Vina , gathered info, took some 
 pics and added them to the restaurant guide. Why am I listing markets in 
 a restaurant guide? Because I can.

 World Traveler : I had a 
 delicious lunch the other day at Spiritland Bistro and learned that they have a rotating menu option where each week they 
 serve a meal from a different country. This week was Poland, next week 
 is Greek! I definitely will go back to try their international dinners. 
 Call to find out what the country-of-the-week is.

 Excellent Meal of the Day : 
 Perhaps my most favorite meal in town is the Prime Rib at golf-themed Tee-Off 
 Restaurant&amp;Cocktails on upper State Street. The Prime Rib 
 comes in a variety of sizes, from not much more than a nibble to what 
 seems like half the cow. I prefer the&quot;Par Cut&quot;with extra horseradish 
 sauce and a side of garlic mash potatoes. Tee-Off prepares their Prime 
 Rib in a magical way that others just can&apos;t seem to duplicate. Many 
 restaurants in town serve good prime rib. The Tee-Off serves spectacular Prime Rib. Tell &apos;em SantaBarbara.com sent you.

 Calling All Smoothie Fans : 
 I have a new section of the restaurant guide that lists all the smoothie 
 locations in town. Finding the dedicated smoothie shops like Blenders in the Grass or Jamba Juice was easy. Finding the small places that serve smoothies as an option 
 (for example Spudnuts - Upper State ) is very difficult. Please email me if you spot any place in town that serves smoothies that is not 
 currently listed in the Smoothie category!

 Arrivederci : The Gallina family that owns the Italian&amp;Greek Market , 
 and the building it has occupied since 1971, are looking to sell the 
 property. It is not yet known if the business will move to another 
 location or close. The owner&apos;s stepson, John Morosin has been running 
 the business and has experienced personal difficulties recently 
 including a bout with cancer and a divorce. Word is that he is tired of 
 running the business and no one else in the family is interested in 
 taking over. The family has until the end of this month to renew their 
 business license, which expired at the end of 2006.

 Smart Alec : I receive TONS 
 of requests from the public about where to eat. People ask me what 
 restaurants have private dining rooms, what restaurants can handle 
 parties of 75, where is good Italian food with an ocean view, where is a 
 good place to get a meal for a wedding party, a graduation, a birthday, 
 a family reunion, a business meeting, and so on. You get the picture. 
 Last week a kind lady asked me where her party of 25 could have dinner, including alcoholic beverages , for a total of no more that $10 per 
 person. Rather than tell her she is absolutely crazy, and that the 
 drinks alone would cost more that $10, I realized that, actually, it IS 
 possible. I told her to go to dinner at Taco Bell - 
 South Fairview , then walk a few doors down to 7-11 for a beer. She never wrote me back.

 They Should Just Call It Water : 
 Here is a tip for those of you, who, like myself, enjoy caffeine-free 
 diet colas. I thought it was impossible to find a restaurant that serves caffeine-free Diet Coke or caffeine-free Diet Pepsi on tap in Santa Barbara. Every place sells 
 Sprite, lemonade, etc, but a caffeine-free diet coke is a no-show in 
 this town. Last year I finally discovered that Baja Fresh - Goleta and Baja Fresh - Santa 
 Barbara offer caffeine-free Diet Pepsi at the soda fountain. I now eat there all 
 the time because of this.

 As If You Care : I don&apos;t 
 except complimentary meals from local restaurant owners. Doing so gives 
 an appearance of impropriety. Sometimes when a kind owner insists on 
 giving me a free meal and doesn&apos;t bring me a bill, I leave a tip equal 
 to the price of the meal. This doesn&apos;t happen often, mind you. When I 
 walk into a restaurant, it&apos;s not as if the waiters suddenly shout&quot;Hey! 
 You&apos;re the guy in the fuzzy black&amp;white picture on that web site!&quot;No, 
 I am happily anonymous almost everywhere I go. The only exception to my impeccable integrity is with respect to hot dogs. If all your 
 business sells are hot dogs (sorry Downey&apos;s , that doesn&apos;t include you), and you give Johnny 
 here a freebee, I&apos;ll give you a shameless plug in this column. Costco , are 
 you reading this?? 
Wednesday, January 17, 2007

 Dog Day Afternoon : 
 Just as local frankfurter fans are reeling from the loss of the DogHouse , 
 reader James tells me that Buddy&apos;s Pretzels&amp;Dogs of Carpinteria has been put to sleep. Two hot dog stands have been sent 
 to the pound this year and it&apos;s only January 17th! In case you are 
 thinking of hounding me for more information, you&apos;re barking up the 
 wrong tree. All I can tell you is that the hot dog business is a cruel 
 world if you can&apos;t cut the mustard. 

 Leaving the Nest : 
 Speaking of restaurants closing, Reader Dan tells me that Red Robin at 
 La Cumbre Plaza is leaving soon. Apparently the rent was raised and the 
 lease was not renewed. It will be interesting to see what new business 
 occupies that valuable shopping mall real estate.
 
 And the Winner is : 
 With so much gloom&amp;doom of late, I am happy to finally report some 
 good news: Harbor 
 Restaurant won Wine Spectator Magazine&apos;s Award of 
 Excellence for the fifth consecutive year for their wine lists. That&apos;s a 
 big deal and our friends out on Stearns Wharf deserve a hearty 
 congratulations! 

 As If You Care: Speaking of Stearns Wharf, did you know that SantaBarbara.com 
 (aka John) runs a live web 
 cam in the Ty Warner Sea Center ? I bought the best web camera money 
 can buy, so please do me a favor and give it a spin! It is live 24 hours 
 per day and requires a fairly good speed Internet connection. From the 
 comfort of your own web browser, you can turn the camera in any 
 direction, zoom around the room and follow sea life as they traverse 
 their world. One of my favorite pastimes is to watch the nearby octopus 
 repeatedly launch sneak attacks on the rocks in her tank. She never 
 seems to get tired of it and is having more fun than octopi should be 
 allowed to have. FYI, if you all try to spin/zoom the camera at once, 
 you will get into a tug-of-war, so be patient and go write some 
 restaurant reviews while you wait!

 Don&apos;t Touch That Dial : 
 I have been invited to be a radio guest on the Business and Technology 
 show, hosted by Wayne B. Norris on Monday, February 5th from 2pm-3pm on AM 1290 . 
 Part of the interview will be about the SantaBarbara.com Restaurant 
 Guide . Chad Stevens, owner of Chad&apos;s Restaurant will also be a guest on the show to give his perspective. I&apos;ll also be 
 talking about my recent experience as the&quot;Wrong Number&quot;Santa Claus 
 that made national headlines in December (see Jan 4th column below). 

Ye Olde Deli : Reader Dan tells me that Ye Olde Butcher Shop on upper State Street is no longer a butcher shop. They are now 
 exclusively a deli. Dan noted that square footage of the Butcher Shoppe 
 is pretty huge for just a deli and wondered if they will be staying at 
 that location for much longer. Their sandwiches are some of the best in 
 town, so lets hope they continue to feed us for a long time! 
 
 New Chef at Zaffiro : Amy 
 McNelis has been named chef at Zaffiro . 
 McNelis joins a talented team at Zaffiro (sapphire in Italian), a 
 popular 400 seat Italian restaurant that recently changed its name from 
 Pascucci at Camino Real Marketplace. The restaurant&apos;s new name completes 
 an organizational change that has taken place over the past year. In 
 2004, McNelis was named Chef Instructor, and later promoted to Chef 
 Instructor and Cafe Manager at California School of Culinary Arts, Le 
 Cordon Bleu Program.&quot;Teaching at Cordon Bleu was a rewarding experience 
 and will help me in my new position at Zaffiro,&quot;said McNelis.&quot;We will 
 prepare exceptional food at reasonable prices, continue to use local 
 vendors and take advantage of the local product. I&apos;m looking forward to 
 adding my own brand of polish to this sapphire.&quot;

 A Side of Salsa : Arnoldi&apos;s Cafe now offers Salsa dancing on Tuesdays at 9:30pm. If you arrive at 8:30pm 
 there is a Salsa lesson for $5.

 Excellent Meal of the Day : [Crackwich Alert] Dargan&apos;s Irish 
 Pub on Ortega St makes the best Reuben sandwich in 
 town. Or perhaps on Earth. A Reuben sandwich is a grilled or toasted 
 sandwich made with corned beef, sauerkraut, Swiss cheese, and either 
 Russian dressing or Thousand Island dressing. It is typically made with 
 rye bread. Dargan&apos;s offers it with a side of fries or salad. I like to 
 show up at about 8:30pm at Dargan&apos;s and eat a Reuben while waiting for a 
 pool table. A round of billiards makes the perfect dessert for this 
 tasty meal. This sandwich 
 receives our coveted Crackwich award for it&apos;s lethally addicting qualities! Tell &apos;em SantaBarbara.com sent you.

 Cellicious : On 
 Saturday night a fine young lady joined me for a tasty dinner at 
 ever-popular Arigato Sushi . When at a sushi bar, one would think that 
 chopsticks would be the most important dining accessory. To my surprise, 
 the most important dining accessory this evening was a cell phone . Upon our arrival, my lady and I were told there would be a 20 minute 
 wait. Arigato offers to call your cell phone when your table is ready, 
 which allows you to wander State Street as you wait. This is really great and more restaurants should offer this. The cell phone also came 
 in handy when it was time to order. The last time I was here (New Years 
 Eve 2005), the food was so incredible, I wrote a review of Arigato and listed everything I ate. Tonight, however, I couldn&apos;t for 
 the life of me remember what I had ordered 377 days ago. So, I quietly 
 pulled out my cell, surfed the web to my review and read the order from 
 my phone to our surprised waitress. FYI, we ordered Arigato Roll, Tiger 
 Roll, Jalapeno Yellowtail, Seared Salmon&amp;Mango Ahi.

 AKA Dentist Drive : While 
 waiting for our table at Arigato, my date and I braved the freezing cold 
 and wandered State Street, going into every nearby open store, not 
 because they had interesting things to buy, but because they were warm . As luck would have it, I spotted a new dessert location to 
 add to this restaurant guide. Sweet Alley sells ice cream, homemade fudge, caramel apples, 21 colors of M&amp;M&apos;s, 
 bulk candy and many other sweet treats. They have a Birthday Menu: you 
 provide the birthday child and their friends, and Sweet Ally provides 
 entertainment, decorations and invitations. It is a small shop (hard to 
 see if you are not looking for it) just above Figueroa.

 Fire&amp;Ice : Speaking of 
 dessert locations, the Rite Aid ice cream monopoly on mid-downtown State Street has ended. Northstar Coffee now sells gelato in addition to their fine, hot, frothy java. But I have 
 a feeling that the board of directors at Rite Aid won&apos;t be calling an 
 emergency meeting any time soon. Rite Aid sells a single scoop for 99 
 cents, while a lone scoop of the new gelato at Northstar Coffee goes for 
 $2.75.

 Stay Tuned : Michelle 
 Mastrangelo of Epiphany Restaurant tells me that on Wednesday, January 
 17th, Epiphany will be featured on the reality TV show&quot;Top Chef&quot;on 
 Bravo at 10pm. See BravoTV.com for details. Congratulations Epiphany!!! 

 As If You Care : The 
 iron grill on my relatively new Weber barbeque disintegrated after less 
 than four years. And I kept a protective cover always on the BBQ! When I 
 pulled the grill out of the BBQ this weekend, it broke into pieces 
 of rust . Half the chunks were in my hand and the other half fell 
 into the BBQ. I highly recommend you avoid iron BBQ grills. Oiling them 
 regularly (as the directions say to do) doesn&apos;t help, in my opinion. I 
 have now switched to stainless steel. I&apos;ll update you in 2011.

 Best Of times, worst of times : 
 Reader Youni recently asked me what happened to the Best Of page in the 
 restaurant guide. Excellent question! This popular page had been online 
 since 2000, displaying a list of the names of winning restaurants from 
 the annual Santa Barbara Independent Reader&apos;s Poll. Last October, Randy 
 Campbell, president and Publisher of the Independent contacted me and 
 asked me to remove this content from my restaurant guide. Now, before 
 you slap a Darth Vader helmet on Mr. Campbell, keep in mind that I 
 completely agreed with his reasoning. He was very nice and professional 
 about the whole thing and we had an enjoyable conversation, of which the 
 poll was only part of it. Soon thereafter, I started a new annual 
 restaurant poll called the SantaBarbara.com Survey . The poll 
 ran from November 15, 2006 until the end of the year. I was stunned by 
 how many people filled out the survey (thanks everyone!). I hope to have 
 the results of the SantaBarbara.com Survey online in about a week.

 I Love Barney : Speaking of 
 the Santa Barbara Independent, I swapped emails with Independent 
 columnist Barney Brantingham last night. We discussed the demise of DogHouse and the rise of Mad Dogs . 
 Be sure to read Mr. Brantingham&apos;s column On The Beat for 
 details about that story.

 Cheers : Last night I went 
 to Island Brewery in Carpinteria. A popular Carpinteria band, The 
 Brewery Boys, practices at Island Brewery on Thursday nights and I 
 occasionally come in to watch them rehearse. The place is really fun and 
 I recommend you stop by some Thursday evening. While there, I found out 
 that Sushi Teri is opening the The Goodluck Bar inside Sushi Teri - Carpinteria on January 22, 2007. They will be serving premium sakes, gold flake 
 sake, soju cocktails, Japanese and US beers, champagne, and California 
 wine - all to compliment the sushi. See thegoodluckbar.com for details.

 Excellent Meal of the Day : [Crackwich Alert] You must try the Hot Mushroom Combo sandwich at Fresco! . It comes with caramelized onions and I eat this 
 meal nearly every time I have lunch there. When the cashier asks you 
 what you want on the side, be sure to ask for the mixed greens salad. 
 The salad dressing they use is unbelievably delicious. Fresco has been 
 one of the most popular restaurants in town for over 10 years, and last 
 year opened the high-end Fresco by the 
 Beach . This sandwich receives our 
 coveted Crackwich award for it&apos;s lethally addicting qualities! Tell 
 &apos;em SantaBarbara.com sent you.

 Fast Food Trivia of the Day : 
 Did you know that you cannot order a double-hamburger at McDonald&apos;s? 
 With the billions of burgers sold each year, you would think this would 
 be an option. Well, it&apos;s not. I was starving and in a hurry the other 
 day and whipped into McDonald&apos;s at Camino 
 Real Marketplace and ordered one. There was a moment of 
 indecision and then the cashier figured out how to fulfill my order. She 
 put in an order for a double-cheese burger with no cheese . It 
 seems THAT was on the menu, but a double-hamburger is nowhere to be 
 found. Sure enough, a burger soon appeared, tucked in their standard 
 cheeseburger wrapping paper. On top was a green sticker attaching a 
 special note that said NO CHEESE.

 Excellent Meal of the Day : 
 If you want a killer little dish for lunch, try the Shrimp Alambre at 
 Mexican restaurant Del Pueblo Cafe in Goleta. Order it without rice&amp;beans so you don&apos;t go to sleep when 
 you return home or to work. It costs about $10 and you should request 
 limes with it. If possible, arrive a little before or after the lunch 
 hour so you can get an outdoor table in the sun. Indoors can be a bit 
 noisy. I have been coming here for years and order the exact same thing 
 every time. It is my favorite Mexican dish in town. Tell &apos;em 
 SantaBarbara.com sent you.

 The Cows and The Bees : I 
 went restaurant stalking last night and found my latest victim: Milk&amp;Honey . 
 They serve Tapas and their menu looks outstanding. The ambiance is just 
 right. This is no surprise because Milk&amp;Honey is brought to you by the 
 same people who run Alcazar on 
 the Mesa. I took some pictures, gathered info and added them to the 
 guide today. They had their grand opening about three weeks ago.

 Let The Cat In : Reader 
 Jonathan Lipsitz emailed me today to let me know that The Hungry 
 Cat restaurant will be opening this Winter at 1134 Chapala St, 
 the former home of JoJo&apos;s and L&apos;Ombretta . 
 Jonathan also put in a suggestion for the restaurant guide. He thinks it 
 would be cool to list the average rating score of each restaurant next 
 to their name in the cuisine lists. Anything that helps out you hungry 
 Santa Barbarians, I shall do. I am here to serve you. Would you like 
 fries with that?

 As If You Care : As 
 mentioned yesterday, I met and interviewed The Early Show&apos;s Matt 
 McAllister&amp;Joe Wallace today at KTYD headquarters. What a cool set of 
 dudes. Matt has been running The Early Show for eight years after 
 transplanting from San Diego. I also was told that Rincon Broadcasting 
 just bought KTYD (and other local stations) from Clear Channel and 
 nothing should change. Long live The Early Show!

 I&apos;ll Be Back : In many states, they 
 ban drivers who talk on cell phones. They should also ban drivers who 
 own restaurant guides. I do serious rubber-necking as I drive, carefully 
 looking at every building on both sides of the street (imagine Arnold 
 Schwarzenegger in the Terminator scanning for Sarah Connor), 
 hoping to spot a new restaurant or perhaps a closed restaurant.

 Adios : I was rubber-necking 
 my way up Milpas street around 2pm this afternoon and sadly noticed that Julian&apos;s Mexican Cafe is out-of-business. Fortunately, Santa Barbara has a lot of Mexican 
 restaurants that can serve as emergency backup.

 Paper or Plastic : While on 
 Milpas I finally added Trader Joes - Milpas and Chapala 
 Market to the new Markets section of this restaurant guide.

 Area 51 : Because I was in 
 the Milpas area, I decided to look at the DogHouse to 
 see what all the confusion is about. Indeed, it doesn&apos;t LOOK like they 
 are out of business. Even the umbrellas are still up. For the casual 
 observer, it looks like they just decided to not open any more, and left 
 everything in place. Or perhaps they were terminated . Someone should call the X-Files and have them come take 
 a look.

 We Miss You Julia : Being 
 quite hungry, I thought I would stop for a bite at La Super Rica . 
 I seriously love their alambres. Unfortunately they are closed on 
 Wednesdays. Closing La Super Rica on ANY day of the week should be 
 banned. Perhaps Mayor Blum could help pass a new law, forcing them to 
 stay open 24/7?

 Shop TJ&apos;s : Heading back 
 home, I also added Trader Joes on Calle 
 Real to the restaurant guide. With luck, I will add Trader Joes on De La Vina and Montecito Grocery tomorrow. I am trying to include only the larger markets (and any market 
 at UCSB) because there are zillions of mini-markets in SB that would 
 take a lifetime to hunt down. Besides, this is a restaurant guide and I 
 shouldn&apos;t be adding markets in the first place. Somebody stop me!

 Sayonara : Observant reader Steve Weixel noticed an out-of-business sign on the front door of Taiko sushi that read:&quot;Dear Friends, Unfortunately Taiko Santa Barbara has 
 shut its doors permanently. We thank you for your patronage and wish you 
 the best for 2007. Taiko Brentwood and El Segundo are open.&quot;

 As If You Care : Tomorrow 
 morning I am interviewing Matt McAllister and Joe Wallace of KTYD&apos;s The 
 Early Show . I am gathering information for a possible 
 book about my Santa experience (see Jan 4 blog entry below). Matt&amp;Joe 
 were the first people to let me know that word had leaked to the media 
 about the fact that kids were calling my phone number by mistake, 
 thinking I was Santa Claus.

 Dog Gone : It appears that the DogHouse restaurant on Milpas St is out of business. The location has been closed 
 for weeks and now reader Dave Medina tells me their telephone number has 
 been disconnected.

 Let Them Eat Cake : Reader Steve Weixel informs me that a bakery named Crumbs is opening at 5392 Hollister Ave in Goleta, the former location of Cafe Sonrisas .

 Ready When You Are : I drove 
 by the future home of Panino Goleta at 5666 Calle Real 
 and the windows are still papered over. It doesn&apos;t appear that it will 
 be open for awhile yet. I also cruised by the new Milk&amp;Honey restaurant on Anapamu on Monday afternoon to take some pics and gather 
 information but they were not open. I&apos;ll try again this evening. Milk&amp;Honey is owned by the same people who bring you Alcazar Restaurant on the Mesa.

 Early Alzheimer&apos;s : I 
 finally ate at Dish Cafe on Calle Real in Goleta and was extremely impressed. Each person in our 
 party ordered delicious and unique meals that I had never seen served in 
 a local restaurant. My memory fails me as to exactly what the items were 
 (we ate their a few weeks ago) but the great impression they left with 
 me is abundantly clear.

 Quiet on the Set : Speaking 
 of Restaurant of the Month, Spirtland Bistro , 
 is hosting a Santa Barbara Young Professionals Club meeting on January 
 17th. Guest speaker will be Roger Durling, executive director of the 
 Santa Barbara International Film Festival. See sbypc.org for details.

 Three&apos;s Company : The owners 
 of Sushi Teri 
 Goleta , Sushi Teri Santa Barbara and Sushi Teri Carpinteria contacted me and have requested a free control panel account. This means 
 you will be able to read more information about their restaurants and 
 potentially see responses to reviews. Welcome aboard Sushi Teri!

 As If You Care : Last 
 weekend I went to my first masquerade ball and it was fantastic. Local 
 entrepreneur Justin Michael has started a business called Mazque 
 (mazque.com) and throws these social gatherings at the rooftop of Hotel 
 Andalucia. You can buy/rent a mask or complete outfit at Victoria Vogue 
 on State Street. A portion of the proceeds of every event are donated to 
 a charity of Justin Michael and Brianna Winn&apos;s choosing, Brianna being 
 full co-founder. This masquerade party was a benefit for Santa Barbara 
 Middle School. Lots of fun and interesting people were there and several 
 members of the media roved the floor taking pictures. And, of course, 
 the ubiquitous John Palminteri was there, and he was nice enough to 
 approach me and thank me for playing Santa Claus (see below) last month.

 Happy New Year!

 A Late Christmas Gift: Reader and friend Melissa Mellot tells me that there is a new place on 
 Anapamu called Milk&amp;Honey that I need to go check out. Also, I heard rumors that Panino is 
 opening soon in Goleta and that Coffee Bean might open near the Granada on State St, where the Santa Barbara Sandwich 
 Company used to be.

 Santa Claus Is Coming To Town : 
 Usually I spend about four hours or more a day working on this 
 restaurant guide. That work might include driving to new restaurants to 
 gather information, sifting through incoming restaurant reviews or 
 perhaps going&quot;cruising&quot;where I drive around looking to see if there is 
 an existing dining establishment that I have missed.

A funny thing happened last month, however, that brought my daily 
 routine to a screeching halt.

In early December I started getting phone calls from children who wanted 
 to give their Christmas wish list to Santa Claus. Santa Claus? Let me 
 explain. In November I launched a phone number for this web site 
 1-800-SantaBarbara and it turns out that it is one digit off from 
 1-800-SantaClaus. Kids from all over the country were misdialing and reaching me by mistake . This was not a problem for me. In 
 fact I loved taking the calls from kids. I didn&apos;t promise them that they 
 would receive the toys (&quot;you have to ask your mommy first!&quot;) but I did 
 play along and become Santa. This was going on for a couple of weeks and 
 the number of calls increased every day. One day my mom suggested I tell 
 my little Santa story to the News-Press. I was interviewed by Kimberly 
 Pohas at the News-Press, but never expected it would make the paper . 

What happened after that is pretty much unbelievable.

I woke up the next morning from a call from Matt McAllister of the Early 
 Show on KTYD asking for a live interview about the Santa story (I guess 
 it made the paper!) That was followed by a visit from three local TV 
 stations. Next, radio stations from around the country started calling. 
 My Santa story then made the Associated Press and was published in 
 papers all over the country. Finally, the major cable news networks 
 started running the story hour on the hour. I then was ask to do live 
 interviews on NBC News, Fox News Channel and CNN. CNN even brought their satellite truck to my home and did a live broadcast from my living room 
 on Christmas Eve. Meanwhile the calls increase to 100 per day then to 
 100 per hour when kids started calling my number directly to speak to 
 Santa Claus. I loved getting the calls and would talk to 
 children from the moment I woke up, until the moment I went to bed. I&apos;m 
 still not sure why the story got as much attention as it did, but it was 
 fun to be part of it.

 

I have made a web page with pictures, movies and audio files from the whole experience.
