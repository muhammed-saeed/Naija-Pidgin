PREFACE. 



The Spelling-book ought to occupy a place in primary instruc- 
tion second in importance to that of no other work. We have 
aimed, therefore, in the preparation of this volume, to furnish all 
the facilities necessary to teach successfully the orthography, pro- 
nunciation, meaning, and use of the more important words of the 
English language. 

It is now generally conceded, by eminent American and Euro- 
pean educators, that the shortest and most successful mode of learn- 
ing spelling is by the eye ; that the definitions and the use of words, 
as well as their orthography, are soonest acquired by frequently 
writing exercises from dictation; and that orthoepy and orthog- 
raphy should be simultaneously taught. This book has been pre- 
pared in accordance with these views. 

In Part First, containing monosyllables only, the pupil is taught 
to observe the construction of words, and to form them by prefix- 
ing and affixing single letters. The lessons are presented in the 
following order : Words of one letter ; words of two letters, formed 
first by prefixing, and secondly by affixing, a single letter to words 
of one letter; then follow words of two letters only, not thus 
formed. This principle is then extended to words of three, four, 
and more letters. Thus, for example, by affixing n to the word #, 
we have an; by affixing d to an, it becomes and; by prefixing I to 
and, it becomes land ; and lastly, by prefixing 5, it becomes bland. 
The words are arranged with regard to their vowel sounds, in al- 
phabetical order; and, though they appear in columns, they are 
divided into paragraphs, and designed to be read from left to right, 
as in ordinary reading. 

Part Second contains words of more than one syllable, classified 
with regard to their formation, their vowel sounds, alphabetic 
order, accent, and number of syllables. The following miscellane- 
ous exercises are then introduced: Words pronounced alike, but 
differing in spelling and signification; words improperly used for 
each other; effect of accent in certain words ; rules for spelling; 
rules for the use of capital letters; marks used in written lan- 
guage; names of persons; prefixes, their meaning and effect; 
prepositions used after certain words; abbreviations; and words, 
phrases, and expressions in common use, borrowed from other lan- 
guages. Due discrimination should be used in determining at what

PREFACE. 

stage of tlie pupil&apos;s progress to teach the miscellaneous exercises, as 
well as the orthoepical principles and exercises in the first part of 
the book. 

We have given unusual prominence to pronunciation, not only 
from the consideration that, if neglected in youth, it will rarely, if 
ever, be learned, but because, in its acquisition, the form of words 
is so impressed upon the mind, that it serves as an important aux- 
iliary in teaching orthography. The system of classification is so 
complete, that a single word serves as a key to the pronunciation 
and spelling of an entire class. By the use of numbered vowels 
and consonants with peculiar marks, a list of which will be found 
on each leaf, we have been enabled to indicate the pronunciation 
of every word, with the necessity of respelling but few ; and, in 
their syllabication, to exhibit their rrots, prefixes, and affixes. 

Great pains have been taken throughout the work so to prepare 
the Dictation Exercises- as to familiarize the pupil with the best 
forms of constructing sentences ; to teach the meaning and use of 
the important words; and to illustrate the rules of spelling, the 
use of capital letters, punctuation, abbreviations,&amp;c. These exer- 
cises may be used in various ways. The teacher may read the sen- 
tences slowly and distinctly, while the pupils write all the words, 
or the more difficult ones only. When slates are used, they may be 
expeditiously examined by requiring pupils to exchange, so that each 
one shall become the inspector of his neighbor&apos;s work, while the 
teacher spells the several words. All mistakes should be corrected 
by the pupil who made them. 

It will be seen, from the explanation of our plan, that this book 
is adapted to the wants of all classes of pupils, without regard to 
the mode of instruction. Teachers may resort to oral spelling 
only ; to spelling both by oral and dictation exercises, which i» 
preferable; or, in advanced classes, dictation exercises only may be 
used. Pupils, however, should always be required to study the 
lists of words, and to pronounce them in the class, before attempt- 
ing to spell, or to read and write the dictation exercises. This will 
also be found a valuable work, if used only to teach orthoepy. In 
that case pupils should be required to study the lists of words, and 
to pronounce them in the class; after which, the reading of the 
dictation exercises will serve as a test and confirmation of their 
pronunciation. 

Du. Webster&apos;s Dictionary, as revised by Prof. 0. A. Good- 
rich, D. D., in 1856, has been adopted as our standard of orthog- 
raphy. This work has also been our principal authority on the 
subject of pronunciation; though, in disputed cases, we have con- 
stantly consulted Dr. Worcester&apos;s Dictionary, and the works ot 
B. II. Smart, Esq., the veteran orthoepist of England. 



ORTHOGRAPHY. 



Definitions. 

1. Orthography treats of the nature and properties 
of letters, and the correct spelling or writing of words. 

2. The English Language consists of forty-three Oral 
Elements, or Elementary Sounds. 

3. Oral Elements are the sounds that, uttered sep- 
arately or in combination, form syllables and words. 

4. Elements are produced by different positions of 
the organs of speech, in connection with the voice and 
the breath. 

5. The Principal Organs of Speech are the lips, 
teeth, tongue, and palate. 

G. Voice is produced by the action of the breath 
upon the larynx. 1 

7. Elements are divided into three classes : eighteen 
Tonics, fifteen Subtonics, and ten Atonies. 

8. Tonics are pure tones produced by the voice, with 
but slight use of the organs of speech. 

9. Subtonics are tones produced by the voice, modi- 
fied by the organs of speech. 

10. Atonics are mere breathings, modified by the or-* 
gans of speech. , 

11. Letters are characters that are used to represent 
the Oral elements. 

12. The English Alphabet consists of twenty-six let- 
ters, viz. : a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, 1, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, 
t, u, v, w, x, y, z. 

» The larynx is the upper part of the trachea, or windpipe. 



ft ; NATIONAL PRONOUNCING SPELLER. 



13. The Alphabet is divided into Vowels and Conso* 
nants. 

14. Vowels are the letters that usually represent the 
Tonic elements, and form syllables by themselves. They 
are a, e, i, 0, u 9 and sometimes y. 

15. A Diphthong is the union of two vowels in one 
syllable ; as, oi in 0*1, ou in our. 

16. A Digraph, or improper diphthong, is the union 
of two vowels in a syllable, one of which is silent ; as, 
oa in loaf. 

IT. A Triphthong is the union of three vowels in one 
syllable ; as, eau in beau, ieu in adieu. 

18. Consonants are the letters that usually represent 
either Sub tonic or Atonic elements. They are of two 
kinds, single letters and combined, viz. : b, c, d, f, g, h, 
j, k, 1, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, v, w, x, y, z; 6a Subtonic, th 
Atonic, ch, sh, wh, ng. 

The term Consonant, literally meaning sounding with, is applied to these 
letters because they are rarely used in words without having a vowel 
connected with them in the same syllable, although their elements may 
be uttered separately, and without the aid of a vowel. 

19. Cognates are letters whose elements are produced 
by the same organs, in a similar manner; thus,/* is a 
cognate of v / h of g,&amp;c. 

20. Alphabetic Equivalents are letters, or combina- 
tions of letters, that represent similar elements, or sounds ; 
thus, i is an equivalent of 0, in p^&apos;que. 

Vowels. 

A usually represents six Oral elements, or sounds ; as 
in ale, and, art, all, bare, ask. 

E usually represents three elements ; as in me, end, 
err. 

The element indicated by e 1 , is also represented by t, o, u, and y ; as 
in mt&apos;rth, word, fur, myrrh. 

/usually represents two elements ; as in ice, inch. 



CONSONANTS. 9 

O usually represents three elements ; as In old, on, do. 
IT usually represents three dements ; as in tube, tub, 

mil. 

T&quot;, when used as a vowel, represents the same elements 
as // as in type (tip), hymn (him). 

U usually represents one element ; as in our. This 
element is also represented by ow / as in now. 

01 and OY are equivalent to a, followed by ! ; as in 
oil (ail), hoy (Mi). 

Consonants. 

B represents one element; as in bih. Before t, and 
after m, it is silent ; as in de£t, tlmmJ. 

C has no element peculiar to itself. It represents the 
sound of k before the letters a, c, «, Z,&gt;,&lt;£, and at the 
end of a word, when, in this work, it is printed with a 
dot over it ; as in cane, cot, cure, click, crank, district, 
music. Before e, i, and ?/, it represents the sound of s / 
as in cent, ^ider, cyst. In a few words, it has the sound 
of z / as in suffice. When it comes after the accent, and is 
followed by ea, ia, io, or eons, it is sounded like sh / as 
in ocean, social, tenacious, cetaceous. It is silent before 
k / as in hack, lack. 

D usually represents one element ; as in did. At the 
end of a word, it is sometimes sounded like t, as in 
mixed/ and in a few words is silent, as in se^ge, he^ge. 

^represents one element, as in fife \ except in of, 
when it is sounded like v. 

G usually represents one element ; as in gag. Before 
€, i % and y y it is usually sounded like jf, and is marked 
thus, g ; as in gem, gin, gyve. j 

H represents one element ; as in Aome. It is silent at 
the beginning of a number of words, and after r and g / 
as in Aonor, rAyme, gAost. 

J represents one element; as in^&apos;ust 

K represents one element ; as in lank. It is silent 
before n / as in knee, 



10 NATIONAL PRONOUNCING SPELLER. 

L represents one element ; as in ZiZac. It is silent in 
many words ; as caZf, haZf, taZk. 

M represents one element ; as in maim. 

^represents one element; as in no, on. It is some- 
times sounded like ng, when, in tins work, it is marked 
thus, n ; as in bank, thank, an&apos;ger, fin&apos;ger. It is silent 
after Z, or m, when it ends a syllable ; as in kiln, hymnt, 

P represents one element ; as in pipe. It is silent) 
before n, s, and t, in the same syllable ; as in pneumatic, 
^&gt;salm, prompt. 

Q has no element peculiar to itself. &quot;With u, by which 
it is always followed, it commonly represents the sound 
of Jew, as in&lt;^aif, quilt, quoth ; but in many words 
derived from the French, it has the sound of Jc ; as in 
coquet, eti^uet,&amp;c. 

R represents one element ; as in rare, for. &quot;When it 
precedes a vowel, it may be trilled ; as in roll, round. 

S usually represents one element ; as in save, same. 
In many words it is sounded like z as heard in sine, 
when, in this work, it is marked thus, s ; as in rose, rise. 
In a few instances it has the sound of z, as heard in 
azure ; as in pleasure, osier. It sometimes represents 
the sound of sh J as in sure, diversion. 

T represents one element ; as in tart, taste. 
V represents one element ; as in valve, -vryid. 
W represents one element; as in well, wise. 

X has no element peculiar to itself. It is equivalent 
to z, at ihe beginning of words ; to Jcs, as in ta#, ea?pect; 
to gz, when the next syllable following begins with an 
accented vowel, as in e#alt, exert ;♦ and to Jcsh, in some 
words, when the accent immediately precedes it, as in 
anxious, luxury. 

Y, when a consonant, represents one element ; as in 
yet, yes. 

Z represents two elements. The first may be heard in 
sest, sine. The second, in this work, is marked thus, z ; 
as in azure. 



TABLE OF OKAL ELEMENTS. 11 

Til represents two elements. When a Subtonic, in 
this work, it is marked thus, fh ; as in this, with. As 
an Atonic, it is heard in thin, breath. 

Oil usually represents one element ; as in change, 
much. In words derived from the ancient languages, 
ch is generally sounded like h / as in ache, cAasm, scAool. 
It frequently represents the sound of sh, when, in this 
work, it is marked thus, en ; as in eriaise, cTiivalry,, 
mac-hine. 

SII represents one element; as in shame, marsh. 

WH represents one element ; as in wha\, when, w?Aip.

1 First require the pupils to utter an clement by itself, then to pro- 
nounce distinctly the words that follow, uttering the element after each 
word — thus : age, a ; ate, a ; bane, a,&amp;c. Exercise the class upon the 
above table, till each pupil can utter consecutively all the Oral elements. 
The attention of the class should be called to the fact that the first 
element, or sound, represented by each of the vowels, is usually indi- 
cated by a horizontal line placed over the letter, and the second sound 
by a curved line. 

2 The fifth element, or sound, represented by a, is its first or Alphabetic 
sound, modified or softened by r. 

3 The sixth element represented by a, is a sound intermediate between 
a, as heard in at, ash, and a, as in arm, art. 

4 The third element represented by e, is e as heard in end, modified or 
softened by r. It is also represented by i, o, u, and y ; as in bird, word, 
burn, myrrh.

Words. 

A word is one or more Oral elements or letters used 
to represent an idea. 

Words are divided into primitive, derivative, simple, 
and compound. 

A primitive word is not derived, but constitutes a root 
from which other words are formed ; as faith, love, ease. 

A derivative word is one that is formed of a primi- 
tive, by the addition of an affix or prefix ; as faithful, 
lovely, disease. 

A simple word is one that can not be divided without 
destroying the sense ; as an, the, book. 

A compound word is formed by two or more words ; 
as inkstand, bookbinder, laughing-stock. 

Syllables. 

A Syllable is a word, or part of a word, uttered 
by a single impulse of the voice. 

A Monosyllable is a word of one syllable; as 
home. 



16 NATIONAL PRONOUN-CINQ SPELLER. 

A Dissyllable is a word of two syllables ; as home-hss. 

A Trisyllable is a word of three syllables ; as con- 
fine-ment. 

A Polysyllable is a word of four or more syllables ; 
as in-no-cen-cy^ un-in-tel-li-gi-Ml-i-ty. 

The Ultimate is the last syllable of a word ; as/W, in 

The Penult, or penultimate, is the last syllable but 
one of a word ; as mdk, in peace-m#&amp;-er. 

The Antepenult, or antepenultimate, is the last syl- 
lable but two of a word ; a&amp;jpeace, injpeace-mak-er. 

Accent. 

Accent is the peculiar force given&apos; to one or more 
syllables of a word. 

A mark like this &apos; is often used to show which syl- 
lable is accented ; as read&apos; ing, eat&apos; ing, re ward&apos;, com- 
pel&apos;, mis&apos; chiev ous, vi o lin&apos;, fire&apos;-eat&apos;er. 

In many trisyllables and polysyllables, of two syllables 
accented, one is uttered with greater force than the other. 
The more forcible accent is called p?*imary, and the less 
forcible, secondary. 

A mark like this is sometimes used to indicate sec- 
ondary accent ; as, ed N u ca&apos; tion, ed&apos; u cat© , muT ti pli- 
ca&apos; tion.

3. If you can reach the sheath, sheafhe the dirk. If 
the boy sneak, and shed tears, and scream, do not smear 
his coat, tweak his nose, nor tease him, but treat him 
well. He left his spear by a sheaf of wheat near the 
stream. Hand the shears to the weak girl, and teach 
her to weave wreaths. 

4. Three sleek beeves stand by the creek near the 
green beech. Shear a&apos; fleece from the sheep, with the 
steel shears. Did the queer owl screech ? She will hold

off the sleet. If a breeze sweep by, the men will 
cheer, and make speed to turn the wheel, and steer the

leading and Dictation Exercises, 

1. Take a bench, and play a game of chess on the 
chest. If the guest come in quest of you, bless him, 
and give back the pence. He crept in the dense wood, 
up to the crest of the ledge. Fetch the dress to the 
hedge, press it into the stream to a great depth, and when 
you drench it well, bear it hence to the fence where you 
dwell. 

2. Leave the stench, and smell the sweet scent. Put 
the wedge, the shell, and the sketch, on the shelf. This is 
the twelfth smelt I have caught, and that is your tenth. 
In full strength, the wind swept the wreck, and left not a 
shred. If he have sense, they can not tempt him to 
wrest or wrench the sledge from the wretch. 

3. Dread not the threat, for you have health and 
wealth. I dreamt that each breath of wind spread death 
in that realm. My guest said that his friend meant to

1. Do not chide nor fright the blind child. Did the 
blithe bride bribe the knight to fight ? Do not climb 
that tree in the night, for if you let go your gripe you 
might fall. If the bright moon give light, drive with 
care in your flight. 

2. You are quite right, the ninth snipe is a prime

a spike into the spile, or splice it. Do not smile, if the 
scribe kneel at the shrine. Do not smite the lad on the 
spine, for spite. 

3. Twice or thrice, while in the strife, did the squire 
stride by. Do not strike that poor wight on his thigh. 
&quot;Write to the wright to come and see that rite of the

drove off all the cows. &quot;Will the gross drone go forth 
and grope for gold % 

2. If the stove did smoke, I know that she smote the

of those shotes. 

3. I am loath to broach the fourth cask of ale, for it 
doth bloat my friends. Pin the coarse cloak with my 
broach, so that you may keep your throat warm, and 
not be hoarse. Roast a roach, and toast some bread, for 
tea. Do not throw the gourd on the floor. The course 
that he took, when he rode in his coach to court, is 
known. I shall loathe you, if you boast that your board 
is cheap, though you hoard much gold.

Awake, and engage a clerk to replace and arrange the brocade. 
Unlace your vest, and inhale the vapor from the cascade. Forsake

derange nor misplace the things. Do not let the grimace of the in- 
sane man enrage you ; but if he escape, aid to retake him. 

4. The plaintiff daily sent the bailiff to take the caitiff. I plainly 
heard the plaintive moan of the traitor. The painter drew a cut 
of a railroad, a prairie, and a daisy. The dainty gaiter was pain-

for he had his waistcoat and waistband wet each rainy day. 

5. I am afraid, if I do not constrain him to acquaint his wife

not stay away from the affray. Did the wayward player waylay 
the mayor by daylight?

Dictation Exercises. 



1. Was he angry at the absence of the agile boy? He is absent 
from the alley. Alum is acrid. This man is an arrant anarch. 
Make a bannock of the batter. The blanket and arras are for my 
bed. Can the athlete walk as fast as the horse can amble? In the 
barrack, I saw an anchor, an axle, an anvil, a balance, and a box of 
blacking. The barrel of brandy fell on my leg, and hurt my ankle 
badly. The Baptist wrote a ballad on baptism. An adder lay in 
ambush, with a keen aspect, and made me shake like an aspen, for 
fear he would give battle. 

2. The captain ate a carrot, a cabbage, and some candy, in the 
cabin. The chaplain left the chapel in his cassock, and sat on a 
cannon in the cavern, to read a chapter. His teeth clatter with 
cold, though he is clad in warm flannel. Do not famish the cham- 
ois, and my cattle. If he drink claret, I fancy he can do no dam- 
age with that fragile dagger. 

3. If you see the gallant captain lashing his horse into a gallop, 
you may gather near ; but, in your gladness, do not gabble. Not a 
thing is lacking to fill the landscape with grandeur. My grandsire, 
having a javelin and halberd, made great havoc. My grandson 
went gladly up into the garret, in the granite house, to learn his 
grammar. The lackey left a jacket, handcuff, and lantern, on my 
hammock. 

4. The ragged, mammoth madman, in his ramble, did madly ran- 
sack each pantry in the parish. I would rather meet a panther in 
the passage, than try to manage his madness. I saw, on the platter, 
some marrow, a radish, a mango, and a napkin. 

5. The saddler says that the saddle is now of no value, for it was 
sadly torn by that thankless savage. Be thankful if you get some 
salad and a sandwich in that shanty. Do not shatter that statue near 
the stanchion. Will you traverse the sea in a shallop, or travel in 
la wagon ? 

6. Adapt the cravat to the boy&apos;s use, and attach it to his neck. 
Dispatch some one for the ratan, and abash the cabal ; for, if the 
boys do not decamp, they may attack you. That mishap in the 
morass, near the canal, was much like a romance.

1. The alder grows near the water. She almost always puts all- 
spice into her cake. Have you a rich baldrick in your wardrobe? 
Though men are swarming to that quarter, he will not falter, nor 
palter. I will warrant that the calker will have to pay wharfage 
for his caldron. The swarthy, warlike talker was talking of war-

that he must alter its place, while the church was warming.

3. Do you applaud the author because he has auburn hair, or for

They defraud, assault, and slaughter strangers.

dormant dormouse and tortoise are in a torpid state. Did yon 
say that sordid scorner has a morbid mind ? One stormy morn- 
ing, a forward corsair blew his cornet, by the northern corner of

3. When the weary seaman, on the dreary deep, sees a beacon 
gleaming on the seashore, he is eager for the seaside. If the dealer 
did get some treacle in that greasy beaker, he has no regard for 
cleanness. Can an eagle kill a weasel, a beaver, and a peacock ? 
Is the deacon that sent the streaked cloth to the heathen, a weaver? 
Though the seamstress like neatness, and do her work neatly, I

if the judge appear, not to mislead him, nor to conceal the appeal 
for the release of the youth ; but repeat all that was said, reveal 
the truth, and appease him. If you maltreat the old man, and do 
not endear your son to him, should the disease cause his decease, 
he will bequeath his wealth to a stranger. 

5. Deepen the crack with a beetle. The greedy bear was fleeing

7. Do you perceive a wasp on the ceiling? Do you conceive that 
seizing the machine was right? I believe that he either meant to

The cashier wrote a receipt. These deeds were achieved by valor.

Dictation Exercises. 



1. Beckon to the gentle boy that is helping fill the empty cellar, 
and send him on an errand to get my leger. A bedbug is on the 
bedding, on the bedstead, in my bedroom. That blessed cherub is 
a blessing to her erring father. The kettle and fender are at the 
ferry. She said in her letter, that the merry, clever lad had earned 
a medal. The chemist will not meddle with that melon, near the 
hemlock. The despot left his helmet in the belfry. I fear the melt- 
ing snow may cause a deluge on the level ground, that will bear 
away the levee. 

2. I wrote a message to my messmate, with a pencil. There never 
was method in the nether room. I relish a plenty of pepper in my 
food. The sheriff made a second schedule of the goods. The self- 
ish Jew, in his splendor, would not give a shekel to the starving 
shepherd. Twenty yards of that velvet would be a splendid pres- 
ent. The seven men in that vessel must perish, if she can find no 
shelter from the storm. When the skeptic, in his terror, sought a 
refuge in the temple, the tempest caused it to tremble. 

3. I consent not to avenge my wrongs, if you confess that you 
did abet the adept in his attempt to gain access to my room, when 
I was abed. Collect the assets, and accept the bequest. He will 
not condemn the cadet, if he heed his behest. He will compel you 
to ascend the steep ascent.

4. Be content to contend for the right, and to defend all that are 
in distress. Do not contemn and detest those that dissent from 
your express views ; but divest your mind of the bad effect of con- 
tempt. Do not expect to excel, if not exempt from defect. After 
they elect your son, if he must contest his seat, direct him not to 
regard expense ; but to dispense favors freely, and to depend on his 
friends in his defense. 

5. Inspect the gazette, and read the farewell address. Do not 
lament, if he invent a tale of the immense extent of the land I 
possess. If she herself, by a finesse, intend to foment the feud, or 
to impel my friend himself, for any pretense, to object to extend the 
time of my payment, I will neither forget nor neglect to perplex 
and oppress her. 

6. I regret that, for any pretext, you should profess to protect the 
girl, and redress her wrongs, when she does not repent for the past, 
nor respect you. Unless you yourself relent and prevent her suc- 
cess, I will resent this slight ; and, to end your suspense, revenge 
my wrongs. If you suspect that James will transgress, I suggest 
that you request your son to select a man to do the work. 

7. If I have any horse from so many, I want a steady one. 
Again ask that cleanly lad to have some breakfast. The healthy 
peasant found a treasure in the meadow. &quot;When you are ready to 
kill the pheasant, rest that heavy, deadly weapon against the fence. 
Neither deafness nor headache can daunt that deathless soul. If 
the weather is pleasant, that zealous, steadfast lad is bound for 
pleasure. 

8. I will go, instead of the maid, to see if the cloth is unspread. 
Do not jeopard your life, if the leopard seize the heifer. If you 
long for friendship, be friendly. That saddle has but one stirrup. 
Do squirrels gnaw ?

Dictation Exercises. 

1. The clergy in the service of a certain church, though fervent, 
are not perfect. The herdsman fears the fervid heat will kill the 
verdant herbage. The hermit, though nervous, is a person of ster- 
ling worth ; and, therefore, it is certain he will not perjure himself.

The merchant had mercy on the servile servant, that drank the 
sherbet, and sent him to hear the sermon. 

2. I infer, from your reserve, if this alert and expert man aver 
that he can disperse the crowd, that you will not advert to it. If 
that inert and perverse man asperse and desert this superb lady, 
and does not avert the evil, and preserve her from shame, he does 
not deserve the name of man. If he is averse to the plan, you can 
not coerce him ; but he will defer to you, if you convert him. 

3. Though early and earnest, the learned man, at the age of thirty, 
did not gain the earldom. Did the earthquake break the earthen- 
wares ? Though irksome, thirteen boys were firmly searching for 
earthly learning. The worthy virgin kept a journal, on her journey. 
Though thirsty and infirm, the workman showed great firmness, in 
the skirmish near his birthplace. 

4. The burly burglar, after the murder, did bear his cursed bur- 
den a furlong. The curfew was rung at eight o&apos;clock. The curlew 
flew to the burdock that is near the curbstone. Will you furnish a 
purple curtain for the further room ? For what purpose did the 
surly surgeon ask you to give the surname of the turnkey ? Did 
he unfurl the sails, when he saw the smooth surface of the surgeless 
sea? Did he give you a guerdon for the turnips, turkey, turtle, and 
sturgeon ? When there is a turmoil, it is absurd to incur risk. If 
t^ie purser return, on Thursday he will disburse the funds.

1. The idle driver has a bias for cider. He read his Bible by lire- 
light, on Friday. Bipeds have two feet, and bivalves two shells. 
The crier told the driver, while driving, to take the bridle and 
catch the hindmost horse in the drove. The iceberg is almost as

Dictation Exercises, 

1. The bishop is no bibber nor bigot. Do not bicker with the 
bidder, when bidding. A billow struck the frigate. The bittern is 
bitter. Did the cinder that fell from*the chimney, blister your fin- 
ger? A chicken is in the cistern. The city gave a civic crown,

2. Send the giddy gipsy to the furthest limit of the kingdom. If 
she is giving ginger to the child for its&apos; illness, she may injure it. 
See the light glisten and then glimmer.. The instant an ingot of 
gold was found, it served as an impulse for an influx of strangers, 
inland. Come hither, if they kidnap the man and hold an inquest 
in the inner court or inmost part of the palace. My kingly kins- 
man loves his kindred. The little kitten caught an insect in the

day. 

3. The nimble minion did nimbly wade into the middle of the 
stream. The miller says that mildew has injured the millet. The 
minstrel, at midnight, stood by a pillar of the temple, to listen to 
the ripple of the river. A billion is one million of millions. It is 
a pity that the pigmy should pilfer a pigeon, a pippin, and a pitcher. 
Prithee, rigid pilgrim, put up thy pistol. I saw her ringlets on the 
pillow. Tell the printer that I want the printing done quickly. 

4. My sister has a pair of scissors, and a silver thimble. The 
sickly scribbler will scribble for. a shilling an hour. The simple 
man, in splitting a shingle with a sickle, got a splinter in his finger. 
At a given signal, a skillful rider, who was sitting on my skittish 
horse, rode past with great spirit. Skim the sirup with $ skimmer. 
I found some spikenard and spinach in the garden. He is too timid 
to go thither. 

5. The tinder took fire in a twinkle. Do not titter, if the tinker 
make the bell tinkle. Use tinsel for the trimming. The winged 
birds twitter. The vicar of the village has much vigor. On my- 
vigil, from the window of the windmill, I saw the willful villain 
kill his willing victim with a whipstock. No one is a winner of 
wisdom, by mere wishing. The witless man left his visor by a 
willow, on his visit to the vineyard. 

6. If the judge dismiss the case and acquit your son, and you for- 
give and admit him, methinks he will not assist to abridge our 
pleasure, or afflict you. I insist, if you begin, that you do not de-

tude. The lady took the manuscript, and read a madrigal in a mas- 
culine tone. Read my Manual of Magnetism. Did the people of

that maritime town appoint magistrates? Does the mariner know 
the maximum price of mackerel? The magistrate said, u Itis man- 
ifest that the matricide docs not respect the majesty of the law, nor 
regard the magnitude of his crime;&quot; 

6. Without reading my paraphrase, you would think the parados 
in my narrative a palpable error. The passenger should know that 
Hve can not navigate the river without patronage. A paragraph, 
from that parable Would pacify the child. In the pantomime, a 
paroquet appears, to hold a parasol. The parasite declares that your 
daughter is a paragon with no parallel. A practical man will not 
patronize quackery. . • 

7. Ramify the treaty, if the king ratify it. The sasafras and 
tamarind are a rarity in this county. The raspberry has sanative 
and saccharine qualities! Is it sacrilege for a&quot; man without sanctity 
to partake of the sacrament? .The vagabond will scandalize us by 
some tragedy or scandalous rhapsody. The receipt of the valentine, 
on Saturday, tranquilized his mind and pleased his vanity. 

8. I will request my companion to abandon his bombastic style 
of writing, for it is not attractive. Put on apparel proper for 
aquatic sports. The assassin joined the battalion and crossed the 
Atlantic. Neither disparage, nor embarrass that erratic youth, if 
you have an attachment&apos; for him. Some botanic extracts are good 
cephalics. That ecstatic poem is didactic, as well as dramatic. De- 
traction from that fanatic can not injure my financial prospects. 
The. detachment did establish&apos; a fantastic encampment exactly in 
front of the wood. 

9. The mechanic made a galvanic engine. A gigantic mulatto 
taught gymnastic games on the piazza. If there be an infraction 
of that tyrannic law, do you imagine that inactive .sheriff will im- 
panel a jury? People who inhabit that volcanic region lead a 
monastic life. A river meanders through the romantic savanna. I 
trust we can substantiate the fact, that this unthankful rascalion 
was engaged in that unhappy transaction.

1. I desire the arbiter to hear my argument, if he arbitrate. 
Archery was prized by barbarous nations. Did the architect show 
the archetype of the architrave? During the armistice they will 
prepare an armament for the ship, at the armory. The artifice of 
the cardinal during carnival is chargeable to the parliament. The 
charlatan artfully practiced pharmacy. My guardian says that the 
carpenter, if a partisan, will suffer martyrdom. The marchioness 
sent some marmalade to the parsonage. The harmonist harmonized 
the tune, and produced harmony with the harpsichord. 

2. My copartner, with much nonchalance, has taken my apart- 
ment in a ship bound for the Antarctic ocean. Since the enlarge-

1. The talkative alderman was reading the almanac. A water- 
fowl is near the water-fall. I perceive the falsity of your statement. 
The subaltern will pay an installment. 

2. The sound was audible. The augury appeared plausible to the 
audience. The incautious marauder lost his tarpaulin. Under the 
auspices of the autocrat he advanced nautical science. Did the 
defaulter authorize the auditor to make an unlawful and fraudulent 
entry ? 

3. The corpulent corporal will gormandize like a cormorant. The 
sorcerer did not regard my orphanage. That formalist is orthodox. 
Have they the fortitude to pass an ordinance to fortify the town? 
The porcelain ornaments were subject to forfeiture. The porringer 
was made of porphyry. You will be fortunate, if you engage the

I hope the reformer&apos;s efforts may not be abortive. The recorder

menial recently went to the city with a vehicle. Previous to that 
period, I saw a meteor. Do not deify a thing formed by Deity. 
The regency, though lenient, govern by secrecy. 

2. The secretion is acetous. Wax is adhesive. His adherent, 
though your coequal, gave in his adhesion to my party. Behemoth 
was a primeval animal. Were the cathedral and museum coeval 
with the Pantheon ? He is unequal to the completion of the task. 
The facetious lad told an egregious falsehood about the hyena. The 
ideas of the plebeian, at the lyceum, were indecent. It is illegal to 
subpoena the vicegerent. 

3. If he be insincere, anteeede him and contravene his measures. 
Unless you persevere, the work will be incomplete. If you do not 
intercede nor interfere, you may supersede my clerk. 

4. Is the fricassee eatable? Do not be uneasy nor indiscreet, if 
the proceedings are feasible. Judging from his appearance and 
demeanor, you would think the buccaneer peaceable. In his be- 
reavement, the financier listened to my entreaty and. made an agree- 
ment to pay the arrearage. The patentee is a nominee for an office. 
I will buy a magazine and a gazetteer. If the referee try to inveigle 
the pioneer, he will meet with unforeseen trouble. The devotee is 
speaking of the unbelief of the absentee. A mandarin, on board 
the ship at quarantine, has a dress of bombazine. Did the overseer 
domineer over the refugee? The brigadier, cavalier, chevalier, 
grenadier, and volunteer were armed cap-a-pie.

Dictation Exercises. 

1. Will you decorate my bedchamber ? If you use that bever- 
age, beggary will be your destiny. Though credulous, he has no 
deference for the decalogue. The delicate dentifrice had a chemical 
effect. Though there is a clerical error, the writing is credible. 
&quot;Within a century, much has been learnt with regard to dentistry 
and chemistry. The deputy will designate a definite time to ded- 
icate the temple and celebrate our victory. That desperate delegate, 
though a democrat, is a denizen and a demagogue. If he deprecate 
despotism and be not destitute of clemency, he will not devastate, 
or desolate, the land. 

2. He is in ecstasy with that elegant ebony cane. The epicure 
says that evergreen is an excellent esculent, or edible. The episode 
in that eloquent address will tend to edify and elevate your mind. 
That eminent man wrote an epitaph, elegy, and epilogue, at one sit- 
ting. Emphasis is one element of eloquence. Enmity must not move 
you to execrate your enemy, nor to burn him in effigy. Estimate the 
value of that emerald. From this eminence I saw an elephant. 
The emperor sent on this enterprise an embassy who was noted for 
his elegance. The excellence of that exquisite equipage is evident 
to every one. Energy will enable you to extricate yourself from 
that exigence and to execute your enterprise.

No gentleman can be present at the feminine festival. Did the 
mendicant indulge in levity ? The lexicon has medical terms. The 
melody roused him from his lethargy. The heroine of the tale 
is a genuine native of the Western hemisphere. The negligent, 
messenger left the medicine. The generous general is noted for his 
lenity and heroism. If the heretic hesitate to renounce the heresy, 
he will lose his legacy and heritage. 

4. The pedagogue is noted for his pedantry. The penitent will 
not suffer the penalty, during the pendency of the suit. Will the 
pelican eat peppermint ? The perilous descent at the precipice will 
petrify you with fear. Petulance is not a mark of penitence. The 
querulous pensioner, though reduced to penury, now has a perpet- 
ual income. In the plenitude of his mercy, God stayed the pesti- 
lence. If you have a preference for virtue, its prevalence will re- 
move your prejudice against this city. The presbyter read the pen- 
tateuch on the day of pentecost. 

5. Rectify your error, and reconcile and recompense your servant* 
No one questioned the rectitude of the regicide, in our regiment. 
That remedy and regimen will renovate your health. My relative 
kept a regular register, while a resident of the city. Do not reprobate 
the renegade, but reprimand him. If, on taking a retrospect, I deem 
it requisite, I will change my residence for the residue of the term. 
Reverence the reverend gentleman, though he has but a small rev- 
enue. That sedulous senator is not sensible that he is in a reverie. 

6. The veteran uttered a noble sentiment. I saw a skeleton in 
the sepulcher. Several men wish a separate settlement. The spell- 
ing-book, the telegraph, and the telescope are useful. The ground 
taken in your argument on skepticism is not tenable. Ventilate 
the vestibule of the tenement. Temperance has a tendency to pro- 
mote temporal good. Did that terrible spectacle terrify the child, 
yesterday ? Verily I will testify to this verity. 

7. The amendment was made to the acceptance of the convention. 
The contentious appellant accepted the correction as authentic. In 
that aggressive adventure he made an accession to his wealth. The 
appendix is a useless appendage. The athletic apprentice gained 
the attention of the assembly, and was in the ascendant. I conjee-, 
ture they had a clandestine meeting last bissextile. A fair con&gt;plexion needs no cosmetics. 

8. After the declension of his business in December, the decep- 
tive defendant knew his debenture was worthless. The decrepit 
dependent is in a state of dejection. After the election of that ec- 
centric man, his excessive demerit caused the defection of his do- 
mestics. His depression led to the detection of the crime. He

will develop the plot in his digression. His distemper and deten- 
tion placed him in a dilemma. Embellish the book with expensive 
cuts. An emetic will remove the endemic. Did the thoughtless 
expression envenom his mind? The expectant did embezzle the 
money received from the exchequer. 

9. Before the inspection, I nad an impression that the indenture; 
was worthless. What incentive could secure his incessant efforts 
iu this inclement weather? Take a preventive, if you would avoid 
the infection. I shall inherit the estate, if it be intestate. It was 
the intention of the intendant to foment intestine feuds. I listened 
intensely to that offensive invective. If you offer no objection, in 
November I will make an investment of all my possessions. On 
that momentous occasion the majestic polemic made a pathetic 
speech for the prevention of oppression. 

10. His unerring perception and transcendent judgment insure 
Iiis progression in that profession. The measures are prospective 
and progressive. Prudential reasons will prevent the reception of 
our prospectus in September. The protective tariff, you will re- 
member, is for the protection of mechanics. Keflection led to the 
rejection of the prunella and suspenders. While the rebellion 
is in a state of quiescence, they will replenish the fort. Do not fear 
the resentment of that respectful and repentant youth. His reten- 
tive memory, and his resemblance to the general, secured his selec- 
tion. A succession of resplendent exploits caused the surrender of 
the fort, a suspension of the war, and the subjection of the people. 
The ruins of those stupendous works are tremendous. 

11. I will circumvent him, if he make an indirect attempt to 
intercept my letter. Your subtrahend is incorrect. Intersect means 
to divide. Do not reprehend the man, if he recommend satinet, or 
represent it as good. 

12. The unhealthy lad will endeavor to practice cleanliness. That 
unpleasant, treacherous man is moved by jealousy. The peasantry 
are already in jeopardy from the treachery of their pretended friends. 
The unsteady treasurer is noted for his pleasantry, at the treasury. 
The unfriendly man was at the buriaL

Dictation Exercises. 

1. The clergyman at the hermitage will certainly certify the king 
of the marriage. Know for a certainty, that perjury and perfidy 
shall receive their deserts. Fertilize the soil before the seeds ger- 
minate. The merciful hermitess prayed fervently for that merciless 
personage. Secure a permanent place in a mercantile house. Pay 
for the merchandise with the perquisites of your office. Will that 
servitor servilely permit a termagant to persecute him? That per- 
sonal remark was pertinent. That serpentine wood is not pervious 
to an army. In his verdancy he did not know that his labor would 
terminate at the terminus of the road. 

2. He will report adversely concerning coercive measures. His 
advertence and discernment prevented desertions. He has an aver- 
sion to coercion. His infernal assertions and aspersions caused the 
dispersion of my friends. The conversion and immersion of my 
fraternal preserver made my heart glad. If that emergence discon- 
cert him, I fear it may cause the insertion of an imperfect sentence. 
Is the wound internal or external ? That observant child receives 
maternal and paternal love. The reversion is uncertain. His per- 
verseness caused the subversion of the empire. 

3. The courteous journalist, who was present at the rehearsal, 
obtained a circular for me. The circumspect attorney pressed his 
demurrer with much urgency. The turpitude of the journeyman 
led him to commit burglary. Moved by my urgency, he is furnish- 
ing the nursery with new furniture. His nocturnal disbursements 
exceed his diurnal receipts. The usurper says the insurgents shall 
reimburse the expenses of the war.

Dictation Exercises. 

1. When going to the bir lery to get a diary, James saw a binary 
or double star. If the hierarch of the diocese use irony, he will be 
liable to censure. There is little likelihood that he can obtain the 
diadem by bribery. The sciolist has written a dialogue in a strange 
dialect. Among other finery in the library, I saw a diamond and 
some ivory. He earned his livelihood with his microscope. Did a 
nightingale disturb the quietude of his privacy? He gained a sine- 
cure by violence. I found a violet near the viaduct. 

2. My affianced admirer is a constant abider at our house. His 
refinement and acquirements entitle the sole surviver of the family 
to aspire to such an alliance. In compliance with my wishes, the 
aspirant made an assignment of his estate. I am desirous, by some 
contrivance, to enliven the hours of his confinement. On his arri- 
val, the disciple will decipher the letter. At the decisive moment, 
in defiance of my command, by his connivance, they procured the 
consignment of the goods without proviso. Orion appears above

an indictment. Unmindful of danger, we will environ the enemy 
and make a reprisal. Place no reliance on his untimely aid.

subdivide the superfine goods.

1. In the civilized world, biblical knowledge has not removed 
bigotry. The chivalrous citizen regrets that the days of chivalry! 
are passed. Bigamy is made criminal in all Christendom. If ray 
finical friend criticise that frivolous work, see that his criticism is 
just. I saw a cimeter at the citadal. There is a marked difference 
between diffidence and ignorance. Hitherto, that diffident man has 
been diligent in business. That impudent lad will soon dissipate 
his share of the dividend. You will be in imminent danger, if that 
hideous idiot seize the hickory cane. 

2. &quot;What incidence caused his indigence? The increment of his 
garden indicates a rich soil. That infamous woman will indurate 
her son&apos;s heart, in infancy. Indolence and insolence often lead to 
infamy. What could instigate the infidel to irritate that innqcent 
youth and cause such an injury ? Industry was the instrument that 
gave him influence. Intellect sweetens intercourse. During the 
interview, what led you to draw the inference, that that intricate 
business will cause infinite trouble? Iterate the remark, &quot;It will 
be for your interest, in the interim, or interval, to institute no 
suit.&quot; 

3 That liberal man will esteem it a privilege to liquidate the 
debt and liberate the debtor. The libertine was of good lineage. 
Liberty is the ligament that binds the states together. The liturgy 
was prepared for the church militant. Did the minister perform a 
miracle, at Michaelmas? The mischievous lad was noted for his 
mimicry. Will the milliner, in her misery, litigate her claim ? Did 
you hear the piteous cry of that miscreant? 

4. Is that timorous and rickety child exposed to the ridicule and 
ribaldry of that villainous man? Will that rigorous man observe 
the ritual service? The signatures are similar. Though the de- 
fense was vigorous, he fought skillfully, gained the victory, and 
signalized his name. His vigilance will enable him signally to de-J 
feat their villainy, and vindicate his honor. The simpleton chose 
a slippery path near a rivulet, in the wilderness. Request your 
visitant, or visitor, to signify his most trivial wants. 

5. The benignant committee, after reading an abridgment of the 
law, favored the acquittal of the prisoner. In his affliction, if he 
gain admission into your house, he will implore your assistance. 
On that auspicious occasion, ambition induced the capricious civil-

ian to secure a commission in the army. The collision was contin- 
gent. Consider the condition of the parties. If he feel contrition 
and continue consistent with himself, the trial can not lead to his 
commitment and conviction. 

6. The delinquent was deficient in decision. Did the efficient 
youth deliver my epistle and the delicious fruit ? If you would 
avoid derision, speak distinctly, and be explicit in your description. 
Exhibit the map before dismission. The empiric, or quack, will* 
distribute an edition of the book among his friends. If you enkin- 
dle a rebellion in his dominion, can he extinguish it with these 
equipments ? 

7. They are too familiar to be litigious or malignant. The mu- 
nitions and nutritious food are on the flotilla. The fruition of il- 
licit or forbidden things is brief. I will visit that infringement with 
an infliction. What led to the omission of the initial letters of the 
musician&apos;s name? The magician puzzled the logician. The decis- 
ion was both judicial and judicious. Though the optician is offi- 
cious, I value his opinion 

8. The religious patrician favors pacific measures. I had permis- 
sion to present the pernicious petition at the pavilion, though it 
places the physician in a false position. The postillion, though un- 
skillful, is submissive. A restrictive provision, if stated with pre- 
cision, to prohibit the sale of rum in the provincial towns, would 
further the cause of religion. Submission is not sufficient at that 
punctilious court. Did he solicit aid to quell a sedition? The un- 
thrifty farmer is unwilling to pay for the violin. Suspicion and 
tradition did not warrant that vindictive and terrific measure. 

9. The column was not a cylinder, but a pyramid. How bodies 
crystallize is a mystery. Joseph is a hypocrite and a sycophant. 
That mystical book says that there are a myriad physical mysteries. 
Do you observe the symmetry of that sycamore ? That symphony 
awakens sympathy. Though the laws are tyrannous, the king will 
not favor tyranny.

Dictation Exercises. 

1. The cogency of his argument, when claiming the brokerage, 
forcibly reminded me of our jovial friend. He noticed your droll- 
ery in his comatose or drowsy condition. After such copious 
(fchowers, the stream will not be fordable. The poetry of the Orient 
is glorious. Much is said, in poesy, of flowers and foliage. That 
&apos;forgery will bring odium upon his family. The votary of fashion 
will notify his stoical friend, if he need more hosiery. Laudanum 
is an opiate, or medicine that contains opium. That potentate un- 
derstands the potency of popery.

gain my composure till that untoward, atrocious wretch makes full 
atonement for causing this eommotion and bloodshed. There was 
an important disclosure in his letter of condolence. Is the air un. 
wholesome, in October? If, after her elopement, you wish to obtain 
a divorcement, my services are at your disposal. A large propor 
tion of the ferocious soldiers were killed by the explosion of a mag 
azine, in the inclosure. His heroic deeds will ennoble his name and 
lead to his promotion. The deportment of the deponent at hi 
devotions was decorous. Will emotions of pity prevent the en 
forcement of the foreclosure ? Your opponent made an unholy and 
unsocial proposal.

Dictation Exercises, 

1. Did the choleric combatant do you bodily harm? The cotta- 
ger will find a description of the columbine in my Manual of Bot- 
any. Cholera is prevalent in the colony. Does chocolate affect 
bronchial diseases ? The chorister wrote a comedy and a comical 
colloquy. The commodore is confident that the District Courts 
have cognizance of maritime causes. His complaisance, when try- 
ing to compromise the question in the conference, was contrary to 
his nature. The complaisant teacher drew a picture of a crocodile, 
in my copy-book. Comity, between persons who congregate here, 
is congruous to the place. Are copperas and crockery contraband 
goods? On account of a death at the consulate, the competent 
consul will resign the consulship. The coroner, who was conver- 
sant with the deceased, will convocate a jury. 

2. The forester says the dog is docible. This document is a doc- 
trinal homily that will remove your dogmatism. Did you hear the 
dolorous cries of the dropsical patient at the hospital ? Is hominy 
a novelty ? Modernize the moccasin. Do not modulate your voice 
in mockery. Modesty and honesty will mollify his anger. That 
nondescript committed a horrible crime. The moralist will mod- 
estly moralize on the effects of lotteries. Does the logical monitor 
understand Jogarithms ?

the subject of much obloquy. My porringer is not ponderous. A 
polyglot bible is a bible in many languages. A polygon is a figure 
of many sides. A polypus is something that has many feet. I 
oftentimes had ocular proof that the labor at the pottery was oner- 
ous. In his posthumous works, he speaks of the poverty cf that 
populous land. His silence with regard to the opera is ominous. 
If it be possible to engage the popular orator, it will be politic. A 
knowledge of the origin of that obsolete saying would not obviate 
the obstacle. What can occupy the time of the opulent occupant 
of the house opposite ? 

4. The progeny of that prodigal, if properly taught, will not be 
profligate. That prominent and promising man is noted for his 
probity and promptitude in business. When the protestant became 
a proselyte, he desired to propagate the sophistry. That provident 
young man will prosecute his guardian, to secure his propertyc 
Did the prophetess prophesy that the prophecy would prove false? 
If the voluble sophomore understand syntax and prosody, he wil&amp;not use a solecism. By his providence, while in that tropical coun- 
try, he will maintain his solvency. The tomahawk was the prox- 
imate cause of the robbery. He solemnly declares that he will sol- 
emnize his marriage in that solitude. 

5. I admonish you to abolish that despotic law, lest you incur 
the abhorrence of the people. Demolish the colossal statue. If 
she acknowledge the receipt of that impromptu acrostic, she will 
astonish me. If the apostle demonstrate to the apostate the truths 
of the gospel, he will accomplish a good work. If the despondent 
insolvent receive his allotment, he will redeem his deposit. The 
sirocco injured the sclerotic of his eyes. After taking the narcotic, 
I was unconscious. The impostor understands the symbolic lan&lt;- 
guage of the masonic order. Do not embody in a book those im« 
modest and immoral sayings. The speecli of the respondent, in 
favor of his remonstrance, was laconic and uncommon. That un- 
godly and inconstant man obtained the morocco and exotics by 
improper means. 

6. W T e found a large quantity of halibut on the quarantine ground. 
If you quadruple your offer, you may take the quadruped. A quad-

Dictation Exercises. 

1. I saw a cucumber at the curacy. The juvenile fugitive is in 
the cupola. The cuticle of the hand is not very durable. Fumi- 
gate her room and buy a curative plant. Is that glutinous substance 
fusible? The success of that furious man is dubious. The curious 
humorist is noted for his fluency. I heard many humorous and 
ludicrous tales, during the jubilee. The want of nutriment in the 
ship caused mutiny and lunacy. Did the lunatic mutilate the book ? 
The poems that were written during his pupilage, though numerous, 
were puerile. Do you question the purity of the puritan? Rum 
will stupefy and cause suicide. The studious lad refused to take 
spurious money. That luminous argument is in unison with my 
views. The usurer took more than his usual usury, for the use of 
that money.

liis allusion to the refusal of the accused, used abusive language, 
lie has too much acumen to be deceived by such allurements. In* 
nocent amusements are conducive to health. The illusions of his 
youth were amusing. We arrived at the conclusion that the confu- 
sion was the result of collusion. His essay for the diffusion of use- 
ful knowledge will long illumine the page of history. That inhu-

i^hc tribunal met pursuant to adjournment. 

3. Do not importune your friend to procure that immature fruit. 
If you feel insecure, my visit is opportune ; for you can now leave

Dictation Exercises. 

1. If the gluttonous man understand gunnery, lie will shoot a 
buftalo with his blunderbuss. A butterfly is on the buttercup. I 
saw some buttermilk and butternuts in the buttery. If he be cul- 
pable, take him into custody. It is drudgery to scour the cutlery. 
The music of the dulcimer is sweeter than those guttural sounds, 
A humming-bird is on the mulberry. The pimils at the nunnery are

cotash and inuskmelons. The pungency of these scurrilous remarks 
moved the muscular teacher, on a subsequent day, to inflict punish- 
ment and subjugate the lad. If the supplement to the will be ob- 
tained by subterfuge, the surrogate will nullify it. If the suppli- 
cant assume a suppliant posture and supplicate aid, his utterance 
will be weak. 

2. The fields give promise of autumnal abundance. Abundant 
crops accustom the people to excessive consumption. At this con- 
junction, the construction placed upon that compulsive measure 
would cause a convulsion, that would tear asunder the dearest ties. 
With your concurrence, we will hold the impulsive man and pre- 
vent the concussion. That conundrum will cause discussion. After 
the eruption of the volcano and the destruction of the city, the 
moon shone forth with its usual effulgence. I will exculpate the 
man and prevent his expulsion, for his escutcheon is without blot. 

3. It is incumbent on the indulgent parent to inculcate good pre- 
cepts and furnish good instruction. If, by injustice, he place an in- 
cumbrance on the estate, I will inculpate him. If you remove the 
obstruction, the river will inundate that productive land and destroy 
the productions. The occurrence is instructive. I will not be re- 
luctant to vote for a reduction of that recumbent officer&apos;s redun- 
dant salary. At that moment, the refulgent beams of the morning 
sun played upon the rotunda. If you try to reconstruct the order 
of the march, you will interrupt the whole triumphal procession. 

4. On that comfortless night, the lad bought the compasses, and 
a colander, comforter, and coverlet. The company sent a constable 
to arrest the covetous conjurer. The honeycomb is a wonderful 
specimen of skill. The sovereign is at the head of the government. 
&quot;We must either discomfit or encompass the enemy. Does that un- 
lovely girl discolor her face ? If you break a blood-vessel and take 
no nourishment, I fear that you will not recover.

Dictation Exercises. 

1. Mary is not amiable, for her temper is variable. One who 
is guilty of plagiarism, or stealing from the writings of others, is 
called a plagiarist, If the light be favorable, variegate the paper 
with blue and white. 

2. The writ is abatable. The agrarian was guilty of chicaner}*. 
If the barbarian subsist only on spontaneous productions, his living 
will be precarious. Sheep are gregarious animals. That extrane-

librarian was incapable of so nefarious nn act. That sectarian is a 
vicarious agent. Tiie eartn is called terraqueous because it is com- 
posed of land and water.

elected by acclamation. His adoration was sincere. The affidavit 
and allegation are false. That advantageous measure will secure 
their approbation. His adulation was an aggravation of the evil. 
You can easily determine the calculation by the application of an 
algebraic formula. His conversation, after the celebration of the 
marriage, awakened contemplation. Ilis commendation of the 
compilation is a sufficient confirmation of its value. The contla- 
gration caused much consternation in the convocation. A due cul- 
tivation of the head and the heart will lead to a glorious consum- 
mation. 

4. Emulation and the expectation of a reward moved him to 
make a declamation. I rely on his declaration. Defamation and 
dissipation caused his degradation. Demonstrations of j y ill be- 
come the desperado, after his depredations have made my garden a 
desolation. If, in his desperation, you provoke his detestation, you 
will incur his imprecation. His deviation from the path caused the 
dislocation. Her invocations of the gods was to secure the power 
of divination. Your illustrations will provoke no exclamation of 
surprise from the ignoramus. Her education will surpass your ex- 
pectations. The exportation of cotton and importation of silk may 
benefit the nation. He Iras no inclination for information. Her 
intimation enabled me to find your habitation. 

5. Wicked legislation and regulations caused the lamentation of 
the people. The mediation of the literati secured his liberation. 
Meditation leads to moderation. He devotes to navigation all the 
time that his other occupations will permit. If you secure my 
nomination, you will place me under obligations. His pharisaic 
life and ostentation injure his reputation. Do not regard his prot- 
estation, if the operation will secure the preservation of the prop- 
erty. He urged the provocation in palliation of his profanation. 
In the preparation and publication of the proclamation, observe the 
rules of punctuation. Recreation and a relaxation of study will 
promote his reformation. Her respectful salutation and the value 
of her revelation secured her restoration to her friends. His wild 
speculations and destitute situation caused their separation. When 
I was in tribulation, God heard my supplications. It&apos; he encourage 
the violation of just stipulations and accept a false valuation of tlio 
goods, I can have no veneration for the man. 

6. The abecedarian says that his teacher is a good disciplinarian. 
His speech was extemporaneous. The predestinarian is a sexage 
uarian. Will the valetudinarian accent the administratorship?

Dictation Exercises. 

1. If you make an amicable arrangement with your adversary, 
he will be an admirable accessory to the felony. The accuracy of 
his statement does not excuse his acrimony. His ideas of agricul- 
ture are antiquated. He wishes to secure the magistracy for his 
Cwn aggrandizement. That amatory poem is an allegory. The 
antiquary has a valuable alabaster vase. That janizary is a gladia- 
tor, or prize-fighter. That fashionable tabernacle is now habitable. 
It is a lamentable fact, that the charitable lapidary has a^ attack of 
apoplexy. The river is navigable, in January, when she is mar- 
riageable, she will enjoy her patrimony. Is the foe at the sanctu- 
ary vanquishable ? 

2. After the abandonment of the academy, he labored with alac- 
rity. Solve the problem by analysis. The anatomist has prepared 
a Manual of Anatomy. If he take my asparagus, I will punish his 
audacity. His barbarity, or brutality, caused this catastrophe. His 
want of capacity led to this calamitous treaty. Acid will coagulate 
or thicken milk. He enjoys comparative ease. That comparison 
is not compatible with justice. Congratulate your friend on his 
success. Yice contaminates character. 

3. Decapitate is to cut off the head. The tenor of his letter is 
declarative of his depravity. In his embarrassment, he could not 
tell the meaning of diameter. &quot;Will they evacuate the fort and di- 
lapidate the walls? To practice frugality is no disparagement to 
an embassador. The evangelist will elaborate that dogmatical ser- 
mon. Emancipate the serf. The sentence is emphatical and gram- 
matical. That extravagant speech will not eradicate errors. Avoid 
formality and fanaticism. His humanity led him to exaggerate the 
sufferings of the poor. 

4. If his salary be inadequate to his support, the church, if not 
unanimous, will increase it by a plurality of votes. He is noted 
for his rapacity and ingratitude. The printer will italicize that in- 
transitive verb. If you question the legality of the marriage or 
try to invalidate it, she will commit infanticide. No one is infal- 
Tblo. Flax is inflammable. That dog is noted for his sagacity and 
■voracity. Do not let misanthropy, or hatred of mankind, move 
you to infatuate the youth and cause him to pursue that erratic 
course. His loquacity and mendacity are disgusting. That refract- 
ory servant is noted for his rascality, vulgarity, and rapacity. If he 
procrastinate, prevaricate, and retaliate, I shall question his morality. 
That law is unnatural and tyrannical. The tobacconist is a som-

nambulist. The inhabitants of that locality often speak of the ur- 
banity and veracity of that magnanimous philanthropist, 

5. His speech was declamatory. This letter is declaratory of 
your father&apos;s wishes, llis trouble is imaginary. His words are 
defamatory, or false and injurious. That island is not inhabitable. 
Attend to your preparatory studies. 

i G. My benefactor is a democratic leader and a diplomatic agent. 
The malefactor stole coriander seed. If you manufacture those 
goods, keep a memorandum of them. Mathematics should be pur- 
sued in a systematic manner. 

7. The popularity of the biographical, geographical, and mathe- 
matical works is satisfactory to the publishers. Without question- 
ing my criminality, they received me with cordiality at the car- 
avansary. Though the generality of mankind commend liberality, 
they condemn prodigality. If his manufactory were burned, his 
punctuality, regularity, and pertinacity would enable him to rebuild 
it. If our host indulge in personalities, he will violate the rules 
of hospitality. Vice and virtue are incompatible. His sensuality 
has made him pusillanimous. There is a typographical error in 
that topographical work. That indefatigable student will study 
mineralogy. 

8. The aristocratic ecclesiastic addressed the people of that mu-

Dictation Exercises. 

1. Since the collegian is amenable to the college laws, lie may 
deem it expedient to abbreviate his essay. Hear the aerial song- 
sters. That obedient and abstemious son will alleviate the care of 
the inebriate&apos;s wife. That imperious manner is not congenial to 
the comedian. Anterior to that event, my limited experience had 
led me to take the exterior as a criterion of character. That tra- 
gedian has few superiors. The ingredients were prepared from 
materials found in the interior of the country. That obsequious 
man secured the vicegerency in a mysterious way. 

2. Owing to its incoherence, that lecture will not prove delete- 
rious. If it be inconvenient, we will not require your interference. 
That sacrilegious Presbyterian used the ministerial fund for magis- 
terial purposes. It is immaterial whether they buy tallow or sper- 
maceti. A clay soil is uncongenial to that plant. The epicurean&apos;s 
trouble is irremediable. Much may be learned from an encyclope- 
dia. Tlint heterogeneous mixture was called a panacea, or remedy 
for all diseases. 

3. Is his property concealable, or inconcealable? Water is con-, 
gealable. At this unseasonable hour, it is unreasonable to visit our 
friend. His conduct is unimpeachable, and his title indefeasible. 
What could cause the disagreement between those agreeable people 
is inconceivable. Time once past is irredeemable. His credit is 
irretrievably lost.

Dictation Exercises. 

1. That estimable youth, who is so exemplary in his life, is justly 
celebrated for his efficacy in an exigency. A man who is given to 
epicurism generally prefers celibacy. The ceremony at the ceme- 
tery was credible to those present. In a desultory conversation, 
the legislator said that his friend, though eligible to that office, and 
sustaining an enviable reputation, is restrained by his delicacy. 
That despicable emissary, who is employed on that execrable busi- 
ness, ridicules epilepsy. The decision of that equitable judge 
with regard to mendicancy is not explicable by the usual rules of 
law. His excellency the governor Avrote his memorable letter to 
the legislature in February. 

2. It is necessary that the teacher at the seminary be peremp- 
tory. The prebendary, in his prefatory remarks, declared necro- 
mancy merely speculative. Though her character be not reputable, 
she is penetrable to kind entreaties. The predatory party destroyed 
all vegetables and other perishable property. That speculator is a 
sedentary man. If the decree be revocable, his testimony will be 
valuable. The presbytery will elect that venerable man to the 
presidency. 

3. The celebrity you acquired from the celerity of your move- 
ments will accelerate the march of your competitor. If that de- 
lectable mountain be accessible, an invitation to visit it will be

acceptable. Man is the appellative, or common name, of the whole 
human race. If he gain the ascendency in the conventicle, or 
secret assembly, his asperity and austerity will disgust his confed- 
erates. Beneficent means doing good; benevolent, merely having 
a desire to do good; but both are commendable terms. His bien- 
nial fast, for two consecutive days, is designed to commemorate the; 
sufferings and virtue of his father. The degenerate and detestable, 
directory did not manage the affair with dexterity. That contem- 
plative old man, in his decrepitude and dependency, finds nothing 
in this life commensurate with his desires. 

4. Effectual means were taken to secure the electoral vote for 
that irresolute, intemperate, and effeminate candidate. It is in- 
credible that that impetuous speech, with its many embellishment, 
was delivered extempore. Were the executor and executrix guilty 
of embezzlement ? The equestrian statue of the executive will elec- 
trify the spectators. His fidelity as a minister, and his integrity in 
business, exemplify the value of his precepts. After the impedi- 
ments were removed, that incredulous teacher deferred making the 
experiment for an indefinite time. If that ingenuous man lose his 
inheritance, he will request you-, in his extremity, to investigate his 
affairs. If you interrogate that intelligent lad, and he confess that 
he used an indelicate expression, his frankness will extenuate his 
offense. That inveterate drinker, who has suffered so much from 
intemperance, is impenitent. 

5. The progenitor of that family and his posterity were noted 
for their longevity. His malevolence is perceptible. Millennium 
means a thousand years. If the obstreperous pedestrian have the 
temerity to disturb our triennial solemnities, he will necessitate us 
to resort to severity. His necessitous friends are the cause of that 
ungenerous man&apos;s perplexity. To his poetical, susceptible, and re- 
generate heart, the beauties of nature are a source of perennial or 
perpetual cheerfulness and serenity. The grave is the receptacle 
of the dead. On that tempestuous night, I took my supper at a re- 
fectory. I do not question the supremacy of Congress in making 
war and peace. Death ends terrestrial scenes. His sincerity does, 
not excuse his severity. 

6. That commemorative act is unnecessary. A coteinporary 
writer speaks of that poet&apos;s effeminacy, and the degeneracy of the 
people. That song was extemporary. Do not deprive your sti- 
pendiary of his inheritable estate and inestimable rights. Those 
incendiary remarks, his hereditary pride, and the inveteracy of his 
hate, have rendered that man&apos;s character unenviable. 

7. If that energetic boy, in his adolescence, receive academic

honors, I am apprehensive that they will prove detrimental. That 
plant is alimental. His convalescence, after suffering from an epi- 
leptic attack, an apoplectic fit, and an epidemic, was not accidental, 
li I secure your acquiescence, my circumspection will enable me to 
avoid his circumvention. lie uses many complimental phrases. 
Glory is evanescent. His faults were not fundamental, nor detri- 
mental to his business. 

8. The inattention of my predecessor was instrumental in render- 
ing him unsuccessful. The inattentive youth did not understand 
yonr incidental remark. Can you read that oriental and monu- 
mental inscription-? Though independent, that lady is inoffensive 
and unaffected. During the interregnum, or time in which the 
throne was vacant, the regent encouraged regimental display, and 
sanctioned retrospective laws. Christ is our intercessor with the 
omnipresent Jehovah. That unexpected and sentimental appeal 
will move her sympathetic heart. 

9. In that elementary and catechetical book, which is designed 
for academical classes, the subjects are arranged in alphabetical 
order. That representative employed an amanuensis to copy the 
supplementary part of his argumentative speech. If that remedy 
be ineffectual, asafetida will be indispensable. The evangelical 
preacher is diametrically opposed to that reprehensible measure. 
Is that exegetical or explanatory remark designed to be apologetic? 
The rebellion was irrepressible. Experimental knowledge is not 
unacceptable to unregenerate persons.

Dictation Exercises. 

1. Tlmt fertilizer will be serviceable in the garden. ITc depends 
on mercenary troops for the permanency of Ids rule. Is that leather 
permeable to water? The perpetrator of that deed mercifully 
spared my child. Personally, 1 wdl not object if the personator of 
that persecutor be beaten mercilessly. 

2. He concernedly declared that, in his adversity, he could not 
pay for an advertisement. In an emergency, they would watch 
alternately. Owing to the proverbial impertinence of the frater- 
nity who were coutenliinous with the estate, and having no other 
alternative, the prince determined to exterminate them, and seize 
their convertible property. She is deservedly noted for her super- 
lative beauty. He is subservient to my views. He understood 
grammar so imperfectly that, in his uncertainty, he did not know 
an impersonal verb. Diversify the colors of the robe. A univer- 
sal preservative would not be superfluous. 

3. The plants are in the conservatory. The question is determ- 
inable. They fought determinate!}&apos;. India-rubber is impermeable 
to water. The imperviousness of the forest, and the nnreserved- 
ness of the commander, caused their subserviency to his will. Dur- 
i \\x the anniversary week, they unreservedly condemned univer- 
tUlism, and expelled a universalist from the university. 

4. He spoke cursorily of the burdensomeness of the tax. They 
f .light murderously. The writ is returnable to-morrow. The 
preacher enjoined taciturnity on the subject of purgatory, though 
he questions its absurdity.

1. The act to promote sobriety, and to prevent ebriety, is both 
advisable and desirable. There is no assignable reason for his anx- 
iety with regard to that advisory letter. No human power can 
annihilate matter. The proprietor undesignedly caused your in- 
quietude. His unsightliness, impoliteness, and impiety make the 
advertiser despisable. His mind is inclinable to truth. Society 
consider the supervisor reliable, for inviolate truth and propriety 
of conduct are dear to him. Variety in food often leads to satiety. 
Is that air respirable? Though undecided, the difference between 
the parties is reconcilable. A contrariety of opinions with regard 
to the notoriety of that crime is undesirable.

Dictation Exercises. 

1. The literary dignitary has great difficulty in conquering his 
dilatory habits. That intimacy with vice leads to ignominy, is not 
disputable. That imitator found many figurative expressions in my 
miscellany. Since man is an imitative being, he should follow the 
Saviour in all his imitable conduct. The intricacy of that miser- 
able man&apos;s affairs, and his pitiable conduct render it difficult to 
take an inventory of his property. That military chief encouraged 
literature. The province was tributary to Rome. 

2. His civility, benignity, ability, and activity in a contingency, 
render the general conspicuous. After the belligerent king had 
ranged his artillery on a gentle acclivity, he summoned the city 
to capitulate. His ambiguous excuse is not admissible. Do you 
notice the affinity of those articulate sounds? The artificer&apos;s agility 
enabled him to anticipate my movement. Crocodiles are amphib- 
ious and carnivorous animals. The centrifugal and centripetal 
f&gt;rces are called central forces, nis continual avidity for food, the 
restraint his captivity placed upon his convivial habits, and his cu- 
pidity, which was tempted by property contiguous to his estate, led 
the prince to become a conspicuous member of the conspiracy. 

3. If fever debilitate that diminutive man&apos;s system, and produce 
delirium, I will excuse his delinquency. If that deistical writer de- 
liberate, he will understand that definitive sentence. Will he de- 
lineate the duplicity of that fastidious lady? There was a divinity 
that moved our deliverer to come to our deliverance. Can he dia*

criminate primitive from derivative words? That elliptical phrase 
is equivocal. Docility and ductility are not equivalent words. An 
epitome of that book would facilitate his study. The festivity will 
felicitate your friend. The frigidity of the corpse proves the futil- 
ity of trying to revive it. 

4. To gesticulate in the street is not a mark of gentility. Ha- 
biliments of sorrow do not always indicate humility. Though the 
iniquitous municipal officers, during our imprisonment, attempted 
to intimidate our counselor, and habituate us to indignities, they 
found us invincible. Those indigenous plants are not injured by 
the humidity of the air. During the incipient stage of hostility, 
the insidious king tried to insinuate himself into the good graces of 
the nobility. That inquisitive itinerant should know that invid- 
ious comparisons are inimical to friendship. I trust that the 
judge, who is attending to his legitimate judicial business in that 
magnificent hall, is unmoved by malignity. My munificent patron 
will visit the place of his nativity. 

5. That perfidious political act proves his moral obliquity. Ob- 
livion alone can obliterate his reproach. The Being that can orig- 
inate worlds must be omnipotent. I. participate in your sorrow. 
Notwithstanding the prolixity of his promiscuous remarks, their 
meaning is perspicuous. His precipitous relinquishment of the 
pontifical robes, the publicity of his offense, the rapidity of his re- 
treat, and his rusticity placed the bishop in a ridiculous predica- 
ment. 

6. The satirical letter is free from scurrility. His servility is 
significant. The poet, in his soliloquy, speaks of the vicissitudes of 
life, and his similitude to his brother. The solidity of the wall in- 
sures its stability. The statistical reports show the sterility of the 
soil in that vicinity. The solicitor is solicitous to conceal the sim- 
l&gt;licity of his client. The timidity and stupidity of the king insure 
tranquillity. The ventriloquist&apos;s vociferous argument on the utility 
of ventriloquism was sophistical. 

7. That that deliberate assembly used considerable discriminative 
ability at the preliminary meeting is indisputable. That epistolary 
communication concerning the episcopacy is uninteresting. Owing 
to his inimitable tact, and the precipitancy of his friends, the legit- 
imacy of the measure was not called in question. 

8. Tiie Calvinistic divine questioned the jurisdiction of the pope, 
and regarded neither his benediction nor interdiction. A scientific 
man said that the calorific or heating rays of the sun often act as a 
fudorific. After an intermission of an hour, the time will be in- 
auspicious. Tour recognition of the child awakens many a remi-

niscence. That scholar is superficial. The hypocritic and the irre- 
ligious were included in his unforgiving malediction. 

9. The testimony is contradictory with regard to his capability, 
affability, credibility, and consanguinity. The president&apos;s want of 
equanimity, and his eccentricity, inconsistency, in^gniiicance, and 
imbecility will prevent the durability of the club. Much electric 
t iy is in the air. That individual has erysipelas. Remember the 
man&apos;s fallibility, when judging of the feasibility of his measure. 
After that indiscriminate slaughter, the inconsiderate youth suffered 
an ignominious death. The insipidity of the valedictory oration is 
attributable to the multiplicity of his duties. He is wanting in sen- 
sibility. The magnanimity and intrepidity of the general rendered 
his army indivisible and irresistible. Ilis plausibility led them 
to regard the possibility rather than the probability of success. 
Though the enemy&apos;s loss was inconsiderable, the general incon- 
siderately demanded the unconditional surrender of the fort. 

10. The generalissimo questions his accountability to the senate. 
I doubt the applicability of the law to this case. A compatibility 
of tempers is desirable. The susceptibility of water to compressi- 
bility is slight. Sarsaparilla is a plant. His pusillanimity rendered 
his eligibility doubtful. His respectability and responsibility are 
undoubted. 

11. Impenetrability and indestructibility are two essential prop- 
erties of matter. The imperceptibility of a shadow to the touch 
is easily proved. The impracticability of the measure is evident. 
Asbestus is noted for its incombustibility. The indivisibility of the 
soul is conceded. The incommunicability and incomprehensibility 
of the ways of Providence are no obstacles to the eye of faith. 
The unintelligibility of that sentence is evident. 

12. He has the dysentery. Define a dissyllable, a trisyllable, 
and a monosyllable. His enjoyment was empyreal, or heavenly. 
Polygamy is forbidden by Christian nations. The experiment was 
analytical. Does he like metaphysics? Did you read the pane- 
gyric ? Have you seen hieroglyphic writing ?

Dictation Exercises. 

1. Praise his adorable name in harmonious and melodious strains. 
Be not censorious in colloquial intercourse, but use appropriate 
words. The demoniac phrensy and indecorum of this notorious 
man cast opprobrium upon his name. The conduct of that inde- 
corous and uxorious man i» deplorable. The diplomatist&apos;s diplo- 
macy is worthy of encomium, or eulogium. His belief is erroneous. 
That act is felonious. The historian&apos;s commodious house is ap- 
proachable on the south. The virtuoso took a restorative for his 
hoarseness. 

2. His acrimonious language and uncontrollable temper render 
his wife inconsolable. The matrimonial rites were. ceremonious. 
The editorials with regard to the gubernatorial duties and the ora- 
torio were excellent. Equatorial climates are warm. Spirits are 
deemed incorporeal substances. This patrimonial estate has been 
in our family from time immemorial. Owing to the servant&apos;s ir- 
reproachable life and meritorious acts, his parsimonious master 
gave him a testimonial. This territorial question renders the me- 
diatorial office important.

Dictation Exercises. 

1. The competency of the commissary to abridge the rights of 
the commonalty was the subject of a commentary. The contro- 
versy at the monastery with regard to the profligacy of the clergy 
encouraged proselytism. That man, though honorable and hospi- 
table, is noted for his contumacy, or obstinacy. And is a copula- 
tive conjunction. Repeat the corollary. His obduracy may prove 
monitory and profitable. Will the operative accept your promis- 
sory note ? The man who occupies the solitary house on the prom- 
ontory is a voluntary exile. 

2. The compositor received an abdominal wound. I abominate 
an anomalous pronunciation. The accomplishments of the cosmop- 
olite enable him to apologize gracefully, make due acknowledgment 
when in a fault, and accommodate himself to circumstances. An 
anonymous author of a late biography tries to prove, by astrono- 
my and astrology, the Apocrypha canonical. Is the chronometer 
one of the fruits of chronology ? If atrocity be a concomitant of 
your authority, I will not cooperate with you to consolidate it. To 
my astonishment, he did corroborate that doubtful news. 

3. A historical writer says : &quot;It is demonstrable that a democ- 
racy always tends to economy.&quot; Do you denominate that a de- 
monstrative argument? Notwithstanding the ferocity of that idol- 
atrous nation, a decree to depopulate and impoverish their land 
would be impolitic. If you intoxicate the officer and seize his 
emoluments, he will suffer from despondency. My expositor un- 
derstands geography, geology, geometrv, and lithography.

4. I bought the mahogany bureau in the metropolis. If the ma- 
jority favor a monopoly, the minority must submit. At sea, such 
a phenomenon breaks the monotony of the surrounding expanse. 
This learned man understands orthography, philology, philosophy, 
stenography, zoology, and theology. Knowing the predominance 
of verbosity in his style, you alone will be responsible, if you give 
him priority in the discussion. If it be your prerogative to govern 
a child, I trust that the law of love will predominate in your mind. 
Bay a thermometer and a theodolite. The rhinoceros has but one 
horn. Can you prognosticate what the velocity of the wind will 
be an hour hence ? 

5. It is consolatory to know that that unprofitable business has 
not been derogatory to my character. An arsenal is a repository 
for arms. The incorrigible drunkard has an unconquerable appe- 
tite for rum. 

6. My correspondent uses allegoric language. The apostolic 
faith satisfies the philosophic mind. Paregoric is an economic 
anodyne. 

7. Are there anatomical plates in your work on physiology? 
Restrain your animosity toward the aristocracy. That astrological 
work is a curiosity. That interrogative sentence requires a cate- 
gorical answer. Copy the chronological table. Deuteronomy 
means the second law. That lexicographer understands etymol- 
ogy, physiognomy, physiology, and trigonometry. This periodical 
advocates the reciprocity treaty. 

8. His impetuosity caused him to lose the superiority. Meteor- 
ology treats of the atmosphere and its phenomena. His inferiority 
is conceded.

D ic ta tion Exercises. 

1. She understands the culinary art. Owing to the dubiousness 
of the act, the judicature declared it nugatory. The sun is a lumi- 
nary. Things that may be numbered are called numerable. The 
difficulty is superable. 

2. Though public evils accumulate, the judge will not be accu- 
sable. If proof be deducible from these facts, he will adjudicate 
your claim and grant an annuity. That alluvial soil will yield an 
exuberant crop. The effluvium of the rose is pleasing. The en- 
thusiast received a gratuity. The garrulity and enthusiasm of that 
communicant enabled him to impose on the credulity of the com- 
munity. If they communicate the story that this man&apos;s interfer- 
ence destroyed our connubial love, I will declare it confutable. 

3. If you illuminate his mind to an unusual degree, and raise 
him from obscurity, his penurious father will not remunerate you. 
The almost innumerable immunities of the clergy, the salubrious

taken with impunity. That incurable disease is imputable to his 
luxurious life. Intuitive evidence is indubitable. I can but vitu- 
perate my undutiful son, if he repudiates his debts, and refuse to 
remunerate his servants. That voluminous work establishes the 
fact that God only can fill every vacuity of the soul. 

4. My coadjutor prepared a constitution for an institution of 
learning. The destitution among the poor was caused by the dim- 
inution of contributions, and the substitution of machinery for 
manual labor. His resolution and elocution enabled him to stay 
the persecution, to insure the distribution of justice and the res- 
titution of goods unjustly taken, and to prevent a revolution and 
the dissolution of Congress. 

5. Moved by the importunity of his friends and the incredulity 
of his enemies, notwithstanding the ambiguity of the language, ho 
was enabled by his ingenuity and assiduity to demonstrate the in- 
congruity of his opponent&apos;s statement. To excommunicate men 
for multitudinous sins tends to the perpetuity of the church. An 
opportunity being given, he replied — &quot;Perspicuity rejects a super- 
tiuity of words.&quot;

2. If he adulterate food, the voluptuary will not hold him incul- 
pable. Though you calumniate that industrious and illustrious 
man, I will regard him as incorruptible. I noticed the reluctancy 
with which he resorted to compulsory measures. The profundity 
of the president&apos;s mind was discovered during his incumbency. 
Accent the penultimate. &quot;What you deem a redundancy would not 
support his voluptuousness. The rotundity of his figure and his 
unutterable humor insure a tumultuous applause. Asbestus is in- 
combustible. The soul is indestructible.

Dictation Exercises. 

1. What ails the heir of that estate? He drank all the ale. 1 
lave an adz, awl, auger, and anchor on the ark, or boat. He adds 
eight figures at once. Ought we to pay aught, if they fill the anker 
with wine ? An arc is part of a circle. Alter the place of tho 
altar. The augur noted the omens lie took the air ere he ate 
his breakfast. Ever is sometimes written e&apos;er. If you give your 
assent, I will make the ascent. The church on that isle has a wide 
aisle. 

2. Hold my bale while I bail the boat. The spread is baize. 
The hero is proud of his bays. The Bey of Tunis bade the bad 
man leave his tent. The boat in the bay is near the beach. The 
base lad who sings bass will break the flax with a brake. The 
man who sells bread, beer, beets, berries, braids, balls, and bells, is 
bald. The donkey brayed. The lad bawled when a bee stung his 
bare arm. Beat the bear with my beech-stick. He made a breach 
in the wall with the breech of his gun. That belle is well bred. 
You will need a bier when you bury the dead. . 

3. On my birthday, I secured a berth on this boat. Do the fish 
bite in that bight? Though this bold lad bowled well, a bolder 
one bowled out, in cricket. He put the boll of a plant in my bowl 
of milk. I found some bole, or fine clay, near a bowlder. A boar 
bore the bough of a tree on his tusk. He bored a hole in a board. 
He was borne to that land from whose bourn no traveler returns. 
I will break your bow and bruise your arrow. The beau knows 
how to bow, but he can not broach a butt of wine. He brews 
beer. Do not hurt a brute beast. A bruit is a rumor. Her brooch 
held the blue cloth when the wind blew. 

4. A snake chased the chaste girl. The canons of our church 
are printed in a calendar. Tire the cannon. The calender will 
^make the canvas smooth and glossy. Will he canvass the subject? 
(If the king call to his son, I will take the casque. from his head and 

cast it on the ground. She has a caul for her hair. Change the 
last clause in the letter before you send it. The cat put her claws 
into the cask of milk. Buy a cord of wood. He broke a chord of 
the viol. Caste is a separate and fixed class in society. To cede 
is to yield or give up. Birds eat seeds, ne ceiled the room with 
boards. The ceiling of the room is white. While sealing my letter,

I saw a seal in the creek. The wheels creak. To cere is to coves 
with wax. The seer saw a sear and yellow leaf. 

5. If your cousin be a seller, present him with my compliments, 
and request him to sell this coarse coat. The monk is in his cell. 
I found the core of an apple in the cellar. He sent a cent to the 
child. In that clime, the scent of the flowers is sweet. Cession is 
a yielding or giving up. During the session of the court, I will 
cite him to appear. The site of my house is in sight of the town. 
The corps can climb that wall. I can get no clue to the king&apos;s lost 
signet. Get a clew, or ball of thread, and catch the cygnet. Fol- 
low the course of the brook. lie has his complement of sheep in 
the cote. After the cruise, the cruel commodore paid all the crews. 
If she buy the crewel, he will cozen her. 

6. Will the Dane and Dey deign to drink a dram with you to- 
day? Come, dear, and drink a draught of milk. When your draft 
of ten drachms is due, I will cash it. The dust rises when the 
deer, the doe, and the ewe lamb run. If he earn the money, he 
will buy a dun cow and an urn. If he die, I will close his eyes. 
The dyer will dye the cloth. Bake the dough. The dire deed ia 
done. Dost thou see the dun. 

7. I would fain know why you feign illness in the fane or tem- 
ple. After employing a feint to get off, his faint heart led him to 
fieo as fast as his feet would carry him. What was his fate at the 
fete? The words, &quot;A fur-cap on a fir-tree,&quot; are a phrase. I will 
find good fare for the fair boarder. To catch a flea is quite a feat. 
Water will freeze. He frays the cloth, though there is a frieze, or 
nap, on it. The lady wears furs. Furze is a shrub. The judge 
fined Philip. During the fore part of the day, four men went forth 
from the fort. Filter the water. To fillip is to strike with the 
nail of the finger. Bread is made of flour. The knowledge of 
flowers is his forte. That was the fourth fowl that flew up tha 
flue of the foul chimney. 

8. Did your guest gage the great cask with a gauge ? Open the 
greater gate. Grate the root with a grater. Since the man has 
grown stout, he has an odd gait. If the saddle gall the horse, I 
will buy some grease. Eead the history of ancient Gaul and 
Greece. She guessed the riddle. If they gild the book, the guild, 
or society, will pay for the gilt. Do not gloze or flatter the man. 
The cinder glows. That groan proves his guilt. 

9. The hale man does not fear snow and hail. Haul the hay to 
the hall. Hey, girls! have you heard that Hugh has dark hair 
and a brave heart. I saw a hare and a hart in the herd. If she 
heal the wound on my heel, and mend the hole in my hose, I will

hire lier for a whole month. Here you may hear him sing a hymn. 
That hour, the horde hied to higher ground. He paid a high price 
for the hide. Ho, he hoes the corn with a hoe. He has a hoop 
in his hoard. If you hew the log, he will raise a great hue and 
cry. I heard the man whoop, at our house. 

10. If that knave invade the rights of the just king, the men will 
kill him. I knew, if he inveighed against the vices of the king,&quot; 
that the jury would indict him. &quot;Will you indite a letter in this 
inn? Did he jam his finger on the jamb? That knight was not 
present at the joust. He knows that my seat is near the nave of 
the church. You need a key to open the door. At night she will 
knead the dough and build a new fire in the kiln. The sled is 
kneed. The ship is at the quay. Your nose bleeds. Tie a knot. 

11. If the boat leak, that has lain so long at the foot of the lane, 
I will not lade it. The leeks were laid on the girls&apos; laps. Kot 
noting the lapse of time, he did not learn his lesson. The man 
lacks bread because his morals are lax. The horse feeds on the 
lea, near the lee shore. Leach the ashes, and save the lye. Leech 
the wound, if you would lessen the pain. The liar had as lief lie 
as not. Lo ! the lone leaf lies low. After he had procured a load 
of lead, he led his levy against the enemy. She will play on her 
lyre at your levee. Limn or paint the limb of a tree on paper. 
The lynx broke a lock and the links of a chain. The cow lowed 
near a loch, or lake. 

12. The maid made a mark with her pen. The male passenger 
tnissed the main chance to send his letter by mail. While the 
horse was eating maize, the lad seized his mane. He is lost in a 
maze. The lord of the manor has a pleasing mien, or manner. 
Hang your mantle near the mantel to dry. The marshal likes mar- 
tial music. Do not give a meed to the mean. Drink mead. &quot;Who 
will cet metes and bounds to their might? I saw a mite on the 
meat. We will meet again. The miner found a rich lode, or vein, 
in the mine. A minor can not vote. He missed his way in the 
mist, and fell into a moat. When a mote was in his eye, I heard 
him moan. The grass is mown, for I mowed it. Muse on the, 
mode of dressing. The cat mews. When chewing, the mucus 
should mix with your food. That substance is mucous or slimy. 

13. He owed me money ; nay, he stole it. JSTone said that the 
horses neigh. The nun knit that nice glove. The rock is gneiss. 
I saw nits on the calf. O, did you owe him ? Oh, despair ! we 
can not go o&apos;er the lake, for my oar is broken. He wrote one 
ode. He won some gold ore. That pale girl has a pail of milk. 
My teeth pain me. The pane of glass is plane. Pause, I pray

stone. Is there much juice in the pomace ? If it rain, I will loose 
the rein, and ride fast. The king will not raze the city, if it re- 
spect his reign. 

15. A load of rye is on the rack. Wrack is a sea-plant. If he 
wrap my cloak about him, I will rap his hands with a reed. I will 
read the book. He read the paper. Did the lad with red hair 
reek with perspiration? &quot;Wrest the knife from that rude wretch, 
or he will wreak his vengeance on you. The medicine makes him 
retch. He recks me not. The rigger and the wright work on the 
wreck. Buy the rest of the rice. If there be a rise of land, he

my hand, you will break my ring. He treated me with great rigor.

the weight with sheers, I like sheer wit. The sleeve did seem to 
be without seam. Sleave the silk. Give the sweet lady a good 
suite of rooms. Step on. The steppes of Asia are vast unculti- 
vated plains. The serf swam in the surf. The coat is made of

tacks ? Pay the tax. For a time, tares and thyme grew on that

Dictation Exercises, 

1. &quot;&apos;Twas certain, he could write, and cipher too.&quot; Sin, or 
moral evil, should excite the greatest abhorrence. He, and he 
only, is worthy of our supreme affections. Sound, sound the tam- 
bourine. Remove, expel, the blustering, blundering blockhead! 
The mind is that which knows, feels, and thinks. Honor, afflu- 
ence, and pleasure seduce the heart. The poor and rich, and weak 
and strong, have all one Father. The twin sisters, Piety and Po- 
etry, are wont to dwell together. Speak for, not against, these 
principles. He who teaches, often learns himself. The eye that 
sees all things, sees not itself. James set out early, and, before 
evening, arrived at our house. Boast not, my dear friends, of to- 
morrow. Come hither, Moor. Shame being lost, all virtue is lost. 
Such, in general, is the aspect of the country. At the bottom of 
the garden, a little rivulet ran. When beggars die, there are no 
comets seen. Such as the tree is, such will be the fruit. Man was 
created to search for truth, to love the beautiful, to desire what is 
good, and to do the best. 

2-4. Passion overcomes shame; boldness, fear; and madness, 
reason. Economy is no disgrace ; for it is better to live on a little 
than to outlive a great deal. Religion must be the spirit of every 
hour ; but it can not be the meditation of every hour. The noblest 
prophets and apostles have been children once; lisping the speech, 
laughing the laugh, thinking the thought, of boyhood. If we think 
of glory in the field; of wisdom in the cabinet; of the purest 
patriotism ; of the highest integrity, public and private, — the au- 
gust figure of Washington presents itself as the personation of all 
these ideas. Every thing grows old; every thing passes away; 
every thing disappears. Many words are differently spelled in 
English; as, Inquire, enquire; jail, gaol; skeptic, sceptic. To 
rule one&apos;s anger is well ; to prevent it is better. Men&apos;s evil man-

there is a wide difference between regarding ourselves as infallible, 
and being firmly convinced of the truth of our creed. The dis- 
course consisted of two parts : in the first was shown the necessity 
of exercise ; in the second, the advantages that would result from it. 
J. Vra. Webb, jun., Esq., at length became M. D., A. M., A. A. 8. 

5-7. Are there not seasons of spring in the moral world? and is 
not the present age one of them ? You say you will repent to-raor-j 
row ; but are you sure of to-morrow ? Have you one hour in your 
Land? Have you one minute at your disposal? Away, all ye 
ghosts and fiends! to your dark and frightful domains! Alas! 
those happy days are gone! How beautiful is all this visible 
world ! how beautiful in its action and itself! If you will listen, I 
will show you — but stop ! I do not know that you wish to know. 
I take — eh ! oh !— as much exercise — eh ! — as I can, Madam Gout. 
To pull down the false and to build up the true, and to uphold 
what there is of truth in the old, — let this be our aim. You speak 
like a boy, — like a boy who asks for the moon. There are times — 
they only can understand who have known them — when passion is 
dumb, and purest love reigns. I see in this world two heaps — one 
of happiness, and the other of misery. 

8-11. Whether writing prose or verse (for a portion of the book 
is in prose), the author knows both what to blot, and when to 
stop. Consider (and may the consideration sink deep into your 
heart !) the fatal consequences of a wicked life. The captain had 
several men died [who died] in the ship. You must be careful 
(nothing can be well done without care) not to mistake the proper 
use of brackets. [See Parker and Fox&apos;s Grammar.] &quot; Know thy- 
self* is a useful precept. To one who said, U I do not believe that 
there is an honest man in the world,&quot; another replied, &quot; It is im- 
possible that any one man should know all the world, but quite 
possible that one may know himself.&quot; In the New Testament we 
have the following words : &quot; Jesus answered the Jews, c Is it not 
written in your law, — I said, Ye are gods V &quot; &quot; VW~ ^° swear- 
ing will be permitted in this school.&quot; 

12-14. If I&apos;d a throne, I&apos;d freely share it with thee. Go to, I&apos;ll 
no more of &apos;t: it hath made me mad. &apos;Twas sad by fits, by starts 
&apos;twas wild. Whene&apos;er I wander, &apos;twixt the hours of twelve and 
one, &apos;midst forests vast 1 seem to be. A man&apos;s manners often in- 
dicate his morals. Men&apos;s passions, women&apos;s tenderness, and chil- 
dren&apos;s joys affect him not. The sun is the poet&apos;s and the invalid&apos;s 
friend. Mother&apos;s Avag, pretty boy, father&apos;s sorrow, father&apos;s joy. 

The ox&apos;s hide is not good for ladies&apos; gloves. Friend P s lias 

arrived. I am the Lord thy God. . . . Tliou shalt lu*vo no ether

gods before me. Remember the sabbath-day, to keep it holy. 
* * * * For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, .... 
and rested the seventh day : wherefore the Lord blessed the sab- 
bath-day, and hallowed it. 

15- 21. O sailor-boy, sailor-boy! peace to thy s5ul! Life-giving 
Religion conquers keen-eyed Revenge. Soft-eyed cherub-forms 
around thee play. There is a mother-heart in all children, as well 
as a child-heart in all mothers. Ben Jonson was coeval with 
Shakspeare. If, to-day or to-morrow, I be re-instated in my an- 
cient rights, I will punish that ill-bred, low-minded, self-seeking, 
gold-worshiping, man-despising crowd. That aged, matronly 
woman found a glow-worm* in her bonnet. I found my d&amp;y-bookt 
under an apple-tree. t The Creator formed aerial songsters. That 
learned J and beloved child loves every winged thing.

PREFIXES. 1 

A Prefix is a word, or part of a word, placed before 
another to form with it a new word. 

A Prefix usually changes or increases the meaning of a word before 
which it is placed ; as UN, not, in unholy, which means not holy ; though 
it is sometimes used to make a word more euphonious, or agreeable in 
sound, without changing the meaning ; as un in unloose — loose and 
unloose meaning the same thing.

A means at, in, or on; as, afar, at a far or great distance; abed, 

in bed ; ashore, on the shore.

The mistakes that arise from the use of wrong prepositions after these 
words, are very numerous. The more the distinction in the use and 
signification of words is weighed and attended to, the more clearly and 
forcibly shall pupils learn to speak or write. They should be required 
to construct sentences, embracing all the words in the preceding list, 
in which both the correct&quot; and the incorrect use of prepositions shall be 
given. To illustrate the manner in which sentences may thus be con- 
structed, we introduce the following 

Dictation Exercises. 

He was averse to [not from] such an undertaking. His abhor- 
rence of [not with] that deed, moved him to accede to her request. 
Abstain from the use of rum. He was accused of a crime by his 
cousin. Those streams abound in fish. Agree to what he has done. 
Actions should correspond with words. This thing corresponds to 
that. Initiate my son in spelling. Initiate him into our club. 
She will die of a disease ; but he, by the sword. I will trust in 
the Lord, though I am not worthy of the least of his mercies.

The salient features of these works which have combined to [render them so popular 
may bo briefly recapitulated as follows ; 

1. THE WORD BUILDING SYSTEM.— This famous progressive method for 
young children originated and was copyrighted with these books. It constitutes a 
process by which the beginner with words of one letter is gradually introduced to 
additional lists formed by prefixing or affixing single letters, and is thus led almost 
insensibly to the mastery of the more difficult constructions. This is justly regarded 
as one of the moit striking modern improvements iu methods of teaching. 

2. TREATMENT OF PRONUNCIATION.-The wants of the youngest scholar 
In this department are not overlooked It may be said that from the first lesson tha 
student by this method need never be at a loss for a prompt and accurate render* 
ing of every word encountered.

The National Series of Standard School- Books, 

ORTHOGRAPHY AND READlNG-Continued. 

4. PUNCTUATION is inculcated by a series of interesting reading lessons, the 
simple perusal of which suffices to fix its principles indelibly upon the mind. 

5. ELOCUTION. Each of the higher Readers (3d, 4th and 5th) contains elaborate, 
scholarly, and thoroughly practical treatises on elocution. This feature alone has 
secured for the series many of its warmest friends. 

6. THE SELECTIONS are the crowning glory of the series. Without exceptioa , 
it may be said that no volumes of the same size and character contain a collection so &apos; 
diversified, judicious, and artistic as this. It embraces the choicest gems of English 
literature, so arranged a* to afford the reader ample exercise in every department of 
style. So acceptable has the taste of the authors in this department proved, not only 
to the educational public but to the reading community at large, that thousands of 
copies of the Fourth and Fifth Readers have found their way into public and private 
libraries throughout the country, where they are in constant use as manuals of liter- 
ature, for reference as well as perusal. 

7. ARRANGEMENT. The exercises are so arranged as to present constantly al- 
ternating practice in the different styles of composition, while observing a definita 
plan of progression or gradation throughout the whole. In the higher books the ar- 
ticles are placed in formal sections and classified topically, thus concentrating the in- 
terest and inculcating a principle of association likely to prove valuable in subsequent 
general reading. 

8. NOTES AND BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES. These are full and adequate 
to every want. The biographical sketches present in pleasing style the history of 
every author laid under contribution. 

9. ILLUSTRATIONS. These are plentiful, almost profuse, and of the highest 
character of art. They are found in every volume of the series as far as and including 
the Third Reader. 

10. THE GRADATION is perfect. Each volume overlaps its companion pre- 
ceding or following in the series, so that the scholar, in passing from one to another, 
Is barely conscious, save by the presence of the new book, of the transition. 

11. THE PRICE is reasonable. The books were not trimmed to the minimum 
of size la order that the publishers might be able to denominate them &quot; the cheapest 
in the market,&quot; but were made large enough to cover and suffice for the grade indi- 
cated by the respective numbers. Thus the child is not compelled to go over his First 
Reader twice, or be driven into the Second before he is prepared for it. The compe- 
tent teachers who compiled the series made each volume just what it should be, leav- 
ing it for their brethren who should use the books to decide what constitutes true 
cheapness. A glance over the books will satisfy any one that the same amount of 
matter is nowhere furnished at a price more reasonable. Besides which another con- 
sideration enters into the question of relative economy, namely, the 

12. BINDING-. By the use of a material and process known only to themselves, 
in common with all the publications of this house, the National Readers are warranted 
to out-last any with which they may be compared— the ratio of relative durability be- 
ing in their favor as two to one.

Parker&amp;Watson&apos;s National Series of Readers 

TESTIMONIALS. 

From, Hon. T A. Parker, State Sup&apos;t of Public Instruction, Missouri 

By authority of law it becomes my duty to recommend a list of Text-books for use 
In the Public Schools of Missouri I deem it necessary to approve a list of books 
which will secure to the youth of the State a uniform, cheap, a?id practical course of 
study, and after careful examination have selected the following: The National 
Readers and Spellers, Monteith&amp;McNally&apos;s Geographies, Peck&apos;s Ganot&apos;s Natural 
Philosophy, Jan-is 1 Physiology and Health,&amp;c,&amp;c. 

From Sam&apos;l P Bates LL.D., Asst. Supt. Public Schools of Pennsylvania. 

\ find that your series of Parker&amp;Watson&apos;s National Readers aro going into use ia 
•11 our leading Normal Schools. They are unquestionably ahead of any thing yet pub- 
lished. 

From A. J. Haile, Prin. Hebrew Educational Institute, Memphis, Tennessee. 

1 take great pleasure in bearing testimony to the superior merits of Parker&amp;&quot;Wat* 
son&apos;s Series of &quot; National Readers.&quot; 

From Prof. F. S. Jewell, of the Neio York State Normal School. 

It gives me pleasure to find in the National Series of School-Readers ample room 
for commendation From a brief examination, I am led to believe that we have none 
equal to them. I hope they will prove as popular as they are excellent. 

From Moses T. Brown, Superintendent Public Schools, Toledo, Ohio. 

The different Series of other authors were critically examined by our Board of 
Education and myself, and the decision was unanimous in favor of the National 
Series. Our teachers are delighted with the books, and none more so than our pri- 
mary teachers. J consider the Series better adapted to our graded school system than 
any other now before the public. 

From &quot;War. B. Ames, Superintendent of Schools, Morris, Connecticut. 

They are well adapted to all degrees of scholarship — one lesson prepares the mind 
of the pupil for the next in consecutive order, from book to book — till the highest or* 
der of English composition is attained in the Fifth Reader. 

From Joiin S. Hart, Prin. N. J. State Normal School. 

I approve of Parker&lt;fc &quot;Watson&apos;s Readers highly. The selections are judicious, tha 
arrangement good, and the books well made mechanically. We have adopted the 3d, 
4th, and 5th of the Series in this school. 

From R. P. Deckard, President Ewing College, La Grange, Texas. 

I think the National Series of Readers the best I have seen. 

Extracts from Report made to the California State Teachers&apos; 1 Association. 

The Committee, in presenting to this Convention the Series of Readers by Parker&amp;Watson, would state that, regarded as a whole, we would give our unqualified sup 
port to them in prefei&apos;ence to all others. 

From B. J. Young, Superintendent Schools, Shelbyville, Illinois. 

The National Readers have been selected for use in the public schools of this cilr, 
and are giving very excellent satisfaction. During ten years&apos; experience in teaching, 
i have found no books so well adapted to secure rapid and thorough progress. 

From the Wilmington (N. C.) Daily Herald. 

The National Series has attained probably a higher reputation than any other com 
plete series of School- Books in existence.

The superiority of these Work*.- &apos;&lt;the simplicity, thoroughness, practicability, and 
completeness of their Elocutionary lustru* ion; in the amount and value of the Historical, 
Classical, Biographical, and other infoj.-qa.&apos; jh, ill nibbed by Botes ; in the extent and quality 
of the Selections for Reading and Declaration ; in their exact and full course of instruction 
in Pronunciation ; and iu their uniform Progressiveness,— is urged by many of the ablesl 
educators of the United States. It is not roo much to say that their Pictorial Illustration* 
and Typography far surpass thoso of any similar books published iu this country, and prob- 
ably in the world.
