Last week, Savings.com blogger Allegra clued us into KFC&apos;s misguided 
attempt to do something nice: selling huge sodas for a diabetes charity .
 Needless to say, their move did not not create the desired reaction, and laughs were had by (nearly) all.

 Now that Christmas is over, it&apos;s time to ramp up for the other big celebration: New Year&apos;s Eve. We know that restaurants and bars take advantage of this holiday by raising prices on dinners and drinks and calling them &quot;package deals&quot; Some people can afford it and are willing to go all out on December 31st, but others are looking for something low-key and low-cost.

If you&apos;re in the latter group, I&apos;ve got some ways that you can celebrate NYE without breaking the bank.

 So it&apos;s my third wedding anniversary tonight. We got married just two days after Christmas in a lovely snow covered little chapel in New England. It was beautiful, but now we are stuck celebrating our anniversary every year after already blowing our money on presents for everyone else.

 I shop online all day long with Savings.com, and occasionally I actually leave the house to buy things locally. But from Thanksgiving till Christmas I try to avoid the crowds at the stores as much as possible. And let&apos;s face it, there are plenty of people in this modern world who are not really friends or family members but who you feel compelled to get gifts for.
