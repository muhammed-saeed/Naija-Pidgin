 Three Packaged Facts in-depth market studies...One growing business opportunity 
This Ready-to-Eat and Prepared Foods Market Bundle represents three of our most innovative and best-selling topics related to the food and beverage industry today.
 
 Fresh Convenience Foods in the U.S. 
Fully updated from the December 2007 edition, Fresh Convenience Foods in the U.S. offers a comprehensive look at this complex market. It examines the both myriad types of fresh convenience foods and the myriad retail channels through which they are obtained-from traditional outlets such supermarkets and supercenters/mass merchandisers to such increasingly dynamic segments as convenience stores, delis and local food outlets, drugstores, the Internet, and even food carts.
This full updated report details the complex changes that have taken place in the market since the previous edition, with new attention to competition by retail sector. Using Symphony/IRI mass-market sales tracking data, it offers detailed accounts of sales and marketer/brand activity across 17 refrigerated product segments, from lunch kits and dinners/entrees to fresh soup and side dishes, while diving into selected segments using SPINSscan data for natural supermarket channel. The report projects sales, market growth drivers, and competitive opportunities, including an extensive account of the battle with the foodservice industry for consumer dollars that details the staggering-and still growing-assortment of menu and marketing trends shaping the industry.
 Prepared Food and Ready-to-Eat Foods at Retail: The New Competition to Foodservice 

Packaged Facts&apos; new report, Prepared Food and Ready-to-Eat Foods at Retail: The New Competition to Foodservice offers the foodservice and retail industries new insight into the highly competitive prepared and ready-to-eat foods space. Relying heavily on proprietary consumer research analysis, the report provides &quot;consumer drilldowns&quot; and psychographic profiling, offering foodservice operators and retailers unique access to the minds of prepared foods consumers. 

And by assessing the relationship between fast food, family, and casual restaurant attitudes and behavior with that of grocery store and convenience store prepared foods attitudes and behavior, this report also offers unique competitive analysis to help players align and differentiate their product offerings.
 Frozen Convenience Foods in the U.S. 

Specifically, the mammoth frozen pizza category and the spunky hand-held breakfast category have both found a way to go head-to-head with restaurants; and the prepared vegetable category has been able to triumph on the freshness front via the development of steaming techniques. According to Packaged Facts, these three categories have led the way sales-wise, enabling an otherwise ambivalent market for frozen convenience foods to grow by a modest 2.0% in 2010 to reach sales of $16.8 billion. Packaged Facts expects that marketers in other categories will soon adopt similar strategies, driving sales of fresh convenience foods up another 10% by 2015, to $18.6 billion.
Fully updated from the 2007 edition, Frozen Convenience Foods in the U.S. offers a comprehensive look at this complex market in the context of how it competes with the parallel fresh convenience food market, restaurant takeout, and meals prepared from scratch by consumers. It contains in-depth analysis of Internet marketing, including detailed accounts of marketing on social networking sites like Facebook. The report also details the complex changes that have taken place in the market since the previous edition, with new attention to competition by retail sector, including supermarkets, supercenters/mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, small marts and Internet.

 Chapter 2: Prepared Foods Macroeconomic Analysis 

In this section, Packaged Facts provides directional analysis on the effects key macroeconomic drivers are 
 having on RTE foods found at convenience stores, gas stations, grocery stores and supermarkets. We frame 
 analysis within the broader context of the foodservice market. While key macroeconomic drivers have begun 
 moving in a more positive direction, Packaged Facts believes consumers will remained pressured through 
 2010. While Q1 2010 restaurant spending shows life, we do not believe it is sustainable without changes in the 
employment and housing markets. Longer-term trends continue to favor food retail.

 Sales at food services and drinking places tick upward in February and March 2010 

The National Restaurant Association’s more upbeat outlook is supported by data from the U.S Census. Below, 
 Packaged Facts compares monthly sales with year-earlier monthly sales, which reveals that March 2010 (non-adjusted) 
 food services and drinking places sales were 2.7% higher than March 2009 sales. When adjusted for seasonal variations 
and holiday and trading-day differences, sales rose by 2.9%.

However, March 2010 (non-adjusted) grocery store sales were 5.3% higher than those estimated for March 2009. On an 
 adjusted basis, sales rose by 3.1%. 
 So, while growing springtime sales may have buoyed restaurants, grocery stores sales have not only kept pace, but so 
 far in 2010 they have actually grown at a faster pace.

 Packaged Facts’Consumer Restaurant Tracker: home meal use gains ground 

And, as suggested by Packaged Facts’Consumer Restaurant Tracker, consumers report continuing to shift their food 
 spending into the home, as illustrated by the graph below. Data are derived from Packaged Facts’February 2010 
 proprietary restaurant tracking survey.

Compared to“three months ago,”about 50% of respondent adult (18+) restaurant goers say they are more likely 
 to eat dinner at home—with almost one-third doing so“a lot more.”
39% say they are eating breakfast at home more than they were three months ago—with almost 3 in 10 doing so“a lot more.”
Conversely, restaurant goers are less likely to be using or spending on a range of restaurant options. 
 Of course, much of this behavior is related to cost: to save money, consumers are bringing their food spend back into 
the home, after decades of doing the opposite.

And one key barometer, the Consumer Price Index, supports the rationale, as it shows“food at home”prices not only
 declining during the recession, but also being cheaper than“food away from home”(see the Food at home gains
 pricing edge section below).

 Recessionary Decline in Restaurant Traffic a Plus for Fresh Convenience Foods 

The results of Packaged Facts’consumer survey support the conclusion presented earlier in 
 this report—that key to fresh convenience food market growth in the face of the 2008/2009“Great Recession”and still-iffy U.S. economy is the trend whereby consumers have traded
 down from restaurant meals in favor of fresh prepared foods. Since the recession began, 49% 
 of the adults surveyed reported that they had eaten less at fast-food restaurants and 50% said 
 they’d eaten less fast-food takeout, while 61% said they’d eaten less at sit-down restaurants. 
 Conversely, the percent of adults who strongly agreed that they were spending less on 
 groceries because of the economy was only 15%, while another 28% somewhat agreed. In 
 other words, restaurants experienced a significant drop-off in consumer demand even as 
relatively few consumers cut back on grocery spending. [Figure 1-2]


 18% of U.S. Consumers Are Buying More Fresh Prepared Foods 

Packaged Facts also asked its consumer panel if they had eaten more fresh prepared food 
 since the recession began, with 18% responding that they had. While not directly parallel 
 (since the question is in the past tense), it does pose an interesting contrast to the combined 
 total of 13% of consumers who said they would spend a little or a lot more on fast food, 
 restaurant dining, and takeout from those outlets in the following three months, as discussed 
above, since the figures imply a gradual swing back in the restaurant direction.

 Entrees Top Unpackaged Foods Chart 

Based on data from sources including SymphonyIRI and FreshLook Marketing Group 
 (FLM—Hoffman Estates, IL), the first syndicated scanner-based database to track perishable 
 categories, Packaged Facts estimates that entrees account for the largest share of unpackaged 
 fresh convenience food sales, at 30%, followed by sandwiches/pizza (22%), appetizers&amp;trays (18%), and salads (16%). However, as discussed elsewhere in this report, it is important...
