 McMenu ?Do-It-Yourself McDonalds Restaurant Recipes (All products copyrighted by the McDonald&apos;s Corporation) - XAM2001 - Page 2 Important Cooking Tips The All Beef Patties The ground beef you use is a critical factor in duplicating the McFlavor. McDonald&apos;s uses only USDA certified 100% ground beef. Well, if your supermarket is like mine, there are 5 or 6 different kinds to choose from. Ground round? Ground Sirloin? Ultra-lean? Ground beef? Ground Chuck? McDonald&apos;s uses ground chuck. This is the exact fat to lean ratio. Ground chuck is 80% lean. So if your supermarket doesn&apos;t offer ground chuck, then buy ground beef that&apos;s 80% lean. It is the same. Searing The Beef Patties A very important step to recreating the McDonald&apos;s burger flavor is searing them properly. Searing is the process of applying pressure to the frozen patties as they cook on the griddle. This is done about 20 seconds after laying the patties on the grill by pressing down with the back of a spatula, while adding pressure from your free hand. Press down firmly for about 2-3 seconds on regular sized patties, and 5-6 seconds on quarter pound patties. Searing seals in the juices and flavors. But it also makes the burger hard to turn. Properly seared patties will stick to the griddle, and you must actually &quot;cut&quot; the meat off of the surface as you turn them. Non-stick surfaces help, but they also make it hard to get the even dark searing you need for great McBurgers. I suggest a cooking surface that is not non-stick... and a very strong, sharp spatula. Seasoning your Hamburgers Use the Special Seasoning described in this site, and use it liberally. Don&apos;t be stingy, put a lot on the patties while they&apos;re cooking. A good amount of it will &quot;float&quot; away with the fat. This is an important factor in the &quot;McFlavor.&quot; You&apos;ll need to use even more on the Quarter-Pounder patties. Toasting the Buns The buns on all of the McDonald&apos;s burgers must be toasted. (The only exception is the Filet-O-Fish?. This is done by laying the buns face down on a pre-heated 375?electric griddle. You need to apply light pressure to the buns in order to achieve uniform, even toasting. This toasting process only takes about a minute. The buns can be toasted in advance, tops (crowns) and bottoms (heels). They will be re-heated anyway. Toasting them in advance allows you extra time to dress them, as the meat patties cook very fast. Dressing your Burgers Each recipe is very specific in regards to what condiments are added to the bun. The amounts vary depending upon what recipe you are performing. On the burgers that use ketchup and mustard, the mustard is always applied first. Five small &quot;kisses&quot; the diameter of a pencil go evenly around the toasted crown (top) of the bun about 1/2 inch from the edge. (If you connected the dots, it would make a pentagon) The ketchup also is applied using five &quot;squirts&quot;. The diameter is much larger, about the size of a nickel. And the pattern is easy - four evenly spaced &quot;squirts&quot; around the edge of the crown, and one in the middle. It should look like what a &quot;5&quot; looks like on dice. For the other condiments, consult the specific recipe you are making. The Ketchup From the 1950&apos;s through 1980, McDonald&apos;s used Hunt&apos;s?tomato catsup. In 1980 the company proceeded with plans to produce all of their condiments at their own plants. Hunt&apos;s?lost a big account, and it nearly threw them into bankruptcy. McDonald&apos;s basically did what you&apos;re doing by visiting this site: They cloned Hunt&apos;s?catsup. Hunt&apos;s?catsup (they now spell it ketchup) has a subtle, tangy zip that Heinz?doesn&apos;t have. This is due to an extra ingredient not found in Heinz?- garlic powder. It is also a little thinner in consistency, allowing for better coverage on your burgers. The Mustard McDonald&apos;s hamburgers uses such a small amount of mustard, honestly any classic yellow mustard will work just fine. For you die-hards, I suggest French&apos;s?classic yellow. Once again, French&apos;s?contains an ingredient that adds a small, extra zip to the flavor. You got it: garlic powder.

 McMenu ?Do-It-Yourself McDonalds Restaurant Recipes (All products copyrighted by the McDonald&apos;s Corporation) - XAM2001 - Page 3 The Pickles McDonald&apos;s uses a very distinctive, tart dill slice. The only products that come close are Heinz?Genuine Dills (original sour dill) Vlasic?Original Dills (not kosher dills) Of the two, Heinz?is the closest to McDonald&apos;s , but Vlasic?is fairly close. The problem is that neither of these pickle products come pre-sliced, so you&apos;ll have to slice them yourself. Slice them very thin. I suggest a consumer mandolin like the K-Tel?Dial-A-Slice. You can do it with a knife, but keeping it uniformly thin is tough. Also, these pickles are made of fairly small cucumbers, so slice them at an angle to get larger diameter dill slices. The Onions The regular Hamburgers, the Big Mac? and the Breakfast Burrito all use reconstituted onions. You can buy these at your local supermarket in the spice aisle. Just look for dried chopped onion. Make sure they are chopped onion, and not minced. To re-hydrate or reconstitute these dried onions, simply add 4 parts water to one part dried onion, cover, and refrigerate 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, drain the liquid and BAM - there they are! McDonald&apos;s little baby onions. Use the proper amount needed for your recipe , and refrigerate (covered) the leftovers. &quot;Q-ing&quot; Methods &quot;Q-ing&quot; was a McDonald&apos;s term for helping the flavors to meld via mechanical means; for example - heat lamp or microwave. Wrapping your Burgers Use waxed paper. The regular sized burgers require a sheet about 12&quot;x12&quot; square. The bigger burgers are better with 12&quot;x16&quot; sheets. (Big Macs?require about 12&quot;x18&quot;) Wrap them by laying the finished burger upside down in the center of the waxed paper. Fold two sides so they overlap. It will resemble an oblong tube with the burger in the middle, and two open ends. (with the seam on the bottom) Fold the open ends underneath the burger tightly. The burger is now wrapped. The Big Mac?is done differently. Place it in the center of the waxed paper right side up. Then fold two sides of the waxed paper up over the top, again creating an oblong &quot;tube&quot;. With the seam on top, fold the two other ends underneath. Re-Heating your Burgers Another important step to getting that &quot;McFlavor&quot; is the re-heating process. Many of today&apos;s McDonald&apos;s have stopped microwaving, but the ones that still do usually over microwave them. This makes them absolutely horrible. What most stores are doing now is disgusting. They pre-cook the meat and toss it in a tub that is a &quot;warming drawer&quot;. They also keep the buns warm that way. Then they make your burger when you order it. Sorry - but even the most sterile environments will allow bacteria to grow on food. If you have recently found yourself having to run to the toilet, sit down, and evacuate yourself like Jeff Daniels did in the movie &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; about an hour after downing a Big Mac? it is because the food sits there too long. Turns out, the heat lamps weren&apos;t that bad. At properly managed McDonald&apos;s stores, the food was thrown out, or &quot;wasted&quot; after 10 minutes wrapped under the heat lamps. Now a days... who knows how long the meat patties are festering in an incubator they call a &quot;warming drawer&quot;? Re-Heating at Home You can use your oven as a &quot;heat lamp&quot; substitute by wrapping the burgers in waxed paper and placing them in an oven set to &quot;warm&quot; for 5-10 minutes. I suggest you actually microwave these burgers, while still wrapped, no more than 15 seconds each. If you have a nice, high-powered microwave like I do... you can do 4 of them at 30 seconds and they&apos;ll come out perfect. Remember... don&apos;t over microwave them.

 McMenu ?Do-It-Yourself McDonalds Restaurant Recipes (All products copyrighted by the McDonald&apos;s Corporation) - XAM2001 - Page 4 McDonald&apos;s Hamburger Seasoning Use THIS seasoning on ALL McDonald&apos;s hamburgers. 4 tablespoons salt 2 tablespoons Accent?(MSG) 1 teaspoon ground black pepper 1/4 teaspoon onion powder Mix all ingredients well. Use in a spice shaker with big enough holes for the pepper to flow. This seasoning is used liberally on all McDonald&apos;s hamburgers during the COOKING process. McDonald&apos;s Big X-Tra?Seasoning 3 tablespoons Lawry&apos;s?seasoned salt 3 teaspoons Jollytime?Buttery seasoning 1 crushed beef bullion cube 1/4 teaspoon black pepper This seasoning is used exclusively on the Big X-Tra? Scrambling Eggs at McDonald&apos;s Years ago, we scrambled 8 eggs at a time in the milkshake multi-mixers. We added no salt and no pepper. Ways To Correctly Scramble Your Eggs I suggest purchasing the Hamilton Beach?DrinkMasterTM. It is a consumer version of the multi-mixers Ray Kroc sold to the McDonald brothers in the 1950&apos;s. You can also use this appliance to make perfect McDonald&apos;s milkshakes. (I got mine at Wal-Mart for about $25 and love it) Alternatives for scrambling your eggs , in order of preference Hand-held blender Standard blender Shaker method Wire whisk DrinkMasterTM Instructions Crack desired number of eggs into the silver, mixing cup that comes with the DrinkMasterTM. Scramble at least 4, and no more than 8. Follow the DrinkMasterTM instructions for quick mixing. Do not add seasoning. Scramble the eggs 30-45 seconds just prior to cooking time. They will be totally yellow-orange and quite frothy. That is the key to McDonald&apos;s scrambled eggs - the foamy/frothy consistency caused by using the DrinkMasterTM, followed by cooking immediately after scrambling. Hand-Held Blender Instructions Crack the amount of eggs you need into a small mixing bowl, and blend with the hand-held blender on its highest setting for 30-45 seconds. See above for the desired result. Cook immediately. Standard Blender Instructions Crack the desired amount of eggs into the pitcher and use the liquefy button. Blend 30-45 seconds until the eggs are one solid color, and very frothy. Cook immediately. Shaker Instructions Crack the needed amount of eggs into a Tupperware?type container, close the lid, and shake it vigorously for about 2 minutes. Your arms should be very, very tired. Cook immediately. Wire Whisk Instructions Do it like mom taught you, but make sure there are no streaks of whites. I don&apos;t suggest using this method, as it will lack the froth you need.

 McMenu ?Do-It-Yourself McDonalds Restaurant Recipes (All products copyrighted by the McDonald&apos;s Corporation) - XAM2001 - Page 5 Regular Hamburger The McDonald&apos;s regular hamburger is the one that got it all started in 1948. It&apos;s as basic as can be... yet the ones they serve today don&apos;t even taste CLOSE! Make them exactly as I instruct, and you can enjoy that long- lost flavor once again. (In the mid 80&apos;s, McDonald&apos;s began cooking both sides of the meat at the same time. This was to cut cooking time in half. But it also forever changed the flavor of the original hamburgers - ALL of them!) Ray Kroc discovered the McDonald brother&apos;s San Bernardino, California restaurant in 1954 while selling multi- mixers. (milk-shake machines) He was so impressed with their methods, he struck up a franchise deal, and in 1955 opened his first store in De Plaines Illinois. Oh, and he went on to earn multi-millions. &quot;Ten Regs please&quot;... &quot;Ten Regs, thank you&quot; (An old production call for ten burgers) Ingredients 1 Pound ground chuck (80% lean) 10 Small hamburger buns 10 Hamburger dill slices 10 teaspoons dried, chopped onion McDonald&apos;s Hamburger Seasoning Mustard, Ketchup... and... waxed paper The Hamburger Seasoning 4 tablespoons salt 2 tablespoons Accent?(MSG) 1 teaspoon ground black pepper 1/4 teaspoon onion powder Mix all ingredients well in a spice shaker with big enough holes to allow pepper to flow. Makes about 3 ounces. Use on ALL McDonald&apos;s hamburgers. (unless you&apos;re allergic to MSG, then just use salt and pepper) The Beef Patties Divide 1 lb of beef into 10 equal sized balls. Form a patty out of each ball about 4 inches in diameter and 1/4 inch thick. Do this on waxed paper. Now freeze the patties for at least an hour. (this keeps them from falling apart when you grill them) Obviously you&apos;ll do this in advance of &quot;burger time&quot;. It is pretty tough to make patties this small, so if you come up with 9 patties, I&apos;ll forgive you. The Onions Put the dried onions in a container, oh.. like Tupperware... and add water. Water should be a few inches over the top of the onions. (better to have too much water than not enough) Cover, and refrigerate about 1/2 hour. Drain the liquid, and BAM... you have McDonald&apos;s little baby onions. Cover again and refrigerate until &apos;burger time&apos;. The Pickles McDonald&apos;s pickle slices are unique in flavor, very sour dills. The only product I know of that comes close to the distinctive flavor is HEINZ Genuine Dills. (original sour dill) But they don&apos;t come in slices, so slice your own VERY thin. I can&apos;t do it very well with a knife, so I use a K-Tel &quot;dial-a-slice&quot; home vegetable slicer. ALSO... Vlasic &quot;original&quot; dills have that tart flavor. Make sure they&apos;re not &quot;kosher&quot; dills. Wal-Mart?carries Vlasic ORIGINAL dills, and you have to slice those too. (note, these pickles are pretty small, so slice at an angle... you&apos;ll get bigger dill chips) USE THESE PICKLES ON ALL McDonald&apos;s HAMBURGERS! The Buns Use the small, plain cheapo store brand hamburger buns. You know, they come 8 or 12 in a pack. - usually about 59 to 69 cents for a pack of 8. (You&apos;ll want to separate the tops, or &quot;crowns&quot; from the bottoms, or &quot;heels&quot;... as most likely they&apos;ll be connected slightly on one edge) When it&apos;s &quot;burger time&quot;, you&apos;ll be toasting the buns. Those instructions are 
 Page 6 
 McMenu ?Do-It-Yourself McDonalds Restaurant Recipes (All products copyrighted by the McDonald&apos;s Corporation) - XAM2001 - Page 6 coming up. WalMart?sells a great product for regular buns - Great ValueTM brand &quot;jumbo&quot; hamburger buns. They&apos;re almost exactly like McDonald&apos;s buns and a little bigger than the other hamburger buns available at your supermarket. Cooking Your Hamburgers Pre-heat your oven to warm - its lowest level, this is for later. You&apos;re going to need two electric griddles - one to grill the meat, the other to toast the buns. Pre-heat the meat griddle to 375-400? and the bun griddle to about 350? (this recipe has you cooking four at a time) Note: before starting, make sure to have all of your condiments READY (because this all happens very fast) 1. Toast the crowns of 4 buns (tops) Do this by laying them face down on the griddle closely together. Put a Dutch oven (pot) bottom side down directly on top of the buns. (open side facing up) This is only to apply hands-free pressure to the buns so they will toast evenly. (Don&apos;t use anything TOO heavy like cast iron. You&apos;ll smash the buns) 2. Lay the frozen patties on the other grill. After about 20 seconds, &quot;sear&quot; them by applying even pressure with the back of a metal spatula, and pushing down on the front with your free hand. (careful not to burn your fingers) Do this only for about 2 seconds... you should hear them sizzle louder while you &quot;sear&quot; them. After searing them, sprinkle generously with McDonald&apos;s burger seasoning. 3. At this point, your buns are nearly done. They will have an even tan color when finished. Remove them, and repeat the &quot;bun toasting&quot; process with the heels. (bottoms) 4. After about one minute since searing the patties, turn them over. Careful, don&apos;t tear the side you seared. Add another dash of Seasoning and about a teaspoon of your prepared onions. (Don&apos;t be anal and use a measuring spoon... no time... just two fingers and a thumb full) 5. Now quickly dress your buns. (crown, or top side) Mustard first... five &quot;kisses&quot; the diameter of a pencil evenly spaced in a circle about a half-inch from the edge. Then the Ketchup, (use Hunt&apos;s if you can) five squirts the size of a nickel.. in the pattern found on dice. Place the pickle in the middle. 6. By the time you finish that, the meat will be done. (about 1 minute or 1:10 after turning) Remove the meat and tilt to the side to allow excess fat to drain off. Use your free hand to hold down the onions. Place patties onion side up on the dressed crown, top with toasted heels. (the burger will be upside-down) 7. Lay one finished hamburger, still upside-down, in the center of your pre-cut waxed paper. Wrap the paper around the burger tightly. It should resemble a very oblong tube with two open ends, and the burger in the middle. Then wrap the open ends underneath the bottom of the burger so it is enclosed tightly. &quot;Q-ing&quot; Methods &quot;Q-ing&quot; was a McDonald&apos;s term for helping the flavors to meld via mechanical means; i.e. heat lamp or microwave. 1. Place wrapped hamburger in your pre-heated oven. (remember... oven is just barely on warm) Keep them in there about 8-10 minutes. Hey! That&apos;s enough time to cook another batch. (if you do cook another batch while these are &quot;aging properly&quot;, scrape the black stuff and burnt onions to the side before beginning) Important note: Some ovens get too hot even on low, and this may dry out your burger. If they seem dry try the alternative &quot;Q-ing&quot; method below. 2. An alternate &quot;Q-ing&quot; method would be to wrap the sandwich tightly in wax paper, let sit for 5 minutes, and microwave on high for 15 seconds (while still wrapped) This will complete the &quot;Q-ing&quot; process without over microwaving them like they do now. In fact, they almost taste better this way. In fact, you can use this method on ALL of the burger recipes on this site, with the exception of the McD.L.T. ENJOY! This is how they used to be. This is how they were MEANT to be. (You might consider toasting your buns first, at least the crowns, to give you extra time to dress them)

 McMenu ?Do-It-Yourself McDonalds Restaurant Recipes (All products copyrighted by the McDonald&apos;s Corporation) - XAM2001 - Page 7 Quarter Pounder Ingredients 1 Topp&apos;s 1/4 lb frozen beef patty 1 sesame seed bun 1 tablespoon fresh onion... diced mustard, ketchup 2 HEINZ hamburger slices (pickles) 2 slices real American cheese (optional) McDonald&apos;s Hamburger Seasoning Beef Patty Alternative If you can&apos;t find Topp&apos;sTM 1/4 pound patties, use one pound ground chuck, divide into 4 equal pieces, and form the patties about 5&quot; diameter and 1/4&quot; thick. Do this on wax paper, and freeze until needed. Cooking Your Quarter PounderTM Pre-heat an electric grill to 400 degrees. (If cooking more than one... also pre-heat an electric grill for toasting the sesame seed buns) Lay the beef frozen patty on the grill, and after about 20 seconds, &quot;sear&quot; it. Sear a little harder and a little longer than with regular hamburgers. You should apply heavy pressure for 6-8 seconds. Sprinkle liberally with McD&apos;s Hamburger Seasoning. (see regular burgers to make that) About 2_-3 minutes after searing, turn. Be careful not to tear the sear you just created. Add another dash Seasoning. Lay the crown of the bun facedown on an unused, clean portion of the grill. It will toast very quickly, so move it around in a circular motion to prevent burning. After about 30 seconds the bun will be toasted enough. Remove to dress, and lay the heel facedown to the same spot on the grill. (If cooking more than one, follow the bun toasting instructions for the regular hamburger) Dressing The Bun Put five &quot;kisses&quot; of mustard around the toasted crown about 1/2 inch from the edge, equally spaced. Then put five squirts of ketchup in the pattern of a five on dice and the size of a nickel on the toasted bun. (Make the center one the size of a quarter) Add about a tablespoon of freshly chopped white onion, and the two pickle slices, evenly spaced. If you&apos;re making a Quarter-Pounder with CheeseTM, lay one slice of real American cheese on top of the condiments. Most cheese slices are slightly too big, so cut or tear off about 1/4 inch, making a slight rectangle. By now... your meat should be done. (about 2-3 more minutes after turning) Smash the beef patty with the spatula to &quot;squeeze&quot; out excess fat, and then remove. Smash it again between the spatula and your free hand to additionally drain the fat. Lay it on top of your dressed crown and add the toasted heel. (If you&apos;re making a Quarter-Pounder with CheeseTM, lay another slice of real American cheese on top of the patty before adding the heel. Position the corners off alignment with the other cheese slice) Wrap it in a pre-cut 12&quot;x12&quot; sheet of waxed paper and either microwave it for 15 seconds, or allow it to be &quot;warmed&quot; in your pre-heated (lowest setting) oven for 8-10 minutes. (or use the alternate &quot;Q-ing&quot; method)

 McMenu ?Do-It-Yourself McDonalds Restaurant Recipes (All products copyrighted by the McDonald&apos;s Corporation) - XAM2001 - Page 8 Cheeseburger Cook the burgers using the regular hamburger recipe and place one THIN slice of American cheese on the crown side before adding meat patty. Don&apos;t use Kraft singles or Velveeta. (or anything termed as &quot;American processed cheese FOOD) Use only real American cheese. That is KEY! Please Note: Most slices of American cheese are too big for McDonald&apos;s cheeseburgers. So take about 1/4&quot; off two edges to make a smaller square. Bacon Double-Cheeseburger Ingredients 2 prepared beef patties 1 prepared bun 2 American cheese slices 1 slice Oscar Mayer?Ready-MadeTM bacon Prepare the beef patties and buns as directed in the regular hamburger recipe . Dress the bun the same way. Microwave the pre-cooked bacon for about 15-20 seconds, tear it in half, and lay the pieces side by side on the dressed crown. Follow that with one slice of cheese. Put cooked beef patty 1 on top of the cheese, add another slice of cheese and then beef patty 2. Add the toasted heel and wrap in a 12&quot;x16&quot; sheet of waxed paper. (see cooking regular hamburgers for wrapping directions) Let sit for 5-7 minutes, then microwave (still wrapped) for 15 seconds until hot.

It should toast quickly and will have an even light-brown color when done. After toasting, set the toasted bun aside. On the same grill surface, cook the beef patty the same way as a Quarter-Pounder?(see cooking instructions for the Quarter Pounder? Dress Your Bun On the crown half, apply mustard, ketchup, and onions as described in the Quarter-PounderTM recipe . Then add 3 pickle slices, the lettuce, followed by 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise. Top that with the tomato, then the slice of cheese. (This can be done, and should be done 10-15 minutes before the beef is cooked) Place in the refrigerator. When the beef is done, put it on the heel side of the bun. Then get the dressed crown side out of the fridge, slap the two together, and BAM - a no longer available McD.L.TTM!

There better be no streaks! Microwave 25 seconds, and stir well again. Cover, and refrigerate at LEAST 1 hour before using. (to allow all of the flavors to &quot;meld&quot;) Makes nearly 1 cup... enough for about 8 Big MacsTM. Ingredients: (per sandwich) 1 regular sized sesame seed bun 1 regular sized plain bun 2 previously frozen regular beef patties 2 tablespoons Big Mac sauce 2 teaspoons reconstituted onions 1 slice real American cheese 2 hamburger pickle slices 1/4 cup shredded iceberg lettuce Cooking your Big MacTM Discard the crown half of the regular bun, retaining the heel. The cooking method for the Big MacTM is basically the same as the regular burgers, only the bun toasting method is slightly different. In the Big Mac&apos;s case you toast the bottom (heel) first. Do this along with the extra heel. (this will be your middle bun) Cook the two-all-beef-patties just like the regular burgers. After the bun parts are toasted, put 1 tablespoon of &quot;Mac sauce&quot; on each of the heels. (toasted side) Then add 1/8 cup shredded lettuce to each. On the true bottom bun, place one thin slice of American cheese on top of the lettuce. On the extra &quot;heel&quot;, the middle bun, place two pickle slices on top of the lettuce. Toast the &quot;crown&quot; (top) of the bun also. When the meat patties are done, place them one at a time on both prepared buns. Stack the middle bun on top of the bottom bun, and put the crown on top. For proper &quot;aging&quot; or &quot;Q-ing&quot;... wrap the finished Big Mac?in a 12&quot;x18&quot; sheet of waxed paper as follows 1. Center the burger, right side up, on the waxed paper. Fold the &quot;long&quot; ends of the paper up over the top. (It will resemble a tube with the burger in the center) 2. Fold the two remaining ends underneath. Wrap snug, but don&apos;t squish it like the regular burgers. 3. Let sit 5-8 minutes, allowing the flavors to &quot;meld&quot;. 4. Microwave, still wrapped, 15 seconds on high. Enjoy an AWESOME Big Mac?Sandwich!

Be careful and stir almost continuously to prevent sticking. You might consider using a double boiler, or microwaving. Cover and refrigerate until needed. The Onions Use a medium-large white onion. Slice it very thin. You&apos;ll use about 2 full slices per sandwich. It may help to use a vegetable slicer, or some sort of device that is designed to make thin slices. (I use the K-Tel?dial-A- SliceTM) The slices should be about 1/8 inch thick. Crosscut the sliced onion into 4 equal portions (total of 8) Think of the onion slice as a pizza that you&apos;re cutting into 4 equal pieces using 2 cuts. Place the pieces in a small bowl, and &quot;toss&quot; to separate. You&apos;ll have a bunch of quarter-moon shaped chopped onions. Set aside. Preparing your Cheddar-Melt 1. Complete the cheese sauce recipe , and chop the onions. 2. Pre-heat an electric griddle to 400? You will be toasting your buns and cooking your beef as described in the Quarter-Pounder recipe . 3. In a small frying pan, saut?your onions with the teriyaki sauce over medium heat, until tender and slightly brown. Use Pam?to prevent sticking. Remove from heat, cover, and set aside. 4. While your beef patties are cooking, microwave the pre-made cheese sauce to warm. Add about 1 tablespoon to the toasted top bun. Place the sautéed onions on next. 5. When the beef patty is done, add it next, then the bottom (heel) bun. (The burger will be upside-down) 6. Wrap in a 12&quot;x16&quot; sheet of waxed paper, and let stand 3-4 minutes. 7. Microwave for about 10-15 seconds, still wrapped, to warm. Do not over microwave. 8. Enjoy a great McDonald&apos;s Quarter-Pound Cheddar-Melt! Serving suggestion Add two slices of cooked bacon in an &quot;X&quot; pattern before adding the beef for a McDonald&apos;s Bacon-Cheddar Melt. An even more limited time offer, as they say.

 McMenu ?Do-It-Yourself McDonalds Restaurant Recipes (All products copyrighted by the McDonald&apos;s Corporation) - XAM2001 - Page 14 Chicken McGrill Sandwich Special Tools Electric double side cooking grill. (Grill? Yeah, right. These products are glorified frying pans) I recommend the George Forman Grill? or Hamilton-Beach?Meal Maker ExpressTM. Any home grilling item that cooks both sides simultaneously will work. Or you can use one of those frying pans with the raised &quot;grill mark&quot; maker. (see below for directions) You&apos;ll also need a meat mallet, and a separate electric griddle (smooth surface) for toasting the buns. Ingredients 2 chicken breast filets 4 large sesame seed buns lettuce, tomato slices, mayonnaise Marinade 1/2 cup water 1/4 cup vegetable oil 2 teaspoons Kraft?grated parmesan cheese 1 teaspoon (or one cube) chicken bullion 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice (from concentrate) 1/4 teaspoon liquid smoke (Wrights?works best) 1/4 teaspoon onion powder 1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper 1/8 teaspoon ground paprika Preparation 1. Prepare the marinade by mixing together the ingredients in a medium sized bowl. Refrigerate until later. 2. Cut the two breast portions in half, creating 4 chicken patties. Pound them with a meat mallet to 3/8&quot; thick, then trim the edges to make as round as possible. They should be about 4&quot; in diameter. 3. Put the finished breast portions in the prepared marinade, poking each 5 or 6 times with a fork. (This allows the marinade to seep inside) Let them soak in the mixture for several hours before cooking. 4. Preheat your George Foreman Grill? or similar product according to manufacturer&apos;s directions. 5. Toast the buns, using McDonald&apos;s method. 6. Lay the breast patties on the bottom of the preheated grilling product, and close the top. Allow to cook 5-8 minutes, depending upon the number you are cooking. 7. Dress the toasted crown (top) of your bun as follows: 1 tablespoon mayonnaise, 1/4 cup chopped iceberg lettuce, one large tomato slice. 8. After the chicken is done, place it on the dressed bun, and cap with the toasted heel. (the chicken should be fairly even in color with no pink in the center) 9. Wrap the finished grilled McChicken?in a large sheet of waxed paper, allow to sit 5 minutes, then microwave 20 seconds to re-heat. (microwave while still wrapped) Frying Pan Instructions If using a frying pan (with raised grill marks), preheat to medium-high and cook the marinated chicken patties as follows 1. Place the chicken on the pan, and sear immediately. (sear by applying pressure for about 5 seconds) 2. Cook 3-4 minutes per side, depending upon the amount and actual temperature of your pan. 3. When the chicken is finished cooking, it will have a fairly even, golden-tan color with no pink in the middle. Proceed as directed above.

 McMenu ?Do-It-Yourself McDonalds Restaurant Recipes (All products copyrighted by the McDonald&apos;s Corporation) - XAM2001 - Page 15 Big-N-Tasty In 2001, McDonald&apos;s introduced a &quot;new&quot; burger, called the Big-N-TastyTM. Guess what? It&apos;s actually the McD.L.T.TM reincarnated! The only thing different is the hot and cold side that the McD.L.T.TM featured. Ingredients 1 TOPPS?1/4 lb frozen beef patty 1 sesame seed bun 1 slice real American cheese 1/4 cup chopped iceberg lettuce 1 fresh tomato slice (2 if small) 1 tablespoon fresh chopped white onion 3 dill pickle slices McDonald&apos;s Hamburger Seasoning Ketchup and mayonnaise Pre-heat an electric griddle to 400? and toast both halves of the bun face down on the griddle. It should toast quickly and will have an even light-brown color when done. After toasting, set the toasted bun aside. On the same grill surface, cook the beef patty the same way as a Quarter-PounderTM (see cooking instructions for the Quarter-PounderTM) Dress your Bun On the crown half, apply the ketchup and onions as described in the Quarter-PounderTM recipe . Then add 3 pickle slices, the lettuce, followed by 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise. Top that with the tomato, then the slice of cheese. (if you want cheese) When the beef is done, put it on the dressed crown and add the toasted heel. Wrap in a 12&quot;x16&quot; sheet of waxed paper and microwave for 12 seconds on high. There you go, a BIG-N-TASTYTM!

 McMenu ?Do-It-Yourself McDonalds Restaurant Recipes (All products copyrighted by the McDonald&apos;s Corporation) - XAM2001 - Page 16 McLean-Deluxe This burger replaced the Mc D.L.T. on the menu back in 1990, and barely lasted 4 years. It was a low-fat, &quot;lean&quot; burger compared with the other McDonald&apos;s burger offerings. (still had a lot of fat, though) They tried a break-through technology that utilized sea-weed extract mixed with the beef to give it more flavor. Such a small percentage was used that it really had no effect on the flavor. It was more of a gimmick to make people think, &quot;wow, a new technology that&apos;ll make a lower fat burger taste great... I gotta try one&quot;. Not surprisingly, the sodium level was nearly double that of the other hamburgers. Another interesting fact is that the seaweed extract was actually a form of monosodium glutamate, or MSG as you may know it, in a seaweed oil base. (seaweed is a vegetable, so basically we&apos;re talking vegetable oil here) Ingredients: (per sandwich) 1/5 pound 92% lean ground beef 1/4 teaspoon Accent?#060;/nobr&gt; 1/8 teaspoon salt, non iodized 1/8 teaspoon olive oil McDonald&apos;s Hamburger Seasoning 1 sesame seed bun 1 tablespoon Hunt&apos;s?ketchup 1 tablespoon Kraft?light mayonnaise 1/2 tablespoon chopped white onion 1/4 cup chopped iceberg lettuce 2-3 Heinz?genuine dill slices 1 tomato slice non-stick cooking spray The Beef Patty 1. Divide 1 pound of beef into 5 equal pieces. Add 1/4 teaspoon of Accent?(MSG), 1/8 teaspoon non-iodized salt, and 1/8 teaspoon olive oil to each. 2. Kneed the beef together to mix the seasoning and oil in thoroughly. Form each piece into a round ball. 3. On waxed paper, press out each meat ball into a round 41/2&quot; diameter patty. 4. Freeze until needed. Cooking your McLean Deluxe 1. Preheat an electric skillet to 400? 2. Toast the Buns 3. Spray the preheated griddle lightly with non-stick spray to prevent sticking, and immediately add the frozen beef patty. 4. About 20 seconds after placing the beef patty on the griddle, SEAR lightly. Sprinkle with a liberal amount of hamburger seasoning. Turn after 2 minutes, being careful not to tear the sear you created. After turning, add another dash of hamburger seasoning. 5. Dress your toasted bun (crown side) in the following order: ketchup, mayonnaise, onion, pickles, lettuce, and tomato. Squirt the ketchup in nickel sized &quot;dabs&quot;, with the pattern resembling the 5 on a dice. 6. 2-3 minutes after turning, remove the cooked beef patty and place on the dressed crown. 7. Apply the heel, and Wrap in a 12&quot;x16&quot; sheet of waxed paper. 8. Allow to sit for 5 minutes then microwave on high for 15 seconds, still wrapped.

 McMenu ?Do-It-Yourself McDonalds Restaurant Recipes (All products copyrighted by the McDonald&apos;s Corporation) - XAM2001 - Page 17 McRib Sandwich The McRib?Sandwich was in the &quot;experimental&quot; stages when I managed at McDonald&apos;s . It&apos;s been 18 years since then and NOW... the McRib?is, well, in the &quot;experimental&quot; stages. God only knows why they haven&apos;t added this &quot;full-time&quot;. If you&apos;re sick of waiting a year or two for them to offer one up... You came to the right place! NOW you can make them at home! Ingredients 1 JTM?Brand &quot;Grillin&apos; Ribs&quot; pork patty 1 6 inch long sandwich bun 2 tablespoons McDonald&apos;s Barbecue sauce (see McNuggets Barbecue Sauce) 1 tablespoon chopped white onion 3 sour dill pickle slices Note: J-T-MTM is the only brand of these pressed and formed pork patties that I&apos;ve seen. They are shaped like a rack of ribs, just like at McDonald&apos;s . I get them at Wal-Mart? Look for them in the frozen meat section, near the pre-formed hamburger patties. Cooking your McRib?#060;/b&gt; 1. Preheat your griddle to 400? Cook the pork patty just like a quarter pound beef patty. (consult the package directions for cooking times and other cooking options) 2. Toast the faces of both halves of the bun, using the bun toasting method described throughout this site. 3. On the toasted crown (top) half, apply the ready mixed barbecue sauce and follow that with the dill pickle slices, spread out evenly. 4. Put the cooked &quot;rib&quot; patty on next, then add the onions, followed by the heel. (bottom) 5. Wrap this masterpiece in a 12&quot;x16&quot; sheet of waxed paper, let sit 5 minutes, then microwave on high about 15 seconds, still wrapped. 6. Enjoy a wonderful McRib?Sandwich! Important Notes This is how we did it &quot;back then&quot;. However, back then we also just used Bullseye?brand barbecue sauce. (original flavor) You might consider this option. Also - this having never been an &quot;official&quot; McDonald&apos;s sandwich, different franchise operators may have prepared it a little differently. Like putting the onions on the crown side, or not putting pickles on it. Maybe they put sauce on both sides... etc... etc... Just customize it to the way YOU remember it.

 McMenu ?Do-It-Yourself McDonalds Restaurant Recipes (All products copyrighted by the McDonald&apos;s Corporation) - XAM2001 - Page 18 Filet-O-Fish The first really new menu item other than burgers and fries was 1963&apos;s Filet-O-Fish? Invented in Cincinnati, it was an alternative sandwich added to the menu so Catholics could still eat at Mickey-D&apos;s on Fridays. Brilliant Ray Kroc took it nationwide that same year. The key to this recipe is the tartar sauce. Special Tools You&apos;ll need a deep-fryer for this one. (this is a per-serving recipe . Multiply everything by each serving needed) Fish patty can also be baked per package directions. Filet-O-Fish Tartar Sauce 1/2 cup Kraft?Miracle WhipTM 1/4 cup Vlasic?DILL relish 2 teaspoons dried, minced onion 2 teaspoons half&amp;half 1 teaspoon dried parsley flakes 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice concentrate 10-12 capers (small), minced 1/8 teaspoon sugar Combine in a small jar, mix very well and refrigerate in an air-tight container until needed. Make this tartar sauce well in advance. (the flavors need to &quot;meld&quot;) Ingredients 1 Van de Camps frozen breaded whitefish patty* 1 small, regular hamburger bun 1 tablespoon prepared tartar sauce 1/2 slice real American cheese dash salt 1 12&quot;x12&quot; sheet of waxed paper (to wrap) *use any square whitefish patty not extra crisp, like Mrs. Paul&apos;s, or even the store brand. (as with the burgers, pre-heat your oven to warm. This is your warming &quot;bin&quot;) Cooking your Filet-O-Fish?#060;/b&gt; Pre-heat you fryer to 375-400 degrees. After its ready, cook fish 3-5 minutes until done. (do NOT thaw first) Remove and add a dash of salt. In the old days, the bun was quick warmed using a steamer. We&apos;ll use the microwave. Microwave the bun about 10 seconds, until hot and steamy. (Do NOT toast the bun) Add about 1 tablespoon of prepared tartar sauce to crown side of the bun. Place the cooked fish filet on top, add 1/2 slice American cheese centered on the fish, and add heel of the bun. Wrap in a 12&quot;x12&quot; sheet of waxed paper and warm in oven&apos;s lowest setting for 8-10 minutes. Dig into a fabulous Filet-0-Fish! An alternate &quot;Q-ing&quot; method would be to wrap the sandwich tightly in wax paper, let sit for 5 minutes, and microwave on high for 15 seconds (while still wrapped)

 McMenu ?Do-It-Yourself McDonalds Restaurant Recipes (All products copyrighted by the McDonald&apos;s Corporation) - XAM2001 - Page 20 French Fries Ingredients 2 large Idaho russet potatoes 1/4 cup sugar 2 tablespoons corn syrup 1-2 cups hot water 6 cups Crisco?shortening 1/4 cup beef lard (or save the fat from previously cooked burgers) salt Special Tools Deep fryer French Fry Cutter (or patience for cutting potatoes) Preparing your French Fries Peel the potatoes. In a large mixing bowl, combine sugar, corn syrup, and hot water. Make sure the sugar is dissolved. Using a French fry slicer, cut the peeled potatoes into shoestrings. The potatoes should be 1/4&quot; x 1/4&quot; in thickness, and about 4&quot; to 6&quot; long. (You can do this with a knife, but it is a lot of work) Place the shoe-stringed potatoes into the bowl of sugar-water, and refrigerate. Let them soak about 30 minutes. While they&apos;re soaking, pack the shortening into the deep fryer. Crank up the temperature to &quot;full&quot;. The shortening has to pre-heat for a very long time. It will eventually liquefy. After it has liquefied and is at least 375? drain the potatoes and dump them into the fryer. (be careful, it will be ferocious) After 1 to 1 1/2 minutes, remove the potatoes and place them on a paper towel lined plate. Let them cool 8 to 10 minutes in the refrigerator. While they&apos;re cooling, add the lard or beef drippings to the hot Crisco? Again, crank the temperature to full. Stir in the lard as it melts into the oil. It will blend in. After the deep fryer is reheated to 375?400? add the potatoes and deep fry again for 5-7 minutes until golden brown. Remove and place in a large bowl. Sprinkle generously with salt, then &quot;toss&quot; the fries to mix the salt evenly. (I suggest about 1 teaspoon of salt, maybe slightly more) Serve hot, serve immediately, and enjoy! Depending upon the size of the potatoes, this recipe makes about 2 medium sized fries. Special Notes 1. If you want more fries, double the recipe - but DON&apos;T double the cooking oil. Just cook them in shifts, adding about 1/4 cup more Crisco?and 1 tablespoon lard for the second batch. 2. If cooking for a minute or so, removing, and returning the fries to the oil seems like a pain in the ass, that&apos;s because it is. But it is an important &quot;blanching&quot; step required for that great taste. 3. For an easier clone of McDonald&apos;s French fries, you can use the frozen, pre-cut Ore-Ida?shoestring potatoes. Just cook them in the same combo of Crisco?and lard, skipping the &quot;blanching&quot; process. Cook them while still frozen for 6-10 minutes (depending upon the amount) until golden brown. They&apos;re good, but not nearly as accurate in taste and texture as the fresh recipe .

Find one at you&apos;re favorite cooking specialty store. Cooking Your Egg McMuffin 1. Pre-heat an electric griddle to 275 degrees. Toast your English muffin by laying both sides face down on the griddle and applying pressure. This takes about 1 to 1.5 minutes. (they should be medium brown) Set aside. 2. Lay your egg ring on the pre-heated grill. Spray with Pam to prevent sticking. Crack the egg and pour into egg ring on the grill. Poke the yolk with a sharp instrument so it flows. 3. Butter both toasted halves of the English muffin liberally with melted butter. Put a slice of American cheese on the bottom half. 4. About 2 1/2 minutes after you started cooking the egg, the whites should firm up, and the yolk should still be a bit &quot;liquidy&quot;. Carefully remove the ring, leaving the egg on the griddle. (you may have to &quot;slice&quot; around the edges if it sticks) 5. Very carefully turn the egg over, and lay one slice of Canadian bacon on the griddle. 6. After about 30-45 seconds, &quot;flip&quot; the Canadian bacon, and remove the egg, placing it on the bottom half (cheesed half) of the English muffin. 7. Put the Canadian bacon on top, and cover with the top of the English muffin. 8. Wrap in pre-cut wax paper just like the hamburger recipes. Let stand 5 minutes, then microwave 12 second on high, and eat.

 McMenu ?Do-It-Yourself McDonalds Restaurant Recipes (All products copyrighted by the McDonald&apos;s Corporation) - XAM2001 - Page 27 Biscuits Ingredients: (per sandwich) 1 Prepared Pillsbury?GrandsTM biscuit (Or... make them from scratch) 1 Smithfield?Restaurant-Style sausage patty (or similar) 2 teaspoons McDonald&apos;s biscuit dressing (see below) Sausage and Egg Biscuit Same as above, plus one grade A large egg Sausage McMuffin 1 Thomas&apos;s?English muffin 2 teaspoons melted butter 1 slice real American cheese Sausage McMuffin with Egg Same as above, plus one grade A large egg The Sausage The type of sausage patty used at McDonald&apos;s is pre-cooked and frozen. On the east coast there is a near perfect clone available at your supermarket: Smithfield?Brand Restaurant-Style sausage patties. The ingredients match up almost perfectly. I&apos;m sure there are other &quot;regional&quot; brands that match up, just check the label and compare with the ingredients listed for the McDonald&apos;s sausage patty McDonald&apos;s Sausage Ingredients: Pork, water, salt, sage, spices, corn syrup solids, dextrose, sugar, pepper, monosodium glutamate, flavorings, BHA propyl gallate, citric acid. McDonald&apos;s Biscuits From Scratch: Yield: 8 biscuits 2 tablespoons margarine, melted and divided 2 cups Bisquick baking mix 2/3 cups buttermilk 1 teaspoon sugar 1/4 teaspoon salt 1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. 2. Combine the baking mix, buttermilk, sugar, salt, and half of the melted margarine in a medium bowl. Mix until well-blended. 3. Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 30 seconds, or until dough becomes elastic. 4. Roll dough to about 3/4 inch thick and punch out biscuits using a 3 inch cutter. Arrange the punched-out dough on an ungreased baking sheet, and bake for 10-12 minutes or until the biscuits are golden on top and have doubled in height. 5. Remove the biscuits from the oven and immediately brush each one with a light coating of the remaining melted margarine. Serve warm. From a Box I suggest using Pillsbury?GrandsTM ready to bake biscuits. Find them in the refrigerated section at your favorite supermarket. You could make them from scratch, but the whole idea of fast food is convenience. That applies at home too, and these are close enough.

 McMenu ?Do-It-Yourself McDonalds Restaurant Recipes (All products copyrighted by the McDonald&apos;s Corporation) - XAM2001 - Page 28 Bake the biscuits in advance according to the package directions. With one exception: Half way through baking, brush each biscuit with a small amount of melted butter. Depending upon how many biscuits you&apos;ll need, you can bake them all at once (8) or just do half, and refrigerate the rest. The subtle flavoring comes from the biscuit dressing and the way it blends with the other ingredients. McDonald&apos;s Biscuit Dressing Soybean oil based cooking spray (like Pam? 1/8 teaspoon salt 1/16 teaspoon onion powder 1/16 teaspoon Jolly-Time?buttery seasoning (look near the popcorn at the supermarket) 5-6 drops lemon juice from concentrate In a very small container, spray the cooking spray for 10-12 seconds. (you&apos;ll get about 2 teaspoons after the froth dies down) Add the remaining ingredients and mix well. Set aside until biscuit time. (this amount of biscuit dressing is enough for only one sandwich, so you might want to double or quadruple it if you&apos;re making 2-4 biscuit sandwiches) Preparing your Sausage Biscuit 1. Bake the biscuits according to package directions. 2. Pre-heat an electric griddle to 400? When it is ready, place the desired number of frozen patties on the surface. After 20 seconds, sear each of them thoroughly. (They should squeak, almost squealing like a pig when you do this) 3. After 2 minutes, turn the patty(s) over. Cook another 2-3 minutes. 4. Cut or break your baked biscuit(s) evenly down the middle, and put 1 teaspoon of your McDonald&apos;s biscuit dressing on each half - evenly dispersed. 5. When the sausage is done, put it on the bottom biscuit, add the top, and wrap tightly in a 12&quot;x16&quot; sheet of waxed paper. 6. Let stand 5 minutes, then microwave (still wrapped) for 15-20 seconds. Sausage Biscuit with Egg Simply prepare everything the same as above, and follow the Egg McMuffin cooking instructions for the egg. Sausage McMuffin and Sausage McMuffin with Egg For a plain Sausage McMuffin? toast the English muffin as described in the Egg McMuffin? recipe . Add a teaspoon of melted butter to each toasted half instead of biscuit dressing. For a sausage McMuffin?with Egg, follow the Egg McMuffin?cooking directions, and use the sausage patty in place of the Canadian bacon.

 McMenu ?Do-It-Yourself McDonalds Restaurant Recipes (All products copyrighted by the McDonald&apos;s Corporation) - XAM2001 - Page 30 Hot Apple and Cherry Pies McDonald&apos;s had a really tasty thing going for several years with their hot apple and cherry pies. They were deep fried, and awesome. But because the trend for consumers has been &quot;healthier&quot; and &quot;less-fat&quot;, the classic recipe was replaced with the current baked product. Now you can have those greasy, volcano hot pies again! Special Tools Deep fryer, spray gun with fresh water, zip-lock bags, and an extra fry basket. Ingredients 4-6 cups vegetable oil (in fryer) 1 package Pillsbury?apple or cherry turnovers (Find them in the refrigerated section) Preparation 1. Unroll the Pillsbury?turnover dough. You will have six 3&quot;x3&quot; pieces. You will use four of them. Stretch them out to about 4&quot;x5&quot; rectangles. Do this on waxed paper. 2. Spread 1/2 of the pie filling on one dough, and the other half on another, leaving about 1/2 inch of dough around edges. Clear a 3/4 inch space lengthwise down the middle of both. 3. Place the remaining two doughs on top of the two with the filling. Crimp the edges. You&apos;ll have what looks like two giant pop-tarts. 4. Cut both of them precisely down the middle, in that 3/4 inch space you created. Crimp those two edges. 5. Manipulate as needed to form an attractive, uniform shaped pie. They should look like small burritos, only crimped around the edges. 6. Place all four, flat on waxed paper, in the freezer. After about 45 minutes, spray all sides of each pie with water mist. Return to the freezer for at least another hour. 7. Place in a freezer bag and seal for future use, or get ready to deep-fry them. Cooking Your Pies 1. Pre-heat your deep fryer to 375? Also pre-heat your oven to warm. 2. Quickly dip a frozen pie in cold water, making sure to immerse it entirely. 3. Drop the pie into the hot oil. Be careful - it will most likely splatter. After the pies are in the fryer, place your spare fryer basket over the top. (&quot;Sandwiching&quot; the pies between the two baskets) This ensures the pies are fully submerged. It is important that the pies are fully submerged or a good portion of it won&apos;t cook correctly. 4. Cook 5-7 minutes. Check after 5 minutes - the color should be a golden brown. The older the oil, the sooner it will turn brown, and that may give you a false reading. 6 minutes is generally right on. 5. After deep-frying, carefully remove the cooked pies and drain for 1 minute on paper towels. Then place directly on the oven rack in your warmed oven. Warm for at least 10 minutes, and as long as 30 minutes. 6. Enjoy your McDonald&apos;s hot apple/cherry pie, but caution... it will be hot. Important Notes 1. The pies will not look exactly the same as the old McDonald&apos;s hot pies. They will also be smaller. The taste, however, will
be the same. As you eat it, you&apos;ll actually be able to feel the fat
pulsating in your veins on the way to clog your arteries! 2. The pies may stick to the fry basket. If this happens, carefully remove using a knife. You don&apos;t want to rip the dough. 3. If the filling oozes out during cooking, remember to crimp the dough edges better next time. If you wonder why these pies have to be frozen, it is to get a crispy crust. Spraying with water beforehand gives a little ice glaze
that helps the outer crust attain the correct texture. Finally, dipping
in water just before placing in the oil helps form a flaky, crispier layer on the outside, and the famous &quot;doughy&quot; crust on the inside.

They are nearly impossible to duplicate at home) Special Tools 10 inch non-stick skillet rubber spatula (like Rubbermaid? deep fryer Cooking the Eggs 1. Pre-heat the skillet to low heat. Be careful not to make it too hot. It is better to have it too cool than too hot. 2. Scramble the eggs using the McDonald&apos;s method. 3. Spray the cooking surface with a small amount of non-stick spray, and pour in the eggs . Stir with the rubber spatula in a circular motion. If, after a time, nothing seems to be happening, turn up the burner slightly. 4. As the eggs begin to firm up, begin &quot;chopping&quot; them with the rubber spatula. Make sure to fold them over a few times so the eggs cook evenly. Once the eggs are fairly firm with very little liquid, stop folding, but continue chopping. 5. The eggs will get more and more firm, and you will continue the chopping motion while they do. You want to eliminate any &quot;big chunks&quot;. 6. When the eggs are finally done, use a regular metal spatula to cut them into 4 equal sized pieces, using two crosscuts. (You&apos;ll have 4 egg wedges) 7. Remove the cooked eggs from the skillet using the metal spatula and serve immediately with hash browns. Salt and pepper to taste. Serves 4 Cooking McDonald&apos;s Hash Browns 1. Pre-heat your deep fryer to 350?375?range. 2. Place 4 still frozen Ore-Ida?hash brown patties in the fry basket. 3. Lower the basket into the hot oil, and cook 2-3 minutes until golden brown. 4. Remove the hash brown patties, and place on a paper towel lined plate. Add a dash of salt immediately to each side, and allow to cool a few minutes before serving. 5. Serve with McDonald&apos;s scrambled eggs .

Mix hotcake ingredients with a wire whisk until smooth. Apply about 1 teaspoon of Crisco?shortening to the griddle, spreading evenly with a paper towel. (Be careful not to burn your fingers) Pour the hotcake batter on the greased, pre-heated griddle, forming 5 inch hotcakes. Cook until dry around the edges, (about a minute) then turn. Allow to cook about 40-50 seconds after flipping, and remove. Place the cooked hotcakes on an oven safe plate, and warm in your oven for 5-8 minutes. (This helps give the hotcakes that tough texture McDonald&apos;s is famous for) Serve with Aunt Jemima?original maple syrup. (It is the closest ingredient match to McDonald&apos;s hotcake syrup) *Note: The Bisquick?pancake mix is available in their &quot;Shake&amp;Pour?amp;quot; variety. Use the 7 ounce size, and follow the package directions... using 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup Sprite?in place of the 1 cup of water stated on the package. McDonald&apos;s Hotcake Big Breakfast Serve 2 cooked hotcakes with a McDonald&apos;s sausage patty. Important Note: McDonald&apos;s doesn&apos;t really use Sprite?in their hotcake batter. This is a clone recipe that closely matches the flavor of McDonald&apos;s Hotcakes. They have their own dry mix that requires only adding water.
