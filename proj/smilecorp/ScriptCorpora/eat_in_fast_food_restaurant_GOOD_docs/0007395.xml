Just like its sister location up in Green Hills the food here is great. Finally a chain that knows how to do fast and friendly Italian (as well as Asian and American) pastas! And for the price, you can&apos;t beat it.

The food here is really good. For example, for me at least, the chicken noodle soup here is perfection in a bowl... seriously, just add some matzo balls and it tastes as good as what I make (my fiance will can vouch for how good my matzo ball soup is as she often requests it)!

Finally, unique to this location is a semi-automated, touch screen, beverage dispensing system for Coca-cola product. If you want more than just the typical Sprite, Coca-Cola, Dr. Pepper and 1 or 2 other random Coca-cola options, this has an immense selection. Maybe this is the first of many of the future soda fountain machines?

I like this place!  it has a wide selection of pasta dishes, and everything I have had so far has been very good.  It&apos;s fast casual, with a very good service atmosphere.  The food has always been delivered really quickly...and the staff has always come around to collect the dishes and check on me.

As the others have mentioned, the drink machine here is pretty awesome.  I only drink water, but I was told this soda fountain does 200 drink combinations.  I had seen this prototype a few years back in a special Coca-Cola was doing.  It&apos;s really cool to see this thing in action.

Another thing that impressed me about this place - I tweeted about being there.  And the next day I got a personal message back from them.  They are obviously into customer service from the corporate level down to the bellboy.

I was excited to see this place pop up recently as I am a fan of noodles of all types... Italian, Thai, American, etc. I&apos;ve been twice with my husband, and I&apos;ve been pleased. The food is pretty good... not amazing, but for a quick inexpensive lunch or dinner, it does the trick. The variety of the menu is a plus. I like that there are regular and small portions, so that I don&apos;t walk out of there uncomfortably full. If I were comparing the food to nice restaurants with authentic food/menus, I&apos;d give this place 3 stars... but for the type of  &apos;fast food&quot; restaurant it is, it&apos;s a very solid choice! I even thought the soup was pretty good that I had.

Oh, and the staff there is VERY nice! Usually a manager or owner comes by to ask how everything is, and staff checks on you for drink refills and take your plates. That&apos;s a plus for a fast food joint. My only complaint is the fancy soda machine with the touch screen. I&apos;m a straight up Coca Cola chic, and both times, the coke was way off. However, if you&apos;d like diet vanilla grape coke with lime, you can get it!

This place will definitely be on our rotation of quick dinners during the week.

Love this place. The mac and cheese with meatballs and the spaghetti are both terrific. And the drink machine is always fun.
Be sure and try one of their rice krispie desserts.

The food was really good, and the staff was *incredibly* friendly and helpful.  It has a family friendly, pleasant atmosphere with enough variety for everyone.  The kids loved the soda machine, and my only complaint was that the water out of the machine tasted really bad--not sure why.  We will definitely come here again, though!
