Hany Ramadan WEP 122: UNIX Boot Camp UNIX is arguably the most ubiquitous and important operating system in scientific research, used by scientists in all fields. It is also unfamiliar to most new students and researchers, who come from a Microsoft Windows and Apple MacOS background, from their use of personal computers. In this 2-day crash course (2 hours per day), we will cover the basic tools, and underlying philosophy, of the UNIX system, to get the researcher on his/her way to increased productivity with this operating system. More importantly, they will have learned enough to become confident to continue exploring it on their own, armed with knowledge of how to teach themselves more specialized and advanced topics.

The topics to be covered include:
* User and System Information
* Process Monitoring and Management
* Using and Customizing The Shell (C-Shell)
* The Filesystem, Directories, Files, Security
* Pipelines, Filters, and Manipulating Data

Soo Hong Chew WEP 362: Biological Economics and Decision-making The biological revolution of the last 40 years has now positioned modern science to tackle one of the deepest and most vexing problems of the modern era - the biological basis of human choice. A large number of maladies that afflict the world today remain obscure due to an almost complete ignorance of the biological architecture of human decision-making. These maladies range from economic meltdowns, driven in large measure by widespread breakdowns in trust between individuals and institutions freezing commerce worldwide, to individual diseases in humans where the primary symptoms are dramatic and often involving pathological changes in decision-making.

In their WEP lectures, Professors Chew and Coricelli will explore the neurobiological underpinnings of the human capacity to choose. The topics they will discuss include theoretical models of decision making and their experimental tests in incentivized laboratory settings augmented by the tools of molecular genetics, brain imaging, endocrinology and pharmacology.

The goal of these investigations is to seek a deeper understanding of individual decision making under risk and involving time as well as social decision making involving other regarding behavior, such as altruism, fairness, and trust, and strategic thinking. Particular emphasis will be placed on how the completion of the human genome project has generated molecular genetic tools that can be leveraged to identify neuroanatomical and neurochemical pathways that shape the biology of choice. 2012-01-14 to 2012-01-17 Sun, 09:30 to 11:30

William Rundell WEP 169: Secure digital communications You are in a room with 100 people and want to accomplish two things.

First, to send messages in secret to an individual on the opposite side whom you have never met or previously corresponded.

There is no privacy; every communication is transmitted to everyone in the room.

Second thing; you have information you wish to keep completely secret,
but still be able to convince your neighbour that you possess this information.

Is it possible to succeed in either or both of these endeavours?

Of course it is! Hundreds of millions of such transactions take place every day - internet bank transfers and secure online purchasing in the case of the first and ATM machines in the second.

The question is, how? The answer is, very, very clever mathematics.
But is it deep and intractable? Well no, the most important of the ideas needed date from the 4th century BC to the early 17th century; all long before calculus. High school stuff.

In four, one hour lectures we will be able to show the key ideas and to actually implement both of the above. The background requirements are the student should be curious and to like puzzles; no real mathematical sophistication is needed, but solid algebra skills are essential. No text is needed; a full set of web pages will be constructed with relevant material. The benefit is to understand the basics of electronic commerce and the challenges posed by this.

One way to state this is by the following question:

When you make a purchase online does your bank know what item you are buying, and does the seller get your credit card information?

If you answered&quot;yes&quot;to either of these then this class will enlighten you. 2012-01-15 to 2012-01-16 Sun, 09:30 to 11:30

Guiseppe Caire WEP 110A: Lecture: Network information theory / wireless systems applications Introduction by Prof. Tareq Al-Naffouri and Prof. Slim Alouini.

Network information theory studies the fundamental limits of reliable transmission of information in multi-terminal systems. While network information theory has been around for 4 decades, only recently some major breakthroughs have illuminated the capacity of important settings such as the multi-antenna (vector) Gaussian broadcast channel, wireless relay networks with multi-source multicast and Gaussian interference channels. Most importantly, it has been realized that these information theoretic models and their corresponding fundamental limits characterization are not only intellectually challenging and fascinating problems, but have also a direct impact on the design of new generations of more and more efficient wireless systems. In fact, the intuition and guidelines derived from information theoretic results are playing an ever-growing prominent role in practical systems design. 2012-01-15 to 2012-01-15 Sun, 09:30 to 11:30

Falko Kuester WEP 168: Collaborative Visual Analytics Environments The complexity and amount of data scientists are confronted with in today’s research domains challenge our ability to visualize information accurately and efficiently. Information acquired with modern data mining tools often has multi-dimensional character, requiring expert knowledge from different scientific fields to interpret. Furthermore, comprehensive data analysis usually requires simultaneous access to multiple data sources represented in their own special form.

This presentation provides an overview of the challenges of developing a unified, globally integrated workspace (desktop / walltop) based on CGLX and its applications, aimed at reducing the barrier of entry for novice or occasional user, while enabling power-users via seamless access to multi-modal visuals at native performance in distributed settings. They include:
• Development of versatile content and layout management concepts and visual front-end, enabling the creation of a persistent visual entry point into massively scalable visualization environments.
• Development of database centric visualization paradigms, anchored in MongoDB for cross-system integration, and support for state and metadata management.
• Development of real-time audio annotation (recording) techniques, enabling scientist to create content rich metadata, by coupling visuals and real-time audio. 2012-01-15 to 2012-01-16 Sun, 09:30 to 11:30

Jack Cackler WEP 094: Nanosatellite Development Workshop This event will be a rapid-prototyping workshop with the purpose of learning how to build a satellite from scratch, which will be launched into orbit during 2012. Students taking the seminars will learn the requisite technology required for software programming, electrical design, hardware assembly, orbital mechanics, and radio communications. The exercise will culminate in a high-altitude weather balloon launch where students will get to test their equipment at over 30 km in the stratosphere. These satellites build off of Google Android smartphones, and all of the software for them is completely open-source.

We welcome students from all divisions, as while the satellite assembly itself draws skillsets from Applied Mathematics and Computational Sciences, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Material Science and Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, there are a wide variety of payload applications that can directly benefit Bioscience, Chemical and Biological Engineering, Chemical Sciences, Earth Science and Engineering, Environmental Science and Engineering, and Marine Science. We already have a strong track record of biological payload research, having flown KAUST researcher payloads alongside NASA payloads that have won international prizes and been featured in documentaries by the BBC and Nature. The ability to use satellites for remote environmental sensing is key to Saudi Arabia’s future, and an area in which we are rapidly developing.

We welcome students of all backgrounds to join us in this project, and look forward to reaching new heights in Saudi Arabia together.

Ibrahim Hoteit WEP 126: A Modern Mathematical View of an Uncertain World Computational predictions often form the basis for critical decisions in engineering, financial markets, environmental studies, and many other fields. Today, rapid development of computer hardware allows us to make computational predictions of more and more complex phenomena. How reliable are these predictions? Can we trust them?
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) addresses this issue from mathematical and computational perspectives. This plenary event will consist of a series of four lectures from world class scientists presenting the application of UQ in different areas of sciences and engineering. The lectures will introduce a general audience to the world of UQ and will demonstrate its significance in real world applications. The event includes the following presentations:

&quot;Predicting next week&apos;s weather and next century&apos;s climate. How certain can we be?&quot;by Tim Palmer (13:45-14:30)

&quot;Uncertainty Quantification in Geophysical Inverse Problems: Opportunities and Challenges&quot;by Omar Ghattas (14:30-15:15)

&quot;Uncertainty Quantification Challenges in Modeling Complex Systems&quot;by Omar Knio (15:30-16:15)

&quot;Reducing Computational Complexity of UQ&quot;by Jan Hesthaven (16:15-17:00) 2012-01-15 to 2012-01-15 Sun, 13:30 to 17:00
 
Brett Dellingham WEP 142: A History and Pre-history of Storytelling Storytelling surrounds us yet it is often difficult to “see” it- we often seem as unaware that storytelling is continuously occurring much like a fish is unaware that it is surrounded by water. In this lecture you will hear stories, learn the likely origin of storytelling and become more aware of the stories around you.

Most historians and psychologists believe that storytelling is one of the many things that define and bind our humanity. Humans are perhaps the only animals that create and tell stories. We have done this since time immemorial. Storytelling was the only way to receive, process and transmit information until modern times. Presently, storytelling is still the method whereby humans gain most of their information but the medium through which the stories are transmitted has evolved. Print, radio, TV, computers, cell phones… the list goes on and the media continues to grow and evolve.

When the lecture- the storytelling- is over, you will have stories unfolding in your head and breathe the stories the envelop you. 2012-01-15 to 2012-01-15 Sun, 16:30 to 17:30
 
Pascal Bogaert WEP 298: Tingatinga Lecture This lecture will focus on the history, social aspects and cultural meaning of Tingatinga painting; East Africa’s most popular contemporary painting style.

Eduardo Saidi Tingatinga lend his exotic and frivolous name to the style he created single handedly. He was one of the most influential artists of the African continent and probably the artist with the shortest art career in the history of the world. He started painting in 1968 and was unfortunately shot dead by the police during a run-away incident in 1972. Tingatinga influenced generations of young painters during and after his life time. These painters continue to develop his style up until today.

Tingatinga painting became a trademark for Tanzania and work of the most prominent members of the style has been exhibited in major galleries from China over Europe to America. The Tingatinga style has recently gained world fame in Pixar animated movies and is now at KAUST for you.

The lecture will feature a PowerPoint presentation with work of renowned Tingatinga painters such as George Lilanga, Damian Msagula and David Mzuguno and will also contain a world premiere; a short documentary film featuring a master class by the late David Mzuguno while he creates one of his last masterpieces in March 2009. The lecture will furthermore show the link between naïve arts worldwide and also touches the oeuvres of Henri ‘Le Douanier’ Rousseau, Nikifor and Grandma Moses. Finally this lecture will expand your understanding and appreciation of contemporary Visual arts as a carrier for cultural values and as a means of communication for people from different cultures and societies. 2012-01-15 to 2012-01-15 Sun, 16:30 to 17:30
 
Pascal Bogaert WEP 360: TingaTinga Painting Exhibition - Opening Come and see some TingaTinga paintings and maybe get some ideas for your own paintings! Eduardo Saidi Tingatinga lent his exotic and frivolous name to the style he created single handedly. He was one of the most influential artists of the African continent and probably the artist with the shortest art career in the history of the world.

This Exhibit will continue over the next two days in the Campus Library 2012-01-15 to 2012-01-15 Sun, 18:00 to 19:00
 
Bill Baxter WEP 398: WebGL and Google Maps WebGL is a new web technology that allows web developers to harness the incredible power of modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to create stunning 3D graphics right in the browser without plug-ins. It is an open standard created by the Khronos group, and supporters include the major browser vendors Apple, Google, Mozilla and Opera. WebGL vaults the web browser into a new status as an excellent platform for graphically rich applications. Companies like Rovio (Angry Birds) have used it to port games to the web, and Google has recently released an experimental version of Google Maps, completely re-implemented and re-imagined using WebGL. In this talk I will first give an overview of the WebGL technology and the basics of how to create graphical applications using WebGL. Second I will dive into some details of how and why we re-built Google Maps on top of WebGL.

Talk introduced by Mr. Gustavo Chavez. 2012-01-15 to 2012-01-15 Sun, 19:30 to 21:00
 
Niveen Khashab WEP 047: Multifunctional Nanomaterials The aim of this seminar is to give an overview of Nanomaterials. Today nanomaterials are widely used in medicine with an increasing concern about their possible long-term undesirable effects on humans. Although some progress has been made, their behaviour in vivo remains poorly characterized. To evaluate the potential impact of engineered nanomaterials on human health and improve their performance, it is essential to study their behaviour in biological media. It is now accepted that nanoscale surfaces in a biological environment are immediately modified by the adsorption of proteins leading to a protein “corona”, which defines the biological identity of the particle. 2012-01-16 to 2012-01-16 Mon, 13:30 to 14:30
 
Raul Tempone WEP 062: A brief introduction to the Monte Carlo Method Monte Carlo methods are abundant in many scientific areas, including engineering, physics and chemistry, and finance.

Urs Weidmann WEP 064: Introducing Silent-Power, the new concept to replace nuclear power plants in Germany and Switzerland Silent-Power is the first utility which is not built on large power plants like coal or nuclear plants but on thousands of decentralised minipowerplants which are installed in the basements of the buildings. They supply electricity to the grid, warm and cold water to the building for climatisation. Silent-Power uses a new environmental friendly liquid fuel, which is produced fully synthetically (and is therefore available without limits). The electricity production is realised by Econimos, which are new energy converters developed by Silent-Power. They are noiseless (therefore the company&apos;s name), maintenance free and inexpensive to build. 2012-01-16 to 2012-01-16 Mon, 13:30 to 14:30
 
Alajati Abdullah WEP 15B: The role of ERBB2 in breast cancer development and metastasis The activation or expression of ERBB2(HER2) is altered in many epithelial tumors and clinical studies have revealed its important role in cancer progression and metastasis. Consequently, its function in cancer biology and potential as a therapeutic target has been intensely studied. Identification of a novel interaction partner of HER2 that can be targeted to disrupt the HER2 pathway will thus be of clinical and pathophysiological relevance. 2012-01-16 to 2012-01-16 Mon, 13:30 to 14:30
 
Ari Sherris WEP 033: A Theory of Your Evolving Professional Identity as Scientist The ways you speak and act in your discipline reflect and constitute an evolving professional identity. During the session participants discover the complex relationship between their need for inclusion in their field and their need for distinctiveness. Based on over 30 years of theory building and research by Harvard’s Robert Kegan, a theory has been honed that provides deep levels of explanation for the negotiation and renegotiation of the terms of your development. The aim of this talk is to provide you with seminal understands of this theory. Why remain clueless to the deep developmental changes in your life? This talk will set you on a journey toward better self-knowledge and, by extrapolation, better knowledge of others as you work towards similar and different goals in your disciplinary scholarship and research. 2012-01-16 to 2012-01-16 Mon, 16:30 to 17:30

WEP Film Festival WEP FF 02: Cool It Climate catastrophe? The end of civilization as we know it?

Cool It is based upon the book of the same name and lectures by Bjorn Lomborg, the controversial author of The Skeptical Environmentalist. Award-winning filmmaker Ondi Timoner travels the world with Lomborg exploring the real facts and true science of global warming and its impact. Lomborg is the founder and director of the Copenhagen Consensus Center, a globally respected think tank that brings together the world’s leading economists to prioritize major global problems – among them malaria, the lack of potable water and HIV/AIDS – based upon a cost/benefit analysis of available solutions. Amidst the strong and polarized opinions within the global warming debate, Cool It follows Lomborg on his mission to bring the smartest solutions to climate change, environmental pollution, and other major problems in the world.

WEP Film Festival WEP FF 03: Taking Root: Wangari Mathai Story Taking Root tells the dramatic story of Kenyan Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Wangari Maathai whose simple act of planting trees grew into a nationwide movement to safeguard the environment, protect human rights, and defend democracy—a movement for which this charismatic woman became an iconic inspiration.

Taking Root weaves a compelling and dramatic narrative of one woman&apos;s personal journey in the context of the turbulent political and environmental history of her country. Raised in the rural highlands of Kenya, educated in the United States during the 1960s civil rights era, and the first female to receive a PhD in East Africa, Maathai discovered the heart of her life&apos;s work by reconnecting with the rural women with whom she had grown up. They told her that their daily lives had become intolerable: they were walking longer distances for firewood, clean water had become scarce, the soil was disappearing from their fields, and their children were suffering from malnutrition. Maathai thought to herself,&quot;Well, why not plant trees?&quot;Trees provide shade, prevent soil erosion, supply firewood and building materials, and produce nutritious fruit to combat malnutrition. With this realization Maathai founded the Green Belt Movement, a grassroots organization encouraging rural women to plant trees.

Hans-F Graf WEP 405: Climate response to the Toba super-eruption Climatic consequences of the Younger Toba Tuff (YTT) eruption about 73 ka BP are a crucial argument in the current discussion about the fate of modern humans, especially in Africa and Asia. Earth system model (ESM) simulations of the YTT eruption are used to investigate its regional climate impacts, in particular focusing on areas relevant to human evolutionary issues during that time. Information about transient changes in vegetation types after the YTT eruption are obtained by forcing an offline dynamical global vegetation model with the climate anomalies simulated by the ESM under both glacial and interglacial background climate conditions. The simulated temperature changes in those areas that were inhabited by humans suggest thermal discomfort, but not a real challenge for survival. Precipitation is reduced in all regions during the first two years but recovers quickly thereafter. Some catchments in these regions (Ganges/Brahmaputra, Nile), experience an over-compensation in precipitation during the third to fifth post-eruption years which is also reflected in anomalously strong river runoffs. Change in vegetation composition may have created the biggest pressure on humans, who had to adapt to more open space with fewer trees and more grasses for some decades especially in the African regions. The strongest environmental impacts of the YTT eruption are simulated under interglacial background conditions suggesting that the climate effects of the YTT eruption did not impact humans on a major scale and for a period long enough to have dramatic consequences for their survival. 2012-01-16 to 2012-01-16 Mon, 13:30 to 14:30
 
Philip K.Maini WEP 149: Mathematical Modelling in Biology and Medicine This course of 4 lectures will introduce students to the rapidly growing field of mathematical modelling in biology and medicine. We will begin with simple ordinary differential equation models which will allow us to introduce the ideas of equilibria, local and global stability, and non-dimensionalisation. Then we will consider systems of partial differential equations, typically used to model processes in which spatial effects play a vital role. These will be analysed to show that they can give rise to spatial patterns (steady state solutions which are non-constant in space) and travelling waves.

Applications will then be considered, such as, understanding how embryonic development occurs (for example, how does a leopard get its spots), how does the heart beat, what can we learn about cancer growth and development. 2012-01-17 to 2012-01-18 Tue, 09:30 to 11:30

Aron Ahmadia WEP 118: Python for Scientists Scientists and engineers at KAUST interact with numerical software on a daily basis, whether they are visualizing whale shark migration patterns on the visualization laboratory’s Showcase, analyzing plasma instabilities on Shaheen, or conducting statistical analysis on their workstation. While there are many special-purpose numerical software tools developed for specific applications and domains, there are very few general purpose tools and languages. The Python programming language stands out as a powerful, freely available, easy-to-learn, and popular general purpose tool for scientists and engineers of all disciplines. This course is geared at new graduate students of a wide range of programming backgrounds who would like to have more control of their data for computation, analysis, and visualization. 2012-01-17 to 2012-01-17 Tue, 09:30 to 16:30
 
Bing-yi Jing WEP 028: Statistical Inference with high-frequency financial data Ito&apos;s semimaringales are widely used in modeling the asset prices in financial markets. Ito&apos;s semimaringales can model both continuous and discontinuous components. In recent years, the availability of high-frequency data has motivated ways to conduct inference on characteristics of a discretely sampled semimartingale, e.g., the integrated volatility and the jump activity index. Furthermore, it is widely accepted that the high-frequency data are contaminated by microstructure noise, whose effect on the statistical inference has been of increasing interest in the literature. We will introduce these topics and discuss some relevant issues in this course. 2012-01-17 to 2012-01-18 Tue, 13:30 to 16:00

Peter Otto WEP 166: Improved Visualization System Interactivity using Audio Rendering and Capture Technologies This presentation provides an overview of improvements to visualization system interactivity. In particular, we discuss enhancements to collaborative communication capabilities, room interactivity and self-awareness, understanding of technical data, and the overall user interface of these visualization systems. In addition, we incorporate and explore various audio rendering techniques, including binaural playback, optimal panning, and target soundfield construction, toward this research goal. These improvements are achieved by integrating speaker arrays, microphone arrays, and other sensors and devices which will advance the KAUST Showcase space. Many of these technologies are applicable to the NexCAVE, IMR, and Cornea environments as well.

This year much of the equipment for the project was researched, acquired, and built. Specific demonstrations outlining the benefits of speaker array technology were given at KAUST in Jan 2011. Microphone array and speaker array interactivity demonstrations were shown as well. Detailed plans were made regarding the mounting and usage of such systems in the Showcase space at KAUST. These systems will support many other KAUST Visualization team projects and will enhance the KAUST Showcase space and its interactive applications.

Enhancing the intelligence and interactivity of the Showcase space is a goal that may require multimodal sensors, including head trackers and cameras, which are specified in other visualization projects. Data from these devices can be fused with captured audio signals to provide robust awareness of the state of the room and its occupants, therefore enhancing smart-room capabilities of the Showcase. This information will be used as feedback to the sound system for calibration or target-optimization purposes. 2012-01-17 to 2012-01-17 Tue, 09:30 to 11:30

Mikhail Moshkov WEP 125: Dagger: A Tool for Optimization and Analysis of Decision Trees and Rules Decision trees and rules are widely used in different applications as ways for knowledge representation, as parts of algorithms, and as parts of predictors (classifiers). Depending on the problem under consideration we need to minimize or maximize some cost functions: depth, average depth, number of nodes, number of misclassifications for decision trees; length, coverage, number of misclassifications for decision rules. Unfortunately, almost all mentioned optimization problems are NP-hard which means that most probably for these problems there are no polynomial time algorithms.

To avoid this “restriction” we created in KAUST a software system Dagger which is based on extensions of dynamic programming. This system allows sequential optimization of decision trees and rules relative to different cost functions. It can describe relationships between two cost functions, in particular, between depth and number of misclassifications of decision trees. Experiments show that Dagger is applicable to moderate size decision tables that came from real-life applications.

The aim of presentation is to acquaint students and researchers in KAUST with possibilities of Dagger which can be used in their study of experimental data. The expected time of the presentation is 90 minutes. The presentation contains simple introduction into used algorithms, and many experimental results. 2012-01-18 to 2012-01-18 Wed, 09:30 to 11:30

Galina  Rodionova WEP 067:&quot;Singing Children&quot;in Tajikistan Tajikistan is the poorest of the former Soviet republics, passed through civil war. Poverty and corruption are usual for this country.

&quot;Singing children&quot;is a non-governmental organization, which activity has begun in 2008 from several musical meetings in countryside. There is no musical education in kishlaks, but children sing difficult songs. Some texts are more than thousand year old. To keep this art, I have organized musical meetings of dwellers from different kishlaks and have written them on DVDs. Children began to work with these video documents. In some months they have returned to me to sing the written songs in a new fashion and to sing other songs.

Twice a year I come to countryside and I get together singing children from different kishlaks. We organize for them three-day trainings. Our next step is the creation of website www.Dojra.ru devoted to musical art and children&apos;s creativity. There are more than 300 our videos in YouTube now and more than 150 thousand viewings of our videos.

There is a political tension between Tajikistan and Uzbekistan , but in our meetings both Tajiks and Uzbeks participate, they sing some songs together.

For labor migrants, the majority from which works in Russia, Russian-speaking site www.Dojra.ru is a evidence of the respect for their culture.

The self-esteem of rural children and youth grows, supported with development of their talents.

The presentation will contain a lot of video documents. 2012-01-21 to 2012-01-21 Sat, 16:30 to 17:30

KHALED AlSaadi WEP 050: Information Diffusion In Social Networks: Observing and Affecting What Society Cares About Social networks have already emerged as a significant medium for the widespread distribution of news and instructions in mass convergence events such as the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election, the 2009 Presidential election in Iran, and emergencies like the landfall of Hurricanes Ike and Gustav in the fall of 2008. Use of social networks such as Facebook and Twitter has also been noted as providing great ease during the recent demonstrations in Middle East. In light of these notable outcomes, understanding information diffusion over online social networks is a critical research goal. This greater understanding can be achieved through data analysis, the development of reliable models that can predict outcomes of social processes, and ultimately the creation of applications that can shape the outcome of these processes. In this tutorial, we aim to provide an overview of such recent research based on a wide variety of techniques such as optimization algorithms, data mining, data streams covering a large number of problems such as influence spread maximization, misinformation limitation and study of trends in online social networks. 2012-01-22 to 2012-01-23 Sun, 09:30 to 11:30

Quang Bao WEP 251: Fiction&gt;Nonfiction: How To Make Up The Truth Thursday, January 5, 2012 at 9:16 AM from New York City. The first time that I have typed the year&quot;2012.&quot;Not true. I must have sent emails to friends --&quot;Happy New Year!&quot;&quot;Happy 2012!&quot;I wish it was true so I could connect now to an imaginary audience at Kaust. A stranger always feels a need to bring a gift.

Everyone has fiction upside down -- it doesn&apos;t have much to do with reality.&quot;What happened?&quot;is a very hard question to answer accurately. Good fiction starts this way: what happened next? There are only three kinds of narratives and they have all been written to the end. Writing is a compulsive person&apos;s need to share specifics. 2012-01-23 to 2012-01-23 Mon, 16:30 to 17:30
 
Catherine Newman WEP 115: Introduction to Physical Problem-Solving Scientists and engineers frequently face small and large design problems in the course of their work in research and industry and must constantly address these challenges creatively. These scientists and engineers benefit from training in “design thinking” as well as exposure to new materials and techniques that will inspire innovation and support the forward movement of their work. The study of “design thinking” skills and exposure to common materials, tools and electronics, presents a creative thinking paradigm which support the translation of ideas to reality in a manner pedagogically appropriate for graduate students outside of the design-centered disciplines. Addressing this educational need using strong pedagogical techniques supplements the theory-based knowledge learned throughout the academic year and provides real-world critical thinking skills which make recent graduates attractive hires.

The purpose of this course is to expose students materials, tools and electronics for prototyping. This is a beginning course, ideal for those with little or no hands-on experience but who are eager to learn. Participation is required for all 3 half-day sessions. 2012-01-23 to 2012-01-25 Mon, 09:30 to 11:30

WEP Film Festival WEP FF 21: Taking Root: Wangari Mathai Story Taking Root tells the dramatic story of Kenyan Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Wangari Maathai whose simple act of planting trees grew into a nationwide movement to safeguard the environment, protect human rights, and defend democracy—a movement for which this charismatic woman became an iconic inspiration.

Taking Root weaves a compelling and dramatic narrative of one woman&apos;s personal journey in the context of the turbulent political and environmental history of her country. Raised in the rural highlands of Kenya, educated in the United States during the 1960s civil rights era, and the first female to receive a PhD in East Africa, Maathai discovered the heart of her life&apos;s work by reconnecting with the rural women with whom she had grown up. They told her that their daily lives had become intolerable: they were walking longer distances for firewood, clean water had become scarce, the soil was disappearing from their fields, and their children were suffering from malnutrition. Maathai thought to herself,&quot;Well, why not plant trees?&quot;Trees provide shade, prevent soil erosion, supply firewood and building materials, and produce nutritious fruit to combat malnutrition. With this realization Maathai founded the Green Belt Movement, a grassroots organization encouraging rural women to plant trees.

Akhundov Arif WEP 103: Unsolved Problems of Particle Physics and Large Hadron Collider at CERN The Large Hadron Collider at CERN presents an unprecedented opportunity to probe the realm of New Physics in the TeV region and shed light on some of the core unresolved issues of Particle Physics. These include the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking, the origin of mass, the possible constituent of cold Dark Matter, new sources of CP violation needed to explain the baryon excess in the Universe, the possible existence of extra gauge groups and extra matter, and importantly the path Nature chooses to resolve the hierarchy problem - is it Supersymmetry or Extra Dimensions. Many models of New Physics beyond the Standard Model contain a hidden sector which can be probed at the LHC. Additionally, the LHC will be a top-quark factory and accurate measurements of the properties of the top-quark and its rare decays will provide a window to New Physics. An overview of these possibilities will be given in the lecture. 2012-01-24 to 2012-01-24 Tue, 09:30 to 11:30

Mohamed Abdel-Aal WEP 107: Where Do Computers Live? A Look at the Complex Data Centers that Host our Data and System Data centers are homes to computers that run critical applications and services that we all take for granted such as email and internet access. These complex facilities have become the focal point in organizations as the increasing demand for compute power is stressing the underlying infrastructure of space, power, and cooling.

Organizations are now adapting innovative technologies that allowed mechanical, electrical, and computer engineers to work closely together to solve fundamental challenges in the data center to make them efficient and cost effective.

This presentation will offer an introduction to data centers including an overview of its major systems and components. Topics include IT infrastructure demand, cooling techniques, and power management. The presentation will also cover basic design principles of data centers.

Attendees will be offered a special tour of the KAUST data centers to see the operation of these complex facilities in action. 2012-01-24 to 2012-01-24 Tue, 16:30 to 17:30

Patricia Vickers Rich WEP 143: Polar Dinosaurs and the First Animals on Earth. How Art and Science Work Together to Reconstruct the Ancient History of Our Planet This course consists of a two-day workshop and a field trip (Field Trip on Thursday 26, 15:30-17:30)

A book recently published by Cambridge University Press (&quot;The Artist and the Scientists&quot;) provides the basis for this series of lectures and workshops, as well as a&quot;field trip&quot;on the KAUST campus. The book provides an in depth look at how art is so important in communicating the science of palaeobiology - what the world was like in the past 600+ million years. Each of the artworks in this book is backed up by text written by the scientists who are presenters in this program and the artist who put the pictures together. Fossils of plants and animals, the very rocks themselves representing the sediments which entombed the fossils and the chemistry of those rocks, will be on show for the students to examine - all have something to provide scientist and artist alike the ability to reconstruct a long lost world. In the lectures and workshops students will meet the authors of this book, make their own casts of the fossils that the art has relied upon, they will look through microscopes at the tiny remains of spores and pollen that allowed the plant world around the animals to be reconstructed and they will have a chance at producing a piece of art which reconstructs the ancient environment that long ago existed where KAUST is today. Two time periods will be explored in detail - the time of the dinosaurs (some 100 million years ago) and the time of the first animals on the planet (some 550 million years ago). An understanding of our past makes it possible to predict and plan for a sustainable future. 2012-01-24 to 2012-01-26 Tue, 13:30 to 14:30

FILMMAKER STATEMENT
Wars, ugly wars, are part of this shrinking world. Why are they are still with us? The answer is clearly never simple. My film is not so much about pointing fingers but more about witnessing what these horrific wars in our extraordinary times do to ordinary people. I don&apos;t concentrate on policy makers and heroes instead choosing to focus on the wounds that ordinary people caught up in modern wars suffer and how their wounds continue to bleed even after the guns have fallen silent.

Christos Saragiotis WEP 068: Scientific typesetting with LaTeX WHAT LaTeX IS
LaTeX is a document markup language and document preparation system for the TeX typesetter. LaTeX is most widely used by mathematicians, scientists, engineers, philosophers, linguists, economists and other scholars in academia because of the high quality of typesetting achievable by TeX.

WHY LEARN LaTeX
Knowledge of LaTeX is indispensable for today’s students. In particular, LaTeX
• produces professionally looking scientific texts with elegant mathematical symbols,
• makes typing of mathematical symbols easy,
• facilitates the creation of structured documents (papers, articles, books, or theses),
• lets the writer concentrate on the text content rather than its appearance,
• uses text files (i.e. ASCII as opposed to binary), which are editable in any text editor and are small,
• has almost full back compatibility,
• is the preferred typesetting system for articles and books by many publishing and professional associations,
• is open-source.

LaTeX offers programmable desktop publishing features and extensive facilities for automating most aspects of typesetting and desktop publishing, including numbering and cross-referencing.

COURSE OBJECTIVES
After this course, the attendants should be able to know how to produce:
• simple documents,
• accented international symbols and write non-latin characters texts,
• mathematical formulae,
• advanced environments, such as lists, tables, theorems,
• list of tables, list of figures, index of terms,
• bibliography,
• cross-references to figures, tables, equations, pages, bibliographic references. 2012-01-25 to 2012-01-29 Sun, 09:30 to 11:30

Sid Samtaney WEP 121: Do we really need to be afraid of snakes? People over the world have viewed snakes as evil mythical creatures, pests, or disgusting slimy creatures when in fact this is false. In this presentation I will discuss the many species of snakes including ones found in Saudi Arabia and hopefully convince you that these are not necessarily harmful or dangerous to humans and that, in fact, they deserve our respect. Snakes play a vital role in our environment because they are responsible for eliminating disease-causing pests such as mice and rats, If people continue to kill snakes our eco-system will be imbalanced. Snakes are a natural rat eliminator that we can use to our advantage rather than using a rat poison, which might be harmful to our environment. It is generally out of ignorance and baseless fear that many people&apos;s first reaction is to obliterate a snake the moment they see one, not realizing how much they are actually damaging the environment. A snake is only a threat to you when you become a threat to it. My goal is to educate the KAUST community about the benefits of having snakes as a part of our ecosystem. 2012-01-25 to 2012-01-25 Wed, 17:00 to 18:00

Before meeting Roger, Didier battles overwhelming fear, poor visibility and diving partners too terrified to back them up.

In the clear waters of the Okavango Delta, he had one fleeting encounter with a giant crocodile that disappeared into a huge underwater cave and it became his obsession to explore the mystery of the dragon’s lair. Roger joins Didier and the two encounter terrifying black outs, deadly hippos, and crocodiles who attempt to eat them. They then discover, deep in the darkest lair, a 14 foot crocodile that accepts their presence, allowing them to bring back footage that defies belief.

These men use the strength of their beliefs and their intimate knowledge of animals to bridge the ancient interface between man and reptile.

Same venue and Time.
Thank you for your understanding.

Enzo and Jacques have known each other for a long time. Their friendship started in their childhood days in the mediterranean. They were not real friends in these days, but there was something they both loved and used to do the whole day long: diving. One day Jacques&apos;father, who was a diver too, died in the mediterranean sea. After that incident Enzo and Jacques lost contact. After several years, Enzo and Jacques had grown up, Johanna, a young clerk in a security office, has to go to Peru. There she meets Jacques who works for a group of scientist. He dives for some minutes into ice cold water and the scientist monitor his physical state that is more like a dolphin&apos;s than a human&apos;s. Johanna can not believe what she sees and gets very interested in Jacques but she&apos;s unable to get acquainted with him. Some weeks later, back in her office, she notices a championship for divers that is supposed to take place in Taormina, Italy. In order to see Jacques again she makes up a story so the firm sends her to Italy for business purposes. In Taormina there is also Enzo, the reigning diving world champion. He knows that only Jacques can challenge and probably beat him. This time Johanna and Jacques get closer, but Jacques, being more a dolphin than a man, can not really commit and his rivalry with Enzo pushes both man into dangerous territory...

Before meeting Roger, Didier battles overwhelming fear, poor visibility and diving partners too terrified to back them up.

In the clear waters of the Okavango Delta, he had one fleeting encounter with a giant crocodile that disappeared into a huge underwater cave and it became his obsession to explore the mystery of the dragon’s lair. Roger joins Didier and the two encounter terrifying black outs, deadly hippos, and crocodiles who attempt to eat them. They then discover, deep in the darkest lair, a 14 foot crocodile that accepts their presence, allowing them to bring back footage that defies belief.

These men use the strength of their beliefs and their intimate knowledge of animals to bridge the ancient interface between man and reptile.

H. Seliger WEP 075: Aspects of Biopolymer Science. I. Biomaterials – Bioplastics Will there be plastic materials in a world without fossil carbon sources? Likely yes. Already the annual production of biomass exceeds the predicted total reserves of petroleum. But there is still a long way from biopolymers to competitive plastics: only 1% of the global market is currently based on renewable resources. Major problems: (i) Changing quality of raw material; (ii) lack of experience; (iii) increasing demand of agro-production for food; (iv) priority given to bio-energy.

The criteria usually characterizing materials as either “bio-based” and “bio-degradable” or “petro-based” and “non- (i.e. very sluggishly) degradable” are no longer conditional. The petrochemical industry produces materials, that readily bio-degrade. From biomass routes have recently been developed to long-lived commodity plastics, such as polyethylene or polypropylene.

That bio-plastics can substitute for fossil-based materials for a multitude of applications, is exemplified for the development of PHB-based polyester-urethanes. PHB and PHB-V ( poly-3-hydroxy-butyrate and poly-3-hydroxy-butyrate-co-valerate ) are fermentation products from agrarian waste (molasses, glycerol from bio-diesel, whey etc.). PHB is a nearly ideal polymer concerning aspects of sustainability, however, it is unfavourable from its material properties. We have solved these problems by converting PHB into polyester-urethanes (PEU), tough-elastic materials with a highly increased melting range. Their properties are determined mainly by the structure and input ratio of the components, ranging from highly elastic to hard, but throughout hydrophobic. We could substantially decrease the cost of production by preparing BLENDS or COMPOSITES, which can be prepared to have properties similar to conventional plastics, like e.g. high-density polyethylene or compounded polypropylene.

Cornie Scheffer WEP 049: Practical Fundamentals of Biomedical Engineering This workshop is a basic introduction and overview of the very exciting field of biomedical engineering. Biomedical engineering involves applying the concepts, knowledge and approaches of virtually all engineering disciplines to solve or improve healthcare related problems. Biomedical engineers use their expertise in biology, medicine, physics, mathematics, engineering science and communication to make the world a healthier place. The challenges created by the diversity and complexity of living systems require creative, knowledgeable, and imaginative people working in teams of physicians, scientists, engineers, and even business folk to monitor, restore and enhance normal body function. The biomedical engineer is ideally trained to work at the intersection of science, medicine and mathematics to solve biological and medical problems.

The purpose of the short course is to serve as an introduction to the basic engineering concepts used by modern biomedical engineers. A student that attends this short will obtain a good overview of the engineering and physics principles that are applied in the field of modern biomedical engineering. These principles will be taught by incorporating examples from industry and research laboratories. Topics to be covered will include biomimicry, design of biomechanical devices (such as implants), electro-mechanical devices (such as surgical robots), E-medicine devices (for instance mobile phones) and artificial intelligence in medicine. Everyone with an interest in the intersection between engineering and medicine are invited to attend! 2012-01-28 to 2012-01-29 Sun, 09:30 to 11:30

Kazunari Domen WEP 058: Solar Energy Conversion Solar energy is abundant and renewable energy resource. Many approaches have been developed for solar energy conversion to the energy matters that we can use. To utilize the solar energy in a large scale, it is necessary to develop a technology to cover a large area where sunlight reaches and to convert into storable and transportable energy, i.e. chemical energy. Water splitting to generate hydrogen is one of the most attractive candidates for the purpose. In this event, photocatalytic water splitting on photocatalysts will be discussed in detail comparing with other methods of hydrogen generation from water. 2012-01-28 to 2012-01-28 Sat, 09:30 to 15:00

H. Seliger WEP 075: Aspects of Biopolymer Science. II. Nucleic Acid Pharmaceuticals A nucleic acids technology has evolved utilizing the specific recognition of nucleic acid sequences by biological nucleic acids and proteins. Efforts concentrate on gene silencing and other potential pharmaceutical applications. Long studied are “antisense” oligonucleotides. The idea is simple: Synthetic nucleic acid fragments are to bind stably and selectively to the mRNA of a pathogenic protein to block its expression. Unfortunately, in spite of an enormous input of money and labour, few oligonucleotide pharmaceuticals are on the market, of which only one is truly based on the antisense principle. The reason is, that these developments have met with a number of serious problems: 1. Extraneous nucleic acids are usually rapidly degraded in cells and body fluids. Therefore, antisense oligonucleotides have to be structurally modified in order to avoid breakdown. 2. A pathogenic protein can only be effectively eliminated, if the respective mRNA is irreversibly degraded. Ribonuclease H, for instance, cleaves DNA-RNA hybrid double strands, but often not recognizes complexes of mRNA with structurally modified oligonucleotides. 3. The efficient and targeted cellular uptake of antisense oligonucleotides is still a problem.

This report focuses on two developments from our research: (1.) Methods have been developed to promote the internalization of oligonucleotides (a) by conjugation with “cell penetrating peptides”, (b) by the application of oligonucleotide-loaded nanoparticles. (2.) Since for the solid-phase production of oligonucleotide drugs the polymeric carrier is a major cost factor, supports with unusually high loading capacity have been developed. Such carriers can contain 400 µmol nucleotides per gram, still maintaining ca. 99% yield of stepwise chain elongation.
