 Nov. 16: Free Taco Day! 
 Jack in the Box is offering two free tacos for customers today, Nov. 16. How can you find more free fast food deals? 
 Looking for a mid-afternoon or before-dinner snack ? Hit up Jack in the Box for free tacos anytime after 2 p.m.

Customer appreciation

Jack in the Box is offering free tacos today for anyone who comes in the door -- no coupon necessary. The fast-food restaurant is doing this as a big thank you to their loyal customers.

The catch? Don&apos;t come top hungry -- there is a limit of two tacos.

Now, we&apos;re not trying to tell you to take advantage of the system -- but you could enlist the help of your entire family and get more than two tacos. How? Just have each one of your family members go in to Jack in the Box separately for their two tacos. Easy dinner for a Tuesday night!

OK, OK. We kid -- we don&apos;t recommend that you only feed your family free tacos tonight. However, two free tacos is a nice free treat for an otherwise-boring Tuesday night.

More free fast food

It&apos;s possible to get ahold of free fast food every day. No, you don&apos;t have to lie, cheat or steal -- all you need to do is keep an eye out on their official Facebook pages of your favorite fast food restaurants. Restaurants are known to offer special deals to their Facebook or Twitter fans -- you just have to keep an eye out.

Also, many fast food restaurants offer free food to those willing to fill out surveys about their service. For example, you can get a free Roast Beef sandwich for filling out a short survey for Arby&apos;s. Or, get a free Junior Whopper by filling out a survey located on your register receipt. It&apos;s not much, but every little bit helps and who doesn&apos;t like to save money?

But, don&apos;t forget: get to Jack in the Box and claim your free tacos!

More fun food!

Comments on &quot;Jack in the Box: Free tacos today!&quot;
 Brenda Franklin November 16, 2010 | 4:15 PM 
Got my free tacos. It was very nice that JITB was giving out free tacos, and I appreciate it.......but, there was nothing on them except refried beans and lettuce, very flat and had been sitting for a long time. I&apos;m afraid there are going to be a lot of disappointed customers. Some children probably couldn&apos;t even eat them. Sorry.
