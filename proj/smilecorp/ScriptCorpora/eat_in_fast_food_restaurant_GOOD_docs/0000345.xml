&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;A minister decided to do something a little
&gt;&gt;different one Sunday
&gt;&gt;morning.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;He said&quot;Today, in church, I am going to say a
&gt;&gt;single word and you are
&gt;&gt;going to help me preach.&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Whatever single word I say, I want you to sing
&gt;&gt;whatever hymn that comes
&gt;&gt;to your mind.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The pastor shouted out&quot;CROSS..&quot;
&gt;&gt;Immediately the congregation started singing in
&gt;&gt;unison,&quot;THE OLD RUGGED
&gt;&gt;CROSS.&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The pastor hollered out&quot;GRACE.&quot;
&gt;&gt;The congregation began to sing&quot;AMAZING GRACE,
&gt;&gt;how sweet the sound.&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The pastor said&quot;POWER&quot;
&gt;&gt;The congregation sang&quot;THERE IS POWER IN THE
&gt;&gt;BLOOD&quot;.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The Pastor said&quot;SEX&quot;
&gt;&gt;The congregation fell in total silence.
&gt;&gt;Everyone was in shock. They all
&gt;&gt;nervously began to lookaround at each other
&gt;&gt;afraid to say anything.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Then all of a sudden, way from in the back of
&gt;&gt;the church, a little old
&gt;&gt;87 year old grandmother stood up and began to
&gt;&gt;sing&quot;PRECIOUS MEMORIES.&quot; marvin g October 1st, 2003, 03:22 PM A mother and her son were flying Southwest Airlines from Kansas City
to Chicago.

The son (who had been looking out the window) turned to his
mother and asked&quot;If big dogs have baby dogs and big cats have baby
cats, why don&apos;t big planes have baby planes?&quot;

The mother (who couldn&apos;t think of an answer) told her son to
ask the stewardess.

So the boy asked the stewardess,&quot;If big dogs have baby dogs
and big cats have baby cats, why don&apos;t big planes have baby planes?&quot;

The stewardess responded,&quot;Did your mother tell you to ask me?&quot;

The boy said,&quot;Yes she did.&quot;

Well, then, tell your mother that there are no baby planes
because Southwest always pulls out on time.
Have your mother explain that to you.&quot; marvin g October 7th, 2003, 03:18 PM &gt;Joe wanted to buy a motorcycle. He doesn&apos;t have much luck,
&gt;&gt;until, one day,
&gt;&gt;&gt;he comes across a beautiful Honda Gold Wing with a for sale sign
&gt;&gt;on it. The
&gt;&gt;&gt;bike seems even more beautiful than a new one, although it is 10
&gt;&gt;years old.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It is shiny and in absolutely mint condition. He immediately
&gt;&gt;buys it, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;asks the seller how he kept it in such great condition for 10
&gt;&gt;years.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Well, it&apos;s quite simple, really,&quot;says the seller,&quot;whenever
&gt;&gt;the bike is
&gt;&gt;&gt;outside and it&apos;s going to rain, rub Vaseline on the chrome. It
&gt;&gt;protects it
&gt;&gt;&gt;from the moisture.&quot;And he hands Joe a jar of Vaseline.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That night, his girlfriend, Sandra, invites him over to meet
&gt;&gt;her parents.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Naturally, they take the bike there. But just before they enter
&gt;&gt;the house,
&gt;&gt;&gt;Sandra stops him and says,&quot;I have to tell you something about my
&gt;&gt;family
&gt;&gt;&gt;before we go in. When we eat dinner, we don&apos;t talk. In fact, the
&gt;&gt;first
&gt;&gt;&gt;person who says anything during dinner has to do the dishes.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;No problem,&quot;he says. And in they go. Joe is shocked. Right
&gt;&gt;smack in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;middle of the living room is a huge stack of dirty dishes. In the
&gt;&gt;kitchen is
&gt;&gt;&gt;another huge stack of dishes. Piled up on the stairs, in the
&gt;&gt;corridor,
&gt;&gt;&gt;everywhere he looks, dirty dishes. They sit down to dinner and,
&gt;&gt;sure enough,
&gt;&gt;&gt;no one says a word.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As dinner progresses, Joe decides to take advantage of the
&gt;&gt;situation.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So he leans over and kisses Sandra. No one says a word. So he
&gt;&gt;arches over
&gt;&gt;&gt;and fondles her breasts. Still, nobody says a word.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So he stands up, grabs her, rips her clothes off, throws her
&gt;&gt;on the table,
&gt;&gt;&gt;and takes her right there, in front of her parents. His
&gt;&gt;girlfriend is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;little flustered, her dad is obviously livid, and her mom
&gt;&gt;horrified when he
&gt;&gt;&gt;sits back down, but no one says a word.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;He looks at her mom.&quot;She&apos;s got a great body&quot;, he thinks. So
&gt;&gt;he grabs the
&gt;&gt;&gt;mom, bends her over the dinner table, and has his way with her
&gt;&gt;every which
&gt;&gt;&gt;way right there on the dinner table. Now his girlfriend is
&gt;&gt;furious and her
&gt;&gt;&gt;dad is boiling, but still, total silence.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;All of a sudden there is a loud clap of thunder, and it starts
&gt;&gt;to rain.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Joe remembers his motorcycle, so he pulls the jar of Vaseline
&gt;&gt;from his
&gt;&gt;&gt;pocket.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Suddenly the father backs away from the table and shouts:
&gt;&gt;&quot;Alright,
&gt;&gt;&gt;enough already, I&apos;ll do the f****** dishes!&quot; Tenorman October 11th, 2003, 11:49 AM A young lady had managed to arrange consecutive evening dates with a trumpet player, a tuba player and a french horn player. Each night on her return she relayed the evening&apos;s events to her flatmate.

She did not like being kissed by the trumpet player - his lips were too hard and pointed

She did not like being kissed by the Tuba player - his lips were too soft and flabby

She was not keen on the French Horn player&apos;s kissing either, but she did like the way he held her marvin g October 15th, 2003, 03:00 PM A blonde had just totaled her car in a
&gt;devastating accident. Miraculously, she
&gt;managed to pry herself from the wreckage
&gt;without a scratch and was applying fresh
&gt;lipstick when the state trooper arrived.
&gt;&quot;Oh My Gosh!&quot;the trooper gasped,&quot;Your car
&gt;looks like an accordion that was stomped on by
&gt;an elephant. Are you OK ma&apos;am?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yes officer, I&apos;m just fine!&quot;the blonde
&gt;chirped.
&gt;&quot;Well, how in the world did this happen?&quot;the
&gt;officer asked as he surveyed the wrecked car.
&gt;&quot;Officer, it was the strangest thing!&quot;the
&gt;blonde began.&quot;I was driving along this road
&gt;when from out of nowhere this TREE pops up in
&gt;front of me. So I swerved to the right, and
&gt;there was another tree! I swerved to the left
&gt;and there was ANOTHER tree! I swerved to the
&gt;right and there was another tree! I swerved to
&gt;the left and there was...&quot;
&gt;&quot;Uh, ma&apos;am&quot;, the officer said, cutting her off.
&gt;&quot;There isn&apos;t a tree on this road for 30 miles.
&gt;That was your air freshener swinging back and
&gt;forth&quot;. Tenorman October 15th, 2003, 03:13 PM I didn&apos;t realise that they had Essex girl jokes in Chicago!!:D

(That&apos;s one the Brits are more likely to understand) marvin g October 17th, 2003, 03:50 PM &gt;&gt;FOR MEN TIRED OF RECEIVING
&gt;MALE-BASHING JOKES
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How many men does it take to open a
&gt;beer?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;None. It should be opened by the
&gt;time she brings it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;----------------------------------------
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Why is a Laundromat a really bad
&gt;place to pick up a woman?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Because a woman who can&apos;t even
&gt;afford a washing machine will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;probably never be able to support
&gt;you.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;----------------------------------------
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Why do women have smaller feet than
&gt;men?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It&apos;s one of those&quot;evolutionary
&gt;things&quot;that allows them to stand
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;closer to the kitchen sink.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;----------------------------------------
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How do you know when a woman is
&gt;about to say something smart?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;When she starts her sentence with
&gt;&quot;A man once told me...&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;----------------------------------------
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How do you fix a woman&apos;s watch?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You don&apos;t. There is a clock on the
&gt;oven.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;----------------------------------------
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Why do men break wind more than
&gt;women?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Because women can&apos;t shut up long
&gt;enough to build up the required
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;pressure.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;----------------------------------------
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If your dog is barking at the back
&gt;door and your wife is yelling at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the front door, who do you let in
&gt;first?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The dog, of course. He&apos;ll shut up
&gt;once you let him in.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;----------------------------------------
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What&apos;s worse than a Male Chauvinist
&gt;Pig?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A woman who won&apos;t do what she&apos;s
&gt;told.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;--------------------------------------
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I married Miss Right. I just didn&apos;t
&gt;know her
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;first name was Always.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;----------------------------------------
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I haven&apos;t spoken to my wife for 18
&gt;months:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don&apos;t like to interrupt her.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;----------------------------------------
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Marriage is a 3-ring circus:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Engagement Ring, Wedding Ring,
&gt;Suffer-ring.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;----------------------------------------
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Our last fight was my fault: My
&gt;wife asked me&quot;What&apos;s on the TV?&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I said,&quot;Dust!&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;----------------------------------------
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In the beginning, God created the
&gt;earth and rested.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Then God created Man and rested.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Then God created Woman.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Since then, neither God nor Man has
&gt;rested.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;------------------------------------------
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Why do men die before their wives?
&gt;They want to.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;----------------------------------------
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A man inserted an advertisement in
&gt;the classified:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Wife Wanted.&quot;The next day he
&gt;received a hundred letters. They all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;said the same thing:&quot;You can have
&gt;mine.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;----------------------------------------
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The most effective way to remember
&gt;your wife&apos;s
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;birthday is to forget it once.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;--------------------------------------- clifton October 20th, 2003, 09:39 AM In the late 1950&apos;s, it was rumored that a famous jazz saxophonist was undergoing a sex change operation.

oh sorry this was a thread for good jokes. marvin g October 22nd, 2003, 02:16 PM Two old men decide they are close to their last days on earth and decide
&gt;to have a last night on the town. After a few drinks they end up at the
&gt;local brothel.
&gt;
&gt;The madam takes one look at the two old geezers and whispers to her
&gt;manager,&quot;go up to the first two rooms and put an inflated doll in each
&gt;bed. These two are so old and drunk, I&apos;m not wasting two of my girls on
&gt;them. They won&apos;t know the difference.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Her manager does as he is told and the two old men go upstairs and take
&gt;care of their business.
&gt;As they are walking home the first one says,&quot;You know, I think my girl
&gt;was dead!&quot;
&gt;
&gt;&quot;Dead?&quot;says his friend,&quot;why would you think that?&quot;&quot;Well, she never
&gt;moved or made a sound all the time I was loving her.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;His friend says,&quot;I think mine was a witch.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;&quot;A WITCH!!! Why the hell would you say that?&quot;
&gt;
&gt;&quot;Well, I was making love to her, kissing on her neck and I gave it a
&gt;little bite, then she farted and flew out the window!!&quot; marvin g November 21st, 2003, 02:58 PM &gt;A very attractive lady goes up to the bar. She
gestures alluringly to the
&gt;&gt;bartender who comes over immediately. When he
arrives, she seductively
&gt;&gt;signals that he should bring his face closer to
hers. When he does, she
&gt;&gt;begins to gently caress his full beard.&quot;Are you
the manager?&quot;she asks
&gt;&gt;softly stroking his face with both hands.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&quot;Actually, I&apos;m not,&quot;says the man.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&quot;Can you get him for me? I need to speak to him,&quot;
she says, running her
&gt;&gt;hands beyond his beard and into his hair.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&quot;I&apos;m afraid I can&apos;t,&quot;breathes the bartender.&quot;Is
there anything I can do?&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&quot;Yes, there is. I need you to give him a message,&quot;
she continues, running
&gt;&gt;her forefinger across the bartender&apos;s lips and
slyly popping a coupl e of
&gt;her
&gt;&gt;fingers into his mouth and allowing him to nip them
gently.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&quot;What should I tell him?&quot;the bartender manages to
say around her delicate
&gt;&gt;fingers.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&quot;Tell him,&quot;she whispers,&quot;there is no toilet
paper, hand soap or paper
&gt;&gt;towels in the ladies room.&quot; marvin g November 24th, 2003, 03:32 PM A lady walks into a drug store and tells the pharmacist she needs some
&gt;&gt;&gt;cyanide. The pharmacist said,&quot;Why in the world do you need cyanide?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The lady then explained she needed it to poison her husband.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The pharmacist&apos;s eyes got big and he said,&quot;Lord have mercy, I can&apos;t
&gt;&gt;&gt;give you cyanide to kill your husband! That&apos;s against the law! They&apos;ll throw
&gt;&gt;&gt;both of us in jail and I&apos;ll lose my license.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Then the lady reached into her purse and pulled out a picture of her
&gt;&gt;&gt;husband in bed with the pharmacist&apos;s wife and handed it to the pharmacist.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The pharmacist looked at the picture and replied,&quot;Well now, you didn&apos;t
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;tell me you had a prescription.&quot; marvin g November 26th, 2003, 03:08 PM SENIOR MOMENTS:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;SENIOR DRIVING
&gt;&gt;As a senior citizen was driving down the freeway, his car phone rang.
&gt;&gt;Answering, he heard his wife&apos;s voice urgently warning him,&quot;Herman, I just
&gt;&gt;heard on the news that there&apos;s a car going the wrong way on Interstate 77.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Please be careful!&quot;
&gt;&gt;&quot;Hell,&quot;said Herman,&quot;It&apos;s not just one car. It&apos;s hundreds of them!&quot;
&gt;&gt;__________________________________________________ ______________&quot;I CAN
&gt;&gt;HEAR JUST FINE!&quot;
&gt;&gt;Three retirees, each with a hearing loss, were playing golf one fine March
&gt;&gt;day. One remarked to the other,&quot;Windy, isn&apos;t it?&quot;
&gt;&gt;&quot;No,&quot;the second man replied,&quot;it&apos;s Thursday.&quot;
&gt;&gt;And the third man chimed in,&quot;So am I. Let&apos;s have a beer.&quot;
&gt;&gt;__________________________________________________ ______________SENIOR
&gt;&gt;MOMENTS II
&gt;&gt;Two elderly ladies had been friends for many decades. Over the years they
&gt;&gt;had shared all kinds of activities and adventures. Lately, their
&gt;&gt;activities had been limited to meeting a few times a week to play cards.
&gt;&gt;One day they were playing cards when one looked at the other and said,
&gt;&gt;&quot;Now don&apos;t get mad at me.....I know we&apos;ve been friends for a long
&gt;&gt;time.....but I just can&apos;t think of your name! I&apos;ve thought and thought,
&gt;&gt;but I can&apos;t remember it. Please tell me what your name is.&quot;
&gt;&gt;Her friend glared at her. For at least three minutes she just stared and
&gt;&gt;glared at her. Finally she said,&quot;How soon do you need to know?&quot;
&gt;&gt;__________________________________________________ ______________
&gt;&gt;DRIVING
&gt;&gt;Two elderly women were out driving in a large car - both could barely see
&gt;&gt;over the dashboard. As they were cruising along, they came to an
&gt;&gt;intersection.. The stoplight was red, but they just went on through. The
&gt;&gt;woman in the passenger seat thought to herself&quot;I must be losing it. I
&gt;&gt;could have sworn we just went through a red light&quot;.
&gt;&gt;After a few more minutes, they came to another intersection and the light
&gt;&gt;was red again. Again, they went right through. The woman in the passenger
&gt;&gt;seat was almost sure that the light had been red but was really concerned
&gt;&gt;that she was losing it. She was getting nervous and decided to pay very
&gt;&gt;close attention to the road and the next intersection.
&gt;&gt;At the next intersection, sure enough, the light was red and they went on
&gt;&gt;through. So, she turned to the other woman and said,&quot;Mildred, did you
&gt;&gt;know that we just ran through three red lights in a row? You could have
&gt;&gt;killed us both!&quot;
&gt;&gt;Mildred turned to her and said,&quot;Oh, am I driving?&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;__________________________________________________ ______________ROMANCE
&gt;&gt;An older couple were lying in bed one night. The husband was falling
&gt;&gt;asleep but the wife was in a romantic mood and wanted to talk. She said:
&gt;&gt;&quot;You used to hold my hand when we were courting.&quot;
&gt;&gt;Wearily he reached across, held her hand for a second and tried to get
&gt;&gt;back to sleep. A few moments later she said:&quot;Then you used to kiss me.&quot;
&gt;&gt;Mildly irritated, he reached across, gave her a peck on the cheek and
&gt;&gt;settled down to sleep.
&gt;&gt;Thirty seconds later she said:&quot;Then you used to bite my neck.&quot;Angrily,
&gt;&gt;he threw back the bed clothes and got out of bed.
&gt;&gt;&quot;Where are you going?&quot;she asked.
&gt;&gt;&quot;To get my teeth!&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;_________________________________________________
&gt;&gt;SEE.NILE
&gt;&gt;Three sisters, ages 92, 94, and 96 live in a house together. One night the
&gt;&gt;96 year old draws a bath. She puts one foot in and pauses. She yells down
&gt;&gt;the stairs,&quot;Was I getting in or out of the bath?&quot;
&gt;&gt;The 94 year old yells back,&quot;I don&apos;t know. I&apos;ll come up and see.&quot;
&gt;&gt;She starts up the stairs and pauses. Then, she yells,&quot;Was I going up the
&gt;&gt;stairs or down?&quot;
&gt;&gt;The 92 year old is sitting at the kitchen table having tea, listening to
&gt;&gt;her sisters. She shakes her head and says,&quot;I sure hope I never get that
&gt;&gt;forgetful.&quot;She knocks on wood for good measure.
&gt;&gt;She then yells,&quot;I&apos;ll come up and help both of you as soon as I see who&apos;s
&gt;&gt;at the door.&quot; marvin g December 2nd, 2003, 04:27 PM ONE FOR ADAM:

Two blonde gals went together to play the slot
&gt;machines at the casino.
&gt;Each agreed that when her allotted money was gone,
&gt;she would go to the
&gt;front of the casino and sit on the bench to wait for
&gt;the
&gt;other.
&gt;Trixie quickly lost all her money and went to sit on
&gt;the bench.
&gt;She waited and waited. After what seemed an
&gt;eternity, she finally saw
&gt;Patty coming toward her, carrying this huge sack of
&gt;coins.
&gt;&quot;Hey, Trixie,&quot;said Patty,&quot;how&apos;d you do?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Not very good,&quot;came the reply.&quot;I&apos;ve been waiting
&gt;here for hours.&quot;
&gt;Patty said:&quot;You should have been with me . . . did
&gt;I
&gt;ever find a good machine! It&apos;s way in the back.
&gt;Come! I&apos;ll show it
&gt;to you . . . you can&apos;t lose! Ever time you put a
&gt;dollar in, you win
&gt;four quarters!&quot; marvin g December 11th, 2003, 04:48 PM Bob received a parrot as a gift. The parrot had a bad attitude and an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;even worse vocabulary. Every word out of the bird&apos;s mouth was laced
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;with profanity.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bob tried and tried to change the bird&apos;s attitude by saying only
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;polite words, playing soft music and doing anything else he could
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;think of to clean up the bird&apos;s vocabulary.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Finally, he was fed up. He yelled at the parrot. The parrot squawked
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;back. John shook the parrot, who then uttered the most awful stream of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;profanities.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bob, in desperation, grabbed the bird and put him in the freezer. For
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a few minutes the parrot squawked and kicked. Then suddenly there was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;total quiet. Not a squawk was heard.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Fearing that he&apos;d hurt the parrot, Bob opened the door to the freezer.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The parrot calmly stepped out onto John&apos;s outstretched arms and said
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;I believe I may have offended you with my rude language. I&apos;m
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;sincerely remorseful for my inappropriate behavior and vocabulary
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;transgressions and I fully intend to do everything I can to correct my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rude and unforgivable behavior.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bob was stunned at the change in the bird&apos;s attitude. As he was about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to ask the parrot what had made such a dramatic change in his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;behavior, the bird continued,&quot;May I ask what the turkey did?&quot; marvin g December 16th, 2003, 04:36 PM REMEMBER THIS AT CHRISTMAS TIME...

According to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, while both male and
female reindeer grow antlers in the summer each year, male reindeer drop
their antlers at the beginning of winter, usually late November to
mid-December. Female reindeer retain their antlers till after they give
&gt;birth in the spring.
&gt;
&gt;Therefore, according to EVERY historical rendition depicting Santa&apos;s
reindeer, EVERY single one of them, from Rudolph to Blitzen, had to be a

A store that sells husbands has just opened, where woman may go to choose a husband from among many men. The store is comprised of 6 floors, and the men increase in positive attributes as the shopper ascends the flights. There is however, a catch. As you open the door to any floor you may choose a man from that floor, but if you go up a floor, you cannot go back down except to exit the building.
So a woman goes to the shopping center to find a husband. On the first floor the sign on the door reads: Floor 1 These men have jobs! The woman reads the sign and says to herself, Well thats better than my last boyfriend, but I wonder whats further up? So up she goes.
The second floor sign reads: Floor 2 These men have jobs and love kids! The woman remarks to herself, thats great, but I wonder whats further up? And she goes up again.
The third floor sign reads: Floor 3 - These men have jobs, love kids and are extremely good looking! Hmm, better she says. But I wonder whats upstairs?
The fourth floor sign reads: Floor 4 These men have jobs, love kids, are extremely good looking and help with the house work! WOW! exclaims the woman, very tempting. BUT there must be more further up! And again the woman heads up another flight.
The fifth floor sign reads: Floor 5 These men have jobs, love kids, are extremely good looking, help with the housework and have a strong romantic streak! Oh, mercy me! But just thinkwhat must be awaiting me further up?So up to the sixth floor she goes.
The sixth floor sign reads: Floor 6 You are visitor 3,456,789,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please!

Thank you for shopping at Husband Mart and have a nice day! James January 18th, 2004, 12:36 AM Originally posted by Frank Mullen
&quot;Charlie Parker in Hell&quot;by Gary Larsen

Parker is seen in a cell while devils play rock and roll albums for him

Well............almost. In&quot;Charlie Parker&apos;s Private Hell&quot;Bird is depicted screaming in a glass-walled cell, while the devil is spinning one&quot;smooth jazz&quot;record after another.

The cover art previously referred to appears on the &apos;89 Concord duo release titled&quot;Doggin&apos; Around&quot;with Herb Ellis&amp;Red Mitchell.
In the liner notes, Gary wrote the following:

&quot;In a way, the cover design for this compact disc was an opportunity for me to repay a debt. I&apos;ve drawn so many&quot;Far Side&quot;cartoons while listening to Herb Ellis (and a small handful of other jazz musicians) that I probably owe him a credit line on most of my work --- let alone a cover. Nothing gets my juices going like the sounds he and Red have turned out here. It was a pleasure to draw.&quot;

Bill Frisell told a buddy of mine a funny story during a live radio interview. I guess Gary was aware that Bill&apos;s home was quite close to his own. He wanted to establish a dialogue with Bill, but couldn&apos;t bring himself to just walk up and knock on his door. So he had a beautiful (and expensive) custom-made guitar built, and with a note enclosed in it&apos;s case, found a way to lower it into Bill&apos;s backyard over a fence!! Not surprisingly (but amusingly!), Bill was a longtime admirer of Gary&apos;s work.

I can think of at least four&quot;jazz cartoons&quot;written by Gary, so I have to guess that there are more. The cover cartoon for&quot;Doggin&apos; Around&quot;is great ---- depicting an audience of&quot;dog&quot;jazz fans (and musicians) hangin&apos; out in a club called The Stuffed Cat; complete with a stuffed cat hanging over the entryway. Anyone familiar with Larsen is aware of his disdain for cats, and favoritism for dogs. This is what makes this particular cartoon extra funny --- Gary gets in two licks at once; taking a shot at felines while giving a thumbs-up for jazz.

On the subject of&quot;strategies for the jazz community&quot;there is little doubt in my mind that there are other high profile folks out there who love jazz, but aren&apos;t speaking up. I respect Gary for both his great talent, and his outspoken support of our music. marvin g January 19th, 2004, 03:04 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Passengers on a small commuter plane are waiting for the flight to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;leave. They&apos;re getting a little impatient, but the airport staff has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;assured them that the pilots will be there soon, and the flight can
&gt;take
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;off immediately after that.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The entrance opens, and two men walk up the aisle, dressed in pilots&apos;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;uniforms both are wearing dark glasses, one is using a seeing eye dog,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and the other is tapping his way up the aisle with a white cane.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Nervous laughter spreads through the cabin; but the men enter the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;cockpit, the door closes, and the engines start up. The passengers
&gt;begin
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;glancing nervously around, searching for some sign that this is just a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;little practical joke.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;None is forthcoming.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The plane moves faster and faster down the runway, and people at the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;windows realize that they&apos;re headed straight for the water at the edge
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of the airport territory. As it begins to look as though the plane
will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;never take off, that it will plough into the water, panicked screams
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fill the cabin but at that moment, the plane lifts smoothly into the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;air. The passengers relax and laugh a little sheepishly, and soon they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;have all retreated into their magazines, secure in the knowledge that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the plane is in good hands.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Up in the cockpit, the co-pilot turns to the pilot and says,&quot;You
know,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bob, one of these days, they&apos;re going to scream too late, and we&apos;re
all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;gonna die.&quot; marvin g January 20th, 2004, 03:11 PM An elderly couple had been dating for some time. Finally they decided it
was time for marriage. Before the wedding, they went out to dinner and had a
long conversation regarding how their marriage might work. They discussed
finances, living arrangements and so on. Finally the old gentleman decided
it was time to broach the subject of their physical relationship.

&quot;How do you feel about sex?&quot;he asked, rather trustingly.&quot;Well,&quot;she
says, responding very carefully,&quot;I&apos;d have to say I
would like it infreuently.&quot;

The old gentleman sat quietly for a moment. Then over his glasses, he
looked her in the eye casually and asked,&quot;Was that one or two words?&quot; bubber January 26th, 2004, 03:26 AM As a follow up on elderly people I would like to add:

Homeless marvin g January 30th, 2004, 03:09 PM Why Am I Tired?

For a couple years I&apos;ve been blaming it on lack of sleep, not enough
sunshine, and too much pressure from my job, earwax build-up, poor blood
or
anything else I could think of.

But now I found out the real reason: I&apos;m tired because I&apos;m overworked.

Here&apos;s why:

The population of this country is 273 million.

140 million are retired.

That leaves 133 million to do the work.

There are 85 million in school, which leaves 48 million to do the work.

Of this, there are 29 million employed by the federal government,
leaving 19
million to do the work.

2.8 million are in the armed forces, preoccupied with killing the
Taliban.

Which leaves 16.2 million to do the work.

Take from the total the 14,800,000 people who work for state and city
governments. And that leaves 1.4 million to do the work.

At any given time there are 188,000 people in hospitals, leaving
1,212,000
to do the work.

Now, there are 1,211,998 people in prisons.

That leaves just two people to do the work.

You and me.

And there you sit at your computer reading jokes.

Nice, real nice... Tenorman January 30th, 2004, 03:44 PM A man rolls home blind drunk and meets his wife at the door, as he is unsuccessfully trying to put his key in the lock.

He proceeds to slur his way through a description of a great new pub he has been to. It is called the Golden Saloon and everything inside is golden, he says. At the front there are two gold doors, all the bar fittings are gold and even the urinals are gold.

The wife is a bit suspicious of all this, and the following day finds a box of matches in her husbands pocket adverising the bar, so she phones the number

&quot;Is that the Golden Saloon&quot;she asks

Yes Ma&apos;am

Do you have gold doors at the front

Yes Ma&apos;am

Are all the bar fittings gold

Yes Ma&apos;am

And gold urinals?

A Londoner parks his brand new Porsche in front of the office to show it off to his colleagues.
As he&apos;s getting out of the car, a truck comes speeding along too close to the kerb and takes off the door before speeding off. More than a little distraught, the Londoner grabs his mobile
and calls the police.

&gt;Five minutes later, the police arrive. Before the policeman has a chance to ask any questions, the Londoner starts screaming hysterically:
&gt;
&gt;&quot;My Porsche, my beautiful silver Porsche is ruined. No matter how long at the panel beaters it&apos;ll simply never be the same again!&quot;
&gt;
&gt;After the Londoner finally finishes his rant, the policeman shakes his head in disgust:
&gt;&quot;I can&apos;t believe how materialistic you bloody Londoners are,&quot;he says.
&gt;&quot;You lot are so focused on your possessions that you don&apos;t notice anything else in your life.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;&quot;How can you say such a thing at a time like this?&quot;, snaps the Londoner.

her parents. Since this is such a big event, the girl announces to her
boyfriend that after dinner, she would like to go out and make love for the first
time.

Well, the boy is ecstatic, but he has never had sex before, so he takes a
trip to the pharmacist to get some condoms. The pharmacist helps the boy for
about an hour. He tells the boy everything there is to know about condoms and
sex.

At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many condoms he&apos;d like to
buy, a 3-pack, 10-pack, or family pack. The boy insists on the family pack
because he thinks he will be rather busy, it being his first time and all.
That night, the boy shows up at the girl&apos;s parents house and meets his
girlfriend at the door.&quot;Oh, I&apos;m so excited for you to meet my parents, come on in!&quot;

The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table where the girl&apos;s
parents are seated. The boy quickly offers to say grace and bows his head.

A minute passes, and the boy is still deep in prayer, with his&gt;&gt;head down.


10 minutes pass, and still no movement from the boy.

Finally, after 20 minutes with his head down, the girlfriend leans over and
whispers to the boyfriend,&quot;I had no idea you were this religious.&quot;The boy
turns, and whispers back,&quot;I had no idea your father was a pharmacist.&quot; Saundra Hummer February 17th, 2004, 11:08 AM There is more money being spent on breast implants and Viagra, than on Alzheimer&apos;s research!

&gt;cursing, crying, the mother says,&quot;Who was the pig that did this to you? I
&gt;want to know!&quot;

&gt;The girl picks up the phone and makes a call. Half an hour later a Ferrari
&gt;stops in front of their house; a mature and distinguished man with gray
&gt;hair, impeccably dressed in a very expensive suit, steps out of the car
and
&gt;enters the house.
&gt;
&gt;He sits in the living room with the father, the mother and the girl, and
&gt;tells them,&quot;Good morning, your daughter has informed me of the problem. I
&gt;can&apos;t marry her because of my personal family situation, but I&apos;ll take
&gt;charge.
&gt;
&gt;If a girl is born, I will bequeath her two retail stores, a townhouse, a

they
&gt;got caught in a terrible blizzard. They pulled into a nearby farm
and
&gt;asked the attractive lady who answered the door if they could spend
the
&gt;night.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;I realize it&apos;s terrible weather out there and I have
this
&gt;huge house all to myself, but I&apos;m recently widowed,&quot;she explained.
&quot;I&apos;m
&gt;afraid the neighbors will talk if I let you stay in my house.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Don&apos;t worry,&quot;Jack said.&quot;We&apos;ll be happy to sleep in
the
&gt;barn. And if the weather breaks, we&apos;ll be gone at first light.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The lady agreed, and the two men found their way to the
barn
&gt;and settled in for the night. Come morning, the weather had cleared,
and
&gt;they got on their way. They enjoyed a great weekend of skiing.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;About nine months later, Jack got an unexpected letter
from an

finally
&gt;determined that it was from the attorney of that attractive widow he
had
&gt;met on the ski weekend. He dropped in on his friend Bob and asked,
&quot;Bob,
&gt;do
&gt;you remember that good-looking widow from the farm we stayed at on
our ski
&gt;holiday up North?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yes, I do.&quot;said Bob

house
&gt;and pay her a visit ?&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yes,&quot;Bob said, a little embarrassed about being found out.&quot;I have
to
&gt;admit that I did.&quot;

I quickly reassured her that the ants are not harmful and there would be no need to bring her daughter into the hospital. She calmed down and at the end of the conversation happened to mention that she gave her daughter some ant poison to eat in order to kill the ants. I told her that she better bring her daughter into the emergency room right away.

Early this year, some Boeing employees on the airfield decided to steal a life raft from one of the 747s. They were successful in getting it out of the plane and home. Shortly after they took it for a float on the river, they noticed a Coast Guard helicopter coming towards them. It turned out that the chopper was homing in on the emergency locator beacon that activated when the raft was inflated. They are no longer employed at Boeing.

So he left the Bank of America and crossed the street to Wells Fargo. After waiting a few minutes in line, he handed his note to the Wells Fargo teller. She read it and, surmising from his spelling errors that he wasn&apos;t the brightest light in the harbor, told him that she could not accept his stickup note because it was written on a Bank of America deposit slip and that he would either have to fill out a Wells Fargo deposit slip or go back to Bank of America. Looking somewhat defeated, the man said,&quot;OK&quot;and left. He was arrested a few minutes later, as he was waiting in line back at Bank of! America.

Don&apos;t bother with this guy&apos;s sign. He probably couldn&apos;t read it anyway.

Number Five Idiot of 2003

A guy walked into a little corner store with a shotgun and demanded all of the cash from the cash drawer. After the cashier put the cash in a bag, the robber saw a bottle of Scotch that he wanted behind the counter on the shelf. He told the cashier to put it in the bag as well, but the cashier refused and said, because I don&apos;t believe you are over 21.&quot;The robber said he was, but the clerk still refused to give it to him because he didn&apos;t believe him. At this point, the
robber took his driver&apos;s license out of his wallet and gave it to the clerk. The clerk looked it over and agreed that the man was in fact over 21 and he put the Scotch in the bag. The robber then ran from the store with his loot. The cashier promptly called the police and gave the name and address of the robber that he got off the license. They arrested the robber two hours later.

This guy definitely needs a sign!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Idiot Number Six of 2003

A pair of Michigan robbers entered a record shop nervously waving revolvers. The first one shouted,&quot;Nobody move!&quot;When his partner moved, the startled first bandit shot him. This guy doesn&apos;t need a sign, he probably figured it out himself.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Idiot Number Seven of 2003

Seems this guy wanted some beer pretty badly. He decided that he&apos;d just throw a cinder block through a liquor store window, grab some booze, and run. So he lifted the cinder block and heaved it over his head at the window. The cinder block bounced back and hit the would be thief on the head, knocking him unconscious. It seems the liquor store window was made of plexiglass. The whole event was caught on videotape.
Oh, that smarts.


Give him his sign.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Idiot Number Eight of 2003

Ann Arbor: The Ann Arbor News crime column reported that a man walked into a Burger King in Ypsilanti, Michigan at 12:50 A. M., flashed a gun and demanded cash. The clerk turned him down because he said he couldn&apos;t open the cash register without a food order. When the man ordered onion rings, the clerk said they weren&apos;t available for breakfast. The man, frustrated, walked away.

Scary, isn&apos;t it Phil Kelly April 5th, 2004, 01:16 PM From The Book Of Jobbers

..And so in the dark of night the Lord awoke Noah, and spoke to him.&quot;Noah,
awake and heed my words!&quot;

And Noah, being sore, afraid and disoriented, did cry out,&quot;Who goeth
there?&quot;And the Lord did smite him upside the head, saying,&quot;It is the Lord
of all things, dummy!&quot;And Noah did tremble, saying, Lord, why hath thou
wakened me?&quot;

And the Lord did say,&quot;Noah, build me a Casual Band.&quot;For the earth will be
visited by a plague of Brides, followed by forty days of Trade Shows and
forty nights of Awards Banquets.&quot;

And Noah did say,&quot;Command me, Lord.&quot;

And the Lord did say,&quot;First, thou must find me a Leader.&quot;

And Noah replied,&quot;But Lord, will I not be thy Leader?&quot;

And the Lord did smite him again, saying,&quot;Fool, thou will be my Contractor.

Ask not why!&quot;

And Noah did bow his head, saying,&quot;Yes, my Lord. And what will this leader
play?&quot;

And the Lord said,&quot;It mattereth little, whether he play or not, or whether
he be proficient or not. For his job shall primarily be to talk to the
Brides and their Mothers, and to deal with Clients, and to count off Tempos
wrong, and to inquire as to whether Overtime will happen, and to try to
segue tunes that should not be segued. If he playeth any instrument, thou
must always have another player of that instrument in the band, just to be
safe.&quot;

And Noah did say,&quot;And what else shall this Leader do?&quot;

And the Lord replied,&quot;It shall be his job to spread Bad Information and
Confusion amongst the Sidemen, and to pit them one against the other, and to
delay all payments.&quot;Further shall it be his job, until we can afford a
Soundman, to create Feedback, and to invent new Equalization Curves
therefore.&quot;

And Noah did shake his head in wonder, saying,&quot;Lord, thy ways are Strange
and mysterious. What more shall I do?&quot;

And the Lord said,&quot;Next, find me a Rhythm Section. First, find me a
Drummer. And Three Things above all must this Drummer possess.&quot;

And Noah did ask,&quot;What are these Three Things? Double Bass Drums? An
Electronic Kit? Congas?&quot;

And the Lord did smite Noah again, saying&quot;Second-guess me not, my servant.
First, this Drummer must have slightly imperfect time, so that whenever he
playeth a Fill (and he shall play many), he always emergeth at a different
place, sometimes early and sometimes late, but thou may not guess which. And
second, he must be Supremely Discontent, always hoping for the Big Break
which will lead to him playing with Chick Corea or Madonna, so that he
despiseth Jobbing. And third, he must always be convinced of his
Righteousness, in all things, including Time, Volume, Tempo and Feel, so
that he argueth always with the Bass Player.&quot;

And Noah did say,&quot;As you command, Lord. And what next?&quot;And the Lord did
say,&quot;Thou art learning, Noah. Next shall be the Bass Player. And he shall
be Bored. That is all.&quot;

And Noah did say,&quot;Of course. And next, my Lord?&quot;&quot;Next shall be the Piano
Player. And he shall play as if he has twenty fingers, and he shall ply
Substitute upon Substitute, until no man may name the Chord, and he will not
be helpful. Furthermore, he shall always be late. And he shall always be
trying out New Gear, of which he has no knowledge.&quot;

And Noah did wonder aloud,&quot;Lord, Great is thy Wisdom!&quot;&quot;Next shall be the
Guitar Player. And he shall be a Rock Guitar Player. And he shall be Loud,
and he shall sing &apos;Old Time Rock n&apos; Roll&apos;. Also shall he know not The Page,
and so shall rely upon his Ears, which have been damaged by exposure to High
Sound Pressure Levels. For the Guitarists who Read shall already be playing
Shows, and will be making the Big Shekels. And his tux shall be the
Rattiest.&quot;And Noah did say,&quot;It shall be done.&quot;

And the Lord did say,&quot;Next thou shall need Horns. First shall be the
Saxophones. And they shall be Beboppers. And they shall play their Bird
quotes in every song, yea, even the Celine Dion ballad. And they shall Get
High on every break, and make the Long Faces all night long, but especially
when &apos;In The Mood&apos; is called.

Next shall be the Trumpeters. And they shall every one attempt to take
everything Up an Octave, and fail frequently. And of Changes they shall know
nothing.

And finally shall be the Trombone Player. And many jokes will be made about
him, for he will have a Beeper, as well as a Day Job, and he will be the
first to be Cut from the Band. And Noah, taking many notes, did say,&quot;Mighty
is the Lord!&quot;

&quot;Next shall be the String Players. Find me Three Women, and attach Pickups
to their Violins that are more ancient even than Myself, so that their
instruments screecheth and causeth great pain. And their job shall be to
dress in Evening Gowns, and to Fake Parts on all Ballads, and to
occasionally Stroll, and to complain about the Volume, and the Intonation,
and to impede the Swing.&quot;

And Noah did say,&quot;What else can be left, Lord?&quot;And the Lord did say,
&quot;Finally, find me the Singers. And they shall be Three: one a Male, and two
Females. And the Male shall be a Strutting Peacock, with the Rock &apos;N Roll
Hair, and he shall never have to wear The Tuxedo, and also shall he play The
Harmonica. And of the Females, one shall be Black and one shall be White.
And the Black one shall ALWAYS sing the Aretha songs, and the Disco. And the
White one shall ALWAYS sing the Power Ballads, and the Country Songs. But
both shall share the Motown Medley, and shall sing Backup for the Male, and
forget the Words, and be Late, and know nothing of Keys or Form. And they
shall leave every gig immediately, having never touched a piece of
Equipment. And they shall be paid many more shekels than the Sidemen. Ask
not why.&quot;And Noah did say,&quot;As Thou sayest, my Lord.&quot;

And the Lord did command him,&quot;Search high and low for these, as not every
musician can fulfill these requirements. And though we have No Work yet, a
Commitment must be secured from All. And while you&apos;re at it, start looking
for Subs.&quot;

And Noah did say,&quot;Lord, thy will be done.&quot;And it was.



:angel marvin g April 12th, 2004, 02:35 PM A husband and wife are waiting at the bus stop, and with them
&gt;&gt;are their
&gt;&gt;nine children. A blind man joins them after a few minutes.
&gt;&gt;When the bus arrives, they find it overloaded and only the wife
&gt;&gt;and the nine kids are able to fit in the bus.
&gt;&gt;So the husband and the blind man decide to walk.
&gt;&gt;After a while the husband gets irritated by the ticking of the
&gt;&gt;stick of
&gt;&gt;the blind man as he taps it on the side walk and says to him:
&gt;&gt;&quot;Why don&apos; t
&gt;&gt;you put a piece of rubber at the end your stick, that ticking
&gt;&gt;sound is driving me crazy!
&gt;&gt;The blind man replies:&quot;If you would&apos;ve put a rubber on the end of YOUR stick, we&apos;d be riding the bus, so shut the hell up!&quot; bubber April 13th, 2004, 03:59 AM Following that one, I&apos;ll post another one with the same product mentioned in the punch line:

It was a balmy night and I was feeling thelonious. I had&apos;nt had any tatum in so long I could have bixed a choirgirl. But I would&apos;nt have to - the moment I entered the Luboff Lounge,the babe with the giant eubies fixed me with a&quot;come duke&quot;me look. She uncrossed her legs and I could see almost all the way to birdland. I felt a tingle in my tito puente. This is it!

No sooner had we closed my front door than this hot django had grabbed me by the hines and pulled me close. I insiniuated my hand under her sweater until I found one of her brubecks, then I slowly traced a circle around her konitz.

Oh baby, she cooed, you make my red norvo wet. She unzipped my getz, ans reached in to cradle my hodges in her hand. I&apos;d love a little mingus, darling, she said, my gillespie is aching.

By this time my King Oliver was ready to take a solo. I could hardly wait to coda, but I obliged her. She hoisted her skirt, and I saw that she was&apos;nt wearing any basies. I dove right into her satchmo and attacked her tristano.

Oh, she moaned, I want your krupa! Zoot me, miff me, fill my cootie williams!

I was ready - almost. I felt in my pocket. Uh - oh. Sorry sweets,
I said, no blakey tonight. I&apos;m all out of condons.

(Maybe something for the next quiz: How many musician names
in this story?) marvin g April 13th, 2004, 07:58 AM A man left work one Friday afternoon. But instead of going home, he
stayed
out the entire weekend playing golf with the boys and spending his
entire
paycheck.

When he finally appeared at home, Sunday night, he was confronted by his
very angry wife and was barraged for nearly two hours with a tirade for
his
actions.

Finally his wife stopped the nagging and simply said to him,&quot;How would
you
like it if you didn&apos;t see me for two or three days?&quot;

To which the husband replied:&quot;That would be fine with me.&quot;

Monday went by and he didn&apos;t see his wife.

Tuesday went by and he didn&apos;t see his wife.

Wednesday came and went with the same results.

Finally on Thursday the swelling went down just enough where he could
see
her a little out of the corner of his left eye...... Saundra Hummer April 13th, 2004, 09:49 AM That is cute!! Katzman April 25th, 2004, 06:40 AM A commidian named Penis Van Lesbian went to an entertainment agent, the agent said you can&apos;t be called that, so he changed his name to Dick Van Dyke. Tenorman April 27th, 2004, 11:09 AM Around about the London there are what are called the Home Counties.

To the East there is Essex
To the South there is Sussex
Almost in the middle there is Middlesex
In the West there used to be Wessex (an old kingdom)

Unfortunately the population in the county to the North, sort of died out for some reason. Mike P April 27th, 2004, 01:07 PM Not a joke, but a funny quote:

Did you hear about the dyslexic pimp?

He invested all his money in a warehouse.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Saundra Hummer April 29th, 2004, 01:00 PM Subject: FW: Who Is In Charge?
Not so sure this is a joke! Seems so true to me, Sandi

&quot;I should be in charge,&quot;said the blood.&quot;becuase I circulate oxygen all over, so without me, you&apos;d all waste away.&quot;

&quot;I should be in charge,&quot;said the stomach,&quot;because I process food and give all of you energy.&quot;

&quot;I should be in charge,&quot;said the legs,&quot;because I carry the body wherever it needs to go.&quot;

&quot;I should be in charge,&quot;said the eyes,&quot;because I allow the body to see where it goes.&quot;

I should be in charge,&quot;said the rectum,&quot;because I &apos;m responsible for waste removal.&quot;

All the other body parts laughed at the rectum and insulted him to no end, so in a huff, he shut down tight.

Withing a few days, the brain had a terrible headache, the stomach was bloated, the legs got wobbly, the eyes got watery, and the blood was toxic.

They all decided that the rectum should be the boss.

A little rabit is sitting in the forest and crying. In fact the rabbit is crying so loud that a Deer comes and askes:&quot;What&apos;s wrong little bunny?&quot;The Rabbit answers:&quot;Well, the bear came along and because I was so soft he used me as toilette paper!&quot;&quot;That&apos;s awful&quot;replies the deer.
The next day the deer goes to the Rabbit again. This time the Rabbit is laughing really loud.&quot;Little Bunny, why are you laughing so hard?&quot;&quot;Well, I saw the bear again today... and this time he mistaked me for the hedgehog!&quot;

TMWSIY May 22nd, 2004, 10:57 AM A woman is working night-shift at a city sperm bank, when a masked man walks in with a gun.&quot;Take that vial and drink it!!&quot;he says.

&quot;I knows what it is, now DO IT!!&quot;yells the masked man. The woman drinks the contents of the vial. THe man takes off his mask, and appears to be her own husband!!! He says to her,&quot;See honey, it wasn&apos;t that bad now, was it!?&quot; Phil Kelly May 24th, 2004, 02:15 PM [B]Bush in hell...

While walking down the street one day, George&quot;Dubya&quot;Bush is shot by a disgruntled NRA member. His soul arrives in heaven and he is met by St. Peter at the Pearly Gates.&quot;Welcome to Heaven,&quot;says St. Peter.&quot;I&apos;d like to
just let you in, but I have orders from the Man Himself: He says you have to spend one day in Hell and one day in Heaven. Then you must choose where you&apos;ll live foreternity.&quot;

&quot;But, I&apos;ve already made up my mind; I want to be in Heaven.&quot;&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but we have our rules.&quot;And with that, St. Peter escorts him to an elevator and he goes down, down to Hell.

The doors open and he finds himself in the middle of a lush golf course; the sun is shining in a cloudless sky, the temperature a perfect 72 degrees. In the distance is a beautiful clubhouse.

Standing in front of it, his dad... and thousands of others who helped him out over the years: Karl Rove, Dick Cheney, Jerry Falwell,... The whole of the&quot;Right&quot;was there....everyone laughing...happy.... casually but expensively dressed. They run to greet him, hug him, and reminisce about the good times they had getting rich at the expense of others. They play a
friendly game of golf and then dine on lobster and caviar.

The Devil himself comes up to Bush with a frosty drink,&quot;Have a Margarita and relax, Dubya!&quot;&quot;Uh, I can&apos;t drink, I took a pledge,&quot;says Junior, dejectedly.

&quot;This is Hell, son: you can drink and eat all you want and not worry, and it just gets better from there!&quot;

Dubya takes the drink and finds himself liking the Devil, who he thinks is really a very friendly guy who tells funny jokes and pulls hilarious nasty pranks, kind of like a Yale Skull and Bones brother with real horns.

They are having such a great time that, before he realizes it, it&apos;s time to go. Everyone gives him a big hug and waves as Bush steps on the elevator and heads upward. When the elevator door opens, he is in Heaven again and St. Peter is waiting for him.&quot;Now it&apos;s time to visit Heaven&quot;he says.

So for 24 hours Bush hangs out with a bunch of honest, good-natured people who enjoy each other&apos;s company, talk about things other than money, and treat each other decently. Not a nasty prank or frat boy joke among them; no
fancy country clubs and, while the food tastes great, it&apos;s not caviar or lobster. And these people are all poor, he doesn&apos;t see anybody he knows, and he isn&apos;t even treated like someone special! Worst of all, to Dubya, Jesus turns out to be some kind of Jewish hippie with his endless &apos;peace&apos; and &apos;do
unto others&apos; jive.&quot;Whoa,&quot;he says uncomfortably to himself,&quot;Pat Robertson never prepared me for this!&quot;When the is day done, St. Peter returns and says,&quot;Well, then, you&apos;ve spent a day in Hell and a day in Heaven. Now
choose where you want to live for eternity.&quot;

With the &apos;Jeopardy&apos; theme playing softly in the background, Dubya reflects for a minute, then answers:&quot;Well, I would never have thought I&apos;d say this - I mean, Heaven has been delightful and all -- but I really think I belong in Hell with my friends.&quot;

So Saint Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down, all the way to Hell. The doors of the elevator open and he is in the middle of a barren scorched earth covered with garbage and toxic industrial waste-

kind of like Houston.

He is horrified to see all of his friends, dressed in rags and chained together, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags. They are groaning and moaning in pain, faces and hands black with grime.

The Devil comes over to Dubya and puts an arm around his shoulder.&quot;I don&apos;t understand,&quot;stammers a shocked Dubya,&quot;Yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and a clubhouse and we ate lobster and caviar... drank booze.We screwed around and had a great time. Now there&apos;s just a wasteland full of garbage and everybody looks miserable!&quot;

The Devil looks at him, smiles slyly, and purrs,&quot;Yesterday we were campaigning;

today you voted for us.&quot;

Subject: FW: How to Poop At Work


Good reading when you&apos;re shooting the.......


p.s. As disgusting as it is....I know some of you will enjoy this one....

HOW TO POOP AT WORK.
We&apos;ve all been there but don&apos;t like to admit it. We&apos;ve all kicked back in
our cubicles and suddenly felt something brewing down below. As much as we
try to convince ourselves otherwise, the WORK POOP is inevitable. For
those who hate pooping at work, following is the Survival Guide for taking
a dump at work.

CROP DUSTING.
When farting, you walk briskly around the office so the smell is not in
your area and everyone else gets a whiff but doesn&apos;t know where it came
from. Be careful when you do this. Do not stop until the full fart has
been expelled. Walk an extra 30 feet to make sure the smell has left your
pants.

FLY BY.
The act of scouting out a bathroom before pooping. Walk in and check for
other poopers. If there are others in the bathroom, leave and come back
again.

Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER. People may become suspicious if
they catch you constantly going into the bathroom.

ESCAPEE.
A fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal or forcing a poop
in a stall. This is usually accompanied by a sudden wave of embarrassment.
If you release an escapee, do not acknowledge it. Pretend it did not
happen. If you are standing next to the farter in the urinal, pretend you
did not hear it. No one likes an escapee. It is uncomfortable for all
involved. Making a joke or laughing makes both parties feel uneasy.

JAILBREAK.
When forcing a poop, several farts slip out at a machine gun pace. This is
usually a side effect of diarrhea or a hangover. If this should happen, do
not panic. Remain in the stall until everyone has left the bathroom to
spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred.

COURTESY FLUSH.
The act of flushing the toilet the instant the poop hits the water. This
reduces the amount of airtime the poop has to stink up the bathroom. This
can help you avoid being caught doing the WALK OF SHAME.

WALK OF SHAME.
Walking from the stall, to the sink, to the door after you have just stunk
up the bathroom. This can be a very uncomfortable moment if someone walks
in and busts you. As with farts, it is best just to pretend that the smell
does not exist. Can be avoided with the use of the COURTESY FLUSH.

OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER.
A colleague who poops at work and is proud of it. You will often see an
OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER enter the bathroom with a newspaper or magazine
under his or her arm. Always look around the office for the Out Of The
Closet Pooper before entering the bathroom.

THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (P.F.N.)
A group of co-workers who band together to ensure emergency pooping goes
off without incident. This group can help you to monitor the whereabouts
of Out Of The Closet Poopers, and identify SAFE HAVENS.

SAFE HAVENS.
A seldom-used bathroom somewhere in the building where you can least
expect visitors. Try floors that are predominantly of the opposite sex.
This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex entering the bathroom.

TURD BURGLAR.
Someone who does not realize that you are in the stall and tries to force
the door open. This is one of the most shocking and vulnerable moments
that can occur when taking a poop at work. If this occurs, remain in the
stall until the Turd Burglar leaves. This way you will avoid all
uncomfortable eye contact.

CAMO-COUGH.
A phony cough that alerts all new entrants into the bathroom that you are
in a stall. This can be used to cover-up a WATERMELON, or to alert
potential Turd Burglars. Very effective when used in conjunction with an
ASTAIRE.

ASTAIRE.
A subtle toe-tap that is used to alert potential Turd Burglars that you
are occupying a stall. This will remove all doubt that the stall still is
occupied. If you hear an Astaire, leave the bathroom immediately so the
pooper can poop in peace.

WATERMELON.
A poop that creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet water. This is
also an embarrassing incident. If you feel a Watermelon coming on, create
a diversion. See CAMO-COUGH.

HAVANA OMELET.
A case of diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes in the toilet
water. Often accompanied by an Escapee. Try using a Camo-Cough with an
Astaire.

UNCLE TED.
A bathroom user who seems to linger around forever. Could spend extended
lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the pot. An Uncle Ted
makes it difficult to relax while on the crapper, and you should always
wait to poop when the bathroom is empty. This benefits you as well as the
other bathroom attendees.




:tanz: :thewave: :tanz: jscratch July 6th, 2004, 07:01 PM What&apos;s the difference between a large pizza and a jazz trumpet player?
A large pizza can feed a family of four. Watusa August 28th, 2004, 04:56 PM A bus stops and two Italian men get on. They sit down and engage in an animated conversation. The lady sitting behind them ignores them at first, but her attention is galvanized when she hears one of the men say the following:

&quot;Emma come first. Den I come. Den two asses come together. I come once-a-more. Two asses, they come together again. I come again and pee twice. Then I come one last a time.&quot;

&quot;You foul-mouthed sex obsessed pervert,&quot;retorted the lady indignantly.

&quot;In this country....we don&apos;t speak aloud in public places about our sex lives.........&quot;

&quot;Hey, coola down lady,&quot;said the man.&quot;Who talkin&apos; abouta sexa? I&apos;m a justa tellin&apos; my frienda how to spella &apos;Mississippi&apos;.&quot; Watusa August 28th, 2004, 04:59 PM An Italian scientist decides to do some good old fashioned animal testing. He buys a frog and a journal and takes them back to his laboratory.

Placing the frog on the lab table, he says to it,&quot;Jumpa, froga, jumpa!&quot;The frog jumps eight feet. In the journal, the scientist writes&quot;A froga witha four legs, jumpa eight feet.&quot;

After cutting off one of the frog&apos;s legs, he says to the frog,&quot;Jumpa, froga, jumpa!&quot;The frog jumps six feet. The scientist notes this, writing&quot;A froga witha three legs jumpa six feet.&quot;

He cuts off another leg and exclaims,&quot;Jumpa, froga, jumpa!&quot;and the frog jups four feet. The scientist writes,&quot;A froga witha two legs jumpa four feet.&quot;

Off comes another leg, and again the scientists cries,&quot;Jumpa, froga, jumpa!&quot;The frog jumps two feet. Quite impressed now, the scientist writes in his journal,&quot;A froga witha one leg jumpa two feet.&quot;

He cuts off the frog&apos;s last leg and tells it,&quot;Jumpa, froga, jumpa!&quot;The frog doesn&apos;t move. Again, the scientist says&quot;Jumpa, froga, jumpa!&quot;But the frog just lays there. The scientist shouts,&quot;JUMPA, FROGA, JUMPA!!&quot;Nothing from the frog.

The scientist writes in his journal:&quot;A froga witha no leg, a no-a can hear.&quot; jazzcritic August 29th, 2004, 07:38 PM A lady walks into a Lexus dealership and browses around.
Suddenly she spots the most perfect, beautiful car and walks over to
inspect it. As she bends forward to feel the fine leather upholstery,
an unexpected little burst of flatulence escapes her. Very
embarrassed, she anxiously looks around to see if anyone has noticed
and hopes a sales person doesn&apos;t pop up right now.

As she turns back, there standing next to her is a salesman. With a
pleasant smile he greets her,&quot;Good day, Madam. How may we help
you today?&quot;

Trying to maintain an air of sophistication and acting as though
nothing had happened, she smiles back and asks,&quot;Sir, what is the
price of this lovely vehicle?&quot;

Still smiling pleasantly, he replies,&quot;Madam, I&apos;m very sorry to
say that if you farted just touching it, you are gonna shit when you
hear the price.&quot; BeRiGaN September 1st, 2004, 04:29 AM A flashy 26 year old showgirl married a 87 year-old retired
well-to-do Navy pilot, largely because she held the belief that
the old codger wouldn&apos;t even survive the wedding night.

While her new husband was in the bathroom, the woman
slipped into a black see-through nightie and struck
her most seductive pose upon the bed. When the old man finally
emerged, she was startled to see that he was stark naked except for
earplugs, a clothes pin on his nose and a condom.

&quot;Why are you wearing those?&quot;she asked in amazement.

&quot;Because if there&apos;s anything I just can&apos;t stand,&quot;he grumbled,&quot;it&apos;s
the sound of a woman screaming and the smell of burning rubber.&quot; Saundra Hummer September 1st, 2004, 10:53 PM Giving 100%

From a strictly mathematical viewpoint it goes like this:

What makes 100%? What does it mean to give MORE than 100%???

Ever wonder about those people who way they are giving more than 100% We have all been to those meetings where someone wants you to give over 100% How about achieving 103%? What makes up !00% in life?

Heres a little mathematical formula that might hekp answer these questions:

IF
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z Is represented as:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26

Then:

H-A-R-D-W-O-R-K
8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11=98%

And

K-N_O-W-L-E-D-G-E
11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+5=96%

But,

A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E
1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5+=100%

And,

B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T
2+21+12+12+19+8+9+20=103%

AND........look how far ass kissing will take you.

A-S-S-K-I-S-S-I-N-G
1+19+19+11+9+19+19+9+14+7=118%

So, one can conclude with mathematical certainty that While Hard Work and Knowledge witll get you close, and attitiude will get you there, it&apos;s the Bullshit and the Ass Kissing that will put you over the top !!! Tenorman September 2nd, 2004, 02:52 PM Everyone know what a&quot;Smart Car&quot;is - one of those tiny Mercedes / Swatch collaborations with a wheel at each corner.

OK

How do you improve a Smart Car?

Attach lollipop sticks to the wheel spokes to make it sound as though it has a bigger engine. Tenorman September 22nd, 2004, 05:05 PM Ladies:

Ever wondered what it is that turns a man on when he sees a lady dressed in leather.

He approaches. Close

So close he can no longer see that leather.

But there is the smell and the feel

So?

Well you know that luxury sports car he has always wanted? The one with the leather seats? Tenorman October 15th, 2004, 05:07 PM I had the morning off work today, and was heading in to the office just before lunch time.

I get on a District line underground train at Tower Hill station (the clue is in the name). A tourist couple get on just behind me. Two stops on, they ask me if I knew where the Tower of London is. Slightly confused, I say that it is just across the road from the station where they joined the train.

They said that they had not seen it when they got off there. The man then asked me&quot;Just how high is this tower?&quot;

Doesn&apos;t anyone buy guide books any more? Fran October 15th, 2004, 06:53 PM I had the morning off work today, and was heading in to the office just before lunch time.

As An American, who lived for 7 years in Europe, I have to presume the tourists were American. I was constantly embarassed by my fellow countrymen&apos;s inability to grasp the world outside of Peoria Illinois, Toledo O, or Macon GA.
I recall, often a woman in Paris, at breakfast, having trouble with her heavy Texas accent, communicating with a waiter who had just gotten through with orders from a German couple and an North African speaking what I presume was Arabic. When he couldn&apos;t get her complex questions and instructions straight. She nearly screamed,&quot;whas wrong with these people that they don Unerstan plane Inglish&quot;Not normaly confrontational I blew it, and Went up to her and her husband and said&quot;what&apos;s wrong with you that you don&apos;t speak French&quot;? She blubbered, but to his credit her husband Clapped his hands and said something like&quot;Yeah right on&quot; Saundra Hummer October 15th, 2004, 07:13 PM How is it that these people, and we&apos;ve all heard of them, have enough&quot;smarts&quot;to earn a decent living, being able to afford to travel, yet have never had the smarts to develop good manners?

Believe me Saundra we have far more our share of these ignoramuses than the rest of the world. Even those who can be over bearing from other nations rarely prove their ignorance like many real down home Americans.
We have some sort of superiority complex that affords us the&quot;right&quot;to be blindly insensative to the world around us. It was bad 40 years ago, and now, with our present administration trying to pump us full of justification to hate all the other nations that don&apos;t agree with our foolhardy foreign policies, it has gotten much worse.
Ignorant Administration = Ignorant Populace.

At the end of each tour, a questionnaire is given out with the usual questions about the tour along with a space for comments. These comments are often absolute gems.

Here are two of them. Everyone jumped to conclusions about the nationality of the tourists in previous posts. All I will say about these are: they weren&apos;t American

You got to find somebody who likes the same stuff. Like if you like sports, she should like it that you like sports, and she should keep the chips and dip coming.

No person really decides before they grow up who they&apos;re going to marry, God decides it all way before, and you get to find out later who you&apos;re stuck with.

When asked what most people do on a date?

Dates are for having fun, and people should use them to get to know each other. Even boys have something to say if you listen long enough.
..............Lynette, age 8, (isn&apos;t she a treasure?)

On the first date, they just tell each other lies and that usually gets them interested enough tt go for a second date.
..............Martin, age 10 (young Einstein)




what would you do on a first date that was turning sour?

I&apos;d run home and play dead. The next day I would call all the newspapers, and make sure they wrote about me in all the dead columns. (We&apos;ve all heard the dying story haven&apos;t we girls?)

Is it better to be single or married?

I don&apos;t know which is better, but I&apos;ll tell you one thing, I&apos;m never going to have sex with my wife. I don&apos;t want to be all grossed out.
..............Theodore, age 8.

It&apos;s better for girls to be single, but not for boys. Boys need someone to clean up after them.

After getting all of the Pope&apos;s luggage loaded into the limo, (and he doesn&apos;t travel light), the driver notices that the Pope is still standing on the curb.


&quot;Excuse me, Your Eminence,&quot;says the driver,&quot;Would you please take your seat so we can leave?&quot;&quot;Well, to tell you the truth,&quot;says the Pope,&quot;they never let me drive at the Vatican, and I&apos;d really like to drive today.&quot;

&quot;I&apos;m sorry but I just cannot let you do that, there is noway, I&apos;d lose my job! And what if something should happen?&quot;protests the driver, wishing he&apos;d never gone to work that morning.

&quot;There might be something extra in it for you.&quot;says the Pope. Reluctantly, the driver gets in the back with a sigh, as the Pople climbs in behind the wheel.

The driver quickly regrets his decision when, afer exiting the air port, the Supreme Pontiff floors it, accelerating the limo to 105 mph.&quot;Please slow down, Your Highness!!!&quot;pleads the worried, and scared out of his wits, driver, but the Pope keeps the pedal to the metal until they hear sirens.

&quot;Oh, dear God, I&apos;m goinna lose my license,&quot;moans the driver, just sick about it. The Pope pulls over, and rolls down the window as the cop approaches, but the cop takes one good look at him, and goes back to his motorcycle, and gets on the radio.

&quot;I need to talk to the Chief,&quot;he says to the dispacher.

The Chief gets on the radio and the cop tells him that he&apos;s stopped a limo going a hundred and five.&quot;So bust him,&quot;said the Chief.&quot;I don&apos;t think we want to do that, he&apos;s really important,&quot;said the cop.

Chief exclaimed,&quot;All the more reason!&quot;&quot;No, I mean really important&quot;, said the cop. The Chief then asked&quot;Who ya got there, the Mayor?&quot;...Cop&quot;Bigger.&quot;...Chief&quot;Governor?&quot;....Cop&quot;Bigger&quot;...&quot;Well&quot;said the chief,&quot;Who is it?&quot;Cop,...&quot;I think it&apos;s God!&quot;chief,&quot;What makes you think it&apos;s God?&quot;

Don&apos;t eat chicken sandwiches, no matter what...

A little boy and a little girl attended the same school and became friends. Every day they would sit together to eat their lunch. They discovered that they both brought chicken sandwiches every day!

This went on all through the fourth and fifth grades, until one day he noticed that her sandwich wasn&apos;t a chicken sandwich. He said,&quot;Hey, how come you&apos;re not eating chicken, don&apos;t you like it anymore?&quot;She said&quot;I love it, but I have to stop eating it.&quot;&quot;Why?&quot;he asked. She pointed to her lap and said&quot;Cause I&apos;m starting to grow little feathers down there!&quot;&quot;Let me see&quot;he said.&quot;Okay&quot;and she pulled up her skirt. He looked and said,&quot;That&apos;s right. You are! Better not eat any more chicken.&quot;

He kept eating his chicken sandwiches until one day he brought peanut butter. He said to the little girl,&quot;I have to stop eating chicken sandwiches, I&apos;m starting to get feathers down there too!&quot;She asked if she could look, so he pulled down his pants for her. She said&quot;Oh, my God, it&apos;s too late for you! You&apos;ve already got the neck and the gizzards!&quot;

A cardiologist died and was given an elaborate funeral. A huge heart
covered
in flowers stood behind the casket during the service.
Following the eulogy, the heart opened, and the casket rolled inside. The
heart then closed, sealing the doctor in the beautiful heart forever.

At that point, one of the mourners burst into laughter. When all eyes
stared at him, he said,


&quot;I&apos;m sorry, I was just thinking of my own funeral...I&apos;m a gynecologist.&quot;*

At that point, the proctologist fainted. jazzscriveyn November 10th, 2004, 05:38 AM well, on that note ...

A male student wants to be a proctologist, and he wants to be a really good proctologist, so he gets a part-time job down at the morgue after class so he can practice a little.

He uncovers the first guy and there is a cork in his butt! He thinks it&apos;s a little strange, so he pulls the cork out jumps back when music suddenly starts playing!

&quot;...On the road again, just can&apos;t wait to get on the road again...&quot;

The guy really freaks out! He runs and gets the doctor and drags the poor guy back to the table.&quot;Look!&quot;he says, and pulls the cork out again,&quot;.

&quot;... On the road again .. .&quot;

The doctor is totally unimpressed...&quot;So what?&quot;he says.

&quot;Isn&apos;t that the most amazing thing you&apos;ve ever seen?&quot;the student asked.

The owner of a golf course in Tennessee was confused about paying an invoice, so he decided to ask his secretary for some mathematical help.
He called her into his office and said,&quot;You graduated from the Univ. of Tennessee and I need some help. If I were to give you $20,000, minus 14%, how much would you take off?&quot;The secretary thought a moment, then replied,&quot;Everything but my earrings.&quot;
You gotta love those Tennessee women.



A group of TN. friends went deer hunting and paired off in twos for the day. That night, one of the hunters returned alone, staggering under the weight of an eight-point buck.&quot;Where&apos;s Henry?&quot;the others asked.&quot;Henry had a stroke of some kind. He&apos;s a couple of miles back up the trail,&quot;the successful hunter replied.&quot;You left Henry laying out there and carried the deer back?&quot;they inquired.&quot;A tough call,&quot;nodded the hunter.&quot;But I
figured no one is going to steal Henry!


Regarding the year 2000, a senior at Tennessee was overheard saying...&quot;when the end of the world comes, I hope to be in Tennessee.&quot;When asked why, he stated that everything happens here 20 years later than the rest of the civilized world.

NEWS FLASH! - Tennessee&apos;s worst air disaster occurred when a small two-seater Cessna 150 plane, piloted by two Univ. of Tennessee students, crashed into a cemetery earlier today. Search and rescue workers have recovered 300 bodies so far and expect the number to climb as digging continues into the evening. The pilot and copilot survived and are helping in the recovery efforts.

A Tennessean had a flat tire, pulled off on the side of the road, and proceeded to put a bouquet of flowers in front of the car and one behind it. Then he got back in the car to wait.

The man replied,&quot;I have a flat tire.&quot;The passerby asked,&quot;But what&apos;s with the flowers?&quot;The man responded,&quot;When you break down they tell you to put flares in the front and flares in the back!

How to Sing the Blues by Lame Mango Washington

*
*(attributed to Memphis Earlene Gray with help from Uncle Plunky,* with revisions by Little Blind Patti D. and Dr. Stevie Franklin)

**

*1. Most Blues begin,&quot;Woke up this morning.&quot;..followed by some awful depressing statement ..i.e. :

&quot;woke up this mornin&apos; ..wit&apos; a wine bottle up my ass&quot;

( note:&quot;woke up this mornin&apos; ..and my stock portfolio was down ..is *NOT* a good start )

*

*2.&quot;I got a good woman,&quot;is also a bad way to begin the Blues, &apos;less you stick something nasty in the next line:&quot;I got a good woman - with the meanest face in town.&quot;

*

*3. The Blues is simple. After you get the first line right, repeat it.

Then find something that rhymes ... sort of:&quot;Got a good woman - with the meanest face in town. Got teeth like Margaret Thatcher - and she weigh 500 pound.&quot;

*

*4. The Blues are not about choice. You stuck in a ditch: You stuck in a* ditch ain&apos;t no way out.

*

*5. Blues cars: Chevys and Cadillacs and broken down trucks. Blues don&apos;t travel in Volvos, BMWs, or SUV&apos;s. Most Blues transportation is a Greyhound bus or a southbound train. Jet aircraft and state-sponsored motor pools ain&apos;t even in the running. Walkin&apos; plays a major part in the blues* lifestyle. So does fixin&apos; to die.

*

*6. Teenagers can&apos;t sing the Blues. They ain&apos;t fixin to die yet. Adults sing the Blues. In Blues,&quot;adulthood&quot;means being old enough to get the electric chair if you shoot a man in Memphis.

*

*7. Blues can take place in New York City, but not in San Diego, Hawaii or any place in Canada. Hard times in St. Paul or Tucson is just depression.

Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City still the best places to have the Blues. You cannot have the blues in any place that don&apos;t get rain. ( note: Seattle don&apos;t work here cuz&apos; it&apos;s too trendy ..)

*

*8. A man with male pattern baldness ain&apos;t the blues. A woman with male pattern baldness is. Breaking your leg cuz you skiing is not the blues.

Breaking your leg cuz an alligator be chomping on it is.

*

*9. You can&apos;t have no Blues in an office or a shopping mall. The lighting is wrong. Go outside to the parking lot or sit by the dumpster.

*

*10. Good places for the Blues:

*a. highway

*b. jailhouse

*c. empty bed

*d. bottom of a whiskey glass

e. empty boxcar

*

*Bad places:

*a. Ashrams

*b. gallery openings

*c. Ivy League institutions

*d. golf courses

e. brokerage offices

*

*11. No one will believe it&apos;s the Blues if you wear a suit, &apos;less you happen to be an old black man, and you slept in it.

*

*12. Do you have the right to sing the Blues?

*Yes, if:

*a. you&apos;re older than dirt

*b. you&apos;re blind

*c. you shot a man in Memphis

*d. you can&apos;t be satisfied

*

*No, if:

*a. you have all your teeth

*b. you were once blind but now can see

*c. the man in Memphis lived.

*d. you have a retirement plan or trust fund

*

*13. Blues is not a matter of color. It&apos;s a matter of bad luck. Tiger Woods cannot sing the blues. Gary Coleman could. Ugly white people also got a leg up on the blues.

*

*14. If you ask for water and Baby give you gasoline, it&apos;s the Blues.

*

*Other acceptable Blues beverages are:

*a. wine

*b. whiskey or bourbon

*c. muddy water

*d. black coffee

*

*The following are NOT Blues beverages:

*a. mixed drinks

*b. chardonnay

*c. Snapple

*d. sparkling water

*

*15. If it occurs in a cheap motel or a shotgun shack, it&apos;s a Blues death.* Stabbed in the back by a jealous lover is another Blues way to die. So is the electric chair, substance abuse, and dying lonely in a broken down cot. You can&apos;t have a Blues death if you die during a tennis match or getting liposuction.

*

*16. Some Blues names for women:

*a. Sadie

*b. Big Mama

*c. Bessie

*d. Fat River Dumpling

*

*17. Some Blues names for men:

*a. Joe

*b. Willie

*c. Little Willie

*d. Big Willie

*

*18. Persons with names like Ashley,
Sierra, Sequoia, and Rainbow can&apos;t sing the Blues no matter how many men they shoot in Memphis.

*

*19. Make yer own Blues name (starter kit):

*a. name of physical infirmity (Blind, Cripple, Lame, etc.)* b. first name (see above) plus name of fruit (Lemon, Lime, Kiwi,etc.)* c. last name of President (Jefferson, Johnson, Fillmore, etc.)* For example, Blind Lime Jefferson, or Cripple Kiwi Fillmore, etc.

( note: some care must be used in employing the above formula ..
i.e. Arthritic Papaya Nixon ain&apos;t gonna work ..nohow ..)

*

*20. I don&apos;t care how tragic your life; you own a computer, you cannot sing the blues. You best destroy it. Fire, a spilled bottle of Mad Dog, or shotgun. Maybe your big woman just done sit on it. I don&apos;t care.* Now go on.. wit yo&apos; bad ass self!

Three old men are discussing their sex lives.

The Italian man says,&quot;Last week, my wife and I had great
sex. I rubbed her body all over with olive oil, we made
passionate love, and she screamed for 5 minutes at the end.&quot;

The Frenchman boasts,&quot;Last week when my wife and I had
sex, I rubbed her body all over with butter. We then made
passionate love and she screamed for 15 minutes.&quot;

The old Jewish man says,&quot;Well, last week my wife and
I had sex too. I rubbed her body all over with chicken
schmaltz (kosher chicken fat), we made love, and she
screamed for 6 hours.&quot;

The Italian and Frenchman were stunned. They replied,
&quot;What could you have possibly done to make your wife
scream for 6 hours?&quot;

&quot;I wiped my hands on the drapes.&quot;

A father walks into a market followed by his twelve-year-old son. The kid is spinning a coin in the air and catching it between his teeth. As they walk through the market someone bumps into the boy at just the wrong moment and the coin goes straight into his mouth and lodges in his throat. He immediately starts choking, going blue in the face, and dad starts panicking, shouting for help.

A well dressed, middle-aged, moderately attractive but serious woman in a blue business suit is sitting at a coffee bar in the market reading her newspaper and sipping a cup of coffee. At the sound of the commotion, she looks up, puts her coffee cup down on the saucer, neatly folds her newspaper and places it on the counter. Then she gets up from her seat and makes her unhurried way across the market. Reaching the boy, the woman carefully takes hold of the boy&apos;s testicles and squeezes gently at first and then ever more firmly. After a few seconds, the boy convulses violently and coughs up the coin, which the woman deftly catches in her free hand. Releasing the boy, the woman hands the coin to the father and walks back to her seat in the coffee bar without saying a word.

As soon as he is sure that his son has suffered no lasting ill-effects, the father rushes over to the woman and starts effusively thanking her, saying:&quot;I&apos;ve never seen anybody do anything like that before!- it was fantastic! Are you a doctor?&apos;&quot;

&quot;Good heavens, no,&quot;the woman replies.&quot;I am a divorce lawyer.&quot;

Wally has been a mailman with a rural route for years. Everyday, he gets in, sorts his mail, and gets out to deliver to the people hes known for years. With few exceptions, Wallys known everybody on his route most of his life, except the new young couple fixing up the old Johnson farmhouse which is the last stop on Wallys route.

A couple of days before Christmas, Wally is finishing up his route out by the Johnson place, when the young wife comes to the door and calls out to him Hey, Wally, you got time for some breakfast? So Wally goes in and this attractive woman fixes him an excellent big breakfast while his boots drip off by the door.

After breakfast, Wally is looking at the door when his hostess touches his arm. When he looks back at her, he cant help but notice her bathrobe has dropped open and shes not wearing anything under it to speak of.

Hey Wally, she says, would ya have time to come upstairs for a few minutes? So he goes up and has the absolute best time of his life.

So now Wally is back downstairs, all warm and glowing, getting his boots back on and heading out into the snow when the woman says, Wait a minute. She goes to her purse, gets out a dollar bill and hands it to Wally saying Merry Christmas.

This is just too much, and Wally asks her whats going on.

Well my husband and I were talking about what to get people for Christmas last night. When your name came up, my husband said Fuck him, give him a dollar. Breakfast was my idea. Rump Roller January 28th, 2005, 08:28 AM A man and his wife were driving home one very cold night when the wife asks her husband to stop the car. There was a baby skunk lying at the side of the road, and she got out to see if it was still alive.

It was, and she said to her husband,&quot;It&apos;s nearly frozen to death. Can we take it with us, get it warm, and let it go in the morning?&quot;

He says,&quot;O.K.,Get in the car with it.&quot;

&quot;Where shall I put it to get it warm?&quot;

He says,&quot;Put it in between your legs. It&apos;s nice and warm there.

&quot;But what about the smell?&quot;

&quot;Just hold its nose.&quot;

The man is expected to recover, but the skunk she used to beat him with died at the scene. Phil Meloy February 2nd, 2005, 03:48 AM Recently, the President, First Lady and Dick Cheney were flying on Air Force One.

He gave all the children the same kind of Lifesavers, one at a time and asked them to identify them by colors and flavors.

The children began to say:

Red....cherries

Yellow.....lemons

Green.....limes

Orange.....oranges

Purple......grapes

Finally the professor gave them all honey Lifesavers.
After eating them for a few minutes, none of the children could identify the taste.

Here&apos;s an actual job application that a 75 year old citizen submitted to Wal-Mart in Arkansas.



NAME: George Martin

SEX: Not lately, but I am looking for the right woman, (or at least one who&apos;ll cooperate).

DESIRED POSITION: Company President or Vice President. But seriously, whatever is available. If I was in a position to be picky, I wouldn&apos;t be applying here in the first place.

DESIRED SALARY: $185.000 a year plus stock options and a Michael Ovitz
style severance package. If that&apos;s not possible, make an offer and we can haggle.

EDUCATION: Yes.

LAST POSITION HELD: Target for middle management hostility.

PREVIOUS SALARY:: A lot less than I&apos;m worth.

MOST NOTABLE ACHIEVEMENT: My incredible collection of stolen pens and post-it-notes.

REASON FOR LEAVING: It sucked.

HOURS AVAILABLE TO WORK: Any.

PREFERRED HOURS: 1:30 -3:30 p.m. Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday.

DO YOU HAVE ANY SPECIAL SKILLS?: Yes, but they &apos;re better suited to a more intimate environment.

MAY WE CONTACT YOUR CURRENT EMPLOYER?: If I had one, would I be here?

DO YOU HAVE ANY PHYSICAL CONDITIONS THAT WOULD PROHIBIT YOU FROM LIFTING UP TO 50 lbs?: Of what?

DO YOU HAVE A CAR?: I think the more appropriate question here would be&quot;Do you have a car that runs?&quot;

HAVE YOU RECEIVED ANY SPECIAL AWARDS OR RECOGNITION?: I may already be a winner of the publishers clearing house sweepstakes, so they tell me.

DO YOU SMOKE?: On the job - no, on my breaks - yes.

WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE DOING IN FIVE YEARS?: Living in the Bahamas with a fabulously wealthy dumb, sexy, blonde, supermodel who thinks I&apos;m the greatest thing since sliced bread. Actually, I&apos;d like to be doing that now.

DO YOU CERTIFY THAT THE ABOVE IS TRUE AND COMPLETE TO THE BEST OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE?: Oh yes, absolutely.

SIGN HERE: Sagittarius :elephant:

They reprort one reason he&apos;s marrying is that the keepers of the public money don&apos;t mind shelling out for wives, to the tune of #500, 000 or more, but not for mistresses, which is how much they say he spends on her. Wow!

I don&apos;t expect any hassle from you! I expect a great dinner to be on the table unless I tell you that I won&apos;t be home for dinner!

I&apos;ll go hunting fishing, boozing and card-playing when I want, with my old buddies and don&apos;t you give me a hard time about it!

Those are my rules! Any comments?

Every image displayed on the BB is actually saved on someone else&apos;s computer and linked to the AAJ BB. It is like an in-built hyperlink that opens everytime you open the particular page of the BB.

Mr. Sensitive

Tom, Glenn, and Scott were working on a high rise building project. Glenn fell off and was instantly killed

As the ambulance took the body away, Scott said,&quot;Someone should go and tell his wife.&quot;

Tom says,&quot;OK, I&apos;m pretty good at that sensitive stuff, I&apos;ll do it.&quot;

Two hours later, Tom came back carrying a 6-pack. Scott asked,&quot;Where did you get that, Tom?&quot;

&quot;Glenn&apos;s wife gave it to me.&quot;

&quot;That&apos;s unbelievable, you told the lady her husband was dead and she gave you the beer?&quot;

Tom said,&quot;Well not exactly. When she answered the door, I said to her, &apos;You must be Glenn&apos;s widow.&apos;&quot;

She said,&quot;&apos;No, I&apos;m not a widow.&quot;

And I said,&quot;Wanna bet me a six-pack?&quot; jazzcritic March 25th, 2005, 12:48 PM Three ministers and their wives are killed in separate car wrecks on the same day. Each couple appears in line at the gates of heaven.

The first minister, a Methodist, is adomonished by St. Peter:&quot;You led a good life, but you had one great sin. A love of money. It was so strong, you even married a woman named Penny. So I must turn you away.&quot;

The second minister, a Presbyterian, is also scolded.&quot;You led a fine life, but your great sin was your love of strong drink. You were so obsessed, you married a woman named Sherry. Sorry, you must go.&quot;

Then the third minister, a Baptist, turned to his wife and said:&quot;Let&apos;s get out of here, Fanny.&quot;

(not all are politically correct!) Phil Kelly April 6th, 2005, 03:13 PM The Best Chain Letter Ever!

( sorry about not cleaning up all the f***s, but&apos;s MUCH f******g funnier with them left in! -pk )





Hello, my name is _______ and I suffer from the guilt of not forwarding 50 billion fucking chain letters sent to me by people who actually believe
that if you send them on, a poor 6-year-old girl in Wagga Wagga with a breast on her forehead will be able to raise enough money to have it removed
before her redneck parents sell her to a traveling freak show.

Do you honestly believe that Bill Gates is going to give you, and everyone to whom you send&quot;his&quot;email, $1000?

How stupid are we?

&quot;Ooooh, looky here! If I scroll down this page and make a wish, I&apos;ll get laid by a model I just happen to run into the next day!&quot;

What a bunch of bullshit.

Maybe the evil chain letter leprechauns will come into my house and sodomize me in my sleep for not continuing a chain letter that was started
by Peter in 5 AD and brought to this country by midget pilgrims on the Mayflower.

Fuck &apos;em.

If you&apos;re going to forward something, at least send me something mildly amusing. I&apos;ve seen all the&quot;send this to 10 of your closest friends, and
this poor, wretched excuse for a human being will somehow receive a nickel from some omniscient being&quot;forwards about 90 times.

I don&apos;t fucking care.

Show a little intelligence and think about what you&apos;re actually contributing to by sending out these forwards. Chances are, it&apos;s our own unpopularity.

The point being? If you get some chain letter that&apos;s threatening to leave you shagless or luckless for the rest of your life, delete it. If it&apos;s
funny, send it on.

Don&apos;t piss people off by making them feel guilty about a leper in Botswana with no teeth who has been tied to the ass of a dead elephant for 27 years and whose only salvation is the 5 cents per letter he&apos;ll receive if you forward this email.

Now forward this to everyone you know.

Otherwise, tomorrow morning your underwear will turn carnivorous and will consume your genitals.

Have a nice day.

P.S. Send me 15 bucks jazzbluescat April 8th, 2005, 04:58 AM Bon apetite. (http://www.thesneeze.com/mt-archives/cat_steve_dont_eat_it.php) Phil Kelly April 8th, 2005, 09:42 AM n older Jewish gentleman marries a younger lady and they are very much in love. However, no matter what the husband does sexually, the woman never achieves orgasm. Since a Jewish wife is entitled to sexual pleasure, they decide to ask the rabbi.

The rabbi listens to their story, strokes his beard, and makes the following suggestion.&quot;Hire a strapping young man. While the two of you are making love, have the young man wave a towel over you. That will help the wife fantasize and should bring on an orgasm.&quot;

They go home and follow the rabbi&apos;s advice. They hire a handsome young man and he waves a towel over them as they make love. But it doesn&apos;t help and she is still unsatisfied. Perplexed, they go back to the rabbi.

&quot;Okay&quot;, says the rabbi,&quot;let&apos;s try it reversed. Have the young man make love to your wife and you wave the towel over them.&quot;Once again, they follow the rabbi&apos;s advice. The young man gets into bed with the wife and the husband waves the towel The young man gets to work with great enthusiasm and the wife soon has an enormous, room-shaking screaming orgasm.

The husband smiles, looks at the young man and says to him triumphantly,&quot;You see, THAT&apos;S the way to wave a towel!&quot;

A young boy went up to his father and asked him,&quot;Dad, what&apos;s the difference between potentially and realistically?&quot;

The father thought for a moment, then answered.&quot;Go ask your mother if she would sleep with Robert Redford for a million dollars.* Then ask your sister if she would sleep with Brad Pitt for a million dollars.* Then ask your brother is he&apos;d sleep with Tom Cruise for a million dollars.* Come back and tell me what you learned from that.&quot;

So the boy went to his mother and asked,&quot;Would you sleep with Robert Redford for a million dollars?&quot;

The mother replied,&quot;Of course I would!* We could really use that money*to fix up the house and send you kids to a great college.

&quot;The boy then went to his sister and asked,&quot;Would you sleep with Brad Pitt for a million dollars?&quot;

The girl replied,&quot;Oh my god!* I LOVE Brad Pitt!* I would sleep with him in a heartbeat, are you nuts??!!&quot;

The boy then went to his brother and asked,&quot;Would you sleep with Tom Cruise for a million dollars?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot;the brother replied.*&quot;Do you know how much a million could buy?&quot;

The boy pondered the answers for a few days, then went back to his dad.

His father asked him,&quot;Did you find out the difference between potentially and realistically?&quot;

The boy replied,&quot;Yes, sir.* Potentially, we&apos;re sitting on three million dollars, but realistically, we&apos;re living with two sluts and a queer.&quot; jazzbluescat April 20th, 2005, 08:35 AM A couple decide to go for a meal on their anniversary and after some deliberation decide on their local Chinese restaurant.

They peruse the menu and finally agree to share the chef&apos;s special,&quot;Chicken Surprise.&quot;

The waiter brings over the meal, served in a lidded cast iron pot. Just as the wife is about to start in on the meal, the lid of the pot rises a tiny amount and she briefly sees two beady little eyes looking around before the lid slams back down.

&quot;Good grief, did you see that?&quot;she asks her husband. He hasn&apos;t, so she asks him to look in the pot.

He reaches for it and again the lid rises, and he sees two beady little eyes looking around again before it firmly slams back down.

Rather perturbed he calls the waiter over, explains what is happening and demands an explanation.

&quot;Well sir,&quot;says the waiter,&quot;what did you order?&quot;

&quot;We both chose the same,&quot;he replies,&quot;the Chicken Surprise.&quot;

&quot;Oh I do apologize, this is my fault,&quot;says the waiter...

He replies,&quot;Senor, that is a real delicacy, Bullfight Testicles.&quot;The customer thinks, what the heck, I&apos;m on vacation, so he says&quot;I would like an order of it as well.&quot;The waiter replies,&quot;Sorry, Senor, but there is only one order available per day. However, if you come in early tomorrow, I will gladly set it aside for you.&quot;The customer agrees to return.

Early the next evening, the American feasts on this local delicacy. He then calls his waiter over and asks,&quot;I really enjoyed the dish. I don&apos;t want to seem to be rude, but my order seemed to be much smaller than yesterday&apos;s serving.&quot;The waiter replies,&quot;That, Senor, is because sometimes, the bull wins.&quot; jonesy April 27th, 2005, 11:13 AM A study conducted by UCLA&apos;s Department of Psychiatry has revealed that the
kind of face a woman finds attractive on a man can differ depending on
where she is in her menstrual cycle.

For example: If she is ovulating, she is attracted to men with rugged and
masculine features. However, if she is menstruating, or menopausal, she
tends to be more attracted to a man with scissors lodged in his temple and
a bat jammed up his ass while he is on fire. Further studies are expected. Phil Kelly May 5th, 2005, 05:56 PM Jazz Math by BILL ANSCHELL

1. If x is the number of chord changes in a tune, and y is the tempo at
which it is played, then xy = factor by which a guitarist will turn
down his amp.

2. The number of notes/measure played by a saxophonist on a ballad
is proportional to the number of drinks he has consumed.

3. 4 + 4.125 + 4 + 3.875 + 4 + (4.667) + 4 + (x, where x is unknown) =
Horn player trading fours with the drummer.

4. (2 + 5 + 1) x (# of freshman college jazz students, internationally)
=annual income of Jamie Aebersold, in dollars.

5. Infinity = (3 + 6 + 2 + 5) + (3 + 6 + 2 + 5) + (3 + 6 + 2 + 5)...

6. 5/4 + 7/4 + 11/4 = The drummer&apos;s gig.

7. If the number of drinks consumed per musician = the number of drinks
comped by club, then unrest will prevail unless (cost per drink)&lt;1/20
(pay for gig).

8. 1 uptempo tune +1 rushing drummer + x (double lattes) = x (fights
among horn players to solo first)

9. 1 ballad + 1 dragging drummer + x (Percocets) = 1 cleared house,
where x is proportional to the speed at which the room empties.

10. 2 (diddles) = paradiddle.

11. Jam session + eighth-note rest = missed opportunity.

12. Jam session + (quarter-note rest or greater) = band on break.

13. {(New + York) squared - (NewNew + Yorkyork + Yorknew) + New
York + 2 (Ride + Sally) - Sally} divided by (less than five seconds) =
medley from hell.

14. (1/vocalist&apos;s experience in years) x (# of beats per measure)
x 32 = # of unintended modulations + skipped beats per chorus.

15. If x = piano&apos;s deviance from being in tune, y = volume level of
drummer, z = length of gig, and d = number of drinks consumed by
pianist on break, then (d ) (xyz /pay of the gig, in dollars), predicts
the probability of pianist urinating in his instrument.

16.&quot;Vow of Poverty&quot;theorem: If # people in audience&lt;# of musicians
on bandstand, then pay per musician&lt;one individual cover charge.

17.&quot;Bass&quot;theorem: A musician&apos;s IQ is inversely proportional to the
size of his/her instrument, and directly related to the register of the
instrument.

18.&quot;Rule of One&quot;theorem: (Universe of jazz vocalists) v (# of jazz
vocalists who sing&quot;Summertime&quot;) = 1 = rank of&quot;Summertime&quot;among tunes
most despised by instrumentalists.

19&quot;Devil&apos;s Music&quot;theorem: Smooth Jazz = square root of all evil.

20.&quot;Two Americas&quot;Buffet theorem: Fresh salmon/flaccid spanakopita +
prime rib/limp eggrolls + jumbo shrimp/soggy chicken fingers = high
society gig/Elks Club gig.

21. How much should a gig pay, based on the following conditions:
drive 90 miles outside of town through pouring rain; set up two hours
in advance; load in through slimy kitchen accessed by treacherous
outdoor staircase; and play four hours of continuous crappy dance
favorites for drunk rich people?

Would you take it for 1/2 that much?

(If yes): Desperation/pride = 1

After you bid on the above gig for 1/3 your worth, a college student
offers to play the same gig for 1/2 as much. You are 12 times as good
as him, but 1/2 as good-looking. The client has a tin ear. Who will get
the job? Why do you bother practicing?

22. If a trumpet player counts off a tune in 4/4 at mm = 180, and the
drummer slows it down at a constant rate of deceleration over 8
measures to mm = 150, does the pianist still suck?

23. If a bassist plays a root, a pianist superimposes a major seventh
chord built on the fifth, and a saxophonist plays the 13th, will
attractive women notice? Will the drummer?

24. If (% of Americans who like jazz)&lt;(% of Americans who like
chainsaw sculptures), what is America&apos;s most
important indigenous art form?

bouncing quickly behind him ...

door, rushes in, slams and locks the door behind him.



However, the coffin crashes through his door, with the lid of the

coffin clapping ...

Rushing upstairs to the bathroom, the man locks himself in. His heart

is pounding, his head is reeling, his breath is coming in sobbing gasps.



With a loud CRASH the coffin breaks down the door, bumping and

clapping towards him.





The man screams and reaches for something, anything ... but all he can

find is a bottle of cough syrup!



Desperate, he throws the cough syrup at the coffin...

You&apos;re in Florida...In Miami, to be exact... There is chaos around you, caused by a hurricane and severe floods. This is a flood of major proportions. You are a photojournalist working for a major newspaper caught in the middle of this great disaster. The situation is nearly hopeless. You&apos;re trying to shoot career-making photos. There are houses and people swirling around you, some disappearing under the water. Nature is showing all its destructive fury. You see a man in the water! He is fighting for his life, trying not to be taken away with the water and debris.

You move closer. Somehow the man looks familiar. Suddenly, you know who it is... it&apos;s George W. Bush. At the same time you notice that the raging waters are about to take him under, forever. You have two options. You can save him or you can take the most dramatic photos of your life. You can save the life of President Bush, or you can shoot a Pulitzer Prize-winning photo, documenting the death of one of the world&apos;s most powerful men.

I sent it to my friend Jack who did work for McDonnell Douglas and he sent me this in return:

At some point when I was working for McDonnell Douglas the president of the company decided that his employes needed to be trained in ethics, and commanded that all managers attend ethics classes. Aside from the fact that the man was a fool and that unethical practices were being made at the top, not the bottom of the management chain, we nonetheless had to attend.

The first question our instructor posed to us was: Suppose you watch person leave an ATM, and he unkowingly drops a $20 bill to the ground. What ethical question is involved here?


Answer: Should you keep the $20 for yourself, or should you split it with your business partner. Tenorman June 22nd, 2005, 03:54 PM Ethics?? Ithn&apos;t that a county north eatht of Thutheckth Rump Roller July 26th, 2005, 09:41 AM Three Women -- One German, One Japanese And A Redneck Were

Dear Tech Support:

Last year I upgraded from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0. I soon noticed that the new program began unexpected child processing that took up a lot of space and valuable resources. In addition, Wife 1.0 installed itself into all other programs and now monitors all other system activity. Applications such as Poker Night 10.3, Football 5.0, Hunting and Fishing 7.5, and Racing 3.6 no longer run, crashing the system whenever selected. I can&apos;t seem to keep Wife 1.0 in the background while attempting to run my favourite applications. I&apos;m thinking about going back to Girlfriend 7.0, but the uninstall doesn&apos;t work on Wife 1.0.
Please help!

Thanks,
A Troubled User. (KEEP READING)




REPLY:
Dear Troubled User:

This is a very common problem that men complain about.
Many people upgrade from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0, thinking that it is just a Utilities and Entertainment program. Wife 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM and is designed by its Creator to run EVERYTHING!!! It is also impossible to delete Wife 1.0 and to return to Girlfriend 7.0. It is impossible to uninstall, or purge the program files from the system once installed. You cannot go back to Girlfriend 7.0 because Wife 1.0 is designed to not allow this. Look in your Wife 1.0 manual under Warnings-Alimony ChildSupport. I recommend that you keep Wife 1.0 and work on improving the situation. I suggest installing the background application&quot;Yes Dear&quot;to alleviate software augmentation.


The best course of action is to enter the command C:\APOLOGIZE because
ultimately you will have to give the APOLOGIZE command before the system
will return to normal anyway. Wife 1.0 is a great program, but it tends to be very high maintenance. Wife 1.0 comes with several support programs, such as Clean and Sweep 3.0, Cook It 1.5 and Do Bills 4.2! .

However, be very careful how you use these programs. Improper use will cause the system to launch the program Nag Nag 9.5. Once this happens, the only way to improve the performance of Wife 1.0 is to purchase additional software. I recommend Flowers 2.1 and Diamonds 5.0!

WARNING!!! DO NOT, under any circumstances, install Secretary with
Short Skirt 3.3. This application is not supported by Wife 1.0 and will cause
irreversible damage to the operating system.


Best of luck,

St. Peter asks the person in front of the pearly gates,&quot;What did you do in life?&quot;The reply - I was a physician - brought a generous smile from St. Peter who said,&quot;Very noble profession, you are welcome in heaven. Of course, there&apos;s nothing for you to do here as we have no illness of any kind, but you are most welcome in heaven. The bar on the left goes on forever, the buffet on the right goes on to eternity, and the pink fluffy looking cloud in the middle is where God hangs out; feel free to talk to God, eat and drink as much as you like; you are welcome in heaven.

St. Peter asks the next person,&quot;What did you do in life?&quot;The reply
-
I was a lawyer - brought a disgruntled look as St. Peter rolled his eyes and said,&quot;Well, everyone is welcome in heaven. Of course, there&apos;s nothing for you to do here as we have no crime or ill will or accidents of any kind, but you are welcome in heaven. The bar on the left goes on forever, the buffet on the right goes on to eternity, and the pink fluffy looking cloud in the middle is where God hangs out; feel free to talk to God, eat and drink as much as you like; you are welcome in heaven.

St. Peter asks the next person,&quot;What did you do in life?&quot;The reply
-
I was a jazz bassist - brought an excited response of delight as St. Peter excitedly said,&quot;You&apos;re going to love it here! The jam sessions go on forever! And you can play with Miles, or Trane, or Bill Evans. Duke Ellington writes a new piece for the band every day. There&apos;s plenty of solo space, no weird keys, nothing out of tune, no bad notes, no bad changes, and the time is always rock solid - you&apos;re going to love it here!

Uhh ..You didn&apos;t park out front, did you? Stay away from the bar and the buffet table - and don&apos;t try to talk to God - he&apos;s busy. Could you come in through the loading dock? And do you have a sound system we could use during breaks?

Keep well and stay swingin. Phil Kelly November 5th, 2005, 11:29 AM WASHINGTON, D.C. - Each year thousands are people are killed, maimed or annoyed by trombones. The statistics of head, neck and even shoulder injuries sustained by reed players, french horn and string sections seated within reach of the deadly seventh position are truly shocking...not to mention forced early retirement due to ever-increasing hearing problems reported by classical musicians of all types who are forced to play the music of Wagner, Mahler and Brahms, as well as the hundreds of alumni of the Herman, Ferguson and Kenton bands and OKOM devotees of Kid Ory, Jack Teagarden, Abe Lincoln Jim Robinson and Lee Gifford.

There is current legislation pending in Congress to restrict the sale of trombones and equip them with child-safety devices. The influential trombone lobby is, of course, opposed to this. There have even been several proposals for requiring a so-called&quot;trigger lock&quot;on all bass trombones! Every year there are reports of hundreds of innocent children, attracted by the shiny brass and smooth, seductive curves of an unattended instrument on a stand in the corner of a room or in an unlocked case who are traumatized for life by the attempts of a playmate to get a sound out of it, or who may suffer a collapsed lung or the effects of hyperventilation by trying the same effort themselves! The owner&apos;s feeble&quot;I didn&apos;t know the slide was unlocked&quot;is no excuse! Trombones should be stored out of reach of children.

Efforts to enact a mandatory 10-day waiting period to purchase a Trombone - which would simply allow a reasonable period of time for law Enforcement officials to cross-check the purchaser&apos;s name against an International list of registered trombone offenders and Slide-O-Mix addicts, have been repeatedly thwarted by the powerful Conn-Selmer-Yamaha (CSY) lobby. Law enforcement officials are particularly alarmed over the increase in crimes involving use of the&quot;sawed-off&quot;trombone or&quot;sackbut.&quot;Legislation is also pending in several progressive states, including New York and California, to make carrying a concealed alto trombone a Class A felony!

Some Governors feel that there are sufficient laws already on the Books that simply need stricter enforcement - such as the 1932 nation-wide ban of screw-on bells, the indiscriminate use of Pond&apos;s Cold Cream or KY Jelly and unsupervised emptying of spit valves on public property. Filthy unsanitary habit which will help spread the flu this year. One popular response to the spread of delinquent behavior is the imposition of mandatory longer sentences for those using a trombone while committing a crime (&quot;Use a trombone - Go to jail&quot;). Surveillance video tapes have proven especially effective in identifying violators of this statute because career criminals have often tried to avoid convictions by having their lawyers insist that what eye-witnesses reported as a trombone was really only an AK-47 or other legal assault weapon. Strict enforcement has been especially effective when used in conjunction with the new&quot;Three sharps, you&apos;re out&quot;statutes that have already been approved by many state legislatures.

Of course the automatic and semi-automatic valved models both piston and the middle-European rotary, are much more dangerous than the traditional single valve trombone. Interpol has also reported the sudden appearance of rear-blasting Cavalry models that were thought to have been completely eliminated during the Great Confiscation mandated by the 1918 Treaty of Versailles signed by representatives of every civilized country of the period. You may recall that those instruments were melted down and became an integral part of the Trans-Atlantic Telephone Cable that helped to unite America and Europe.

It is believed that the new source of these WMD&apos;s are isolated factories in rural areas of China. The awesome destructive power of the double trigger bass trombone could never have been imagined by the founding fathers when they granted us the right to keep and bear arms.

Remember: When trombones are outlawed, only outlaws will play&quot;I&apos;m Gettin&apos; Sentimental Over You.&quot; James November 5th, 2005, 11:44 AM Q: How does a trombone player play Seven Steps to Heaven?

A: Bop..bop..bop..bop..bwaaaaaaaah-oooooh-op.

Do you know the difference between a chain saw and a bass trombone,
you can tune a chain saw. the magnificent goldberg November 7th, 2005, 01:04 PM Here&apos;s a VERY old joke, said to have been written by Paul Desmond and AN Other, who managed to preserve his (or her) anonymity.

There was a boy of Italian parentage named Carbaggio, born in Germany. Feeling himself a misfit, with his dark curly hair among all those blond Nordic types, he tries to be even more German than the Germans. In late adolescence he flees to Paris, where he steals one of those brass miniatures of the Eiffel Tower. Arrested by the police, he is given a choice of going to jail or leaving the country. He boards the first outbound ship and arrives in New York. Thinking he would like a career in communications, he goes to the RCA building, takes an elevator and walks into the office of General Sarnoff. Sarnoff tells him that the only job available is as a strikebreaker. The boy takes it. When the strike ends, he finds himself on a union blacklist. He goes to work making sonar equipment for a company owned by a man named Harris. After several years, his English has improved to the point where he gets a job as a disk jockey. His show is called Rock Time. He has fulfilled his destiny: he&apos;s a routine teuton, Eiffel-lootin&apos;, Sarnoff goon from Harris Sonar, Rock Time Carbaggio.

:thewave: Phil Kelly November 8th, 2005, 11:20 AM since were into puns lately :

Subject: Puns R Us

1) Evidence has been found that William Tell and his family were avid
bowlers. However, all the league records were unfortunately destroyed in
a fire. Thus, we&apos;ll never know for whom the Tells bowled.

2) A man rushed into the doctor&apos;s office and shouted,&quot;Doctor! I think
I&apos;m shrinking!!&quot;The doctor calmly responded,&quot;Now, settle down and wait
your turn. You&apos;ll just have to be a little patient.&quot;

3) A marine biologist developed a race of genetically engineered
dolphins that could live forever if they were fed a steady diet of seagulls.
One day his supply of the birds ran out, so he had to go out and trap some
more. On the way back, he spied two lions asleep on the road. Afraid to wake
them, he carefully stepped over them. Immediately, he was arrested and
charged with transporting gulls across sedate lions for immortal porpoises.

4) A skeptical anthropologist was cataloging South American folk
remedies with the assistance of a tribal shaman who indicated that the
leaves of a particular fern were a sure cure for any case of constipation.
When the anthropologist expressed his doubts, the shaman looked him in the
eye and said,&quot;Let me tell you, with fronds like these, who needs enemas?&quot;

5) Back in the 1800s the Tates Watch Company of Massachusetts wanted to
produce other products and, since they already made the cases for pocket
watches, decided to market compasses for the pioneers traveling west. It
turned out that although their watches were of finest quality, their
compasses were so bad that people often ended up in Canada or Mexico rather
than California. This, of course, is the origin of the _expression,&quot;He who
has a Tates is lost!&quot;

6) A thief broke into the local police station and stole all the lavatory
equipment. At news conference later, a spokesperson was quoted as saying,
&quot;We have absolutely nothing to go on.&quot;

7) An Indian chief was feeling very sick, so he summoned the medicine
man. After a brief examination, the medicine man took out a long, thin
strip of elk hide and gave it to the chief, instructing him to bite off,
chew and swallow one inch of the leather every day. After a month, the
medicine man returned to see how the chief was feeling. The chief shrugged
and said,&quot;The thong is ended, but the malady lingers on.&quot;

8) A famous Viking explorer returned home from a voyage and found his
name missing from the town register. His wife insisted on complaining to the
local civic official who apologized profusely saying,&quot;I must have taken
Leif off my census.&quot;

9) There were three Indian squaws. One slept on a deer skin, one slept
on an elk skin and the third slept on a hippopotamus skin. All three became
pregnant and the first two each had a baby boy. The one who slept on the
hippopotamus skin had twin boys. This goes to prove that the squaw of the
hippopotamus is equal to the sons of the squaws of the other two hides. (if
you flunked geometry, you won&apos;t get it)

10) By the way, I know the guy who wrote these 9 puns. He entered them
and one other in a contest. He figured with 10 entries he couldn&apos;t lose. As
they were reading the list of winners he was really hoping one of his puns
would win, but unfortunately, no pun in ten did.



:gavel: :gavel: :gavel: jazzcritic November 8th, 2005, 11:28 AM So you like puns? Here&apos;s an oldie or two:

Hypotenuse: upstairs john is occupied

She was only a mortician&apos;s daughter but anyone cadaver.

True punishment (actually puns uttered by members of my family):

After my father&apos;s memorial service, my 70ish but still very young mother was discussing problems with bladder leakage to my cousins. She admitted to wearing an adult device (just in case) during a quick shopping trip. She then explained&quot;It&apos;s better to be safe...&quot;and I finished her sentence with&quot;...then soggy.&quot;

When my family was taking me away to college for the first time, my younger sister was complaining that her bladder was full. My father then spotted a truck stop ahead and said,&quot;Well, I don&apos;t know how clean it will be, but it may be the last opportunity for miles.&quot;As we approached it, he continued,&quot;Speak now....&quot;and my sister finished with&quot;...or forever hold your pee!&quot; the magnificent goldberg November 8th, 2005, 12:03 PM This bloke goes in shop and asks for Irish Sausages.

The Assistant looked at him and asked&quot;Are you Irish?&quot;

&quot;If I asked you for Italian Sausage, would you ask me if I was Italian? Or, if I asked for German Bratwurst, would you ask me if I was German? Or if I asked you for a Kosher Hot Dog, would you ask me if I was Jewish? Or, if I asked you for a Taco, would you ask me if I was Mexican? Would ya, ay? Would ya?&quot;

The assistant says,&quot;Well no&quot;.

&quot;And if I asked you for some Bourbon Whiskey, would you ask me if I was
American? What about Danish Bacon, would you ask me if I was Danish?&quot;

&quot;Well, I probably wouldn&apos;t,&quot;

With self-indignation, the man says,&quot;Well, all right then, why did you ask me if I&apos;m Irish just because I asked for Irish Sausages?&quot;

The Assistant replies,&quot;Because you&apos;re in Homebase.&quot;

MG the magnificent goldberg November 8th, 2005, 12:05 PM Subject: Irish Scones

An elderly Irishman lay dying in his bed. While suffering the agonies of impending death, he suddenly smelled the aroma of his favourite cheese scones wafting up the stairs. He gathered his remaining strength and lifted himself from the bed. Leaning against the wall, he slowly made his way out of the bedroom and with even greater effort, gripping the railing with both hands, he crawled downstairs. With laboured breath, he leaned against the door frame, gazing into the kitchen. Were it not for death&apos;s agony, he would have thought himself already in heaven, for here, spread out upon waxed paper on the kitchen table, were dozens of his favourite cheese scones.

Was it heaven? Or was it one final act of heroic love from his devoted Irish wife of sixty years, seeing to it that he left this world a happy man? Mustering one great final effort, he threw himself towards the table, landing on his knees in a rumpled posture. His parched lips parted, he could almost taste the cheese scone before it was in his mouth, seemingly bringing him back to life. The aged and withered hand trembled on its way to the nearest scone at the edge of the table, when his hand was suddenly smacked with a spatula by his wife. . . . . . . . . . . . .

















&quot;Fuck off !!&quot;she said,&quot;they&apos;re for the funeral !!&quot;

MG the magnificent goldberg November 8th, 2005, 12:24 PM A few Peter Kay gags. Some are a bit too English to be understood the world over, but I&apos;m not deleting them.

MG

&apos;I&apos;m not homophobic, I love my house!&apos;

I met a Dutch girl with inflatable shoes last week, phoned her up to arrange a date but unfortunately she&apos;d popped her clogs.

Two Eskimos sitting in a kayak were chilly; but when they lit a fire in the craft, it sank, proving once and for all that you can&apos;t have your kayak and heat it.

So I said&quot;Do you want a game of Darts?&quot;He said,&quot;OK then&quot;, I said&quot;Nearest to bull starts&quot;. He said,&quot;Baa&quot;, I said,&quot;Moo&quot;. He said,&quot;You&apos;re closest&quot;.

You see I&apos;m against hunting; in fact I&apos;m a hunt saboteur. I go out the night before and shoot the fox.

The other day I sent my girlfriend a huge pile of snow. I rang her up, I said&quot;Did you get my drift?&quot;.

So I went down the local supermarket, I said,&quot;I want to make a complaint, this vinegar&apos;s got lumps in it&quot;, he said,&quot;Those are pickled onions&quot;.

I saw this bloke chatting up a cheetah; I thought,&quot;He&apos;s trying to pull a fast one&quot;.

So I said to this train driver&quot;I want to go to Paris&quot;. He said&quot;Eurostar?&quot;I said,&quot;I&apos;ve been on telly but I&apos;m no Dean Martin&quot;.

So I said to the Gym instructor&quot;Can you teach me to do the splits?&quot;He said,&quot;How flexible are you?&quot;I said,&quot;I can&apos;t make Tuesdays&quot;.

But I&apos;ll tell you what I love doing more than anything: trying to pack myself in a small suitcase. I can hardly contain myself.

So I met this gangster who pulls up the back of people&apos;s pants, it was Wedgie Kray.

So I went to the Chinese restaurant and this duck came up to me with a red rose and says&quot;Your eyes sparkle like diamonds&quot;. I said,&quot;Waiter, I asked for a-ROMATIC duck&quot;.

But I&apos;m in great mood tonight because the other day I entered a competition and I won a year&apos;s supply of Marmite......... one jar.

So this bloke says to me,&quot;Can I come in your house and talk about your carpets?&quot;I thought,&quot;That&apos;s all I need, a Je-hoover&apos;s witness&quot;.

You see my next-door neighbour worships exhaust pipes, he&apos;s a catholic converter.

So I rang up British Telecom, I said,&quot;I want to report a nuisance caller.&quot;He said&quot;Not you again&quot;.

So I was having dinner with Garry Kasporov (world chess champion) and there was a check tablecloth. It took him two hours to pass me the salt.

He said,&quot;You remind me of a pepper-pot&quot;, I said&quot;I&apos;ll take that as a condiment&quot;.

And I&apos;ve got a friend who&apos;s fallen in love with two school bags, he&apos;s bisatchel.

So I was in Tesco&apos;s and I saw this man and woman wrapped in a barcode. I said,&quot;Are you two an item?&quot;

So a lorry-load of tortoises crashed into a trainload of terrapins, I thought,&quot;That&apos;s a turtle disaster&quot;.

Four fonts walk into a bar the barman says&quot;Oi - get out! We don&apos;t want your type in here&quot;

A jump-lead walks into a bar. The barman says&quot;I&apos;ll serve you, but don&apos;t start anything&quot;

A priest, a rabbi and a vicar walk into a bar. The barman says,&quot;Is this some kind of joke?&quot;

A sandwich walks into a bar. The barman says&quot;Sorry we don&apos;t serve food in here&quot;

A man walks into a bar with a roll of tarmac under his arm and says:&quot;Pint, please, and one for the road.&quot;

A three-legged dog walks into a saloon in the Old West. He slides up to the bar and announces:&quot;I&apos;m looking for the man who shot my paw.&quot;

A group of chess enthusiasts checked into a hotel and were standing in the lobby discussing their recent tournament victories. After about an hour, the manager came out of the office and asked them to disperse.&quot;But why?&quot;they asked, as they moved off.&quot;Because,&quot;he said&quot;I can&apos;t stand chess nuts boasting in an open foyer.&quot;

A woman has twins, and gives them up for adoption. One of them goes to a family in Egypt and is named&quot;Amal.&quot;The other goes to a family in Spain, they name him Juan&quot;. Years later; Juan sends a picture of himself to his mum. Upon receiving the picture, she tells her husband that she wished she also had a picture of Amal. Her husband responds,&quot;But they are twins. If you&apos;ve seen Juan, you&apos;ve seen Amal.&quot; the magnificent goldberg November 8th, 2005, 01:25 PM well I laughed.....................

The world expert on European wasps and the sounds that they make is
taking a stroll down his local high street. As he passes by the record shop, a sign catches his eye.

&quot;Just Released: New LP - Wasps of the World&amp;the sounds that they
make - available now!&quot;

Unable to resist the temptation, the man goes into the shop.

&quot;I am the world expert on European wasps and the sounds that they
make. I&apos;d very much like to listen to the new LP you have advertised
in the window.&quot;

&quot;Certainly, Sir,&quot;says the young man behind the counter.&quot;If you&apos;d
like to step into the booth and put on the headphones, I&apos;ll put the
LP on for you.&quot;

The world expert on European wasps goes into the booth and puts on
the earphones. Ten minutes later, he comes out of the booth and announces,&quot;I am the world expert on European wasps and the sounds that they make and yet I recognised none of those.&quot;

&quot;I&apos;m sorry sir,&quot;says the young assistant.&quot;If you&apos;d care to step
into the booth, I can let you have another few minutes.&quot;

The world expert on European wasps and the sounds that they make
steps back into the booth and replaces the headphones. Five minutes later, he comes out of the booth shaking his head.

&quot;I don&apos;t understand it,&quot;he says,&quot;I am the world expert on European
wasps and the sounds that they make, and yet I still can&apos;t recognise
any of those!&quot;

&quot;I&apos;m terribly sorry, sir&quot;says the young man,&quot;perhaps if you&apos;d like
to step into the booth again, you could have 5 more minutes.&quot;

Sighing, the world expert on European wasps and the sounds that they
make steps back into the booth. Five minutes later, he comes out again, clearly agitated.

&quot;I am the world expert on European wasps and the sounds that they
make and yet I have recognised none of the wasps on this LP.&quot;

&quot;I really am terribly sorry,&quot;says the young assistant.&quot;I&apos;ve just
realised I was playing you the bee side.&quot; the magnificent goldberg November 8th, 2005, 02:22 PM These are actual country lyric or song titles - and some of them are awesome!

If a small child is choking on an ice cube, don&apos;t panic. Simply pour a jug of boiling water down its throat and hey presto! The blockage is almost instantly removed.

Clumsy? Avoid cutting yourself while slicing vegetables by getting someone else to hold them while you chop away.

Keep the seat next to you on the train vacant by smiling and nodding at people as they walk up the aisle.

Save on booze by drinking cold tea instead of whisky. The following morning you can create the effects of a hangover by drinking a thimble full of washing up liquid and banging your head repeatedly on the wall.

Make bath times as much fun for kiddies as a visit to the seaside by pouring a bucket of sand, a bag of salt and a dog turd into the bath.

Don&apos;t buy expensive &apos;ribbed&apos; condoms, just buy an ordinary one and slip a handful of frozen peas inside it before you put it on.

X-Files fans. Create the effect of being abducted by aliens by drinking two bottles of vodka. You&apos;ll invariably wake up in a strange place the following morning, having had your memory mysteriously &apos;erased&apos;.

Don&apos;t waste money buying expensive binoculars. Stand closer to what you want to look at.

Putting just the right amount of gin in your goldfish bowl makes the fishes&apos; eyes bulge and causes them to swim in an amusing manner.

MG Saundra Hummer November 17th, 2005, 05:51 PM Tom walked into his usual hangout, the local sports bar around 9:58 PM. He sat down next to the stunning knock-down gorgeous blonde at the corner of the bar gave her a smile and a nod, and then stared up at the TV. The 10:00 News was on. The news crew was covering a story of a man on a ledge of a large building preparing to jump. The blonde looked at Tom and said,&quot;Do you think he&apos;ll jump?&quot;

Tom says,&quot;You know, I bet he&apos;ll jump!&quot;

The blonde replied,&quot;Well , I bet you he won&apos;t&quot;

Tom placed a $20 dollar bill on the bar and said,&quot;You&apos;re on!&quot;

Just as the blonde placed her money on the bar, the guy on the ledge did a swan dive off the building, plummeting to his death.
The blonde was very upset and handed her $20 to Tom, saying ,&quot;Fair&apos;s fair. Here&apos;s your money.&quot;

Tom replied,&quot;I can&apos;t take your money, I saw this earlier on the 6:00 news, and so I knew would jump.&quot;

The blonde all wide eyes replies,&quot;I did too; but I didn&apos;t think he&apos;d do it again.

Tom took the money. the magnificent goldberg November 18th, 2005, 01:50 AM Two Norwegians walk into a pet shop in Duluth. They head to the bird section and Sven says to Hans,&quot;Dat&apos;s dem.&quot;

The owner comes over and asks if he can help them.

&quot;Yeah, we&apos;ll take four of dem dere little budgies in dat cage up dere,&quot;says Sven.

The owner puts the budgies in a paper bag. Hans and Sven pay for the birds, leave the shop and get into Sven&apos;s pick-up and drive to the top of the Skyline Hwy Park.

At the park, they climb the Engor Tower.

Sven looks down at the 1000-foot drop and says:&quot;Dis looks like a grand place.&quot;

He takes two birds out of the bag, puts them on his shoulders and jumps off the top of the Tower.

Hans watches as Sven falls all the way to the bottom, killing himself stone dead.

Looking down at the remains of his best pal, Hans shakes his head and says:

&quot;Dis budgie jumping is too dangerous for me.&quot; jazzbo358 November 24th, 2005, 04:12 AM Bloke walks into work with a black eye, what happened to you a mate asks.

One day, they notice that Julio Iglesias is going to perform in their town, so they decide to go.

While they&apos;re sitting there in the front row, the nymphomaniac Siamese twin starts making eyes at Julio. He notices and stars making eyes back at her. This goes on for the whole show, and the twins end up getting invited backstage to his dressing room where Julio and the nymphomaniac Siamese twin go at it with each other all around the room. They do it in every conceivable postion, while the other Siamese twin hangs on for dear life and plays romantic music on the saxophone for them.

A year goes by, and the Siamese twins notice that Julio Iglesias is going to be performing in their town again.&quot;Hey,&quot;the nymphomaniac Siamese twin says,&quot;Julio Iglesias is coming back to town! Maybe we should call him up so we can get together with him again and party.&quot;

MG the magnificent goldberg January 31st, 2006, 09:48 AM And here&apos;s another bunch, cobbers

The questions below about Australia are from potential visitors. They were posted on an Australian Tourism Website and the (sometimes brilliant) answers are the actual responses by the website officials, who obviously have a sense of humour.

Q: Does it ever get windy in Australia? I have never seen it rain on TV, how do the plants grow? (UK).
A: We import all plants fully grown and then just sit around watching them die.

Q: Will I be able to see kangaroos in the street? (USA)
A: Depends how much you&apos;ve been drinking.

Q: I want to walk from Perth to Sydney - can I follow the railroad tracks? (Sweden)
A: Sure, it&apos;s only three thousand miles, take lots of water.

Q: Is it safe to run around in the bushes in Australia? (Sweden)
A: So it&apos;s true what they say about Swedes.

Q: Are there any ATMs in Australia? Can you send me a list of them in Brisbane, Cairns, Townsville and Hervey Bay? (UK)
A: What did your last slave die of?

Q: Can you give me some information about hippo racing in Australia? (USA)
A: A-fri-ca is the big triangle shaped continent south of Europe. Aus-tra-lia is that big island in the middle of the Pacific which does not... oh forget it. Sure, the hippo racing is every Tuesday night in Kings Cross. Come naked.

Q: Which direction is North in Australia? (USA)
A: Face south and then turn 180 degrees. Contact us when you get here and we&apos;ll send the rest of the directions.

Q: Can I bring cutlery into Australia? (UK)
A: Why? Just use your fingers like we do.

Q: Can you send me the Vienna Boys&apos; Choir schedule? (USA)
A: Aus-tri-a is that quaint little country bordering Ger-man-y, which is...oh forget it. Sure, the Vienna Boys Choir plays every Tuesday night in Kings Cross, straight after the hippo races. Come naked.

Q: Can I wear high heels in Australia? (UK)
A: You are a British politician, right?

Q: Are there supermarkets in Sydney and is milk available all year round? (Germany)
A: No, we are a peaceful civilisation of vegan hunter/gatherers. Milk is illegal.

Q: Please send a list of all doctors in Australia who can dispense Rattlesnake serum. (USA)
A: Rattlesnakes live in A-mer-i-ca which is where YOU come from. All Australian snakes are perfectly harmless, can be safely handled and make good pets.

Q: I have a question about a famous animal in Australia, but I forget its name. It&apos;s a kind of bear and lives in trees. (USA)
A: It&apos;s called a Drop Bear. They are so called because they drop out of Gum trees and eat the brains of anyone walking underneath them. You can scare them off by spraying yourself with human urine before you go out walking.

Q: Do you have perfume in Australia? (France)
A: No, WE don&apos;t stink.

Q: I have developed a new product that is the fountain of youth. Can you tell me where I can sell it in Australia? (USA)
A: Anywhere significant numbers of Americans gather.

Q: Can you tell me the regions in Tasmania where the female population is smaller than the male population? (Italy)
A: Yes, g@y nightclubs.

Q: Do you celebrate Christmas in Australia? (France)
A: Only at Christmas.

Q: I was in Australia in 1969 on R+R, and I want to contact the girl I dated while I was staying in Kings Cross. Can you help? (USA)
A: Yes, and you will still have to pay her by the hour.

Q: Will I be able to speak English most places I go? (USA)
A: Yes, but you&apos;ll have to learn it first.

It took several days to arrange for passport, visas, transportation into Iraq and the shipping of his equipment, but he was finally on his way.

Finally, in a small coffeehouse, he saw a huge man with a beard--wearing gold pajamas and shoes that curled up at the toes! Ed approached him and asked if he was Faisal. He was. Ed gave him the agent&apos;s card and Faisal&apos;s face brightened into a huge smile.

Ed arrived in the market at 7:00 to set up his gear. He introduced himself to the other musicians, who were all playing instruments he had never seen in his life. At 7:30 sharp, Faisal appeared and hopped on the bandstand, his gold pajamas glittering in the twilight. Without a word to the musicians, he lifted his arm for the downbeat.

&quot;Wait.&quot;shouted Ed.&quot;What are we playing?&quot;

A musician arrived at the pearly gates.

&quot;What did you do when you were alive?&quot;asked St. Peter.

&quot;I was the principal trombone player of the London Symphony Orchestra&quot;

&quot;Excellent! We have a vacancy in our celestial symphony orchestra for a trombonist. Why don&apos;t you turn up at the next rehearsal.&quot;

So, when the time for the next rehearsal arrived our friend turned up with his heavenly trombone [sic]. As he took his seat God moved, in a mysterious way, to the podium and tapped his batton to bring the players to attention. Our friend turned to the angelic second trombonist (!) and whispered,&quot;So, what&apos;s God like as a conductor?&quot;

&quot;Oh, he&apos;s O.K. most of the time, but occasionally he thinks he&apos;s von Karajan.&quot;

It was the night of the big symphony concert, and all the town notables showed up to hear it. However, it was getting close to 8 o&apos;clock and the conductor hadn&apos;t yet shown up. The theater&apos;s manager was getting desperate, knowing that he&apos;d have to refund everyone&apos;s money if he cancelled the concert, so he went backstage and asked all the musicians if any could conduct.

None of them could, so he went around and asked the staff if any of them could conduct. He had no luck there either, so he started asking people in the lobby, in the hope that maybe one of them could conduct the night&apos;s concert.

He still hadn&apos;t found anyone, so he went outside and started asking everybody passing by if they could conduct. He had no luck whatsoever and by this time the concert was 15 minutes late in starting. The assistant manager came out to say that the crowd was getting restless and about ready to demand their money back.

The desperate manager looked around and spied a cat, a dog, and a horse standing in the street.&quot;Oh, what the heck,&quot;he exclaimed,&quot;let&apos;s ask them--what do we have to lose?&quot;

So the manager and assistant manager went up to the cat, and the manager asked&quot;Mr. cat, do you know how to conduct?&quot;The cat meowed&quot;I don&apos;t know, I&apos;ll try,&quot;but though it tried really hard, it just couldn&apos;t stand upright on its hind legs. The manager sighed and thanked the cat, and then moved on to the dog.

&quot;Mr. dog,&quot;he asked,&quot;do you think you can conduct?&quot;The dog woofed&quot;Let me see,&quot;but although it was able to stand up on its hind legs and wave its front paws around, it just couldn&apos;t keep upright long enough to last through an entire movement.

&quot;Well, nice try,&quot;the manager told the dog, and with a sigh of resignation turned to the horse.&quot;Mr. horse,&quot;he asked,&quot;how about you--can you conduct?&quot;The horse looked at him for a second and then without a word turned around, presented its hind end, and started swishing its tail in perfect four-four time.

&quot;That&apos;s it!&quot;the manager exclaimed,&quot;the concert can go on!&quot;However, right then the horse dropped a load of plop onto the street. The assistant manager was horrified, and he told the manager&quot;We can&apos;t have this horse conduct! What would the orchestra think?&quot;

The manager looked first at the horse&apos;s rear end and then at the plop lying in the street and replied&quot;trust me--from this angle, the orchestra won&apos;t even know they have a new conductor!&quot;

Once upon a time, there was a blind rabbit and blind snake, both living in the same neighborhood. One beautiful day, the blind rabbit was hopping happily down the path toward his home, when he bumped into someone. Apologizing profusely he explained,&quot;I am blind, and didn&apos;t see you there.&quot;

&quot;Perfectly all right,&quot;said the snake,&quot;because I am blind, too, and did not see to step out of your way.&quot;

A conversation followed, gradually becoming more intimate, and finally the snake said,&quot;This is the best conversation I have had with anyone for a long time. Would you mind if I felt you to see what you are like?&quot;

&quot;Why, no,&quot;said the rabbit.&quot;Go right ahead.&quot;

So the snake wrapped himself around the rabbit and shuffled and snuggled his coils, and said,&quot;MMMM! You&apos;re soft and warm and fuzzy and cuddly...and those ears! You must be a rabbit.&quot;

&quot;Why, that&apos;s right!&quot;said the rabbit.&quot;May I feel you?&quot;

&quot;Go right ahead.&quot;said the snake, stretching himself out full length on the path.

The rabbit began to stroke the snake&apos;s body with his paws, then drew back in disgust.&quot;Yuck!&quot;he said.&quot;You&apos;re cold...and slimy... you must be a conductor!&quot;

&quot;This one can sing Wagner&apos;s entire Ring cycle. There&apos;s another one in the back room for $30,000.&quot;

A violinist was auditioning for the Halle orchestra in England. After his audition he was talking with the conductor.&quot;What do you think about Brahms?&quot;asked the conductor.

&quot;Ah...&quot;the violinist replied,&quot;Brahms is a great guy! Real talented musician. In fact, he and I were just playing some duets together last week!&quot;

The conductor was impressed.&quot;And what do you think of Mozart?&quot;he asked him.

&quot;Oh, he&apos;s just swell! I just had dinner with him last week!&quot;replied the violinist. Then the violinist looked at his watch and said he had to leave to catch the 1:30 train to London.

Afterwards, the conductor was discussing him with the board members. He said he felt very uneasy about hiring this violinist, because there seemed to be a serious credibility gap. The conductor knew for certain that there was no 1:30 train to London.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tenorman February 1st, 2006, 02:47 PM A Player&apos;s Guide for Keeping Conductors in Line
by Donn Laurence Mills

If there were a basic training manual for orchestra players, it might include ways to practice not only music, but one-upmanship. It seems as if many young players take pride in getting the conductor&apos;s goat. The following rules are intended as a guide to the development of habits that will irritate the conductor. (Variations and additional methods depend upon the imagination and skill of the player.)

Never be satisfied with the tuning note. Fussing about the pitch takes attention away from the podium and puts it on you, where it belongs.
When raising the music stand, be sure the top comes off and spills the music on the floor.
Complain about the temperature of the rehearsal room, the lighting, crowded space, or a draft. It&apos;s best to do this when the conductor is under pressure.
Look the other way just before cues.
Never have the proper mute, a spare set of strings, or extra reeds. Percussion players must never have all their equipment.
Ask for a re-audition or seating change. Ask often. Give the impression you&apos;re about to quit. Let the conductor know you&apos;re there as a personal favor.
Pluck the strings as if you are checking tuning at every opportunity, especially when the conductor is giving instructions. Brass players: drop mutes. Percussionists have a wide variety of dropable items, but cymbals are unquestionably the best because they roll around for several seconds.
Loudly blow water from the keys during pauses (Horn, oboe and clarinet players are trained to do this from birth).
Long after a passage has gone by, ask the conductor if your C# was in tune. This is especially effective if you had no C# or were not playing at the time. (If he catches you, pretend to be correcting a note in your part.)
At dramatic moments in the music (while the conductor is emoting) be busy marking your music so that the climaxes will sound empty and disappointing.
Wait until well into a rehearsal before letting the conductor know you don&apos;t have the music.
Look at your watch frequently. Shake it in disbelief occasionally.
Tell the conductor,&quot;I can&apos;t find the beat.&quot;Conductors are always sensitive about their&quot;stick technique&quot;, so challenge it frequently.
As the conductor if he has listened to the Bernstein recording of the piece. Imply that he could learn a thing or two from it. Also good: ask&quot;Is this the first time you&apos;ve conducted this piece?&quot;
When rehearsing a difficult passage, screw up your face and shake your head indicating that you&apos;ll never be able to play it. Don&apos;t say anything: make him wonder.
If your articulation differs from that of others playing the same phrase, stick to your guns. Do not ask the conductor which is correct until backstage just before the concert.
Find an excuse to leave rehearsal about 15 minutes early so that others will become restless and start to pack up and fidget.
During applause, smile weakly or show no expression at all. Better yet, nonchalantly put away your instrument. Make the conductor feel he is keeping you from doing something really important.
It is time that players reminded their conductors of the facts of life: just who do conductors think they are, anyway?

A community orchestra was plagued by attendance problems. Several musicians were absent at each rehearsal. As a matter of fact, every player in the orchestra had missed several rehearsals, except for one very faithful oboe player. Finally, as the dress rehearsal drew to a close, the conductor took a moment to thank the oboist for her faithful attendance. She, of course, humbly responded&quot;It&apos;s the least I could do, since I won&apos;t be at the performance.&quot;

Saint Peter is checking ID&apos;s at the Pearly Gates, and first comes a Texan.&quot;Tell me, what have you done in life?&quot;says St. Peter.

The Texan says,&quot;Well, I struck oil, so I became rich, but I didn&apos;t sit on my laurels--I divided all my money among my entire family in my will, so our descendants are all set for about three generations.&quot;

St. Peter says,&quot;That&apos;s quite something. Come on in. Next!&quot;

The second guy in line has been listening, so he says,&quot;I struck it big in the stock market, but I didn&apos;t selfishly just provide for my own like that Texan guy. I donated five million to Save the Children.&quot;

&quot;Wonderful!&quot;says Saint Peter.&quot;Come in. Who&apos;s next?&quot;

The third guy has been listening, and says timidly with a downcast look,&quot;Well, I only made five thousand dollars in my entire lifetime.&quot;

&quot;I was a school teacher.&quot;

&quot;Go right through those pearly gates. Next! And what did you do on Earth?&quot;

&quot;I was a musician.&quot;

&quot;Go around the side, up the freight elevator, through the kitchen...&quot;

A guy walks into the doctor&apos;s office and says,&quot;Doc, I haven&apos;t had a bowel movement in a week!&quot;The doctor gives him a prescription for a mild laxative and tells him,&quot;If it doesn&apos;t work, let me know.&quot;

A week later the guy is back:&quot;Doc, still no movement!&quot;

The doctor says,&quot;Hmm, guess you need something stronger,&quot;and prescribes a powerful laxative.

Still another week later the poor guy is back:&quot;Doc, STILL nothing!&quot;

The doctor, worried, says,&quot;We&apos;d better get some more information about you to try to figure out what&apos;s going on. What do you do for a living?&quot;

&quot;I&apos;m a musician.&quot;

The doctor looks up and says,&quot;Well, that&apos;s it! Here&apos;s $10.00. Go get something to eat!&quot;

Three violin manufactures have all done business for years on the same block in the small town of Cremona, Italy. After years of a peaceful co-existence, the Amati shop decided to put a sign in the window saying:&quot;We make the best violins in Italy.&quot;The Guarneri shop soon followed suit, and put a sign in their window proclaiming:&quot;We make the best violins in the world.&quot;Finally, the Stradivarius family put a sign out at their shop saying:&quot;We make the best violins on the block.&quot;

Once there was a violinist who got a gig to play a recital at a mental institution. He played the recital brilliantly, and backstage after the concert, he got a visit from one of the institutionalized patients.

&quot;Oh, the concert you played was just lovely. The Paganini caprice was stunning, the counterpoint in the Bach came out so clearly, and the phrasing in your Debussy was just exquisite!&quot;, said the patient.

&quot;Why, thank you,&quot;said the musician (thinking this person seemed pretty normal for a institutionalized person).&quot;Are you by chance a musician?&quot;

&quot;Oh yes, I was concertmaster of an orchestra for many years, I&apos;ve played all of the major concertos: Tchaikowsky, Brahms, Mozart, all the major ones.&quot;said the patient.

&quot;Wow, that&apos;s impressive,&quot;said the violinist.&quot;Did you do recitals as well?&quot;

&quot;Oh yes, I&apos;ve done all the major sonatas, Bach, Kreisler, Vieuxtemps, all of the major ones,&quot;said the patient.

&quot;Wow! Did you ever do chamber music?&quot;asked the violinist.

&quot;Oh yes. Duets, trios, quintets, sextets, all the major repertoire,&quot;said the patient.

Puzzled, the violinist asked&quot;Did you ever play string quartets?&quot;

All of the suddenly the patient went berserk and shouted&quot;String quartets!... String quartets!... String quartets!...&quot;

Quite a number of years ago, the Seattle Symphony was doing Beethoven&apos;s Symphony No. 9 under the baton of Milton Katims.

Now at this point, you must understand two things:

There&apos;s a quite long segment in this symphony where the basses don&apos;t have a thing to do. Not a single note for page after page.
There used to be a tavern called Dez&apos;s 400, right across the street from the Seattle Opera House, rather favored by local musicians.
It had been decided that during this performance, once the bass players had played their parts in the opening of the symphony, they were to quietly lay down their instruments and leave the stage, rather than sit on thier stools looking and feeling dumb for twenty minutes. Once they got backstage, someone suggested that they trot across the street and quaff a few brews.

When they got there, a European nobleman recognized that they were musicians, and bought them several rounds of drinks. Two of the bassists passed out, and the rest of the section, not to mention the nobleman, were rather drunk. Finally, one of them looked at his watch and exclaimed,&quot;Look at the time! We&apos;ll be late!&quot;

The remaining bassists tried in vain to wake up their section mates, but finally those who were still conscious had to give up and run across the street to the Opera House.


While they were on their way in, the bassist who suggested this excursion in the first place said,&quot;I think we&apos;ll still have enough time--I anticipated that something like this could happen, so I tied a string around the last pages of the score. When he gets down to there, Milton&apos;s going to have to slow the tempo way down while he waves the baton with one hand and fumbles with the string with the other.&quot;

Sure enough, when they got back to the stage they hadn&apos;t missed their entrance, but one look at their conductor&apos;s face told them they were still in serious trouble. Katims was furious! After all...

It was the bottom of the Ninth,
the basses were loaded,
the score was tied,
there were two men out,
and the Count was full.

The following program notes are from an unidentified piano recital.

Tonight&apos;s page turner, Ruth Spelke, studied under Ivan Schmertnick at the Boris Nitsky School of Page Turning in Philadelphia. She has been turning pages here and abroad for many years for some of the world&apos;s leading pianists.

In 1988, Ms. Spelke won the Wilson Page Turning Scholarship, which sent her to Israel to study page turning from left to right. She is winner of the 1984 Rimsky Korsakov Flight of the Bumblebee Prestissimo Medal, having turned 47 pages in an unprecedented 32 seconds. She was also a 1983 silver medalist at the Klutz Musical Page Pickup Competition: contestants retrieve and rearrange a musical score dropped from a Yamaha. Ms. Spelke excelled in&quot;grace, swiftness, and especially poise.&quot;

For techniques, Ms. Spelke performs both the finger-licking and the bent-page corner methods. She works from a standard left bench position, and is the originator of the dipped-elbow page snatch, a style used to avoid obscuring the pianist&apos;s view of the music. She is page turner in residence in Fairfield Iowa, where she occupies the coveted Alfred Hitchcock Chair at the Fairfield Page Turning Institute.

Ms. Spelke is married, and has a nice house on a lake.

Math/Logic Quiz
Wilson is tired of paying for clarinet reeds. If he adopts a policy of playing only on rejected reeds from his colleagues will he be able to retire on the money he has saved if he invests it in mutual bonds, yielding 8.7%, before he is fired from his job? If not, calculate the probablitity of him ever working in a professional symphony orchestra again!
Jethro has been playing the double bass in a symphony orchestra for 12 years, three months and seven days. Each day, his inclination to practice decreases by the equation: (total days in the orchestra) x 0.0076. Assuming he stopped practising altogether four years, six months and three days ago, how long will it be before he is completely unable to play the double bass?
Wilma plays in the second violin section, but specializes in making disparaging remarks about conductors and other musicians. The probability of her making a negative comment about any given musician is 4 chances in 7, and for conductors is 16 chances out of 17. If there are 103 musicians in the orchestra and the orchestra sees 26 different conductors each year, how many negative remarks does Wilma make in a two-year period? How does this change if five of the musicians are also conductors? What if six of the conductors are also musicians?
Horace is the General Manager of an important symphony orchestra. He tries to hear at least four concerts a year. Assuming that at each concert the orchestra plays a minimum of three pieces per concert, what are the chances that Horace can avoid hearing a single work by Mozart, Beethoven or Brahms in the next ten years?
Betty plays in the viola section. Despite her best efforts she is unable to play with the rest of the orchestra and, on average, plays 0.3528 seconds behind the rest of the viola section, which is already 0.16485 seconds behind the rest of the orchestra. If the orchestra is moving into a new concert hall with a reverberation time of 2.7 seconds, will she be able to continue playing this way undetected?
Ralph loves to drink coffee. Each week he drinks three more cups of coffee than Harold, who drinks exactly one third the amount that the entire brass section consumes in beer. How much longer is Ralph going to live?
Rosemary is unable to play in keys with more than three sharps or flats without making an inordinate number of mistakes. Because her colleagues in the cello section are also struggling in these passages she has so far been able to escape detection. What is the total number of hours they would all have to practice to play the complete works of Richard Strauss?

Re: Schubert&apos;s Symphony No. 8 in B minor.


After attending a rehearsal of this work we make the following observations and recommendations:

We note that the twelve first violins were playing identical notes, as were the second violins. Three violins in each section, suitably amplified, would seem to us to be adequate.
Much unnecessary labour is involved in the number of demisemiquavers in this work; we suggest that many of these could be rounded up to the nearest semiquaver thus saving practice time for the individual player and rehearsal time for the entire ensemble. The simplification would also permit more use of trainee and less-skilled players with only marginal loss of precision.
We could find no productivity value in string passages being repeated by the horns; all tutti repeats could also be eliminated without any reduction of efficiency.
In so labour-intensive an undertaking as a symphony, we regard the long oboe tacet passages to be extremely wasteful. What notes this instrument is called upon to play could, subject to a satisfactory demarcation conference with the Musician&apos;s Union, be shared out equitably amongst the other instruments.
Conclusion: if the above recommendations are implemented the piece under condsideration could be played through in less than half an hour with concomitant savings in overtime, lighting and heating, wear and tear on the instruments and hall rental fees. Also, had the composer been aware of modern cost-effective procedures he might well have finished this work.

As he sat sipping his coffee, a young woman sat down next to him. She turned to the cowboy and asked,&quot;Are you a real cowboy?&quot;

He replied,&quot;Well, I&apos;ve spent my whole life breaking colts, working cows, going to rodeos, fixing fences, pulling calves, bailing hay, doctoring calves, cleaning my barn, fixing flats, working on tractors, and feeding my dogs, so I guess I am a cowboy.&quot;

She said,&quot;I&apos;m a lesbian. I spend my whole day thinking about women. As soon as I get up in the morning, I think about women. When I shower, I think about women. When I watch TV, I think about women. I even think about women when I eat. It seems that everything makes me think of women.&quot;

The two sat sipping in silence. A little while later, a man sat down on the other side of the old cowboy and asked,&quot;Are you a real cowboy?&quot;

This one struck me so funny, Rich too as I just read it to him. The person who wrote this knows of these things, ha! Pulling calves was the give away. The funny thing is, everytime we leave this area, or where we lived in California, we&apos;re asked that question, Are you a real cowboy,&amp;cowgirl, then they want to know if we&apos;re&quot;just wannabe&apos;s?&quot;We tell them we&apos;re&quot;usetobe&apos;s&quot;, now we can just tell everyone that Rich is a lesbian.

Unfortunately, there&apos;s only one space left that day, so the Angel must decide which of them gets in. The Angel asks Dolly if there&apos;s some particular reason why she should go to Heaven.

Dolly takes off her top and says,&quot;Look at these, they&apos;re the most perfect breasts God ever created, and I&apos;m sure it will please God to be able to see them every day, for eternity.&quot;

The Angel thanks Dolly, and asks Her Majesty the same question.

The Queen takes a bottle of Perrier out of her purse, shakes it up, and gargles. Then, she spits into a toilet and pulls the lever.

The Angel says,&quot;OK, your Majesty, you may go in.&quot;

Dolly is outraged and asks,&quot;What was that all about? I show you two of God&apos;s own perfect creations and you turn me down. She spits into a commode and she gets in! Would you explain that to me?&quot;

&quot;Sorry, Dolly,&quot;says the Angel,&quot;but even in Heaven, a royal flush beats a pair - no matter how big they are.

MG the magnificent goldberg February 14th, 2006, 01:53 AM A farmer went out one day and bought a brand new stud rooster for his chicken coop. The new rooster struts over to the old rooster and says,

&quot;OK old fart, time for you to retire.&quot;

The old rooster replies,&quot;come on, surely you cannot handle ALL of these chickens. Look what it has done to me. Can&apos;t you just let me have the two old hens over in the corner?&quot;

The young rooster says,&quot;Beat it: You are washed up and I am taking over.&quot;

The old rooster says,&quot;I tell you what, young stud. I will race you around the farmhouse. Whoever wins gets the exclusive domain over the entire chicken coop.&quot;

The young rooster laughs.&quot;You know you don&apos;t stand a chance, old man. So, just to be fair, I will give you a head start.&quot;

The old rooster takes off running. About 15 seconds later the young rooster takes off running after him. They round the front porch of the farmhouse and the young rooster has closed the gap.

He is only about 5 feet behind the old rooster and gaining fast. The farmer, meanwhile, is sitting in his usual spot on the front porch when he sees the roosters running by. He grabs his shotgun and - BOOM - he blows the young rooster to bits. The farmer sadly shakes his head and says,&quot;Darn.....third gay rooster I bought this month.&quot;

Moral of this story? ...

Don&apos;t mess with us OLD FARTS - age, skill, and treachery will always overcome youth and arrogance!

They get back to his apartment and she notices that his bedroom is completely packed with sweet cuddly teddy bears. Hundreds of cute, small bears on a shelf all the way along the floor, cuddly medium-sized ones on a shelf a little higher, and huge enormous bears on the top shelf along the wall. The woman is surprised that this guy would have a collection of teddy bears, especially one that&apos;s so extensive, but she decides not to mention this to him, and actually is quite impressed by his sensitive side.

She turns to him... they kiss... and then they rip each other&apos;s clothes off... After an intense night of passion with this sensitive guy, they are lying there together in the afterglow, the woman rolls over and asks, smiling,&quot;Well, how was it?&quot;

When she asked how her grandfather had died, her grandmother

Horrified, Katie told her grandmother that two people nearly
100 years old having sex would surely be asking for trouble.

&quot;Oh, no, my dear,&quot;replied granny.&quot;Many years ago, realizing

She was admired for her sweetness and kindness to all. One afternoon the pastor came to call on her and she showed him into her quaint sitting room. She invited him to have a seat while she prepared tea.

As he sat facing her old Hammond organ, the young minister noticed a cut-glass bowl sitting on top of it. The bowl was filled with water, and in the water floated, of all things, a condom! When she returned with tea and scones, they began to chat.

The pastor tried to stifle his curiosity about the bowl of water and its strange floater, but soon it got the better of him and he could no longer resist.&quot;Miss Beatrice&quot;, he said,&quot;I wonder if you would tell me about this?&quot;pointing to the bowl.

&quot;Oh, yes,&quot;she replied,&quot;Isn&apos;t it wonderful? I was walking through the park a few months ago and I found this little package on the ground.

There was no shortage of extremely young, idealistic ladies in attendance, one of whom approached the Sergeant Major for conversation.

&quot;Excuse me, Sergeant Major, but you seem to be a very serious man. Is something bothering you?&quot;

&quot;Negative, ma&apos;am. Just serious by nature.&quot;

The young lady looked at his awards and decorations and said,&quot;It looks like you have seen a lot of action.&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&apos;am, a lot of action.&quot;

The young lady, tiring of trying to start up a conversation, said,&quot;You know, you should lighten up a little. Relax and enjoy yourself.&quot;

The Sergeant Major just stared at her in his serious manner. Finally the young lady said,&quot;You know, I hope you don&apos;t take this the wrong way, but when is the last time you had sex?&quot;

&quot;1955, ma&apos;am.&quot;

&quot;Well, there you are. You really need to chill out and quit taking everything so seriously! I mean, no sex since 1955! She took his hand and led him to a private room where she proceeded to&quot;relax&quot;him several times. Afterwards, panting for breath, she leaned against his bare chest and said,&quot;Wow, you sure didn&apos;t forget much since 1955!&quot;

As Tiger gets out of the car, two tees fall out of his pocket.

&quot;So what are those things, laddie?&quot;asks the attendant.

&quot;They&apos;re called tees,&quot;replies Tiger.

&quot;And what would ya be usin &apos;em for, now?&quot;inquires the Irishman.

&quot;Well, they&apos;re for resting my balls on when I drive,&quot;replies Tiger.

&quot;Those fellas at Mercedes think of everything... Old Pa March 15th, 2006, 03:30 PM A young woman was about to finish her first year of college. Like so many others her age, she considered herself to be a very liberal Democrat, and was very much in favor of the redistribution of wealth. She was deeply ashamed that her father was a rather staunch Republican, a feeling she openly expressed. Based on the lectures that she had participated in, and the occasional chat with a professor, she felt that her father had for years harbored an evil, selfish desire to keep what he thought should be his.

One day she was challenging her father on his opposition to higher taxes on the rich and the addition of more government welfare programs. The self-professed objectivity proclaimed by her professors had to be the truth and she indicated so to her father. He responded by asking how she was doing in school. Taken aback, she answered rather haughtily that she had a 4.0 GPA, and let him know that it was tough to maintain, insisting that she was taking a very difficult course load and was constantly studying, which left her no time to go out and party like other people she knew. She didn&apos;t even have time for a boyfriend, and didn&apos;t really have many college friends because she spent all her time studying.

Her father listened and then asked,&quot;How is you friend Audrey doing?&quot;

She replied,&quot;Audrey is barely getting by. All she takes are easy classes, she never studies, and she barely has a 2.0 GPA. She is so popular on campus, college for her is a blast. She&apos;s always invited to all the parties, and lots of times she doesn&apos;t even show up for classes because she&apos;s too hung over.&quot;

Her wise father asked his daughter,&quot;Why don&apos;t you go to the Dean&apos;s office and ask him to deduct a 1.0 off your GPA and give it to your friend who only has a 2.0. That way you will both have a 3.0 GPA and certainly that would be a fair and equal distribution of GPA.&quot;

The daughter, visibly shocked by her father&apos;s suggestion, angrily fired back,&quot;That wouldn&apos;t be fair! I have worked really hard for my grades! I&apos;ve invested a lot of time, and a lot of hard work! Audrey has done next to nothing toward her degree. She played while I worked my tail off!&quot;

The father slowly smiled, winked and said gently,&quot;Welcome to the Republican Party.&quot; Dennis_M March 15th, 2006, 03:55 PM And just how many republicans do you think actually earned their money, relative to how hard the common laborer has to work just to make ends meet?

&quot;We&apos;re sorry Mr. Wilkens, but we have some information about your wife,&quot;said one trooper.

&quot;Tell me!! Did you find her?&quot;Wilkens shouted.

The troopers looked at each other. One said,&quot;We have some bad news, some good news, and some really great news. Which do you want to hear first?&quot;

Fearing the worst, an ashen Mr. Wilkens said,&quot;Give me the bad news first.&quot;

The trooper said,&quot;I&apos;m sorry to tell you, sir, but this morning we found your wife&apos;s body in Kachemak Bay.&quot;

&quot;Oh my God!&quot;exclaimed Wilkens. Swallowing hard, he asked,&quot;What&apos;s the good news?&quot;

The trooper continued.&quot;When we pulled her up she had 2 twenty-five pound king crabs and 6 good-size Dungeness crabs on her.&quot;

Stunned, Mr. Wilkens demanded,&quot;If that&apos;s the good news, what&apos;s the great news?&quot;

The trooper said,&quot;We&apos;re going to pull her up again tomorrow.&quot; Dennis_M March 15th, 2006, 05:29 PM Move it to the right thread, or consider yourself a joke. Old Pa March 15th, 2006, 05:43 PM Move it to the right thread, or consider yourself a joke.
More vituperative leftist spirits (and still no joke)?

Another:

There was an attorney who got home late one evening after a very taxing day trying to get a stay of execution for a client, named Wilbur Wright, who was due to be hanged for murder at midnight. His last minute plea for clemency to the state governor had failed and he was feeling tired and depressed. As soon as he got through the door his wife started on about,&quot;What time of night do you call this? Where the hell have you been?&quot;and so on.

Too shattered to play his usual role in this familiar ritual, he went and poured himself a very large whisky and headed off to the bathroom for a long hot soak -- pursued by the predictable sarcastic remarks. While he was in the bath the phone rang, which the wife answered to be told that her husband&apos;s client had been granted his stay of execution after all. Realizing what a day he must have had, she relented a little and went upstairs to give him the good news.

As she opened the bathroom door she was greeted by the sight of her husband&apos;s rear view as he bent naked over the bath cleaning the tub.&quot;They&apos;re not hanging Wright tonight,&quot;she said, at which the attorney whirled round and screamed hysterically,&quot;For crying out loud woman ... don&apos;t you ever stop?&quot; Fran March 15th, 2006, 06:40 PM A young woman was about to finish her first year of college. Like so many others her age, she considered herself to be a very liberal Democrat, and was very much in favor of the redistribution of wealth. She was deeply ashamed that her father was a rather staunch Republican, a feeling she openly expressed. Based on the lectures that she had participated in, and the occasional chat with a professor, she felt that her father had for years harbored an evil, selfish desire to keep what he thought should be his.

One day she was challenging her father on his opposition to higher taxes on the rich and the addition of more government welfare programs. The self-professed objectivity proclaimed by her professors had to be the truth and she indicated so to her father. He responded by asking how she was doing in school. Taken aback, she answered rather haughtily that she had a 4.0 GPA, and let him know that it was tough to maintain, insisting that she was taking a very difficult course load and was constantly studying, which left her no time to go out and party like other people she knew. She didn&apos;t even have time for a boyfriend, and didn&apos;t really have many college friends because she spent all her time studying.

Her father listened and then asked,&quot;How is you friend Audrey doing?&quot;

She replied,&quot;Audrey is barely getting by. All she takes are easy classes, she never studies, and she barely has a 2.0 GPA. She is so popular on campus, college for her is a blast. She&apos;s always invited to all the parties, and lots of times she doesn&apos;t even show up for classes because she&apos;s too hung over.&quot;

Her wise father asked his daughter,&quot;Why don&apos;t you go to the Dean&apos;s office and ask him to deduct a 1.0 off your GPA and give it to your friend who only has a 2.0. That way you will both have a 3.0 GPA and certainly that would be a fair and equal distribution of GPA.&quot;

The daughter, visibly shocked by her father&apos;s suggestion, angrily fired back,&quot;That wouldn&apos;t be fair! I have worked really hard for my grades! I&apos;ve invested a lot of time, and a lot of hard work! Audrey has done next to nothing toward her degree. She played while I worked my tail off!&quot;

The father slowly smiled, winked and said gently,&quot;Welcome to the Republican Party.&quot;


No Joke - Just Stupid bubber March 16th, 2006, 03:11 AM Hey hey hey - if Old Pa finds the republican joke funny, it&apos;s his problem - if you want to debate the content of it - do it on the political forum.

Makes me think of the Muhammed drawings in Denmark -
of course the paper had a right to publish them, but it was a stupid thing to do. Just like you have the right to post political jokes here, even one as pointless as the one in question.

I liked the one about the crabfishing wife, though. Old Pa March 16th, 2006, 04:52 AM I liked the one about the crabfishing wife, though.
It&apos;s either all funny or it&apos;s all not funny. I thought the Repulsivcan father joke was funny on at least two levels. Especially on the level of any presumption it was true. *sigh* Thank God for Norton AntiVirus, though, somebody out there not only is a worm but likes to send them, too.

Another:

A Scotsman goes to the dentist and asks how much it is for a tooth extraction.&quot;$85 for an extraction sir,&quot;was the dentist&apos;s reply.

&quot;Och, huv yer no got anythin&apos; cheaper?&quot;replies the Scotsman.

&quot;But that&apos;s the normal charge for an extraction sir&quot;said the dentist.

&quot;What about if yer din&apos;t use any anesthetic?&quot;asked the Scotsman hopefully.

&quot;Well it&apos;s highly unusual sir, but if that&apos;s what you want, I suppose I can do it for $70,&quot;said the dentist.

&quot;Hmmmm, what about if yer used one of your dentist trainees and still without anesthetic,&quot;asked the Scotsman.

&quot;Well it&apos;s possible; but they are only training and I can&apos;t guarantee their level of professionalism and it may be a lot more painful. I suppose in that case, we can bring the price down to say $40,&quot;said the dentist.

&quot;Och that&apos;s still a wee bit much, how about if yer make it a trainin&apos; session and have yer student do the extraction and the other students watchin&apos; and learnin,&quot;said the Scotsman hopefully.

&quot;Hmmmmm, well OK it&apos;ll be good for the students I suppose. I&apos;ll charge you only $5 in that case,&quot;said the dentist.

&quot;Ach, now yer talkin&apos; laddie! It&apos;s a deal,&quot;said the Scotsman. . . . . .&quot;Can yer confirm an appointment for the wife next Tuesday then?&quot; Fran March 16th, 2006, 05:25 AM I wasn&apos;t debating it - only comment, whether political or not that there was no tickling punchline to it - although come to think of it, it was a political statement not a joke - should have been in the political forum.

The Dentist joke is a joke Rump Roller March 16th, 2006, 06:51 AM Down south, Bubba called his attorney and asked,&quot;Is it true theys suin them cigarette companies fer causin people to git cancer ?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Bubba, sure is true,&quot;responded the lawyer.

&quot;And now someone is suin them fast food restaurants fer makin them fat an cloggin their arteries with all them burgers an fries, is that true, Mista Lawyer?&quot;

&quot;Sure is, Bubba.&quot;

&quot;And that lady sued McDonalds for millions when she was gave that hot coffee that she ordered?&quot;

&quot;Yep.&quot;

&quot;And that football player sued that university when he gradiated and still couldnt read?&quot;

&quot;Thats right,&quot;said the lawyer.

&quot;But why are you asking?&quot;

&quot;Well, I was thinkin . . . What I want to know is, kin I sue Budweiser fer all them ugly women I slept with? Rump Roller March 16th, 2006, 07:27 AM A couple has a dog that snores. Annoyed because she can&apos;t sleep,the wife goes to the vet to see if he can help. The vet tells the woman to tie a ribbon around the dog&apos;s testicles and he will stop snoring. Yeah, right!&quot;she says.
A few minutes after going to bed, the dog begins snoring, as usual. The wife tosses and turns, unable to sleep. Muttering to herself, she goes to the closet and grabs a piece of red ribbon and ties it carefully around the Dog&apos;s testicles. Sure enough, the dog stops snoring! The woman is amazed.

Later that night, her husband returns home drunk from being out drinking with his buddies. He climbs into bed, falls asleep, and begins snoring loudly. The woman thinks maybe the ribbon might work on him, so she goes to the closet again, grabs a piece of blue ribbon, and ties it around her husband&apos;s testicles. Amazingly it also works on him! The woman sleeps soundly. The husband wakes from his drunken stupor and stumbles into the bathroom. As he stands in front of the toilet, he glances in the mirror and sees a blue ribbon attached to his privates. He is very confused and as he walks back into the bedroom, he sees the red ribbon attached to his dog&apos;s testicles. He shakes his head and looks at the dog and Whispers&quot;don&apos;t know where we were, or what we did, but, by God, we took first and second place!

Your opinion - try this:

Two nuns, Sister Marilyn and Sister Helen, are traveling through Europe in their car. They get to Transylvania and are stopped at a traffic light. Suddenly, out of nowhere, a tiny little Dracula jumps onto the hood of the car and hisses at them through the windshield.

&quot;Quick, quick!&quot;shouts Sister Marilyn.&quot;What shall we do?&quot;

&quot;Turn the windshield wipers on! That will get rid of the abomination,&quot;says Sister Helen.

Sister Marilyn switches them on, knocking Dracula about, but he clings on and continues hissing at the nuns.&quot;What shall I do now?&quot;she shouts.

&quot;Switch on the windshield washer! I filled it up with Holy Water at the Vatican,&quot;says Sister Helen.

Sister Marilyn turns on the windshield washer. Dracula screams as the water burns his skin, but he clings on and continues hissing at the nuns.&quot;Now what?&quot;shouts Sister Marilyn.

&quot;Show him your cross,&quot;says Sister Helen.

&quot;Now you&apos;re talking,&quot;says Sister Marilyn. She opened the window and shouts,&quot;Get the fuck off the car!&quot; Old Pa March 21st, 2006, 01:44 PM Last week I purchased a burger at Burger King for $3.58. The counter girl took my $4.00 and I pulled 8 cents from my pocket and gave it to her. She stood there, holding the nickel and 3 pennies. While looking at the screen on her register, I sensed her discomfort and tried to tell her to just give me two quarters, but she hailed the manager for help. While he tried to explain the transaction to her, she stood there and cried.

Why do I tell you this? Because of the evolution in teaching math since the 1950s:

Teaching Math In 1950: A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100. His cost of production is 4/5 of the price. What is his profit?

Teaching Math In 1960: A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100. His cost of production is 4/5 of the price, or $80. What is his profit?

Teaching Math In 1970: A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100. His cost of production is $80. Did he make a profit?

Teaching Math In 1980: A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100. His cost of production is $80 and his profit is $20 Your assignment: Underline the number 20.

Teaching Math In 1990: A logger cuts down a beautiful forest because he is selfish and inconsiderate and cares nothing for the habitat of animals or the preservation of our woodlands. He does this so he can make a profit of $20. What do you think of this way of making a living? Topic for class participation after answering the question: How did the birds and squirrels feel as the logger cut down their homes? (There are no wrong answers.)

Teaching Math In 2000: Un ranchero vende una carretera de madera por $100. El cargo de produccion es $80. Cuantas tortillas se puede comprar? sergio March 26th, 2006, 02:42 PM Dubya is in a primary school, smiling to the journalists and shaking hands in front of the cameras.
Then, he meets the pupils in their classrooms. While visiting the last classroom, he decides to call for some questions.
Well, boys, says George, whos got a question for the President?
A little boy raises his hand. Mr President, can I make three questions?.
Of course you can, my dear! Whats your name?.
Billy, Mr. President.
Alright, Billy: what questions do you want to put me?.
First, why did you declare a war to Iraq without UN approval? Second, why are you our president, if Gore took more votes? Third, wheres Osama Bin Laden?
Well... These are pretty difficult questions, my dear... says Dubya, very confused. In that moment, the lunchtime bell rings. Well, says Bush with a breath of relief, Ill answer right after lunchtime.
After lunchtime, children are in their classroom again.
Well, whos got a question?, says Dubya.
A little boy raises his hand.
Yeah, boy! Whats your name?.
Steve, Mr. President.
Alright, Steve: what question do you want to put?.
Ive got five questions, Mr. President. First, why did you declare a war to Iraq without UN approval? Second, why are you our president, if Gore took more votes? Third, wheres Osama Bin Laden? Fourth, why did lunchtime bell ring twenty minutes earlier than usual? And fifth: WHERE THE HELL IS BILLY!!.

That one gets around. Heard it a couple of years ago like this:
Hillary Clinton goes to a primary school in New York to talk about the world. After her talk she offers question time. One little boy puts up his hand, and the Senator asks him what his name is.&quot;Kenneth,&quot;&quot;And what is your question, Kenneth?&quot;
&quot;I have three questions: First - whatever happened to your medical health care plan? Second - why would you run for President after your husband shamed the office? Third - whatever happened to all those things you took when you left the White House?&quot;
Just then the bell rings for recess. Hillary Clinton informs the kiddies that they will continue after recess. When they resume Hillary says,&quot;Okay where were we? Oh, that&apos;s right, question time. Who has a question?&quot;
A different little boy puts his hand up; Hillary points him out and asks him what his name is.
&quot;Larry.&quot;
&quot;And what is your question?&quot;
&quot;I have five questions: First - whatever happened to your medical health care plan? Second - why would you run for President after your husband shamed the office? Third - whatever happened to all those things you took when you left the White House? Fourth - why did the recess bell go off 20 minutes early? and Fifth - what happened to Kenneth?&quot;

And it&apos;s probably been around even longer than that. May even go back to Il Duce. Of course back then, it wasn&apos;t a joke. :eek: sergio March 27th, 2006, 03:13 AM May even go back to Il Duce. Of course back then, it wasn&apos;t a joke. :eek:

Responding to this speculation would move this into the topic of&quot;current events&quot;, not jokes like this one:

On a chain of beautiful deserted tropical islands in the middle of nowhere, the following people are stranded:


Two Italian men and one Italian woman.
Two French men and one French woman.
Two German men and one German woman.
Two Greek men and one Greek woman.
Two British men and one British woman.
Two Bulgarian men and one Bulgarian woman.
Two Japanese men and one Japanese woman.
Two Vietnamese men and one Vietnamese woman.
Two Irish men and one Irish woman.
Two American men and one American woman.

One month later, on these absolutely stunning deserted islands in the middle of nowhere, the following things have occurred:


One Italian man killed the other Italian man for the Italian woman...
The two French men and the French woman are living happily together in a menage a trois.
The two German men have a strict weekly schedule of alternating visits with the German woman.
The two Greek men are sleeping together and the Greek woman is cooking and cleaning for them.
The two British men are waiting for someone to introduce them to the British woman.
The two Bulgarian men took one look at the Bulgarian woman and started swimming to another island.
The two Japanese men have faxed Tokyo and are awaiting instructions.
The two Vietnamese men have set up a pharmacy, liquor store, restaurant, and laundry, and have gotten the woman pregnant in order to supply employees for their stores.
The two Irish men divided the island into north and south and setup a distillery. They do not remember if sex is in the picture because it gets somewhat foggy after a few liters of coconut whiskey. However, they&apos;re satisfied because the English aren&apos;t having any fun.
The two American men are contemplating suicide, because the American woman will not shut up and complains relentlessly about her body, the true nature of feminism, what the sun is doing to her skin, how she can do anything they can do, the necessity of fulfillment, the equal division of household chores, how sand and palm trees make her look fat, how her last boyfriend respected her opinion and treated her nicer than they do, and how her relationship with her mother is the root cause of all her problems, and why didn&apos;t they bring a damn cell phone so they could call 911 and get them all rescued off this Godforsaken deserted island in the middle of freaking nowhere so she can get her nails done and go shopping. the magnificent goldberg March 27th, 2006, 06:46 AM Responding to this speculation would move this into the topic of&quot;current events&quot;, not jokes like this one:
