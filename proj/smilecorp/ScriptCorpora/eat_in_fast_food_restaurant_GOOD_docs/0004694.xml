 Entrepreneurship :   Why does no one open a healthy fast food restaurant chain?
 All healthy food is not cardboard powerbars or sandwiches (like Subway) - so why are there no drive-thru chains where you can pick up healthful delicious food? 2+ Comments Loading... • Post • Wiki

     Joey Flores , Capitalist Hippie and CEO at Earbits 14 votes by Keith Rabois , John Clover , Josh Pigford , (more) Loading... I&apos;ll probably delete this answer when a better one comes along (since I am no expert) but my guesses are:


 Fast food chains work because the experience is consistent no matter which store you go to. A McDonald&apos;s hamburger is always a (crappy) McDonald&apos;s hamburger. This has a lot to do with their food being processed the same way, in bulk, and widely distributed. Much of it is distributed frozen. Healthy food implies less processing, more fresh ingredients, and these things are harder to keep consistent from location to location, state to state. Healthy food is more expensive. People usually go to a fast food restaurant with the expectation that it will not only be fast, but cheap. When your fast food meal starts climbing up to $8 for a smaller portion (in keeping consistent with being healthy), it no longer seems like fast food or the best use of your money. McDonald&apos;s can sell a cheeseburger for $.99. At a healthy fast food place, you could barely get an apple for $.99. Additionally, the unhealthy option probably carries higher margins and most companies big enough to start a&quot;chain&quot;care less about making a healthy option than they do about making more profits. Most Americans are not that focused on eating healthy, or their idea of eating healthy is very skewed. The Subway I went to in Nebraska didn&apos;t even offer their veggie patty. It would go to waste there. I ordered avocado on my lettuce sandwich and the girl said,&quot;What?&quot; I said,&quot;Avocado, like you make guacamole with.&quot; She said,&quot;Oh, we don&apos;t have guacamole.&quot; This leads me to believe that a healthy chain would only survive in certain regions. Fast food places also tend to cater to as wide a base as possible. Jack in the Box sells tacos and hamburgers because it wants groups who can&apos;t make up their mind to go to Jack in the Box. By pigeon-holing your restaurant as only having healthy options, you get guys like me who want to eat there but who are unable to drag their unhealthy friends there. Or people only go when they&quot;want to eat healthy&quot;, as opposed to making that their regular place because the food is just good.

You have not heard of them or seen them at every freeway exit because they do not succeed outside of their small local markets. And many don&apos;t even succeed there.

That said, there are still chains like Chipotle and Panera that focus on soup and salad, with burritos or sandwiches served as well (coming a higher calorie count).

But, in the end, I ask what constitutes&quot;healthy and delicious&quot;food? It seems to me that foods that are very tasty, but avoiding fat and high calorie counts, are time consuming to make. Additionally they often do not sit well for long periods of time. This makes it difficult to produce in this manner for a fast food restaurant. 2+ Comments Loading... • Post • Insert a dynamic date here     Mike DeVries 2 votes by Todd Gardiner and Miguel Paraz Over the last 5 - 7 year, Fast Food has been a difficult category to find prosperity in. Its been compressed from the top by the&quot;fast casual&quot;chains and to an even greater extent, from the bottom by grocery. Health eating is a big concern to all the chains. Subway is the leader here with a pretty major brand effort over several years to own&quot;fresh&quot;as a brand position. Other fast food chains reposition or differentiate their offerings similarly - adding salads (taco bell), emphasizing french fries that are cut from whole potatoes (in n out burger), etc.

Perhaps the biggest competiton comes from grocery which has taken major share from fast food with ready to eat meals. If I&apos;m looking for healthy food in a hurry, I&apos;m most likely to go to Whole Foods, Trader Joes or even Safeways.  Aside from driving down i5, these options offer the convenience of fast food and can morth quickly to fill most any new market trend, making the development of a new fast food concept very difficult to pull off. Comment Loading... • Post • Insert a dynamic date here     Brian Dear , I don&apos;t use Quora anymore 3 votes by Roberto Previtera , Dimitrios Ploutarchos , and Miguel Paraz I often make the drive from La Jolla all the way up to SIlicon Valley and back. What is unfortunate is that all along the way, the food available wherever there are clusters of gas stations, restaurants, and motels is always the same: In-n-Out, Jack-in-the-Box, McDonald&apos;s, Carl&apos;s Jr, Taco Bell, Subway. All junk. 

Joey Flores makes good points in his answer elsewhere on this Quora page, but, I still believe there is a market for a chain of GOOD, HEALTHY fast-food restaurants, even higher priced than fast food. I would gladly pay $5-10 for a fresh salad, soup, tofu, lentils, other veggies, fish, fruit, nuts, all stuff very fresh and healthy, if I could do so while on these long drives. 

Some of the issues preventing this from happening could be taken care of with mobile phones.  For example, when I reach a certain point on I-5, I fire up an iPhone app and&quot;ping&quot; the restaurant, indicating that I am 10 miles away hurtling forward at 70MPH. I submit an order I&apos;ve already chosen in advance, or, I pick something from an easy list of my frequent orders. I tap a&quot;submit&quot;button, the app sends it along to the restaurant, and they start preparing it. I arrive at the restaurant 10 minutes later, the food is ready, I pull up to the drive thru, the food is already paid for by my mobile app using my credit card (or the charge is made when I pull up), I show a barcode on my iPhone&apos;s screen indicating it&apos;s me, the scan the barcode right off the screen, and voila, I have my fresh food and I pull over into a parking lot and eat.

Fresh food. Every time. No more garbage while on long drives.

It can be done. It will be done. And I look forward to it. Post • Insert a dynamic date here     David Davisson , Librarian 1 vote by Patrick Davis Evo&apos;s is a healthy fast-food chain with franchises available: http://www.evos.com/

When people hear the words&quot;fast food&quot;they think Burger King, they think Wendy&apos;s; they think unhealthy.
If a consumer has made the decision to go out and eat&quot;fast food&quot;they have already made a conscious decision to eat something that is generally bad for them. I think this has played a large role in the inability of healthy restaurants to break into the fast food market. I think if consumers want to eat healthy, they will seek out a restaurant that isn&apos;t labeled as a fast food restaurant. I&apos;m certain there have been tons of restaurants that have tried to crack the code and break in to the market as a healthy restaurant, but the demand truly isn&apos;t there. If someone hears the a fast food restaurant being labeled as healthy, they probably will be skeptical and feel they are having the wool pulled over their eyes. 1+ Comments Loading... • Post • Insert a dynamic date here Loading...
