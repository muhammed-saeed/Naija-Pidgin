 Fast food’s most unhealthy french fries 

February 25th, 2010, 3:27 am· ·posted by Nancy Luna, Staff Writer 
 
Five Guys cuts and blanches its Russet potatoes before frying them in peanut oil.
 
We all know that french fries aren’t the best thing for you on any restaurant menu.

But how unhealthy are they? Men’s Health magazine recently reported its findings in America’s Worst French Fries report. And, boy, am I devastated by one of the chains that made the list: Five Guys Burgers&amp;Fries .

The fries at Five Guys are oh-so-good. But, alas, the fresh-cut potatoes, fried in peanut oil, were named the Worst Regular Order of Fries.

The nutritional breakdown of a large order: 1,464 calories, 71 g fat (14 g saturated) and 213 mg sodium.

 Five Guys is set to open its first Orange County unit in Orange later this year. I asked local franchisee Phil Ratner, who operates two other Five Guys in Cerritos and Carson, what he thought about the‘worst’ranking. He said most customers split a large.

“We tell our customers that a large fry feeds 3 to 4 people depending on appetite and a regular feeds 2-3,”he said.”Our regular customers have all of this figured out after a couple of visits.”

To my surprise, McDonald’s fries were dubbed the“best”fries to eat if you insist on eating French fries.  Here’s why:  a small order contains 230 calories, 11 g fat (1.5 g saturated) and 160 mg sodium.

Other chains that made the list: 

 Worst Fries for Your Blood Pressure 

Dairy Queen Chili Cheese Fries

“There’s as much sodium in this side dish as you’ll find in 15 strips of bacon,”the report stated.

 Worst Wedge Fries 
Jack in the Box Bacon Cheddar Wedges
 
McDonald&apos;s fries
 
 Worst Curly Fries
 Arby’s Curly Fries
