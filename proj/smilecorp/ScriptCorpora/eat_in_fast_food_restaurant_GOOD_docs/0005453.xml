Printable coupons allow customers to print out vouchers redeemable for savings at stores and online, on their home printer. Printable coupons are online coupons that are available either in the form of an image or downloadable file, such as a PDF or Microsoft Word document.

Printable coupons are available for many different types of items, from How to Find grocery store foods, retail items and supplies to pizza and fast food restaurant take-out items. Printable coupons can be found on websites devoted entirely to gathering up these offers onto one site for consumers. Grocery stores may offer coupons on their own websites, as will restaurants and retail stores. Many stores will offer customers the opportunity to sign up for an email that will include periodic discounts.

Some precautions to take are to check the coupon for the product name and size for which it qualifies. It will clearly state the offer. Most coupons will have an expiration date which will limit the use of the coupon. Some coupons are only good for a certain region or product. Printable coupons can be misused or fraudulent and some stores will not accept duplicated coupons or ones missing a bar code. Stores are not obligated to redeem online coupons.

Printed coupons have been in use for decades, primarily distributed through newspaper inserts and special direct mail pieces. Some of the first coupons were used by manufacturers of Post cereals and Coke. C.W. Post gave out one cent coupons while Asa Candler of Coke gave out paper tickets for free glasses of the beverage. Coupons started being used more during the depression and by 1965 half of United States families used coupons.

Coupons on the Internet, sometimes known as printable coupons, came about in the 1990s when the Internet became more available to the average American. With the rise in Internet usage, more coupons are available to be printed out on a person&apos;s home computer.
