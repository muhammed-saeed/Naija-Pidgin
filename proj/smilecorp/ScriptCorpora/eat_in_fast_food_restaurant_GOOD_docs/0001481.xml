 Kanye West: Black People Have GOOD FOOD, White People Have GOOD CREDIT!!! 
 
 December 21, 2007 :
 MediaTakeOut.com got its hands on a recent quote that Kanye West gave to Spin Magazine . Check out this foolisness: Im a pop enigma. I live and breathe every element in life. I rock a bespoke suit and I go to Harolds for fried chicken. Its all these things at once, because, as a tastemaker, I find the best of everything.

Theres certain things that black people are the best at and certain things that white people are the best at. Whatever we as black people are the best at, Im a go get that. Like, on Christmas I dont want any food that tastes white. And when I go to purchase a house, I dont want my credit to look black. Kanye&apos;s talkin&apos; crazy again. Sounds like he&apos;s on the road to recovery...

I love Kanye but he is so off-the-wall sometimes with the shyt he be saying...he is one of those people who thinks out loud
 CandiedYam 
it&apos;s true, white food is rarely good food. have you ever had german potato salad? eww...
 KEEL 
HE&apos;S MENTALLY ILL. I&apos;VE SAID IT BEFORE AND I&apos;LL SAY IT AGAIN. HE SURE COMES UP WITH SOME OFF-THE-WALL BULL#%@T ALL THE TIME, IN HIS SONGS AND IN HIS STATEMENTS. HE&apos;S AN EMBARASSMENT TO BLACK PEOPLE.
 qt_pie 
he teling the truth! What a shame too! Black people need tostick together and build somethings that will generate money and benefit our community. Just because an artist donates some toys to their community dont mean [EXPLETIVE] thats a easy way out. Go build something that we can support and benfit from and at thesame time you making ur money and keeping it in our community but iguesssince we hate each other some much thats not going to happen. Rick Ross building a fast food restaurant is not gointo help any one out but the docotrs who will treat the patients with IBS and heart disease and cancer etc.... We need to build something get the whites money and keep they doe in our system. Instead we get some money and go buy gucci or fendi and louis and guess who prospers from that?? Not us!!
 blackdaddy1696 
WELL HATE IT OR NOT BUT ITS TRUE!!
 Sixx2007 
Maybe the posters have bad credit, but not all. SOME of us have been taught to manage money. Kanye is wacky sometimes.

I love the Kanye-isms. He can be so on point in a twisted, read-between-the-lines way.
 whatwhatwhat 
Preach on Kayne. I don&apos;t need no ni99a with no bad credit. Can&apos;t buy me sh!t but Harold&apos;s Chicken.
 teedy123 
Kanye is too damn outspoken. It&apos;s time that he gets his act together, because the&quot;black credit people&quot;was the same folks who brought you where you are today...don&apos;t forget they didn&apos;t even let your winny cryin azz open for the VMA&apos;s.

 TskTsk264 
Ugh. Why does he always have to go there? Because lord knows my credit is on point. But besides that, his comments, no matter how innocent he wants them to be, always come off as ignorant and inconsiderate.
 Kasey30 
keel&amp;blackthought yall are too stupid or blind to understand what he is talking about.
QT PIE I&apos;m with you!,ps black ppls food is better than yt, whether it be caribbean food or soul food. cant noone fuk wit us in the kitchen!!!

 classc1 
I love Kanye...but this is some racist BS. There are PLENTY of white people with bad credit. Just check out the message bards at creditboards.com and you will see all the broke ass, bad credit white people that you would ever care to meet!! URGH!!!
 ivehadenuffofyall 
what happened, a dude can&apos;t tell a joke anymore cuz he&apos;s a rapper? if katt williams said that ish it wouldnt be a problem! what yall need to be talking about is what the feezie is Ye wearing in that picture!!
 alotgoingon 
JUST ANOTHER IGNORANT COMMENT BY KANYE. dAYUM. tHE ONLY THING THAT HE ACTUALLY HAS KNOWLEDGE ON IS MUSIC AND STYLE. AND WE WONDER WHY BLACKS HAVE SO MNAY NEGATIVE STEREOTYPES. BECAUSE OF IDIOTS LIKE HIM!
 theoneuneed 
LMAO..kanye is definately certifiable.
 I understand what he was trying to say though.
Two words..Greenbean Casserole! (* I&apos;m gagging*)!

If those heffas at the office bring that crap in for the Holiday party like they did last month, I&apos;ll scream. And no less than 3 people brought it !
As for the credit comment.. I admit that mine is not stellar. But I have been working on that for the last year. Just about ready to buy a house.
 Redz87 
I agree 100% he&apos;s a gemini like me so we always think very random and out loud. I definitely want to be rocking some Jordans and eating popeyes chicken but I want to live in a quiet neighborhood and have good ass credit like the white people. Great minds think alike. I feel you 100% Kanye!

 mmmama 
my man. he aint told no lies on that one there. yall need to stop frontin. plus it was funny.
 boyshorts28 
He is so fuuucking stupid. I never liked his azz and for the record I have work in collection for 7yrs and when I tell you that I have phone and sented out letters to just as many white people as black so he can go on with that shiit. All white dont have good credit on all black dont have bad credit.
 mephyme 
I&apos;ll admit, though, Paula Dean can take over my kitchen and dang gum day of the week, for real. I made her sweet potatoes (RIGHT, SWEET POTATOES!!) over thanksgiving and yeah, we were printing off the recipes for everyone there by the end of the night. So there is one exception. You gotta love a chick who can cook a meatloaf with a fist full of diamonds. It&apos;s gotta be a southern thing.
 Kasey30 
on the real you all know that if a white man w/ a 550 credit score&amp;a black man w/ a 550 credit score apply for the same loan they will NOT get the same rate or credit limit, hell one might not even get approved! we know which one that is. MAY the RED BLACK&amp;GREEN, rise up&amp;wise up!
 mypleasure 
You can say that again boyshorts28.. Kanye needs to think before he speaks
 She_So_Fly 
LOL @ mephyme!!

I never did like Kanye&apos;s &apos;holier than thou&apos; attitude. But stangely enough, to a small degree he has a point.........
 travieboo7 
IT&apos;S TRUE..SOME WHAT...LOL
 Kasey30 
ihadenuf of yall I cosign, If a comedian said it none of these ppl would be making a big deal of it
 Goodhope247 
as annoying at Kanye may appear at least he consistant with his craziness. Ya&apos;ll know if he was a comedian and he said this in a comedy club it would be okay. Black comedians say it all the time.
 madamluv 
This actually isnt true bcuz i know a lot blacks with great credit,but everything is nearly given to whites, they have connections with one another to help them get over the edge and start over fresh when things go wrong for them.
 Niosoul 
this is partly true...

Black people have been stuck with these sterotypes for generations and the sad part is we take it.

We need to change this...we don&apos;t beleive in our people, lets help our community acheive the best !

I luv your music kanye but not for this one...your not helping the situaion
 Niosoul 
@ madamluv

you hit the nail on the head...these people have connections to clear their name.......ummm WE DON&apos;T ! ( well nobody that I know at least)

and young kan ain&apos;t stoping to realize it or maybe he does and wants us to read between the lines

thats why I keep mines on point so Im not stuck with the stupidity !
 KEEL 
@Kasey30, you are the one sounding stupid (just like Kanye)!!!

I AGREE WITH @blackthought, boyshorts28, alotgoingon, MrsNega85 and others with intellect, KANYE IS A CONFUSED FOOL WHO IS ALWAYS DOWNING HIS PEOPLE. MORON NEEDS TO GO SOMEWHERE AND SIT DOWN AND SHUT-UP, AND QUIT LOOKING SILLY WITH THOSE STATEMENTS.

I am not even a Kanye fan but he is right, he says things alot of us think but cant or wont say. It is the realest [EXPLETIVE] tho. I am glad that he speaks his mind but he needs to be careful because they will Tupac his butt when its starts to get outta hand. i dontthink he is racist just too damn smart. he wants us to listen. Black people dont get so offended not all of us have bad credit and not all whites have good credit I beleev his statement was in general becasue we as a community have to do better if we wanna survive what the man has in store for us down the road. He wants us to wake up and stick together and do something great with our skills time and money! I am with you Kanye. he talk real jus like Pac. Folks need to stop being so defensive and listen we spend alot of time talkin [EXPLETIVE] but rarely do we listen and get the message within the message. WE have the resources to achieve but not every one uses it. Prayer is powerful lets use that too!!! God bless stay strong black people think before you speak and try to listen.
 PRTTYBRWNGIRL 
WHEN I READ THIS, I WAS LIKE KANYE IS A CLOW LOL ... BLACK PEOPLE WE CAN GET ALL MAD IF WE WANT TO AND SAY HE TALKIN OUTTA HIS ASS BUT THE TRUTH IS A GREAT MAJORITY OF BLACKS DO HAVE BAD CREDIT. SO EVERYBODY ON HERE GETTING ALL MAD JUST NEED TO QUIT FRONTIN. IF ALL BLACKS HAD PERFECT CREDIT THEN WE WOULDNT BE LIVING IN PROJECTS AND AT THE POVERTY LEVEL. ALTHOUGH KANYE DOES NEED A PUBLICIST TO TELL HIM TO SHUT THE FUCC UP AT TIMES, ITS REAL TALK. WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE I HAD BAD CREDIT. MAXED OUT ALL THEM DAMN CARDS LOL BUT WHEN I GRADUATED&amp;STARTED GETTING PAID I WORKED HARD TO CLEAN IT UP SO IM NOT GONE FRONT ON THE DUDE AND TRY TO ACT LIKE WHAT HE SAYING DIDNT HAVE A BIT OF TRUTH IN IT PLUS EVERYBODY KNOW WHITE PEOPLE CANT COOK (SORRY ITS THE TRUTH, I HATE GOING OVER MY IN LAWS FOR THE HOLLIDAYS :(
 PRTTYBRWNGIRL 
WITH THEY BLAND ASS MAC&amp;CHEESE AND WEIRD SMELLING FOOD. I WALKED IN MY MOTHER IN LAW&apos;S HOUSE AND SAID, WHY ARE YOU DOING BAR-B-Q FOR THANKSGIVING, SHE SAID OH DEAR THATS NOT BBQ, ITS MAC&amp;CHEESE. WHAT THE FUCC!!! SO, YEA I WANT MY FOOD BLACK AND MY CREDIT WHITE TOO LOL (ALTHOUGH DONT BE FOOLED THERE ARE MORE OF THEM WITH BAD CREDIT THAN YOU THINK)
 qt_pie 
@ keel i dont believ he is downing his people rather than wake them up. its time and been al ong time coming but then you go and start being ignorant towards someone voicing their own opinion. it still does not change their views on the subject but you make ur self look bad just ready to fight for what absolutley nothing. fight for a cause. this is so sad to me.
 HovisHome 
KANYE FOR PRESIDENT!!! I wonder if Oprah would back him too..
 mzarrogance 
good for all of you with good credit!!! i mean that, really. but as a whole, most blacks do not have credit scored in the 700s. if no one sees any truth in this, then, oh well. wake up. blacks DO pay higher interests rates on large purchases like homes and cars and that because of BAD CREDIT.
 mzarrogance 
LOL at pretty brown - honey, please help out the in-laws. tell her you will cook.

Although!: the one thing that hurts kanye is his lack of balance! and ...his delivery and timing in commenting, opinioning, responding. There&apos;s a time and a place for your personal airing.. And when asked a question and in giving a response back You must carefully choose your position FIRST before you speak! ... because when jump out there out of measure mouth first)it can create a backlash for you! In your own words best said Kanye ...&quot;don&apos;t ever fix your lips like collagen to say something and then you end up apolagen&quot;!... *excuse my grammar.

 tjmcphatter 
Don&apos;t hate, Kanye is right. What percentage of blacks have good credit, huh??? Mine ain&apos;t the best, and I have nobody to blame but myself. Any ya&apos;ll know black folks can cook their a$$es off!! That&apos;s why we all flock together for the holidays!!!! Even in some restaurants you can tell who is doing the cooking in the back!!!!
 mephyme 
I like the Saturday Night Live skit they did on Rachel Ray&apos;s show&quot;40 Dollars a Day&quot;. I love her show, but SNL got her good with that one.
 xugarbush-nyc 
THAT&apos;S WHY WE AS BLACK PPL NEED TO STOP SPENDING OUR $$$ ON NONSENSE,INVEST ON THINGS THAT EVENTUALLY WILL SECURE A BETTER FUTURE&amp;EDUCATE OURSELVES&amp;OUR CHILDREN ON THE VALUE OF A DOLLAR&amp;ON HOW TO SPEND OUR $$ WISELY....HOW LIL MISTAKES HERE&amp;THERE CAN AFFECT OUR FINACIAL HISTORY IN A DRASTIC MATTER!!
 HUEmanbro 
How is having high blood pressure,mucus,diabetes,strokes and all types of dis eased that come from so called soul food good?
 lani3000 
he aint lying.

Hard to admit though.
 Lakishia 
I absolutley Love Kanye, and mostly because he speaks what&apos;s on his mind! You get to know him more if you listen and don&apos;t judge so often.
I agree with his statement because alot of white people have to put&quot;herbs&quot;in their food to make it taste good lol!
 mephyme 
I remember a comic once said&quot;Ever notice at the dinner after a funneral, black people tend to eat the types of food that lead to the death of the person who died?&quot;

I can&apos;t remember who said this, but this does have some&quot;truthiness&quot;to it.
 UKNOWUAINTRIGHT 
LOL You can&apos;t help but love the black spokes people always reinforcing black and white stereotypes that blacks always get the short end of.
 BluBoy 
Donda West was an old azz black woman who should have been worried about raising Kanye the right way instead of creating an arrogant azz monster...Kanye iz annoying with all his statements regarding black people...he should just STFU...ANd Donda West caused her own death because of her arrogant vain LAZY azz like her son thinking she deserved to have a beautiful body instead of working out and eating right like the rest of us...
 PuertoRicanMami 
Kanye doesn&apos;t have to bring up race 24/7.

How about he talk about good things in life.

I like his music, but I don&apos;t like him as a person.
 MONIQUEP 
YOU KNOW WHAT HE&apos;S RIGHT. I USUALLY DISAGREE WITH MOST OF THE COMMENTS HE MAKES BUT HE IS RIGHT.

@BLUBOY HOW DARE YOU DISRESPECT HIS MOTHER AND SHE&apos;S DEAD. SHE RAISED HIM THE BEST SHE COULD AND HE&apos;S A SUCCESSFUL BLACK MAN, WHO YEAH MAKE STUPID COMMENTS SOMETIME BUT HE IS HIS OWN MAN. IM PRETTY SURE YOUR MOTHER DIDNT RAISE YOU TO SPEAK ABOUT SOMEONE DEAD PARENT IN A DISRESPECTFUL MANNER NOW DID SHE.
 w8keup 
WOW! So now having bad credit is considered BLACK associated with an ethinicity. Just when you think you heard the most ignorant thing somebody can let come out of their face... I wonder how on point would this comment be if it were Eminem that said this ppl need to think about the IMPACT of what they say before they say it b/c if this had come from a white person I&apos;m pretty sure BLACK ppl would be offended by this comment. SO think about it before you are so quick to jump on the KANYE speaks his mind and he&apos;s such an individual bandwagon. Any fool can demonstrate not thinking before speaking...
 Missmedia81 
That is so stupid.. Some black people have bad credit but so does every other race.

--------------------------
Your so vain you probably think this post is about you.
 mpdadon 
Kanye is starting to get like Bill Cosby, making black folks mad with what he&apos;s saying. I&apos;m like this, if you know it doesn&apos;t apply to you, you won&apos;t get mad. The ones who get mad, it must apply to them. He is a little off the wall with his statements sometimes, but there is some truth to them. He did point out that Bush doesn&apos;t like black people, has NO been completely rebuilt since Katrina? I think not, and now they&apos;re tearing down housing projects down there, how the hell do you tear down more sh*t and haven&apos;t rebuilt a damn thing? Kanye is like Bernie Mac, he say what you scared to say, even if it doesn&apos;t make sense, or is weird, I&apos;m with the brotha.
 SherRoyal 
HE IS SUCH A NEGROIDIAN.....I AM THE BLACK KATE MOSS...LOL,,,,MINUS THE COKE HABIT
 BluBoy 
Kanye said&quot;BUSH DOES NOT LIKE BLACK PEOPLE&quot;but from his other comments regarding MUTTS And now this comment about Black people having baf credit...ITS QUITE CLEAR THAT KANYE DOESNT LIKE BLACK PEOPLE EITHER...SO HE REALLY HATES HIMSELF
 KEKO1720 
I agree with Kanye to a degree. Not all black people have bad credit. Ya&apos;ll know we fall into that credit card trap and it takes us forever to get out. I feel into it also and it took me a year or two to get out and now I have just built my first home. Some white folks are not like us...we wanna max out every department store card so that we can dress nice then later think about it when we want to get a car or a house or something. White folks think about the house and car first. We are just now as a society getting to the point where we are teaching our children to be smart about there finance future. Strive for more than living in an apartment your whole life.
 handsomeJE 
Madamluv, you are looking good beautiful.

He damn sure is tell the Truth

PuertoRicanMami: every thing is about race in this world especially in this country so get over it! You wouldnt know because puerto ricans stick together more than blacks do so now what??
 DaRealiss 
All that Black Folk/White Folk ISH is out da window. This is the&quot;Information Age&quot;and anybody can be rich and/or have good credit regardless of their race or background. I know people of all races with good credit&amp;bad credit So KANYE GET OUT THE SLAVE MASTERS HOUSE...cus that what u actin like...A HOUSE Ni66A. Race is out da window these days BOO!!!

And with the INTERNET anyone can cook soul food...may not taste like Grandmas but anyone can get a recipe&amp;get damn near close!!!

BLACK FOLKS lets lose the SLAVE MENTATALITY!!!
 DaRealiss 
Mentality*****
 aurevoir 
Kanye is Right. Truth Hurts. Watch the enlightened people on here talk about race. Research. Statistics are not 100% accurate, but they are close. White Credit is the best. Even if a brother has a clean slate, he will never reach white man credit status unless you are in the entertainment business(Star,entertainment lawyer or the like. or, finance. Not just a clerk either.
lovemesomeirishmen. Kanye, Black people can cook. White people got money. He is right.
 DaRealiss 
SHUT THE FOCK UP @ ANTIDUMB...U Sound DUMB...What are u talking about?? LMAO!!!

true dat
but fuc/k it i got better credit rating my white bankers chasing me arnd for s super accept loan!

 MissJNS 
Well, it&apos;s one thing to say something that pretains to SOME people, but this fool says this as if he knows each and every single one of us, and our background. He didn&apos;t grow up around whites, nor did he go to school with them and observe them enough to compare them to us blacks. Unless you know every single white and black person in the world, you cannot&quot;crown&quot;any particular group of people as the,&quot;Bearers of Bad Credit&quot;or the,&quot;Bearers of Good Food&quot;etc. This all comes from a guy who stated that Bush doesn&apos;t like black people. Now I&apos;m no fan of George Bush, but emergency rescue planning within a single state should begin with the state&apos;s governor and the city mayor. The president, no matter who it is, has 50 states to run, whereas, the governor has that ONE. So his comment should have been,&quot;Kathleen Blanco and Mayor Nagin do not like black people&quot;since he wanted to go political. Sure Kanye...you say Bush hates black people, well, making comments such as,&quot;Negros have bad credit&quot;and stating it with no proof that this is how all black people are, show that you yourself don&apos;t like us either. Those die-hard Kanye fans who support this crap would be outraged at whites for saying anything remotely close to this.
 Ieshialicious 
He does have a point!
 DaRealiss 
Let me leave this damnnnnn site becuz Im feeling like Im in a time machine....What do u mean @Aurevoir??? How could u even say&quot;White credit is best?&quot;U sound like a HOUSE NEGRO too!!! LOL!!! Credit status is something that cant be denied to you bcuz of your race...if you got good credit u got good credit...aka A1 CREDIT. No one can take that from you DUMBAZZZZZ!!! People will remain clueless until they realize they too can be liberated.
 qt_pie 
Anti dumb you mean reallydumb!! Who was in the kitchens on the plantations? blacks had to cook theri food and nurse their kids, so obviously they know we know something. You must have bad credit ur self and are offended. He could have made the statement politically correct but I guess he wanted idiots like you who call people dumb and spell [EXPLETIVE] wrong to wake up and smell the [EXPLETIVE] that our society is accepting. It is a known fact that whotes love our cooking or they wouldnt have made us do all the work in this country. But thats enuff ignorance from one idiot!! My point for loggin back on was to tell everyone to read: The extermination of the black man by Akil and From [EXPLETIVE] to gods by Akil. his books are a good read and very infomative, he (Akil) has written these books for us to know ourselves and to be honest the stuff he said about us is true, nothing slanderous just something for us to think about. He discusses the plan of the white man for us and he is right as far as his predictions they all came true and are still coming true as far as what the government plans for us as a people. The book made me so mad that this is going on but then I log on here and see some many ignorant uneducated replies it makes us look stupid as hell we cant even agree that we are and have been bamboozeled. Its sad but their plan worked we cant even stick together. WE laugh when we see Mexicans riding 50 deep in a honda but they be having money and they send it home to Mexico to better their people what the hell we do go and cop and pair of shoes or something stupid then get mad when somebody steps on them cuz u spent ur rent money on some j&apos;s. idiots. REad some Maya angelou or something uplifting.
 QyteTheQT 
HE&apos;S SO IGNORANT. I&apos;M BLACK AND MY CREDIT IS NOT BAD!!!!

Sometimes he can be so profound and then he just runs with it and ends up stickin his foot down his damn throat and it comes out his ignorant azz! GO IN THE DAMN CORNER!~

SOMETIMES HES ON POINT BUT MOST THE TIME HE JUST SAYZ SOME STPIUD SH1T!!!!!
 BUTTBREATHBEYONCE 
why are some of yall so angry with ANTIDUMB?

ANYWAY,
i think its TRUE that there are ALOT of BLACKS who have BAD CREDIT,BUT hes saying like ALL BLACKS have bad credit.
I JUST HATE WHEN PEOPLE GENERALIZE,AND ITS EVEN WORSE WHEN WE DO IT 2 OURSELVES and WORSE,IN A PUBLIC FORUM(MAGAZINES,NEWSPAPERS,ETC...)

and as far as&quot;GOOD FOOD&quot;,HE CANT BE talking about SOUL FOOD,because SOUL FOOD is one of the MAIN REASON 4 THE BLACK COMMUNITIES HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,DIABETES,OBESITY,ETC...
 PhatCat74 
He needs to shut up, he&apos;s always saying something negative. Like the time he said &apos;President Bush don&apos;t like black ppl&quot;certain comments u just keep to yourself. I don&apos;t like Bush or Kenya. U make us look bad Kenya so SHUT UP! His Mother(R.I.P) was a very education woman I know she didn&apos;t accept certain things.
 shortyt 
what in the world is wrong with you people he is not telling the truth all black people don&apos;t have [EXPLETIVE] up credit that is such a stereotype that was an dumbass statement besides I know some blacks who can&apos;t cook and whites with [EXPLETIVE] up credit what he should have been doing was looking for some registered nurses that knew how to make a 911 call then his mom probably would have had a chance......
 focus 
Who knows how old that statement really is? MTO has been printing pictures from 25 years ago.

Me, myself, I know plenty of black people with great credit, nice jobs, investments, nice homes and common financial sense. Kanye must be talking about the ones who&apos;d rather drive an Escadlade instead of giving their child a great education or the ones renting furniture because they never learned financial sense to purchase it.
 gcjazz 
We now have pics? lol
 Blew 
Kanye has a God complex. Why do people even listen to anything he says.
 tnorth 
If black people have to look to an a prime A-hole like West in order to know how to act, then we have a helluva lot more problems than bad credit! How did this cretin become the new black leader? At one time we had Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, Medger Evers and Fred Shuttlesworth. But now you&apos;re telling me Kanye is the man that black people need to listen to?!? Yeah, well like I must repeat you got a helluva lot more problems than bad credit. The prolem in the Black community isn&apos;t bad credit. Its the fact that there are actually people ig&apos;nant enough to say that we need a dumbazz, smartazz rapper to tell us how to live! You should be ashamed to even dream some dumb sh1t like this! Saying that we need a damn idiot rapper to tell black people how to live is the equivilent of white people looking to Eminem, Britney or Paris Hilton to lead them. They don&apos;t look to those pathetic losers for advice, they ridicule them. But the difference between them and us is that for leaders, white people look to politicians, clergy, philosophers, educators, academics, corporate leaders, philanthropists, statesmen, their parents, grandparents, coaches, teachers, etc. But Black people, according to some here, should look to an embarrassing, pathetic, clown named Kanye to show us the way. People we are offically lost and hopeless!!! Shame!!!
 Kay718 
I love Kanye West because he keeps [EXPLETIVE] real. For all of you hating yall probably the one&apos;s with the [EXPLETIVE] up credit. Haaaaaaaaa!Step ya games up and get ya paper right. Don&apos;t get mad because it is what it is. Many black people go out and buy stupid [EXPLETIVE] instead of investing their money, or planning for their futures.
 Veet 
yup

WHY HE IS RECOVERY GOOD.
 DreDog 
Aay....I&apos;ve experienced both bad and good credit.....I will agree about the food part though (sorry if I sound biased) but when I have Thankgiving or Xmas dinner I want...

turkey and CORNBREAD dressing....not Stovetop stuffing!

I want BAKED Macaroni with 3 cheeses......not mashed potatoes.

I want greens or string beans w/cubed potatoes....not green bean casserole.

I want Gumbo!.....nuff said.

I want sweet potato pie....not PUMPKIN PIE.

I want cakes from scratch...not Betty Crocker or Duncan Hines.

So I can feel Kanye on that tip for real.

For those that have bad credit now....do your best to clean it up...it will really hurt you in the future. Good credit will give you the world.
 DreDog 
BluBoy....

Have some respect for Donda...she&apos;s dead. Kanye is a grown azz man with his own decisions. To insult her like that is really moronic.

you would think he his sorry ass would still be grieving over the sadden death of his beloved mother but instead he&apos;s now trying to get on black people&apos;s bad side, the funny thing is that the same black people his talking about is making his sorry ass rich by buying that garbage he makes up, probaly that&apos;s why according to him black people&apos;s credit is shot .one more thing he cannot speak for all black people because their are alot who has very good credit. i see he&apos;s back to his arrogant ways, he can&apos;t greive without bringing others down with him. there are many people who are not going to invest their money l .v. bag collection.

kanye&apos;s sorry ass doesn&apos;t know if white poeple really have good credit, as he claims they spend without mercy&amp;many times when their old&amp;gray they have nothing so their families throw them into a nusring home to die.

How ignorant was this, not to mention having white people think this is true,since one of our own has said it,we stereotype ourselves, but how can you say or put all black people in a bad credit class, and say that all white people have good credit, how dumb is he, and how could this be true? how could this be true when BANKRUPTCY was started for the white, also FOODSTAMPS, SECTION 8 all that was started for them not to help us, black people still brainwashed like whites are the almighty better than thou, we just learning how to go buy big house cars boats and then go bankrupt, I mean who started it? anyway i love all people but blacks need to wake up and stop trying to measure up, if you have good cred it thats&apos; good but do you have to have it so you can have white credit how dumb if you talk proper you talk white if you have a broad voc. you white like everything good stems from them. I just dont know what else to say
 classc1 
I still think that Kanye is backwards as hell in his thinking....BUT for all of you who have bad credit go to the boards at creditboards.com. It will change your life. The bottom line is that there are a few simple things that you can do to raise your credit to the 700&apos;s within a few short months. Some people just know how to do it. Seriously.
 DreDog 
Classc1....yep your right...it&apos;s so many remedies out there to fix your credit.....DO IT NOW PEOPLE!

It&apos;s the only way to get what you really want...good credit. Seriously people.
 aurevoir 
BTW.
I do not participate in that cyber barbecueing, this site is so famous for. I am not above it, I would just rather kick some as s in person is all. people take everything to heart. Kanye is trying to say to us black folks to wake up and smell whats in the air. Look what is happening to Vick(stupidity on his part), TI, and high profile wealthy athletes and entertainers. Is this coincidence? People think. While you are thinking have a little fun and lighten up. THINK.
 toosexy 
I will no longer support him or whatever he does he&apos;s an butthole
 toosexy 
@aurevoir, we can name alot of whites who are just as stupid stupidity does not come in colors,and thats what i meant by brainwashed our black people have alot to do alot of recovering and growing up to do but don&apos;t be fooled like we are the only ones with drug addicts murders dumb decision makers, it comes in all colors and we as a race can work on our short comings without comitn to the media saying the stupidest things whites don&apos;t know anything but what they have been taught about us which mostly is sterotyping the same stereotyping that kanye is doing now, and its not smart its dumb to classify and say to the races since he is a celebrity OH, I DON&apos;T WANT TO HAVE BLACK CREDIT, and its alot of WHITES too that can&apos;t pay their housing payments it&apos;s probably more of them since the goverment is stepping in!

I concede on that point. Stupidity is universal. We have to wake up and rise up. If you notice though, and I am not making this up. statistics and research point to the black man/woman as the least this, least that, if you get my drift. If we do not wake up, then we are not dispelling the lies and untruths told. We are great consumers and spend a s h itload of money and we do keep the economy going. It is the few rotten ones mess it up for everyone. On a whole, and this is fact, white people have better credit. It means we have to work hard to stop this. repair credit ratings. We need to work on . This type of stuff will never end. Fred likes to see his fellow black men/women tear themselves to shred. You believe what you believe, and I will not impose my belief on anyone. Disagreeing is universal too, and its ok to not see things my way. I am just saying we need to work harder, cause this type of stereotyping will never end. Whites do have alot more of a chance, I grabbed mine and ran.
Have a great day to all.

kanye believe&apos;s white &apos;s has better credit he should do some researching, he&apos;ll find the many whites who&apos;s credit is shot, so what happen&apos;s then their home&apos;s goes into foreclosure.

@ Keel
So speaking his mind makes Ye&apos; mentally ill?
@ Classcl
Why is what he said racist?
Everything he says is true. Many blacks don&apos;t want to admit it, but financial instutions nationwide ain&apos;t denying us because we got digits in the high 600&apos;s and above!!!!!! I wonder what is the percentage of blacks that have 650+ ficos (credit scores)? Ye&apos; wasn&apos;t speaking wreckless or anything like that. It seems that because he has said some&quot;off the cuff&quot;(yet true) statements in the past, he has been label by the media as a so called head case. I truly admire a man that has the ability to have an affect in so many peoples lives through his music and the things he says. He speaks the truth and unfortunately most don&apos;t think it is&quot;politically correct&quot;in the media&apos;s world. Well here&apos;s a news flash America, Ye&apos; says the things that most in the spotlight want to say, but are afraid to. Most celebs are so afraid that their precious pocketbooks may take a hit if they really said what was on their minds ie.... lose of endorsements or celebrity status. But, the truth of the matter is that most celebs have enough chedda&apos; in the bank to last the majority of us a lifetime. Ye&apos; don&apos;t subscribe to this theory. He even says so in Jesus Walks.......&quot;So here go my single dog radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, video tapes
But if I talk about God my record won&apos;t get played Huh?
Well let this take away from my spins
Which will probably take away from my ends
Then I hope it take away from my sins&quot;. He ain&apos;t worried about the&quot;ends&quot;so he says what is on his mind. Ye&apos; don&apos;t ever let them silence you!!!!!
 cfountain32b4 
@ anonymous (Tigger with the baloons). How bout you be as real as Ye&apos; and post the proof (credit score experian 725, equifax 710,transunion 727) next to that WHACK ASS tigger picture? No one really cares what your score is!!!!!!!!!! Surely good credit doesn&apos;t translate into having intellect. I could sit here and tell what my score isas well, but what does it mean? Nothing except you may be the exception than the normal. Notice I said EXCEPTION!!!!!!!! If you really read the message, you could have very well interpreted that Ye&apos; was not talking about all blacks. If that was the case, I would think that he would be referencing mostly everyone in the hip hop industry. Surely, all of them can&apos;t have bad credit. I got that he meant blacks were equal to the sum of their parts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 Brown_MFR 
That ni**a is right though aint he? All he doin&apos; is tellin&apos; the world what certain black and white people are afraid to say.. DONE!

 sk8key 
you all know it&apos;s true. the only reason why you idiots are mad is because MTO sensationalized the title and you lemmings fell for it. but he&apos;s still right. black people typically don&apos;t have good credit histories, which is why so many of us (you) are getting foreclosed on as we speak. I bet half of you still owe BMG and Columbia House for CD&apos;s.

@Antidumb I&apos;m sorry&quot;Produmb&quot;This is another ramblin&apos; negro who thinks because he writes a 4-page dissertation, this makes him&quot;sound&quot;intelligent. Negro pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee eeease!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. You can go on and on, but no one really knows what the f!ck you are talking about except you (talking LONG and ain&apos;t saying nothing). Negro you are the epitomy of a walking contradiction. To wit (&quot;Produmbass&quot;this means for example) you are saying that Ye&apos; is a dumb ass for stating that most blacks have bad credit. Yet your dumb ass gave a perfect example as to why this is so true (couldn&apos;t have come up with a better one myself). You said that the society is spending 57 billion to prevent a recession. Stupid society ain&apos;t contributing a dime to nobody, it&apos;s the government!!!!!!!I know you were talking about preventing foreclosures. Now stay with&quot;short bus&quot;I may lose you with this one. How in the hell do you think some (I said SOME) blacks with bad credit got there? I&apos;ll tell you how, making purchases that they anticipated they could afford, but couldn&apos;t (ie....homes). So now the creditors want their ends. But, guess what the ends don&apos;t meet. So now they got a big hit on their credit. Pretty soon, that person is now looking at those&quot;fix your credit for a fee&quot;ads. You so dumb you can&apos;t see you made the point for Ye&apos; with your mindless essay. Yeah, you a smart one alright!!!!!!!!! (ROTFLMBAO)
 missstaceytexas 
Kanye.. all black people don&apos;t have bad credit !!!!
 Slimbrotha101 
Regular white folks do not go shopping for 150 dollar sneakers and 200 dollar purses...think about it...he is on point with that one. If you got moneey spend it wisely...if ya do not...do not go spending the light bill money on Gucci.
 Lovely_One 
WOW, it is official he is so ignorant. I have an Aunt who works with people on their finances and trust me bad or good credit is equal on both sides (Black and White). I do not know why I am surprised he would say something like that.
 Lakishia 
This is a free [EXPLETIVE] country and Kanye has the right to voice his own damn OPINION without any thought as to what you people have to say!
While y&apos;all are her arguing over what he said, he&apos;s out and making more money so his credit won&apos;t be jacked up!

Stop arguing over something that&apos;s not all that much to talk about!
 m0cha 
I LUV KANYE HE SAY WHAT PEOPLE THINK AND DNT CARE IF PEOPLE LIKE IT OR NOT... THAT&apos;S CALLED BEING A INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE!!
 BUTTBREATHBEYONCE 
LMAO @the people who are saying HES RIGHT.
so hes right in saying that ALLL BLACKS HAVE BAD CREDIT?

so im 2 believe that WE ALL HAVE BAD CREDIT?
NO!
so why SHOULDNT the ones without BAD CREDIT NOT get upset.
i dont have BAD CREDIT and im sure ALOT of people on here DONT HAVE BAD CREDIT.

but if a FREE COUNTRY,so i guess that means its OKAY 2 GENERALIZE HUH?
FREE SPEECH,PUT EVERYONE IN THE SAME CATEGORY.
STEREOTYPE.

and i also guess that since its a&quot;FREE M0THERFVCKING COUNTRY&quot;IMUS has the right to voice his own damn OPINION without any thought as to what you people have to say!

RIDICULOUS!!!!!!
 m0cha 
its not that serious.. get a life

hey since its a FREE COUNTRY,how about i say:ALL ARABS BOMB PLANES(even though thats not true)

Black people - GOOD FOOD. White people - GOOD CREDIT..hmmmmmmm. Let make lemonade out of this lemon of a comment.

Why don&apos;t a black person who cooks good get together with one of their white friends with good credit and open a restaurant.

It makes a ton of money and everybody is happy and richer.
 AyeVoe 
Kanye dats a true comment boi!
 interesting 
Kanye, Kanye.

Grieve for you mom, but she should have taught you to not make these stereotypes. Especially when you have songs like Golddigger, Can&apos;t Tell Me Nothing, and The Goodlife where you brag about spending money on a necklace before you have the money to buy it. Fool. Your isms are helping perpetuate the myth that blacks don&apos;t have good credit. If you actually talk about good financial advice in your songs instead of nonsense, you would understand that what you say is not&quot;thinking black&quot;but&quot;thinking ignorant.&quot;I guess 50 cent has something over you, he knows how to get money and invest it to make more money then your ignorant a**.
 trinigyal05 
@ jyh:
shoot, i caint cook but I&apos;m all about my money, so count me in!
 interesting 
Hey,

Don&apos;t Kanye remind you of the late Reggie White with these what black people are good at and what white people are good at? Kanye needs to sit down somewhere for real.
 syreetajcobb 
He is right!! Mr West at his Best.If you us numbers he is right. I work with everybodies credit everyday and trust u me alot of us got messed up credit I witness it everyday at work But if you are offended by the comment then you must have bad credit. Damn shut up it is just a comment that obviously most of us agree with. Yeah you should not stereotype but we do it everyday if u dont do it its being done to you Merry Christmas MTO READERS.!!!

 interesting 
To SyreetaJCobb (like the first name since it is mine)

Yeah but there is a difference between someone stating it from a Census Study and a Negro (like Kanye) who probably doesn&apos;t look at statistics before he runs his mouth and makes characterizations. Kanye does not speak for all black people. Like caucasians, blacks are different. Some live like the Huxtables and some do not. But, sound financial advice like having CASH before you spend on a knecklace you can&apos;t afford for some Negro who is impressed on bling is STUPID. Ignorant and not black, but just a DUMB A** PERSON who can&apos;t make money appreciate.
 SWAGGER_JACKER 
syreetajcobb,youR name should be syreetajCURB.

@TooSexy, soooooo very true! When ever black catch to a way of getting ahead, they shut it down. Like the bankrupcy, white been buying bi ticket items and filing for years, then when we caught on, now procedures for filing are more stringent.

Kanye does not speak for all of us! He has become Bill Cosby in an argyle!

 SisterCEO 
Kanye ain&apos;t lied a bit. I do not include myself in this comment but most black people are more concerned with getting their nails, feet and hair done all while paying a car note on a BMW and still living at home with their mothers. Damn that! Get a life for 08&quot;. Go back to college, save for a home, GET A DAMN GRIP ON YOUR LIFE !! BLACK PEOPLE IT IS TOO SHORT! ONE!
 VENOM 
TRUE AND FALSE.
 aintthatthetruth 
Well I tell you what to say he talking crazy or not I cant tell but I know that I dont want my credit to look like 4 or five broke ass people on a shopping spree...
 pinkpussycat 
I don&apos;t know what garbage he is speaking about in his new ramble, because just like not all black people can cook, not all white people have good credit. Kanye is just an attention whore NEXXXXXXXT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 leachia 
kayne stuck in a black and white world...
 CubanGal 
His comment was very ignorant.

Why did he not add that plastic surgery is a&quot;white&quot;thing and that wearing makeup or a girdle to fix what we think is a physical beauty flaw is a&quot;black thing&quot;.&quot;Oops...did I say that?&quot;

Additionally, most of the people on here that agreed with his comment have horrible grammar. Go figure...
 cremesaver 
Trust closed minded ppl to always see the NEGATIVE first and foremost. WHERE in the article does it quote the man saying ALL BLACKS HAVE BAD CREDIT???? He weighed one race against the other in ref to certain aspects of life. Free your minds.
 1MoreThing 
He speaks the truth about credit.

But see we get caught up in the game:

1. If your limit is $500 and you charge over $251 on your card --- your score will drop 50-80 points.
What we do...is make the minimum payment every month. AND THE SYSTEM on CREDIT CARDS IS DESIGNED FOR THEM TO BE PAID OFF every month.
NOT carry a balance.

That&apos;s how you get your credit score higher. White Folks know this!

2. The secured credit cards are a trap. 
They claim they will help you clean up your credit. But all they do is play the money game with us---- what game? Your payment is due on 12/22. But they don&apos;t tell you it&apos;s at 9:00 AM on 12/22. The mail from the postal facility does not arrive to the payment processing center til Noon. So you are already late. 
Your minimum payment --- ends up paying the late fee...then they say you didn&apos;t pay your payment.
WHITE FOLKS KNOW THIS TOO they pay the payment 5 days before it&apos;s due.

3. UNIVERSAL DEFAULT:
What&apos;s this....Well that credit card you have - the interest rate when you first got it is 9%. But because you were late on another bill - phone bill or another credit card. Your interest rate jumps up to 18%--- yeah, you weren&apos;t on this card, your were late on another one. Well that makes all of your credit cards in default...Universal Default.

White Folks Know this....that is why THEY DO NOT CARRY A BALANCE ON THEIR CARDS.

He cant speak for the entire black race, cos where there tons of poor blacks with mess up credit there are also tons of black people with great credit, blacks that own property and businesses. but blacks do got some good food though ha
 LMadden1968 
THIS IS ONE BLACK MAN, THAT SAYS WHATS ON HIS MIND. HE&apos;S SORT OF LIKE A BLACK EMINEM, BUT NOT WACK OR WHITE.-C
 jane 
DONT BE...so quick to judge the man. he tells it like it is..he is not talkin about all black people, rich black folks, dont need GOOD CREDIT.. YOU WILL STILL HAVE A BIG HOUSE , NICE CAR, AND EXPENSIVE CLOTHES...
SO THE POINT IS. when your an average working black or white.. 
you could still be unhappy with lopster and cavier!!! kenya is tryn to say... he got bad credit, but HAVE LOTS OF MONEY.. AND FOR HIM ..FRIED chicken, honey, waffles, greens, pigfeet, chitlins.. is the business.
LIKE BEYONCE AND THAT POPEYES CHICKEN., 
YOU KNOW SHE CAN EAT ABOUT 6 PIECES FOR REAL..
BUT KENYA IS RIGHT .. HEALTH RISK OR NOT WE LOVE OUR SOUL FOOD... F***K CREDIT PROBLEMS!!!!

kanye must almost be out of mourning to make that statement.
 shbradle 
To me this comment is just as bad as Imus comments! To me its so ignorant to say that, there is not such thing as black credit and white credit...it goes back to saying good hair vs bad hair!! whack! sounds like some self hate, cause I know plenty of white people that have filed for bankruptcy and/or credit card debt in the 100,000&apos;s! so did they have black credit? NO, just bad credit! Since this is an issue with him, he should do something about it, don&apos;t go adopting a baby from another country, fix this one...black people credit problems extend from lack of education and creditors preying on unacknowledgeable people, u know give them credit but the worst possible (high interest rate, annual fee, etc)...This is why i&apos;m trying to get Life skills apart of the DCPS, its very necessary to get this knowledge out there!

To me Kanye just speaks out of pocket! he doesn&apos;t realize the impact on his statements, you would think someone with that much pull would actually do something wit it instead of making everyone think dressing like a gump is hot!
 strwby_cheesecake 
Funny... bit true... We can hate what he is saying, however, it&apos;s so true. Why do we get mad when our dirtu laundry is aired. The best way to fix it is to better your credit if it&apos;s bad and/or maintain good credit if you have it.
 Blagerm 
Kanye is wack anyway! Take away the fly beats and you have garbage lyrics.
 bkyouth 
lmao @ysn514 [EXPLETIVE] callin ya&apos;ll out!...its a bit of truth there, but if u were to really get analytical then u&apos;d realize that by ratio of population to person, white ppl have worst credit because of the amount of them compared to the amount of us....good to see that Kanye is going back to being a arrogant bastard...for once i&apos;m happy that he&apos;s recovering...don&apos;t know how much more of him i can stomach in 08&apos; though...

Kanye dont say stuff like that...There are plenty of Black folks with excellent credit. I think he sets folks back a couple steps with statements like that. He need to speak for himself...Credit is what you make of it. We all started with the same type of credit..If you mess it up thats on you. And thats all RACES&gt;&gt;
 classc1 
CFountain--Kanye&apos;s comment is ignorant and racist. It perpetuates a sterotype that is just not true. Do you realize that this is a stereotype that whites use to prevent us from getting credit and loans? Although it is illegal, lenders find ways to mark our applications for loans with our race. Many, many studies have been done where white and black applicants with the SAME FICO scores apply for homes, credit etc, but blacks are wrongfully denied. When someone like Kanye says some ignorant crap like this, it sets all of us back.

Also, I do not think that some of you realize how white people set their children up to have good credit. It is very easy...one method they use is to simply make them authorized users on their credit cards that report on their childs credit report and just like THAT, this same kid winds up adopting the credit for whatever card/cards his or her parent has made him or her an authorized user. That&apos;s why you see 20 and 21 year old white kids owning property and such. That same kid, ner having held a job, never having paid a bill, will have a FICO of 700+. Want to give your teenage brother, cousin etc a real Xmas gift... make them an authorized user on a credit card that you have a perfect credit history on and whose balance is less than 1/3 of the max. That&apos;s just ONE example. We as a people have got to wake up. You can&apos;t do crap with bad credit. This backwards thinking that somehow we as a people are doomed to a life of bad credit is just nonsense. Educate yourselves...don&apos;t pay a service, start reading and ignore ignorant comments like Kanye&apos;s.

Now why would he make a stoopid statement like that? I have good credit AND good food and I am definitely a sistah. I don&apos;t believe that he would say such a thing....at least I don&apos;t want to believe it. SMH

And @ antidumb, once again, how is belittling your black brothers and sisters going to help advance the race? You just wasted a whole post calling people dumb like that&apos;s going to help someone. If you think black people are so ignorant, why don&apos;t you teach a financial education course at your local community center instead of blasting folks on the internet? (And for someone who hates the n-word so much, why do you use it all the time?)
 chocoshake 
antidumb I love your comments.......

I feel that Kanye has good intentions but he doesn&apos;t know how to express himself intellectually. Like I wouldn&apos;t make a comment like that without backing it up with some numbers and facts.

Some white people have bad credit, but its also easier for them to go a bank and get approve for a loan with that bad credit.

For blacks, you just stuck. So stop charging shyt on your credit cards and saying&quot;oh I&apos;ll pay it back when I get my next check&quot;It doesnt work. Trust me. I have been there.
 Afro_puff_Queen 
1MoreThing- thanks for giving us tools for improvement. When I bought my house I paid off all credit cards. Then I was told I had to maintain at least one - I didnt have enough credit!! ????? so I got a credit card from my bank- use it for gas and groceries and pay the balance off every two weeks when get paid. My credit score went up in two months.
 kilahbug 
I love Kanye because he speaks the truth. He said what many people think but dont have the courage to say . Go Kanye keep doing yo thang!lol

Not all black people have bad credit!! There are black people that can&apos;t cook but can pay their bills on time, save their money and drive you go I go bullshit cars with a Bank full of money that is thicker then 100 deck of cards..

NO I am not Co-signing on that!!! [EXPLETIVE] out of here!! I am 27, driving a nice new Mercedes, living in a Condo in Bergen county!! Ooooh, how did I obtained all of that???? WITH GOOD CREDIT OKAY!!!! He can not speak for all black people!! [EXPLETIVE] he probably doesn&apos;t have Health Insurance and badd ass credit!! Just because you have money does not make your credit good!! You can have money but still does not pay your bills on time in which brings your score down everytime your late and it get&apos;s reported to all three credit reporting agencies and stays on ther for 11 yrsw go let&apos;s get that straight!!!!
 universalbliss 
i already commented on this on another blog earlier this week... mto is late again...but i will say it again, some people that hate to hear the truth will be the first one that crying about he is perpetuating a stereotype but all you have to do is look at the numbers... many black people are still very uneducated when it comes to having and maintaining good credit or even the finance industry in general. wake up.

 wizegirl84 
this is where my problem lies with kanye west. i want to like him, but he speaks faster than he thinks and I have a problem with that. his mother was (RIP) was a English Professor and I was a English major going to pursue my MA and soon Phd and we are taught to think before we write to make sure that everything we mean is on the paper. Kanye West speaks without thinking and I am sure he doesn&apos;t mean to come off as a bigot, but unfortunately, I think he does. Don&apos;t be stupid-not all black people cook great food, not all black people have bad credit. When you make these false accusations and assume not only do you seem stupid but also ignorant. I don&apos;t want him representing me. He speaks the truth? Whose truth exactly does he speak? 
i dont know who anti dumb is, but i agree with his statements because he/she sounds educated. when you&apos;re singing songs saying ni99a this and that and have hispanic people using it, what are our ancestors thinking about us?
Oh, thats right, too many of us (black people) look for today and tomorrow and not towards the future. that&apos;s why the Jews have everything and we (you, yes you) work for them.

wake up, speak for yourself and get educated. 
also, please, someone for the love of God learn to spell!

WOW! Maybe I need to get on TV and say something that&apos;s the epitome of ignorant, stereotypical, racist, sexist, hypocrital, controversial,etc....so I can be labeled a legend and a genius by many? Is this really what it boils down to no standards. Now when somebody says something ignorant ppl glorify them for Kanye is wrong for saying that&quot;BLACK CREDIT&quot;so black credit is bad credit he doesn&apos;t want his credit to look BLACK when he goes to buy a house. What is even more disgraceful is that there are ppl on here that see nothing wrong with what he said and even argue that it is true. WOW! ppl all I have to say is when IMUS or anybody else wants to say something ignorant about BLACK ppl don&apos;t get mad and don&apos;t call ALVIN HOLMES to start a march b/c it starts with self......if you degrade and disrespect yourself don&apos;t expect anybody else to respect you....

 peewee 
I love Kanye because he says what alot of people think but is scared to say. Which is the truth! No duhhhh NOT ALL BLACK PEOPLE HAVE BAD CREDIT BUT A MAJORITY OF US PROBABLY DO!!! And no duhhh not all white people food is nasty but majority of theirs are!!! So for you people calling Kanye ignorant sound stupid yourselves!!! He from the southside of Chicago so trust me he has dealt with Blacks! And now since he is a rich and famous pop/rap icon he is most likely dealing with alot of Whites!Therefore since he know and dealt with both races he can make a general sttement about them. So for you idiots who think he is taliking about every single person in each race are stupid and close-minded! Oh yeah white comedians always talk about Black and White stereotypes and we dont get offended because for the most part it be true
 w8keup 
PeeWee

KANYE is on an elevated level and with that comes a responsibility. It is not okay to make such statements that IMPACT in a negative way. It does not matter what his INTENT might have been when there is a NEGATIVE IMPACT. Do you know that there are jobs you can not get b/c of bad credit. OR&quot;BLACK CREDIT&quot;as Kanye called it associated with Black ppl. SO is it okay to just not even interview BLACKS that might apply for a job at the BANK b/c BLACKS are known to have&quot;BLACK CREDIT&quot;right. I&apos;m just saying if you agree with the statement and promote it just be prepared to go along with IMPACT as a result of somebody speaking nationally without a governing their mouth....
 funkytown 
Oh my goodness! I hate to say it but that is so true. He is so right. And by the way, we&apos;ll never progress if we dont ever face the truth about outselves. The only way we can make improvements is to admit some things and change it. Deny, Deny, Deny is our middle name. Kanye, thanks for being honest. Some of us prefer people who keep it real, whether we like to hear it or not.

Kanye is speaking the truth..sorry, thats the way it is..sounds harsh, but hes right..I agree with funkytown..until we are willing to accept certain truths about our people, we&apos;re never going to be strong enough to face these problems and tackle them..instead of getting defensive and offended, think about your credit, your mommas credit, your daddys and your aunties credit..is it good? and its due to many reasons..not having the proper knowledge and guidance on knowing how to spend money..when we&apos;re used to struggling and just getting by, and a credit card with a $10,000 limit is waved at us, we act a fool..we&apos;re not trust fund babies, we dont have rich relatives that pay for our education, we dont have parents that have good credit to co-sign loans for us..we begin out adult life in debt and never recover..we need to recognize and be better with out finances for our sake and for our childrens sake! I normally dont agree with Kanyes crazy talk, but hes on the money with this one

He also has an educational foundation to help inner-city kids...ok and has uplifting music..

We also don&apos;t know the context of a media sound bite so why we always getting&quot;butt-hurt&quot;and bent outta shape when somebody speaks about blacks???

 1MoreThing 
I am a Chief Credit Strategist for a local Company here in Atlanta. I&apos;m paid to help people clean up their credit. Here is some free information that many people do not know:

**The reason why everyone can&apos;t get out of the hole or even refinance is because credit card companies have created an environment where you never get out of debt. No MATTER WHAT YOU DO. This is part of why you can t refinance your homes and your score always stays low.**

Your credit score drops 50-80 points as soon as you charge more than 50% of whatever your limit is. If your limit is $500 and you spend $251 --- your score has dropped at least by 50-80 points.

Those SECURED CREDIT cards that claim to help you clean up your credit are the worst. They give you a $200 limit but by the time the card arrives in the mail the fees (annual fee, service fee) have already charged up on the card to $175. 
Your score has already tanked before you get the card out of the mail box.

Stay away from CAPITAL ONE CREDIT CARDS--- THEY DO THE MOST DAMAGE ON TO YOUR CREDIT - even when you pay on time.
(not enough room to tell you why. Google: Capital One Lawsuits)

**People do pay on time: But since they make enormous amounts of money off of the fees. They play games with your payment to make you intentionally late.
You send your payment in by the DATE IT IS DUE. (say 12/22)But the game is -- your payment is DUE at 9:00 AM on 12/22.
The processing center does not get mail until until 1:00 PM.
So, it&apos;s designed for you to get that $29 late fee.**

*WE pay the minimum payment and the minimum payment is always less than the fee. All money goes to late fees first - if you send in $25, your late fee is $29. you are still in the hole -$4.00 --- you will always be behind. The computer will show the received money - but it get&apos;s posted to the late fee not your balance.*

**BIGGEST GAME OF ALL is UNIVERSAL DEFAULT**
The credit card companies have created a game with your interest rate it WILL NEVER be LOW - YOU NEVER KNOW HOW MUCH YOU ARE PAYING FOR ANYTHING.

YOUR CARD IS DESIGNED TO BE PAID OFF EVERY MONTH. NOT TO CARRY A BALANCE. The interest used to be tax deductable - but congress took away the ability to deduct interest on consumer loans in the early 80&apos;s. WHY carry a balance if you can&apos;t deduct the interest?

So, the CREDIT CARD Company&apos;s have come up with another GAME with your interest RATES -

If you are late with your payment on ANYTHING - another card, your car loan, your mortgage payment, your light bill. ANYTHING.
They deem you a credit risk and with a 2 week notice - change your interest rate. The card you had with a 7% interest rate, now goes to 18%. Poof! You can pay your credit cards on time but if you are ever late on anything- your interest rate will jump, and there is no cap on the interest rate. It can go up to 33% 38% 40%. People never look - they just send in the minimum payment.

THOSE 0% interest rates are designed NOT to stay that way.
The credit card company&apos;s have computer programs algorithms and predictive analysis.
They know that 4 things will happen in everyone&apos;s life:

1. Job Loss - Layoff
2. Medical Illness
3. Divorce- Marital Issues
4. Death

As these things occur in your life they know that it will impact your finances - as soon as you are late paying ANY BILL.
YOUR interest rates on your cards go up. 0% today, can go to 38% at any point in time. AND IT HAPPENS EVERYDAY.

WE are too busy watching BRITNEY SPEARS and PARIS HILTON - to pay attention to what is going on in CONGRESS and the CREDIT CARD LOBBYIST.

**UNIVERSAL DEFAULT IS WHY WE NEVER CAN GET OUT OF DEBT.
DESIGNED By THE CREDIT CARD COMPANY&apos;S TO MAKE SURE WE NEVER GET OUT OF DEBT. GOOGLE: UNIVERSAL DEFAULT.**

**Do not carry a balance ---pay your cards down - not off.
DO NOT CLOSE YOUR ACCOUNT --- YOUR SCORE WILL DROP
(another game)
PAY ALL CARDS DOWN TO $10**

The Credit Card Company&apos;s are strong lobbyist, when ever they try to get rid of Universal Default. The Congress - backs down.

There are many reasons why - we can not get out of credit card debt. The items I listed above are parts of the reason why.

Use this link to find out how long it will take to pay your cards off/down:

Remember, this is defined to for you NEVER to GET OUT OF DEBT. [link to external website removed]
