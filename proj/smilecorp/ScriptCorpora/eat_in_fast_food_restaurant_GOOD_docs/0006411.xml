good cheap mexican food - fast delivery
 
menu was a little different than on menupages (no combos), but fast delivery and my steak burrito was very good for $6. large portions. burrito was heavy on the rice and beans but not so much steak. delivery took less than 20 minutes from my call.

best fast food mexican in nyc!
 
This place has the best fast mexican food ever! It&apos;s SO cheap, and delivery is incredibly quick. 20 minutes after i place my order, they&apos;re already here. Try the steak nachos -- they&apos;re the best! And for $5, you really can&apos;t beat the price. It&apos;s simple, fast and cheap. What more could you ask for?

The food is so delicious and unique!
 
I love this place. I&apos;ve been going there for years! My favorites are the chicken quesadilla, gaucamole nachos, and Chicken tostada salad. Their meals are cheap, really fast, and delicious! The cashiers are very nice too. And they deliver in like 20-25 minutes.

I don&apos;t really enjoy the food
 
I&apos;m sorry to say that I don&apos;t really enjoy the food. I ordered chicken fajita&amp;Guacamole. The chicken was so over grilled and dried. I almost thrown away every pieces of chicken in my order. They probably precooked the chicken and reheated while you place an order. I felt thirsty after the food. MSG must added in.

Had to throw it in the garbage.
 
Ordered delivery from this place after reading the good reviews. The chicken taco didn&apos;t have much taste, but was fine for a couple bucks. I couldn&apos;t take more than a few bites of the chili enchilada platter and had to throw it away. I&apos;ve never had to throw out a dinner before. It was simply not edible.
