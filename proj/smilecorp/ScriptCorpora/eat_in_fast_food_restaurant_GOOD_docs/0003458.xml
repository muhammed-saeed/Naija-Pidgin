San-Francisco-style plastic bag ban becoming a national fad
 
posted at 3:05 pm on March 29, 2012 by Tina Korbe
 
It seems like such a small issue, hardly one to warrant an outraged reaction. After all, if a city or state chooses to implement a plastic bag ban and residents don’t like it, residents are free to move, right? That’s true—but, as more states consider a ban on the easily recyclable grocery store staples, the topic seems worth a post. As Ronald Reagan once said,“The first duty of government is to protect the people, not run their lives.”Shouldn’t that go for local and state governments, as well?

In her eye-opening defense of Romneycare, Ann Coulter once argued that state-level governments are authorized by the Constitution to essentially compel citizens to do whatever, whenever, wherever. Even if that’s true, does it follow that they should ? The perils of government intervention might be less at the local or state level, but they’re still there. Consider these bag bans. They might actually have the opposite of their intended effect—and they cost manufacturing jobs to boot. From Breitbart :
 
The nanny state fad, which notched an important victory late last year in Seattle , is predicated on the notion that plastic bags are irresponsibly produced and rarely recycled. Yet neither warped argument is grounded in reality.

“ Moving consumers away from plastic bags only pushes people to less environmentally friendly options such as paper bags , which require more energy to produce and transport, and reusable bags, which are not recyclable,”the vice president of sustainability and environmental policy for Hilex Poly, the company who launched the Bag the Ban group, told the New York Times of the Seattle ban.

An analysis by the United Kingdom’s Environment Agency revealed in 2006 that plastic bags have a lighter environmental footprint than paper alternatives .

American plastic bags, which represent a majority of those in circulation in American markets, are overwhelmingly the product of natural gas, not oil. 85 percent of the raw material used for the bags are the products of natural gas. And, according to figures by the Environmental Protection Agency, plastic bag recycling has doubled in the last 9 years . 900 million pounds of bags were recycled in 2010 alone.
 
Again, plastic bags actually have a lighter environmental footprint than paper alternatives. So, what? Should we just stop trying at any level to improve society through government? Er, maybe. Government exists to ensure order; it doesn’t exist to solve every societal ill. It’s a referee, not a coach. The sooner we get back to that mentality—again, at every level of government—the better.

I live in San Jose, CA where they banned all disposable paper and plastic bags (except for fast food/take-out—why that exception??). This ban was passed despite almost ZERO public support or demand, the city bureaucrats simply went through the motions of“public input”as a check-box exercise and passed it because (as one city worker said) they wanted to“save the planet, one bag at a time) supported by the Green lobby.

In public testimony they could not answer any substantive question:

Q: Why all bags? How come you won’t allow bio-plastic bags since they bio-degrade and MILLIONS have been spent on R&amp;D and production to meet your earlier stated goals of getting bags that bio-degrade into use to reduce the impact on landfills and the environment.

A: All disposable bags are now officially bad, including the formerly“good”bio-degradeable bags.

Q: Your focus is on grocery bags, but does the ban apply to all bags of all sizes?

A: Yes, except for prepared food bags, like from a restaurant or fast food restaurant.

Q: What about bags of varying sizes, and over-sized bags for clothes, books, electronic goods and other items? Are you going to force me to walk out of Macy’s with a huge bundle of clothes getting soaked by rain, or wander out of Best Buy with an expensive laptop box the whole world can see, causing a personal safety issue?

A: Oh, we hadn’t thought of that.

Q: Have you studied the impact on sales to retail stores? Bags were originally given out “for free” by shops in order to encourage buying – if the customer didn’t have a bag for that extra item the store would “give” you one to facilitate that purchase. Many people make impulse buys, which is why store products are *carefully* positioned. Now that the customer can only fill up the bag they bring, or pay extra for a new one, this will depress sales. Have you calculated that?

A: No, we hadn’t thought if that.

Q: There are companies that make their living, and provide jobs for lots of people, making and distributing bags. In the Bay Area alone there are dozens of companies like that, just do a google search to find them. They employ truck drivers, loading dock and warehouse workers, admin staff and sales people. Most of these people will lose their jobs if their companies can no longer distribute bags. If you allowed biodegradable bags it’s more likely that the distribution system would adapt without going under.

A: Oh, we hadn’t thought of that.

Q: Have you considered the impact on forest management and the timber/wood pulp products industry if you get your way and get all paper bags banned across the State (Their ultimate goal is nationwide, of course)? Thousands of jobs depend upon the management of commercial forests, planting, managing and harvesting trees for wood pulp production. What happens if this important piece of their business gets banned? Have you estimated how many jobs Statewide will be lost?

A: No, we hadn’t thought of that – but we will be saving millions of trees that would otherwise be cut down to make paper bags.

Q: But those trees are grown *specifically* for commercial purposes, and the companies that own that land have a vested interest in maintaining a healthy commercial forest. If they don’t need to anymore, what happens to that land, those trees? They may get logged-off to the maximum allowable and never replanted.

A: Oh, we hadn’t thought of that. The State could maybe buy that land…

Q: What about the safety impact of reusable bags? These bags, over time, may build up deposits inside that include dangerous bacteria like e-coli and salmonella caused by leaking meat items, eggs and so on. Have you examined this?

A: We think people will regularly wash their bags, so this shouldn’t be a problem

Q: How will you deal with“reusable”bags ending up in the landfill and creeks, clogging up sewer grates when people throw them away or lose them?

A: Why would that happen? These are reuseable bags, nobody with throw them away.

I kid you not, they had done ZERO examination of a variety of economic and safety issues regarding reuseable bags…and now the City of San Jose and the County of Santa Clara have FULL TIME STAFF dedicated to monitoring and enforcing this bag ban…

I’ve spoken with some retail store managers since the ban, and they report sales reductions over and above the economy—especially last minute items. People are entering the store with their re-useable bags, and buy just enough to fill them and no more. They wish now they’d been active in opposing this bag ban.

So if you can, if your city is considering it—ACT!! Block it, rally local business and public support and keep the ban away from your town!!

Your article cites a single beach on the Big Island. That island has at least 2 dozen other beaches, but none of them have been impacted.

And why are you linking to a 3 year old story? Run out of fresher Propaganda?
 
I didn’t realize that you were an expert on Pacific marine biology or the ocean trash on the islands of Hawaii. Are you trying to say there’s no evidence of trash washing up on other beaches on the big island or on more remote islands?

Eat s*&amp;^ flat earth no growth Luddite eco-marxist. You bag plastic bags, I’ll buy the bulk discount 2 galleon garbage bags at Sam’s club, and bag my crap in them just so I can get the satisfaction of knowing that I am personally erasing your precious sacrifice to manu-manu the earth god.

In fact, given how much shopping my wife does to feed the hands, I’d likely be erasing the“contribution”of 10 or more of you 13th century throwbacks.

Nothing you can do about it either, that’s the sweet part.

SilverDeth on March 29, 2012 at 5:50 PM 
 
The bag is usually a tiny proportion of the plastic that each shopper takes out of the shop.

If the goal is to reduce plastic entering the soil and water, then polyester clothing and drink bottles would be a far more worthy targets.

Here’s my take on this issue.

My sister is a total enviro-wacko freak…organics, fiber grocery bags, the whole nine yards. She had to ask my mom what she uses for trash bags in small waste containers, such as those in the bathroom. My mom, ever the practical one, told her that she reuses the plastic bags she gets from the grocery store (I use them too). Since my sister doesn’t support the use of plastic bags in grocery stores, she is stuck buying separate plastic bags like Glad or Hefty, which imposes a further environmental impact due to the separate manufacturing, transportation, and packaging than that of the store bags. Not to mention the additional environmental impact of the manufacture of those fiber bags she uses all the time.

She has good intentions, but a really short-sighted way of looking at things. These bag bans are exactly the same thing.

James on March 29, 2012 at 6:17 PM 
 
Blank-ity-Blank Montgomery County charges a five cent tax for every single bag any retail business makes available to it’s customers.
That includes those little Subway tube-bags.

bayam on March 29, 2012 at 5:50 PM
 
Fixed.

First of all, I have actually lived in Hawai’i, so am partially speaking from personal experience, and I still go back there from time to time to visit the many friends I have who still live there.

As I said originally, Hawai’i is the most remote island mass in the world. There are single individual islands that might be more remote, but none with as many islands that far from other land. Even your own link calls Midway island“ one of the most remote islands, not the most remote island.

If you knew anything at all about Hawai’i, you would know that for centuries, the residents of those islands used many of the beaches as open garbage pits. In addition, for centuries all of the ships at sea simply dumped all of their garbage (and their human waste) overboard into the ocean.

Ever heard of“beach glass”? That’s glass that’s washed ashore onto beaches that has then by time and the elements been ground down into rounded pieces. Most of that beach glass came from those ships throughout the centuries.

But on the Hawaiian island of Kaua’i, one of the top 10 Beach Glass beaches in the world is in an industrialized area. It’s one of those open garbage pits I mentioned earlier.

BTW, the baby-faced“expert”in your link is just angling for more donations from the Filthy Rich Leftists who support his Coalition. I see he even counts Wavy Gravy as a supporter.

Getting back to Kamilo Beach on the Big Island. The vast majority of the plastic on that beach is fishing-related. Which is no surprise, as the Big Island is the ocean fishing mecca of the 50th State.

And some of that plastic is also from aquaculture. And there are at least 30 aquaculture operations on the Big Island alone.

The reason other beaches in Hawai’i have not seen the same plastic is simple: geography. Kamilo Beach is right near South Point, which is the southermost tip of the Big Island (and also the southernmost point in the United States.)

Need another shovel?

Why yes, yes they did say that.

And by the way, why are we even still alive? I remember being a teenager back in the late 1980s and Sting and all of his lefty buddies were always pissing and moaning about the Brazilian rain forest and how it was disappearing. They said the burn rate meant that the forest would be gone in less than ten years and that would cause the atmosphere to vanish and thus expose all of us to massive doses of radiation.

Libs always know best. Because they do something a certain way we are all supposed to do the same. In my household the plastic bags come in handy and are used not only to haul the groceries home but as trash liners etc.
They have recycling bins at the markets here in CA but that is still not enough. I detest libs more every day.

arnold ziffel on March 29, 2012 at 7:02 PM 
 
By all means, lets force everyone to use re-usable bags–so they can carry around the salmonella, e coli, and every other nasty thing living and breeding in it since the last few times they went to the store and bought meat, produce, etc.

This will certainly do wonders for the stock of companies that make the anti-bacterial handwash and disposable wipes though–until the nannies step in to ban those too, or something…

Damn liberals- you were perfectly happy with your manual typewriter when you could commit all your brilliant scientific insights to paper without intertubes getting in the way.
 
As I said originally, Hawai’i is the most remote island mass in the world…. Even your own link calls Midway island “one of the most remote islands, not the most remote island.
 
No one said it is, why do you keep repeating yourself? Hawaii is one of many examples.

Throw-away plastic hasn’t existed for centuries and glass is non-toxic. You’re as much an expert on Hawaii marine biology as Sarah Palin is on Russian foreign policy.

Tell someone who lives in a windy city (like me) that plastic bags have a small footprint. I am nowhere near a convenience or grocery store, yet plastic bags constantly blow onto my land. They are a plague.

I am a conservative, and I support local efforts to ban plastic bags.

 WannabeAnglican on March 29, 2012 at 10:53 PM 
 
I have a huge stockpile of plastic bags in my downstairs bathroom closet that I use for the several smaller wastebaskets in our house. Sometimes, when the bundle gets too big for the closet, I take them to our local grocery, where there’s a recycling receptacle for them. When I… ahem …remember, that is. If I’m in a particularly disgusted cleaning jag, I’ve been known to forgo the trip to the store and throw them in with the rest of the garbage. I always found it curious our city doesn’t recycle plastic soda bottles and the like, so they go directly in the trash. And for some reason, it insists that residents bring bundles of newspapers or old phone books to the city garage, where there’s a paper recycling bin. Guess how often that happens at my house…

Oh, and we also have a burning ban, which I understand in some ways; there have already been a few arsons here and there of abandoned properties. But the town next door allows burning two days per week, in an“approved”receptacle, of course. I’d just like to be able to create a bonfire with the plethora of junk mail I get instead of going through the tedium of running everything through a shredder.

Fixed it for you ya backwards troglodyte. Your religion is a sham, and you are worthy of nothing more than derision–liberals by definition can never inhabit the moral high ground, and the only proper response to a gutter-rat like you, feasting off the corpse of this nation, is to step down on your skull, and apply pressure till it splits.

Got it vermin? You won’t be debated. You will be abused, because your every position, your every argument, is disingenuous on it’s face, and rules and decorum for slime are nothing more than stalling tactics and delaying actions employed until your kind has gained enough power to bring out the long knives and usher in the next dark age.

No more. You will be stopped.

As was stated by Crown–You are not my countrymen; you are an animal who happens to walk upright and make noises that approximates speech. You are below human in my eyes, and you can take your garbage junk science, your quality of life destroying farce of a religion, and go strait to hell with them–and we will celebrate your having taken up residency there.

Decorum and debate with someone like you is wasted. Perls tossed before swine, as you are both too stupid, too disingenuous, and too belligerent to be argued with. Worse, if appeased, or given even the slightest leeway, your ilk will usher in a hell that will rival North Korea–all for our own good of course–no animal–you are a disease to be stamped out, a hyena picked at the leavings of lions. You will be treated in a manner exactly as you deserve, and any attempts at playing the wounded killdeer or appealing to your inner virtue will be brushed aside as the complete farce that they are.

Got that you sloped forehead throwback?

Good.

Ok I shop at a store chain called Save a Lot. They do not give you bags of any kind. They give you a choice. Buy a plastic bag for $.02/each, buy a bag that can be reused for $1.00 or (and the best yet) they put out, for your use, all the cardboard boxes that the products came in. There is also recycling and bio-degradable plastic bags that will turn into garden mulch in about 6 months. These bags are mandated in most other Countries.

Might I suggest burning a car tire on Erf Day, which is right around the corner?

I’ve missed only a few years of my annual celebration of flaming rubber since 1990. It warms my heart to see the black pall floating through the sky!

Why, I have a shed full of old tires. I might have to throw some on the ol’burn pit on Erf Day. Hope someone reminds me when that day is, because it means nothing to me otherwise.

Holy crap, I went to that Costco link above, and it is $0.0086625 per bag. If you live in a city that bans these and wants you to get $1 reusable ones, buy these and make others jealous!

You didn’t get the memo – throw-backs such as yourself don’t get to inhabit the moral high ground.

I had the clerk triple bag my groceries last night. Just for backwards Luddites like you. Your religion has been proven a joke, and it’s dying – I bet is pisses you off to know that you are irrelevant and your simpering eco-marxism will never again be given any significant traction.

I am going to burn a tire for earth day. And there is nothing you can do about it maggot.

Hey little girl, how’s your fight to get your local building code revoked?

I mean, how dare they tell you how much insulation to put in your walls?

You’re a f*cking clown of breathtaking proportions.

Hey, I need those plastic bags. I use them, a lot. Well reuse I guess is the correct term. They don’t get thrown away empty in my home.

Hey DRywall is here fighting for this, cool.

I have a cat, the litterbox scoopings go into those bags. Hard to carry waste in a reusable environmentally sound cloth bag; so I kind of need something disposable. I’m sorry that using the ones with the smallest environmental footprint is still offensive to some.

I’ve got an alternative now that DRywall is here. You come over and clean my cat’s litterbox with your hands and take the waste out of my home in your pockets.

What, you want to restrict access to these bags, and clearly don’t want me using larger and more environmentally unsound trash bags as that would be worse.

So come carry out my cat’s crap in your pockets; or do your part to destroy the environment yourself.

If you had read my post, you would see that I am not fighting garbage bags or sh.it bags.

I am opposed to plastic shopping bags when a reusable bag will do.

Over a billion plastic bags did not go into a landfill in Canada over the past two years thanks to bag bans or 5¢ bag fees.

That people are pantspissing over the laughably minimal effort it takes to create less garbage is truly amazing.

That people are crybabying that this is some outrageous act of nanny stateism is beyond stupid.

If you had read everyone else’s posts, you would see that we don’t believe the government should be able to tell us if we can use plastic bags or not (or even if it legally can that it shouldn’t). If you want to go to minimal effort to create less garbage, have at it. But you want to force me not to as well.

Just for you, I AM going to burn a tire. Maybe two.

The government already takes steps to reduce how much an earth scorcher like you pollutes with a far ranging number of standards and regulations that affect much of your daily life.

Go ahead and burn your tires like a pouty little child.

Yes it does. And we don’t like it. Push anyone too far, and there will be blowback.

Why didn’t you respond to this post, btw?

BTW, weren’t these plastic grocery bags invented because the tree-huggers told us we needed to save more trees?
Del Dolemonte on March 29, 2012 at 6:47 PM
 
You, are absolutely correct! That IS how how the nifty little plastic bags came about. Now, the environmentalists aren’t happy, AGAIN! Save the trees, save the earth, save this, save that…

Why don’t we worry about trying to save the economy right now, and not so much about the earth at this point. It’s killing my finances trying to follow the lefties rules in this economy.
