I stopped by this location today to grab a quick bite to eat before heading off to work functions.

This Subway is located in the Republic of Santa Monica and I don&apos;t head this way often. I was pleased overall with my experience at this Subway. I tend to frequent Subway&apos;s as much as I frequent Starbucks which tends to be a lot.

One thing I can not stand no matter the industry is trying to do something so fast that you end up doing it slow which means you screw things up and have to either start over or reflect on what just happened.

I was asked by the employee what I wanted to eat as the employee was standing behind the counter chewing gum, Strike 1.

The person who helped me had to have my order repeated and they proceeded to throw meat onto the sandwich in a hurry loading up cold cuts in one area of the sandwich. This action caused another employee to have to separate the cold cuts on the sandwich and put some back into their containers, Strike 2.

After I paid the cashier took my receipt which will be used for my expense report and threw it in the garbage before asking if I wanted it or not, Strike 3.

This place was clean, the parking is a nightmare it is Santa Monica and Cops are everywhere if you are thinking of pulling a quick U-Turn to pull into a space, that is a BIG NO NO is Santa Monica.

Based on the 3 Strikes your out rule, I will not be coming back here.

Maybe it&apos;s because we got there for an early lunch, before the employees had time to get grumpy, but we were actually pretty surprised at how friendly the employees were here.  Each and every single one greeted my wife and I as we walked in.  It made a normally routine meal, into a pretty pleasant experience.

It&apos;s subway. So the five stars isn&apos;t for the gourmet food but rather for the great staff and the great service you get at this specific location!

I&apos;ve been coming to this subway for 6 years and I think some of the people have worked there that entire time! It&apos;s kinda like the tv show Cheers... Well, they don&apos;t actually know my name but they recognize my face and always give me great subway service!

This is my favorite Subway.

They are always happy and yesterday they were all wearing Santa hats, which I thought was adorable. I can&apos;t believe how fast they are at making sandwiches!! I couldn&apos;t get my wallet out before my sandwich was done!!!

I have probably come here at least 20 times and every single time has been an amazing experience. I was VERY surprised to see an average of 3 stars for this place. I just can&apos;t believe it.

Don&apos;t be fooled by the long line you see when you walk in. They are extremely fast and  you won&apos;t be waiting long.

The thing I like most is the high energy and good vibe I get. Plus they have parking in the back!

I have been to this Subway at least 20 times now. Every time I go, I hope the next time will be better. It never is.

There is always a line that is 10 people deep. The bread cutter always asks for my order when I am still 5 feet from the makeline- it&apos;s hard for me to hear, and for her as well. And it doesn&apos;t speed things up. It just aggravates me.

The sandwich &quot;artists&quot; - as they are called - also have zero short term memory. &quot;What would you like on your sandwich, sir?&quot; &quot;Lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and olives&quot;.... &quot;Wait... lettuce and....sorry, I forgot?&quot;

me: &quot;Tomatoes pickles and Olives&quot;

&quot;Artist: &quot;Ok, tomatoes and what else?&quot;

me: &quot;Pickles. And. Olives.&quot;

Artist: &quot;Sorry, pickles and...........&quot;

me: &quot;OLIVES GODDAMMIT!!!!&quot;

Although it is a $5.00 foot long, so you can;t really go wrong. And they are (usually) tasty.

I find it interesting to see less-than-stellar service experiences here, because it&apos;s a given for me at this location. Service that made me review a Subway, for goodness sakes. I think they do a great job for speed and accuracy. Definitely as good as a Subway gets.

horrible service. horrible managers. talk about you in front of you. gives you attitude. doesnt follow hygeine rules. doesnt listen to your needs or wants.  DONT CHANGE GLOVES BETWEEN CUSTOMERS. VERY RUDE. I have food allergies and ask them not to touch somethings but they dont listen.  I have food allergies and ask if one person can make my sandwich and the employees get mad, throw my roll to the side, start complaining in a foreign language, and I understand the language. Make me wait because there is a line. Well I also waiting in the line but I get treated like I am asking about something unreasonable.
EMPLOYEES  CHANGE YOUR ATTITUDE AND GIVE CUSTOMERS THEIR SATISFACTION. DONT BE RUDE AND IMPOLITE.

Let&apos;s face it, the food here is not very good -- I&apos;d give it two stars. But darnit if these aren&apos;t the fastest sandwich makers west of the 405!  The line could be to the door, but the amazing speed at which the assembly line makes the sandwiches means that you typically don&apos;t have to wait longer than 5 to 10 minutes.  The speed and the fact that its healthier than your standard fast food restaurant earns it its third star.

It&apos;s a fast food sandwich place. It&apos;s not truly anything I would crave, but when I am in the neighborhood and have a hankering for a sandwich, this is the Biggest Bang for your Buck. For $5.00, you get a lot of sandwich! This particular venue always seem crowded, but the quality of the food is just fair. The staff speaks so fast, it&apos;s difficult to understand them, plus several times when  I make specific items NOT to put in the sandwich, but the staff seems HARD OF HEARING, or they do not listen. They are either talking in Spanish amongst themselves, and half way listen to my requests, so I end up having to STOP them from their speedy sandwich making to say NO TOMATOES! Then they give me that look.... like they are going to spit on my sandwich... and then throw the rest of the ingredients on and quickly try to get me out of there. Why do I come back? Sometimes I am simply hungry for a big sandwich, and feel lazy. Today was one of those days.
