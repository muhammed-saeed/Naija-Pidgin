 1.Bring out a lot of baby stuff people have about two minutes to look at it and then you have to take the items away. They then try to remember what you showed them and write it down.
2. When people walk in give them a safety pin. When someone hears someone else say baby, they lose their pin.
3.Get some jars of baby food and diapers. Put some baby food in the butt of the diaper. Make the guests guess what kind of food is in the diaper.
4. Take toilet paper and have guests try to figure out how big Mom to be is and then measure around her waist.
Here is some web sites that I found also:

 Hey Jess:
If you have Dollar Stores where you live, you can get some really nice gifts to give out. They usaully have balloons cheap too! As for games....a really simple one is to put a dot on the bottom of about 3 or 4 of your plastic cups used for drinks Blue-Boy, or Red-Girl...Whoever gets those cups gets a gift. Another easy game and fun is the Poo-Poo Diaper...Get about 5 to 8 Diapers and 5 to 8 Candy Bars.....Number each Diaper and make an answer sheet for yourself....Melt a piece of each candy bar in the Diapers and pass them around....Everybody has to write their answer down and at the end whoever has the most right wins!

 this game is called guess the girth. all you need is a ball of yarn.

you measure the mom to be width wise with a peice of the yard. cut when the ends meet, and set aside.

when the game starts pass the yard around the room and tell the guest to guess the girth of the mom to be. use tape to remember the name of whom guessed.

when everyone has tried to guess, take all the answers (yarn) and measure it to the string you used to measure the girth. the closest one wins!

You need only yarn,scissors,a pen, and tape

for gift ideas, go to the dollar store and grab some picture frames, candles, journals, etc.

 The safety pin game is cheap and you only need to get one prize. I&apos;d suggest a gift card or something like that.

Everyone gets a safety pin when they get to the shower, and anytime they catch someone crossing their legs, they get that person&apos;s pin and any other pins that person may have earned. The person with the most pins at the end of the shower wins the prize.

 I have just a few since I have always hated being forced into baby shower games.

First one get cheap baby bottles at the dollar store. Like 5 or 6 and at the party fill them up with punch, water what ever and who ever can finish the bottle first wins a prize.

Second one have a box that says on it winner takes all. And tell everyone to put $1 bills in it. They need to write their names on the money before they put it in the box. And everyone can enter as many times as they want. At the end of the shower pull out a bill and give that person a box of All laundry detergent along with a prize. Get it? Winner takes All. Ha ha, make sure you have $1 bills on hand for people who don&apos;t bring any. And tell everyone that the money is going towards the baby stuff.

Go to the dollar store for prizes, I promise you no one ever knows that they came from there. Or shop Target clearance

I agree with the person above me about the purse game. Its really fun. Oh and the alphabet game. You have the whole alphabet listed down a paper and lines next to each letter and you have to come up with a name that goes along with each letter.

 Honey ~I have lots of game ideas.
1)Bottle game-you will need small pieces of paper, pens, a plastic baby bottle, fill it with candy(skittles, m&amp;ms, sweet tarts, ect) make sure you count how many are in the bottle...at the party you will pass the bottle around... everyone will write on a little piece of paper how many they think are in the bottle...the person with the closest # without going over wins. And when the game is over you can give the bottle to the mother-to-be to use.
2)Mother&apos;s belly-you will need a roll of yarn($.88 @ wal-mart) and some scissors...have the mother-to-be stand in the center of everyone so that they can get a good look at how big her belly is...pass the yarn around...each person will pull off the roll how much they think it will take to go around the biggest part of her belly...the one who is closest wins.
3)Pass the baby-you need a baby doll, music...have everyone stand in a circle...and when the music starts...they will have to pass the baby doll to each other with the doll between thier knees...and if they touch it with thier hands they are out...when the music stops the person with the baby is out...and has to sit down...the last person standing wins.
4)Don&apos;t say baby-you will need some cloths pins(wooden)...as each person enters the shower they will be given one of the cloths pinsto put on their shirt where it can be seen by everyone...and from that point on if someone hears them say&apos;baby&apos;...they can take their cloths pin away from them...and if you have 5 cloths pins and you get caught saying&apos;baby&apos;...you LOSE all 5 of your cloths pins...the one with the most cloths pins at the end of the shower wins.
5)Duck game-you will need a rubber ducky ($.97 @ wal-mart)...you can place him somewhere right out side the door where the shower is going to be held,so that it can be seen ...and the first guest to pick it up and bring it in is the winner.
6)&apos;Thank You&apos;prize -you will need a pens,basket&amp;a pack of thank you cards that will be from the mother-to-be...when all the guest arrive...pass out the envelopes and have them write their address on them...so all the mother-to-be has to do is fill out the card, put her return address and a stamp on it and mail it off...after everyone is done...put all the envelopes in the basket...have the mom-to-be pull an envelope out...the persons name on the envelope gets a prize.

Gift ideas: candles, pack of pens, pack of toliet paper, dish towels, soaps, body wash, lotions... most of this stuff is around $1.00.

Hope this gets you started! Have fun!

 Get a bowl and fill it with rice and baby pins (or plain safety pins) set the timer for 1 minute and see who can grab out the most pins.

Word games all you need is paper and pens
List a word or the babies name or something and then each guest gets 2 minutes (or whatever) to list a baby item that starts with each letter. The one with the most (that are not repeated) wins. Here is an example

B Baby
O Oh so cute
T Ten tiny toes
T Teething
L Lovable
E Eats a lot

 All you need for this game is a roll of toilet paper, each guest has to unroll however much they think it will take to go around the expectant mom&apos;s belly the person closest wins. also you can number the plates on the bottom and when the refreshments are served and eaten you ask the mom to be to pick a number and that person wins. The BEST gift i got was diapers, wipes, and more diapers and wipes, there&apos;s never enough

 I usually play the mom&apos;s purse scavenger hunt. It&apos;s free! The game is best played if there are other moms of younger kids attending the shower. Tell the mom to be that this is what life will be like now that she is having kids:

1) If your purse is a diaper bag, 1 point.
2) Lipstick, 1 point. If your lipstick is chapstick, 1 point. If your lipstick is vaseline from a tub, 2 points.
3) Tissue, 1 point. If your tissue is napkins from a fast food restaurant, you get 1 point for every fast food restaurant you have (they&apos;re usually embossed with the restaurant name).
4) Pen and paper, 1 point. Crayons or markers, 1 more point. Tiny kid pad of paper, 1 more point.
5) Receipt, 1 point. If your receipt is more than 1 month old, you get a point for how many months old it is (shower in August, 8th month, receipt from May, 5th month = 3 points)
6) Toys, 2 points.
7) Candy or gum, 1 point. Snacks in a little container, 1 more point.
8) Plastic grocery bag, 1 point
9) Hand sanitizer, 1 point

A cute gift is chocolate. Candy stores usually will sell baby themed chocolates for about $1-$5. Candles are nice also. Blue or pink if she knows the sex of the baby.

 try using toilet paper to have the guests guess how big the belly is, have them take an amount of toilet paper that they think will reach around the pregnant belly, the one with the closest match wins

use baby bottles and put objects in them and have them guess how many- like skittles, gum, etc

use party favor binkies and place on a string and who ever says anything about the baby or says her/his name gets theres taken away from who ever heard them say it, the one with the most wins a prize

 i have no idea what this game has to do with babies, but i&apos;ve been to two baby showers and both times they&apos;ve had this game:

you take a medium/large size bowl and fill it with cotton balls. a person who is blind folded has to use a regular silver spoon and try to scoop out as many cotton balls as they can.

i think playing 3-4 games is enough. the other games suggested with the toilet paper and safety pins plus cotton balls shouldn&apos;t amount to much money.
