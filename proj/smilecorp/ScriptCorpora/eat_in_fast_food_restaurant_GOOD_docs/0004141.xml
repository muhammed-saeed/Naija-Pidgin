When I come into town, it&apos;s one of the places that I have to go.  More so if I&apos;m out late with family.

The food is great, the burritos are HUGE and they are so damn tasty!

I love their hot sauce, it&apos;s good, it&apos;s hot, and there&apos;s a lot of it!

This place wont win any awards but for what it is I absolutely love it. It&apos;s fast food Mexican food that is much much better than Qdoba, Moe&apos;s, Taco Bell, or anything else like that. Their burritos are amazing, and so are the tacos. The staff is friendly and they&apos;re open late which is great. It&apos;s a great place to grab a quick lunch or a midnight snack.

Burritos as big as your head! How can you not be interested in a place like that.

There has been some late night drinking going on and I was hungry. Hungry hungry. I asked my friend where we should go in her town and she said La Bamba. It was close, it was quick, it was later-night eats.

The atmosphere feels like a cheesy Mexican fast-food place, which is kind of exactly what it is. That being said, it embraces it&apos;s cheesiness. No pretensions, no BS. You know what you&apos;re getting here as soon as you walk in.

I got the combo deal which was a burrito (normal sized though), rice, beans and soda for about $9. It was ... Ok. A pretty hefty burrito and a ton of rice and beans, but none of it blew me away. I don&apos;t know, if I wan&apos;t so hungry I probably wouldn&apos;t have finished the burrito and I certainly didn&apos;t with the rice and beans. It was just your basic, average Mexican food.

That being said, I love a place like this exists. It&apos;s open late, you can get lots of different food choices (next time, I&apos;m going taco) and I hear there&apos;s even a reverse drive-through where you pay and pick up on the passenger side. If that&apos;s not wonderfully insane, I don&apos;t know what is.

Well, the big sign touting &quot;Burritos as big as your head&quot; was a bit of a stretch. But still makes me smile - so I am in support of it.

This isn&apos;t the place you take a date for dinner. I feel certain that 90% of their profits are made after 10 p.m. Mostly at about 3 a.m. when folks are leaving the bars and heading home down Bardstown Road. Open 24/7, La Bamba is an easy pic. And the food isn&apos;t bad. It is definitely a step up from Taco Bell and you can get a taco for $1.79, so worth the stop.

Tip: Be very careful driving through the drive-through. It is backwards!! Clockwise instead of counterclockwise around the building. So if you don&apos;t have a passenger or good depth perception, you might want to just park it and walk on in.

Burritos as big as your head! That&apos;s all most of you likely need to know, but for those wishing to delve deeper, here:

La Bamba is a solid, if unspectacular Mexican joint. Order in front of the grill, receive your food in front of the grill, pay at the register, and seat your own dang self. The food is fast and plentiful, and pretty good for what it is. It&apos;ll never be mistaken for higher-end Mexican cuisine, but something tells me that&apos;s hardly the intention here. It&apos;s something to stuff your face after a night of drinking (or in my case, a day and night of drinking).

Lots of vegetarian and meat options alike. A little too much lettuce on the nachos (just because I don&apos;t eat meat doesn&apos;t mean I want a glorified taco salad) but very good nonetheless.

I have only said this one time in my own personal Yelp history, so you can know I don&apos;t say it lightly: &quot;WHAT IS EVERYBODY HERE THINKING?&quot;

La Bamba has to be one of the worst Mexican restaurants I&apos;ve eaten at at a long, long time.  The place is shitty, the service is short, the options are confusing, but most importantly, guys, this food is just. not. good.

I came around dinnertime on Halloween (yeah, yeah, I know) with mouth watering based on some of these other reviews.  The price was right, too!  $8.00 or $9.00 for a burrito and drink, which is about equivalent to what you&apos;d spend at a similar Tex-Mex place or even a Chipotle.

When my food came out, though, I was less than impressed.  Really less than impressed.  The toasty tortilla was a nice touch, but beyond that: iceberg lettuce, chicken, tomatoes, beans.  And what I don&apos;t get is that other Mexican chains manage to combine these ingredients to incredible effect, whereas eating here literally felt like I was sampling out of my refrigerator.

Please don&apos;t come here.  Go to a Taco Bell, go to your burrito fast casual chain of choice, heck, heat up a tortilla and cheese at home, I don&apos;t care.  But you Yelpers led me into a pretty sadistic trap.  Either that or none of you have eaten this food sober, which, on a second read-through, might be a pretty reasonable assumption.

Pulled up to the drivethru ( which is oddly placed if you have no passenger the window is on the right side of the car) and heard nothing for at least two min. Now keep in mind I&apos;m a laid back person, I used to work fast food, I get it, so in all honesty im a very patient cust. So i said hello. They said nothing, I waited another 4-5 min and  got nothing. So I re-attempted the hellos and at the same result pulled to the window. My friend and I waved hello and the guy walked to the window. We said hey we didnt hear anything over the speaker and the guy said &quot;im busy ok?&quot; and slammed the window shut. So we drove off. It was the weirdest exchange and at 2a there was no one in the place and no one in the dthru. but they&apos;re open until 4a.  So... Im offended and will not give my money to rude service. I will not go back.

I&apos;ve lost faith in LaBamba.  Used to love going here when I went to Louisville on toy&amp;movie hunts.  Not anymore.

Went there back in April before going to the Improv to see John Caparulo.  Was sooooo disappointed.  My burrito was not up to par like they used to be.  Her nachos were horrible.

Just a total let down.

The beauty about La Bamba is that it makes no pretensions about what it is.  It&apos;s the Danny Trejo of Louisville Mexican restaurants: it&apos;s good at what it does, and what it does ain&apos;t pretty.

Let&apos;s be honest here; any place that claims to have &quot;burritos as big as your head&quot; and stays open until conveniently ungodly hours is inconspicuously telling you that it tastes better when you&apos;re fucked up.  It&apos;s just the kind of hearty, gloriously bad for you meal that absolutely hits the spot when you&apos;ve hit the firewater a bit too adamantly.

That&apos;s not to say that the food isn&apos;t good while sober.  Actually, it&apos;s just flat-out delicious.  It&apos;s quick, cheap and tasty while still maintaining a decent amount of authenticity.  Any place where you can get two delicious steak and pork tacos, a quesadilla, and a side of rice and beans WITH a drink under $10 is simply a gem.

The meat was grilled and seasoned properly, and the rice and beans were flavorful and plentiful.  The atmosphere is absolutely nothing fancy, but that&apos;s to be expected.  The service is courteous and the food is served very quickly.

I simply cannot recommend this place enough, whether for a quick lunch, or to ameliorate that inevitable hangover.  This is definitely one of my favorite fast-food spots in the Highlands.

On that note, these guys are badly in need of a liquor license.

While the burritos were not quite as big as my head, they were pretty big and pretty good.  I was surprised by the habanero sauce which had a lot of heat for a place that rolls up burritos for Gringo and Gringa college kids.  This place was fairly priced and you definitely get a lot of food for what you pay.  It&apos;s also open late, making it drunk munchie central. Fine place.

We cannot believe only 1 other person has reviewed this place. WE LOVE IT! This displaced Texan is thrilled to find some fast, authentic, affordable Mexican food. Even more, I love practicing my Spanish when we visit.

Don&apos;t worry, you don&apos;t need Spanish to order. The place is full of those that don&apos;t speak a word, just love the food.

We ordered the #3 (2 taco + Quesadilla with drink, beans, and rice) and a Burrito &quot;as big as your head.&quot; My husband commented &quot;I just cut into my burrito, and cilantro is bursting out, that&apos;s a good sign.&quot; He wasn&apos;t kidding.

La Bamba, I will dream about your pork tacos tonight, and until I can have another.

So, I feel like I am writing a confessional, letting the world know that I go here at least once, or even twice, a week. This reminds me of the real mexican food I would get at taco trucks or little shacks on the side of the road when I was living in LA. Huge amounts of food, cheaply. I am especially a fan of corn shells instead of flour, and this spot has them! A great selection of Jaritos soft drinks, and they even have their own bobble heads.

A WTF moment: The drive through window is backwards, you order at the driver&apos;s side but the passenger side is where you pick up and pay. Totally confusing late night.

This is a cheap, fun and awesome place to be. Viva La Bamba!

I used to live down the street from this place. It looked like a dump, the type of place where you&apos;d be afraid to eat. But the food is surprisingly good, and cheap! Yes, the sign out front is true, &quot;burritos as big as your head.&quot;

My favorite burrito was the carne asada. Clearly, the burrito weighed about two pounds. Two pounds of meaty/beany deliciousness. They had four sauces: pico de gallo, mild, medium, and hot. Oh, then there&apos;s that one that they keep in the back. The one you have to ask for, and when you do, all the guys at the counter look at you like you&apos;re nuts. Why? Because you would have to be nuts to eat the stuff. The sauce is so hot I think you could use it as paint remover. Hot as it was it was very good.

If you&apos;re in Louisville and you like burritos give this place a try.

Please excuse the fact that I am a burrito snob.  Growing up in California, the Burrito truck was a way of life.  I&apos;ve grown accustomed to the foil wrapped burrito in a paper bag as a staple.  Since moving from California through numerous states, I&apos;ve been unable to find a burrito of the same caliber - even in an actual mexican restaurant.

La Bamba has disappointed me yet again.  I have come by on numerous occasions, thinking it was going to taste better each time.  Well, it&apos;s official - it hasn&apos;t.  I&apos;ve truly given La Bamba a chance by trying it over and over again - this will have made it my 5th visit.  I love good Mexican food, and I want La Bamba to be sooo good, so bad.  I continue to try it time and time again out of desperation - because it has been so long since I&apos;ve truly had quality Mexican food.  If you haven&apos;t noticed, I am passionate about food period.  The Carne Asada Burrito brings back so many memories of joy and happiness, I always make it a point to order it as my gauge of whether the restaurant is worth it.  I ordered my Super Carne Asada Burrito each and every time, and although they state that the burrito is as big as your head - I must admit, it is actually rather small, and has nothing in it except some steak, LOTS of DRY lettuce, and refried beans all wrapped in a huge tortilla.  Unfortunately, this gives you the illusion that the burrito is actually big - its not.  Lots of cheap fillers.  No rice, no tomato, no sour cream, no guacamole, cheese etc.  just the bare minimum.  Not to sound like a total burrito whore - but I&apos;ve had way better.

People will swear by La Bamba&apos;s food, but remember that half those people will have had their food at 0300 on a Saturday night after heavy drinking.  In that mental state, let&apos;s be real for a minute - just about ANYTHING you put in your mouth tastes good.  Need I say, &quot;Waffle House, Denny&apos;s, White Castle, etc....?&quot;  Tell me if I&apos;m wrong - I&apos;ve been there.   Ask any true Mexican food aficionado what the best hangover cure is when it comes to Mexican food - try MENUDO.  Have the same people eat the same thing in a sober state, and then ask them their true opinion then.  If it&apos;s still the best thing they&apos;ve eaten, then they just haven&apos;t had anything better and simply don&apos;t know what they&apos;re missing.

Psst...Here&apos;s a couple of tips to gauge the quality of a Mexican restaurant&apos;s Mexican food:

1.  Order a taco.  If they only offer it with ground beef versus shredded beef - they are cheap.  Granted, if you have the choice to order between the two, that&apos;s another story.  But, if their supposed &quot;steak&quot; taco contains nothing but ground beef - be wary.  If they use shredded beef and its totally watery, again - be wary.  Notice how Taco bell uses ground beef as their default setting for tacos.  Now that Taco Bell is under fire for not even using real beef - even THAT&apos;s suspect.

2.  Freshness of ingredients - True Mexican cooks go out of their way to ensure their ingredients are nothing short of FRESH.  If the lettuce is brown, the guacamole is brown and watery, and the tomatoes are mushy - the quality of food is low.  The lettuce should be crisp and not DRY.

On top of that, a lot of cheap, Mexican restaurants will offer small burritos with the meat inside the tortilla, and the veggies, rice, guacamole separately - then they douse the whole thing in cheese.  This isn&apos;t a real burrito, the presentation is just better, so it seems like you&apos;re getting quality food.   Don&apos;t be tricked by this.  If Mexican is truly quality, it doesn&apos;t need much in terms of presentation to prove it.  Hence the &quot;Super Steak&quot; burrito in a paper bag....
