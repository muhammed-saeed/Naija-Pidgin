 Problem? 
 By bnw-35-_ 5 months ago We eat at Arby&apos;s at least twice as week, sometimes three times. I have been trying to get Arby&apos;s coupons for over a month and can&apos;t seem to get through. I&apos;m 81 and there weren&apos;t computers around when I was growing up. How can I get a free coupon?

 Ah, the sweet embrace of tax season. The red tape, the last-minute scrambling, the wishing that you didn&apos;t take that one freelance job that somehow means you now owe thousands more than you otherwise would have. Is it too late to register as a corporation? Also, do dogs count as dependents? What if they&apos;re especially needy, though? Are you SURE?! Fine. Note to self: obtain a child in the next fiscal year.

To take the edge off this stressful time of year, we&apos;ve rounded up the best Tax Day deals and freebies we could find. Here&apos;s to an as-painless-as-possible Tax Day!

 under Freebies 
 This week there are some food and household freebies available. You can grab a free burger at Wendy&apos;s when you purchase a small fry and beverage. But, if you&apos;re getting a burger you&apos;re probably getting the other two items anyway. Dominos is giving away tons of their new Artisans pizza on their Facebook page. For the health conscious, there&apos;s free yogurt. Coffee lovers aren&apos;t left out, they can grab a free Harvest Spice Coffee. The household freebies has a toilet tissue roll cover you can win daily from Cottonelle . Benjamin Moore is offering a 2 ounce paint sample that is great if you need to do a little touch up to your walls.

Last week, Savings.com blogger Allegra clued us into KFC&apos;s misguided 
attempt to do something nice: selling huge sodas for a diabetes charity .
 Needless to say, their move did not not create the desired reaction, and laughs were had by (nearly) all.

Well, it&apos;s another week, and the trend continues as various purveyors of
 junk foods run afoul of the media. Read on to discover my personal 
favorites.

 How many of you go into a sushi restaurant and order a bunch of rolls thinking it&apos;s low in calories since it&apos;s supposedly good for you? Yes...I&apos;ll admit, I was one of those people until my friend mentioned that spicy tuna rolls are chock full of calories due to the large amounts of mayo contained inside the them. Now, I stick to sashimi and simple sushi.

Read on to see the breakdown of other &quot;healthy&quot; foods and the calories they are harboring. 
 25,000 McDonald&apos;s Big Macs and Man Is Still In Good Health

 When I read that Don Gorske was about to eat his 25,000th Big Mac burger on May 17, I almost fell off my chair. Then, I read that he had been eating at least two Big Macs a day since 1972! That&apos;s 39 years of eating 540 calorie burgers, minus the nine days that he took off. And, to top it off his doctor says his cholesterol is low and he&apos;s in good health!

So, how many calories and how much money did he spend in almost four decades that could have been put towards healthy food? I&apos;ll break it down for you.
