Carbohydrates can be a dieter&apos;s biggest fear. Many carbohydrates contain empty calories that are infamously associated with weight gain and other health problems. The trick is to understand the difference between good and bad carbohydrates to achieve a healthy, balanced diet.
 
Types

There are three types of carbohydrates: starch, sugar and fiber. Sugar and starch raise blood sugar levels and can be a contributing factor to weight gain. They are found in many processed foods. Fruit also contains sugar, but it is a natural sugar. As long as fruit is consumed in moderation, it shouldn&apos;t affect weight management. Fiber is an essential carbohydrate because it promotes digestive and cardiovascular health. Fiber is found in whole grain products and most vegetables.
 
Foods

Healthy carbohydrates such as granola, oatmeal and apples contain about 18, 30, and 20 g of carbohydrates respectively per serving, according to &quot;Counting Carbohydrates,&quot; an article written by Nancy Clark, which appeared in American Fitness. Vegetables are typically low in carbohydrates. Zucchini, broccoli and beans contain only 4, 5 and 7 g of carbohydrates respectively per half cup serving.
In terms of unhealthy carbohydrates, avoid bagels, soda and white pasta. A 3 oz. plain bagel, which is likely smaller than anything served at a fast food restaurant, contains approximately 45 g of carbohydrates. A can of soda contains about 38 g, and pasta has about 40 g per serving. These foods have little or no nutritional value.
 
Recommendations

According to the USDA&apos;s Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005, 45 to 65 percent of total daily calories should come from carbohydrates. That&apos;s 900 to 1,300 calories from carbohydrates based on a 2,000-calorie-per-day diet. People trying to lose weight with a high protein diet should still aim for the 45 percent range.
 
Considerations

People often diet to feel good about themselves and their bodies. However, according to MIT researcher Judith Wurtman, diets low in carbohydrates can negatively affect moods. Carbohydrates cause the body to naturally produce serotonin, Wurtman told MIT news, &quot;Serotonin is crucial not only to control your appetite and stop you from overeating, but it&apos;s essential to keep your moods regulated.&quot;
 
Warning

Abruptly adding fiber to a diet may cause digestive discomfort. However, the symptoms will lessen as the body becomes accustomed to the new diet changes. In the long run, overall health will be improved because fiber promotes a healthy digestive and cardiovascular system and helps with weight management.
People with certain diseases such as obesity or diabetes should be on a special diet to meet individual needs. Anyone who suffers from these or other medical conditions should discuss creating a meal plan with their health care provider.
