 It&apos;s here! 21 June, 2011 I have been waiting for Wendy&apos;s to arrive in Singapore for like 5 years? I love eating this in the US! It&apos;s my weekly indulgence after my session in the gym.

The fries are fantastic, nicely salted with grainy sea-salt. Yup not the kind other fast food restaurant uses. Generous cut, great bite.

The Chilli Cup is a must have for me during winter! And I finally get to have it here! Perfect comfort food for a rainy day in Singapore. I sat on Level 2 of Wendy&apos;s Holland Village and watch the rain pour. Perfect. Decor and MUSIC, just like the US! =) Perfect touch there!

They are open for 24 hours now on Friday and Saturday nights! If you quarreled with your other half or just need time out from the kids. I recommend this place! Bring a jacket on a rainy day! It can get pretty cold in here...just like the US. Love!

 I also recommend this place for:
