Bush Blasts Homosexual Energy Agenda


The Swift Report - http://swiftreport.blogs.com/news/ 
Delivering a speech on the nation&apos;s energy needs yesterday, President Bush reached out to a sizeable portion of his base: conservative consumers who are eager to get their SUV&apos;s on the road in time for summer driving season but also dislike gay people or at least find the gay lifestyle incompatible with their Judeo-Christian values. Under increasing pressure to do something about high-prices at the pump, Mr. Bush placed the blame on what he called the &apos;radical homosexual energy agenda.&apos;

Rape victims suffer enough without this

By Jim Spencer
Denver Post Columnist

Article Published: Friday, April 29, 2005

Imagine two rape victims taken to the same hospital emergency room. Imagine them put in adjoining examination rooms.

Let&apos;s say they have identical injuries.

Presume everything about them is the same except for where they are in their menstrual cycles.

Do they deserve access to the same medical treatment?

At most Catholic hospitals in Colorado, they can&apos;t get it.

The protocol of six Catholic hospitals run by Centura calls for rape victims to undergo an ovulation test.

If they have not ovulated, said Centura corporate spokeswoman Dana Berry, doctors tell the victims about emergency contraception and write prescriptions for it if the patient asks.

If, however, the urine test suggests that a rape victim has ovulated, Berry continued, doctors at Centura&apos;s Catholic hospitals are not to mention emergency contraception. That means the victim can end up pregnant by her rapist.

If it strikes you as weird that two rape victims could receive such different medical treatment in the same ER, get on the phone to your state representative and senator.

Time is running out for legislators to try to override the governor&apos;s ridiculous veto of an emergency-contraception notification bill for rape victims.

And here&apos;s hoping Republican legislators and Republican Gov. Bill Owens finally get the message.

This isn&apos;t about abortion; it&apos;s about crime victims. The so-called EC bill is a symbol of mainstream American values. It comforts the afflicted. It restores control after a terrible trauma. It allows individuals to have information.

If your elected representatives balk at that because the chances of overriding the veto are slim, tell &apos;em what Carol Stamm, the doctor who heads the Colorado Gynecologic and Obstetrics Society, said so eloquently:

When religion and science get mixed up, no one benefits.

That includes Colorado&apos;s Catholic hierarchy, which orders doctors at its hospitals not to do their jobs as defined by the American Medical Association.

It includes Owens, who argues that religious freedom allows private religious hospitals to collect public dollars, then lets them treat rape victims differently based on a definition of conception that differs from that of the National Institutes of Health.

But most of all, it includes those befouled by a vicious crime. Without an emergency-contraception notification law, they can easily end up victimized a second time for nothing more than the vagaries of their cycle.

Science needs to control public health. And, said Stamm, all kinds of science suggests that emergency contraception taken within 72 hours of an assault is an effective way for the victim to keep from getting pregnant.

Science also suggests that emergency contraception that employs the hormone progesterone rather than a mixture of the hormones estrogen and progesterone will not keep a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterine wall, Stamm said.

That ought to answer Catholic concerns that life begins when a sperm fertilizes an egg.

But Tim Dore, executive director of the Colorado Catholic Conference, says directives from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops require Catholic hospitals &quot;to err on the side of life.&quot;

Stamm knows of no test that can determine whether a rapist has fertilized his victim&apos;s egg in the period when emergency contraception works.

Neither do Catholic hospitals.

So they rely on a nonspecific ovulation test that condemns every rape victim who might possibly have an egg in her reproductive system to a different standard of medical care.

This, says the Catholic Church, is religious freedom.

This, the governor agrees, is a constitutional right.

This, the rest of us must force them to understand, is madness.

Martha Stewart Living at the TSA

Volume X Issue 14 - April 28, 2005

Protecting the nation is serious business, and as always we are rooting for the government to get the job done. But a recent report by the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Inspector General that uncovered some outrageous instances of waste and fraud in the newly-formed, vitally important Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has raised the hairs on our head. These textbook examples of small-time corruption are all too typical in the executive branch, but they have no place in our government agencies fighting the war on terror.

The Inspector General’s report makes the TSA sound like they are more interested in interior decorating than homeland security. The TSA spent $252,392 to furnish their office with artwork, $29,032 to hire an art consultant, and $30,085 to decorate their operations center with silk plants. After their spending spree, project managers changed contracting invoices in an attempt to cover up the expenditures.

3.

Doomsayers Say Benedict Fits World End Prophecy By Phil Stewart

Thu Apr 28, 9:17 AM ET

ROME (Reuters) - Pope Benedict&apos;s ascent to the papacy took a conclave of 115 cardinals, four rounds of voting and followed a lifetime of service to the Vatican.

But ask Internet doomsayers eyeing a 12th century Catholic prophecy and they&apos;ll tell you it was all stitched up more than eight centuries ago and that judgment day is nigh.

The prophecy -- widely dismissed by scholars as a hoax -- is attributed to St. Malachy, an Irish archbishop recognized by members of the Church for his ability to read the future.

Benedict, believers say, fits the description of the second-to-last pope listed under the prophecy before the Last Judgement, when the bible says God separates the wicked from the righteous at the end of time.

&quot;The Old Testament states: &apos;believe his prophets and you will prosper&apos; -- so believe it. We are close to the return of the Judge of the nations. Christ is coming,&quot; wrote one Internet post by the Rev. Pat Reynolds.

&quot;Thank God for the witness of St. Malachy.&quot;

St. Malachy was said to have had a vision during a trip to Rome around 1139 of the remaining 112 Popes. The new pope would be number 111 on that list, and is described in a text attributed to St. Malachy as the &quot;Glory of the Olive.&quot;

To connect Benedict, a pale, bookish German, to anything olive takes some imagination. But Malachy-watchers point to the choice of the name Benedict -- an allusion to the Order of Saint Benedict, a branch of which is known as the Olivetans.

&quot;When (he) chose the name Benedict XVI, this was seen as fulfilling the prophecy for this pope,&quot; wrote one entry on www.wikipedia.org.

Benedict said that he chose the name partly in honor of Pope Benedict XV (1914-1922), calling him a &quot;courageous prophet of peace.&quot; On Wednesday, Benedict dedicated his papacy to &quot;the service of reconciliation and harmony between peoples.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps Benedict XVI will be a peacemaker in the Church or in the world, and thus carry the olive branch,&quot; speculated www.catholic-pages.com.

Another site, www.bibleprobe.com, went even further, showing a picture of Benedict holding olive branches in March during Palm Sunday celebrations.

&quot;Is this the Pope of Peace (olive)?&quot; it asked in the caption.

Critics widely dismiss the Malachy prophecy as a forgery and possible propaganda meant to influence a 16th century conclave. Doses of skepticism even appear on the most energetic Malachy web pages.

But believers point out similarities between the prophecy&apos;s descriptions and past pontificates. Pope John Paul II, number 110, was described in the prophecy as &quot;de labore solis&quot; -- or &quot;of the labor of the sun.&quot;

He was born on May 18, 1920, the same day as a solar eclipse. The pontiff was buried on April 8, 2005 -- the same day as a partial eclipse, visible in the Americas.

More pressing for doomsayers are the prophecy&apos;s references to the last Pope on the list, Peter the Roman, who will lead the Church before &quot;the formidable judge will judge his people.&quot;

Since Benedict is already 78 years old, they say Peter the Roman must be coming soon, and with him, the end of the world.

&quot;His reign will only last a few years at most. This signals that we are living in what may be the end of days as we know it,&quot; said one Web Site entry by someone calling himself SmartBob.

Efforts To Privatize Health Care System Ignore Real Issues, Columnist Writes

Access this story and related links online:

 http://www.kaisernetwork.org/daily_reports/rep_index.cfm?DR_ID=29715 

The U.S. health care system &quot;is desperately in need of reform,&quot; but &quot;it will be very hard to get useful reform for two reasons: vested interests and ideology,&quot; columnist Paul Krugman writes in a New York Times opinion piece, part of an ongoing series on health care. Krugman writes that &quot;America is ruled by conservatives&quot; who have a &quot;private obsession: they believe that more privatization, not less, is always the answer,&quot; despite evidence of a &quot;private sector gone bad.&quot; In the column, Krugman cites the 2004 Economic Report of the President, which he says &quot;takes a Panglossian view&quot; of the uninsured - that foregoing health insurance is a &quot;matter of choice&quot; for many U.S. residents. Krugman writes, &quot;President Bush didn&apos;t cause the crisis in American health care,&quot; adding that Bush&apos;s health care policies &quot;have made things only a little bit worse.&quot; Krugman concludes, &quot;[E]ven though all the evidence suggests that we would be much better off under a system of universal coverage, any such move will be fiercely opposed, on principle, by conservatives who want us to move in the opposite direction&quot; (Krugman, New York Times, 4/29).

&quot;WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE IS TRUE EVEN THOUGH YOU CANNOT PROVE IT?&quot; - GEORGE B. DYSON


Great minds can sometimes guess the truth before they have either the evidence or arguments for it (Diderot called it having the &quot;esprit de divination&quot;). What do you believe is true even though you cannot prove it

Interspecies coevolution of languages on the Northwest Coast.

During the years I spent kayaking along the coast of British Columbia and Southeast Alaska, I observed that the local raven populations spoke in distinct dialects, corresponding surprisingly closely to the geographic divisions between the indigenous human language groups. Ravens from Kwakiutl, Tsimshian, Haida, or Tlingit territory sounded different, especially in their characteristic &quot;tok&quot; and &quot;tlik.&quot;

I believe this correspondence between human language and raven language is more than coincidence, though this would be difficult to prove.

NASA - CONCUSSION DETECTOR

A device to detect brain injuries on the sidelines of a football game, on a battlefield, or in the emergency room has been developed by researchers at Georgia Tech and Emory University.

Called DETECT [Display Enhanced Testing for Concussions and mTBI (mild traumatic brain injuries) system], the device, which includes software applications, a portable computer, and an LCD display in the headgear, assesses problems associated with concussions.

When suffering from mTBI, a person will have difficulty with certain types of thinking controlled by different areas of the brain, such as working memory, complex reaction, and multi-tasking. DETECT runs the wearer through three types of neuropsychological tests that measure the function of several parts of the brain. While a typical mTBI test requires 1-2 hours of testing, DETECT performs neuropsychological tests in an immersive environment in about 7 minutes.

BLOGGERS SEARCH FOR A BUSINESS MODEL

WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- So how do you make money with Web logs? The question is being asked more frequently as bloggers-turned-entrepreneurs search for a financial reason to keep posting.

Two of the latest efforts are from Roger L. Simon, the mystery author, and John Battelle, the former chief executive of Standard Media International (which published the Industry Standard magazine), who is finishing a book about Internet search.

Simon hopes to launch the Blog News Service, aggregating content and selling advertising across the network of publishers. An editorial board including Web loggers Glenn Reynolds and Lawrence Kudlow is already in place.

&quot;We invite you all to join us,&quot; Simon wrote on his blog. &quot;We would be delighted to place ads on your blog and pay you for them.&quot; Read the open letter from Simon.

 http://www.rogerlsimon.com/mt-archives/2005/04/an_open_letter.php 

Battelle&apos;s venture, FMPublishing, is also in startup phase, revealing little about its business model as he searches for financing. He intends to partner only with blogs that already have their own business models, according to a report in Business 2.0.

Battelle plans to offer &quot;back-room&quot; tech services to online publishers, as well as sell category-specific advertising on the sites. He&apos;s been providing some of this for BoingBoing.net for the past six months, and is said to be generating $40,000 a month in ad revenue.

Borowitz Report - katie couric shocker

MILLIONS FLEE KATIE COURIC

&apos;Today&apos; Host Ignites Frenzied Run for the Border

Incidents of widespread panic were reported across the country today as millions of terrified Americans fled Katie Couric, the host of the NBC&apos;s &quot;Today Show.&quot;

The frenzied exodus marked the latest turn in the storied career of the morning host, once considered America&apos;s sweetheart but now widely seen as a ruthless diva capable of crushing all in her path at the slightest whim.

Gregory Drunson, 42, was one of hundreds who jammed a Greyhound bus terminal in Flint, Michigan, desperate to flee to Canada and be as far away as possible from the once-chirpy morning despot.

&quot;I used to watch &apos;Today&apos; every morning,&quot; Mr. Drunson said. &quot;Now when I turn it on I am afraid that Katie Couric will burn a hole in me with her heat vision. I&apos;m getting the hell out of here!&quot;

The flood of refugees from Katie Couric might be the decisive factor in tipping the balance in the ratings war between &quot;Today&quot; and its closest rival, ABC&apos;s &quot;Good Morning America.&quot;

According to Jode Croydon, who tracks the broadcasting industry for Credit Suisse First Boston, &quot;News footage showing people packing up their belongings on the roofs of their cars to escape from Katie Couric could be harmful to the ratings of &apos;Today,&apos; going forward.&quot;

But not so, says Jeff Zucker, President of the NBC Universal Television Group: &quot;Anytime something happens that gets people talking about your show again it&apos;s a good thing, and this lemming-like rush to flee Katie definitely has people talking.&quot;

Elsewhere, the manufacturers of the Airbus A380 said that the giant plane will enable airlines to lose larger pieces of luggage than ever before.

Return of the Fallen: Pentagon Releases Hundreds More War Casualty

Homecoming Images

National Security Archive Update, April 28, 2005

Freedom of Information Act Forces Opening of 360 New Photos

Confirms War Casualty Honor Ceremony Images Belong in Public

 http://www.nsarchive.org 

Washington, D.C., April 28, 2005 - In response to Freedom of Information Act requests and a lawsuit, the Pentagon this week released hundreds of previously secret images of casualties returning to honor guard ceremonies from the Afghanistan and Iraq wars and other conflicts, confirming that images of their flag-draped coffins are rightfully part of the public record, despite its earlier insistence that such images should be kept secret.

One year after the start of a series of Freedom of Information Act requests filed by University of Delaware Professor Ralph Begleiter with the assistance of the National Security Archive, and six months after a lawsuit charging the Pentagon with failing to comply with the Act, the Pentagon made public more than 700 images of the return of American casualties to Dover Air Force Base and other U.S. military facilities, where the fallen troops received honor guard ceremonies. The Pentagon officially refers to the photos as &quot;images of the memorial and arrival ceremonies for deceased military personnel arriving from overseas.&quot; Many of the images show evidence of censorship, which the Pentagon says is intended to conceal identifiable personal information of military personnel involved in the homecoming ceremonies.

Begleiter&apos;s lawsuit is supported by the National Security Archive and the Washington, D.C. office of the law firm Jenner&amp;Block. &quot;This is an important victory for the American people, for the families of troops killed in the line of duty during wartime, and for the honor of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country,&quot; said Begleiter, a former CNN Washington correspondent who teaches journalism and political science at the University of Delaware. &quot;This significant decision by the Pentagon should make it difficult, if not impossible, for any U.S. government in the future to hide the human cost of war from the American people.&quot;

Misleading About WMDs

 RAHUL MAHAJAN , rahul@empirenotes.org, http://www.empirenotes.org,
http://www.occupationwatch.org

Yesterday the Iraq Survey Group released its final report finding that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction. A Gallup poll released today finds that &quot;half of Americans say the Bush administration deliberately misled Americans about whether Iraq has weapons of mass destruction. This is the highest percentage that Gallup has found on this measure since the question was first asked in late May 2003.&quot;

Mahajan is author of the book &quot;Full Spectrum Dominance: U.S. Power in Iraq and Beyond.&quot; He said today: &quot;Many who scrutinized the Bush administration&apos;s claims about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction had concluded by late 2002 that they were deliberately misleading us.
[See:

http://www.accuracy.org/bush and

http://accuracy.org/newsrelease.php?articleId=598 ]

On the torture scandals, the U.S. government has at least gone through the motions of doing investigations, even though none involved independent commissions and they let the chief perpetrators off the hook. But there has been no accountability for the WMD fabrications. Pat Roberts, chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, which has delayed investigating &apos;use of intelligence&apos; for almost a year, recently indicated on Meet the Press that resumption was a low priority. The government used fabrications to drive the nation to war. Although Congress has swallowed a story about &apos;faulty intelligence,&apos; the public isn&apos;t buying it. In a functioning democracy, there would be public hearings and accountability for the administration.&quot;

An attempt to hijack Christianity

by Jim Wallis

Last week, I wrote about the &quot;Justice Sunday&quot; event held at a Louisville, Kentucky, mega-church. James Dobson of Focus on the Family, Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council, Prison Fellowship&apos;s Chuck Colson, and Southern Baptist leader Albert Mohler were joined by Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist on video in the event titled &quot;Stop the Filibuster Against People of Faith.&quot; Of course, I have no objection to Christian leaders expressing their faith in the public arena - it&apos;s a good thing that I do all the time. The question is not whether to do so, but how. As I heard more and more about &quot;Justice Sunday,&quot; it felt to me like it was crossing an important line - saying that a political issue was a test of faith.

So, when I was invited to speak at an interfaith &quot;Freedom and Faith&quot; service at Central Presbyterian Church in Louisville, I agreed. On Sunday morning, I flew to Louisville, and that afternoon addressed more than 1,000 people who attended the rally. I didn&apos;t go to say that these leaders shouldn&apos;t bring their faith into politics; the issues concerning them - abortion and family values - are also important to me. But the way they were doing it was wrong. The clear implication of their message was that those who opposed them are not people of faith.

We can get some historical perspective by looking at how Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. did it - and he was the church leader who did it best. Once after he was arrested, he wrote a very famous &quot;Letter from a Birmingham Jail,&quot; addressed to the white clergy who were opposing him on the issues of racial segregation and violence against black people. Never once did he say that they were not people of faith. He appealed to their faith, challenged their faith, asked them to go deeper with their faith, but he never said they were not real Christians. If Dr. King refused to attack the integrity and faith of his opponents over such a clear gospel issue, how can the Religious Right do it over presidential nominees and a Senate procedural issue known as the filibuster?

After the &quot;Justice Sunday&quot; event, and the controversy surrounding it, some of the sponsors are denying they ever claimed that those who oppose them are hostile to people of faith. Yet their words stand for themselves. In the letter announcing the event on the Family Research Council Web site, Tony Perkins wrote: &quot;Many of these nominees to the all-important appellate court level are being blocked...because they are people of faith and moral convictions.... We must stop this unprecedented filibuster of people of faith.&quot;

So, I told the Louisville rally that when someone has stolen our faith in the public arena, it is time to take our faith back. &quot;Justice Sunday&quot; was an attempt to hijack Christianity for a partisan and ideological agenda. Those on the Religious Right are declaring a religious war to give their version of faith religious supremacy in America. And some members of the Republican Party seem ready almost to declare a Christian theocracy in America. It is time to take back both our faith and our Constitution.

It is now clear there are some who will fight this religious war by any means necessary. So we will fight, but not the way they do. We must never lie or misrepresent the facts or the truth. We must not demonize or vilify those who are our opponents. We must claim that those who disagree with our judgments are still real people of faith. We must not fight the way they do, but fight we must. A great deal is at stake in this battle for the heart and soul of faith in America and for the nation&apos;s future itself. We will not allow faith to be put into the service of one political agenda.

This is a call for the rest of the churches to wake up. This is a call for people of faith everywhere to stand up and let their faith be heard. This is not a call to be just concerned, or just a little worried, or even just alarmed. This is a call for clear speech and courageous action. This is a call to take back our faith, and in the words of the prophet Micah, &quot;to do justice, to love kindness, and to walk humbly with our God.&quot;

Success! How you&apos;ve protected the courts--and what&apos;s next

Dear MoveOn member,

Yesterday was an incredible day. Over 15,000 MoveOn members came together and spoke out at 192 &quot;Rallies to Stop the Judicial Takeover&quot; – all organized in less than a week by other MoveOn members in all 50 states. The Washington, D.C. event featured a stirring address by former Vice President Al Gore.

It was the culmination of 10 days of intense action to save our courts – and it was a huge success. Two weeks ago, it seemed virtually certain that we would wake up today to find Bill Frist and the radical Republicans pulling the trigger on their &quot;nuclear&quot; scheme to stack the courts. Instead, today Frist is scrambling for more time and grasping for more votes, while national polls show two thirds of the country solidly against him [1].

While we celebrate our progress, we must remember the fight is far from over. The key to victory is to keep our momentum going and our visibility high – we&apos;ve got to keep them on the run. Today you can take the easy step of printing and displaying a window sign, showing your commitment to protecting the courts. Please put one in your window today:

The Rallies to Stop the Judicial Takeover made waves from Tucson, Arizona to Portland, Maine. Hundreds of news reports are now pouring in from local television stations, radio stations, and newspapers all across the country. You have brought your message home to tens of millions of Americans who now see how strongly their friends and neighbors feel about protecting the integrity of our courts. And you&apos;ve applied the most effective kind of pressure there is on our representatives in Washington.

What were the events like yesterday?

&quot;It was great to see so many people coming together. Many people, myself included, said that this was the first time that we have ever demonstrated. That&apos;s a major accomplishment and shows to what extent people are moved to try to stop the erosion of our democracy.&quot;—Pat, Hartford, Connecticut

&quot;The whole thing was awesome. When I finally left at 6:20, there were still at least 25 people standing on the sidewalk along the street holding their signs and chanting! Many people told me they had never been to anything like this before, and they would definitely do it again.&quot;—Susan, Decatur, Georgia

&quot;As we left, shortly after 6:00 pm, the police officer assigned to our rally said, &apos;Y&apos;all made sense and you were so nice, I may have to become a Democrat.&apos;&quot;—Sharon, Austin, Texas

&quot;I was the lone Republican in the crowd. I was selected as speaker for my group, mainly because I wanted all to know that this is NOT a Democrat or Republican issue. This is a Constitutional Crisis that affects us ALL. I was both humbled and proud to be selected to explain the difference between a Constitutional Conservative and these NeoConservatives driving our government&apos;s agenda.&quot;—Earl, Chapel Hill, North Carolina

Crowds braved intense rain in Portland, heat in Houston, and hail in Minneapolis. From large gatherings with major speakers to small groups of neighbors holding signs and discussing the issues, our voices were heard – and 94% percent of those who came said they would do it again.

At the same time Al Gore delivered an inspiring, high-energy address to a full house of MoveOn members and the national press. He talked about what is really at stake in this fight – 200 years of checks and balances and respect for the rule of law itself. He summed up this crisis in plain, powerful terms &quot;The proposal from the Senate majority leader to abolish the right of unlimited debate is a poison pill for our democracy...the survival of freedom depends on the rule of law.&quot;

Their change in plans is a hard fought victory over a Republican establishment that is not used to backing down. It&apos;s absolutely incredible how much we&apos;ve accomplished together in the last few weeks:

You&apos;ve sent 44246 personal letters to the editors of 3082 papers opposing the &quot;nuclear option&quot; – reaching nearly every sizable newspaper in the country. Thousands of your letters were published, and after receiving your letters over 400 editorials have now been written by the newspapers themselves opposing the &quot;nuclear option&quot; – including a powerful piece published yesterday in the country&apos;s largest paper, USA Today. [2]

You&apos;ve made 104,000 calls (that we know of!) to your senators, demanding that they protect the courts.

You&apos;ve raised $833,518 (with an average contribution of $43 dollars) -- enough to put hard hitting television and radio ads on the air nationwide and in the home states of target senators.
You&apos;ve held 1,500 house meetings, and went out in 800 teams going door-to-door, talking to neighbors and delivering signs.

And yesterday you organized 192 major simultaneous rallies in all 50 states (a first for MoveOn!) blanketing the nation with local and national news reports and eliminating any doubt that the American people are ready to stand up and fight for our democracy.
Next week, Congress goes into recess, and the Republican leadership will be using this break to twist arms to regain the upper hand. Bill Frist has already declared he won&apos;t accept any compromises, and the White House dispatched Karl Rove to promise there would be no retreat [3].

To help keep our momentum up, please print and place a window sign today.

Next week, we&apos;ll continue to match them every step of the way – and this fight will likely escalate again as soon as they return to Washington. But with the energy, commitment and innovation that we&apos;ve seen in the last 10 days, today&apos;s victory will only be the first of many.

Thanks for all that you do,

P.S. Congratulations to the dozens of other groups that have led in this fight—especially our friends at People for the American Way, Alliance for Justice, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, Earthjustice, and the countless other national and local members of the Coalition for a Fair and Independent Judciairy who have contributed to making this campaign a success.

Our special thanks to Vice President Gore who adjusted his busy schedule so he could deliver an amazing keynote address. You can read the first section below, or see a video and read the speech in its entirety here:

 http://www.moveonpac.org/algore/rally.html?id=5488-5514896-aNiggeqsK2uquw0f.BZgcw&amp;t;=10 

Four years and four months ago, the Supreme Court of the United States, in a bitterly divided 5 to 4 decision, issued an unsigned opinion that the majority cautioned should never be used as a precedent for any subsequent case anywhere in the federal court system.

Their ruling conferred the presidency on a candidate who had lost the popular vote, and it inflamed partisan passions that had already been aroused by the long and hard-fought election campaign.

I couldn&apos;t have possibly disagreed more strongly with the opinion that I read shortly before midnight that evening, December 12, 2000. But I knew what course of action best served our republic.

Even though many of my supporters said they were unwilling to accept a ruling which they suspected was brazenly partisan in its motivation and simply not entitled to their respect, less than 24 hours later, I went before the American people to reaffirm the bedrock principle that we are a nation of laws, not men. &quot;There is a higher duty than the one we owe to a political party,&quot; I said. &quot;This is America and we put country before party.&quot;

The demonstrators and counter-demonstrators left the streets and the nation moved on—as it should have—to accept the inauguration of George W. Bush as our 43rd president.

Having gone through that experience, I can tell you—without any doubt whatsoever—that if the justices who formed the majority in Bush v. Gore had not only all been nominated to the Court by a Republican president, but had also been confirmed by only Republican Senators in party-line votes, America would not have accepted that court&apos;s decision.

Moreover, if the confirmation of those justices in the majority had been forced through by running roughshod over 200 years of Senate precedents and engineered by a crass partisan decision on a narrow party line vote to break the Senate&apos;s rules of procedure—then no speech imaginable could have calmed the passions aroused in our country.

As Aristotle once said of virtue, respect for the rule of law is &quot;one thing.&quot;

It is indivisible.

And so long as it remains indivisible, so will our country.

But if either major political party is ever so beguiled by a lust for power that it abandons this unifying principle, then the fabric of our democracy will be torn.

Opinion Piece Suggests Ending U.S. Health System, Outsourcing for Care

Access this story and related links online:

 http://www.kaisernetwork.org/daily_reports/rep_index.cfm?DR_ID=29686 

It is &quot;painful to admit that the nation that produced Osler and Salk, pacemakers and MRIs can&apos;t do health care anymore,&quot; but the reality is that the United States &quot;left the whole business [of health care] to business -- both the profit-making and private &apos;nonprofit&apos; variety -- and business screwed it up,&quot; Barbara Ehrenreich, author of &quot;Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America,&quot; writes in a Los Angeles Times opinion piece. According to Ehrenreich, the United States&apos; health care system makes &quot;plenty of people rich&quot; -- including executives at pharmaceutical companies and large hospital chains -- but &quot;makes a lot more people poor: indirectly, by inhibiting job growth, and directly, by grinding individuals down to bankruptcy&quot; as a result of medical bills. While &quot;we can&apos;t outsource our illnesses&quot; the way many U.S. businesses have sought to outsource manufacturing to offset rising U.S. employee health care costs, &quot;we can at least outsource our health care,&quot; she adds. Already, many U.S. residents reimport their prescription drugs from abroad or travel to Manila and Singapore for &quot;low-cost, high-quality care,&quot; Ehrenreich says. Before long, &quot;Motel 6-style hospitals might be &quot;springing up in Tijuana for the American working class,&quot; she adds. Ehrenreich notes that the &quot;abolition of the American health care system [would] lead to some difficult readjustments,&quot; including that U.S. doctors, nurses and technicians would have to find work in the medical tourism field abroad. However, she adds that &quot;for the estimated two million to three million insurance company functionaries whose sole business it is to turn down your claims, these folk may be a bit harder to re-employ because they have no counterpart in any civilized, health-providing nation&quot; (Ehrenreich, Los Angeles Times, 4/28).

&quot;No company appears to be working harder to support those who debunk global warming&quot; than ExxonMobil, writes Chris Mooney. &quot;Some 40 ExxonMobil-funded organizations ... have sought to undermine mainstream scientific findings on global climate change or have maintained affiliations with a small group of &apos;skeptic&apos; scientists who continue to do so.&quot; From 2000 to 2003, ExxonMobil gave $8.7 million to such SourceWatch favorites as the American Council on Science and Health, Atlas Economic Research Foundation, Capital Research Center, Heartland Institute, International Policy Network, Mercatus Center, National Center for Public Policy Research, Tech Central Station, and groups associated with Steve Milloy (the full list is here). As an American Petroleum Institute memo stated, &quot;Victory will be achieved when ... recognition of uncertainty [about global warming] becomes part of the &apos;conventional wisdom.&apos;&quot;

&quot;WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE IS TRUE EVEN THOUGH YOU CANNOT PROVE IT?&quot; - DANIEL C. DENNETT

Great minds can sometimes guess the truth before they have either the evidence or arguments for it (Diderot called it having the &quot;esprit de divination&quot;). What do you believe is true even though you cannot prove it

 http://www.edge.org/q2005/q05_print.html 

 DANIEL C. DENNETT 
Philosopher, Tufts University Author, Freedom Evolves

I believe, but cannot yet prove, that acquiring a human language (an oral or sign language) is a necessary precondition for consciousness–in the strong sense of there being a subject, an I, a &apos;something it is like something to be.&apos; It would follow that non-human animals and pre-linguistic children, although they can be sensitive, alert, responsive to pain and suffering, and cognitively competent in many remarkable ways–including ways that exceed normal adult human competence–are not really conscious (in this strong sense): there is no organized subject (yet) to be the enjoyer or sufferer, no owner of the experiences as contrasted with a mere cerebral locus of effects.

This assertion is shocking to many people, who fear that it would demote animals and pre-linguistic children from moral protection, but this would not follow. Whose pain is the pain occurring in the newborn infant? There is not yet anybody whose pain it is, but that fact would not license us to inflict painful stimuli on babies or animals any more than we are licensed to abuse the living bodies of people in comas who are definitely not conscious. If selfhood develops gradually, then certain types of events only gradually become experiences, and there will be no sharp line between unconscious pains (if we may call them that) and conscious pains, and both will merit moral attention. (And, of course, the truth of the empirical hypothesis is in any case strictly independent of its ethical implications, whatever they are. Those who shun the hypothesis on purely moral grounds are letting wishful thinking overrule a properly inquisitive scientific attitude. I am happy to give animals and small children &quot;the benefit of the doubt&quot; for moral purposes, but not for scientific purposes. Those who are shocked by my hypothesis should pause, if they can bear it, to notice that it is as just as difficult to prove its denial as its assertion. But it can, I think, be proven eventually. Here&apos;s what it will take, one way or the other:

(1) a well-confirmed model of the functional architecture of adult human consciousness, showing how long-distance pathways of re-entrant or reverberant interactions have to be laid down and sustained by the sorts of self-stimulation cascades that entrain language use;

(2) an interpretation of the dynamics of the model that explains why, absent these well-traveled pathways of neural micro habit, there is no functional unity to the nervous system–no unity to distinguish an I from a we (or a multitude) as the candidate subject(s) subserved by that nervous system;

(3) a host of further experimental work demonstrating the importance of what Thomas Metzinger calls the phenomenal model of the intentionality relation (PMIR) in enabling the sorts of experiences we consider central to our own adult consciousness. This work will demonstrate that animal cleverness never requires the abilities thus identified in humans, and that animals are in fact incapable of appreciating many things we normally take for granted as aspects of our conscious experience.

This is an empirical hypothesis, and it could just as well be proven false. It could be proven false by showing that in fact the necessary pathways functionally uniting the relevant brain systems (in the ways I claim are required for consciousness) are already provided in normal infant or fetal development, and are in fact present in, say, all mammalian nervous systems of a certain maturity. I doubt that this is true because it seems clear to me that evolution has already demonstrated that remarkable varieties of adaptive coordination can be accomplished without such hyper-unifying meta-systems, by colonies of social insects, for instance. What is it like to be an ant colony? Nothing, I submit, and I think most would agree intuitively. What is it like to be a brace of oxen? Nothing (even if it is like something to be a single ox). But then we have to take seriously the extent to which animals–not just insect colonies and reptiles, but rabbits, whales, and, yes, bats and chimpanzees–can get by with somewhat disunified brains.

Evolution will not have provided for the further abilities where they were not necessary for members of these species to accomplish the tasks their lives actually pose them. If animals were like the imaginary creatures in the fictions of Beatrix Potter or Walt Disney, they would have to be conscious pretty much the way we are. But animals are more different from us than we usually imagine, enticed as we are by these charming anthropomorphic fictions. We need these abilities to become persons, communicating individuals capable of asking and answering, requesting and forbidding and promising (and lying). But we don&apos;t need to be born with these abilities, since normal rearing will entrain the requisite neural dispositions. Human subjectivity, I am proposing, is thus a remarkable byproduct of human language, and no version of it should be extrapolated to any other species by default, any more than we should assume that the rudimentary communication systems of other species have verbs and nouns, prepositions and tenses.

Finally, since there is often misunderstanding on this score, I am not saying that all human consciousness consists in talking to oneself silently, although a great deal of it does. I am saying that the ability to talk to yourself silently, as it develops, also brings along with it the abilities to review, to muse, to rehearse, recollect, and in general engage the contents of events in one&apos;s nervous system that would otherwise have their effects in a purely &quot;ballistic&quot; fashion, leaving no memories in their wake, and hence contributing to one&apos;s guidance in ways that are well described as unconscious. If a nervous system can come to sustain all these abilities without having language then I am wrong.

NASA - FUEL CELLS

Using a new electrically-assisted microbial fuel cell (MFC) that does not require oxygen, Penn State environmental engineers have developed the first process that enables bacteria to coax
four times as much hydrogen directly out of biomass than can be generated typically by fermentation alone.

By giving the bacteria a small assist with a tiny amount of electricity -- about 0.25 volts -- they were able to convert a &quot;dead end&quot; fermentation product (acetic acid) into carbon dioxide
and hydrogen.

&quot;We can theoretically use our MFC to obtain high yields of hydrogen from any biodegradable, dissolved, organic matter -- human, agricultural, or industrial wastewater, for example --
and simultaneously clean the wastewater,&quot; said Dr. Bruce Logan, the Kappe professor of environmental engineering at Penn State.

Borowitz Report - identity theft shocker

IDENTITY THIEF RETURNS IDENTITIES DEEMED WORTHLESS
&apos;Losers,&apos; Fumes Angry Hacker

An identity thief who has stolen over half a million identities over the past two years returned all but four of them today, declaring the identities &quot;totally worthless&quot; and &quot;an enormous waste of my time and hard work.&quot;

The computer hacker, who spoke to reporters via conference call today, said that &quot;in all my years of stealing identities, I have never come across a bigger collection of losers.&quot;

He said that he had spent months hacking through the security firewall of one of the nation&apos;s largest financial institutions, hoping to reap billions of dollars for his efforts, but after sifting through the stolen identities he found that they were &quot;little more than a garbage dump of unpaid college loans and overdue Blockbuster bills.&quot;

&quot;Everybody&apos;s running around worried about identity theft these days,&quot; he added. &quot;All I can say is, don&apos;t flatter yourself by thinking you have an identity that&apos;s worth my time.&quot;

In San Diego, at the annual convention of the National Association of Hackers and Identity Thieves, some of the nation&apos;s most prominent cyberthieves complained about what they called a serious decline in the number of identities worth stealing.

They called out for financial institutions to institute measures that would warn or &quot;tag&quot; particularly worthless identities, enabling hackers to focus their energies elsewhere.

&quot;You go through these so-called identities, and you realize there are millions of Americans out there who literally have no life,&quot; said one identity thief in attendance. &quot;No wonder the Star Wars movies do so well.&quot;

Elsewhere, the Labor Department reported that unemployment surged by 300,000 this month but attributed the increase to lawyers fired by Michael Jackson.

$100/Barrel oil possible - IMF report

U.S. crude oil soared to a record high of $58.28 per barrel on Monday in a buying frenzy triggered by a Goldman Sachs forecast that prices could spike as high as $105 per barrel.

Rajan said such a high price was possible.

&quot;To the extent that there is some kind of supply disruption, $100 a barrel does not seem outlandish,&quot; he said. &quot;Is it the most likely scenario? I think not necessarily. It depends on how the market evolves.&quot;

The new IMF report estimated world oil demand will grow to 138.5 million barrels per day in 2030 from 82.4 million bpd in 2004.

Significant growth will come from China, which was forecast to consume 19 million bpd of oil in 2030, more than triple the amount used in 2004, the IMF said.

Rising incomes in China mean its motor vehicle ownership rate will soar to an estimated 267 vehicles per 1,000 people in 2030, up from just 16 vehicles per 1,000 people in 2002. By comparison, the United States is forecast to have 843 vehicles per 1,000 people in 2030, up from a rate of 812 in 2002.

Demand for OPEC oil will more than double to a range of 61 million to 74 million bpd by 2030, the IMF said. To meet that demand, cartel members would need to invest about $350 billion to increase production capacity, it said.

However, one economic model suggests that OPEC&apos;s optimal world oil market share is 41 percent to 46 percent for cartel members to balance gains from higher output against the resulting lower prices. That would put OPEC output at 52 million to 59 million bpd in 2030, the IMF said.

&quot;Consequently, OPEC may not have an incentive to significantly increase its current market share of just below 40 percent,&quot; it said.

The IMF will publish its entire economic report at www.imf.org .

St. Thomas president denounces Ann Coulter&apos;s speech as hateful

Last update: April 26, 2005 at 7:00 AM

Matt McKinney, Star Tribune
April 26, 2005 DEASE0426

The president of the University of St. Thomas on Monday condemned a speech at the Catholic school last week by conservative author Ann Coulter, saying &quot;such hateful speech vulgarizes our culture and goes against everything the University of St. Thomas stands for.&quot;

The Rev. Dennis Dease wrote in Bulletin Today, a university newsletter, that &quot;although her presentation may have been meant as an &apos;act&apos; or a &apos;shtick&apos; to entertain by provoking those who disagree, such behavior unfortunately contributes to the growing dark side of our culture -- a disrespect for persons and their sincerely held beliefs.&quot;

Coulter spoke at the university on April 18. She was a guest of the school&apos;s chapter of the College Republicans and a student newspaper, the Standard, but neither organization paid her speaking fee. That was covered by the Young America&apos;s Foundation, a Herndon, Va., organization that bills itself as an outreach program for conservative youth.

A St. Thomas student who heard Coulter said he understood how her comments could have hurt others.

&quot;I knew kind of what she stood for,&quot; said Dominic Kramer, a senior political science major. &quot;One thing that disappointed me overall, from both sides, was the feeling of tension in the room. I think Ann was very well aware of that. That&apos;s what feeds her fire, if you will.&quot;

Coulter spoke at St. Olaf College the day before she visited St. Thomas. The president of St. Olaf, Christopher Thomforde, said students told him that her comments were inflammatory for little reason.

&quot;You&apos;d want a kind of intersection between faithfulness and respect and commitment along with intelligent critique and analysis,&quot; he said Monday night. &quot;The issues are highly complicated, and to just sort of incite people is not helpful.&quot;

Coulter&apos;s booking agent, Walker Hayes, declined Monday to contact her for comment. &quot;We get this sort of stuff all the time, so we&apos;re not the ones to trouble her with that,&quot; he said.

Fake Letters-to-the-Editor

By Graham Webster, Editor&amp;Publisher. Posted April 26, 2005.

After publishing hundreds of letters from a former Republican operative, California papers crackdown -- but can they stop them altogether?

Every now and then, letters to the editor at the Contra Costa (Calif.) Times don&apos;t get posted to the paper&apos;s Web site with the rest of the day&apos;s paper, after midnight. When Dan Hatfield, the paper&apos;s editorial-page editor, arrived at the office at his usual 5:30 or 6 a.m. on those mornings, he&apos;d find out right away that some letters hadn&apos;t made it up, because there would an angry e-mail waiting in his inbox from Kyle Vallone.

Hatfield could never understand why Vallone cared so much.

Times reporter Sarah Krupp solved that riddle in a story published Sunday. After a months-long investigation, Krupp exposed Vallone as the man behind an unusually sophisticated letter-writing campaign.

&quot;We have always found a few little things,&quot; Hatfield told E&amp;P;about previous instances of dishonest letter-writers. &quot;We had found a number of other people who were not nearly as sophisticated as this one.&quot;

Vallone went further than anyone, making up letter writers, securing false phone numbers, and even faking accents on the phone to match his made up names, the Times reported.

After months of reporting, and one earlier confrontation, Krupp got Vallone to admit that he had worked on as many as 200 false letters sent to at least three Northern California newspapers: the Times, the San Francisco Chronicle, and the Tri-Valley Herald.

Krupp started looking into the letters when she was covering a local election and some suspicious letters surfaced in the campaign.

&quot;She started going through mountains of letters looking for the same phone numbers, and she found a few,&quot; Hatfield said. Once she tracked down the numbers in question, she managed to contact Vallone, who at first denied any knowledge of the letters.

After Krupp found out more about Vallone and solidified the reporting for a story, Vallone came forward, saying he had started writing false letters when he was working for a Republican political campaign in 1994. During that campaign, staffers would write letters to the editor, which volunteers would sign and send in their names.

The Times and the Chronicle both verify letters to the editor by phoning the writer and sometimes by other means, but Vallone used free voicemail services to create fictitious identities, the Times reported. Vallone could not be reached for comment by E&amp;P.;

As Krupp&apos;s investigation progressed, the Times developed and implemented new procedures that Hatfield wouldn&apos;t discuss publicly. And with the publication of Sunday&apos;s article, the Chronicle has also started an investigation into any letters it received.

&quot;We are certainly looking into it to determine if we also were targets of his letters, as the article indicated,&quot; John Diaz, the Chronicle&apos;s editorial-page editor, told E&amp;P;Monday afternoon. &quot;It&apos;s obviously an area of great interest and concern to us.&quot;

Regardless of the outcome of the inquiry, Diaz said, the episode has called letter-verification procedures into question, and the Chronicle will &quot;take steps to reduce the chances of this happening again.&quot;

But both Diaz and Hatfield acknowledge that there is probably no way to completely prevent false letters.

&quot;I think it&apos;s probably not possible to build an absolute firewall against somebody who is bound and determined,&quot; Diaz said. Even with new measures, Hatfield agreed, &quot;there is no fail-safe that I know of to guarantee that no [falsified] letter ever will get in there.&quot;

Both the Times and the Chronicle had caught Vallone for previous deceptions. The Times had caught him writing in the name of a local former mayor, and the Chronicle nailed him for plagiarizing portions of a letter from The Wall Street Journal -- a violation the paper corrected in print.

The papers simply didn&apos;t know that the same man was writing under other names. Only after Krupp&apos;s meticulous reporting did the facts become clear.

&quot;She&apos;s the star of this show,&quot; Hatfield said. &quot;This has certainly gotten her noticed here.&quot;

One Year After Abu Ghraib

 MARJORIE COHN , libertad48@san.rr.com, http://haw.yachana.org/resources/torture/cohn.html

Thursday is the first anniversary of the publication of the Abu Ghraib photos. Professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law, executive vice president of the National Lawyers Guild, and author of &quot;Torture of Prisoners in U.S. Custody,&quot; Cohn said today: &quot;Although Donald Rumsfeld approved the use of physical coercion and sexual abuse of prisoners in Iraq, he has been effectively cleared by the Army&apos;s inspector general. Lower-ranking soldiers are taking the fall for a policy of torture that goes all the way up the chain of command.&quot;

 REED BRODY , brodyr@hrw.org, http://www.hrw.org

Brody is special counsel with Human Rights Watch, which has just released the report &quot;Getting Away with Torture? Command Responsibility for the U.S. Abuse of Detainees.&quot; He said today: &quot;The United States should name a special prosecutor to investigate the culpability of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and ex-CIA Director George Tenet in cases of detainee torture and abuse. ... Abu Ghraib was only the tip of the iceberg. It&apos;s now clear that abuse of detainees has happened all over -- from Afghanistan to Guantánamo Bay to a lot of third-country dungeons where the United States has sent prisoners. And probably quite a few other places we don&apos;t even know about.&quot;

&quot;WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE IS TRUE EVEN THOUGH YOU CANNOT PROVE IT?&quot; - WILLIAM CALVIN

Great minds can sometimes guess the truth before they have either the evidence or arguments for it (Diderot called it having the &quot;esprit de divination&quot;). What do you believe is true even though you cannot prove it

 http://www.edge.org/q2005/q05_print.html 

 WILLIAM CALVIN 
Neurobiologist, University of Washington; Author, A Brief History of the Mind

Dan Dennett has it right in his comments below when he puts the emphasis on acquiring language, not having language, as a precondition for our kind of consciousness. For what it&apos;s worth, I have some (likely unproveable) beliefs about why the preschooler&apos;s acquisition of a structured language is so important for all the rest of her higher intellectual function. Besides syntax, intellect includes structured stuff such as multistage contingent planning, chains of logic, games with arbitrary rules, and our passion for discovering &quot;how things hang together.&quot;

Many animals have some version of a critical period for tuning up sensory perception. Humans also seem to have one for structured language, judging from the experience with the deaf children of hearing parents who are not exposed to a rich sign language during the preschool years. Oliver Sacks in &quot;Seeing Voices&quot; described an 11-year-old boy who had been thought to be retarded but proved to be merely deaf. After a year of ASL instruction, Sacks interviewed him:

&quot;Joseph saw, distinguished, categorized, used; he had no problems with perceptual categorization or generalization, but he could not, it seemed, go much beyond this, hold abstract ideas in mind, reflect, play, plan. He seemed completely literal—unable to juggle images or hypotheses or possibilities, unable to enter an imaginative or figurative realm.... He seemed, like an animal, or an infant, to be stuck in the present, to be confined to literal and immediate perception...&quot;

In the first year, an infant is busy creating categories for the speech sounds she hears. By the second year, the toddler is busy picking up new words, each composed of a series of those phoneme building blocks. In the third year, she starts picking up on those typical combinations of words that we call grammar or syntax. She soon graduates to speaking long structured sentences. In the fourth year, she infers a patterning to the sentences and starts demanding proper endings for her bedtime stories. It is pyramiding, using the building blocks at the immediately subjacent level. Four levels in four years!

These years see a lot of softwiring via the pruning and enhancement of the prenatal connections between cortical neurons, partly on the basis of how useful a connection has been so far in life. Some such connections help you assemble a novel combination of words, check them for nonsense via some sort of quality control, and then—mirabile dictu—speak a sentence you&apos;ve never uttered before. Some must be in workspaces that could plan not only sentences but an agenda for the weekend or a chain of logic or check out a chess move before you make it—even be tickled by structured music with its multiple interwoven melodies.

Then tuning up the workspace for structured language in the preschool years would likely carry over to those other structured aspects of intellect. That&apos;s why I like the emphasis on acquiring language as a precondition for consciousness: tuning up to sentence structure might make the child better able to perform at nonlanguage tasks which also need some structuring. Improve one, improve them all?

Is that what boosts our cleverness and intelligence? Is &quot;our kind of consciousness&quot; nothing but structured intellect with good quality control? Can&apos;t prove it, but it sure looks like a good candidate.

As always, you can view the latest Southwest Climate Outlook in html format at:

 http://www.ispe.arizona.edu/climas/forecasts/swoutlook.html 

Highlights from the April 2005 Outlook

Hydrological Drought – Drought impacts continue to ease in much of the Southwest.

• Much of western Arizona and a large portion of New Mexico are free of drought.

• Portions of northeastern Arizona and northwestern New Mexico remain in severe drought.

• Arizona statewide reservoir storage is up 5 percent since last month. Storage in New Mexico is much above last year, but many reservoirs remain below 35 percent of maximum capacity.
Temperature – Water year temperatures have been up to 3 degrees Fahrenheit above average in some areas, but the past 30 days were generally cooler than average.

Precipitation – The water year precipitation remains above average, but the past 30 days have been generally drier than average. Snow water content in northern New Mexico is above average, while it continues a rapid decrease farther south.

Climate Forecasts – Long-lead forecasts call for increased chances of above-average temperatures in the Southwest. There are no forecasted precipitation anomalies in Arizona or New Mexico through October. Streamflow forecasts show near to above-average conditions for much of the Southwest and Colorado River Basin.

El Niño – Neutral conditions have the highest probability of occurrence in the tropical Pacific Ocean, although El Niño chances remains above average.

The Bottom Line – Spring snowmelt will lead to increased runoff, above-average streamflow, increasing reservoir storage, and a further alleviation of hydrologic drought in the Southwest.

YouReadMe - finds the really important posts

 http://www.youreadme.com/ 

We&apos;re lazy. There are just too many blogs out there. No mortal can read them all. And let&apos;s face it, only a handful of the millions of blog posts each day are really worth reading.

So we created YouReadMe and let the computer do the reading for us. It reads tens of thousands of blogs multiple times throughout the day and finds the really important posts: the ones linked to the most by other bloggers. Now we can read the &quot;hot&quot; posts, see what people are saying about them, and have a much more complete view of what&apos;s going on in the blogosphere.

YouReadMe is the first public project released by XB Labs, but you shouldn&apos;t click on that link because there&apos;s nothing there (yet). We will be adding a range of new and exciting features in the weeks to come, so keep checking back. And we welcome any thoughts you may have on how to make the site more useful. Send any comments, suggestions, or criticisms to info@xblabs.com.

Borowitz Report - saudi love shocker

BUSH TO WED SAUDI PRINCE
Impending Nuptials Alter President&apos;s Gay Marriage Stance

In a stunning development that could alter both the politics of oil in the Middle East and the politics of gay marriage in the United States, President George W. Bush and Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah announced today that they would wed this June.

Tongues began wagging after President Bush greeted the Saudi prince at his Crawford, Texas ranch today with a passionate hug and a kiss, igniting rumors that the two men were more than just good friends.

Former Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry, who was accused of being overly affectionate in public with his then-running mate, Sen. John Edwards, while on the 2004 campaign trail, was one of the first to note the steamy display between Mr. Bush and Prince Abdullah.

&quot;John and I looked pretty gay, I&apos;ll admit, but not as gay as these two,&quot; said Mr. Kerry. &quot;I was like, get a room!&quot;

The announcement that Mr. Bush was set for a trip to the altar with a Saudi prince immediately raised the ire of gay marriage foes, who saw the president&apos;s decision as a cruel betrayal.

Hundreds of protesters appeared outside the Crawford ranch moments after the announcement, carrying signs reading, &quot;No Love For Oil.&quot;

While Mr. Bush acknowledged that his decision to marry Prince Abdullah represents a startling U-turn in his position on gay marriage, he said, &quot;When a Saudi billionaire asks you to marry him, you have to say yes.&quot;

Elsewhere, Kentucky Fried Chicken today sued Wendy&apos;s, claiming that if Wendy&apos;s is placing human fingers in their chili they are infringing on KFC&apos;s &quot;finger licking good&quot; trademark.

After Britney, Americans Divided on which GOP Starlet Likely to Conceive Next

The Swift Report - http://swiftreport.blogs.com/news/ 

A recent survey reveals that Americans are closely divided on the question of which GOP starlet is likely to follow Britney Spears down the road to mommy-hood. While conservative chanteuse Jessica Simpson was the top choice despite recent high-profile marital problems with hubby Nick Lachey, Mary Cheney and newlywed Arthur Finkelstein were close behind.

Justice Sunday belies its name

Article Published: Tuesday, April 26, 2005

commentary

By Ed Quillen
Denver Post Columnist

Democrats, though a minority in the U.S. Senate, have blocked votes on several judicial nominations made by President George W. Bush. This inspired a big rally Sunday at the Highview Baptist Church in Louisville, Ky. Televised nationally on several religious channels, it was called &quot;Justice Sunday - Stopping the Filibuster Against People of Faith.&quot;

In ways, it&apos;s too bad that the Almighty was not inclined to repeat the events of Chapter 5 of the Book of Acts, wherein Ananias and his wife, Sapphira, were struck dead for lying.

But as it is, we can try plain old logic to demonstrate that the Justice Sunday folks are playing loose with the truth. Just follow their assumptions and see where they lead:

They say that Senate Democrats are blocking votes on nominations for federal judgeships because those nominees are &quot;people of faith.&quot;

It follows, then, that the nominations which did get through must be those for &quot;people of no faith,&quot; since they were acceptable to the faith-blockers who would have otherwise used the rules of the Senate to halt the nomination.

Now note that of the 215 judicial nominations made by President Bush, 205 have been confirmed by the Senate. This means that 95 percent of the time, Bush must have proposed a faithless judicial nominee - an agnostic, an atheist, a humanist, who knows? Why weren&apos;t they railing against the president if they think it&apos;s so important to have federal judges who are &quot;people of faith&quot;?

Instead, the Justice Sunday crowd was blasting away at the U.S. Supreme Court for &quot;finding a constitutional right to sodomy&quot; and at the U.S. Senate for its alleged failure to perform its proper constitutional role.

Current Senate rules require 60 votes to stop a filibuster (unlimited debate) on a judicial nomination. A simple majority of 51 could change that rule to require only 51 votes to stop the filibuster. But Democrats say that if the Republicans (who hold 55 Senate seats) change that rule, then they&apos;ll use other Senate rules to bring business to a halt.

The federal Constitution is terse about judicial appointments. Article II, Section 2 says the president &quot;shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the senate, shall appoint ... judges of the supreme court and all other officers of the United States.&quot;

The Federalist Papers offer explanations from several Founding Fathers. Alexander Hamilton called the nominating process &quot;a concurrent authority in appointing to offices,&quot; and predicted the nominations &quot;would naturally become matters of notoriety.&quot;

Elsewhere in the papers, Hamilton explains that the Senate was designed to protect the rights of political minorities; that&apos;s why each state, large or small, has an equal vote there.

The Senate also was designed to be a counterbalance to public excitements, according to James Madison in Federalist Paper 63: &quot;\[T\]here are particular moments in public affairs, when the people stimulated by some irregular passion, or some illicit advantage, or misled by the artful misrepresentations of interested men, may call for measures which they themselves will afterwards be the most ready to lament and condemn. In those critical moments, how salutary will be the interference of some temperate and respectable body of citizens ... to suspend the blow meditated by the people against themselves, until reason, justice, and truth, can regain their authority over the public mind?&quot;

But what does Madison know, compared to R. Albert Mohler Jr., president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary? He told the Justice Sunday gathering that, &quot;We are not asking for persons merely to be moral. We want them to be believers.&quot;

Believing judges like Tomas de Torquemada, who ran the Inquisition in 15th century Spain and burned books and people suspected of heresy? Or John Hathorne of Salem, Mass., a devout man who presided over witch trials in 1692 and sent young women to the gallows based on &quot;spectral evidence&quot;?

It&apos;s worth a filibuster or two to spare us from such inspired judgment. If that provokes a rule change that lets Democrats bring all Senate business to a halt, then that body will not be approving more tax breaks for billionaires, contriving new felonies or extending the Patriot Act. All clouds may not have silver linings, but this one does.

CIBC sees oil at $100 (U.S.)

By Roma Luciw
Globe And Mail
April 5, 2005

In accordance with Title 17 U.S.C. Section 107, this material is distributed without profit to those who have expressed a prior interest in receiving the included information for research and educational purposes.

CIBC World Markets Inc. said Tuesday that dwindling supply and rising demand for oil could see crude prices reach $100 (U.S.) a barrel in the next five years. The price of oil will average around $77 a barrel in the next five years and trade as high as $100 a barrel by 2010, more than twice the previous high reached in the early 1980s after the OPEC oil shock sent crude prices - measured in today&apos;s dollars - to around $65 a barrel, according to economists from CIBC.

&quot;Tomorrow&apos;s price hikes won&apos;t be triggered by sudden supply disruptions like the Arab oil boycott of 1973 of the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Instead, they will follow from the inevitable collision between surging global crude demand and accelerating depletion of conventional crude supply,&quot; CIBC said in a report called &quot;Not Just a Spike.&quot;

Last Thursday, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said oil markets may have entered what it calls a &quot;super spike&quot; period, which could send crude as high as $105 (U.S.) a barrel. In a report, the New York brokerage boosted its estimate for a so-called &quot;super spike&quot; range to between $50 and $105 amid unexpected strength in oil demand and economic growth, especially in the United States and China. Previously, the brokerage&apos;s range had been $50 to $80. Light, sweet crude futures slipped 97 cents to $56.04 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange Tuesday, after earlier trading as high as $57.20.

Fiddling While Crucial Programs Starve

April 26, 2005
Robert Scheer:

Has the U.S. become like ancient Rome, in love with costly conquest?

COMMENTARY

Notice the price of gasoline lately? Isn&apos;t it great that we have secured Iraq&apos;s oil? And as Congress signs off on yet another huge supplementary grant to supposedly protect U.S. interests in the Mideast, our president pathetically begs his Saudi buddies for a price break. As the fall of Rome showed, imperialism never pays.

Of course, back in 2003, conquering Iraq looked like a great package deal, what with all that oil — second only to Saudi Arabia — and the manufactured photo ops of cheering Iraqis. So what if those pesky weapons of mass destruction weren&apos;t really there? So what if no solid links to Al Qaeda are ever found? This was a win-win, as the corporate guys like to say: Not only would we be able to conduct this operation for next to nothing, we would be welcomed with flowers.

&quot;There is a lot of money to pay for this. It doesn&apos;t have to be U.S. taxpayer money,&quot; then-Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz told Congress days before the war, in testimony on the potential costs of invading Iraq. &quot;We are talking about a country that can finance its own reconstruction and relatively soon.&quot; In the real world, however, this turned out to be utter nonsense.

With approval of the latest spending bill, taxpayers will have been forced to cough up more than $300 billion for the war to date — above and beyond the annual $400-billion Pentagon budget — and tens of billions for a bungled reconstruction. Even if the United States can lower its troop commitment to 40,000 troops in Iraq by 2010, as some Pentagon strategists optimistically anticipate, the war could still end up costing U.S. taxpayers up to $646 billion by 2015, according to Rep. John Spratt of South Carolina, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee. If insurgency, corruption and incompetence continue to plague the U.S. occupation as they have steadily for the last two years, however, the number could surge to a trillion dollars or more.

We need to put such gargantuan numbers in some perspective. The emergency funding that the Senate passed 99 to 0 last week gives the military roughly $80 billion and pays for the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan only through September. That is twice what President Bush insists he needs to cut from the federal support for Medicaid over the next decade.

Already the red state of Missouri is set to end its Medicaid program entirely within the next three years because of a lack of funds. As the Los Angeles Times reported, that will save the state $5 billion, but at the cost of ending healthcare for the more than 1 million Missourians enrolled in the program. That sum is less than half of what Halliburton, Vice President Dick Cheney&apos;s old company, alone has been paid for reconstruction efforts in Iraq, without much to show for it in terms of improving the Iraqis&apos; quality of life.

Similarly, with roughly 10% of what we&apos;ve spent in Iraq, we could make up the $27-billion federal funding shortfall in paying for Bush&apos;s controversial No Child Left Behind Act, which tells public schools that they will be all but scrapped if they don&apos;t improve — yet it doesn&apos;t provide the means to do so. This number comes from a lawsuit filed by school districts in Texas, Michigan and Vermont and the National Education Assn., the nation&apos;s largest teachers organization.

Sadly, these domestic failures provide a far greater long-term threat to our nation&apos;s security than the hyped-up claims surrounding our foreign adventures. Abroad, we must &quot;support our troops&quot; at all costs — even if the cost is their lives — while at home, the nation&apos;s leaders are all about tough love.

&quot;Government is not here to do everything for everybody,&quot; admonished Missouri state Rep. Jodi Stefanick, a Republican representing suburban St. Louis. &quot;We have to draw the line somewhere.&quot; Just not in Iraq, apparently.

Welcome to late-era Rome, where mindless militaristic expansion is considered patriotic and where demagogues who recklessly waste taxes and young lives in empire-building are deemed valorous. Wolfowitz, for example, has been rewarded for his ignorance and arrogance with the top job at the World Bank.

It is not too late, however, for us to wake up and recall that, in the end, once militarism trumped republicanism, the glory that was Rome proved to be a hollow boast.

USA Today Looks at Prescription Drug Industry&apos;s Lobbying Efforts

Access this story and related links online:

 http://www.kaisernetwork.org/daily_reports/rep_index.cfm?DR_ID=29608 

USA Today on Tuesday examined the &quot;political clout of the pharmaceutical industry,&quot; which since 1998 has spent $758 million on lobbying efforts -- more than any other industry, according to the Center for Public Integrity. The pharmaceutical industry in 2003 spent $143 million on lobbying activities. At that time, there were 1,274 registered pharmaceutical lobbyists in Washington, D.C. -- more than two for every member of Congress, USA Today reports. Of those, 476 were former federal officials, including 40 former members of Congress. Former Rep. Billy Tauzin (R-La.) earlier this year was named CEO and president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. According to USA Today, Tauzin&apos;s move to the private sector is &quot;testament to the industry&apos;s power.&quot; Prior to taking his position with PhRMA, Tauzin helped pass the Medicare prescription drug benefit as chair of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee. Currently, Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) -- the &quot;gatekeeper for legislation that comes to the Senate floor&quot; -- is a &quot;key lobbying target&quot; for the industry, USA Today reports. During the 2004 election cycle, the drug industry contributed at least $17 million to federal candidates, including $1 million to President Bush and $500,000 to former Democratic presidential nominee Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass).

Election spending on federal candidates by the pharmaceutical industry favored Republicans by a two-to-one margin. According to USA Today, the drug industry &quot;also liberally funds think tanks and patient advocacy groups that don&apos;t bear its name but often take its side,&quot; such as the National Patient Advocate Foundation. Last month, NPAF member Nancy Davenport-Ennis testified in a Senate hearing on FDA&apos;s drug-approval process, saying that an &quot;overemphasis on safety&quot; could delay helpful drugs from reaching the market.

Government Clout

According to USA Today, lobbyists for the drug industry &quot;have been very successful&quot; in advocating their position to the government. Recent legislative victories for the pharmaceutical industry include the passage of the new Medicare law, which expands coverage to include prescription drugs while blocking the government from negotiating price discounts; the continuation of the use of company fees to hasten FDA drug-approval processes; and the preservation of a ban on importing lower-cost prescription drugs from Canada and other nations. According to USA Today, &quot;The industry&apos;s deep inroads into the government are rooted in its dependence on federal decisions.&quot; FDA has responsibility over drug marketing and labeling. The government is also a large purchaser of pharmaceutical products for government programs (Drinkard, USA Today, 4/26).

PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY--

Working families will rally April 26 at the U.S. Capitol and in cities across America to call on Congress to protect Social Security. The rallies will coincide with the opening of Senate Finance Committee hearings on President George W. Bush&apos;s scheme to privatize Social Security.

The National Day of Unity to Protect Social Security and Stop Privatization rally in Washington, D.C., is sponsored by Americans United to Protect Social Security and the Alliance for Retired Americans. Congressional Democratic leaders, Sen. Harry Reid (Nev.) and Rep. Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), dozens of members of Congress and AFSCME President Gerald McEntee will speak at the
Capitol Hill rally. The Senate Finance Committee hearing on Social Security will be crucial for working families, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney said. &quot;The president&apos;s supporters will try to persuade Congress to draft legislation that would bankrupt our economy...but there still has not been an open, balanced national debate on the issue.&quot; Bush&apos;s privatization plan would slash Social Security&apos;s guaranteed benefits, explode the federal deficit and weaken Social Security&apos;s solvency while funneling billions of dollars to financial firms managing privatized accounts.

&quot;WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE IS TRUE EVEN THOUGH YOU CANNOT PROVE IT?&quot; - LAWRENCE KRAUSS

Great minds can sometimes guess the truth before they have either the evidence or arguments for it (Diderot called it having the &quot;esprit de divination&quot;). What do you believe is true even though you cannot prove it

 http://www.edge.org/q2005/q05_print.html 

 LAWRENCE KRAUSS 
Physicist, Case Western Reserve University; Author, Atom

I believe our universe is not unique. As science has evolved, our place within the universe has continued to diminish in significance.

First it was felt that the Earth was the center of the universe, then that our Sun was the center, and so on. Ultimately we now realize that we are located at the edge of a random galaxy that is itself located nowhere special in a large, potentially infinite universe full of other galaxies. Moreover, we now know that even the stars and visible galaxies themselves are but an insignificant bit of visible pollution in a universe that is otherwise dominated by &apos;stuff&apos; that doesn&apos;t shine.

Dark matter dominates the masses of galaxies and clusters by a factor of 10 compared to normal matter. And now we have discovered that even matter itself is almost insignificant. Instead empty space itself contains more than twice as much energy as that associated with all matter, including dark matter, in the universe. Further, as we ponder the origin of our universe, and the nature of the strange dark energy that dominates it, every plausible theory that I know of suggests that the Big Bang that created our visible universe was not unique. There are likely to be a large, and possibly infinite number of other universes out there, some of which may be experiencing Big Bangs at the current moment, and some of which may have already collapsed inward into Big Crunches. From a philosophical perspective this may be satisfying to some, who find a universe with a definite beginning but no definite end dissatisfying. In this case, in the &apos;metaverse&apos;, or &apos;multiverse&apos; things may seem much more uniform in time.

At every instant there may be many universes being born, and others dying. But philosophy aside, the existence of many different causally disconnected universes—regions with which we will never ever be able to have direct communication, and thus which will forever be out of reach of direct empirical verification—may have significant impacts on our understanding of our own universe. Their existence may help explain why our own universe has certain otherwise unexpected features, because in a metaverse with a possibly infinite number of different universes, which may themselves vary in their fundamental features, it could be that life like our own would evolve in only universes with a special set of characteristics.

Whether or not this anthropic type of argument is necessary to understand our universe—and I personally hope it isn&apos;t—I nevertheless find it satisfying to think that it is likely that not only are we not located in a particularly special place in our universe, but that our universe itself may be relatively insignificant on a larger cosmic scale. It represents perhaps the ultimate Copernican Revolution.

MEEKER BULLISH ON NET AD PROSPECTS

WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- Morgan Stanley Internet analyst Mary Meeker told a trade conference on marketing and technology that &quot;Internet advertising spending has nowhere to go but up.&quot; Speaking at the opening of the Ad: Tech industry conference, she said at least one major Net company now spends more than 60 percent of its marketing dollars online. &quot;We think it&apos;s a pretty good prediction of the way things are going for the successful companies.&quot; She said the Web is &quot;the most underutilized advertising medium,&quot; garnering only 3% of total ad spending in the United States.

Here&apos;s a link to a PDF of Meeker&apos;s 50-page presentation.

( http://www.morganstanley.com/institutional/techresearch/pdfs/age_of_engagement.pdf )

Morgan Stanley expects growing availability of high speed Internet access to drive growth in digital advertising, as audio and video marketing efforts become more Net-friendly and compatible.

In remarks after her speech at the conference which organizers said has drawn 6,500 attendees, Meeker identified two other areas she watching fore explosive business growth. One is China, on which she has previously written a research report. The other is Skype, the free software for making phone calls over the Internet, boasting 33 million registered users. &quot;We think Skype may be the most rapidly growing product from an acceptance standpoint the world has ever seen,&quot; Meeker told Business Week.

Borowitz Report - church-state shocker

SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE VANISHES, REPLACED BY NEW ENTITY CALLED STURCH
Will Offer Salvation, Motor Vehicle Renewals on Sunday

The separation of church and state, long considered a hallmark of American democracy, vanished early Sunday morning, replaced by a new institution called sturch.

Scientists at the Clausen Observatory at the University of Minnesota, who for years have been monitoring a widening hole in the wall separating church and state, said that the wall disappeared entirely on Sunday morning shortly after 8:00 (EST).

&quot;We first noticed the hole in the wall developing about four years ago,&quot; said the University of Minnesota&apos;s Davis Logsdon. &quot;But now it&apos;s pretty much no wall and all hole.&quot;

While the exact shape and dimensions of the new church-state entity, sturch, remain to be determined, President Bush today installed as its official leader the Reverend Bill Frist (R-Tenn), the star player in this week&apos;s &quot;Justice Sunday&quot; broadcast.

At a formal swearing-in ceremony at the former White House, now called the Big White Cathedral, Rev. Frist said that jettisoning the wall between church and state would benefit all Americans &quot;except those who are anti-faith, and they know who they are.&quot;

He added that by combining the two traditionally separate institutions, sturch would allow congregants to seek salvation and motor vehicle renewals on Sunday without leaving their pews.

As for the longstanding debate over taxing places of worship, Rev. Frist said, &quot;Since sturch is part of the government, it will be collecting taxes, not paying them, thank you very much!&quot;

Elsewhere, newly-engaged actors Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner requested that the media stop calling them &quot;Bennifer,&quot; saying that they preferred to be called &quot;Afgarn.&quot;

Sequel to the controversial Matrix database

&quot;Florida law officials are contemplating a sequel to the controversial Matrix database that may be even more comprehensive than the original.

The Multistate Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange, or Matrix, contained billions of commercial and government records, and was intended to help police track down terrorists and kidnappers. But the system was shut down on April 15 when federal funds ran out. Considered overly invasive by many, the system&apos;s demise was celebrated by civil libertarians...Florida law enforcement officials want Matrix II to include more types of data than the original, including financial and insurance records, according to an April 12 for information from vendors.&quot;

Jesus Was No GOP Lobbyist

April 26, 2005

COMMENTARY

A tortured version of his message is being marketed for political gain.

By Jack Hitt, Jack Hitt is the author of &quot;Off the Road: A Modern-Day Walk Down the Pilgrim&apos;s Route Into Spain&quot; (Simon&amp;Schuster, 2005).

What would Jesus filibuster? The question is bizarre, of course, but the fact that many prominent religious and political leaders believe that there is an answer surely marks our time as pretty strange.

How quickly it has all happened — that the media, particularly television, has convinced itself that Christianity is little more than a Republican political action committee. When the pope died, CNN&apos;s Wolf Blitzer introduced former Clinton aide Paul Begala and right-wing pundit Robert Novak this way: &quot;Bob is a good Catholic; I&apos;m not so sure about Paul Begala.&quot; At the bottom of the screen, CNN ran an informative factoid for the audience: &quot;Many Catholic doctrines are conservative.&quot;

Broadcast media prefer to cast Christianity in the role of &quot;right-wing values PAC&quot; because it&apos;s so neat and tidy. They don&apos;t much like even to say the name Jesus on air because then we might have to talk about his ideas. &quot;Evangelical Christianity&quot; is much simpler because you can treat it as just another special-interest group, like the Teamsters or the neocons.

Leaders such as Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson and James Dobson have used the media to redefine Christianity as the &quot;Republican base&quot; — all between commercials hawking family-values videotapes or pleading for more contributions.

Gosh, WWJD? It makes me wax nostalgic for the days when people wore those bracelets and asked the question, &quot;What would Jesus do?&quot; At least people said his name then and pondered his ideas, using the question as the beginning of an engaged moral debate. Few would have appreciated those bracelets as much as the man himself — Jesus, who preached a new way of thinking about religion. Instead of taking orders from temple chieftains, Jesus provoked his followers into thinking for themselves. His preferred media outlet? A literary genre called the parable. It&apos;s a style of Q&amp;A;wherein the teacher doesn&apos;t give the answer but challenges the listener with a half-finished story that forces him to think through to the answer by himself. The radical right has swapped out this genius preacher for some easy listening. They insist that everything will be fine if we just nail the Ten Commandments above every courthouse.

Curious. Jesus updated the Ten Commandments in his most famous speech, the Sermon on the Mount. In it, one finds the Eight Beatitudes. Why don&apos;t we ever hear about nailing those somewhere? Here&apos;s why: It&apos;s not simply the law in the Ten Commandments that attracts fundamentalists. Rather, it&apos;s the syntax. The authoritarianism of so many &quot;Thou Shalt Nots.&quot;

The syntax of Jesus&apos; Eight Beatitudes is not so easy (Blessed are the poor in spirit…. Blessed are the peacemakers). These words invite the kind of hard questions that Jesus loved to tweak his followers with. How are they blessed? And why? It&apos;s just like Jesus to leave us with questions instead of answers.

The Jesus who speaks in the Gospels is nothing like the fuming Republican Jesus I see on TV now. Jesus was a leader who understood that ambiguity and doubt are not to be feared but are, simply, facts of life that a great teacher exploits to guide his followers on their own paths toward conviction and belief.

Here is a quote from Jesus that you almost never hear: &quot;What do you think?&quot; It&apos;s right there in the Bible. Jesus asks this question all the time.

One parable Jesus taught was this one, from Matthew: &quot;What do you think? A man had two sons. And he went to the first and said, &apos;Son, go and work in the vineyard today.&apos; And he answered, &apos;I will not,&apos; but afterward he changed his mind and went. And he went to the other son and said the same. And he answered, &apos;I go, sir,&apos; but did not go.&quot; Jesus&apos; disciples all strenuously raised their hands. They knew the answer! The first son was the most virtuous!

Whereupon Jesus (whose sense of humor is underrated) replied: &quot;Truly, I say to you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes go into the kingdom of God before you.&quot;

What does that parable mean? Frankly, I am not sure. I have my own thoughts, but they all feel tentative, and I can only hope I&apos;m right. Jesus doesn&apos;t accuse his disciples of being wrong; he just mocks the easiness of their quick answer.

Taken as a whole, it&apos;s not a parable with a clear and right answer. None of them are, and that is the point. You have to sort of toss it around in your head, think about people you&apos;ve dealt with who&apos;ve said one thing and done another, and then try to come to some answer. Chances are that few will agree in their interpretations, an outcome that is rhetorically so sly. Jesus makes you work through your own doubt and hesitation to arrive at an answer that becomes the very foundation of your own certainty.

This guy&apos;s good, isn&apos;t he?

But that Jesus is nowhere to be found on our televisions or in our newsweeklies. Ironically, mass-market Christians rarely cite or emphasize the living Jesus, the Jesus who speaks. They like their Christ dead. Or nearly dead, as in Mel Gibson&apos;s movie. In that film, the entire Sermon on the Mount — the most important words Jesus spoke — is relegated to a few seconds of flashback.

Yet the living Jesus always finds a way of getting past the money-changers, doesn&apos;t he? Every generation produces a Jesus to suit its own purposes. How fitting that in the Age of Information our broadcasters have marketed a Jesus so narrowly defined that he resembles little more than a lobbyist loitering outside Tom DeLay&apos;s office hoping for a few minutes of the great man&apos;s time.

But these people always underestimate the actual words that Jesus spoke. They are right there in the Gospels for those willing to hear Jesus, rather than rely upon videotape salesmen to re-interpret him as a furious political hack. The living Jesus will come again. It&apos;s the other meaning of being reborn.

Big Oil: High Prices, Record Profits / Behind the Hand-Holding: Bush and the Saudis

 Big Oil: High Prices, Record Profits 

 TYSON SLOCUM , tslocum@citizen.org, http://www.citizen.org/cmep,
http://www.niemanwatchdog.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Ask_this.view&amp;askthisid;=111

Research director for Public Citizen&apos;s Critical Mass Energy and Environment Program, Slocum said today: &quot;Since Bush took office, the largest five oil companies operating in the U.S. have after-tax profits of $205 billion. We need to examine the relationship between U.S. oil company profits and the higher prices for consumers and American industry. For example, in 2004, ExxonMobil -- the product of the 1999 merger between Exxon and Mobil -- chalked up the world&apos;s biggest-ever profit for a single company: $25.3 billion. Is it possible that ExxonMobil and other U.S. oil companies are making part of their profits off price gouging? It is possible that, just like Enron constricted supply in California by ordering power plants offline in order to create supply shortages to jack prices up, U.S. oil companies are keeping supplies offline and waiting to release those supplies until prices rise enough to make it worth their while?

The potential is there.&quot;

Williams is director of the Politics of Oil project at the Center for Public Integrity. He said today: &quot;We found that the oil industry here in the U.S. spends more than $440 million on candidates, political parties and lobbyists to carry its water in Washington, D.C.&quot;

Director of the Sustainable Energy and Economy Network and a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, Wysham is co-author of the report &quot;Wrong Turn from Rio: The World Bank&apos;s Road to Climate Catastrophe.&quot; She said today: &quot;Until we can lead the world, both by example and by investment,
toward a clean energy future, we will be taking ourselves and the rest of the world down a dead-end road of fossil fuel dependence. Placing Iraq war architect Paul Wolfowitz at the helm of the World Bank unfortunately continues a misguided policy -- of ensuring that taxpayer-financed institutions make oil and gas resources cheap for U.S. consumers. But we must wean ourselves off of this finite resource before it gets even more expensive, and the only way to do so is to make cleaner energy options cheaper and dirty energy options more expensive -- the opposite of what Bush is trying to do.&quot;

 Behind the Hand-Holding: Bush and the Saudis 

 AS&apos;AD ABUKHALIL , AAbukhalil@csustan.edu, http://angryarab.blogspot.com

AbuKhalil is author of the book &quot;The Battle for Saudi Arabia: Royalty, Fundamentalism, and Global Power,&quot; professor in the Department of Politics at California State University, Stanislaus, and visiting professor at University of California, Berkeley. He said today: &quot;The meeting today will cement the continued improvement in U.S.-Saudi relations despite criticism of the Saudi regime that emerged in the U.S. media after 9-11. The irony of this trip is that here is the head of one of the most oppressive governments in the world -- a religious dictatorship -- meeting with a U.S. president who continues to produce hollow rhetoric about democracy in the region. To the people of the region, this trip is not surprising. It&apos;s a continuation of decades-old U.S. policy of embracing &apos;convenient&apos; dictatorships, especially if they produce crude oil. It&apos;s unlikely that Bush will make mention of the prisoners of conscience suffering in Saudi prisons -- especially those who are also critical of the U.S. like professor of communications Sa&apos;id bin Zu&apos;ayr, who was sentenced to four years in jail after criticizing the U.S. government on Al-Jazeera.&quot;

 JAMES PAUL , james.paul@globalpolicy.org, http://www.globalpolicy.org

Executive director of the Global Policy Forum, Paul is author of the report &quot;Oil in Iraq: The Heart of the Crisis.&quot; Paul said today: &quot;The Bush administration would have the U.S. public believe that there&apos;s an unlimited supply of oil and that the nasty environmentalists and greedy sheiks are keeping oil from reaching consumers. It&apos;s a catastrophic lie. There is growing consensus that worldwide oil production is reaching its peak. The Saudis are now pumping very near full capacity and all of OPEC is operating at full tilt. OPEC has been trying to lower oil prices to keep the markets stable but without success. Worldwide demand is going up and supply can&apos;t rise to meet it. The U.S. is thirsty for more, the markets in China and India are growing rapidly, so market forces are driving prices higher and higher. The administration&apos;s plans for controlling Iraqi oil and
putting U.S. and U.K. companies in charge have thus far been a failure. Exxon&apos;s profits are setting new records, but the world&apos;s energy future is a chaos for which the oil giants are largely responsible.&quot;

Incomplete News Undermines US Values
By Peter Phillips

Dozens were kidnapped by roving gangs off the streets of their hometowns, disappeared from families, hooded, chained, repeatedly interrogated, incarcerated for years in military prisons, and then told it was all a mistake. Did this happen in Stalinist Russia, some South American military dictatorship, Apartheid South Africa? No, the gangs were special forces of the US Government operating with approval from the highest levels of the Pentagon, the victims Afghan civilians recently released from the Guantanamo military prison camp in Cuba.

The New York Times published an article April 20 reporting how 17 innocent Afghans were recently freed from Guantanamo prison after three and half years. &quot;Several of the Afghans said in interviews that they had been told by American officers that they were being freed because they were innocent of any crime,&quot; the article reported. &quot;The men would be given new clothes, turbans and travel money and allowed to go home,&quot; the paper disclosed.

Prior to the release of the Guantanamo prisoners last Fall, Seymour Hersh fully exposed the US&apos;s worldwide abuse of power and violation of human right in articles published in the Guardian and New Yorker. Hersh documented that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, with approval from the White House, had authorized a special-access program (SAP) to go on global manhunts for terrorists. It was deemed OK to kidnap suspected terrorists and take them to countries that would get tough (torture) them during interrogations. Several hundred people captured wholesale in Afghanistan and transported to Cuba were deemed enemy non-combatants without rights of due process or coverage under the Geneva Convention.

The New York Times&apos; story covers the release of the internees without Hersh&apos;s historical context of high level official approval. Additionally, the NY Times story fails to address coverage of how, in a country that supports due process and human rights, our military could take such tragic action violating the rights of these men and their families. Instead the story implies that the kidnapping of these Afghans was justified in that undoubtedly some of the prisoners were guilty. This is like rounding up the church choir because the minister was caught in bed with the organist.

Failure to publish the full truth regarding the release of the Afghan prisoners is a strong indication that the New York Times and corporate media groups in general are unable and unwilling to fully address human right violations by our own government. The broad publication of stories about the breach of human rights by our national security forces is inconsistent with corporate media&apos;s continuing desire to have 24 hour access to sources of news inside the White House, Pentagon and State Department. This failure of nerve to support the public&apos;s right to know and insure a transparent governmental process is undoubtedly giving America a black eye in the world community. Increasingly America is seen as an uncontrolled empire of power and abuse. For many in the world we are the Darth Vaders of the planet - pure evil incorporated.

Non-Americans know that the people in the US do not approve of these practices. We must, however, openly share their outrage and demand that America hold to our values of due process and human rights. To do this we must support media that address these issues. We need a media that post and recognize the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights in every newsroom. Anything less cuts at the very soul of the American people.

Newspapers Look at Increasingly Popular Payment Options for High Medical Costs

Access this story and related links online:

 http://www.kaisernetwork.org/daily_reports/rep_index.cfm?DR_ID=29572 

Two newspapers recently examined how increasing health care costs have contributed to some U.S. residents taking out reverse mortgages or filing for bankruptcy. Summaries appear below.

 Boston Globe : The Globe on Monday looked at the increasing number of senior citizens who are taking out &quot;reverse mortgages&quot; to pay for expenses including rising health care and dental costs. Reverse mortgages allow people to borrow against the equity in their home without repaying the amount until the house is sold. Housing and aging specialists say seniors not only use the money from reverse mortgages to pay bills and purchase prescription drugs, but also to &quot;upgrade their lifestyle.&quot; The number of seniors in the United States who took out reverse mortgages doubled in 2004 to more than 40,000, compared with 2003, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. HUD Federal Housing Commissioner John Weicher said he believes that number will continue to increase as baby boomers retire. However, Ric Edelman, president of Edelman Financial Services, said he thinks such mortgages are &quot;pretty terrible.&quot; Edelman said the loans can have high upfront costs and interest rates. In addition, the home owner could face foreclosure if costs related to taxes and insurance for the house are not met (Robertson, Boston Globe, 4/25).

 Chicago Tribune : The Tribune on Sunday examined the &quot;several thousand Americans driven to financial ruin each year by sometimes-life-threatening illness or injury&quot; who file for bankruptcy. Many people who file for bankruptcy are middle-class homeowners who had health insurance but became &quot;overwhelmed by copayments, deductibles and uncovered services,&quot; the Tribune reports. According to Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard Law School professor and co-author of a study on medical-related bankruptcies, said, &quot;Many of these families were hit by a one-two punch. They got sick and lost time from work, so their incomes went down. And then they got hit with huge medical bills. The combination was fatal&quot; (Loten, Chicago Tribune, 4/24).

&apos;NUCLEAR OPTION&apos; FIGHT BREWING--

A major fight is brewing in the Senate over two extremist judicial nominees after the Senate Judiciary Committee sent previously blocked nominations of Janice Rogers Brown and Patricia Owen to the full Senate. The move sets the stage for Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) to attempt to push through the nominations by eliminating the right to filibuster judicial nominees, a move so explosive it is called the &quot;nuclear option.&quot; Both Brown and Owen have troubling records on working family issues. Brown, from California, once called programs such as Social Security &quot;cannibalization&quot; by senior citizens. Owen, a Texas Supreme Court justice, authored or joined opinions that undermine the state workers&apos; compensation system and the right of workers to seek redress in court for job injuries.

What do you believe is true even though you cannot prove it?

Progress.

The enterprise that employs me, seeking to understand and apply insight into how the world works, is ultimately based on the belief that this is a good thing to do. But it&apos;s something of a leap of faith to believe that that will leave the world a better place—the evidence to date is mixed for technical advances monotonically mapping onto human advances.

Naturally, this question has a technical spin for me. My current passion is the creation of tools for personal fabrication based on additive digital assembly, so that the uses of advanced technologies can be defined by their users. It&apos;s still no more than an assumption that that will lead to more good things than bad things being made, but, like the accumulated experience that democracy works better than monarchy, I have more faith in a future based on widespread access to the means for invention than one based on technocracy.

Thought-Controlled Machines May Be One Step Closer

Stefan Lovgren for National Geographic News

 http://news.nationalgeographic.com 

April 12, 2005

Scientists have made a brain discovery that could help lead to thought-controlled machines. Recent experiments have shown that a little-understood part of the brain that we use to process information about objects also plays a role when we move a hand or other limb.

Researchers made the key discovery when they studied the brain activity of several patients with electrodes surgically implanted in their brains.

The scientists found that an area of the brain called the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, located near our temples, processes spatial information--information related to movements that we are about to make.

Borowitz Report - bafflement shocker

BUSH ADMITS HE NO LONGER UNDERSTANDS HIS SOCIAL SECURITY PROPOSAL
Orders Worldwide Manhunt to Find Someone Who Does

During a speech in Flint, Michigan today, President Bush sent shockwaves through the debate about Social Security by admitting that he no longer understands his own proposal for revamping the nation&apos;s retirement program.

The Flint speech had been billed as a pep rally of sorts for the president&apos;s ambitious Social Security overhaul, which made his candid admission that he could not &quot;make heads or tails of the darned thing&quot; all the more surprising.

&quot;I have read it over and over and over again, and I&apos;ve got to tell you, I do not have a clue what it means,&quot; Mr. Bush told his audience, many of whom audibly gasped. &quot;I had an easier time figuring out The Da Vinci Code.&quot;

At the White House, spokesman Scott McClellan acknowledged that Mr. Bush&apos;s bafflement over his own Social Security proposal may push back implementation of the controversial plan: &quot;According to current estimates, it is highly unlikely that the president will actually understand this plan any time before the year 2029.&quot;

To speed up that timetable, Mr. McClellan said that Mr. Bush is ordering a worldwide manhunt to find someone who can understand his Social Security proposal and explain it to him &quot;as soon as possible.&quot;

&quot;And if that person turns out to be Osama bin Laden, we&apos;ll be killing two birds with one stone,&quot; Mr. McClellan added.

Elsewhere, in a sign of improving relations between the two countries, India and Pakistan announced today that they would transform the disputed region of Kashmir into a gigantic calling center to handle customer service questions from U.S. computer users.

That Other America

By Bob Burnett, AlterNet. Posted April 25, 2005.

Once, Republicans were the party of the upper class; Democrats represented the middle and lower class. Now, many poor voters are faith voters and the issue of moral values trumps economic concerns.

1962 saw the publication of Michael Harrington&apos;s insightful study, The Other America, which vividly described the harried lives of America&apos;s poor. This week two polls were released that portrayed another vision of desperation in America, one that progressives are still struggling to understand. Both surveys focused on the voting group termed &quot;faith voters,&quot; roughly one-third of the electorate. Faith voters believe that &quot;moral values&quot; is a big issue, in many instances the one issue that decides their vote.

When Democrats gathered in Washington to hear Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair, Howard Dean, give a status report on his first two months in office, they were shown the results of a new poll conducted by Cornell Belcher. This, and a similar Mellman Group survey funded by the powerful EMILY&apos;s List political action committee, indicated that the class distinctions that historically distinguished Republicans from Democrats are being replaced by cultural differences. Once it was accurate to characterize the GOP as the party of the upper class and the bourgeoisie, and Democrats as the party of the lower class and the struggling middle class. The two polls indicate that now it is more precise to describe Republican voters as those who care a lot about moral values and go to church often; in contrast, Democratic voters aren&apos;t as concerned about moral values and attend church infrequently, if ever.

Taken in conjunction with the results of the 2004 presidential election, these polls clarify the nature of the Democrats&apos; numbers problem. Historically, no matter how good the economy might be, there were always more American poor than rich, and therefore, Democrats always had a numerical superiority over Republicans; in any given election, if Democrats could manage to get out the vote, they would win. Now that familiar formula has changed. Many poor voters are faith voters and the issue of moral values trumps their economic concerns.

According to the Belcher survey, faith voters are worried about issues such as the economy and the deteriorating situation in Iraq, but their number one anxiety is moral values. In the last election, they believed George W. Bush shared their concern, and this proved to be a decisive factor in determining their vote.

Most progressives regard this behavior as perplexing, if not self-destructive. In his recent best-seller, What&apos;s the Matter with Kansas? How Conservatives Won the Heart of America, Thomas Frank depicted faith voters as rubes who foolishly vote against their own self interest because they are, in effect, blinded by the light of their Christian practice.

DNC chair Howard Dean appeared to have a deeper understanding of this cultural divide. He pointed out that while the American economy is struggling, many Democratic partisans are not unduly anxious about economic issues. In contrast, faith voters -- Dean characterized them as &quot;backlash Republicans&quot; or &quot;Reagan Democrats&quot; -- are caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place. Typically both the husband and wife work to make ends meet; often they have more than one job. The family is under extreme economic pressure. They see themselves on the edge of homelessness, a couple of missed paychecks or one serious illness away from losing everything they have. But what the parents are most worried about are their kids.

Dean continued that faith voters typically spend so much time at work that they don&apos;t have the opportunity, or the money, to provide their children with adequate supervision. As a result, the parents are obsessed with the notion that television, other kids, or lefty teachers will corrupt their sons and daughters. Driving to and from work faith voters constantly hear conservative commentators rail against the liberal &quot;media elite,&quot; whom they accuse of advocating various forms of immorality: drug use, free love, abortion on demand, and so forth. Because they live in this environment of fear, faith voters accept wild accusations as the gospel; for example, that the National Educational Association has an agenda to teach homosexuality as a lifestyle &quot;choice.&quot;

Howard Dean observed that many Democrats are too quick to dismiss the behavior of faith voters. He noted that this group truly believes that a liberal Democratic elite is corrupting America. Dean&apos;s analysis was that in the last election, faith voters trusted George W. Bush to do the right thing to stem the tide of immorality; they accepted Bush&apos;s campaign rhetoric, &quot;The Democrats don&apos;t respect you. They don&apos;t understand your problems because they are the elite. But I do respect you. ... I&apos;m just a regular guy.&quot;

The DNC chair commented that the typical Democratic response to the fears of faith voters has been to offer them programs: health care, child care, and the like. For various reasons this hasn&apos;t worked. Dean remarked that the Belcher poll showed that 54 percent of the voter sample believed that &quot;a decline in our moral values&quot; was a bigger obstacle to raising strong families than were jobs, health care, and quality education.

Identifying the wrong people

Article Published: Sunday, April 17, 2005

By Ed Quillen

So far, the people in charge of making sure there are no normal querulous American citizens present at President George W. Bush&apos;s visits have had a pretty easy job of it.

The president has been touring the country at our expense to promote changes in the Social Security system, and he speaks at &quot;town meetings.&quot; At one such event in Arizona, a student was barred from entering because he wore a Young Democrats T-shirt - something simple to spot.

In North Dakota in early February, the local GOP machine compiled a list of 42 people who could not be given tickets to the presidential appearance. That might sound more difficult than just inspecting T-shirts, but with a few days&apos; notice, any right-thinking political activist could compile a list of locals who might ask embarrassing questions if they were allowed inside.

And they had an easy time of it in Colorado when Bush spoke at the Wings Over the Rockies Museum in Denver on March 21. It was a dead giveaway, for the potential disrupters arrived in a car with a bumper sticker that said &quot;No More Blood for Oil.&quot;

The three people in that car were asked to leave by a man they thought was a Secret Service agent, since he wore an earpiece and a dark blue suit. It now appears that this was just an overzealous volunteer who wanted to be sure that the presidential visit went smoothly.

It&apos;s hard to understand why they&apos;re so worried about this. The president certainly has enough campaign skill to handle the occasional heckler. Even if he gets a substantive question, he should be able to parry it, as he did at other stops in March, with some inscrutable statement like, &quot;If they pre-decease or die early, there&apos;s an asset base to be able to pass on to a loved one,&quot; or, &quot;In terms of timetables, as quickly as possible, whatever that means.&quot;

Nonetheless, there are people who see it as their duty to make sure that only the right kind of people attend public political events.

And so far, the wrong kind have made it easy for them with opposition-party T-shirts and pacifistic bumper stickers. But even if the potential presidential questioners give up on those, it shouldn&apos;t be that hard to spot them.

After all, how many Republicans drive Volvos? And how many Democrats wouldn&apos;t be caught dead in a Hummer? A simple parking-lot entry screening might miss a few misfits, but it should be faster and easier than having to read all the bumper stickers.

And if those potential troublemakers try to get around that by walking, bicycling or taking the bus to the event - well, that&apos;s a dead giveaway that they&apos;re not performing their patriotic duty to burn every available drop of oil, and thus cannot be trusted to remain silent at a &quot;town meeting.&quot;

Instituting a dress code for presidential speeches is another easy step. Allow men in suits and women with perms, along with well-groomed teens. To be safe, make sure the cost of the required raiments runs into four figures, and that should keep the rabble away.

There is, of course, another way for the president to communicate directly with citizens, and vice-versa.

I doubt that I agree with our senior senator, Wayne Allard, on much of anything political. But he&apos;s held more than 700 town meetings since taking office, in every one of our 64 counties. All people are welcome, no matter what they drive or wear. I know that, because I&apos;ve been to several of them.

Allard does get a few softball questions lobbed by the local Republicans, but he also gets hard questions from other folks, and he handles them all. He explains where he stands and why, and he does listen to us common folk - after one tour, he decided to oppose recreation-access fees for public lands.

Allard is among those who do not believe that people should be removed on account of a bumper sticker. President Bush and his fans could do a lot worse than to follow Allard&apos;s example.

Stuck In The Middle


President Bush signed the egregious bankruptcy bill yesterday, thereby making it much tougher for middle-class Americans to get out of debt following a major setback—like being laid off from work or suffering a medical emergency. But the bankruptcy bill isn&apos;t the only barometer of this Congress&apos; overarching disregard for middle-income families and their lives. The Drum Major Institute&apos;s

 http://www.drummajorinstitute.org/ 

analysis of congressional legislation from 2004 affecting the middle class found that neither chamber of Congress adequately supports the middle class—and more than 90 percent of Republicans consistently voted against working families.

Have you heard of the Healthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access To Care Act?

 http://www.themiddleclass.org/main.cfm?actionId=globalShowStaticContent&amp;screenKey;=legislation&amp;htmlId;=2495#a2495 

Sounds good, no? It&apos;s actually a law that would have limited malpractice awards to women whose babies sustained brain injuries because of doctors&apos; delivery mistakes. (Thankfully, this bill died in a Senate vote after failing to get a majority.) Or how about the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ?

http://www.themiddleclass.org/main.cfm?actionId=globalShowStaticContent&amp;screenKey;=legislation&amp;htmlId;=2492#a2492

That one was signed into law last October after receiving majority votes in both the House and Senate. Despite its name, the bill provides huge tax cuts for special interests and offers no guarantee that a single job will be created.

The report from the Drum Major Institute—a nonprofit, nonpartisan group working for social and economic fairness in public policy—analyzed all bills from 2004 that would have a substantial impact on the middle class and graded Congress members&apos; support for them. Among the main findings :

Neither chamber of Congress did an adequate job of supporting the middle class. In both the House and the Senate, about half the members passed, half failed and less than a quarter received A&apos;s.
Despite a more lenient grading system than last year’s report, Congress did significantly worse overall in 2004.

No free lunches for pensioners

Bush&apos;s deceptive plans for the US social security system show why privatisation is not the answer to the global pensions crisis

Joseph Stiglitz
Tuesday April 19, 2005
The Guardian

It is almost an optical illusion: looming on Japan&apos;s horizon, and on Europe&apos;s and on America&apos;s, is a pensions crisis. The problem is real, though exaggerated. The illusion is in some of the plans being devised to deal with it. The main question is whether privatising pension systems, as George Bush has proposed for social security in the United States, would solve the problem or merely make matters worse. With many countries pondering whether to adopt variants of the Bush plan, the question requires careful examination.

By itself, privatisation is clearly not the solution. America&apos;s troubled private pension system - now several hundred billion dollars in debt - already appears to be heading for a government bail-out. There was a time when privatisation - allowing individuals to set up individual savings accounts - seemed better than social security, which invests in lower-yielding Treasury bills (government bonds). Advocates of privatisation argued that funds would do much better if invested in stocks, predicting a return of 9%. But the stock market does not guarantee returns; it does not even guarantee that the stock values will keep up with inflation - and there have been periods in which they have not. America&apos;s social security system insulates individuals against the vagaries of the market and inflation, providing a form of insurance that the private market does not offer.

It does so with remarkable efficiency. The costs of managing the social security system are far smaller than those likely to be associated with privatised accounts. This is understandable: private investment firms spend an enormous amount on marketing and salaries.

It is possible that to reduce these transaction costs, Bush will propose restricting choice, which was the main argument for privatisation in the first place. But these limited kinds of choices - for example, a T-bill fund with 90% in T-bills and 10% in an indexed stock fund - could easily be introduced into the public social security system.

Bush says that reform is urgently needed, because the system will be insolvent in about a quarter of a century. But the problem depends on America&apos;s growth rate: if the growth rates of the late 1990s return, there is no problem. Even if there is a problem, it can easily be fixed: spending a fraction of the money that went into Bush&apos;s two tax cuts would have fixed social security for 75 years; slight benefit cuts, adjusting the age of retirement, or minor adjustments in the level of contributions could fix the system permanently.

Moreover, Bush&apos;s proposals won&apos;t fix social security - unless they are accompanied by drastic benefit cuts. For how could they? He proposes diverting almost a third of the social security tax to private accounts. That means less money coming in. If benefits are not reduced, the gap between receipts and expenditures will increase. One doesn&apos;t need a Nobel prize to figure that out.

So privatisation would not protect retirees against the social security system&apos;s insolvency; it would merely add enormously to today&apos;s fiscal deficit, because partial privatisation entails diverting money to private funds that would have been used to close the gap between government expenditures and revenue.

The anticipated increase in the fiscal deficit is striking. The central plan discussed by Bush&apos;s council of economic advisers would - according to the council&apos;s own estimates - increase America&apos;s fiscal deficit by $2 trillion over the next decade. Advocates of privatisation claim to believe in markets, but they are proposing budget gimmickry that would move those losses off the books, as if markets could be easily fooled.

America and the world should remember: Argentina&apos;s privatisation of its pension system was at the centre of its recent fiscal woes. Had Argentina not privatised, its budget would have been roughly in balance. The US is starting on its privatisation venture with a fiscal deficit of 4% of GDP.

Privatisation advocates insist, however, that investments in stocks would yield sufficiently higher returns to give individuals the same retirement income as before, with the surplus used to fill the gap. But if markets are working well, then returns will be higher only because risk is higher. There is still no free lunch in economics.

With higher risk, there is a chance that, 40 years from now, many individuals will find themselves with less than they need to retire. But if one really thinks that free lunches exist, there is still no reason to privatise: the government could get the additional returns by investing in the stock market itself. Indeed, President Clinton proposed doing just that.

With increased transaction costs, worsening solvency for the system, increased budget deficits and decreasing benefits and security for retirees, why the drive for privatisation? One reason is the interest financial markets have in grabbing a piece of all those transaction costs. A second is the Bush administration&apos;s ideological hostility to the modest amount of wealth redistribution implied by the public system. America&apos;s social security programme has been so successful in reducing poverty because the poor get back a little more than they contribute, and the rich get back a little less.

Even with social security&apos;s mildly redistributive effect, poverty and inequality in America are increasing. Privatisation will only make matters worse.

Bush has tried to scare America about the magnitude of the problem, and he has tried to fool America about how privatisation would solve it. The social security deficit pales by comparison with the deficits created by Bush&apos;s huge tax cuts for upper-income Americans or in comparison with the deficit in Medicare, which provides healthcare for the aged. Why has he ignored these problems? Is there another agenda?

 http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A59539-2005Apr16.html 

As happened with neighboring Indonesia, &quot;the 9/11 attacks opened the door to improved U.S.-Malaysia relations.&quot; The Heritage Foundation began promoting Malaysia in mid-2001, &quot;at the same time a Hong Kong consulting firm co-founded by Edwin J. Feulner, Heritage&apos;s president, began representing Malaysian business interests.&quot; The firm, Belle Haven Consultants, lists Feulner&apos;s wife and Heritage consultant Ken Sheffer among its staff. &quot;To help represent Malaysian clients,&quot; Belle Haven hired the Republican lobbying firm Alexander Strategy Group. &quot;Experts say that the relationship between one of Washington&apos;s most influential conservative think tanks and a network of lobbying firms collecting fees from Malaysian business interests - well in excess of $1 million over two years - could pose a problem for Heritage&apos;s status as a nonprofit group,&quot; reports the Washington Post.

&quot;WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE IS TRUE EVEN THOUGH YOU CANNOT PROVE IT?&quot; - JOSEPH LEDOUX

Great minds can sometimes guess the truth before they have either the evidence or arguments for it (Diderot called it having the &quot;esprit de divination&quot;). What do you believe is true even though you cannot prove it

 http://www.edge.org/q2005/q05_print.html 

 JOSEPH LEDOUX 
Neuroscientist, New York University; Author, The Synaptic Self

For me, this is an easy question. I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness, but neither I, nor anyone else, has been able to prove it. We can&apos;t even prove that other people are conscious, much less other animals. In the case of other people, though, we at least can have a little confidence since all people have brains with the same basic configurations. But as soon as we turn to other species and start asking questions about feelings, and consciousness in general, we are in risky territory because the hardware is different.

When a rat is in danger, it does things that many other animals do. That is, it either freezes, runs away or fights back. People pretty much do the same things. Some scientists say that because a rat and a person act the same in similar situations, they have the same kinds of subjective experiences. I don&apos;t think we can really say this.

There are two aspects of brain hardware that make it difficult for us to generalize from our personal subjective experiences to the experiences of other animals. One is the fact that the circuits most often associated with human consciousness involve the lateral prefrontal cortex (via its role in working memory and executive control functions). This broad zone is much more highly developed in people than in other primates, and whether it exists at all in non-primates is questionable. So certainly for those aspects of consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including aspects that allow us to know who we are and to make plans and decisions, there is reason to believe that even other primates might be different than people. The other aspect of the brain that differs dramatically is that humans have natural language. Because so much of human experience is tied up with language, consciousness is often said to depend on language. If so, then most other animals are ruled out of the consciousness game. But even if consciousness doesn&apos;t depend on language, language certainly changes consciousness so that whatever consciousness another animal has it is likely to differ from most of our states of consciousness.

For these reasons, I think it is hard to know what consciousness might be like in another animal. If we can&apos;t measure it (because it is internal and subjective) and can&apos;t use our own experience to frame questions about it (because the hardware that makes it possible is different), it become difficult to study.

Most of what I have said applies mainly to the content of conscious experience. But there is another aspect of consciousness that is less problematic scientifically. It is possible to study the processes that make consciousness possible even if we can&apos;t study the content of consciousness in other animals. This is exactly what is done in studies of working memory in non-human primates. One approach by that has had some success in the area of conscious content in non-human primates has focused on a limited kind of consciousness, visual awareness. But this approach, by Koch and Crick, mainly gets at the neural correlates of consciousness rather than the causal mechanisms. The correlates and the mechanisms may be the same, but they may not. Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of prefrontal cortex in making visual awareness possible.

So what about feelings? My view is that a feeling is what happens when an emotion system, like the fear system, is active in a brain that can be aware of its own activities. That is, what we call &quot;fear&quot; is the mental state that we are in when the activity of the defense system of the brain (or the consequences of its activity, such as bodily responses) is what is occupying working memory. Viewed this way, feelings are strongly tied to those areas of the cortex that are fairly unique to primates and especially well developed in people. When you add natural language to the brain, in addition to getting fairly basic feelings you also get fine gradations due to the ability to use words and grammar to discriminate and categorize states and to attribute them not just to ourselves but to others.

There are other views about feelings. Damasio argues that feelings are due to more primitive activity in body sensing areas of the cortex and brainstem. Pankseep has a similar view, though he focuses more on the brainstem. Because this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could therefore be involved in feelings that are shared across species. I don&apos;t object to this on theoretical grounds, but I don&apos;t think it can be proven because feelings can&apos;t be measured in other animals. Pankseep argues that if it looks like fear in rats and people, it probably feels like fear in both species. But how do you know that rats and people feel the same when they behave the same? A cockroach will escape from danger--does it, too, feel fear as it runs away? I don&apos;t think behavioral similarity is sufficient grounds for proving experiential similarity. Neural similarity helps—rats and people have similar brainstems, and a roach doesn&apos;t even have a brain. But is the brainstem responsible for feelings? Even if it were proven in people, how would you prove it in a rat?

So now we&apos;re back where we started. I think rats and other mammals, and maybe even roaches (who knows?), have feelings. But I don&apos;t know how to prove it. And because I have reason to think that their feelings might be different than ours, I prefer to study emotional behavior in rats rather than emotional feelings. I study rats because you can make progress at the neural level, provided that the thing you measure is the same in rats and people. I wouldn&apos;t study language and consciousness in rats, so I don&apos;t study feelings either, because I don&apos;t know that they exist. I may be accused of being short-sighted for this, but I&apos;d rather make progress on something I can study in rats than beat my head against the consciousness wall in these creatures.

There&apos;s lots to learn about emotion through rats that can help people with emotional disorders. And there&apos;s lots we can learn about feelings from studying humans, especially now that we have powerful function imaging techniques. I&apos;m not a radical behaviorist. I&apos;m just a practical emotionalist.

Bush Encounters Hurdles on Energy Agenda

WASHINGTON -- Running for president five years ago, George W. Bush pledged to jawbone energy-exporting nations to keep oil prices low and to win passage of legislation to spur more domestic energy production. Delivering on either count has proved difficult for the Texas oilman.

Soaring oil and gasoline prices are beginning to take a toll on U.S. economic growth and on Bush&apos;s approval ratings. To get his long-stalled energy agenda passed, the president is putting more of his political prestige on the line.

The House voted 249-183 last week for White House-backed legislation that would give tax cuts and subsidies to energy companies and open a wildlife refuge in Alaska to oil exploration.

At a meeting Monday at his Texas ranch, Bush is promising to press Saudi Arabia&apos;s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Abdullah, to do more to help ease global oil prices. Still, the president acknowledges that there is little that he or Congress can do to quickly lower gasoline prices, which have climbed past $2.20 a gallon nationwide.

Critics also claim that Bush&apos;s energy bill does little to promote conservation or alternate energy approaches, and that he has done little of the lobbying of oil-country leaders that he promised during in his first presidential campaign.

Robert Ebel, an energy analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said nothing that Bush is proposing &quot;is going to have any immediate, or even near-term impact&quot; on prices.

Bush s responding politically to consumer concerns that &quot;gasoline prices are high, we haven&apos;t yet entered the summer driving season, and what is the president going to do about it?&quot; Ebel said.

Ebel said increasing world demand for oil, particularly from fast-growing China, and lack of new refineries in the United States will exacerbate the problem for years.

With his Social Security overhaul plan winning few converts, Bush may find that promoting his energy agenda has a more immediate political payoff for jittery Republicans.

In a last week, Bush said high prices are &quot;like a foreign tax on the American dream.&quot; He challenged Congress to send him an energy bill by August and described the proposal as making energy &quot;more affordable and secure&quot; in the future.

Similar legislation passed the House twice in Bush&apos;s first term, only to bog down in the Senate under a Democratic filibuster that was waged, in part, to protest possible exploratory drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.

Crude oil prices have risen 40 percent in the past year. But finding ways to curb them pose a particular dilemma for Bush - complicated by his own actions.

The war in Iraq, for instance, limited Bush&apos;s influence among Persian Gulf oil-producing nations.

The president recently ruled out releasing oil from the nation&apos;s emergency stockpile, saying he would only tap the 700 million barrel reserve in a national crisis.

Bush criticized President Clinton for tapping into the reserve in 2000, suggesting it was a political gesture to help Vice President Al Gore, then Bush&apos;s Democratic rival for the White House.

Bush also criticized the Clinton administration for not lobbying the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, saying Clinton &quot;must jawbone OPEC members to lower prices.&quot; Yet as president, Bush mostly has emphasized that market forces should set world oil prices.

In a CNBC interview, Bush said he would press the Saudi crown prince to boost production. &quot;I&apos;ll be talking to our friends about making sure they understand that if they pinch the world economy too much, it&apos;ll affect their ability to sell crude oil in the long run,&quot; Bush said.

Still, he said, there was a chance the Saudis already were pumping crude at &quot;near capacity&quot; levels. Ahead of the crown prince&apos;s visit, Saudi Arabia said it would do what it could to step up oil production.

Saudi oil minister Ali Naimi said the kingdom is now pumping about 9.5 million barrels per day and could increase that to 12.5 million barrels per day by 2009 if necessary to maintain &quot;market stability.&quot;

But, he told a conference in Paris, &quot;The measures taken by OPEC in general and by Saudi Arabia in particular are only a few factors among those which affect oil prices; consequently, our influence is limited.&quot;

Bush&apos;s expected appeal to the Saudi leader already is drawing scorn from some Democrats. &quot;The president is right to meet with this powerful man, but it is wrong that the leader of the United States must ask favors from a foreign prince,&quot; Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., said Saturday in his party&apos;s weekly radio address.

Jerry Taylor, an energy analyst at the Cato Institute, a Washington-based think tank that advocates less government regulation, said the idea that &quot;jawboning OPEC or arranging for nice relations with OPEC will somehow get us more oil is utter illusion.&quot;

&quot;The Saudis will produce as much oil as they think is necessary to maximize revenue. Period,&quot; Taylor said. China&apos;s rising thirst for oil, not supply shortages, is the main factor driving up global oil prices, he and other oil analysts suggested.

Conversations With Gary (Gary Cowger Group Vice President for Global Manufacturing for GM)

Posted on Thu, Apr. 21, 2005

Wheels

GM’s executives are more than capable, but they’ve got to start dealing with the problem of GroupThink

By Ed Wallace

Special to the Star-Telegram

&quot;Those 1 million Impalas were sold in a year when only 8 million Americans purchased a new car. Today, Chrysler would have to sell 2,125,000 copies of its 300 to equal the percentage of the new car market that the Impala held 40 years ago.&quot;

Lately the press has been openly, frequently doubting that the Big Two of Detroit, GM and Ford, can survive in the cutthroat environment that we refer to as the modern automobile industry. Only three years ago, the automotive press was also lumping Chrysler into the category of companies whose survival was questionable. Today those same writers suggest that GM and Ford should emulate Chrysler’s game plan — which is nothing more than coming up with extremely hot cars that the market devours. But, while it would be nice if every GM division introduced one car as popular as the Chrysler 300, the problems facing Detroit are the same ones facing all American manufacturing: the fundamental costs of doing business and their uncontrollably rising spiral.

While no one is yet willing to dig the graves for our domestic automobile manufacturers, one can hear the faint cries of the press calling for volunteers to be pallbearers. But this situation is not new; those same predictions about the fate of Detroit have been heard in 1973, 1979 and 1991. Moreover, each and every time Detroit’s mainstays have reset their jibs and come about, sailing back in fine financial trim.

More than likely one of the factors hurting the auto industry has been the housing market boom of the last few years, caused by 40-year-low interest rates: few potential homebuyers move into their next car while their mortgage applications are being processed. And then there are always lots of things to purchase for the new property before they can even think about another car. In time, though, most new homebuyers do move back into the car market, to keep up with their neighbors. This business cycle has recurred predictably since the end of the Second World War.

GM’s Glory Days

Lots of people may not, but one spy listens closely to our weekend radio show, often relaying comments we’ve made about General Motors to their head office in Detroit within days of our broadcast. Having met her in person, I can say that she couldn’t be a lovelier person; further, she’s connected to the seat of power at GM. Mindy’s father is Gary Cowger, now Group Vice President for Global Manufacturing for GM, formerly President of GM North America. I would guess it’s through that connection that Gary has joined me on our show numerous times. And, while I could be wrong about this, I believe there is a great deal of mutual respect for what we both do.

The reason for my respect is the fact that Cowger came up the hard way through the GM system, starting at the Kansas City assembly plant in 1965 — which, in my opinion, was the high point in General Motors’ history. In that year, the Chevrolet Impala sold more than 1 million units. These days that number doesn’t sound as huge as it is, but selling a million of one model is a remarkable feat, which no other car manufacturer has ever accomplished. Even more astonishing, those 1 million Impalas were sold in a year when only 8 million Americans purchased a new car. Today, Chrysler would have to sell 2,125,000 copies of its 300 to equal the same percentage of the new car market that the Impala held 40 years ago.

That alone, I hope, explains both the motivation of GM’s executives and why they often feel unfairly singled out for media punishment, too often portrayed as a company that can’t seem to do anything right: GM was once the undisputed king of popular automobiles in America. If there’s one thing GM might do to improve its situation today, it is quit thinking small and start figuring out a way to create another car so incredibly popular that it could dominate the market, like the ’65 Impala did. And that was the automotive world in which the 18-year-old Gary Cowger met his lifelong employer.

Over the years, he moved through running GM’s factories to taking over as head of GM Mexico, then becoming chairman of Opel in Germany and moving on up into his current position with the company. He’s been there for GM during two energy crises and numerous recessions — and constant media pounding because General Motors no longer controls half of the American market.

In fact, for many years I was one of GM’s harshest critics. Well, so many things that they put in place not only had absolutely nothing to do with selling cars but frankly — I frequently said — set General Motors on paths that would hurt their business. Unfortunately, time has often proven me right.

They Hate It When I’m Right

In spite of my critical stance, Cowger and I established an immediate rapport. Our liking for each other makes our on-air conversations sound as if we’ve known each other since the early days of our careers with GM — Cowger in manufacturing and me in retail. However, it is our conversations off the air that probably have had the most influence on how we view each other.

Gary was stunned to hear what both Toyota and Honda had informed certain dealers — that, while they had little faith in the long-term viability of hydrogen fuel-celled cars, they both believe that by 2025 most of their sales will be hybrid electric automobiles. Moreover, while it was only educated speculation, I suggested that both Japanese automakers believed that within two decades they could achieve that elusive 80-mile-per-gallon family sedan that Washington promised us over a decade ago.

During that same off-air conversation early last year, I shocked Gary by suggesting that oil might well hit $60 a barrel by year’s end, and as a result gasoline would sell for $1.95 nationally, falling back to $1.75 by late fall. (GM’s internal audit forecast the opposite.) Then I predicted just how much of an incentive GM would have to put on its full-sized SUVs to keep the market moving when gasoline prices peaked. I missed the price of oil by $2 and the price of gas by a dime — and I nailed the incentive.

GroupThink Targets Only High-level Meetings

None of this is meant to suggest that Gary isn’t by far smarter than I am. Part of the problem may be what I always say when Detroit execs ask me how I can be so contrary in the face of what they think is common knowledge: “If I sat in the same meetings that you have to sit through and listened to the same arguments and sales points on the items we’re discussing, I would come to the exact same conclusion that you have come to.”

Fortunately, I don’t live inside the tunnel that they inhabit. Instead, sitting on the outside, I talk with dealers and real consumers, which makes it easy to pick the right side of the issue. Yes, Detroit’s real problem is called GroupThink — and it’s been the bane of every failed or failing American corporation for the last century.

Every major corporation that I can think of started with one person’s vision — something he or she had created that would find a large and willing consumer audience. In fact, the more audacious the vision, the more iconic both founder and company have become in our business history because of their resounding success. Any corporation also has builders and caretakers, depending on the phase of the business cycle it’s in. The first-generation innovator demands of others what he or she needs done to succeed. The second generation’s builders finally put a structure to their founder’s brilliant but erratic vision. And the third generation, that of caretakers, holds non-stop executive meetings, trying to recreate old magic instead of dreaming up new and darling, must-have consumer items.

And because they’re not daring innovators creating, but rather safety-conscious caretakers guarding, the meetings grow more numerous and the cautionary voices fewer … and GroupThink finds a welcome. The illusion of invulnerability, contempt and dismissal for critics, pressure on members to conform, and the delusion that agreeing on them makes the group’s decisions correct are all symptoms of this dread disease. Born in groups of smart, cautious people under pressure, GroupThink blossoms with the exercise of power.

Clean Points = Hotter Spark

Besides its self-retarded spark, General Motors’ other problems today are high costs for raw materials, high cost of health care and retirement benefits, and high gas prices’ spooking their customers. Certainly it’s those issues that Gary Cowger is now charged with fixing for GM. (OK, not the gas situation, but that will likely correct itself over the coming year.) Unlike others, I know the executives at GM and Cowger in particular; and, while I hate to go out on a limb, if these guys can’t do it, no one can.

So here are my suggestions for Detroit. Thin the ranks by getting rid of executives whose past predictions of consumer preferences have been consistently wrong. And then, with a much leaner staff, give more authority to those who have shown moments of brilliance in the past. Certainly they will make mistakes, but the things they do right will be home runs.

And maybe, just maybe, while retro automobiles are so in vogue with the public, the next generation of the Impala should be a retro-update of the 1.1 million-selling 1965 model. After all, look at the mileage Ford is getting out of its new Mustang.

Wal-Mart&apos;s Free Market Fallacy

Jonathan Tasini
April 21, 2005

Jonathan Tasini is president of the Economic Future Group and writes his &quot;Working In America&quot; columns for TomPaine.com on an occasional basis.

Conservatives run around singing the praises of Wal-Mart, proclaiming it an American success story. None other than Dick Cheney calls the Beast of Bentonville his favorite company. But what I love about Wal-Mart is the way the company highlights the phoniness of two centerpieces of the conservative movement’s sloganeering propaganda: the so-called &quot;free market&quot; and &quot;local control.&quot;

In the mythical world of the free market—for which Wal-Mart supposedly serves as a shining example—prices for goods and labor should rise and fall based on the magic of the &quot;invisible hand&quot; of market supply and demand. In the nirvana of the so-called free market, workers can sell themselves for whatever the market can bear.

So let me introduce you to a place called China. Wal-Mart—in its never-ending quest to promote its heartland, Arkansan family values—is a willing customer of the Chinese labor system, where people work 12- to 18-hour days, earn meager wages and have no days of rest—all for the honor of laboring inside factories full of chemical toxins and hazardous machines, leading to sickness and death at the highest rates in world history. Wal-Mart says its business with China is just a virtue of the free market.

Putting aside the morality of forcing people to work in slave-like conditions, the so-called free market does not exist in China when it comes to wages. China artificially suppresses wages by anywhere from 47 to 85 percent below what they should be,according to the AFL-CIO&apos;s complaint about China&apos;s labor policies filed with the United States Trade Representative last year. With Wal-Mart as its willing customer, an authoritarian regime ruthlessly warps the market for wages by enforcing a system that controls where people can work and imprisons and tortures people who attempt to organize real unions or strike. Maybe the rock-bottom labor costs are really behind Wal-Mart’s slogan &quot;always low prices,&quot; but the company is certainly not an example of how to win in a free market economy.

It’s easy to see why Wal-Mart and its conservative defenders discard ideology: money. By ignoring free market principles, the left-wing Harvard Business School estimates that Wal-Mart reduces its procurement costs by 10-20 percent, primarily by taking advantage of the artificially suppressed labor market in China. One can’t help note the delicious irony that Wal-Mart’s &quot;free market&quot; leadership is powered by an authoritarian regime that still refers to itself as communist.

Back at home, Wal-Mart’s free market mantra stops at the water’s edge of the public till. By one estimate, Wal-Mart has pulled in $1.5 billion dollars in taxpayer funded subsidies (see www.walmartwatch.com) . And that&apos;s at the low end, because subsidies are sometimes hard to track based on the lack of public reporting requirements. Wal-Mart is happy to cash in on government largess like property tax abatements, infrastructure support, free land and just straight-out cold cash—all of which are the antithesis of &quot;free market&quot; ideology.

Here’s a way to get rich, if you could collect the dough: How many of you wish you had a dollar every time you heard some conservative rant first about the evils of the federal government and, then, call for denuding the federal government and handing more control over decision making to local communities? We’d all be rich, no? Well, an odd thing has happened. Conservatives appear to be against local control.

Conservatives and their allies in the press have been bent out of shape over recent campaigns to keep Wal-Mart from opening stores. These campaigns were spearheaded by community groups nationwide from Los Angeles to Chicago to New York. Recently, The Economist , the international organ for the so-called &quot;free market,&quot; railed against the opposition to Wal-Mart’s entry into the New York City area. Writing in its April 2nd edition about local legislation aimed at requiring standards for workers’ pay and health care, the magazine opined that, &quot;Municipal socialism may seem an odd strategy for the world’s capital of capitalism to embrace.&quot;

Oh, I get it: Local control is only a lofty principle when the goal is to destroy the government’s ability to implement basic community values like fairness, equality and justice. But when people rise up to challenge the idea that a corporation shouldn’t do what it chooses with local community resources like workers, water, air and soil—oh my God, we’re teetering on the brink of rampant radicalism and a titanic battle between socialism and the free market.

Truth is, Wal-Mart could not survive in a real free market: It would, for example, have to pay Chinese workers more (which would ruin its low-wage business model) and spurn any offers of government subsidies. Indeed, it’s fitting that Wal-Mart, the business model fawned over by free-marketeers, exposes the so-called &quot;free market&quot; as a lie, no more than a crude—albeit effective—marketing phrase. By offering the seductive promise of prosperity through something &quot;free,&quot; we’re told we have to hand over control of our communities to some mystical &quot;market&quot; force. But that’s just an illusion conjured up to hide from us real-life actors who exploit the sweat of our brows, deplete our natural resources to make huge profits and take handouts funded by our hard-earned incomes.

Ironically, Wal-Mart’s behavior does have one redeeming factor. By puncturing the Wal-Mart-generated myths that it is good for America, by showing that its low-prices come with a heavy cost, and by revealing how the company is a leech on communities, we may begin to pull back the curtain hiding the true nature of the so-called &quot;free market.&quot;

No Child Left Behind law sets off revolt

Wednesday, April 20, 2005

By Kavan Peterson, Stateline.org Staff Writer

The first salvos of a long-threatened attack on President Bush&apos;s signature education law now have been launched in what amounts to a grassroots rebellion against the No Child Left Behind Act.

Simmering frustrations from state and local officials over the 2002 law&apos;s costs, testing requirements and penalties have erupted into open conflict with the Utah Legislature voting April 19 to challenge obedience to the federal law and the nation&apos;s largest teachers&apos; union filing suit against the act in federal court April 20. The state of Connecticut is preparing a separate lawsuit seeking full funding of NCLB&apos;s provisions.

Recent efforts by Bush education officials to head off a backlash failed to stop this week&apos;s challenges to the law, which Congress passed with bipartisan support to close education gaps between rich and poor, white and minority students. The backlash carries political weight particularly because it is being led by Republican-dominated states such as Utah, which gave Bush his largest margin of victory in November, and Texas, the president&apos;s home state.

The lawsuit filed by the National Education Association (NEA) and a handful of local school districts seeks for the first time to force the U.S. Department of Education to fully fund the law&apos;s mandates, which require states to test public school children in grades 3 through 8 annually. The groups also asked the court to prevent the federal government from denying federal education funds to states that refuse to spend their own money to comply with the law.


NEA President Reg Weaver, at a press conference in Washington D.C., announces a lawsuit challenging NCLB.

&quot;The law requires Washington to pay for it, and the fact is that Washington is not keeping that promise,&quot; said NEA President Reg Weaver at a press conference in Washington, D.C. &quot;As a result, our parents&apos; tax dollars are getting steered away from the classroom and going towards boosting the profits of testing companies, instead of going towards their children&apos;s education.&quot;

Connecticut officials are threatening to file a similar lawsuit. In Texas, the education commissioner unilaterally has decided to ignore NCLB rules on testing students with learning disabilities, placing the state in direct violation of the federal law.

The most significant rebuke yet came from Utah, where the GOP-dominated Legislature, after more than a year of debate, adopted legislation that calls for the state&apos;s own testing requirements to take precedence over federal testing mandates.

The Utah Legislature postponed adopting the bill earlier this year at the request of Republican Gov. John Huntsman Jr. to allow time to negotiate a deal with federal officials. No deal materialized, and the Legislature passed the bill despite a warning from U.S. Education Secretary Margaret Spellings that Utah may lose up to $76 million in federal education aid if it flouts the NCLB law. Huntsman has said he would sign the legislation.

Utah does not automatically face sanctions for passing the legislation, federal officials said. But the bill authorizes Utah schools to ignore NCLB provisions that conflict with state education policies or that cost state dollars, and doing so could cost the state federal education aid.

&quot;Pressure has been building at the state and local level for two to three years without any outlet,&quot; said Jack Jennings, executive director of the nonpartisan Center on Education Policy in Washington, which has done extensive studies on NCLB. &quot;National leaders in Congress and the White House have not wanted to consider any amendments to the law, so (local and state officials) are looking for ways to relieve the pressure in the courts or by openly defying the law.&quot;

This week&apos;s actions come on the heels of an announcement by Spellings that federal education officials intend to be more flexible in addressing states&apos; NCLB concerns. The announcement included specific changes to ease the rules on the numbers of learning-disabled students who must pass standardized reading and math tests.

Yet Spellings&apos; overtures failed to diffuse tensions with state and local officials who are expecting a sharp increase in the number of schools failing to meet NCLB standards, said Jennings. Requirements of the federal law, which expects all students, regardless of ethnicity, poverty or disability, to be proficient in reading and math by 2014, soon will become even tougher. States are required to raise the bar for passing NCLB assessment tests next year and to expand testing to all students in grades 3 to 8. If a single group of students doesn&apos;t hit the mark, a whole school fails to pass federal muster on public reports.

Put those requirements together and a lot more schools will be in trouble, Jennings said.

&quot;The two key problems are that school districts believe many aspects of the rules are too rigid and they don&apos;t have the resources or capacity to deal with all the schools that are going to be identified as needing assistance,&quot; Jennings said.

Connecticut and other states have attempted to put a price tag on complying with NCLB. Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said he plans to argue in court that NCLB testing requirements will cost state taxpayers an additional $8 million annually. Cost studies by Ohio and Texas estimated that the price to state taxpayers could run as high as $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, each year.

NEA, the teacher&apos;s union, contends that since the law&apos;s enactment in 2002, there has been a $27 billion shortfall in what Congress should have provided to meet the law&apos;s regulations. Included in the NEA&apos;s lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Michigan, are local school districts in Michigan, Texas and Vermont.

The suit argues that local schools have been forced to divert time and resources from other classes to meet the demands of NCLB testing requirements in reading and math.

&quot;The school district has to pay for this law, and it is taking away from my child&apos;s classroom subjects like music, art, foreign languages, social studies, and sports,&quot; said Jose Zuniga, a plaintiff in the case whose two children attend school in the Laredo, Texas, Independent School District. &quot;Those activities are being replaced with high-stakes, high-stress tests that don&apos;t help my child learn.&quot;

The groups contend that the federal government is violating provisions within the law that they say excuse states from paying for extra NCLB costs. A single paragraph - Section 9527A - in the 1,100-page law is at the center of the argument:

&quot;Nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize an officer or employee of the Federal Government to mandate, direct, or control a State, local education agency, or school&apos;s curriculum, program of instruction, or allocation of State or local resources, or mandate a State or any subdivision thereof to spend any funds or incur any costs not paid for under this Act.&quot;

&quot;Clearly this provision in NCLB holds the federal government accountable to provide enough funds to do the things required in the federal law,&quot; said David Schreve, a senior education lobbyist for the National Conference of State Legislatures, a bipartisan organization of state lawmakers.

Federal education officials counter that states have received more than enough funds, noting that Connecticut has received more than $750 million to implement NCLB. They point to two reports by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, that concluded NCLB is not an unfunded mandate.

&quot;The facts are what they are,&quot; said Education Department spokesperson Susan Aspey. Ultimately, closing the achievement gap in public education &quot;is a state and local responsibility, and it continues to be under No Child Left Behind,&quot; she said.

Governor Kinky?

April 23, 2005

Country singer and mystery writer Kinky Friedman says his Texas campaign is no joke.

By Scott Martelle, Times Staff Writer

Kinky FRIEDMAN, country singer turned mystery writer, is still jazzed. He&apos;s in a car hurtling from Houston to this small oil-and-tourism town on the Gulf of Mexico, and he&apos;s a talking jukebox. Put in a question and listen to him riff about himself and other musicians, about politics and politicians, about books and his beloved Texas. A fat — and illegal — Cuban stogie is wedged between his fingers, and you can just forget (he uses a slightly shorter word) the two small &quot;no smoking&quot; stickers pasted on the dashboard of the rental car.

It&apos;s an hour&apos;s drive to Friedman&apos;s noon gig, and Kinky, the self-proclaimed Jewish Cowboy of Texas, among other less savory descriptions, talks for all but maybe six minutes of it, the topics as varied as the coastal plain here is flat. But slouched in the passenger seat, Friedman keeps circling back to the same point: the more than 200 people who wedged themselves into Houston&apos;s Murder by the Book bookstore the night before to hear his half-hour spiel.

And to hear Friedman, an enigmatic blend of Johnny Cash and Mel Brooks, talk about why he&apos;s running for governor of Texas.

His campaign slogans sound like a Catskills comedy shtick. &quot;Kinky Friedman: Why the hell not?&quot; And: &quot;How hard can it be?&quot; Yet Friedman insists he&apos;s a serious candidate, more in the spirit of Jesse Ventura and Arnold Schwarzenegger than Pat Paulsen or Alice Cooper, the shock-rocker who once ran for Arizona governor as &quot;a troubled man for troubled times.&quot;

&quot;I&apos;m not running to make people think I&apos;m making fun of it, like Gary Coleman was&quot; in the California recall, Friedman says. &quot;I&apos;m running to win this thing. I&apos;m going to roll the dice, to bet on Texas. I&apos;ve traveled all across this state as a musician, as an author, and I know it better, I&apos;m more in touch with the people than any politician out there. That&apos;s the point.&quot;

But are the people in touch with Kinky, who published what he says is the last of his 17 mystery books, &quot;Ten Little New Yorkers,&quot; last month? Bruce Buchanan, a political analyst at the University of Texas at Austin, believes Friedman faces a tough road converting his celebrity status — which is not A-list to begin with — to political support.

&quot;He is not known in any widespread way; he&apos;s going to need media on steroids,&quot; Buchanan says. &quot;What really matters is can he get on the ballot, which requires signatures, and get media coverage, which is possible but not certain. If he can do either or both of those things, he can introduce some uncertainty&quot; into the race.

And there is some room to maneuver. Recent polls show incumbent Republican Gov. Rick Perry with approval ratings of around 50% — a vulnerable showing in political terms. Democrats rarely do well here in statewide races, but popular Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison has been sounding out a primary challenge, which could leave the two major candidates bloodied and susceptible to a newcomer&apos;s challenge.

Independents don&apos;t have much of a track record in Texas, but that doesn&apos;t mean there isn&apos;t room for one, Buchanan says.

&quot;There is a combination of apathy and mild distaste for politics that, even in this red state with instinctive conservative impulses, might respond to just a light tweaking,&quot; he says. &quot;The question is, can he provide that?&quot;

Friedman&apos;s instincts are less political than comical, and he follows his heart and funny bone like personal lodestars. &quot;I&apos;m a serious soul no one takes seriously,&quot; he says. He&apos;s done no polling and avoids policy analysis like he would an old girlfriend. He supports gay marriage because &quot;they have a right to be as miserable as the rest of us.&quot; At the Houston appearance, someone asked him about tax reform and Friedman answered: &quot;Read my lips: I don&apos;t know.&quot;

In a state with an assembly-line approach to executions, Friedman questions the death penalty — &quot;I&apos;m anti the wrong guy getting executed&quot; — but has no answers other than that he would appoint an oversight board to review cases. Texas schools are a shambles, which he thinks can be fixed by replacing political appointees overseeing the system with professional educators.

A few days earlier someone asked about the right-to-die debate that had been going on over Terri Schiavo in Florida. &quot;I&apos;m running for governor,&quot; Friedman blurted, &quot;not God.&quot;

When pressed for political solutions, Friedman falls back on a one-liner: &quot;I&apos;m a Jew. I&apos;ll hire good people.&quot;

So far, the lack of specifics hasn&apos;t hurt him in an election that is still nearly a year away.

&quot;We have some real serious issues here with school funding and healthcare, and he hasn&apos;t spoken to that yet, so it&apos;s a question,&quot; says Jeff Ryan, 59, an architect who showed up for the Houston appearance in a Friedman-for-governor T-shirt and cap. &quot;It will be fun to see him talk seriously about these issues.&quot;

What Friedman has going for him is name recognition, a fan base that is quickly turning into a volunteer base — some 10,000 had signed on by the end of the week — and plenty of celebrity connections to raise money. He&apos;s taken in more than $110,000 so far but is just beginning to get serious about fundraising. In the last gubernatorial race here, more than $100 million was spent — $70 million of it by the independently wealthy Democrat Tony Sanchez, who lost.

One early decision Freidman made was to run from the outside. He disdains both major parties as &quot;paper or plastic&quot; in a state in which more than 30% of voters identify themselves as independents. And to qualify for the November ballot as an independent, Friedman will have two months after the March party primaries to gather about 50,000 signatures of people who did not vote in either primary.

That means Friedman has to build a large and disciplined grass-roots system. To do that, he has tapped Ian Davis, a field organizer for Howard Dean&apos;s presidential campaign, who is trying to set up volunteer committees in each of the state&apos;s 254 counties. And Friedman has been courting notable political operative Bill Hillsman, an advisor to Ralph Nader in 2000 whose political acumen helped Minnesotans Paul Wellstone win a U.S. Senate seat and Ventura win a governorship.

Friedman, a nonpracticing Jew who lists Jesus Christ among his heroes, describes his campaign as spiritual and a natural attraction for unaligned and disenchanted voters. Texas has taken an image beating, he believes. The cowboy has become an international symbol of recklessness, not the stoic rider of the purple sage Friedman sees.

He wants to rally his fellow Texans to a new level of confidence in their state.

&quot;What I&apos;m trying to do is maybe use a little humor to knock down the windmill that is politics as usual, and to get all of us together and make that Lone Star shine again,&quot; Friedman told the Houston gathering to sustained applause. Later, Friedman acknowledged that his biggest challenge is to get people to take seriously the man who wrote such songs as &quot;They Ain&apos;t Makin&apos; Jews Like Jesus Anymore&quot; and his chauvinism-laced &quot;Get Your Biscuits in the Oven and Your Buns in the Bed.&quot;

Even he isn&apos;t sure how serious he was at first.

&quot;It&apos;s the Bee Gees kind of thing, you know, &apos;I Started a Joke,&apos; &quot; Friedman says, citing the 1969 pop song. &quot;Maybe it was that at one time, maybe not so much a joke but certainly an impossible dream…. But you know, I believe we can do this.&quot;

A Texas boyhood

Friedman was born in Chicago in 1944 while his father was serving as a World War II bomber navigator in Europe. After the war, the family moved to Houston, where Friedman started school, and then to Austin, where his father was a professor of educational psychology at the University of Texas.

Friedman&apos;s parents founded the Echo Hill boys&apos; and girls&apos; summer camp in 1953 on 400 acres of ranchland two hours northwest of San Antonio, and Friedman worked there as a counselor. The camp is still overseen by Friedman&apos;s brother, and Friedman, who never married, lives in an old lodge on the grounds as &quot;the oldest living Jew in Texas who doesn&apos;t own property.&quot;

While a liberal arts major at Texas, Friedman joined civil rights protests to desegregate Austin businesses. A former Peace Corps volunteer, he is a marquee figure for the Utopia Animal Rescue near the Echo Hill camp, which tries to find homes for abused animals. One of Friedman&apos;s few specific campaign pledges is to make cat declawing illegal in Texas.

Rabbi Jimmy Kessler, who has known Friedman since boyhood and worked with him at the camp, says the cynical songs and gruff persona mask a warm heart.

&quot;If he can work a cabin full of adolescent children, he can work with the Legislature,&quot; Kessler says as Friedman signs autographs for 200 fans at the Grand 1894 Opera House in Galveston, the last stop on his book tour. &quot;A sensitive person who cares deeply about people and animals wouldn&apos;t be a bad person for the governorship.&quot;

Besides, Friedman says, he needs the job. Once he announced he was running, Texas Monthly suspended his regular magazine column until the election — or the campaign — ended. Friedman had already ended his career as a mystery writer, killing himself off in &quot;Ten Little New Yorkers,&quot; the last of his books featuring a Texas country singer turned detective named Kinky Friedman, books better known for jokes than plots.

The new book, published last month, ends with the fictional Friedman and a suspected murderer falling off the Brooklyn Bridge, a scene reminiscent of Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty&apos;s fall from Reichenbach Falls in the Swiss Alps. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle eventually brought Holmes back from the dead, something Friedman says he wouldn&apos;t contemplate unless, he jokes, the literary world demands it.

Friedman&apos;s transformation from mystery writer to politician began with a cliffhanger. He was vacationing at a friend&apos;s Cabo San Lucas house in 1998 when a rogue wave swept him up and stranded him at the bottom of a cliff for more than 24 hours.

&quot;I was lost on this cliff, and nobody could find me,&quot; Friedman says. &quot;I had a bathing suit and a cigar, no matches. I was on this cliff with the lizards and the iguanas all night. I could see the village, but I thought I would have died if I tried to get there.&quot;

Friedman says he and his friends had talked about how easy it would be to disappear, so initially they &quot;thought it was a stunt.&quot; By the time Friedman decided the next day to chance crossing back along the bottom of the cliff, a full search was underway.

Stuck on the rocks, he decided &quot;that if I got out of this thing I&apos;d like to do something more…. I&apos;ve achieved a lot of my dreams, and I would like to see other people, especially younger Texans, get a chance to achieve some of theirs. That&apos;s basically the reason I&apos;m running. And besides, I need the closet space.&quot;

If there is a constant in Friedman&apos;s campaign, it&apos;s humor, often scatological and sophomoric. But Friedman sees that as a plus. &quot;I&apos;m trying to show that politics can be fun and funny and still be important.&quot;

But campaigns can also be won and lost on symbolism and public perceptions. The end of Friedman&apos;s campaign might be found in its beginning. He announced his candidacy in February in front of Texas&apos; most enduring landmark, the Alamo, carried live over Don Imus&apos; radio show and simulcast on MSNBC.

The Alamo, of course, was the ultimate last stand. Friedman, chewing on his cigar, mulls that for a moment, cautious optimism ceding ground to realism as he envisions the long climb ahead.

&quot;To go down in a great cause,&quot; he says, &quot;would not be bad.&quot;

Perkins (Tony Perkins president Family Research Council) accused opponents of Bush&apos;s judicial picks of anti-Christian bigotry

Tony Perkins, president of the conservative Christian think tank Family Research Council, baselessly accused Democratic senators of opposing President Bush&apos;s judicial nominees because of their deeply held Christian beliefs in opposition to abortion rights.

&quot;What is alarming about these 10 nominees that Mrs. Clinton and others say are bad or extreme is that they&apos;re people of deep religious conviction. And what this happens to be is a filibuster of people of faith,&quot; Perkins stated on his April 18 radio broadcast, referring to Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY) and other Senate Democrats who have filibustered a handful of Bush&apos;s judicial nominees. Retired judge Charles W. Pickering Sr., who President Bush recess-appointed to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals after Democrats filibustered his nomination, joined Perkins, claiming falsely that Senate Democrats filibustered his nomination solely because of Pickering&apos;s anti-abortion position:

PICKERING: The reason that I didn&apos;t get an up-and-down vote is because the groups that opposed me were concerned about the abortion issue. ... The issue that drove the engine of opposition was abortion.

PERKINS: It&apos;s almost as if there&apos;s a radical minority in the U.S. Senate that&apos;s saying this: &quot;You have to choose between your faith and public service.&quot;

PICKERING: Tony, that&apos;s exactly right. ... It was very evident with the Catholic nominees that anybody who had strong religious convictions on the issue of abortion, they [Democratic senators] were going to filibuster.

In fact, the Senate has confirmed 205 of Bush&apos;s judicial nominees -- most with substantial Democratic support -- and few, if any, of these confirmed judges have voiced support for abortion rights. Indeed, many are overtly anti-abortion (e.g., Michael W. McConnell, confirmed to the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, John G. Roberts, confirmed to the District of Columbia Circuit, and James Leon Holmes, confirmed to the Eastern District of Arkansas.) What distinguishes the nominees whom Democrats have filibustered is what Democrats say is their unwillingness or inability to put aside their ideological views and follow the law. In the case of the three nominees listed below, opponents have cited specific actions and statements related to abortion that run counter to precedent and statutory law:

Priscilla Owen

While serving on the Texas Supreme Court, Owen dissented strongly from the court&apos;s 2000 ruling on Jane Doe 1(II), 19 S.W.3d 346, which determined that &quot;Jane Doe&quot; had met the legal requirements for a judicial bypass under the state&apos;s parental notification law governing abortion for minors. Owen said the court had acted &quot;irresponsibly.&quot; Her dissent earned a harsh rebuke from fellow Republican justice Alberto Gonzales, who is now U.S. attorney general. Gonzales accused Owen essentially of rewriting the law by ignoring the language of the statute and legislative history, and wrote that adopting Owen&apos;s position on the case &quot;would be an unconscionable act of judicial activism.&quot; Bush nominated Owen to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in July 2002 and re-nominated her in February 2005.

Opponents of Owen&apos;s nomination have cited numerous other reasons for their opposition.

Janice Rogers Brown

Brown was the sole dissenter in the 1997 California Supreme Court case of Academy of American Pediatrics v. Lungren, in which the court ruled that a parental consent law restricting minors from receiving abortions explicitly violated the state constitution&apos;s right to privacy. In her dissent in the case, Brown claimed that the California constitution&apos;s explicit right of privacy was no broader than the right of privacy under the U.S. Constitution, despite clear state supreme court precedent to the contrary.

The State Bar of California staunchly opposed Brown&apos;s nomination to the California Supreme Court. The bar stated in 1996 that her &quot;judicial opinions were insensitive to established precedents and improperly reflected [her] philosophical and personal views.&quot; When Bush nominated Brown to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in July 2003, the Congressional Black Caucus stated: &quot;Justice Brown&apos;s record proves that she is unable or unwilling to divorce her personal views from her responsibility to fairly interpret the law or the Constitution.&quot; Progressive advocacy group People for the American Way (PFAW) outlined the numerous substantive reasons for Democratic opposition to Brown&apos;s nomination in a 2003 report.

William H. Pryor

Bush granted Pryor a recess appointment to the 11th Circuit over Senate Democrats&apos; objections last year. Democrats have cited a number of statements by Pryor, a former Alabama attorney general, as evidence that Pryor would be unwilling to uphold the constitutional right to an abortion. For example, he referred to the Supreme Court&apos;s ruling in Roe v. Wade as &quot;the day seven members of our highest court ripped the Constitution and ripped out the life of millions of unborn children.&quot; He has criticized the Supreme Court&apos;s ruling in Planned Parenthood v. Casey &quot;for preserv[ing] the worst abomination of constitutional law in our history: Roe v. Wade.&quot; In a response to a 2002 NARAL Pro Choice America survey of attorneys general, he reiterated, &quot;Abortion is murder, and Roe v. Wade is an abominable decision.&quot; At Pryor&apos;s June 2003 Judiciary Committee hearing, several senators, including Republican Sen. Arlen Specter, who is now chairman of the committee, expressed concern that Pryor would be unable to separate these strongly held views from what the law requires:

SPECTER: With that personal belief, Attorney General Pryor, what assurances can you give to the many who are raising the question as to whether, when you characterized it as an abomination and slaughter, that you can follow the decision of the United States Supreme Court, which you consider an abomination and having led to slaughter?

Apart from positions Pryor has taken on abortion issues, Democrats have cited numerous other substantive objections to Pryor&apos;s nomination.

Further, though Pickering claimed that Democrats blocked his nomination because of his views on abortion, Democrats actually cited the extraordinary lengths to which he went to force federal prosecutors to drop a charge against a convicted cross-burner in order to circumvent a mandatory five-year sentence. In 2002, a group of law professors wrote Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT), who was then chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to assert that Pickering&apos;s letter to the Justice Department in the cross-burning case represented a breach of judicial ethics. Democrats raised this issue repeatedly during his 2003 nomination hearing. Pickering announced his retirement in December 2004.

Apart from this case, Senate Democrats also cited other factors in their opposition to his nomination: Pickering&apos;s district court decisions were frequently reversed by the 5th Circuit for violating &quot;well-settled principles of law&quot;; his stated predisposition against claims of employment discrimination; and a false statement he made to the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding his contact with the segregationist Mississippi Sovereignty Commission.

TRAVELOBBYING

 http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB111351750759807490,00.html 

&quot;A fast-growing trend in the business of influencing government is corporate-funded trips,&quot; reports the Wall Street Journal. &quot;Because the trips are paid for by corporations and trade associations - and not the hired guns who lobby for them - such trips are permitted under House and Senate rules,&quot; unless the sponsors are registered lobbyists or foreign agents. The number of junkets increased from 1,400 in 2000 to 1,900 in 2004; their cost increased 50% over the same period, to $3 million in 2004. Already this year, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce &quot;has flown more than a dozen House and Senate aides to the Dominican Republic to learn about trade.&quot; The American Association of Airport Executives, Consumer Electronics Association, National Association of Broadcasters, and Advanced Medical Technology Association have also funded trips, as have groups within the finance, telecommunications, agriculture, and energy industries, with &quot;members of both parties ... taking advantage.&quot;

&quot;WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE IS TRUE EVEN THOUGH YOU CANNOT PROVE IT?&quot; - STEPHEN KOSSLYN

Great minds can sometimes guess the truth before they have either the evidence or arguments for it (Diderot called it having the &quot;esprit de divination&quot;). What do you believe is true even though you cannot prove it

 http://www.edge.org/q2005/q05_print.html 

 STEPHEN KOSSLYN 
Psychologist, Harvard University; Author, Wet Mind

Mental processes: An out-of-body existence?

These days, it seems obvious that the mind arises from the b rain (not the heart, liver, or some other organ). In fact, I personally have gone so far as to claim that &quot;the mind is what the brain does.&quot; But this notion does not preclude an unconventional idea: Your mind may arise not simply from your own brain, but in part from the brains of other people.

Let me explain. This idea rests on three key observations.

The first is that our brains are limited, and so we use crutches to supplement and extend our abilities. For example, try to multiply 756 by 312 in your head. Difficult, right? You would be happier with a pencil and piece of paper—or, better yet, an electronic calculator. These devices serve as prosthetic systems, making up for cognitive deficiencies (just as a wooden leg would make up for a physical deficiency).

The second observation is that the major prosthetic system we use is other people. We set up what I call &quot;Social Prosthetic Systems&quot; (SPSs), in which we rely on others to extend our reasoning abilities and to help us regulate and constructively employ our emotions. A good marriage may arise in part because two people can serve as effective SPSs for each other.

The third observation is that a key element of serving as a SPS is learning how best to help someone. Others who function as your SPSs adapt to your particular needs, desires and predilections. And the act of learning changes the brain. By becoming your SPS, a person literally lends you part of his or her brain!

In short, parts of other people&apos;s brains come to serve as extensions of your own brain. And if the mind is &quot;what the brain does,&quot; then your mind in fact arises from the activity of not only your own brain, but those of your SPSs.

There are many implications of these ideas, ranging from reasons why we behave in certain ways toward others to foundations of ethics and even to religion. In fact, one could even argue that when your body dies, part of your mind may survive. But before getting into such dark and dusty corners, it would be nice to have firm footing—to collect evidence that these speculations are in fact worth taking seriously.

More politicians write blogs to bypass mainstream media

Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown is one of the latest to stay in touch with constituents by airing his unedited views online.

By Mark Sappenfield | Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor

OAKLAND, CALIF. – But for the name at the top of the page, the Web log would seem unspectacular - the work of some disaffected technophile tilting against the establishment:
&quot;Bloggers are a force,&quot; quips the blog in an eclectic column that ricochets from San Francisco journalism to German philosophy. &quot;The established order of politics (EOP) and the MSM [mainstream media] face a big challenge from this fearless army.&quot;

This, however, is not the rallying call of some anonymous agitator. This is one of the first blog entries by Jerry Brown, mayor of Oakland. For a politician who has always teetered on the edge of the counterculture - known as Mayor Moonbeam - the leap from establishment figure to cultural insurgent is perhaps not a difficult one. But more politicians are following in his footsteps, looking to the Web as a way to bypass the media and get out their own message - unvarnished and unedited.

&quot;I&apos;m not surprised that [blogs] are being adopted by people inside the establishment - they&apos;re perceived as very real, very intimate,&quot; says Amanda Lenhart of the Pew Internet and American Life Project in Washington. &quot;It&apos;s a way of having constituents feel very in touch.&quot;

Recently, Web logs - or &quot;blogs&quot; - have been most notable for their evolving role in &quot;gotcha&quot; journalism. Though most of the estimated 8 million blogs on the Internet are little more than online diaries, a small percentage have a more serious aim, acting as media watchdogs, insider newsletters, or political gadflys. Blogs exposed poor reporting by CBS anchorman Dan Rather, hastening his departure, and they successfully pressured the top news executive at CNN to resign.

Yet politicians are beginning to see blogs are more than forums for snoops. To some, they are the ultimate cyberspace soapbox. United States Rep. Ray Cox of Minnesota was the first major politician to start a blog, according to the Pew Project, and the prime minister of Japan has one. &quot;It enriches the conversation and provides a forum for an exchange of ideas that - for a public official - is very useful,&quot; says Oakland&apos;s Mayor Brown.

His blogs can range from the practical to the existential - touching on a local curfew for probationers or the imprisonment of a blogger in Iran, where he muses: &quot;Schopenhauer said that extracting truth from oneself required putting one&apos;s mind on a rack and subjecting it to relentless interrogation - so prone are we to delusion and denial.&quot;

To be sure, his blogs fuel full-blooded discussions. On one, a respondent writes: &quot;Why are you wasting time with a blog when you have a city falling apart around you? I sold my house in Oakland last year to escape your horrid administration and every day I wake up happy, knowing that I&apos;m no longer paying property tax in Oakland.&quot;

Another counters: &quot;Wow, I thought you were a nut and off the map. After reading [your] comments, I think I will ... reevaluate.&quot;

In many ways, the blog provides politicians an opportunity to recast themselves away from the mainstream media. Across the bay in San Francisco, Supervisor Chris Daly has begun a blog to counter what he feels is biased reporting in the local paper.

&quot;I&apos;ve not done well in the newspaper coverage,&quot; says Mr. Daly. &quot;The Internet is a way to get my message out to people who are wired.&quot;

Entire communities have turned to the Web in hopes of providing information ignored by mainstream media that are gradually consolidating into fewer voices. Situated between Los Angeles and Anaheim - and largely overlooked by both - Bellflower, Calif., now sends out e-bulletins to residents - announcing Easter egg hunts and chili cook-offs once reported in newspapers.

&quot;Generally it was just the shootings and robberies that made the news,&quot; says Jeff Hobbs, a city spokesman.

For now, the number of e-subscribers is small, but it is the beginning of what could be a bigger role for the Internet in politics. Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean unveiled the power of the Internet by tapping the Web for fundraising. Now, politicians like Brown are beginning to explore where politics goes from there.

&quot;Blogs are where online fundraising was before Howard Dean,&quot; says Michael Cornfield, a political scientist at George Washington University. &quot;Radio was around for a while before [President Franklin Roosevelt&apos;s] first fireside chat.... For the Internet, nobody&apos;s had that breakthrough moment yet.&quot;

Food Pyramid To Be Replaced By Food Pentagon

April 19, 2005

Rumsfeld Eager To Take On New Job

The U.S. government today announced that the once vaunted food pyramid -- used as a model for American nutrition since 1992 -- will immediately be replaced by the food Pentagon. Donald Rumsfeld will be chief.

&quot;I am looking forward to supervising the daily caloric intake of every American,&quot; said Secretary Rumsfeld, who will add the new job to his portfolio. &quot;It&apos;s very simple,&quot; he said. &quot;You eat what we tell you to.&quot;

Ewing Fitzsimmon, Undersecretary for Policy on Ruffage and Fiber, explained that today&apos;s America needed a more aggressive, more &quot;go-to attitude&quot; toward nutrition.

Part of the problem with the food pyramid, explained Fitzsimmon, was that while it was relatively easy to understand, most Americans simply did not follow it. The new program will instead involve extremely complicated guidelines that will be phased in gradually until they become mandatory in June of 2006.

&quot;When people don&apos;t eat right, we get a flabby populace,&quot; said Rumsfeld, &quot;and a flabby populace means that America sags in all the wrong places. We want to present our best face to the world.&quot;

&quot;Nobody eats anything but beans until 1300 hours,&quot; he continued. &quot;We need to reduce America&apos;s dependence on oil.&quot;

New Poll: Americans Warming to Theocracy

Two ever-so-slightly irreverent stories

The media strikes the Catholic news while the public-interest iron is still hot, delivering these two cute, and ever-so-slightly irreverent stories to transition us from JP II praise songs to Hitler&apos;s Youth exposés: First, the Catholic priest-shortage has led to the realization of a Jay Leno joke, with the news that the work of running parishes and saying Mass will likely be outsourced to Indian priests in what&apos;s becoming a familiar historical reversal of the missionary spread of the gospel.

Second, the Virgin Mary&apos;s been spotted again, this time in a yellow and white &quot;salt stain&quot; on the side of a train underpass wall in Chicago. While the report doesn&apos;t go so far as to make the obvious &quot;Piss Christ&quot; reference, or raise much of an eyebrow at the types of &quot;salt run-off&quot; that tend to stain subway station walls, it&apos;s probably safe to say this isn&apos;t a story that would have run last week, and may signal the nearing end of the accolade-phase of this news cycle.

Religious Leaders Urge Frist to Pull Out of Telecast / Three more judicial filibuster falsehoods, courtesy of James Dobson

 Religious Leaders Urge Frist to Pull Out of Telecast 

A coalition of senior religious leaders today called on Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., to either withdraw from an April 24 telecast organized by a socially conservative group or explicitly repudiate its message.

Frist is scheduled to appear in a telecast organized by the Family Research Council that will portray Democratic filibusters of judicial nominees as &quot;a filibuster against people of faith.&quot;

&quot;To use the power of an elected political leader to polarize people of faith is unjust,&quot; said Bishop Mark Hansen, the presiding bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, said in a teleconference today. Hansen added that &quot;our faith should not be judged by political leaders. That belongs to the righteousness of God. For political leaders to do such is self-righteous.&quot;

Social conservatives are pressing Frist, a potential 2008 presidential candidate, to execute a parliamentary move, dubbed the &quot;nuclear option,&quot; to end minority filibusters of judicial nominees.

From: CQ Today Midday Update

 Three more judicial filibuster falsehoods, courtesy of James Dobson 

Focus on the Family founder and chairman James C. Dobson made a series of false and misleading claims about the Senate&apos;s use of the filibuster to block judicial nominees. On the April 21 edition of Fox News&apos; Hannity&amp;Colmes, Dobson asserted: 1) that former Clinton nominee Richard A. Paez &quot;was not an appeals court judge&quot; and would not &quot;have had a majority if given a simple up-or-down vote&quot;; 2) that former President Bill Clinton &quot;got 100 percent&quot; of his appellate court nominees who reached the floor approved; and 3) that the &quot;ABA [American Bar Association] had given its highest stamp of approval&quot; to the 10 Bush nominees filibustered by Senate Democrats.

First, Clinton did indeed nominate Paez for an appellate court seat; he was finally confirmed in March 2000 after four years of delay by the Republican-controlled Senate. Second, Republican senators blocked 16 of Clinton&apos;s appellate court nominees in his second term alone. Finally, only three of the 10 Bush nominees that Democrats have filibustered have received the ABA&apos;s highest rating.

Responding to co-host Alan Colmes&apos;s suggestion that Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) is being &quot;disingenuous&quot; by &quot;acting as if the filibuster&apos;s a terrible thing&quot; after Frist himself had voted to filibuster Paez&apos;s nomination, Dobson replied: &quot;That was not an appeals court judge. And it was not a situation where the judge would have had a majority if given a simple up-or-down vote.&quot; But Paez was an appeals court nominee, and he was ultimately approved in an up-or-down vote. The Los Angeles Times reported on November 13, 2003: &quot;As recently as March 2000, several Republicans voted to filibuster two Californians whom President Clinton had named to the 9th Circuit appellate court: Richard A. Paez and Marsha L. Berzon. ... Ultimately, the Republican stalling tactics failed, and both jurists now sit on the appellate court.&quot;

Dobson then purported to &quot;quote the statistics&quot; to Colmes on the ratio of appellate nominees approved during the Clinton and Bush administrations: &quot;President Bush has only gotten 67 percent of his appeals court nominees through when they got to the floor of the Senate. Bill Clinton got 100 percent.&quot; But Dobson&apos;s statistic is highly misleading; in fact, the Republican-led Senate kept 16 of Clinton&apos;s second-term appellate court nominees &quot;off the floor,&quot; in most cases denying them even committee hearings.

Finally, in response to Colmes, who said of Democratic filibusters that &quot;we&apos;re talking about 10 [nominees] out of 205 who have been confirmed,&quot; Dobson countered that those 10 nominees had received the ABA&apos;s &quot;highest stamp of approval.&quot; But of the 10 Bush nominees filibustered by Senate Democrats, only three -- Miguel Estrada, David McKeague, and Priscilla Owen -- have received a unanimous &quot;Well Qualified&quot; rating from the ABA (ratings for all nominees are listed during the 108th Congress and the 109th Congress), and McKeague initially received a split rating of &quot;Well Qualified&quot; and &quot;Qualified&quot; during the 108th Congress before receiving an unanimous &quot;Well Qualified&quot; rating during the 109th Congress. Of the remaining seven filibustered nominees, four received a split rating of &quot;Well Qualified&quot; and &quot;Qualified,&quot; and three received a split rating of &quot;Qualified&quot; and &quot;Not Qualified.&quot;

Agents quiet as Denver 3 make noise

Article Published: Friday, April 22, 2005

By Jim Spencer
Denver Post Columnist

Attorneys for three people banned from President Bush&apos;s Social Security information meeting in Denver last month say the Secret Service has reopened its investigation of the case.

Secret Service agent Mark Hughes called David Miller, an attorney for Alex Young, Leslie Weise and Karen Bauer, said Dan Recht, Miller&apos;s co-counsel.

Hughes told Miller that agents have been sent from Washington to Denver to investigate &quot;whether a crime was committed&quot; at the Social Security meeting, Recht said Thursday.

The call came after Miller filed a freedom of information request. The FOI filing asked for an earlier Secret Service report containing the name of the person who removed Young, Weise and Bauer from the public event. The earlier report said the only reason Young, Weise and Bauer were forced to leave was because they arrived in a car with a bumper sticker that said &quot;No More Blood for Oil.&quot;

&quot;We got a call from the Secret Service wanting to interview our clients,&quot; Recht said. &quot;They said they had people out here interviewing people who were at the (Social Security) event.&quot;

Secret Service spokesman Jonathan Cherry refused to say if investigators are in Denver.

A spokesman for U.S. Rep. Bob Beauprez, whose office gave Young, Weise and Bauer tickets to the presidential visit, said the Secret Service had not contacted the congressman&apos;s staff.

Beauprez press secretary Jordan Stoick refused to supply the name of anyone from the White House who coordinated Bush&apos;s appearance in Colorado.

The White House has refused to name its Denver advance team.

Recht said Miller&apos;s discussion with Hughes indicated that the Secret Service will try to talk again to the man who Young, Weise and Bauer claim impersonated a Secret Service agent. That person forced them to leave the March 21 Social Security meeting before the president arrived.

The earlier Secret Service investigation determined that the person who did this was a staffer with the &quot;host committee.&quot; Local Republicans say the White House ran the event.

Removal of the so-called Denver Three has become a month-long political embarrassment for the Bush administration. The White House refuses to say who booted Young, Weise and Bauer. The Secret Service insists it wasn&apos;t an agent but refuses to reveal the name of the Republican staff member who reportedly admitted to removing the trio.

U.S. Rep. Mark Udall and Sen. Ken Salazar, both Democrats from Colorado, have called for an investigation into whether the Republican staffer broke the law by impersonating an agent.

Udall called a reopened investigation &quot;good news.&quot;

&quot;I feel like the Secret Service has been caught in the middle because of the bad behavior of a political staff member,&quot; Udall said Thursday.

He cited cases of Bush opponents kept from taxpayer-financed Social Security information meetings in North Dakota and Arizona as representing a &quot;larger pattern.&quot; That pattern, said Udall, suggests that what happened in Denver &quot;was not just a rogue staffer.&quot;

The Secret Service, Udall continued, needs to quickly identify the person who removed Young, Weise and Bauer to clear its name and get back to its work protecting the president.

But Recht says the new investigation allows the Secret Service not to tell his clients who their malefactor was or who trained him.

&quot;They&apos;re saying that at this point they can&apos;t release the name because it&apos;s an ongoing investigation,&quot; said Recht, who is still deciding whether his clients will speak to investigators. &quot;If the Secret Service opened another investigation to deny our Freedom of Information Act request, that just adds to the stonewalling.&quot;

It also keeps the White House fielding near-daily inquiries about dirty tricks that unfairly - and possibly illegally - destroy political dissent.

That helps no one&apos;s reputation.

Especially the president&apos;s.

&quot;The use of TV consumer experts is the latest way marketers have tried to disguise their promotions as real news,&quot; similar to magazine &quot;&apos;advertorials&apos; designed to look like editorial features&quot; and video news releases aired as TV reports. The stable of paid &quot;experts&quot; includes &quot;Today&quot; show tech-product reviewer Corey Greenberg, &quot;trend and fashion expert&quot; Katlean de Monchy, Popular Photography&amp;Imaging magazine editor John Owens, and Child magazine tech editor James Oppenheim. The Wall Street Journal reports that all four &quot;experts&quot; have neglected to disclose to viewers that they received payments to promote products being discussed.

But that presentation is misleading if the experts have been paid to mention products.&quot;

Great minds can sometimes guess the truth before they have either the evidence or arguments for it (Diderot called it having the &quot;esprit de divination&quot;). What do you believe is true even though you cannot prove it

 http://www.edge.org/q2005/q05_print.html 

 PHILIP W. ANDERSON 
Physicist and Nobel laureate, Princeton University

Is string theory a futile exercise as physics, as I believe it to be? It is an interesting mathematical specialty and has produced and will produce mathematics useful in other contexts, but it seems no more vital as mathematics than other areas of very abstract or specialized math, and doesn&apos;t on that basis justify the incredible amount of effort expended on it.

My belief is based on the fact that string theory is the first science in hundreds of years to be pursued in pre-Baconian fashion, without any adequate experimental guidance. It proposes that Nature is the way we would like it to be rather than the way we see it to be; and it is improbable that Nature thinks the same way we do.

The sad thing is that, as several young would-be theorists have explained to me, it is so highly developed that it is a full-time job just to keep up with it. That means that other avenues are not being explored by the bright, imaginative young people, and that alternative career paths are blocked.

E-mail is the new database

By Joia Shillingford
BBC News business reporter

Gmail is available by invitation only as it is still being developed
&quot;If a friend is excited about a concert and that gives me an idea for a birthday gift, I will store the info on e-mail,&quot; says Georges Harik, the man in charge of search-engine Google&apos;s Gmail service. Stuart Anderson, Microsoft&apos;s Hotmail business manager in the UK, keeps online shopping receipts in his mailbox in case he has to query anything later.

&quot;People are keeping a lot more information in their e-mail accounts for retrieval at a later date,&quot; says Yahoo!

Web-based e-mail services like Hotmail, Yahoo!, Gmail and AOL Mail on the Web are becoming databases by default as a growing number of people use them, to store data and photos so they can retrieve them from anywhere.

Growing trend

Filing could become a thing of the past for e-mail users

The trend has become more pronounced as the services have dramatically increased their storage capacity in response to upstart Gmail offering a free service with more than 2,000 megabytes (Mb) of storage.

&quot;E-mail is a way of interacting not just with others, but also with yourself, &quot; says Mr Harik, who is director of Googlettes (new Google services). &quot;You want to remember something, so you send it to your mailbox.&quot;

For all but the very organised, old e-mails will contain phone numbers that haven&apos;t been entered into a diary, names and addresses of contacts, meeting or customer information, useful statistics or competitor information and photos of products and people.

The market for web-based e-mail services is still growing. &quot;In the US, it grew 3% between April and November 2004,&quot; said Andreas Gutjahr, marketing manager, UK&amp;Germany, for Neilsen//NetRatings, a Nasdaq-listed internet research company.

He says the number of minutes users spend connected is also rising.

Money maker

But even where there is a small subscription fee, e-mail does not make much money in itself. The prize is in the number of users - and therefore advertisers - the providers can lure, not just to their online mailboxes but also to portals like MSN and search engines like Google and Yahoo!.

Gmail &quot;will be very profitable for us,&quot; says Mr Harik.

But if web e-mail is being used for more than just sending and receiving messages, how will this affect the market shares of the different providers?

One possibility is that Hotmail&apos;s market dominance could be affected by rival services better equipped to search through thousands of e-mails.

Rival offerings

Yahoo&apos;s search engine expertise benefits Yahoo! Mail users

Both Yahoo! and Google have had internet search engines as part of their core business from the start. So they are well placed to offer efficient e-mail searching.

Gmail was designed with the idea of searching for unstructured, unfiled information in mind. Mr Harik says: &quot;We&apos;ve taken away about 70%-80% of the reason to file things.&quot;

However, he believes: &quot;It might still be worth filing e-mails related to a specific project, where comprehensiveness (finding every single message on a topic) was important.&quot;

&quot;We have a labelling system that enables you to label messages in more than one way. Also our conversation feature enables you to see all the messages in an e-mail conversation.&quot;

Global Audience in Nov&apos; 04
MSN Hotmail 61.25m
Yahoo! Mail 55.50m
AOL E-mail 34.64m
Neilsen / / NetRatings
(User figures cover US, Brazil, Australia, Hong Kong, UK, France, Germany, Sweden, Italy, Spain and Switzerland)

Google will also search users&apos; e-mails for keywords so that it can place adverts in mailboxes relevant to users&apos; interests. On the one hand, this may make adverts more useful. On the other - though users&apos; identities won&apos;t be revealed to advertisers - it does raise privacy concerns.

Gmail is currently available by invitation only as it is still under development. But it recently increased the number of new users that existing customers can invite - from 10 to 50 - suggesting it is pushing Gmail out to more people.

Yahoo! Mail says it has developed its e-mail searching too. &quot;This can be done through the new prominent &apos;Search Mail&apos; and &apos;Search the Web&apos; buttons within the e-mail box,&quot; said a spokeswoman. &quot;Enhanced searching tools have become increasingly important as storage limits have increased.&quot;

Limited options

By contrast, the search facilities on Hotmail are quite limited only allowing searches in the To, From and Subject fields of an e-mail and not in the text of a message.

Moreover, since Hotmail increased the amount of free storage it offers, the search facility sometimes won&apos;t work at all for users with a lot of e-mails.

For now, Microsoft - which has a separate search engine it upgraded this month - is focusing on integrating Hotmail with other Microsoft applications like instant messaging and blogging. It is not planning to upgrade its Hotmail search facilities, according to Mr Anderson.

Challenge looms

Web mail storage
Hotmail: 250Mb
Gmail: 1,000Mb
Yahoo! Mail: 250 Mb
AOL Mail on the Web: 100Mb
Hotmail Plus: 2000Mb(£14.99)
Yahoo! Premium: 2000Mb( £11.99)

Competition may be taking its toll on Hotmail. &quot;If we look at Europe, they [Hotmail] actually went down from a monthly audience of 25 million users in April 2004 to 22 million in November,&quot; said Neilsen/NetRatings.

During the same period &quot;Yahoo! increased by 2% from 9.6 million users a month to nearly 9.8 million,&quot; he added.

The number of minutes spent accessing Hotmail in Europe also fell - from 47 minutes a month in April to 38 minutes last November.

Meanwhile usage of Yahoo! Mail increased by just over 12 minutes a month to 52 mins.

Hotmail has added new features like instant messaging

But Mr Anderson says Hotmail is not planning to give up its dominant share of the web e-mail market any time soon. It has recently been encouraging users to sign up for more than one mailbox and has introduced a series of Hotmail.co.uk mailboxes so people who missed out on getting the user name they wanted have another chance.

&quot;We&apos;ve put a huge effort into upgrading our 187m users,&quot; says Mr Anderson. &quot;If we find people are using Hotmail as a dumping ground [for information] and not being remotely organised, we will develop the product.

&quot;We are determined to stay ahead.&quot;

Borowitz Report - papal audience shocker

POPE REQUESTS AUDIENCE WITH BONO
Calls Building Relationship With U2 Frontman &apos;Job One&apos;

In his first official act since being named leader of the Roman Catholic Church, Pope Benedict XVI said that he had requested an audience with Bono, the leader of the platinum-selling rock band U2.

Speaking from a balcony at the Vatican to a crowd of 500,000, the newly elected pontiff said that building a relationship with Bono would be &quot;Job One&quot; of his tenure as pope.

The Church&apos;s ties with Bono dominated the top-secret discussions leading to the election of the new pope, several cardinals speaking on condition of unanimity have confirmed.

Bono&apos;s close working relationship with Pope John Paul II has long been considered one of the Church&apos;s greatest assets, prompting concern that the new pope might have a tough act to follow in securing the crucial support of the U2 leader.

&quot;As a German, Pope Benedict XVI has always had closer ties to German bands like The Scorpions,&quot; one cardinal said. &quot;He&apos;s been known to whistle &apos;Rock You Like a Hurricane&apos; while strolling about the Vatican.&quot;

Performing at the Pepsi Center in Denver last night, Bono interrupted U2&apos;s hit song &quot;Vertigo&quot; to give what was described as a &quot;brief but heartfelt shout-out&quot; to Pope Benedict XVI.

According to one unnamed cardinal, Bono&apos;s shout-out drew sighs of relief in Vatican circles: &quot;Next to the white smoke, that shout-out from Bono was the sign we&apos;ve all been waiting for.&quot;

Elsewhere, Michael Jackson told reporters today that he thinks his trial is &quot;going well,&quot; a sign that his lawyers may be trying to build a case for insanity.

CORRECTION: In yesterday&apos;s story, we reported that President Bush declared the war on obesity over after making a landing in a Navy helicopter on the roof of a McDonald&apos;s in Columbus, Ohio. As many readers pointed out, the name of the current White House spokesman is Scott McClellan, not Ari Fleischer, as we reported elsewhere in the article. Other than that, the Borowitz Report stands by its story.

7 days left: hit the streets in your town for fair judges


This weekend right-wing groups will hold a huge rally for more extreme judges, along with millions in TV ads and organizing. We&apos;re countering them around the country Sat.&amp;Sun. by passing out flyers asking neighbors to call their senators. We need your help: find one person to join you this weekend, or decide to go on your own, and sign up now:

click here

 http://www.moveonpac.org/event/events/create.html?action_id=3&amp;id;=5408-5514896-hofKbXGYkC7quhGE65DhSQ&amp;t;=45 

The Good NewsRepublican Senate leader Rick Santorum (PA) admitted yesterday that Republicans&apos; private polling on the judicial fight shows the public moving our way.

Dear MoveOn member,

This weekend, Republican Senate leader Bill Frist will speak at a far-right rally where speakers will portray &quot;Democrats as &apos;against people of faith&apos; for blocking President Bush&apos;s [judicial] nominees.&quot;1 And hundreds of right-wing groups are pushing their members to be even more involved. The conservative group Progress for America announced today they&apos;re raising $5 million to run pro-&quot;nuclear option&quot; ads. We&apos;ve got to match them.

We&apos;ve only got 7 days left before a likely vote and this weekend will make a critical difference. The Republicans are quietly organizing their base, but they hope to push this issue through without the rest of the public noticing, so one of our best strategies is raising the profile of this issue. This weekend we&apos;ll do that by handing out flyers with senators&apos; phone numbers, along with window signs, in neighborhoods across the country.

Often MoveOn actions take place behind the keyboard, and in-person actions take time. But even a single hour this weekend, from thousands of you, can make a huge difference, and we wouldn&apos;t be asking you to do this if it weren&apos;t a crucial strategy to win.

If you can find one friend or family member today to come with you this weekend in your town to pass out flyers and signs, or are willing to go out on your own, you&apos;re good to go: we&apos;ll provide all the training and materials you need. Start by clicking here:

 http://www.moveonpac.org/event/events/create.html?action_id=3&amp;id;=5408-5514896-hofKbXGYkC7quhGE65DhSQ&amp;t;=2 

If you don&apos;t have a partner to join you and would prefer not to go by yourself, you can join another MoveOn member planning to go out nearby. Click here:

 http://www.moveonpac.org/event/judgesoutreach/?id=5408-5514896-hofKbXGYkC7quhGE65DhSQ&amp;t;=3 

These events are a great opportunity to meet other MoveOn members in your area—the last time we did something similar, Sharon in Virginia Beach, VA, told us the best part was, &quot;Meeting the team members. It was great to be among like-minded people, which is rare where I live.&quot; And you may find progressive neighbors you didn&apos;t know you had—Bill in South Easton, MA, said, &quot;When I was done talking to people and reflected on a new, &apos;open&apos; feeling I had.... hard to describe. For the first time I had a sense of what an actual &quot;people&apos;s movement&quot; here in America might be like.&quot;

Some of you may be nervous about knocking on neighbors&apos; doors. That&apos;s completely normal even for people with lots of experience. Even if you&apos;re terribly nervous, here are two options that ANYONE can do and still make a difference:

* You can just drop a call-in flyer on each doorstep, without talking to people at all.
* You can talk to each person in a very neutral, non-confrontational way. You&apos;d say, &quot;I live here in the neighborhood and we&apos;re going around asking people if they think there should be more or less conservative judges. What do you think?&quot; If they say &quot;more conservative,&quot; just say thanks and leave, and if they say &quot;less conservative&quot; give them a call-in flyer and a window sign. Volunteers really liked this technique in the Leave No Voter Behind campaign last fall.

Here&apos;s what one MoveOn member said about her recent experience going door to door on this issue:

&quot;I was nervous, as usual, before knocking on the first door. My neighbor was very welcoming, though, and had yet to hear about the nuclear option. She took the flyer, promised to call and promised to get her husband to call when he got home. The next door I knocked had similar results. At each door I was less nervous...and at each door I was more aware of how few people know about the [judicial] threat.&quot;—Mary, Pittsburgh, PA
But above all else, the most important thing is that we all do something this weekend—it&apos;s too important to sit on the sidelines. Sign up now:

 http://www.moveonpac.org/event/events/create.html?action_id=3&amp;id;=5408-5514896-hofKbXGYkC7quhGE65DhSQ&amp;t;=4 

We need your help no matter where you live. There are several states with moderate Republican senators who might vote against the nuclear option: Senators Snowe (ME), McCain (AZ), and Chafee (RI) are likely to vote with us but need support, and Senators Specter (PA), Collins (ME), Smith (OR), Warner (VA), Sununu (NH), Hagel (NE) are possible votes on our side but need persuasion. But all senators need to hear from us: firm Republican opponents need to know the public is watching them, and reliable Democratic supporters need to know that if they stand up and fight, including resisting if the nuclear option passes, we&apos;ve got their backs.

If you&apos;re on the fence about taking action, remember that there are probably five other people in your community sitting there reading this email at this very moment who are also on the fence. If you go ahead and register a time, other people will join you—we just need you to take the lead. You can sign up to go out this weekend by clicking here:

 http://www.moveonpac.org/event/events/create.html?action_id=3&amp;id;=5408-5514896-hofKbXGYkC7quhGE65DhSQ&amp;t;=5 

This is about making a stand: radical Republican leaders in Congress have tried one crazy thing after another, from grandstanding on the Schiavo case, to changing the ethics rules to protect Tom DeLay, to now forcing through judges who are biased towards corporations and extreme policies. And it&apos;s time for us to stand up and say, &quot;We&apos;re not going to take it anymore.&quot;

Thank you. Sincerely,

–Adam, Noah, Matt, Jennifer and the MoveOn PAC Team

Filibustering people of faith?

by Jim Wallis

During the 2004 election campaign, Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson virtually said Christians could only vote for George W. Bush. Many of you, along with other Christians and people of faith, responded with letters to the editor, newspaper ads, and even bumper stickers reminding America that &quot;God is not a Republican...or a Democrat.&quot; Then the Republican National Committee circulated lists of &quot;duties&quot; to local churches, which included turning over their congregational membership lists. The RNC also sent postcards to voters in some states with images of a Bible being banned and a man putting a wedding ring on another man - warning that this was what &quot;liberal&quot; politicians planned to do.

Now the Religious Right is saying that supporting the president&apos;s judicial nominations is a test of orthodoxy. This is a dramatic new and serious breach in the relationship between faith and politics.

James Dobson of Focus on the Family, Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council, Prison Fellowship&apos;s Chuck Colson, and Southern Baptist leader Albert Mohler are hosting &quot;Justice Sunday,&quot; a telecast this weekend from a mega-church in Louisville, Kentucky. Their message is that those who don&apos;t support President Bush&apos;s judicial nominees are hostile to &quot;people of faith.&quot;

Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist plans to join them by video to get political support for his effort to end the Senate practice known as the filibuster, which is designed to delay a vote on controversial issues in order to protect strong minorities from being overrun by majorities. The Republican leader&apos;s appearance at this event endorses the Religious Right&apos;s claim that the Democratic filibuster of a small number of very conservative judges is &quot;a filibuster against people of faith.&quot;

Despite the fact that Democrats oppose these judges for their views on a variety of subjects, conservative leaders have singled out abortion and gay marriage as their chief concerns and only want judges who support their agenda. Despite the fact that many Democrats who oppose some of President Bush&apos;s nominees are themselves people of faith, Republicans and their religious supporters are questioning the faith and religious integrity of their opponents.

That is an escalation of the religious/political war. And the two together sound like assertions of a Republican theocracy. Behind these activities lies a fundamental assumption by Republican operatives and their conservative religious allies that they own religion in America. They demand that religious people vote only their way. They claim that &quot;values voters&quot; in America belong to them, and they disrespect the faith of those who disagree with their agenda. There are better words for this than just &quot;politically divisive&quot; or &quot;morally irresponsible.&quot; For these are not merely political offenses, they are religious ones. And for offenses such as these, theological terms are better - terms such as idolatry and blasphemy.

We should bring our religious convictions about all moral issues to the public square - such as the uplifting of the poor, the protection of the environment, the ethics of war, or the tragic number of abortions in America - without attacking the sincerity of other people&apos;s faith, or demanding that we should win because we are religious. We must make moral arguments and mobilize effective movements for social change that can powerfully persuade our fellow citizens, religious or not, on what is best for the common good.

What I hear, from one end of this country to the other, is how tired we are of ideological religion and how hungry we are for prophetic faith. Join me in sending a message to Senator Frist that we are people of faith, and these Religious Right leaders do not speak for us.

+ Take action: Tell Bill Frist to stop playing the faith card!

Pledge to Strengthen Social Security

Dear Working Families e-Activist,

You’ve been doing a great job telling Congress and Wall Street not to support President Bush’s plan to privatize Social Security—and so have millions of other people all over this country.

Next week—hearings on Social Security privatization begin on Capitol Hill. We need to show the support of tens of thousands of petition signers who want Congress to strengthen Social Security, not weaken it with risky privatization plans. Help us reach our goal by downloading the Petition to Strengthen Social Security today and getting signatures in your workplace. Click here to download it, or keep reading:

So far your support is working--every day, what little support Bush&apos;s privatization plan ever had dwindles. He can&apos;t even get his own party to champion privatization on Capitol Hill, where hearings on privatization begin April 26. They know they’d pay a high price with voters for destroying Social Security’s guaranteed benefits. But the president says he’ll redouble his efforts to pass privatization. We have to convince Congress to drop this attack on Social Security altogether.

To do that, we need numbers—tens of thousands of signatures on petitions collected in workplaces in every part of America. We need you to help collect those signatures so we can show Congress just how big public opposition to Social Security privatization really is. Please take one moment now to download the Petition to Strengthen Social Security by clicking the following link:

 www.aflcio.org/issuespolitics/socialsecurity/upload/petition.pdf 

When you download the petition, a message will be sent automatically letting your members of Congress know you are circulating the petition urging them to pledge to strengthen Social Security and oppose privatization. Once you have downloaded the petition, please take it to your workplace and collect as many signatures as you can. Make additional copies of the petition to get even more signatures. Then fax the petition back to us at 202-637-5172.

Privatizing Social Security would slash guaranteed benefits by some 40 percent—even for workers who decide not to have privatized accounts. After a lifetime of work, that can add up to $152,000 in lost benefits. Privatization also would create massive, new federal debt and open Social Security up to political corruption—because politicians would decide which Wall Street firms would manage our money in privatized accounts. And the huge costs of privatization could force an increase in the retirement age to 70.

With all that’s at stake, it’s well worth investing a little time now to circulate our Petition to Strengthen Social Security in your workplace. Please click the following link to download the petition:

 www.aflcio.org/issuespolitics/socialsecurity/upload/petition.pdf 

Please don’t delay. We can stop Social Security privatization now if we all work together and don’t stop until Congress rejects President Bush’s plan. We need those numbers—working people in every workplace signing up to protect their retirement security. Please take one more action now: Click the following link to urge others you know who are concerned about Social Security to download and circulate this petition in their worksites, too:

 www.unionvoice.org/campaign/Protect_SocialSecurity/forward 

Thanks for fighting for Social Security and retirement security for all working families. Look below to read the Pledge to Strengthen Social Security you are asking your members of Congress to sign.

In solidarity,

Working Families e-Activist Network, AFL-CIO
April 21, 2005

Pledge to Strengthen Social Security

I pledge to the people of my district/state and to the American people that I will work to strengthen retirement security, including Social Security. I will oppose Social Security privatization proposals that would:

Require cuts in guaranteed benefits to pay for private accounts.
Weaken the system by diverting money from the Social Security Trust Fund to pay for private accounts.
Increase the federal deficit to pay for private accounts.
Increase the retirement age to pay for private accounts.

Ratzinger on war

&quot;There were not sufficient reasons to unleash a war against Iraq. To say nothing of the fact that, given the new weapons that make possible destructions that go beyond the combatant groups, today we should be asking ourselves if it is still licit to admit the very existence of a &apos;just war.&apos;&quot;


- Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI, May 2, 2003.

The New Pope: The Silencer?

 LEONARD SWIDLER , dialogue@temple.edu, http://global-dialogue.org,
http://astro.temple.edu/~dialogue/Swidler/swidvit.html

Professor of Catholic thought and interreligious dialogue at Temple University, Swidler said today: &quot;I have known Ratzinger since 1964 when I published an article of his promoting ecumenical dialogue in the first issue of the new scholarly journal my wife Arlene and I launched, the Journal of Ecumenical Studies. Unfortunately he is not so ecumenically minded anymore.&quot;

Swidler added: &quot;Ratzinger is Mr. Inside. John Paul II was quite open in terms of the outside world, of symbolic gestures in dealing with other faiths, of affirming that other religions had some truths. But internal to the Catholic Church, he was very authoritarian. You could say that in internal matters Ratzinger was his hatchet man. He attempted to silence or stifle other thinkers. For example, recently Jesuit theologian Father Roger Haight was simply told by Ratzinger&apos;s office that he couldn&apos;t teach at Catholic institutions.&quot; Among Swidler&apos;s many books is &quot;The Church in Anguish: Has the Vatican Betrayed Vatican II?&quot; (co-edited with Hans Küng, who helped bring Ratzinger to the prestigious University of Tübingen and who Ratzinger would later attempt to silence).

 FARID ESACK , esack@xavier.edu, http://uk.geocities.com/faridesack,
http://www.zmag.org/muslimwatch/muslimwatch.cfm

Esack, a well-known Muslim theologian, is university professor and chair in ethics, religion and society at Xavier University in Cincinnati. He has placed a black sheet on his office door with &quot;Benedict XVI&quot; written on it. He said today: &quot;This is a really really dark day for Catholicism, for Muslims, for women, for Africans. John Paul II had brought more publicity and power to the Holy See. Benedict now comes in with far greater expectation and ability to wield power as a result. He also comes with a kind of ideological commitment, a religious fundamentalism, that makes him doubly dangerous. I met Ratzinger on one occasion and it was clear he was not a supporter of interreligious dialogue.&quot;

Added Esack: &quot;This is particularly bad news for Africans, for culture of life, since Ratzinger has been such an opponent of the use of condoms to prevent the spread of AIDS. All in all, it seems like part of an onslaught of regressive forces making the world a very dangerous place for all of us.&quot;

 MARY JO McCONAHAY , mcconahay@pacificnews.org, http://alternet.org/story/21814

Mary Jo McConahay, Latin American editor for Pacific News Service, wrote the recent article &quot;The Silencer.&quot; She said today: &quot;One key to Benedict&apos;s papacy may be found far from the elegant St. Peter&apos;s Square and far from after-mass coffees in U.S. church halls, in the villages and rough urban misery belts of Latin America, the globe&apos;s most Catholic region, where Ratzinger made one of his hallmark stands as a Vatican force. There in the 1980s, he powerfully confronted the fast-moving tide of liberation theology, an intellectual and popular movement that linked Catholic theology and political activism in everyday issues of social justice and human rights. Officially, Ratzinger reversed the tide, forbidding certain Catholic theologians to publish in what was called a &apos;silencing.&apos;&quot;

&quot;WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE IS TRUE EVEN THOUGH YOU CANNOT PROVE IT?&quot; - PAUL DAVIES

Great minds can sometimes guess the truth before they have either the evidence or arguments for it (Diderot called it having the &quot;esprit de divination&quot;). What do you believe is true even though you cannot prove it

 http://www.edge.org/q2005/q05_print.html 

 PAUL DAVIES 
Physicist, Macquarie University, Sydney; Author, How to Build a Time Machine

One of the biggest of the Big Questions of existence is, Are we alone in the universe? Science has provided no convincing evidence one way or the other. It is certainly possible that life began with a bizarre quirk of chemistry, an accident so improbable that it happened only once in the entire observable universe—and we are it. On the other hand, maybe life gets going wherever there are earthlike planets. We just don&apos;t know, because we have a sample of only one. However, no known scientific principle suggests an inbuilt drive from matter to life. No known law of physics or chemistry favors the emergence of the living state over other states. Physics and chemistry are, as far as we can tell, &quot;life blind.&quot;

Yet I don&apos;t believe that life is a freak event. I think the universe is teeming with it. I can&apos;t prove it; indeed, it could be that mankind will never know the answer for sure. If we find life in our solar system, it most likely got there from Earth (or vice versa) in rocks kicked off planets by comet impacts. And to go beyond the solar system is the stuff of dreams. The best hope is that we develop instruments sensitive enough to detect life on extra-solar planets from Earth orbit. But, whilst not impossible, this is a formidable technical challenge.

So why do I think we are not alone, when we have no evidence for life beyond Earth? Not for the fallacious popular reason: &quot;the universe is so big there must be life out there somewhere.&quot; Simple statistics shows this argument to be bogus. If life is in fact a freak chemical event, it would be so unlikely to occur that it wouldn&apos;t happen twice among a trillion trillion trillion planets. Rather, I believe we are not alone because life seems to be a fundamental, and not merely an incidental, property of nature. It is built into the great cosmic scheme at the deepest level, and therefore likely to be pervasive. I make this sweeping claim because life has produced mind, and through mind, beings who do not merely observe the universe, but have come to understand it through science, mathematics and reasoning. This is hardly an insignificant embellishment on the cosmic drama, but a stunning and unexpected bonus. Somehow life is able to link up with the basic workings of the cosmos, resonating with the hidden mathematical order that makes it tick. And that&apos;s a quirk too far for me.

SOLDIER CAPABILITIES

Researchers at the University of Missouri-Columbia have developed a computer model that predicts the heat stress for combat fighters, an advancement that could help save lives by better understanding soldiers&apos; physical limitations.

During the initial test, subjects -- seven men and seven women ranging in age from 19 to 26 -- wore protective clothing and equipment used by the U.S. Armed Forces and walked on treadmills at different speeds while sensors measured physical variables, such as skin temperature, core temperature, and metabolic and heart rates. The tests were conducted in temperatures ranging from 75 to 110 degrees F and humidity ranging from 25% to 75%. The computer model used individual characteristics such as maximum oxygen consumption, body fat percentage, height, weight, heat acclimation, and age to predict the person&apos;s heat stress.

The model can be used on any handheld computer or palm pilot, making it easy for field testing. According to the researchers, it could be helpful for firefighters, pilots, workers in hazardous environments, and NASA.

WELCOME TO OUR LAIR, MURDOCH SAYS TO BLOGGERS

 http://www.newscorp.com/news/news_247.html 

In a speech at the American Society of Newspaper Editors&apos; conference, News Corporation chief executive Rupert Murdoch pondered the impact that the growth in online news is having on newspapers. &quot;The trends are against us,&quot; he warned. Murdoch also mused on the possibilities of harnessing bloggers to the corporate news cart. &quot;We need to be the destination for those bloggers. We need to encourage readers to think of the web as the place to go to engage our reporters and editors in more extended discussions about the way a particular story was reported or researched or presented.&quot; Newspapers might experiment with using bloggers to extend coverage, he suggested. However, Murdoch cautioned that bloggers could pose a risk to &quot;our standards for accuracy and reliability.&quot;

BIG CITY NEWSPAPERS GET BLOG FRIENDLY

WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- The San Francisco Chronicle plans to launch blogs &quot;in the near future,&quot; according to Robert Rosenthal, the newspaper&apos;s managing editor. But the &quot;exact form and structure ... so that it fits journalistic standards,&quot; is up in the air, he told a reporter from the Contra Costa (Calif.) Times. Adding Web logs to its editorial mix will put the Chronicle in the company of several major publications, including The New York Times and the Dallas Morning News, which also have added bloggers&apos; voices. &quot;As long as we can stay within the bounds of accuracy and impartiality, and where it doesn&apos;t mean reporters are spending their day blogging instead of reporting, I see a place for it,&quot; said Bill Keller, executive editor of The Times

Blogging was also the subject of a workshop program at the NAB, with the title &quot;Are We Becoming Irrelevant?&quot; An audience of about 50 attended, three of whom said they were bloggers, and most of whom said they read other peoples&apos; blogs, LostRemote.com reported. Most also indicated they knew what podcasting is, but only five said they listen to any of the audio programs which are delivered over the Internet for playback on portable media devices.

Speaking of the NAB and Las Vegas, there&apos;s been grumbling by some of the 100,000 show attendees about Internet connectivity. Scott Jones, a former news director and publisher of the industry trade Web site FTVLive.com said that while the convention center has wireless access

Borowitz Report - obesity victory shocker

U.S. WINS WAR ON OBESITY
&apos;Mission Accomplished,&apos; Says Bush, Sparking Nationwide Pig-out

Just hours after the Centers for Disease Control issued a new study finding that the dangers of being overweight had been overstated in the past, President George W. Bush declared America&apos;s war on obesity over.

Riding in a Navy helicopter, the president made a perfect landing on the roof of a McDonalds in Columbus, Ohio to make the dramatic announcement.

&quot;Mission accomplished,&quot; the president said, adding with a jaunty wink, &quot;and Supersize me!&quot;

The president&apos;s remarks sparked a nationwide feeding frenzy as people who once thought of themselves as obese rushed to stuff their faces with an abandon bordering on hysteria.

From coast to coast, managers of Applebee&apos;s, Olive Garden, Burger King and Kentucky Fried Chicken reported rampaging crowds unlike any witnessed since the run on the banks at the outset of the Great Depression.

While the nation celebrated its stunning triumph over obesity, some of the nation&apos;s most prominent fast food restaurants adjusted their marketing to embrace the euphoria.

Boston Market said that the company would change its motto from &quot;We&apos;re Always Cooking&quot; to &quot;We&apos;re Always Cooking, Because You&apos;re Constantly Eating, You Gluttonous Pig.&quot;

Meanwhile, standing on the roof of the McDonalds in Columbus, Mr. Bush savored the nation&apos;s victory in the war on obesity, saying that although the nation had not yet won the war on terror, &quot;One out of two ain&apos;t bad.&quot;

Speaking at the White House, spokesman Ari Fleischer echoed the president&apos;s words: &quot;This is a great day for the United States, and a great day for Dick Cheney.&quot;

Elsewhere, Pope Benedict XVI today was declared infallible, replacing former &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; champ Ken Jennings.

GETTING SPIN WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM FRIENDS

&quot;As House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-TX) faces increasing scrutiny over various allegations of ethical lapses, a powerful cadre of friends and colleagues is stepping up to help protect his image,&quot; reports PR Week. DeLay legal advisor and former Republican National Committee strategist Barbara Comstock heads the group, which includes DCI Group&apos;s Stuart Roy and Edelman&apos;s Jonathan Grella. They are &quot;placing supporters on cable news channels and radio talk shows,&quot; distributing talking points to conservative groups, and asking &quot;prominent conservatives,&quot; including Ketchum&apos;s Susan Molinari, &quot;to speak out on DeLay&apos;s behalf.&quot; This &quot;unofficial PR offensive&quot; is separate from DeLay&apos;s congressional office, which &quot;developed its own media war room to combat the accusations.&quot;

On the other side, Fenton Communications is working with MoveOn.org, Campaign for America&apos;s Future and Common Cause &quot;to tarnish and ultimately unseat&quot; DeLay.

8 days: They want power to appoint extreme-right judges. We can stop them.


We may only have eight days to stop right-wing Republicans from seizing absolute power to appoint far-right judges. We&apos;ve created a powerful new ad, &quot;Smashing the Courts,&quot; that exposes Republicans’ attempts to break the rules of the Senate and stack the courts. Together, we’re trying to raise $400,000 TODAY to get it on the air. Take a look and chip in:

&quot;Smashing the Courts&quot; Script

Video
We see the word &quot;filibuster&quot; forming on the screen. Then we see it being smashed by a gavel. Then we see the words: &quot;Right to Privacy. Clean Air. Clean Water. Minimum Wage. Workplace Safety.&quot; Each phrase is smashed by a judge&apos;s gavel.

Audio
Voiceover: &quot;A 200-year-old Senate rule is all that stands between you and extremist judges. Radical Republicans are trying to break that rule. Why? So they can push through judges who will rule against: Your right to privacy. Clean air. Clean water. The minimum wage. Workplace safety. A few moderate Republicans are standing up to the radicals. What will your senators do?&quot;

(The final ad script may differ slightly from the text above.)

Dear MoveOn member,
We&apos;ve been burning the midnight oil to create a compelling new ad that visually presents what&apos;s at stake in our battle to stop the right-wing judicial takeover. For Americans who don&apos;t understand the impact extremist judges can have, our ad sets the record straight: it shows judges’ gavels shattering the protections and rights we hold dear, including worker rights, the right to privacy, the minimum wage, and environmental laws. For the three Republicans we need to win the vote next week, this ad can help add pressure and push them over the top.

Running the ad nation-wide will alert the public to this under-the-radar attack on the independence of our courts. We&apos;re also developing radio ads that will personally target the Republicans whose votes could make all the difference. But to do those things, we need to raise $400,000 pretty quickly together—we&apos;ve got to get &quot;Smashing the Courts&quot; and our radio ads on the air in the next few days.

Airing &quot;Smashing the Courts&quot; once in Washington, DC costs about $150. Can you chip in to help run the ad once? Or, if that&apos;s out of your price range, can you subsidize a third of an ad—$50? You can take a look at the script and give online right now at:

 https://www.moveonpac.org/donate/gavel.html?id=5387-5514896-H2y2CnLN6j7BuGgPQetxPw&amp;t;=1 

Here&apos;s how the New York Times Magazine put it on Sunday: &quot;Imagine a country in which Social Security, job-safety laws and environmental protections were unconstitutional. Imagine judges longing for that. Imagine one of them as the next Supreme court nominee.&quot; And I&apos;d add to that: &quot;Imagine we&apos;re powerless to stop them.&quot;

We could be facing that situation as soon as next Thursday—Republicans want to break the Senate rules to seize absolute power to appoint extremist judges. That&apos;s the bad news. The good news: when Americans hear about these judges&apos; far-right ideology, and the way Republicans are grabbing control to appoint them, they&apos;re with us. We just have to get the word out—and we have eight days to do it.

This fight is about saving one of the last barriers standing between radical Republicans and total control of the American political system. That barrier, the filibuster, was created for this kind of situation: it&apos;s designed to force the members of the Senate to find judicial candidates who they can all agree on, and to make it difficult to give lifetime appointments to radical zealots. It&apos;s a crucial part of the system of checks and balances that makes our country work.

In their plan to change the rules of the Senate and lock out Democrats, Republicans are banking on the idea that Americans won&apos;t care about the process for picking judges. But that&apos;s simply not true—Americans know that fair and independent judges are a critical part of our democracy. It&apos;s up to us to help sound the alarm.

Thanks in part to work of MoveOn members and our allies, three moderate Republicans have already come out against the judicial takeover plan. If we can get three more, we win. This ad, and your support, could get us there.

Can you join with thousands of other MoveOn members and help put this ad on the air today? You can give quickly and securely, by credit card or check, at:

 https://www.moveonpac.org/donate/gavel.html?id=5387-5514896-H2y2CnLN6j7BuGgPQetxPw&amp;t;=2 

An America where the courts are stacked against progressives is a pretty scary prospect. But we only need to win over three more Republicans to win this critical fight, and the American people are on our side. Together, we can win one for the Constitution.

Thanks for everything,

–Eli, James, Marika, Joan and the MoveOn PAC Team

Earth Day: &quot;Sleepwalking into an Apocalypse&quot;?

 BERN JOHNSON, MECHE LU , bern@elaw.org, meche@elaw.org, http://www.elaw.org

Johnson is executive director of the U.S. office of the Environmental Law Alliance Worldwide, which works with attorneys in 60 countries to protect the environment through law. He said today: &quot;The damage that we are doing to our global climate is the greatest environmental challenge ever. Governments are not stepping up to meet this challenge, so we are helping grassroots lawyers around the world find ways to take on climate change.&quot;

Lu is an environmental research scientist with the group and recently returned from Chile and Peru, where she assisted local advocates working to protect wild rivers in the Patagonia region of Chile and protect public health near a U.S.-owned smelter in the Peruvian Andes. She said today:
&quot;People all over the world want a voice in protecting their environment. To have a strong voice, communities need legal and scientific information.
Decisions about the environment are too often made by governments that put the interests of corporations ahead of communities.&quot;

 ROSS GELBSPAN , ross@theworld.com,
http://www.motherjones.com/news/featurex/2005/05/world_burns.html

Gelbspan is the author of the book &quot;Boiling Point: How Politicians, Big Oil and Coal, Journalists, and Activists Have Fueled a Climate Crisis -- And What We Can Do to Avert Disaster.&quot; He also contributed to a special section in the current issue of Mother Jones magazine: &quot;As the World Burns: Think tanks and journalists funded by ExxonMobil are out to convince you global warming is a hoax.&quot; Gelbspan said today: &quot;As the signals from the planet become progressively more urgent, the Bush administration turns its back on the challenge and the U.S. press remains in denial. We are, as the British paper The Independent put it recently, &apos;sleepwalking into an Apocalypse.&apos;&quot;

He added: &quot;Carbon levels are rising at more than 2 parts per million per year -- which means they will top 400 near the end of this decade. At that point, scientists project that the warming will set off irreversible, runaway changes. As the head of the UN&apos;s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said recently, humanity must make &apos;very deep&apos; cuts in its carbon fuel use &apos;if humanity is to survive.&apos; It is clearly time to put the global environment in general, and climate change in particular, at the top of America&apos;s political agenda.&quot;

 JOHN STAUBER , stauber@tds.net, http://www.prwatch.org/books/tsigfy.html

Co-author of the book &quot;Toxic Sludge Is Good For You: Lies, Damn Lies and the Public Relations Industry,&quot; Stauber organized a teach-in during the first Earth Day while in high school. He said today: &quot;A popular and powerful environmental movement was born on the first Earth Day, April 22, 1970. Today the public&apos;s desire for a clean, healthy and sustainable environment is bipartisan and stronger than ever, but the green movement has become a weak political loser. Despite the fact that every year hundreds of millions of dollars are raised and spent by the dozen largest national environmental groups, these groups are in retreat.&quot;

Stauber continued: &quot;What began as a powerful popular movement has turned into competing non-profit companies that merely use their grassroots members for fundraising, failing to organize and empower them into the potent political force they must become to win real change. Thirty-five years after the first Earth Day, a revolution is needed in the ranks of the greens. Until the environmental movement rebuilds itself from the grassroots up and demands accountability from its own organizations, it will continue its losing ways.&quot;

Recent Events Put United States on Path to Nationalization of Health Spending, Columnist Says

Access this story and related links online:

 http://www.kaisernetwork.org/daily_reports/rep_index.cfm?DR_ID=29478 

General Motors&apos; recent problems with health costs, the new Medicare law, the &quot;state and local health care time bomb&quot; and &quot;Congress&apos; recent refusal to trim soaring state Medicaid subsidies&quot; all indicate a &quot;path toward the nationalization of health care spending -- an idea that&apos;s so easy to slam politically yet so sensible for business that only Republicans can sell it,&quot; columnist Matt Miller writes in a Fortune opinion piece. There is a &quot;potential common agenda lurking beneath today&apos;s health cost angst&quot; -- a two-step solution to the problem, Miller adds. He outlines a plan to nationalize health care spending, not delivery, under which employers would &quot;move a chunk of private-sector health costs to government,&quot; and the government would &quot;find ways to guarantee coverage for all while re-engineering health care delivery to lower costs in the long term (without the price controls that stall innovation abroad).&quot; He writes that the government could ask &quot;employers to keep, say, 80% of their roughly $400 billion health spending in the game -- and pledge to hold them harmless from increases in future costs.&quot; In return, &quot;business would support the general tax increases needed to plug the $80 billion annual hole this &apos;business health cost relief&apos; would create,&quot; Miller continues. Responding to skeptics, Miller notes that the new Medicare law &quot;was the first step in the Republican-led socialization of health spending.&quot; He adds, &quot;Companies have been clobbered funding retiree health plans. The GOP felt their pain, and presto, $750 billion over 10 years moved from private to public budgets.&quot; Miller concludes by asking, &quot;[D]oesn&apos;t American business have enough to do without managing health care, too?&quot;
(Miller, Fortune, 5/2).

UFCW FILES WAL-MART COMPLAINT--

The United Food and Commercial Workers filed an unfair labor practice complaint against Wal-Mart on April 12. Filed with the NLRB, the complaint alleges the retail behemoth violated federal labor law by bribing employees to report on co-workers who supported joining a union.

The complaint cites a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; report that former Wal-Mart vice chairman Thomas Coughlin paid for information about union support. During the time Coughlin allegedly made the payments, Wal-Mart employees &quot;abruptly abandoned&quot; efforts to form unions in 13 states, according to the complaint.

Salazar calls tactics of Focus on the Family &apos;un-Christian&apos;

By M.E. SPRENGELMEYER
Scripps Howard News Service
April 20, 2005

WASHINGTON - Colorado Sen. Ken Salazar lashed out at Focus on the Family Thursday, saying the group is using &quot;un-Christian&quot; political tactics in the fight over White House judicial appointments.

Salazar defended Democrats&apos; right to filibuster objectionable nominees and blasted the Colorado Springs, Colo.-based evangelical Christian group for recent ads urging him to &quot;STOP the nonsense.&quot;

&quot;I do think that what has happened here is there has been a hijacking of the U.S. Senate by what I call the religious right wing of the country,&quot; Salazar told reporters at a Capitol Hill news conference Wednesday.

He singled out Focus on the Family by name, objecting to full-page newspaper ads the ministry&apos;s political arm recently placed, targeting 20 senators in 15 states.

&quot;I think what has happened is Focus on the Family has been hijacking Christianity and become an appendage of the Republican Party,&quot; Salazar said in an interview. &quot;I think it&apos;s using Christianity and religion in a very unprincipled way.&quot;

A spokesman for Focus on the Family fired back, saying Salazar was siding with liberal Democrats who have questioned some judicial nominees about their strong religious views and stalled their nominations.

&quot;I&apos;m flabbergasted the senator would call our Christianity into question,&quot; said Tom Minnery, vice president of public policy for Focus.

&quot;Some of the nominees will be filibustered by the Democrats because of their religious views. As a Catholic, I would think the senator would be especially alarmed about the anti-Catholicism of some of his colleagues.&quot;

Judicial appointments have been a key issue for evangelical Christian groups, who blame judges for not enforcing decency standards, denying public displays of the Ten Commandments or recently refusing to reinstate a feeding tube for Florida hospital patient Terri Schiavo.

There has been heated rhetoric from all sides this month, as Senate Republicans threaten to seek rule changes giving all judicial nominees a right to an up-or-down vote. As things stand, the minority party can use traditional filibuster procedures to delay an appointment indefinitely unless there are 60 votes to proceed. Republicans currently control 55 seats in the Senate.

If Republicans successfully change the rules, Democrats say they might bring other legislative work to a standstill.

At a press conference with Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., Salazar said it was wrong for Republicans to end rules that have worked in the U.S. Senate for two centuries. Democrats called that the &quot;nuclear option&quot; because they consider it so drastic.

&quot;Ninety-six percent of his appointees have been confirmed, and yet the president and (Senate) Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) have advocated breaking the rules, trying to get 100 percent,&quot; Salazar said.

Republicans accused Salazar of abandoning a promise from last year&apos;s election campaign. Back then, Salazar told the Rocky Mountain News editorial board that he favored giving all of President Bush&apos;s judicial nominees an up-or-down vote.

&quot;It&apos;s a shame that only months after being sworn in for senator for the state of Colorado, Ken Salazar is already turning his back on voters,&quot; said Danny Diaz, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee.

Salazar did not dispute making the campaign pledge. He said he has since learned how traditional filibuster rules help make sure lifetime judicial appointees have at least some support from both political parties.

&quot;I strongly believe there ought to be a bipartisan approach to how we consider judges in the U.S. Senate,&quot; Salazar said.

If Republicans back down from the proposed rule changes, Salazar and Lieberman said they would consider voting to approve some of the seven most controversial nominees whose nominations have been stalled.

&quot;WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE IS TRUE EVEN THOUGH YOU CANNOT PROVE IT?&quot; - HAIM HARARI

Great minds can sometimes guess the truth before they have either the evidence or arguments for it (Diderot called it having the &quot;esprit de divination&quot;). What do you believe is true even though you cannot prove it

 http://www.edge.org/q2005/q05_print.html 

 HAIM HARARI 
Physicist, former President, Weizmann Institute of Science

The electron has been with us for over a century, laying the foundations to the electronic revolution and all of information technology. It is believed to be a point-like, elementary and indivisible particle. Is it?

The neutrino, more than a million times lighter than the electron, was predicted in the 1920&apos;s and discovered in the 1950&apos;s. It plays a crucial role in the creation of the stars, the sun and the heavy elements. It is elusive, invisible and weakly interacting. It is also considered fundamental and indivisible. Is it?

Quarks do not exist as free objects, except at extremely tiny distances, deep within the confines of the particles which are constructed from them. Since the 1960&apos;s we believe that they are the most fundamental indivisible building blocks of protons, neutrons and nuclei. Are they?

Nature has created two additional, totally unexplained, replicas of the electron, the neutrino and the most abundant quarks, u and d, forming three &quot;generations&quot; of fundamental particles. Each &quot;generation&quot; of particles is identical to the other two in all properties, except that the particle masses are radically different. Since each &quot;generation&quot; includes four fundamental particles, we end up with 12 different particles, which are allegedly indivisible, point-like and elementary. Are they?

The Atom, the nucleus and the proton, each in its own time, were considered elementary and indivisible, only to be replaced later by smaller objects as the fundamental building blocks. How can we be so arrogant as to exclude the possibility that this will happen again? Why would nature arbitrarily produce 12 different objects, with a very orderly pattern of electric charges and &quot;color forces&quot;, with simple charge ratios between seemingly unrelated particles (such as the electron and the quark) and with a pattern of masses, which appears to be taken from the results of a lottery? Doesn&apos;t this &quot;smell&quot; again of further sub-particle structure?

There is absolutely no experimental evidence for a further substructure within all of these particles. There is no completely satisfactory theory which might explain how such light and tiny particles can contain objects moving with enormous energies, a requirement of quantum mechanics. This is, presumably, why the accepted &quot;party line&quot; of particle physicists is to assume that we already have reached the most fundamental level of the structure of matter.

For over twenty years, the hope has been that the rich spectrum of so-called fundamental particles will be explained as various modes of string vibrations and excitations. The astonishingly tiny string or membrane, rather than the point-like object, is allegedly at the bottom of the ladder describing the structure of matter. However, in spite of absolutely brilliant and ingenious mathematical work, not one experimental number has been explained in more than twenty years, on the basis of the string hypothesis.

Based on common sense and on an observation of the pattern of the known particles, without any experimental evidence and without any comprehensive theory, I have believed for many years, and I continue to believe, that the electron, the neutrino and the quarks are divisible. They are presumably made of different combinations of the same small number (two?) of more fundamental sub-particles. The latter may or may not have the string structure, and may or may not be themselves composites.

Will we live to see the components of the electron?

Scientists evaluate genes associated with longevity

Monday, April 18, 2005 – Scientists at the BC Cancer Agency&apos;s Genome Sciences Centre in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and at the University of Missouri-Columbia have collaborated on a detailed study to elucidate gene-expression patterns implicated in the aging process. Their results appear online today in the journal Genome Research.

Led by Dr. Angela Brooks-Wilson, Senior Scientist at the BC Cancer Agency&apos;s Genome Sciences Centre, and Dr. Donald Riddle, Professor of Biology at the University of Missouri, the team prepared SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) libraries from roundworms that contained a mutated form of the daf-2 gene, which is a principal lifespan-determining factor in C. elegans. Worms that lack fully functional daf-2 exhibit significantly extended lives, persisting approximately twice as long as their wild-type counterparts.

Daf-2 was first reported as a critical aging-associated gene in 1993, but since that time, scientists have identified dozens of additional genes that are crucial for longevity. &quot;Aging is a complex process,&quot; explains Dr. Brooks-Wilson. &quot;It is commonly believed that a variety of genes and metabolic pathways contribute to the deterioration of cells, tissues and organisms during aging.&quot;

In an effort to perform a comprehensive analysis of gerontology-related genes, the researchers compared gene-expression libraries obtained from daf-2 mutants to those obtained from controls at different ages. They predicted that genes exhibiting coordinated up-or down-regulation from early to late adulthood would be those most critical to the vital biological process of aging. In addition, they reasoned that some of the genes that were differentially expressed between daf-2 mutants and controls would also be associated with longevity.

Most strikingly, the scientists observed that during the early and mid-life adult stages of daf-2 mutants, genes associated with metabolic processes exhibited repressed expression. This &apos;hypo-
metabolic&apos; state, which involved major lipid, nucleic acid, protein, and energy pathways, became less pronounced with advanced age. &quot;We speculate that the apparent metabolic repression in early and mid-life adults contributes substantially to the observed longevity of daf-2,&quot; says Dr. Julius Halaschek-Wiener, a researcher at the BC Cancer Agency&apos;s Genome Sciences Centre and first author on the study.

Another notable observation was that stress-response factors such as hsp, mtl-1, gst-1, and sip-1 were more abundantly expressed in the aging adult worms as compared to the early and mid-life adults. These genes were also differentially expressed between daf-2 mutants and controls, consistent with current theories that protection against cellular stress is associated with increased lifespan.

The researchers hope that their observations in C. elegans will contribute to our understanding of human aging. &quot;Many processes involved in nematode aging may have fundamental and analogous roles in humans,&quot; Dr. Brooks-Wilson explains. &quot;The human orthologs of some gene family members identified in this study have been associated with human age-related diseases.&quot;

SAGE involves the isolation of short gene-specific sequence tags and provides an unbiased and quantitative measurement of gene-expression differences. This study was the first to utilize SAGE to analyze aging-related gene-expression changes. It is expected that the large volume of SAGE data generated for this study will also be utilized to more fully annotate the C. elegans transcriptome, resulting in a refined estimate of gene number and organization in this species.

&apos;Minority Report&apos; interface created for US military

13:05 15 April 2005

NewScientist.com news service

Will Knight

The reflective gloves turn the users hand into a &apos;Swiss Army knife&apos; for manipulating data (Image: Raytheon)A computer interface inspired by the futuristic system portrayed in the movie Minority Report, starring Tom Cruise, could soon help real military personnel deal with information overload.

The film sees characters call up and manipulate video footage and other data in mid-air after donning a special pair of gloves. Now defence company Raytheon, based in Massachusetts, US, is working on a real version and has even employed John Underkoffler, the researcher who proposed the interface to the makers of the film.

Underkoffler is a science and technology consultant for Treadle and Loam Provisioners in California, US, and previously developed radical computer interfaces at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He says the new system should help military experts sift through large quantities of information quickly and efficiently.

&quot;Keystrokes and mouse clicks limit your degree of freedom,&quot; Underkoffler told The Wall Street Journal.

Swiss Army knife
The system under development at Raytheon lets users don a pair of reflective gloves and manipulate images projected on a panoramic screen. A mounted camera keeps track of hand movements and a computer interprets gestures. &quot;Your hand becomes a Swiss Army knife,&quot; says Underkoffler.

Raytheon plans to offer the technology as a way to sort through large amounts of satellite imagery and intelligence data. But the technology might also have non-military applications, says Stephen Brewster, who is also developing gesture-based computer interfaces at the University of Glasgow, UK.

&quot;I think this is a very good idea,&quot; Brewster told New Scientist. &quot;Hand gestures, unlike a mouse or pointer, work really well when data is represented on wall-sized displays, for example.&quot;

But Brewster notes that completely new user interfaces will inevitably require new ways of visualising and manipulating information. &quot;The biggest benefit comes when you develop a new way of interacting altogether,&quot; he says.

Underkoffler has previously developed a method of representing and manipulating information by projecting it onto an ordinary table or wall, known as the Luminus Room. &quot;The idea is to force graphics out of the monitor and into the real world,&quot; he says.

Borowitz Report - pope announcement shocker

RYAN SEACREST&apos;S STAR ON HOLLYWOOD WALK OF FAME OVERSHADOWS SELECTION OF NEW POPE
New Pope &apos;Bummed&apos; By Bad Timing, Pals Say

A throng estimated at over two million people jammed the streets of Hollywood, California today to cheer the announcement of &quot;American Idol&quot; host Ryan Seacrest&apos;s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, overshadowing the election in Rome of Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger of Germany to be Pope Benedict XVI.

An enormous crowd began gathering near the Walk of Fame as early as Monday morning as news swept through Hollywood that the selection of a new celebrity to adorn the fabled sidewalk was &quot;imminent.&quot;

&quot;People kept their eyes peeled to the chimney stack of the legendary Chinese Theater,&quot; said Buddy Schlantz, a veteran talent agent and observer of the Hollywood scene. &quot;They knew that white smoke meant Ryan Seacrest, while black smoke meant Simon Cowell.&quot;

Thought to be a conservative choice, Mr. Seacrest is not expected to make any radical changes in the direction of the Walk of Fame, experts said.

In Rome, friends of the newly crowned Pope Benedict XVI said that the new pontiff had been pleased with the size of the crowd he drew until he saw Mr. Seacrest&apos;s even larger crowd as he and several cardinals watched &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; at the Vatican.

&quot;He was definitely bummed by the bad timing of the whole thing,&quot; one friend of the pope said. &quot;Still, he was happy they didn&apos;t go with Simon.&quot;

Elsewhere, operators of the cruise ship Norwegian Dawn apologized for playing the theme from &quot;Titanic&quot; during the ship&apos;s storm-tossed journey, saying they should have gone with their second choice, the theme from &quot;The Poseidon Adventure.&quot;

The New Pope and &quot;Dictatorship of Relativism&quot; / CATHOLICS GET WHAT THEY DESERVE WITH RATZINGER -- BUT MUST THE WORLD SUFFER CATHOLIC DOCTRINE?

 The New Pope and &quot;Dictatorship of Relativism&quot; 

 ROBERT ELLSBERG , rellsberg@maryknoll.org, http://www.orbisbooks.com

He is author of a number of books, most recently &quot;The Saints&apos; Guide to Happiness.&quot; He said today: &quot;This would indicate that the cardinals viewed doctrinal orthodoxy as a high priority. In the afterglow of John Paul II, they seem to want to pick someone who might symbolize the late Pope&apos;s legacy. But the new Pope symbolizes only one aspect of the papacy of John Paul II -- the most divisive. It seems rather unlikely that he would be able to unify the church. I think generally it is risky to pick a theologian as pope, as opposed to someone who has a pastoral background.&quot;

 ANGELA BONAVOGLIA , angela.bona@verizon.net, http://www.goodcatholicgirls.com

Bonavoglia is author of the recently-released book &quot;Good Catholic Girls: How Women Are Leading the Fight to Change the Church.&quot; She said today: &quot;Despite his doctrinal conservatism, Pope Benedict XVI will not be able to escape the Church&apos;s very modern problems -- from a crushing priest shortage to the crying need to ordain women and married men, from controversy over Church sexual teachings to the deep damage done by clergy sexual abuse to demands from both the laity and the world&apos;s bishops for
a real voice in Church affairs.&quot;

A Jesuit priest and author of the books &quot;Virtuous Passions&quot; and &quot;Nonviolence for the Third Millennium,&quot; Harak is anti-militarism coordinator of the War Resisters League. Shortly before the cardinals began their conclave just yesterday, Cardinal Ratzinger gave a speech condemning &quot;a dictatorship of relativism.&quot; Harak said today: &quot;I am puzzled by this statement. First, it seems to be a logical contradiction: How can relativism be dictatorial? But then I&apos;m compelled to ask, &apos;What do you mean by &quot;relativism?&quot;&apos; The Catholic hierarchy seems to take certain values -- like the injunction against abortion -- very seriously. But other values they seem to be quite relativistic about. As for example when Jesus says, &apos;Love your enemies.&apos; With the U.S. Catholic bishops supporting the
insupportable invasion of Afghanistan, and being largely silent about the 100,000 Iraqis killed as a result of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, &apos;Love your enemies&apos; has been rendered so relativistic as to be at best meaningless.&quot;

Harak added: &quot;A case in point is Bishop Raymond L. Burke. When he was bishop of LaCrosse diocese in Wisconsin, he told the diocese that the Pope&apos;s really strong condemnation of the invasion of Iraq did not carry enough weight to be binding on their consciences. He did, however, say that politicians who supported abortion should be refused communion. His reward for relativizing the Pope -- not to mention contravening Jesus -- was to be made archbishop of St. Louis. That sounds relativistic to me, and the kind of relativism that leads perhaps to dictatorship, but more likely to anarchy.&quot;

 CATHOLICS GET WHAT THEY DESERVE WITH RATZINGER -- BUT MUST THE WORLD SUFFER CATHOLIC DOCTRINE? 

By Conrad Goeringer

There is a lot of griping and complaining about the selection of Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger as the next pope and head of the Roman Catholic Church.

Much of the outcry is legitimate. Atheists and secularists, however, need to confront an uncomfortable truth. In many respects, Ratzinger -- dubbed &quot;God&apos;s Rotweiler&quot; by some church insiders -- may well be &quot;correct&quot; on the issue of church doctrine. A good number of his claims pertaining to homosexuality, the status of women, the need for obedience and unthinking conformity in respect to church teachings, are probably on the mark, at least within the framework of the Roman Catholic religion. &quot;Reformists&quot; in the church may embrace novel or even trendy beliefs about women clerics, priests getting married, and acceptance of certain sexual practices. Whether they or &quot;fundamentalists&quot; like Ratzinger, who uses the term proudly, are &quot;correct&quot; depends on an excruciating deconstruction of hoary teachings, documents and unsupported beliefs.

We should care less.

Today, most of us in the western world reap the benefits of the Enlightenment, and are not forced -- at least at the muzzle of a gun or tip of a sword, or the threat of Inquisitional torture -- into accepting a religion or remaining in a faith like Catholicism. Gays, women, religious skeptics and intellectuals -- all are free to leave the pews and naves, and walk away from Mother Church. It may be difficult in many respects, there is the risk of loosing support and love from family and friends, but it can (and should) be done. We as Atheists should cheer and support those who embark on such a courageous and sometimes difficult intellectual journey!

Ultimately, the Catholic Church -- indeed, any religious group -- is and should be free to believe or proselytize any teaching, no matter how offensive, intellectually repugnant, foolish or absurd it might be. (Does this cover most beliefs? Probably...) Atheists and other critics must also be free to respond, even if this &quot;offends&quot; or &quot;insults&quot; the religious. Peaceful and robust speech, especially about religion, is necessary to the positive development of society. Government should remain neutral here, which means refusing the pleas of ecclesiastical groups to establish &quot;blasphemy&quot; laws and other restrictions on free speech, or establish special rights or privileges for religion. While Ratzinger may call homosexuals practitioners of an &quot;intrinsic moral evil,&quot; gays are free -- along with everyone else -- to criticize the church as the reactionary social Neanderthal itis.

Where we must draw the line is at those frequent times when organized religion insists on using the power of the State as its handmaid in enforcing sectarian doctrinal beliefs, or coveting privileged status. One might defend the freedom of, or freedom from, religion, but no one should be taxed, impressed or coerced into supporting religious institutions or accepting religious creeds. When Pope Benedict XVI-Ratzinger mobilizes the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops to, say, lobby for financial aid to Parochial schools, he/they are telling 30 million-plus Atheists, secularists, humanists and other nonbelievers, along with every other American citizen, that the church is entitled to our money.

If the Vatican wishes to preach against birth control, gay sex, or any other practice, and even enforce these behaviors as a condition for membership within its ranks, that is its right. Catholics, at least throughout much of the world, are free to accept or reject these teachings. Whether the church &quot;modernizes&quot; or &quot;reforms&quot; to alter these doctrines, however, is the equivalent of the Middle Ages practices of counting angels or pondering the measurement of Heaven. What needs to concern us is the powerful tendency of religious movements -- and the Vatican is perhaps the greatest offender here --
to insist that OTHERS outside the faith follow suit, and if necessary be made to bend knee and submit gratis the power of government.

Organized religion has rarely been a powerful force without the assistance of the State. Ultimately, it requires cops, lawmakers and the apparatus of government to impress religious dicta upon a population, especially where and when private, individual conduct is concerned. This might well account for the not-so-subtle tone of Vatican teachings and statements to the effect that &quot;individualism&quot; and people having &quot;too much freedom&quot; is a bad thing. The heady and near-libertine climate that permeated much of Eastern Europe in the wake of the Communist collapse was seen by the Vatican as problematic, even dangerous. Millions of people who suffered under the stifling rule of the Kremlin quickly discovered that a new authoritarian regime could coalesce around various Catholic political movements. Equally revealing was the Holy See&apos;s call for a semi-secret conclave in 1997 where U.S. prelates and other church fathers took turns &quot;denouncing American individualism, consumerism and emphasis on individual choice,&quot; as we reported in AANEWS. Bishop Donald Wuerl of Pittsburg was perhaps the most articulate proponent of this anti-Enlightenment disposition when he told fellow clerics, &quot;Heavy emphasis on the individual and his or her rights has greatly eroded the concept of the common good and its ability to call people to something beyond themselves.&quot;

We added, &quot;Wuerl echoed other prelates, too, when he denounced &apos;the privatization of religion and morality...&apos; &quot;

Indeed, &quot;Privatization of religion&quot; is what is needed now more than ever in the United States and the rest of the world. Secularism -- that institution which protects both freedom of and freedom from religion -- is the best guarantee that, indeed, men like the new Pope Ratzinger-Benedict XVI can manipulate only those who voluntarily choose to be sheep in their flock.

For the rest of us, church teachings -- or questions of how many angels can stand on the head of a pin -- must not be permitted to dictate the course of our lives, or restrict the freedom we enjoy.

An economy going nowhere

By Robert Kuttner | April 20, 2005

WHAT HAS been ailing the stock market?

Economic fundamentals haven&apos;t changed much in the past few months. The dollar has been weak for more than a year, the worsening trade imbalance is an old story, and oil prices have been high for months. So why the big dip last week?

The immediate precipitating cause is weak corporate profits coupled with ongoing worries about inflation that will likely cause the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates. But the Fed has been clear for many months that rates are going up, and a few bad earning reports do not reflect the entire economy.

Stock markets, however, are notoriously vulnerable to herd instincts. In the short run, what you think about the economy matters less than what other traders think.

Recent market behavior looked like a classic tipping-point phenomenon: A majority of investors conclude that other investors think the market is heading south and decide to bail out. When there are more sellers than buyers, stock prices fall. But what of the underlying economy? Are the bad news bears right to be pessimistic? Unfortunately, yes.

The economy has been vulnerable for some time. The recovery has been built on government borrowing at a rate that can&apos;t continue. More troublesome, a rising share of this borrowing comes from overseas. That puts pressure on the Fed to keep interest rates higher than it otherwise might to keep the foreign lenders on board and keep the dollar from sinking even lower.

Job creation and job quality have also been weakening. Although the measured unemployment is officially a decent 5.2 percent, the fraction of workers who have given up looking for jobs keeps rising, as does the percentage of long-term unemployed. And worker pay is sagging.

Disposable income is affected not just by flat earnings but by rising costs not fully captured by the inflation statistics. For instance, people are paying a larger share of medical costs that aren&apos;t covered by health plans. More adults are subsidizing grown children. Rising interest rates sock home buyers as well as consumers who rely on credit card and home equity loans. So those disappointing corporate profit figures reflect one of the most basic of economic fundamentals: Consumers with less money in their pockets don&apos;t rush out and buy products.

We last went through a serious bout of &apos;&apos;stagflation&quot; in the late 1970s. That is a condition that isn&apos;t supposed to exist in economic theory -- rising prices and rising unemployment at the same time. That inflation was triggered by high oil prices. For several years, the Federal Reserve&apos;s cure of very high interest rates worsened the disease, since the high interest rates added to consumer financing costs and also pummeled business. Inflation was eventually wrung out of the economy, and the long boom of the 1990s and that era&apos;s high-flying stock market were both built on steadily declining interest rates and well-behaved oil prices.

No longer. And now there&apos;s a new factor: the arrival of China and India as major players. On the one hand, consumers benefit from inexpensive imported products. On the other hand, American workers have trouble competing at the going wage, and earnings are battered down.

The latest wrinkle is that China and India are adding to worldwide demand for raw materials -- oil, but also steel, timber, and all the other ingredients of an advanced economy. The result is that oil prices and other commodity prices are likely to stay high and even rising for the foreseeable future. That adds to consumer costs, shows up in inflation statistics, and prompts the Fed to hike interest rates.

But high commodity prices caused by rising global demand aren&apos;t the classic inflation that represents our economy overheating. And it&apos;s not cured by tight money. On the contrary, higher domestic interest rates just depress the US economy, but without significantly reducing Asia&apos;s appetite for oil and other raw materials.

What to do? There is no easy cure. There are, however, two constructive things the administration might pursue. First, it could stop running the immense deficits that create so much dependence on foreign borrowing. Second, it could get serious about energy self-sufficiency built on new technologies. That would simultaneously create American jobs and reduce dependence on imported oil.

The White House, of course, has no enthusiasm for either policy. What a pity, both for the economy and for the administration&apos;s own political fortunes.

Bigger Isn&apos;t Always Better

Volume X Issue 13 - April 19, 2005

We’ll say this for energy industry lobbyists: they’re persistent. No matter how many times you knock ‘em down, they just get up and come right back at you. This week, the energy bill, already a two-time loser, is on the floor of the House, making its third run at a win. Congress has rejected this bill before and needs to reject it again. This legislative beast threatens to drain the U.S. Treasury with its package of special interest handouts and tax breaks for energy companies.

Despite the bill’s proponents’ claims to the contrary, bigger isn’t always better when it comes to legislation. In April, legislators in the House of Representatives began circulating a new draft of the energy bill, titled the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which contained nearly $50 billion in federal authorized spending and $7.7 billion more in tax breaks. In the weeks that it took for the bill to find its way to the floor, the cost grew to nearly $90 billion.

That Occupation Feeling

Iraq News can only underscore Michael Rubin&apos;s points here. For example, Laith Kubba, who accompanied Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick on his recent trip to Iraq, took anti-US positions at odds with the goal of ousting Saddam, when that was popular in some quarters. Most egregiously, Kubba opposed the Iraq Liberation Act, passed by Congress in the fall of 1998. He told Britain&apos;s Independent newspaper then, &quot;This is another blunder by the administration. . . .The only result of this will be to turn Iraq into another Lebanon.&quot; (October 16, 1998) - Laurie Mylroie

 That Occupation Feeling 
U.S.-embassy behavior in Iraq makes for an awkward relationship with Iraqis.

By Michael Rubin

Baghdad, Iraq — Three times a week, the newly elected Iraqi national assembly sits. Committees meet in between sessions. The novelty for the press has worn off. Members drink tea and soft drinks, and hold sidebar conversations in the hallways, not much different from the way congressmen do in Washington.

The January 30, 2005, elections were real. Iraqis defied expectations and flocked to the polls. Pride is still palpable. Billboards dot Baghdad, in Sunni and Shia neighborhoods alike, showing old men and women showing off their purple-tipped fingers. If Iraqis did not like the billboards, they would have simply defaced them. Most Iraqis remain grateful for the liberation which made elections possible, but they resent the manner in which U.S.-Iraqi partnership degenerated into occupation. The issue is not the presence of American troops. Iraqis across the ethnic and sectarian spectrum recognize that members of the Coalition are putting their lives on the line for Iraq&apos;s future. Rather, the issue is arrogance.

Almost three months after the elections, many Iraqi officials say they have seen no change in American behavior. Iraqi voters punished Interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, not because he is secular, but rather because of corruption within his administration and because he was more attuned to American issues than Iraqi desires. Likewise, Adnan Pachachi, a State Department favorite who often dined with Secretary of State Colin Powell during his visits to Iraq, failed to win a single seat. His mansion in the Mansour district of Baghdad lies empty. Iraqis disparage their former statesman, who wanted the perks of position but, having lost, was unwilling to invest time in the country he hoped to lead.

Iraqi political leaders say the new State Department leadership made a diplomatic gaffe when Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick visited Baghdad accompanied by Laith Kubba who, despite his National Endowment for Democracy position, has had long personal involvement in Iraqi politics, most recently with Pachachi&apos;s movement. That Kubba would accompany an official delegation may have been innocent, but the victorious candidates interpreted it as the State Department wanting to play favorites, rather than respecting the Iraqi electorate. Politicians and ordinary Iraqis alike resent the implicit suggestion that embassy officials know better than Iraqis who should lead them.

While some Iraqis increasingly whisper doubt about whether Dawa leader Ibrahim Jaafari can form a government before the time allotted to him by the Transitional Administrative Law expires, Iraq&apos;s political life continues. Politicians&apos; houses fill up at night and committees hold deliberations by day. They debate a number of issues, not only constitutional issues, but also formation of the new government. On April 6, 2005, a committee forwarded a proposal to the national assembly, which voted unanimously to move the new national assembly from the convention center to the newly refurbished defense ministry.

The reasons were many. First and foremost is the issue of sovereignty. The building the Coalition Provisional Authority assigned to the defense ministry had been built as the seat of the Iraqi parliament, although the 1958 revolution and its volatile aftermath meant that the parliament had never met there. Transferring the seat of national sovereignty to the building would symbolize the rebirth of democracy, after a half century of dictatorship.

As important to the elected Iraqis is the fact that the defense ministry lies outside the Green Zone, renamed the International Zone by American officials, but still referred to by its old name on the Iraqi street. The fortified neighborhood has come to symbolize everything Iraqis resent. The U.S. embassy occupies one of Saddam&apos;s palaces. Not only is the symbolism counterproductive, but the continued American presence in the palace is a reminder of the insincerity of American pledges. Coalition Provisional Authority administrator L. Paul Bremer had promised the governing council that the U.S. government would not retain the palace after the transfer of sovereignty.

Iraqis increasingly associate the Green Zone with corruption. U.S.-appointed Prime Minister Ayad Allawi appropriated the house of Saddam&apos;s Vice President, Taha Yasin Ramadan. Despite the fact that his mandate was always less than a year, Allawi gave himself and his cabinet officials 25-year leases over their temporary Green Zone houses. Former President Ghazi al-Yawar, though now vice president, still occupies the presidential palace. Newly elected President Jalal Talabani lives in the same compound he has possessed for the last two years and, as Iraqis note with favor, outside the Green Zone.

The greatest insult to sovereignty relates to the convention center in which the national assembly now convenes. The U.S. military, which seized the building as Baghdad fell, has not donated, but rather rented the facilities to the Iraqi government. Some Iraqi officials have complained that American diplomats walk in and out of the building, and on occasion the meeting rooms, when the assembly is in session. The national assembly must share its facilities with more than two dozen American agencies and offices.

After the Iraqis voted to switch buildings, American diplomats intervened. They interceded with several Iraqi politicians, mostly high-level officials from Allawi&apos;s ousted government, to resist the move. Respect for democracy requires that the U.S. embassy respect national-assembly votes, all the more so when unanimous. The embassy operates for its own purposes, though. To move outside the Green Zone would be inconvenient for the Americans. U.S. diplomats like to cover the national assembly&apos;s proceedings, but State Department security regulations will not allow diplomats outside of the fortified zone without three days&apos; notice. Furthermore, U.S. political officers may not be outside the security zone after dark. Iraqi sovereignty is simply inconvenient for the foreign-service lifestyle.

The issues facing Iraq are vast. Iraqis debate the role of religion in their society. Kurds, Turkmen, and Arabs debate the future of Kirkuk. Discussions relating to a Basra-centered southern Iraqi federal unit are picking up. An increasingly mature and independent Iraqi press is at the forefront of investigating corruption. The arguments Iraqis have are long and sometimes heated. But, as the January 30 turnout showed, Iraqis take great pride in their sovereignty. The White House does too. Unfortunately, no one has yet told the American embassy.

House Again Passes Irresponsible Estate Tax Repeal


 http://www.ombwatch.org/article/articleview/2790/1/337 

For the third time in four years the House of Representatives passed a bill last week to permanently repeal the estate tax. The irresponsible and dangerous bill (H.R. 8) will cost $290 billion over the next 10 years but hidden within it are astronomically higher costs after the first decade.

MARYLAND TO WAL-MART:

PAY YOUR WAY--The Maryland General Assembly approved legislation requiring companies with more than 10,000 employees to spend at least 8 percent of their payroll on health care coverage or put the money into a fund to benefit the state Medicaid program for low-income families. Although other Maryland employers have more than 10,000 employees, Wal-Mart is the only one that does not spend 8 percent of its payroll on health care. Recent studies in 13 states show Wal-Mart ranks at or near the very top of the list of employers shifting to the public the cost of providing health care for their workers.

&quot;WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE IS TRUE EVEN THOUGH YOU CANNOT PROVE IT?&quot; - JANNA LEVIN

Great minds can sometimes guess the truth before they have either the evidence or arguments for it (Diderot called it having the &quot;esprit de divination&quot;). What do you believe is true even though you cannot prove it

 http://www.edge.org/q2005/q05_print.html 

 JANNA LEVIN 
Physicist, Columbia University; Author, How The Universe Got Its Spots

I believe there is an external reality and you are not all figments of my imagination. My friend asks me through the steam he blows off the surface of his coffee, how I can trust the laws of physics back to the origins of the universe. I ask him how he can trust the laws of physics down to his cup of coffee. He shows every confidence that the scalding liquid will not spontaneously defy gravity and fly up in his eyes. He lives with this confidence born of his empirical experience of the world. His experiments with gravity, heat, and light began in childhood when he palpated the world to test its materials. Now he has a refined and well-developed theory of physics, whether expressed in equations or not.

I simultaneously believe more and less than he does. It is rational to believe what all of my empirical and logical tests of the world confirm—that there is a reality that exists independent of me. That the coffee will not fly upwards. But it is a belief nonetheless. Once I&apos;ve gone that far, why stop at the perimeter of mundane experience? Just as we can test the temperature of a hot beverage with a tongue, or a thermometer, we can test the temperature of the primordial light left over from the big bang. One is no less real than the other simply because it is remarkable.

But how do I really know? If I measure the temperature of boiling water, all I really know is that mercury climbs a glass tube. Not even that, all I really know is that I see mercury climb a glass tube. But maybe the image in my mind&apos;s eye isn&apos;t real. Maybe nothing is real, not the mercury, not the glass, not the coffee, not my friend. They are all products of a florid imagination. There is no external reality, just me. Einstein? My creation. Picasso? My mind&apos;s forgery. But this solopsism is ugly and arrogant. How can I know that mathematics and the laws of physics can be reasoned down to the moment of creation of time, space, the entire universe? In the very same way that my friend believes in the reality of the second double cappuccino he orders. In formulating our beliefs, we are honest and critical and able to admit when we are wrong—and these are the cornerstones of truth.

When I leave the café, I believe the room of couches and tables is still on the block at 122nd Street, that it is still full of people, and that they haven&apos;t evaporated when my attention drifts away. But if I am wrong and there is no external reality, then not only is this essay my invention, but so is the web, edge.org, all of its participants and their ingenious ideas. And if you are reading this, I have created you too. But if I am wrong and there is no external reality, then maybe it is me who is a figment of your imagination and the cosmos outside your door is your magnificent creation.

INTELLIGENT PLASTICS

Engineers have created the first light deformable plastics. These programmed materials change shape when struck by light at certain wavelengths and return to their original shapes when exposed to light of specific different wavelengths. Potential applications exist in a variety of fields, including minimally invasive surgery.

Photosensitive groups are grafted onto a permanent polymer network to create molecular switches. The resulting photosensitive polymer film is then stretched with an external stress and illuminated with ultraviolet light of a certain wavelength. This prompts the molecular switches to bind one to another, or crosslink.

When the light is switched off and the external stress released, the crosslinks remain, maintaining an elongated structure. Exposure to light of another wavelength cleaves the new bonds, allowing the
material to spring back to its original shape. In addition to elongated films, a variety of other temporary shapes can be produced.

Borowitz Report - posse shocker

DeLAY&apos;S POSSE, HO&apos;S VOICE SUPPORT
500-Strong Entourage March On Capitol

Five hundred supporters who identified themselves as &quot;the posse and ho&apos;s&quot; of Rep. Tom DeLay (R-Texas) marched on Washington today to voice their support for the embattled House Majority Leader.

The bling-bedecked entourage, who claim they have traveled with Rep. DeLay on all of the overseas trips that are at the core of the Texas congressman&apos;s current ethical woes, marched on the Capitol to send the message that they were standing by their leader in spite of the controversy.

At a time when Rep. DeLay appears to be receiving flagging support from key players in the administration, especially President George W. Bush, such a strong vote of confidence from the bloated entourage known as &quot;The D-Unit&quot; could be crucial in turning the tide in the congressman&apos;s favor.

Issuing a challenge to Mr. DeLay&apos;s foes in the congress and the media, a prominent member of the D-Unit who identified himself only as &quot;Xpensez&quot; warned the congressman&apos;s critics to call off their ethics probes or &quot;I&apos;ll have yo ass seein&apos; out one eye.&quot;

The demonstration reached an emotional highpoint with the arrival of Rep. DeLay himself, who came cruising up to the Capitol in a fully loaded Rip Tide Blue 2005 Cadillac Escalade.

&quot;A man should not be judged by the enemies he has,&quot; a defiant Rep. DeLay told his adoring followers. &quot;A man should be judged by the posse and ho&apos;s he keeps, and my posse and ho&apos;s are second to none.&quot;

Elsewhere, seismologists who have been monitoring the Mt. St. Helens volcano for the last six months changed locations today, repositioning themselves near New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner.

Democracy perverted, justice denied: The unholy march toward theocracy

By Mel Seesholtz, Ph.D.
Online Journal Contributing Writer

April 18, 2005—On April 5, Kansas became the eighteenth state to amend its constitution to deny gay citizens their civil right to a civil marriage.

The evangelical Christian Right chirped with glee and bravado: a 70 percent vote in favor of discrimination, 550,000 voters expressed their bigotry. What the evangelical Christian Right neglected to say was that, according to October 2004 official figures, there were 1,687,896 registered voters in the Bible Belt state of Kansas. In other words, less than one-third of eligible voters (32.6 percent) were able to legislate discrimination in the Sunflower State.

The evangelical Christian Right has built a powerful &quot;grassroots&quot; political organization skilled in using fear tactics—&quot;Gays and lesbians will destroy this country with their lifestyle. Don&apos;t let this world be ruled by gays.&quot;—and faith-based fanaticismto bring out the vote. They can, in a very real sense, &quot;control&quot; elections. In her April 11 storyfor the Christian news service, AgapePress, Allie Martin acknowledged that &quot;the grassroots effort to pass the [Kansas] amendment was spearheaded by the Christian activist group One Voice of Kansas.&quot;

Despite the Republican politicians already in their pocket and the fact that, according to an April 14 article, Conservatives near lock on US courts, in The Christian Science Monitor, &quot;Republican appointees now constitute a majority of judges on 10 of the nation&apos;s 13 federal appeals courts. As few as three more lifetime appointments on key courts would tip the balance in favor of GOP appointees on all but one appeals court—the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco&quot;—the evangelical Christian Right seems to be using their &quot;traditional values&quot; of lies, scare tactics and hate-mongering to rally the flock. [See &quot;Lying and Hate Are Not &apos;Traditional Values&apos; (except for the evangelical Christian Right).&quot;]

Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist provides a stellar example of those faith-based, politically motivated &quot;traditional values.&quot;

According to an April 15, storyin The New York Times, Frist will &quot;join a handful of prominent Christian conservatives in a telecast portraying Democrats as &apos;against people of faith&apos; for blocking President Bush&apos;s [judicial] nominees.&quot; The April 24 event is being called &quot;Justice Sunday&quot; and comes replete with flyers depicting &quot;a young man holding a Bible in one hand and a gavel in the other.&quot; Under the heading &quot;the filibuster against people of faith,&quot; the flyer reads: &quot;The filibuster was once abused to protect racial bias, and it is now being used against people of faith.&quot;

No, senator, it&apos;s being used to prevent demagogues from transforming the last independent branch of government into another weapon for the evangelical Christian Right to use in its unholy war to make America a theocracy.

Such lies, distortions and deception are extraordinary, even for a faith-based politician like Frist. Does their use indicate that the leaders of the evangelical Christian Right and their political minions are running scared, knowing that an independent judiciary would thwart their theocratic plans? Or are they just drunk with power?

Both, probably. And that makes them all the more dangerous. It also helps account for their audacious assaulton the judiciary. The evangelical Christian Right already has the White House. Politicians indebted to and using them—the symbiosis is indeed deadly—dominate both houses of Congress. The only branch of government still not under their control is the judiciary. It&apos;s also the only independent branch of government that could thwart their plans to theocratize America. Hence the fanatical campaigns to remake the judiciary &quot;in their own image&quot; and by any means necessary.

On March 29, Rev. Louis Sheldon and his Traditional Values Coalition launched a $10 million campaignagainst &quot;the anti-God Left&quot; who, they claim, have &quot;been using America&apos;s courts to impose an anti-religion, anti-family agenda on America.&quot;

On April 4, James Dobson and his Focus on the Family (FOF) launched their own campaign against the judiciary. FOF is also selling a CD by Phyllis Schlafly on &quot;stopping judicial tyranny.&quot; But those were only the opening salvos.

On April 7 and 8, a conference was held in Washington, D.C. Its title was &quot;Confronting the Judicial War on Faith.&quot; According to a Los Angeles Times story, &quot;Its sponsor was the Traditional Values Coalition, social-issue reactionaries who back legislation to restrict federal courts from ruling on anything involving God . . . Its so-called Constitution Restoration Act is sponsored in Congress by Senators. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), Zell Miller (D-Ga.), Sam Brownback (R-Kan.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), and Reps. Robert B. Aderholt (R-Ala.) and Mike Pence (R-Ind.).&quot;

The Constitution Restoration Act would establish the legal basis for an American theocracy:

Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Supreme Court shall not have jurisdiction to review, by appeal, writ of certiorari, or otherwise, any matter to the extent that relief is sought against an element of Federal, State, or local government, or against an officer of Federal, State, or local government (whether or not acting in official personal capacity), by reason of that element&apos;s or officer&apos;s acknowledgement of God as the sovereign source of law, liberty, or government.

Another major player in the war on an independent judiciary sponsored a major session at the conference. RightMarch.com was formed in March of 2003. The name says it all: &quot;march&quot; (or goose-step) to the fringe of the religious and political &quot;right.&quot; RightMarch.com identifies itself as &quot;the &apos;Rapid Response Force&apos; against the ongoing liberal onslaught.&quot; A downloadable poster for the session they sponsored at the conference is on their web site. It&apos;s as inflammatory and as misleading as one would expect. After all, the first victim in any war is &quot;truth.&quot;

The poster proclaims:

Activist Judges are:
UNDERMINING Democracy,
DEVASTATING families, and
ASSAULTING Judeo-Christian Morality.

and lists the speakers: &quot;Tom DeLay, Sam Brownback, Chief Justice Roy Moore, former Vatican Ambassador Ray Flynn, Alan Keyes, Phyllis Schlafly, Tony Perkins, Mike Farris, Howard Phillips, Bill Dannemeyer, Morton Blackwell, Bill Federer, Rick Scarborough, Don Feder, Kay Daly, Janet Folger, William Greene, Jan LaRue, Tim Lee and Patrick Reilly.&quot; A veritable Who?s Who in the campaign to make the United States a hate-based theocracy.

As for the three claims of what those &quot;activist judges&quot; are doing . . .

1. &quot;Undermining democracy.&quot; A true democracy can exist only if there are checks and balances to assure that one fanatical &quot;grassroots&quot; group doesn&apos;t take over all branches of government. That&apos;s the rationale for a &quot;separation of powers&quot;: a means to assure that current political (and religious) voting trends don&apos;t compromise the equal civil rights of all citizens. In that sense, the political tactics of the evangelical Christian Right are historically familiar. Passing &quot;grassroots&quot; laws that abolished the separation of powers and damning certain groups of citizens were also the tactics Chancellor Hitler used to consolidate his regime&apos;s power and legitimate its ideology.

History gives us a kind of chart, and we dare not surrender even a small rushlight in the darkness. The hasty reformer who does not remember the past will find himself condemned to repeat it. —John Buchan

Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. . . . This is the condition of children and barbarians, in whom instinct has learned nothing from experience. —George Santayana

2. &quot;Devastating families.&quot; Yes. The evangelical Christian Right&apos;s jihad has devastated families, especially those including the 8 to 10 million children being reared in same-sex households and those whose personal, private decisions have been invaded and made fodder for political campaigns. The name &quot;Terri Schiavo&quot; comes immediately to mind. The name &quot;Tom DeLay&quot; also comes to mind as he continues to use the Schiavo tragedy to further his and the evangelical Christian Right&apos;s campaign against an independent judiciary. As The New York Times reported on April 14, Tom DeLay has &quot;stepped up his crusade against judges, announcing that he had instructed the Judiciary Committee to investigate federal court decisions in the Terri Schiavo case and to recommend possible legislation.&quot; Another reportacknowledged the wider scope of DeLay&apos;s call for investigation and action against offending jurists: &quot;He specifically called for the committee to probe rulings that were favorable to same-sex marriage and decisions in the Terri Schiavo [case]&quot;

3. &quot;Assaulting Judeo-Christian Morality.&quot; A most confusing accusation. Judeo-Christian morality is what it is. Those who wish to subscribe are free to do so. What they are not—and should not be—free to do is transforms the courts into a faith-based judicial system. That&apos;s functional theocracy, not effective democracy.

The conference was called &quot;Confronting the Judicial War on Faith.&quot; There is no &quot;war on faith.&quot; (But it does underwrite the strategy of making the victimizer the victim that the Catholic Church used so well at the height of its pedophile sex scandal.) So-called &quot;people of faith&quot; can have their faith. That&apos;s a private matter. The public, political &quot;war&quot; is to force the beliefs of the most fanatical &quot;people of faith&quot; onto everyone by embedding them in the laws and packing the courts of a secular nation that once claimed to stand for &quot;liberty and justice for all.&quot; That traditional American value is not tenable in a theocracy. And that&apos;s the point . . .

When the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts—that state where the American revolution began—issued its landmark decision, the evangelical Christian Right went bananas.

Unless the people of the State of Massachusetts rise up with one voice in opposition to this lawless and socially destructive behavior, it will destroy society as we know it.—Steve Crampton, Chief Counsel, Center for Law and Policy, American Family Association, December 2003

The fact that the sky didn?t fall and that &quot;traditional marriage&quot; in Massachusetts continues totally unaffected by same-sex marriage sticks in the craw of the evangelical Christian Right. And for good reason. It negates their propaganda and their arguments. That&apos;s also why James Dobson tried so hard to influence Canadians through his radio and TV broadcasts, as well as his &quot;grassroots&quot; efforts to have Americans lobby Canadian legislators. With conclusive evidence from our Canadian neighbor that same-sex marriage does not destroy (or even affect) &quot;traditional marriage,&quot; &quot;the family,&quot; or anything else the evangelical Christian Right claims to be trying to protect, their arguments against marriage equality fall flat, and the so-called &quot;leaders&quot; of the evangelical Christian Right are exposed as the lying, hypocritical, hate-mongering bigots they are.

Same-sex marriage has been legal for more than a year in Massachusetts. None—that&apos;s none, as in not one—of the calamitous catastrophes predicted by the evangelical Christian Right has materialized. That is, no doubt, why they have renewed the campaigns to remove the justices of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court who upheld the constitutional guarantee of equality for all citizens. Such decisions are theocratically unacceptable. From the Christian &quot;news&quot; service, WorldNetDaily, story:

A measure to oust the four justices who voted for same-sex marriage in Massachusetts will be considered today [April 12, 2005] by the state legislature&apos;s Joint Judiciary Committee.

As WorldNetDaily reported, the Massachusetts-based group Article 8 Alliance is promoting a &quot;bill of address,&quot; a Massachusetts provision allowing lawmakers to remove judges who fail to fulfill their duties.

Apparently upholding state (and federal) constitutional guarantees of equality for all citizens is not among the duties of supreme courts, according to the evangelical Christian Right. They, the voters and the politicians they control want real &quot;activist judges,&quot; as Cynthia Tucker defined them: &quot;&apos;activist judge&apos;—a jurist who ignores the law and rules according to the passions of a group of partisans.&quot;

A &quot;Christian Underground&quot; articleon April 14, made that very clear. Following a meeting of so-called &quot;Christian&quot; leaders in New York, Bishop Harry Jackson, chairman of the High Impact Leadership Coalition, issued this threat: &quot;We came together in New York City to send a strong message to elected officials and candidates for public office in New York and across America: vote against gay marriage, abortion and for other moral value issues or evangelical Christians throughout the U.S. will continue to vote you out of office.&quot; One can almost hear the words of fanatical homophobe Randall Terry echoing in the background: &quot;I want you to just let a wave of intolerance wash over you. I want you to let a wave of hatred wash over you. Yes, hate is good . . . Our goal is a Christian nation. We have a Biblical duty. We are called by God to conquer this country.&quot;

A new attack strategy in the unholy war against jurists who base their decisions on the law instead of extremists&apos; agendas appeared in Joseph Farah&apos;s April 13, 2005 WorldNet Daily (WND) article, &quot;Courts threatening national security.&quot;

WorldNet Daily bills itself as &quot;A Free Press for a Free People.&quot; Joseph Farah is founder, editor and chief executive officer of WND. But neither WND or Farah advocates a &quot;free people&quot; or a &quot;free press,&quot; as Terry Krepel noted in a September 8, 2003, article, &quot;Exhibit 24: Joseph Farah, Crusher of Dissent.&quot; Krepel began by asking &quot;How can Joseph Farah top himself after advocating the murder of adulterers?&quot; The answer attests to the goals, attitude and rhetoric of the evangelical Christian Right:

Set off by an article in which [actor] Johnny Depp allegedly called the United States a &quot;dumb puppy that has big teeth&quot; . . . Farah&apos;s reasoned reaction to Depp [was] &quot;I say we should make certain this scumbucket never works in America again. . . . It&apos;s time to silence these people. It&apos;s time to force them to get real jobs and perform real work and learn the unusual and undeserved blessings America has bestowed upon them.&quot; Like the First Amendment right of free speech, perhaps?

Krepel was right. What Farah and WND are really interested in is damning, demonizing and &quot;the complete muzzling of views&quot; they disagree with. Muzzling the courts is the overt intention of the Constitution Restoration ActConstitution Restoration Act.

The Heritage Foundation is a conservative think tank. In one of its recent lectures—number 871, delivered on February 17 and published on April 11, and available as a pdf download on their website—a similar theme was struck: &quot;There were, and are, scholars and statesmen who believe that courts should not be granted the power to invalidate legislation in the name of the Constitution.&quot;

Recall the words of The Constitution Restoration Act:

Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Supreme Court shall not have jurisdiction to review, by appeal, writ of certiorari, or otherwise, any matter to the extent that relief is sought against an element of Federal, State, or local government, or against an officer of Federal, State, or local government (whether or not acting in official personal capacity), by reason of that element&apos;s or officer&apos;s acknowledgement of God as the sovereign source of law, liberty, or government.

&quot;Acknowledgement of God as the sovereign source of law, liberty, or government&quot;: Theocracy 101.

And, of course, &quot;God&quot; and His wishes will be defined by Louis Sheldon and James Dobson, George W. Bush and Tom DeLay.

The Constitution Restoration Act and similar pending legislation have the full backing of that evangelical paragon of ethics, House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, who threatened political retribution against judges that do not conform to theocratic ideology. Suffice to say, fanatical Louis Sheldon saidof fanatical Tom DeLay, &quot;I consider Tom DeLay to be one of the most important Members of Congress. . . . He is committed to biblical morality and is a strong ally in the battle to save our nation from the failed ideas of liberals, judicial tyrants, and moral anarchists.&quot; Apparently Sheldon&apos;s and DeLay&apos;s version of &quot;biblical morality&quot; does not include ethics or honesty, but it does encourage sinful slander and disgraceful name-calling.

On March 3, WND featured an articleby Farah, entitled &quot;Oh, Canada!&quot; His main gripe was that &quot;Prime Minister Paul Martin, a weak-minded, weak-kneed politician who vacillates with the slightest breeze of controversy, announced Canada would not join the U.S. missile defense program,&quot; another boondoggle on the evangelical &quot;Christian&quot; Right&apos;s bellicose faith-based agenda. Farah concluded his diatribe in the same gutter in which it began:

Canada is fortunate I am not in charge in Washington. My response to [Prime Minister Paul] Martin&apos;s limp-wristed demand would be: &quot;Fine, we&apos;ll let you know about those incoming missiles. But since we, too, live in a sovereign nation governed by a free people encompassing many diverse cultures and viewpoints, we&apos;ll set up a blue-ribbon, bipartisan committee to evaluate your &apos;requests&apos; to shoot down those incoming missiles. Be sure to provide 24-hours notice of such requests.&quot;

How typical Farah would use the &quot;limp-wristed&quot; homophobic slur. How typical Farah would pervert the phrase &quot;a free people encompassing many diverse cultures,&quot; when it is the expressed goal of the evangelical Christian Right, their political minions and their media outlets to entomb all Americans in a theocratic, homogeneous culture in which &quot;justice&quot; could be rained down like fire and brimstone on &quot;homos,&quot; non-Christians, non-Republicans and other &quot;undesirables&quot; . . . as they become identified.

And make no mistake about it. An unending supply of fresh &quot;undesirables&quot; will be needed to maintain the theocracy.

Same-sex marriage opponent makes specious argument

Tuesday, April 19, 2005

By ANDREW KOHLER
GUEST COLUMNIST

The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) is the most common appellation for the laws that proscribe same-sex marriage, yet there is no empirical evidence that these laws even affect heterosexual unions. They do nothing to address the real financial and emotional strains on marriage, leading Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., to call the federal DOMA a &quot;legislative placebo&quot; when it passed in 1996.

In an April 12 guest column, Jeff Kemp asserts: &quot; ... Same-sex marriage will further reduce the meaning of marriage. Scandinavia&apos;s experiment resulted in a big drop in heterosexual marriage and more out-of-wedlock births.&quot; A closer look at the situation in Scandinavia, however, reveals that same-sex marriage did not precede any decline in heterosexual marriage. Even Stanley Kurtz of the Hoover Institution, who has relied on Scandinavia to justify his opposition to same-sex marriage, concedes this point.

The House Judiciary Committee&apos;s Constitution Subcommittee has found Kurtz&apos;s research &quot;entirely without intellectual merit.&quot; For instance, Kurtz cites England as an example of cultural decline despite its lack of same-sex marriage. Otherwise, his work lacks any comparison of European countries with and without same-sex marriage to see if they have experienced declines similar to Scandinavia&apos;s and outright admits that diverse factors contribute to such decline.

Kemp expresses concern about the impact same-sex marriage has on children. This overlooks the as many as 1 million children being raised by same-sex parents. During last year&apos;s congressional debates on a constitutional amendment barring same-sex marriage, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., wisely said: &quot; ... This amendment is aimed at ... preventing any state from bringing some stability to the lives of those children by allowing (the) lesbian or gay couples ... who are raising those children to be able to get married.&quot;

Children&apos;s Rights, National Center for Youth Law and various adoption agencies have filed a friend of the court brief advocating same-sex marriage in the case before the Washington Supreme Court. The American Psychological Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Child Welfare League of America and many other groups concur with their findings.

When Kemp writes that this debate should not focus on &quot;adult validation and acceptance,&quot; he dismisses how devastating prejudice is to every group that faces it. Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., says of DOMA: &quot;Society communicates particular values and attitudes to its members ... primarily through laws ... this body is pushing legislation that will reinforce intolerance and hostility toward gay people.&quot; Worst of all, codifying this animus harms and betrays vulnerable young people who are coming to terms with their sexual identities.

The American Psychological Association has stated that science has held for some time that homosexuality is not only natural but an innate characteristic. Thus, any claim that same-sex marriage will affect heterosexual relationships is specious.

Civil unions became legal in Vermont around five years ago, and 11 months ago same-sex marriage finally came to Massachusetts. The divorce rate in Massachusetts remains among the lowest in the nation, and neither state has experienced the negative effects predicted by Kemp and Kurtz. Openly gay Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., notes that social change is always met with fear and apocalyptic warnings, and it is high time we learn the lesson that these fears are unwarranted.

Full inclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals is a step toward a society of acceptance. Civil rights hero John Lewis, now serving in Congress, said it best in his speech against DOMA: &quot;We are now moving toward the 21st century. Let us come together and create one nation, one people, one family, one house, the American house, the American family, the American nation.&quot;

Joint Functional Component Command for Network Warfare (JFCCNW)

&quot;The U.S. military has assembled the world&apos;s most formidable hacker posse: a super-secret, multimillion-dollar weapons program that may be ready to launch bloodless cyberwar against enemy networks -- from electric grids to telephone nets. The group&apos;s existence was revealed during a U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee hearing last month. Military leaders from U.S. Strategic Command, or Stratcom, disclosed the existence of a unit called the Joint Functional Component Command for Network Warfare, or JFCCNW. In simple terms and sans any military parlance, the unit could best be described as the world&apos;s most formidable hacker posse. Ever.&quot;

PRO-PRIVATIZATION CEOS PAY LITTLE--

The CEOs of Wall Street firms that support privatizing Social Security pay into the system for only a few days a year because Social Security taxes are not paid on income above $87,900, a study by United for a Fair Economy and the Institute for America&apos;s Future shows. The CEOs of seven financial firms financing pro-privatization campaigns had incomes so high they exceeded the Social Security earnings cap in eight hours or less, according to &quot;Taxpayers for a Day: The Most to Gain, the Least to Lose.&quot; The Bush administration&apos;s privatization scheme would cut recipients&apos; guaranteed benefits by as much $152,000 after a lifetime of work while rewarding Wall Street financial firms with some $940 billion in private account management fees over the next 75 years, according to University of Chicago economist Austan Goolsbee.

Kaiser Health Poll Report - Views on the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit / Seniors Slow to Embrace New Medicare Drug Benefit

 Kaiser Health Poll Report - Views on the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit 

The latest Kaiser Family Foundation health poll report includes new public opinion data on two issues related to prescription drugs now being debated nationally. According to the latest polling, more than three out of four adults in the U.S. (77%) say that Congress should allow patients to buy prescription
drugs imported from Canada, and the same majority (77%) say that Congress should change the law to allow the federal government to negotiate with drug companies to reduce drug prices for people on Medicare.

In each case, nearly eight in 10 people (79%) say the change would have a lot or some impact in reducing prescription drug costs in the United States. Majorities also disagree with common arguments against such policies, including that they would lead U.S. drug companies to do less research and development.

The results, based on polling conducted March 31 through April 3, are included in &quot;The Public on Prescription Drugs for Seniors,&quot; the featured topic of the March/April Kaiser Health Poll Report. The featured topic uses the new Kaiser polling data, as well as earlier surveys by Kaiser and other organizations, to explore the public’s views on the new Medicare prescription drug benefit.

The poll also finds a decline in the share of seniors with unfavorable views towards the new Medicare drug benefit from 55% in February 2004 to 34% in April 2005. But the percentage of seniors viewing the new benefit favorably remains largely unchanged -- 21% now, compared to 17% last February. A growing proportion of seniors is either neutral toward the new benefit (25%) or did not know enough to offer an opinion (20%).

This month’s featured topic also covers seniors’ reported understanding of the new Medicare prescription drug benefit and their sources of information about it.

The full featured topic report is available at

 http://www.kff.org/healthpollreport/apr_2005/index.cfm .

 Seniors Slow to Embrace New Medicare Drug Benefit 

Seniors are not exactly warming up to the new Medicare drug benefit scheduled to take effect
Jan. 1, a new Kaiser Family Foundation health poll shows.

As of this month, only 9 percent of the seniors polled plan to sign up for the optional drug coverage, while 37 percent say they will not do so. The rest either haven’t heard enough to decide (47 percent) or simply don&apos;t know (7 percent).

In February 2004, 55 percent of all seniors had an unfavorable impression of the new law. This month, more seniors still have an unfavorable impression (34 percent) than a favorable one (21 percent), but a growing number (25 percent) are neutral or don&amp;&apos;t know enough (20 percent) to offer an opinion, Kaiser reported today.

Overall, 57 percent of seniors expect the new benefit will be at least somewhat helpful for people on Medicare, and 71 percent expect it to aid those with no other drug coverage. But only 37 percent of seniors expect the new benefit to help them personally, while 44 percent say it will not do so.

&quot;WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE IS TRUE EVEN THOUGH YOU CANNOT PROVE IT?&quot; - ALISON GOPNIK

Great minds can sometimes guess the truth before they have either the evidence or arguments for it (Diderot called it having the &quot;esprit de divination&quot;). What do you believe is true even though you cannot prove it

 http://www.edge.org/q2005/q05_print.html 

 ALISON GOPNIK 
Psychologist, UC-Berkeley; Coauthor, The Scientist In the Crib

I believe, but cannot prove, that babies and young children are actually more conscious, more vividly aware of their external world and internal life, than adults are. I believe this because there is strong evidence for a functional trade-off with development. Young children are much better than adults at learning new things and flexibly changing what they think about the world. On the other hand, they are much worse at using their knowledge to act in a swift, efficient and automatic way. They can learn three languages at once but they can&apos;t tie their shoelaces.

This trade-off makes sense from an evolutionary perspective. Our species relies more on learning than any other, and has a longer childhood than any other. Human childhood is a protected period in which we are free to learn without being forced to act. There is even some neurological evidence for this. Young children actually have substantially more neural connections than adults—more potential to put different kinds of information together. With experience, some connections are strengthened and many others disappear entirely. As the neuroscientists say, we gain conductive efficiency but lose plasticity.

What does this have to do with consciousness? Consider the experiences we adults associate with these two kinds of functions. When we know how to do something really well and efficiently, we typically lose, or at least, reduce, our conscious awareness of that action. We literally don&apos;t see the familiar houses and streets on the well-worn route home, although, of course, in some functional sense we must be visually taking them in. In contrast, as adults when we are faced with the unfamiliar, when we fall in love with someone new, or when we travel to a new place, our consciousness of what is around us and inside us suddenly becomes far more vivid and intense. In fact, we are willing to expend lots of money, and lots of emotional energy, for those few intensely alive days in Paris or Beijing that we will remember long after months of everyday life have vanished.

Similarly, as adults when we need to learn something new, say when we learn to skydive, or work out a new scientific idea, or even deal with a new computer, we become vividly, even painfully, conscious of what we are doing—we need, as we say, to pay attention. As we become expert we need less and less attention, and we experience the actual movements and thoughts and keystrokes less and less. We sometimes say that adults are better at paying attention than children, but really we mean just the opposite. Adults are better at not paying attention. They&apos;re better at screening out everything else and restricting their consciousness to a single focus. Again there is a certain amount of brain evidence for this. Some brain areas, like the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, consistently light up for adults when they are deeply engaged in learning something new. But for more everyday tasks, these areas light up much less. For children, though the pattern is different—these areas light up even for mundane tasks.

I think that, for babies, every day is first love in Paris. Every wobbly step is skydiving, every game of hide and seek is Einstein in 1905.

The astute reader will note that this is just the opposite of what Dan Dennett believes but cannot prove. And this brings me to a second thing I believe but cannot prove. I believe that the problem of capital-C Consciousness will disappear in psychology just as the problem of Life disappeared in biology. Instead we&apos;ll develop much more complex, fine-grained and theoretically driven accounts of the connections between particular types of phenomenological experience and particular functional and neurological phenomena. The vividness and intensity of our attentive awareness, for example, may be completely divorced from our experience of a constant first-person I. Babies may be more conscious in one way and less in the other. The consciousness of pain may be entirely different from the consciousness of red which may be entirely different from the babbling stream of Joyce and Woolf.

Bullet trains with faulty speed controls

Mainichi Shimbun, Japan, 23 Mar 2005

Series 300 bullet trains have been running for years with faulty speed control equipment, Central Japan Railway Co. (JR Tokai) officials said.

Automatic Train Control (ATC) devices that prevent Shinkansen trains from exceeding certain speeds have been faulty on the Series 300 trains, with 52 malfunctions reported this year alone.

In one case, a train traveled at 280 kilometers per hour between Shin-Yokohama and Odawara stations in Kanagawa Prefecture on March 3, even though the speed limit on the line is 270 kilometers per hour.

JR Tokai says the error came from faulty software supplied by the makers of the devices and that the glitch was not even detected during test runs.

Land, Infrastructure and Transport Ministry officials have asked JR Tokai to provide a complete explanation of the case.

JR Tokai said one of the cases involved a Series 300 bullet train driver being forced to reduce speed manually after the ATC on the train he was driving on March 19 failed to work.

A check of the ATC later revealed that software supposed to detect train speeds was not working properly. This caused the ATC to estimate the train was traveling slower than it actually was.

JR Tokai has stopped using the faulty equipment.

How People Re-find Information When the Web Changes

This paper investigates how people return to information in a dynamic information environment. For example, a person might want to return to Web content via a link encountered earlier on a Web page, only to learn that the link has since been removed. Changes can benefit users by providing new information, but they hinder returning to previously viewed information. The observational study presented here analyzed instances, collected via a Web search, where people expressed difficulty re-finding information because of changes to the information or its environment. A number of interesting observations arose from this analysis, including that the path originally taken to get to the information target appeared important in its re-retrieval, whereas, surprisingly, the temporal aspects of when the information was seen before were not. While people expressed frustration when problems arose, an explanation of why the change had occurred was often sufficient to allay that frustration, even in the absence of a solution. The implications of these observations for systems that support re-finding in dynamic environments are discussed.

Borowitz Report - papal conclave shocker

CARDINALS DEADLOCKED OVER LUNCH ORDER
&apos;That Thai Place&apos; Ruled Out

The papal conclave hit a speed bump in its very first day as cardinals convening in Vatican City became deadlocked over which restaurant to order takeout from, sources said.

While the deliberations behind the walls of the Sistine Chapel are traditionally shrouded in secrecy, when the clock struck at 2 PM and no food had yet arrived, rumors circulated that the cardinals were bitterly split over where to order their lunch.

According to one insider, approximately half the cardinals in attendance were in favor of some form of Chinese takeout, while the other half favored a more unconventional choice, a tapas restaurant that recently opened in the neighborhood and that several prominent cardinals reportedly said &quot;looked interesting.&quot;

Those familiar with the often heated discussions over the lunch order said that the dean of the College of Cardinals, Joseph Ratzinger, 78, tried to rein in the number of choices right off the bat by ruling out a restaurant he referred to only as &quot;that Thai place.&quot;

Complicating the debate, one source said, was the fact that so many local eateries have been slipping their takeout menus under the Vatican&apos;s front door, defying a clearly posted sign warning against such a practice.

&quot;There is some hope that sushi will emerge as a consensus choice, but that remains to be seen,&quot; the source said, &quot;Compared to this, choosing a pope is going to be a snap.&quot;

Elsewhere, House Majority Leader Tom DeLay said that he is so confident he will win his ethics fight that he just doubled his family&apos;s salary.

Critics Charge that New Food Pyramid is in Bad Taste

The Swift Report - http://swiftreport.blogs.com/news/ 

The Bush Administration has relied on sophisticated PR tools to promote everything from Social Security reform to a kindler, gentler image overseas. In what could be its most ambitious iniative to date, the administration has teamed up with a top PR company to change the way Americans eat. Later this month, the Agriculture department will unveil a new icon to help Americans make healthy food choices. But despite its new look, the food pyramid now features plenty of familiar corporate logos.

April Fools?

Wheels

By Ed Wallace

Special to the Star-Telegram

&quot;How in the world can the government sell us on ownership of our own retirement savings when some of America’s best known corporations — still going concerns — can’t afford to keep promises to their employees for their retirement?&quot;

The first week of April could not have been a more stunning week for news in the automotive industry, but what’s truly surprising is how little of that news was widely reported by the media.

We did see lots of news about the 2005 energy study by Goldman Sachs, released on March 31st, which determined that oil could possibly “spike” as high as $105 a barrel during the course of this year. However, while that story had “legs” (as they say in the trades) to keep spawning articles from other oil analysts on why Goldman Sachs could possibly be right (or not), it was soon replaced by an even more astounding one. That was the announcement out of Detroit that General Motors had relieved both North American president Gary Cowger and vice chairman Bob Lutz of their official responsibilities for the success of GM’s sales in the United States and Canada, with CEO Rick Wagoner now accepting the sole responsibility for GM’s retail future. Right behind GM’s bombshell came another downgrade of GM’s credit rating by Moody’s Investment Service, with the cautionary kicker that the Ford Motor Company could be right behind GM.

Making matters worse for the American taxpayer was the Wall Street Journal article suggesting that the government’s Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation would soon divert our tax dollars to pay unfunded liabilities from the auto sector’s defined pension programs. Should that happen, automakers would join a list of 141 steel companies and 12 airlines that have foisted their problems onto the American taxpayer. Of course, my first reaction to this one was a question: How in the world can the government sell us on ownership of our own retirement savings when some of America’s best known corporations — still going concerns — can’t afford to keep promises to their employees for their retirement?

There was one semi-positive story that same day: Detroit agreed with the government of Canada to cut the global warming emissions produced by American-made automobiles by at least 6% within five years. This left automotive writers, legal experts and environmentalists wondering why the Big Three are still fighting the state of California so hard on this issue, when they’ve so willingly acquiesced to the demands of our neighbor to the north.

However, Detroit wasn’t the only automotive group suffering in the first week of the month. Anti-Japanese demonstrations were taking place in many cities in China because Japan’s government had certified another new history book — which allegedly whitewashes Japan’s militaristic past yet again. Over in Korea, the government said that they were enraged by this move, but economically speaking, Japan is more intricately involved in China than in Korea. And so on Wednesday, April 6th, Honda’s chief executive, Takeo Fukui, made it official when he stated that for the foreseeable future, in view of the recent events in China, executive travel between the two countries would be largely curtailed. The Japanese government took the unusual step of asking their Chinese counterparts to safeguard Japanese companies in their country.

A couple of days later, Houston’s Mayor Bill White said that he intended to convert half of the city’s fleet of automobiles over to hybrid electric models within five years. Already Houston owns 130 hybrids; Mayor White, quite happy with the black Toyota Prius in which he has been cruising around Houston for a year, acknowledged that officials have placed orders for another 76 of the Toyotas and seven of the Ford Escape hybrids. Obviously, Houston’s plan to purchase another 1,537 hybrid electric automobiles over the next four years isn’t good news for Detroit.

And that brings up yet another story, this time out of Los Angeles. The LA Times’ Pulitzer Prize-winning automotive journalist, Dan Neill, wrote a scathing article on General Motors and its management — made even more interesting as it was placed inside a review of the Pontiac G6. Within hours, General Motors had canceled an estimated $10 million worth of advertising in that paper. Maybe it was a gesture of defiance, or maybe the paper just wasn’t paying attention, but for days after GM canceled its ads in the LA Times, Mr. Neill’s article continued to occupy space on the front page of that paper’s website.

Then, to cap off the biggest week of automotive news in recent memory, talks between the British government with executives of MG Rover and Shanghai Automotive broke down. As a result, receivers were called in for a possible bankruptcy liquidation. With British elections just weeks away, this was the worst news that Tony Blair’s ruling party could possibly have gotten, as the Labour Party is using England’s economy as its primary campaign pitch to lure back disenchanted voters who weren’t keen on the idea of a war in Iraq. With MG Rover’s failure, up to ten thousand jobs at Rover and its suppliers could be permanently lost, which could throw the election to the Tories. There you have it: One week’s worth of news you might not have known took place. The threat of oil prices’ spinning out of control. A major shakeup at GM and the threat of a downgrade to junk bond status for the General. The possibility that taxpayers will be forced to take over the pensions at auto companies. Canada gets an agreement on global warming gases from Detroit, but California can’t. Anti-Japanese riots in China. Houston moving to hybrid electric cars. MG Rover fails. In addition, one thing we forgot to mention: The government said gas is going to go even higher by summer. This puts into question the economists’ claim for positive estimates on a new batch of hirings by American corporations, with the net result that forecasts for our nation’s gross domestic product were reduced.

Yet all during that week, it seemed that all we got from the networks were more stories on Michael Jackson’s trial, speculation about whether Brad Pitt is dating Angelina Jolie, the fact that Britney Spears is getting her own TV show — and, of course, the wedding of Charles and Camilla. The last story was made even more shocking when CNN preempted its news broadcasting to carry the wedding blessing live.

I know I’m more focused on our society’s economic circumstances and how they interweave with the automobile industry’s, but I think that the fact of England’s oldest and last independent car company failing is far more important than Charles’ finally getting around to marrying the woman he’s been seeing for 35 years. Then again, I could be wrong.

There were two other stories from the first week of April that have important implications for us all — again, buried behind the story on Brad Pitt’s new Malibu home. One such article was that the futures market for gasoline fell by 15 cents a gallon during the first seven days of the month, while during a six-day period the futures for light sweet crude fell each and every day. Those two circumstances led some market analysts to suggest that the bull market for oil is now over and moderation may well have returned to the oil speculation bubble. (This column is being written on April 12th; we’ll see how oil has reacted during the five days before it’s published.)

And then the Saudis announced that they would invest $4 – 5 billion to build a new refinery in Yanbu that can handle their Arabian sour crude, turning it into much needed gasoline, with the anticipation of shipping to both Asia and our East Coast. Just a few days earlier, the Saudis had offered to build another sour crude refinery in India for that country’s future energy needs. Both of these stories are of key importance to all of us, at least economically, because we have noticed that every single time oil has dropped to near $40 a barrel, car sales across the country explode.

So, while our government was announcing that gasoline was going even higher before the summer driving season, the futures market on gasoline was declining in a substantial way. Yet, no one was reconciling the government’s estimation of the market with the reality of what was truly happening. And few understand that if the Saudis go through with their pledge for a new export-oriented gasoline refinery that can handle the heavier crude, that by itself could deflate the futures market for light sweet crude that has been unnerving us. Because if there is a new outlet for the much cheaper crude, one would assume there would be a lesser demand for the other higher grades of oil — and therefore, their prices should fall.

Yes, in a week of turmoil in the automotive industry, there were two incredible stories on energy that could impact our economy in a very positive way. But the only way most would have heard about either story is if it had been introduced as evidence at Michael Jackson’s trial, commented on by Brad Pitt’s publicist or mentioned by Prince Charles in his wedding vows.

Global: Tilt!

Stephen Roach (New York)

An unbalanced global economy is at risk of becoming unhinged. Beset by record imbalances between current account deficits and surpluses, it doesn’t take much to derail a system that is already in serious disequilibrium. Such a possibility now seems less remote in the face of a confluence of powerful blows -- an energy shock, threats to European unity, an outbreak of overt hostility between China and Japan, and the rising tide of US-led protectionist sentiment. Meanwhile, steeped in denial, global policymakers are asleep at the switch. With an unbalanced world lacking the inherent resilience needed to overcome these mounting tensions, the global expansion is now at risk. That conclusion does not seem to be lost on stretched and still overvalued financial markets.

It’s always easy to get swept away by the emotions of the markets, and last week’s sell-off in global equity markets offers many temptations in that regard. The markets are understandably unnerved over the possibility of another growth disappointment. And, on the surface, the March data flow certainly supports these concerns. The softness was global in scope -- not just for the usual suspects like Europe and Japan but also for the two stalwarts in the global growth chain, the United States and China. The US labor market data were lousy (again) and the latest retail sales reports were especially disconcerting. Even in China, import demand has tailed off in the first three months of this year -- expanding at just a 12.2% y-o-y rate in 1Q05, literally one-third the 36% growth pace of 2004. Sure, this could be noise as well, but a softening of import demand is also a classic warning sign of a slowdown in Chinese domestic demand.

Of course, weak incoming data could be just an excuse for the markets’ latest spasm. There’s always a lot of noise in the numbers -- especially with this year’s early Easter. Meanwhile, the so-called energy shock seems to be vanishing before our eyes, with oil prices now threatening to pierce the $50 threshold on the downside just two weeks after it looked as if there would be no stopping the markets on the upside at $60. Sure, there is still a very compelling case as to why energy product prices will continue to rise -- especially gasoline, as many parts of the world now head into the peak seasonal driving season. But the oil price bet has become something of a crapshoot -- there are good grounds to take either side of the market at this point in time. By definition, energy shocks are two-way events -- providing both agony and ecstasy as mean reversion eventually follows most price surges. A reversal of the recent energy price spike could turn the current global slowdown into nothing more than another temporary soft patch. If that’s the case, equities should rebound and bonds sell off. Any such market reversal could be short lived, however, if political risks continue to mount. What’s particularly disconcerting, of course, about the recent equity market sell-off is that it has been concentrated in a period when oil prices have been falling -- not rising. That’s a hint there could be a deeper meaning to all this.

That deeper meaning, in my view, is tied to very worrisome signs of a potential failure in the global policy architecture. Around the world, politicians and policy makers have become a source of increased instability. For an already unbalanced global economy, that’s a very dangerous combination. The interplay between mounting global imbalances and rising political risks raises the odds of a more disruptive strain of rebalancing -- complete with a dollar crisis and a wrenching sell-off in both tocks and bonds.

Cracks in the policy architecture are opening up at a fast and furious pace. The risks associated with the French 29 May vote on the European constitution are a big deal. A rejection -- a little more than a 50-50 possibility at this point -- wouldn’t necessarily spell the end of the European Monetary Union (see Eric Chaney’s various missives on this topic). But a French “non” would serve to underscore what has long been the weakest link in the vision of a United States of Europe -- a centralized monetary policy working at cross-purposes with a politically fragmented fiscal policy. The politicians have already trashed the Stability and Growth Pact -- all but obliterating the notion of a pan-regional budgetary constraint. The French vote could take fragmentation one step further and raise serious questions about the likelihood of a harmonized legal structure -- long viewed as a linchpin of the “straight jacket” that would drive pan-regional efficiencies. This underscores the most basic contradiction of European integration -- politics and economics do not mesh.

That could be a real setback for Europe, especially since some of its stars were finally starting to come in alignment. To its credit, Old Europe has taken some big strides in the area of structural reform in recent years -- especially in coming to grips with the stranglehold of labor market rigidities. France is in the process of dismantling the 35-hour workweek, and in Germany, not only is the workforce more flexible -- with employment growth shifting dramatically to part-time and temporary workers -- but the unions are but a shadow of their former selves. Couple these changes with a long overdue step-up in IT-enabled capital deepening by European businesses and it’s even possible to get optimistic about a possible improvement in European productivity growth. These changes will not vanish into thin air in the event of a French “non.” But if the cohesion of pan-European political will is shaken on 29 May, the case for further momentum on structural change gets harder to make. Little wonder the dollar has been well bid over the past month.

Politics have also turned nasty in Asia. Over the past few years, most of us have been pleasantly surprised by a positive shift in the long tense relationship between China and Japan. As recently as two and a half years ago, Japanese officials were leading the charge in blaming China for Japan’s deflation and the hollowing out of its corporate sector (see the 1 December 2002 op-ed piece in the Financial Times, “Time for a Switch to Global Reflation” by Haruhiko Kuroda, then MOF Vice Minister for International Affairs). Japan has come full circle since then -- embracing China as a growing market for its exports as well as a low-cost offshore production platform that has become a critical ingredient of new efficiency solutions for Corporate Japan. That détente is now at risk. The recent outbreak of political hostilities between the two nations -- exacerbated by a dispute over oil drilling rights in the East China Sea -- unmasks one of Asia’s deepest fault-lines: the ultimate struggle for pan-regional leadership. A China and Japan that pull together provide Asia with a positive-sum outcome. If they grow apart, even a zero-sum result may be wishful thinking. Nationalism is the stuff of political and economic fragmentation -- very much at odds with what financial markets are looking for. That’s the case in Europe and is also increasingly evident in Asia.

Nor is the US body politic exactly an anchor of stability in this increasingly dysfunctional world. Congress has thrown down the gauntlet in its frustrations over an ever-rising trade deficit. The scapegoating of China has become a favorite sport in both the Senate and the House (see my 13 April essay, “Protectionist Perils”). The Bush Administration has now joined the fray, with Treasury Secretary John Snow suggesting over this past weekend that the days of patiently waiting for China to move on the currency front are over. Suddenly, the world is coming to a very different conclusion on China: Once viewed as an unparalleled opportunity, the Chinese miracle is now being viewed as a threat by both the US and Japan. Even in Europe, the China issue has become a source of political conflict -- underscored by debate over ending the arms embargo as well as mounting concerns over an uncompetitive Chinese currency.

The stewards of globalization are nowhere in any of this. Another G-7 meeting has come and gone, and I ask myself, Why do they even bother? The 16 April communiqué was as vacuous as ever. As the world economy lists to the downside, the G-7 states, “…the global expansion has remained robust and the outlook continues to point to solid growth for 2005.” Their primary focus on energy is to, “…welcome efforts to improve oil market data.” And they barely paid lip-service to the “elephant in the room” -- ever-widening global imbalances. The US succeeded in having any references stricken regarding its rapidly exploding current account deficit. The Wise Men appear to be smitten with Fed Governor Ben Bernanke’s recent whitewash of this problem, explaining away America’s external imbalance as an innocent outgrowth of a global saving glut (see Bernanke’s 14 April 2005 Homer Jones Lecture, “The Global Saving Glut and the U.S. Current Account Deficit”). A G-7 having its head in the sand says it all -- the managers of globalization don’t have a clue as to how to cope with the real-time problems of globalization.

Little wonder world financial markets are reeling. An unbalanced global economy is not in great shape. The global growth engine -- the United States -- continues to derive its sustenance from asset markets and the unsustainably low real interest rates that support a wealth-driven impetus to aggregate demand. Not surprisingly, the Bernanke thesis conveniently celebrates the result without looking in the mirror and acknowledging the bubble-prone Fed’s culpability in creating this moral hazard. In the absence of another global consumer, I guess the rest of the world is willing to put up with a lot in order to keep the music going. Policy blunders are bad enough. History warns us that political risks are always the most destabilizing force of all. Those risks are now rising around the world. Beset by record imbalances and mounting political perils, a precarious global economy doesn’t have much to fall back on.

Reform Jewish Movement Calls on Senator Frist to Repudiate Claim That Judicial Nominees are Victims of a &quot;Filibuster Against Faith&quot; / In Contempt of Courts

Reform Jewish Movement Calls on Senator Frist to Repudiate Claim That Judicial Nominees are Victims of a &quot;Filibuster Against Faith&quot;

In response to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist’s plan to join a telecast whose organizing theme is that those who oppose some of President Bush’s judicial nominees are engaged in an assault on “people of faith,” Rabbi David Saperstein, Director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, issued the following statement noting, support for &quot;Justice Sunday&quot; event is disingenuous, dangerous, and demagogic.

Saperstein: Support for &quot;Justice Sunday&quot; Event is Disingenuous, Dangerous, and Demagogic

WASHINGTON, April 15, 2005 –In response to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist’s plan to join a telecast whose organizing theme is that those who oppose some of President Bush’s judicial nominees are engaged in an assault on “people of faith,” Rabbi David Saperstein, Director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, issued the following statement:

The news that Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist plans to join a telecast whose organizing theme is that those who oppose some of President Bush’s judicial nominees are engaged in an assault on “people of faith” is more than troubling; it is disingenuous, dangerous, and demagogic. We call on him to reconsider his decision to appear on the telecast and to forcefully disassociate himself from this outrageous claim.

Senator Frist must not give legitimacy to those who claim they hold a monopoly on faith. They do not. They assert, in the words of Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council and organizer of the telecast, that there is a vast conspiracy by the courts “to rob us of our Christian heritage and our religious freedoms.” There is no such conspiracy. They have been unable to ram through the most extreme of the President’s nominees, and now they are spinning new claims out of thin air.

Alas, this is not an isolated incident. This past week, the Christian Coalition convened a conference in Washington entitled, &quot;Confronting the Judicial War on Faith.&quot; Their special guest speaker was the House Majority Leader, Rep. Tom Delay. When leaders of the Republican Party lend their imprimatur to such outrageous claims, including, at the conference, calls for mass impeachment of Federal Judges, it should be of deep concern to all who care about religion. It should also be of concern to President Bush whose silence, in the wake of the claims made both at the conference in Washington and in the upcoming telecast, is alarming.

The telecast is scheduled to take place on the second night of the Passover holiday, when Jews around the world gather together to celebrate our religious freedom. It was in part for exactly such freedom that we fled Egypt. It was in part for exactly such freedom that so many of us came to this great land. And it is in very large part because of exactly such freedom that we and our neighbors here have built a nation uniquely welcoming to people of faith – of all faiths. We believe Senator Frist knows these things as well. His association with the scheduled telecast is, in a word, shameful. We call upon to him to disassociate himself from the claim that the Senate is participating in a filibuster against faith, and to withdraw his participation from the April 24th event.

 In Contempt of Courts 

By Max Blumenthal, The Nation. Posted April 12, 2005.

A conference featuring Rep. Tom DeLay, Phyllis Schlafly, Alan Keyes and other religious extremists demands that judges acknowledge &quot;God as the sovereign source of law.&quot;

Michael Schwartz must have thought I was just another attendee of the &quot;Confronting the Judicial War on Faith&quot; conference. I approached the chief of staff of Oklahoma&apos;s GOP Sen. Tom Coburn outside the conference in downtown Washington last Thursday afternoon after he spoke there. Before I could introduce myself, he turned to me and another observer with a crooked smile and exclaimed, &quot;I&apos;m a radical! I&apos;m a real extremist. I don&apos;t want to impeach judges. I want to impale them!&quot;

For two days, on April 7 and 8, conservative activists and top GOP staffers summoned the raw rage of the Christian right following the Terri Schiavo affair, and likened judges to communists, terrorists and murderers. The remedies they suggested for what they termed &quot;judicial tyranny&quot; ranged from the mass impeachment of judges to their physical elimination.

The speakers included embattled House majority leader Tom DeLay, conservative matriarch Phyllis Schlafly and failed Republican senatorial candidate Alan Keyes. Like a performance artist, Keyes riled the crowd up, mixing animadversions on constitutional law with sudden, stentorian salvos against judges. &quot;Ronald Reagan said the Soviet Union was the focus of evil during the cold war. I believe that the judiciary is the focus of evil in our society today,&quot; Keyes declared, slapping the lectern for emphasis.

At a banquet the previous evening, the Constitution Party&apos;s 2004 presidential candidate, Michael Peroutka, called the removal of Terri Schiavo&apos;s feeding tube &quot;an act of terror in broad daylight aided and abetted by the police under the authority of the governor.&quot; Red-faced and sweating profusely, Peroutka added, &quot;This was the very definition of state-sponsored terror.&quot; Edwin Vieira, a lawyer and author of How to Dethrone the Imperial Judiciary, went even further, suggesting during a panel discussion that Joseph Stalin offered the best method for reining in the Supreme Court. &quot;He had a slogan,&quot; Vieira said, &quot;and it worked very well for him whenever he ran into difficulty: &apos;No man, no problem.&apos;&quot;

The complete Stalin quote is, &quot;Death solves all problems: no man, no problem.&quot;

The threatening tenor of the conference speakers was a calculated tactic. As Gary Cass, the director of Rev. D. James Kennedy&apos;s lobbying front, the Center for Reclaiming America, explained, they are arousing the anger of their base in order to harness it politically. The rising tide of threats against judges &quot;is understandable,&quot; Cass told me, &quot;but we have to take the opportunity to channel that into a constitutional solution.&quot;

Cass&apos; &quot;solution&quot; is the &quot;Constitution Restoration Act,&quot; a bill relentlessly promoted during the conference that authorizes Congress to impeach judges who fail to abide by &quot;the standard of good behavior&quot; required by the Constitution. If they refuse to acknowledge &quot;God as the sovereign source of law, liberty, or government,&quot; or rely in any way on international law in their rulings, judges also invite impeachment. In essence, the bill would turn judges&apos; gavels into mere instruments of &quot;The Hammer,&quot; Tom DeLay, and Christian-right cadres.

Conference speakers framed the Constitution Restoration Act in pseudo-populist terms--the only means of controlling a branch of government hijacked by a haughty liberal aristocracy against the will of the American people. As Michael Schwartz remarked during a panel discussion, &quot;The Supreme Court says we have the right to kill babies and the right to commit buggery. They say the people have no right to express themselves, that the people have no right to make laws. Until we have a court that reflects a majority,&quot; Schwartz continued, his voice rising steadily, &quot;it is a sick and sad joke that we have a Constitution here.&quot;

The right wing claims that judges should reflect majority opinion. But what is the majority opinion? After DeLay and Senate majority leader Bill Frist passed special bills ordering federal courts to consider the reinsertion of Terri Schiavo&apos;s feeding tube, according to a Gallup poll, Congress&apos;s public approval rating sank to 37 percent, lower than at any time since shortly after Republicans impeached President Bill Clinton. Meanwhile, 66 percent of respondents to a March 23 CBS News poll thought Schiavo&apos;s feeding tube should be removed. The notion that the Christian right&apos;s agenda is playing well in Peoria must be accepted on faith alone.

The recent right-wing fixation on impeaching judges was conceptualized by David Barton, Republican consultant and vice chairman of the Texas GOP. In 1996 Barton published a handbook called &quot;Impeachment: Restraining an Overactive Judiciary,&quot; which was timed to coincide with Tom DeLay&apos;s bid for legislation authorizing Congress to impeach judges. &quot;The judges need to be intimidated,&quot; DeLay told reporters that year.

In 1989 Barton published a book titled The Myth of Separation, which proclaims, &quot;This book proves that the separation of church and state is a myth.&quot; The Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs, in a critique of his 1995 documentary America&apos;s Godly Heritage, stated that it was &quot;laced with exaggerations, half-truths, and misstatements of fact.&quot; Barton is on the board of advisers of the Providence Foundation, a Christian Reconstructionist group that promotes the idea that biblical law should be instituted in America. In 1991 Barton spoke at a Colorado retreat sponsored by Pastor Pete Peters, an adherent of racist Christian Identity theology with well-established neo-Nazi ties. During the 2004 presidential campaign, the Republican National Committee hired him as a paid consultant for &quot;evangelical outreach.&quot; The RNC sponsored more than 300 events for him.

DeLay&apos;s bill, based on Barton&apos;s writings, failed due to lack of GOP support. But the judicial impeachment campaign was reignited six years later when a federal court ordered the removal of then-Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore&apos;s Ten Commandments monument from courthouse grounds. In February 2004 a group of about 25 enraged ministers and movement leaders gathered in Dallas to plot a new response. The Constitution Restoration Act was the result. According to Moore, he was a principal author, along with Herb Titus, the former dean of Pat Robertson&apos;s Regent University law school, and Howard Phillips, a veteran third-party activist whose U.S. Taxpayers&apos; Party served as a vehicle for the antigovernment militia movement during the 1990s. All three men stalked the halls of the downtown Marriott last Thursday and Friday.

In the Senate the bill was sponsored by Richard Shelby, a senator from Roy Moore&apos;s home state; among the co-sponsors is Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas, who is contemplating a run for the Republican nomination for President. The bill was introduced on March 3, before the Terri Schiavo affair erupted, before Florida Circuit Judge George Greer ordered the removal of her feeding tube and before he became the poster-child for the right&apos;s judicial impeachment campaign.

Now, according to Howard Phillips in a speech to the conference, his &quot;good friend&quot; Wisconsin GOP Rep. James Sensenbrenner is planning to hold hearings on the Constitution Restoration Act in the House. DeLay, who appeared on a big screen during a Thursday morning session to call for the removal of &quot;a judiciary run amok,&quot; has put his name on the act as the House sponsor.

The Schiavo case remains the flashpoint for the right. That was apparent at a Thursday evening banquet honoring the lead attorney for Terri Schiavo&apos;s parents, David Gibbs. After a breathless introduction from Peroutka, who called the removal of Schiavo&apos;s feeding tube &quot;an act of terror,&quot; Gibbs confidently strode to the lectern while a crowd of about 100 regaled him with a thunderous standing ovation. Baby-faced, with his hair molded tightly against his scalp and clad in a well-tailored navy blue suit, Gibbs maintained a cool disposition during his speech, presenting a sharp visual contrast to the wildly gesticulating, bedraggled figures who held the microphone throughout most of the conference. But Gibbs&apos; impeccable appearance and measured tone were not enough to mask the lurid nature of his speech.

First, Gibbs suggested that Schiavo fell into a persistent vegetative state not because of an eating disorder but as the result of &quot;some form of strangulation or abuse at the hands of her husband, possibly.&quot; Then, Gibbs asserted that after Schiavo&apos;s parents were awarded millions of dollars by the state to provide for her care, Michael Schiavo &quot;began moving against the family to kill his wife.&quot; These claims, however, did not hold up in court because, as Gibbs explained, &quot;a judge that never went to see [Schiavo] was the judge who made the decision that her life did not matter.&quot;

As members of the audience gasped, Gibbs painted a vivid portrait of Schiavo in her hospital bed. &quot;Terri Schiavo was as alive as anyone you see sitting here,&quot; he said. &quot;She liked my voice. It was loud and deep and she would roll over and try to talk back.&quot; But after Judge Greer &quot;literally ordered her barbaric death,&quot; everything changed.

Gibbs described his visit to Schiavo&apos;s hospital room after her feeding tube had been removed. Schiavo lay in bed &quot;with her eyes sunken deep in her head ... she was skeletal,&quot; Gibbs recounted. &quot;Then she turned to her mother suddenly, like she wanted to speak, and she just started sobbing.&quot; By now, members of the audience were crying.

As soon as he left the stage, one of the event&apos;s planners asked all the men in the room to get down on the floor and pray. With no other choice, I moved my plastic-upholstered chair aside, took to my hands and knees and listened as plaintive voices arose all around me with prayers for Schiavo&apos;s parents and maledictions against judicial tyranny. A saccharine version of Pachelbel&apos;s Canon emanating from the player piano in the hotel lobby seeped through the banquet hall&apos;s open doors, suffusing the ceremony with a dreamlike atmosphere. When I finally dared to look up from the ground, I realized that my head was only inches from an enormous posterior belonging to William Dannemeyer, the former congressman who once issued a letter to his colleagues listing 24 people with some connection to Bill Clinton who died &quot;under other than natural circumstances.&quot;

As the conference attendees filed out of the banquet hall and into the rain-flecked night, mostly silent except for the few who were still sobbing, they seemed prepared to do anything--absolutely anything--against judges. &quot;I want to impale them!&quot; as Michael Schwartz told me.

&quot;This isn&apos;t Colombia. This isn&apos;t drug lords terrorizing the judiciary. It&apos;s America,&quot; Florida Judge George Greer declared recently. Greer remains under police guard.

On Monday, April 11, at Sen. Frist&apos;s invitation, David Barton will lead him and other senators on an evening tour of the Capitol, offering &quot;a fresh perspective on our nation&apos;s religious heritage.&quot;

BAD CURRENCY--

The U.S. government must stop China&apos;s illegal currency manipulation, AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Richard Trumka said April 7 at a Capitol Hill press conference in support of the Chinese Currency Act of 2005. Chinese currency manipulation has led to record U.S. trade deficits with China and contributes to the loss of millions of U.S. manufacturing jobs. The bipartisan bill, introduced by Reps. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) and Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) with 14 co-sponsors, would define currency manipulation as a violation of existing U.S. trade laws and World Trade Organization rules. For 10 years, China has artificially pegged its currency at about 8.28 yuan to one U.S. dollar rather than letting the international financial markets set the exchange rate. Such undervaluing of its currency gives China an unfair advantage in the international marketplace and the ability to undercut U.S. manufacturing by exporting, on a large scale, products that previously were produced in this country.

10 Day sprint to save the courts

We have 10 days to stop radical Republicans from seizing absolute power to appoint extremist judges. Last time we wrote letters-to-the editor, three moderate Republican senators came out on our side. If we get three more, we win. Can you write a letter today?

Dear MoveOn member,

In the next 10 days the Republican leadership is planning to pull the trigger on their scheme to break the rules of the Senate, seize absolute power over judicial appointments, and stack the courts with extreme judges. Overnight, some of our most treasured rights, like the 40-hour work week, basic environmental protections, and the right to privacy, would be in danger. We must act.

We can win this fight if we sound an unwavering note of protest on a national scale in the next two weeks—emboldening the Democrats to fight in Congress and ensuring that moderate Republicans know the American people are counting on them to hold the line.

We&apos;re kicking off the 10 day sprint with a drive towards 10,000 letters sent to the editors of at least 1,500 different newspapers nationwide. These letters are extremely powerful tools to shape the national debate and apply direct pressure on the Senate. Two weeks ago MoveOn members published thousands of letters in papers in all 50 states. Soon afterwards, three Republican senators came out against the nuclear option, including John McCain. If we get three more, we&apos;ll win.

It just takes a few minutes to write and send a letter online—please write one today.
