Council considers spending 100,000 on &apos;McPath&apos; that would help pupils get safely from school to the nearest McDonald&apos;s

 It&apos;s unlikely to impress Jamie Oliver. Far from discouraging pupils from a junk food diet, a council could be making it even easier to indulge–by considering a 100,000 footpath that would get them from their school gate to McDonald’s with greater ease. 

 Every lunchtime 200 pupils shun school meals to walk along the grass verge of a busy road to the burger bar. 

 A footpath, already being nicknamed the‘McPath’, may be built built to make the half-mile walk safer–and the school’s head and governors are supporting it. 
 
The head and governors of Brynteg Comprehensive School in Bridgend, South Wales, gave their backing to proposed council plans for the new footpath
 
 The proposal is likely to infuriate campaigners, most notably TV chef Oliver, who have pushed for healthier school meals. 

 But council chiefs said they couldn’t stop children eating burgers and needed to protect them along the busy A48.

 Fat-cat council boss who earned 75k-a-year more than PM &apos;resigns after outcry over her salary&apos; 
 

 David Jenkins, head at Brynteg Comprehensive School in Bridgend, south Wales, said one in ten of the school’s 2,000 pupils made the daily trip for a fast food lunch. 

 He said:‘The road, as a major route, is extremely busy and presents a significant hazard for our pupils. 

 ‘The establishment of a footpath would significantly enhance their safety.’ 
 

 Yesterday, at the start of National 
Childhood Obesity Week, British Dietetic Association spokesman Melissa 
Little said the children would‘benefit far more’from staying in school
to eat balanced meals. 


 She said:‘It’s clearly not the best 
option for children having fast food every day. They risk obesity and 
heart disease, as well as feeling sluggish, not being able to focus on 
schoolwork and not being able to get through the day. 
 
Children from Brynteg Comprehensive school in Bridgend, South Wales, eating outside McDonald&apos;s. The council may build a 100,000 path from the school&apos;s gates to the fast food restaurant
 
 ‘Schools offer healthy meals. They’re there for the kids and are usually well regulated. That is going to be more beneficial.’ 

 But council spokesman Barbara Parish said road safety was‘far more important than risking more pupils eating fast food’. 

 She said:‘They are taking risks 
walking along that road and they will carry on doing it. For me, the 
safety of the children is more important than the possibility that more 
children are going to use the route. 

 ‘We are not encouraging them to go to
McDonald’s, as they are going anyway. Maybe one or two more might go 
because of this, but the good of the majority has got to come first.’ 

 Oliver managed to persuade the 
government to invest 220million in healthier school meals. But not 
everyone was a fan of his mission. 

 A backlash culminated in astonishing 
scenes at a school in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, where parents set up a‘meals on wheels’service delivering fish and chips, burgers and fizzy 
drinks to the school and passing them through the railings. 

 The children in Bridgend were 
unsurprisingly in favour of the footpath. One said:‘It’s really 
dangerous, they should at least put some railings there. Let’s face it, 
school dinners are rubbish.’A parent added:‘As long as they eat 
healthily at home it’s fine.’

How does minced beef suddenly become unhealthy when it&apos;s shaped into a burger, a slice of bread when it&apos;s the shape of a bun, or a cheese and tomato sandwich when it becomes a pizza. Bags of crisps and pots filled with noodles, yes.

I am against that path, buy more to the point, Mc Donald is generating money thanks to those kids, shouldn&apos;t they be footing the bill of that project?

This story has been a little sensationalised due to the convenience of it being McDonalds. As a fairly local person who used to live a mile or so from this road I can tell you he truth is this shortcut is used by hundreds of people on a daily basis. It links an industrial estate, a village (served by the school) and several hotels with a retail park that holds a KFC, McDonalds, Argos, Pets at Home, Tesco, Halfords etc. The shortcut takes 5 mins to walk, the long way around is about 2 miles.
So yeah - pavement being made by the council to reduce risk of death. Before anyone comes along and assumes it is the school trying to make their kids fat.

As the schools and council are encouraging kids to go to McDonalds, would it not have been cheaper to ask McDonalds to open IN the school? 
They would have paid for everything.

The simple reason WHY the kids don&apos;t eat at the school, is that they don&apos;t like the food. Fix the food, provide roughly what the kids would ask for, but make it a bit healthier. You CAN make good tasty food for reasonable amounts of money, and certainly compete with McD on price, but that would take a bit of investment in the kitchen and staff, and would probably not be as&quot;sexy&quot;as the alternative...

Do the kids who stay in school walk a mile a day?
- Tree Fellah, Knew Forest, 4/7/2011 16:28
By rule of thumb walking one mile burns 100 calories, however a big mac meal is 1495kcal&apos;s - so unless the trip is a 15 mile round trip the kids who stay in school would be better off!!!

It is the council&apos;s responsibility to make sure that whatever anyone does, it is safe. - Graham, London, UK, 04/7/2011
No Graham! - it is NOT. People like you are why this Country is in such a state! It is the individual persons responsibility to make sure they are safe. The council has nothing to do with it. Also it is an irresponsible waste of money - who makes sure the Councils are not irresponsibly wasting money????
