 For the record . . . GREAT Netbook by Aaron Morris on Nov 22,2008
I&apos;ve been using my Asus 1000HA extensively for a few days now, and thought I&apos;d post a few comments.First, let me address the two most common &quot;complaints&quot; -- the stiff touchpad keys and the placement of the right shift.TOUCHPAD KEYS: I also thought the touchpad keys were far too stiff until I realized I was using them wrong. The touchpad keys wrap around the front, and are designed to be &quot;thumbed&quot; at the front, not pushed down from the top. Once I figured out how to use them I found they are not the least bit stiff. It is actually a far better configuration than any other laptop I&apos;ve used, because when you move your hand down to use the touchpad, your thumb is naturally placed in front of the laptop, and you can flick the touchpad keys from the front instead of trying to crowd all your fingers over the touchpad. With this design, I can now easily cut and paste with one hand, where as with other notebooks I typically have to work the keys with one hand while I use the touchpad with the other. Truly brilliant. RIGHT SHIFT KEY: As to the shift key, it is technically right where it is supposed to be -- at the far right side of the keyboard. Look down at whatever keyboard you are using and you&apos;ll see the right shift key at the far right of the other primary keys (not including the number keys). But to accomodate the up arrow, Asus made the shift key half-sized. So you will find yourself occasionally hitting the up arrow when you meant to shift. I&apos;ve already programed my brain to reach a little farther when I use the right shift key, so it isn&apos;t a problem. Someone else mentioned that she used a program to switch the shift and arrow keys, so that is an option if it turns out to be a problem for you.MEMORY: I ordered the 2GB memory card along with the notebook, and installed it before I ever turned it on. It was a one minute upgrade. Thank you to all that mentioned going to the bios so that the memory would be recognized. Note that you don&apos;t do anything in the bios, just go to there and then save and exit. RAM is the most important component relating to system speed, and the memory was about $30, so I can&apos;t imagine that anyone would not want to make that upgrade. BATTERY LIFE: Battery life was one of the main reasons I bought this notebook, because the two hours I was getting on my other small notebook just wasn&apos;t cutting it. After fully charging the battery, I turned on the computer and checked the battery life, which was reported at just three hours! But as Windows got a feel for the battery, that number kept going up until it reached more than five hours. I haven&apos;t put a stopwatch to it, but I&apos;ve actually been doing a little better than that with my daily use thus far. Nice to just sit down and get to work while everyone else is fighting over the electrical outlets at the local Barnes&amp;Noble. UPDATE: I found an aftermarket 12,000 mHa battery on ebay for the 1000HA. With this battery I can go well over eight hours on a single charge! It&apos;s quite a bit bigger, so some portability is lost, but between the two batteries I can leave the power brick at home.USB PORTS: There are two on the right and one on the left. With my other laptop, having all three side by side was a problem because sometimes the item you plug in extends over another port. I had to use a multi-tap just to plug in all my stuff. The one on the left is toward the back, which is cool because I can plug in my Sprint wireless and it is out of the way.FUNCTION KEYS: I like that there are no separate buttons for mute, wireless, etc. Everything is controlled with the function keys.SPEAKERS AND TYPING ANGLE: Another brilliant design point. With my other laptop, the speakers are where you wrest your palms while typing, which means I am covering the speakers any time I am typing. The Asus puts them underneath, and the laptop is slightly raised on feet at the back to both give clearance to the speakers and create a better typing angle. The sound is very impressive for such a small notebook, and the volume is very good.SCREEN: I have no problem reading the screen, even with my tired old eyes. The native resolution of the screen in 1024 x 600. That second number means you&apos;ll be doing more vertical scrolling. Set the taskbar to auto hide and use full screen mode with your browser. I am really glad I went with this computer as opposed to the Acer One, which has a 8.9&quot; screen. I wouldn&apos;t want to go any smaller than the ten inch screen on the Asus.KEYBOARD: I&apos;m a big guy with big hands, and I have no problem touch typing on this keyboard. I&apos;d say my typos have probably increased 2% as a result of the smaller size. BOTTOM LINE: I wanted a notebook I could throw in my briefcase and keep with me at all times, and would also allow me to get real work done when I used it, without major compromises. This small notebook completely fills the bill.

 1000HA is a solid (but small) product! by K. Bau on Oct 21,2008
I just got this a few days ago (not from Amazon) and am really happy with it. As far as I can tell, it&apos;s very similar to the Asus 1000H, but it doesn&apos;t have wireless n (just b/g) and it doesn&apos;t have bluetooth. For me, that was worth the $50 savings over the 1000H.Pros:Good size. It&apos;s really easy to carry around. I hate carrying my full size laptop back and forth to work. This one slips nicely into my bag.Battery life. I get about 4 hours from the battery. I think I could squeeze more out if I used the power saving option and turned off the wireless when I&apos;m not using it. (new note: with power saving options turned on, I get just over 5.5 hrs from the battery. That also reflects having 2gb of RAM installed. - 10/26/08) Still good enough that I don&apos;t bring my power cord with me to work unless I&apos;m going to use it all day. And way better than the other netbooks I looked at.Ease of upgrade. I&apos;m not very tech savvy. However, it was WAY easy to open up my 1000HA and pop in a 2gb memory stick, and junk the 1gb stick that comes with this. You just need a small Phillips screwdriver. No weird keyboard lifting and no cracking open cases and no voiding of warranties. I almost bought the Acer Aspire One, which I think is better looking, but it&apos;s apparently more technically difficult to upgrade. The hard drive looks easy to upgrade, too. FYI, if you DO upgrade the memory yourself, make sure to F2 into the BIOS on startup. No need to change any settings in the BIOS, but the BIOS needs to automatically recognize the 2gb memory (Windows won&apos;t recognize it without the BIOS acknowledgment first).Weight. Light, but still feels substantial, so it doesn&apos;t feel like it&apos;s going to fall apart.Asus name. I guess Asus isn&apos;t a big household name, but at least I&apos;ve heard about eeePC for a little while. I almost bought the MSI Wind, which looked pretty easy to upgrade, too. But I got scared since I hadn&apos;t actually seen an MSI Wind anywhere. If someone wants to send me a free one, I&apos;ll evaluate it and re-write this review. =)Cons:The shift key on the right hand side of the keyboard is in an awkward place. I&apos;m hopeful that my brain will eventually learn where it is so I don&apos;t hit the arrow keys or the enter key by mistake all the time, but until then, it&apos;s kind of annoying. On the plus side, the rest of the keyboard works great, and I can still type comfortably with it.Glossy cover. It picks up some fingerprints. Boo. I hear the Fine Ebony version picks up even more fingerprints. They include a good neoprene-like sleeve and a fingerprint buffing cloth to keep the netbook fresh and clean, which is kind of neat.

 Sleek. Slender. Simply Stunning. by J.M. on Oct 18,2008
I received my ASUS EEE PC 1000HA on Friday, October 18, 2008. 1000HA is, in every nook and cranny, similarly designed like the 1000H. The only functionality differences are: Blue-Tooth and wireless &quot;n&quot; connectivity - which are not in 1000HA. Individuals have various needs for BT and the &quot;n&quot; connectivity. The difference in cost between 1000H and 1000HA is around $50. Remember everything else is the same on these two models.I have posted many pictures while unboxing the package. The pictures may help you make a better buying decision, just go to www.trashtalkforum.com.Many others, including myself, were going to buy the Acer Aspire One (Intel ATOM 1.6Ghz with 8.9&quot; LCD screen, but I ma glad that I didn&apos;t. The screen on the 1000HA is just perfect for me - a girl with small hands and -2.25 vision on both eyes. 10&quot; LCD works great for gaming, browsing, watching movies, and image editing. I will elaborate on gaming, movies and image editing, with sample pictures on my website. I&apos;m not sure if html codes are allowed on this forum.When I first booted it up, I had to go through the XP initial user setup. After spending 8 minutes completing that, I was able to log into Windows. It does not come with FireFox, Safari or Opera. The only browser is IE 6. I updated to FireFox 3.X.X. My router is a LinkSys Wireless router. Right now the wifi adapter on the 1000HA says the network speed is 54Mpbs. Asus EEE PC uses a very good ethernet adapter made by Atheros.Regardless of the underclocked CPU (1.32 Ghz by ASUS), the 1000HA runs smoothly and so far has not crashed at all. I have run Counter Strike Condition Zero, Warcraft III Frozen Throne, and a few other free first person shooter games that are 2 to 3 years old. 160GB HDD is partitioned into two 80GB HDD. It initially slowed down a little bit and perhaps skipped some frames when I tried to run a large video file of HIGH RESOLUTION DIVX ON VLC PLAYER. After losing that little bit of FPS, it played just fine! Not to mention I was actually running 2 FireFox windows each with 3 tabs, Windows Live Messenger, File Explorer, all simultaneously. I am a heavy-user...It opens up Adobe Acrobat Reader just fine, with no lagging. It can handle image editing but I haven&apos;t tried that with Photoshop, I just used Photoscape - an free alternative lightweight program.Finally the battery efficiency is just amazing. Acer Aspire One 1.6Ghz Intel Atom/ASUS EEE 1000H/1000HA all run on 6-cell battery. What changed my mind about the Acer, besides the screen and keyboard size, was the battery&apos;s &quot;mAh&quot; - milliampere-hour, a measure of a battery&apos;s total capacity. Acer Aspire One 1.6 Ghz, if I remember correctly, has a 6-cell 2700 mAh battery. Asus EEE pc 1000H/1000HA has a 6-cell 6700 mAh battery. Electrochemically speaking, the higher the measurement is the better and longer-lasting the battery is (under proper care of course). A 2700 mAh rechargable battery is not considered inferior at all, but in this comparison against the Asus EEE PC 1000H/1000HA, it&apos;s being outshined.Asus EEE 1000H/1000HA model provides easy access to RAM upgrade. It can be easily upgraded to 2GB with a super simple installation. Acer Aspire One.....will make you work if you are not very &quot;techie.&quot; I have seen an attempt by someone to upgrade to a 4GB ram but I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s any successful sincce I have forgotten the link to that forum which I visited 4 days ago. Hard drive can also be upgraded easily to whatever size you like, whether it&apos;s 320 GB or 650GB, as long as it&apos;s the right specs and size.There is onboard control for almost everything - sound, one-botton resolution readjustment, brightness, LCD-off (the system remains on), wifi-off, sleep mode etc.The multi-touch keypad is pretty cool too but won&apos;t be as responsive without a good individual customization. It works like an iPhone, with two fingers going diagonally on the pad you can choose to zoom in/out on the screen. With two fingers going veertically, you can scroll up and down the web browser or anything that has more than one page. Remember there are two SHIFT keys on your normal keyboard? Well the new keyboard, due to its reduced size, will take you a lot to get used to. The SHIFT key right below the enter-key is reduced to a squared finger-tip size key, and I frequently hit the the uparrow when I meant to hit the shift key on my righthand side.1000HA has a SHINY REFLECTIVE-surfaced 1.3 mega pixel web cam. 3 USB ports, audio/mic jack, VGA out, speaks on the bottom, and a ethernet jack if you prefer wired network/internet. I will post pictures on my website at www.trashtalkforum.com so you can see what I&apos;m talking about.

 It&apos;s What You Expect by Joshua B. Fassett on Nov 16,2008
Overview: It&apos;s a lightweight, ultra-portable netbook with a commendable battery life for a 6 cell. It comes with the basics pre-installed (word processor, a DVD program [a touch ironic since you probably don&apos;t have an external disc drive yet], and some eee PC specific keyboard functions). XP is XP. You know what you are going to get with that. Pros: It gets all of your day-to-day activities done. The processor isn&apos;t a powerhouse, but it is fine for word processing, browsing the internet, and watching movies. The software overclock is nice because it allows for variable battery drain (roughly 17% swing if I remember correctly) depending on your needs and distance from civilization. For the brave, dual booting with a Ubuntu (linux) is very easy to do with a couple hours of free time. The AC adapter is also very compact and travels nicely with the eee PC as well. It has a reasonably well-built webcam integrated into the laptop (with respect to many newer notebook/netbook standards). It&apos;s not the greatest, but remember what you are paying for this little beast. The microphone is rather impressive though. It is an array-style microphone built into the base of the screen that does a very good job of catching your voice without much distortion prone to other microphones. The fact that there is no disc drive is a plus in my opinion. Get yourself a nice jump drive (8 Gig. is pretty cheap now) and use that. It reduces the netbook&apos;s weight immensely, and externals are available if you don&apos;t know how to network with your other home PC. Lastly, the touchpad has some very helpful functions built in. It has 1, 2, and 3 finger functionality that helps with some basic computing tasks. I was very impressed with this feature.Cons: This should not be bought in lieu of a home or base computer if you do not own an external disc drive. If you have a home system, you can access the other computer&apos;s disc drive over a network and won&apos;t need an external disc drive (Note: I would recommend buying an external for watching movies). It is true that the shift key is a little awkward at first. You do get used to it though - don&apos;t let this scare you. You will not be playing the latest and greatest video game spectacles on this thing. I tried Warcraft III just for kicks, and I was greeted with a blue screen after 5 minutes. Remember, this netbook is designed for the traveling professional or student that wants ultra-portability. The battery life isn&apos;t really 7 hours either. Expect about 5 hours of reasonable battery use. The only time you will get 7 actual hours of use is if you have the wireless card and screen turned off and you are listening to iTunes. Lastly, the wireless card drivers don&apos;t seem to be too hardy in the latest Ubuntu distribution. I imagine this will be fixed, but be prepared for it to be a bit finicky. If you don&apos;t play with Linux though, don&apos;t worry about the last one.Conclusion: This system does a great job at doing what it was made to do. You won&apos;t be disappointed, and you won&apos;t be regretting your purchase if you need something that can be taken anywhere with little hassle. I purchased this for my trip to Europe (not expecting to be connected to a jack that often), and I cannot recommend this netbook enough.

 ASUS versus ACER. ASUS wins hands down. by BD, Upstate New York on Dec 8,2008
I just bought this ASUS Eee PC and have played with it for the last 3 days. I am very impressed, so much so that I have decided to sell my HP 15&quot; DV6165cl laptop and go with this instead. The reasons: All I do is surf, email, do word processing and, having recently been set up with Slingbox, watch my Home Satellite PVR on it when I am away. This machine does all of that beautifully with 2 critical bonuses: 1)Its battery life seems to be around 5 hours, give or take, which is amazing compared to 2 hours for the HP laptop.2)Its weight and size are so perfect for portability, whereas the 15&quot; laptop is just too big for that.I recently tested out an Acer Aspire One 1.60 GB Atom processor, 160 HDD with 1 gb of memory. Here is where I feel this ASUS beats the Acer hands down:1) The battery life of the Acer is max. 2 hours. Enough said.2) The sound, the sound, the sound. While not digital home theater quality, it&apos;s just about as good as any HP laptop, for example, which is quite fine for watching online stuff, videos or home TV via Slingbox as I do. The Acer sound, on the other hand, (how may I put this delicately so as not to offend the general public...) SUCKS!!!!! It&apos;s low, muted and awful. In order to watch a video or Slingbox TV, I had to plug in an external set of speakers.3) The ASUS boots up much faster.4) At 10&quot;, the screen is 1.1 inches bigger than the 8.9 Acer. The screen resolution and brightness are very nice indeed.5) Everything feels so much more solid on the ASUS and smudges so much less.6) In order to upgrade the memory on the ACER, you literally have to dismantle it, i.e., remove the keyboard and dive inside, at your own risk, of course. To upgrade the memory on the ASUS to a 2 Gb stick, it&apos;s just the standard &quot;unscrew-panel-and-insert&quot; routine. Remove this one underside panel and you have instant access to the memory and the hard drive.7) One great thing that I just figured out on my own is that you don&apos;t have to click or double click the left mouse button, just one-tap or two-tap on the track pad instead with your finger. Take that those of you who say that the mouse buttons are the stiffest and most difficult to use that they have ever come across, which by the way is untrue for me. They are simply sturdy, to go along with the sturdy construction I mentioned in point 5) which I, for one, appreciate.8) The Acer comes with this tight plastic carrying sleeve that doesn&apos;t even zip. While not a laptop carrying case, the ASUS carrying pouch is roomy enough for you to put in and pull out the unit with room to spare, it has a zipper and is not &quot;plasticky&quot;. It has a velour-like finish.9) The ASUS has 4 little sharp and sturdy silver hot buttons on the top of the keyboard to turn the display on and off, bring up messenger or skype, change the resolution of the monitor, etc... Very, very handy.10) The Acer keyboard is smaller, flimsier, and more difficult to accurately type on than the ASUS. As for the supposed poor placement of the right shift key on this ASUS, not being a touch typist, I have not yet been even remotely bothered by it. It is for all of these reasons that this ASUS is a keeper and that the ACER would simply not have been a long term pleaser for me.

 Excellent PC by D. Libin on Nov 12,2008
The ASUS Eee 1000 pc is a fantastic little netbook. I got the HA because it was over 50 dollars cheaper than the H, with the only differences being lack of bluetooth and wireless N, neither of which I need. This netbook is great for what I needed. I bought it so that I could take notes in class without having to haul my 17 inch monstrosity to class, as well as taking it to the library and study rooms. Interestingly, its use has expanded for me. I just use it as a secondary computer. My laptop might as well be a desktop because it never moves from the tabletop anymore. The netbook does just about everything I do with my normal laptop. I do plenty of word-processing, browsing the web, powerpoints, etc. When studying, I often have a browser with half a dozen tabs open, several powerpoint documents, and some word documents. The computer doesn&apos;t skip a beat. This computer shouldn&apos;t be expected to do anything even remotely graphics intensive. I do, however, use it to watch hulu sometimes, which it still struggles with a bit. I can stream it fine on low quality, with some skipping once in a while, but it is almost unwatchable on high quality (480p). The computer does fine on normal videos, but I suppose it takes more to stream from the web. In any case, it&apos;s still watchable, but I&apos;m considering purchasing an additional gig of RAM for it, which should really remedy any remaining issues. I&apos;ll update if I purchase the RAM.The computer runs virtually silent, with some hard drive clatter once in a while (which is only audible in a silent room). The fan is imperceptible at any noise level.I&apos;ve found that the battery life is great. When I take it to class, I set everything to low, including the screen, which is plenty readable at the 2nd to last brightness setting. It lasts through my longest classes and then some. I&apos;ve had it last over five hours with wireless off, and turning it on doesn&apos;t decrease the life too much. It&apos;s pretty much as good as six cells get. In any case, I&apos;m very pleased with this computer. I did a slew of research before taking the dive, but this seems to be the best netbook for the money. Also, if you are wondering about the keyboard, which I heard complaints about when I was researching, it&apos;s great now. I believe the earlier issues were having significant flex on the corners, but the keyboard on my example was flawless. The HA was released a bit later, so they probably fixed it on all models by now.

 Amazing deal for the buck by B. Schauerhamer on Jan 16,2009
I have been debating what netbook to get for a few weeks now and decided to go with this one, the Asus 1000HA because I have always prefered Asus motherboards over MSI and have never been a fan of Acer computers. I just have to say I am extremely happy with the purchase. I will admit there are some things that take some getting used to, the slightly smaller keyboard and the smaller screen are the main ones, but after all you have that no matter what laptop you decide to get.The pluses of EeePC are:Small and light weight the main reason for me getting a netbook to take around school. I have enough weight with the books.Battery life is amazing, I tested it out yesterday to see how long the battery life would last with internet browsing, idling and some word processing through out the day at school. Normally I would plug my laptop in or else it would be dead within 2 hours and the EeePC lasted all day with about 6 hours of use time and 6 hours in stand by time with 35% of the battery life left.The 1.6Ghz Intel atom is powerful enough to run Call of Duty 4 at the lowest res and settings.The sound quality is amazing the Dolby Sound Room really enhances the speaker, they truly emulate surround sound speakers.The quick res change button really helps I keep it at 1024x600 but if you wanted you could change it to 1024x768 compressed although it makes the text hard to read. The video card supports up to 1920x1080 if you choose to have that setting without an external monitor you can scroll left and right and up and down to different parts of the screen. Not sure why you would do this but the option is there if you want it.It comes with a nice sleeve so you don&apos;t have to pay extra money and then going through the hassle of getting one that fits correctly. It even has room for the power cord in it.The track pad uses smart pad technology you can use the left and right buttons like a regular mouse and if you click both of them at the same time it does a middle click by default but you can change it. You can even switch the buttons around to get the feel of a left handed mouse if that is what you are used to. You can zoom in and out, rotate graphics on their axis, drag and drop, magnify glass, page up, page down features, and a quick link to open My Computer and switch windows.The only negative thing that I find about the EeePC is the glossy finish on the top of it, I am one who hates fingerprints and they show up with the slightest touch however Asus included a nice cleaning cloth for the screen and the top of the netbook.** EditJust an update on this review. I didn&apos;t change anything above but am making a suggestion to purchase http://www.amazon.com/1000HA-10-Inch-Netbook-Premium-Memory/dp/B001HLA3MG/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s;=apparel&amp;qid;=1232463051&amp;sr;=8-1 this case for it.The case is slim and has a front pocket to store a mouse and cable. I only purchased this before I knew my netbook had a sleeve in it and glad I did, it has memory foam protection to give you a little more support for the netbook. To view my full review of the case please visit the link.**I hope that whoever reads this review finds it useful if you don&apos;t I am sorry you might have wasted your time.Good luck in your purchase.

 great netbook with a few quirks----some tips for use by C. Henke on Jan 22,2009
This is a great little netbook---like many others, I have been looking for a small laptop for traveling, taking to the library, sitting on the couch, etc. This is it. When my 7 y.o. daughter first saw it, she said, &quot;aww, it&apos;s so cute!&quot; It is cute, but you can get some serious work done on this computer, too. I have upgraded the RAM to 2GB, installed MS Office 2007, and have been using it quite extensively for writing over the past two weeks. This is a computer that&apos;s nice for doing some light web surfing around home, sure, but it can handle a lot more.Here are some pros so far:---The screen is very bright and clear---the battery life is great (5+ hours---longer w/o wireless)---the Atom processor seems quick and efficient; this thing starts up and shuts down a LOT faster than my other laptop, also running XP---I love the fact that it doesn&apos;t get too hot; my other laptop gets uncomfortably hot after using it on my lap for anything more than a few minutes. The eee gets a little warm on the bottom, but not bad at all.---there are so many things that seem to be well thought-out on this computer, including the little things like a nice neoprene case for storage and even an included microfiber cloth for There are some cons, however:---like everyone says, the right shift key takes some adjustment. I am still trying to get the hang of it and always have to pause a little bit when I want to capitalize something, so that my finger can make the extra stretch (assuming I remember)---the trackpad buttons look sleek but are not designed well. They are too hard to press, yes, but they also are almost useless for things like dragging and dropping. Everytime I try to hold down the left button so that I can select and hold an object (and icon, a scroll bar, or highlighting a paragraph), I have to press really hard on the button to keep the pointer locked on.---as I said, the screen is great, but it is a little small for looking at a good sized spreadsheet.---I like to use the &quot;home&quot; and &quot;end&quot; keys a lot for getting around a document or a webpage. You need to press a function key to use home and end on the eee, since there is not a dedicated key for them.Here are a few tips for getting more from your eee netbook:---learn how to use the trackpad gestures; they are handy and a way to get around having to use the buttons. You can see how the gestures work by opening up the Mouse properties from the Control Panel. There is a tab for the trackpad that shows how to use the gestures.---get a small wireless mouse to take with you; I got a Logitech model with a tiny USB receiver that you can leave in the side of the netbook all the time.---set the Start menu and Taskbar to &quot;auto hide&quot; so you can get a little more screen space.---use Google&apos;s Chrome browser, as it is fast and also has a low profile on your screen, again giving you more screen space to work with---install the free version of AVG Anti-Virus ([...]) since the eee doesn&apos;t come with any anti-virus software, and Windows will keep bugging you about this.---if you have another computer with a cd or dvd drive, use the Windows networking wizard to create a home network, and you can access the drive from your eee, allowing you to install software from CDROMS. This is how I installed MS Office on my netbook, and it worked great, once I got my computers to talk with each other.UPDATE: I finally took the plunge and installed Key Tweak to remap several of the keys on my eee. Of course, first thing I did was to switch the right shift key and the up arrow. Then I found a great idea on an eee user group forum (see the discussions here on Amazon about the eee - there are some links to this info) about switching the right/down arrow keys by removing them and switching them around. So I swapped 4 keys total---they are the same size, so they will fit with no problems. Then I also set the Windows Start Menu key to act as a &quot;home&quot; key and the right-click (context) key as &quot;end,&quot; so I don&apos;t have to use the Fn key to use these keys anymore (I never used either the Start key or the context menu key, so I won&apos;t miss them). This is a great &quot;upgrade&quot; that is easy to do and will make the eee work for you even better.

 Not my cup of tea by isk on Nov 17,2008
I sold my Asus Eee PC 1000ha after using it extensively for around 10 days. Overall, this is a machine with great potential and this is also a machine with fatal flaws that are intolerable to me.Pros1. The keyboard is roomy, the alphabetic keys, the enter key and backspace key are big enough for touch typing. (some reviewers said they didn&apos;t like the right shift key, but luckily it&apos;s not a big problem for me, cause I only use the left shift key when I touch type)2. Good performance-price ratio (Intel Atom, 1GB Ram, 160GB hard drive, 1.3M webcam, 6-cell battery make it a compelling buy for the current price tag) Cons (things that make me not keeping this machine)1. The left and right mouse buttons are way **too stiff to press**. No kidding, this eee pc has the worst left and right mouse buttons I have ever met in my life. You need to press REALLY HARD for a single click, it&apos;s even HARDER for a double click, it&apos;s almost impossible for me to complete tasks such as drag and drop by using these mouse buttons. My index finger became extremely painful after using the touch pad and mouse buttons for more than 15 minutes.2. Before I bought this machine, I was expecting a relatively slow (when compared with C2D processors nowadays) but quite machine. After using it for 10 days, I found the speed is not a big problem for me, however, I didn&apos;t like the fact that this machine was as noisy as those cheap $4xx laptops. The fan keeps running when the room temperature is around 80 F.Update: I bought a Dell Mini 9 after selling this Eee PC 1000ha. The Dell mini 9 uses a no-fan passive cooling design and there is no noise at all when the computer is running. The Mini 9 keyboard is not as roomy as Eee PC&apos;s, but the mouse buttons are at least as good as those in regular notebooks (please allow me to repeat again - the left and right buttons in eee pc 1000ha are abysmal)

 Asus 1000HA by Joe &quot;JC&quot; on Nov 11,2008
I purchased one of these a few weeks ago for use as my primary computer. I am a full time college student and use a bicycle instead of a car so I wanted something lite to save my back. I chose the ASUS because of the longer battery life and functional keyboard. Also I was able too get it without sales tax since I live in CA so it was cheaper than a competitors site.So here is my take: The screen is small, but it is not too bad. The Keyboard is a big deal for me because I do type lab reports on this. I have found it to be fully useable and am able to touch type as almost fast as on a full sized keyboard. The keys are smooth and do not feel cheap. The battery life I get is about five hours, which seems good. You are supposed to fully charge it before you use it the first time and I didnt do that.  You need to be in a quiet place to use the speakers. The webcam is ok.I put OpenOffice on mine as it only comes with MS Works and OO has a better GUI. It boots to the user accounts password page in about 30 seconds, which strikes me as fast, I don&apos;t have much to compare it to except for the PC&apos;s at the JC and they take forever. Everyone who has handled my ASUS has complimented it&apos;s &quot;cuteness&quot; and commented that it feels sturdy. The only other netbook I have handled is the ACER aspire one that they sell at Walmart. I think that the 8.9 inch size would still be useable for typeing however it would be difficult.Joe

 Eee PC 1000ha 1 month review by B. Ng on Oct 29,2008
I was looking for a compact notebook to surf the web, and listen to music. Something I can take anywhere with good battery life. Pros: Bright&amp;clear 10&quot; display. Good speakers for the size(I recommend head phones with good bass to really enjoy music and movies)160gb hard drive is large enough to carry all my media and documents.Solid 3-5 hour battery life, longer with proper settings and usage.Cons:The &quot;right shift key&quot; is something everyone complains about and does require sometime to get use to.Key pad buttons are really firm.Touch pad could be unresponsive using the multi-touch sometimes(might be from drivers). (I recommend a notebook mouse)Glossy surface will be a fingerprint magnet.Final thoughts:No disc drive, but hard drive is large enough to carry converted movies.I really enjoy having this notebook, because I can be in the living room watching sports and keep up with my fantasy teams. *Ram upgrading: When upgrading the ram us the F2 key to enter the bios and make sure it recognizes the new ram then save the settings and boot normally. I had to look up a couple forums to figure out why windows didn&apos;t recognize the new ram.

 Perfect balance of form and function by kevin374 on Dec 6,2008
Recieved my 1000HA a few days ago and have been using it nonstop since then. In the past days the unit has exceeded my expectations and re-inforced my choice :)I researched the purchase of a NetBook for about a month prior to making a decision. Among those I considered were the EEE1000HA, EEE901, Aspire One and MSI Wind. The MSI Wind somehow did not appeal to me so I excluded that right away. I played with the Aspire One at the store for a while and could not get used to the side mouse button configuration which I found extremely frustrating to use. I also did not like the fact that the 6 cell battery on the Acer was only 2700mAH and the weight with the 6 cell was 2.8 lbs which was almost as heavy as the 10&quot; 1000HA. The 901 I excluded because the keyboard was a bit too miniscule. Even though portability was extremely important to me I felt the 901 is just too small and would tire me out with anything more than 15 mins of usage. That left the 1000HA. I chose it because I felt it was a perfect fit.- Great battery life, I get a solid 5 hrs with wi-fi/video/audio activity. The suggested 7 hrs is not happening but 5hrs is very realistic to expect with typical use.- Plays DVDs great with absolutely no jerking, I use DVDShrink to create an ISO image of a DVD and transfer it using an SDHC card. The unit ships with Intervideo DVD preinstalled which can play a DVD directly from a location on the hard disk.- Awesome keyboard: for such a small unit I am thankful that the keyboard is so easy to use, it is 95% the size of a regular keyboard- 10&quot; screen is perfect size: I felt this size is the best compromise between portability and functionality, it does not cause any undue eyestrain. The LCD is bright and colors look great.- Very portable: At 3.2lbs it&apos;s a good bit lighter than my Thinkpad T60 and the lack of weight is definitely noticable, I feel this netbook is at the limit of how small a portable computer should be. Anything smaller is going to be really difficult to use. The power adapter is also quite dimunitive.- Comes with a nice soft case and LCD cleaning cloth- Webcam: The webcam at 1.3 Megapixel is extraordinary for a unit of this size and price point. It is very clear and the embedded microphone does a great job. I am able to videoconference with friends in Europe and Asia via Skype (which is pre-installed) with excellent results.The 160GB hard drive is partitioned into 80GB and 60GB usable partitions. The other 20GB is supposed to be some kind of hidden recovery partition in case the system crashes, not sure about it. For a netbook 140GB is plenty anyway so I&apos;m not concerned. My only gripe about the unit is that the trackpad buttons are hard to press. The left button doesn&apos;t bother me so much because I started to use tap to click and it works very well, but right clicking is still hard. The gestures are great but I haven&apos;t had a chance to use that very much.Asus has carefully thought out the design of this unit and it shows in how easy and intuitive it is to use. I think this unit delivers a lot for it&apos;s price and if you&apos;re looking for an extremely portable machine with all the basic capabilities most of us will use on the road you cannot go wrong with the 1000HA. Highly recommended!

 Almost Perfect by M. C. Dang on Nov 12,2008
Overall, I love my new netbook. The 10&quot; screen size is perfect,not too small. I can easily slip it into my purse, and 3.3lbs is light enough, the shiny black exterior is beautiful but can show smudges easily. Booting up is surprisingly fast as is general processing; I am not super tech-savvy, and used it right out of the box, without manipulating anything to increase performance. The keyboard feels almost full size to me, but I have smaller hands, so typing is no problem.Some minor anoyances do exist, however: The right &quot;shift&quot; button is farther right on the keyboard than usual. In its usual place is the &quot;up arrow&quot; so there has been some mishaps when I type fast. The other issue is the netbook doesn&apos;t connect up to the internet through my Linksys wireless router without my rebooting the router. This doesn&apos;t happen everytime, but happens when the router is rebooted when the netbook is not on (as when the power goes off) .I would highly recommend this netbook for its price-for-performance, and super portability.

 Great Value For Money by A. Sharma on Dec 26,2008
As I already have a regular 14&quot; laptop(which is sometimes a little cumbersome to carry), I was looking for an inexpensive, portable second laptop. After seeing ASUS netbook ad on internet, I bought an ASUS 900 with 16 GB SSD but had to return it as the performance just sucked. I then upgraded to ASUS 1000HA and after one month of extensive use I&apos;m very satisfied with its performance.The Good- Intel Atom 270 is just great for everyday computing needs. I&apos;ve installed MS office and it works just fine. There is no perceived slowness. - The 160 GB HDD makes sure you will not run out of memory for most of your everyday computing needs.- 1 GB memory. Having windows XP home with 1 GB is a great value. Even with 7 to 8 browsers open along with a few spread sheets and documents, I still have 400 MB to spare. A great relief when you look at the price and size of the laptop.- Weight 3 lb. I sometimes need to move around with my bag and laptop. With my regular 7 lb laptop, I need to close it and reopen as its too heavy to hold in one hand when open. With EEE, I can keep it open while I move around. - Battery Life. It has a 6 cell battery, just like regular laptops and as its smaller, I get about 45 minutes of additional running time(3.5 hrs).The Not so Good - The keyboard. Its a little cramped, given the size of notebook. Though the keys are regular sized, I&apos;m still to learn how to use shift key. I normally use the right shift. In ASUS, its much smaller. I keep hitting the up arrow instead, which is frustrating at times. For using End or Home keys I have to press Fn key as these are shared with arrow keys.- The resolution. 1024 X 600 is fine but given the size of the screen, a higher option would have allowed more viewing area. I&apos;ve started using Google Chrome browser on this laptop as it gives more viewing area than IE or Firefox.- Speaker quality is not much good, though it has Dolby sound room.- I&apos;m unable to charge my iPod through its USB ports.- My palms are sweaty and the laptop is glossy. I need to keep wiping off my finger prints.Overall a great laptop for the price. I&apos;d recommend it as your back up laptop.

 Worked as advertised! by R. Fuentes on Feb 6,2009
I want to thank all of you who took the time to write a review for the Asus 1000HA netbook. It worked as everyone had stated. I am very pleased with my netbook. I have been using my netbook for about two weeks without any issues. The additions I made to the computer are as follows: 1. I purchased the Kingston KVR667D2S5/2G 2GB 667MHz DDR2 Non-ECC CL5 SODIMM ValueRam memory. I replaced the 1 GB memory that came installed with the netbook before I turned it on the first time. The netbook recognized the new memory without any problems. I had to do nothing else! Price: $23.01 at Amazon.com. Link: http://www.amazon.com/Kingston-KVR667D2S5-2G-Non-ECC-ValueRam/dp/B000JREMTO/ref=pd_bbs_7?ie=UTF8&amp;s;=electronics&amp;qid;=1233940422&amp;sr;=8-72. I purchased a LG (model GP08LU10) 8x Slim Portable External Super Multi DVD Rewriter with Lightscribe. This device worked like a charm with my netbook. It is powered by a USB cable alone. I view DVDs movies without a glitch. It also came with Nero Express DVD/CD burning and Lightscribe software (although, you&apos;ll need to purchase special Lightscribe disks to take advantage of this cool feature. Otherwise, you can use regular DVD/CDs for burning purposes). Price: $99.95 at Fry&apos;s Electronics in California. [..................] 3. I purchased the Logitech V450 Nano wireless mouse. The reason it is called &quot;Nano&quot; is because the USB receiver used for the mouse is tiny and hardly noticeable. The small size of the receiver allows the case I purchased (item 4 below) to be used without any issues. I leave the USB receiver in the left USB port all the time, which still leaves me two USB ports on the right side of my netbook. The mouse has excellent features and works great with the netbook. This mouse is very precise. After installing the mouse, visit Logitech.com/downloads for free software which enhances the features of the mouse. Price: $37.95 at Amazon.com. [..................] 4. I purchased the ASUS Eee PC 1000HA 10-Inch Netbook Premium Memory Foam Pouch Case with Front Pocket - (Black). The case was a perfect fit. Unlike the pouch that came with the netbook, this new pouch I purchased has a front pocket which can store the AC adapter. The pouch case that came with the netbook I use now to hold items 2 and 3. It works great! [..................] Thanks again! Enjoy it if you buy it!

 I love this netbook! by Greg on Jan 10,2009
I received my netbook about a week or so ago and have kept it busy ever since. I immediately added the 2GB ram instead of the 1GB it comes with. I installed iTunes and converted several WMA CD files over and docked an iPod with it, and downloaded some songs and movies. I connected my external USB DVD burner and loaded MS Office and 3 digital movie copies on it. I moved all of my digital photos onto it. So far I have found no PC performance issues with any of the above tasks.I really did not want a bulky 15&quot; laptop, but I was concerned about the small screen so I chose the 10&quot; model. I have been very pleased with how well I can view the screen despite its small size. I do not have any issues with it, and am thrilled to be able to tote this thing around as simply as I do. The battery life is amazing as well. I rode in a car the other day for 4 hours while converting my WMA files into iTunes. The gauge still showed over an hour remaining. Perhaps at the lowest power setting you could even get the advertised 7 hours out of it, but I have not tried.As people have mentioned, there is no caps lock key light indicator but that does not bother me at all. If you have inadvertently left it on, many programs alert you to that or you notice it once you begin typing. The shift key on the right is pretty annoying to me because I am a fast typist that uses both shift keys. I find myself hitting the up arrow key because that is really where the shift should be. I understand there is a key tweak program out there to change the key programming but I haven&apos;t bothered with that yet. The case does show fingerprints pretty bad, but the cloth they package with it does an amazing job making it look as good as new. Overall I give this five stars because it is perfect for me. I really feel this to be the best one out there for the money, since you get the 10&quot; screen, the large 160GB hard drive, Windows XP, and the 6 cell battery.

 Best notebook I ever had. by V. CHAN on Jan 8,2009
I had previously owned a 15 inch $1099 Win XP Dell Inspiron laptop; a 12 inch $999 Vista Dell XPS laptop and a 15 inch $599 Win XP Compaq laptop. I was disappointed with all of these expensive laptops but I am extremely pleased with the 10 inch 6 cell Asus eeepc 1000 HA which I only paid $389!It is just the right size and weight and the battery life is 4 to 5 hours which is at least 2 hours longer than my expensive laptops. I thought not having a DVD drive would be a handicap but the $39 &quot;DVD Cloner 6&quot; software program can convert a DVD movie disc into a 4 gig movie file using my desktop PC which can then be transferred to my Asus 1000HA. I am converting all my personal movies for my personal use similar to my conversion from music CDs into MP3. A CD/DVD drive may become obsolete like a floppy drive with jump drives approaching 32 gig and more. I used an old HP external CD drive to load windows XP programs like Ghost and Partition magic. I will never use Windows Vista again since the bootup and shutdown time on my Asus eeepc is twice as fast.  The 10 inch screen is bright and detailed. Watching a converted DVD movie is a pleasure and the smaller screen guarantees you won&apos;t run out of battery life. The charging brick is 1/3 the size of a regular notebook&apos;s charging brick. Opening the large bottom cover plate also provide complete access to the RAM memory, 160 gig hard drive and wireless card. This means the Asus eeepc 1000HA is easily upgradable which you can&apos;t say the same for the other netbooks. The weaknesses of a difficult touch pad button and fingerprints are true...but these are minor weaknesses that I can accept given all of the advantage of upgradability, price, weight, battery life and quality. A good wireless mouse solves the weaknesses with the touch pad button. Please note that I have built three desktops computers with Asus motherboards and I never had any problems with Asus products. Asus invented this class of netbooks and they are much better than similar netbooks from HP, Dell and Acer. The Asus eeepc 1000HA is a highly recommended product.

 My best laptop ever. I am using it now to write this. by Jerry Shelton on Jan 19,2009
ASUS EEE PC 1000HAI bought my Asus Eee PC 1000HA based on my experience with my original 7 inch Asus Eee PC, which I purchased when Everex and Walmart dropped the ball on the introduction of the Cloudbook. I love that little machine and take it along wherever I go. Nobody can believe the performance of it. I use it exclusively for INTERNET and the other features designed into it. I do not use it as a substitute for a full-blown desktop unit. I call it &quot;bullet-proof&quot; as I have never had a crash or failure of any kind. And the screen, though smallish, is amazingly clear and easy on the eyes. Unfortunately, Acer introduced the Aspire One first, right before the 1000HA. The slick advertising campaign and general appearance convinced me to buy one. And I liked the fact that it is really light weight for carrying around easily. I thought it was the best computer I ever had until it was 2 weeks old. That is when it literally burned up. Then I called it the Expire One. Acer fixed it, but I have never trusted using it much since.Now to what really is the best computer I have ever had, the Eee PC 1000HA. From the minute I started to unwrap it, just like with the original Asus Eee PC, I had the feeling that this is a company that really cares. The product radiates quality and great engineering to the smallest detail. The manual is first class, slick, and in color. The computer looks and is rock solidly built. It is more impressive to me than my Sony Vaio at about 6 times the money. The first thing you notice when you open the lid is the large label to the right of the touch pad that says, &quot;One Day Computing 7 hours battery life&quot;. I get easily 6 or more hours without babying it at all. I do not dim the display or avoid the hard drive or my peripherals. I just use the computer; and it works. If there were no other reason to really want to have this computer, this would be enough. Plus, it totally boots up in just a few seconds and I have a lot of stuff on it. The keyboard measures 5.5 inches from the right side of the&lt;A&gt; key to the right side of the&lt;L&gt; key, whereas on a full-size keyboard that comes out to 6.0 inches. So, it is about 1/12th shorter meaning that the whole thing is about 92% full-size - just what HP brags about. The big difference is that these keys are shaped normally and are very easy to use and can even be seen in low light conditions for the occasional searching for a particular function key or something that you do not normally find by &quot;touch&quot;. But then, why would anybody use a 92% full-size keyboard when a roll-up silicone full-size USB plug-in one with the separate numeric keypad costs about $10.00 at Staples? That is what I use with the &quot;baby&quot; Eee PC.I am no fan of touch-pads, preferring a USB plug-in mouse or wireless one, but if I had no choice this would be the best one I have ever used. They just forgot the on/off switch that HP put on theirs - one of the few things HP did right.The screen is terrific. The Wi-Fi, hard-drive, USB ports, and everything else work perfectly. No complaints on any of it. It doesn&apos;t even run hot like everything else, though I still highly recommend a &quot;chill-mat&quot; for any portable or net book, just in case. And, even the AC adapter looks professional if you can imagine that - blue pilot light and all.So, what is wrong with this computer? Well, I would really appreciate a lamp or an screen icon to remind me when I am in &quot;all caps&quot; mode and the right hand &quot;shift&quot; key is in a little bit of an awkward position until I get used to it. No other negatives that I can think of. It isn&apos;t even too heavy.Would I recommend this piece of equipment? Absolutely. What will I buy next? Why, whatever Asus comes up with or maybe another of these before XP disappears from the planet. Even the software operates like it is supposed to, without &quot;permissions&quot; and &quot;you don&apos;t own the file&quot; errors like Linux is constantly pointing out to you. By the way, with the Eee PC, anything you plug into the USB ports is immediately automatically configured and ready to use. Try adding a printer to a Linux machine - what a joke.Lastly, if Asus ever comes out with an automobile, I am going on the waiting list right away, trust me. Buy this computer without hesitation quick before they are all gone. Oh, and it goes without saying that Amazon.com is the only place to ever order any computer equipment, because you know they carry the best selection at the right price, know how to pack and ship, and do not forget you after the sale. This is experience talking.

 Exactly what I was looking for! by M. Dang &quot;MDanger&quot; on Oct 28,2008
I did a lot of research on the ASUS eee PCs and finally decided to buy the 1000HA model. Its perfect for my needs as college student. It allows me to study online lectures, type up documents, and check email anywhere and anytime on campus due to the campus wide wifi connection. The 10-inch screen is bright and easy on my eyes, speakers have good sound quality for such a small notebook, and not to mention the whole unit is pretty sexy looking. It was ready use right out of the box. I do agree with other reviews that although the keypad is perfect size for my medium size hands, the right shift key&apos;s placement is a bit annoying. As a whole, I think I might a wise decision going with the cheaper HA model sacrificing more weight and less wireless capability for more storage and better value. It looks like me and my eee PC are going to have a bright future together!

 Exceeded Expectations by HS &quot;HS&quot; on Dec 25,2008
Update:So I have had and used this laptop now for 3 years and I still stand by the review below. Never thought I would get so much out of a $300 laptop. I upgraded it to Windows 7 Pro and it keeps humming through application with no problem. I am sure I will keep using this thing for another year before I would even considering an upgrade.Pros: 1. Beautiful, bright screen (as good if not better than my $1,000 Dell laptop.)2. Small size and reasonable weight (not incredibly light, but very manageable at ~3 pounds).3. Much faster than I was expecting. Zips through most applications.4. Easy to upgrade.Cons:Right shift key, something I will get used to very quickly.This is truly a break-through product. Finally someone has gone back to the basics on what a laptop is supposed to do (meet your needs when AWAY from your desk and be PORTABLE). I was tired of carrying around laptops that are getting bigger by the day. Although it is great having a 16 inch screen when you travel, it is much more convenient having a laptop that is only an afterthought when packing AND does not get crushed when the guy in front of you in coach reclines his seat. This unit is packed with features for very little money. As soon as I got this, I popped in a 2GB memory module and loaded it up with Office 2003 Professional, and a slew of productivity applications. This little guy runs them with no problems!I considered the Aspire One before buying this unit. There are three reasons that drove me to the Asus. First, I saw several complaints regarding the wireless on the Aspire (who wants a mini laptop with bad wireless). Second, the Aspire is VERY difficult to upgrade (apparently you have to disassemble the whole thing to get it up to 1.5GB in memory). Third, the build quality on the Asus unit is top notch versus questionable hinge performance on the Aspire.1000 vs 1000 HA vs 1000 H. The 160GB hard drive was a no brainer for me vs the SSD on the 1000 due to capacity. I chose the HA saving ~$50 because I rarely use bluetooth and g wireless is plenty fast for my needs. If bluetooth on a laptop are critical to you or N wireless is a must have, then choose the H.The (in)famous right shift key is bit frustrating, but you will quickly get used to it and have your fingers work around the issue. If you are looking for a portable laptop that meets your needs when you are away from home or office, this is the one.

 Expected sturdier build by Dereck M. Tabata &quot;JM on Jan 2,2009
I really wanted to like the 1000HA - for all the positive reasons expressed in the reviews. I had three units with all the same problems, so I finally gave up on the 1000HA and bought the Samsung NC10 (which I have now had for two weeks or so - home run with the first unit).I had two main problems with the 1000HA: speakers crackled and the housing around the battery quickly loosened up so that too much play developed around the battery. Mind you, I experienced these problems with three different units.If these kinds of issues don&apos;t bother you, the 1000HA is otherwise a great machine. It does start up faster than my Samsung NC10 (even after I upgraded the memory on the Samsung).

 Perfect second/mobile computer by That&apos;s CrazyTalk! on Jan 19,2009
For my needs, this baby is the perfect solution. My workplace uses a PC network. At home, I use a Macbook. I wanted a mobile workstation at work that I could bring home and finish tasks, etc.First, my overall impressions. After being used to the Macbook this machine seemed a bit thick. The battery sits under the LCD screen and makes the back side thicker and creates an wedge shaped effect. However, upon using the computer I found this creates a very ergonomic angle and I can work comfortably for hours! It slides easily into my briefcase, the extra 3.2 lbs is noticeable, but not bad. The fine ebony finish is nice, but any touch creates a fingerprint/smudge. The cloth included in the box does wipe them away pretty easily. I would have preferred the smooth aluminum that I am used to in the Macbook, but oh well... I could buy 5 of these for 1 Macbook, so I think I can deal with it!On to specificsThe screen is very bright with vivid colors, much better than I expected. I watched a Netflix instant movie, it was a bit grainy, but I am pretty sure it was due to a slow internet connection. Pictures are vivid and clear. There is very little glare off this screen, which I LOVE. I find the 10&quot; size to be quite adequate for internet and word processing, a bit small for spreadsheets. If you want a smaller unit, the 904h would probably be good, but the extra real estate to me was worth the extra $45.The mousepad/right/left click. The finger tracking is precise and smooth, but it does not smoothly scroll (internet) with the two-fingered drag like I am accustomed to with my Macbook; but overall it is fine. There seems to be some misunderstanding on how the right/left click works. First, I do all my single clicks and double clicks on the mousepad and it works great! To use the right/left click you need to press on the bevel and it is a firm click but quite easy. I use my thumb for this. I think if it was any easier you would have a lot of unintended clicks just by resting your hand there. So I think this is a design strength, not a liability.The keyboard; I was worried that the small keyboard would be hard to type on. Boy was I wrong! I actually type faster and with greater accuracy than I do on a full sized keyboard. The only flaw here is the right shift key. It should be where the page up arrow key is. So I employed a fix found on the 8.9&quot; 904h EEe review. I downloaded Windows framework 3.5 and Sharpkeys 2.1. Install Framework first, then Sharpkeys. Then you simply run Sharpkeys and re-assign the two keys. You can physically change the keys by prying them up from the LEFT edge until they pop off, then just push them in place and you are good to go.The overall speed is quite a bit better than expected. I did install the 2GB ram upgrade (buy this separately, Kingston, on Amazon for $22) , and so far haven&apos;t noticed much difference other than app&apos;s opening more quickly. It can&apos;t keep up with the Macbook (core 2 duo), but man, it amazes me how much computer I just got for the money. I haven&apos;t yet installed Quickbooks Pro, so I may update this later...The hard drive partition irked me. So I followed the advice from the aforementioned 904h review and downloaded eeasus partition manager. I didn&apos;t completely delete the D partition, but I reduced it to 20 Gb. Battery life. I am always using wifi. With my screen brightness at about 25% (and very adequate) I am getting 4.5 hrs. Not too bad, but not the 7hrs advertised.Lack of cd/dvd rom. No problem. I simply share the drive on a network computer at work and can load any programs/data/movies/music from that machine. Yes, a bit slower, but it was one less accessory I had to buy.I am 100% satisfied so far, after 10 days of use. I will add updates if necessary, but give this puppy 5 stars so far.

 Mini Notebook... Mini Price... Huge Convenience by Lindsay T. Irwin on Jan 8,2009
I bought my ASUS EEE pc about a week ago to replace a laptop that had some liquor spilled on it (I know...) and have yet to find anything to dislike. It is important to point out the buttons are easily pressed around the outside of the laptop. It doesn&apos;t come with a CD drive but I bought 24x USB External Slim CD-ROM Drive (Black) for a cheap drive to install Microsoft Office and run additional CD&apos;s that come along with my college textbooks. The drive plugs into one of the 3 USB ports and gets the job done. This notebook is perfect for students, such as myself, for easy transport to and from class. The SD slot is convenient for extra storage and for importing pictures. I don&apos;t believe the processing power is high enough to run online games like WoW or anything like that, but like I said... for kids and students, it&apos;s perfect for word processing, e-mail, MySpace, flash games... I have no complaints and so glad I bought this product!

 Good things come in small packages! by The Lawn Ranger on Dec 1,2008
I can only add a few things to the many good things already said.This is a sweet laptop. But if you are used to large screens - for instance I have a 24&quot; LCD monitor for my desktop, and a 17&quot; LCD screen on my (heavy! and large!) laptop, both with 1920x1200 pixels - the 1024x600 resolution will seem mighty cramped at first. I wish it were just a tad larger, say 1280x800, but...I&apos;d have to get a 12.1&quot; for that, and none seem to have the combination of features that this little jewel has. I am learning to pop up just one screen up at a time, and to maximize them. This has not proved to be a serious deficiency yet for business and programming use.The overall construction, fit and finish is great. The LCD screen although small is very viewable with much less fading out from an angle than many other laptops. The built-in camera and microphone work well (Oovoo is great for 3-way or more teleconferences). Sound quality is better than what you&apos;d expect for a netbook this size. The two-finger control for the pad for scrolling and re-sizing is very useful although I still pack a mouse. The buttons on the pad work well when one presses them from the front where your thumb naturally lies when using the pad, rather than trying to press them from above. And the misplacement of the shift key on the right is not an issue for me as I always have used only the left shift key. Battery life is consistently reported at near 5 hours, not the 7 hours they claim, but I have yet to try it out for even that long. Overall this is a great value for the money, if you can live with the small, limited resolution screen. I&apos;d buy it again in a heartbeat if anything happened to mine, but I wish they&apos;d make a just slightly larger 12.1&quot; version!

 This is a great Netbook! by R. Battaglia on Dec 25,2008
I just got this EEE PC as a Christmas present. I&apos;ve been doing a lot of research for about the past 3 months on these and this is the one that I settled on. I really wanted the 10&quot; screen and thats one reason I chose this over the Acer Aspire One. Another reason that I like this better is because it is incredibly easy to upgrade, unlike the Aspire One, which is nearly impossible and it voids the warranty on the Acer. Some people on here talk about how it is about a half pound or so heavier than almost all other netbooks. That is not an issue for me because it just makes it feel like its a lot sturdier. The mouse buttons are not hard for me to press like some other people have problems with. I think it might be because of the way they are using them. I think that the way they were designed was to be pressed on the sloped part of the button and not directly from the top. I actually find it easier to press on the sloped part with my thumbs. The keyboard is very easy to use. I&apos;m typing this review on it with very little trouble. The battery life is just as everyone says, about 5 hours or so. It runs surprisingly fast and boots up in about 30-45 seconds and thats running AVG (Free) antivirus software. One reason that it boots so quickly is because it doesn&apos;t come preloaded with a bunch of useless software. I transferred about 10GB of music and 2GB of photos and another 4GB of video and I still have a ton of room on the hard drive. The EEE PC runs video, music, virus scans, office, and iTunes with ease. I can&apos;t wait to get a 2GB memory upgrade for this. Another thing that I really liked was the look of it. I got the black one and I really think it looks sleek and stylish. When I saw the pictures on the internet I wasn&apos;t very impressed but now that I see it in person I&apos;m very satisfied with the way it looks. I would definitely recommend this for someone that is going to college, like myself. It is very portable and extremely functional. And it looks good too

 Fabulous machine! by Tom O. Ashwell &quot;Claw on Nov 28,2008
If you want a do-it-all package that is very portable, then get this machine. It is a must.I bought this machine because I needed a new laptop and wanted something that was very portable. I opted for the 10&quot; screen and the 6 cell battery because of recommendations from other reviews. I am not regretting the choices.This thing is fabulous! It does everything they claim and more. The size does not get in the way, and the keyboard is hardly smaller than normal so it is very easy to use. The screen is big enough, but I must confess when I go back to my 15&quot; Dell, I hear the theme from 2001 A Space Odyssey in my head. ;)Speed in booting is very good. Conectivity is very good too. It can automatically connect to any wifi it has been connected to in the past as it is in range. In other words, it can and does hand off to the strongest signal it can find as you move. A handy feature when you are a passenger in a car and there are lots of hotspots along the way. I bought an external antenna for use with my larger laptop and it worked well, however this mini-laptop has better ability to bring in the signals. Case in point: I am using a wifi signal that the other machine - external antenna and all - cannot even detect.As for the lack of bluetooth I use the USB device I have had for some time so no loss there over the other model. If I ever find I need wirelss N, I can get the external USB card too - so no worries.I thought I would miss a drive on this thing but so far I don&apos;t - surprisingly. Anything I need I transfer with an USB drive or download from the &apos;net and all is fine. (With the exception of not being able to play movies well, so far... I just need to find better playback software.)It works well with Skype and can multitask well. It is a good all-round portable machine.The SD card adapter is more convenient than I ever thought it would be. The USB ports are fast and handy as heck. I no longer have to bring a hub with me. It is virtually an all inclusive machine for me, just what I wanted, it has enough built-ins and ports to do everything I need on the go without lugging a rat&apos;s nest of add-ons.Now for the negatives;(I have to nit-pick to find any) I find it stutters a bit playing back movies recorded in AVI format. I suppose it must be the player software as my older, much slower machine plays them effortlessly. I&apos;ll post a comment if I find out what works for them. I watch Netflix movies on it daily, and that works beautifully! The idea is that I like to take DVD movies with me sometimes and without an internal DVD drive, I need to record them in digital memory to play them back on this machine. I have to find a good, smooth playing format, that won&apos;t eat-up the entire hard disk if I am going to do that. I simply hate jittery video. Also, the speakers are sometimes hard to hear with lower sound levels, but that is what headphones are for. Besides, what do you expect from tiny little speakers on a laptop? Well, these sound pretty good, just not all that loud sometimes (depending on source levels).Also, the disk drive shows two partions at 80g and 60g that does not add up to 160 so I am wondering. Nothing to be alarmed about there is plenty of space. Also, the screen is a little short: as in it has less vertical space than I would like. Too many bars on the web browser and you need to scroll down just to see anything. A minor annoyance, but I suppose one must compromise somewhere. The case (in ebony) is a fingerprint magnet. I don&apos;t mind, I just clean it a lot then. Also, the buttons on the mouse pad are a lot stiffer than any others I have ever used, but one can get used to it. As usual for me, there are too many features on the mouse pad and the keyboard: one fumble and you&apos;ve done something weird. I wish I could turn off a feature or two on that mouse pad, but that&apos;s just the way I look at things. I want it to do what I am telling it rather than what it thinks I want it to do.Conclusion:All in all I can&apos;t really fault the machine. I&apos;ve been using it for about a month now, every day, and it has never disappointed me. I&apos;ve never been able to say that before, in my 33 years of computer use. Hence the five stars.

 Great things come in a small package by T.D. on Dec 6,2008
This product has a lot of value. You really get a lot for your money. If you compare it on the basis of processor, memory, screen size, etc, you are really missing the point. What this thing does best is give you a relatively ample PC in a package that makes it much more usable than your typical laptop. It seems like laptops just keep getting bigger and bigger. Isn&apos;t the whole idea to have a PC &quot;in your lap&quot;. With this one you can do just that. The 9&quot; screen version is just too small though. The keyboard mainly, but the extra inch on the screen is huge. As much as I hate MS, I opted to not go with Linux version mainly because I wanted the white case.PROS:* Mainly it is the size. Very easy to tote around. Get a wireless mouse. I like the Logitech V220 ($27 @ WM)* The battery life is the big factor. With most laptops, you just get started on something and then its time to find an outlet. This one goes the distance. * It also has a great screen. Nice and bright.* Plenty of disk space. I suggest the HD over FLASH so you can load Office and also have plenty of room for pictures and music.* A keyboard that is easy to get used to being 95% of normal size.* Ergonomic layout is logical with all the blue function keys easy to figure out, not complicated, just what you need and nothing more.CONS:So far, not many. I use HOME and END a lot and on this machine you need to use the blue function key with them so it is a two step key process, but that&apos;s about it.ADVICE:* Get the 2 Gig RAM module, it makes it run faster for few $. It should appear on this page as an item people also bought.* Don&apos;t worry about not having a CD/DVD drive. Many SW companies let you get a trial version of their software. If you already own that SW, you can download it then just enter your product key and off you go. Otherwise, go to another PC and copy it to a flash drive. Most programs are not all that big considering how much FLASH space you get for your $ these days. MS Office S&amp;T 2003 full install was only 228Mb. Don&apos;t forget to open notepad and note your product key and just include it as a file on the FLASH. With 160Gb of disk space, I created a directory on the Eee C: drive called &quot;Install Disks&quot;, then a folder under that, for example, &quot;MS Office 2003&quot; and put that whole disk copy there including the &quot;_product key.txt&quot; file. HINT: Use the underscore in front of the name and it shows up at the top of the list and does not get lost in the shuffle. Oh, before you copy the files from the CD be sure to go the Tool-&gt; Folder Options and set it to &quot;Show hidden files and folders&quot;, select one file and do a CTRL-A to select every file, then drag and drop in the file you created on your FLASH drive.Sorry this got long-winded. Just trying to help and do my part.Great machine! You will love it.

 Brilliant Product by Richard Luxton on Jan 23,2009
This is an excellent second computer. Fast start up, solid build, bright screen, and a pleasure to use. As a previous reviewer pointed out use Key tweak to remap the shift button. This takes a couple of minutes to do with the free software and overcomes the one design problem the computer has. Everything else is brilliantly thought out. An excellent product.

 Awesome! by Joseph M. Viera on Jan 18,2009
I love this little thing! Actually, it&apos;s not that little, after all, since it has the 10&quot; screen, which is easy to work with. I could see myself using this netbook as a primary computer quite easily. It does everything I wanted it to do, and it&apos;s great fun to play with.My system came with Windows XP, which I like -- even though I&apos;m really a Mac person. I thought I&apos;d have trouble adjusting to Windows, but that&apos;s not been a problem at all.For the most part, I get at least 5 hours of battery life, despite the sticker near the trackpad that claims 7 hours of battery life. I&apos;m sure that if I were to change some of the settings, I could get that, but 5 hours is plenty of time when running on the battery.I did quite a bit of research before I decided upon the Asus Eee PC 1000 HA, and I&apos;m perfectly happy with my decision. Ideally, though, I would have wanted a Mac netbook, but since those do not exist I am happy to have found this little computer, which suits my needs. I even like the idea of having a Mac as well as a PC.The netbook is really fast, too, even though I&apos;ve just kept the standard 1gb RAM that came with the system. I&apos;ve thought about upgrading RAM, but I don&apos;t see the need for it. I guess that if it ever starts to slow down, then I may consider a RAM upgrade.I downloaded OpenOffice for an office suite, and I&apos;m very pleased with it. Now and then, though, I do use the MS Works suite that came installed. If I feel the need to upgrade to MS Office, then I think I&apos;ll need to find a CD/DVD drive for the install -- but I&apos;m not worried about that yet.Overall, I am thrilled with this netbook, and I recommend it without any reservations.*The only thing that I changed was the awkward right shift key, using Key Tweak (a free program download). It was easy to configure the keyboard to use the up arrow key to serve as the right shift key, allowing me to touch type easily. BTW, the keyboard size is fine for touch typing.

 2nd computer works like a charm by Daniel And Barbara S on Jan 17,2009
well this is the 2nd one I ordered, 1st one was defective, this one is perfect, added another 1gig of ram, put on games, mp3&apos;s, DVD movies and MPEG2 music videos, works perfect. stopped alot of the different processes, deleted some of the installed programs, added my own like AVG, Office 2003, firefox, audio and video codecs and this baby preforms really fast for what it is, using it right now to type this. no heating problems either, I have it on 4-10 hours at a time and it never slows down, battery life for this 6 cell on the average is 4 hours, can get 5 hours if you turn off the wifi. I can use the mouse pad but hate them so I got a wireless microsoft mini mouse that works great. very easy to setup and whats cool comes with a DVD that has all drivers and operating system on it, you can even format the drive blank, and this DVD will put it back just like it came out of the box.
