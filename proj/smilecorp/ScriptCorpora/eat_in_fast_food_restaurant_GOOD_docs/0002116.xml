View Full Version : After school jobs. 
 
 John Sullivan June,20th,2007, 04:17 PM I think we&apos;ve touched on this subject before but I thought it might be fun to create a thread to see where we had jobs after school.

So the question is, did you have an after school job and where was it.

Myself I had a few.

First I worked at Mc Donald&apos;s on North Garey for about 4 months. They were very strict and the pay was $1.40 an hour. It sucked big time because of the volume of business at those places. There were nights when I felt like I had personally served all of the Billions of burgers their sign said they had served. It was especially bad on Friday nights when the high school crowds would come in after football games. I went home smelling like a hamburger every night. I love burgers but that job almost cured me of that.http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f319/jfs495/Smiley%20heaven/cheeburga.gif

In fact, while I worked there Mc Donald&apos;s introduced their new product for the first time. The BIG MAC was it&apos;s name.

I&apos;ll save my other after school jobs for a little later in the thread if there is any interest. Anne Gutshall June,20th,2007, 05:48 PM I didn&apos;t work while in school but my first job about a month after grad was at Chunkie Grinder Time in Chino.It was run like a work program for middle eastern colledge students.I was informed when I first started that I was not going to be able to get above prep work cause the men college students wouldn&apos;t work for a woman.This was in 1988. Karla Holm June,20th,2007, 07:25 PM My first paying job was also at McDonalds on N. Garey. John, when you worked there, was Mike Alvarado the Mgr? I thought he was a really nice person to work for. I agree, after work, I would go home feeling dirty and smelling like a big greasy french fry. But one thing I have to say about the management at that particular store, they trained you well in customer service.

Back then you had to manually calculate the total cost of each customer&apos;s order and then look at the chart to add the tax. No computerized cash registers doing the work for us back then. I was pretty quick though cuz calculating 5% sales tax was easy to do off the top of your head without having to take the time to look up the answer each time.

Starting pay back then had just gone up to $1.65/hr. I remember one guy there had been working there since the minimum wage was 90-95 cents/hour. He had worked his way up to $1.65 and then when the minimun wage went up to that amount, they didn&apos;t up his salary for the difference. I always thought that was kind of crappy. I can&apos;t remember the exact year but I think I was in 11th grade (1971-2).

At the Christmas dinner party, we were each given a set of stainless steel carving knives. I thought that was really nice since most companies would have considered the dinner at the restaurant as your gift. And while I worked there, some lucky customer went home with a nice little gift in their bag...the new Seiko watch my brother had given me as a Christmas gift...and they never returned it. I had stuck my hand in the bag to lay a burger and fries inside and my watch clasp had opened up and fell off my arm. Hope they liked it. Much better than the gifts you get in a happy meal.

While I worked there, they had triple ripple ice cream cones (which they don&apos;t have anymore), shakes were handmade and there was talk of McDonalds starting to sell chicken products to be in competition with KFC. We all just kind of laughed...McDonald&apos;s? Selling chicken??? ha ha ha ...right!
That was my paying job, but during the same time period, I also volunteered at Pomona Valley Hospital as a Candy Striper. Did that for 3 years. John Sullivan June,20th,2007, 07:43 PM I honestly don&apos;t remember the managers name Karla. I&apos;ll have to agree that they did train well. There was no way you would get away with NOT saying thank you sir or yes mam, yes sir. All of us had to wear white button up shirts, black ties, black slacks and black leather shoes. Oh yes and of course those stupid paper hats.


We were not allowed to go next door to Taco Bell on our breaks unless we took off our shirts which had the Mc Donalds patch on the shoulders. You could eat all the food you wanted on your break, free but you could not wrap them in the paper wrapers or use the paper cups for our drink. You had to bring your own cup from home.

Yeah those were the days when you had to calculate the cost in your head or on paper and ring up the amount on the cash register. Then make change without the machine telling you how much to give back.

If your register was short in the hourly audit the difference came out of your paycheck.

Do you remember how slippery that floor got around the fryers? Yuk!!

I almost forgot.... There was no drive thru service back then.

Wow Anne, were they still that discriminatory toward women in 88. I guess the change came slower then I thought. Man by &apos;88 I had already gone through my first rehab and was drunk and loaded again. http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f319/jfs495/Smiley%20heaven/alcoholic.gif Tim Jones June,20th,2007, 08:30 PM I worked at the boat dock renting fishing boats at Puddingstone.
Then at the Big Burger, which was like In-n-Out. The owner had three stores, but In-n-Out beat him out.
Final job was at Gold Strike Market, with Kelly McFarlan and Mike Manzanares.

One of my other after school jobs was at The 5th Ave Market on Mission blvd. It was also called sailors Mkt for a while. I made a whole $1.25 an hour there. I did just about everything, box boy, stock clerk, janitor, the works. They did give me pretty good raises though. I progressed to the magic $2.00 and hour there.

Renting boats would have been a cool job. Anne Gutshall June,20th,2007, 09:51 PM Wow Anne, were they still that discriminatory toward women in 88. I guess the change came slower then I thought.

I could have probly gotten them in trouble.They were the only ones to call me back from the 25 applications I put out.So,I put up with it for awhile.:rolleyes: DavBan74 June,21st,2007, 12:16 AM My first after school job was at Sir George&apos;s Smorgasboard, just a couple of blocks south on Garey from the McDonald&apos;s (about 1 block south of the old Jenkin&apos;s Market, the Orange Julius and Shakey&apos;s Pizza). I remember when the Big Mac was introduced and the first one I had was at that North Garey Mickey D&apos;s. In High School (72-74) we lived on North Garey just south of all of that (I had to get permission from the district to keep going to Ganesha, because the address was in the Pomona HS district). I got really sick and was hospitalized for over a month right after I got the job at Sir George&apos;s so I had to quit. When I got back on my feet, I worked at&quot;the Candlelight Inn&quot;a little restaurant out on Holt between Sears and the&quot;welcome to Montclair&quot;sign. I think the minimum wage was $1.65, but I got less, because we shared tips with the servers.

Wow...you got free food? We didn&apos;t. We had to buy our own, but they didn&apos;t charge us tax. Whoopdee doo, huh? Buy a dollars worth of food and save a nickel. And we couldn&apos;t eat in the back. We had to go out front in the lobby to eat. I guess that gave the customers a false sense of security that if we were eating the food too, that it must not be all that bad...ha ha.

I remember how slippery the floor was around the fry vats. We had to wear white nurses shoes up at the counter and the bottoms got soooo slippery. I know I must have slipped on my rear at least once or twice until I learned to tread softly. As for the training part, there was a list of something like 10 things you were or weren&apos;t supposed to do and they were listed on a little yellow card. One of them was never to say&quot;Can I help you?&quot;. Instead you were supposed to say&quot;MAY I help you?&quot;

I worked at Tasty Freeze over on Mission right after graduation. Linda Rustler and Belinda Kendricks worked there too. Then I worked at the Fair over in the Fun Zone, in a handwriting analysis booth. It was owned by the same guys that ran that large booth right outside the Fun Zone. The owner was from the south and would always use descriptions like,&quot;I&apos;m more nervous than a long tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs.&quot;

I joined the Navy that October but didn&apos;t have to report till March. So after the holidays, I went back to work at McDonalds to earn money for clothes I was supposed to bring with me to boot camp. We had a whole list of specific stuff we had to buy and bring with us, which was really stupid cuz as soon as we got to boot camp, we had to put almost everything in storage or send it home. It never got worn.

When I went back to work at McDonalds, Mike wasn&apos;t the manager there. I helped open the store and then cooked breakfast. One of the girls that I made friends with while working there (from Upland High), she and I are still really good friends and have been for over 30 years.

That&apos;s odd about not eating in the back of Mc Donalds. We were told we had to eat in the back out of view of the customers. besides there was no place to sit out front the only tables there in those days were outside. I think there were two or three of them.


Dave, Not too many people seem to remember that Orange Julious in front of Shakey&apos;s for some reason. I wish it were still one. I just love that drink.


When I got back on my feet, I worked at&quot;the Candlelight Inn&quot;a little restaurant out on Holt between Sears and the&quot;welcome to Montclair&quot;sign.

Wow! the Candlelight Inn. I&apos;m trying to get a visual in my minds eye but just can&apos;t seem to recall what the place looked like. M_Turner June,21st,2007, 06:22 AM I also worked the McDonalds on Garey for about 6 months in 87. Then I moved to the Mcdonalds on Indian Hill. I only worked there for about 2 months. The manager there was a jack ass so me and 3 others quit in the middle of dinner rush. The min wage was like $4.35 or something back then. Shortly after graduation I worked at Boston, some clothing store, I think it was on Garey also. I only worked there for maybe 2 weeks though and then I moved to Fontana and joined the Navy.

That Micky D&apos;s on Garey has sure been there a long time. I first remember going there when I was like 10 years old or something. It&apos;s been remodeled several times and is still there today. At first it was an outside place, that is all the customers ordered from outside speaking through a window. There was no drive through, no inside seating, no breakfast menu and no children&apos;s play area. In fact Ronald Mc Donald hadn&apos;t been invented yet. They used to keep track of how many burgers they had sold on their outside sign. You could watch them change the numbers every once in a while.

3 million served, 4 million served. Now it just says Billions served.

Some of us guys would go there on a Saturday night and see how many cheese burgers we could each eat.http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f319/jfs495/Smiley%20heaven/cheeburga.gifhttp://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f319/jfs495/Smiley%20heaven/cheeburga.gifhttp://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f319/jfs495/Smiley%20heaven/cheeburga.gif


My third and last job was at a Union 76 station at Palomares and 4th street. I worked there primarily on weekends because my high school buddy had the job sewn up on week nights after school. I worked there daily after he joined the Navy for a few years after high school. The pay wasn&apos;t great, $2.50 an hour to start but I got a free tank of gas every week and a free oil change every 2 months. Of course I had to do it myself. He, Nick also bought lunch every day from places like Digangi&apos;s grinders, Tony&apos;s Delicatessen, KFC, Pomona Fish Market Tastee Freeze etc. After work the Budweiser long necks were on the house too. http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f319/jfs495/Smiley%20heaven/drinkin.gifhttp://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f319/jfs495/Smiley%20heaven/drinkin.gifhttp://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f319/jfs495/Smiley%20heaven/drinkin.gif John Sullivan June,21st,2007, 07:41 AM The Big Mac Jingle

John,
If you were driving on Holt Ave from Pomona toward Montclair, the Candlelight Inn was on the left hand side, just past the wash. It was a long, rectangular shaped place, low-rise and very un-remarkable from the outside. You could drive by and almost not see the place. The family that ran it were just great, and right out of a movie: Irrascible but lovable Granddad in the kitchen, Grandma running the waitresses, Son behind the bar and Son&apos;s Wife as the hostess. Really great food too. I remember that when I graduated from High School and got a&quot;real job&quot;they gave me a nice wristwatch as a grad/going away gift and when I went back to have dinner with my girlfriend (later wife), they bought us a couple of Prime Rib dinners and my money wasn&apos;t any good in the place. They were really nice.

Sounds like a great place to work. I sure remember the name but I don&apos;t recall ever being there. Karla Holm June,21st,2007, 10:47 AM http://www.soniafernanda.blogger.com.br/Big%20Mac.jpg


By the way, I&apos;ve never eaten one.

I&apos;ve only eaten a Big Mac once in my life and got sooooo sick, probably food poisoning. So I have been afraid to try one since.

When I worked at McDonald&apos;s we had to wear the white shirt that had the light blue V-shaped insert near the collar. I found this old McDonald&apos;s commercial from the early to mid 1970s (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKR1ScQUpcA) on You Tube. It was popular when I worked there and I can&apos;t tell you how many customers, thinking their humor was unique (smile), would come in and make comments asking why we didn&apos;t climb over the counter and sing. Some of us old-timers probably remember it.

I think I may have told this story somewhere on the boards, but not long after I started working there, a tall man with red hair and freckles came in and placed an order. When he went to pay for it, he handed me a check. The name on the check was Ronald McDonald. I thought it was some kind of joke, but our policy was to not accept checks, so I told him I was sorry but we weren&apos;t allowed to accept it. He got kind of pissy and asked to see the manager. The boss came out and started to apologize profusely and then later told me that his checks were an exception of the rule. Ends up he was a police officer that lived somewhere nearby. I couldn&apos;t help thinking what this poor guy must have gone thru. One day he is popular, probably a jock on the football team feeling confident about himself...and then one day, you are the butt of everyone&apos;s jokes...here is a goofy clown with your name, your red hair, big feet and a big red nose. Can anyone say&quot;years of therapy???&quot;

There were a few other early McDonalds commercials on You Tube...Here is one of them (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwb9W51j7fo&amp;mode=related&amp;search=). I don&apos;t ever remember these but the clown was before the Ronald we are familiar with today. He had blonde hair, wore a paper cup on his nose, one of those cardboard boxes (that holds a few drinks along with your bag of food) on his head, had a&quot;magic&quot;tray that would replace a burger as soon as you removed one, and he was REALLY clumsy. Wow, those could really have given that police officer a complex. No wonder he had a short fuse....ha ha

Also, just a bit of trivia, the actor that played Ronald on TV was named King Moody. One of our GHS alumni (class of 72, I believe) was married to him for awhile.

http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f319/jfs495/Smiley%20heaven/new_laugh.gif Yes I remember that ad. We did clean everything from top to bottom every night after closing. Every squre inch of stainless steel was scrubbed.

All the people appearing in that ad were much older then the actual pimple faced punks who work at Mc Donald&apos;s. You know , the ones dressed in baggy black pants hanging off their asses, oversized shirts and shoes that are untied.

Today you can barely find any employees ther that will say Thank You after your purchase. They never count your change to you anymore and most won&apos;t even tell you how much change they&apos;re handing you.

It&apos;s,&quot;have a good one&quot;as they slam the drive up window in your face. Half the time now the order is wrong, there are no napkins or straws in the bag and you have to ask for katsup through the closed door.

Things have changed a lot in customer service and not for the better. Karla Holm June,21st,2007, 11:36 AM Things have changed a lot in customer service and not for the better.

You know, it all has to do with management. When we lived in Woodinville, the service was terrible. One girl at the drive thru window stuck her arm out of the window with my order and didn&apos;t even look at me. She just continued to talk to one of her friends. I don&apos;t know how many times I wanted to just barely touch the bag so she would let go of her grip and the order would fall onto the ground. But, I just never had the nerve. Ends up that manager got canned and they got someone in who trained their staff better.

My son and I went to another one recently (and it was in a nice part of town too). It was late, after we went to see a movie and we went there because their drive-thru was open 24 hours. As my son and I drove thru to place our order, the person taking our order said&quot;Make it quick. I&apos;m being nice and taking your order even though we are about to close.&quot;So we placed our order but was confused since the sign above our head read&quot;drive thru window open 24 hours&quot;. After being told to hurry up and wait (since our vehicle didn&apos;t even move for about 5-10 minutes) and reflecting on how rude she was, my son just drove away (which you usually can&apos;t do because of that curb that forces you to stay in line...but this one didn&apos;t have one.) Instead we ended up going to Wendy&apos;s, where absolutely no one spoke English, I kid you not. My son asked for a courtesy cup so he could split up his drink. They held up a napkin. No, a small cup please. They held up a straw. I am not kidding, they couldn&apos;t speak enough English to even know what we were saying. But at least they were polite about it.

We have found that the fast food places in Jacksonville really suck at customer service. Probably one of the worst we have been to, but the McDonald&apos;s in Colville near where we live now, their management is awesome. That is how a fast food restaurant should be run.

We have found that the fast food places in Jacksonville really suck at customer service. Probably one of the worst we have been to, but the McDonald&apos;s in Colville near where we live now, their management is awesome. That is how a fast food restaurant should be run.


Back when I got out of the Navy in the Mid 90&apos;s I was an asst manager at a Jack in the Box in Port Orchard Washington. When I got there the customer service was bad and they all dressed sloppy and everything, I was surprised the place was opened. I started the same day as a new manager and we broke that place down. We had one of the best (and ecoli free) Jack in the Box&apos;s in the country. It is a sad shame that customer service has gone the way it has. Now I live in AZ and everywhere you go, excpet Sonic, is either no English, or just horrible customer service. Makes dieting sound much better.

I went to a&quot;Jack&quot;in Fontana last week where I actually had to point at the menu items to order. The worst part is that they looked at me like I was the problem. Other then that they were polite and courteous I think. Since I don&apos;t speak Spanish it was hard for me to tell. At least they were smiling.

Maybe next time I better take my passport to be sure I&apos;m allowed out of the city. Beryl_Gray June,22nd,2007, 01:43 PM Wow. Hmmm..

I was another paperboy for the Progress-Bulletin. I had a big old Schwinn with a spring-loaded front fork, coaster brakes, and wheels with motorcycle spokes. That thing weighed (and would carry) a ton. I now can&apos;t believe that my skinny legs could pedal it all over Pomona, much less all the papers I carried.

I got to be a dead shot throwing papers. I only had a couple of cranky old folks that insisted that I deliver the paper in the little hooks beneath their mailboxes (on their porches.)

I remember getting up at 3:00 am on Sundays to stuff the color inserts into the paper and fold them up. I remember riding in the rain with the papers in plastic bags. Man, that job drilled into you the importance of showing up every day, rain or shine.

I worked as a box boy at the Market Basket at the corner of Dudley and Holt. Had to join the union, paid my initiation and dues, then got laid off after a couple of months.

When I was a little older I had a (very temporary) job as a soda jerk for the Betsy Ross Ice Cream Parlor (was it on Foothill?). The only thing I remember were that a&quot;Paul Revere&quot;was a scoop each of chocolate and vanilla with a squirt of marshmallo sauce on the chocolate and chocolate sauce on the vanilla...

...But forever after I can brag that I am one of the few people who has been a jerk professionally.

My take on fast food came working at the Jack in the Box on Holt (and Garey? Towne?) when it was new. It was OK, until my friends found out where I was working. They would wait until I was working the window, then drive up to the ordering speaker and give long rambling orders, complain that we didn&apos;t serve as good of tacos as Taco Lindo, and generally make my working life as embarrassing as possible.

I quit Jack&apos;s when the clown costume arrived (this was before the current Jack who wears Armani and has a seriously hot wife) and, as the tallest person, I was picked to put on the costume and go stand in the street and wave at cars...

..I mean, I had some dignity left. noe242 June,22nd,2007, 02:27 PM My first job was working at the Baskin-Robbins on Garey and Alvarado, in front of the Stater Bros. market, and next to a fried chicken place that I believe was called&quot;Donoho&apos;s&quot;. Had a very fun time working there. Made one of my best friends there as well, Darin Farris, he graduated from Pomona High.
The worst thing that ever happened to me while working there was when the owner didn&apos;t tell us there would be a promotion for $1.99 banana splits running all weekend long. So I got to work and the young lady who was going to work with me complained that she felt sick, asked me if I&apos;d be ok on my own and I said that I would be. She leaves and then nightmare city!!!! Seems everyone responded to the ads and next thing I know, the entire place was packed full of people, all of them wanting banana splits. I ran out of bananas!! I lucked out when a former employee just happened to stop by and I asked him to run over to the Stater Bros. and get me&quot;ALL THE BANANAS YOU CAN CARRY!!!&quot;. He came back with 4 full bags and he began to assist me by peeling and slicing them. He truly saved me from certain disaster.
Later in the evening, the owner stopped by for his routine visit and the place was still packed, so he put his ice-cream scooping hat on and between all three of us we got everyone served.
Since that day I have never again told another co-worker it is ok for them to leave unless they already have their replacement on-site.

Sounds like she left you holding the bag noe. A bag with no bananas in it.

You must have been a site scoopin and collecting money and peeling bananas and scoopin and ............. Karla Holm June,22nd,2007, 03:36 PM Anyone remember when Heidi&apos;s Toy Store used to be the store to the south of Baskin Robbins? OK, I&apos;m old!

I remember going to B.R. one time after getting my new car. I bought an ice cream cone for my mom and one for myself...one in each hand (and both were double scoops). After I got in the car, I paused for a minute and then thought,&quot;Oh crud...I totally forgot about the stick shift.&quot;But I managed to jump that hurdle OK, even with a tall ice cream cone balanced in that hand. I made one left turn...an almost fatal error...and after having my top scoop smear down the window and almost fall off, I found a way that I could get home making only right turns which kept the cones intact. That was a bit of excitement! M_Turner June,22nd,2007, 03:58 PM Betsy Ross was my favorite place to go as a young kid..like 5 or 6 my mom would take me there and I would get bubble gum ice cream. I believe it was on Holt but I was so young that I could be wrong. At about that time I lived on Columbia right down the street from the B.R and Donahues Chicken. Damn its amazing I remember alot of this I havent been back in that area since grad...

I too used to just love Betsy Ross. The one we used to go to was on Holt. The building is still there and every time I pass I&apos;m reminded of the Valley Forge http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f319/jfs495/Smiley%20heaven/patriot.gifwhich was my favorite Ice cream dish.

My folks used to take us there when a special treat was in order. We used to eat dinner there too but I was always carefull to save room for my ice cream. noe242 June,22nd,2007, 04:31 PM Anyone remember when Heidi&apos;s Toy Store used to be the store to the south of Baskin Robbins?

That was a bit of excitement!

I&apos;ll tell you what my strangest memory from working at B.R. was... I went to work one cold and rainy day and I was going to be training a new hire. Since it was cold and rainy there were no customers. We were just chit-chatting and here comes the owner screaming, ranting and raving that we&apos;re ripping the shirt off his back, we don&apos;t get paid to talk, we get paid to work. So now we&apos;re cleaning up the floors, walls, everything... and finally I cleaned the windows. I cleaned those windows putting my very best effort to make them the cleanest they&apos;d ever been and so we finally finished. There was nothing else for us to clean... and then a car pulls up.
So I thought I make the new girl laugh by pretending to be angry with the fact that we were going to have a customer. So I started to bad-mouth the lady as she finished parking her car and started to get out of her car and go out in the rain. And so I start to say,&quot;I hope you get out of your car and run with your head down to avoid the rain and slam your head on my super clean glass door and be so embarassed that you just turn around, run back to the car and get the hell out of here and leaves us alone!!!!!&quot;

The new girl was laughing at me and then it happened. EXACTLY as I had said it... detail by detail. The new girl&apos;s laughter turned to shock when she heard that lady&apos;s noggin slam on the glass door and then she jumped off the counter and ran away from me when she saw the lady run back to her car and drive off.

I felt like absolute dirt because I really didn&apos;t want the lady to get hurt. And the new girl never came back after that shift.

:eek: Debbie Huffman June,23rd,2007, 05:24 PM My first job was at the corner of Towne and Holt&quot;Pail O&apos;Chicken&quot;, worked there with Jim Holmon. I made $1.45 an hour plus tips. It was great when a Pro football team came in. I got a $50.00 tip, I was rich. Then I workedon Mission and Palomares&quot;Taco Bell&quot;, everyone liked that because I gave away free food.

Hey I remember Pail O&apos; Chicken. Long time since I heard of that place. Charles McDonald July,25th,2007, 03:07 PM I&apos;ve only eaten a Big Mac once in my life and got sooooo sick, probably food poisoning. So I have been afraid to try one since.

When I worked at McDonald&apos;s we had to wear the white shirt that had the light blue V-shaped insert near the collar. I found this old McDonald&apos;s commercial from the early to mid 1970s (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKR1ScQUpcA) on You Tube. It was popular when I worked there and I can&apos;t tell you how many customers, thinking their humor was unique (smile), would come in and make comments asking why we didn&apos;t climb over the counter and sing. Some of us old-timers probably remember it.

I think I may have told this story somewhere on the boards, but not long after I started working there, a tall man with red hair and freckles came in and placed an order. When he went to pay for it, he handed me a check. The name on the check was Ronald McDonald. I thought it was some kind of joke, but our policy was to not accept checks, so I told him I was sorry but we weren&apos;t allowed to accept it. He got kind of pissy and asked to see the manager. The boss came out and started to apologize profusely and then later told me that his checks were an exception of the rule. Ends up he was a police officer that lived somewhere nearby. I couldn&apos;t help thinking what this poor guy must have gone thru. One day he is popular, probably a jock on the football team feeling confident about himself...and then one day, you are the butt of everyone&apos;s jokes...here is a goofy clown with your name, your red hair, big feet and a big red nose. Can anyone say&quot;years of therapy???&quot;

There were a few other early McDonalds commercials on You Tube...Here is one of them (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwb9W51j7fo&amp;mode=related&amp;search=). I don&apos;t ever remember these but the clown was before the Ronald we are familiar with today. He had blonde hair, wore a paper cup on his nose, one of those cardboard boxes (that holds a few drinks along with your bag of food) on his head, had a&quot;magic&quot;tray that would replace a burger as soon as you removed one, and he was REALLY clumsy. Wow, those could really have given that police officer a complex. No wonder he had a short fuse....ha ha

Also, just a bit of trivia, the actor that played Ronald on TV was named King Moody. One of our GHS alumni (class of 72, I believe) was married to him for awhile.
When I joined the world of TV commercial production in 1974, one of my earliest jobs was to chauffeur King Moody to the set of the McDonald&apos;s commercials we were filming.

He was a really great guy - very polite and interested in what I was doing
as well as offering support for my Trancendental Meditation practice that I
told him about (&quot;You&apos;re going to find that it&apos;s a really positive thing for you&quot;) etc. He was looking forward to travelling to Europe to appear in some independent theatre production that was doing Eugene O&apos;Neill plays
and such.

I Google searched him recently and was sorry to see that he had passed away. Here&apos;s to a guy who worked with his gifts and went further toward studying his acting craft. DebbieOlson August,17th,2007, 07:14 AM My father would not allow me to work while I was in school. He was afraid I would not have time to tend to my studies. So to make money I babysat, did laundry for my mother&apos;s &apos;old people&apos; (she took care of 6 elderly in their homes and couldn&apos;t always do for themselves), and ironed shirts for my dad&apos;s bosses. It turned out I stayed so busy I still had to do my homework during breakfast. The babysitting jobs were so back to back there were many times I didn&apos;t see my dad for weeks at a time.
