 Phillip of Waterloo, AL on July 11, 2012 Satisfaction Rating 2/5 
After being told that due to a recent technician visit, I would not be charged for another technician visit to reset my Hughes Net dish, when I received my monthly charge card statement related to my account, I found out different. I contacted (attempted to) Hughes Net. After two, that is correct, two hung-up telephone calls by their associates, I finally was able to get the issue resolved. However, my findings indicated that someone in the Philippine islands, without my authorization, used my Amex charge card and charged the technician&apos;s visit fee to my card. This was after I was told it would be free.

When I called the first associate, she told me I would be charged at 100% of the visit&apos;s charge. I asked her to check her records. She put me on hold, then she came back and found that her records indicated that they had agreed to only 50% of the visit&apos;s charge. I asked her to recheck her records. She put me on hold, then she came back and stuck to her story. I asked to speak to her supervisor. After a five-minute hold, she came back and said her supervisor was unavailable. Then, I asked her for her ID number or her last name. She said she could not give it to me. After this, I told her I needed to speak to her supervisor or I would be calling the corporate office. She put me on hold, then she came back and said she would be issuing me the full credit.

As I was typing this information into my computer, I asked her to repeat it, so I could make sure it was correct. I also told her I was recording the call for my records (I really wasn&apos;t, though I told her they were recording it from their end.). She said if I didn&apos;t turn off the recorder, she would terminate the call. I kept typing, and when I finished, I repeated back the information and asked her if it was correct. She again asked me to cut off the recorder or she would terminate the call, refusing to validate what she had said.

I was able in the beginning to get only her first name (May) and where she was located (the Philippines). After this dialogue, I then told her thank you and to have a good day; then I hung up. Later, after I called what I thought was the listed Hughes Net in the yellow pages (Actually, it is a nationally syndicated brokerage company selling all internet providers.), they transferred me to Hughes Net (the Philippines), where I actually was hung up on by their associates twice when I asked for their ID number or last name.

Ultimately, I was able to get in contact with a Hughes Net associate, Wendy, in Galveston, Texas who was able to go over the actually detailed dialogue that I did have with Hughes Net in the beginning, which stated that I was to have in fact receive the free technician&apos;s visit in the first place. After she verified, although she also would not give me her ID number or last name but did give me the transaction number of the case, I then told her I would be pursuing this because it was credit card fraud. Someone in the Philippines must be pocketing money either with or without the knowledge of Hughes Net. Regardless, this must be checked into and stopped.

Hughes Net is a horribly slow service. Service is frequently down due to satellite outages. I had to have our modem replaced twice. I upgraded our service to fastest possible and saw no difference. I switched to a new wireless broadband service in the area and speeds doubled. I called to have the service canceled. I had to call two different numbers, then had to talk to two different operators. The account manager refused to cancel service until she spoke to my husband (who was not home). My name is also on the account and they gave me no trouble upgrading. Payments come from my account. Due to the delay, I had another payment deducted from my account. I am waiting to see what legal steps I will have to take to get my money back. Do not choose Hughes Net if you have another service available.

 Alexander of Colorado Springs, CO on July 6, 2012 Satisfaction Rating 1/5 
HughesNet has been the worst, most frustrating, crud riddled scam I&apos;ve ever had to deal with. First and foremost, their service is entirely garbage. I upgraded to the fastest plan possible after three months and saw absolutely no difference. Horrible, slow, inconsistent, interrupted signals. I paid the optional monthly &quot;repair&quot; charge in case a tech needs to come fix something. I needed the tech to come and they charged me an extra $130 which my monthly payment didn&apos;t cover because this was a &quot;special customer-generated repair call.&quot;

I only needed the service temporarily until I moved again to a city. When I signed up over the phone (first red flag), I was ensured it would be month to month billing. When I called to cancel 6 months later, they told me I had 20 months left on my two-year contract. There was never any paperwork (second red flag) to ensure I had a month-to-month deal. We eventually decided to just eat the cancellation fee which we were told on the phone and in email it would be $355. The next charge on our statement was for $512. Customer service can&apos;t tell me why because they don&apos;t speak English, or know what they&apos;re doing (third red flag).

I also was the one who had to climb on my roof to take down their equipment and send their equipment back to them, or they would add another $130 charge if I didn&apos;t climb around doing their job. Do not offer these scum merchants any of your hard earned money.

 Quinn of Uvalda, GA on July 5, 2012 Satisfaction Rating 1/5 
We got HughesNet a year and a half ago. The service is very slow and unreliable. I used to have dial-up and this is just as slow, though the commercial makes it sound like it&apos;s the best. Sometimes I lose connection altogether about 10 times a day and have to do a manual reset. I called service many times, and half of the time is wasted on the phone due to the non-American people either not understanding me or me not understanding them.

Keep in mind that we have been with them exactly a year and a half with a 2-year contract. We called up to see when our contract ends, and they said 8 months! That&apos;s two years and 2 months. I called them, well, the non-American &quot;service&quot;, and complained about how slow it was. They tested the modem and said it was fine and that our router was bad. Well, the new one didn&apos;t work any faster. Then, they said it was my computer that made it slow. Computer? Yea, well, when you include all four of them, 7 Xbox 360s, and a PS3, I really doubt it&apos;s my computer since they all connect to the modem or router.

No matter if I connect my device to the router via WiFi device, wired, or wired to the modem, it&apos;s the same speed. Sometimes it takes (the worst it&apos;s gotten) 9 hours to download a 3MB song! That&apos;s pretty worthless, dial-up was faster than that. I live out in the woods so this is all I could get. But for a gamer? No, though I would expect I could at least play a little but I can&apos;t even find any players. Oh, and I really like how they didn&apos;t tell us we had a certain amount of usage per day. This is unacceptable! We got the lowest package at first and I couldn&apos;t find any players to connect to, so we upgraded. We eventually went up to the highest, and still no change at all. Our cellphone internet is even faster than this. This is ridiculous! I don&apos;t know what to get: this or dial-up? I really don&apos;t think it&apos;ll make a difference.

The last complaint I have (but not all problems are described here) is the billing. We paid our bill (unfortunately) and all of a sudden when we went to go to a web page, it said that our bill hadn&apos;t been processed and said to &quot;click here&quot; so we could sign in and pay. Well, I called the &quot;service&quot; and they said it was just a reminder to pay our bill, even though every page I went to had this message and it wouldn&apos;t let me to the site I was going to.

I brought up 20 tabs and all displayed this message. Yea, this service is definitely the best way to go in this advancing world, if you want to support the agreement of going back to caveman days. I understand this is not DSL and not that fast, but, come on, now that Dish out there, it&apos;s only worth frying an egg on a hot summer day, or using for target practice.

I typed this using HughesNet. Let&apos;s see if it actually goes through because it times out 70% of the time. Oh and want to stay connected? Forget about it, this &quot;service&quot; loses connection and says webpage not found, or gives some kind of error almost every page you go to, every day. Thinking about getting this Internet? No you don&apos;t want to use Hobo&apos;s Internet Service. Well, actually, I think even a hobo has enough sense not to get it. We used to pay $20 for great internet, now we pay over a hundred for this.

I used Hughes Net as my internet provider. It was very slow. After making several attempts to get a service tech and could not, I decided to pay my contract out and cancel my service. I paid out, returned the equipment and am still getting billed. I have spent hours and hours on the phone, sent copies of return. They continued to bill me so I had to cancel my credit card after disputing the charges several times. It is now almost July and I am still having to deal with this. This has been by far the worst experience I have ever had from a service provider. I cannot imagine how such a dysfunctional place can still be in business. Do not use Hughes Net!

 Susan of Luthersville, GA on June 23, 2012 Satisfaction Rating 2/5 
We paid the extra for satellite because we live in the country. We were thinking if we paid $70 a month, we should be able to use all we want; that is not the way it works with HughesNet. I would like to get a smart TV, but I don&apos;t have internet service smart enough to let me use it. I could never use streaming Netflix with HughesNet. Netflix is cheap enough, but HughesNet would cost me a fortune. My granddaughter is looking to buy another car and can&apos;t even check out the websites because the pictures use up all the time. I don&apos;t know the point of having the service if you can&apos;t use it. You notice also with all these complaints, the company could come on here and dispute, but they don&apos;t because they can&apos;t. The technical support is only from India and you can&apos;t understand any of them. I don&apos;t even call anymore. I just wait for the problems to resolve themselves, which they usually do after a while. They don&apos;t warrant their equipment nor do they repair it either without charging you an arm and a leg.

 Rhonda of gladstone, ND on June 21, 2012 Satisfaction Rating 2/5 
We got internet service with HughesNet a few months ago when we were unable to transfer our service with another company due to the fact we lived too far out of town in a rural area. When we sign on, they never told us about megabytes per day. We have three computers and a game system that is on all the time. They said we shouldn&apos;t have any issues. It&apos;s a lie! You have to call them everyday to receive a token so they can speed up your service. They slow you down so bad you cannot even check emails. I have never once talked to an American. We have the best service at $180/month and I cannot make it past a few hours on Facebook. Do not sign up with them! If you want to watch megabytes, go with Verizon.

 Kim of Hilmar, CA on June 20, 2012 Satisfaction Rating 1/5 
I signed up with Hughes Net just to save money and ended up paying more than my last internet service. It started out at $39 a month for 3 months and I had to move up to the $79 pkg a month because we went over our allowance they said would be enough. Even then, they &quot;forgot&quot; to attach my $10 a month discount for 3 months after we upgraded. I am so angry and disappointed with this service. Why doesn&apos;t the government step in and rein in these liars and make them pay up to their word? I have 2 years to go and so much more money to lose.

 Jeff of Ms, ms on June 13, 2012 Satisfaction Rating 1/5 
I have been a Hughes Net customer for over 10 years. This company used to be one of the best, but over the past 6 years, has gradually become the worst company I have ever had the unpleasant opportunity of dealing with. You will never talk with anyone in the USA no matter what you ask for with the exception of new service, and this is a nasty trap of course. They are a deceiving, ruthless, dishonest business. They have made a ton of money from people like myself who just did not have another choice, but I am changing to Wild Blue. I think I read somewhere that the US government gives Hughes grants. This is horrible to think our money is going to the pockets of executives, while they job out all of the work to other countries while our citizens go without jobs.

I am sick of Hughes, they are losing business by the tons and bunches. Read the reviews, it is no wonder! I have paid them close to $8,000.00 in the past 11 years. What a waste. My service was not much better than dial up and I did not realize it until I bought another house and got a different service. They should be ashamed for scamming us all these years.

 Romeo of Dearborn , MI on June 12, 2012 Satisfaction Rating 2/5 
HughesNet is the worst. I recently moved from another state and called them for service. I wish I didn&apos;t. Terrible service, scammers, they create forms and &quot;contracts&quot; without informing you or telling you about half of the stuff. They overcharge for everything. Nothing they tell you is the truth. The internet kept and actually is still randomly becomes unavailable. A week later, I called to cancel the service and they told me it is going to cost me $350.00 for early cancellation fees. I asked them when my contract expired. They said in a year. Well today it reached a year, so I called to cancel and they told me it was renewed for 14 months. LOL, it is really not funny! But my advice, do not get HughesNet.

 Sandra of Enterprise, KS on June 10, 2012 Satisfaction Rating 2/5 
Unreal how fast the download allowance is used so quickly while playing games on the internet. I have had to use 5 tokens within less than a week at $7.50 per token. Plus my $70+ a month fee for using the basic service for nearly 3 years. I will be changing on the 26th of June to a new service, which offers half the price and no download limits so I will be very happy with this change - only $20.00 a month for the first year and then to $30.00 after that. Not bad. Speed is as good, if not better, and no drop down to crawling speed while surfing the internet. I am not at all happy with Hughes despite their efforts to cut $20.00 off my bill each month for the next 6 months while they are putting up another satellite, which will rip more people off.

They tell you the service will be improved, but that will have to be proven before I&apos;ll go back to their service. I will have a modem and dish available for sale after they stop the service. So if interested, email me at ** should you be interested in purchasing. Goodbye Hughes, hello Eagle Support. I had no choice in internet service before, but now I do. So I am getting rid of the bad and hopefully, getting something much better. I pay all that money and still come over to my daughter, one block away, to play my games along with her and her two children with no problems whatsoever.

 Linda of Wallis, TX on June 5, 2012 Satisfaction Rating 1/5 
When we moved to Wallis, we thought the only high speed service available was HughesNet. We subscribed. It has been nothing but trouble. And when we had trouble and called, we got India and no help. When they couldn&apos;t help, they referred us to another company who tried to convince us to let them take control of our computer and sell us products to &quot;clean up the problem&quot;. We terminated and called them to pick up their equipment. They sent a box and we returned it. Now, we are getting harassing calls from their collections department. We are refusing to pay but the daily calls continue. I think we will have to sue them.

The service was slow but I put up with it. The customer service, if you can call it even that, was worse than the connection. It was too overpriced for the service provided. Last week, I called and disconnected my service. It took 1 hour and 15 minutes to have someone cancel my service and then they told me I have to return the equipment. I told them I bought it at the time they installed it. They told me no and if I didn&apos;t return it, I would be charged another $300. They sent the box to return the equipment. What&apos;s missing is the tool to disassemble the radio. I am printing everything I can find to stuff into the returned equipment box on how horrible HughesNet is. Do not use this service. You will regret it.

 CE of Kansas City, MO on June 1, 2012 Satisfaction Rating 1/5 
We moved to a rural area 25 miles outside KC in 1995. The local phone service was very bad so we thought HughesNet would be a good alternative. Wrong, wrong, wrong. In the 10 years we had Hughes(no-)Net, here are just a few of our problems: 1) No, and I mean no customer service. If you complain they will just hang up after you&apos;re on hold for 30 minutes; 2) No customer service reps can speak English. Customer Service is located in India; 3) In 10 years, we had our equipment upgraded once after threat to terminate our service; 4) Download times were slower than dial-up. I can&apos;t tell you the hundreds of dollars we spent buying &quot;download tokens&quot; after using up our small daily download allowance. HughesNet wants you to buy their more expensive packages&amp;you will still have to buy tokens. Their daily download allowance limits suck.

Slow, slow, slow! Don&apos;t let their flashy advertising fool you. When you shoot a signal 15 to 20 miles down from a satellite, it won&apos;t be real fast. Sometimes it seemed like 30 seconds. Minimum delay would be 10 to 15 seconds. Forget Magic Jack, Skype, WebCam now. **, during the delay, you can grow hair. In conclusion, HughesNet is a last resort. If you have any other choice, use it. Avoid HughesNet at all cost. Read their reviews; 83 % of customers rate them &quot;one star&quot;. One star, that is pathetic. No other company has such low ratings. HughesNet sucks to the sky they shoot signal from. String and can is high-tech to HughesNet. Avoid this company at all cost.

 Valentina of Sonora, CA on May 28, 2012 Satisfaction Rating 1/5 
We previously had a fast speed internet that went out of business when we were recommended Hughes Net. We have had nothing but problems with them and when you call for technical support, you are transferred to either the Philippines or India. Now trying to understand them is a whole different ball game and they give you the same runaround every time you call. Our download allowance got depleted again to zero when we were not at home. Calling them, we just got told there is a hacker hacking into our NetGear router. I called NetGear and had to pay $70.00 just to get a new password in case there was a hacker. Now a month later, our download allowance is zero again and Hughes Net told me the same sad song that we were hacked into. Horrible, horrible internet! The speed is slower than dial-up and I would never ever recommend this shoddy internet service to anyone. The fella in the Philippines now told us that when we leave the house, we are to unplug the cord from their box. Are you serious? I hate Hughes Net!

 John of Nashville, IN on May 26, 2012 Satisfaction Rating 1/5 
I have been a customer for three years now, because there are no other options in our area. My overall impression is that upload and download speeds are very slow. It took 36 minutes to download a song from iTunes. Most times, I can&apos;t even listen to a song or watch a YouTube video. The last program I downloaded was at 25Kbs. I might be wrong, but that is slower than dial-up.

The tech support is a joke. They take you to a site and run a test that always comes up with some number under something, and they say &quot;That&apos;s okay.&quot; I don&apos;t care what the number says. (They won&apos;t tell what it means.) All I know is everything is damn slow and for $70 a month! These folks are criminals. The other thing I hate is tech support in India. I love all peoples, except Hughes&apos; people and have nothing but good to say about the Indian people. But I cannot understand what they are saying. It&apos;s me, I&apos;m sure. But they should have an option to speak with someone without an accent. Get Hughes only as a last resort.

Starting from day one, the receiver box drops to a red light or just shuts off. We online school and without DSL available in our area, we are paying $119 a month for crappy internet! I called and they transferred me to another country where I can&apos;t understand them half the time. I answered all the same questions. Yes, it&apos;s on a flat service; no, nothing else is in the outlet; yes, I&apos;ve tried other outlets; no, it&apos;s not cloudy. Then they put me on hold at least 3 times to talk to a manager. They then asked me the same questions! After the 3rd time, I got disconnected. After 2+ hours of this, I gave up only to have it happen the next time I call! I&apos;m stuck in this contract they won&apos;t let me out of, and now 7 weeks behind in school because I can&apos;t get online! Mad! Frustrated!

 Joyce of Camdenton, MO on May 19, 2012 Satisfaction Rating 1/5 
I had Hughes Net for 2 years, almost the end of my contract. I always had to pay more than what my base plan was due to buying restore tokens, but it was manageable and the price you have to pay to use the internet in a rural area where you have no choice. Then without warning, I got a bill for $400.00 and some dollars. I tried to speak with them on the phone about the problem - &quot;Why was my bill so high and it showed lots of restore tokens we hadn&apos;t requested?&quot; They insisted we had. While I was trying to get this resolved, I got the next bill for $800.00 plus. They kept telling me we had to authorize the tokens to be charged for them. I argued that we would have been having to purchase them every few minutes to have so many.

Our bill was up to $1,500.00 plus when I finally told them in panic to stop the service and get it off my computer. This is crazy. They wanted to offer me $20.00 per month for a year off my bill. I said that didn&apos;t come close to resolving the problem. So I no longer have internet and they tried to bill my account for the money they say we owe. I had to close my bank account to be sure they can&apos;t charge me that amazingly crazy amount for three months of service. The service for a while was okay, I don&apos;t say great, but okay since we have no other choices. I don&apos;t know what happened, but watch out for those tokens!

I paid a fee to cancel my account with HughesNet when my husband lost his job and I had to relocate to a different state. I was told that I did not need to return the radio that is on top of the house that they installed. I returned all other equipment. Now, I am a 25-hour drive away from the radio, and they are telling me that they are going to send me to collections if I do not pay $211 for the radio. This is an expensive service, which promises fast service, which is not fast at all. On top of my complete dissatisfaction, when I called to talk to someone, I spoke to the supervisor who is Sunil **, who is not an American citizen. He refused to give me the name of his boss. Unbelievable! And we wonder why so many people in America are unemployed.

Hughes Network installed in 2011. The dish on the roof was installed and the tech must have put it in the wrong place. It was moved and reinstalled. All the holes where it was first placed were never caulked. Therefore, I had a roof leak (2012) due to this Hughes&apos; error. I now have a water stain on my kitchen ceiling. There are also screws holding down the cable and none of them are caulked. This is very poor and careless workmanship, extremely disappointed with Hughes.

 Cary of Galax, VA on April 22, 2012 Satisfaction Rating 1/5 
When I moved to a rural area in Virginia in August 2010, I had no other broadband option other than Hughes Net. In order to get enough bandwidth to squeak by in my work-from-home situation, I signed up for their $190/month &quot;up to&quot; 3Mbit download plan. This was the 2nd highest plan they offered. Speedtest.net tests in the first few months averaged more than 2Mbit download speeds. At 6 months, results average to 0.8Mbit. At 10 months the average was 0.45Mbit and has never improved. Hughes Net only accepts their own speed test results and of course they always claim there is no problem.

It takes about an hour to complete a service call with Hughes Net to get them to check the performance so of course, who is going to repeatedly waste their time making a lot of calls? I checked their plan offerings as of April 2012 and was surprised to see the top plan offered is now a 2Mbit plan for $110/month. I chatted with Hughes Net and asked for a credit of $80 for every month I have paid that much more than their top speed plan. I was only offered $20/month for 12 future months. Since DSL had just become available, I suspended Hughes Net and plan to contest any contract cancellation fees. I now pay $30/month for 1.5Mbit verifiable service.

I have, from day one of installation, told Hughes Customer Service that I am retired and get my check on the 3rd of each month. They constantly try to get funds before the 3rd, then last month they took, according to my bank statement, 2 payments of $72.04 on the 3rd and again on the 21st. I have called every month and they just don&apos;t get it. Again I am retired and I only get my check on the 3rd!

When they attempted to withdraw from my account early and it was returned back, they started blocking my service (partially). They have interrupted many communications of an important nature and caused a lot of misery for me for no reason. Their phone personnel have been rude and argumentative. I always pay my bill, and I do like their service. It is probably the best internet service I&apos;ve ever had in the last 15 years! But I get the feeling they are bullies. I am 69 years old, disabled and retired. I want them to please get this straightened out. Thank you!

I have been a Hughes Network customer for two years (I live very rural.). The speeds were never high speed, but they were faster than dial-up, until now. About a month ago, I noticed that things were even slower than normal. I called customer care, and after running various tests, I was told the problem was on their end. After calling customer care numerous (10+) times within the month (because they stated they would call back to update but never did), I got with tier 4 staff (Be prepared to run a comparison with these people and the inhabitants of Stratus (of Star Trek Fame) and there was no problem. I got transferred back to tiers 1 and 3, and they stated it was their problem. Well, you get the general idea.

If you can avoid these Hughes Network, please do. The picture is this. Hughes Network promises speeds up to 1.0 Mbps for $59 99 a month. That speed will be reached, if the amount of people on your cell (group of people accessing the internet through that particular spot on the satellite) does not exceed a certain amount. When the cell amount is maximized, new customers are supposed to be routed to a different (less populated cell). But in today&apos;s economy, why honor their commitment to the customer when they can squeeze more people on an already overloaded network instead of opening a new/different cell?

If it&apos;s easier to explain, the price of canned tuna is the same over the past years. It&apos;s just the size of the can that got smaller. People express their dissatisfaction with the big government. Well, here&apos;s an example of big business. They just don&apos;t care. Never give them an auto payment credit card; they cannot make you pay for what they did not give you. It`s called reverse theft of services.

We bought all of our equipment when we first signed up and got Hughes in 2005, over $500.00 for the Sat and modem. First of all, we had to upgrade a few years ago to a business account and pay them $69.99 a month for our poor service. Then, we were gone on vacation and came home and we exceeded our download limit. What? We were not home.

In the past few months, we have been losing service and slow service. When we called and complained to them, they said they will credit our account for 1/2 the cost because they was having Sat issues, a sun burst. Yeah right.

Now up to date, we were still having slow and getting disconnected, unreliable service. So they said, the Sat we have is outdated so we will need to update all our equipment. There will be a $10 a month rental fee. We told them why we should pay a rental fee when it is at their end and our equipment is still good. They said they will not charge us the rental fee and they will give us a full month credit. When we got our bill, we were charged $117.00.

Well, here goes another 2 hours on the phone with them trying to get this straight. I have about 10 reference numbers ok, so then she said, &quot;I will credit you $130.00.&quot; Well, this is yet to be seen and needless to say, we are out looking for new service and we will be telling them to go jump in a lake. I will be canceling my credit card so they cannot charge me and steal money out of our account. That is stealing when they say and charge you for bogus items. They should be shut down.
