Payday used to be a big hassle for Lisa Schwingdorf, a crew member at a Checkers Drive-In restaurant in Clearwater, Fla.

She&apos;d go to the restaurant on Thursday afternoons when general manager Rich Hessner passed out paychecks, and then she&apos;d pick up her two children at school and dash to cash her check so that she could go grocery shopping.

Now Schwingdorf, who has Thursdays off, doesn&apos;t have to bother with going in to work or with standing in lines -- unless there is one at the automatic teller machine.

Checkers electronically down-loads her weekly salary on a card that she keeps with her. She can withdraw her pay from any ATM n town and shop at her leisure.

&quot;I was always rushing,&quot; Schwingdorf said. &quot;At the bank you had to stand in one place for customers who don&apos;t have an account there. It was a pain in the neck, standing in that long line with two kids.&quot;

Clearwater, Fla.-based Checkers Drive-In Restaurants went paperless with its pay system earlier this year. It is one of the first restaurant companies to forge ahead with payroll cards, a payment method that has been gaining momentum over the past six months for its time-saving benefits to employees and its cost-saving benefits to employers.

Banks, credit-card companies and technology firms have been partnering to develop electronic financial services, such as payroll cards, to serve dents better. With payroll cards an employer can deposit electronically an employee&apos;s salary on a card that is issued to the employee. The employees then can access their pay at an ATM, avoiding lines at banks and fees at check-cashing stores.

With paperless pay, employees no longer are clamoring to get off work early on payday to go cash their checks, said Hessner, Schwingdorfs general manager.
 
&quot;It makes life easier,&quot; he said.

Paperless pay is attracting retailers, such as Sears, Roebuck and Co., and hoteliers, such as Choice Hotels International. And it&apos;s gaining attention in the restaurant industry as operators look for ways to save costs and create a benefit for their employees, especially those who do not have checking or savings accounts.

About 20 percent of the nation&apos;s workforce is &quot;unbanked.&quot; The federal government estimates that about 22 million American families have no relationship with a bank. Most of those households have an annual income of less than $25,000 a year. Some cannot afford the fees and minimum balances to maintain checking accounts.

Atlanta-based AFC Enterprises is considering proposals from companies to provide a paperless pay system. The company likely would pilot it at some stores before rolling out something systemwide, said Margaret Clark, AFC&apos;s vice president of people services.

&quot;One of the things we work Very diligently to do is bring as much value as possible to our hourly staff, in our restaurants, bak-eries and cafes,&quot; Clark said. &quot;Their experience is terrbile. For many of them they have to pay a conside able amount to cash their check. We hope to provide something to circumvent not only the red tape and logistics but also spending additional amounts to get their checks cashed and depleting the funds they have.&quot;

While paperless pay looks to be a great benefit to employees, especially those without checking accounts, it also is demonstrating considerable savings for employers, said William Hoppe, chief financial officer for Vicorp Inc. The Denverbased parent of Village Inn and Baker&apos;s Square restaurants also is talking to suppliers about an electronic pay system.

Besides printing costs for checks, companies also have to pay for delivery -- charges that can double if pay corrections have to be made and new checks printed and delivered, Hoppe said.

&quot;From a company perspective we see it as eliminating checking account reconciliation and making easier cash transfers,&quot; Hoppe said.

An analysis of companies using payroll cards showed (annual savings of up to $100,000&apos; said Keith Pascal, vice president of corporate development and a co-founder for eMac Digital, a technology firm that provides technical services to restaurants, including McDonald&apos;s Corp.

EMac Digital&apos;s Franchises Services Co. offers accounting and payroll processing services to the industry. FSC currently is assisting a group of fast-food restaurant operators in the Northeast that are testing a paperless-pay system, Pascal said. FSC partnered with Visa and Bank One to offer the services, he added.

Visa launched its payroll card last fall with retail stores and restaurants in mind, said Bill Dobbins, vice president of merchant sales for Visa.

&quot;In the restaurant industry in general, the turnover rates are higher than in other industries, some in excess of 200 percent,&quot; Dobbins said. &quot;The cost of constantly putting people on payroll systems and replacing lost checks makes our product appealing.&quot;

The cost of replacing a single check can exceed $6. That includes the cost of printing a check -- $1 to $1.50 -- and sending it overnight to stores, Dobbins said. In comparison, electronic deposits can cost between 10 cents and 40 cents.

Checkers, which rolled out payroll cards system wide in February through Comdata, a subsidiary of Ceridan Corp., expects to save $100,000 to $150,000 a year, said chief financial officer David Koehler.

Checkers is saving money not only on printing and delivery fees but also on personnel. Although the company has added more stores, it has not had to add positions to its payroll department, Koehler said.

&quot;It&apos;s much more efficient,&quot; he said. &quot;And the cost savings is attractive, but that was not our primary reason for doing it.&quot;

Checkers wanted to make life easier for all of its employees, he explained. For that reason the company went completely electronic- direct deposit of paychecks for those with checking accounts and payroll cards for those without. Employees received &quot;Gotta Eat&quot; cards, which look like regular bank cashing cards or debit cards. About 70 percent of Checkers&apos; 5,000 employees opted for the cards, Koehler said.

Employees&apos; salaries are loaded on the cards at 10 a.m. every Thursday, said Adam Noyes, Checkers&apos; vice president of operations. They can call an 800-number to verify the amount, and they still receive a paycheck stub when they go to work.

If there is an error in pay, it can be corrected in a few minutes, Noyes said.

&quot;There were some bumps,&quot; he said. &quot;That first pay period there were some challenges. Some employees had never used an ATM card. Once employees learned how to use the card, the response has been very positive.&quot;

Restaurant manager Hessner at the Clearwater store prepared his employees for the change by taking them to a nearby bank, individually or in groups of two, to show them how to use the ATM.

&quot;We thought it was going to be a huge transition, maybe impossible for the non-English speakers,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;d say it took two pay periods to get through the learning curve, and now everyone likes it very much.&quot;

Employers should not try to force their employees into going paperless, said Pascal with eMac Digital.

&quot;You really have to offer employees a compelling choice and reason to do this,&quot; he said. &quot;You don&apos;t like anybody messing with your pay.&quot;

While those in the corporate office may see immediate benefits, the store manager and operator also should be excited about the idea, said Pascal, a foodservice veteran who has worked for McDonald&apos;s and helped to start up Stir Crazy Cafe and Einstein Bros. Bagels.

&quot;You want to show the administrative benefits and savings but also show how it will eliminate all the employees asking for the paychecks on payday, which distracts from the floor and the customers,&quot; Pascal said. &quot;You want [store managers] pushing the solution to their employees and the benefit to their employees. Operator buy-in is a must.&quot;
