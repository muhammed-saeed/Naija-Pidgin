YOUR DOCTOR

 Dr. Alyssa Levin is thrilled to be part of the Desert Ridge community. 

She is a proud, second generation orthodontist. Her father, Dr. Paul Levin, is a well-respected and accomplished clinician, who has practiced in Mississauga, Ontario for over 35 years. Although a native of Toronto, Canada herself, Dr. Alyssa decided to make Phoenix her home after her parents discovered the area on a ski trip gone awry.

Dr. Levin completed her undergraduate training with a Bachelor of Science in Physiology from the internationally acclaimed McGill University in Montreal, Canada, and followed with her Doctor of Dental Surgery degree from the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario. She then came state-side to pursue her Masters in Orthodontics from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Go Blue! 

Dr. Levin is committed to the pursuit of excellence, both for herself and her patients, and she considers herself a lifelong student. For this reason Dr. Levin holds status as a Diplomate of the American Board of Orthodontics . Dr. Levin also belongs to numerous Professional Associations and Societies, both locally and nationally, and is currently serving as Membership Chair of the most storied orthodontic study club in the country, the Arizona Orthodontic Study Group, and President of the Scottsdale/Paradise Valley Dental Study Club.

So passionate about education is she that Dr. Levin has been involved with the orthodontic residents at A.T. Still University in Mesa, Arizona since that Program began in 2007, and is currently their Clinic Director. She absolutely adores working with and helping to educate future orthodontists, but she loves nothing more than the opportunity to put a smile on someone’s face and perhaps change a life!

When she is not perfecting a smile, Dr. Levin can be found on one of Arizona’s many exhilarating hiking trails, on the dance floor, learning any one of a number of ballroom routines, or dreaming about her next travel destination on the internet.

FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS

 A commitment to a beautiful, healthy smile is one of the best investments you can make in your future. Better oral health and an improved self-image are just some of the benefits provided by orthodontic treatment. 

For Children

 Though an orthodontist can enhance a smile at any age, there is always an optimal time to start treatment. Beginning treatment at this time ensures the greatest result and the least amount of time and expense. Dr. Levin and the American Association of Orthodontists recommend that the initial orthodontic evaluation occur no later than age 7, or about the time of eruption of the upper permanent front teeth. At this early age, orthodontic treatment is usually not necessary, but vigilant examination can anticipate the most advantageous time to begin treatment. Dr. Levin provides comprehensive initial examinations to children–as well as adults–at no charge.

For Adults

 Orthodontic treatment can be successful at any age, and adults are in the unique position to fully appreciate the benefits of a beautiful smile. Did you know that one out of every five patients now in orthodontic treatment is over 21? Did you also know that currently the largest growing segment of the population seeking orthodontic treatment is adult males? This market trend is, in part, due to the fact that there are so many more discreet treatment options available today, including clear ceramic brackets and Invisalign ® . Be sure to ask Dr. Levin about what would be best for you.

For some adults, certain treatment complexities or outcome limitations are a reality. Dr. Levin would be happy to evaluate your particular situation at your complimentary consultation. She will then design a completely customized treatment plan tailored to meet your individual needs and goals, with your overall oral health a top priority.

 
 
YOUR FIRST VISIT

What to expect

The first time you visit our office, please say hello to Patty at our front desk. She will assist you in checking in and notifying the doctor you have arrived. You will be given a tour of the office, including our sterilization area and in-house laboratory. The privacy of our consultation room will facilitate an open discussion about all of your treatment goals with Dr. Levin. All of your questions will be answered with knowledge and expertise.

At the conclusion of your comprehensive orthodontic examination, Dr. Levin will discuss her findings and her recommendations, if any, for treatment. Factors such as treatment duration and individual treatment complexities will be reviewed. In most cases, computer simulations of treatment options will be shown and discussed.

Dr. Levin believes in starting treatment only at the right time, according to individual needs. While some patients are ready for braces right away, others are not. Those who are not are placed on a recall schedule so that they may be monitored until it is exactly the perfect time to start. Those patients who are ready and eager to start treatment, may choose to proceed immediately following the consultation.

At our office you can expect to receive comprehensive orthodontic treatment that is tailored to meet your individual needs and desired results. Every person’s treatment is unique. Our goal is to work with you to ensure that all of your questions are answered, and all of your objectives have been addressed.

You will be surprised how affordable a million-dollar smile can be!

Orthodontic treatment is a very worthwhile investment for the overall dental, medical, and psychological well being of children, teens, and adults. In fact, dollar for dollar, braces are absolutely one of the best investments you can make in your overall health, appearance and well-being. Put simply, we believe everyone should have access to a sensational smile!

We are also sensitive to the fact that everyone has different financial needs, and therefore are pleased to offer a wide variety of no-interest payment arrangements. Prior to beginning any treatment, we will discuss your financial and insurance options in detail. We know you will like our flexible terms and customized approach.

So why are you waiting? Please contact us today to schedule your complimentary consultation with Dr. Levin and her talented staff.

Lingual braces are hidden behind the teeth and are therefore“invisible”when you smile. Lingual braces are 100% customized to match the shape of your teeth and are created uniquely for you. Lingual braces do take some getting used to, but they are a very reasonable option for athletes, models, actors/actresses, musicians who play wind instruments, and adult professionals.

 
 
TYPES OF BRACES
 
Traditional Metal Braces

 Traditional metal braces are the most common type of braces available. Dr. Levin uses only low profile brackets, so that you will be more comfortable today than ever before. With metal braces, you have the option of adding colored elastics (rubber bands) for a more unique and colorful look.
 
Gold Braces

 Gold braces are similar to traditional metal braces in many ways. They are also made of high-grade stainless steel, but are coated in gold. Gold may be considered a more cosmetic option than traditional metal braces. And, the cost of gold braces is surprisingly comparable to most clear braces.
 
Ceramic Braces

 Ceramic braces are made of clear materials and are therefore less visible on your teeth than metal braces. Ceramic braces tend to be used mainly on older teenagers and adult patients who have cosmetic concerns. While they are visually less prominent, they do require more attention to oral hygiene because ceramic braces are larger and more brittle than their metal counterparts.
 
Invisalign ® 

 Invisalign ® uses a series of clear, removable, and comfortable aligners to straighten your teeth. No one will be able to tell you are seeing an orthodontist unless they get really close! Not only are the aligners virtually undetectable, they are removable, so you can eat and drink what you want while in treatment, plus brushing and flossing are less of a hassle.

INVISALIGN ® 

 

 Dr. Levin is a certified Invisalign provider 

Dr. Levin is pleased to offer comprehensive orthodontic treatment without braces, too! She is specially trained and certified with Invisalign ® and Invisalign Teen ® .

Invisalign ® is an esthetic alternative to braces that is virtually undetectable to others. A series of clear removable aligners are used to straighten your teeth without metal wires or brackets. The aligners are custom made using Dr. Levin’s expertise and three-dimensional computer virtual imaging technology.

Once Dr. Levin has determined that Invisalign®is the proper treatment modality for you, precise treatment instructions are sent to Invisalign ® , along with molds of your teeth. Invisalign ® ; uses advanced computer technology to translate these instructions into a sequence of finely calibrated aligners. The number of aligners you will need to wear varies. You will usually wear each aligner for one to two weeks and only take it out for eating, brushing and flossing. As you replace each aligner with the next, your teeth will move gradually–week by week–until they reach their final positions prescribed initially by Dr. Levin, and you have the beautiful smile of which you have always dreamed!

To determine if Invisalign ® will help you reach the smile of your dreams, please call or email our office to schedule a consultation with Dr. Levin. In the meantime, please visit www.invisalign.com to learn more about Invisalign ® and Invisalign Teen ® , and be sure to ask during your consultation whether Invisalign®is the best treatment for you.

LIFE WITH BRACES

 Now that you have your braces on (or you will shortly), how do you take care of them?

This is important information because damaged braces or appliances are the surest way to increase the length of your treatment process.

Eating with Braces

As soon as you get your braces put on, you will probably want to stick to soft foods. Your teeth are likely to be a little tender, and soft foods will make things feel like normal more quickly. Definitely avoid hard breads and raw vegetables, like carrots. Before long you’ll be able to bite into a cucumber again. But as long as you’re wearing braces, you’ll need to protect them while you eat.

Here is a list of foods to avoid while you’re in braces:

 

 Chewy foods, or foods that get stuck in your braces–bagels, potato chips (Doritos are the worst offenders!) Crunchy foods–popcorn, ice Sticky foods–caramels, chewy candy (like Starburst), certain types of gum Hard foods–nuts, hard candy (like Jolly Ranchers), hard pizza crusts Foods you have to bite into–corn on the cob, apples, carrots* 

* If you want to eat foods you would ordinarily bite into, you still can! Just cut these foods into bite-size pieces first, and place pieces into the back of your mouth. So…cut the corn off the cob, and cut carrots and apples into small pieces rather than biting off a mouthful. Biting normally into hard foods like these is a sure way to damage your braces.

Lastly, chewing on hard objects (for example, pens, pencils, soda can tabs) can also damage your braces. Damaged braces will cause treatment to take longer. Moreover, many“emergency”appointments to repair damaged braces can be avoided merely by staying away from problem foods and objects.

General Soreness

When you get your braces on, you may feel some general soreness in your mouth. It is very normal for your teeth to be tender to biting pressures for three to five days. To feel better, you may choose to rinse your mouth with warm salt water. Dissolve 1 teaspoonful of salt in 8 ounces of warm water, and rinse your mouth vigorously for a few minutes. If the tenderness continues to be uncomfortable we recommend that you take whatever you would normally for headaches or similar pains. (But never exceed the dosing outlined on the bottle.) We promise, your mouth will not be sore forever!

You should also expect that your lips, cheeks, and tongue might become irritated for one to two weeks as they toughen and become accustomed to your new braces. The orthodontic wax we give you can be placed on any rough surface until your mouth has gotten used to your new braces. With orthodontic wax, the trick to remember is that less is more.

Loosening of Teeth

This is to be expected throughout treatment. Do not worry! It is completely normal. Teeth must first loosen before they can be moved. In fact, it is not unusual for teeth to be somewhat loose the entire time you are in braces. Once your braces are removed, your teeth will tighten up again, in their new, straightened positions.

Compliance with Treatment

To achieve the best result in the shortest amount of time possible, it is very important that you work with us to successfully accomplish your treatment goals. Coming in for your regularly scheduled adjustments is certainly important, but other factors will also determine your outcome. The teeth and jaws can only move toward their corrected positions if you follow our directions carefully and stay away from foods that will damage your appliances. Additionally, making sure to wear rubber bands (or other“extras”) is key to achieving the sensational smile for which we are all aiming.

Keeping Things Clean

It is more important than ever to brush and floss regularly (including after every meal) when you have braces. This is one of the only ways to ensure that the teeth and gums will be healthy after your orthodontic treatment is complete. We recommend that our patients rinse nightly with Phos-Flur a special Colgate rinse designed to add strength and hardness to the teeth while they are in braces. Phos-flur has been clinically proven to reduce decalcification (white-spot lesions) by 58%!!

 

Regular and frequent visits to the dentist are also extremely important during orthodontic treatment. Dr. Levin recommends that every patient see his or her pediatric or family dentist at least once every six months, and more frequently under certain circumstances.

Athletics

 If you play sports, Dr. Levin almost always recommends a protective mouthguard for athletic activities. Mouthguards are inexpensive, comfortable, and come in an exciting variety of colors and patterns. Please let us know if you need help finding the right mouthguard for you.

Injuries during sports are common. Most of the time, minor bumps and bruises are not a problem. Many injuries, however, can be made worse if braces are involved. In the case of any injury involving the face, be sure to check your mouth and the appliances immediately. If teeth are loosened or the appliances are damaged, please contact us or your family dentist immediately. In the mean time, you may be able to relieve discomfort temporarily with orthodontic wax or by rinsing your mouth with warm salt water.

Loose Wires, Brackets, or Bands

Don’t be alarmed if something comes loose. This happens occasionally. Luckily, these problems are usually not an emergency. All we ask is that you contact our office as soon as possible so that we can assess the situation and advise you accordingly. Many repairs can be taken care of simply by adding time to your next scheduled appointment, if it is not too far in the future.

 

 
 
ORTHODONTIC FIRST AID

Thankfully, the incidence of true orthodontic emergencies is rare, but when they do occur we are always available for you. You might be surprised to learn, however, that you can solve many problems yourself, at least temporarily, and until you are able to call our office and allow us to assess your particular situation.

Poking/Irritating Wires

This can occur on occasion, and if it does it tends to be within the first three to four months of treatment. If a wire protrudes and is irritating, use a blunt instrument (like the eraser end of a pencil) and gently push the irritating wire out of the way. Alternatively, wax may be placed over any sharp or poking wire. If the wire cannot be bent away or covered, and you feel comfortable, simply cut it with a small nail clipper. It is always OK to cut something that is protruding or poking you. We will replace whatever it is you removed at your next visit.

Loose Brackets or Bands

Don’t be alarmed if something comes loose. This happens occasionally. If a bracket or band comes loose, it is not an emergency. All we ask is that you contact our office as soon as possible so that we can assess the situation and advise you accordingly. Many repairs can be taken care of simply by adding time to your next scheduled appointment, if it is not too far in the future. If the loose bracket or band is irritating, and for temporary relief, place a little bit of orthodontic wax on it to cushion the area.

Discomfort

When you get your braces on, and sometimes after certain adjustments, you may feel a general soreness in your mouth. It is very normal for your teeth to be tender to biting pressures for three to five days*. To feel better, you may choose to rinse your mouth with warm salt water. Dissolve 1 teaspoonful of salt in 8 ounces of warm water, and rinse your mouth vigorously for a few minutes. If the tenderness continues to be uncomfortable we recommend that you take whatever you would normally for headaches or similar pains. (But never exceed the dosing outlined on the bottle.) We promise, your mouth will not be sore forever.

You should expect that your lips, cheeks, and tongue might become irritated for one to two weeks as they toughen and become accustomed to your new braces. The orthodontic wax we give you can be placed on any rough surface until your mouth has gotten accustomed to your new braces. Wax is your 1-stop shop for fixing nearly every type of sore your braces may cause. With orthodontic wax, the trick to remember is that less is more! And, as your mouth becomes more and more used to your braces, your reliance on wax will become less and less.

 * In the event that your discomfort lasts longer than three to five days, or your normal dosing of pain medication does not bring relief, please call our office. This might be an indication that there is something more going on. 

Trauma

In the case of any injury involving the face, be sure to check your mouth and the appliances immediately. If teeth are loosened or the appliances are damaged, please contact us or your family dentist immediately. In the mean time, you may be able to relieve discomfort temporarily with orthodontic wax or by rinsing your mouth with warm salt water.

 

 
 
RETAINER INSTRUCTIONS

 Congratulations! You have finally come to the end of the active phase of your orthodontic treatment (or maybe you are just tempting yourself with what is yet to come…). Whatever the case, here is a list of common Do’s and Don’ts that will help you to maintain your smile for life.

DO

 Wear your retainers full time, until Dr. Levin instructs otherwise. This generally means all the time, except for eating meals and brushing your teeth. Remove retainers when swimming or playing contact sports.…But be sure to put them back in your mouth as soon as the game is over! Clean your retainers thoroughly once a day with a toothbrush and toothpaste. Use room temperature (not hot) water. Brushing retainers removes the plaque and eliminates odors. Efferdent or a similar orthodontic appliance cleaner (found in any drug store) can be used, but does not take the place of brushing. ALWAYS put retainers in their case during meals. Most retainers are lost in school lunchrooms or restaurants. Keep them away from your dogs! Pets love to chew on them. Contact our office immediately if your retainers are lost or broken, so that we can arrange for their replacement. 

DON’T

 Wrap your retainers in napkins!! See #2 above. That is, unless you want to be digging through the trash… Expose your retainers to hot car dashboards or pockets. From the latter, they could find themselves in the washing machine (bad) or on a cold ski slope (true story). Forget to bring your retainers to your appointments. A retainer check cannot be completed without a retainer! Give up! Initially you might find talking with your retainers in to be difficult. And interestingly, adults usually have a longer adaptation period than their children. Practice speaking, reading, or singing out loud to get used to them faster. Try to adjust your retainers yourself. If you have any questions about your retainers, or they are loose, please contact our office to schedule an appointment.
