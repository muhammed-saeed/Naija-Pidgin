 Tweet I hope that you pass this along this to the Hardees CEO, and I hope that he or she had a good breakfast because I did not. My daughter went to the Hardees in Lebanon, Indiana, around 10:30am this morning. She goes there for me because I am disabled. I like the breakfast selections and it&apos;s right across the street from where I live. She ordered four breakfast sandwiches (among other things) and only received two. One of them had a long black hair sticking out of it. As a result, my wife and I paid for breakfast this morning without actually eating any. Hope you had a nice meal this morning. After seeing the hair, we obviously didn&apos;t want to take a chance on anything else we received.

I called and asked for the Hardees Manager. She didn&apos;t seem to care about what happened and showed no interest in trying to get us our food. Because my daughter had already gone to work, there was no way to go back to the restaurant to get the replacement food. She also did NOT give me the 800 number for complaints when I asked for it. She did give me the phone number of the District Manager. When I finally spoke to him, he also seemed to care less about what happened to me and showed no interest in makiing it right.

Having owned several businesses over the years and having managed fast food restaurants when I was younger (a KFC and a Burger Chef), I can honestly say that the people I spoke to were useless in terms of preserving customer loyalty or making things right. My wife also once worked as a Fast Food Restaurant Manager at a nearby Popeyes and agrees with my assessment of this situation from a purely business point of view.

Thankfully, I was treated much better by the person that took my complaint over the 800 number that I had to look up online for Hardees. She deserves a raise!

By the time that someone who identified herself as the Vice President of Operations called me, I had already decided that I wanted nothing further to do with Hardees. Two days ago they forgot part of my breakfast, a day ago they forgot a small fries we ordered at lunchtime and today, well, I already told that story.

The Vice President in charge of Operations did offer my money back. Well, that ship has sailed. I didn&apos;t want money, just the breakfast I paid for. Besides, a refund cannot make up for being so dissed or replace a missed meal. I guess that the Pizza Hut and Subway store up the street just got a once loyal Hardees customer. Subway has nice breakfast sanchwiches and I love Pizza Hut&apos;s Pi&apos;zones.

All I can say is that when it comes to Hardees, buyer beware and check your food before eating it for goodness sake! Comments United States Fast Food Restaurants Share with others:
