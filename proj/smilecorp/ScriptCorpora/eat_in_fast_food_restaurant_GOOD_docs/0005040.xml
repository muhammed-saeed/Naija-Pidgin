...The Mint Restaurant - Essential Information

16 Academy Street 
Coatbridge
Lanarkshire
ML5 3AU

01236 441191
www.navantaverns.com

The Mint Restaurant is part of the Navan Tavern Group of restaurants. This group offers two restaurants in Glasgow, one in Motherwell (my home town) and The Mint. The Mint is located up a side street from the main shopping area of Coatbridge. Street parking is available. It is very easy to find if you know your way around Coatbridge. The exterior of the restaurant is homely and welcoming.

The Mint is a family run establishment and they claim to offer home cooked food in a stylish and relaxed environment. The restaurants has a function room upstairs which offers tribute evenings and meals. They also cover weddings and other events. The main restaurant is accessed via a ramp and the inside...

Review of Paris Hilton - Paris 
 
 Paris, Texas 

 Advantages: Intelligent film making
 Disadvantages: Not as good as the first film


...RuN-TiMe 96 minutes 
Suited to a young white-collar audience 
French/English so some subtitles 
Cert 15 
--------- 

After the success of the intelligent and original wordy rom-com Before Sunrise (1995) and the rather samey sequel Before Sunset (2004), both starring Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke, Delpy returns in this hybrid, not only in a starring role but as director, editor and producer, very much her baby. But her beautiful French environmentalist Celine from the above two films has gone, as is the Ethan Hawke author character, Delpy effectively creating new versions of them for &apos;2 Days in Paris&apos;, so to carry on the love affair that didn&apos;t have a third film in it, the idea, one presumes, that we see how Jesse and Celines lives would have panned out vicariously through the stale romance of interior designer Jack (Adam Goldberg...
