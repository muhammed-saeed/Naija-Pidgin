 Short 
 Pump Towne Center Mall 

 11800 
 West Broad Street 

 
 
 Short Pump 
 Towne Center 

 Opened in 
 2002 , a couple of years behind schedule, the Short Pump Towne Center was 
 well worth the wait for Richmond area shoppers. The 928,000 square 
 foot shopping center has a Nordstrom, Lord&amp;Taylor, Pottery Barn, Crate&amp;Barrell, Dillard&apos;s Hecht&apos;s, Williams Sonoma and a 22 screen entertainment 
 complex which makes this a shopper&apos;s haven. Dining includes: Cajun Cafe&amp;Grill, Maggiano&apos;s Little Italy, Starbucks and The Great Steak 
 and Potato Company just to name a few . As a mall it&apos;s a bit 
 different, like a Main Street, park and go design rather than the 
 traditional enclosed mall concept. List of Stores at Short Pump Towne
