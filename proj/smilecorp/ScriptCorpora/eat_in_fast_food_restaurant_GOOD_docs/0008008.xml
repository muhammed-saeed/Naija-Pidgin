 Generic Vs. Name Brands 
 Posted in finances on April 29, 2010 by budgetbuster 
I would like to start off by saying“ Thank You ”to those of you who stayed faithful during our time of sadness and absence due to someone stealing our dog“Christian”. She is safe and sound (asleep) at home and recupperating quickly.

Now let’s get back to business!!!

I am not a picky person when it comes to the brand of item I purchase when grocery shopping, but my wife is the pickiest person I have ever met. The funny part about it is, if she does not see the item’s brand and you prepare the food, she will never know that they are not name brand items (SMILE). Because of this situation, I have been inspired to write this blog. I will show you how to get the name brand items

For decades the debate over generic products versus name brands has been the talk of politicians and everyday citizens alike.

 Found Dog=Happiness 
 Posted in finances with tags dogs , found , happiness , los angeles , lost , love , Pets , services on August 18, 2008 by budgetbuster 
Hi everyone,

For those of you who read our blog about losing our favorite buddy“Christian”, I would like to report that we finally have her back and I will get back to business with our BudgetBuster money saving tips. But for now, I must tell you about the miracle that transpired in getting Christian back.

As some of you may have read in our last blog, our dog Christian was stolen from my wife’s car while we were in Los Angeles helping her uncle with his will. The tragedy behind it all was that we reside in San diego, approxiamately 180 miles away from where she was stolen. It was a very discouraging trip back to San Diego after leaving Los Angeles without our little buddy. Before we left LA we put up a few fliers explaining what happened, and we informed the USC University Village authorities of what happened because there was a camera directly over our car that could show the whole incident happening. The two DPS officers who took our information and brought the cameras to our attention were both comforting and reassuring that they would do everything they could to help, including looking out for our dog when they were on duty. They were great!!! We were hopeful to say the least after discovering the camera. To my wife and I it would be our greatest asset; at least that’s what we thought. But after a few days of waiting for a call back from the DPS supervisor, he informed us that the camera above our car could not distinguish whether people caught on camera were men our women and therefore he could not help us. I was floored at his explanation and I vow to get to the bottom of that in the near future. My wife and I scoffed at the idea that a major university was using sub-par security cameras to keep students and residents in the area safe from criminals. Our belief is that DPS supervisor Mike Jurdi never looked at one second of the video.

That news did not deter us, but drove us to take matters into our own hands knowing that we were dealing with such a inadequate department supervisor. We immediately took action after our disappointing new and began registering Christian with online resources. There were a total of 85 faxes sent out to various agencies, including news media, radio stations, and animal shelters. On top of that, we sent out alerts on MySpace, LinkedIn and Facebook. We also placed her on the AVID HOT LIST. AVID is the company that works with animal shelter to place chips in your pets that contain the background of the pet, including who owns the pet. This prevents people from registering your pet as their own as well as alerting owners if their pet is turned into an animal shelter anywhere in the country.

One of the places we registered Christian was on HelpMeFindMyPet, an online register for pet owners who lose their pets. They were pivotal in how we found Christian, but it was a miracle how everything transpired. When Christian was registered with HelpMeFindMyPet we had to fill out a form describing what happened along with personal information about her. I included my personal phone number which I later learned that I was not supposed to do, but it was this mistake that got Christian back home. That mistake was seen by the owner of 1-800-Help-4-pets who personally called me to help find Christian. She was both encouraging and determined about getting Christian back into our arms. From day one 1-800-Help-4-Pets gave us great ideas and advice on how to handle our situation, and personally got involved with our mission. There was not a day that went by that they did not check in to see what the progress was in getting our dog back. Their owner was very detail oriented with how we should proceed with getting Christian home and would not let any stoned go unturned. That was such an unbelievable gesture from someone who had never met me or my dog. She was unwavering with her passion and unbelievable with her creativity. One of the ideas she gave me was to put up fliers wit a reward on it. That seems pretty standard, but what she asked me to put on it was what was unbelievable. I followed her instructions to the smallest of details being that she has over twenty years experience in this area, and I had a whopping two days 

Well, almost two weeks had gone by and there were no responses to our efforts; then we got a call on Monday, August 11th taht changed everything. At around 10pm 1-800-Help-4-Pets gave us a call stating that someone was on the line, and she believed that she had seen Christian with a homeless African American woman. This was awesome news, but strange because the person who stole her from my wife’s car was white with blond shoulder length hair. Nevertheless, we were estatic about the news. 1-800-Help-4-Pets asked the person to return to the scene and call us back to makes sure that the dog was Christian. That’s when things went south. She called back and told us that the woman had disappeared along with the dog that looked like Christian. Still, I was optimistic.

Then on Friday, August 15th at around 11pm, I was awakened by a thud from upstairs. I went to investigate what had hit the floor and discovered it was my cell phone. When I looked at it, there were 6 missed calls from a Blocked ID, so I checked my voice messages to see who was so anxious to reach me. It was 1-800-Help-4-Pets, so I immediately called them back to see what the fuss was about. When they answered the phone, I could hear an obvious tone of excitement and hope from the owner. She immediately asked me what type of tags that Christian was wearing when she was stolen. I told her that one was silver and the other was blue.

She whispered with excitement,“Melvin, I think we found your dog. A woman is on the phone and believes that she has Christian.”

We went back and forth with a series of questions which were all answered with positive replies. My heart began to race as I thought of the possibility of getting my buddy back. I got so loud that it woke my wife.

She asked,“Who are you talking to? You are very loud.”

After she discovered what was transpiring, her eyes lit up with joy. There was a slight chance that our little buddy was coming home. I was so excited that I offered to drive the 180 miles to Los Angeles to get her. But after some persuading from my wife, I stubbornly agreed that is was not a good idea and agreed to meet the finders at 6am the next morning.

As you can imagine, I did not sleep very well that night and overslept. I awakened in panic and rushed to find my phone to let the potential finders know that I had overslept and would be late getting there. They were okay with it, so I got dressed and beagan my 3 hour journey (due to traffic jams) to Los Angeles. I prayed the whole way up, hoping that it would be a positive outcome. Once I got there I had a million thoughts running through my mind. I ended up talking to a sherriff, stopping by the police station, nervously eating, and praying some more. I did not want to be disappointed.

After I shook off the jitters, I called the potential finders to arrange a meeting place. It took an hour to agree on a location. This made me very nervous and I began to doubt the legitamacy of the people who claimed to have Christian. Nonetheless, we decided that a fast food restaurant would be the best meeting place, and agreed to meet in 5 minutes. Fifteen minutes went by, and I began to get nervous, so I called them again and again without success. All of my hopes began to fade…then my cell phone rang. It was the finder. He stated that he was at the restaurant and wanted to know where I was. I had went across the street to a discount store to kill time. He agreed to meet me there and told me to wait for him; I agreed. 5 minutes seemed like an eternity as I watched every man who passed me to see if he had Christian in his possession. Then the magic moment was here!!!! A short, balding man carrying a tattered looking dog came into focus and almost walked past me. He had my buddy in his arm!!!! I grabbed him and let him know that it was my dog. After a thorough check, I made a positive identification of Christian. She was visibly worn out and tires. She had lost a tremendous amount of weight and did not act like her normally fiesty self.

Although I was sad about her condition, I was elated to have my buddy back. My family is also happy to ahev her back home. She has slept from the time I picked her up and beginning to get reacclimated to her home. This story would not be possible without the persistence of 1-800-Help-4-Pets and Helena who identified the person who stole our dog (that gave us hope). I will be eternally greatful for their gestures of love and kindness.

It just goes to show you that their are still some incredibly caring individuals left and that anything is possible when people work together to reach a common goal.

My Stolen Friend
 
For those of you who normally read my blogs about finances, I apologize for talking about something that has nothing to do with busting your budget with steals and deals, but is more important to me than money. It is the recent loss of my dog Christian. She is a great joy to live with and means a lot to my wife and I since we rescued her during the San Diego wildfires last year.

I am just going to share the letter I produced for the public to help me find her. If you live in the Los Angeles area, I pray that you be on the lookout for my best friend Christian.

 Letter to the Public 

 We are asking for your help in the return of our dog “ CHRISTIAN” who was stolen from our car in the Denny’s parking lot in University Village ( USC ) on August 1, 2008 at approximately 4:50pm . CHRISTIAN is a FEMALE CHIHUAHUA MIX with Black and Brown hair. She is wearing her tags on a RED collar. She is very smart, but does not voluntarily go to strangers. CHRISTIAN is very important to my wife and I. We adopted “ CHRISTIAN” after rescuing her from the San Diego wildfires in October 2007. 

 

 According to a witness, a female suspect broke into our vehicle to retrieve our dog, and “ CHRISTIAN” jumped out of our car and ran towards the street facing USC . The suspect was unsuccessful in retrieving our dog until “ CHRISTIAN” jumped into a car with two African American females pulling up to Denny’s to drop off a male passenger. The suspect asked the two females to hold “ CHRISTIAN ” until she pulled her car around. 

 

 After the suspect pulled up to the car with the two African American females and our dog, she retrieved our dog and drove off. 


 The suspect is described as: 

 WHITE FEMALE 

 40-45 YEARS OLD 

 BLOND HAIR (SHOULDER LENGTH) 

 WEARING A ( Pink ) FLORAL STYLE TOP WITH THE SHOULDER OFF 

 

 Suspect’s car is described as: 

 TAN/BEIGE COMPACT CAR 

 

 If you have any information concerning the whereabouts of our dog CHRISTIAN, please call us at 619.750.1151 or email us at info@vizionevents.com . You may also contact the LAPD east office at 213.485.2582 . You may remain anonymous . We just want our dog back. 

 

 Thank you for your help and we pray that you will be able to help us get CHRISTIAN back home safe and sound. PS : Helena, thank you for your help.

 Cut Back on Household Items 
 Posted in Budget&amp;Saving , finances , Home , Household with tags budget , Home , house , Household , money , saving , walmart on July 16, 2008 by budgetbuster 
Since starting the BudgetBuster blog, I have been passionate about finding“real”ways of saving money for everyone and not just those that are strapped for cash. So I am constantly brainstorming to figure out what the next blog would be about. Today’s blog was conceived while I was cleaning my house before a trip to visit my parents for their 50th anniversary. I am extremely excited to say the least. With that being said, let’s get down to business.

Keeping a house intact and tidy is not only time consuming, but it can cost a lot to maintain your personal castle. I will let you in on some of the things I have personally done to save money on household items and cleaning products. Some of the ideas are directly related to my mom and dad who were very disciplined cleaners. I remember spending entire weekends keeping the house in order and although I despised my arduous chores back then, I am eternally grateful that my parents were so dog-gone strict about cleaning because it prepared me for my single years. It felt great to not have to date Susie Q because I didn’t know how or like to do laundry .

The alternative ways I discovered growing up have saved me a fortune on household items and I want to share them with you.

One of nature’s best kept secrets is vinegar . It can be used for a variety of applications in the home. One way that I used to use vinegar was to clean glass in the house and the family’s Econo-Line Ford van. The vinegar actually worked better than Windex and any other cleaner I had ever used, and since I had been the official glass cleaner in the family, I could definitely tell the difference. Another way to utilize vinegar is as a laundry softener . That’s right…I said laundry softener. What the vinegar does to the laundry is break down the laundry detergent which keeps it from leaving your favorite pair of jeans from feeling as stiff as a board after coming out of the dryer.  It also helps keep allergies down for people with sensitive skin . Vinegar can also be used as a drain cleaner when coupled with baking soda. This will eliminate those foul odors that sometimes permeate from drains when food gets trapped in the garbage disposer and pipes.

The second tip that I use around the house is the re-use of plastic grocery store bags . There are an

unbelievable amount of uses for those plastic bags from the grocery and covenience stores that some of us  throw away. One way that I use my plastic bags is as a pooper scooper when I take my dog for a walk. It keeps my neighborhood from being riddled with fertilzer from my dog and it also gives me a way to re-use my plastic bags. Another use that I am sure that many of you may already be implementing is to use plastic bags as trash can liners in your small trash cans. I usually place at least two bags in the bottom for quick replacement of the full plastic bag being removed. Other ways to recycle your plastic bags are:

 Reuse at the grocery store. Place a few in your vehicle to use as trash dispensers. Store out-of-season clothing. Use as lunch bags. 

Most of us have a box of baking soda around the house and use it for either cooking or keeping our

refrigerators smelling fresh. But did you know that baking soda can be used in a variety of ways? If you have toddlers in the house and use cloth diapers, baking soda can be used to soak and wash the diapers . By doing so, you minimize an allergic reaction that can be caused by the chemicals found in most detergents. But it isn’t just for the baby’s diapers; baking soda can be added to any wash to get your clothes cleaner . I use baking soda to clean my sinks and toilets . The baking soda serve as a soft abrasive, cleaner, and freshener at the same time when cleaning sinks and toilets. Lastly, baking soda is a great teeth cleaning agent . Many tooth paste manufacturers include baking soda in their ingredients when producing their product. It has been used in this manner for decades and is a permanent fixture in plenty of bathrooms across the country.

As you can see, there are many ways to cut back on household items by finding low cost alternatives. We hope that this blog has been helpful and would love to hear your testimonies and BudgetBuster ideas. Send your ideas to budgetbuster@hotmail.com or just leave a comment.
