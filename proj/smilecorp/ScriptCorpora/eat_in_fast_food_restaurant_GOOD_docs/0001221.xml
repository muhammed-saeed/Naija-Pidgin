Great idea for Papa Murphy’s – make the pizzas in order.
 by Paul Michael on 6 February 2008 71 comments Photo: Penny 
What do you get if you cross a bunch of hungry people with an ineffective ordering system? You get the riot that almost happened at my local Papa Murphy’s on Friday. And if they don’t do something about it, blood will be shed next time…I’m sure of it.

I’ve always had issues with Papa Murphy’s. My biggest gripe is cost; they don’t have the same overheads as any other pizza chain and yet the pizzas cost the same, if not more. A large specialty pizza from Pizza Hut, in my area, is $3 cheaper than the same one at Papa Murphy’s. But they have won Pizza Chain of the year for the last 5 years, so they’re clearly doing something right…somewhere.

However, one thing they’ve got dead wrong, at least at my local store, is the ordering system. Or should that be ordering nightmare?

It works something like this–
 
1. Call ahead and order your pizza.
2. Turn up 20 minutes later and pay.
3. Be told“that’ll be just a few minutes.”
4. Wait a few minutes.
5. Watch some guy come into the store and order.
6. Wait a few more minutes.
7. Watch more people come in with phone orders.
8. Watch them pay.
9. Watch the guy who just came in get his pizza.
10. Scratch your head and wonder why.
11. Wait a few more minutes.
12. Watch some lady wander into the store and place an order.
13. Watch more people come in with phone orders.
14. Try not to laugh at them.
15. Wait a few more minutes.
16. Watch lady who just came in get her pizza.
17. Start getting really annoyed.
18. Watch other people with phone orders get annoyed.
19. Repeat steps 5 though 18 for the next HOUR.
20. Form a protest gang with fellow hungry, pissed off phone order customers.
21. Go to counter, see masses of tickets in no particular order.
22. Watch young store clerk give you bewildered‘help me’look.
23. Organize a committee.
24. Sort through tickets, find phone orders.
25. Get phone orders made, hoping there is no spit in the pizzas.
26. Receive, as a way of saying sorry for the long wait, NOTHING extra in return.
27. Leave store with pizza, grumpy.
28. Return home to hungry, annoyed family.
29. Recount steps 1 through 27 while pizza cooks using your own electricity.
30. Eat pizza begrudgingly.

 

 

 
 
 

 Pizza worth waiting for? Not really. 

Now, I know a thing or two about advertising. I also know that more people will recount a bad customer experience than a good one. What surprised me most, other than the shambolic way of making pizzas in no discernable order, was the complete ignorance of the staff that day.

It was obvious to anyone in the store that there was a long line of people getting very annoyed. It was also obvious, due to the hints and complaints we dropped throughout the process, that nothing was being done.

Sure, they were busy. It was a Friday night after all. But most other places manage to process orders in the order in which they receive them…I believe that’s why it’s actually call an order. And having waited a total of 80 minutes for a pizza, to be given nothing in return for my time and trouble was just as confusing.

Papa Murphy’s, your pizzas are tasty. But your ordering system needs work. A lot of work. And I’m afraid I won’t be going back for a long, long time; even longer than I waited for that pepperoni pizza last Friday night.

I&apos;ve only tried Papa Murphy&apos;s once, and it was the same kind of disaster you just described. No way am I ever going back there when I can go to Little Ceaser&apos;s and pick up a $5 pizza that is sitting there, all ready and just waiting for me.

I think we&apos;re about to see another chapter in the book &quot;Great Ideas with Terrible Business Plans&quot; - chapter 1 was the Krispy Kreme donut story.

At my local place, they make them in order all the time, and also any coupons offered through the e-club are usually just done as the weekly special.

I love Papa Murphy&apos;s and haven&apos;t run into any problems there. I prefer going to these take-and-bake places because they cost so much less and I can bring my pizza home and have it hot instead of lukewarm. We don&apos;t have a lot of places that deliver and it makes this worth the effort for us. I also love it because when I get it home, I can add additional toppings before it is baked off.

They have a newsletter that I subscribe to. I would highly recommend it, if anyone else goes there regularly, because I get coupons and specials from them all of the time. We usually pay about $5.99 for a large.

and it still took 80 minutes? I can teach you how to make bread dough, there sauce probably comes from a can and the cheese is probably pre-shredded from Costco or Sam&apos;s. Open one at your house. Solicit customers from the angry masses, you&apos;ll be rich in no time. And pizza will take much less time than the 2+ hours yours did and it will probably be cheaper.

They really don&apos;t cook it? And all y&apos;all fall for it? All y&apos;all? I always though the whole point of pizza from the pizza place was that they had a pizza oven and I didn&apos;t, so their cheese is more gooey than I could make it and lovely and brown and bubbly. No?

This is yet another genius idea, like the pet rock, that I should have come up with. GENIUS.

Baffled. Totally, 100% baffled.

But I do have a thing for Krispy Kreme, although it&apos;s only good when you have to drive the 1.5 hours from New Orleans to Hattiesburg or Biloxi to get them (instead of studying, of course) and get a warm one and bring back dozens (I&apos;m not kidding, like 6 or more boxes) for everyone else. Somehow, not as interesting when there was one over in Metairie. (Went to Tulane, this is what we did for fun when Northern college students were playing beer pong - beer? we can get that anywhere, I think there&apos;s a free tap around here somewhere, but Krispy Kreme, that&apos;s an event.)

actually i work at a papa murphy&apos;s we make every thing fresh every single day we grade our own cheese make our own cookie dough, make the dough, chop, and cut everything(except some of the meats of course) everything is fresh..people have no idea how fresh it all is.

I can tell u that papa Murphy&apos;s shreds there own cheese, and that the only sauce that comes premade is the sauce for the cheesy bread.
 

 6 Feb. 2008 | 12:17 PM Duncan #7 
Alyson has a point. Make it yourself at home cheaper and probably tastier. With fresher ingriedients and healthier choices.
My brother in law came over we went out bought the ingriedients, he made 6 random pizzas that were better than any restaurant within 50 miles for cheaper than 1 large pepperoni delivered.

So all y&apos;all can send your extra money to Alyson and I if you want but make the pizzas at home.

My breadmaker pizza dough cycle is less than 80 minutes!

We have had mixed experiences with Papa Murphy&apos;s. In one city we lived the nearby one was well run, and consistently at least good. The one in our new town was a disorganized mess and the pizza was poorly tossed together the last time I went there I ended up waiting for a phone order for quite a while. Either experience they are still much cheaper than any other pizza place. But I quit using it as an option because they were that disorganized. That and we bought the breadmaker.

My wife and I had our taxes done at an H&amp;R Block office a few years ago. We called ahead of time and made an appointment (tax offices and kids don&apos;t mix). In fact, the office manager suggested we make an appointment so that we wouldn&apos;t have to wait. Anyway, we show up before our scheduled time... and we wait... and wait... and wait... When asked for an explanation, the office manager said they had to help the walk-in traffic. The manager couldn&apos;t grasp the concept of an appointment. From that point on, we decided to do our own taxes.

Maybe it&apos;s because I live in a very rural part of Oregon that my experience has always been just the opposite. Its always fresh, cheap, and fast. The coupon deals knock the price way down and the specials are usually pretty good too. I&apos;m thinking it&apos;s because of the small town attitude that it works here. Everyone knows virtually everyone and you better not mess up a hungry lumberjacks pizza or someone will pay LOL.

Another chime in for make your own pizza.

The dough is pretty easy to make, my wife makes a wheat bread dough. She makes a pizza that is so awesome. Ok, I&apos;m getting too excited. Wheat crust, pesto for sauce, onions, green peppers, red peppers, and feta cheese on top. Oh Em Gee.

I&apos;ve never tried a take and bake place and now I never will, thanks for the heads up!

If you&apos;re going to have to bake the pizza yourself anyway, wouldn&apos;t it be faster/cheaper to get a frozen pizza from the supermarket? I&apos;m trying but I don&apos;t see how this makes sense.

Frozen Pizza is not fresh. Papa Murphy&apos;s is fresh. I was checking out frozen pizzas last week and the 12&quot; pizza that is comparable was almost $7 on sale. At Papa Murphy&apos;s the 14&quot; pizza (about 30% more) was on sale for $6.99. When you have a coupon or the pizza is on sale, Papa Murphy&apos;s cannot be beat, even with homemade.

While, by all means the staff were completely in the wrong, it&apos;s your own fault for waiting there for 80 minutes. When I&apos;ve gone to Papa Murphy&apos;s, the pizza has almost always been there waiting for me. When it&apos;s particularly busy, I sometimes have to wait a few minutes, but I would be talking to a manager and/or walking out the door well before 80 minutes had passed, probably before even 30 minutes had passed. You even rewarded them for their horrible service by paying them money for the pizza.

On Super Bowl Sunday, you call Dominoes, they say 45 minutes. At the 45 minute mark, do you stand up and open your front door? I doubt it, because you know it may take longer. If you accept late delivery, how is it Papa Murphy&apos;s is not also aloud to be &quot;Just that busy&quot; that maybe you&apos;ll have to wait a few minutes, when you show up at the 45 minute mark. They get slammed just like delivery. Who has not waited for delivery? Delivery is never on time. If I needed delivery in one hour, I&apos;d call an hour and a half early. Delivery pizza tells you when it will be ready, you tell Papa Murphy&apos;s when you&apos;ll be there. People are so used to saying &quot;I am on my way&quot; to Papa Murphy&apos;s, giving them 10 minutes, and expect 0 wait time. Maybe on extremely busy days, they deserve the same courtesy you give Pizza Hut Delivery. If you need it at 5:15, and don&apos;t like waiting, remember you are in control, say you need at 5. Also, I am sure few realize, alot of Papa Murphy&apos;s customers show up 10 minutes early, that&apos;s why on time people wait. The early people demand immediate pizza. If a customer is in the store, early mind you, causing a scene, their pizza get&apos;s made 1st. Moral of the story, be considerate, on bust nights, allow an extra 5 minutes, and don&apos;t show up early.

I waited over 30 mins before I started growling a&quot;harumphing&quot;, but I did have to pay for the pizza in advance, and was then told&quot;it&apos;ll be out in a few minutes.&quot;

I would have argued for my money back if I didn&apos;t have a hungry family to go home to.

We always had great experiences with Papa Murphy&apos;s. The food was good, they were in our local wal-mart so we would order on our way in to pick up diapers and such and then pick up the pizza on the way home. I live in the suburbs of Atlanta and while our Wal-Mart is very busy the PM&apos;s wasn&apos;t so busy it was a miserable experience. Being a franchise I&apos;d guess it&apos;s just that they don&apos;t have good controls on the various franchisees. Prices were pretty nice too. Coupons probably helped my perception of that, but I recall especially liking their cheesy breadsticks for only a couple bucks as a way of adding to the meal of any given night.

Did you send a letter to the manager or to the corporate website.

Its always easy to complain about something, but if you don&apos;t tell someone who can effect change, it doesn&apos;t do any good.

We recently had a bad experience at a McDonald&apos;s drive-thru (imagine that) and I submitted a comment via their website and got a call of apology from the local franchise owner and a card for a free meal for our family.

A quick check of their website finds their feedback page here.

I&apos;m hardly a Papa Murphy&apos;s apologist, but I have a feeling you&apos;ve just been bitten by ineffective management at one particular store. Or, at least, I&apos;ve never had this problem with the two different stores I&apos;ve been to.

Papa Murphy&apos;s is a franchise store so it may be futile to contact their corporate HQ, but it couldn&apos;t hurt either.

Sorry you had such a horrible time but all of our Murphy&apos;s around here are great. Their prices beat every local &quot;hot&quot; pizza chain by a mile and they always have our phone orders ready in 15 minutes. Might be the manager and lack of employee training. But as for me and my dollar, when buying pizza, will be spent on papa murphy&apos;s.

2 things:



 My biggest gripe is cost; they don’t have the same overheads as any other pizza chain and yet the pizzas cost the same, if not more 

 

Price has nothing to do with overheads. It has everything to do with maximising profit by charging what the market will bear. As an&quot;ad man with inside knowledge&quot;, you could be expected to know that

 

 19. Repeat steps 5 though 18 for the next HOUR.
20. Form a protest gang with fellow hungry, pissed off phone order customers. 

 

Er, wouldn&apos;t you have wanted to start asking them after 10 minutes or so?

If I called ahead and when I arrive and the pizza is not ready, I would actually walk away and buy something else. I have done that in the past. The family gets a bit of a surprise and disappointed, but they get over it quickly when I show up with something else that is yummy.

Folks, just walk out and get something else. I do that everywhere if the service sucks.

And never go back.

I went once and have never gone back. It&apos;s not that I had to wait on the day I went, but I paid so much for it. It was like you said, the same cost as one you&apos;d order cooked. And it tasted lousy. The veggies tasted old and a bit rotten, and they were stingy with the cheese. In the last town I lived, there was a Papa Murphy&apos;s that made me a fan. Always great service. Always good pizza. Always cheaper than any other pizza place around. I liked to stop there after work on Thursdays when we&apos;d watch Survivor. It became our tradition so much so that we couldn&apos;t watch Survivor without Papa Murphy pizza. I am sorely disappointed that the one near us is so lousy. Maybe the owner&apos;s will find out and get a new manager.

I am not sure what you have said is either fair or accurate? I hope you thouroughly checked your facts before publicly slamming a franchisee who could be doing there best to make an honest dollar. It is only fair and just to give the owner a chance to make the situation right before displaying comments that go on and on. The average wait time is 3-4 minutes for a Papa Murphy&apos;s pizza. If you waited longer, you should have asked someone to check on it. If you still had to wait, you should have asked for a manager. Would you sit back and watch your burger at McDonalds for &quot;80 minutes&quot; without speaking up. It seems there were a number of human errors invloved with the alleged mishaps during your visit. But as a consumer, do the right thing and let SOMEONE know about your experience if it was less than ideal. If you send an email and do not get a response as we have done with Pizza Hut and the other Papa, THEN do not go back. It is only fair to give a small business owner the opportunity to make the situation right! Especially before slamming a company!

Thank you for your comments. I could go on and on but I&apos;ll try to keep this short enough to read.
As a Papa Murphy&apos;s franchisee of 13 years I&apos;ve seen it all.
Short of being in your store at all times it would seem to be impossible to get an entire crew at one time who will take care of things the way I (the owner) would like. So please use the customer feedback at the bottom of your reciept. We recieve feedback constantly (positive and negative). The company that does or customer feedback only gives us credit toward our percentage scores on a grade of 5. Anything below that is a zero so sometimes it&apos;s hard to read the reports but we do anyway. Be sure to mark yes on the area that asks if you would like to be contacted. Otherwise we will not contact you assuming you don&apos;t want to be bothered. Working at a Papa Murphy&apos;s is rewarding especially when you can make your customers happy. And very stressfull when you can&apos;t. I find explainations of some of the circumstances we deal with going through my head but I will not list them here as they sound like excuses. So...please let us know when you have a bad experience...and don&apos;t hesitate to give us a 5 if we deserve it. You get a discount on your next visit regardless of which way your feedback reads so what do you have to lose?
To all those comments that came before in this thread...Don&apos;t knock it until you try it...We make our dough fresh every day...We grate three kinds of cheese everyday(not from Costco)...There is no comparison between our pizza and Dominos, Pizza Hut, Little Ceasars etc. We use top quality ingrediants and way more than the other guys. I.E. Our Large Pepperoni pizza has 60 slices of pepperoni. We know we are on the right track if they touch each other when we are putting them on.

I think you&apos;re missing the point.

It doesn&apos;t matter if Papa Murphy&apos;s is the best, cheapest, tastiest pizza in the world in most places. Here is the point:

It sucks and is over priced where I live.

I don&apos;t care how good it is where you live, or what kind of awards they win, or what a great place it could be if my local manager was fired. Those things don&apos;t change the fact that I had a terrible experience at my local store and won&apos;t be going back. Ever.

I&apos;m relating my bad experiences, &quot;slamming&quot; them as you put it, because I should NEVER have to endure that in the first place. In my case I did speak to the local store manager while I waited, but he did nothing to fix the problem and didn&apos;t offer me anything to try and win me back as a customer.

The Krispy Kreme story goes like this:

They had a GREAT product, the stores were always packed, and I had hot, fresh donuts whenever I wanted. Then all of a sudden, the 3 local stores where I live went out of business. Nobody understood why, the stores were always packed. Then I saw something on the news where the VP of Krispy Kreme was asked about his business model. I forget exactly what he said, but it was clear he didn&apos;t have a clue what a business model was, let alone what his own company&apos;s business model was. Who knows what happened? I&apos;m guessing management at some level found a way to suck the money out of the business and stuff their own pockets.

By the tone of your words I can tell your probably a road rage kind of person. Chill out and make the best out of a bad experience. Hey, if you hadn&apos;t been stuck there waiting on pizza you may have been spared being hit by a drunk driver...Everything happens for a reason, embrace it, don&apos;t let it get to you, it&apos;s bad for the soul.

The papa murphys near me does a great job about being quick and serving the customers in order. I usually go there because I like their pizza and I have coupons for there. This site has lots of free pizza coupons . If you like to eat pizza, try checking it out. www.1pizzacoupons.com
