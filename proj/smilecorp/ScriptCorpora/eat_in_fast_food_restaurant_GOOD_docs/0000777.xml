 Good for nutrition education.. 
I am a nutritionist and dietitian. I used this DVD in my nutrition education class. The participants were very impressed by the movie. It saved me a lot of time for the preparation. ... more info Supersize Me 
I had 2 different orders with this product. One was for a single DVD, the other was for 5 of these DVDs. SO I don&apos;t know which order I&apos;m reviewing right now. Both orders came in sealed wrapping. I haven&apos;t watched any of them, because they are for prizes in a life-style change program. The program is CHIP (Coronary Health Improvement Project). They came in record time. Thank You.... more info An, er, revelation 
In which we learn that fast food, when consumed excessively and for long periods of time, can cause some health problems. ... more info Not shocking! 
I thought this documentary was well done, even if the deck was stacked. Yes folks, if you eat fast food for 30 days 3x a day you will become seriously ill. I don&apos;t think it is fair to pick on McDonalds, there are many fast food companies and they are all spending lots of dough to get your attention. Growing up, my mother always cooked home made, and I mean nearly from scratch. I attribute that to being healthy, and having an appreciation for home-made spaghetti, beef stroganoff, tacos, fish- twice a week (a few of my favorites) and our dinners always included a veggie (introduce veggies young and kids will eat them, maybe really like them), we almost never had a dessert, and by dessert I mean peaches and cottage cheese... (funny how I&apos;ve as an adult never cared for dessert!)Why do I mention this? Growing up this way gave me an appreciation for really good food. I was spoiled rotten by my mom, and grandma who are both excellent cooks. We rarely ate fast food, and when we did it was a special treat...not a way of life.

When as parents we &quot;feed&quot; our children responsibly, hopefully they will grow to incorporate those responsible ideals. This idea can be applied anywhere. Some have posted comments that childrens&apos; cereal is purposely shelved at a height where kids can see it...they are little guys ;) Who buys the cereal? Who plans the meals?

One point I would like to make about Super Size Me: After viewing I&apos;ve not been able to eat a chicken McNugget since. (I do get a craving for a Big Mac though) My son, who watched the documentary with me (he is 9) still finds them tasty. So much for opening his eyes, he doesn&apos;t care that it&apos;s old chicken. Than again he loves sushi...not regularly served at our house.

People please stop blaming Corporations, schools, Government! It all starts at home...


maybe with home-cooking :)

... more info Not bad kinda one sided 
This movie is pretty ones sided but it brings up a good point about how much fast food we eat and that it can&apos;t be good. I think he starts it off well showing that he is healthy and exercises regularly he gets blood work done and a check up at regular intervals during this film and sets ground rules for how it is conducted which I think makes it pretty honest, but 30 days of just eating McDonalds for every meal is just hard to take. He does bring up some interesting facts about the food served and what it does to you. Obviously if you eat this way you will gain weight and he also stopped exercising to be the so called average American. I believe this movie has valid points due to the fact that all of the fast food companies are on the healthy menu bandwagon and that it&apos;s pretty hard to dispute that a majority of Americans are overweight and out of shape. You can see that just walking down any street in America. All in all a pretty good flick and an interesting way to make your point.... more info OH MY GOD!!! 
Why didnt anyone tell me that McDonalds was bad for you??? THANK YOU for making this documentary, I would have been lost without it! I thought the love handles came from something I was doing wrong, but now, thanks to Mr. Spurlock, I realize that I am not to blame for anything. I must say, it feels good knowing that nothing is my fault, and that large corporations are to blame for everything. ... more info McDiet equals McStroke 
McDonald&apos;s, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco Bell, Wendy&apos;s Burger King, Dairy Queen what do all of these restaurants have in common besides workers being paid minimum wage and offering artery clogging food in large quantities at cheap prices: they have overtaken the food market and supposedly are to blame for making America the fattest country in the world.

Filmmaker Morgan Spurlock, after reading about two obese girls suing McDonald&apos;s for making them fat, decides to go on a &quot;diet&quot; a McDiet in which he eats McDonald&apos;s three times a day and sets up such restrictions as not allowing himself to eat or drink anything not available at McDonalds and only supersizing his meals when the server asks him if he wants to. Before beginning on his expedition, Spurlock has a massive vegetarian meal prepared by his vegan chef girlfriend which will be his lowest calorie meal for the next thirty days. Spurlock, whom rarely ate fast food before the making of the film, laughs at the ridiculous proportions served by McDonald&apos;s and the amount of sugar he consumes just in his milkshakes and soft drinks. The first couple of days he is okay, but he begins to get sick soon thereafter and once vomits on camera after eating a supersized meal. As the thirty days pass on by, the viewer gets to see how the food is destroying Spurlock such as in one case it is mentioned that he is destroying his liver like an alcoholic, but with food instead of beer, wine, and liquor. The weight he gains and the damage to his mood the food creates are real eye-openers.

Super Size Me has been criticized by a number of individuals who have stated that Spurlock&apos;s diet in the film is unrealistic and that no normal person would consist just on McDonald&apos;s for such a long time. However, Spurlock is attempting to consume enough McDonald&apos;s food for an eight year equivalent and he even reduces his daily exercise to get in line with the average American some of who do eat junk every day and who with their automobiles and general laziness walk little each day. Spurlock might be going to extremes, but he is showing how a number of Americans are destroying themselves through junk.

One issue that I wish Spurlock addressed is that of who consumes fast food the most. There are of course soccer moms and the like who treat their kids to McDonald&apos;s after practice and individuals who just need to grab a quick bite to eat. However, at least in my experience having lived in a small southern town, a good number of people who eat fast food, and especially the dollar meals, are from poor families who honestly cannot afford better foods when they eat out, and sometimes eating out is a must when one has limited time to prepare foods. If one looks at a number of people who eat fast food and compare with their economic level one can see a correlation between obesity and economic status.

A fun, albeit horrifying film, Super Size Me has done a good job trying to make Americans think before consuming fat-laden junk.... more info Eating nothing but corn causes disease. Is corn therefore bad for you? 
Doesn&apos;t anyone care about consumer freedom? Yeah, if I eat nothing but McDonalds everyday it&apos;s very bad for me. I knew that. If I ate nothing but corn for a year I&apos;d likely die of pellagra. If I ate nothing but apples I&apos;d get sick too. Does that mean apples are bad? No, it means I&apos;m a dumb a$$. If I drink copious amounts of alcohol I&apos;ll get poisoning. That doesn&apos;t mean large bottles of liquor shouldn&apos;t be sold. People need to take responsibility for their lives. Eating a McDonalds hamburger now and then is not actually bad for you at all, so long as you are eating a variety of things and get your recommended 30 minutes of activity a day. Enjoy your cheeseburger and Coke. Alarmists who insist on treating us like children should be laughed at. ... more info I&apos;ve watched this countless times and I think it&apos;s great! 
This is a good documentary-type film and I&apos;ve already seen it more than a few times. I have to say though, despite all the warnings about fast food, will the average person really listen? I would like to believe that it is true, but common sense tells me otherwise. This country is full of people who just don&apos;t care, really; if most people you know do some sort of drug, whether it&apos;s smoking, drinking (including coffee) or anything harder, then why would an average person care about the fat and sugar in fast food? Also, it&apos;s very disconcerting to note the average attitude about fatty meats -- most men don&apos;t want to give that sort of thing up, it&apos;s part of the machismo image thing, and very self-centred. What these men and women who don&apos;t care don&apos;t want to admit though, is that&apos;s why there is so much disease! If people didn&apos;t eat this way then we wouldn&apos;t have to worry as much about horrid diseases. As a vegetarian, I promote kindness towards animals AND people, although the latter frustrate me to no avail to be honest, and I know for a fact that average people have a hostile attitude towards vegetarians and our way of life. It is as if they suffer from a lack of conscience, not only towards animals, but towards themselves and other human beings. Let me just say this: the more you resist a healthier eating lifestyle, the more disease and the ecosystem will continue to ravage; if this doesn&apos;t register with you, then perhaps you are one of those people who should have died out long ago according to Darwinian theory. If you look at it this way, this IS exactly what happens to people who eat too much junk in the end, or abuse their bodies with any sort of drug. Seems like justice is served in the end somehow. Self-destruction will find you out sooner or later.... more info Super Size Me 
Fantastic DVD. More people should see this and stop the fast food habit.
I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in protecting their health. Fast food is one of the worst things we can put in our bodies, unless we have a death wish, then go ahead and eat it! See the DVD, you will be glad you did.... more info You&apos;re missing the point 
All the naysayers are missing the point. Let me address each critique:

1) Who would be so stupid to believe that eating McDonald for a month is not unhealthy for you?

McDonald it seems. The reason for making this movie was the judge claiming that there was no proof that McDonald food (or food in general) could cause any physical problem. Besides McDonald worked hard to censore an article that suggested to limit McDonald foods.

2) Is this some sort of revelation? Are we supposed to be shocked that Mr. Spurlock gains weight and doesn&apos;t feel well after the month is over?

Apparently so, since McDonald and a judge declared there&apos;s no evidence food can make this to you. Hence the reason for making the movie.
Most of the value of the movie is not in the McDonald attack but in showing people that indeed you can cause your depression, weakness, tiredness, apathy, mood swings, irritability, migraine and much more with foods. Many people believe it&apos;s impossible for a wrong diet to cause problems and whenever they feel sick or chronically sick they blame genes or germs and gulp down pills. Not many believe that what you eat can make such a difference in your life and hence this movie is a real eye-opener.

My mother depression was caused by her diet. Once she started eating smaller portions, more often, an healthy protein and an healthy carb, healthy fats and dropped the sweets and sugars and processed food her diagnosed manic-depressive-compulsive depression disappeared completely. But she just laughed at me when I suggested that the way she ate was causing her sickness ... until she saw this movie and made the choice to change her diet.

The most important scene in the movie is the way school students on an healthier diet feel and function. No one can deny the eye-opening effect of such clearly explained information.

3) No one is forcing people to eat at McDonald, it&apos;s their choice!

An important aspect of the movie is how McDonald food is addictive for the brain causing dependency at which point it becomes a drive you have no control upon. If you miss your dose you feel sick. So people might say &quot;I will just have one&quot; but they found out they can&apos;t control their impulses to have more. Such effect (expecially from sugar rich foods) has been demonstrated on the medical literature.

4) Exercise makes the difference.

There&apos;s no way exercising can bypass the damage caused by a wrong diet.
If you knew someone who ate lot of McDonald and exercised and was healthy and slim it just means you were dealing with a fast-metabolizer probably young person who had a system strong enough to deal with such massive junk overload and nutritional deficiencies. Eventually comes the last straw that breaks the camel&apos;s back and from there it&apos;s all downhill. Besides being in high school and slim and exercising doesn&apos;t mean being healthy. A lot of people call themselves healthy but suffer from a lot of food-related issues like mood-swings, tiredness, indigestion, stomachace, chronic headache, nausea and so on.

5) They could choose healthier foods when eating at McDonald

Another important aspect of the movie is how the healthier alternatives are not that healthier but filled with hidden fats or extra sugars. Even the salad are not that healthier.

Going back to point two it is easy to see that many people might be mislead to eat McDonald foods ignoring it causes neuroendocrinological dependence and believing to be safe by choosing the healthier options.
Hence it&apos;s right to consider them victims of misinformation, misleading compaigns and poor food quality. If we can agree on this we can agree that this movie is indeed useful.

I have bought this movie to show it to as many people as possible, not to demonstrate that McDonald is unhealthy but that food can indeed makes the difference between health or sickness, between feeling radiant or feeling miserable.... more info A real eye-opener 
I teach lifestyle changes for a weight loss clinic in my community and have used excerpts from Morgan Spurlock&apos;s &quot;Supersize Me&quot; as an attention getter when we talk about eating out. It&apos;s a real eye-opener for many of our clients AND some of our staff. ... more info For my library. 
My personal trainer recommended I watch &quot;Super Size Me.&quot; I rented it and was so pleased. I knew it had to become part of my library, so I bought it. I look forward to seeing it over and over. There is so much nutritional and health advice in the movie. You can see the exceptional results of healthy school lunches. Consequences, both good and bad, of eating habits are impresively shown over and over.... more info It&apos;ll make you want to skip fast food for the rest of your life! (if not eating all together...) 
This unusual quasi-documentary takes you on a gastronomical journey into the world of McDonalds food and its effects on the human body. Imagine eating nothing but McDonalds fast-food for an entire month, and whenever you are asked if you want to &quot;super-size it&quot; you are obligated to do so and to eat the whole meal! That&apos;s the premis of one man&apos;s personal experiment shown on this movie.

Come along as you see the effects of a constant, unrestricted McDonalds diet on a healthy man&apos;s body.

The film making is not particularly good, and the acting (such as it is - not really acting by an actor) is adequate, but the results and message are stunning! Our fast-food diet habits (among other things) are producing an unhealthily obese population - one that we are actually exporting as soon as we can get other nations to buy into it.

Watching this film may well be one of the best diet supplements out there.

I was simultaneously attracted and repulsed by what I saw, kind of like rubber-necking as you drive past a serious automobile accident, but this is no accident, and it affects all of us.

I think that the entire nation should take a good look at this movie, its message, and then get decide to step off of the fast-food merry-go-round (and rounder, and rounder!).

FYI - You should be prepared for a smattering of language and some dialog that may not be suitable for children.

5 stars for the message and 3 stars for the movie quality, resulting in a 4-star overall rating!... more info Super Size Me 
This movie makes you think about what we are doing to our bodies by eating all this junk. Because of this we eat very little fast food.... more info Fast truth 
If you eat fast food on a regular basis you better buy this DVD. IT MAY SAVE YOUR LIFE !... more info No more fast-food! 
This is a real eye opening film into the unhealthy world of fast-food! Everyone should see it!!... more info Super Size Me 
The DVD condition was perfect; the film was a documentary about fast-food restaurants. I watched the first few minutes and that was all I could stand. Guess it&apos;s good to wake folks up to the damages fast food can do to the body.... more info America, and soon the world is on the down-ward-slope 
Some people don&apos;t know that fast food is not good for you, and some do. Other people just don&apos;t know how unhealthy fast food is. This documentary shocks people not only in what he is doing but FACTS that are going on in the US.

Some rules that were set that they set in the start of the movie:

1. He MUST eat everything that he orders. (even the condiments and toppings that are added)
2. He MUST Supper Size if they ask
3. He will eat McD&apos;s for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
4. He will have to walk what the average American walks in a day. (1 mile or less a day)
5. Lastly he can&apos;t exercise (the average American doesn&apos;t exercise).

In the start he is at the peak condition for his age range. He asks three doctors what they can expect through the duration of this experiment. Pay very close attention to what they will say, also pay very close attention to what they say through out the experiment.

Yea, many Americans don&apos;t eat fast food for all three meals, also he is not trying to bring down McD&apos;s. He doesn&apos;t even show an answer for what to do at the end. The purpose of the film is to raise attention about the epidemic of nutrition deficiency, and for you to make up your own answers using your best judgment.
... more info Super Size Me 
Notwithstanding a veiled reference to reduced sexual function as a result of this lethal diet, the film is a timely and appropriate object lesson for us all, and most especially, for our kids. Spurlock&apos;s clever side commentaries on McDonald&apos;s history and the problem of obesity in America are every bit as informative and alarming as the daily spectacle of watching him pack on pounds and come dangerously close to liver failure. &quot;Supersize Me&quot; is never preachy and doesn&apos;t have to be: Spurlock&apos;s transformation speaks volumes in itself.... more info A MUST Watch for Everyone! 
Its time for us Americans to take responsibility for our actions, especially what we put in our mouths and how it affects our bodies. THis movie will make you think twice about what you eat and definitely makes its point. Let&apos;s take care of our bodies and live healthy, its the only one we have.... more info Amazing video! 
You will find this video hard to believe. Check out this very healthy young man&apos;s decline to a near fatal health condition in a few short weeks from a steady diet of McDonald&apos;s fast food. Three doctors measure his vitals from beginning to end - very entertaining and convicting!... more info the barbecue fire is calling me! 
This film was shot to illustrate how dangerous over eating burgers etc might be but after watching it, it just made me wanna eat a big juicy burger even more:) i ordered double whopper menu and enjoyed the guilty pleasure of calories...long live burger king!!!... more info After a while it was just making me hungry for &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; 
I think that the guy who made this movie was trying to be like Micheal Moore in that he was trying to bring down &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; in a very sensationalist and dramatic way. I think that a 20 minute expose on the health value and marketing strategies of &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; would be sufficient to bring forward the points he was trying to make, but a full-length movie on the subject was too much for me. After a while it was just making me hungry for &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot;.

By the way, I love &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot;. I understand that it is a big capitolist money-making machine that markets junk food to children. However, they do have healthy foods on the menu such as chicken salad. They also raise money for children with cancer. Every month or so I just have to fill my craving for a Big Mac, a Fish Filet or an Egg McMuffin.

My belief in healthy eating has to with moderation. of course, as the movie makes clear, eating &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; every day is bad for your health. But I don&apos;t think there&apos;s anything wrong with taking the family out to &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; every other month or so, especially if your on a road trip.

This is not the kind of movie that you&apos;ll want to buy and watch over and over again. I would rent it and stop at &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; on your way back to returning it. ... more info One of my faves 
I bought this DVD because I had heard it was really good, and I was certainly not let down! It really opened my eyes as to just how terrible fast food is and what lack of nutritional education is doing to adults and children. I would recommend this film to anyone!... more info Good Message, Bad Methodology 
The message that obesity in America is reaching epidemic proportions is good, but blaming the fast food industry for the entire problem is a false premise. Has fast food added to the problem? Certainly, but there are other factors at work too.

The film does not provide any answers, other than to ban fast food, nor does it look at some very basic questions. Why has fast food grown to the point it has in America? Is it because we don&apos;t get to spend as much time at home? Is it because so many families are now 2 income earners? Had he spent time on these questions, in addition to the question of fast food, we might get some solutions.

Finally, he could have made his argument in a less dramatic way. Hurling out a window after stuffing yourself with a huge meal is not the way most Americans eat and it was most likely done strictly for theatrical reasons.

To sum up, the message is good, but the way it was delivered left a lot to be desired
... more info Super Size Me DVD 
When I received this movie, my oldest son and I watched the Super Size Me movie and it was terrific. We now understand how fast food affects our bodies and how really bad it is for us. After watching this, we no longer eat at ANY fast food restaurants. We value our bodies and what goes in them. I want to say thank you for making this movie, it needed to be brought to everyone&apos;s attention.... more info WOW! 
Fantastic documentary! Really thought-provoking and effective. Did not expect it to affect my kids so much- as young as 5-years old...... more info Great Movie To Watch At The Beginning Of A Healthier Diet But... 
Wow, this movie is a must see for people who don&apos;t know that fat is unattractive and bad for their health, McDonald&apos;s food is fattening especially if eaten in very large quantities and large corporations like McDonalds don&apos;t really care about their customers and are just out to make money! For the rest of us who were fortunate enough to all ready have this knowledge, SUPER SIZE ME really is an unnecessary movie useful perhaps,as a motivator while beginning or in the midst of a healthier eating lifestyle. The movie is very heavy handed in pounding the rather obvious point that a steady diet of McDonlds is not good. And is there a law that documentary filmmakers who are the subjects of their own films have to be insufferably smug and obnoxious? If so Morgan Spurlock fulfills this law to a nicety with some help from his vegan chef girlfriend who in a cringe inducing manner has to tell us more than we could ever want to know about her boyfriend&apos;s sex life on the Micky D diet. And though McDonald&apos;s may exploit and addict their overweight customers, Spurlock is also quite cruel to the obese with his lingering shots of their midsections and rears. Spurlock briefly discusses the problems with fast food restaurants in general but McDonalds is obviously his main target.... more info Mc Donalds 
I will never eat Mc Donalds again. This is not a slick film, but it is real and shows the ups and downs of this type of project. It is clear that anyone who eats this type of food for every meal is a nutter. What about a sequel though run over the course of a year? On second thoughts don&apos;t, I don&apos;t want someone&apos;s death on my conscience.... more info Great Movie 
This movie is especially important to be viewed by families who have small children on up, a real reality check on American eatting habits. ... more info Good, sometimes manipulative 
Manipulative documentary in the vein of the Michael Moore pieces. Sure it has a noble mission, but beyond offering factoids about nutrition and the guy&apos;s 30-day weight gain experiment and the type of crap corporate America offering people to eat (nobody is forcing people to eat fries from the caf every day, but how many people really take bagged lunches to work?) it doesn&apos;t offer too much. Naturally, the documentary maker&apos;s vegetarian girlfriend is given screen time to preach about how wrong it is to eat junk food.

Taking the moral high ground - check. Throwing up after eating a huge fast food meal - check. Waiting it out until a corporate spokesman says something embarassing, then capitalising on the soundbite - check. Giving the impression of impartiality by showing a guy who eats a Big Mac every day (without fries) but is not overweight or suffering from poor nutrition - check.

Of course he deals briefly with the stupidity of people who are overweight and still eat regularly at these kinds of places, but it would have been more interesting to me if the whole movie had focussed on this. Now THAT would have been a funny &quot;documentary.&quot;... more info Good introduction to how they&apos;re making us dumber and dumber 
Perfect gift for the fast-food addict friend o his birthday! Show him you really care.
The only reason we put up with endless, mindless war, and the criminals in DC taking 10 billion a month from generations to come for a war that&apos;s only for profit (as usual), is that we eat crap like this. It makes us stupid. There&apos;s a definite connection between what we eat and why we&apos;re so gullible.
Some of that connection can be found here, and with some laughs. If people only knew what&apos;s really going into their bodies...
You are what you eat.... more info Super Five Me 
Very solid documentary, which exposed the obesity epidemic in this country being exascerbated by bad eating habits and various corporations in the food industry.
As Morgan Sperlok put it, &quot;We are eating ourselves to death&quot; and why someone would voluntarily ingest very toxic and addictive foods is beyond me.
Open my eyes up to making a concerted effort to eat healthier foods.... more info Super Size Me Movie 
I was very disappointed in this movie. It was listed as a PG movie. My son was getting it for a class project. When we got it in the mail it was a PG-13. We watched it and I couldn&apos;t believe the bad language. It also talked about sex and drugs. I couldn&apos;t believe they put it on the internet as a PG. Even as PG-13 it was very dissappointing.... more info Everyone should watch 
Every parent, teenager, teacher, doctor, etc. should see this one. Yes, we have all heard it before, but not documented to this extent. It is one man&apos;s experiment but quite eye-opening. I wish the little bit of bad language and couple of &quot;gross&quot; scenes had been left out, but I have heard there is a family friendly version coming that could also be shown in schools. ... more info Useful Documentary 
Fast Paced and just brutal to the junk food industry. This is news you can use and rally behind. If you heed the knowledge being imparted in this film you&apos;ll save yourself much grief and untold thousands of dollars in medical expenses. I&apos;ve been bitten hard by this and lived to tell the tale. You can use this film to help you avoid those junk food cravings and to reaffirm why you&apos;ve chosen to eat healthily. In that regard I view it as a &apos;must&apos; purchase. If you still eat junk food you need this film even more to help you quit because you know not what damage you are doing to yourself. Fantastic buy !... more info An Informed Choice 
Documentary meister, Morgan Spurlock, goes to extremes. `Super Size Me&apos; captures what it&apos;s like to eat nothing but McDonald&apos;s food for thirty days. Sporting a set of stated rules, Spurlock`s &quot;ridiculous diet,&quot; as his personal physician quips, jump starts a fault finding mission with the world&apos;s largest fast food retailer. Armed with testimonials, statistics, and nutritional information, Spurlock also provides counter contrasts to compare with his extreme situation. He does show that McDonald&apos;s food is appetizing, except for a couple of scenes that make us want to wretch, including one that&apos;s over the top. Nevertheless, he does try to capture a spokesperson from the franchise to talk to him, and he does admirably offer us a better bill of fare at a school cafeteria in Appleton, WI.

The variety of aspects he approaches his topic is skillful and informative fun. Spurlock and company deserve a lot of credit. &apos;Super Size Me&apos; starts and ends framed by a famous lawsuit, and although the results are mostly known, I won&apos;t spoil the results, except to say that I enjoyed the outcome. For all of us, healthy and unhealthy living is sometimes a matter of choice. Fortunately, with Morgan Spurlock, it is an informed choice. ... more info Suprisingly entertaining 
I kept hearing this was good, so I got the dvd. The title&amp;idea sound boring but it was fun&amp;informative. Makes you think twice about some bad habits we have.... more info Excellent 
Morgan Spurlock is everything Michael Moore pretends to be as a documentarian. I recently caught his documentary Super Size Me at a budget theater&amp;hope the DVD will have many features. For those who don&apos;t know SSM is the best political documentary this year- far better than MM&apos;s lamentable Fahrenheit 9/11.
Both films have baddies- W. Bush&amp;McDonald&apos;s, both have their filmmakers as stars- MM&amp;MS, but MS has a few things going for him that MM doesn&apos;t- 1) a penchant for being honest, 2) a message that affects all his viewers,&amp;3) a sense of self-deprecation. He demonstrates this by deciding to guinea pig his health in testing whether or not McDonald&apos;s fast food is really bad for you. He vows to eat nothing but McDonald&apos;s for 1 month straight.
He starts off with a routine physical exam- which shows him to be in above average physical shape for a man I&apos;d reckon is in his early 30s. His month-long odyssey will take him across the country,&amp;to the brink of serious health issues. This is all documented by a cardiologist, gastroenterologist, internist, nutritionist/dietician,&amp;physical trainer- not to mention his vegan chef girlfriend, Alexandra Jamieson, whose almost self-parodically the typical bored white girl with no better cause to be for.... All in all Super Size Me is a terrific film that entertains&amp;enlightens. Can someone eat healthily at a McDonald&apos;s? Not really- but the point has gotten to the point that that&apos;s not really the point. The point is this can kill you as slowly&amp;surely as cigarets, alcohol,&amp;drug abuse. Here&apos;s hoping that MS becomes as big a name as MM, so that he will be able to tackle a varied subject palette. While MM is all windy style over substance MS shows that substance has its adherents too- you just have to remember to pass the gas.
... more info Biased Propaganda 
I watched this movie because I was told how much of an &quot;eye-opening&quot; experience it would be. The only thing I saw, that apparently those who laud this movie&apos;s praises can&apos;t, is that generally, people do not continue to eat when they begin to throw up. But not this guy...no, he&apos;s hell-bent on proving a point, even if his biased tactics negate the very point he claims he is trying to make. He probably could&apos;ve done the same thing by eating in excess liver or brussel sprouts or something else he dislikes. Anything in excess is bad for you. Anything you don&apos;t like that you eat in excess will likely make you throw up. Anything eaten in excess to the exclusion of anything else will have negative effects on your body over an extended period of time. How many people REALLY eat three full meals a day at a fast food restaurant, EVERY DAY for a month straight AND continue to eat that food after they begin vomitting?!?!?! The whole movie is propaganda b.s. and i/m/o anyone who tries to claim it&apos;s &quot;prophetic&quot; is simply refusing to acknowledge it is nothing more than &quot;pathetic.&quot; ... more info Shock&amp;Awe Diet ! 
This is a personal testimonial to shock and awe the fast food population. He is so brave to test on McDiet 3 times a day for 30 days and evaluate the effect and impact on his body, vital organs and function in an unqualified unscientific experiment.

Fast food industry such as McDonald is an American free market success story in offering a popular meal fast, inexpensive and tasty not from your local kitchen but from the factory headquarter with one standard formula.

Who patronize the fast food? Who can resist the temptation of a smiling clown of Ronald McDonald and the playground with cheap toys? Who super-size your order and punch your vital organs with pounds of sugar and other &quot;junk&quot; leading to health-care crisis? Who are jointly and severally liable to the damages?

The fast food industry grows fast in other third world countries. Will the foreigners
blame US for getting American diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney problem, heart trouble, over-weight and cancer?

This film reminds us the goodness of slow home cooking grandma used to make.

WARNING: Eating fast food die-t can be habit forming and hazardous to your health!
... more info hilarious! 
This documentary is just hilarious! We&apos;d seen it before, and hubby loves it so I bought it for him. Great if you need a giggle.... more info Super Size Me, Indeed. 
My wife and I watched the &quot;Super Size Me&quot; DVD last night. It was the third time we watched it and we enjoyed it very much. Let&apos;s face it, Fast Food is a major facet of the American Culture. It&apos;s everywhere. Within five miles of our house there are &quot;McDonalds&quot; (2), &quot;Jack in the Box&quot;(3), &quot;Karl&apos;s Jr.&quot; (2), &quot;Wendy&apos;s&quot;(2), &quot;Rubio&apos;s,&quot; &quot;Burger King,&quot; &quot;Arby&apos;s,&quot; &quot;El Polo Loco,&quot; &quot;Taco Bell,&quot; &quot;KFC,&quot; &quot;Subway&quot;(4) and about a half-dozen local Mexican Taco Shops. No matter what road you take, there&apos;s fast food readily available. Yum. Some of it is actually quite good and I confess to eating at some of the places now and then. My personal favorites are &quot;El Polo Loco,&quot; &quot;Subway&quot; and a couple of the Mexican Taco Shops. Actually, if you know what you&apos;re doing, you can get a reasonably healthful meal. And, of course, it&apos;s real fast and oh so convenient. The trick is that you shouldn&apos;t do it too often. Did I mention that it&apos;s real fast and convenient? Did I mention that some of the items are rather good and tasty? Did I mention that the food is so easily available and inexpensive?

The problem is, as I see it, most people have no idea what they&apos;re doing. The nutritional knowledge of the average American is practically nil. They select almost exclusively on taste and they are greatly swayed by the ubiquitous advertising. Furthermore, they&apos;re always rushed and need something that can be grabbed and consumed quickly. If you&apos;re such a person, and that&apos;s most of us, you probably aren&apos;t paying real close attention and you&apos;re going to end up with food that is very high in fat, sugars and sodium, none of which are particularly good for you, and you&apos;ll be very low in vitamins and fiber. The next question might be, How often do you do this? Once a month? Once a week? Every day? Almost all the time? Well, I think you&apos;re entering into a situation where you&apos;re going to be ill some of the time, much of the time or all of the time. Best of luck.

We try to avoid fast food as much as possible and be highly selective when we indulge. It&apos;s a tough task. We almost never go into McDonald&apos;s, except for coffee which is actually quite good. Go figure. Well, &quot;Super Size Me&quot; picks on McDonald&apos;s and the attack is pretty devastating. It&apos;s a lot of fun, also. I love this movie. The jist of it is that Morgan Spurlock decides to eat exclusively at McDonald&apos;s for a month. Every day. Every meal. Even water. He is monitored by three doctors and a nutritionist and they record his progressive and dramatic deterioration. By the time he&apos;s halfway through his experiment, he&apos;s already in serious trouble with warnings from his doctors. At the end of the month, his blood pressure is high, his cholesterol is high and he&apos;s gained 24.5 pounds, among other things. It&apos;s really eye opening, and Spurlock is a fun character to watch. It&apos;s a fun movie to watch, but it&apos;s deadly serious. Let&apos;s face it, this is a film that should be required viewing for all people who indulge in fast food. We&apos;ve watched several times, and every time our intake of fast foods is down dramatically over the next six months.

Gary Peterson... more info Super sized eye opener 
The information provided by the DVD Super Size Me was so incredible that I have shared it with my students. It has changed the way that I eat and conduct my everyday activities. ... more info Do you want to lose weight? Watch this documentary. 
Yes. We all know that McDonald&apos;s is bad for us. And yes, this is a little bit like telling smokers that they are killing themselves. We know. That&apos;s not really what I like about this movie, even though it does take great pains to dissect the marketing campaigns and food production aspects of McDonald&apos;s.

What makes this movie important is the fact that it made me paranoid enough about the food I eat (and I keep kosher so I don&apos;t eat at McDonald&apos;s anyhow) to lose 20 pounds. I don&apos;t mean that I turned anorexic. I mean that I actually counted calories, refrained from greasy food, drank more water and ate fruits and vegetables. Spurlock purposefully ate garbage for a month and gained 24 pounds. I used to do it without thinking about it and then figured that my clothes were shrinking in the wash. It didn&apos;t happen in 30 days. It happened over the course of a year but all the things that happened to him happened to me. Chest pains. Lost sex drive. High blood pressure.

Right now I&apos;m still overweight but I&apos;m much healthier than I&apos;ve been in a long time and I owe it to this movie.... more info Premise is overdone, but Spurlock is competing with a million McDonalds ads... 
Yes, the premise of shoving nothing but Mickey D&apos;s food down your throat is overdone, but that&apos;s to get your attention. Keep in mind it needs to compete with the fast food media blitz. How many fast food ads have you watched since you learned how to turn on the television?

What parents and teachers need to pay close attention to is the section on school lunches. First note the fast food and government subsidized swill many kids lunch off of. Next, note the school which is filled with the reject kids from other schools - discipline problems and the like - which gives the kids home-made snacks and lunches heavy on the fruits veggies and whole grains and anything with refined sugar is banned. The kids pay attention better in class, there is hardly any of the rowdy horseplay that is seen as &quot;typcial&quot; teenage behavior, and the teachers say it is all because of the change in the kids&apos; diet. In addition, this school lunch program is no more expensive than the others.

Adults can eat what they want, but our kids should be eating what is good for them and will help them stay calm and learn. Seems like a no-brainer to me. If I ever have kids I&apos;ll treat the sugar and junk food like the booze cigarettes and drugs - it will have no place in my child&apos;s life. ... more info Only slightly entertaining, and worthless as a documentary 
Before I saw this &quot;documentary&quot;, I wondered &quot;what&apos;s the point?&quot; I have been hearing about how bad fast food is for you since I was in grade school (the 1980&apos;s), and people have been complaining about McDonalds advertising to children for as long as I can remember. Super Size Me is about 90 minutes of &quot;fast food is bad for you&quot; and &quot;food companies are evil and they sell stuff to children&quot;. So to make a long story short, there is mostly nothing new here, other than the creator&apos;s &quot;Jackass&quot;-style stunt of eating nothing but McDonalds for 30 days. As a documentary, &quot;Super Size Me&quot; is completely worthless.

The only redeeming quality that this movie has is the low-brow comedy of watching Morgan Spurlock stuff himself until he vomits and bend over backwards to eat nothing but food that is bad for him. (Spurlock&apos;s loony vegan girlfriend provides some unintentional comedy, but I refuse to get him credit for that). His stunt has absolutely no educational value, since he never even bothers to drink a diet Coke instead of a regular Coke. He proves that if you purposely set out to gain a lot of weight and destroy your body, you can gain a lot of weight and destroy your body. Does anyone watching this movie really think that anyone out there eats three square meals a day of fast food? Even the fattest people?

Interlaced with short diaries of his horrible 30-day diet are short clips of exploring the American obesity epidemic. They are mostly anecdotal and extremely low on facts. During these clips, he slobbers all over a Left Wing law professor who advises trial lawyers, demonizes Sodexho, and demonizes all American food companies. Has this guy not been to a grocery store in 20 years? The shelves are loaded with diet drinks, low-fat cheese, low-fat hot dogs, low-fat milk, low-fat TV dinners, low-fat chips, low-fat ice cream, low-fat beef -- you name it. Clearly, there is more at work in this epidemic than fattening food, but there is almost no attention given to other factors in this video. He briefly mentions that kids aren&apos;t getting enough exercise nowadays, but only spends a few minutes on the topic.

Morgan Spurlock never comes right out and says it, but the message of this movie is &quot;Fast food companies and food manufacturers commit murder and they get away with it because they spend tons of money on advertising and lobbyists&quot;. In that way, this film is its own form of political junk food.... more info Interesting film on the state of nutrition in America 
Morgan Spurlock&apos;s film is based on an experiment that uses himself as a guinea pig in which he ingests nothing but food and beverages sold by McDonald&apos;s for 30 days to see the results. Spurlock is a healthy man in his early 30&apos;s who - prior to this film - has eaten a healthy diet, maintained a healthy weight, and gotten plenty of exercise on a regular basis. He is embarking on this experiment because apparently McDonald&apos;s has made the claim that you could eat their food daily as part of a healthy diet. Spurlock&apos;s rules are he can eat nothing but McDonald&apos;s food for 30 days, he must eat three meals a day, and if asked if he wants to supersize something he must always say yes. On top of this, he simultaneously cuts back on his exercise to be something corresponding to what the average American gets. Also, though not part of his official rules, he never orders a salad or bottled water. He always goes right for the greasiest food offered. It should be obvious to anyone that this is not what McDonald&apos;s meant in their press release as Spurlock goes on a month long fast food binge. At least part of the results were not that startling to me. If you are over thirty and you do this to yourself, even for just a month, you should expect to gain a lot of weight and feel awful - which he does. He gains about ten percent of his original body weight over the month. What did surprise me was that the diet did so much damage to his internal organs so quickly. Spurlock&apos;s blood pressure shot up, he began to show signs of liver damage, and all of his blood tests frightened his doctor so much that he told him to go to the emergency room if he should begin to experience shooting pains in the middle of the night.

Actually, Spurlock&apos;s experiment doesn&apos;t take up probably more than half the film. A large part of the documentary is spent talking about the state of nutrition in America, focusing particularly on the food served in the public schools. He visits several typical public schools in which kids can order anything they want at the cafeteria, have ready access to candy and soda via vending machines in the halls, and have greatly reduced physical education classes due to budget constraints and, although not mentioned, quite probably the greater emphasis on teaching to the standardized tests that students have to take in most states that takes up a great deal of school time. For contrast, Spurlock visits a school in Wisconsin for troubled kids in which organic food is served and notes that the behavior problems in these children is vastly reduced, most likely the result of this diet. This part of the film really made me think. I&apos;m almost fifty, and when I was a child in public school we had to eat a balanced diet if we ordered one from the cafeteria, had limited access to desserts, and had no vending machines. There were no soft drinks served at lunch - only milk, iced tea, and water. Finally, we had daily P.E. classes in which we all had a period of mandatory calisthenics. I also remember that obese children were a rarity, and now if you look around they seem to be everywhere. Spurlock doesn&apos;t limit himself to examining the health habits of children, though. He also points out how the portion sizes in restaurants have grown tremendously and so have the waistlines of adults. Spurlock does come across one very interesting human oddity of an exception that proves the rule. This fellow has been eating an average of three Big Macs a day for years, is obviously in at least his late 30&apos;s or maybe even 40&apos;s, and is as thin as a rail. I&apos;d love to find out if this behavior ever catches up with him.

Basically, Spurlock&apos;s experiment on himself is used as a kind of Frankenstein horror tale to hold your interest while he talks about the crisis brewing in America from a combination of bad eating habits and greatly reduced physical activity. He doesn&apos;t seem to have any answers, though. People have to work longer hours to pay the bills, giving little time for exercise and home-cooked meals, and public education budgets have gotten tighter. The high price of housing has meant people with families live further from the center of cities in order to find affordable homes in safe neighborhoods and thus spend more time in traffic and less time walking. Since Spurlock himself is living the life of a single guy in New York City with no family pressures and can walk to the office every day, he would probably have a difficult job seeing that for many people just recognizing this problem isn&apos;t enough to solve it. However, it is a start.... more info ok...they forced me to watch it in school! but ive seen it before then 
this movie was good the first time but after that it turned REALLY anoying really fast...... more info Sweet land of liberty!!! 
I get it; as a matter of fact, we all get it, you&apos;re not supposed to eat fast food all the time. And I really don&apos;t think anyone can! Personally, I loved this movie, but I don&apos;t think it had a realistic premise. We all know fast food is a bad diet choice. Unfortunately; the hectic schedule faced by most working Americans these days has elevated the viability of the fast food diet. So it&apos;s not surprising that Mr. Spurlock got sick following McDonalds dietary lead. What was alarming though was the rate at which Mr. Spurlock&apos;s body started to deteriorate; his doctor was visibly shaken and that&apos;s scary. And although this may not be a scientific analysis, there seems to be a direct correlation between busy lives, sleep deprivation, fast food and obesity. In the end, Super Size Me is fun to watch and if you read Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser and/or watch Super Size Me, or both, you may never eat a happy meal again. You&apos;ve been warned!... more info Gratuitous coarseness mars an otherwise clever movie 
The problem of overweight and its related health issues is a very important topic that is often discussed, but the real effects of our society&apos;s love affair with fast food is hardly ever driven home. Super Size Me provides a visceral demonstration of these ill effects.

Director Morgan Spurlock undertakes a challenge of supersize proportions. He will survive solely on McDonald&apos;s food for 1 month. Against the recommendation of his doctors, mother, and girlfriend, he lives the next 30 days eating McD&apos;s for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. If the cashier asks if he would like to, he will super size his meals.

What follows is a medical marvel as his body condition degrades so severely that his doctors beg him to stop his experiment. He puts on almost 25 pounds, he suffers chest pains, and among other ailments his sex life drops to zero. The clear message is that fast food is bad stuff.

In between his gorging and palpitating he presents statistics and other &apos;facts&apos; to show how the fast food industry fights tooth and nail to get customers while they are young and also against government intrusion into their business. The industry is painted in a very bad light, not that you needed to be told that.

So why the low score? The problem with this movie is evident almost from the start when Morgan throws up out his car window after downing a double quarter pounder with cheese meal, supersized. For the benefit of the viewer who would never have seen vomit before, Spurlock gets a nice long shot of the mess.

Another instance is the stomach stapling procedure. He choreographs the surgery in all its bloody g(l)ory to the Blue Danube waltz. Nothing is spared to the imagination. The squeamish are encrouaged to stay away.

I understand why he wants to do this. He needs to drive home the point that fast food is disgusting, but his heavy handed use of this type of grotesque imagery is a weakness rather than a benefit to the movie. The movie would have been just as powerful without this sort of thing.

In all, the movie has some really good points to make, but he is simply not skilled enough to bring the whole picture into view in the way a more skillful propaganda-documentarist like Michael Moore is able. 3 stars.... more info
