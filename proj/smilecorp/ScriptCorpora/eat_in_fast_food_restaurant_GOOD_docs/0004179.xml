Wai Ying Fast Food in Binondo, Manila

I am a big fan of Chinese food and I love dimsum A LOT. But, my desire to roam the streets of Binondo in Manila to taste the most authentic Chinese cooking/cuisines was heightened the night my mother brought home the best dimsum soup and siomai I’ve ever tasted.

I’ve asked a couple of my friends who are familiar with the Chinese restaurants in Binondo because my mom forgot the name of the restaurant. When my mom and I were at Divisoria last November, we decided to head over to Binondo and she’ll just try to remember where it was located.

After almost an hour of looking for the restaurant, the pedicab driver finally led us to Wai Ying Fast Food . As soon as my mother saw the front of this Chinese food joint, she immediately exclaimed we’re at the right place. Finally, I thought. I was already hungry. 

 

 Wai Ying Fast Food is a two-storey restaurant at Buenavidez Street in Binondo , right across Manila Chinatown Hotel. Wai Ying has been around for over a decade and they are very popular in Chinatown. 

At the very entrance, you’d see ducks and chickens being roasted by the window. They have a mini kitchen at the entrance so you can actually see them preparing food.

If you want a relaxing dining experience, you might not completely enjoy at Wai Ying’s. They’re just a small Chinese fast food restaurant. So, if you’re planning on bringing friends along with you, prepare to wait for tables or head on upstairs for more tables.

Anyway, as soon as we were handed the menu, it was funny to see my mother ordering away. So, we ended up with around seven (7) different dimsum dishes and other plates of Chinese food. 

First, we ordered 2 cold Lemon Tea (Php 50). It was really refreshing, especially after what we went through looking for Wai Ying all over Binondo (sorry, I can’t get over it ). The lemon slices and the genuine taste of tea made it one of my fave iced lemon teas.

 

Oh, by the way, while I was taking photos of the menu, the guy who was waiting on our table approached me and gave me a copy of their menu. Nice, eh? They’ve got very accommodating staff, even during that very busy lunch hour.

 

 
 
 

Now, on to our orders. First is Wai Ying’s Siomai . You get 4 pieces for only Php 60.00. I’ve tasted a lot of siomai in the past and Wai Ying’s is now on top of my favorites. I love how firm their siomai is and its meatiness. You would really feel it when you bite into each siomai. The shrimp’s crunch and the mushroom bits give the siomai texture you’d really enjoy. 

Too bad we didn’t order more for takeout. We forgot because we ordered a lot of food for the two of us. .

Next is their Beef Balls (Php 55.00). You get 3 medium-sized beef balls. I so loved them! Soft, very tasty and beefylicious! It was the first thing my mom ordered’cause she remembered how good it was.

 

We also ordered Shark’s Fin Dumpling . We got 4 pieces for Php 60.00. This is actually one of my favorite dimsum dishes. Again, Wai Ying’s is now on top of my favorites. No need to dip their dimsum on any sauces. They’re very tasty.

 

Of course, we ordered their Hakaw (4 pieces for Php 65.00). 

The shells / wrappers were thin and soft. But, to my surprise, they didn’t stick or break while I was picking them up with my chopsticks (oh, I’m learning!) like most of the other hakaw I’ve had before. You see inside, it’s packed with real whole prawn. I love the crunch I got while biting into them. I wanted to order another set, but backed out considering we still had a lot of orders coming. 

My main order was Wai Ying’s Roasted Duck Fried Rice (Php 150.00). Oh, I loved it! The sauce was thick and had the right amount of sweetness that was simply appetizing. I was forced to eat rice .

 

We had a separate order of fried rice for my mom. Priced at Php 70.00, it’s good for 2 persons so I had to help my mom finish it (like it was really a burden eh? ). Nothing really special, but it was still good. There were green onion slices, bits of pork, eggs and shrimp mixed with the fried rice. No trace of oil even. The only thing I didn’t like was it wasn’t as warm as I wanted when it was served. But, still, I enjoyed it.

 

We also ordered their Chiu-Chao Dumplings (Php 55.00). I didn’t enjoy it that much because I don’t like any kind of nuts mixed in my food.

 

We also tried their Kutchai Dumplings (Php 55.00). This one, I enjoyed. I loved the flavors brought about by the garlic chives.

 

We also ordered Shrimp Chong Fan (Php 60.00). Chong Fan is steamed flat noodles. Wai Ying offers 4 variations of Chong Fan–plain, asado, shrimp and beef. The soy sauce mixed with a little sugar complemented the bland noodles filled with crunchy shrimp.

 

Last, we ordered half of Wai Ying’s Soy Chicken (Php 190) for takeout, as recommended by my mom’s colleague who absolutely loves this Chinese food joint. I only got to taste it at home. I had to heat it up in the microwave. It has this sour flavor and when I tasted it with the sauce that came with it (made with ginger, oil and green onions), it was so good I had to eat another cup of rice for dinner. Oh, too much for my no-rice diet, I tell yah! 

 

Our bill amounted to only Php 945 ! Pretty awesome, I tell yah, for a frugal like me. Very affordable indeed.

Overall, it’s pretty obvious that I love Wai Ying Fast Food . It’s now on top of my Chinese restaurants/food joints.

 ☻☻☻☻☻ 

 
 I give Wai Ying Fast Food 5 smileys . Yes! That’s how much I enjoyed dining at this Chinese food joint in Chinatown. Affordable prices, very tasty food, and accommodating waiting staff. Quick service, too! We’re going back next month with the whole family.
