Fast Food Concept

 By Harry Tan 
 
Traditionally, fast foods were meant to be consumed by those who are constantly on the go, always trying to beat the clock. Unlike your regular food, you don&apos;t have to wait for your order to be cooked. Your food will be served moments after your order has been placed.

The concept of fast food offers the food industry a more competitive edge. With food being served at a very fast pace, the output can be optimized and maximized at the same time. Though the operating hours of different eateries may vary, eateries would be most pack during lunch and dinner hours.

An eatery running on a traditional concept would lose out to fast food outlets in terms of output and capacity. Cutting down the time diners have to wait at a restaurant would maximize on the profit, with the assumption that the restaurant is at full-house capacity during these peak hours.

Most restaurants running on the traditional concept, where food is prepared only upon an order, are shifting towards the fast food concept little by little. So to speak, the food on top of a restaurant&apos;s menu would be prepared in advance even before the order is place, in order to hasten the overall process.

The most notable shift we can see is Starbucks. Traditionally, Starbucks would only prepare your drinks on the spot upon order. However, during peak hours, especially during breakfast, most of the more common drinks will be prior prepared in bulk.

Though a restaurant may not be classified as a fast food restaurant, the concept is slowly adopted at a wide scale to remain competitive.
