Milwaukee: The Broken Yolk
 The students at Marquette University are lucky to have a place like The Broken Yolk to go to for breakfast. We were here on a Sunday, and during the summer, so it was relatively quiet for our visit for breakfast, so we were probably able to get a better view of the menu and able to enjoy our meal in peace. Which after so many loud places that I have been to lately, it&apos;s such a treat.

When you first walk in, you need to go up to order and pay for your food like you would in a fast food restaurant. In looking at the menu for The Broken Yolk, there wasn&apos;t much that they had on their breakfast menu that you couldn&apos;t get anywhere else. However, they also had below the menu, a series of what appeared to be patron-inspired choices of what to get. And there were quite a few of them. There were so many choices that it was difficult to know what we wanted. To help us out, the cashier came up to us and asked us what we wanted to eat and perhaps he could point us in the right direction as to what to order. By this time, though, I had at least narrowed by selection down to two choices, #30 and #63 of the handwritten menu items. Those being a half order (two) of jalapeno pancakes and a half order of banana pancakes, the latter of those essentially to cover myself in case the jalapeno pancakes weren&apos;t as good as I thought they&apos;d be. To be fair, I have had jalapeno pancakes before--while on vacation to Scottsdale, Arizona--so I was fairly sure I&apos;d have no problem with my selection. However, the cashier did seem surprised that I had ordered the jalapeno pancakes, giving me an idea that these probably aren&apos;t a top selection for many people. And then, the cook came out after being given the order just to verify that I indeed did want the jalapeno pancakes. They asked me if I wanted the salsa with them as well, which they are supposed to come with, which I decided to turn down and went with just the jalapenos--this way, I could use syrup on them to cool them down, or moisten them, if I needed to.

Our pancakes came very quickly after we had found our table, and I started to devour the jalapeno pancakes. At first, I wondered exactly where the jalapeno would come in, as the first few bites didn&apos;t have any, but I needn&apos;t have worried, I found them soon enough. Now, were they as hot and spicy as the ones we had in Scottsdale? No, I can&apos;t say that they were, but then with jalapenos, you will often have different degrees of spiciness from pepper to pepper. And the ones in Scottsdale had a jalapeno-infused syrup for them, as well. Were they worth it? Yes, and I would recommend anyone in Milwaukee who likes jalapenos and spicy things to give these a try. Next up, the banana pancakes. While you can get banana pancakes at other places, I would have to say that these banana pancakes were among the best, if not the best, banana pancakes I have had. What would have made them better? Maybe some peanut butter to spread on top, or a banana butter. But again, maybe those things would have taken away from the banana pancakes themselves.

The one downside to the offerings at The Broken Yolk is the drink selection. Drinks come in bottles in a cooler beside the register. While for lunch, this might not be so bad, but for breakfast, it left much to be desired. Fortunately, they have water in a keg near the door which you can get as well, which is what we did.



Prices for The Broken Yolk are incredibly affordable. Half orders of the pancakes ran in the range of $2.50-3.50. So between the two of us there, we had three half orders of pancakes for about what it would cost one person to eat somewhere else. Definitely college-friendly prices here, or prices that fit in with the current economic climate even if you&apos;re not in college.

 Who Am I?

I am an average person who loves food. Okay, perhaps too much. I like trying new restaurants, new foods, new brands, new flavors, different grocery stores, and things that I have never had before. Some of these things may push the envelop of good taste to some people, though I&apos;m not a bizarre food eater. Really, I&apos;m not. I&apos;m just someone who, when I see something like mustard flavored frozen custard or chili powder covered candy or jalepeno-flavored suckers, I just have to try it. When I see the idea of adding jalepenos to chocolate cake, I find it an interesting idea worthy of trying. I consider myself to be an adventurous eater.

My connection to the food world in Rochester? I have worked in the food industry in Rochester through the 1990s. I was an assistant manager at Chateau with an emphasis on the &quot;food court&apos; (i.e., concession stand) there during the theatre&apos;s early days. I also served as the food chair of the World Festival put on through the Rochester International Association for 2009 and 2010, working with various restaurants, caterer&apos;s, and food vendors.

I enjoy trying new foods--whether they be new restaurants that come to Rochester, or going to restaurants on our various travels around the country that we wouldn&apos;t have the opportunity to visit otherwise (both chain and independent restaurants), or new food items that are either brand new or just new to us, different regional cuisine, or different combinations of flavors of common foods.

I don&apos;t equate good food with high prices or high prices with good food. There are a lot of good places where you can find good quality food that tastes great without having to spend a lot of money. Chain restaurants and fast food restaurants have their place, and they can at times be better than independent restaurants. I&apos;m sure there are chain haters who won&apos;t like that assumption, and that&apos;s just something they&apos;ll have to live with.

When it comes to ethnic food, I&apos;m of the belief that if a restaurant is owned by a member of that ethnicity that it&apos;s probably authentic for that ethnicity. For instance, an Indian restaurant owned by someone who was born in India. India has a wide variety of cuisine, and even if it&apos;s not what another person from India experienced in their life doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s not authentic, anymore than what I have experienced in the US Midwest vs what someone may have experienced in the US South, East, or West.
