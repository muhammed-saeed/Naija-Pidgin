 #47. Get some Business Card Magnets printed up and hand them out every where you go! Have your friends&amp;family pass them out too!

 I do this before Christmas and again before Mother&apos;s Day. I invite the neighborhood kids to come by and shop for gifts for their parents and loved ones. They enjoy shopping on their own and parents enjoy a small break from the children! 

 To make this successful make sure the products you are offering are economical, I try to keep them under $25.00 each with most being around $10.00 each. Have a table set up with some inexpensive crafting supplies and let the children make their own greeting cards to go with the gifts they have purchased or have a gift wrapping table set up so they can personally wrap their gifts!

 #91. Put the word out to your friends, family&amp;co-workers that you offer freebies to party go&apos;ers. What do I mean? 

 Well, people who are holding baby showers, bridal showers, birthday parties, anniversary parties etc. contact me about my freebies. They make up party goodie bags and are always looking for things to stuff them with. Depending on what type of party it is depends on what I donate!

 #92. Print out your own Re-ordering labels! If you sell consumable goods (foods, spices, soaps, bath products, cosmetics etc) make sure you stick on a small re-ordering info sticker with your business info on it so that your customer can easily locate your information for placing reorders!

 #95. Contact your local area Girl Scouts, 4-H Club and other youth groups. Talk to them about you coming in to do a project with the youth&apos;s in the group. You can also talk to them about your business fundraiser program if you offer one. During the summer time there are alot of youth camps throughout the community. You can also find youth camps through local churches. Some are seasonal and some are year long programs. The YMCA is also a great resource! 

 For Example: If you are a Kitchen Consultant, come in and teach the youth how to cook or about kitchen safety. If you sell pet products, go in and talk about grooming a pet. If you sell candles, go in and make some mini candles or teach them how to decorate them for gifts. Be creative! 

 #96. If you are crafty with your computer you can print out tea bag wrappers with a pretty design on them along with your business information. I purchased a few boxes of individually wrapped tea bags and then put my printed business tea bag wrapper over it. You can hand them out throughout your community. 

 I like donating them to: Assisted Living Centers, Senior Community Centers, Daycare Centers (to be given to the parents&amp;teachers), School Teacher Lounges, Employee Break Rooms etc. 

 Example of Cost: .03 cents for a printed color wraper and about .03-.05 cents per tea bag.

Buy your gifts from yourself! Tupperware MAKES excellent gifts plus you get it at a personal discount! When you present a gift of Tupperware to the recipient in front of others, hopefully they will love the gift you gave and all their friends&amp;family members will LOVE it too and will want to place orders with you to get one! This also helps out your MONTHLY Tupperware Sales Totals! I don&apos;t know about you, but I would rather buy gifts&amp;give gifts from my own business that way hopefully others will see the items, like them&amp;will want to purchase some!

#60. Offline Carnivals, Fairs&amp;Expo&apos;s! Why not check into getting some advertising at your local events! Banners hanging up through-out an event are awesome! You only have to BUY one or two...pick up your banner after the event so you can reuse for the next event!

#63. If you are doing HOME PARTIES, make sure you get some Tupperware Themed Folders (under sales aids) or make your own folders....but slogans all over the covers about the Party Oppty and the Business Oppty that relates to your business...this is a subliminal message to your guests to book parties or to consider joining your business oppty!

#68. SMALL Community Newspapers.

Then follow up during the following days with info about the Tupperware Oppty with them via phone or email or in person interview/appointments. 



#70. Temporary Employment Agencies...again drop off packets of info about the Tupperware Oppty to them. Economy is sluggish in alot of the areas in the USA...ask Temp.

 25 Creative Ways To Advertise Your Business In Your Community 


 

 When it comes to advertising, it&apos;s important to be consistent with your advertising efforts. The harder you work on advertising your home business, the more new customers and team members you will get. 

Let&apos;s take a look at a few ideas.

1. Check out your local area State Fairs and Community Carnivals. Ask about getting a booth or table and set it up with your business information. People love to shop at Fairs and Carnivals, and they are looking to spend money.

2. Purchase some business card styled refrigerator magnets. Hand them out to all of your customers, party hosts, and business contacts. Using a magnet as your business card keeps your business in front of your customer, instead of being hidden away in their wallet.

3. Give your business products as holiday gifts. Cousin Jane might just love her gift enough, to become a future customer.

4. Put an AD in the back of local high school yearbooks. You can usually get these ads for around $25.00 which makes it affordable.

5. Put an AD for your business in local Athletic Sports Programs. In the fall, I purchase an AD in our local high school football program for around $40.00.

6. Contact local churches. See if you can place an AD in their weekly church bulletins and activity guides.   

7. Do you have a local community Play House? If so, get your business AD placed in their play programs.

8. Co-Sponsor a local Youth Athletic Group. Baseball teams, softball teams, cheerleading squads, gymnastic squads and swim teams, etc. are always looking for sponsors.

9. If you have a home business, consider getting a Yard Sign printed up. You will want to place it in your front yard, in a highly visible area.

10. Does your neighborhood hold local Meet and Greets? If so, make sure you go out and attend them. Get to know your fellow community members and make some new contacts.

11. Donate a Raffle Drawing Prize to a Non-Profit Group or Charity in your local community. They are always looking for prize donations for their charitable raffles.   

12. Local bus stops and bus sheds. Have you noticed that a lot of them have local business advertising on them? Contact the company and ask them for their advertising rates.

13. Does your local area grocery store allow advertisers to place business ads on the back of their cash register receipts? If so, contact them and ask about their advertising rates.

14. Contact your local Fire and Ambulance companies. Ask them about their upcoming fundraiser events or chicken barbecues. Ask them if you can set up a display table with a few of your products.   

15. Contact your local Assisted Living Centers for Senior Citizens. These centers will often hold Senior Shopping Events. Find out the date of the next event and participate by setting up a table display with some of your business products. Seniors can&apos;t get out to shop like they used to, so bring the shopping to them.

16. Does your community hold summer concerts in your local parks? If so, contact them about sponsoring an event or setting up a table.

17. Exchange business cards, fliers and coupons with another Direct Sales consultant. Every time you hand out a customers order, place one of her business cards into your bag, and vice-versa.

18. Indoor Concert Venue&apos;s. Have you attended a concert lately? A lot of local businesses co-sponsor these events. Ask the sponsor how you can get some advertising at the event.

19. Does your community print up a free renters guide, house buying guide or used car guide? (you can usually find them for free at your local supermarket). If so, contact them about placing your business ad inside one of the guides.

20. Get your business information printed onto paper text book covers. Donate them to local area adult technical schools and colleges.

21. Is there a local business in your area holding an upcoming Grand Opening? If so, contact them. A lot of times they are giving away freebies to the first few hundred customers. Inquire to see if you can donate a few of your products for their Grand Opening. If you do donate, make sure your business contact information is attached to your products.

22. Get your business information printed up on inexpensive bookmarks. Donate these bookmarks to local colleges and libraries.

23. Put your business knowledge to work. Call up your local colleges, cooking schools, craft stores, etc. See if you can come in to teach a class. Sharing your expertise with others is a great way to get new business.

24. Print out some kid&apos;s coloring pages with a small section on them advertising your business and donate them to local area restaurants, daycare&apos;s, doctor&apos;s offices, etc.

25. Consider getting some inexpensive mini desktop-sized calendars printed up with your business information on them. Hand these calendars out to local businesses to give to their office employees.

 Here are some low-cost ways to do it: 

 ·          Door-hangers on doorknobs.  If your target is geographically defined, such as a day care or grocery store, print a specific offer on door-hangers and place them on doorknobs in your area. This method will produce results in direct proportion to the strength of your offer. For example:&quot;Professional day care for your little ones&quot;is less likely to trigger people&apos;s interest in your day care than&quot;Put your little ones in the care of someone you trust. Our professional day care services are available Monday through Friday.&quot;&quot;Big enough to serve you, small enough to know you,&quot;is less likely to create new shoppers than&quot;Let us wash your car for free while you shop. 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. every Saturday at Super Foods.&quot; 

 ·          Flyers under windshield wipers.  If you need to reach the drivers of pickup trucks, what better way than to send your doorknob-hanging team into parking lots with flyers to put under windshield wipers? Yes, they may get run out of the mall parking lot by that security guard in the golf cart, and don&apos;t be surprised if some lonely soul with nothing better to do calls you to complain, but the results are definitely worth it. 

 ·          Purchased word-of-mouth.  Hire someone to be a walking ad and ride up and down in the elevators of tall buildings, stand at bus stops, wait at train stations, hang 

 ·          around in coffee shops and strike up conversations with strangers.&quot;Have you tried that new deli over on 4th street? It&apos;s awesome.&quot;Sounds nuts, I know, but it works. 

 ·          Virtual showroom.  Build a website to serve as a virtual showroom. It&apos;s one of the best advertisements there is. Use it when people call to ask details about your company, your products or your services.&quot;Are you sitting in front of a computer? Good.&quot;Most people will be, or can easily walk across the room to one.&quot;Now go to Blahblah.com. Yeah, that&apos;s me, there on the right. Now click the button that says &apos;Equipment.&apos; See that second photo?...&quot;Think of this website as a place where you sit down to talk with interested prospects. Make sure the virtual showroom is equipped with all the same tools and props as your physical showroom. You&apos;ll be shocked what it does for the conversion rate of inquiries. 

 ·          Nighttime silhouettes.  You&apos;ve probably never seen one, but that&apos;s all the more reason you should do it. Nobody else in your town has seen one either. First, locate a windowless wall at least three stories tall in a part of town that has lots of traffic at night, especially foot traffic. Then arrange with the owner of that building--and the building across the street--to let you install a  logo projector . They&apos;re unbelievably effective. And in the long run, cheap. In some situations you can even use an old slide projector to achieve the desired effect. 

 ·          T-shirts and vests.  My rather successful little ad firm, with its 41 offices worldwide, was launched in 1980 with a t-shirt advertising a telephone thought-for-the-day on an answering machine.&quot;Take a Break in Your Day. Dial Daybreak. 258-7700.&quot;I could only afford one such printed t-shirt. I wore it a lot. 

 Hand stamps.  Someone I know recently attended a ticketed event that required a hand-stamp for readmission. The hand-stamp was a delightful little mini-ad for one of the sponsors. Can you imagine a better advertising vehicle for creating personal identification with a brand? There&apos;s something about looking down at your own hand and seeing a brand image that&apos;s part of you for the evening and knowing that the image has value. You&apos;re having fun, the brand is there, and it&apos;s part of you. The ink might wash off, but the impression it makes on the mind doesn&apos;t fade so
