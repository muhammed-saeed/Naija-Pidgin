 VBLOG: Is Merit Pay the Right Way to Go? 

 HotChalk Blogs - Blog by Edward Fields: Teachers Matter 
 &quot;Good teachers will accumulate wealth more rapidly with merit pay, provided the markers used to determine merit pay are absolutely objective and measure student progress from the beginning to the end of a single academic year rather than in a single testing event... Otherwise, merit pay plans will discriminate among student populations, and possibly by subject.&quot;
 -- Peter Bargmann, Social studies teacher, W. W. Samuell High School, Dallas, Texas &quot;It could be, depending on what &quot;merit&quot; means. Is merit merely raising standardized test scores? WHat about serving as a good role modle; how would that be measured and compensated? Teachers need to be rewarded for excellence, but we need to carefuly determne esaclty what constitutes merit.&quot;
 -- Chaz Burton, ESL Instructor, Santa Ana College, Santa Ana, CA &quot;No because most people think that merit pay means if the student does well the teacher gets the merit pay. What if the student doesn&apos;t do well and it is no fault of the teacher? What do special education teachers do? then what. . .&quot;
 -- Carol Tell, Teacher, Fort Dodge Community Schools, Fort Dodge, Iowa &quot;No, I do not think teachers should be given merit pay because we don&apos;t all start out with the same raw product like in manufacturing. There are so many variables to the students who make-up our classes each year. The neighborhood the aschool is in, the number of non-English speakers, socio-economic group, the number of special education students in your class all can make a difference. It would be awesome for all teachers to get the same level of students in their class each year, then and only then can you measure the direct impact of the individual teacher on the student. If the student is in fourth grade how are you going to measure the impact of the first four teachers in that child&apos;s life? Perhaps a skill that was taught in second grade finally made a connection in fourth. Who should get the merit pay the second grade teacher because he taught the original knowledge to the student or the fourth gtade teacher who&apos;s class the student made the knowledge his own and demonstrated that he knew it? All teachers before the current teacher has made an impression and departed knowledge to the student. Some times it takes a while for what a student knows to catch up with what a student can demonstrate she knows on a test. This is the reason I feel all teachers should get paid the most a society can pay because we shape the future of all civilizations. The movie star, ball players and bankers we teach them all what they know.&quot;
 -- Rhogenia McMillan, Educator, Washoe County, Reno, NV &quot;I don&apos;t think it is. It is too subjective. I have seen toooo much of personal favoritism displayed by administrators - you are left out if you are not a favorite regardless of the quality of your work. Also, those teachers of art, music, pe and librarians whose areas are not tested are left out of the loop. Merit pay is simply not fair because of the implementation process.&quot;
 -- Cindy Harrison, Librarian, Madison County Schools/NE Madison Middle School, Canton, MS &quot;Teacher merit pay is a good idea. Our public school systems are overrun with students who cannot read and write at their grade level. These students are promoted to the next grade level,( unless achievement tests prevent them from doing so in some states.) in the name of the &quot;No-Child-Left-Behind&quot; mindset. Perhaps teachers would be more motivated to actually TEACH if they weren&apos;t among the lower paid professions. We always hear about how important our teachers are to our children, yet they do not receive the pay they deserve. This is speaking of the teachers who are really trying to teach, and make a meaningful impact upon their students education, not simply counting the days until summer starts, so they don&apos;t have to deal with the kids and all their baggage. If the teachers who were actually making an effort were rewarded, they may excel still more. Merit pay could motivate other teachers to really try to teach in the difficult circumstances they may have.&quot;
 -- Cathy Dixon, homeschool mom, GISD, Garland, TX &quot;No. The most outstanding teacher may not be able to overcome the obstacles in some areas like poverty, attitudes, parental involvement, etc. And in other cases, a mediocre teacher can&apos;t help but have a positive outcome due to their particular circumstances. How would merit pay be decided? Test scores - don&apos;t we already have accusations of teachers teaching the test and schools focusing on testing not teaching? Graduation rates - how does that reward the teachers who may have set a good foundation? Get back to the basics and focus on EDUCATION, quit cramming extraneous stuff into the curriculum, reward positive behaviors in students, and punish negative behaviors that interfere with the learning environment of others.&quot;
 -- DS, MS Science TeacherGarland TX &quot;I feel that teacher merit pay will put a huge competition between teachers themselves; teachers and administrators; and between parents and teachers, too! (e.g. School Choice vouchers) It’s not like I am going to the local Lumber Company and getting to pick out only the best 2 x 4s to build my foundation of my house. ----I get what someone decides I get, or the luck of the draw, etc. If we could all only pick the best of the lumber to build with, then we would have the best &quot;house&quot; (class of students) on the block. But since we have to take whatever is given to us for our classroom, we may be competing against other classrooms in our same grade with higher ability children, and not have as good as scores on the tests that we give. And what about schools that only have one or two classrooms of each grade, as is the fact in some small country/rural areas? Also, not all children test well, but when they do hands-on-activities they may show that they know the information. This would be a scary situation to have our merit pay determined by how our children do or do not succeed on state tests. I am not sure of a &quot;Fair&quot; way to determine a teacher&apos;s award of Merit pay. Another point that needs to be addressed is the fact that you can&apos;t compare what the children in my classroom this year did on test against the children I had last year, because you are comparing Apples and Oranges, since it is not the same children’s brains I am working with from year to year!! One year I might have the best of the crop and the next year I may have a lot of “blemished or damaged fruit”, where other years I may have all or at least more of the just &quot;perfectly ripened&quot; children’s brains to work with in my classroom. Thank you for letting us voice our concerns and ideas!!! &quot;Yes. For many outstanding teachers who pour their lives into being educators, who go way beyond the call of duty, there should be merit pay. Believe me the teachers in every building know who is deserving of this reward.&quot;
 -- MarySue Watson, Sixth Grade Teacher, Chapel Hill Christian School-North, Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio &quot;NO! What happens when a teacher receives a extremely difficult class? Or what about SPED teachers who are either Co-Teaching, where the Reg. Ed teacher is the Teacher of Record, or in a Resource class, and a student is not functionally able to pass the state requirements? Merit pay is good only when the playing field is leveled. Then and only then can a teachers ability to teach be scored fairly. Those who say, &quot; If a teacher is good the students will learn&quot;. That may be true in most circumstances (I do not know the facts or research about this idea), but not in all circumstances. For merit pay to be equitable for every teacher then the rating system MUST be designed equitable for every teacher. For now share the wealth equally and critiuque each teacher upon what they are able to do with what they have. J. Farnocchia SPRING ISD&quot;
 -- John Farnocchia, Dept. Chair Special Services, Spring ISD, Dekaney High School, Houston, TX &quot;I think that merit pay will only work if there is sufficient data to show that a teacher actually moved a student from one level of learning expectation to another. Teachers working as a team have the ability to move some students to a higher level of achievement in various subjects when they teach using the proper manipulative aids and train the students to take responsibility for their learning in the classroom. Merit pay is saying that we as teachers should compete against each other for monetary gains in our profession. Where in other professions are employees pitted against each other for this reward. I say none, because they are paid what they are worth and they don&apos;t have to work expecting a reward for doing the job. they chose to do from their heart.&quot;
 -- Lorraine M Thornton, Gifted /Talented Teacher, RSD, New Orleans. Louisiana &quot;NO!!!!! I don&apos;t want administrators who have not been in the classroom for twenty year evaluating my teaching ability. They are subject to partiality, bribes and personal preferences. There is also the student factor....if my students do not &quot;perform&quot; well on tests, I am penalized. Nope! I&apos;m a professional, I give 110 percent every day to my students. Some choose not to participate in learning. Am I going to be judged by that? Do you believe the Urban Legend that any body can teach? &quot;Teachers are always seeking different ways to educate. There are some students whose learning styles do not mesh with &apos;frontal teaching&apos; styles. The Special Eduction student does not always fit the grid. Merit Pay is based on standardized test scores. The Special Education students does not fall into this category. Alternate Assessment is not scored. How does one include the Special Education teacher, whose population cannot be scored, in this &apos;competition&apos;?&quot;
 -- Esther Rosner, teacher of special education, 75/P.811X @ I84, Bronx, New York &quot;No, teacher merit pay for individual teachers is not a good idea. Students benefit from teacher collaboration, the sharing of good ideas, the desire to help each other to meet the needs of all our students. Anything that puts teachers into a competitive position means that there is less incentive for teachers to share good ideas and help each other. Merit pay for schools would be fine. It rewards team efforts and cooperation to improve the learning for all.&quot;
 -- Liz Wolf-Spada, teacher, elementar, Snowline JUSD, Phelan Elementary, Phelan, California &quot;When we clone children to be the same, merit pay might be a good answer to rewarding teachers who get the most out of their students. Until that time, we as educators know that our classrooms are full of differentiated learners, IQ&apos;s and a plethera of social and economic behaviors that the experts cannot fix in their own offices. How can any one or group of people, themselves educated to a higher degree, say who deserves a merit pay increase or bonus with such diversity within the classroom. By the way, who is going to decide who gets what? The same people that brought us welfare? How about those that have instigated the &quot;fuel crisis&quot;? Maybe let DC do it, they really know how to give away feebies!&quot;
 -- Tom Devine, Business Educator, Juniata County School District, East Juniata, McAlisterville, PA 17049 &quot;Merit pay is not a good idea. There are too many factors in students&apos; lives that teachers cannot change or fix or overcome. I&apos;ve had students who, no matter how many instructional strategies, behavior modification plans, parent contacts I tried/made were not successful. If I&apos;ve done all I can possibly do and then some to help a student be successful I should not suffer in terms of pay when that student is not successful.&quot;
 -- Tammy Wood, Kindergarten Teacher, Meaadows of Dan School, Patrick County, Meadows of Dan VA &quot;I think incentives to teachers to go above and beyond are good. Hoever, I certainly would not want my pay to be based on all of my student&apos;s performance or lack there of. I have a lot of low achieving students who would be better served with a more technical/vocational training, but because of the current way the education system operates, they are forced into classes where they have no desir to even earn a grade much less learn. &quot;Teacher merit pay is not a good idea. I have never heard any equitable way to discern who would receive the merit pay. I teach remedial math to non-identified (for special ed) ELL students in grades 10-12. I have three preps and work all day with discouraged, at-risk learners. Next door to me is the Calculus AP teacher. He has two preps, and all of his students are upper-level, motivated, college-bound students. He has a passing rate of 80% on the AP Calc exams. I have an 80% passing rate on the CAHSEE exam. His students have gpa&apos;s in the 3.5-4.5 range. My students have gpa&apos;s ranging from 0.5 - 3.0. What criteria would be used to decide which of us deserves merit pay and which not? How would you rank us against the rest of the math department, who range from one prep to three preps, some teaching in Primary Language and some doing Sheltered English classes? What equitable measure would rank us against the English teachers, the ELL teachers, the social science teachers, the ROP teachers?? How do you measure the impact teachers have on students&apos; lives? Teachers are named by students as the person who motivated them to go to college. That&apos;s good. I have one student who returns annuallly to talk to OTHER TEACHERS&apos; classes to encourage college-going. She tells them that she won&apos;t speak to my students because they don&apos;t need her -- they have me. She tells them she hated me in high school, but now she realizes she is where she is (a college grad) because of me and my demands on her. Another student returned with a t-shirt for me which read, &quot;You can&apos;t scare me. I&apos;m a teacher.&quot; She told me that I was the only teacher who allowed her to be herself in the classroom as she hid behind a veil of hair while she mourned the death of her father. These two have survived the loss of a parent in their elementary school years and gone on to college. But a greater percentage of my students go to alternative or continuation schools than go to college. How does that score in merit pay formulae? Merit pay is a grand idea with a major flaw -- there is no way to apply equitable standards to such a varied profession.&quot;
 -- Jane Sharp, teacher, Calexico Unified Schools/Calexico High School, Calexico, California &quot;No, No, and No for a couple of reasons: 1. A major reason is that how students are supported at home really makes a difference as to how well they learn. Teachers are not their parents, and have NO control over this vital piece of the educational puzzle. 2. Nepotism, favoritism, cronyism, etc. could reault in some unsavory and undeserving staff receiving special consideration. NO MATTER how small this % could be....it is too large!!! (And please...I am a 33-year dedicated veteran...and have seen some real unbelievable scenarios go on in this arena!!!) let us NOT bury our heads in the sand! 3. Teachers of the Arts, Physical Ed., etc...at the Elementsry level and other levels, too...do not teach their students maybe but once per week or once per 8-day rotation. High School and Middle School see them more per semester....but the material but still does not have the material&apos;s support of the CORE subject in testing materials, books, etc. Also, if the bonuses were related to testing, how could we possibly test students on a subject that is concentrated on a few times per month- that has no test practice books, drills, and workbooks...which are provided for the CORE subjects 99.9% of the time---- which constitute most of the academic day. This is NOT even addressing how one teacher sees 330 students per week, and another is responsible for 975 students per week!&quot;
 -- Toni, Teacher &quot;Merit pay is a good idea, in theory. Merit pay will strengthen the field of education, and both student&apos;s and teacher&apos;s will benefit from higher expectations and rewards for performance. It is dangerous and damaging to have unqualified, unmotivated, and ineffective teachers in the classroom. Education, in many cases, is the determining factor for success and opportunity for students. Bad teachers can literally, rob student&apos;s their future. Merit pay will &quot;weed out&quot; those kind of teachers, or create a climate of higher expectations for the profession. A climate where this type of teacher is unacceptable, and must improve or be removed. Teachers that put in the extra effort to design creative, engaging, and challenging lessons, teachers that develop positive relationships with students and families, in an effort to motivate, mentor, help and understand their students and situations, teachers who spend extra time and effort to organize and manage their classroom environment, set and enforce high expectations of students and themselves and increase student achievement, should be rewarded. They should receive compensation that reflects their commitment and effort, but how is merit pay going to be determined? Test scores alone are not a reliable indicator of teacher quality; there are far too many variables dictating the scores. It is common knowledge that tests are biased by learning style, language, culture and a variety of other factors. Principal recommendations are also unreliable. Personal relationships, nepotism, personal bias, misunderstandings, and a host of other factors make this method unfair and unreliable. The &quot;word on the street&quot;, or in this case, in the hall is a somewhat reliable source for measuring a teachers success in the classroom, but student&apos;s cannot have the responsibility of determining teacher merit pay. Students, teachers, staff are all human, and therefore corruptible and subject to bias, but tests are unable to make determinations about the quality of the complex art of educating. Although merit pay is inherently good, there are so many variables, that merit pay may not be realistic. Yes, bad teachers should be removed from the classroom and profession, poor teacher performance must be addressed, student achievement must be increased, and quality teachers should be valued and rewarded. Is merit pay the answer? Can this theory become a realistic and reliable reality? As the issue is pondered, debated, and formulated into plans and proposals; educators, parents, students, politicians and every other stakeholder in education will have a plethora of fabulous debating opportunities.&quot;
 -- Sarah, Teacher, Kansas City Kansas Public Schools, Kansas Cit, KS &quot;It depends on the demographics of the students. If a teacher teaches in a poor community with a disproportionate amount of students from a one parent home then the teacher shouldn&apos;t be penalized if his students do not perform as well as others who are from two parent homes with a higher family income level.&quot;
 -- Allan Rains, Middle Math Teacher, Salinas Elementary/Sacred Heart School, Salinas, CA &quot;NO. It will set up a situation where teachers compete with each other for the additional pay. It could discourage them from sharing their ideas, materials and experience with each other, so they have the edge in a competitive situation. I have received very favourable reports, even news articles about my teaching, but do not think it would contribute one jot to improving children&apos;s education or lives were I to receive preferential pay over my colleagues.&quot;
 -- Alice Mosley, Elementary Music Teacher, San Francisco Unified School District - multiple sites, San Francisco, California &quot;No, it is not. It is just another way to not paid a viable wage. Teachers already have proven their merit and they need to be paid a competable salary. Thank you.&quot;
 -- Patrice Geathers, ISSP Facilitator, Duval/Jefferson Davis Middle, Jacksonville, Florida &quot;No, teacher merit pay is not a good idea! I like to share ideas with colleagues; I don&apos;t want to compete. When merit pay is involved, teachers will no longer feel free to assist other teachers. Educators are supposed to work for the common goal of seeing our students succeed. Students won&apos;t reap benefits. Some teachers also get the &quot;cream of the crop&quot; when it comes to students; some teachers do well with struggling students but the test scores don&apos;t show the progress made.&quot;
 -- Melinda Carroll, Teacher (third grade), Chester County Schools--Jacks Creek Elem., Jacks Creek, TN &quot;Merit Pay is one more way to &quot;divide and conquer&quot;. Education and educators cannot be compared to a &quot;corporate model&quot;. There are better ways to award good teachers. To use performance based pay as a way to reward and punish is just WRONG and the repercussions will be disastrous. How will the low-performing schools attract quality teachers if their pay is based on a variable that is out of their hands? What&apos;s needed is good parenting, a sound, safe environment - things many of us take for granted. So many children are born into an environment where parents are absent, neglect is overwheleming and nutrition isn&apos;t a consideration. So, a teacher assigned to a low-income, low socio-economic community is doomed to low pay because his/her students are ill-prepared? What&apos;s the incentive to stay? If a teacher has no authority and is constantly scrutinized by his/her students, their parents and administrators, how and why would anyone remain in a hostile, underpaid, skewed position? Accountability is necessary, but it nees to be approached in more creative ways.&quot;
 -- Stuart F. Bowers, ESOL Instructor, Broward County Schools, Oakland Park, FL &quot;Teacher merit pay is a very controversial issue, but the cons outweigh the pros. What ends up happening is that a teacher with struggling students is &apos;punished&apos; for the students&apos; scores when classrooms are never really balanced. Try as they may, administrators respect parents&apos; requests and certain teachers that get &apos;high functioning&apos; groups of students are looked upon as more effective teachers deserving of this &apos;reward&apos; of merit pay. The whole situation perpetuates the problem. The teachers receiving merit pay end up with all the &apos;high functioning&apos; students due to the fact that parents believe that means the teachers are more effective. In reality, it is much more difficult to teach the &apos;lower functioning&apos; students and those teachers actually deserve more pay! Teachers with ESOL endorsements have huge (and very rewarding, I might add) responsibilities trying to teach the language skills and content level curriculum. So, it can be very misleading when you begin designating teachers deserving of merit pay. Society would end up creating large numbers of teachers entering the profession to teach Talented and Gifted students!&quot;
 -- Tami Johnson, Educator, Lincoln County School District, Newport, Oregon 97365 &quot;NO! There are too many variables - for enstance, the number of students, the ability of students, the number of special ed. students, etc. If all teachers had the same students, you could make accurate comparisons and evaluations, but that is not how classes are developed.&quot;
 -- P. Wallis, Teacher, Windsor, Imperial, MO &quot;No, merit pay only cause unhealthy competition between teachers. The pressure would cause teachers to do things they normally would not. Ethical issues also come into play when the pressure to succeed causes a people to give answers/cheat. Education should be a collaboration of knowledge, not one teacher needing to look better than another just for money. Teachers scaffold lesson which is building upon the prior years learning so how can one teacher earn money for many teachers work? &quot;Merit pay assumes that teachers will work harder for more money. It didn&apos;t seem to work very well in the case of AIG. As we discover that those paid more in business because they are &quot;high producers&quot; are exactly the ones who caused the business to fail, I wonder why anyone would think education should adopt the business model.&quot;
 -- Mary Cannon, Social Studies teacher, Waite High School, Toledo Oh &quot;NO, if you have a class at a Title 1 school you will NEVER get the merit pay. It is not fair to all the hard working teachers who teach our poor and disadvantaged students!!!!!!!&quot;
 -- Robin Ramsey, Teacher, Hampton City Schools, Hampton, Virginia &quot;It is not a good idea. Teachers will be competing for an SAS class. Teachers will not be working together.lausd, &quot;No teacher merit pay is not a good idea because of the many factors involved with teaching that is out of the control of the teacher. Teachers have to balance working with students, parents, administrators, staff and other teachers which leads to frustrations because of the different needs a teacher must provide to the various groups. The fact that students bring many issues to class and when combined with other students and their issues, there are a lot of influences that impacts the learning environment of the classroom. Merit pay to teachers is not fair for teachers who have the more difficult students because more work would be requred than a teacher working with well-behaved and well-discipline students.&quot;
 -- Debra Buggs, Teacher, Prince George&apos;s County Public Schools, Mitchellville, MD 20721 &quot;Although I do believe in Pay-for-Performance, I think it is best served for positions in which the employee has sole control over their OWN performance. Teaching involves far too many external influences that we have absolutely no control over. The child may come to school hungry or tired due to issues at home, or they may be the care-giver in their home due to lack of parental support for some reason. There are so many other factors that we deal with on a daily basis that we just cannot control and for which we must adjust and adapt to daily. It is completely unfair to base a teacher&apos;s worthiness and value on performance that is completely affected by a student&apos;s past learning experience and the support they may or MAY NOT receive from their family.&quot;
 -- Shannon Munoz, teacher, Clark County School District, Las Vegas &quot;NO! There are too many factors outside the teacher&apos;s control that affect student performance. In addition, the rating of a teacher could be subjective, even with criteria in place. And lastly, I think it would negatively affect the morale and team spirit in a school, which is so important. Everyone needs to work together and move forward a an entire school body.&quot;
 -- Suzanne Armstrong, teacher, 299-Chicago Public Schools, Chicago, Illinois &quot;Absolutely NOT because how can you compare the teacher who teaches Gifted with self-motivated students to the teacher who teaches Reading with students who have very low self-esteem and self-confidence. Many say that the lower students will have higher gains. This does not necessarily happen. Actually many of these students simply &quot;check out&quot; and give up. Teachers who have students with special needs or issues are doing far more than most people realize. Some teachers cannot even fathom some of the issues with these students. So, how can you compare a Reading teacher who is battling every day just to get the students to read - ANYTHING with a teacher who has students who enjoy learning. I am not singling out certain teachers, I am just making a point. You cannot compare teachers - MOST teachers deserve merit pay. To give merit pay to some when ALL teachers are suffering from the economy problem, is a slap in the face to those who do not receive merit pay.&quot;
 -- Linda Davis, Reading Teacher, Orange/ Union Park MIddle School, Orlando, Florida &quot;Of course not! No! Extreme rural and inner city schools that typically test low will end up in dire need of teachers! Which likely will result in supplements to promote teaching contracts. ......Also, it is important to note that I can only catch the fish swimming in my pond. It wouldn&apos;t be fair to judge my fishing success in comparison to someone fishing in another pond (say one that is over stocked). Test scores of children from wealthy school districts always differ from those in low socioeconomic areas.....the children of doctors and lawyers are often genetically similar to their parents...including IQ. I know far too well that intellect and money do not always go hand in hand, however for the majority it holds true. &quot;No. Teachers who work in schools that serve high risk populations will be penalized&quot;
 -- Elizabeth O&apos;Donnell, Kindergarten Teacher, Pittsfield, Pittfield, MA &quot;yes, My school adopted a Merit pay program this year and I have stepped up my act and really focused on all levels of instruction. The program that accompanies it has really changed and expanded my thinking. &quot;Yes as far as holding teachers accountable however there needs to be some guidelines. For example students and teachers should be assessed on how much progress they make towards a certain benchmark. Some children make great progress but may not reach the state standard but evidence can show that they have learned and gained skills over the year. In addition there are many factors that affect how children learn that are out of the teacher&apos;s control and a teacher should not be held accountable for those factors.&quot;
 -- Angel Honts, 1st/2nd Grade Teacher, Neah-Kah-Nie School District, Oregon &quot;No, of course not! What criteria will administration use to determine this with? test scores? report cards? There would have to be some form of accountability that is tested for this to work. What about the teacher who does her/his best and yet several students just don&apos;t make progress because of all the baggage they bring with them to class? I have several like that who have made little or no progress this year. How can we be sure that administration will look at that situation with unbiased eyes? What about those children in the inner city? I know teachers who bang their head against the wall every day trying to come up with motivational ways to instruct and encourage their students, but with no support at home and an attitude that just about slays the teacher, there is little to no progress in their classes. Yes, I have worked with a teacher in the past who didn&apos;t deserve to be in the classroom but the administrator and the union did not uphold their responsibility both to the students and to the teaching profession. Sometimes that happens but the vast majority are not like that.&quot;
 -- Elizabeth Tice, teacher gr.3, Penfield Central School District, Penfield, NY &quot;no because who decides on the teacher&apos;s worth, is the students or administration? neither has the teacher&apos;s interests at heart. &quot;No! How would or could you make the playing field fair with the students coming in at such varied levels, both with academics and especially behavior, not to mention the poor parent support that we get!&quot;
 -- John Moose, Elementary Teacher, Snowline School District, Phelan, California &quot;No, it is not a good idea because there are too many variables in determining who should receive it! If everyone --and I mean everyone-- didn&apos;t agree with who should receive it, I fear that many teachers may leave the profession, and that would be a tragedy. &quot;Merit pay may be a great idea, but I am not sure how we award this merit and who awards it, would it be based on test grades??? NOT A GOOD IDEA!!! Could it be based on the energy and accomplishments of the teacher through the eyes of her students, maybe a better idea!!!! I definately think merit pay is better than years of service, cause frankly we all know some seasoned teachers that are horrible......&quot;
 -- Lori Ann Lancaster, Math Teacher, GAPS, Albany, Oregon &quot;No -- Assuming that the teacher knows his/her subject matter and puts in the extra time that is part of the job description of being a &quot;teacher,&quot; there is still the adage: &quot;You can&apos;t make a silk purse from a sow&apos;s ear&quot;. Nor can an instructor teach a student who is continually tardy&amp;/or absent; a student who will not do or complete his/her homework assignments; students who refuse to participate in classroom activities; students who cannot read/write/speak/understand the English language at the level that the text is written.&quot;
 -- Beatrice Scroggin, Adjunct Professor {retired high school tea cher} , Oakton Community College, DesPlaines, IL &quot;Individual merit pay is not a good idea. It will divide the teachers between those who have the better students vs the challenged students. Merit pay would only work on a school basis. If a school achieves goals worthy of a bonus then all teachers should share in that merit pay.&quot;
 -- Louis A. Perry, Social Studies Teacher, Council Rock / CRHS South, Holland, PA &quot;Because teachers deserve it, for their effort, their care and the natural flow of knowledge. Every teacher of the world gives his/her best without thinking in a prize. Why not pay them for their merit. A bit more money would help and they will work harder if their effort is recognized. &quot;I am a classroom teacher in a poor, rural school and I say, No, because what Obama is proposing is not simply rewarding teachers for students&apos; good grades. He also plans to penalize teachers when students make bad grades. Politicians tend to assume that teachers are to blame for the high dropout rate and poor performance of American students. The fact of the matter is that most of the factors that limit students from reaching their potential are outside the classroom and well beyond teachers&apos; control. When parents opt out of the responsibility of raising their children , i.e. making sure they eat well, get plenty of sleep, have necessary materials, DO THEIR HOMEWORK AND NOT DRUGS, etc., or are ill-equipped to raise their children, there&apos;s very little a teacher can do to intervene. If a student is not expected to be responsible at home or do what his parents tell him (if they tell him), then how can someone outside the home be expected to get the student to cooperate, or even understand the importance of performing well? There are so many social ills that come into play before we even see the students we&apos;re expected to teach. Teachers are often spread too thin and many have to pay out of their own pockets to buy resources to provide their students with quality instruction so it is a slap in our face to suggest that teachers are the problem. I DO what I am paid to do and often MORE. Don&apos;t penalize me because some of my students are too damaged, too spoiled, or too lazy to learn.&quot;
 -- Adria Connell, Teacher, Valley Head School, Valley Head, AL &quot;Yes, if a person is a good teacher they should be rewarded with a higher salary. Merit pay would insure that good teachers keep teaching.&quot;
 -- Ronda, ParentDecatur, AL &quot;No, not until *the class size issue is resolved; * testing is overhauled; *inclusion has a real plan; *bankers don&apos;t get to drive the economy into the swamp, with little or no consequences Merit pay is an insult, the best teachers I know have gone above and beyond with little or no recognition (and not wanting any) and bad teachers should simply be weeded out. You can&apos;t buy passion nor love of job&quot;
 -- Pam St. Clair, SPED/ BD teacher, Seattle, Ingraham High, Seattle, WA &quot;A small &quot;bonus&quot; for teachers who have tackled extra responsibilities seems fair just as people employed in other professions receive occasional bonuses, However, I believe all teachers receiving satisfactory evaluations should receive the same cost of living increases and increases for additional education. To do otherwise may lead to conflict between teachers and administrators as it is difficult to evaluate a teacher in a completely objective manner. Students may rate a teacher as exceptional when an administrator may rate him/her as average because they are not involved in extra-curricular activities, etc.&quot;
 -- Cheryl Leask, Teacher, HMS School for Children with Cerebral Palsy, Philadelphia, PA. &quot;No. It&apos;s an &quot;apples to oranges&quot; scenario. Three years ago, I had a class in which I had 95% pass rate on our state&apos;s standardized tests. While I always have decent scores, those were the best I have ever had - I happened to have a group of relatively high achievers. My scores have not been that high since. Did I become a bad teacher? Do I care less about the achievement of the other students? Of course not. In fact, with a more diverse class, I must work even harder to reach them all. While it may look like MY scores were not as good as they last year, the STUDENTS&apos; scores are ALWAYS higher than they were when they tested the previous year. If we can compare the progress of the student, rather than comparing year-to-year scores in a straight line, then perhaps it would work. Otherwise, no.&quot;
 -- Vicki L. Huffman, 5th Grade Chair/Educator, McCormick School District, McCormick Elementary, McCormick, SC &quot;No, for a number of reasons. One big reason is that it is difficult to have students be put equitably among classrooms. Studdnts with special needs need extra time and effort and now that retention for a year is necessary before testing, how would that work? What if they don&apos;t improve for that retained year? It should not be reflected on the teacher. Who will monitor this? &quot;There is no way that merit pay is a good idea. Who decides whether or not teachers would warrant merit pay? Test scores? What if you are given a more challenging class and great test scores are not realistic? What about the sharing of ideas? Merit pay would encourage less sharing. This is coming from a National Board Certified teacher who goes above and beyond, and could certainly qualify for merit pay. I say, NO. &quot;No, no, no, each and everyone of us deserve adequate pay! We are long overdue for a raise. They keep loading us with more responsibilities and yet all the smart teachers are leaving the profession. Doesn&apos;t say much for me! Oh yeah, it&apos;s for the kids. &quot;Merit pay for teachers is a very bad and cruel idea. Teachers who teach in areas where they have all the supplies, equipment, support personnel and families who are at least middle income will have an easier job. The teachers who teach in underprivileged areas are going to have inadequate facilities, equipment, supplies, and support personnel. The students who go to these schools need the best teachers. Teachers avoid these areas because it is a much harder job to teach the students there. There is usually less parental support, and more students start their education behind the norm in ability levels. If test scores are the only teachers are evaluated, the teachers who deserve the higher paycheck could very well end up getting the lowest paycheck.&quot;
 -- Linda Dow, First Grade Teacher, MCSD/Hawthorne Primary School, Hawthorne, Nevada &quot;NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It pits teachers against each other rather than build teams. Also___ it doesn&apos;t recognize the schools with large diversity and transient students. When parents begin choosing teachers of higher performance, you loose the diversity (social and economically) that helps round out a classroom. Take that money and put it toward attracting top notch teachers, inservice, mentoring for low preforming teachers and tests that can really reflect what a student knows. Paper/pencil, multiple choice gives very little authentic assessment. Even Computer Based Testing is still, click on the right bubble. The most successful teachers,also has critical family involvement. There will always be a hole in the bucket unless parents take an active, hands on approach for their child&apos;s education. When a teacher gets through a day with out getting physically hurt, sworn at and demeaned, they consider it a good day. If we want to see changes in education, it has to be a carefully, planned out, course between the student, parent and the teacher/school.&quot;
 -- Brenda Marvel, Facilitator (mentor for student teachers, i nterns, etc.) , Provo School District, Provo, Utah &quot;It should be a school/community merit pay system. It takes everyone in a building working on the same thing---student achievement and success in order for a school to be successful. Within a building, you have teachers who have classes that are loaded with discipline, ELA, Special Ed., and low students, and others who have the students who want to learn, have average to high ability, etc.. If a school get who a rise in performance that meets a certain realistic goal, then everyone in that school should receive a bonus, or merit pay. From the bus driver who tells the kids to study on the bus, and or, go over tests, to the janitor, who tells students in the hall loitering, to go to class. Teachers who need a push, are pushed by their peers, and watched by their peers, and the entire staff rises to meet success.&quot;
 -- diane lange, 7th Grade LA, Cherry Creek School District, Littleton, Colorado &quot;It should be a school/community merit pay system. It takes everyone in a building working on the same thing---student achievement and success in order for a school to be successful.

 -- diane lange, 7th Grade LA, Cherry Creek School District, Littleton, Colorado &quot;Absolutely not. I teach in a middle to upper middle class district. The children score fairly well on standardized tests. Teachers who teach in lower socio-economic districts would be penalized because their children would score consistently lower than ours. Even in my district, one particular school is in a higher economic area than the rest. They continue to score higher than the rest. We house 2 self-contained special ed. classes, as well as 2 ABA classes. Their scores get tallied into our overall rating. That lowers our standards. One year I could have a higher functioning class, and the next year not Would I get a cut in pay because my 2nd year class scored lower. Children are not a commodity upon which you can judge good teaching.&quot;
 -- Myra brand, 4th grade teacher, plainview/old bethpage central schools, NY &quot;MERIT PAY IS ABSOLUTELY NOT A GOOD IDEA. IT CREDITS ONE TEACHER FOR THE SUCCESS OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE HAD SEVERAL TEACHERS BEFORE THEY WOULD HAVE TAKEN ANY STANDARDIZED TESTS. A CHILD&apos;S SUCCESS DOES NOT BEGIN IN THE YEAR IN WHICH HE/SHE TAKES AN EXAMINATION; IT BEGINS FROM THE TIME HE/SHE ENTERS THE HALLS OF LEARNING. iN ADDITION WILL THE PARENTS WHO STAND BEHIND THEIR CHILDREN THROUGH OUT THE YEARS BE COMPENSATED? ASK EVRY TEACHER AND YOU WOULD BE TOLD , &quot; BEHIND EVERY SUCCESSFUL CHILD IS A COMMITTED PARENT/GUARDIAN AND THE BATTERY OF TEACHERS IWTH WHOM HE/SHE HAS COME INTO CONTACT.&quot; WHO BEST CAN ATTEST TO THAT THAN PRESIDENT OBAMA VIS-A-VIS HIS GRANDPARENTS. HOW QUICKLY DO WE FORGET THE PAST AND WHERE WE CAME FROM. IT IS REGRETTABLE THAT THOSE WHO SEEK TO IMPLEMENT POLICIES FROM A POLLITICAL PLATFORM HAVE NOT CONSULTED WITH THE THOSE WHO ARE RFESPONSIBLE FOR EDUCATING CHILDREN. MAYOR JULIANI TRIED TO IMPLEMENT MERIT PAY IN THE NEW YORK CITY PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM AND FAILED. PERHAPS PRESIDENT OBAMA NEEDS TO CONSULT WITH THE UNITED FEDERATION OF TEACHERS (UFT) BEFORE GOING FORWARD WITH THE MERIT PAY PROPOSAL. MAYBE, IT WOULD BE BEST IF ANY COMPENSATION WERE GIVEN OUT, THAT IT BE GIVEN TO THE ENTIRE STAFF INCLUDING ADMINISTRATION. THIS WOULD BE QUITE UNLIKE WHAT IS PRACTICED IN NEW YORK CITY: THE ADMINISTRATION GETS A BONUS FOR THE STUDENTS&apos; IMPROVED PERFORMANCES.FOR EXAMPLE, $20,000 for the principal and $5,000 for each assistant principal. The teachers get nothing.&quot;
 -- GEORGE AULT, ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL, DISTRICT 9, BRONX, NEW YORK &quot;Merit pay is an exceptional idea; benefits for teachers, students and school systems! Establish criteria, weights, management standards, etc. in the beginning of the cycle then wait and watch [the creative skillful ideas flow and mature]. Maybe when teachers have to become personally responsible for their teaching, regardless of what standardized &quot;test&quot; is administered, they will become much more accountable. As established in business, hit &apos;em where it matters - their pocketbooks. I think we will assuredly see &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;. And while the criteria is being established, get input from people and organizations outside the profession. Educators tend to have on blinders when it comes to evaluations and not in touch with on what it takes to make it/survive in the &quot;real world&quot;. One of best and most respected administrators I have known always said a teacher should never be a superintendent; get the &quot;guy&quot; with the MBA.&quot;
 -- Elizabeth, Adjunct Faculty, JMU, Harrisonburg, VA 22801 &quot;No, because: 1. Students come to school from all kinds of backgrounds and abilities making it impossible to have a level &quot;playing field&quot; to measure. President Obama has stated that the goal is to make more than an year&apos;s progress in one year. HOWEVER, a child with with below to low average IQ is generally not able to make that kind of progress, although he/she will make some good progress. Also, if a particular class has more than its share of slow learners or behavior and/or emotional problems, that will greatly affect those students&apos; levels of achievement, not matter how hard the teacher works to help those students learn. 2. To reward all teachers in a school because the school&apos;s overall score reflects the required improvement is not appropriate because NOT ALL of the teachers were instrumental in that achievement but received the &quot;bonus&quot; anyway while in other schools, no one received the &quot;bonus&quot; but many WERE instrumental in the helping their students make the required progress. 3. Merit pay could also decrease the willingness of teachers to work together and instead may create an UNhealthy competition between them. Attitudes among the staff toward each others as well as toward students with limited abilities are likely to become negative. Merit pay may work in the business world, but it is not appropriate in the field of education. If teachers are &quot;chasing the dollar&quot; in merit pay, then the focus is shifted from the student to self-promotion for higher pay. Efforts in a nationwide collaboration would be more effective as teachers take pride in their work, in their students (not matter what the ability or background), and in each other as they share methods and ideas.&quot;
 -- Tanya Bishop, retired school teacher, Union Public Schools, Tulsa, OK, Broken Arrow &quot;It is a terrible idea! Unfortunately, all students do not come from the same home situation. If one works in a community where there is no parental support, or guidance at home, or any respect for education and educators, the outcomes are impacted. How can you penalize teacher for their student&apos;s low test scores when they are not completely responsible for the environment of their students? On the other hand, why give merit pay to teachers who work in affluent communitites, where education is supported and respected by the community. There is a direct correlation between success in school and a supportive home environment. It would be highly unfair to educators who choose to work in communities where they would likely be at a disadvantage.&quot;
 -- Anne Trieber, Teacher, Old Bridge Township/Carl Sandburg Middle School, Old Bridge, New Jersey &quot;I don&apos;t think merit pay for teachers is a good idea. Although all kids learn, they don&apos;t learn at the same rate. What would the merit be based on? Would it be on results of tests? Would it be based on report card grades? Principal ratings? Per student progress? There are too many variables, many of them subjective. If a school tracks kids by ability, would a class that is under grade level in September be expectedf to bring all kids up to grade levelby June- sometimes multiple years worth of growth per student? Would a class of 30 and a class of 12 have equal results? Is there an aide to help in a classroom? All these thinks affect the way kids are taught, how kids learn. Unless all classrooms are built equal- and that&apos;s not always fair, merit pay could not be fairly meted out. That is not to say that the dynamic gung ho teacher with great creativity , the teach to the test teacher, the test is miinimum, let&apos;s go beyond teacher should not be rewarded. Veteran teachers know what has worked for them inthe past. Can they use those strategies? Do those teachers micro managed by their principal or teaching team have the freedom to try new things? Is there wiggle room in a schedule for teachable moments? Is a teacher &quot;in trouble&quot; for not adhering to a strict schedule if utilizing a teachable moment? It would be better to find rewards for teachers across the board, and find ways to deal with unproductive teachers in other ways. It has been my experience that most teachers teach because they care about the kids in their classrooms. To build in a rivalry for monetary reward will create an atmosphere not of sharing for the best interest of all students.&quot;
 -- Bonnie Hall, ESL, Elementary, not currently teaching, Red Creek, NY 13143 &quot;No. The very hard work of the teachers who work with special ed students will not noticed or rewarded because the students test scores will not match those of the teacher whose students are bright. The untested subjects (Music, Art, etc.) will never be rewarded despite the many evening performances, shows, awards ceremonies, and after school rehearsals that are done each year.&quot;
 -- Nancy Fiske, Music Specialist, Pentucket, West Newbury, MA &quot;No! I like to reach out and teach the lower achieving students in our school. However, I don&apos;t want to earn less money if they don&apos;t score as well on the standardized tests. &quot;If merit pay is given to a teacher for student progress...what happens if you teach Special Needs students?&quot;
 -- A. Bilodeau, teacher, Chicopee, chicopee,MA &quot;No! It would turn teaching into a popularity contest. Principals, department heads, and others would have the power to make or break teachers whom they supervise. Many would try to be fair, but it only takes one who is abusing power to ruin the professional lives of a large number of good people. Recruiting and retaining quality professionals is hard enough already. Why add to the problem?&quot;
 -- Tara Bragg McCormick, Retired teacher, Norfolk Public Schools, Norfolk, VA &quot;Yes, in theory I do believe that merit pay is a good idea, however, there is just no way to be fair with it. I believe that good teachers should be paid more if their students are performing higher, but then you have to look at teachers that carry extra burdens such as ESE that have the at-risk and lower performing students and high school teachers that see 150-300 kids in a two day period. There is no fair way to judge their performance on their student outcomes.&quot;
 -- Vicki Johnson, ESE Behavior Teacher, Wakulla, Crawfordville, FL &quot;Not in the current system because there is no objective way to determine who should qualify. If you base it on state standardized test scores, which are only taken once a year, teachers with lower level classrooms, ESE and ESOL students, or as I saw in testing this year: sick students who come to school anyway, are penalized. Now if you had the students take a test at the beginning of the year and then the very end of the year and measured growth, then it might be a little more fair. But then there are grade levels like kindergarten, where the students don&apos;t take tests but you still have outstanding teachers. Or media specialists, art, and music teachers who don&apos;t have one class of students. How is their merit pay determined? Education is not something you can just boil down to numbers because we are educating the whole child and many people influence that child, not just one teacher. I just don&apos;t think there is any fair way to give &quot;merit&quot; pay. I do think teachers should be paid more for extra things they do around school, like grade chairs, extra tutoring, committees, and professional development. This would reward those teachers who put in extra effort, which tend to be the better teachers!&quot;
 -- Laura Cronin, Library Media Specialist, Polk County Schools, Lakeland, FL &quot;It will not be distributed fairly.&quot; &quot;As a general rule, teachers are not opposed to assessment. They assess their students in a variety of ways throughout the school day. They do not assess their students&apos; knowledge in one way, on one day of the year, and consider that sufficient. Therefore, most are horrified at the idea of being evaluated in that manner. Teacher merit pay based on student performance on one test is NOT a good idea. There is a substantial body of research which suggests that standardized tests do not motivate students (even when the results are tied to retention). In fact, the reverse is more often true. Furthermore, such tests provide a very narrow picture of a child’s knowledge and ability. Only when the subjective human element of teacher input is introduced does the picture become most accurate. If merit pay is tied to a balanced assessment that looks at the many facets of effective teaching, then perhaps the idea could be considered a good one.&quot;
 -- Sarah Morgan, Gifted Education Specialist / Ed.D. Candid ate , Cobb County School System / Clarkdale Elementary, Austell, GA &quot;Yes, I believe that outstanding teachers should be rewarded for that extra effort that which brings about outstanding outcomes.&quot;
 -- Joe L. Sanchez, Director, CETYS University English Language Center, Mexicali, B. C. , Mexico &quot;No, because it would not be fair due to teachers who may have nonEnglish speaking students, students who are not interested in attending school (which there are many-the state and federal governments ignore this fact), students who have been socially promoted even though they do not have the skills to advance, students who miss school frequently, students from families who do not value education, students who do not receive appropriate care at home such as no set bed-time, poor eating habits, lack of parental involvement, and the list can go on and on. Teachers cannot and should not be held responsible for student&apos;s academic achcievement, until the parents take responsibility first!&quot;
 -- Patricia Ryan, School Psychologist, Harnett County Schools, Lillington, NC 28374 &quot;It is easy to say &quot;Yes&quot; to this question because most teachers would think they are deserving of extra pay for extra effort. However, what about the teachers who put forth the extra effort time and again, perhaps without the knowledge of the people providing the merit pay? There are many unsung heroes in classrooms who struggle with below basic children every day, who jump through all the hoops, and yet, results do not show it according to standardized testing. One example I can give from personal experience is from five years ago. I had an eighth grader who&apos;s reading level was gaged at 3.9. We talked about what he had to do to raise it to a &quot;respectable&quot; level before i could send him to high school. By the end of the school year, his reading level increased to 6.5. Magic? No, just daily hard work on his part and mine. And, no extra pay. Just satisfaction. Bottom line: I do not agree with merit pay. Thank you.&quot;
 -- Maria DiBenedetto, Grade Teacher, Philadelphia/Feltonville School of Arts and Sciences, Philadelphia, PA &quot;On paper, teacher merit pay is a good idea. However, in the real world, where there are more factors than just the teacher&apos;s ability to teach, it is not a good idea. I teach in a school district where there are so many other problems:5 principals in less than a year, forty percent of my class has students with emotional and behavioral problems that are just now being addressed, pressure from the State Department to meet or exceed testing goals, parents that are unhappy with the school district but have little choice in the matter, the list could go on and on, however, I am there everyday teaching my heart out and having to compete with all the other teachers for merit pay would be the last straw on the camel&apos;s back. It is hard enough to create supportive relationships with other teachers without adding a competition that would result in teachers holding back on teaching ideas, lesson plans, discipline, etc. I have been in the classroom for 15 years and have seen alot of theories, practices, ideas, etc., come through. Some have been successful and alot have not. I just don&apos;t see where merit pay is going to produce the results that everyone wants - a better education for our students. I think parent merit pay would be a better idea - get the parents involved in the students education and reward them for doing what they should be doing anyway.&quot;
 -- Debbie L., TeacherMississippi &quot;It makes no sense. I have the skills and am assigned to the lowest level of students. The students make very good progress; however under a merit pay system I wouldn&apos;t match up to my colleagues for the amount of progress a student makes. Special Ed teachers may make remarkable progress with students and often are called &quot;miracle workers&quot;; how does one assess that. Again, it makes no sense. The administration in a building knows what (or should know what) is going on and that is where the buck stops in education---not with a half baked idea that sounds good to the public and makes good sound bites for politicians. Pitting colleague against colleague in an educational setting makes for a viral atmosphere in a school. It is just plain wrong.&quot;
 -- Travis Helms, Teacher, Upper Freehold Regional Schools, Allentown, NJ 08501 &quot;Teacher merit pay is only a good idea if the teacher&apos;s merit is based on the disaggregated data of their individual students&apos; test results and quarterly evaluations from their school principal and parents. There should be no single basis of merit. It should take in the full scope of what a teacher does and how the students learning is measured. Maybe we need to do more pre and post tests to display learning gains in our students. More work, yes, but is it worth it to prove that students are learning?&quot;
 -- Tamara Mooney, Student teacher, Cameron University, Lawton, Ok &quot;I feel like all good teachers should be rewarded for their hard work. On the other hand, every teacher is faced with different responsibilities in the classroom. Every classroom has its own set of obstacles, because of this I feel like merit pay would not be a good idea. There has to be other ways to reward those teachers that deserve the reward. I feel merit pay would leave out a very large group of teachers.&quot;
 -- T. Gray, 7th Grade Math TeacherMS &quot;If merit pay is proposed to be based on the standardized assessment performance of each student, I am concerned. Basing off growth shown by each student over the course of a year seems reasonable, but if that growth is to be proven based on standardized testing there will need to be serious reform to current testing methods. Our students show tremendous growth, but our students&apos; performances are more accurately represented by the wide spectrum of assessments by which they are measured within our school each year than by their performances on standardized testing. There are certainly some individuals who should seek other professions, and this might help to weed them out. However, the vast majority of people in this profession and entering this profession are here because of what they have to offer the students, not just what they stand to earn on their paychecks each month. I hate that individuals who have previously focused on providing a stimulating and nurturing educational environment for students might be forced to change their focus to standardized test achievement. We need to be very careful if this comes to pass; there is a great deal at stake.&quot;
 -- Teresa Adkins, 5th/6th Classroom Teacher, Van Buren - Stockport Center, Stockport, IA &quot;I think for the teachers that put that extra effort into their lessons and take pride the job that they do, and yes they should be rewarded. In the regular business world the emplyee would be recognized for their efforts.&quot;
 -- Anne, Teacher, Osbourn Park High School, Manassas, VA &quot;Teacher merit pay is a great idea. Some teachers do only what is necessary to &quot;get by&quot; and collect the paycheck at the end of the month, while others consistently are working for the betterment of their students, school, and community. Why should everyone be paid the same amount just because it&apos;s on paper that they are on the same level? It would be a difficult task to not show favoritism and to evaluate each teacher&apos;s performance level. It would require more of the administrators and I&apos;m not sure they have the extra time to devote to this.&quot;
 -- Linda Wegmann, Associate Director of Bands, Parkview High School, Springfield, MO &quot;Schools function best through collaboration not competition. Merit pay is a bad idea.&quot;
 -- David W. Poland, History/SPED Teacher, Lynn Public Schools, Lynn, MA. &quot;I hold the fairly unpopular belief that if we are to be treated like (and paid like) many other well respected professions, that we need to do away with tenure, and when appropriate, instate teacher merit pay. I do not know of another profession where once you pass a two-year program, your job is guaranteed. For dedicated, hard working, teachers who strive to stay on the cutting edge of educational practices, and spend the time (and money) necessary to make their classrooms into safe, supportive learning environments that the support the needs of every student in that class, then tenure means nothing anyway. Merit pay would reward the efforts and out-of-pocket money already spent by these dedicated, responsible professionals. On the other hand, there are those who have become complacent. They just want to get through their day, they beleive that what they already do is fine and won&apos;t take the time to check out any new programs or ideas. They become increasingly insular in a profession that thrives on cooperation, communication, and the sharing of best practices and ideas to suuport the kids thier classes. These are the ones who become angry when I discuss the elimination of tenure, but then agree that teachers deserve merit pay. I can spot them a mile away. I think the two go hand in hand, and that merit pay should absolutely be awareded those deserving souls who pour their hearts and wallets into their work each and everyday. It would need to be heavily regulated and disbursed as responsibly as the teachers who would earn it, but I beleive, just like bonuses awarded in the business sector, that teachers deserve a bonus for going above and beyond the call of duty. &quot;No, no and no! Because there are too many factors which a teacher can&apos;t control: the econony, familiy situations, death (of a student, or student&apos;s family member, for example), the weather (they are NOT cooling our rooms as much now to save money and in Arizona that can be devastating during standardized testing time), having a main-streamed yet challenged student (who brings down class averages) or having an especially difficult class. Not to mention personal challenges the teacher might be going through. No one, no where has addressed these issues when discussing merit pay. We all know teachers who have encountered these factors and he or she has no control whatsoever over them. Is that fair? It is the terrible, awful, no-good, very bad (to borrow from Judith Vorst) situation that is like keeping the whole class in from recess (unfair) or the unbelieveavbly stupid &quot;rewarding&quot; of the students with trinkets, food or candy (see AlfieKahn&apos;s brilliant, Punished by Rewards.) It sounds easy; pay the &quot;good&quot; teachers. Yet the good teachers will tell you that some years a class does surprisingly well on standardized tests and no one seems to know why. Was it the lack of the above mentioned factors? Yes, sometimes, and no, sometimes. Teaching is as much art as it is science. (Invarible some expert will assign a reason, when it is simply inexplicable.) Having taught for over thirty-one years I can tell you that I have seen it all. I have seen every half-baked fad that comes out of a big university be the latest and greatest and it seems to work, only to fall out of favor. Usually the reason is that teachers weren&apos;t following the program directly.Remember the &quot;open classroom&quot;? Few do, thank goodness. Are there things that are low-cost and no cost that make for good teaching and self-motivation among students? You bet. ASs us old-timers why we are still here. Ask why we still love teaching? The greatest compliment I ever got was when a student asked if I&apos;d still teach if I won a million dollars. I didn&apos;t get a chance to answer because another student answered for me. &quot;Yes, she would,&quot; he answered, &quot; &apos;cause she loves to teach.&quot; That is real merit pay.&quot;
 -- Elizabeth A. Hendrickson, 6th grade teacher, Irving Elementary, Mesa Public Schools, Mesa, AZ &quot;Merit pay sounds like a great idea, but, in practice, is not because the devil is in the details. How are administrators going to decide who gets paid more? Is there pay going to be merit based too? Part of determining students&apos; achievement is parental and administrative support, which is inconsistent among different schools and among different students. Some administrators are extremely supportive, while others are not. Some support certain departments at the expense of others. Some parents push their kids to succeed and others are more laissez-faire. What if, by the luck of the draw, a teacher gets a lot of students whose parents are more laissez-faire and are struggling? The teacher may be great, but without strong parental support, the teacher is financially penalized for doing the same, if not a better job, than they had done in years past, earning more pay. The unintended consequence of merit pay, or should I call it &quot;the emperor&apos;s new clothes,&quot; is that excellent teachers could be driven out of education. Ironically, an idea that seems to encourage improved performance because good teachers can earn more money may drive excellent educators out of the field because they cannot control all the variables that affect their pay. It&apos;s sort of blaming the teacher for the student coming late to school.&quot;
 -- Scott Gilbert, Social Studies Teacher, Seaford School District, Seaford, NY &quot;No. Teacher merit pay is not a good idea because there are special education teachers who teach low achieving students or gifted who teach high achieving students. Also, these same students are placed in a regular classroom. Who would want to teach a low-achieving student if it is based on merit pay? It can not be fairly implemented. It would also lead to other issues such as teachers altering tests/grades to receive the pay.&quot;
 -- Linda Arana, Teacher, Rapides, Alexandria, La. &quot;I think all exceptional teachers should be rewarded for their dedication to the education of our children. Most teachers are exceptional. I do not feel we can pay one teacher more than another, because many teacher do their job quietly without the &quot;look at me, I&apos;m so good&quot; attitude. Other teachers boost about their accomplishments and get the attention. I do feel that all teachers need to be paid more money to keep up with the rising cost of living. I feel teachers need incentives, which may lead to more pay, to further their education. In Texas, my pay is based on years of service, district above base, and an extra duty I perform. My base pay is the same as teachers with their master or doctrine degree--why would I want to spend more of my own money to get a higher degree? It won&apos;t affect my pay check.&quot;
 -- DJ Sanders, Technology teacher/coordinator, Fort Davis ISD, Fort Davis, TX &quot;Yes. Excellent teachers could use a little spark to show that they are appreciated.&quot; &quot;I do not believe merit pay would be a good idea because there is no way to quantify what makes a good teacher. Some say you could measure the students&apos; progress, a type of pre and post test score. I have been a regular classroom teacher and am now a special needs teacher. I know for a fact that a gifted teacher working with high functioning students can make progress by leaps and bounds, wheras getting even the tiniest bit of progress from many special needs students is cause for celebration! Not only could the cognitive ability of a student be a factor, but also teacher to pupil ratio, availability of instructional assistants, technology, and other uncontrollable variables too numerous to mention. There is no way to fairly distribute merit pay without quantifiable guidlines and control over thousands of variables.&quot;
 -- Wanda Allen, Special Education Teacher, Lincoln County/ Crab Orchard Elem. Sch., Crab Orchard, KY 40419 &quot;The fundamental issue I have with merit pay is the what are the merit standards and who determines that I have met them. After 15 years in the classroom I know the politics and pettiness that exists not only in my department but each supervisory layer that envelops the next. There are already too many &quot;little kingdoms&quot; to battle to do my job without adding this one. Will I be able to opt out of the competition for the extra bucks?&quot;
 -- Pamela Rainard, Earth Science Teacher, Isle of Wight County Schools, Smithfield, VA &quot;No. People believe Merit Pay will make better teachers. We have excellent teachers out there already. If the motivation is to make teachers better, get rid of tenure. It&apos;s outdated. Excellent teachers are let go, while &quot;less than&quot; teachers continue, and not only do they continue, but they continue as a bad teacher. I&apos;ve seen it, you&apos;ve seen it, parents have seen it... It&apos;s a tragedy. Somebody needs to do something.&quot;
 -- Susan Mello, Education SpecialistCalifornia &quot;No, We can not control when and if the student attends classes. The student does not learn when not in class. So now teachers are responsible for getting the student to school!! Is merit pay to please one individual, the supervisor or principal, or to really teach the students? Teachers are not tentured for three years. Is this not enough time for an administors to observe and rate the individual teacher? Teachers need a say in how this is done to avoid favoritism. I do not wish my name to be published. &quot;No, Teaching in the elementary grades requires a lot of working together and cooperating. Merit pay would make it hard to work together to plan, etc.&quot;
 -- Rhonda Hairell, teacher, Lauderdale County, Florence, Al &quot;No, it&apos;s too political and subject to the whims of too many people. Classes compare like oranges and apples. My class may be very bright and do well on the test. I just got lucky and have that mix. Someone elses class may not. Not a fair way to compare.&quot;
 -- Dave Boomgaard, Science Teacher, Mesa Public Schools, Mesa, AZ &quot;No, not all teachers are part of the merit pay. Have any teachers that are teaching Special Education recieving this? All teachers should recieve merit pay as we are so low paid to began with. Also we have a limitation of $250 on taxes for detuctions.&quot;
 -- K. K &quot;One of my colleagues has been a special ed. teacher for over 20 years. None of her students will ever test &quot;proficient&quot; on the state tests. Instead of earning &quot;merit&quot; pay, will she have to write a check? I&apos;ve taught for 23 years and have had my share of years with students who try hard but do not test &quot;proficient.&quot; Other years, I&apos;ve had classes where all the students tested &quot;proficient&quot; or &quot;advanced.&quot; I have no control over the makeup of my classes. My teaching doesn&apos;t change from year to year; I work very hard to help all of my students succeed. However, with merit pay, some years I&apos;d be rewarded for &quot;my&quot; success, while other years I&apos;d be punished. Merit pay is not the answer.&quot;
 -- Cynthia Britton, educator, Arcadia Unified/Foothills Middle School, Arcadia, CA &quot;No accurate way to measure &quot;merit.&quot; If one teacher gets lower level students and another get higher level students, it would be impossible to tell who should be given merit pay. Does an increase in test scores mean &quot;merit?&quot; &quot;I think it would be very difficult to determine an equitable way to objectively evaluate a teacher&apos;s performance. If it is administratively determined, naturally there would subjectivity in the evaluation. If is is determined by test results, then everyone would be teaching strictly to the tests. Also, some students do well in the classroom but do not perform well on tests. I have known teachers who have worked with low performing with all their hearts, but little, if any gains were made on standardized tests.&quot;
 -- Sandra A. Cox, teacher, Cabarrus County/ Concord Middle, Concord, NC &quot;There is no equitable way to distribute merit pay. It will cause competition and dirision among faculty member who work best when they work together. There will be lots of favoritism, much unrest and unhappiness.&quot;
 -- Sandra Carpenter, Middle School Social Science Teacher, Miami Dade County/ Miami Lakes K=-8 Center, Miami Lakes, Florida &quot;I&apos;m a bit concerned about merit pay. I&apos;m a transition to teaching teacher. Although I taught college-level courses and adult ed for years -- many of my students were veteran teachers -- I have only been certified to teach high school for seven. By the end of my first quarter teaching, I was deemed a &quot;terrible teacher&quot; and my school tried to get rid of me. I fought my way back and now, six years later and still in the same position, I just received a letter from the school board saying I was identified as &quot;one of the best teachers&quot; in the district by a local university and colleagues from other schools. What a difference a few years makes. I have not changed, my teaching style has not changed, the students have not changed. What has changed is the open-mindedness of the Administration and their perception of me as a teacher. I repeat -- I am a bit concerned abut merit pay. &quot;Yes! We teachers can get complacent as we age... though I work had not to (this being year # 30!)&quot;
 -- deb probert, gr. 2-6 teacher of academically gifted, douglas county school dist., minden, NV &quot;Absolutely not. What makes teaching is the diversity of the different styles and personalities. I know I am an alternative type teacher which connects with some students and the rigid type teacher connects with some. I have had principals that do not agree with my style but I know that I have reached many, many students in my 26 years of teaching.&quot;
 -- Lani Biddle, Special Education teacher, Edmonds School District, Lynnwood, WA &quot;NO. Look at the implications down the road. A teacher feels they derserve merit pay but doesn&apos;t get it. They quit. Others follow. Soon you have about 10% of the teaching staff at a school resigning. The kids are still there. What do they do with the kids? Give them to the teachers that are there. How good is any earned merit pay teacher going to be with an extra 20 or so kids to take care of besides the full load they have now?&quot;
 -- Hal Dalibor, Teacher, Milwaukee Public Schools, Milwaukee Wisconsin &quot;No. It just causes undo stress and won&apos;t make anyone a better teacher. I teach children with learning disabilities and it takes them a lot longer to be able to pass state tests. Will I end up working for free because I choose to teach the type of students I do. How is that fair or justified?&quot;
 -- Karen Rukke, Learning Specialist, Dallas School District, Dallas, Or &quot;Merit pay based upon what? If it is tied to teachers becoming better at their profession, then, yes, merit pay for professional development is good. If it is tied to test scores or some other artificial measurement based upon an unequal playing field then, no! We don&apos;t invite lesser teams to play the big boys in the NCAAs and then tell them they can only bring four players because they are not &apos;elite&apos;.&quot;
 -- Marc Severson, Teacher, Tucson Unified School District, Tucson AZ &quot;No, I think it would stop whatever commradierie there is left with teachers, less sharing and perhaps even cheating. I think we need to be paid a living wage like anyone else in the public domain with the same education, and I think that teachers need to be monitored and if they aren&apos;t doing their job, they need to be put on a growth plan and if that doesn&apos;t work, get rid of them. BUT, besides all that, education starts at home and until the parents are vested in their child&apos;s education, nothing will change.&quot;
 -- K.Sada, Teacher, SAISD, San Antonio, TX &quot;How will merit pay be determined? Most think that it will be tied to state testing scores. I&apos;m a special ed teacher. Because of disabilities, many of my kids will never meet standards, and the progress they do make may be very slow. Each child brings their own set of unique disabilities which means that their pace of progress will also be unique...how will you quantify that to determine merit pay for me. I am a good resource teacher and I work hard with each of my students. However, if my family must live on my salary AND that salary is based on merit pay which is based on state test results, then I will be looking elsewhere for a job.&quot;
 -- Willa Cree, Elementary Resource Teacher, Gilbert School District, Gilbert, AZ &quot;Merit pay is not a good idea. I work very hard to teach all my students. Some do very well and others do not care to learn and others are not capable of learn at the same level as their peers. Those students who do not want to learn usually have parents that do not believe that education is that important. Who is going to hold parents and students responsible for their acheivements. My parents supported the school and teachers. To tie my pay and my reputation to the attitudes of parents and students is very unfair. I also teach students with a variety of learning disabilities as well as diffirent IQs. We are not raising clones. We are teaching individuals. Everyone can not grow up to be President or a polititian or a teacher. Do we hold law makers responsible for the success or failure of their work? Do we deduct their pay when a law goes wrong or even when they break the law? Do we control doctors, lawyers and other professions responsible to the extent that some want to hold teachers. Even though teachers are paid much less then others with a Bachlors or Masters degree. AND &apos;NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND&quot; Obviously was not written by educators who are here in the threnches day after day. IT WILL NEVER WORK!!!! no matter how much money is invested or how many laws are passed or how many teacher you fire. By-the-way, Isn&apos;t there a shortage of teachers now. Do you believe that teachers will flock to the profession in the future until, children and parents and communities start to care again about learning. Many teachers that I know are discouraging prospective new teacher from coming in to education because we are wanting out of the profession. It takes lots of energy to become a teacher and continue teaching year after year while &quot;swimming against the tide&quot;&quot;
 -- Theresa Sims, TeeacherArkansas &quot;NO! I can only do my job. I am not responsible for the IQ that comes to me. I am responsible for helping that student become a productive person in our society. They may never score high on a test and I don&apos;t feel that I should be punished for that. Also, some teachers may start comprimising their morals to get &quot;merit pay&quot;.&quot;
 -- name withheld &quot;It could be a good thing if applied fairly. I have seen it used both fairly and in instances where less deserving staff have got the merits in spite of being far less meritorious than other members of staff. Beware the vocal staff against the quiet doers! It has sewn seeds of dissension where I have seen it applied- some staff feeling they were not good enough because others scored better. If, like contracts, they were confidential in nature, and were honetly awarded, it would become a motivation for staff to aim higher.&quot;
 -- Trevor Munroe, Principal, ESCOLA, Luanda, Angola &quot;Teacher merit pay is not a good idea if it is tied to standardized test scores. It is obvious to all of us who are &quot;in the trenches&quot; that our test scores are dependent on many factors over which we have little or no control. As teachers, we can do everything possible and still come up short with regard to test scores. Pressure like that causes teachers to simply teach how to pass a test while the actual learning of the subject matter suffers. I worry about our students&apos; expertise in every area except how to fake their way through a standardized test. If merit pay were to be tied to classroom observations and student work, I would agree with the concept, as long as it was made available to ALL teachers including fine arts.&quot;
 -- Danny Potter, Music Teacher, Dallas ISD, Dallas, TX &quot;No, not if one person has the final say if you get the pay or not. I have worked with some &quot;challengeing&quot; personalities that wouldn&apos;t have recomoned the pay. &quot;Yes, because it rewards the efforts of the &quot;good&quot; teachers. On the other hand no, because it separates teachers from their colleagues and promotes &quot;grand standing&quot; just to receive $, without really teaching concepts, etc.&quot;
 -- Danusia Workiewycz, Gate English teacher, TUSD/University HS, Tucson, AZ. &quot;I do not think merit pay is a good idea because as always I do not think there is a system of awarding this pay that would be totally fair in the selection of those who receive it. How can we know what teachers are doing in every classroom to the point of giving merit pay? Who would really be the right one to know what is going on to be able to select those merit teachers? There are just too many open questions that don&apos;t have answers. &quot;Teacher merit pay is not a good idea. There are too many variables that go into student progress. There also too many variables in how to measure student progress.It is a good idea however to get rid of bad teachers, but there are better ways to do it.&quot;
 -- Shauna Tanner, Teacher, Granite, Salt Lake City, Utah &quot;No I can not dictate who will be in my class, I think it would lead to teachers working to benefit themselves rather than working as a team. &quot;Right now, the idea of merit pay is very scary to me. How would it be determined if a teacher deserved it? Children are human beings, and many different things factor into student success. I am concerned that merit pay would be based solely on test performance, and I cannot see how that would be fair. Teachers have no control over the type of students they will teach each year, and some years are simply more difficult than others. However, I would like to see teachers rewarded for their efforts in trying to teach 21st century standards, attending workshops and using the newly obtained information in the classroom, using a variety of methods based on best practices, etc. But since we do not know exactly what the President has in mind to determine merit pay, I do not think it is a good idea at this time.&quot;
 -- Amy Cibik, 3rd grade teacher, Wetzel County/ New Martinsville School, New Martinsville, WV &quot;No because I can see how it can cause consternation among staff as it will put one teacher against another. What will the districts use to compare teachers?&quot;
 -- A concerned staff member, Teacher, Mount Carmel, Mount Carmel, PA. &quot;There are many pros and cons to merit pay for teachers. First of all, teachers definitely deserve to be paid more because every other high paying profession is based upon a good education during the K-12 years. I also feel that merit pay would be a good incentive for teachers to strive for excellence in their profession. My main concern with merit pay is the criteria that will be set forth to determine the merit pay. Student scores on state created or standardized tests are not necessarily a fair judgement of an effective teacher because so many variables come into play. How do you compare the scores of gifted and honors classes vs. regular classes vs. special education classes? All teachers know that some cohorts of students are brighter than others which impacts scores even when the teacher&apos;s basic pedagogy does not change. Hurricanes or other forces of nature interrupting the educational process is another factor that can impact scores and has nothing to do with teacher quality. Teacher evaluations by administrators can be bias and using external evaluators of teacher performance would be costly because evaluations would have to be frequent to truly assess teacher effectiveness. National Board certification is not necessarily a good criteria because a teacher can be very knowledgable about a subject and can write great essays and reflections and yet is not effective in the classroom. I have actually seen evidence of this in some of the classrooms that I have observed. I do think that some teachers deserve merit pay for going above and beyond what they are required to do but I don&apos;t know what criteria would be the fairest.&quot;
 -- RochelleLouisiana &quot;NO! I beleive Merit Pay would be used for discrimination purposes. Most adminstrators don&apos;t have the ability to be objective in observations and evaluations. A teacher who is not in &quot;GOOD STANDINGS&quot; with the evaluator can just forget about getting paid, regardless of the fact that their teaching skills and effectiveness may be superior. I also see it as an opportunity to encourage serious &quot;brown-nosing!&quot; The type of &quot;brown-nosing&quot; that could potentially bring about lawsuits.&quot;
 -- S. Marie Frieson, RetiredMuskegon, MI &quot;Absolutely, if thought out properly! Everyone who has taught knows their are different workloads from class to class and district to district. If the profession is to keep the top people this has to be recognized. A good merit system must involve a combination objective and subjective criteria by which to judge where a teacher stands on a pay schedule. We already do this when we increase pay for education and years on the job. Such criteria should be expanded to include objective criteria such as number of preps, class size and socioeconomic status of district (free lunch eligibility one criteria for school qualification). For instance a pay increase should be in order for any teacher having more than 2 preps or for class sizes over a stipulated number. Improved test scores should be included in the criteria, but represent only a portion of potential merit pay increase or decrease. Subjective criteria should also be an element to determine pay levels. But again, not a majority of the criteria. These would include factors such as peer and administrative evaluations. The sum total of these would be both objective and subjective and would assure that no single element or person could decide the fate of a teacher and their livelyhood. In this day and age of spreadsheets and computer generated reports such a matrix is not that difficult to construct. My view of a fair and comprehensive merit pay system is one that combines about 6 to 8, both subjective and objective criteria to determine a teachers pay level. In the final analysis getting the best teachers that feel fairly compensated in front of the classroom is what is good for kids. That is what our ultimate goal should be.&quot;
 -- Bill Ekroth, Teacher, David Douglas District/David Douglas High School, Portland, Oregon &quot;I&apos;m not going to lie and say I wouldn&apos;t accept the money if it were offered to me. After all, my students do well on achievement tests each year. However, what about those who teach special ed? Many of those students won&apos;t pass an achievement test, and that has nothing to do with the teacher&apos;s ability. We as teachers are supposed to differentiate, but that&apos;s not going to happen with teachers, is it? Is it really fair to hold all students and therefore all teachers to the same standard for a financial reward? I also hate the fact that there will inevitably be schools who cheat. But what I hate most about merit pay is that even MORE emphasis will be placed on standardized testing. Students today are tested to death to be ready for the state assessment. The pressure is on them to know test-taking strategies over the learning of REAL LIFE work skills. This is just plain wrong, and the worst thing about merit pay.&quot;
 -- Ligia Allison, Sixth Grade Language Arts Teacher, Spring ISD, Claughton Middle School, Houston, TX &quot;No, it pits teacher against teacher for more money. Competition kills collegiality in a school, collaboration is the key to providing a quality education system. Since there is not enough money available to give all competent teachers merit pay, then teachers will have to compete for those few dollars. When teachers compete they do not work together to create quality lessons for all students. This in turn will lower the overall quality of education wherever merit pay is inacted.&quot;
 -- Larry Richter, Technology teacher, Boise School District/Riverglen Junior High, Boise, Idaho &quot;Merit pay is divisive in the educational community, it plays into the politics of the community and the administration. Student performance is a compilation of many peoples efforts, parents, previous teachers, current teachers, specialists, support staff, and administration. It will be difficult for communities to budget money if the pay is undefined and arbitrary and will eventually force towns to budget for best case/worst case scenarios, not somethiing communities are ready to do, nor something taxpayers will acept.&quot;
 -- William Vitelli, Teacher &quot;Merit pay is only good where I can control the factors that lead to the extra dollars. In Minnesota there is controversy and criticism surrounding the fact that 99% of teachers under this pay scheme achieved their goals and therefore got a raise. This suggests to me there is a hidden curriculum with merit pay proponents attempting to keep teacher salaries at ridiculously low levels. In addition we need to quit the farcical discussion about how private business excels with the merit pay model...AIG anyone.&quot;
 -- John Rutherford, Emotional Disabilities Teacher, Northeast Metro ISD 916, St. Paul, Minnesota &quot;Yes Teachers need to be acknowledged for their good works. Merit increase is an excellent way of rewarding teachers. Good teaching methods deserve individual attention, so that it can be made an example for others. Teachers that receive merit raises show that they are in tune with accountability laws the govern the school systems.&quot;
 -- Delores Peters, Para-professional, Bogalusa City Schools, Bogalusa, LA &quot;All teachers should get an annual raise which is based on inflation. After that, teachers should get an additional merit raise based on their performance. This would give an incentive to teachers to give that extra effort, yet the inflational raise would ensure that all teachers maintain a decent standard of living.&quot;
 -- Michelle Landrum, Eighth Grade English Teacher, Lincoln School, San Jose, Costa Rica &quot;No, not all teachers teach core subjects. Not all teachers get a fair share on the student mix in the classroom-student mix being behavior and academic &quot;Merit pay for teachers is not a good idea. All teachers do not have an &quot;equal base&quot; with their students. Some teachers have gifted students, some have average students, some have below average students, some have students with special educational needs, some have students of different levels mixed together in one class. Teachers are assigned their class schedule--they do not get to select the students that they have. I am concerned about what would be the criteria that the merit pay award would be based upon--test scores?? student grades?? Another concern I have is who would decide or review the criteria to decide who receives merit pay? Some administrators may favor certain staff members for reasons other than how well a teacher does her job. I am concerned that merit pay awards would affect the cooperative efforts that teachers have now for the benefit of their students. I understand that merit pay would reward teachers that go above and beyond what is expected of them. These are the teachers involved in many aspects of student activities at school--in class as well as co-curricular activities, coaching, etc. It would not reward teachers that beat the bus out of the school parking lot. I agree that teachers need to be rewarded for their efforts since the salary is not as high as other professional jobs. I am just concerned that merit pay may not be the best option for educators.&quot;
 -- Sandra Colvin, Teacher/Dept Chair, Liberty High School, Bealeton, VA &quot;I do not believe that merit pay is a good idea. I have been teaching for forty years and sadly, I must say that all teachers are not evaluated fairly. Evaluations are very subjective. I have seen excellent teachers receive unfair evaluations because they were honest enough to bring up issues at staff meetings that the principal did not want to deal with. I teach in a building where there are no consequences for negative student behavior. Those of us who express our concerns are not looked upon favorably by the principal. Therefore, we would never receive a merit award. &quot;No. Teachers are not in the manufactoring business. We deal with young people. A factory gets raw material - all the same. Then a product is made with the raw material that&apos;s all the same. The product is all the same. Education is not a factory. Our raw material does not enter the hallways all the same. Our students come with emotional baggage carried over from home, work, or play. Our product will not be all the same. My raw material changes hourly and yearly. As a teacher, I want what&apos;s best for each and every student coming into my classroom. I don&apos;t want to crank out mediocrity in the name of testing. Because I care - because I do my job - how could anyone measure my cares or my worth in merit pay?&quot;
 -- Teri Estes, Teacher, Calcasieu Parish/ Molo Middle Magnet School, Lake Charles, LA &quot;NO!!!!! One teacher isn&apos;t better than the next in this system today. It&apos;s still who you know not ablities and were you are located. If you can get up and show up at school today, you are a good teacher.&quot;
 -- Carolyn Corey, Science teacher, Attala County School District, Camden, MS &quot;No, it&apos;s a terrible idea. What criteria will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of non-tested subjects like Social Studies, Art, Phys. Ed. and certain Sciences? In secondary schools where teams of teachers work with students how will it be decided which of the teachers is responsible for increases or decreases in student performance? Will one bad teacher keep the rest of theam from getting a bonus or will multiple poor or average teachers ride the coattails of superior teachers? How will the playing field be leveled for those schools and districts working with fewer resources than their richer counterparts? And by the way, why isn&apos;t Social Studies given priority in NCLB - Are the powers that be intentionally producing generations of socially, econoically, geographically and politically illiterate Americans or was that just an accident?&quot;
 -- Roddy W. HorneBaltimore, Maryland &quot;No, for several reasons. First, there are obvious problems with setting the criteria by which teachers will be judged for this merit pay. Who decides what the criteria is? Who is in charge of documentation? Would the merit pay be a once a year bonus that has to be earned every year or would it be an increase in salary? How involved will teachers be in deciding these and other important factors? Second, every teaching situation is different. Some teaching jobs are much more time consuming and difficult than others. In addition, teachers who do not have experienced and supportive administrators behind them have a much harder job maintaining discipline and thus being able to teach effectively due to forces that are beyond their control. Third, unfortunately, Tennessee tried something like this several years ago. It was called Career Ladder. What it amounted to was &apos;we will pay you an hourly rate to stay after school and work a longer day.&apos; While many teachers took advantage of this opportunity to make extra money, it is not a true merit pay system for a job well done. Finally, the biggest concern is that test scores will be the driving factor for determining which teachers are the best...and worst. As we all feared when high states testing began, we are rapidly approaching the day when teachers are evaluated based on these scores. There are so many factors that determine how a child does on a test that tying money to the results is ludicrous. The number one influence on a child&apos;s education is their home life. A factor which teachers have virtually no control over. We can&apos;t make them go to bed at a decent hour, we can&apos;t make them do their homework or study for tests. We can&apos;t eliminate the dysfunction at home that prevents many students from caring about anything but where their next meal is coming from and if mom will survive another night at home with dad, or boyfriend. How children learn, and the factors that influence how they learn are many. Teachers are an obvious factor, but they are certainly not the only factor. Building condition, educational resources, administrative support, district involvement, stakeholder interest, and family life all determine what a child&apos;s education will be. Do teachers deserve more money for the job they do? Yes. Should they be ranked and paid according to test scores or the numbers of hours they spend in the building? NO.&quot;
 -- Julie Combs, Technology Education Instructor, Clarksville Montgomery Co. Schools, Clarksville, TN &quot;Teacher merit pay is not a good idea. Teachers are only responsible for the class time that they spend with students. They have no control over their students&apos; home lives. Education and good study habits need to be encouraged, fostered and prioritized in the homes. Teachers cannot control from what backgrounds students come. They can only do their best to encourage and stimulate interest in learning for the short period of time that they have them in their classrooms. Apathy is prevelent in today&apos;s students. Teachers need parents to reinforce and encourage their students to do their best. This isn&apos;t happening too often. I could count on two hands the number of parents that have attended parent-teacher conference in the past twenty years that I&apos;ve been teaching. It&apos;s sad. The lack of parental involvement speaks volumes to the students. They reflect their parents&apos; lack of caring in their own lack of effort. I understand some parents are unable to attend because of work or other child related obligations, however, with phone and email accessiblity there is no reason for a student to continually fail and there be no effort on the parents&apos; part to get involved. Teachers have students in their high school class rooms with low elementary level reading abiltiy. This directly impacts their students&apos; ability to achieve and succeed. Teachers work very hard to motivate and educate their students. If they didn&apos;t care they wouldn&apos;t be teaching. To introduce merit pay is insulting to those educators who work with the lowest performing students. Teachers teach because they care about children. To evaluate their effectiveness based upon their students&apos; efforts is grossly unfair. &quot;It is up to everyone to ensure that s to do their part to ensure that all students are focused on the prize of significant achievement. I have been teaching for twelve years and have succeded with students showing significant gain during the school year. Often I wonder where is my gratifying experience . My school received the $3000.00 bonus money in 2008 for every employee whether they had anything to do with the hard work that must be done in order to achieve this. I don&apos;t think that is fair either. We were also taxed 50% and actually ended up with $1500.00 instead.&quot;
 -- LPLogan, Math Lead Teacher &quot;In theory it is a good idea, however it is quite difficult to implement. How to determine the merit of a teacher is difficult. Some teachers are lucky enough to teach the top students who will always perform well on tests. Other teachers have the lower end of the spectrum and those students traditionally do not perform well regardless of the teacher&apos;s merit. If someone could arrive at a FAIR way to judge teachers, then I say yes to merit pay. Otherwise, I say no.&quot;
 -- Beverly Pedersen, Teacher, Okaloosa, Ft. Walton Beach, Florida &quot;I do not think merit pay is a good idea. I have been teaching for 25 years I have not heard of a fair way to give merit pay. If you judge by test scores what would you do with all the coaches, counselors, etc. that doesn&apos;t have student test scores. If you judge by your teacher evaluation,I don&apos;t think they are thorough enough. I guess it depends on how they will determine the merit pay as to if it will work.&quot;
 -- Yvonne Westfall, Special Education Teacher, Jessieville School, Jessieville,Ar &quot;Merit pay is fine if the criteria is fair. There has to be enough of an incentive for teachers to teach or to continue teaching in inner city schools where the students are not starting out on a level playing field with other students. Measuring incremental progress in ways other than just test scores would have to be implemented in order for merit pay to work well.&quot;
 -- Elisa Gonzalez, Teacher, San Antonio ISD/W.W.White Elementary, San Antonio, Texas &quot;That really depends on how &quot;meritorious&quot; performance is defined. I firmly believe in accountability for what we do as educators, but I question the use of students&apos; performance on standardized tests as the basis for merit pay. Wouldn&apos;t it be better to recognize the creation of outstanding learning environments and experiences with merit pay?&quot;
 -- Carol Schwartz, Educational Technologist, NorthWest Ohio Computer Association, Perrysburg, Ohio &quot;Yes! Why should a mediocre teacher be paid the same as an outstanding teacher?? It would encourage teachers in the same way that others in the business workforce are motivated...with bonuses for success and exceeding expectations.&quot;
 -- Melanie Coetsee, SLPColumbia, SC &quot;I think that teacher accountability for good teaching is necessary, but merit pay is discriminate because of the zoning of schools. Many schools are in poverty areas and research supports that written literature in a home is a strong indicator of literacy. Is it fair for a teacher who has to educate a student with less skills to be paid based on the same merits as those teachers that have students from a literature rich environment. Background knowledge alone is another indicator of how quickly a student can learn. Wealthy homes have a wider range of experiences and a more in depth background knowledge. If demonstrating growth was the measuring stick then yes, merit pay would be good, but a flat scale of pass or no pass on standardized test is not a fair system.&quot;
 -- Wanda Rice, Instructional Lead Teacher, Valdosta City School System, Valdosta, GA &quot;No! It&apos;s not that I don&apos;t believe in the concept of performance pay. It&apos;s that I don&apos;t believe it can be done equitably in teaching. For core teachers I can see where gain scores could be used relatively fairly, however, I have never seen a plan that I thought was fair to include all others who would be eligible. Perhaps it would not be such a bear if teachers were already making professional quality salaries such as those made by doctors, lawyers, architects, and even plumbers and firefighters! &quot;No, you have no control over the group of students you get. I have seen teachers become hoarders and others become spies. We must be a united team if we are to do what needs to be done. &quot;Yes, because a teacher does a lot inside and outside the classroom to prepare the student for the future. These students include special education and the students that are not going to college. The teachers that want to be in the classroom are on going learner. They have to keep learning in order to be highly qualified.&quot;
 -- Rhonda Y. Williams, Special Education Teacher, Walker County, LaFayette, GA &quot;If the teacher&apos;s could be identified without bias, favoritism, etc., yes it would have merit. Does it also have a % of total teachers that are allowed to be identified as candidates for merit pay. If we could do more to give everyone the deserved pay and eliminate those teachers that are not effective in the classroom, then we wouldn&apos;t have to worry about merit pay.&quot;
 -- Karen Cunningham, L/CRT, Highlands/Cracker Trail Elementary, Sebring, Florida &quot;Hmmmm, then would everyone get &quot;As?&quot; Would anyone want to teach Special Ed students? Such questions may be endless... &quot;Yes. Teachers work very hard for the most part and put in a lot of their own hours and their own money to create teaching materials, room decorations, parent communications, etc. Those who work at being good teachers by keeping their skills current, connecting with their students and parents and working to make the classroom a place of true learning should receive monetary benefit. There should be ongoing evaluations to access these things and not just one type or occurrence of evaluation. An aside-Teacher&apos;s pay should not be based on the standardized tests alone. When this happens teachers who have a high percentage of low functioning students in their classrooms are punished. If standardized tests are used as part of the salary discussion, then the entrance and present and exit level of the students in the class should be discussed. That way teachers who are working to improve the lives of students in impoverished areas would not be punished for the lack of high scores among their students.&quot;
 -- C. Lee, Former Elementary TeacherAransas Pass, TX &quot;Bad idea: No control over student population Some teachers are not in position to give grades or assessments (ex: Library media specialists) Special ed students on very mixed levels No clear cut rubric to base merit pay on - ex: students who don&apos;t test well affect teacher&apos;s pay loss of creativity when the grade is all that matters&quot;
 -- Laurie Twist Binder, School Library Media Specialist, City of Buffalo, Buffalo, NY &quot;I think that teachers who work very hard should be financially recognized. However, I question if the selection of who should receive the pay will always be impartial. I presently work in a building where only people who belong to a &quot;click&quot; receive recognition. I also know that the principal does not realize how biased she has become. &quot;not really. Teachers are expected to more and more things in a shorter day. Our kids are the ones suffering as we are spending mroe and more time teaching to the test instead of teaching life lessons. We are not able to get to know our kids on a personal level, just information about their reading and math scores. Let&apos;s get rid of NCLB, teacher merit pay and get to know our kids.&quot;
 -- Sandie c.Minneapolis, MN &quot;No. Why can&apos;t we just get a professional salary that compares with other professional fields like law and medicine? Even the un-degreed people working on car assembly lines make more than teachers. Oh, and I can&apos;t even buy one of their cars or get any other loans because I don&apos;t make enough money. Stimulus package for car manufactures! All teachers have 4+ year degrees and continue to re-certify their professional status as required to keep their teaching certification. This, on top of the numerous licensure tests we have to pass just to start teaching. Beginning teacher salary must rise, as should the base pay for years of experience. I have been teaching 20 years, and like I said, I can&apos;t even get a car loan... I&apos;m talking a used car. I also have three part time jobs to try and pay college tuition. Both are currently at state universities.&quot;
 -- Quin Dionne, Teacher, Cabarrus, Concord,NC &quot;It is a great idea if we could guarantee that the three thirds involved in a child&apos;s education all perform as they should. The teacher is one third, the parents are one third, and the student is the final third. As a teacher I can control my one third, but I don&apos;t control the other two thirds and that can make or break the deal. Fortunately, I teach in wonderful district where most parents are committed to their children&apos;s education. Most of the children also are committed to doing their best and usually do quite well. But most isn&apos;t all, and until we can insure all students, all parents, and yes, all teachers will always do their full share, then merit pay isn&apos;t going to work effectively.&quot;
 -- Joe Cavagnuolo, Grade 5 Teacher, Trumbull, Connecticut &quot;As a special education teacher, it would be very difficult to evaluate me based on my students&apos; performance on any standardized test. I am concerned about merit pay for two main reasons: 1) it has the potential to make teaching very competitive, instead of collaborative and 2) standardized testing does not truly evaluate the learning of many students, particularly those with learning disablities. Even though I believe that it seems unfair to lump all teachers together, the &quot;good&quot; with the&quot;bad,&quot; merit pay is not the answer. Will the next proposal include evaluations by students and parents as to the popularity of teachers? I know there should be a way to reward good teaching, but I don&apos;t believe merit pay, based on students&apos; test scores, is the right way to accomplish this.&quot;
 -- Linda Kolmodin, Special Education Teacher, Olivet Community Schools, Olivet, MI &quot;ANY opportunity for extra pay is a great idea...(especially in my district!!!) So, yes, I believe teacher&apos;s should be rewarded for their vigilant work. However, a good teacher is one who works vigilantly day in and day out. I don&apos;t want to start looking at my students as &quot;earning potential.&quot; My students struggle w/learning disabilities, so my intrinsic &quot;duty&quot; is to work hard to help become successful. I am proud of the academic strides most of my students make...whether it&apos;s because of me, solely, or their other 7 teachers...??? I don&apos;t know...I&apos;m torn, because I&apos;m broke most, if not all of the time...I&apos;m just so tired of the &quot;politics&quot; entering the classroom...we&apos;ve become far removed from education being truly about the students...I think this &quot;merit pay&quot; would widen the chasm. I need to earn more money...yes, I&apos;m just not sure if the &quot;proper&quot; way would be on the &quot;academic backs&quot; of my students. Thanks&quot;
 -- Toni Giaquinto, SPED Teacher, Miami Dade County, North Miami Beach, FL &quot;I do not feel that it is evident of a good teacher as many principals have &quot;pets&quot;! Those people do absolutely little or nothing and get all the awards and perks! The ones who follow the rules, go by Federal Law, and want what is best for the child stay in trouble for making waves trying to protect the children&apos;s right to an education! NO, I do not feel merit pay is a good idea because it does not REALLY award those who do a good job, it awards the YES MEN!&quot;
 -- DC, Teacher, Miami Dade Schools, Miami, FL &quot;While I believe that the concept of merit pay seems like a good idea on the surface, I also believe that in practice it would be flawed. Favoritism is just too big of a factor for many people in today&apos;s school systems. We see it practiced daily in our schools. One teacher can do no wrong in the eyes of an administrator regardless that others see clearly the committing of major infractions of the rules and continually receives rewards, while another really good and dedicated teacher can do no right and is &quot;called on the carpet&quot; and &quot;chewed out&quot; for the smallest infraction, whether real or imagined. &quot;It may be sa great idea. Last year we took part in a grant that offered us extra money to collaborate on lesson plans. I think every one of our teachers did everything possible to earn every dollar they could. If there would be merit pay, teachers would be working as hard as possible to earn that extra pay.&quot;
 -- Ben Goertz, Special Ed. Teacher, HISD, San Antonio,Texas &quot;Sure, but how are you going to quantify it? How do you compare honors teachers to regular ed or ESE. I would love merit pay, but I am not going to waste all my time writing papers to show how smart I am, like we do it now. Look at my students progression, five them a before an after test and tell me what they need to know and I will make it happen.&quot;
 -- dave falcone, teacher, Marion Forest High School, Ocala, FL &quot;No, because not all classes are created equal in IQ&apos;s. That is, if the merit pay is based on test scores. If you have the learning disabilities class or children who have a lower IQ that year, then your scores will reflect that in some ways. If it&apos;s not based on test scores, then who will determine the teachers to get the merit raises? I am all for extra pay for great work, but once again, how is that going to be measured? Also, where is the money going to come from? I know our district would like to use this merit pay money to keep some of our teachers who are being RIF&apos;d because of lack of funding and the bond issues not passing.&quot;
 -- Cathy Fuller, Teacher, Tallmadge city Schools, Tallmadge, Ohio &quot;Oh yes. Some teachers go above and beyond. For example game duty, tutoring,filling in during their own planning period for anothjer teacher, or being on the SIT team. These awsome teachers should get extra pay for their extra efforts.&quot;
 -- Manuela Smith, Teacher, Cumberland Co. Douglas Byrd High, Fayetteville,NC &quot;The population of a classroom is not based on the same model as the NFL draft. We are not given dossiers of each student, and then we are all brought together to draft the best students for our classrooms. We get what we get. No matter how good of a teacher I am, I can do nothing to increase the happiness of my students. I am not responsible for their happiness either. I cannot follow them home and make sure they do their homework. I cannot make their parents love them anymore so that they have a feeling of self-worth. I cannot make their parents give them move attention because they feel they return to a home that is in chaos and devoid of stability and giving a child a sense of responsbility. With all these outside influences working against teachers, how can we be expected to have our performance based on a criteria that we have absolutely no control over? Merit pay will open other cans of worms, like favoritism by administration as well as creating a large teacher turnover in a district. Is there a way to make the true stakeholder in education, the parent, more responsible for the welfare fo their child? Can we legislate that into our collective conscience? Can we legislate into our society the fact that all students learn in different ways and at different levels, but we expect thatm all, by 2014, to be able to pass all standardized tests? Don&apos;t waste the time of educators with topics that they have no control over and are hardly able to make a difference when all the chips are stacked against us from the start.&quot;
 -- John Biondi, Teacher - 6th GradeBridgewter, NJ &quot;No, merit pay is not a good idea because we could never agree on how it would be earned. Also, how would you deal with specialists? Special Ed teachers support the classroom teacher. Library Media specialists do not have classes assigned to them. Reading teachers only work with small groups. Science coaches don&apos;t have a classroom assignment. How could you exclude those teachers? Merit pay would pit teacher against teacher&amp;create ill will. Merit pay would create a division between the &quot;haves&quot; and the &quot;have nots&quot; and end consultation as we know it.&quot;
 -- Rebecca Bergeron, K-8 Math&amp;Science Resource Teacher, Cromwell Public Schools, Cromwell, CT &quot;No, everyone involved with teaching a child, from the custodian, to the lunch server, to the teacher deserves credit. It has to be a team effort, therefore, everyone should be given a fair wage in order to achieve academic gains.&quot;
 -- Diane McDowell, Teacher, Miami-dade, Miami, Florida &quot;No, there is no one way to fairly establish it. Every teaching area has their own criteria that spells success. Every teacher has individual classroom challenges and student aptitudes. Some teachers get the cream of the crop without any behavioral issues, and others get the &quot;sweathogs&quot;. Some areas have one-on-one and others get 35+. We could set it up like AIG and give huge bonuses no matter what the outcome!&quot;
 -- hans Van Den Bosch, teacher, Wicomico County, Salisbury, Md. &quot;Sure it is if there is a way to monitor it set the goals up front and make the goals fair. Hey Look how well those guys from AIG did they just called it a bonus :)&quot;
 -- Scott wycert, TEDS, BOCES, Monroe NY &quot;I disagree with this concept because their are to many variables we have no control over. We do not determine the number of standards to be covered. Teachers are not in the home to see that homework and review takes place. Teachers are not in the home to see that children are well fed and they have the proper materials to study. Teachers have no control over whether a diagnosed ADD or ADHD child gets the medical help they deserve. We try our best to motivate and encourage success but they may not be enough for a &quot;merit&quot; raise because everything is based on testing. &quot;It depends - if it only is based on test scores, that wouldn&apos;t be a fair determinate of merit pay. So many teachers are excellent, but either their population makes test scores an inaccurate barometer of merit, or their discipline isn&apos;t tested. By the way, testing is out of hand, and way too many teachers teach to the test (does that make them great teachers?).&quot;
 -- Arlene Golestein, Social Studies teacher, Upper Freehold Regional Middle School, Allentown, New Jersey &quot;Depends. If teacher merit pay is based on student performance then not necessarily. If my paycheck (and more importnatly my reputation because our salaries and &quot;merit pay&quot; figures would be public information) is based on student achievement then I get to pick the students I want in my classroom. Why would I want low performing students if they are going to reduce my &quot;success&quot; rate and therefore my paycheck? If merit pay is based on student effort than maybe. I think every student deserves a full year of growth (or more!). If my merit pay is based on student growth I might be ok. That said, I want to tell the public and government figures one thing. If I was motivated soley by money then I would not have given up my $80K engineering job to spend $20K to get a teaching certificate. Then take a $33K job and spend $25K to get a master&apos;s in education. If the public thinks teaching is about the pay they are sadly mistaken. I&apos;m here to teach, because I love empowering young students with something no one can take away from them, knowledge and the courage to use it. &quot;Merit pay for groups/teams might be worth a try, but individual merit pay has already proved that it only promotes competition, rather than collaboration among teachers. How about merit pay for mentoring? Leading or participating in a task force or &quot;growth group&quot; of some kind? I have been around long enough to see individuals &quot;do anything for the money&quot; and the pursuit becomes divisive, rather than edifying.&quot;
 -- Cyn Vargo, Education Specialist, DoDEA, Ft. Bragg, NC &quot;Merit pay is not a good idea. I can think of no way to apply a fair and unbiased method of determining which teachers would deserve merit pay. One cannot base it on student scores; not every teacher teaches a grade level where students take required tests. Moreover, any good teacher knows that there are several factors that play into how a student does on a standardized test. Merit pay based on student performance on any test, standardized or end-of-course, does not take into account home factors, drama of the day, test anxiety, financial opportunities of the district, etc. If merit pay is based on student performance, teachers who already teach in wealthy and high-performing districts would get more money than teachers who teach in districts of poverty, and teachers of poor districts already make less money than their counterparts. Furthermore, teaching is a collaborative event. I fear that merit pay will make it more cutthroat. Will good teachers still share ideas and work with their peers? Yes, of course. But new teachers might be more hesitant to share their ideas, or to collaborate with others. They make less already, and many would be hungry to earn the merit pay. If who gets merit pay is determined by administration, personal feelings may come into play. Teachers would become fearful of voicing a dissenting opinion for fear of losing the extra pay. Some teachers have already learned the hard way that administrators have a lot of power when it comes to what the school day looks like for a teacher, and adding financial power to that equation could lead to big problems. I think salary raises across the board is a better use of money. However, I do think that the time period in which a school can let a teacher go without giving just cause should be extended to 3 or 4 years. After 3 or 4 years, any new and young teacher should be able to &quot;get it together&quot; enough to offer an enriching learning experience for their students. If a teacher is not doing his job effectively based on evaluations by other teachers and administrators, he should be let go. The good teachers would be the ones who keep their jobs and are rewarded by the salary and respect of the district, not merit pay.&quot;
 -- Julie Rine, English teacher, Minerva Local, Minerva, Ohio &quot;Yes. Most professions have some form of merit pay that is based upon annual performance. The challenge lies in determining how to award the pay. I think the answer here is to base it upon an annual fromative and summative assessment approach. Take a pretest in the fall and a posttest at the end of the year. Determine merit for percentile increase of student.&quot;
 -- Andrew Palmer, Full Time Substitute, Kearney School District, Kearney, MO &quot;I have serious concerns. If a teacher has set themself up to receive the better students (and this does occur), and they are selfpromoting in other ways, they can appear to be a better teacher. The teacher who by chance or choice works with the disadvantaged and otherwise low achieving children will not &quot;look&quot; as good, when in fact they may have made remarkable gains with many, or even some, of the children. Although many see education as a factory that can turn out remarkable products, the variables are so great and teachers are only able to control a few elements in the product production. I feel that school divisions have the responsibility to have a salary scale that attracts quality teachers, and that they also have a system for evaluation that recognizes good teaching and weeds out weak or poor teacheers.&quot;
 -- Linda Sidebottom, Student Support Specialist, Williamsburg-James City County, Williamsburg, Virginia &quot;Merit pay is most definitely not a good idea. It fosters unfriendly competition and &quot;hiding&quot; new and usable strategies from others. We could start keeping all of our best tricks to ourselves for the &quot;ka-ching&quot; factor.&quot;
 -- Brian Drake, Science Teacher, Cab Calloway School of the Arts, Wilmington, DE &quot;No, I don&apos;t think so. The playing field will not be equal for all teachers. Teaching is not like a manufacturing job where you might be evaluated on how many pieces of clothing you turn out. Evaluating teachers is not &quot;cut and dried&quot;. Much of it is subjective. If I were going to be evaluated on test scores, I would much rather have the smartest and most well-behaved stuldents in the school. Many students, especially in inner city schools, could care less whether they do well on standardized achievement tests. Many will mark answers just to get through early. Some come from poor environments and don&apos;t get enough sleep. I have had students who slept through the tests. As much as I hate to disclose this information, many (not all) teachers cheat. Politics would play a part in who was chosen to receive merit pay. Teachers who felt that they deserved merit pay but did not get it, would be very unhappy. The morale among teachers would be low. If this were a perfect world, and everybody was fair and honest, it would be a good thing.&quot;
 -- Melanie Thornton, Retired (after 39 years), Memphis City Schools, Memphis, Tennessee 38127 &quot;No, while competition among teachers may improve teaching slightly, I feel that in the end it will destroy moral, collaboration and be very divisive. We currently have a teacher of the year program and many excellent teachers will not participate because they do not want to be singled out for a job well done because it is what they were hired to do. I also feel that merit pay, like any other form of teacher evaluation, is unfairly subjective and would hurt excellent teachers who don&apos;t always fit the &quot;mold&quot; of their assessors but get the job done with great success.&quot;
 -- Rosemary Venditto, Librarian, Plainville Community Schools, Plainville, CT &quot;Depending on how it is structured. I feel it is time for teachers who are outstanding to be recognized. But if we are going to use test scores results as a sole determinant we may not have a true picture. For many students are inspire by the vitality or excitement a teacher brings to them.&quot;
 -- William Fritz, classroom teacher, CPS schools, Carsonville, MIchigan &quot;No, there are factors out of a teacher&apos;s control. The student&apos;s homelife for one and inclusion for another. I could agree with a teacher recieving a bonus based on set terms. Merit pay is not okay.&quot;
 -- Kimberly Corfield Springham, Elementary Teacher, Balt.Co. CES, Catonsville, MD &quot;Yes. Most every occupation gets merit pay. Actually, raises are based on performance along with promotions. Teachers deserve and have earned step increases and cost of living increases. Merit pay would also be an incentive for teachers to do a good job. &quot;I have a classroom of 28 students, in a 90% free/reduced school,who are all very capable and could be excellent students if they chose to be. I motivate, I do positives, I have high expectations, I reward and I even threaten to fail them. I bust my butt to give them the best education they can get. One year, myself and another teacher raised test scores in one content area by 20 pts. I know my students can do well on the test. However, this year, I had 2 students that both owed me 15 math assignments each when report cards came out even though I did all the above and also let their parents know repeated times. I have one student so severe ADD that even having an adult sit right next to him doesn&apos;t get him to pay attention or listen. Mom is just now working with me. I have another who I&apos;ve charted as having to say something to him over 22 times in a day, but mom refuses to see that there is any problem, even though he disrupts the other student&apos;s learning. I have another whose behavior I tell mom about everyday and even once involved the police, but mom refuses to see him as anything other than her angel. I have one whose mom just doesn&apos;t care about him and lets someone else take care of him and another whose dad was shot and killed a few months ago. Neither one really cares about school and how they do. My point, is that even though I&apos;m trying harder this year than other years, I&apos;m not expecting my test scores to go up. I&apos;ll be happy to maintain, but I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s even realistic. I&apos;m not giving up, but should I be penalized or not get as much pay as someone who works less than me but ends up with better scores? And if I end up with less pay, wouldn&apos;t that make me and others like me who like a challenge and feel they can make a difference, rethink whether we want to stay in our schools or not? Obviously, the students would suffer in the long run. So NO, merit pay it not a good idea.&quot;
 -- Kim, 4th grade teacher, Jefferson Co., Louisville, Ky &quot;NO!!! There is no accurate way to measure teachers&apos; performance when competing with differences in schedules, student populations, teaching assignments, and the individuals students&apos; backgrounds. We are not on an equal footing in any way. Are those of us who work with the upper grades responsible for whatever has been experienced by each student in the lower grades? Are those of us whose students&apos; command of English is weak because they have ot been in the country long to compete with native English speakers&apos; students? How?&quot;
 -- Joanne Vicente, English IV Teacher, South Miami High School (Miami-Dade Public Schools), Miami, Florida &quot;No, it&apos;s not fair ro base pay on students test scores&quot;
 -- Ava Miller, Teacher, Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pa &quot;No. Equality and solidarity are the capstones of teachers associations for a good reason. It is a terrible idea to state that teachers in one discipline have more value than those in other discplines.&quot;
 -- Ben Cassel, Teacher, Sweetwater High School/Sweetwater High School District, National City CA &quot;I do not consider merit pay a good choice for continuing a teacher&apos;s contract. If the merit pay is based on student test scores solely there could be many teachers discharged from their positions if they worked in a low ses. I have also seen at the middle school level an entire student body decide to purposely flunk a test because they did not like their teacher. I actually overheard them discussing this. If merit pay had been in effect at this time this particular teacher would have been let go.&quot;
 -- Janell Wine, Title 1 teacher &quot;Yes, but difficult to structure. An acceptable evaluation would consider the level of the students, the number in a class, the stability of the classroom population (In some areas, families move often.), and a standardized method of goals achieved. Those in the arts or special education would need a different standard from those in regular classroom classes, such as English and Math. Honors classes would have a different criteria from average, technical or business classes. IT IS DOABLE! I&apos;m sure there are models around the country.&quot;
 -- Muriel Daniels, ESL teacher, Augsuta Technical College, Augusta, GA 30909 &quot;It rewards teachers who believe that the greatest calling is to teach. One does not have to be promoted to be seen as an excellent educator. The greater the promotion the further you are removed from actually teaching students. We need to reward teachers who want to stay in the classroom because they have the opportunity to help students achieve directly. As a profession and as a community, we need to value those who choose to stay in the classroom.&quot;
 -- Andrew Puls, elementary/primary school teacher, St. Charles Borromeo Primary School, Melbourne, Victoria. Australia &quot;No, no, no. I am a student teacher who will be looking for my first job right around the time this would truly begin to be in effect. I can foresee the class that I, as a brand new teacher, would &quot;get.&quot; It would contain all the students with whom the veteran teachers have found to be difficult to work. I don&apos;t mean that the veteran teachers cannot deal with these children, I just see that they will find it easier to receive their own merit pay if they do not have these students in their classes. And as the veteran, they will have first choice. How would I know, when I have never worked in that school, or possibly even in the district before that year? I don&apos;t think the veteran teachers would do this to be mean to those of us who are new; I just see it as becoming the rule. Following that, how would I and other new teachers be able to show that we are effective teachers? Merit pay is almost guaranteed to be based on students&apos; test scores. With the class I foresee, I would love to achieve those improved scores, but I don&apos;t know that I would be able to make enough of a difference for that many students in my first year of teaching, which is as much a learning experience as are these months of being a student teacher.&quot;
 -- Jan Wolf, Student TeacherIndiana &quot;It is BUT how does one &quot;measure who is doing a better job?&quot; Unfortunately it all comes down to who gets on better with the powers that be. It is all subjective. Although there are dedicated ladies and gents out there who in today&apos;s age of extra paperwork etc, who still find the time and effort needed to make learning exciting! Teaching for them is still a passion. That feeling of &quot;Yes! XXX finally grasped the concept,&quot; is still real and they have a love for learning that they want to share and for this they should be rewarded. HOWEVER there are others for whom teaching is just a job. For these people who destroy the love for learning, other work should be found.&quot;
 -- Roz Schorn, Mrs, Plettenberg Bay, South Africa &quot;Perhaps if teachers were paid better to begin with, the market would be more competitive for hiring and we would have an overall better quality teacher pool to choose from; people would be more apt to seek out the profession. Merit pay will likely reward a few and make many other great teachers resent those rewarded. This will do nothing for morale.Washington State &quot;No. This is not a sales position. This is a professional job and teachers are professional paid to do a job just like anyone else to the best of their ability according to the guidelines set. Teaching is stressful enough dealing with kids who don&apos;t want to learn, disrespectful parents and unsupportive adminstrators now even more pressure from the state and federal goverment waving merit pay under our nose like some magic portion is ludicrist. We&apos;ll lose a lot of great teachers if this plan is implemented. &quot;NO! NO! NO! This will only pit teacher against teacher, cause negative moral, and limit cohesive interaction among the staff. In stead of building comerodiry, cohesiveness, and a sense of &quot;working together as a team&quot; between staff members, the friction within the schools will negatively affect the children, thereby defeating the sole purpose of merit pay. We have read in the papers where affairs have taken place between teachers and administrators. How do you think that teacher&apos;s teaching proformance will be evaluated? What about the teacher who questions the policies or politics of the administrator (whether right or wrong)? How will that teacher&apos;s rating look? And if the ratings are based on test scores, city schools will always fall behind the affluent suburban schools. That simply would not be a fair bases in which to assess a teacher&apos;s ability to teach. I could go on an on about this because I am strongly against it. So I will end now.&quot;
 -- Grace A. Barnes, Retired teacher of 40 years, Retired from dist. # 102, La Grange, IL &quot;THE MAIN PROBLEM WITH MERIT PAY IS WHO DECIDES WHAT IS WORTHY BEHAVIOR TO BASE THE PAY UPON... CAN&apos;T USE TEST SCORES BECAUSE SOOOOO MANY ELEMENTS GO INTO A STUDENT&apos;S SUCCESS... FOR EXAMPLE MY STRONGEST STUDENT THIS YEAR JUST DID A NOSE DIVE... DOESN&apos;T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING FROM DANCE TO ACADEMICS.... WHY... HER PARENTS ARE GETTING A DIVORCE..... 3 OTHER KIDS ARE FLAT LINERS DO TO LITTLE OR NO HOME SUPPORT.... AS WELL AS ... UNSTIMULATING HOME LIFE.... SO ALTHOUGH MERIT PAY SOUNDS GOOD.... I DO NOT THINK THERE IS A RELIABLE WAY TO DETERMINE WHO SHOULD GET HOW MUCH.... IF MERIT PAY COULD BE A REFLECTION OF WORK OUTSIDE THE NORM DAY.... OR ADVANCED EDUCATION/PROF DEV THEN THAT HAS SOME POTENTIAL.... NATIONAL BOARD CERTIFIED TEACHERS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE .... TEACHERS WHO TUTOR 1 - 3 KIDS AFTER/BEFORE SCHOOL AT NO COST TO THE CHILD... TEACHERS WHO BRING RESOURCES INTO THE SCHOOL THROUGH GRANT WRITING, FUNDRAISING, ETC.... ANOTHER GOOD WAY TO &quot;MEASURE.&quot;&quot;
 -- MARY WHITELEY, K-TEACHER, LAUSD, GLENDALE, CA &quot;I believe good teachers should be compensated. They should be compensated first, by being able to keep their job! Second, teachers should receive raises based on their performance. Teachers that are not doing their job should, the same as in any other job, not be able to keep their job or receive the same pay raise as the person down the hall who gives their entire heart to their students and does a wonderful job teaching them as well. Having a union tell the taxpayers that every teacher deserves the same amount of a raise is ridiculous, you can&apos;t walk into a bank, a restaurant, or the local law firm and tell them that they are going to all get the same raise, no matter what their performance (that really isn&apos;t encouraging people to give their best, is it?), so why should we expect any different for our teachers? So I say, let&apos;s encourage our teachers to be the best they can be, give pay raises based on performance and get rid of tenure and teachers that aren&apos;t pulling their weight in our school systems!&quot;
 -- Cassandra, Be The Best &quot;Merit pay is not a good idea. It would be very difficult to determine the criteria necessary to earn it. Our students are so diverse and unpredictable. As it stands right now, teachers are supportative of each other and this extra pay, would just cause hard feelings and possibly an unfair advantage for those who teach APP and other higher level classes.&quot;
 -- Pat, SLD Teacher, CCSD - DHS, Las Vegas, NV &quot;Yes. many teachers put in an enormous amount of time with their students i.e. giving up their lunch, conference times and after school tutoring students who are having difficulty with the subject matter which they are responsible for. I know many teachers who get off and actually leave as soon as they are permitted and then there are the select ones (dedicated) who are at the school up to 4 hours after all the students have left for home. These teachers deserve to be rewarded for all their time and dedication to teaching the students. However, it should not only be based on standardized testing, but also their appraisals form the administrators. These professionals are not receiving any more pay but are also giving the more challenged students and extra duties above and beyond their peers. Also, there has to be a way to recognize the special education teachers as well. Many of us go well above and beyond yet the teacher of record gets the credit when the individuals pass the standardized test.&quot;
 -- Alan Rheel, Special Education Behavioral Teacher, Del Valle ISD, Austin, Texas &quot;In some ways, it could be because we have many teachers who go above and beyond the call of duty. However, I have worked with kids who had such an attitude. It could possibly happen that kids would not do well if they knew a teacher&apos;s raise depended on how they scored on a test. I do feel if a teacher is not willing to teach with and from the heart, they need to go. I just don&apos;t feel comfortable with student test scores deciding if teachers deserve raises.&quot;
 -- Malinda Plummer, third and fourth grade science teacher, Des Arc Elementary School, Des Arc, Arkansas &quot;I’m not for merit pay. The fairness of merit pay depends entirely upon the determining criteria. If the evaluation takes into account the progress of the individual student in its entirety, including crushing poverty and unbelievable home situations, then perhaps it could be fair. However, judging from the way my district honors its teachers, I&apos;m not trusting that merit pay is a good idea. Every honor or “leadership” position that I have witnessed our district bestowing upon its teachers is based upon popularity, gossip, and pecking order, not accomplishment. Let me clarify my stance by saying that I will get merit pay. My scores are high and I’m known at my school as one of the stronger teachers. I work at least 50-60 hours a week and I’m good. Because of the handling of similar situations within my district, I cannot believe that merit pay will be handled any more fairly.&quot;
 -- Too Fearful to Give My Real Name, Teacher, Fort Worth ISD, Fort Worth TX &quot;I don&apos;t agree with merit pay, although I do understand the reason behind it. Teachers who are not capable of teaching students should step aside and let better teachers do the teaching.&quot;
 -- LynnCalifornia &quot;No. It creates competition where there should be collaboration and co-operation. It tends to be based on student success on standardised tests that test the ability of a student to take a test. It doesn&apos;t reward teachers who help students learn, unless the student is achieving well enough of the test. It also does not recognise the added burdens of teachers working in tougher schools. I have yet to see a scheme I like.&quot;
 -- Barb Curran, Team Leader, Pleasant Point Primary School, New Zealand &quot;Yes, if you can find a fair way to measure growth. There are a lot of teachers who shouldn&apos;t be teaching and they seem to be the ones who are most threatened by the idea of merit pay. &quot;I believe merit pay is not a good idea because there are so many variables that may be out of your control. For example, what if some of the students who would be considered &quot;advanced&quot; moved out at such a late date, their score would still count against your test scores? Also, how would the merit pay be distributed? Would it just be for classroom teachers? Would it be based on individual or grade level performance? I also believe that it encourages teachers to simply teach to the test. &quot;I do not think hat merit pay is a good idea. As a teacher at a school that has the hightest ESL population in our district I know that how hard the teachers and the students work it is difficult to be one of the highest achieving schools in the district. Many of our students arrive in Kindergarten knowing no English. They make amazing growth but it does not look like the same academic achievment that is seen at other schools. Our school has had teachers come from other &apos;higher achieving&apos; schools and they are amazed at how hard teachers at our school work. Teachers have left for other schools and the teachers have been amazed that they can get through in a month what it take three to get through at our school. It is not because we are slackers or bad teachers, it is because we are often starting from the very beginning for many of our students. The other consideration is that many of our students do not have access to help in their school work as their parents are non-English speaking. It is not that they do not want to help, it is that they can&apos;t. If there is to be a change in education do not give merit pay - give extra resources, a classroom assistant in each room and smaller class sizes in schools that need the extra support. Then we might see a positive difference and more students being successful!&quot;
 -- Brenda Black, Learning Support Teacher, Delta, Delta, BC &quot;It&apos;s a wonderful idea,.... if you love tyranny. The principal will decide who is meritorious and reward her/him with whatever perks are available. All you have to do is be a good obedient servant, kiss her/his ring or foot or whatever, never question, never doubt, never innovate and above all, never be creative and never insist that your students need to reason for themselves. Insist that all lessons be memorized since logical thinking will not be an issue. If you are repetitive, dull, monotonous and foster lethargy, but don&apos;t make waves, you&apos;re an odds-on favorite for merit pay. If the system involves rewards by grade achievement, the tyrant will will assign the strongest students to the previously cited &quot;kissers&quot; and punish those innovative &quot;activists&quot; with the lowest achieving, perhaps most disruptive, discourteous and disinterested attendees ( it&apos;s not fair to the diligent children to call these others &quot;students.&quot;) Are there some principals out there who are fair-minded, intellectually-oriented scholars who love to encourage their teachers and students to stretch, question, wonder, imagine and create? Of course, there are. They are few in number and when we see them, we are filled with admiration. But they are doomed under the system of merit pay. The district superintendents will see to that in short order.&quot;
 -- Steve Greenberg
 Mathematics Instructor, B.M.E., Ed. M., PDQ, OK, Ret&apos;d., East Amherst, New York &quot;It depends. Suppose a teacher gets a bonus when 90% of her/his students pass the CAHSEE in math. Suppose those same students are in a wealthy elementary school where many students are in AP math. Alternatively, a teacher who raises the average math scores of her students from the 40 percentile to the 60 percentile gets no incentive, since 60 isn&apos;t high enough to pass. Fair? If a suitable measure can be created, it MAY be a good idea.&quot;
 -- Lynn Austin, subsitute adult teacher, San Jose, San Jose, CA &quot;How will merit pay be properly distributed to regular education teachers who teach learning support students yearly? How is that compared to other teachers at the same grade level who teach six to seven gifted students per year? These issues need serious attention before I&apos;d support merit pay. &quot;Merit pay is a wonderful idea in theory and an awful idea in practice. In 1978 I worked in a district that used merit pay as their system for teacher recognition and pay increases. While it sounded awesome to be rewarded for a job well done, what it actually created was a closed community of colleagues whose greatest fear was to have someone else get credit for ideas, projects, or lessons that they believed were theirs. Teachers taught behind closed doors and there was virtually NO teacher collaboration. There was a cut throat mentality, jealousy, and hard feelings, and there is no merit in that! My second year in that district, merit pay was eliminated.&quot;
 -- Susan, Laffey Sabo, Scotch Plains Fanwood, Scotch Plains, NJ &quot;No, there are too many varible in student performance that we can not control. I can&apos;t make Jonny come to school with his homework done. I can&apos;t make Susie have a wonderful home life with parents that support her and her education. I am not able to make sure that Bobby is safe from drugs and violence. The only way this would work is I had responsibility for my 30 kids 5 days a week, 24 hours a day and that is NOT going to happen.&quot;
 -- Misty, Teacher, Belton, Mill Creek, Belton, MO &quot;No because teaching should not be competitive. It is extremely refreshing to know I am in a job that we are asked and enjoy sharing what we know and what works with children. If merit pay is allowed then teachers will begin to guard their own best practices.&quot;
 -- kathy smith, first grade teacher, Pittsburgh Public Schools/Westwood k-8, Pittsburgh PA &quot;It is a great idea for those that would receive it. For those that don&apos;t it would be a moral breaker. What would be the criteria for who gets it? It would be great for the boss because everyone would be &quot;smoozing&quot; the boss! &quot;Definitely not: Who will be the &quot;fair&quot; evaluator? It will create dissention among the staff. (Why did she/he get it and I didn&apos;t?) If you have the &quot;top&quot; kids, you are probably able to more easily move them ahead. Sometimes, you just have &quot;those&quot; classes; misbehavior could keep you from attaining your goals. It&apos;s easier to teach some classes than others. Who gets selected for the &quot;merit&quot; pay? The PE teacher? The teacher who has a very small class?&quot;
 -- Bev Sims, English Teacher, Central Kitsap SD Fairview Junior High, Bremerton, WA &quot;No, much like standardized testing the teacher is only one of the factors in success or failure. Annual yearly progress for some means they are now only 3 years behind; for others a half-year of growth would mean two years in advance. If set up without context the result could easily be the &quot;best&quot; going where the students are &quot;the best&quot;, resulting in higher pay and a widening gap among the communities. So I suppose this means that maybe it would be positive if all the factors were considered. The problem is I do not know the specifics nor the parameters of the proposal. I am reacting to the issue from the past. There are so many factors that I doubt a &quot;real&quot; merit pay system can be developed. I only know that regardless of my level of effort as a secondary teacher there are years when my students do extremely well and others where they do not. I also know that some districts we should get merit pay just to work in and it is not because of the students but the politics,history of the district, and the low value placed on education in the community ... I applaud the willingness and recognition of the need for change, We truely are insane if we think we will get something different out of repetiton of the past. I seriously doubt that merit pay is a workable answer. It may lead to something that is. &quot;NO WAY!!!!!!! The bell shaped curve hasn&apos;t changed over the years even though many educators and government officials have tried to make every student equal in our nation&apos;s schools. Before you give away money try this experiment for one year. Take all the teachers from the best school in your area (private or public ) and trade them with the teachers from the school with poorest scores. Check the results of test scores after the year is over and I think you&apos;ll find nothing has changed. Other nations eliminate the poorest students as years go on but in the U.S. we spend billons on students and parents who don&apos;t value education and expect equal results. The great experiment continues.&quot;
 -- John A. Flynn, Teacher and baby sitter, Whiteford schools, Ottawa Lake, MI. 49267 &quot;If all children came to school from stable two parent homes with parents who are heavily invested in their offspring, I would cheer for merit pay. Unfortunately, the schools merit pay is suppose to &quot;help&quot; bring up test scores are not filled with children from such ideal homes and merit pay will only serve to drive good teachers from the very schools that need them the most. When will elected officials have the courage to push for what achieves the highest grades and test scores in schools: PARENT INVESTMENT/INVOLVEMENT in their children?! It is not race, it is not social-economic status, it is the home culture that gives the student the incentive to learn and achieve, especially at the high school level.&quot;
 -- Jean Wilson, teacher, Antelope Valley Union High School District, Lancaster, CA 93535 &quot;No. Some classes have more higher achievers than others so the merit pay would not be fair to every teacher. Merit pay is not fair to the teachers that teach art, music, P.E, and other electives. How would those teachers be compensated? Does merit pay not create competition between teachers? What about the school districts that are low socio-econmoics? Those schools would be at a disadvantage and good teachers would not want to take jobs at those schools. If teachers were offered merit pay, all teachers would be scrambling for jobs at the best schools. Perspective teachers, such as myself, would consider other career options. Teachers would no longer teach because of the passion they have for teaching but for money.&quot;
 -- Nanette Wimpee, College Student, Shorter College, Rome, Georgia &quot;What teacher will ever want to be a special education or a title teacher again? This is a time you need them the most and what are they going to judge my teaching on==BD andLD students&apos; scores?&quot;
 -- Carol Sieber, EBD teacjer, Marillac Day School, Overland Park, KS &quot;I think if merit pay is to work, it must be based on progress shown other than standardized testing. I am special education teacher, each year my students make great strides in their learning but making up 2-3 grade levels is not always possible. It is difficult to demonstrate learning on the CRCT , despite gains made through out the year.&quot;
 -- Debbie Carter, IRR Teacher, Fulton County, Roswell, Ga. &quot;No! I teach at an API 9 school, in the surburbs, with plenty of parent involvement. My kids do great on the TEST. My job is EASY. The extra pay should go to the teachers who work in API 1 and 2 schools who are expected to acheive the impossible with very little.&quot;
 -- Patty, teacher, San Diego City School, San Diego CA &quot;Merit Pay is a great idea as long as it is over and above our base salary and is not reflected in Evaluations. Our Contract includes language for Merit Pay in this manner. Teachers will receive Merit Pay if 60% of our Students show positive progress over the coarse of the year. Our Members are skeptical about more testing - to find student levels when they enter our room in the fall, once mid-year, and then again at the end of the year. We insisted on a &quot;fair&quot; tool to measure true student growth, but we all know that some of us are not test takers, and some of us have bad days. Our District is currently reviewing sources for a fair and accurate test. We will implement the plan in the 2009-2010 school year. Ask me next year if I still feel this is a great idea.&quot;
 -- Loni Smith, Teacher and Union President, Oscoda Area Schools, Oscoda, MI &quot;Absolutely not. Our product changes from year to year, not like a company&apos;s. The results would be devastating. If merit pay is to be instituted the entire antiquated system of education would have to be overhauled. The students in high economic areas would do much better-that goes without saying. In high risk areas will the teachers make less? Soon all schools will be PI schools even though scores go up. Oh, the insanity of it all! &quot;It depends on the merit pay requirements. I don&apos;t think a teacher should be &quot;punished&quot; if their students don&apos;t do well on state assessments. Some people (like me) don&apos;t do well on standardized tests no matter how well they know the subject matter. I am a teacher. In my education classes and now in Professional Development workshops, I am taught (and expected) to differentiate instruction, use various assessments to show progress and adapt to the students&apos; learning style. Yet when it come to &quot;success&quot; (mine and my students&apos;) many times the state assessment is the single evaluation tool. So, if merit pay is based solely on state assessments, no, it is not a good idea. If it is based on a number of factors, including state assessments, I think is would be great.&quot;
 -- Karen Schmulbach, ESL Teacher, Memphis City-Treadwell Elementary, Memphis, TN &quot;How would it be determined? If it is by test grades, the teachers would all want the brightest students who would get the highest grades. I don&apos;t see how they could come up with a fair merit pay system and still be fair to the students. &quot;First of all let me say, I&apos;m not in the US, I&apos;m a teacher in Barbados where the issue is also being looked at. I&apos;m at a school that is plagued with many many problems; high student absenteeism, drugs, prostitution, lack of parental involvement, and the list goes on. I&apos;m therefore not sure how this will work, what criteria will be used. To tie it all to student performance would be a huge mistake to me, because when all is said and done, the student is by far the greatest factor in student performance. It seems to me as though teachers are being held accountable for society&apos;s ills, when these same ills that have been harboured and allowed to fester by governments who refuse to make policy decisions to protect the society are wreaking havoc in schools.&quot;
 -- Anthony Reid, Mr, Barbados, Bridgetown &quot;Tying teacher pay to student test scores is unethical and unprofessional. Top educators and administrators, (well-known and unknown), continue to state over and over again, that test scores are only one measure of student learning. It seems that student test scores are now equated solely with test scores. This is a new low in education. I&apos;m not surprised, though, as the new Secretary of Education, Arnie Duncan, has no background in education, other than he might have tutored someone. Being a CEO is much different than being an educator. I am a member of NEA, OEA, KEA, and former member of the Chicago Teachers&apos; Union. We have brought much of this problem on ourselves. Teachers&apos; unions have done a great job of protecting poor teachers, (who have tenure, etc.), and don&apos;t do enough to patrol our own ranks. In addition, copious amounts of time, energy, and resources have been spent on standardized tests, rather than do the very hard work of developing a more standardized, professional teacher evaluation. Maybe that means developing student and/or teacher portfolios. In my opinion, those who advocate merit pay, (Education Department gurus, administrators, legislators, and boards of education), are not willing to think outside the lines or put resources into coming up with a variety of instruments to evaluate actual student learning, as well as teacher effectiveness. Merit pay is the latest in a long line of &quot;fads&quot;. Unfortunately, these so called fads directly influence our students&apos; lives, as well as the lives of teacher-practitioners.&quot;
 -- Sherman Smith, Currently unemployedCincinnati, OH &quot;No. Who determines the criteria for merit pay? I fear that favoritism would be involved which would create a more devisive staff. It&apos;s best to leave it at stipends for those teachers that choose to teach additional classes or work adjunct duties. I fear it would be attached to test scores, which means only core curriculum teachers need apply. It sounds like a good idea, but it really isn&apos;t. &quot;I really don&apos;t know, because I was always against it. Because it is a point that children have to play their part along with the parents. It should not be the teacher that is responsiabile for for children not learning. &quot;No, teacher merit pay is not a good idea. If merit pay is based on standardized tests then all teachers are not on the same playing field, because there are too many variables involved in our work. Teaching children is not like entering data into a computer, we work with human beings that come to us with differing backgrounds and abilities. Computers don&apos;t have to deal with human needs such as hunger, language aquisition, and learning disorders. I believe all teachers work extremely hard in their classrooms, and scores on a test do not in any way show their dedication to their work.&quot;
 -- Patricia Jeska, teacher, Salinas City Elementary/ El Gabilan, Salinas, CA &quot;NO! It is too difficult to assess a teacher&apos;s effectiveness. We are not making cars. Student achievement depends on much more than what the teacher does: background knowledge, or lack of; family structure and involvement; and all those variables we have no control over to say nothing of our special education students who may never be at grade level. And, what tool do we use? Certainly not high stakes tests taken once a year.&quot;
 -- Gail Jilek, Special Education Teacher, Dolton 148, Dolton, IL &quot;No. There are too many variables involved to be able to objectively and fairly judge a teacher. If you go strictly by student growth, the student&apos;s home life needs to be taken into consideration. If you go be appraiser judgements you have too much room for human error. Two appraisers can see a teacher&apos;s performance in two different lights. Teachers will not be as ready to share ideas and teaching strategies with other teachers and the students will suffer. There has to be a better way to increase teacher pay.&quot;
 -- Kathleen Harrison, 5th grade teacher, Cy-Fair ISD, Cypress, Texas &quot;A lot people have become teachers because of the 2 weeks at Christmas, The long summer vaction ect. They may be excelent teachers, but may not deserve merit pay. The Teachers that really deserve merit pay are the ones who really love to teach the children. Who want to see and help our youngsters fullfill their dreams. They are the Teachers that can and do reach all our children. My child has had both types of Teachers and I can see the difference in her work and attitude for the Teachers that are there because they love the children and their job.&quot;
 -- krystal, office staff @ a childcare center in willis t x , willis isd, willis tx. &quot;It is my understanding that the merit pay would be tied to a teacher&apos;s student&apos;s testing results on the state standardized test. I work in a very low income area, and as much as I give up for my students, i.e. lunch and after school time, in order to give them extra help to be successful. I still have those students who have, for one reason or another, decided that they are just not going to try. They will literally sit at their desk with the test in front of them and not lift the pencil to fill in the answer sheet. Where is the merit/justification of paying by merit when the students refuse to participate? I say no to this idea.&quot;
 -- Jerry Dawson, Classroom teacher, Cartwright/C.W. Harris, Phoenix, AZ &quot;No. Reducing class size, increasing prep time and raising salaries for all educators makes sense, given that half of all new teachers leave teaching within five years. Merit pay could undermine teacher unity and sets up a situation where favoritism rules and some incompetent administrators can reward and punish teachers unfairly.&quot;
 -- Dave Staiger, Social Studies Teacher, Kalamazoo Public Schools, Kalamazoo, MI &quot;In theory, merit pay sounds great. But how would one quantify the worthiness of such a reward? If merit pay is based on student achievement as measured by high-stakes testing, then teachers seeking higher pay would vie for jobs at schools serving students from upper socio-economic families. Paradoxically, we need the most innovative, passionate and experienced teachers working with students at the greatest risk. I&apos;m not sure how one would measure the merit of such a professional. As a seasoned teacher, I know such colleagues when I see them. They are magicians, explorers and pied pipers; they call forth excellence from their students, and these very students blossom, regardless of background. These co-workers inspire and make me do a better job. Show me how to quantify this amazing art of teaching, and I would embrace the concept of merit pay.&quot;
 -- Elaine Carroll Johnston, Seventh Grade English&amp;Literature Teach er , Fairbanks North Star Borough School District/ Tanana Middle School, Fairbanks, Alaska &quot;OK - picture this. You work on an assembly line with the newest, best, fastest, quality equipment. You output more higher quality widgets than any other factory that produces the same kind of widgets. Your widgets just shine when they come off that assembly line! The merit pay you receive climbs far above what any other worker could possibly make under the old system. Now, the people who work in the factory next door have rusty, old, equipment that hasn&apos;t been oiled in years. Their assembly line is broken down much of the time. They produce fewer widgets and most are of poor quality. No merit pay for them! So, if teachers are given the children who are well cared for, whose emotional and physical needs met at home, who have parents who are supportive of, and believe, in our educational system, and encourage their children to be responsible for their own actions without coddling them, then merit pay is a wonderful idea! Go for it! Give me those kids and I&apos;ll take merit pay any day!&quot;
 -- Joanne Finnegan, Technology Integration Specialist (left the &quot;classroom&quot; after 27 years to teach teachers) , Chittenden East Supervisory Union, Richmond, Vermont &quot;absolutely not! Too many administrators don&apos;t have the education to appropriatly evaluate teachers as it is - and too many administrators would have trouble being impartial when setting up classes that are not &quot;loaded&quot; The PAR program with teachers evaluating teachers is one of the best I have seen. &quot;You&apos;ve got to be careful with this idea. Of course the best in ANY profession should be rewarded. The sticking point is, How do you determine who is the BEST? Those ridiculous district-mandated &quot;assessments&quot; that, frustratingly, do NOT assess what the district&apos;s curriculum actually has us teaching? The Quarterly Math assessments, also written by the district, designed to shove 10 months&apos; worth of math into 8 months so the students will have been exposed to all of it before the Standardized tests? In my Title I, Program Improvement school I still refuse to &quot;teach to the test.&quot; I teach to the standards. For this heresy my students routinely score lowest in our grade level. However, MY students are the only ones in the entire school who put on a musical last year (about California&apos;s history); who still make presents for their parents for Christmas, Valentine&apos;s Day, Mother&apos;s Day and Father&apos;s Day; who still cook in the classroom; who practice their recorders even when the music teacher doesn&apos;t show up... Get the point? I am penalized for providing my students with a broad curriculum of the same sorts of lessons I LOVED growing up. So there will be no merit pay in my future, assuredly, but my students will get an EDUCATION.&quot;
 -- Connie Ordway, 4th grade teacher, Los Angeles Unified School District, Gardena, CA &quot;Not a good idea. Merit can not be measured fairly. &quot;No because the resouses and student count for teachers varies too much. If all else were equal, maybe. But remember, we are not turning out widgets. Human beings are varied and complex. The students come from an extremely wide range of backgrounds. One standard measure would be unfair to all.&quot;
 -- Pat Coiner, Teacher, School District of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA &quot;Depends. If it&apos;s linked to JUST test scores, (which is all I&apos;ve heard mentioned so far) then it becomes a sick joke especially on teachers having to deal with transient populations or in areas where the parents are often under-educated. It also makes it that much harder to keep talent in those areas. Also, how would teachers of non-testable subjects like technology, JROTC, art, home economics, music, shop, social science, and various electives be evaluated? Their contributions often help keep special needs students (either gifted or learning disabled) involved in the education process. If the system can be made equable for districts with greater challenges and teachers of subjects without standardized test evaluations then merit pay may be an idea whose time has come.&quot;
 -- M. Downing, Librarian, Seeking Employment, Seattle, WA &quot;I don&apos;t like it. In my experience it doesn&apos;t work in government because its too subjective. If it could be done objectively, it might have some merit (ha, ha). Standardized testing is not a good or fair measure of teaching. Its a measure of recall and learning. If you have an apathetic student/parent population the best teachers in the world would have difficulty getting students to perform. Merit pay should be administered by observation by an impartial outside observer. I would recommend every teacher be observed twice in one semester every six semesters.&quot;
 -- Richard A. Cataldi, High School Math Teacher, Lenoir City Schools, Lenoir City, TN &quot;Not as a stand alone system. There are more factors at play than just the teacher. A good teacher can help all students learn, but even the best teacher in the world cannot completely erase the gaps with which some students enter school. Don&apos;t lower expectations, but at the same time, don&apos;t punish teachers who give heart and soul to teach our most disadvantaged children. &quot;It is my duty to do the best I can in this hard but great profession. It is a good idea but it should not be my motivation.&quot;
 -- Michelle H. Sanchez, ESL Teacher, CSU, Columbus,GA &quot;I don&apos;t believe so. As a Title 1 reading specialist, I deal all day long with kids who are not functioning at grade level. When they make gains, they are usually very slow to do so. Their test scores are almost always the lowest in their class. Sooooooo, how does &quot;Johnny&apos;s&quot; raise in test scores just a percentage or 2 {which may be a HUGE accomplishment for him} compare to someone else who does not struggle and may make much larger gains. Am I a worse teacher because &quot;Johnny&apos; didnt&apos; do as well as&quot;Suzy&quot;? And.....what about those kids with text anxiety? Is it a teacher&apos;s fault if a student has difficulty taking tests? Do we deserve less pay because our student&apos;s may not perform on a certain test on a certain day?&quot;
 -- Patti, Title 1 Reading Specialist, Campbellport, Campbellsport, WI &quot;Yes. Many teachers around the globe are providing tons of ideas for fellow teachers. Not all of them, though (myself included sometimes) share lesson plans or new ideas but we do take advantage of others&apos; ideas. If we have to pay some money (we have to think about how possible is this for everybody), even a few cents, every time we use someone else&apos;s ideas, we can help each other, and why not? give recognizition to those creative teachers. Even with only a dime per idea or lesson plan, we can acknowledge those efforts...&quot;
 -- Queralt Comellas, Second Language Teaching, MA, American School Foundation of Puebla, Mexico &quot;No. It is already difficult to keep teachers in low income area schools. These teachers would have a harder time getting the merit pay. Not because they are not good teachers and definitely not because the students are not just as capable and smart, but the students often lack experiences. Life experiences have an effect on standardized test scores. Even the best tests are in some way biased.&quot;
 -- Tammy Diggs, teacher, Pampa ISD, Pampa, TX &quot;I think the offer of merit pay, to a good teacher, is a slap in the face. It infers that if a &quot;carrot&quot; ($$) is dangled in front of a teacher, they will work harder. You could triple my pay and I could not work more than the 14 hour days that I put in during the week. My colleagues and I are working as hard as we can to help our students. We don&apos;t need to be insulted by those who are insinuating that we are not doing our best. Unfortunately there will be those unethical people who will cheat to help their students get higher test scores, so they can get more $$. How sad for those of us who love our professionl&quot;
 -- Maureen Dykstra, teacher, Potterville Public Schools, Potterville, MI &quot;depending on how it is set up I think teacher merit pay is a good idea. I think it should be a combination of observations, parent survey, and interviews. I also think that seniority should play a part too! &quot;Merit pay is not a good idea because it creates competition among teachers. Teaching is a profession of sharing best practices and modeling mentor teachers. If pay is based on merit, teachers may become protective of their great ideas and successful lessons. Also, sometimes the best teachers are charged with the students who have the greatest needs. There is no way to accurately &quot;measure&quot; a teacher&apos;s ability or success based on the outcomes of their students. If the composition of the class is &quot;scholarly&quot; then the teacher will appear successful. If the opposite is true, then the teacher will appear unsuccessful. It would be like rating an oncologist whose patients first presented with Stage I cancer against one whose patients first presented with Stage IV.&quot;
 -- Andrea LaMantia, teacher, East Ramapo Central School District - Hillcrest School, New City, NY &quot;No, merit pay is not a good idea due to the inequity of the system. Teachers ranked by administrators with little to no experience in the classroom they&apos;re judging have little to no objectivity. Teachers ranked by the testing scores of their students have no control over the social, economic, emotional, nutritional, genetics, family life, etc. of the students they teach. Therefore, much of the test scores are not a reflective of the quality of teaching but of other factors over which educators have no control. Law makers tend to forget teachers deal with human beings, with all the variables of the human condition, and want to hold teachers responsible for things over which they cannot take control. Instead of a one time &apos;snap-shot&apos; test determining learning, a measurement tool indicating learning/progress over time would be more useful and provide much more of a true picture for that student&apos;s learning. At least, over a period of time, a teacher might stand a chance against the variables that compose a student to make a difference.&quot;
 -- Jalanna Lenaburg, Special Education Teacher, Moore Public Schools, Moore, Oklahoma &quot;Having taught both public and homeschool, I advocate merit pay for teachers! Incentives such as these serve as earned appreciation for good and discouragement for educators seeking only monetary rewards.&quot;
 -- Jacqueline, Homeschool TutorAtlanta, GA &quot;Teacher merit pay is a good idea IF there is an objective way to evaluate it. Too many times it is very subjective. As a &quot;special&quot; (music) teacher I worked with many teachers and in their own way they all deserved merit pay. I believe if a teacher attends workshops, uses some inovative ideas from a workshop and tries to improve their classroom, works with students of all degrees of intelligence, and is enthusiastic about teaching deserves merit pay. Opposing is the teacher that says open the book to page?, read, answer the questions at the end of the chapter day after day should not receive merit pay. Most teachers do not teach to be singled out as great but do like to be appreciated for trying new ideas and going that extra mile.&quot;
 -- Johanna Beebe, Retired music teacher, Willard City Schools, Willard, Ohio &quot;No 1. There will be that many more positions needed to be filled in order to keep track of and manage the new &quot;Merit Pay Section&quot; of the school systems central office. Hence, using more money out of the classroom instead of inside the classroom. 2. There are too many variables. Such as the location of the school, demographics of the community, in-house politics, favortism, corruption within the school system, measurement criteria, etc. The teacher community would be the last ones to receive benefit from a merit pay policy. Take this example. One year an effective high quality teacher gets a classroom of mostly below grade level performers and works diligently to create sucessful students. But, for more reasons than I can and care to mention, the productivity of the students does not meet the criteria needed for the teacher to earn merit pay. But the teacher down the hall who has been teaching for twenty-something years has some of the highest achievers and meets all the merit pay criteria. 3. It has taken many many years to create a comaraderie amongst the teaching community; and using monetary rewards based on student&apos;s performance will erode the teaching team and create anomosity and blame between grade levels and the student&apos;s development levels.&quot;
 -- Wanda Prestipino, Tutor, Onslow County, Jacksonville, NC &quot;Of course it is. Not only will it finally provide a real career path for America&apos;s teachers, it will attract a different type of applicant to the profession. The current system, with its lack of accountability and incentives, tends to appeal to mediocre people seeking safety and job security. The real movers and shakers, creative thinkers eager to explore and innovate, enter other fields where their inventiveness will be appreciated and compensated. Those are the teachers our kids need and deserve.&quot;
 -- Mary Dodaro, Grade 8 teacher, Monessen Middle School, Monessen, PA &quot;No. Everyone knows principals have their favorites and are not always aware of the quality of the instruction a teacher provides. In the past 3 years, I have only been observed 3 times and only received feedback twice....Will administrators have merit pay as well?? &quot;The idea of being compensated based on how well you perform your job is not a revolutionary idea. I believe there is value to this idea. However, the problem I have is not in the theory, but in the practical application that will likely take place. Some important questions that have to be posed - and answered - before I&apos;m on board: -Will we still retain our same base salaries, and receive merit pay as a bonus? Or will our entire means of staying above the poverty line be dependent on our &quot;merits?&quot; The latter may work for waiters and bartenders (&quot;official wage is extremely low, with the expectation that you&apos;ll make up the difference in tips&quot;) but is not fair for workers who have families to feed. -What will be the factors used to judge our &quot;merit&quot;? My estimation based on the current popular thought is that my students&apos; test scores will be the ultimate deciding factor. I would hope this is not the case. We need a more comprehensive assessment for teacher effectiveness, as there are so many ways to judge a teacher. Test scores do not tell the entire picture! Does the teacher manage their classroom effectively? How is their relationship with the students? Is there a climate or respect for each other, and appreciation for learning? Did the teacher help the students build character as well as content knowledge? How would the students fair on performance tasks (not just state-sponsored multiple choice questions) in that area? Does the teacher get involved in the community or school in other ways (clubs, coaching, etc)? There are countless factors that most non-educators don&apos;t consider. Which begs the question... -Who will be evaluating teachers? And who will be setting the criteria for evaluation? I think we can all agree that much of the failure our schools have seen is a result of non-educators (i.e. politicians) making decisions the ramifications of which they do not fully understand, or the financial cost of which they do not support. -Will there be a level playing field? A teacher from a poverty-stricken urban school with no supplies, support, textbooks, or even a safe and modern building should not be judged the same way as a teacher in a newly built suburban ultra-modern school that is fully staffed, has ample parent support, and employs the latest technology and supplies. If these tough questions can be addressed and solved, not just by politicians and policy makers but rather with the active input of experienced educators who understand these nuances, then I can see the merit in performance-based pay. However if we just jump to a new pay structure without the proper insight into the social, political and financial problems that have been holding our students back for decades, then we will have nothing more than a poorly veiled strategy for further underpaying and scape-goating the dedicated professionals who are most directly invested in the lives of their students.&quot;
 -- Eric Santos, Teacher, Litchfield Elementary School District, Litchfield Park, AZ &quot;Yes, because the alternative certification has put many people in the classroom, who 1. really don&apos;t want to be teachers, but need a job and 2. Aren&apos;t trained apprpropriately one year training programs with no student teaching is unacceptable. I don&apos;t think that nationally certified certificate is needed. What is needed is college prepared teachers who have taken education courses.&quot;
 -- Dr. Velma Perez, Bilingual special education, Austin Independent school district, Austin, texas &quot;NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;
 -- Britt Moffatt, 3rd grade teacher, Compton Unified SD, Bellflower, CA &quot;I am a 57 year old first year teacher. I spent my entire adult life in one form of private enterprise or another. I was paid to do two things; produce and make decisions. If I produced well and made wise decisions I was retained or hired for new projects. If not, well, fill in the blank. I cannot for the life of me see that as a teacher I have some kind of special hide that has to be protected. If I am given charge of your children, don&apos;t I have a duty to account to you, both as a taxpayer and as a parent, for my doings? That is the very definition of merit accountability. I will happily live and die by that standard.&quot;
 -- Anthony C. Polvino, Teacher, Baltimore City Public Schools, Baltimore, Md. &quot;It is my profound opinion that merit pay for teachers is not a good idea for the following reasons: 1) Many teachers would never, ever have the opportunity to even be in jobs to earn merit pay, where tests are given to determine effectiveness. Teachers who teach classes such as PE, computer skills and art would not be in the running. 2) Because most teachers are placed in their positions by administration, it would create a new version of an age old problem, the &apos;good old boy&apos; system of taking care of friends and family when there is money involved by using coveted positions and by making sure the brightest students are always assigned to the chosen few, 3) It would create an extremely competitive climate among colleagues that would divide a faculty instead of creating a team and, for that reason alone, would not be in the best interest of the educational process, and 4) It would encourage &apos;teaching to the test&apos; as well as cheating on the test!&quot;
 -- Sharon Marlow, Teacher, Union leader, Campbell County, Jellico, TN &quot;Any teacher who can reach his/her students is worth merit pay. The problem is- &quot;By what standard do we measure merit?&quot; Is it standardized test scores, is it diagnostic test scores, or is it simply how well students do with the standard curriculum? Rather than offer merit pay for some esoteric standard, make teacher pay better overall, and make the requirements to STAY teaching more stringent, so as to weed out the hangers-on.&quot;
 -- Robin DeLuca, High School English teacher, East Ridge High School, Clermont, Fl &quot;I do not think so. You will have teachers just teaching to the test and not expanding the childs outlook. Also, if you are given the &quot;hard&quot; class, you are at a disadvantage to start with. &quot;Absolutely not!!! I teach SPED Deaf children and all the faculty here works together as a team to help the kids. In a merit pay situation, we would not share our ideas. It would eventually harm the students and lower the quality of education if we didn&apos;t work together. Would teachers flee from SPED programs in a merit pay situation thinking they could teach general ed and make huge measurable progress each year? Sadly our SPED kids don&apos;t always make the yearly progress that is expected of them and if that meant less pay, there might be a huge problem on our hands...&quot;
 -- Rachel, Teacher of the Deaf &quot;No it is not. There is no way in which a teacher can be judged on HOW WELL they teach. As teachers and educators know, every child is different and thus every classroom is different. It would be impossible to decide without a full account of each and every child how a teacher is doing. Then we would compare each of the children she is teaching against every other teachers students and on and on!&quot;
 -- diane demir, paraprofessional/student, celantano museum academy, new haven, CT &quot;No. It is too difficult to fairly judge a teacher on their performance based solely on their students&apos; performance. You would not hold a psychiatrist or psychololgist responsible for the success or failure of their patients because there are too many outside factors beyond the psychiatrist/psychologist&apos;s control. In teaching, so many factors affect success or failure of a student, many of which, unfortunately, are not in control of the teacher. I do not feel that merit pay would be a positive way to motivate teachers to do their best.&quot;
 -- Susan MesichGreensburg, PA &quot;Yes. There are many teachers who have great ideas as to how to excite students and they should be given an opportunity to help students reach their best efforts. No &quot;professional college&quot; or union of profesionals should hold these teachers back in performing their best teaching processes and abilitiesm to success. Are we personal motivators or are we a computor screen teling students what to do and how to do it.&quot;
 -- held back for personal reasons, retired teacherBC, Canada &quot;Yes, a teacher should be rewarded for extraordinary work. However teachers need more than two years to prove themselves. Tenure is too hard to obtain.&quot;
 -- Jennifer Diedrick, tutor, karing for kids, hanford, ca &quot;No way! It will turn our job into a competition instead of a collaboration, as we have our school set up now!&quot;
 -- Linda Birse, 5th grade teacher, Davis Joint Unified, Patwin Elementary, Davis, CA &quot;Merit pay for teachers is not a good idea. There are in fact too many variables that are not quantifiable. It will take a very skillful educator to design a checklist that would accurately measure the value each teacher is contributing to the welfare of her students and to the school. I think setting higher minimum standards for teachers is important. I also think raising teacher salaries will improve the quality of professionals who are attracted to the field. I do think it would be worthwhile to try to attract experienced teachers to work at low performing schools by paying them a substantial salary increase. Some schools serve large populations of children who come from homes where there is no culture that supports education. It is tough for these children to make the same learning gains as children who come from homes which support the school at every turn.&quot;
 -- Donna Valbuena, ELL teacher, Palm Beach County School District, West Palm Beach, FL 33405 &quot;This is too open-ended a question. If a teacher is doing an outstanding job with very low-functioning students but the school isn&apos;t making AYP and the principal isn&apos;t getting the bonus attached to AYP because of those low-functioning students, then that teacher may very well be denied merit pay. Do I need to go into the suck-ups who weedle their way into administrators&apos; good graces and get underserved compensation/benefits? I honestly feel that the wording of this question is very bad and intended to lead to knee-jerk responses.&quot;
 -- Emily Long, Associat Professor, UNC-P, Pembroke, NC &quot;How do you measure merit???Does it depend on students&apos;results. I work very hard but my students do not have the right environment to gain proper literacy skills. Do I still deserve merit?&quot;
 -- Colette Politzer, Library Media Specialist, ERCSD, Spring Valley, NY &quot;No, All hard working Special Educators will not be paid what they are worth. Those teachers who work with GT students will be paid more than other teachers.&quot; &quot;No, I think merit should be work of a total school and not just given to one teacher. Map testing and achievement test should be look at as a school and hope all the teachers in the building are doing an equal share to educate their students. Each student has a different capacity at learning and not all students learn in the same timetable. What might look to some as a great teacher, in real life, it maybe a student has finally found their niche in the classroom and with society. I also believe with the type of students, home life and other conditions which arise in a classroom the teacher may be doing the best they can. You cannot fault a teacher when their are extenuating circumstances. Who decides and on what basis does a teacher merit more pay. Are older teachers left out because they like to teach the old way and not use so much technology? Are new teachers left out because they are still learning?&quot;
 -- Lynn WillinghamVilla Ridge MO &quot;Merit pay is a great idea. However in my experience it would depend on which education system you are employed in. For instance in Victorian Government schools in Australia teachers are expected to present a professional recognition plan based on the standards for their particular level of teaching experience. This plan is reviewed by a member of the principal class annually. Some great work is presented in these reviews and for those staff who are still receiving increments based on their years of teaching it means they move on to the next pay level. My biggest concern is how do we judge merit. Within every field of employment we have the doers and those who take ownership of others ideas and present them as their own. In my experience many teachers have great innovative ideas and use them in their classrooms to enable student success and enjoyment of the topic studied. A large majority of these go unnoticed as they go about their job quietly. Then there are the salespeople who come up with new ideas on a regular basis. Certainly they may have put in a lot of professional development and have planned a brilliant program. The publicity goes well, the management are convinced and the implement the new idea. Many of these have not been trialled and tested. Students are not asked to share their feelings on what works, what is boring and any ideas thy have to improve on a program. Other staff feel intimidated if they make criticisms of the program as often these salespeople are constantly in the ear of the management and criticism is seen as petty jealousy. You may think I am being overly cynical but I am sure other teachers experience similar experiences. Merit based pay? A great idea. My question is:how do we measure merit and who makes these judgements? Will it be based on student results, student satisfaction surveys, performance reviews or on those clever salespeople who can talk the talk but are not as successful in walking the talk. Ask the people who have lost large parts of their saving about those clever salespeople, the managers and CEO&apos;s who not only received large salaries but also received so called large merit based bonuses. Cynic I must be but just how do we judge merit?&quot;
 -- Carla Baxter, Mrs, Irymple Secondary College, Victoria, Australia &quot;If we do our job, we deserve to be paid. If we do our job well, we deserve to be recognized. If we do our job extremely effectively, we ought to be followed / duplicated / set as an example. For many in the teaching profession, we only learn, so very long after the fact, the good, the result, the signioficance of what we have done. Those returning / thankful / appreciative students who report the ultimate results make it truly worth it!!&quot;
 -- Carey Conway, Practicum Planner, NLIP, Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, Ontario &quot;No. There is no equitable way to determine this. We have excellent art and music teachers, but there is no testing in those subjects so what criteria would be used? We have most of our inclusion children in one classroom so that they can receive the best services. This teacher&apos;s scores will reflect that. Other schools may not have the large numbers of transient students that we have. How do you account for the scores of students that have only been in your school for a number of weeks prior to testing? EEL students? There are too many factors that haven&apos;t been considered.&quot;
 -- Linda Turner, Lead Teacher, Vicksburg Warren Schools, Vicksburg, MS &quot;Before there is merit pay, there has to be a fair and equitable evaluation system. So far, what I have seen has been based on test scores. Well, my class has children with learning disabilities, children with limited English reading and writing skills, children with behavior problems that keep them from learning, and, now, children from families who are struggling just to keep their families housed, clothed and fed, and gifted students. Would you like to guess which ones do best on the test? I can&apos;t. Until we can use multiple assessments, until the administrators have normed and fair evaluation rubrics, and until this is a pay system that is sustainable, i. e., each year and not just until the money runs out or the economy tanks, I don&apos;t think many teachers are going to bite, unless they are in the first couple years of teaching.&quot;
 -- Jill Bohn, teacher, Berryessa Union School District, Brooktree, San Jose, CA &quot;I think that merit pay is a great idea, but it would need to be carefully considered. Who would determine the qualifiers for merit pay? How would it be disbursed? Is seniority going to be a factor in determining merit pay? How will the &quot;fairness&quot; issue ce addressed? Overall, I think that teacher pay is too low anyway, when considering other professional career options. In addition, advancement/promotions are more difficult to achieve, the quality and quantity of work is different, and teaching requires one to be a &quot;jack of all trades&quot;--more so than in other careers. As teachers, we know that our students are better able to rise to a challenge when they receive an incentive. Merit pay, ideally, would work in the same way. And it would be a step in the right direction to reward hard working teachers for a job well done--a job they choose to do at low pay anyway.&quot;
 -- Joy Cole, Kindergarten teacher, Henrico County Schools, Henrico, VA &quot;No, teachers have no control over the students and their background before the students enter a classroom. Students that have grown up with a respect for education, expectations for achievement, and involved parents are more likely to learn. Students that grow up wondering where they will sleep tonight, are they safe from harm, and when they are going to eat are more concerned with surviving than learning. Teachers can be highly trained, spend hours creating wonderfully engaging lessons, and love every child that walks in the door, but the teachers can&apos;t change the baggage that prevents students from learning. None of the background factors excuses teachers from being highly trained in teaching methods and their content area, spending the time to create engaging lessons, or loving every child that they teach. If a teacher is doing all that and students still don&apos;t learn, when will the responsibility for the work and learning become the student&apos;s responsibility? When a teacher has done all the right things, sought all the right help, and given everything needed to the students, is it still just the teacher&apos;s fault for not having high test scores? Test scores only measure for a day. Teachers can&apos;t choose their students based on test scores.&quot;
 -- Cheryl Starwalt, Seventh Grade ELA Teacher, Anderson 5/Lakeside Middle, Anderson, SC &quot;No, No, and No!!! I am an 8th grade special education teacher in an inner city school and I work my tail off teaching my students &quot;how to test&quot;. If I was permitted to spend half as much time teaching these kids how to read, special education students in some of our schools wouldn&apos;t be in the situations that they are in. If I cannot teach them how to read and only how to take a test, how will they ever improve? Why should I be held accountable for something I have absolutely no control over. If I was ever allowed to do the job I signed up for (which is actually teach) then by all means evaluate me on my performance. But until then, please don&apos;t judge me on the grade level curriculum and test taking skills you force me to teach to my students who can only read at a 1st or 2nd grade reading level.&quot;
 -- Michelle Diamond, Special Education Teacher, Philadelphia School District, Philadelphia, PA &quot;&quot;Merit Pay&quot; is commonly referred to in the context of test scores. Teachers should never be paid based on their students performance, that is like paying principals based on their teacher&apos;s performance. The best alternative I&apos;ve heard of is called performance, or skill pay. The concept is that you pay teachers for demonstrating skills related to their job. For example, technology, diversity, and standards. With this method, you have an easily measurable benchmark for the teachers to meet, and you encourage them to build the skills that will help student achievement.&quot;
 -- Grant Zukowski, Teacher, Banks, Banks, Oregon &quot;Absolutley not. It is similar to having police officers have a quota. If you base the merit on test results, grades, attendance, etc. teachers will be under even more pressure than they already are and the classes that attract lower acheiving students would suffer and possibly cause the teachers to lower expectations resulting in a poor education. This was evident and continues to be with state funds and recognition being tied to test scores. Schools were coding students as LD, MR, and LEP to avoid having to allow them to take the tests in previous years before that became hard to do. Some schools asked students to stay home on test days in the years they were not required to make up the test, and others reportedly helped students on the test by changing answers. I cannot think of a worse idea. It is a breeding ground for corruption with teacher pay being low to begin with and with the state of the economy it very well may make an honest teacher turn into a criminal not out of flawed character but out of financial necessity.&quot;
 -- Shawna Newton, Criminal Justice Teacher, Stephenville High School, Stephenville, Texas &quot;Not really. There is just no valid way to evaluate and assess what makes one teacher more or less successful than the next one. How a program like merit pay could be kept with it&apos;s integrity remains to be seen. We all know that some teachers are better suited for the job than others; we wish that we could proudly claim we&apos;re all worth our pay and then some -- but the fact remains, we span a wide range. In listening to the news regarding the &quot;bonuses&quot; paid out to executives who let our economic situation become so disasterous, I wouldn&apos;t want to trade them places!&quot;
 -- Kerren Coburn, kindergarten teacher, Cache County Schools, Providence, Providence, Utah &quot;There are arguments both ways - If a teacher is not delivering, and not being effective as a teacher, then I think they should be taken to task. However, no one can predict what students will come their way, and not all will be successful (whether due to lack of effort or unfortunate circumstances), no matter how talented a teacher is or how much effort they put in with each and every one of their students - they should not be penalized for poor performance that is out of their control.&quot;
 -- Shelley Burnside, Math Teacher&amp;Honor Council Sponsor, Hanover Public County Schools/Atlee High School, Mechanicsville, VA &quot;yes, it keeps one on their toes. It also helps us rediscover why we started teaching in the first plae...the kids!&quot;
 -- karen knapp, ELL paraeducator, everett school district, everett, wa &quot;No. It seems that merit pay is tied to the test! How does this prove excellent merit? How is it fair to others, especially those in special areas? For example, at high school level you have your Math, English, Social Studies, and Science, but you also have your Physical Education teacher, Music teacher, the Resource Room teacher, Special Education self contained teachers. How is this merit pay going to be fair to those teachers? There is not a “Test” they can teach too. Special education teachers of very low function students where growth is minimal, how are they to be evaluated for merit? What criteria will be used to establish their merit? Will the PE teacher get a merit raise if s/he is a coach of a sports team so it is based on the number of games they win. What if s/he has a very young team, and this team is just learning their skills. Does that make the PE teacher a bad teacher? Merit pay sounds good. Lets make teachers work harder to earn their extra pay, but I feel that the merit pay will only benefit the core teachers and this is very unfair to the other excellent teachers in other areas. Under these circumstances these teachers could become bitter by not being considered only because their students don’t take the “test.”&quot;
 -- V. S. Williams, Teacher, NNCS, Norwood, NY &quot;MERIT PAY FOR TEACHERS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA. PEOPLE SAY WELL IT&apos;S DONE IN BUSINESS. YES IT IS, BUT IN BUSINESS A WORKER IS JUDGED BY HIS OR HER OWN WORK. A TEACHER EARNING MERIT PAY IS JUDGED BY HIS/HER STUDENTS WORK. IF YOU HAVE AN ACADEMICALLY STRONG CLASS, YOUR STUDENTS WILL SUCCEED AND YOU WILL GET THE MERIT PAY. IF YOUR CHILDREN ARE NOT AS ACADEMICALLY STRONG, YOU WILL NOT. YOU ARE NOT IN CONTROL OF THIS. YOU CAN BE THE BEST TEACHER IN THE WORLD, BUT IF THE CHILDREN MESS UP ON THE STANDARDIZED TESTS, YOU LOSE. NOT FAIR. THEY SAY THAT YOU&apos;RE JUDGED BY YOUR PEERS. NO TWO SCHOOLS ARE THE SAME, NO TWO NEIGHBORHOODS ARE REALLY THE SAME EITHER. NO TWO STUDENTS ARE THE SAME, YET WE HAVE TO TEACH WITH COOKIE CUTTER CURRICULUM. NOT FAIR.&quot;
 -- JESSICA JACOBS, SPECIAL ED TEACHER, 31 PS 52, STATEN ISLAND, NEW YORK &quot;NO! First of all for K-1 teachers, its not fair. They would not receive any merit pay because their students do not take the state tests. Also, our classes are not cookie cutter classes. Each child is different with different learning styles/abilities/strengths. A teacher who has a class full challenging students may not be able to have his/her class make great improvements.&quot;
 -- Janelle, TeacherCalifornia &quot;Yes, teacher merit pay is a good idea in theory. I&apos;m afraid that not only will it become a political tool determining who is hired, fired, etc., but also, it will cause strife among an existing school faculty. With clear, well-defined criteria for the merit pay, with broad federal requirements, stricter state requirements, and narrower local requirements, it could be a way to help newer teachers become better and stronger. In my 32 years of teaching, I have found that many teachers want some kind of recognition that what they are doing is good. Any type of reward usually is enough to keep them going. I would hate to see merit pay used as a punishment for poor teaching or used as a gift for favored teachers.&quot;
 -- Deborah Honnoll, Spanish Teacher, South Panola School District, Batesville, MS &quot;Good people should be paid well. It is a fallacy to think that all teachers perform at the same degree and with the same results. I have known teacher who said that as long as the students made good grades the students would be happy, the parents would be happy, the administration would be happy and they would be happy. Giving grades and not requiring the students to do anything is the easy way but then the students go to college they have no background. Many say that the teachers do not have to teach because of tenure. Tenure does not protect bad teachers. Bad administrators protect bad teachers. Every teacher should be evaluated many times per year. This does not have to be a full class observation, but could be a 5 minute observarion which would not be announced and lesson plans could be checked at the same time. Pay the teachers that do their jobs and fire the ones that don&apos;t.&quot;
 -- Bill Williams, Science Teacher, Sevier County, Sevierville, Tennessee &quot;Do other professionals receive merit pay? How would this be handled for Special Ed teachers whose students are special needs students? What about teachers who teach in underprivileged schools? Their students have not had the background opportunities as more affluent students, and therefore, are at a disadvantage? The teachers of those students do remarkable jobs teaching those students, many times without help from parents. How would they fit into the merit pay? &quot;It depends upon what the criteria are for receiving the merit pay. Also, would it be only limited to core teachers? How would teachers of the arts be &quot;judged&quot; in order to receive merit pay, considering their students do not take standardized tests? Lastly, would there be different criteria for districts/schools that are title 1 or those that are well-off? Overall, I am not a fan of merit pay. I think that many teachers who deserved it would go unrewarded because perhaps their test scores are not what the district/state thinks they ought to be. I don&apos;t think that merit pay would raise the standards on being a highly qualified teacher. I think the money that is allocated for merit pay bonuses could better be used elsewhere.&quot;
 -- Jean Barnett, Art Teacher, Taylor High School/ Taylor ISD, Taylor, TX &quot;Merit pay has its pluses and minuses. I have worked in the same district for 30 years. I have seen good teachers and bad teachers. The way teachers are evaluated now...doesn&apos;t work, because the bad teachers put on a show when the principal will be in for the evaluation....the bad teachers continue to teach...and they give the good teachers a bad name. With merit pay...if teachers were given a checklist of what they are expected to do at the beginning of the year...and they keep a portfolio to show that they are meeting those expectations...then it would be good. If people are just going to come in an evaluate you once or twice..and then decide...then it is bad. Critieria for evaluation is the key. &quot;Depends on what it is that you are meriting. If it is for the teacher that goes beyond the call of duty (stays late on a regular basis, works extra tutoring time with the students, gives encouragement to the students for good, hard work, etc.) even though the students are not always successful due to their fault, then yes. If it is soley based on whether or not a large percent of their students pass the state exam then no because we know that there are some students that refuse to work and will not pass due to their own laziness. Teacher merit should be based on the teacher&apos;s work not the student&apos;s work. Has that teacher really tried to make her students successful? Does she do everything possible to help them succeed? Does she care about each student in all areas of life? These are the types of questions that should be considered for merit pay.&quot;
 -- S Perez, teacher, KilleenISD, Killeen, Texas &quot;In theory, yes. Rewarding teachers who are innovative and practice sound pedagogy should be rewarded. However, finding an effective way to quantify teacher performance that is fair and equitable seems to be nearly impossible. There are so many variables that influence the learning that comes out of our classrooms that it is literally impossible to ascertain if the outcome is the result of what the teacher is doing or if it is due to one or more of the possible other variables the impact a student&apos;s learning. And, of course, those who would administrate such compensation would look for the easiest method possible to measure a teacher&apos;s merit leaving us with a very devisive and counter-productive system.&quot;
 -- Carol Overson, Teacher, Granite / Brockbank Junior High, Magna, UT &quot;No. Who decides what and/or who should be paid more than another teacher or program? If a teacher works more hours or more time, then of course they need to be paid more, however, this should not be considered merit pay. &quot;I dobelieve teaching is like any other proffesion and should have a system of montary rewards for people who are going the extra mile, however, I don&apos;t believe results of standardized testing should be the only indicator to determine who is eligable for merit pay. I think attendence and evaluations should be a big part of determining merit pay. Also, a year by year bonus would be more effective than an actual change in pay since once a teacher&apos;s pay is increased it cannot be decreased.&quot;
 -- Amber Parsons, teacher, Walker County, Cordova, AL &quot;On the surface it might seem like a good idea, however many times recognition is given in a subjective manner. I do not belive merit pay could be awarded objectively.&quot;
 -- Elaine Riegel, science teacher, KImball High School, KImball, NE &quot;No. It would be very difficult to evaluate the teachers fairly and accurately. It is much easier for a teacher who teaches an elective class, such as a writing class than it is for teachers teaching a 9th grade English class for example. Ninth graders have to take English - all of them! I could list several situations that would demonstrate this. Another thought is a school that doesn&apos;t have money to give their teachers a cost of living increase wouldn&apos;t have the money to give merit pay. Let&apos;s just get money to all schools period. This is state funded public education Why do some teachers make $20,000 - $30,000 more than other teachers with the same experience in another school system? I don&apos;t think an administrator could evaluate teachers without bias for many reasons.&quot;
 -- Sandy, teacherIndiana &quot;NO NO NO NO! I do no want my pay based on ONE test give ONCE a year! Especially when I teach inner city withchildren who seldom have enough to eat, enough sleep, or any support at home. NO, NO, NO! &quot;NO! It is not. It will only pit one teacher against another. What if you have several good teachers will they all get merit pay? This will cause contention and seperation amoungst the faculty. Plus, I think this is really being implemented to try and get rid of teachers. If everyone knows that a techer has not gotten an award don&apos;t you think the principal will think of a way to get rid of him? Tell me, what other jobs do they do this in without anxiety and backstabbing? If you just gave teachers the money they are worth in the first place then this wouldn&apos;t be an issue! Come on people we all know that teachers are so underpaid most don&apos;t own a house. It appears that lawmakers can give everyone a raise but the teachers. And if they do get a raise it is taken back because of buget restraints! It&apos; crazy. Hey, why don&apos;t some of you try going to school for 6 years and get a Masters have to pay back a loan and get a job that you can barely live on? Plus teaching is not an easy job. I go home with hours of work each weekend to be prepared on Monday. No merit pay, just give us a real raise we can live on.&quot;
 -- Helen Stauffer, NO Merit Pay!, Clark county/student teacher, Las Vegas, Nevada &quot;Yes, and no. It depends on how you determine who has &quot;merit.&quot; If it&apos;s going to be judged on test scores, I say, no. I&apos;m a special needs teacher whose students do not pass the statewide testing because of their disabilities. I would never even be considered for merit pay with a formula based on student test scores. Also, like the old saying, &quot;you can lead a horse to water....,&quot; I can do everything I know to help a student, but ultimately, it&apos;s up to the student to achieve. I do believe, however, that there are teachers who only do the minimum, and they bring our profession down. If there was an objective way to determine who deserves &quot;merit pay&quot; based on their work ethic, etc, then maybe it would weed some of the slackers out of the classroom.&quot;
 -- annonymous &quot;No, because then you will have teachers that will cheat and give students answers just to get the extra buck. Teachers need to teach not teach the test. The students that are only taught the test are usually not productive citizens after graduation because all they know is the test. Our children are not learning what is required of them to become productive citizens. Whose fault is it.? I have taught for 16 years and children are not as smart or gifted as children were back in the days. The smart kids now would of been considered average. The gifted were the smart kids not gifted. Gifted back in the days were the Bill Gates. You give merit pay to teachers all it will encourage is let&apos;s make it look good on paper but in reality you will be hurting the students.&quot;
 -- Krystie Tindle, Special education teacher, Texico, Texico, NM &quot;Merit pay presupposes that one teacher brings student achievement to a desired point. Student achievement instead relies on the foundation of skills previously established in students&apos; abilities. These skills must be attributed to previous teachers, the entire school environment, home life, and the attitudes of peers. If merit pay were awarded fairly, it would need to be divided amongst the many who contributed to the learning environment. If merit pay must be awarded because of the belief that the schools systems are similar to a business, the amount should be awarded to the district, earmarked for educational supplies or curriculum. Singling out individuals or allowing administrators to decide who deserves merit pay could in fact create dissension in the educational environment. A side note: Who would want to force the school systems to model themselves after the business sector when one could compare merit pay to the bonuses certain executives have been awarded within failing companies!&quot;
 -- Rebekah McCarty, teacher, Cherokee Schools, Cherokee, Texas &quot;No, Because it makes teachers compete against each other and promotes bad feelings rather comradery. Teachers need to be a cohesive team who collaboratively work together for the good of the children.&quot; &quot;Teacher merit pay is not a good idea. All schools do not house the same educational programs. Those schools who are gifted and magnet(honor)programs would have an unfair advantage over schools who are traditional and have special education programs. How would the school system address this problem? Would the school district differientiate the rating scale according to the type of program? What rate of growth would be used and how would it be determined? The answers to these questions are too subjective and left to the interpretation of non-educators most of the time.&quot;
 -- L. Fleet, Teacher &quot;I strongly feel that merit pay IS NOT necessarily a good thing. Why? Some students teach all students -the good, bad and ugly - where as some might only teach honors or AP classes. The second group scores would be considerably higher than those of the first. What about the low English speakers or special education teachers? Their students will be scoring lower on the standardized tests by which much of the evaluation is made. What happens to these students when placed the the regular classroom, the scores go down. Not because the teacher is bad, not because the student is bad, but because of factors not in our control. Can those who hand out the $$$$&apos;s make their selections fair taking all the different factors that we deal with daily to make a fair assessment. I very much doubt it. Until assessments on the teachers ability to teach and who is a better teacher.... I say NO to merit pay.&quot;
 -- G. Jones, Teacher, LAUSD, Los Angles &quot;I don&apos;t believe that merit pay is a good idea. First, what prevents a principal from stacking an unwanted teacher&apos;s classroom with low-performing students and a more desirable teacher with high-performing students? Second, I believe that merit pay would cause teacher&apos;s to cheat for higher standardized test scores.Look at the cases of cheating in Houston and Dallas in recent years. Third, what happens to teacher who do not teach a subject that has a standardized test? Are they forever out of the merit pay loop?&quot;
 -- Brenda Goode, Teacher, Colmesniel ISD, Colmesneil, Texas &quot;No, is do not think that it is a good idea. Teachers are already going above and beyond each day and every week of the school year. I do not think it is fair to reward some teachers for coming up with a &quot;brillant&quot; idea. Some teachers, like myself, come early to school each day to make sure everything is run off an ready for the day. If teachers ask me for help with computers ( i teach computer classes) then i do my best to help them. I do not get &quot;rewarded&quot; for thiis, i just do it. I believe that yearly pay raises should be given to all teachers, regardless of special plsns. I try to challenge my students each day, to encourage them and to listen to them. I do more for some of the students than their parents. Merit pay would not be rewarded for these skills. I want equal pay just like the other teachers.&quot;
 -- megan calabrese, media specialist/technology, triadelphia middle shcool, wheeling, wv Merit pay is an idea that could
 definitely work if implemented in a positive way and productive way. Many
 teachers hit their stride and then do not continue to take classes and
 enlighten themselves as educators. While they still may be good teachers, they
 have the potential to be great teachers by putting in extra effort. 
 Districts should push educators to continue their own education to keep the
 classroom an ever changing and evolving place for students to learn. 
 Teachers who put in the extra time and energy to make this happen should be
 recognized and rewarded. Merit pay has the potential to allow the educators
 who really care and are passionate about what they do to rise up in the pay
 scale more quickly than waiting for the standard steps and cost of living
 increases. With fair standards and goals set and agreed upon by teams of
 educators, administrators and school boards, merit pay has the potential to
 keep the best educators in the profession for longer.&quot;
 -- Molly Goff, Teacher, Banks, Banks, Oregon &quot;Yes, it is a good &quot;idea&quot; but
 not a real idea. I always like to refer to the &quot;Blueberry Story&quot;
 by Jamie Vollmer when I hear about merit pay or education reform. The
 Blueberry Story: The teacher gives the businessman a lesson “If I ran my
 business the way you people operate your schools, I wouldn’t be in business
 very long!” I stood before an auditorium filled with outraged teachers who
 were becoming angrier by the minute. My speech had entirely consumed their
 precious 90 minutes of in-service. Their initial icy glares had turned to
 restless agitation. You could cut the hostility with a knife. I
 represented a group of business people dedicated to improving public schools.
 I was an executive at an ice cream company that became famous in the
 middle1980s when People Magazine chose our blueberry as the “Best Ice Cream
 in America.” I was convinced of two things. First, public schools needed
 to change; they were archaic selecting and sorting mechanisms designed for
 the industrial age and out of step with the needs of our emerging “knowledge
 society”. Second, educators were a major part of the problem: they resisted
 change, hunkered down in their feathered nests, protected by tenure and
 shielded by a bureaucratic monopoly. They needed to look to business. We
 knew how to produce quality. Zero defects! TQM! Continuous improvement! In
 retrospect, the speech was perfectly balanced - equal parts ignorance and
 arrogance. As soon as I finished, a woman’s hand shot up. She appeared
 polite, pleasant – she was, in fact, a razor-edged, veteran, high school
 English teacher who had been waiting to unload. She began quietly, “We are
 told, sir, that you manage a company that makes good ice cream.” I smugly
 replied, “Best ice cream in America, Ma’am.” “How nice,” she said. “Is it
 rich and smooth?” “Sixteen percent butterfat,” I crowed. “Premium
 ingredients?” she inquired. “Super-premium! Nothing but triple A.” I was
 on a roll. I never saw the next line coming. “Mr. Vollmer,” she said,
 leaning forward with a wicked eyebrow raised to the sky, “when you are
 standing on your receiving dock and you see an inferior shipment of
 blueberries arrive, what do you do?” In the silence of that room, I could
 hear the trap snap…. I was dead meat, but I wasn’t going to lie. “I send
 them back.” “That’s right!” she barked, “and we can never send back our
 blueberries. We take them big, small, rich, poor, gifted, exceptional,
 abused, frightened, confident, homeless, rude, and brilliant. We take them
 with ADHD, junior rheumatoid arthritis, and English as their second language.
 We take them all! Every one! And that, Mr. Vollmer, is why it’s not a
 business. It’s school!” In an explosion, all 290 teachers, principals,
 bus drivers, aides, custodians and secretaries jumped to their feet and
 yelled, “Yeah! Blueberries! Blueberries!” And so began my long
 transformation. Since then, I have visited hundreds of schools. I have
 learned that a school is not a business. Schools are unable to control the
 quality of their raw material, they are dependent upon the vagaries of
 politics for a reliable revenue stream, and they are constantly mauled by a
 howling horde of disparate, competing customer groups that would send the
 best CEO screaming into the night. None of this negates the need for
 change. We must change what, when, and how we teach to give all children
 maximum opportunity to thrive in a post-industrial society. But educators
 cannot do this alone; these changes can occur only with the understanding,
 trust, permission and active support of the surrounding community. For the
 most important thing I have learned is that schools reflect the attitudes,
 beliefs and health of the communities they serve, and therefore, to improve
 public education means more than changing our schools, it means changing
 America. Copyright 2002, by Jamie Robert Vollmer&quot;
 -- Jason Wiese, Teacher, Arlington Public Schools, Arlington, Nebraska &quot;As a profession we have stayed away from
 the debate of merit pay due to the fact we are still trying to raise the pay
 of our profession to a decent level. Professional pay for professional work. 
 We continue to slip further behind with budgets cuts etc., yet Merit Pay is
 here and is not going anywhere. While we are not afraid of
 accountability, measuring a teacher&apos;s pay on student performance creates more
 problems. There are so many more variables at play beside the teacher. One
 example is the make-up of the class. Each year, this can be a blessing or a
 &quot;challenge&quot;. Parent support has almost an equal input to a
 student&apos;s performance. Therefore, I prefer a plan that offers a
 &quot;bonus&quot; or &quot;incentive&quot; for additional training and self
 evaluation like the National Board Certification Program. In Florida, we were
 offered a 90% discount to obtain this additional credential. Many teachers
 did the work and received the certification. Now that the discount has been
 removed due to state budget cuts, very few apply. The &quot;incentive&quot;
 money for mentoring other teachers is also being removed as it was not part
 of the bargaining unit contract. Bottom line, Merit Pay under the old
 definitions...No. Yes.. if we are allowed to sit at the table and give input
 in the design of a program. But let&apos;s not forget that we are still not at
 the level of pay for our profession as we should be. Let&apos;s not stop fighting
 for that!&quot;
 -- Diana Moore, Teacher, Orange/Millennia, Orlando, FL &quot;Yes, because many teachers work their
 hardest to make sure students are learning and successful in their classroom,
 while others just sit back and give the students &quot;busy work&quot; and
 collect the same paycheck!! It&apos;s totally not fair and that&apos;s why Merit Pay
 is a good idea!&quot;
 -- S. Houston, Science Teacher, Hillsborough, Tampa, Fl &quot;I don&apos;t think merit pay is a fair idea. 
 Each year I have a different class made up of wonderful personalities. Along
 with those wonderful personalities come a lot of baggage for some of my kids.
 I can only control the environment in my classroom, not their life before
 school or after. Some years my class has been mostly mid to upper class
 students with both parents in the home, and wonderful life experiences. 
 Other years the school resource officer has been on speed dial and family
 services and I were on a first name basis. How can I get a child to be
 proficient or advanced when their home life is beyond my imagination or they
 are doing their best and it will NEVER meet the standards of NCLB. I
 don&apos;t mind measuring growth in each individual student each year, but I don&apos;t
 think I should be rewarded or penalized for things beyond my control. My
 SPED kids&apos; test scores are on my report, but I only service them in social
 areas of the day. How do you measure that on a test? If merit pay goes into
 practice, states will have to have a level playing field and student ability
 will have to be made equal in each classroom. Do we really have the
 resources to do it right? I think not. There are more important issues at
 hand in our educational system.&quot;
 -- Pamela Clark, 4th grade teacher, Nixa RII Century Elementary, Nixa, MO &quot;No. Everything learned does not come from
 just the teacher. Support from parents, administration, and government are
 important aspects for learning as well. It&apos;s a united effort to help the
 youth of today become the leaders of tomorrow. If a law doesn&apos;t pass, does
 the Legislative Committee get a reduction in pay because they didn&apos;t &quot;do
 their job&quot;? Educators today are teaching a lot more than reading,
 writing and math. Our students home lives, well being, and economic
 background all figure into their learning abilities as well. Materials
 available, funding, space, class size, etc. are also factors of a learning
 environment. One year you could have a class that has your brightest stars,
 and the next, students who may have trouble getting along with others or who
 may not do well on tests, Not every student is going to get A&apos;s in all of his
 classes, but, making the student feel that he was successful in everything he
 tried is what we need to strive for. Merit pay for teachers is going to cause
 a lot of &quot;fudging&quot; of grades, more competitiveness instead of
 camaraderie, and instead of looking out for the students concerns, teachers
 will become more self-absorbed.&quot;
 -- CAKE (Care About Kids Education), Teacher, Monmouth County, NJ &quot;No, merit pay is a horrific idea. The
 good teachers will leave the schools where they are most needed, those with
 the most challenging students. Also, the inadequacy and inconsistencies of
 assessments would make determining &quot;merit&quot; inconsistent and,
 therefore, be biased. The good teachers will flee from the schools with
 the more challenging students. They will prefer working in the more elitist
 schools where the children come from more affluent homes and can afford
 private tutors to ensure student success. Or, the good teachers will prefer
 charter schools where administrators can conveniently eliminate students with
 learning disabilities or limited English capabilities in order to boost their
 test scores. Every state has different standards and statewide
 assessments. With no national consistent requirements, merit pay would be
 based on biased and unfair data. Currently there are no consistent nationwide
 standards from which to base assessments. Neither do most assessments
 adequately reflect the knowledge of our students. For example: *Students may
 be tired or ill on the day of the annual assessment. *An end-of-year
 assessment is given three months before school dismisses (Indiana&apos;s ISTEP+). 
 *Limited English Proficient (LEP) students are required to take math,
 science, and social studies tests entirely in English even if they have only
 been in U.S. schools for one day (they get to use a word-for-word dictionary,
 but come on!). *This year&apos;s third graders are compared to last year&apos;s group
 of third graders; individual growth is not taken into account, no matter how
 dramatic the gains (Indiana again). *A student transferring from a different
 state can easily be a half year or more behind our standards. Would the
 teachers in the other state get higher merit pay by meeting their state
 standards even though the student is severely behind moving into our state? 
 The research consistently points to the inadequacy of assessments, and too
 often results from one annual test determine the school&apos;s success or failure.
 Merit pay would compound the problems in our country&apos;s education system. The
 current trickle of teachers leaving the field after only 3-5 years of service
 would become a waterfall within a few years of the inception of merit pay.&quot;
 -- Christy Pietrzak, ESL/ENL Teacher, New Prairie United School Corporation, Rolling Prairie, IN &quot;I believe that merit pay is a good idea. 
 As a core teacher, I feel much more pressure to prepare my students than
 non-core teachers do. I teach English I and II, which are both TAKS subjects
 in which the students need specific training for the tests. My scores have
 always been very good (above 95%), yet I make the same salary as the home ec
 teacher who allows students to play in class. In all other professions,
 salary is tied to performance. In education, however, it doesn&apos;t matter if
 you are a good teacher or a bad teacher, your salary is the same. I think
 that our country would see overall improvement in education if teachers made
 financially accountable for their teaching.&quot;
 -- Anonymous &quot;No, the teacher doesn&apos;t have control over
 all the elements/reasons that cause a student/class to succeed or fail. For
 instance, if I were judged on whether my students passed the WASL (state
 exam), I would want the judge to also take into account the classroom/school
 climate, family situation, health, IQ, weather, time of day, time of the
 year, etc.&quot;
 -- Lorraine Dietel, Teacher/Librarian, Edmonds/Scriber Lake High School, Edmonds, WA &quot;Absolutely NOT! If I have a third grader
 who is reading at pre-primer and I get him up to second grade reading in a
 year, that&apos;s a miracle. Will he do well on the third grade testing? NO. You
 absolutely cannot look at raw scores for anything. My class is half ESL. It&apos;s
 a given that my students scores will be lower...they don&apos;t all speak English!
 But there&apos;s no accounting for that. Do we pay the police more if their beat
 has less robberies than another? Do we pay dentists more if their patients
 have less cavities than another dentist? As someone who has worked in a
 low-socioeconomic school and now am at a fairly well-to-do school, I can tell
 you...I have not changed my teaching. But, suddenly my students score 30
 points higher on the test. Did I miraculously become a better teacher? NO! 
 At my old school, 100% free lunches, I spent my own money buying students
 school supplies, socks, and even a winter jacket or two. Then they want to
 give someone else &quot;merit&quot; pay because they are a &quot;better
 teacher&quot;? Good thing I didn&apos;t go into teaching for the high pay!&quot;
 -- Lori, teacher, Albuquerque Public Schools, Albuquerque, New Mexico &quot;Although the idea of teacher merit pay is
 good to consider, there are several prerequisites before implementing it as a
 reality. (1) Establish an objective, measurable baseline that all teachers
 are expected to meet. If it is not possible to have a single baseline, then
 justify the creation of multiple baselines. For example, the standard might
 be the same throughout a state, or in a school district, or in a building. Or
 there might be one baseline for primary teachers, another for intermediate
 teachers, another for middle school, and another for high school. A third
 type of plan might establish baselines according to describing the students
 that are taught -- &quot;regular&quot; or &quot;special needs&quot; or
 &quot;advanced&quot; or &quot;free/reduced lunch&quot; or
 &quot;homeless&quot; or &quot;alternative&quot;, etc. (2) Then carefully
 assess each teacher to find out how he/she meets, exceeds, or does not yet
 meet, the baseline. It is essential that the assessment measures are used in
 a standard way. People who administer or interpret the measures must also
 avoid (or stringently minimize) any bias. There will be still be some
 subjectivity. (3) Develop systematic ways to provide additional supports to
 any teacher who does not yet meet the baseline. To be appropriate and
 effective, supports need to match the teacher&apos;s individual situation. This
 means carefully defining the targets, logically deciding the steps, and
 providing enough supports that success is possible. (4) Keep the teachers
 who did improve and reach the baseline. When keeping one&apos;s job is a real
 future option, then there is incentive to work - change - improve. When
 losing one&apos;s job seems inevitable, then there is less reason to keep up the
 effort. In addition to the four steps listed, there are these realities: 
 (A) Having educated people is crucial to having democracy. That is one
 reason why teaching is a crucial profession. However, we must acknowledge
 that teachers provide ONE VITAL PART of a student&apos;s learning, not the entire
 picture. We need to remember that good teaching happens within settings. 
 Teaching environments are influenced by resources, relationships, community
 involvement, school climate factors, and many other variables. (B) Look at
 how standards are set and used in other areas -- such as manufacturing,
 retail, restaurants, music, sports, highway safety, etc. Then think about
 how profits, paychecks, bonuses, fame, or other awards are allotted in these
 areas. Where and how well do these other systems translate to teaching?&quot;
 -- Carol Christ, literacy teacher Salem, Oregon &quot;Merit pay based on student test scores is
 not a good idea. There are too many schools throughout the country that have
 a hard time attracting good teachers and keeping good teachers without the
 strongest academic populations. It would be even more difficult to keep good
 teachers in these districts if pay raises were tied to scores. Merit pay
 based on performance above expectations is the better way to go. Teacher
 performance in terms of engaging and beneficial lesson plans, great classroom
 instruction (observations), being available to students for extra help
 before/after or during school day, being a collegial member of the school
 staff... those are the areas it would be nice to see merit pay for. We all
 know there are teachers who go above and beyond the call of duty in many
 different ways. They are the teachers who deserve merit pay.&quot;
 -- Jennifer Carrobis, Teacher, Manchester School District, Manchester, NH &quot;No, I am a special education teacher for
 the emotionally disturbed students. There are many days these student do
 well to just get to school.&quot;
 -- Jackie Poehner, Special education teacher, Merrick School, Marylhurst, Or97036 &quot;No, it is not fair to those teachers that
 struggle everyday, getting the special education students ready for real
 life, not just academics. I know that my students at the Jr. High level will
 never be able to pass the CST higher than Below Basic Level and I feel that
 any accomplishment done by these students should be commended, not a number
 on a scale telling us how much they have learned. If my pay is based on their
 scores, I will be the lowest paid teacher for my entire career even though I
 was able to help a student be able to understand money when going to a fast
 food restaurant and be able to order for themself. Improving a child&apos;s life
 is the most important thing!&quot;
 -- Linda McClung, Educational Specialist, Cutler Orosi Joint Unified School District, El Monte Middle School, Orosi, CA &quot;I believe that teachers are already
 responsible for too much already! It&apos;s not like we are in it for the money. 
 Most teachers are there for the kids and if they are not they wont last long.
 Do you mean merit based pay like the A.I.G. executives? Run your business
 into the ground and get a million dollar bonus? Or do you mean have teachers
 put in 80 hours per week instead of the mere 70 they already put in?&quot;
 -- Lynne &quot;No. Not as generally used where it is
 quite possible for a teacher to achieve very good results using methods an
 unappreciative, or stupid, principal does not approve to be denied merit,
 and/or promotion. I would not object to merit based on pretest and
 posttests, and comparison to other teachers at the same level, and their 
 achievements with similar quality students (especially with relation to
 economic and educational status of parents, disabilities, etc). The
 objection to merit has long been based on the whims of incompetent 
 administrators, until that can be eliminated, and teachers convinced it is
 really true teachers will not be able to accept the concept.&quot;
 -- Jack Bennett, Retired Professor of Biology, Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, IL 60115 &quot;Teacher merit pay is not a good idea
 because nothing is equal for any two classes. How could it be fair when some
 teachers have the &quot;gifted&quot; students, some have the average
 students, some have ESE (special education) students, and some like myself
 who are Intensive Reading teachers have students with the lowest academics
 and the worst behaviors and attitudes in the entire school? Some teachers
 have students who are motivated to learn, but many teachers have students who
 will &quot;Christmas tree&quot; the high stakes tests because they don&apos;t care
 what their scores are. Some students do their homework and listen in class,
 but many do not. Why should teachers, who have worked hard and done their
 jobs, be held accountable for the students that have taken no responsibility
 for their own learning? Another reason that teachers&apos; classes are not equal
 is that special education teachers are NOT the ones that teach reading to the
 special education students. Most special education students are sent out to
 regular education classrooms with the special education teacher as the
 co-teacher--except for reading. Intensive Reading teachers are regular
 education teachers with certification in reading--not special education. 
 Yet, these are the only teachers that have 100% (or close to it)special
 education students. It is impossible to constantly be putting out fires and
 deal with drama in the classroom every day and still teach. When all classes
 are 100% equal, that&apos;s when merit pay should be given only to certain
 teachers.&quot;
 -- Linda Boyd, Intensive Reading Teacher, Pasco County Schools, Land O&apos;Lakes, FL &quot;I cannot for the life of me see how this
 could work. Inevitably, there will be a classroom of non-performers and
 nobody will want to teach them, lest they forego their merit pay. Merit pay
 is not in the interests of these or any students. I like the idea of
 recognition for great teachers, but teacher unions do everything possible to
 make it difficult to dismiss poor teachers. Teacher pay makes it difficult
 to attract good teachers. When kids are buying DVD&apos;s of us having a great
 lesson instead of some gangsta rapper, and when kids are trading teacher
 cards instead of hockey cards, then we will have some progress. Until then,
 it remains really clear where our society has its priorities.&quot;
 -- James Slade, Instructor, Red River College, Winnipeg. Mb, Canada &quot;Yes. For three years I participated in a
 merit program called TAP and I loved getting it. Each year I got a nice
 check for the efforts I put forth in my classroom to improve student
 performance.&quot;
 -- Carol Ponthieux, CSI Lead Teacher, Calcasieu Parish School, Lake Charles, LA 70607 &quot;Merit pay sounds like a good idea on
 paper, but ideas that sound good on paper do not always turn out to be good
 ideas when implemented. How do we determine who deserves merit pay -- by
 testing? What if a teacher gets a bunch of kids one year who are just behind
 perhaps by chance or perhaps because of another teacher in previous years? 
 Should the present teacher have to pay for the sins of the previous teacher? 
 Well then, should we decide who deserves merit pay by principal evaluation?
 In my experience the principal is really the last to know who is a good
 teacher. Principals might be able to spot the really bad teachers, but they
 seldom spot the really good teachers. Usually the teachers that principals
 think are the best are the teachers who toot their horns the loudest or win
 the most awards. Often the best teachers are humble. Good teachers promote
 students instead of promoting themselves. Merit pay is a good idea, but
 there is not a sound method for determining who deserves merit pay.&quot;
 -- Debbie Simpson, Teacher, Booker ISD/Booker High School, Booker, TX 79005 &quot;Education is a socialized system. Merit
 pay is a capitalist concept. Why would we even try to apply a capitalist
 concept to a socialized system? It makes no sense whatsoever. I&apos;m all for
 merit pay, as long as I get to choose what I teach, where I teach, and who I
 teach. I hate to tell the government this, but a merit pay plan is going to
 end up leaving quite a few students behind!&quot;
 -- Kay Evans, High School Social Studies Teacher, Jefferson County/Arvada High School, Arvada, Colorado &quot;Teacher merit pay -- mmmmmm? What will
 be the basis for determining the merit? Attendance, performance, student test
 achievement? If student achievement is the primary consideration then an
 emphatic NO. I couldn&apos;t image receiving a merit contingent upon the
 performance of another person. I can&apos;t control what others do, only myself. 
 So, a teacher merit pay should be based on the teacher&apos;s performance and how
 best to rank the performance would require clearly defined indicators.&quot;
 -- Janjay Lockett, Teacher, Memphis City Schools, Memphis, Tennessee &quot;Merit pay. Hmmmm... What is the criteria
 used to decide? Who gets to create that criteria? Who is doing the
 evaluating? Are outside influences on student achievement taken into account?
 Will there be merit pay for teachers other than math and science? What about
 resource teachers? What about music teachers? What about English teachers?
 What about elementary teachers? World languages, ELL, health and fitness,
 occupational ed, etc., etc., etc. It would be wonderful to reward great
 teachers who improve student learning. But- define learning. Whose standards?
 What standards? How do you measure it?&quot;
 -- Pat Riley, Teacher, Puyallup, Puyallup, WA &quot;No. Every teacher has a year with that
 group of &quot;Challenging&quot; students and should not be penalized because
 they did meet standards. Some good teachers (new and older) would decide to
 leave a profession that already has a million reasons not to stay and only 30
 to come back tomorrow.&quot;
 -- Anonymous &quot;No, this is not a good idea! Teachers do
 not get to choose their students. Sometimes there are instances where the
 makeup of a class is not equal-this would not be fair to the teacher who has
 the class with most of the discipline problems or the lower class. Also,
 there are too many instances where kids are not trying to perform well on
 tests, even purposely to hurt the teacher&apos;s class scores. This would
 definitely also lead to cheating.&quot;
 -- Anonymous &quot;If all the teachers were included in
 Merit Pay it would be good, but not all are given an opportunity. I was a
 Special Needs Teacher, never got a prep period, never got incentive pay and
 was never offered Merit pay. I was an excellent teacher and always got rave
 reviews from my administrators and superiors. My son is now an English
 teacher (8th) Grade. He has tremendous success as a teacher and is very
 good, if I do say so myself, however, math and science seem to get all the
 merit pay. What is wrong with this picture???? We need English teachers who
 are willing to teach well so that students may become leaders in this
 country. Why do all the incentives go elsewhere???&quot;
 -- Olive H. Emerson, Teacher/Special Education, Retired Alpine School District, American Fork, Utah &quot;Merit pay would not be a good idea
 because as it is now, many teachers welcome the challenged students. With
 merit pay teachers will be hoping for only the bright ones. What will happen
 to the quality of education then?&quot;
 -- Anonymous &quot;ABSOLUTELY! How can we can we expect to
 be respected on the same level as other professions, if we don&apos;t think our
 salary should be based on how well we do. If it isn&apos;t, what do we base it on?
 Right now most districts pay their teachers on how long they&apos;ve stayed in the
 district. How is that fair to the profession of teaching or to the students
 we service? What we are saying is that as long as any person with a
 teacher&apos;s license stays in his/her job long enough they will get paid more. A
 teacher could be the worst person for position, but since they never quit,
 they get paid more than the new teacher who has fresh ideas, lots of energy
 and who has great communication skills. I believe we would attract more
 qualified individuals to the profession if we were paid on merit. I applaud
 all districts that do this already and encourage unions to put their support
 behind this movement.&quot;
 -- Christina S., Middle School Teacher, Peace Lutheran, Bremerton, WA &quot;Merit pay, done properly, will be a
 positive change in the American education system. When the teachers are
 compensated based on their students&apos; progress (not necessarily
 &quot;passing&quot; standardized test scores) and their extracurricular
 duties, performance will increase and teachers who are not effective will be
 weeded out. There are too many lackluster teachers who are just getting by
 because they have tenure in their district, all of which could be replaced by
 more motivated, effective teachers who will work for the common goal of
 making American students successful and competitive in the global community.&quot;
 -- Valerie Neese, 2nd grade teacher, W.W. Robinson/Shenandoah County, Woodstock, VA &quot;No, it&apos;s not a good idea. I cannot, as a
 teacher, control the levels of parental support my students have. The
 teachers cannot be the only ones held accountable. What about the parents and
 the students? What about their responsibilities?&quot;
 -- Megan Landry, teacher, Terrebonne Parish, Houma, LA &quot;What are all of the variables that will
 go into evaluating the &quot;merit&quot; of a teacher or of his/her
 teaching? It would have been like asking teachers 10 years ago about 
 &quot;no child left behind&quot; and what it really entails.&quot;
 -- A Alwan &quot;I live in an area where the parental
 support can range from non existent to high. The demographics of our school
 are such that there is not a lot of emphasis placed on education for many
 families. When you contact home and talk to the parent about how Billy or
 Susie are not doing there homework and share with you that they do not study
 at all, the parents do nothing about it. We have implemented Algebra 1
 for ALL 8th grade students when this traditionally a high school course. Our
 county does not provide an alternative to Algebra 1, and seems to ignore the
 research done on how the brain is just not developed enough to handle
 abstract concepts such as Algebra. Therefore, to have my pay based on
 how my students perform would be unfair as it would not reflect all that I do
 do to help my students to succeed in Algebra. Many just do not want to do
 what it takes to be successful. I keep trying and I will not give up, but to
 base my pay on student performance would be a disservice to me.&quot;
 -- Anonymous VA &quot;I feel it would make some teachers push
 to get ideas across or adjust things so as to gain money.&quot;
 -- Anonymous &quot;It is a great idea. Tenure has been the
 death of education in the U.S. Let&apos;s pay the good teachers more and get rid
 of the bad ones.&quot;
 -- Joanne Wagerson Ph.D., Director of Education, Detroit Public Schools, Detroit, MI &quot;NO! Merit pay, as I have heard it
 discussed, looks at paying teachers for the success of their students on the
 basis of the state standardized tests. I teach remediation classes for
 general ed students where my 7th and 8th graders come to me reading at a 2nd
 grade level; in the spring when they leave, they are at a 4th or 5th grade
 level. Based on this basic definition of merit pay, I am a failing teacher. 
 My kids will not do well on the standardized tests. They have succeeded in
 learning to read and work in an academic setting.&quot;
 -- Tay, teacher, LAUSD/Mt. Gleason MS, Los Angeles, CA &quot;Sure. Those of us who work hard should
 be rewarded. Those who don&apos;t won&apos;t be. Hopefully it causes everyone to
 raise the bar.&quot;
 -- Anonymous &quot;I don&apos;t think it is wise to base a
 teacher&apos;s salary on student performance. As good as a teacher may be at her
 job, there are many factors that determine a student&apos;s success, especially if
 the primary measure of that success is a standardized test. A student&apos;s
 attitude, aptitude, home life, cultural differences, mental/physical health,
 personality and numerous other influences affect a student&apos;s ability to learn
 and perform, and merit pay ignores all of these. The system of merit pay
 would have to be carefully developed to look at individual student progress,
 perhaps even over several years, before a clear determination can be made if
 the student is indeed succeeding. Success is relative and would need to be
 measured on a much more subjective scale than I fear those making the
 decisions about who gets merit pay would take the time and effort to use.&quot;
 -- Alexandra Vozeh, English Literature Teacher, MSMA, Watchung, NJ &quot;No, teachers need to work in a sharing
 and caring environment. Some of the best ideas we use are from other
 teachers. Merit pay makes teachers competitive instead of cooperative. It
 is contrary to what needs to happen to improve education.&quot;
 -- Barbara Stockford, teacher, Sarasota/ mcintosh, Sarasota, Fl &quot;Yes, merit pay is a good idea. With the
 right planning and preparation, it gives incentive for teachers to develop
 their skills further. It also provides a clear stratification between
 teachers at different progress levels; for instance, a teacher just
 &quot;getting by&quot; and a teacher using their own time and resources to
 better their teaching skills should be compensated as such. I know that some
 teachers do not like this idea, but as I said before, with the right
 preparation, it could work wonders for our children. We are professionals
 and should have the opportunity to be paid based on our accomplishments and
 not just how long we can tough out our job.&quot;
 -- Lisa Lewis, 6th Grade Teacher, LWSD/Rockwell Elementary, Redmond, WA &quot;Merit indicates a high level of
 superiority. When a teacher is given students with varying levels of ability
 and readiness, it seems unfair to designate that teacher as unworthy because
 the students do not all test on the same level. When all elements are the
 same and all students have the same ability, then and only then will merit
 pay be a good idea.&quot;
 -- Sandra, Media Specialist, Thurgood Marshall High School, Dayton, Ohio &quot;No, it is not. Where you teach has a lot
 to do with how well your kids do on tests. Not everyone is Ron Clark, and
 not every student will respond like his students did. When kids don&apos;t care
 about education and their parents don&apos;t care about education, it&apos;s not fair
 to base pay on how well they do on tests.&quot;
 -- Anonymous &quot;My initial opinion is no. Unless there
 is a fair and equitable way in which to measure teacher effectiveness that
 doesn&apos;t put the onus of academic performance on the students I am against
 merit pay plans. There are schools and school districts in this country
 where children refuse to put forth their full effort regardless of who is
 teaching. Teaching and coaching are the only two professions I can think of
 that base the student or athletes performance/winning on the teacher/coach
 instead of with the actual performers. Children/students are too immature to
 understand that their performance on a test is part of determining their
 teacher&apos;s salary. Are doctor&apos;s compensated on the ability of their patients
 healing or ability to follow medication instructions? Are accountants
 salaries based on their clients sales performance? Is an architects pay
 determined by their clients performance? To me the idea is insane, there are
 way too many intangibles out of the control of the educator to insure that
 pay is fair and on the merits of the teachers instruction. Shouldn&apos;t higher
 education be included in this debate? Why not? After all the university
 student is actually paying for his instruction. In order to make it fair you
 would have to level the &quot;playing field&quot; by mixing all student
 ability levels and making sure that all teachers use the same instructional
 strategies, techniques, curriculum and resources. Only then can an accurate
 measure be taken and compared teacher-to-teacher. And that scenario is
 Orwellian and Un-American!!! Teachers however do deserve higher salaries for
 the tremendously difficult work that they do. No other job in the world
 requires so many timely demands as that of a teacher.&quot;
 -- Jonathan Dekker, Middle School Teacher, Saginaw Public School District, Saginaw, Michigan &quot;It depends on your definition of Merit
 Pay. If Merit Pay is based on the teacher&apos;s professional attitude,
 preparation, leadership role within the school, knowledge of content,
 organization, ability to meet timelines, continuing learning, planning and
 delivery of lessons that allow students to develop - probably yes. If Merit
 Pay is based on student achievement (teachers have little control over the
 selection of students that are going to show signs of improved achievement)
 and opinion (a popularity contest only) NO WAY! This discussion is also
 happening in Australia.&quot;
 -- Barbara Tibbits, secondary science/maths teacher , Queensland Australia &quot;Merit pay is a great IDEA. It is how it
 is determined that is at issue. Fairness, equity, and consistency must always
 be a part of any merit pay system and therein lies the challenge. Too many
 exceptional teachers go unrewarded while mediocre teachers are enabled to
 continue marginalizing potential-students potential as well as their own
 potential! It would be a very worthwhile endeavor to come up with a merit pay
 system that rewards and challenges teachers and enriches the educational
 process for all.&quot;
 -- Julie Garner, Teacher English III, Jim Ned CISD/High School, Tuscola, TX &quot;Merit pay is only a good idea if they do
 not use a single summative standardized test at the end of the year. Merit
 pay should be based off of student growth (test at beginning, middle and end
 of year), formal observations, submitted lesson plans, etc. Teachers working
 in alternative schools, and in high poverty areas should have special
 adaptations and modifications. It is important to hold teachers accountable,
 but it must be done fairly. Some teachers do wonders with some of the most
 difficult students, while others do little more than maintain the
 achievements of already well off students. Those doing more with less deserve
 recognition and support.&quot;
 -- Adeana King, Alternative Jr high mathematics teacher, Gilbert Unified, Gilbert, AZ &quot;In theory, it sounds as though it would
 be in the best interest of children; in reality, I&apos;m afraid it would be
 detrimental to children with learning disabilities, English Language
 Learners, slow learners, and children from poverty who struggle to &quot;catch
 up.&quot; Yes, those children need the best possible teachers we can give
 them, but I don&apos;t think merit pay is the way to achieve this goal.&quot;
 -- Debra Homan, Bilingual/ESL/World Languages Supervisor, Millville Public Schools, Millville, NJ &quot;No, The problem with merit pay is with
 the supervisor who is doing the overseeing. Many times your evaluation is
 based on whether or not the administrator likes you. I know of one person,
 not a teacher, who gets average even though he goes above what is required in
 his job. The reason for average is that his supervisor does not want to fill
 out the additional comments that are necessary for putting someone higher or
 lower than average. In another company they are doing away with merit pay
 because of the problems they are having with it. So why would educators want
 a system that is already flawed before it is instituted.&quot;
 -- Jeanette Martin, Gen Ed Instructor &quot;No. All the merit pay would go to
 teachers in the rich districts. I experienced merit pay in Texas and it was
 a DISASTER!!!&quot;
 -- Valerie Neese &quot;No, I don&apos;t believe it is! There is an
 old saying, &quot;You can lead a horse to water but you can&apos;t make it
 drink&quot; I work in small group situations grades 3,4,5. All my students
 are struggling in either math or reading. Everyday I go to school with the
 anticipation that the light and enthusiasm I have for learning will emerge
 from at least one of my students. Fortunately, I have had several this year
 so far. However there are many more students that just have absolutely NO
 DESIRE. I see there regular classroom teacher so just about every
 conceivable idea to be interesting and to spark interest and I do the same. 
 My para that assists me is now thinking these students may be just lazy. 
 Unfortunately our 4th grade is overloaded with these students. What about
 their teachers who have worked hard, gone about and beyond what most
 teachers do and yet when these students are tested they perform low because
 as one bright student said, &quot;no one can make us get good grades if we
 don&apos;t want to!&quot;&quot;
 -- Anonymous &quot;Yes and no. If it is applied equally and
 without bias it could be a good incentive. But what will determine the
 awarding of the merit pay? Student performance on a test? That&apos;s a bad idea
 for two reasons. One, how do you apply that to teachers outside the core
 areas that may not have standardized testing, such as art, PE, business. The
 second reason is that the incentive pay might motivate teachers to teach to
 the test. There is a lot of knowledge that we need to pas on to our students
 that is not always measured in an assessment. Then there is the problem of
 the merit pay being determined by more objective means where there are not
 strict guidelines. I&apos;m still not convinced that merit pay is a good idea but
 I&apos;m willing to listen to the arguments.&quot;
 -- Ron Sayer, Director of Choirs, Marshal High School, Marshall, Missouri &quot;No, I do not think merit pay for is a
 good idea. Through the past 30 years, I have seen some very good teachers
 who quietly work with their students and would never dream of tooting their
 own horn, or brag about a wonderful lesson, or draw any attention to
 themselves. I have seen teachers take credit for something that should have
 never happened So what happens to those teachers? Do the teachers who take
 the credit for others deserve to get merit pay? How do administers know who
 truly deserves merit pay?&quot;
 -- Diana Burt, Reading Specialist, Mascoutah Elem., Dist #19, Mascoutah, IL &quot;NO, NO AND NO. How do you measure &apos;good&apos;
 teacher. Students learn from all their teachers. Ever heard about the
 student who hated her (whatever) teacher and either realized that she had
 learned that she did not want to be this kind of teacher and was just as
 satisfied and grateful to learn how she didn&apos;t want to be as to learn from
 other teachers how she did want to be. Both ARE equally valuable. You can
 learn from people you do not like. Sometimes it takes a few years to
 acknowledge this.&quot;
 -- Antigone Phalares, science teacher, Sacramento City Unified School District, Carmichael &quot;The idea of Merit Pay sounds wonderful. 
 However, the question then becomes, &quot;How do we determine the criteria by
 which it will be awarded?&quot; Too often, teachers are judged solely by the
 achievement of their students. This is wonderul for teachers with students
 primarily from upper middle socio-economic homes who value education and are
 bright and motivated. However, it often discounts the efforts of teachers
 who teach students from generational poverty who are more concerned with the
 trauma they experience at home and where they will sleep tonight than with
 achieving in school. It also discounts the efforts of teachers who work with
 students who by definition do not achieve at the same rate as students in
 &quot;regular&quot; education classes. Does this mean that these teachers
 work less hard, or contribute less to education? Absolutely not! So then,
 how do we determine which teachers have earned &quot;merit&quot; pay? This
 has always been a difficult question to answer!&quot;
 -- Pamela D. Wilbanks, Guidance Counselor, Troup County - Unity Elementary School, LaGrange, GA. &quot;It sounds wonderful, but count me among
 the skeptics. If the merit pay is to be based on standardized tests, I am
 definitely skeptical. Until that whole process is revamped and improved, I
 don&apos;t want my pay based solely on tests that take way too much time away from
 teaching (it seems every year a new one is added) and emphasize details
 instead of a student&apos;s true understanding of a concept. We teachers are
 faced with a dilemma. Teach for mastery (which is what everyone wants) or
 get through all the curriculum that students will face on these tests which
 means often moving too fast for mastery. I also think that any decisions
 about merit pay should be made by a panel of teachers, not politicians or
 others who have never been in a classroom or have not been in one for 20
 years.&quot;
 -- Camille Cress, Teacher, Little Rock/Hall High, Little Rock, AR &quot;Absolutely not! You cannot assess
 teacher effectiveness or how hard a teacher works simply by student test
 scores, etc. There is a wide discrepancy among schools and school districts
 as to how prepared students come to the classroom. Is there really a fair
 and equitable way to determine merit pay? School districts already have
 performance based teacher evaluation programs in place. These evaluations
 should help teachers correct problems they may have in being effective.&quot;
 -- Valerie Neese &quot;As long as the administrator who decides
 which teacher on their staff is worthy of merit pay is actually impartial, is
 knowledgeable of what the teacher in question does on a daily basis and is
 fair, merit pay could be a good thing.&quot;
 -- Denise Friend, History teacher, Spurger Middle School, Spurger TX &quot;No, it creates divisions in a profession
 where we must work together to better educate our children. If teachers are
 working to be better than one another, they cannot collaborate to enhance the
 learning environmnet. Also, if experienced educators are not willing to
 share ideas, stategies, and lesson plans with new teachers, how can we expect
 them to become better. Merit pay may sound good to business people, but what
 do they really know about education?&quot;
 -- Michele Douglas, NBCT, English Teacher, Graves County High School, Mayfield, Ky &quot;No. How does one weigh the effectiveness
 of a good teacher? Is it the one who teaches in the school where every
 parent shows up to every conference, and whose children have good background
 experiences, meals and family lives and homework support and so the test
 scores reflect that? Or the one whose students and families struggle with
 poverty and the effort to simply survive and who do not do well on
 standardized test? There is never going to be a major change in the
 effectiveness of schools until parents begin parenting, turning off the TV
 and doing what they must do. We cannot do it all! If merit pay is
 enacted, WHO will volunteer to take the remedial kids, the Basic Skills
 Qualified Kids, the Special Needs Kids?&quot;
 -- Linda C. Ponter, M. Ed., Library Media Specialist, Wedgwood Elementary School, Washington Twp. NJ &quot;How do you make it fair? On what
 criteria will you base it on? I&apos;ve had self-contained Special Ed classes all
 the way to Pre-AP. How does a rules committee judge apples and oranges to
 arrivie at a fair basis for reward?&quot;
 -- Lisa Carlisle, 9th Grade English, El Dorado/El Dorado High, El Dorado, Arkansas &quot;National Board Certification in your
 subject area is a better idea. You&apos;re judged and assessed by people outside
 your district eliminating an impartial assessment being done. Districts
 should give that merit pay to those teachers that have earned the certification
 only. President Clinton had the right idea!&quot;
 -- Freda Miller, High School Math Teacher, OCPS, Orlando, Fl &quot;No, merit pay is not a good idea because
 many schools that serve the underpriveledged, migrant, and minority based are
 not able to see the gains that &quot;A&quot; schools that serve primarily
 white, upper class, educated families. If merit pay is awarded it should
 based on beginning level of students and ending levels of students, include
 more variables and test scores such as reading lexiles, writing scores,
 rather than just an overall state test score such as FCAT in Florida, or
 comparing schools within the district. A fair way of including teachers at
 each school should be included.&quot;
 -- Jill Baldwin M.S. Ed., Lang. Arts 6th grade, Collier Co. Public Schools Manatee Middle, Naples, FL &quot;Test scores may be the easiest and most
 convenient way to &apos;judge the merit&apos; of a teacher......HOWEVER:
 community-building (e.g. sunshine committee person); peer-support (e.g.
 school-wide recognition for an innovative activity used in the classroom);
 the &apos;Kyle Ripken&apos; award for faithfulness to daily schedule/attendance;
 recognition for parental contact; recognition (and $$$$) for attending
 workshops; recognition for miles walked within a classroom within a day&apos;s
 schedule; in-house recognition for any suggestions that are &apos;good for the
 order&apos; (e.g. music to dismiss classes)....etc!&quot;
 -- Susan Ray, 6th Grade SPED resource teacher, d&apos;iberville Middle School Harrison County Schools, d&apos;iberville (Gulfport), Mississippi &quot;No, Merit pay is a terrible idea! Public
 school teachers cannot control their classroom population. All too often we
 have students and parents who do not take advantage of their educational
 opportunities. As an educator, I go beyond what is expected of me in my
 classroom. As one who uses multiple intelligences and brain compatible
 learning techniques, I still have a significant amount of failures. Many say
 that I&apos;m a great teacher, but I cannot force children to learn nor do I want
 to be paid more than my colleagues. Merit pay would destroy the educational
 atmosphere among co-workers.&quot;
 -- Debrah M. Merchant, Social Studies Educator, Randolph Central Schools/Winchester Com. H.S., Winchester, IN &quot;Possibly if it&apos;s done right. It can&apos;t be
 tied to State testing - There are too many variables on the student&apos;s end. It
 should be tied to the teacher&apos;s themselves. However, that may best be
 decided.&quot;
 -- Sandy Kahut, K/1/3 reading specialist, Canby School Dist. 91/Carus, Canby, OR &quot;If merit pay means that teachers are
 being paid to work in low socioeconomic areas or with special needs students
 then I say &quot;Go for it!&quot; However, if merit pay means being paid
 based on students test scores it is another matter. Merit pay will create
 teachers that only teach material covered on tests. Merit pay will create
 territorial teachers that are not willing to collaborate with one another.
 Merit pay will create students who cannot think for themselves. Merit pay
 will create students who are not prepared to be contributing members of our
 quickly changing globalized world.&quot;
 -- Jennifer Reed, Secondary English Teacher, Sheridan High School, Sheridan, Wyoming &quot;No because it does not take into accout
 PEC, ESOL and other grops. Who will want to teach anywhere but high
 socio-economic, high performance districts. Even within those districts
 problems will follow staffing classes for students who are most in need of
 truly &quot;good teaching&quot;. I already know that my kids will not meet
 or exceed on tests. Those that do move on.&quot;
 -- Frankie Long, ESOL teacher, Sutton MS Atlanta, Atlanta, GA. &quot;No. Where I work would have no teachers
 left. They would all run for the smart kids/schools. It is a good idea from
 outside the education world. But for a teacher, we know how it works. Certain
 schools/areas, no matter who is teaching, can&apos;t outperform the consistently
 higher acheiving schools.&quot;
 -- Anonymous &quot;It is an excellent idea! Unions became
 outdated and American industrial productivity, if not the American way of
 life, suffered when younger members, following WW II, saw that they could not
 get ahead with good work because their fathers and their father&apos;s buddies
 were ahead of them in the &quot;seniority gravy train&quot;. It&apos;s time for
 initiative and hard work to be reintroduced into the classroom and for the
 NEA to shed their mantle of unionism and become a prfessional organization
 similar to the AMA or ABA. Hard working teachers will not suffer from the
 introduction of merit pay. Any argument that only members of the &quot;good
 old boys&apos; and girls&apos; club&quot; will prosper is ridiculous. Our young people
 will prosper as well as those deserving of merit pay.&quot;
 -- Jeffrey Peppers, Adjunct Professor, Northeast Lakeview College, San Antonio, Texas &quot;In theory, possibly, but in reality--no. 
 Students come to school with various academic challenges, and most of the
 time without the teachers&apos; knowledge. Social issues also play a large part
 in how students learn, which could include family, friends, economics, etc. 
 Then there is the issue about what measures would be used. How do you define
 a successful teacher? One who can show numbers, or one who can also build
 confidence in a student who has experienced past failures in order to
 encourage future learning? What about different school structures? There
 are teachers who are teaching three or four different areas and some who only
 teach one. Prep times vary, and are never long enough...and the list goes
 on...but now my lunch is over and I must teach!&quot;
 -- Lori Bogen, ESL/Career Discovery/Readiing/Spanish, +, Sheridan School District, Sheridan, Oregon &quot;Teacher merit pay can be positive or
 negative. If it is simply based on test scores it isn&apos;t going to work. 
 Other things need to be taken into consideration like continued education,
 student growth etc. I cannot say that merit pay is good or bad, it depends
 on how it is put together.&quot;
 -- Heather Baskin, GT Facilitator, MCVSD #51, Rocky Mountain Elementary, Clifton, CO &quot;No, it promotes individualism rather than
 collaboration, competition rather than teamwork, and creates an environment
 of backstabbing among teachers.&quot;
 -- Mrs. Smith, teacher, Glenbrook District 225, Northbrook, IL &quot;No, because it will create competition
 not co-operation between teachers.&quot;
 -- Beverly, Haagen Texas &quot;I do not believe it is a good idea
 because teachers have no control over home issues such as bedtime, food, or
 discipline. If a student comes to school having gone to bed at 1:00 A.M. ,
 how is that student expected to be able to learn? How can the teacher teach a
 student who cannot keep their hands to themselves because they&apos;ve never
 learned to do so? How can a teacher teach a student who is more concerned,
 (and rightly so), about where their next meal is coming from or where they
 will be sleeping that night?&quot;
 -- Anonymous &quot;no, becaused who is to really say who is
 teaching better than anyone else. I do think that in our school, an approved
 private school, that having certain years of service should account for more
 money.&quot;
 -- Anonymous &quot;I do not feel that merit pay is a good
 idea. There are too many parameters that cannot be controlled. Obviously
 teachers teaching upper level courses should have better performing students.
 Communities with a higher income, more parents with high school and college
 diplomas always tend to score better on standardized test. I always like the
 analogy of the dentist. One working in a high income area with fluoride in
 their water would have few cavities than one working in a poorer community.
 Incentive pay would mean that the first dentist would get more money than the
 second dentists because the first dentist should have fewer patients with
 cavities. We are all not getting the same raw materials yet we are expected
 to turn out the same product.&quot;
 -- Deborah Retman, Biology Teacher, Piqua City Schools, Piqua, Ohio &quot;I am absolutely opposed to merit pay for
 teachers, as I believe it will lead to further discrimination against
 students. As teachers, we should welcome ALL students into our classes;
 however we are also human and therefore fallible. For instance, if you are a
 math teacher and eligible to receive merit pay if your students score well,
 and you notice a student (or students) on your class roster who are known for
 their lack of academic ability, you might be inclined to begrudge that
 student(s). These students could easily become targets for discrimination
 and bias, by those who should be working the hardest to help them. It is
 examples like this and others that remind me that teachers should NOT be
 rewarded with merit pay; instead the salaries of ALL teachers should be
 increased to reflect the importance of teachers in general.&quot;
 -- Debbie, Gifted Facilitator, Bloomfield R-14, Bloomfield, MO &quot;Sure it is, as long as it is decided by
 teachers, administrators, and the community as to what deserves merit pay. It
 does not have to be a one-size-fits-all system for the entire nation; it
 would be based on each district&apos;s needs. I also believe it should go above
 and beyond what we are already paid now. It should not affect the current pay
 scale and customary increases, especially if the district&apos;s teachers have and
 support a union. This could be a win-win situation for everyone if done
 properly.&quot;
 -- Colene Hardy, 8th Grade Language Arts Teacher, District 67 Deerpath Middle School, Lake Forest, IL &quot;No. 1. As there has been recent cases
 were students have paid other students to exact their revenge on Teachers,
 what is there to stop them from purposely failing and coercing others to
 follow suit? 2. Because of No Child Left behind, Schools hands are tied when
 it comes to disruptive students because schools have to cut down on
 suspensions. Therefore many of these students may receive a &quot;talking
 to&quot; then are sent back to class and in most cases, unless the student
 hits another the teacher is to deal with the disruptive student. Also in many
 cases when you&apos;ve contacted the parents over and over the parents begin to
 attack you as if you&apos;re the problem and their child hasn&apos;t done any thing
 wrong. A prime example: I have a student who won&apos;t work, kicks the table, is
 rude, and disrespectful; The mother&apos;s response is that I am in the wrong
 profession if table kicking bothers me and since the story that she gets from
 her child is always different I am an ignorant unprofessional liar. 3. How would
 resource teachers such as Art, Music, P.E., Librarians, Title I Math and
 Reading fit into the equation? How would we merit merit pay?&quot;
 -- Michelle Branch, Art Teacher &quot;Merit pay is one of those ideas that is
 great in theory. How will they determine who gets the bonuses? By test
 scores? I happen to have 7 IEP students in my regular ed. class of 22 this
 year. The teacher next door has 0 IEP students. Her test scores will be
 higher. Does it mean that she&apos;s working harder? Could merit pay be based on
 after school dedication and activities. What about the young parents who
 give 100% to the job, but need to go home at the end of the day to be with
 their children? Maybe merit pay would be based on improved test scores. Do
 you think there could be unethical teachers who will cheat on standardized
 tests to get higher pay? I just don&apos;t understand how it will be judged.&quot;
 -- Anonymous &quot;No. It is a sujective way of doing
 things and unfortunately not all of those who would be assessing are not
 equitable to their non-friends. Also, try as hard as we may try, test scores
 do not necessarily show the quaslity of the efforts the teacher had utilized.&quot;
 -- Anonymous &quot;No, not everyone is an actor/actress to
 perform for observers. How can they assure that they are not changing answers
 or teaching the test when students are not taking a section? Don&apos;t you think
 that will bring out the worst behavior in people?&quot;
 -- R Sikes, 7th grade language arts/literature teacher, APS, Albuquerque, NM &quot;Bad idea. It puts all of the
 accountability on the teacher. That&apos;s a mistake. Teachers can&apos;t be solely
 responsible for students. The district administration needs to provide high
 levels of professional development and opportunities for teachers to work in
 professional learning communities in order for teachers to reach their full
 potential and reach each student. Teachers don&apos;t know what they don&apos;t know;
 they need to be constant learners as well as teachers. Districts must not
 fail their teachers in providing opportunities for professional growth. In
 addition, parents need to step to up and do their part to support the
 educational process. &quot;Process,&quot; that is the key word. Teachers
 alone do not make up the educational process. It is a joint effort by
 teachers, administrators, and parents. When one of those three parts fails,
 the whole process struggles. I believe I would support merit pay for
 teachers if it also included merit pay for administrators and evidence that
 all the parts of the &quot;process&quot; were contributing to changing the
 status quo of education. Without such, I would not support merit pay and
 stand by this statement: Merit pay for teachers ignores the
 &quot;process&quot; and mistakenly holds only the teachers accountable. That
 is a mistake. That is the coward&apos;s way, pass the buck way of accountability
 in a failed system of change.&quot;
 -- Steve Lindenmuth, Teacher &quot;Like most ideas, teacher merit pay is
 neither good nor bad. Rather it is an idea. How it is implemented, what the
 purpose is, what factors are considered in giving merit pay all play a part
 in assigning value to the idea. I&apos;ve worked with some amazing teachers who
 went well above and beyond the normal day to day in order to help a student. 
 These teachers deserve some recognition (although they&apos;d generally be the
 last to ask for it). However, basing merit pay on a once a year test would
 definitely be a bad idea.&quot;
 -- Marie Woznicki-Likavec, teacher, West Branch-Rose City Schools, Rose City, MI &quot;No! In my district, starting at grade 3,
 the gifted and talented students are clustered into one classroom at each
 grade level. There are no special ed students in these classrooms. These
 classes will always make growth and meet AYP. The other classes may not
 depending on number of behavior problems, special ed students, etc. Plus
 these students have little or no role models in the classrooms. Also, what
 about the specialized teachers at both elementary and secondary levels? I am
 talking about the math and literacy specialists, art, music, PE, library,
 shop, home ec, etc. How are these teachers judges in order to receive merit
 pay?&quot;
 -- Gale Yanish, Elementary Math Specialist, Elko County/ Sage Elementary, Spring Creek, NV &quot;I have to question the idea of merit pay.
 What qualifications/standards would a teacher have to meet to receive merit
 pay? How would merit pay be disbursed? Would the requirements to receive
 merit pay be similar to national board certification? How would the pay be
 distributed and by whom? Local school officials? State departments of
 education? The U.S. Department of Education?&quot;
 -- William Blake, Teacher, Portsmouth/Churchland, Portsmouth, VA &quot;no no no no no!!!!&quot;
 -- Anonymous &quot;As always there are many sides to the
 argument. My question is, who decides which teacher receives a better
 salary? How is this assessed? By what standards are they judged by? Are
 the standards equal in value? Is this going to lead to many tiered system
 where merit teachers are going to be lured away to better schools in better
 socioeconomic neighbourhoods? If this leads to more standardized testing and
 a hierarchy of teaching then it will prove to be fruitless and create
 disparity in the teaching field. I am not in favour of it.&quot;
 -- Greg Duval, Junior Teacher, Kawartha Pine Ridge, Courtice, Ontario &quot;It depends on how it is allocated. If it
 is going to be based on student test scores, it is not a good idea. It is
 not fair for a teacher who perhaps has gone over and above the call of duty
 teaching her students to be &quot;punished&quot; because some of them chose
 not to do what they knew to do on a high stakes test. If it is going to be
 based on one annual formal observation, it is not a good idea. Many teachers
 can produce a wonderful, hands-on, all students engaged 100% of the time for
 that one observation. The rest of the year is a different story. Merit pay
 is a good idea if it is based on a teacher&apos;s work during the entire year. If
 a teacher does an outstanding job all year long, her students will do well on
 any test.&quot;
 -- Carmen Sanchez, 5th grade teacher, Seminary Hills Park, Fort Worth ISD, Fort Worth, TX &quot;I don&apos;t like the idea of merit pay
 because I cannot see how it would benefit elective teachers at all. It seems
 that merit pay depends on student test scores. How can gym teachers, music
 teachers, art teachers and other non-core teachers get merit pay?&quot;
 -- Sharon Mitchell, art teacher, KCMSD, Kansas City, MO &quot;No, not if we look only at test scores as
 we currently do. My students are ELLs, based on their test scores, it looks
 like they don&apos;t learn anything, but I do see improvement over time. Special
 education teachers are in the same position. In order for merit pay to work,
 we have to look at how we decide who is a &quot;good teacher&quot; and how we
 measure student progress. We work with people, not products, so the outcome
 is harder to put a number on. We also have to work with whatever &quot;raw
 materials&quot; we get. We don&apos;t have the option or desire of denying
 education to students that don&apos;t measure up. We still teach them to the best
 of our ability.&quot;
 -- Brenda Krick-Morales, ELL teacher, School District of Lancaster/Reynolds Middle School, Lancaster, PA &quot;No, It would be more stressful for
 students. Also teachers would want the higher level learners so they can
 show growth and get more pay. Poor teachers would get under achiefing
 students and create more of a gap in their learning.&quot;
 -- Dave Kelley, Teacher, Eastmont/ Sterling, East Wenatchee, WA &quot;GOOD IDEA! I am sick and tired of getting
 paid the same as teachers who don&apos;t do half the job I do. Only in the
 teaching profession can this happen. The unions that made this happen might
 be &quot;good&quot; for teachers, but they are bad for students!&quot;
 -- Joey, Teacher / Language Arts, GISD, Chaparral, NM &quot;It depends. Some teachers &quot;brown
 nose&quot; the administration folks to get ahead, without gaining student
 respect. Also, for those of us in ELL with brand new speakers of English- how
 would we stack up against the teachers of regular ed students? We wouldn&apos;t
 stand a chance. All my questions on Merit pay have to do with: how it would
 be implemented, what the criteria entails, if parent voices are part of that,
 then ELL teachers would be sacked because our parent population does not
 speak out about political issues because of their backgrounds. It would have
 to be one helluva plan for me to support it.&quot;
 -- Jill Ragan, ELL Reading 7-12, Boise Language Academy, Boise, Id &quot;NO! NO! No! Who is to judge whether
 the teacher is good or bad? This is so opinion-based it scares me!!!&quot;
 -- Anonymous &quot;No...merit pay is a terrible idea for a
 number of reasons: 1. If merit is based upon principal assessment of
 teacher performance, then principal personal favorites will receive better
 pay than those who are not principal friends. 2. If merit is based upon
 student standardized achievement then those teachers (see above) who may
 receive a classroom of higher achievers will receive better pay than those
 who are working their tails off with the low achievers. 3. Most
 importantly, merit pay, regardless of the neutrality of the measurement basis
 will negatively affect collaborative, cooperative, teaching practices rather
 than foster faculty teamwork and cohesiveness.&quot;
 -- Steve Yaffee, TOSA, LBUSD, Long Beach, CA &quot;NO...because there will be too much
 cheating. Parity in evaluation cannot be achieved. Too much politics. In
 addition, some students will not achieve no matter if the best teacher in the
 world was involved. Teachers&apos; hands are tied. If students refuse to do 
 work assigned, why should the teacher be accountable? How is that fair to
 the teacher? There are too many variables ( parent involvement, poverty,
 family life) teachers cannot influence. Legislators go by what looks good on
 paper not reality.&quot;
 -- Jeanne Price, teacher Tulsa, OK &quot;It is a horrible idea. We cannot control
 which students are sent to us to be educated. We should not be penalized for
 students whose parents are abusers, absent, and/or do not have parenting
 skills nor should teachers be rewarded for being fortunate enough to have
 students whose parents are involved. How about &quot;merit pay&quot; for
 students? Students from every situation should be rewarded for steady
 improvement and good grades over their 13 years of schooling. Students who
 show merit should be allowed to attend secondary schooling, appropriate to
 their aptitude and desires, either wholly or significantly subsidized. 
 Teachers should absolutely be paid more, but I know that I would never get
 that pay if it were due to my students, and those of many, many teachers in
 my district. I see most students 5 hours per week. I cannot possibly
 compete with the drugs, alcohol, and physical abuse they see the all the
 remaining hours of their days. We do a very, very good job educating the
 students at my school and sending them on to secondary education and
 training, but meeting AYP is a challenge (100% proficiency by 2014?!?!). 
 Because of this, teachers at my school would never see merit pay if it were
 based on some standard such as meeting AYP.&quot;
 -- Cathy Cravens, Special Education Department Chair, Clark County School District, Indian Springs School, Indian Springs, NV &quot;Absolutely - merit pay is essential to
 give an incentive for teachers to go the extra mile. I teach Science in
 Texas, and the current statistics from TEA is that only 20% of the Texas High
 school Science teachers are both actually highly qualified AND are teaching
 at a higher level than the other 80%. I can attest to that. I have been
 brought in by several schools to help bring up their Science TAKS scores and
 have been successful each year - without merit pay! BUT, as a single mom and
 the hours I put into my teaching, I NEED to be recognized for my efforts. My
 students are more successful in college and potentially earn more money,
 which then has them paying more in taxes, over time. My experience has been
 that in a department of 10 teacher, only 3-4 of us actually get up and teach
 our kids each day. The others gave busy work and lots of worksheets, with no
 real instruction happening.&quot;
 -- Anne T, Science Teacher, LOISD, Greenville, Texas &quot;Yes, because not everyone should be a
 teacher. Or perhaps after many years you get burned out. So you would not
 be as effective a teacher in the classroom as you should/could be. It should
 also be for school boards and administrators. The public school system is
 self destructing and pouring more money into is not helping. There needs to
 be some greater accountability from all who are involved in education. Many
 business base pay on results perhaps that should be considered for public
 education.&quot;
 -- Mary, Homeschooler, Franklin, WI &quot;Merit Pay is NOT a good idea. Education
 is a career that incorporates many facets. We are here for the education of
 our children, not to outdo one another. Sharing, has been and always should
 be a major part of our job. Furthermore, no two districts, schools and
 classrooms can be compared equitably. Therefore it is difficult to compare
 one teacher over another teacher and be honestly fair about it....&quot;
 -- Anonymous &quot;Most of us got into teaching knowing that
 the pay wouldn&apos;t be great. Using money as an incentive won&apos;t make great
 teachers any better, and it certainly won&apos;t teach struggling teachers how to
 do a better job. My biggest concern with merit pay is what it would be
 based on. One test once a year does not show a student&apos;s growth. It does
 not take into account so many factors that decide which kids are proficient
 and which aren&apos;t. There are about twenty kids in my school that are
 homeless, and many more whose parents have six month leases so they move
 districts twice every year. How are these kids supposed to compete with
 students who&apos;s parents can afford private tutoring? I have worked in an
 affluent district before. I know that it was a lot less challenging than
 where I work now. I am now in a district where a good portion of the parents
 don&apos;t value education and are not supportive of their students
 scholastically. I have to work so much harder now to keep the kids engaged
 and I think it would be unfair to use the standards of NCLB to judge if a
 teacher is doing a good enough job to get extra pay.&quot;
 -- Crystal Estey, St. Louis, Missouri &quot;No. Factors other than a person&apos;s
 teaching abilities could easiy come into play, such as whether the teacher is
 a &quot;yes&quot; man or what his or her relationship is with the person/s
 who decide on merit pay. I believe it would be based less on the teacher&apos;s
 teaching abilities and be more like a nepotism-type of logic--if I know you
 and like you, you get merit pay. If not, too bad. It adds another reason
 for a teacher to not speak up when they disagree with administration. Too
 few controlling too many.&quot;
 -- Lynn P., special education student teacher Edinboro, PA &quot;No. Socioeconomic status is the mayor
 predictor of success. Should teachers of socioeconomic disadvantaged kids be
 punished for their results?&quot;
 -- Diana Amezaga, Teacher, Garland ISD, Garland, Texas &quot;I like the idea that good teachers are
 rewarded for their hard work. I put in many extra hours looking for
 interesting ways to teach my content and preparing my lessons. I get
 frustrated that some teachers in my school put in no extra time, simply teach
 the text and walk out the door- no differentiation, no performance
 assessments, etc.- yet they get paid the same or more than I do. However, I
 am fearful the merit pay system could be manipulated by some administrators
 to control teachers. I also find it difficult to trust that an administrator
 has a true picture of what is happening in my classroom in a short
 observation. Test scores are not a true picture of what is being taught in
 the classroom.&quot;
 -- Sheri Wortham, teacher, Social Circle Schools, Social Circle, GA &quot;No - Lazy classroom teachers will have a
 lot of time to put together a great portfolio to present what they are
 &quot;teaching.&quot; Teachers who actually move around the room and
 interact with students and create great lessons don&apos;t have the time to jump
 through the &quot;portfolio hoop.&quot;&quot;
 -- Jill, Teacher, PWCS, Manassas, VA &quot;The way teacher merit pay is set up now
 is not a good idea. Favoritism easily plays into it. Also, teachers will
 be less likely to share ideas and help one another. People are human.&quot;
 -- Kathy Carr, retired teacher &quot;Absolutely not. It will discourage
 teachers from wanting to teach in lower socio-economic schools.&quot;
 -- Anonymous &quot;No! How will it be decided? Town by town?
 If it is based on &quot;no child left behind&quot; it&apos;s a joke! The teacher
 can be the most qualified in the business and have children going home to
 empy houses, parents working night and day to make ends meet, or single
 parent families. These children, as opposed to the parent who may be at home
 waiting to take Jr to soccer practice, may not get the help and support at
 the home to get his work in on time, stay healthy as to not miss school and
 therefore fall behind,etc. A school with 28 students per class is apt to have
 more problems in the classrooms then a school with 18 per class. So again,
 how is merit going to be measured? Years experience and education is still
 the best way, and of course administration observation.&quot;
 -- Janet, music teacher, Connecticut &quot;No; it is impossible to fairly distribute
 it. Unless, that is, merit involves paying more to those who teach more
 challenging students.&quot;
 -- John Diercks, Teacher, MSD Lawrence Township, Indianapolis, Indiana &quot;No. Teacher merit pay is based on how
 well your students do on tests!!!! It is also based on personalities. When
 we are evaluated, there is always bias included because the principal or vice
 principal have taught before and there is always a bias included on the way
 we present the lesson. I have always had great evaluations, for example,
 if you are a naturally quiet person and have a principal with the same
 personality it is great! However, if you are very outgoing and your
 principal is not, then it won&apos;t go as well. Our students are not
 hand-picked, except in some cases where the teachers divide the classes for
 the next year! This happens a lot! They send the students with behevior
 problems, special needs students, and low students to teachers they don&apos;t
 like and the high students to their teacher friends. As a teacher, I have
 seen this year after year! We do not know what we will get each year; it is
 based on who they have had before, special needs, problems at home, etc. 
 Obama says, let&apos;s make the teachers accountable, but where is the parent
 accountability? You would not believe what comes into our classrooms from
 home. His kids go to private schools with other rich kids, ours do not! No,
 merit pay is not a good idea. Teacher in Corpus Christi, Texas&quot;
 -- Anonymous, 3rd Grade Teacher, CCISD, Corpus Christi, Texas &quot;It can be. However, schools must be
 careful to document reasons for such pay. In my school, it&apos;s clear that
 administration has a biased agenda, and as a result, many hard-working
 teachers who go out of their way to do more than required are overlooked,
 such as teachers who teach remediation classes. These students don&apos;t make
 splashy achievements. They may not even do much for a building&apos;s AYP. I
 wouldn&apos;t go out of my way to excel if my efforts were overlooked. And then,
 exactly what constitutes &quot;merit&quot;? Further education beyond what&apos;s
 required for certification? Publishing? Contributions to text development,
 such as evaluating texts? Being in a professional organization? State
 recognition that is part of being in the professional organization? 
 Mentoring new staff? After school tutoring? Extra assignments whether paid
 or not? Volunteer efforts such as translating international transcripts? 
 (So much work is part of running a school...) It&apos;s very complex&quot;
 -- Dasha Frangie, teacher, Dearborn Public Schools/Fordson High School, Dearborn, MI 48126 &quot;Who decides what constitutes a
 &quot;quality&quot; teacher? What is used to determine it? If we were
 working in a factory making widgets, then quality could be determined. But
 as educators, our product is not an inanimate object. Our product comes to
 us with baggage that can in itself influence the &quot;quality&quot; of what
 we are able to produce. Until there is a tried and true system, and in my 28
 years in the profession I have not seen one, I would be very leary of a merit
 pay system.&quot;
 -- Kevan Hagen, Teacher/Librarian, George Washington Bush Middle School, Tumwater, WA &quot;Yes, if everyone knows the criteria in
 advance, this method of distribution becomes fair. If not, then the work
 becomes someone&apos;s opinion and possibly not valued evenly across the board.&quot;
 -- Susan Wendt, Teacher, Hot Springs High School, Hot Springs, SD 57747 &quot;As a teacher, I can see both advantages
 and disadvantages to merit pay. I, for one, would like to receive some
 recognition when my students do exceptionally well on standardized tests. It
 shows that I am doing the job I was trained to do and that I am doing it
 well. On the other hand, there are years when you have a group of students
 who just do not perform as well as expected on tests. Is that really a
 reflection on the teacher? I know some teachers who are opposed to merit
 pay simply because they refuse to change their ways of teaching, many of
 which are no longer effective with today&apos;s society. They are afraid that
 they will look bad! I see it as an incentive to better myself.&quot;
 -- Pam Pirch, Second Grade Teacher, Holden R-III School District, Holden, MO &quot;Absolutely not! There are some things
 teachers have no control over and certain test scores are not always a
 reflection on the teacher. Students need to be held accountable!&quot;
 -- Anonymous &quot;Two-Edged Sword for core classes and
 electives, if tied to state-wide test then NO. If this is tied to an
 assessment by Administrators and verified with a portfolio and observations
 in classes then YES. Core classes (with some exceptions tie-in with
 state test) so electives are left out. Many electives are not standardized
 with tests and some vocational or life related courses very from school to
 school.&quot;
 -- R. Lucero, Instructor, AFJROTC, Orange Cty PS, Orlando FL &quot;No. It may be alright for lower
 elementary school teachers when the students are learning new skills, but
 when a 4th or 5th grade teacher is still having to teach students how to hold
 a pencil, read basic words, and do basic mathematical functions in addition
 to teaching the 4th or 5th grade standards, that is not fair. For example -
 How can a teacher be held responsible for a student to find the volume of a
 rectangle (lxwxh) if the student does not know how to multiply?&quot;
 -- PE, Educator, DeKalb, Decatur, GA &quot;Yes, but it should be based on
 unannounced observations, not on student performance on the EOG.&quot;
 -- Anonymous &quot;NO, because it&apos;s like a doctor who tries
 to teach a patient. He tells the patient what they need to do to speed
 healing and prescribes the correct medications, but it is the patient&apos;s
 decision if he follows the directions. In other words like the proverb
 &quot; You can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make him drink.&quot; 
 In many urban areas, parents don&apos;t see a value in education for their
 children. As hard as we try to lead them, they do what they want. In some
 schools parents are all over their children to excel. A teacher and parent
 and child have to want the same thing for it to work, so how could possibly
 get an averge or statistic on emotions and desires? Ridiculous&quot;
 -- Theresa Yarbrough, Teacher Science, DAllas ISD, DAllas Texas &quot;I am ambivalent about merit pay. If a
 baseline measure of the students is given at the beginning of the year and
 then regiven at the end, then merit pay would be all right. We hear people
 speak of merit pay, but what does it exactly mean? If it is based on
 something very few people could do because of the number of positions, like
 coaching, then I am against it. Would it be national or state by state. It
 is too early for me to make a rational decision without more information&quot;
 -- Marilyn Fahey, 4th grade teacher, Mascoutah #19/Scott Elementary School, Scott AFB,IL &quot;No! Favoritism; working for the pay and
 not for the kids; merit pay is not student centered; it is not about the
 student. Isn&apos;t that what teaching is about? Administrator&apos;s need to hire
 the best teachers in the first place and give them the tools to be able to do
 a great job.&quot;
 -- A Teacher, Grants Pass Oregon &quot;Yes!!! In a time when I am at risk of
 losing my teaching jobs because of budget cuts, wouldn&apos;t it be nice if they
 would consider my merits rather than my time as a teacher. I have only been
 teaching for 4 years so there is about a 75% chance that I will not have a
 contract at the end of the school year, Yet my classes have posted really
 good test scores in our state mandated tests. I wish they would take these
 scores into consideration, rather than time in job.&quot;
 -- Tammie S., 4th grade Teacher, Mesa Public Schools, Mesa, AZ &quot;It all depends on how it is implemented.
 If it is to pay teachers a bonus for extra work they do then fine. But if it
 is how basic pay is provided then it is not fine. The question I have is how
 is this measured? Not every child learns the same no matter how much a
 teacher helps them. If a child fails and the blame is placed on the teacher
 then this is a terrible idea. If that is the case almost all teachers as some
 point would not get paid due to the student&apos;s failure.&quot;
 -- Van Craven, Mr., North Springs Charter High School, Atlanta, Ga &quot;no, threre are too many variables - you
 could get a class full of problems one year and a class full of angels the
 next. Plus, the above mentioned issued could be orchestrated by an
 administrator with an ax to grind. Excuse me for being cynical, but I&apos;ve been
 burned by personal agendas before.&quot;
 -- Anonymous, English teacher, Long Island, New York &quot;No, it&apos;s not a good idea. Teachers who
 choose to teach (or &quot;get stuck&quot; teaching) in low socio/economic
 schools should not be penalized for teaching students who may be lower
 academically due to factors beyond the teacher&apos;s control or apart from
 anything the teacher can do in the classroom and school. Paying teachers for
 the level of their students is not right. Conversely, students who start
 lower (often due to socio/economic factors) but are of normal intelligence
 and learning ability, can improve their scores very quickly, often growing
 more than a year&apos;s worth in a school year. Therefore paying teachers for
 student growth is not right, since some students start extremely high and
 don&apos;t grow as much, but still end up very high academically.&quot;
 -- John Smith, teacher, Dubuque Community Schools, Eleanor Roosevelt
 Middle School, Dubuque, IA &quot;Teacher merit pay based on what? Test
 scores? If so, not a good idea! Teachers cannot choose the students they get
 in their classrooms. Merit pay based on test scores would prompt teachers to
 gravitate towards only schools with the &quot;brightest and best&quot;
 student populations. The schools with low income, and/or troubled students
 would suffer even more than they do now. How does that &quot;Leave No Child
 Left Behind&quot;?&quot;
 -- Janet Nesmith, Special Education Teacher, Omaha Public Schools-Integrated Learning Program, Omaha, NE &quot;I think it is a good idea, but shouldn&apos;t
 be based solely on student test scores. We are teaching students to be well
 rounded adults, to function in society and be custodians of the future...what
 they can do and how well they do it isn&apos;t always validated by a test. My
 students score poorly on tests but they understand the power of words, they
 can compromise, negotiate, find information, check for accuracy, come to
 class on time and be responsible for their class obligations...How do you
 score that on a test. I would hire them as employees however!&quot;
 -- Anonymous &quot;No. Not for special ed. teachers. Our
 students (special ed. pop. and even reg. ed. at times) are unpredictable. 
 For example, how can you merit a severe profound teacher when their students
 may not be able to progress academically, physically, emotionally,
 cognitively, etc. It just isn&apos;t fair. Also there are too many variables
 that enter into the student&apos;s life, school&apos;s environment, surrounding
 environment, etc. that make even good teachers feel exhausted trying to
 students achievement scores, improve grades, improve the quality of the
 educational environment, and many other factors that we as teachers can not
 prevent, circumvent, or re-invent. Otherwise, if there was one magic wand
 that could assist us in &quot;curing the problems and making all of our
 students perfect&quot; then it would work. If merit pay is based upon the
 teacher&apos;s continuing educational practices (i.e. attending workshops, course
 credits being earned towards a higher degree or additional certifications),
 then I would definitly be supportive of teacher merit pay.&quot;
 -- Helen Warden, Sp. Ed. Teacher, Jefferson Parish, Jefferson, LA &quot;Merit pay is not a good idea if it is
 based on the progress that a teacher makes with his/her students in a
 classroom. I have had some classes that it did not matter if I worked around
 the clock, they just did not progress at the rate that others did for a
 variety of reasons. Those teachers who taught the lower level students would
 have a more difficult time earning their raises. There does need to be
 something in place to rid the classroom of those teachers who are there
 simply for the paycheck, but I think that the problem could be solved if the
 &quot;powers that be&quot; were not so obsessed with making sure there is a
 warm body in the classroom.&quot;
 -- Anonymous &quot;No. It is simply that there does not
 exist a comprehensive and fair instrument to evaluate the quality of a
 teacher. When one is found, then it would be fair. Having been in a system
 for a short time with merit pay, it just breeds animosity between teachers,
 and between teachers and supervisors.&quot;
 -- Paul Hall, Math Instructor, Sullivan University, Louisville, Ky. &quot;No. School administrators cannot be
 trusted to fairly evaluate teachers. Classrooms can be unfairly loaded with
 students who score low on standardized tests. Politics and favoritism run
 rampant in the public schools.&quot;
 -- Anonymous &quot;No, I think it would become a matter of
 not how well you are doing as a teacher, but how well you&apos;ve developed your
 relationship with the person handing out the award. That feeling of
 satisfaction that comes from knowing I (as a teacher) am doing a great job is
 worth more than any amount of money, in my opinion.&quot;
 -- Lisa &quot;No. We do not pick our classes like we
 choose produce at the supermarket. We get children of all different abilties
 and work with them to move forward. In many cases standardized tests will not
 show the improvement that all of children have made. Like the case from
 Chicago several years back..it could encourage cheating on the teacher&apos;s part
 ( heaven forbid) and then what...Invlalid tests, and the children who need
 help might not receive it because of inflated scores..leaving the following
 years teacher with the dilemna to carry on this deception or suffer since
 that year&apos;s test scores will possibly show a regression.&quot;
 -- Anonymous &quot;No. I think that merit pay for the
 teachers is a good idea if all teachers have to deal with the same level of
 students. In the school where I teach the students are not evenly divided
 across ability levels or discipline. I think that teachers should be given a
 merit pay if they teach mostly at-risk or below poverty level students. 
 Anyone can teach students that are in honor classes or are college bound and
 have good parent support but it takes a special person to teach behavioral
 problem or academically challenged students.&quot;
 -- James, teacher, high School, Florence, SC &quot;Yes. Why reward incompetence the way
 unions do now. Good teachers should be paid more and those who shouldn&apos;t be
 in the profession should leave. Great teachers should earn more than good
 teachers. Teachers should be reviewed by students, parents, and principals. 
 Let&apos;s take it even farther. Bad principals should make less than good
 principals. Principals should be reviewed by those under them as well as
 their superiors. Bad principals ruin the morale of an entire school. This
 same principle should be applied to the superintendent who should be reviewed
 by teachers, principals, staff, parents, and the Board. Our teaching
 system has rewarded mediocrity and the &quot;can&apos;t do it, need more
 money&quot; crowd for far too long. Let&apos;s show teachers that they are valued
 and pay them their worth.&quot;

 list that a quality control manager can go back to and ask why a &quot;certain
 part&quot; was not installed at the &quot;certain part&quot; installation
 point. Those who tout merit pay for teachers because teachers are
 professionals, clearly have never set foot in a classroom as an adult.&quot;
 -- Cathy Button, 7th Grade Educator, East Penn School District, Macungie PA &quot;No it isn&apos;t. Not all teachers would be
 entitled to it. If one is an elementary classroom teacher or a middle-high
 school academic teacher, they would qualify. However, if one is a specialist
 teacher: Art, Music, Physical Education, Health, or Librarian, they WOULD NOT
 be entitled because there is no standardized testing in those areas. Also, in
 lower economic communities, they are struggling with a variety of educational
 / socio-economic issues that are far more important and serious making it a
 very unfair, disadvantaged environment to implement any sort of merit-based
 teacher salary. Implementing such an unfair, competative working situation
 does not service the education of our children. The school climate would
 change from a student-centered learning environment to a teacher-centered
 toxic, competative, cut-throat environment. Teachers are rewarded with
 stipends, generated via their union contracts, for after school activities.
 Not all teachers are able to make themselves available to participate in
 after school activities due to familial and personal obligations.
 Implementing merit-based pay would create favoritism to those who are able to
 make themselves available for after school activities and put unecessary
 pressure and stress on those who cannot.&quot;
 -- Anonymous, Canton, MA &quot;Teacher merit pay is not a good idea
 because there are too many factors (affecting a child&apos;s achievement) that
 teacher&apos;s have no control over. I can not forsee how such a program could be
 fair to students or teachers.&quot;
 -- Anonymous &quot;No! No one seems able to implement this
 in a fair manner. Student achievement is too dependent on who the students
 are to ever be a fair assessment.&quot;
 -- Anonymous &quot;I think that teacher merit pay can work
 if it is implemented in the proper way. Typically, a school&apos;s or district&apos;s
 success or failure is not based on the excellent or poor performance of one
 teacher. Instead, it is a whole faculty that works together to help children
 to learn. Thus, if there were some incentives in a contract or merit pay
 structure that rewarded a whole group of teachers, i.e. a school or district
 faculty, it would encourage teachers to collaborate and to work for the good
 of all. Awarding merit pay to individual teachers based on performance
 encourages unhealthy competition at the expense of the students. Strong
 collaborative faculties will lift up the marginal teacher and benefit
 students the most.&quot;
 -- Michael Bates, Teacher, Kenston Local School District, Bainbridge, Ohio &quot;No. Teaching is a collaborative
 profession and if merit pay were to be allowed, no teacher would want to help
 eachother.&quot;
 -- Meryl Drescher, Teacher, 31/PS 50, Staten Island, NY &quot;Merit pay based on student scores is not
 a good idea because not all students are going to receive proficient or
 excellent test scores for reasons such as test fear, not feeling well,
 behavior issues, family problems or peer problems. Student ability also
 enters into the picture. The same students are usually not taught by the
 same teachers every year. What about the special education teachers? 
 Sometimes their students do not have the abilities of &quot;regular&quot; or
 &quot;gifted&quot; students. Because merit pay can be so subjective and
 based on personalities. this is not a valid way to reward teachers. Why not
 offer educational opportunities such as attending professional meetings or a
 specific amount ot money for college classes instead.&quot;
 -- Anonymous &quot;Yes and no, it depends on how they will
 determine if you are a &quot;good teacher&quot;. If they are going to base
 this on &quot;student performance&quot; than I don&apos;t agree. If you teach, you
 understand that there are different performance levels in schools due to
 demographics. If they are going to base this on a teacher
 &quot;teaching&quot;, than I agree.&quot;
 -- Susan Faulkner, , Hinds County School District, Terry, Mississippi &quot;I am 53 years old and have been a teacher
 for 11 years. Prior to entering the field of education I worked in private
 industry, where merit pay is common practice, and I strongly believe in it. 
 In a school setting, however, the administration of such a program may be
 problematic. Is it possible for one or two administrators to have enough
 knowledge of fifty to sixty teachers so that their retention or termination
 can be reliably recommended? In private industry the responsibility is
 typically spread amongst more supervisory personnel.&quot;
 -- Anonymous &quot;I do not think teacher merit pay is a
 good idea. Who is to say what constitutes a good teacher; high test scores?
 What if you do not teach a testing grade. Every teacher0 is good in his or
 her own way. We all have own way of teaching that brings out the best in
 students. If a child cannot learn there are many factors that contribute to
 this, you cannot always blame the teacher. A teacher may have a class that
 is non-English speaking. How can that teacher be judged for a raise when
 their test scores or report cards may not be as good as English speaking
 children. Just getting one child to flourish in English is enough for an
 award and praise should be given to that teacher. This subject of merit pay
 will stir a lot of controversy and hot under the collar conversations. This
 should be very interesting!&quot;

 There is no way to objectively quantify teaching. There is also no way to have a level playing field. What about specials teachers? I often work until 7:30 on a Friday night because I have no library aide. Do I get merit pay for the extra work? What about the teacher who gets stuck with the class from h***? I had a class of 18 with 5 special needs students, 8 serious behavior problems, and 90% ELL. How can anyone compare that to teaching in the affluent suburbs? What about the teacher who gets the socially promoted child who is 5 years behind in reading and math skills? What about the teacher in a school that doesn&apos;t buy manipulatives or even school books?

 Merit pay. I teach special education, that means I have almost as many &quot;preps&quot; as I have students. That means, like most special ed teachers, I do a great deal more than my colleague who teaches the same lesson to each of her 8th grade pre-algebra classes of gifted students. That&apos;s OK, I knew that when I chose to teach special ed. Here&apos;s my concern: My kids don&apos;t make great gains. Before NCLB (a.k.a. No child left untested) I was able to teach my students at their ability level. It was great and we made great strides. Some of them who had averaged about 3 months gain a year were making close to 1 year progress a year. But now the great and wise powers that be decided that my kids will be tested on grade level regardless of their achievement level. Most of my kids will not pass a grade level test. So will I get merit pay? Probably not.
When I taught in California we had merit pay and it was given to the schools that showed gains. They distributed it as they saw fit. My school distributed it equally among the staff; all the staff including aides, custodians, office personnel. We all influenced the students, we were all rewarded. If something like that was implemented that would be great. report abuse vote down vote up Votes: +1 Merit Pay

 I have read over many comments on this board. I have listened to a variety of commentators and politicians and then looked at my own experience. I am the teacher who is given the students who are at risk and in special education programs of various types. My students generally do not test as well as others. They have too many factors working against their education. As I said to another teacher the other day, many of my students would thrive if they were given different parents and the opportunity to do over the last 13 years of their lives! I consider it a miracle that many of my students manage to graduate from high school at all. Most of those who propose merit pay want to base it on something &quot;objective&quot; like test scores. Tests, as most of us know, are written in the language of the writer of the test. They do not reflect student realities. They are terribly subjective. Furthermore, the students that I get in 8th grade have been told they are bad students and unworthy human beings so many times by the time they reach me that it is ridiculous to think that they would consider taking a test with the belief that they could do well. So, if merit pay comes to pass, what hope would I have of receiving a share? What motivation would their be for me or anyone like me to try to take on the more difficult students? We know that they don&apos;t test well.
When, and if, someone can come up with a way to award merit pay that is not based on test results, does not rely on being vocal about one&apos;s achievements so that they get noticed (who has the energy after 6 straight classes with at risk students), does not rely on currying the favor of those with the power to confer the money, and does have some objective basis, then it will be a good idea. Until then, merit pay is not a good idea and would function only to push more quality educators out of the public schools and into the private business sector. report abuse vote down vote up Votes: +3 WHO HOLDS ADMINSTRATORS ACCOUNTABLE?

 No. There are already strategies in place for teacher accountability. They are called principals. Then there are the regional superintendents, etc., etc.,... When the checks and balances (principals and the like) are in place and productive, teachers are held accountable. As anyone looked at Administrators! I worked in an outstanding school and slowing watched it fall apart because of a lack of a good administrator. Just like any job, when an employee doesn&apos;t get feedback, good or bad, it has an effect on the performance. There are so many factors that come into play as to why a child or children are not achieving. As many have already mentioned.

 Well let&apos;s see. If we are basing merit pay on what I have seen by the corporate world, the very teachers who are the worse, have run the school in the ground, and pass the buck will get all the merit pay. Seriously, I am a teacher who teaches at-risk youths from an inner city school in South Carolina. My job is to teach English. I believe I am a good teacher with 10 years experience. I have absolutely no control over the outside social forces that allow my students to become mothers and fathers at 16, come to school hungry, go to jail, use drugs, don&apos;t value school, and show absolutely no respect for school.

 Merit pay is an absurd idea. It assumes a level playing field in terms of a teacher&apos;s resources and the support of their administrators. It pretends that any one teacher is the sole influence in a student&apos;s academic performance. It also rewards only measurable academic scores, when there are so many other kinds of success for many students. The biggest danger is that the award of merit pay will be polluted by school politics because, ultimately, it cannot be objectively measured.
Teachers absolutely need to be rewarded and recognized for their efforts, merit pay is not the way to do that. Finally, the public will assume that all the teachers who did not receive the merit pay must be substandard, and teachers will be polarized. Merit pay will do severe damage to everyone involved in education. report abuse vote down vote up Votes: +3 Reading Specialist

 I am not in favor of merit pay. Teachers can only work with what we&apos;re given and there are too many variables that we do not have control over that would reflect our pay. Presently, I have one student who has been retained twice and is involved in drugs, another has joined his parents in the gang, three cannot get to school on time and thus miss half of my class two or three times a week. I have no control over these issues. I can try to make a difference, call parents, make home visits, but ultimately, I have no control.

 It seems so simple to me. Merit pay is a great concept. One that I agree with but NOT in public education. It simply cannot work. Many of the reasons are listed in the comments so far. I am completely on board the merit pay bandwagon for many occupations. Public education is not one of those occupations. When and if it comes to public education, you will see the ambiguities and poorly designed system. Do you really want to help teachers become better teachers? Start supporting them with good professional development. Don&apos;t expect a teacher making $60,000 and taking home around $30,000 to throw $1000 at a 3 credit course. Their children and families come before that when money is tight. So, good luck with the merit pay idea: I give it a thumbs down. report abuse vote down vote up Votes: +0 Merit Pay for Teachers

 Whenever the issue of merit pay is brought up, two things come to mind. First, that the issue of merit pay is based upon the assertion that if I work harder, my students will achieve better results, and I would therefore be entitled to receive more compensation. However, this is based upon the assumption that I am lazy and undedicated and only entitled to more compensation if I work harder. The argument in favor of merit pay does not take into account the qualities of the students I work with, the physical conditions that I work in, and the amount of community support that I receive.

How about instead of merit pay for teachers, we change the salary system to an hourly wage scale, where teachers are actually paid by the time they actually work. Of course this would also include overtime and weekends, the time spent preparing lessons and grading assignments.

Second, why is it that the people most in favor of merit pay for teachers haven&apos;t advocated receiving merit pay for themselves? If merit pay is such a wonderful concept, maybe police officers should be paid based upon the number of traffic tickets they write, doctors on how many of their patients are actually cured, and politicians should be compensated at the end of their terms based upon how highly their constituents evaluated their accomplishments. Society allows lawyers, doctors, dentists, accountants, engineers, etc to regulate themselves because the rest of us &quot;don&apos;t understand what they do&quot;, but any fool can and will criticize teachers because it allegedly does not require any special skills to be a teacher.

Finally, has anyone else noted that the people coming up with all of these new and wonderful plans for “improving” education are the ones who aren’t going to do the actual work?

 I am struck by how many of the &quot;no&quot; answers use the fact that there are students in their class who do not improve or grow as a justification for not supporting merit pay. And from these responses, it does not sound like just one or two students per class - otherwise, why the concern? This is deeply concerning to me.

I go into a classroom with the expectation of myself that I will reach all my students. Yes, there is the occasional one (or two) who have special challenges whether it be a lack of home support or a different style of learning BUT that does not give me the right to excuse myself from teaching that student.

 I think that all teachers in the teaching profession should be paid the same amount no matter where they are teaching or who they are teaching. In the end it all boils down to all teachers having to put the same amount of effort and work into doing what they should love in this profession - which is helping the children.

Yes I could say that some teachers work harder than others but we should all be compensated equally and fairly for the work we do. Why should some educators get more pay just because they have an opportunity to work in a more upclass or higher status school/area.

This does not up the morale or motivation of teachers to perform better because in some cases there is no opportunity for the pupils to achieve or the resources for improvement.

I just think we are all human beings doing the same work so we are all equal and should be compensated that way as well. report abuse vote down vote up Votes: +1 Teacher - teaching those nobody wants!

 At my school, which also, ability groups students by course, its the lower achieving teachers who need help. Everyone wants to pay those who teach the brightest and best students more. Why, these are the only teachers who love their jobs? It&apos;s the teachers who are teaching the destressed and far from the best who need help, support, prayers and money to keep going. In the military those who fight as soldiers get combat pay for active duty. Maybe we need to elevate and support those who teach the lowest students instead of those who are already enjoying teaching the brightest and best. Remember a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. I have been around, am 56 years old, have been a successful businessman, preacher, and teacher. I am tired of hearing teachers who are battling the lower classrooms say, &quot;I hate my life&quot;. These teachers are some of the most stressed group of persons I have ever been around in business, or ministry. We have got to help stop teacher turnover and this is the group that is leaving education by the droves, not those who teach the brightest and best.

 It seems that this whole merit pay proprosal could lead to a crazy situation that could get out of hand easily. Who would be the judge of the child&apos;s growth? The teacher, the administrator at that site (bad news) it could easily lead to a rating of teachers at a site and we all know with any sort of testing there is someone at the top middle and bottom, or the next year&apos;s teacher when the child comes in with or without skills to move on in their grade. Also what is to be done if a teacher does not merit merit pay? reeducation ?

 Merit pay is a good idea in theory, however it is impractical and unfair. Studies have confirmed that there is a direct correlation between success in school and socio-economic status. Rewarding teachers that have the good fortune to work in communities that support educators and education and penalizing those who choose to work in communities where teachers are not supported, nor respected is highly unfair. The criteria for assessing success will impact on how we teach. Instead of teaching curriculum, we will be forced to &quot;teach to the test&quot;. The pressures of student success in the standardized test will demoralize those of us who teach special needs children, and children who are disaffected because of their personal stuggles. Perhaps Mr. Obama can focus on parent education to improve student success.

 In theory, merit pay sounds great. But how would one quantify the worthiness of such a reward? If merit pay is based on student achievement as measured by high-stakes testing, then teachers seeking higher pay would vie for jobs at schools serving students from upper socio-economic families. Paradoxically, we need the most innovative, passionate and experienced teachers working with students at the greatest risk. I&apos;m not sure how one would measure the merit of such a professional. As a seasoned teacher, I know such colleagues when I see them. They are magicians, explorers and pied pipers; they call forth excellence from their students, and these very students blossom, regardless of background. These co-workers inspire and make me do a better job.

 I wish merit pay would work. Unfortunately, even the data that Ed Fields mentioned is extremely unreliable. For example the ELA exam is given in January in NY, so, is it the current teacher who takes the credit for the success of the student or last years teacher? Then you have a huge school system like NYC where administrators have been known to change answers. Although we would like to think this doesn&apos;t happen, I know places where it does. I think merit pay would work if we didn&apos;t have the human factor. Until we can take that out it won&apos;t work. I agree with the previous blogs that merit pay would hinder teacher collaboration and could demoralize a school where the stress levels are already at the breaking point. I know there are a few rotten apples in the barrell, but most teachers I know are working as hard as they can to teach their students without supplies, correct curriculum, and freedom to teach the students in a way they feel will most increase learning. If we have merit pay, teachers must be allowed to teach students using material that they choose or it will be unfair to judge a teacher based on programs that are based on faulty research and developed for totally different populations. How can you compare a school that is fully stocked with a variety of good, sound curriculum and technology with a school that has none? In order for merit pay to work the playing field must be equal at all levels.
