Incorrect syntax near &apos;Go&apos;
 Tags: command , create , database , design , disabled , icannot , incorrect , index , indexes , manage , microsoft , mysql , oracle , server , sql , syntax , view Hi,
I am trying to create index on view. First of all in design view I
cannot use Manage Indexes command.(it is disabled)
Then if I try to add Create Index... command in the View Properties I
cannot use statement &quot;GO&quot;
System is prompting me: incorrent syntaxt near&apos;GO&apos;
If I remove Go everything works well.

I was trying that on different views but I cannot use GO anywhere.

Thank you for help

 Post a Comment Now. Comments Sun, 25 May 2008 12:24:00 GMT (1) GO is not a T-SQL command. It is a command for Query Analyzer and OSQL
client apps, to tell them when to fininsh a bach. Look more about batches in
Books OnLine.

&gt; Sun, 25 May 2008 12:25:00 GMT (2) You can&apos;t put multiple statements in a view definition and GO isn&apos;t a
TSQL command anyway - it&apos;s a batch separator.

Does the view conform to the rules for indexed views? Maybe that
explains why the index management option is disabled. Query Analyzer is
a much better place to make schema changes so use QA rather than
Enterprise Manager.

I was looking for all the rules, and couldn&apos;t create that indexed view
in Query Analazer anyway. I will read more about those rules. Post a Comment Now.
