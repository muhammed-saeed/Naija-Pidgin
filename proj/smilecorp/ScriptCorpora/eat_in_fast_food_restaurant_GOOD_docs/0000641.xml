I think it&apos;s great for Mr. Vick. I think the&quot;PETA&quot;people should get a life. They seem to not have a problem eating beef or chicken as long as it looks pleasant on their plate. I&apos;ve seen first hand how those animals are killed, cut up, and frozen for shipment to the&quot;American table&quot;. It&apos;s not pretty. Give Vick a break. He made a mistake and paid his dues. Let&apos;s wish him the best and move on.

If CNN thinks that Michael Vick&apos;s return to pro football is news, I am going to stop watching CNN, and I am turning my television and radio to a different station every time his name is mentioned.

To compare him with Martha Stewart to unbelievable. Ms. Stewart did not cruelly kill innocent dogs or anything else.

His crime is a bad as abusing a child. The dogs can&apos;t protect themselves either. What is wrong with our society when a person can just be&quot;forgiven&quot;for doing something this horrible. I am outraged that you continue to talk about this. It is NOT newsworthy.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:02 am | Sara 

I have been watching Patriots&apos;games since I was in the womb, its in my blood to watch football. But I will NEVER watch another NFL game as long as I draw breath. Vick is a sociopath who tortured and killed dogs for profit. Someone who treats a living being like this is a sociopath and should never be put in a position where they might be looked up to by our children.
He doesn&apos;t deserve anything. He served his time, fine, but he deserves nothing else. Let him get an office job.
The NFL, especially the Eagles, should be ashamed. I can not and will not support an organization that would have someone like Vick as a member. I have morals, values, and ethics. So long and good bye NFL, my eyes will never look upon you again.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:09 am | Michael, NJ 

Could joke that the Vick signing is another reason for Giant fans to boo the Eagles, but this one is beyond humor. Any nickle they make off him is blood money. No such thing as a&quot;2nd chance&quot;in this case . . . animal torture was his way ...of life, and he&apos;d be doing it TODAY after training camp if he hadn&apos;t been busted.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:18 am | molly 

Michael Vick has showed little to NO remorse whatsoever for his actions. Let&apos;s not forget serial killers start out abusing animals. I&apos;m sickened and disgusted they are allowing this vicious unrepentent man to play. I will boycott all football, sadly, this year.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:19 am | Arlene 

While I do not condone his actions, I think the guy does need to keep busy and productive in order to stay out of trouble. There are worse criminals playing for the NFL, why not Vick? I would like to see him donate a percentage of his earnings to an animal shelter, ASPCA or similar entity. I wish him well.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:20 am | osa 

It was not a fair scripted sentence to say the Disgraced Michael Vicks, pls try a better phrase in describing him next time. At least he served his sentence.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:21 am | Dan 

Good for MR.Vick, He did a horrible thing was arrested and jailed . Mr.Vick did his time sent from the court . Now let the man be . We cannot punish him for ever , if people feel the sentence was too short then let the blame be on the justice system .
 August 14, 2009 at 9:21 am | Dad in Houston 

If the NFL thinks that they can hold someone like Michael Vick up as an example of leadership for our young people it is a really sad statement on the NFL. They may think fans will accept anything they dictate....but they may have another thought coming. Parents may not be able to have much affect on the Eagles organization but we can have a devastating impact on Lincoln Financial their main sponsor.

Boycott the Philadelphia Eagles
Boycott Lincoln Financial

im actually glad that man is playing. people need to stop hating on vick and just live there own life. they act like they are perfect when nobody is. congrats to vick!
 August 14, 2009 at 9:21 am | tom 

vicks done his time.he shouldnt have to sit out anymore games.let the man play.he is an amazing talent.stop comparing animals to people.a dog is nothing like a human.he did no harm to anyone.vick is a football player and a great one at that so i am very excited to see him grace the playing field again.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:22 am | Art Chapple 

Entire story overblown. Vick did make a mistake, paid a price. He should be allowed to get on with his life. We all can make a mistake.

As much as people need role models that always set a good example, we also need those who fail miseribly and rise from the ashes to lead again.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:22 am | Brooke 

I wonder if that had been a person that he abused would we be so tolerant of his behavior. I believe that it is worse considering the abuse could not be vocalized by the animal the he was maliciously tormenting. How can anyone consider him useful for anything.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:22 am | Cody Krecicki 

Dog fighting has been around forever, it&apos;s our new found ethics against animal cruelty that had him suspended. Let him play, he worked hard enough to get there. Such a debatable topic should not ruin a mans career.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:23 am | Barney Moreau 

I now have a new NFL team to hate. Signing Vick who has showed no remorse and who lied to the commisioner is a joke. Letting him play is a joke. Why doesn&apos;t the NFL recruit from prisons–former murderers would be nice? The Eagles showed they are are a classless orginization.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:23 am | Mark Goldstein 

Let me first say that I personally can never fully forgive Michael Vick for the abuse and torture that he inflicted on his dogs.
That being said, he has served his time, and that is how our society works.
If he will go away, and get out of my site, then fine.
But to give him an opportunity that many many others are in line for, I think that that is insulting to us as Philadelphians, and insulting to those that have done far more to deserve their chance in the spotlight.
As far as I am concerned Vick gave up that chance, and needs to be forgotten about now.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:23 am | Victor Rutledge 

I think that Vick doesn&apos;t deserve to be back in the NFL. Who knows how many dogs were killed in his business. Its over for all those dogs it should be over for him.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:24 am | Dena Coleman 

It&apos;s good news that MV got a second chance to prove himself as good man in this society. He went thru the system, behaved like he was asked, did his time, and now he&apos;s free and gets another chance on life. It&apos;s good news. We all are here to be respectable persons in society, he did his time, now let him stand up and be the once again human being he is trying to be. He&apos;s not a DISGRACED FOOTBALL PLAYER, he&apos;s is a FOOTBALL PLAYER!!. Most that go thru the system don&apos;t get a chance to be a productive person in society anymore, it&apos;s a good thing that he gets a chance to get another job at what he did before, he was good at it , and if Ms Stewart can come out doing her same job, why can&apos;t Vick?
 August 14, 2009 at 9:24 am | theresa zylawy 

i don&apos;t agree that he should be so lucky to make that kind of money again. i might be more forgiving if he agreed to donate 80% of his pay for the next five years to the humane society or some children&apos;s programs.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:24 am | David 

I can always tell when it&apos;s a slow news day or week, television news stations spend enormous amounts of time sensationalizing unworthy stories. So Michael Vick got a job, big deal, t&apos;s a sports story, not news, move on to something else. Thankfully many convicted felons have a venue to practice their trade.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:24 am | Ami 

Incredible...I think the NFL should just start recruiting all of their players from the prisons. I remember when professional ball players were a real inspiration to children and someone our children could look up to and aspire to be like. Professional ball should be reserved for players not only talented on the field, but good role models for our country as well.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:24 am | tom 

by the way sara,you are hilarious.haha&quot;so long and good bye nfl,my eyes will never look upon you again.&quot;haha wow
 August 14, 2009 at 9:25 am | dino di enno 

Vick should not allowed to play. When holding a postion in the public eye, especially when kids are looking up to you. you have a responsibility to the fans! You have a responsibility, He already showed he doesnt care. He has the money go to vegas! to gamble. These guys dont realize the impact there actions have on our children. They need to be held accountable!!! Time in jail is not enough! take there jobs!
 August 14, 2009 at 9:25 am | Megan 

All year my family looks forward to football season. This year we will not watch. Allowing Michael Vic back is a mistake and sends a very bad message to children who watch these players with awe. Essentially Vic is a murderer and should be treated as such.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:25 am | mike 

The NFL is turning into a thug-sport. Michael Vicks&apos;actions are so despictable, so reprehensible that they can not be overlooked. I can&apos;t watch any game associated with Vick and will let sponsors of his games know I won&apos;t be buying any of their products any time soon. He lost his privilege to be in the NFL.. Let him go get a regular job like the rest of us.

Ex-NFL fan
 August 14, 2009 at 9:25 am | Tom R. 

I think Michael Vick has probably learned his lesson. He committed a crime and has served his time so now it&apos;s time to get on with life. While I don&apos;t think dog fighting is right, Mr. Vick didn&apos;t hurt a human being or commit a crime serious enough to warrant never playing football ever again. I wish him the best with the Eagles and commend them on giving him a chance.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:25 am | George 

I think Mike has served his sentence for his crime and should be left alone. We all make mistakes so leave him alone and let him live his life in peace and harmony. Better yet he who has not made a mistake cast the first stone.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:26 am | Amber 

I think that all Mr. Vic is looking for is to make millions again. This just shows on how much people forget. I will never forget what he has done and I am sorry, but I think he got off easy. If it was up to me he would have gotten a lot harsher punishment and banned from playing any kind of pro-sport. This just shows that the NFL really does not care who plays for these teams and that the Eagles owner&apos;s have no real ethics.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:26 am | Tammy 

We have all made mistakes in our lives and we can share the stories by reflecting back. Michael Vick has definitely made a mistake and trust me he feels humiliated. He had served his time in jail and completed every day of it. We should move on about the events he have done and give him a second chance like everyone on earth. EVERYONE GOT A SECOND CHANCE AT SOMETHING IN THEIR LIVES!!!!!
 August 14, 2009 at 9:26 am | David 

I&apos;m just glad he&apos;s not signing with my team. A thug is a thug no matter how well he throws a football.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:26 am | james Timpson 

He should only be allowed to play unless he is forced to clean out dog kennels at his local animal shelter. I am so glad my team (the Ravens) didn&apos;t sign him because I dont have to pretend to root for him, the Eagles organization has no class!
 August 14, 2009 at 9:27 am | aj 

I&apos;m glad to see michael vick return to the nfl, he has done his time so let him play
 August 14, 2009 at 9:27 am | Brenda 

YES! Mr. Vick is back, can&apos;t wait to see him play. My applauds and utmost respect for Coach Andy Reid (and team) for his understanding toward another human being. GO Eagles -all the way!
 August 14, 2009 at 9:27 am | Phil, Georgia 

Its out of this world how Mcnabb is always&quot;above it all&quot;for the greater good of humankind. He deserves tons of credit for openning up his team to allow a great player to be a possible threat to his position. This takes great class, leadership and lack of selfishness. The Eagles are being a model of redemption, born again principals, that says you can get more opportunities to succeed in life.
There are tons of creative ways these two players can co-exist.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:27 am | David Nyambi 

Seriously I think people need to allow Vick to return to football without being criticized incessantly. He has done his time in jail, and has apologized with the utmost sincerity to the whole country. What he did was atrocious but it is the past. Why must he shoulder this large stigma for the rest of his life?

Human nature is a horrible thing and Vick was overcome by his. He subjected those dogs and them to immense pain and, invariably, death. We were all disgusted by his acts but we need to get behind him because we are all humans that make mistakes, and if we can&apos;t find the capacity to forgive him in some form then we might as well claim to be angels.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:28 am | Jill 

Michael Vick made a mistake and paid for it. Seems like double standards we have athletes that drive drunk, beat up their wives, are charged with assault, are charged with rape–crimes against people and we forget and forgive. Time to do the same for Mr. Vick
 August 14, 2009 at 9:29 am | eileen 

I feel its a sin to allow Mr Vick to play football after the abuse and killings of innocent animals, then to bury them on his grounds after killing them because they lost is SICK. It amazes me that we allow this type of behavior all in the name of money. This man needs rehabiliation. Funny, if someone else was caught abusing an animal they are fined, advised to seek therapy as this is a sign of a serial killer. However, Mr Vick does not get this same label attached, why?? he has money.Our society has lost its morals by promoting this man. Wake up, he commited crimes. These fans of his on TV make me sick, but on judgement day Mr Vick will get his real punishment by God. The citezens of this country should be outraged that he is not in jail.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:29 am | judith chandler 

There is no way Vick should be given another chance. He took sadistic pleasure in seeing animal tortured and killed. This just shows the NFL is more interested in profits than fairness. One cannot help but wonder what would have happened if Vick had been sentenced to the same type of death as these innocent animals. Would he have protested that is was cruel and unusual punishment? It is with great regret that I say good-bye to the NFL. This time they have gone to far in signing low life criminals!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 August 14, 2009 at 9:30 am | A.K. Drach 

A sadistic, brutal dog torturer is returned to the national scene as a role model and renewed millionaire? This decision is immoral and was driven by greed on the part of NFL leaders. People who torture animals cannot be rehabilitated. The&quot;time&quot;that Vick did for his crimes was calibrated more torward getting him back into football during his prime than toward appropriateness for his horrific acts of cruelty. I am shocked and dismayed. Do people really understand what this man did?
 August 14, 2009 at 9:31 am | The Marginalizer 

Dena he IS a disgraced football player and he should never be held up as a good person to any child. You probably think they should parole Charles Manson....after all they both slaughtered in the same manner huh?
 August 14, 2009 at 9:32 am | Dawonne Jackson 

I feel that the whole ordeal is being blown-out of proportion. You have white police officers killing black men in this country and nothing comes happens, but you get a black man who has been involved in killing&quot;DOGS&quot;and the black man goes to jail and prevented from having a&quot;FAIR&quot;second chance. This country still has racial issues that must be exposed and tackled at the root.... we&apos;ve been here for over 400 years and we&apos;re not going anywhere so learn to practice equal justice.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:32 am | Michael, NJ 

Hey Art–I respectfully disagree. He didn&apos;t just make&quot;a mistake&quot;–he tortured and killed animals, repeatedly, as a way of life. When you do it over and over and over again, it is not an&quot;oops, I made a mistake.&quot;And whomever said&quot;disgraced&quot;should not be used to describe him, I find that incredibly ignorant. If someone who does what he did can not be labeled as&quot;disgraced&quot;then that word should be removed from our vernacular all together.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:32 am | Tamara 

I am shocked that Vicks is back in the NFL. I remember the tears my child cried when his&apos;Hero&quot;was arrested for such a hanious crime. Vicks might have done his time, but to be back in the lime light and to be giving autographs and having children look up to him or admire him is just wrong..
 August 14, 2009 at 9:32 am | james Timpson 

Maybe the Eagles can Sign Jeffery Dalmer, I heard he could punt a little? Or maybe Osama Bin Ladin, He would be a great locker room leader I doubt he could get a helmet on his fat head but who cares!
 August 14, 2009 at 9:32 am | Anastasia 

I find it appalling that the majority of the coverage of Vick&apos;s return to the NFL fails to mention the hideous cruelty of his crimes. Hats off to Donovan McNabb for at least mentioning the dogs. In spite of the horrors they suffered, many of the dogs rescued from Bad Newz Kennels are now loving family pets, and visiting hospitals as certified Therapy Dogs. The dogs that Vick executed with his own hands were not so lucky–let&apos;s not forget them.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:33 am | John 

What Michael Vick did was appalling, what the NFL did by letting him back in was even worse. I believe to get into the NFL you have to sign an ETHICS CONTRACT if this is not a violation of that contract then what is?
I am thoroughly disgusted and will never watch another NFL game again. I will find something more productive to do with my time and money...
 August 14, 2009 at 9:34 am | Kelly 

Vick? How unsurprising. This man caused SUFFERING and LIKED IT. His crimes are of a particularly horrible bent: They are CRUEL. But in America, principals play second fiddle to money - unless it&apos;s politics - and all will be forgot when he starts generating revenue for the Eagles. I wonder what his status now would be, were his crimes against children (and not animals)? Sentences for these kinds of offenses regularly run less than 18 months. This might be the only kind of crime that might awaken the masses to his actually having some something really disgusting.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:35 am | Lauren 

Michael Vicks made money tortuing, electrocuting, shooting, and violently killing defenseless animals for sport. He does not deserve to play for the NFL. No amount of time in jail would make me feel he has made up for what he has done.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:38 am | Tom R. 

OMG. I wonder what planet some people come from.&quot;Serial killers start out abusing animals&quot;. Michael Vick is a&quot;sociopath&quot;because of his crime? I love animals, but is seems like they get more sympathy and attention than a human that has been treated badly or harmed. If Vicks crime and being signed on with the Eagles is this so upsetting, then there&apos;s always Animal Planet.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:38 am | Debbie Hightower 

I am embarassed to be a Philadelphian today. It&apos;s an absolute disgrace that he was signed by any team, but I&apos;m completely distraught that he was signed by mine. I want Jeffrey Laurie to explain to the fans why he can&apos;t hire someone who can pass a criminal background check. Football is following basketball down the toilet as it continues to protect, retain and hire felons within their team rosters. One wonders why they just don&apos;t move these sports directly into the prison system. Then we wouldn&apos;t have to pretend that these men are role models.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:38 am | tom

Dissapointed. Embarrased. Ironic, how a convicted animal killer gets a multi million contract with a team that its name is another animal... the Eagles!
 August 14, 2009 at 9:40 am | M. Minnick 

Michael Vick is a disgusting human being who should still be in jail, scratch that, under the jail.&amp;a professed Christian? Tony Dungy is openly supporting Michael Vick? SHAME ON TONY DUNGY Shame on anyone who has anything to do with Michael Vick-he shouldn&apos;t be allowed to walk around with his head held high or look a decent person in the eye.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:40 am | Doug Snyder, Statesboro, GA. 

Tony,
My question is simple ,Will all government elected officials and their families(President, Senators, Congress) be covered by the same regulations that they are trying to impose on the American people? Or will they elect to keep their current elite service?
 August 14, 2009 at 9:42 am | Shelia 

Persons, including Vic, should be able to have the means of oobtaining honest employment. Vic should consider himself blessed that he has a talent that is wanted. More employers seeing&amp;hearing of Vic hopefully will now consider to give other people whom made mistakes in their past a second chance. Our current work force is not gracious to persons that made simple dumb mistakes in their early adult years. The workspace continue to make it difficult and as a result these people are still paying the price by either having limited (near poverty) imcome or not being able to obtain work. Vic is one of the few that is allowed to recover from a criminal background.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:42 am | judith chandler 

Dawonne
Does everything have to come back to race? This is about an evil person, doing horrific crimes, and, if you see what is happening, he is getting a second chance! I really don&apos;t care if he is purple with pink polka dots; he should not be playing in the NFL.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:43 am | David, VA 

I&apos;d like to comment on the comment by Dawonne Jackson. This is not a race issue and I take exception to the fact that you or anyone else would make it one! I would like to remind you that Sociopaths come in all colors and they should be respected for what they are! Sure, people will watch him play, but probably out of morbid curiosity!
 August 14, 2009 at 9:43 am | Careen 

I am amazed by the disdain that so many of my fellow citizens are showing toward our president and healthcare reform. I have to laugh at some of the reasons people oppose. My favorite, the abortion issue, the last I check abortion is not illegal, and is being paid for with medicaid should one need this service. People need to be informed, instead of listening to sound bytes, and really put their energy to good use instead of making rude, negative and hatefull comments regarding our president. We should also realize that the economic crisis was not brought on by president Obama, but was infact inherited by him, I don&apos;t recall this much opposition when President Bush sent out children to fight an unjust war based on lies and deceit. Let us all be wise and be informed, because at the end of the day it affects us all. Do some research you all.!!!!!!

 August 14, 2009 at 9:47 am | jacqueline ballou 

I believe that it is a&quot;good thing&quot;that Mr. Vick has paid his dues , is remorseful and willing to do what is asked of him to redeem himself..
I agree with M.Lewis. Mr Vick has paid his dues. Sharon is outraged as many will be. Apparently the heavy hammer of the justice system&amp;paying his dues is not enough for her and many others.
I personally find it appauling&amp;hypocritical of so very many in America who places the value of animals {which I love) above the value of the life of any Black man. How loud is the human out crywhen Black men are killed in this Country by rogue Policemen , hung by ropes or drug behind pick up trucks by one of the many clannish hate groups that is allowed to exist unchallenged within the borders of this Country..while Black men are off fighting in other Countries for the freedom of others.
I propose that Black men be placed on the endangered list, placed atleast under the same safeguards as the animals that Vick went to prison for and assign Peta to enforce the rules...Would&apos;nt that be a great step forward for the American consciousness.....
 August 14, 2009 at 9:48 am | Lou Bristol 

SHAME on the Eagles! Shame on Donovan McNabb for his press conference statements. He said he&apos;s gotten by this dog thing. Wow! Does he and everyone out there know the terror dozens of dogs went thru day-after-day, week-after-week, month-after-month, and YES, year-after-year, at the hands of Vick and his friends? Then, when they were thought to be losers, they were tortured and murdered, ironically enough by Vick, a guy who has not actually been a big winner.

If there is a second-chance to be given here, it should come from Virginia Tech, who&apos;s&quot;Family&quot;he was part of but who failed to instill in this guy a repect for God&apos;s creatures OR a respect for the law.
They need to bring him back into their family and teach him a skill(s) that can put a felon to work .

Yeah, that&apos;s the hard one. Who will hire a felon? Maybe depends on the felony. BUT if that&apos;s the case,the NFL should not have EVER reinstated Vick, because basically dog fighting in gambling. The savageness and brutality aside, this guy operated a gambling ring. Think about it Eagles fans every time he&apos;s intercepted or fumbles the ball.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:49 am | james Timpson 

I&apos;m getting both my dogs&quot;Eagles&quot;jerseys, then they can watch every sunday. They love the NFL!
 August 14, 2009 at 9:50 am | Beverly 

Did the dogs Michael Vick destroyed get a second chance? If he enjoys fighting so much send him to Afghanistan where he can do his own personal dog fighting. I too will never be an Eagles fan again.
 August 14, 2009 at 9:52 am | tom 

haha notice how the only people giving up on the nfl or the eagles are girls
 August 14, 2009 at 9:55 am | BJC 

Vince Lombardi would have never hired Vick. Too bad Vick&apos;s new coach does not have coach Lombardi&apos;s standards.
 August 14, 2009 at 10:00 am | P Stevens 

I say,&quot;Congratulations to Michael and the Eagles!&quot;I am so glad there is a team owner who has the courage to do the right thing! Even though I am an animal lover, loving people are my priority. I feel everyone deserves a second chance. We all want that for ourselves. I am a believer that he who is without sin should cast the first stone. Since none of us can say that, then give Michael a chance to resume his career! Why shouldn&apos;t we forgive Michael Vick? Why shouldn&apos;t the NFL? Afterall, what about the NFL player in Florida who, driving drunk, hit and killed someone. Was he banned from the NFL? No! Was the person killed any less important than a dog? No.
 August 14, 2009 at 10:03 am | wayne 

Michael Vick deserves a second chance to play in the NFL. He has served his time in jail for his part in the crime. There are many poeple who have committed murder against another human being in this country before and has and has gotten away without being charged. Some poeple have committed murders against other humans and are not charged until many years later. There are people in this part of the world who love and treat their dogs better than how how they would treat another person of another race. If Michael Vick was in aother part of the world, no one would hear about this dog scandal. Yes, it is wrong, he apologized, he served his time and it is time these people move on with life and let Vick paly football. Many people have committed serious creimes and are re-integrated into society.

Maybe it would have been better if Michael Vicks had kill someone. I think he would have gotten a better deal. They took everything he had and now he has nothing. Just stop talking about this man and let him start a new life. He said he was sorry, People are so ugly and self righteous and so is the media....

In my opinion all athletes are over paid for doing what they love...but Americans love to be entertained and so how much is too much for any athlete?

As for Vick? Well, I&apos;m glad man didn&apos;t make sunshine for he might not let it shine on someone like Vick. Why? Because Americans are a strange group of people: We like to say how we are a nation founded on&quot;Godly&quot;principles, the greatest of which is forgiveness and yet somehow Vick is beyond that forgiveness. Americans like to carry Bibles and go to church on Sunday to learn of this great saviour/hero that gives second chances to the least of us...and yet this ONE GUY somehow finds himself beyond redemption?

Here&apos;s my take: Vick doesn&apos;t need to kiss any&quot;hiney&quot;. He just needs to put his trust in a loving God who knows each of our dirty little secrets but doesn&apos;t put them on blast–choosing instead to give each of us a new start to do and be better than we were yesterday.

Thank you God. Thank you Eagles and thank you Vick for continuing to hold your head above the riff raff fray of hypocrits. I for one, believe in redemption and know that you will not just be a money maker, or NFL great again, but someone who will use your NEW platform to teach others how to be better people and how NOT to treat God&apos;s creatures. They (the animals) were created beautiful and loyal for a reason: They are our better half.

Michael Vick should be doing a mandated year of community service for animal rescue groups instead of training for a star team. He should see what happens to these pit bulls which are tortured, abandoned, rescued and unwanted at shelters. Anyone who can watch the senseless torture and killing of animals should not be immediately rewarded or put in a position of a potential role model for our youth.
 August 14, 2009 at 10:11 am | CS Muncy 

I&apos;d say that for the fans who have a problem with this, they should start tossing dog treats out on the field. The man&apos;s a monster.
 August 14, 2009 at 10:19 am | melinda 

for a christian nation, we are unbelieveably un-forgiving !!
 August 14, 2009 at 10:20 am | Johanna Cremers 

ARE YOU GUYS KIDDING ME???????
Michael Vick is an inhumane pig with no heart who had all the money and fame in the world but STILL had the need to torture and kill defenseless dogs for his perverted pleasure.Human beings, who are capable of doing such unspeakable crimes to our most innocent creatures are evil to the core. That man RAPED dogs with sticks while he had them tied up to a pole to make them more&apos;aggressive&apos;for the fights and for punishment...EXCUSE ME??????????? That is so sick...I cannot even grasp that...
He got a plea deal and admitted to maybe 2% of what he really did...this is the lowest point in the NFL...he should not have the privilege to EVER be an NFL player again and pose as a role model to our youth- what message are you sending out? Are you that desperate????
I am disgusted with the NFL organization and PR machine and promise you that the boycotting has begun. After all- the fans fuel this business and should be heard loud and clear.
America- stop being lethargic on this matter and show them that your heart is in the right place.
 August 14, 2009 at 10:25 am | Linda Shelton 

Good Morning Heidi,

We leave in a sick society, when you have this holier than thou attitude, everyone deserves a second chance. Michael Vick served his time, he made a bad decision, he made a mistake who of us hasn&apos;t made a mistake or a bad decision. Mike was made a poster boy, no one else has had to endure everything he is going through. God forgives us for our sins, man is to lowly to understand forgiveness. I support Michael Vick and pray that he will become whole.
 August 14, 2009 at 10:28 am | Betty Fuller 

I think it&apos;s nauseating that vick has returned to the NFL. Goodell shouldn&apos;t have reinstated him in the first place!! I think the ONLY reason he is sorry is because he was caught&amp;lost money!! If this had never surfaced then he would most likely still be participating in these HEINOUS acts!!!
 August 14, 2009 at 10:28 am | Sara 

Electrocuting, beating, shooting, and killing multiple dogs and making them fight is not a mistake people. A mistake is&quot;oops. I dropped your birthday cake.&quot;What Vick did is criminal, immoral, and shows a lack of conscience, which is the main ingredient of a sociopathic person.

And, no, I will not&apos;Look past&apos;the horror of dog fighting. Anyone who can brush aside this cruelty is uneducated and unfeeling.

Some people do not deserve second chances. Vick is one of them.
 August 14, 2009 at 10:31 am | Shelia 

Which is worse..... No child support paid? One, two, or more abortions? Stealing? Lying? Assault? Fraud? Politicians taking our money to build a bridge to nowhere? Money Laundering? Not paying taxes yet selected as a nominee to be part of the highest cabinet of the land? Adultery? Cheating? Being lazy? Feeding convicted murders for life while kids on the street are hungry? Modern day slavery (not even going to discuss the past). Forcing young girls and boys into a lifestyle of pornography while people they don&apos;t know watch them over the world wide web. Prostitution legal in Nevada and illegal elsewhere? Having kids but too sorry to raise them? No cures for diseases but drug companies pushing harmful medicines? Bailing out companies that should have filed bankruptcy? Cock fighting? Dog Fighting? Horse racing? Grey hound dog racing (do anyone knows what happens to these dogs)? Putting kids on medicines because they are hyper, rather than letting them be kids and go out to play? Kids are a burst of energy. Welfare paying out to&quot;some sorry people&quot;( not all) that will not to do a thing to put 50 cents back into the system? Working people that can not afford their medicines but people on Medicade able to get what ever is prescribed. The list goes on and on......and its all wrong. Not trying to be religious..... but the bottom line is, if God gave Paul, who was responsible for killing many, a second chance, then why the heck we can&apos;t. Paul went on to write most of the New Testament and help spread good in the latter part of his life. If all of us had to pay the rest of our lives for the dirt that we got away with, whether or not anyone knew about it, then we would be hard pressed to even dream or breathe. Like Paul, he (and others like him) should take the opportunity to do good. I really do hope that more employers will give others a second chance. I do not agree with anything he did, but, I rather see him (and others like him that made mistakes or did wrong) playing football than to hear about him performing another illegal act because he could not gain honest employment. If he swanders the second chance, then, let the chips fall as they may.
 August 14, 2009 at 10:32 am | Dot 

I am from Philadelphia and lived here all my life, and and our entire family are Eagles fans and children are members of Eagles Kids Club as well. I am stunned, appalled and it is such a disgrace to the NFL that the Eagles would sign on Mike Vick! He is a convicted Felon and will Always be a Convicted Felon, Not a&quot;Former&quot;convicted Felon as your colleague so mentioned in his recent piece this morning. I am disgusted with the NFL giving criminals a second chance to play Pro! I agree that they should have a second chance in life, but they Do Not Deserve to play for Any Pro team and be rewarded millions of dollars! Is this the kind of role model we want for our children?
 August 14, 2009 at 10:33 am | Bill 

Second chances are for those who make mistakes and regret them. Vick&apos;s actions were repeated over a period of time, not a one time mistake. His remorse appears to be for getting caught, not his crimes and their victims.

He served his time and should certainly be readmitted to society. However, to allow him to be placed in a highly visible, extremely high paying position is a travesty. How may other ex-cons find a job like this upon leaving prison? Let him pound the pavement as a convicted felon and attempt to find a job in this economy.
 August 14, 2009 at 10:34 am | georgene 

I am a avid lover of animals of all kinds what Vick did was horrible but killer of humans get second chances. He got off very easy as do alot of people that commit crimes, Its our system and we as voters need to change it.
I believe if he is truely sorry for his actions and wants people to believe it by giving him a second chance to prove it he should donate part of his earnings to animal rescue that help animals that are mistreated everyday,he could also do commericals for public awareness of mistreatment of animals.There is a lot he can do to show remose for his actions not just sweep it under the rug and forget about it.
 August 14, 2009 at 10:38 am | linda 

It,s sad that there so many people of the same ilk as Michael Vick defending him. They probably think it,s fun to torture animals too. You don&apos;t have to be a nut to have compassion for the suffering of all living things. Character flaws are not mistakes they are in the makeup of the person. You can&apos;t make someone like Vick be a decent person no matter how many chances you give him.I hope all you macho fools enjoy your game!
 August 14, 2009 at 10:39 am | Chris 

Of course all of those individuals that won&apos;t forgive Michael Vick are the people with the most sin and still want to cast the first stone. If President Bush can be forgiven for starting a war under false pretences, then so should Mr. Vick be forgiven. That is why America’s once great moral values have declined. Just turn the other cheek.
 August 14, 2009 at 10:41 am | JoAnne Smith 

Too bad Pete Rose didnt electocute and ruthlessly murder precious dogs. He was convicted of gambling and ousted for LIFE., from his fabulous career. No career was given a second chance for him, no hall of fame, nothing. Why can Vick murder, torture, maime, and do it for fun, and get reinstated in his celebrity status, after only one and a half years of confinement?. How long has Pete Rose paid his dues? 20 yrs? More? Vick needs psychiatric help, anyone that could intentionally make an animal suffer, for their entertainment, should be in counseling for an unstable mind, for a very long time. I would have made him pay 1 million dollars to the animal societies and shelters. per animal that he personally tortured and killed. Also, serve at all the community shelters 1 year for each dead animal body found, and you know if they found 17-- there had to have been 50. Forgiveness is not the issue, this man is dangerous. He needs counseling. Not football. Thats what made him spoiled, bored, and unstable in the first place. Too much money, with no goal of what to do with it. He&apos;s not sorry for the precious animals lives lost, he&apos;s sorry he got caught. He&apos;ll do it again, because his sadistic mind is not fixed. Football is supposed to have young men playing, that our children can look up to, and want to be like. Vick isnt one of those. He can hold his head as high as he wants, but his heart is dark.
 August 14, 2009 at 10:46 am | Albert Rico 

Every new change starts with a first step. Lets give Michael his chance at a new life. He has paid his price to society, so now let us show him the compassion he needs to make this new start.
What is important is not what he has done but how he finishes his life. He will be able to look back at this moment and say it all started here.
We&apos;ve all been in this boat. Who gave you another chance?
 August 14, 2009 at 10:49 am | Cheryl 

People seem to forget - the NFL WAS Michael Vick&apos;s second chance. He had already ran afowl of the law when he was at VA Tech (along with his younger brother). He showed his morals, or lackthereof while at Tech.

When cought, Micheal Vick wasn&apos;t even man enough to admit to his being involved in KILLING dogs that did not perform to his liking.

If Mr. Vick does not perform to high standerds, will he be shot? Tortured? Beaten, kicked?

Shame on you NFL. Shame on you Phil. Eagels.
 August 14, 2009 at 10:58 am | T.K. 

I can&apos;t believe that with all the excellent sports talent in America that the Eagles signed on Vick !! All I can say is that whatever team plays the Eagles this season, whenever Vick is the QB, don&apos;t go for the ball–go for his knees !! TK
 August 14, 2009 at 11:09 am | Rod Brown 

That some of Vick&apos;s defenders can still equate eating beef or chicken with the brutal murder of our family pets shows why it is so important that we not let him go with a slap on the wrist. He did not make a mistake he chose to brutally kill those dogs. I intend to watch every Eagles game while he is still on the team and post a list of advertisers to my facebook account so all of my friends can boycott those advertisers. If you Love dogs or just feel it is time to fight back against the moral decay that seams to be growing in this country please join me in standing up for what&apos;s right.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:18 am | jane Balfour 

Why are you and all the&quot;news&quot;stations spending so much time on the vicious animal abuser Vick? You are glorifying his crimes and holding his deranged behavior up as ok as long as he served a short sentence. I do not believe he is sorry, just sorry he got caught.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:19 am | richard, vancouver 

vick just said that he didnt care about animals and now he does, because other people do... WHAT!? thats the same thing as doing and saying what other ppl tell him to do and say, but has nothing to do with the way he really is... the reality is that he is not a changed person... he is still the same dog killer... and any phsychologist will tell you the same thing; that is, there is no way ANYONE can transform their persona in a span of 2 years, possible over a decade, but 2 years is just not realistic
 August 14, 2009 at 11:20 am | Bill 

All I know is it will be most interesting to see Vick at Browns and facing the dog pound.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:23 am | Larry Nelson-San Francisco 

Why would you offer up so much valuable air time to Vick? There are people dying of AIDS, Breast Cancer, war and every other disease. Normally you are on the money, but this is just ridiculous! Larry Nelson San Francisco
 August 14, 2009 at 11:23 am | Fahim Lodhi 

I think there needs to be a line drawn. I understand that what Vick did was wrong, but a lot of other players have done a lot worse.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:23 am | Paul 

Everyone deserves a second chance...
 August 14, 2009 at 11:23 am | Mark Brennaman 

I do not agree with dog fights, but I am very glad the Eagles are giving Vick a second chance. Vick paid his debt and should be allowed a human life.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:23 am | Lulu 

Vick would like to express his&quot;gratification&quot;.
.

The man can&apos;t even use English properly.

I feel sorry for the Eagles team as they&apos;re going to catch crap by association with Vick.

I&apos;m not much of a football fan....but one game I will be sure to watch will the first game Vick plays in just to see the crowd reaction.

Eagles are a bad team now and they think THIS will help them???
 August 14, 2009 at 11:23 am | Quentin Schroeder 

Why not give him a second chance? Too err is human, to forgive is divine.

Everyone deserves second chance, but I would like true contrition with some involvement with the SPCA or an organization supportive of animals. Please publish if he does do this.

I&apos;m with Chris Rock on this one... Sarah Palin killed a MOOSE and hunted wolves from helicopters and millions of Americans were ready to make her the VP of this country without a any reservations. Now they want to jump on the dog pile of a man who paid his dues??? Okay...
 August 14, 2009 at 11:24 am | Brandon 

Come on! Everybody in their lifetime will need a second chance at sometime in their life, and if you say,&quot;not you&quot;, than you are a liar.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:24 am | Kathy 

I draw the line onthe line on 2nd chances.
No 2nd chances for child molesters, No 2nd chance for animal abusers.
He has actually used the amimal abuse to molest minds of children.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:24 am | Cynthia Lockhart 

It seems that everyone deserves a second chance but in this case it is not true. A person who commit such horrible crimes against animals has it in their blood to continue this kind of torture now and in the future.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:25 am | Dan Scharmer 

Yes, there is NO QUESTION, everyone deserves a second chance. I love how Mike said it today, that it matters very much HOW you climb back and the decisions you make along the way. I know he didn&apos;t make much about it, but it sounds as if Tony Dungy has been helping Mike spiritually, too. He mentioned&apos;Christian forgiveness&apos;. If you know God exists, which I do, and believe in Jesus Christ (Christian Forgiveness), then there is no question. BUT IT DOES IMPLY A COMPLETELY CHANGED LIFE.

Blessings to you...and to Mike and his new journey.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:25 am | Shar 

The dogs that Mr. Vick either tortured and/or killed himself did not get a second chance, neither should he. Once he gets comfortable with his freedom/football I am sure he will forget all that he did.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:25 am | fernando grant 

we all make mistakes why not live and let live, and if micheal vicks doe not learn from the first mistake then shame on him !
 August 14, 2009 at 11:25 am | John Koops 

I have mixed feelings about giving Mr. Vick a second chance at an NFL career. Though I feel we have to give him a second to prove himself and to see if he is sincere. I will hold my opions til after his first season. It the only way as a true Christian to act.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:25 am | Kate F. 

Dogs are thinking, feeling, beautiful creatures. If Vick had tortured children the way he tortured these dogs, there would be no discussion as to whether he should play again or not.
I think it&apos;s disgusting that he is allowed to play again. Yes, he has served his sentence, but that does NOT clear the slate. A convicted sex offender, when released from prison, has certain rules which he or she must abide by.
I am disgusted that the Eagles signed this excuse for a human being. I will not be supporting them in spirit or with dollars as long as he is a part of the team.

I would also like to suggest that the next time he loses a game, he is treated like the losing dogs that he tortured. {...}
 August 14, 2009 at 11:25 am | Nore 

Yes, everyone deserves a break! Give Michael Vick a chance. Don&apos;t be hypocritical....
 August 14, 2009 at 11:25 am | belen nj 

Everyone deserves a second chance... especially he will become a good advocate to respect animals..... he was already sent to jail.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:25 am | Sal 

Why doesn&apos;t it surprise me that Andy Reid would be the one to pick Vic. Look at his kids. This guy isn&apos;t sorry, he misses the salary and the attention. Too easy and too soon.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:25 am | Rickei22 

I think it&apos;s great, he doesn&apos;t have to anwser to any of us, and yet you all still judge him. Why worry about the thorn in my eye when you have one too? Get it together people!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:25 am | donovong 

I think it is great that Vick is being given a second chance by the NFL.

Of course, I also realize there will be a great number of people who disagree.

And a majority of those people will be in a church or synagogue this week fully expecting to be forgiven for their sins and demanding a second chance.

One reason we have so many citizens in prison and becoming repeat offenders is that we only believe in second chances for ourselves and not for anybody else.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:25 am | CJ Smith 

Re: Vick. No second chance for this SOB.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:25 am | Dave 

Of course he deserves a second chance. Thats a great part about living in America. He made some bad decisions and he didn&apos;t run from them like a coward. He admitted his guilt and took his punishment. If Michael Vick does not deserve a second chance, then neither does Donte Stallworth, Pac-Man Jones, or any other player or AMERICAN that has made a mistake.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:25 am | Tony 

Vick should have to fight till the death with Chuck Norris! I do not agree with him being able to play again. What other convict doesn&apos;t have any trouble what so ever getting back into good paying work?

Hide your dogs Philadelphia!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:25 am | Kelli 

Vick not only tortured dogs, he fed kittens and cats to those dogs. Gandhi said a nation can be judged by how it treats its animals.
Today I am ashamed to be living in this country.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:25 am | got2bfree 

Why shouldn&apos;t Michael Vick get a 2nd chance? After all, the President&apos;s green jobs czar is an ex-felon and look at where he is today.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:25 am | Willie 

The man has paid his debt to society. By all means he should be given an opportunity to use his God-given talent again. People commit murder and they are given another chance. Why not let Vick have the same opportunity?
 August 14, 2009 at 11:25 am | Maya Greer 

Yes, I feel he deserves a second chance. As a society we claim that prisoners should be rehabilitated, but there aren&apos;t that many doors open for them to do so. What he did was horrible, but you don&apos;t hear of any punishment for those dog owners that abandoned their pets in hot homes with no food when they were foreclosed. Let the man live his life.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:25 am | Lisa 

No! Criminals especially men who tortured animals, should not have these privileges. No special rules for one criminal. Where is Pete`s second chance?
 August 14, 2009 at 11:25 am | sally 

Why don&apos;t we put him in the ring with a bunch of his dogs and let them decide what to do?
 August 14, 2009 at 11:25 am | Allen 

Its amazing how some people in this country value animals over their fellow human being!!! There are still people walking around today that have done horrible things to other people and never go to jail and have great jobs. Everyone needs to look in the mirror.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:26 am | Sal 

I definitely draw the line at felony&apos;s and any form of cruelty to animals. But it goes to show that if you have money, you can get away with anything. And don&apos;t tell me Vick doesn&apos;t have any money.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:26 am | Tamara 

Good for the Philadelphia Eagles. Our society is set up so if you commit a crime the punishment for that crime is set by the courts. When you have fulfilled your obligation to the courts you should absolutely be allowed a second chance to be a productive member of society, otherwise whats the point.....just lock people up forever. Society needs to welcome convicted felons back into society.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:26 am | Joe 

i do belive that every one deserve a second chance . but why din&apos;t pete rose never got one,and why is that Michael Vik&apos;s got to play againg but Pete rose din&apos;t
 August 14, 2009 at 11:26 am | Ruthie 

What does Michael Vick mean when he says it&quot;is or was part of his culture&quot;? What culture is this? Sounds to me like he is still making excuses even though he said he&apos;s not.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:26 am | Nicole and Kris 

I am a American Pitbull Terrier owner of 3 yrs. I do not believe Michael Vick should have any rights what so ever. I also believe this NFL team is now supporting his actions and will come back on them. Michael Vick should never be able to do anything he loves ever again. To see him on the news now makes me sick. He should be rotting in jail!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:26 am | belen nj 

He was already sent to jail... who r we not to give him a second chance.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:26 am | Griff 

I believe Michael has learned a lot from his time in jail, but I don&apos;t believe in the he&apos;s served his time let him play. Let&apos;s be honest here, he&apos;s getting this chance because he&apos;s got talent. It&apos;s a double standard we have with our famous athletes. I&apos;m a teacher in Iowa. If I committed his crime, would I be given my job back immediately after being released from prison? Would anyone be given their job back after being a convicted felon? No. I hope he has learned and will do many great things, but it still doesn&apos;t sit right with me that all is forgotten so quickly because he is talented.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:26 am | Linda Spitzer 

I draw a line when it comes to Michael Vick. The Eagles should be ashamed of themselves to hire someone as sadistic as Vick. No morals-just do anything to win.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:26 am | Marilyn 

The NFL will not hire a convicted felon to work FOR them so why would they allow a convicted felon to PLAY for them. The double standards exhibited in professional sports these days is shameful.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:26 am | CJ 

Their is a long walk towards forgiveness in any instance. Michael Vicks has paid his dues and is very willing to take the walk.. I say kudos to Mike and remember&quot;EACH ONE REACH ONE AND TEACH ONE!&quot;
 August 14, 2009 at 11:26 am | S. Carothers 

A don&apos;t think that a convicted felon should be permitted to play on ANY national ball team. What kind of an example is this for young people? If there is no educational requirement there must, at the very least, be a judicial requirement.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:26 am | CHM 

I am happy to see Mr. Vick have a second chance. If we don&apos;t like this then that means we don&apos;t like our judicial system. He paid his dues for his crime. The purpose of imprisonment is rehabilitation. If one cannot be rehabilitated, then he/she needs not to be released from prison. I am an animal lover but even so, believe people deserve a second chance as do animals. MV is in a fortunate position as many felons cannot find employment because of the felony on their record so we still have work to do.

Good for Tony Dungy for trying to be a mentor to MV.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:26 am | TC 

Not only do I believe in second chances but for what he had to go through (personal and physical hell) and turned his life around, I&apos;m going to give him a standing ovation when the Eagles come to ATL.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:26 am | sam christopher meister 

everybody deserves a second chance, vicks is no exception, he paid his due and their for he should receive a a second chance at life, but not a third
 August 14, 2009 at 11:26 am | Stephanie Isom-Davis 

Of course he should get a second chance and so should any other&apos;conficted felon&apos;or human being who is genuinely sorry for what they have done and is making an effort to change. God forgives us over and over, so, who are we to&apos;not forgive&apos;someone.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:26 am | Ellen Randall 

Everyone deserves a second chance. What he did was cruel, but if as he says he can do more to help animals than he did to hurt him, that will be good. Children should be taught to respect animals when they are in schools. So many adults mistreat anything if they think they can get away with it without regard to the pain inflicted.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:26 am | herb wiley 

i believe every one deserves a second chance but for millions of dolaars i think i would say any thing even say you are my brother i am 72 years old
 August 14, 2009 at 11:26 am | Anthony 

Definitely!! Michael Vick deserves a 2nd chance. In fact I&apos;ll stand up and declare that his 1st chance should not have been stripped from him. Thanks to PETA and extremist like them a dogs life has become more valuable than a human life... how else can u explain Vike getting 2 years for dogfighting and another nfl player Donte Stallworth only getting 1 year of house arrest for drunk driving and vehicular homicide?? I don&apos;t wanna throw around the word&quot;conspiracy&quot;here but am I the only person who sees something wrong with this scenario??
 August 14, 2009 at 11:26 am | Kay Strickland 

All i have to say is what would JESUS do. He died for all our sin. Beleive and receive it.AMEN
 August 14, 2009 at 11:26 am | Robert 

I think he deserve a second chance ever one made mistake and no one is perfect no one did get a life manual that teacher you what you should do in life
 August 14, 2009 at 11:26 am | Arrive 

If I went to prison, I would hope that I could get my job after paying my dues. Michal Vick will not be working with animals, so he should be free of harassment to get a job at what he does best–that&apos;s football. Leave the poor guy alone and I for one will be cheering the Eagles this fall!

1st the punishment did not fit the crime. 2ndly I want to see him play. And you fans that will never watch the NFL again, Bye! Maybe we&apos;ll see you at the Greyhound track.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:27 am | John J. Pangborn 

I think we must draw the line someplace. I think what Vick has done he needs a few years working at a McDonalds to what it&apos;s like to work hard for a few bucks. I will treat the Philadelphia Eagles as if they do no exist. What are our young people thinking about this?

Thanks
 August 14, 2009 at 11:27 am | david 

Neede to think about the message u just sent to Kids around the US. A message of its ok to kill animals and the NFL will not make u pay for it. Before u say they did no they did not. The federal government Trumps the NFl. So when is the NFL going to punsh VIck for the mass kill of animals and not reward him for that act. NOw the image of the league dropped down again and might not come back up. They just let a killer in the league and another next year in the league. So they dont care about the youth of this country.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:27 am | Tony D 

I think Vick will be able to help those young minority males, that are in the underground dog fighting game. When you grow up and see dogfighting as a normal human function, you dont see it as being bad. Its life experieces that make us different. Maybe more attention needs to given to those that need it. Yes, he should have a second chance, he is a football player not a Prest or President.

Yes, I think everyone deserves a second chance. Jesus gives us second chances everyday, even when we don&apos;t deserve it. It&apos;s about mercy. Give Michael Vick a break. There&apos;s more important things to talk about than this.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:27 am | Linda Louis 

MICHAEL VICK SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN A SECOND CHANCE!!! HE IS A DISGUSTING PIECE OF GARBAGE AND EVERYBODY KNOW THAT THE ONLY REASON HE STOPPED IS BECAUSE HE GOT CAUGHT–PERIOD END!!! NO GREY AREA THERE!!! SHAME ON THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES FOR SIGNING HIM! THEY MAY AS WELL HAVE BEEN THERE RIGHT ALONG SIDE HIM ABUSING, TORTURING AND KILLING THOSE HELPLESS ANIMALS. IN HIS NEWS CONFERENCE VICK SAID&quot;AS HUMANS WE FEAR THE UNKNOWN&quot;YEAH, I CAN IMAGINE THE FEAR AND PAIN HE INFLICTED ON THOSE POOR DOGS. MICHAEL VICK IS A MONSTER!!! SHAME ON COACH REED AND THE EAGLES. I WILL NEVER WATCH AN EAGLES GAME AGAIN AND I KNOW THERE ARE THOUSANDS WHO FEEL THE SAME WAY!!!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:27 am | Kerry 

Torture and killing animals, which is what this man did, is as pretty much as low as you can get. He certainly shouldn&apos;t be let back into the NFL. His ability to be a role model is about as good as OJ Simpsons.

His credibility is destroyed. His comments at the press conference were rehearsed. He doesn&apos;t care about what he did, he doesn&apos;t have remorse, there was no emotion in his responses, and I for one am disgusted that he even has his freedom. He is a repugnant human being.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:27 am | Michael Vash 

Yes, he should be given a second chance and his future actions will indicate how sincere he is,.

And No... serial killers, rapists, child molesters and the like should never see the light of day,

Tony, I think the key word in your question is&quot;second&quot;. Everybody deserves a Second chance, and Michael Vick has paid his debt to society, so why not allow him to move on with his life and put to use the gift that God has given him which is football?
 August 14, 2009 at 11:27 am | Brighton 

Everyone is asking weather Vick should get a second chance, but did the dogs he tortured and beat get a second chance? I think it is horrifying that the NFL would allow him to play again, and I for one no longer support the Eagles. This man is disgusting and arrogant, and not only should he not be allowed to play professionally again, but the spotlight on him needs to be turned off.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:27 am | Bobbie P 

Kudos to the Eagles! They madd a common sense decision. People are quick to judge; however, our religious beliefs shows compassion and forgiveness. I think he will be one phenomenal asset to the Eagle and look forward to watching him play. Tell al the na-sayers to&quot;don&apos;t watch!&quot;
 August 14, 2009 at 11:27 am | Kelly 

Why should Michael Vick NOT play? Out of many of the NFL players that make far worse mistakes, Michael Vick is the only that actually paid his debt society. The NFL often has a culture of domestic violence. As a society, are we saying it is okay to beat and abuse women? This is not diminishing the disgusting action that Michael Vick engaged in, but it is important that we accept domestic violence, drugs, and even murder of people (Ray Lewis anyone)? Perhaps, we should look at a Vick as a model of what we should WANT in the prison system. A person does their time, pays their debt to society, and then, comes out prison to become again producing members of society.

PS: Why is the media not covering Ben Roethlisberger and his alleged rape?
 August 14, 2009 at 11:27 am | l 

Great news for Vick, I still cant believe he is a felon&amp;spent time in jail, for dog fighting. People wake up , dogs are food in certain places in the world. I think organizations like PETA need to be stopped, pets are property. You can buy them, you cant buy a life, or a second chance!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:27 am | Eric 

I think he should be seen as having paid... if not then our justice system is hypocritical and terms should be more strict or crimes deemed less problematic.

In other words, if we as a society see him as not rehabilitated, we are obliged to change the system to satisfy our thirst for blood!

Or we can just accept that the punishment fit the crime... and forgive and forget.

And for god&apos;s sake quit talking about it!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:27 am | Cornell 

Yes Vick deserves another chance and congratulations to the Eagles they have improved thL as a contender.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:27 am | Chuck, Tampa Fl 

It&apos;s simple for me.
I will never watch an Eagles game or purchase any product from a sponsor of such games. The dogs he had killed never got a second chance, Vick should not either.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:27 am | Angie 

What Michael Vick did was horrible. But I think during the press conference today he took the blame for his actions like a man. Who are we to judge someone else&apos;s repentance? True repentance is between a man and his maker. Let him live his life. Let him continue to thrive in a career he is good at. The death sentences he imposed on those dogs are already too many death sentences. Let&apos;s not sacrifice this man and his career on the altar of our own self-righteous judgments. He did the crime, he did the time. It&apos;s time to quit analyzing every move he makes and checking for true remorse. He&apos;s got the second chance, now let&apos;s see what he does with it.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:27 am | robert 

Would he be getting a high-income contract if he were a paroled child molester? There is also a subculture that tolerates that. A man that has it in him to torture and kill animals may deserve a chance at freedom, but does not deserve to be rewarded with social prominence or the position of a role model for influenceable sports fans.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:27 am | Steffanie 

It&apos;s almost tamer to call Vick a convicted felon than to just refer to his crime. I can&apos;t believe this man has a job, let alone a reinstated status in sports entertainment.
As far as second chances, remember the saying,&quot;once a dog, always a dog?&quot;Likewise, once a dog killer, always a dog killer. Whether he&apos;s a changed man or not, his past should haunt him–certainly for the rest of his career, but also for the rest of his life.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:27 am | Dave 

As a business owner, I wouldn&apos;t hire anyone convicted of the things Michael Vick has been convicted of. I believe in second chances, but his repeated actions demonstrate a severe lack of morality in general- not just a momentary lapse in judgement. I don&apos;t need anyone like that working for me.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:27 am | rick in virginia 

Yes, I believe that everyone deserves a second chance. Also, please clarify that Michael Vick was convicted of Racketeering and not dog fighting himself.

It&apos;s amazing these days where we care more about animals than people. It was not that long ago that Marv Albert was guilty of Sodomizing a young woman and it seemed that no one protested against him being back in broadcasting.

We have convicted child molesters throughout our communities today - why isn&apos;t PETA protesting against them.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:27 am | JD, Willis, Texas 

Vick is a dog killer. While I can see giving second chances to people, the
Philly club owners must be crazy to waste time and money on a such a cruel person. There are certainly better qualified players out there. He will draw horrible public reaction every game he attends. The issue will never disappear.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:27 am | David A Bailey 

Michael Vick deserves a second chance because it is the right thing to do. He made a mistake in gambling with dogs lives but it is an entertainment and/or sport in many communities. I can say this and I am a dog owner who treat my animals quite differently. Therefore, give him another chance and if he fails then it will be his fault. By the way, I am a casual football fan.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:27 am | Dan 

Under NO circumstances will I EVER watch or support an Eagles game EVER. I am a huge football fan and have been for years. The fact that this man can just pick-up where he left off is discusting. The fact that an organization, as the Eagles, condones this behavier tells me and the public that they are OK with the brutal torture and killings of inicent animals. Why don&apos;t they let Vick torture an Eagle live during a game. I mean, he obviously knows how to do it, so why not? Michael Vick should take every penny he makes and donate it to the SPCA or some type of animal charity to show that he is trying to&quot;change&quot;and deserves a&quot;second chance&quot;. The Eagles are a disgrace to American sports!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:27 am | christine russell 

Vick should have proven himself to the community through community service for a signigicant period of time before even being considered to play football again. He would SAY or DO anything to get back in football while he still has the high earning potential–it is all he knows and is qualifed to do. I am sorry to see any team take him at this point in time–how long has he been out of prison! That said, I hope he is sincere and concentrates his efforts on mentoring youths who are on the wrong path INSTEAD of concentrating on football–it is a much more worth while cause.

When I first heard the news, I was split down the middle. I believe in giving second chances, but I am also an avid animal lover. What has tipped my opinion in favor of the signing is the involvement of Tony Dungy, a man who is so well-respected as both a coach and a man.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:28 am | Parthenia 

Yes, I&apos;m glad the Eagles have signed Michael Vick! I believe he has paid his dues. I&apos;m happy he got a second chance and I believe he&apos;ll make us proud of him again.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:28 am | Shirin 

I am sick to my stomach, I am a die hard fan of NFL as my family and friends, to see such a MONSTER be given a second chance is just unforgiveable. Why not give Manson a second chance and have him come back to society? I am not any kind of PETA or any animal welfare fanatic, BUT WHEN I SAW THE PICTURES AND STORIES OF WHAT THIS MAN DID WITH HIS OWN HANDS WITH THESE DOGS, THERE IS NO REFORM. MONEY IS THE MOTIVATION OF THIS TEAM AND IT&apos;S SO UNFORTUNATE. SHAME ON THEM. I&apos;M NO LONGER GOING TO BE AN NFL FAN. THEY JUST LOST MY SUPPORT AS WELL AS MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:28 am | Larry Rollins 

Vick deserves a second chance, he did his time and paid his dues. PETA doesnt comment on the people in the south that shoot deers as a sport, Animals are animals deers can&apos;t protect themsleves either. Vick deserves more of a second chance then Adam Pacman Jones, he got 3 chances and nobody says anything about that. He is doing things to prove he&apos;s a better person to say he doesn&apos;t deserve a second chance is wrong. Congrats Mike Vick you deserve your chance
 August 14, 2009 at 11:28 am | Barbara Chapman 

Of course, Michael Vick should be given a&quot;second chance.&quot;He has served time for his offense. Others, including sports figures, have killed humans, raped, and done other offensive acts. They have all received less condemnation than Michael. Do the people in ths country care more for the welfare of dogs than they do of humans?
 August 14, 2009 at 11:28 am | Judith Curtis Brown 

I would like to clarify a point regarding Mr. Vick. He is now an EX-felon. He has served his time, and, thus, paid his debt to society. He definitely deserves a second chance.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:28 am | Jamee 

If Michael Vick is truly remorseful for his mistakes, why doesn&apos;t he work for the Humane Society for a couple of years for a much lesser salary than an NFL player!!!!!!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:28 am | Patrick Harris 

Tony:

I absolutely think M.V. deserves a second chance.
He&apos;s paid for his indiscretion with jail time. As
Shakespeare said,&quot;the quality of mercy is not strained&quot;.
He&apos;s a young man who made a mistake and should not
have to have this hang over him like the sword of Damocles.

 August 14, 2009 at 11:28 am | kellykitchenspr 

I hope Michael Vick gets the help he needs. How quickly we forget that Jeffrey Dahmer started by killing animals. But that did not satisfy his lust for the thrill of the kill.

Just because Michael Vick is a good football player doesn&apos;t mean he doesn&apos;t have the possibility of having that same urge. I would hope that his training would be in empathy building instead of training with his team.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:28 am | Carole 

I believe in 2nd chances and I think Vick sounds sincere. I have to wonder where he would be had he not got caught..........
 August 14, 2009 at 11:28 am | John Kelley 

when you were asking if people who torture and kill should get another chance, were you referring to michael vick or the bush and the republicans
 August 14, 2009 at 11:28 am | william crofoot 

In my opinon michael has done the unforgettable. There is no way he deserves to play football again. I do understand he will be a fantastic addition to the eagles. I look at this as a plus for the eagles and a great chance (not deserved ) for michael.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:28 am | pelican 

Let&apos;s see Pete Rose cannot be installed in Hall of Fame

Uh, OK I get it now!!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:28 am | Ron in Oregon 

A&quot;second chance&quot;is not deserved, it has to be earned. What has Michael done to have earned a&quot;second chance&quot;?
 August 14, 2009 at 11:28 am | Tony G 

Yesterday I thought that he should not be allowed to resume his role in the NFL. After watching his news conference, I do believe he regrets his actions in the past and is looking to get his life back on track. I think it is imperative that he plays an active role with the ASPCA and/or PETA and that he helps educate young kids the perils of making the wrong decisions
 August 14, 2009 at 11:29 am | Linnea 

I am happy for Vick. Yes, he did wrong and he paid for it. So isn&apos;t he entitled to a second chance. Yes, I believe he does. The point of going to prison is for you to reflect on why you got there in the first place. Let the man live his life. He knows he will forever be labeled as a&quot;Dog Killer&quot;let him be. Allow him like we allow others who makes wrong decisions the chance to make it up.

I look forward to watching this season and I wish Vick the best.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:29 am | Dan. G 

The question of rather someone deserves second chances where someone else doesn&apos;t is a hard line to follow. In Vick&apos;s case, he&apos;s served his punishment given by the federal law and separately dealt with the punishments given to him by the NFL. In society, a man would now be free to do as he wishes. In Vick&apos;s case, he&apos;ll be labeled by his previous mistakes for the rest of his life. He will face more judgment then 99.9% of any other convict of the same crime. Why not give him the chance to show the world that he&apos;s a changed man. Because his case is so publicly involved, he needs something to get back any chance at a normal livelihood.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:29 am | Newport News Native 

All this attention and disapproval on Vicks return has everything to do with race. If it was Tom Brady there wouldn&apos;t be any issue. Why do you all hide behind morals to show your hatred. Look at Ben Rothlesburger, there no big issue about his return after what he did. I&apos;m not an Eagle fan but I hope that they win the superbowl Just as Obama won the White House.Go Vick! Go!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:29 am | coco 

I think everybody needs to be given a second chance but please do not let him be a role model for our children. These kids will think that it is ok to torture dogs, do some jail time and come right back into the spot light.
This is all about business–I did not see any sign of remorse in his statement. Get him out of public places!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:29 am | Ty 

Look, there are things in life that are condoned that are seriously swept under the carpet...the thing is if a person is serious about doing a complete 360 after they have done wrong then Yes they deserve a second chance....I myself have felt the pain of doing wrong and trust me my second chance will not go invein cause of how i learned to humble myself to commit to doing whats right so my felony does not look as bad. I am so Proud of you Micheal Vick for steppin into the role of truely becoming a man and to the state of Philly.....you have truely stepped up to the plate big time and i can look at the people of Philly in a different view from what i saw before. I look forward to giving my support to the Eagles from this day foward!!!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:29 am | Larry T. 

Yes, Vick deserves a second chance. Now tony if he wasn&apos;t black we wouldn&apos;t be talking about it. What about the largest dog fighting ring that was raided in Texas 2-3 months ago. Who are they, where is PETA now. Historically Mexican and White males fight dogs, but the only two people convicted are black and football players. Vick the most popular.

I know people who&apos;ve tortured and/or killed PEOPLE who didn&apos;t spend the amount of time Michael Vick spent in jail. Every month I hear about people being released from prison, who after serving 20 and 30 years, were found not guilty. Of course he should be allowed to play and earn a living.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:29 am | Clint Songer 

Where would any of us be without a chance to redeam ourselves from our failings. I hope Michael Vick&apos;s repantance is real, and time will be the best judge of that. Welcome back to the NFL Michael.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:29 am | BRANDY TAYLOR 

I think Michael Vick deserves a second chance. Everyboby is not perfect in this world and we as a ppl need to leave the judging up to God. Im sure the ppl who are saying NO to a second chance have done things in their life time and either got a second chance or wish they would have gotten one. As long as he knows what he did was wrong and is now trying to turn his life around, then YES he deserves a second chance.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:29 am | Laura 

There is NO WAY this man (Vick) should be given a second chance in the form of a high-pay signing contract with a pro-ball team! He admitted to and was convicted of torture and death of living creatures. Our laws protect humans and animals from this type of person and signing him on the Eagles only rewards him.
If any&quot;second chance&quot;is given, it should be in the form of a job for the next 10 years, working in a local shelter and raising money for the protection of the animals he didn&apos;t get a chance to murder!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:29 am | Jamison 

Of course he should get a second chance. Michael Vick has payed his debt to society. In this country, prison is designedbilitate. He plays football for a living, and he should be able tol do that.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:30 am | Suzie 

I think it is about money and winning. Maybe Vick can donate some of his salary to the humane society. Second chances are important I just hope he really is sorry for what he did. Whether we like it or not football players are role models .
 August 14, 2009 at 11:30 am | rick in virginia 

note to everyone comparing this to child abuse.....A DOG is NOT A CHILD. To believe so is a disgrace to humanity.

 August 14, 2009 at 11:30 am | MrB 

I&apos;m happy for Mr Vick to be able to find employment again. Now he has the chance to show the world how remorsefull he really is and prove he can be a productive member of our society.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:30 am | Robert Rucker 

Hmmm. America hung blacks from trees with no remorse, no regrets, no accountability and most important no time served. People are upset about Vick when were consider less than dogs. Everyone deserves a second chance even America for slavery that deems itself irreversible in the eyes of many. It is clear to me that he asked God for his forgiveness. America shoul do the same.

 August 14, 2009 at 11:30 am | William CJ 

I&apos;d rather hang out with a dog fighter/killer, than a man who abandons his children, family, and doesn&apos;t pay child support. As we know, there are millions of those men, at every level in society. I wonder how many of the&quot;fans&quot;complaining about Vick in Philly, don&apos;t take care of their children. Dog fighting is a only a few steps worse than growing veal.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:30 am | Carla from Atlanta 

Tony,

I am so glad that Michael Vick has been signed by the Eagles. This man definitely deserves a second chance. I love dogs but enough already there are felons and batterers still playing! He has paid his debt to society and lost everything. All in all, I can&apos;t wait to see him on the field and although no one is saying it , Mike is going to fill a heck of a lot a seats where ever he goes! Brilliant move having Tony Dungee as his mentor. Thanks to Philly for stepping up, the NFL is going to have a great year with Mike back on the filled.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:30 am | richard, vancouver 

dungy boasts about the various ppl he helps re-enter society after being released from prison... thats great, but there is a huge difference between vick and the others... likely, the average convict had limited choices and is a result of a downtrodden life; whereas, vick had UNLIMITED choices and had a GREAT life as a superstar... he didnt have to run the dog killing ring... he didnt have to torture dogs... thousands/millions loved him... the reality is that vick&apos;s real and twisted personality is clearly demonstarted by the dog fighting... i wouldnt be surprised to learn that vick is actually psychotic and requiures REAL psychological help, not a football
 August 14, 2009 at 11:30 am | Mike 

Yes, speaking for myself who has had not only a second but a third chance in my life.... I do think everyone should be given a second chance and this applies to Mr. Vick. He clearly still has a lot to contribute to sport and society and we should forget and forgive. He has served his time and seems changed by his experience.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:30 am | Charles Murray 

Regardless of what you think about the animal cruelty, the fact remains that the dog fighting was related to gambling, which was related to money laundering...well you get the picture. Is this the NFL standard? As a resident of Virginia who lives close to Vick&apos;s&quot;hood&quot;I can tell you that he was and has been involved in a lot more than killing dogs or throwing his kid&apos;s pet into the ring....If he is so contrite, why did he make a deal with the Humane Society that would limit the attendees and the media at his&quot;lectures&quot;...why aren&apos;t the reporters asking him about the session he had in Atlanta several days ago where 55 people were&quot;invited&quot;and he was whisked away in a limo.? This isn&apos;t about second chances...it&apos;s about money and winning. Shame on the Eagles and the Commissioner!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:30 am | pilgrim1 

Okay. Enough! He killed some dogs. He was wrong. He was convicted of his crimes and did his time. LET IT GO! This man lost millions upon millions of dollars (to include endorsements), went to prison and they still want to punish him. What do you want to do? Cut his arms off! M. Stewart committed crimes and went to prison and came back out as if nothing happened and is making the same money she made before she went to prison. Baseball players use drugs, get fined and suspended, lie to Congress and are back on the field playing baseball. Why is the Michael Vick situation any different? Some people have no life at all!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:30 am | Hal Maas 

You’re right when you say the Eagles’ signing Michael Vick is more about making them a Super Bowl contender than about giving an offender a “second chance”. Michael says he WILL help the Humane Society – then how about having him build equity toward that goal by working for two, three, five years actually building needed animal shelters or actually caring for animals himself. After he’s actually PROVEN he’s serious and not just saying the right things – THEN let him back into the NFL. Problem is: by then he might be too old, his skills too diminished to actually warrant that “second chance”.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:30 am | DeeDee 

I&apos;m horrified by what Vick did. I cannot imagine hurting an animal, but what I&apos;m learning is that there are parts of the country where dogfighting, rooster righting, etc is acceptable. I cringe when I hear these stories. But as a Christian I believe in redemption. I don&apos;t want Vick to go into hiding. I want him out front where we can see him and provding a real example of contrition. If Michael Vick can save one more dog than he hurt, I might actually tolerate him remaining in the NFL.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:30 am | Johnny In Salem 

Michael Vick may be entitled to A second chance, but quarterbacking in the NFL is a privilege which should not be restored to him. It shows how missplaced our priorities are when we reinstate a sports figure regardless of his past conduct simply because he is talented. It sends a horrible message to our youth.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:30 am | Louise 

Vick does not deserve a contract form the NFL. The NFL is sending a signal that you can be a convicted felon and be rewarded when you get out of prison. I think that it is disgusting to employ a person that did such cruel thing to God&apos;s creatures. I will never watch another NFL game again. The NFL is all about the money, and they have no morals or values.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:30 am | Deborah 

Are we *Nuts*????? Does money speak that loud that we quite our conscious in the desire for entertainment?

Placing a man, who committed such horrific crimes back into a spotlight of Privilege isn&apos;t appropriate.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:30 am | Brittany 

I think everyone deserves a second chance...at freedom, not at their previous lifestyle. What kind of example does it set for the children of our country when an athlete they admire commits a crime, does his time, and then returns to the same&quot;glorious&quot;lifestyle? Fair or not, celebrities and professional athletes are held to higher standards and they should be upheld. It is despicable that he is returning to professional football and the limelight.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:31 am | Asim 

Hi Tony:
As an African man in this country, I don&apos;t believe Michael Vick should have ever been put in prison. This is a white/Black issue because when has another White male been put in prison for killing dogs. White males murder Black men, and don&apos;t go to jail, at all. Finally, some people i.e., China, eat cats and dogs while White American sicked dogs on our people. So let us talk about this. White really love dogs better than they like Africans. They are trulely a strange group of people.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:31 am | Evette 

I love Michael Vick and think he is the greatest football player ever. He deserves a second chance and the Eagles will rock this year with him on their team. Go Vick!!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:31 am | Ramona P. 

Yes, Micheal deserves a second chance at his career. His animal mistreatment had nothing to do with his career. However, he should never be allow to have another animal in LIFE. Now, Micheal does&quot;OWE&quot;Aferican American / Blacks an appology!!!! Dog fighing and Animal Muder!!! is not a part of our&quot;Culture&quot;.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:31 am | Erika 

I believe people do deserve a second depending on what that person did. The only reason Michael Vick is receiving so much negative play about what he did is cause he is a professional football player. No one pays attention to an average person as much as they are paying to him and all the negative talk they give him. He commited a crime, paid his time, and now he is trying to start over. Just let the man be.

I was a wild when I was young, did time not once but twice. Did not learn on my first trip but even then I was never given a second chance I guess because I did not have any special talent that would make me or anyone else money. Thats what all this is really about. i have been turned away from jobs for that reason alone I cant even get a job at hope hospice even tho I have been clean for over 15 yrs. No chance here, I still have to claw my way thru life

Micheal Vick is a monster! shame on Philly for hiring him or anyone whoever thought about this. As a die hard fan of the NFL, they just lost my support. SHAME ON THE PHILLYS!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:31 am | mildred 

I am so very proud that this great man can be given a second chance and anyone, human who thinks differently has never committed any mistakes. all the stone throwers are lairs and haters and they are the very ones who will reap what they sew. I am Proud of the NFL and I definitely support the team for this excellent choice I hope they win the Super Bowl / Yesterday is gone tomorrow is the future and today is for now and for now he has changed for the good. God Bless the excellent athlete my Prayer is that he does even better! BE GREAT MIKE VICK you were born for it.

I feel that Michael Vick has paid his dues, yes he made a mistake but tell one person that has not ever made a mistake, had poor judement,etc, he needs to see that he has a second chance and he just needs to be the best that he can be. I havealways liked Michael and he has a wonderful talent and he needs

to step up ans show what he is made of now, thank god for Tony Dungee he is great .

I don&apos;t believe that he deserves a second chance. How many dollars was he signed for? Will he donate to the ASPCA? ( And not just a few dollars!) Is he donating time to a local Humane Society? He did say in his statement that he will, but is he donating time now?

Water boarding to prisoners and Electrocution to dogs, are they not the same inhumane treatment.

And why is Michael Vicks given a second chance and Pete Rose not? There is a difference between killing and gambling.

OJ is where he beloongs!

Tony, You ought to go back to anchoring the news and avoid the sanctimonious blather you espouse everytime I turn on the CNN channel.Michael Vick, like so many that have made mistakes in their own lives, deserves a chance. His debt to society is paid and after he throws the first touchdown, Phily fans will forget he was ever in prison. His committment to assist in animal rights in the future will be judged on its own merit. Leave the guy alone. How about commending Dungy, the Eagles and coach for having the compassion, belief and understanding to assist a man who was reduced to very depths of humiliation by his own foolish conduct.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:31 am | Irene 

Tony....I think most people do deserve a second chance...IF they are truly sorry for what they&apos;ve done. I get the feeling from Michael Vick&apos;s comments that he is sorry that he UPSET so many people with what he did......but I don&apos;t feel HE is sorry for what HE DID to those poor animals. He referred to what he did as being illegal.......how about it being immoral and just plain cruel!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:31 am | sean boston 

re vick,look the guy did his time and what a lot of people dont get is that there is a sub culture that exisits that allow this behavior for instance champion boxer roy jones raises cock fighting roosters and some would say that too is bad but to some not so much so i think he can acted as a positive role model if he plays his cards right, good luck mike.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:31 am | Cheryle 

I am very happy for Mr. Vick. He did his time for what he did, now lets move on. Mr. Vick did not corner the market for dog fighting, lets bring everyone to justice who is continually having dog fights. When Vick got arrested, the media, including, CNN interviewed several people who said that it was there hobby and they enjoyed having dog fights.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:31 am | Angel_IQ 

Give him another chance! His apology seemed sincere, he didn&apos;t hide behind excuses, and he&apos;s now committed to helping animals and raising awareness. Let&apos;s give him a chance both to play again but also a chance to do some good.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:31 am | Carolyn Stewart 

Michael Vick committed a horrific crime, but I do believe he deserves a second chance. Michael will live the rest of his life with the knowledge of this crime. As far as being a role model, I think he can eventually do this. What about the drugs, DUIs, illicit affairs that others have committed? These certainly are not role models. As a Christian, we have to forgive in order for us to be forgiven. I am proud of the NFL and Philadelphia Eagles for giving Michael Vick this opportunity to redeem himself and prove that he is remorseful and that he will be a great athlete once again. GO EAGLES!!!!!!! I am now a new fan. I lived near VA Tech df\uring Michael&apos;s awesome career there and will follow him once again.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:32 am | Josh 

I can&apos;t beleive the NFL allowed him to come back at all. He was underpunished in the first place. Look at some of the lower class citizens who have been charged with things smaller then this and then compare them to vick&apos;s punishment its pathetic in comparison. I know if it had of been me I would still be in jail. Their are even two underage kids in Harlan, ky right now facing felony charges now for throwing a dog off a bridge. I gurantee even and them being children their charges will be far worse then vick&apos;s. Just a show of how messed up society is now. All because vick has money and is famous he gets off easy compared to some. Vick says he can&apos;t make it on a construction worker&apos;s salary. There are people who do it every day. He has to adjust not the world adjust to him. His punishment shouldn&apos;t be lifted because he doesn&apos;t want to adjust his lifestyle. I personally will never watch the NFL again now. Nor will I allow my kids or any of my family to watch it while I&apos;m around.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:32 am | Kim in Richmond, VA 

In this world of hate, pain and suffering, I still believe in the redemption of man!! As a Christian, we must forgive if we are to be forgiven ourselves.God commands that. Yes what he did was aweful..I have a pit bull and could not imagine anyone harming my pet..but I think that unless we are able to forgive, we are really no better than the animals that we care for. To those who may be angry at this man trying to redeem himself, unless you have a heaven or hell to put him in, you are in no position to judge...only God can do that. Is his remorse real...I think so but only God knows for sure. I pray that Michael Vick will prove his critics wrong, be a role model and show the world that God is still in charge!!!!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:32 am | tim in nashville 

This man tortured animals to death for fun and profit. He is only sorry he got caught. Even today notice that his verbiage is&quot;other people care about the health of animals&quot;. If he could, he&apos;d be out&quot;relaxing&quot;in that hellpit on his property right now.

He did however, miss being payed millions of dollars a year to play a game. So did his entourage. So.. coach him in what to say, choreograph an apology written for him, force feed it to a (hopefully gullible) public, and get that cash flowing. Obviously the Eagles have already calculated the cost of lost ad revenue, etc. After all, sure he tortures animals to death for personal amusement, but.. he throws a football reeeaaally far, so how bad could he be?
 August 14, 2009 at 11:32 am | Jim Preston 

Joe Public with a felony conviction has a very hard time getting a job anywhere! This guy will be making millions agian. The only reason he&apos;s sorry is that he got caught. Had he not he&apos;d still be doing it. I find it shameful that you give him air time.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:32 am | Sherrie 

Why give Vick a second chance? His was a violent crime againest animals. Did they give Pete Rose a second chance at his chosen profession? Or was it because he wasn&apos;t a person of color or that his crime wasn&apos;t violent enough?
 August 14, 2009 at 11:32 am | Sisley Dougherty 

I believe that there are lines that you do cross, even though everybody deserves a second chance. A person that loves to watch dogs killing each other, for the sport of it, and profits by it, is sick and twisted inside, and will remain that way for most of their life
 August 14, 2009 at 11:32 am | Dave 

Vick paid the price for his illegal actions but yet will be paying the rest of his life like the rest of all felons. If our society cannot find forgiveness in our hearts we are a doomed people! Put out a helping hand and not a fist. Give him a chance. If he fails there is only one to blame.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:32 am | Stacia Banks 

I truely believe that this is a great opprotunity that Michael Vick is receiving. These are the opprotunities that being an American is all about. The ability to pick yourself up and have the same opprotunity as everyone else to do something right. I also just want to say who are we to judge him. There are no saints that are making these comments about him not getting a second chance I assure you. It is amusing however that a person that would make these comments would probably wouldn&apos;t air there dirty laundry or being even important enough that someone would want to hear them. You have people that are stars that are killing people and only getting DUI charges and very little timed served and yet we are the ones to judge. Michael Vick has done wrong, okay, now he has a second chance. What I will just want to say to him is: He is in the radar now so don&apos;t mess up because third chances are rarely given.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:32 am | Tabot 

Everyone needs a second chance...PETA has yet to nail anyone on the cross for Horse Racing or any other use of animals.CNN should take some time to research Horse Racing and the death toll or injury list. Im not advocating Vick&apos;s actions but merely stating the discrepancies.....
 August 14, 2009 at 11:32 am | Jeffery Lions 

I am shocked and disgusted Mr Vick is being let out of jail. There are people in jail for victimless crimes that serve longer sentences. He should have received a sentence of every lifetime each dog would have lived had he not tortued and killed them. Example: An average dog would have lived for 10 years so Mr Vick&apos;s sentence for one dog should have been 10 years. Instead he gets a slap on the hand. In addition, all the dogs he fought and abused suffered incredible pain that he can&apos;t even imagine. He&apos;s a serial abuser. He should be in jail for life. This is not a mear second chance he&apos;s given. I don&apos;t know how many dogs he&apos;s killed or tortured but he&apos;s had many chances only to fail. Would you want this guy living next to you if you had dogs or children?
 August 14, 2009 at 11:32 am | marianne flanagan 

No way should he be given a second chance. When you sign those million dollar contracts you have a moral responsibility to those people who look up to you. Letting him play again clearly tells those young people it&apos;s o.k. to be violent, kill animals. be involved in a culture of violence, becaause if you say you&apos;re sorry, you can play again. That is disgusting-he should still be in jail.. I hope the Eagles have lousy luck as long as they have that miserable excuse for a human being on their team- and I hope that includes boycotting their games and merchandise.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:32 am | Alexis 

Yes he has done his time, and should be able to move on. However, that does not mean he should be placed in an elevated position in society. As an NFL player he gains more than a second chance, he gets a higher salary than most Americans; he gets privilege and celebrity, etc. While he was punished, he is now being rewarded. There are many deserving athletes out there who did not perform and tolerate acts of cruelty on innocent creatures. In his interview he said he did not know that people cared about animals before. How could anyone be that oblivious? Whether or not people care, what about the pain and fear the animals suffered? Did he not notice their screams and injuries? How can we put someone so cruel and insensitive in a position of power? It is very disappointing.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:32 am | Aaron 

I was no fan of mike vick before he went to jail , he made a huge mistake and pay for it dearly he payed for his crime we watch Him fall and now it&apos;s time for him to just get a shot at rise
 August 14, 2009 at 11:32 am | RM 

I am sick of hearing MV made a mistake. A mistake is when one goes through a stop sign. Killing dogs, teaching them to fight is not a mistake. Shame on the NFL. Shame on the Eagles.

And oh yeah! Football... it breeds aggression and violence. It&apos;s like when the Army trained me to kill and then wonders why I can&apos;t adjust to&quot;normal&quot;society. The country uses us for its entertainment and security, but then acts as if we&apos;re lepers when we get face to face.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:33 am | Jim - Atlanta, ga 

I&apos;m happy for Michael Vick. I&apos;ve forgiven him just like I&apos;ve forgiven the PETA people for pouring paint on people with mink coats. If God forgives who am I not to forgive. I am now a converted Philly fan, and I can&apos;t wait for the first Philly game like many others who eagerly await the fall games. I&apos;m pushing for the networks to show more of the Philly games this year. This will certainly boost their ratings.

 August 14, 2009 at 11:33 am | longboy 

Every one says Mr. Vick should not play football and make a living again. It&apos;s wrong for what he was convicted of, but he done his time and now trying to move forward. Know one talks about the human life players take when they drink and drive. What animals are more important than humans. Get over it and remember, if you don&apos;t like the program, change the channel. GO EAGLES
 August 14, 2009 at 11:33 am | Wanda 

Yes, Michael deserves a second chance. He broke the law, and he paid the penalty, which was too stiff. Someone of a different persuasion could have commmitted the same offense or worse, and he would have been given a slap on the wrist. So hurray for the Philadelphia Eagles and Michale! You can&apos;t keep a good man down!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:33 am | Eileen 

No second chance for Vick!!! Definitely not. He brutalized and murdered those poor innocent helpless dogs. If the victims have no opportunity for a second chance why should Michael Vick be given one. The day you can bring those dogs back and give them a happy life is the day I would give Vick a second chance. He stinks–let him get a real job and see how he likes it.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:33 am | RONNYE DUNN 

MICHAEL VICK HAS NOT ADDRESSED THE ISSUE ABOUT BEING a liar. even his family lied for him. he is not only a animal abuser, he is a moraless liar. he said he was not guilty- he said he was a animal lover and after he was arrested, he said he found jesus. PLEASE, I HOPE EVERY ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVIST IN THIS COUNTY IS OUTSIDE THE STADIUM OF EVERY FOOTBALL GAME THE EAGLES PLAY. TONY DUNGY IS A TRUE CHRISTIAN MAN AND I APPLAUD HIS HEART. TONY CAN FORGIVE MICHAEL BUT I AND THOUSANDS OF OTHERS CANNOT. MICHAEL VICK HAS IN NO WAY REDEENED HIMSELF BUT GOD IS STILL WATCHING.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:33 am | Sunnyleo 

I believe we should draw a line on the second chances. We keep complaining about our youth and the violence around the world, but we keep giving second chances to all these famous sports&quot;stars&quot;that it makes you wonder what is the real message that we as a society is sending to our youth.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:33 am | april 

To all of those hypocritical people who have a problem with Mike Vick getting a second chance, but wish those dogs could have had a second chance, who are they to say that he doesn&apos;t deserve a second chance? If Jesus can forgive, why can&apos;t they?
 August 14, 2009 at 11:33 am | J 

All you ppl who sayin vick doesnt need to be in the NFL get ova yourself.. cuz if u were in the situation he is im sure u would be beggin an cryin for a second chance at life as u know it. Dog fighting is part of certain lifestyles an many people have seen it and been a part of it that u dont even know of.
This is when vick proves that you prejeduce and hypocrytical people dont matter in big decisions because your thought process is one way and your vision is blinded by your own hatred for lyfestyles that we are braught up in from kids to adults.
Take notice on his positive attitude through his conviction an dealing with all this extra un-necessary precautions that the league has taked with re- instating him..
This is comin from a 15 year old dat live in poverty an looks up to him because of his maturity an how he made it out the hood.

vick got all da 757 support
 August 14, 2009 at 11:33 am | Cindy Black 

He should never be allowed to play football again. I do believe in second chances but not in the case of hurting the ones that do not have a voice for themselves. By that I mean animals, a baby,and the elderly that no longer understand what is going on! Cindy Black from Lakewood CO
 August 14, 2009 at 11:33 am | Sophia 

First let me say that Mike Vick hurt a D-O-G, Not a human, people get away with murder, attempted murder and other heinous acts every single day, no one has a word to say but harm a mutt, and there is chaos. Second all of you that are all of a sudden never going to watch the NFL or CNN for announcing that they have done what God does which is give people a second chance who cares that you never watch or listen ever again, do us all a favor crawl under a rock and hide please and thank you. If you have never done anything that has required someone to forgive you then by all means please continue to criticize and thank you superman/woman. However if you are actually a human being you will know that it is not your place to judge anyone and how dare you do so! You will also realize that he has done his time he paid his so called debt to society so get off of his back and find something else productive for your idiotic mind to do. That is all.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:33 am | David 

Vick should be given a second chance since his punishment&amp;contrition. But somebody that actually killed PEOPLE, like Donte Stallworth, should not be given a second chance to make a lot of money. Leonard Little also killed somebody while driving under the influence and he got back in the NFL with only an 8 game suspension, but he didn&apos;t learn from it because he was arrested again 6 years later with a DUI!!! If they have the potential to make a lot of money, then they should be held at a greater standard by their potential to do more harm!!!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:33 am | Elaine 

Second chances yes, but I feel all the dogs that died due to Vic should never be forgotten. If he is going to get a second change with NFL, I believe he should be requiried to pay a percent of his million dollar wages to the Humane Society for at least 5 years. While this will not bring back those dogs who died due to Vic, it certainly will help to save others and from the same fate.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:34 am | Sarah 

It is horrible that the NFL would even consider letting Michael Vick back. There are many excellent football players who would not murder dogs for money who should be considered for an NFL position. It&apos;s all about money and Vick would say anything to get his zillion dollar job back. I think he is overrated and this will surely come out once football season starts. Personally I will change my football focus to college football. The NFL has gotten way out of control. If Vick had an illegal child fighting business they would likely forgive him and hire him. Dogs are little people with fur and they have feelings and would do anything for their humans. His dogs trusted him and he tortured them and he deserves nothing. His eyes lie. His greed shows.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:34 am | Rashaun Burgess 

If god can forgive us time over and continually give us chance after chance, I think we can give Mike a second chance. People in their everyday lives do things that are wrong, but because Vick is in the public eye his wrong doing has just been put on public display; and so we then look to condemn him? Totally not right! He is no different than you and I. He has done his time and changed his life around. He deserves the opportunity to now walk down a new path. With all that aside, I believe he still has the ability to come back after being away for two years and be a force in the NFL. GO VICK!!!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:34 am | Charlie Criss retired NBA player 

Yes Vick was involed in a terrible thing, truly bad choices.
I truly believe that he deserves a second chance and will be a better man for it. When you are given so much so young it&apos;s very difficult to handle the new life and the responsibilites that come with it. All pro atheletes need mentors like myself and Tony Dungy. It really helps eventhough you are responsible for the road you take in life. I love dogs. I&apos;ve owned several from time to time, it was painful to hear ,to invision. Vick has paid for this in the public sector. He&apos;s had 2 long years to think about what he did, he lost a lot in terms of respect, freedom, money and the honor of representing the NFL in a star role.
Forgivness is powerful. Thanks!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:34 am | David Yackley 

&quot;Sports Hero&quot;is an oxymoron. It has been ever since the first baseball and football strikes, when idolized professional athletes reveled just how little they really care about their ridiculous worshipers, who should know better.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:34 am | BRANDI 

I BELIEVE EVERYONE DESERVES A SECOND CHANCE. HE MADE A MISTAKE HE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT AND ITS GOOD THAT HE IS GETTING THAT SECOND CHANCE. REALLY PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE ONLY PERSON THAT CAN JUDGE YOU IS GOD AND INSTEAD OF CASTING THE FIRST STONE SOMEONE SHOULD HAVE BEEN PRAYING FOR HIM. BUT OVERALL I AM VERY HAPPY FOR HIM.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:34 am | Darla 

YES, it was not a&quot;life&quot;sentence so don&apos;t treat it like one! He served his time and appears very remorseful. Furthermore, it bothers me how upset people still are over his misdeed with animals when most don&apos;t get that upset over&quot;child molestors&quot;who serve alot less time. Check yourself people...humans vs. animals!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:34 am | Belinda Warren 

This man went to prison for indirectly being involved with&quot;animal torture&quot;. Did someone say waterboarding? How about a needless war? He most definitely deserves a second chance!!!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:34 am | SHAWNTA COLEMAN 

YOU PEOPLE NEED TO GET HELP AND GET YOUR OWN LIVES. THE MAN MADE A MISTAKE AND HE PAID HIS DEBT TO SOCIETY. HE DID SOMETHING WRONG YES BUT THE DOES NOT CHANGE THE FACT THAT HE IS AN EXCELLENT FOOTBALL PLAYER. HE MAKESNHIS LIVING FROM THIS LINE OF WORK. HOW ABOUT IF YOU MADE A MISTAKE WOULD YOU NOT WANT YOUR WAY OF LIVING TO BE THERE WHEN YOU GET BACK SO THAT YOU COULD PROVIDE FOR YOUR FAMILY?

IVE SEEN WORSE THINGS THAN THAT WHILE SERVING IN THE US ARMED FORCES.

MICHEAL VICK KEEP YOUR HEAD UP KNOW WHO ARE, WHERE YOU CAME FROM AND WHERE YOUR GOING.

This is to Sharon for her comment..... look Martha Steward lied to a federal court and even tho she didn&apos;t kill anyone she help pull the trigger to someone losing money in the market and making their life just as much harder with possibilities of someone committing suicide so do you think that Martha is a murderer...No but a lie is a lie and if you will lie you will steal, and if you steal you will kill its just a matter of how and what order you do it.....ITS ALL GOING IN THE SAME ROUTINE!!!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:34 am | Don T. 

Vick should be given a second chance as a citizen of the U.S., but definitely not as a possible high profile athlete. Do we want children idolizing this type of dispicable action? He can&apos;t be trusted?
 August 14, 2009 at 11:34 am | Arlene 

I am from his hometown and know his family. His personal story is a triumph and his poor choices lead to his conviction . I find it ironic how we have a justice system that is about restitution. Yet, we still want to penalize people after they have done what was required by law.

He should have a chance...he&apos;s paid his dues. This is a part of a bigger problem, we don&apos;t really allow people to move forward after a mishap in life. We put road blocks that keep them on the edge of going back to a past they wish to escape from.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:34 am | CeeCee 

Michael Phelps was forgiven for smoking pot. Big Ben will be forgiven for whatever he&apos;s done

Why must you [news media] continue to insight negativism of Vick in the news? Leave him alone and let him build his life back. He is blessed with Dungy in his life–in our times of lifes trials and tribulations, there will be a guardian angel messenger to get us through.

Social networking opportunities have set an atmosphere of hatred that unfairly controls opinions of people and their actions to destroy people.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:34 am | Rodney Horikawa 

What Michael Vick did was deplorable–unconscionable. But he paid his debt to society and to the league and was shown no favoritism. He should be given a second chance. I am reserved in my welcome of Michael back into the NFL but I do welcome him back. I hope through his actions he puts my trust in him on sold ground. We&apos;ll see...

I&apos;d like to comment also at how disturbed i am by the virulent condemnation of Michael Vick, the Eagles, etc as the news of this return was announced. In a Christian culture, in a paradigm of forgiveness, what is that all about? In a society still stepping out of a racist legacy, what is that all about? There just seems to be something standing behind people&apos;s self-righteous finger wagging...
 August 14, 2009 at 11:35 am | Weldon Edwards 

Tony
Question, is it because Vick is a felon or is it the nature of the crime? My reason is that Martha Stewart was allowed her second chance after coming out of prison. He did his time, like it our not, so let the man work, and the NFL is a job.

Weldon
 August 14, 2009 at 11:35 am | Mike from Oregon 

Glad to hear Vick is back to the sport he loves very much. He made a mistake and he already paid for it. People need to get over it and give the young man a chance. We are human beings and we all make mistakes. Some may view Vick’s crime as been offal however, he is trying to put it behind him and move on with his life.

What I like to see is Vick doing will in the sport and helping poor kids with his skill and donate some of his money to help poor kids towards to meal/housing/education etc. good luck to you Vick…
 August 14, 2009 at 11:35 am | Annie Bell 

Michael, like multitude of others–some&quot;goody twoshoes&quot;needed to learn a lesson. He needed to pay his debt to society for being&quot;grossly cruel to animals, or simply for breaking the law as many&quot;law abiding citizens do everyday (break the law).

Hence, the man has paid his debt, and just as others who have been caught deviating from the acceptable, he deserves his constitutional right to the pursuit of happiness which happens to be reinstatement to the NFL.

People need to read the Bible, and not be judgemental. They should not pick on him. They should forgive him and move on, unless they are haters.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:35 am | Carole 

Goodday: Are you people for real? Ok, what Vicki did is not kind to the dogs. But you sent him to prison and now you have him on the&quot;judgment seat&quot;Who gives you people the right. Yes, he should be playing football, using the gifts God gave him. Second chance? He should not have gotten the punishment he received. This is a Country that treats animal better than they treat human beings.&quot;Let the first one who has not done wrong, throw a stone&quot;At Mr. Vicki. Get off the self righteous chair and allow the man to be a human. American that still hate people and do worst to them that men did to dogs. Who is judging this.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:35 am | Barb 

Sorry, I don&apos;t buy it. The only thing I think he&apos;s sorry for was that he got caught and had to spend two years in prison. I work with a diverse population, but please, cultural? How stupid does he think people are. No one can convince me that he didn&apos;t know he was doing wrong at the time he did it. It all comes down to money, plain and simple.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:35 am | Sally Simms 

I&apos;m happy that Michael Vick got a second chance. His poor helpless victims didn&apos;t. Right now, he is a terrible role model for children. His words are fine. Let&apos;s see what his actions are. What he did was not for money, it was done for the sake of cruelty. But seeing how&quot;stars&quot;get away with anything in this society as long as they bring in the bucks it&apos;s not surprising.

I own rescue dogs, some of which were the victims of people like Vick and I see what it does to them. He wouldn&apos;t get a second chance from me.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:35 am | P Stevens 

When do we have the right to play God! As a matter of fact, PETA and athe media are placing themselves above God. Of course Michael Vick deserves a second chance just as you or I would like to have a second chance. People are more important than animals and this is coming from an animal lover! Vick is labeled on your show as&quot;Convicted Felon&quot;but what about the NFL player who killed someone while driving drunk and got a slap on a wrist. Where is justice in this country! I congratulate the Eagles for their courage in doing what is right regardless of what the media or PETA thinks. PETA themselves are dog killers but they try to hide that fact! May God have mercy on all of you when you stand in His court one day!

What a mixed bag of emotions! Should Vick be forgiven for his actions-absolutely. If God can forgive us for our sins, we as sinners should forgive Vick. What he did is without a doubt WRONG.

As for being allowed to return to the NFL, he was dealt a better card that other felons. If Vick is genuinely sorry for his actions, he should take this opportunity to make things right.

TONY IF THEY GIVE M.VICK A SECOND CHANCE WHAT ABOUT PETE ROSE. HE GAMBLED AS DID M.VICK WITCH IS A VIOLATION OF LEAGUE RULES. FOOTBALL AND BASEBALL. MAYBE THE NFL CAN SKIRT THE RULES. OR THE BASEBALL COMMISONER IS TOUGHER WHEN RULES ARE BROKEN

He should have every opportunity to play and earn a living as another
person being release from prison such as murderer, drug dealers,
pimps and all the others. He was convicted of a crime that the Good Old boys have been doing for years up in the Hills of America. and still are to this day.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:36 am | Tiffany 

The people&apos;s comments on this blog has been amazing. How dare them, as people that make mistakes daily, suggest that this man should not receive a second chanc He has legally served his time and hopefully have asked for God&apos;s forgiveness, and that&apos;s all he needed to do. Good luck Mike!

vick shouldn&apos;t get a second chance
 August 14, 2009 at 11:36 am | Dorothy 

This country has two sets of standards. One for athletes and one for the rest of us. These guys in sports make me sick. They make ridiculous millions for bouncing, catching or kicking a ball while the rest of us poor slobs have to work for a living. They have the world in their hand, and a chance to do so much good for so many people and be mentors and heros for our children. What do they do? Drive drunk , assault and rape women, try to choke their coach, and then you have Mr Vick. This sick, demented sociopath who gets his jollys from torturing and killing little defenseless animals. We all should be proud that we hold these athelete up to admire. They should be paid the salary that our teachers or police make and be treated like everyone else. And when they do a crime, they should be banned from coming back and making more millions for bouncing, catching or kicking a ball. That would probably straighten them out. I stopped watching professional sports a long time ago. Give me college sports anyday.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:36 am | Nancy Landset 

Michael Vick should NOT be permitted to play in the NFL. He committed a horrible crime killing and maiming dogs. People who do this are shown to be much more likely to abuse their children or spouse. Is this the role model we want for children? Commit a horrible crime, go to jail, say you&apos;re sorry and get a second chance at earning millions and millions of dollars. Meanwhile wonderful teachers, social workers and others who are truly making a difference in our society can barely make a living. Vick needs psychiatric help not a new football team to play for.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:36 am | Exilienne j.f 

The bible says to forgive. Who are we to condemn those who have done wrong? He deserves a second chance, I hope he has learned from his mistakes. At the same token his talents should not be bounded because of what happened. I&apos;m happy that he is back in the game.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:36 am | Michelle 

Michael Vick served his time and people need to get over it! I love animals just like the next person and do not think they should be tortured, but he did his time and paid restitution. He is coming out as a changed man and everyone deserves a second chance. We place more value on a animals life than a human&apos;s. Donte Stallworth got 30 days in jail for killing a human being and everyone is about boycotting the Eagles just because they signed Vick. Get over it!

&quot;Maybe it would have been better if Michael Vicks had kill someone. I think he would have gotten a better deal. They took everything he had and now he has nothing. Just stop talking about this man and let him start a new life. He said he was sorry, People are so ugly and self righteous and so is the media….&quot;

He said he was sorry????? is that all we have to do in this country is&quot;say we&apos;re sorry&quot;? People are not ugly torture is ugly.

Boycott all eagles advertisers.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:36 am | michelle in virginia 

HOW LONG DOES AMERICA WANT TO PUNISH THIS MAN!!!!! Enough is enough! He commited a crime and did his time. Allow him to now work in the profession that he knows.Are we not a country that is suppose to be about forgiving and healing? You cant move forward and heal until you forgive and let go. Come on America! We are so hypocritical!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:36 am | Jan Pezzi 

Michael Vick is a sociopath and I am not at all impressed with his weak admissions of wrong doing. He obviously is incapable of empathy or simple compassion and does not deserve any sort of second chance. He should still be in prison, instead of making millions. I hope people remember just how heinous and depraved his crimes against innocent animals truly were. There&apos;s just no rehabilitation for someone who lacks a soul.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:37 am | Phil, Georgia 

Vick is very intelligent, thoughtful and said alot of wise, heartfelt things that the Animal community and us as Americans should feel hopeful and proud of. We must get, that nomatter what your craft, skill, or gift is, we as a society must realize that we are all human with flaws(sin) and must be willing to give chances to people for them to become their God given selves and contribute their gift to our world to make us all better people.

As many mistakes as our children make, we wouldn&apos;t just give up on them when they mess up. Through this, children learn that they can eventually be who they want to be, and not have to be perfect.&quot;Train up a child in the way they should go and they will not depart&quot;
 August 14, 2009 at 11:37 am | 1 MMT (Edmonton, Canada) 

Michael Vick has done his time for his crime and he too has a right to earn a living.

I am appalled by PETA&apos;a double standards here. How come they did not come out screaming when those 21 Polo horses were killed in Florida recently?

Surely there was abundant negligence there when those horses were allegedly fed some contaminated&quot;supplements&quot;.

Michael Vick&apos;s&quot;punishment&quot;is the responsibility of the government. And they sent him to prison for 23 months. What more do you people want?

Would you rather Michael Vick stays unemployed and on welfare in this economic climate, or would you rather he uses his abilities to earn a living?
 August 14, 2009 at 11:37 am | chris, wa 

I think michael vick should get a second chance because he&apos;s an insperation to the NFL.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:37 am | HillbillyBill 

Good for him. But if he were not an outstanding NFL football star, would he have got the same chance? How many of his fellow prison mates got or will get the same or similar chance?
 August 14, 2009 at 11:37 am | Diana M 

I think people are going overboard calling him a sociopath and such. The man is not the devil. He made a mistake. These people need to stop being so judgemental. This is the problem with this country and the prison system. It should be about rehabilitation. If the result of Vick coming out of prison and back into the limelight is he helps stop dog cruelty from happening for just a few, then it is completely worth it. I believe in the protection of animals but just like we do with any other issue there are those who go to far. Wanting to continue to punish this man after he has done his time is taking it too far. He is not dangerous. He is not a threat. All those saying these mean things about Vick are unchristian. This is really when people need to think WWJD because I think he would forgive a remorseful man. I am happy for Vick and I hope he succeeds inspite of the ugliness and hatred of some.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:37 am | cathy birleffi 

Vicks should not play in the NFL&apos;
he was a grown man with not a care for his family, fans, dogs, employer its not like he was a kid and made a mistake
he knew what he was doing and did not care
 August 14, 2009 at 11:37 am | Aneta L 

I don&apos;t think it is right what the Eagles did by signing Vick. By doing that it just goes to show that you may commit any crime and still get your job back, basically saying that it was okay for Vick to do everything that he did. It is sad to see the level that many teams stoop down to just to get themselves new players and/or wins......so sad, and I hope that no one goes to their games. Vick has a tarnished name and reputation and he brings that with him to Philly. I like the Jets, anyways.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:37 am | Michael Kane 

I think what Michael Vick was deplorable and disgusting. I was all for letting him die at the mouths of the dogs he tortured. But today I believe he was sincere in his conviction to change and to stop others from doing the same. I think his defining moment was the negative reaction by his fellow prisoners to what he did.
The best person to intervene in gambling, alcohol or drug addiction is a recovered addict, not a book learned PhD or pontification liberal.

If he wants to make a difference he can by the way changes others through his actions.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:37 am | CHM 

I support MV&apos;s return to the NFL as he deserves a second chance. I just regret that people have to make this about race. And it always happens on the CNN blogs.

Hello Tony,

I am an ex-stockbroker and a convicted felon. I did two years in prison and I have been home for two years. It has been a nightmare trying to survive for the last two years. I have been abandoned by everyone family and friends and I have trouble holding and finding a job. This country was founded on the idea that if you make a mistake and make amends you should be able to get a second chance. This is another one of the lies that America tells us. In this country you are branded for ever and there is no such thing as a second chance unless you have money to start with. So on behalf of all of the ex-cons released from federal prison living with the mistakes that you have made for the rest of our lives congratulations Michael Vick and I hope you have learned the most valuable lesson here. In the US there are no second chances and you just got real lucky.

From an ex-stockbroker band from the securities industry for life after a fifteen year career.

Yes some situations deserve a second chance! I Don&apos;t Condone the cruelty of Animals, But I don&apos;t Condone the Cruelty of Human beings More! Americans have gotten Twisted, Women Kiss more Dogs Now, that People! Our Laws, put all kinds of Criminals back on the Street without Question. Rapist, Wife-Beaters, Child-Molesters,etc. Yet PETA types want Blood from this man after he served his Time! Funny, White Collar crime can Devastate Thousands, yet because we can&apos;t track the depth of that Pain&amp;Suffering it continues unchecked! // His ties with Tony Dungee is to have an Honorable Man of God to Guide him. That is the Missing link in many a child/person that goes astray!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:37 am | Shirin 

SHAME ON THE PHYILLIES TO HIRE THIS DOG KILLER! THERE IS NOTHING THIS GUY CAN SAY OR DO TO CHANGE WHO HE IS, HE LOST EVERYTHING AND WANTS IT BACK, ONCE THE MONEY IS BACK IN HIS HANDS, HE WILL DO IT AGAIN. AS A DIE HARD NFL FAN, I JUST GOT TURNED OFF, I&apos;M DONE, SO IS MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:37 am | Manzi Icyaliho 

Any body in this World has right for second chance. Vick did mistakes and so called the right people did punish him and paid the price.
Why America still doing business with China remember they eat dogs.
Why do we think that The Clinton are good American while Genocide in Rwanda, Kosovo, Somali was on their watch???
 August 14, 2009 at 11:37 am | Joyce E. Collins 

I know that Mr. Vick should be part of the NFL, the time that he served is more than some convicted of manslaughter (the taking of human life). I don&apos;t think that he should have gone to jail at all, to have been bankrupted and hounded like he has been, or to have to beg to return to his profession. However, I take issue with your question that included that he&quot;tortured animals&quot;making it seem as if he is some sadist animal hater. Words have power and a man of color I would hope that you would not be so careless with words that cause so much damage. By the way, I am a dog owner and lover, but I don&apos;t put my dog Jack above the life of any human. They could have used Mr. Vick as a sponsor for animal welfare clinics nationwide but they used the pretext to break yet another succesful black man...and yet he rises!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:37 am | Belinda Warren 

I also would like to add, and some may take offense to this, and I have taken 3 dogs into my home, but animals do not have souls. How may people have died fighting in wars that were needless?
 August 14, 2009 at 11:38 am | Bob Lopez 

Michael Vick. While I detest what Mike did to dogs and allowed others to do also,I must open my eyes and look at the big picture.
Vick was accused,tried and convicted. He was sentenced and served his time in prison. He lost a large fortune,suffered public humiliation and in turn did everything the law required. Any further problems I have with Michael Vick&apos;s past are just that, my problems.
Mike deserves a second chance. To not give him this opportunity makes our legal system and religions a sham.
As Mike said today.....my (Vick) actions will speak louder than my words.
God bless you young man. With friends like Tony Dungy your future can be brighter than before.

 August 14, 2009 at 11:38 am | Joan 

I don&apos;t think that Vick should play this year AT ALL! He certainly didn&apos;t serve his full time in his prison sentence and giving a few talks to kids on why he now values dogs lives isn&apos;t a strong enough message for the horrific choice he made! These&quot;talks&quot;were a condition of his early release anyway and proves nothing about his change of heart. The only thing he&apos;s sorry about is his loss of income and he&apos;ll do anything to get that back, I&apos;m sure. Oh yeah, he&apos;s found the Lord too while in jail. I wonder how long it will be convenient for him to try the public on that angle.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:38 am | Jay Dennison 

&quot;Societies double standard toward crime&quot;, could be a title to a book. I am a educator for 25 years. If I were to be convicted of something like this (dog fighting), my teaching certificate would be pulled and would be out of the teaching profession permanently. Would I get a second chance. I don&apos;t think so.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:38 am | Bill Winston 

Should there be&quot;second chances&quot;? With one of 32 Americans incarcerated, on probation or parole (NY Times, March 3, 2009), there better be! With over 2 Million people incarcerated in the US, and 550,000 leaving state, federal and counties facilities a year we need ways to transition people into society and support recovery. Incarcerating everyone has not worked and has proved extremely costly.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:38 am | Richard 

Why not Tony. He paid his due. It should be forgoten the same way WE used and trained dogs to chase African-American in the past (institutional violence). Michael Vick should be reinstated with the same previous rights and privileges and only his performance on the field can dictate the contrary.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:38 am | Laura Dickson 

Kick Vick out. Take your second chance somewhere else. Felons as heroes is wrong. At the very least, donate half your salary to helping abused pets.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:38 am | Mark 

The man served his time and deserves to play again. All the people saying he shouldn&apos;t play don&apos;t know what it&apos;s like to spend 2 years in prison. He was truly sorry for what he did and the people who cant look past what he did should be ashamed of themselves.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:38 am | DJ J-NICE 

TONY, COM ON.. EVERY PERSON DESERVE ANOTHER CHANCE, YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT RAPE KIDS, DRUNK DRIVERS, MURDERERS, PRESIDENTS, CONGRESSMAN, NEWS ANCHORS THAT GET ANOTHER CHANCE WHY NOT MIKE VICK.. YOU GUYS NEED TO REALLY STOP AND LET THAT MAN FEED HIS FAMILY AND PLAY BACK IN THE NFL
 August 14, 2009 at 11:38 am | Chris 

Give vick a break stop dwelling on the past. What is done is done! He paid his time. Who cares if he killed a couple of dogs people kill innocent animals all the time only difference is they have a license to do it hunting! It&apos;s crazy that people make this big of a deal
about it. But here we have Dante Stallworth that kills a freaking human being and gets a slap on the hand for it and vick goes to prison for two years for killing a dog! There is something wrong with this!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:39 am | Jean Hughes 

Michael Vick has been punished for his crime and should be forgiven for his mistake. What if God did not forgive us? We would all go straight to&quot;Hell&quot;. Also, what about the humans who are murdered daily? Is their an out cry to punish the culprits eternally or not forgive them..
 August 14, 2009 at 11:39 am | matthew 

Michael Vick deserves a second chance. As torturing and brutal the crime may appear to be, serving up hate does not solve the problem. He was incarcerated and lost all credibility. To go from such a high position to the confines of a jail cell changes the person you are. If it doesn&apos;t then he&apos;ll be back where he was. We all deserve a second chance, no one can claim that they wouldn&apos;t want one.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:39 am | richard, vancouver 

are you ppl aware that a REAL music pioneer died? cnn is as twisted as vick... you are transformed into the michael jackson channel for 2 weeks and theres barely a fart about les paul... sooo lame
 August 14, 2009 at 11:39 am | Tammy Siers 

The only thing he is sorry for is that he got caught. Do people not understand the link between animal abuse and human violence? The guy who beats his dog will also go home and beat his wife and kids. He needs mental help in addition to jailtime. No psycologically normal human being could do the things he has done. He should never enjoy another day of celebrity status.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:39 am | Louise 

I think Michael Vick should be given a second chance. He made a mistake as we all do in life. We as a people just do not know what terrible mistakes people make, because we are not in the public&apos;s eye. I think the haters need to look in their own closets and see what comes up. As far as PITA, I agree with another comment. They need to get a life. Anyone who would go after the POTUS in reference to a fly has nothing else to do. There are more important things in life than this! And what about Nia Long posing in a magazine for PITA in the nude on a bus. We have heard no comment on that from the media. What kind of message does that send. Forgive and forget! Move on people!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:39 am | Sophia 

P.S. When an athlete signs up to be an athlete that is all they are signing on to do. Not be a role model to your child. Get a life! Any parent who lets a person that their child has no real relationship with be their role model says something about your parenting skills. That athlete is human and is entitled to make mistakes just like you. So before you judge and criticize someone on their mistakes that were made and broadcasted publically do us all a favor and take a look in the mirror point out your own flaws/mistakes, call the news paper and pay to run the ad about whatever you have done and then criticize, because the only difference is people actually care about them because they are in the limelight. Besides they never asked you to let your kid look up to them! END
 August 14, 2009 at 11:39 am | Mark-North Carolina 

Since only the court system determines if someones time is served my response is, now that he&apos;s out he deserves a second chance and I wish him luck and success.

My concern however, is that those that give him a second chance may inadvertantly or on purpose sabatoge it at the same time by speaking negative of him. Secondly I don&apos;t understand how those people that don&apos;t believe he deserves a second chance would say anything to derail his documented positive direction. Unfortunately many of the people out there are half empty vs half full types of people and that is sad.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:40 am | Ross 

I think every person admits what he did was wrong and in some peoples minds unforgiveable. We can look at this from the legal aspect and say he did the time for the crime, now let him play. Or we can look at this from the moral angel and ask ourself can he ever make up for such a horrific act? Well, he can&apos;t if don&apos;t allow him.

I believe he now realizes he has someone higher to answer to than all of us and thats why he will overcome this. It&apos;s the people that believe they only have to answer to themselves I worry about.

This was my opinion before I knew he had Tony Dungys support. Once I learned Tony Dungy supports Micahel Vick, I knew God was has reached Michael.. Sometimes he has to humble us before we are ready to listen. This is what happened to MV..

Before you think your better than MV, first ask yourself what are you doing with your second chance Jesus gave you? God bless...
 August 14, 2009 at 11:40 am | Mark 

The Philadelphia fans will be the perfect acid test for Michael Vick. If he can survive the pressure and bring something to the table that the Eagles have not had in the past, this will in fact become a win win situation for all.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:40 am | Shawn Mory McMillion 

Dear Mr. Harris:

Along with a dedicated group of volunteers, I was the first Animal Services Officer in the first, non-kill shelter in the U.S. in Laguna Beach, CA in the 1970&apos;s. I firmly believe that Mr. Vick deserves a second chance because of my simple philosophy that when we know better, we do better. His statements and answers this morning were clearly remorseful, thoughtful and contrite and his newly found awareness of just how strongly animal lovers in this country, and the world at large, feel regarding the care of animals is an outstanding example to others with a similar background to his that they, too, can change their own perspectives on dog ownership for the better. It is my hope that he remain involved in a positive manner with the Best Friends Animal Sanctuary in southern Utah, and perhaps even be a participant in a series of programs on Animal Planet and Dogtown.

Sincerely yours,
Shawn Mory McMillion
 August 14, 2009 at 11:40 am | Fred 

Yes, Michael Vick was convicted of a crime. But let&apos;s take a realistic look at the situation and examine our society. Many of us ate eggs, bacon, etc this morning or this week. The eggs, bacon and other meat products that we eat are gathered through the slaughter of animals...the slaughter of these animals are just as cruel or might be worse than what Michael Vick condoned. Just take a look at Sarah Palin and other people who are advent hunters...they hunt animals and shoot them for sport. Humans participate in boxing and some people have died because of injuries; wrestlers hit each other over the head with chairs, and participants in Ultimate Fighting Championship make their opponent submit by either knocking them out or breaking a bone, etc. Yes, Michael Vick did break the law, but he that is without sin, let him cast the first stone. In the final analysis, none of us are without sin.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:41 am | William Byrd 

Michael Vick has admitted his wrongful act, paid a price for his wrongful act, and now he is trying to atone for his wrongful act. Michael Vick has become a spokesman for PETA to persuade urban dog figthers that their actions are tantamount to animal cruelty. Michael Vick made a mistake, and should not have to pay for the mistake the rest of his life. He lost millions and he lost time. America is about second changes. Although I love dogs, I believe Michael Vick deserves a second chance. God bless Coach Andy Reid. I am a New York Giants fan, but I will be rooting for Michael Vick and the Philadelphia Eagles. Go Eagles!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:41 am | Hunter 

Our society has made itself so great, that we forget the empowerment of restraint. Unfortunately, in certain areas, we are given more to personal privilege than we are to responsibility and personal accountability.

With Mr. Vick, the point of view of&apos;the 2nd chance&quot;is over-rated and is given too much attention.

I better train of thought,&apos;We advocate patience and proper training&apos;.
Its a blanket exercise, and we could all benefit.

Of course, this is a battle with human nature. But retraining and discipline is what is needed.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:41 am | Leslie 

I TRULY BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE DESERVES A SECOND CHANCE. I DON&apos;T THINK ANYONE OUT HERE IS PERFECT. I DO BELIEVE; HOWEVER, THAT ONCE YOU REALIZE YOUR MISTAKE, YOU OWN UP TO IT AND NEVER MAKE THAT SAME MISTAKE TWICE. MICHAEL VICK HAS HIS PUNISHMENT AND HE HAS THE RIGHT TO CONTINUE HIS LIFE, WHETHER IT&apos;S THE NFL OR NOT. ALL OF US HAVE MADE MISTAKES. WHETHER WE HAVE BEEN CAUGHT WITH THOSE MISTAKES IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT. I WISH MICHAEL THE BEST.

 August 14, 2009 at 11:41 am | Jim 

The ugly desecration and murder of all those dogs–they had no voice. Thank God for groups, such as Humane Society and PETA for giving them a chance, a voice, and who protect the rights and welfare of animals. I don&apos;t think Vick should get a second chance. Would a player get a second chance for murdering or harming 1 or 2 human beings? Vick took hundreds of dogs lives and used the monies from his NFL days to pay for these ugly operations. No, he should find work in community service and spend time in high schools to spread a message of compassion for all living beings. As Gandhi said, you can measure the true progress of a nation by the way it treats its animals. God bless all creatures!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:42 am | CY 

I&apos;d good to see the majority of comments against Vick. He does not deserve to be out of jail. I&apos;m not going to go on and on, others have said it well–serial killers start with animals, and that&apos;s how I see Vick. He&apos;s a disgrace to the human race–and, Newport News–this has nothing to do with race. ANY HUMAN BEING who did what he did would earn my wrath, male or female, of any race or religion. Dogs are as precious as children–Vick will never win over the people who value their pets as a part of the family. The Eagles have made a big mistake. But, it was there&apos;s to make.

I leave you with this quote: The measure of a civilization is shown in how it treats its weakest members.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:42 am | Erika 

I&apos;m all for second chances, but there is such a thing as TOO MUCH of a second chance. Putting Vick back into the same work envirionment that gave him the ability to commit this crime on the scale and to the extent that he did seems ridiculous. Had he not the income/assets he did from being an NFLer, you wonder if he would have been able to do all he did so easily. It&apos;s a privelege to be able to work in professional sports–Vick abused the priveleges of being in this sport to commit the crimes he did... although he served his time, and has apologized, I don&apos;t think he should be given the privelege to play professionally again. When you commit other crimes, you lose priveleges...why should his crime be any different?
 August 14, 2009 at 11:42 am | c. kidd 

yes m.vick should be forgiven, and given a second chance. at one time, in this country dogs and blackmen shared the the same luxuary tax. america forgave it&apos;s self for the brutal lynching of afro-americans. why not m.vick. you&apos;ve made him buck dance on nat&apos;l t.v. thats enough.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:42 am | Bobbie Cason 

micheal vick wants to excuse his actions by saying that what he did was a part of his culture,but I dont accept his excuse,;to be able to abuse and destroy a helpless creature, means that there is something missing in his heart.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:42 am | Anne Harmon 

Once again bad behavior is rewarded as long as money is involved. Is making money so important that values and morals do not matter anymore? I would not support any team in the NFL that hired on Michael Vick. I would hope that all the potential millions he is going to make, a percentage of his salary will go towards helping facilities for abused and neglected dogs. Giving someone a second chance...yes, but at what expense? What message is this sending to our children?
 August 14, 2009 at 11:43 am | bill harris 

i reallly don&apos;t feel someone like Vick should get another chance in the NFL. these people have always been role models with the things he has done to animals, would you want your child to grow up like that piece of human garbage?
 August 14, 2009 at 11:43 am | Disgusted 

I think Vick said it himself,&apos;Playing in the NFL is a privilege, not a right.&quot;This man was, and unfortunately is now again, part of an organization so many would like to be a part of, but in reality, will never get close. I think those who are lucky enough to have an NFL position should act like it. Associating themselves with disgusting behavior should not be tolerated. It&apos;s not like they would have a problem filling the spot. Shame on you Roger Goodell for not demanding a stronger standard of behavior of those in the organization.

Michael Vick did his time, that is true but, you can&apos;t take the monster out of the man. He is a a person to took enjoyment in torturing animals by forcing them to fight, watching them rip into each others flesh and by killing them with his bare hands. I really don&apos;t believe that 18 months in prison is going to change this man, I don&apos;t believe he will ever change in his own head. He can speak words because he has been coached but you can bet he still has the enjoyment in his heart from the actions he took against those poor innocent creatures of God. Dog fighting is a very brutal, violent and bloody crime and anyone who can let this man stand in the limelight and be a role model for our children is taking another step towards the shredding of this Country&apos;s moral fiber.
If he were a garbage truck driver or a shoe shine guy I&apos;d say, give him his old job back but, this one of America&apos;s most popular sports and should not be allowed to participate in that.

I am very glad that the Eagles decided to give Vick a second chance. There was no reason to make him suffer anymore than he already has; going to prison for 2 years is enough punish to me.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:44 am | Msojourn 

A second chance? I thought he served his time? By continuously hampering opportunities and laughable rehabilitation in our corrections system our society has all but given the thumbs up for repeat offenders, and we sit around wondering why our prisons are full.

WHAT DON&apos;T YOU MORALLY BANKRUPT PEOPLE GET (BRANDI)!!!
THE ONLY REASON MICHAEL VICK STOPPED IS BECAUSE HE GOT CAUGHT!!! THAT WAS NOT A MISTAKE!!! THAT WAS AN UNCONSCIONABLE EVIL THING THAT HE DID. HE IS AS BAD AS A CHILD MOLESTER. HE HAS THAT IN HIM–JUST THE MERE FACT THAT HE IS CAPABLE OF SUCH A DISGUSTING HORRIBLE ACT IS FRIGHTENING. THAT IS NOT A MISTAKE THAT IS A EVIL, SICK AND TWISTED PERSON THAT SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE PART OF SOCIETY. HE&apos;S NOT RIGHT IN THE HEAD–YOU DON&apos;T OUTGROW THAT JUST LIKE YOU CAN&apos;T REFORM SCUM LIKE THAT. HE DID IT FOR ENTERTAINMENT–WHAT PART OF THAT DON&apos;T YOU GET!!! MICHAEL VICK SHOULD BE ELECTROCUTED, HUNG, BEAT WITH A BAT AND DROWNED JUST LIKE ALL THE THINGS HE DID TO THOSE DOGS!!! THE ONLY REASON HE STOPPED IS BECAUSE HE GOT CAUGHT!!!

Not everyone deserves a second chance, Charles Manson and Adolf Hitler comes firstly to mind because they have and had no regret. But I believe whatever his motivations, Michael does.

What he did was morally wrong. But ask yourself “what happens to race horses after they no longer win races“. Vick’s contribution was more direct, but in both cases animals suffer needlessly for human sport.
Why don’t we stop any sport that may lead to the suffering of animals and punish those involved.
Because in America we pick and choose who to punish and the degree of the punishment.

This story has more subtle, less mentioned social undertones. Do we rehabilitate or do we punish for life and does the punishment fit the crime.

the man did a bad thing but he payed his dues,you dont have too forgive him,I am a pet lover but I dont have too like him,but let the man go on with his life. It be nice of him too give money once a year for home less pets.this something he has too live with the rest of his life.time too move on two wrongs dont make it right like by putting him down for what he did move on
 August 14, 2009 at 11:45 am | Darrell 

He did not give ANY OF the dogs a second chance but now that he wants to play foot ball for the bucks he is all sorry. I DOUBT IT.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:46 am | David C. 

If murders have a chance at probation and those in Wall Street who brought our economy to the ground received bonuses instead of jail time have a second chance than what makes us think that Vick does not deserve it? Enough with the self righteousness!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:46 am | Reggie 

In America we do believe in second chances, but we don&apos;t usually offer them to people who molest or abuse children and the elderly, or cause harm to animals. There is a difference between forgiveness and trusting. I just can&apos;t trust someone who conscience would allow them to commit one of those acts, there&apos;s no telling what they would do.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:46 am | Joe Buscher 

Tony,
I have been an avid sports fan all my life, but recent actions involving sports figures just make me sick. Yes people deserve a second chance, but in Vick&apos;s case it&apos;s just all about winning. So he spends some time in jail for doing something against the law. He is an active partcipant in torturing dogs. Electrocution, hanging, burying them alive-clearly this isn&apos;t shoplifting....Then he gets out and signs not for the league minimum, but for $1.5 million. at my present salary I will work 15 years to earn that much money...Look at Dante Stallworth..He killed a guy, was convicted of some type of manslaughter and served 24 days...24 days....Why do we cherish athletes...They get a free ride...It&apos;s unfair, unjust, and possibly immoral. It makes me sick.–

What I would consider to have been Mr. Vick&apos;s top priority and very FIRST words out of hi mouth would have been to appoligize to the NFL, his fans, animal lovers and all of the American public. He had the perfect forum and coverage but all I heard was I -I–I. It also sounded like he did not feel the two years in prision was necessary.
He blew his first chance in the NFL, blew the chance to say&quot;I&apos;m sorry&quot;when it would have appeared to mean something and he lost my support.
The super stars in sports make enough money to fund a small country and so many give nothing back to the people that make their way of life possible. Our priorities are mis-placed.
Maybe he should have to get a job in the real world and try to buy a ticket to an Eagles game. Maybe then he would see how really well off he is.
If I somehow missed his appoligy then I am sorry and good luck to Mr. Vick.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:46 am | E. Burton 

As I read the comments that many of you posted my heart grew very sad. My prayer is that all of you who have no forgiveness in you will see the error of your ways. Michael Vick will have to face his God, but what makes so many of you so perfect to judge. If you choose not to watch a NFL game so be it. I just think the world would be a better place if we practiced love rather than hate. Love animals but love people as well. Everyone can change and all of us have made mistakes.

I&apos;m not a Vick fan but congrats to him. I&apos;m appalled at the hypocricy that some are displaying. We can forgive, parole, and pardon for much more heinous crimes such as murder but we can&apos;t give a guy a chance for a lesser crime. Wonder how that attitude fits in our Christian standards?
 August 14, 2009 at 11:47 am | JoAnne 

Regarding Vick....I believe most people do deserve a second chance, but what he did to those dogs was heinous. If he had abused a child, would he be given a second chance? I realize most people believe animals don&apos;t have the same rights as humans, but those of us who love, respect and appreciate them and have them as members of our families, feel very differently. Since Vick is being given a second chance, he should be required to make a LARGE donation (when he receives a salary) or ongoing donations to the ASPCA as well as work with an organization which helps/protects animals. Also, aren&apos;t people who abuse animals more likely to abuse humans?
 August 14, 2009 at 11:47 am | mildred 

Tony / Dick Cheney the former vice-president, did horrible things to HUMANS Water Boarding and he has a multi-million dollar book deal. no jail time and some Americans rally around him. If he deserves a chance so does anyone who has done wrong. Are dogs more valuable that people. Are we not to do the right thing, we forgive the vice president and the former president Bush for their lies and wrong doings and cover up, but we want to hang mike with out a cross. Americans are scary and they don&apos;t see the real picture. I have never heard one apology for the mistreatment of humans. not one God help us for real, That is the real issue. Vick has said he was sorry doing things to rectify what happened and we need to learn to forgive. I do not forgive the president or vice president for what they did wrong and all their lies. Go and do well Micheal Vick/ Win EAGLES! GOd Help AMERICANS
 August 14, 2009 at 11:47 am | Avagay 

I certainly believe that Michael Vick deserves a second chance, we are all imperfect human beings that make mistakes in life and have regrets. The good thing though is that Vick has acknowledge his mistakes and is now is the process of redefining himself and is contributing his time and efforts to fight against dog fighting and animal cruelty. He has learn&apos;t his lesson and paid his dues to society, and is now looking toward a brighter and positive future.

*P.S. What would life be like if no one was ever given second chances?
 August 14, 2009 at 11:47 am | Maryann 

Everyone deserves a second chance, with conditions. My choice for one of his conditions is that he spend a specific amount of time weekly/monthly in an animal rescue shelter and work hands-on with damaged and abandoned animals. This would not be advocating for others to volunteer and otherwise be nice to animals, but for him to be working with animals himself. Walk the talk: it would reinforce the importance of humanity, could be a boost to shelters in general because of his “down-in-the-trenches” involvement in spite of fame, and allow him to be an exceptional role model to youth who right now think dog-fighting is a manly thing do to.

 August 14, 2009 at 11:48 am | Brandon from VA 

I Love Mick Vick, I am not excusing anything he did because it was wrong whether or not that is part of some peoples lives, Pitbulls are natural aggressive dogs and many people fight them still that does not make it right. But he was caught for it, he was extremely punished for it more than what a regular joe like me or anyone else would he paid his dues, is still paying and will still be paying but who is anyone to judge that man and say terrible things about him and say he shouldn&apos;t play the sport he loves anymore he totally paid his due let that man be and let that man play. How is what he did anymore worst than Dante Stallworth he was DRUNK AND HIGH, KILLED a man and ONLY spent 30 days in jail and no one seems to be making a big deal about that and no one seems to be making a big deal of the fact that the commisioner has only suspened him for one year with no pay. Don&apos;t get me wrong that is tough but it should not even be an option of him even thinking about coming back to the league but he may and he should also get a second chance with many restrictions as should Vick but how why such the hate for Vick more than Stallworth? I&apos;m not going to speak on racism because these two men are black but Vick only killed some dogs.....come on now Stallworth killed a man with a family so if you are not going to make your complaints on everyone in the league who have done worst things let it be. And I didn&apos;t even mention Roethlisberger or Ray Lewis or Jamal Lewis. Michael Vick stay strong and show everyone watching your true worth......Go Vick!!!!!

If an individual is taking necessary steps in rehabilitation, demonstates an honest effort in righting the wrong, and displays sincere remorse in their actions, then and ONLY then do I feel a person deserve an opportunity to prove themselves. Show me a person who walks on water. Until you do, i feel everyone deserves a second chance in life!!
 August 14, 2009 at 11:48 am | DogsMeanMoreThanFootball 

Re: Vick
-Doesn&apos;t seem sincere, DOESN&apos;T matter–this involved the biggest celeb yet in the dog-fighting issue, brought the issue repeatedly into prime-time, and Vick MUST continue maintain his push and money against it.
-He&apos;s a football player–D-players will gladly try to knock him out, bloody him... in big games–injure him to the point he can&apos;t play,&apos;cause he&apos;s a game-changer, and this is the game america pays to see. If you want a saint, go to church–be real.
-Philly is brilliant. as his 2nd chance team, he&apos;ll be totally at their command–any slip-ups, he&apos;s out of the NFL (so Eagles c/b&quot;good cop&quot;and still count on NFL&apos;s policing Vick). Third chance... CFL–not with Vick&apos;s rep... behaving beats all heck out of learning to speak... Italian?&apos;pays better, too.
So I think we should get behind Vick, not because he seems contrite, but because his celeb status in one of the world&apos;s most followed leagues will result in huge positive effects for a species who has come through for us for centuries.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:49 am | Diana M 

Whoever thinks that race is not in this at all is delusional. The use of&quot;thug&quot;by some is testament to that. Okay, he committed a crime and paid for it. If he was white, would people be calling him a thug? Because there are plenty of people who commit crimes that are not thugs but just criminals. It is called the language of hate with new cue words.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:49 am | Larry Preston 

Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.
Of course Mr. Vick deserves a second chance. He went to prison, paid his debt and should now be able to come back and play ball without further punishment.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:49 am | Christopher Columbus 

I can see this is a very controversial topic. With that being said I feel if Michael Vick was not such a visible target he would not have served almost two years for hurting animals. I mean come on us as Americans have @ various times in our history obliterated entire cities in foreign countries killing 100&apos;s of thousands of Humans. The US has killed, conquered, and enslaved entire races (groups) of people for whatever purpose they see fit. There is a socio-economic dispasrity that is clearly in favor of certain groups of people in this country etc, etc, etc.

But yet we want to demonize a man who has admittingly made a mistake and apperars @ least in the early stages, is trying to make it right.

Please give him a chance you might be suprised just what you call an ex-con can acheive if given the opprtunity and support.

Tony,
I think that scumbag should never be paid by professional football given that he&apos;s simply a felon! However, a comment about you...

During the Prof. Gates affair, you ranted on tv as if you knew all the facts... let me remind you that you&apos;re simply a newsreader and not a journalist nor very well educated from what it seems and you simply come off as a disc jockey. Your huffs and puffs about racial discrimination was completely off the mark. In fact, Prof. Gates was the agitator and the Sergeant was just doing his job and kudos to the police department in Cambridge for standing up for the officer!...

Perhaps you can do yours and read the news and leave the professional punditry to erudite and educated professionals who know what they&apos;re talking about and don&apos;t simply rant like you...Your hubris or temerity is neither wanted nor expected

What were the Philadelphia Eagles thinking? What was the NFL thinking? What are the sponsors thinking?
I can tell you about our culture, there are millions of households in this country where dogs are a major part of the households and reign supreme.
This household will for the next two years will not watch a game in which the Eagles play and will avoid products that sponsor this lack of unacceptable behavoirs by Vick, the NFL, the Philadelphia Eagles, and any current or future sponsors.

I don&apos;t understand this severe backlash against Michael Vick. He has already served his sentence. In a country who is supposed to be compassionate, it is ironic to see that we treat this person more severely for being cruel to animals than those who abort unborn children. Our priorities are skewed.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:50 am | lena 

it&apos;s good to see miachael vick get a second chance. situations like this deserves second chances. but the line should be drown on rapists and murders. i&apos;m happy mike is back. i believe him when he said he&apos;s sorry.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:50 am | Llewellyn Cobb 

Man&apos;s best friend.. Only if you never had a realization of the companionship of a dog could you hang or drown one. Vick, has killed and tortured anamals and has no compassion and he does not deserve to do anything dogs or cats or public. Man&apos;s best friend to white and black alike. And how either can forget what he has done is beyond me.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:50 am | JT 

Let Michael Vick go to work, he has served his time... What I find offensive is people are more concerned about dogs than they are about other human beings. That the insensitivity is so bad that a US company can have an African American baby with&quot;lil monkey&quot;on her cap, while seated in the mist of other offensive images, produced and then its purchased by an major store chain and placed on their floor for sale in Greensboro, NC (where Civil Rights lunch counter protests began) ... and no one thought that anyone would be offended just because they had no intent to convey a racial slur.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:50 am | Jerry 

Although his crime was rather heinous, Mike Vick paid his debt to society and should be allowed to make a living. What would his critics suggest, he work as a cashier at a fast-food restaurant for the rest of his life? Or, pursue a life of crime like so many other convicted felons do upon release from prison? He&apos;s a football player, and a great one at that. Unless there is a law that prohibits him from playing in the NFL, leave the guy alone and let him play.

Have a sign on my TV&quot;s that states:

&quot;MEAN VICIOUS INDIVIDUAL CANINE KILLER&apos;

No one allowed to view any Pro-Football games in this household.

Will boycott all sponsors and their products!

Will concede if Vick donates half his salary to the SPCA.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:51 am | Dawn 

Well, it is a tragedy all around, but personally I think that when Vick is finished with his football season, win or lose, that he spend all his offtime at DogTown..the TLC program that films of people rehabilitating dogs on the 33,000 acre complex. Will give a new meaning to&quot;gone to the dogs&quot;.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:51 am | WeAreFamily 

I am a fan of all the teams in the NFL. I think Philadelphia has just took a leap in the NFL in a very important teaching moment for sports in our country. It is with my sincerest hope that Michael Vick remain true to himself, family, friends, and fans. I loved his statement that we as people fear the unknown. He must always remember that fear can be positive in ones life or it can be negative. If Mike had used this fear in the outset of his career he very well may not have had to make this appearance today because fear would have re-routed his behavior. Lastly, he has convienced me to become a member of the humane society.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:51 am | Dinah B. 

Different crimes deserve, different times... I do believe that M. V. , did serve the time that he was granted in the court system. He is now a free man, and when&quot;any&quot;man gets out of prison they usually will seek employment which is usually work that they have done in the past. He is a football player, an NFL football player at that so COMMON SENSE would tell anyone that is the&quot;work&quot;that he does to take care of himself and his family. People who dont think he should be able to play are PLAYER HATERS.... I myself am a CONGRATULATOR..... I congratulate him for admitting his wrong doings, serving his time,and going on with his life despite of what MAN thinks... everyone is entitled to their own opinions... but they dont really matter.... I am sure that Mike prayed about some day playing again... sometimes God will open a door and sometimes He will close them and in this case God opened the door to allow him another chance... I wish him the best success but I do hope that he will be of a testimony to other people of how he made a mistake, of how he did the crime and had to serve the time, and the consequences hes had to face because of his actions.. My mother always said you sometimes have to go through a mess to have a message for people...

And this is a message for us all... If God is for me, who can be against me.. I truely wish him the best in life and pray that he will continue to be humble and not take advantage of the many blessings that hes been given in life.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:52 am | Cathy, Md. 

Everyone makes mistakes. I believe Michael Vick committed a crime and was locked up and has paid for what he did. We can&apos;t assume that he is the same person that he was 2yrs ago. .We have to give him a chance to prove to us that he has learned his lesson and will work hard to change his ways. Time will tell.

he can&apos;t&quot;get&quot;it–he never wou.d I hope his critics will forgive and give him a second chance at life -not just at football.

MICHAEL VICK WAS CONVITED OF A HORRIBLE CRIME! DOES HE DESERVE A SECOND CHANCE???

ONE THING HE SHOULD DO TO TRY AND REDEEM HIMSELF WOULD BE TO SPEAK OUT ABOUT HIS CRIME. GO INTO THE SCHOOLS AND TELL THESE KIDS THAT IT IS A BAD THING TO FIGHT DOGS AND ALL ANIMALS! VICK IS A ROLE MODEL FOR ALOT OF YOUNG BOYS. I BELIEVE HE COULD HELP SOCIETY AND HIMSELF AT THE SAME TIME,,,,,
 August 14, 2009 at 11:53 am | Barbara 

Why not, he has serve his time for an awful crime to animals. But Jesus gives us all a second change, third, so let&apos;s be happy for him because most black men/women/ in the system do not get a second change compare to others for a lessor crime. He is very bless because there are so many black males and women too that don&apos;t get that change to start a new life after making a bad choice.

Good Luck,
Micheal Vick

I think it is wonderful that M. Vick is back in the NFL. I think he does deserve a second chance, he paid his debt to society. Yes he tortured some dogs PETA acts like he killed people. They need to get a life.I am tired of the double standard of law. One law for whites and another for blacks. Wake up America!!!! We all have sinned. If the media would let it go then some of this up roar would die down. Look at the guy that has been accused of rape how much have you heard about that?? Leave M. Vick alone and let him live his life he is a free man.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:53 am | Dr.WilsonII 

I think society if focusing on the wrong thing. It is easy to say someone should not get a second chance in a job such as a professional football player. Feeling of jealousy cause a sense of bias from the judgmental people of society. It stops being about a man getting a second chance, and starts being about a man stepping out of jail and becoming a millionaire again. People don&apos;t care about him getting a second chance, they really care about him getting a two year multimillion dollar chance. Jealousy is a sickness, and these jealous people are in need of universal health care.. GET WELL SOON....
 August 14, 2009 at 11:54 am | Michael 

Should everyone be given a second chance. The answer to that is easy, No. Some people simply have psychological pathogenesis that makes them do what they do and if given a second chance they would do it again (e.g. child molesters). Assuming Vick is not a psychopath and his enjoyment of torturing dogs was just bad judgment, then he would deserve a second chance (to make millions of dollars in the NFL). However, I think the Eagles are more about winning games and Vick is more about playing and making millions again, and given the chance that he would not face consequences for dog fighting again, he&apos;d do it! Just listen to his own response, he wants to makeup for the number of dogs he has hurt or killed, no more. It&apos;s a tough world we live in.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:55 am | Peggy 

What makes me upset, is not that people should get a second chance, but often celebrities and politicians who really screw up become heros to the very young. I won&apos;t deny anyone from making a living, but there should be line drawn as to who we as a society promote to&quot;idols&quot;and&quot;heroes&quot;.
 August 14, 2009 at 11:55 am | Randy Twells 

Re: 2nd chance for Michael Vick: I have not heard anyone address this specific part of the issue: I have not heard any of MV&apos;s expressions of his own feelings if those have been made public, other than the news conference this a.m. in which he stated that the dog fighting was in his assessment,&quot;unnecessary&quot;and&quot;a pointless activity&quot;and blamed his peer influences that he allowed to shape his attitude that&quot;it&apos;s just a part of our culture&quot;. He did acknowledge that was no excuse at all, and said&quot;if he helps more animals than he hurts&quot;then he feels he can hopefully make it up or improve his bottom line with the public, seemed to be the gist. What I do not hear and want to hear however is, that he has reshaped his thinking about his treatment of those animals and the whole sport in general from the standpoint of the animals&apos;perspective being on the receiving end–does it now horrify him in retrospect? Does he cringe at the pain and suffering that he caused? Does he have empathy for the individual creature as a defenseless animal whose trust he betrayed? Does he put himself in their place and not ever want to be the source of that kind of cruelty to any living thing ever again? Did he go through that process and has now moved on, but we just have not been privy to the process? Genuine empathy for the victim is an important factor in assessing a perpetrator&apos;s core thinking. Just&apos;doing time&apos;doesn&apos;t inject that character quality. I do not see that puzzle piece and hope that it is in there someplace. Thanks for letting me ask.–Randy

I listened to Michael Vick via CNN, and I truly entered the viewing with an open mind. I heard him say&quot;he knows what he did was wrong&quot;and similar statements.

What was lacking for me was the feeling in his statements, i.e. real contrition, remorse, sorrow. If he could ever get to the feeling of how horrific it must have been to watch dogs, trained to kill one another, for a crowded room of people, he would benefit from that heart-felt realization.

These people, including Vick, had to be so shut off from their feelings that they could lay bets on these dogs lives. If he could show a real feeling-sense of that heartbreaking reality, then I would be convinced.

Yes, he did jail time. That is a start. He admitted that he is not in shape mentally or physically to be a starter this year. I say, use that time to voluntarily do community service in an on-hands way.

From his press conference, I gleened that he has&quot;learned&quot;that it was wrong via imprisonment, but I did not gleen that he felt true sorrow for the animals who suffered so greatly.

I am willing to give Michael Vick a second chance if he does not forget, just become swept back into the NFL ,and skip the real act of contrition. That act would be to volunteer his time, not money, time working with sheltered dogs waiting to be rescued to good homes.

I believe this gesture would not only serve abused, neglected dogs, but it might help Michael Vick to actually feel the true horror for himself.
It will make him a better human being. It will make him a better Pro
ball player. It will make him a better future friend, husband, father, and American.

Let me first say I am an animal lover to my heart. I was appauled at what Michael Vick was involved in when it happened. However, I do believe in second chances to prove he has changed. But only one more chance. I am just sceptical at someone&apos;s heart changing. I just don&apos;t understand someone having in them to kill an animal for nothing, just to kill it and having no remorse. Having said that, someone please explain to me the rationality between the time Vick served for animal cruelty and Dante Stallworth&apos;s sentence, or lack there of, for killing an innocent man as a direct result of his being under the influence. Money payment to the victim&apos;s family should have nothing to do with it. He should certainly have severed time as well. There is something not quite right with this picture.

&quot;j&quot;gangster speak&quot;you ppl who sayin vick&quot;is real convincing ..
he will likely be a dog killer someday.

I agree that what Mr.Vick did was wrong, but I am glad that he is back in the NFL. He is not a role model for my children. Kids lshould ook up to their parents as role models, not to someone on tv. It&apos;s up to parents to teach their children right from wrong. You are not being a lazy parent if you let someone else do that job for you. I am a Falcons fan, but now I am also an Eagles fan! I am a fan of any team who has guts like that! I will be at the GA Dome on December 6th to cheer for Vick. Go EAGLES&amp;GO MIKE VICK!!!!!!

Toney,
Maybe I was overly zealous in my remarks.Was holding my two puppies when I made that statement.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:02 pm | DogsMeanMoreThanFootball 

If you&apos;re christian, then you must know God has and will judge Vick–we don&apos;t need to, nor is it our place to do His job. After all, no human-imposed punishment/reward could approach His.
If you appreciate the dog&apos;s contribution to our species: as a guard, as a guide, as a worker, as a companion, then lets hope Vick, in our earthly world, will commit to becoming a guardian angel for–OK, I&apos;ll say it, (Hu)mans&apos;best friend.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:03 pm | Al Allen 

It was wrong and he done more time than the crime was worth when people called pit bull baby killer no one cared about the dog but to fight it until the dog whisper come TV and he had such a nice cum pit bull that made things worser for Vick.If you have money you can kill people with your car are guns and get less time or no time that shows you how the world has gotting so cunfused mentaley, when animals are getting killed everyday but if you run over deers and shot kill horses to make dog food kill gray hounds dogs after they can&apos;t win races chasing plastic rabbits etc. It&apos;s time for the man to get on with his life and help the eagles win the super bowl.

Thanks Tony H....
I am very much concern that we are not giving Michael Vick a fair chance after serving his conviction of the law. He is deserving of another chance regardless of his celebrated status as a football star. We should as a people that mirror ourselves after GOD... be forgiven. GOD forgives us many times everyday for sins that we commits against each other, and we are forgiven daily. Michael Vick should not have to answer to man (woman) about a cime that he has remorsefully expressed to all American and his GOD. Let show love to Michael. IF we are really true children of GOD?... and to all you haters, you should be more forgiving and loving...and that all you should get behind Vick to make him a better man. I am saying develop a positve attitude toward GOD&apos;s children.

Hello.. I do agree with Asim regarding the killing of black men... but also I understand that we are in a time where bad means good and good means bad.. Wow.
In addition, should Mike Vike get a second chance? In regards to playing football, yes, being the owner of dogs, no. Mike second chance does not relate to football it relates to dogs...understand the question.. He didn&apos;t kill anyone in football. Its funny most or all of the responses I have read are more racially motivated, then serious.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:06 pm | Gail Green 

I do believe Mr. Vick is entitled to a second chance. I had hoped more would have been said in the press conference with regards to details of how he is now helping the Humane Society to educate others regarding the humane treatment of all animals. Perhaps a public pledge of his time and money to this cause would further his rehabilitation and my belief in his sincerity. Time will tell if he has truly changed for the better.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:07 pm | Shirin 

Shame on you TONY–TALK ABOUT VICKS ABUSE ON THE DOGS!!! Don&apos;t get on his side because he is black and you are black, sickens me!
 August 14, 2009 at 12:08 pm | Chapman 

I think we&apos;ve all done things we truely regret. I also feel that if people weren&apos;t given a second chance half of us would not be successful today. Everyone deserves an opportunity to prove that they can be rehabilitative.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:09 pm | DogsMeanMoreThanFootball 

throwing one last thought into the mix–there is positive history for second chances in Major American sports, and not only in football. In some cases, perhaps the discipline these sports require just to play, (and, in football, stay in one piece), have made offenders as young men become Major positive contributors after growing and realizing.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:09 pm | WilldThrill 

Dear Tony, watched the&quot;live&quot;event and this does NOT pass the&quot;sniff test for me. Tony Dungy is obviously a great man but Michael Vick...a man without a conscience–sociopaths weld to whatever environment they&apos;re in...

This is more about The Eagles and the bottom line, in my opinion.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:10 pm | VencetiA 

MVick as a right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. What moron in his right mind is so unforgiving, not to consider another human being being given another chance. Someday you will want forgiveness and it won&apos;t be given. I&apos;m sure there is no perfect human who , never broke the law, never did anything evil or wrong. . Besides, Why is it the same people to want to persecute MVick condone boxing, kick-boxing, wrestling etc... (man-fighting) like dogs in a ring where many boxers die from their injuries? These wonderful activitiess are supported and banked by elete individuals and the blood thirstypaying customers want more, and more. Oh that&apos;s right, the life of a human is less valuable than a dog. Murder a person and get probation or 2 months in jail a slap on the wrist. But let a dog die at the hands of someone and you people want the electic chair or a person condemned for life. How unjust and pitiful is the mind of the corrupt. I guess our men in Iraq , Afghanistan and other war torn areas being killed in&quot;DOG FIGHTS&quot;doesn&apos;t matter. Who is bank rolling that?Who is betting against the USA? Who is wanting justice in those murders. It is noticeable in this country we have an ethnicity problem. Who introduced dog fighting, cock fighting, or fighting in general? MANKIND. We who know the truth,, stand by it. Give a man the right to be free, there is one judge and we are not him. The seed you sow, will grow up into a great field and many evil words and things will come back to those who think they are above any other man, be it by race, creed or color. Manson was an idiot, demon possed blood thirsty murderer of humans. Dogs are not humans, but some humans act like dogs, always barking about nothing,laying around waiting to be waited on by a human. You can take them to the Vet. shower them bubble bath them, dress them up,make them do tricks and even watch out for your safety, but the bottom line is it&apos;s a DOG. If you and a dog were drowing, in a fire, in a shootout, who would YOU rather take the fall YOU or the DOG? Thanks so much for understanding.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:11 pm | Walt Myers 

I guess the Eagles are going to be renamed the Pit Bulls. The new logo will be two pit bulls tryint to rip out each others throat.
What Vick did is unpardonable!
 August 14, 2009 at 12:11 pm | rob 

Vick is a scumbag. I can&apos;t believe this is news. I won&apos;t be watching any Eagles games this season and I&apos;m switching channels everytime CNN mentions this psychopath.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:11 pm | Sarah Wiley 

There is not doubt that Vick will prove himself on the field. We just have to wait and see if walk the walk off the field in the community.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:11 pm | Neil 

In order for us to trust in a second chance, we must first give the opportunity for a second chance. Let&apos;s give Michael Vick the second chance, then we can truly gauge his and our hearts.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:12 pm | Claire Rusk 

What he did was horrible but in this country you are supposed to pay your debt and then get on with your life. There are players in the NFL who have killed and abused people! He should get a second chance.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:12 pm | Pam 

Michael Vick has done his time. Who are we to judge him...if God can forgive me, then we can too.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:12 pm | Zee 

Good for Vick and kudos to the Eagles for recognizing that people make mistakes and can change their lives for the better. Maybe if most felons in our society with the exception of a few hardcore ones, can be given a second chance, our communities maybe safer since they can get employment and stay off the streets.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:12 pm | TC Bandit 

Tony,

It&apos;s not like the guy is going to work at PETCO! Relax people! Your pooches are safe.

Mike served his time and he&apos;s going to play for the Eagles to provide for his family. Sheez!

Michael Vick is contrite, he is&quot;trying&quot;to learn a better way to live. We have politicians who have abused their position, defrauded the American People and escaped even censure from the very political body which they were part of when doing it. The NFL has set a great example, no matter how good you are or how elite you may be considered, you are not above punishment. Let the man play.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:13 pm | Al 

I think he did his time and was punished. Why can&apos;t we learn to forgive, and don&apos;t we expect to be forgiven?
 August 14, 2009 at 12:13 pm | Shawn 

People let&apos;s be serious here for a second. Michael Vick has served his dues to society, and went to jail for 2 years for killing an animal, you know what else is an animal? The chicken in your chicken sandwich or the cow in your cheeseburger. Frankly they&apos;re treated cruely in the farms in which they are raised in too. Michael Vick truly seems remorseful and from a football standpoint this is a great signing which gives the Eagles offense a whole new dynamic. As a lifelong Eagles fan and Philadelphia resident I stand 100% by this signing and wish Michael Vick sucess in the future.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:13 pm | Michael 

Michael Vick committed a crime, he was convicted, he served his sentence, he is now a free man, free to do whatever he pleases, provided it is within the confines of the law. In America that is how the system works.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:13 pm | Wade 

He did his time in jail but I think his NFL career should be over. Since it looks like he will play again it is up to Football consumers to boycott the team.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:13 pm | Jreed 

Too bad the Dallas Cowboys didn&apos;t get him....we need a QB
 August 14, 2009 at 12:13 pm | c.f. bowen 

Why a second chance for Vick? No dog in his care was given that option and I believe Vick&apos;s only regret is that he and his miserable co-hearts were caught. The NFL and the Eagle organization should be ashamed for the message they are sending to young people.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:13 pm | Vicki Lewis 

Tony,

I&apos;ve seen people forgive their pit bulls after the dog has ravaged their child! This is not about what Michael Vick did but rather, who he is- A Black man in America. There are people in this country that love their animals more than they love people of other races!! Sad!!
 August 14, 2009 at 12:14 pm | Rachel Donovan Parcell 

I am huge animal lover and I do think what Michael Vick did was wrong but I believe that everyone makes mistakes and learns from them and I think that if he were just some average guy working an everyday job he wouldn&apos;t be treated so harshly,he&apos;d be back at that job with no questions asked.I don&apos;t think someone should be held back from doing something they love and are highly talented at just because of a mistake they made in their personal life no matter how big or small and I wish him luck with the Eagles.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:14 pm | ROBERT DEININGER 

WHAT&apos;S HAPPENED TO AMERICANS,WE USE TO FORGIVE,IT SEEMS NOW WE WOULD RATHER DESTROY A MAN THAN GIVE HIM A SECOND CHANCE,I AM GLAD THERE STILL ARE GOOD PEOPLE AROUND,LIKE THE EAGLES SEEM TO HAVE,WITHOUT THEM OUR JAILS WOULD BE BURSTING AT THE SEEMS WITH 2 AND 3RD OFFENDERS,IF YOU CANT WORK AFTER DOING YOUR TIME,NOTHINGS LEFT BUT CRIME......
 August 14, 2009 at 12:14 pm | Thom 

Tony, I like and have had many pets over my 60 years, but it amazes me the outrage expressed by people over this issue of a man who paid his debt, expressed his regrets and intentions to reform, while everyday thousands of babies are aborted and our society accepts these victims with little uproar in comparison. If only we valued all life as much as our pets.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:14 pm | Paula L. Gibson 

This question is agonizing. On one hand, dog fighting and killing is an unspeakable, terrible crime. I love animal and cant image what heart a person who fights dogs must have, if they even have one. On the other hand, Vick has been punished by going to jail and being forced to file bankruptcy which will follow him for the next 10 years. I think about a guy who used to be the mail clerk at a place I used to work. He had done time for murder and now was released and working. He was the most conscientious worker in the place. That was over 26 years ago, certainly in today&apos;s life, he would not have gotten a second chance. Vick does have to be a productive member of society and by denying him the opportunity to choose his employment we are potentially returning him to the criminal life as a means of survival. For that reason, I would say give him a chance. But if he messes up again, may the devil help him.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:14 pm | Darien K. Carter 

Tony, You really need to pick your battles, it is time out for Black on Black crime (You allowing yourself to be used by the white establishment to report on a highly visible Black Man) Shame on you!!! a dogs life is worth NOTHING, it doen&apos;t even have a soul !!!!! Why aren&apos;t folks like PETA get their sorry behinds out of their chairs and go make some noise about the Japanese killing whales, I suppose that they are afraid of the real issues. You are part of the reason African Americans in high places are having such a rough time. The media keeps mess going, I wonder what youand others in your profession are hiding. SHAME SHAME SHAME.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:14 pm | Jimmy Cox 

Look, I&apos;m tired of people equating animals having/needing the same rights as human beings. Vick has paid his dues to society and it shouldn&apos;t interfere with him playing the game. I commend the Eagles for giving him a second chance.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:14 pm | Ira D Jinkins Sr 

Good Luck, and God Bless You!!
 August 14, 2009 at 12:14 pm | bob h 

I&apos;m a 67 year old retired male caucasian who loves dogs. In fact, my 10 year old Dachsund, Oscar, is lying down right beside me while I type this. I think it is a wonderful thing for so many people to get behind Michael Vick and help him through a terrible ordeal, even though it is an ordeal he brought upon himself by doing some horrible things to dogs. Forgiveness is one of the good things humans do to counteract some of the awful things they do. I practiced criminal law for 30years and have seen people do some lousy , stupid things. I know there will be many who will never forgive him and will want him to suffer forever for his actions. I feel sorry for these people. Michael Vick is probably in a better place with life than many of those who will continue to give him holy hell. I believe the Eagles organization and the NFL should be commended for giving him a chance to prove he is not the same person who committed all the horrble acts to dogs. Some people really do change, no matter what the cynics say.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:14 pm | Ron Hunter 

Lets not forget Vick was present when some of these dogs were tortured or hung. Anyone that can hurt or kill a defenseless animal would do the same thing to a person. The NFL has finally lost all class.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:14 pm | Dargel 

I think Michael Vick&apos;s return is the best think that had happen in NFL history. Let&apos;s just forget about the B.S politics and let the man do his job.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:15 pm | Christy 

It took a deep, special kind of evil to do the things that Michael Vick did.&quot;It&apos;s part of our culture&quot;is NO excuse for immoral and horrific things. If dogs can reach the emotional capacity of a 2 year old then they were aware of fear and pain just like a child.

I&apos;m not only ashamed of the NFL and the Philadelphia Eagles but I&apos;m ashamed of America for our willingness to let this man return to the life of wealth and glamour that is professional sports.

Did he serve his time imposed by our justice system? You bet. And he should get a chance to return to society but that means he can go get a regular job like the rest of us.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:15 pm | Donna Premici 

We all need forgiven. To God one sin is no greater that another. Sin is sin.

He accepted responsibility, realizes he was wrong, is remorseful, did his time and willing to continue to talk to youth regading this issue.

Go Eagles...... for giving him a chance.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:15 pm | Sharon 

To much is given, much is required!! Michael Vick has paid his debt, and should be given an opportunity to contribute to society. He appears to be remorseful. It&apos;s a shame that so many Philadelphians (and Americans) are against his return to society. What about all the people we [the USA] are killing in the Iraq war. My goodness, there is more uproar over dogs, than people!! And for all those animal lovers, I wonder if they would be willing to adopt all the innocent children who need homes here in America?????
 August 14, 2009 at 12:15 pm | meredith 

As awful as Michael Vicks crime was, he served his time and his crimes were not as bad as Mike Tysons who was then allowed to return to boxing. If he truly learned his lesson, then I wish him all the best.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:15 pm | Maria 

I&apos;m one of those nutty, avid Eagles fans and I say, let Vick play! He&apos;s admitted his wrongs and continues to right them. I wish him the best off and on the field. I will be rooting for him all the way. Welcome aboard Michael! E-A-G-L-E-S!
 August 14, 2009 at 12:15 pm | Rick 

I believe a lot of people would forgive Michael, if he the judge would of given him community service to work with the SPCA..
Also if he is really sorry, why doesn&apos;t he (on his own) work with the animal groups in his area. I don&apos;t see any remorse in his interviews and Thank God he&apos;s not coming to the Cowboys.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:15 pm | Emmy 

Horses die everytime as a result of the sport of horseracing but surprisingly no one says anything. Granted, Michael Vick made a huge mistake but he has paid his dues. Like the Good Teacher once said,&quot;let he who is without blemish cast the first stone!&quot;Are you that person? Let Vick have his second chance.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:16 pm | Amanda 

I just can&apos;t get the image out of my head of those poor animals being killed while fighting and then those that could not be saved and were put down. For what? For sport?

What I don&apos;t get is the mentality behind it. Michael Vick had money, power, fame and a good reputation at that point- was that not enough? Second chances are fine, but I choose to live my life so that I never do something that requires me to have to have a second chance like this.

These poor animals were a pawn in a very wealthy man&apos;s game. You don&apos;t see the Peyton Mannings of the world pulling this. You can be rich and an athlete and not stoop to this level. This is not just directed at Vick, but all the NFL athletes who choose to break the law. There are too many good college players out there who can come replace them.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:16 pm | Jill 

I love football and animals. My dog is the light of my life. I also believe in second chances. I do hope he is sincere. I would be curious to know if there are any conditions at all to his return. For instance a portion of his earnings being donated to the ASPCA. I think that would be a great gesture on his part.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:16 pm | Jeffrey Knudsen 

Yes Vick should have a 2nd chance - at doing something else. Does some convicted financial wizard get to go back to Wall St once they are out of prison? Does a doctor, lawyer or even a hair dresser get to keep their license once convicted? Do the 1,000 people released before Vick and the 1,000 people after him all get to go back to what they left as if nothing happened.? What about you Tony? Would you still have your job if you got a felony conviction?? Vick is worth a lot of money to a lot of people. If you want to know what is wrong with anything- follow the money!
 August 14, 2009 at 12:16 pm | Kylerock 

Mike vick is one of the best running qb&apos;s in the NFL if not the best ever and he deserves a second chance to prove himself , if he does not produce he won&apos;t play that is up to him which is how it should be.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:17 pm | Joe 

Yes, it was a bad thing that Mr. Vick did but why not forgive him. Do we send hunters that keep game heads on their wall to prison? No mostly we praise them . is it n ot the same thing? Meaning hurting animals.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:17 pm | Joseph Williams 

People seem to forget that Vicks crime was about animals. He did the time and should be allowed to return to his life and for the time he was in jail he could have been on house arrest and saved us some money but we in the USA love to keep the jails full. How many American carry a hunting license and a gun and hang the kill on the wall. Do they belong in jail.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:17 pm | keith 

Michael Vick was not just a participant but the financer and KING PIN of the operation, I will be boycotting the NFL this year.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:17 pm | Bryan 

If a man pays his dept to society should&apos;nt that man be free to rebuild his life and provide for his family? There have been much worse issues within the NFL that did not recieve this type of media frenzy. Ray Lewis- 2nd degree attemped MURDER( Where was the public out cry then?) and what about Jamal Lewis?( He served a summer in jail on a conspiracy to sell COCAINE charge) Let this man rebuild his life. There are far worse issues affecting our country.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:18 pm | Ash 

Certainly, he must be given a second chance. Everyone deserves it. He has served his time and is working with animal rights organizations to advocate better treatment of animals. What more can a human being do ?He is bankrupt and He is doing all that he can to undo the wrongs. I don&apos;t understand what some people who just keep yelling might get by driving this man out of his livelihood. On one hand they say that its an unpardonable crime (which it is- but Jesus wants us to love and forgive) and at the same time many of these people are turning a blind eye to the genocide going on in many parts of the world. No voice is being raised to pressure the current administration to do something about the genocide in Darfur–atleast not as much attention as this issue has raised. Does this say something about our country–&quot;Its OK as long as its not in my backyard&quot;attitude.
God Bless America !!
 August 14, 2009 at 12:18 pm | Moses, NJ 

In response to Sharon, “we need to treat dogs like a child.” I can remember the European society treating black children like dogs; with no punishment or jail time… WOW, and this is only fact. Let him build a life for himself.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:18 pm | John 

I would like to be a defensive player on a team that&apos;s playing against
Vick . To be able to legally slam him to the ground and not get arrested
would be great . This one&apos;s for the dogs that you electrocuted while
grinning wildly .
 August 14, 2009 at 12:18 pm | Sue Cecil 

It takes a pretty sick mind to do what Vic did and no amount of time in jail, mental hospital or anywhere else is going to cure it. He does not need to be honored he needs to be shunned.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:18 pm | Christine M 

Vic doesn&apos;t present as a man who has true empathy for animals he hurt, or true remorse. He can parrot the words we expect to hear, but he does say he never thought about it, or never cared about (sic) animal welfare, but now he knows people care about their pets. He doesn&apos;t get it, emotionally, is my sense. He gets it somewhat dimly on an intellectual level. A person can get punished, but punishment does not make a person grow a conscience. 2nd chance? Yes. Cautiously? Absolutely.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:19 pm | Denise Troup 

Vick does not deserve a second chance in pro football. He blew it. His second chance should be to get another job and work. Should we then give Madoff a second chance in financing?
 August 14, 2009 at 12:19 pm | Fred J. Van Den Hende 

Dogfighting is so closely identified with gang culture that I think it is wrong to let Vick back in the NFL where he can be viewed as a hero by young people who are vulnerable to the allure of the gang culture in their own communities. We all make mistakes in our lives...we occasionally do things that are uncharacteristic of who we really are. Often these are things we do in the heat of the moment or in response to a particular circumstance or passion in our lives. However, inappropriate activites or behaviors we engage in on a regular basis are not mistakes,,,they are character flaws that are indicative of the kind of person we truly are. Often, these aspects of our lives continue until we are caught and have no choice but to express remorse and contrition...whether sincere or merely feigned to get back something we have lost. Everyone is entitled to a second chance, but some chances are more or less appropriate than others.

 August 14, 2009 at 12:19 pm | Paula L. Gibson 

One more point. I got an email today from the ASPCA which indicated that a lawsuit has been filed to enforce Leona Hemsley&apos;s will which left several millions to her dog. The executors are refusing to comply with the will because the beneficiary is a dog. Leona&apos;s will was a demonstration of her love for animals, and in her death we want to deny that to her. Vick did something very terrible to animals and we want to hold that against him for life. As a society, we need to make some decision as to where we stand on the question of animal rights.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:19 pm | henry 

What Mr. Vick did with those animals was definitly wrong, we all know that. He should have another chance to play in the NFL. Lets go back a few years with Martha Stewad, she lied to the feds probably cost some people money with the information she had. She still has a tv show, sells her things in Kmart and other locations, and everyday peopole go buy her merchandise. So wat is the problem that Vick gets a contract to continue w his life?
 August 14, 2009 at 12:19 pm | Rebecca 

I feel deep pain inside when I think of what those innocent
dogs went through. They were born innocent and remained
innocent until Michael Vick came into their life. The only way he can
make up this animal abuse is to work directly with
helping the humane society with part of his salary going directly to
them......pledging openly to save the lives of other dogs/cats throughout the United States.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:19 pm | Murithi, CA 

I am a brand new Eagles fan who will cheer Vick. Let him play!
 August 14, 2009 at 12:19 pm | laura 

The Eagles have shown extremely poor judgement in signing Vick. I&apos;ve always supported the Eagles, but it&apos;s the end of the line for me. I hope my Giants squish them!
 August 14, 2009 at 12:19 pm | David 

The same thing happens in Colleges and Universities around the country–athletes think they live above rules and laws than the rest of us, and they are proven right every time. In school, football players get their choice of teachers, get better food, are treated like royalty, never get kicked out for cheating and then go into the NFL with the same attitude. Vick just proves athletes can do anything and still make millions by stepping the morality of a decent society. He took God&apos;s tame animals and turned them into fighters to the death for his entertainment–how can moral people support this kind of man in exchange for their&quot;entertainment&quot;. Vick doesn&apos;t deserve a second change at football–he deserves to rot by digging ditches. Athletes, in general, suck–that&apos;s why I never support any of their God-Like status in our society–and mainly because of their attitude that the law applies only to the rest of us. Shame shame shame on Philadelphia!!!
 August 14, 2009 at 12:19 pm | Steve in Ca 

No, No-way,I believe that everyone should get a second chance, but not for this crime. Killer-VICK (&amp;then LIE about) should have been jailed longer, but lawyer&apos;s can always make deals to save time&amp;money. Just like the Eagles are only in this to make MONEY,&amp;wouldn&apos;t give the time of day to him. Also, don&apos;t forget the only people who ask for a 2nd chance is the one that throw&apos;s the 1ST one away. He knew better. Shame on Eagles&amp;us as a nation.

Amazing....&quot;the worst crime that a human can commit&quot;...Really. What about murder, rape, etc....These people are so out of touch. I want to know how many of these SO CALLED dog lovers are HUMAN lovers. Or maybe it’s a subconsciously racial attack. I’ve only seen one type of race lashing out on VICK for his actions. Have they gone to these environments to see where these actions are taking place. INNER CITY, not suburbs.

This man LOST HIS LIFE, FAMILY for 2 YEARS. But you know, I guess EVERYONE in PHILLY, and MEDAI should get a shirt that says,&quot;I can cast the first stone.&quot;I only hope that everyone else who is putting this man down are held to the SAME level of PUBLIC disgrace&amp;accountability when their time comes.

GO VICK, I&apos;m Praying for you,

Raiders FAN

I am very happy for Mr. Vick. Unlike some people in America who clam to be perfect I myself have never met anyone in my 52 years who was perfect. We all fall short of perfect and everyone regardless of their failures deserves a second chance. Maybe if some of these people who place animals above humans would take some of that energy and try to do good towards others we wouldn&apos;t have people in town hall meetings treating each other less then human.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:20 pm | Lisa Lawrence 

I would have liked to have seen Michael do significant public work educating people on the horrors of dog fighting before he was hired by anyone.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:20 pm | Jerry Wyatt 

I am so glad for Michael Vick to be playing.For the first time in my adult life I have purchased two sports jersey&apos;s, in fact a Michael Vick jersey from the Eagles. As far as the PR is concerned it caused me to spend $160.00 and my first paying Falcon football game will be the Eagles and Michael Vick vs the Falcons Sunday December 6, 2009.

There are some people who care more about animals than people. These same people have no problem spending money to care for animals but oppose any support for poor people.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:20 pm | Vicki Summers 

First and foremost, I have always been an animal lover since I knew what animals were. My parents instilled in me the value of taking care of animals. Let me add I am also a Nurse, so I do value human life. To me, Vick&apos;s comments and&quot;feelings&quot;are rehearsed.......not real. IF he had a HEART of ANY kind he NEVER would have promoted SUCH dog fighting in the first place......so unbelievably CRUEL. He called this a&quot;sport&quot;?? All of his managers have just given him&quot;lines&quot;to say in order to clear himself, to play football and make money. He should not in any way be rewarded. Take away from HIM just as HE took away so many dogs&apos;lives......which cannot be replaced. I don&apos;t care what time he has served thus far.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:20 pm | Drew 

I watched Vick&apos;s comments and read his body language, and he was sincere. I know, I teach this technique to law enforcement. He grew up conditioned to have no consious for animals, but that has since changed. I watched him before he went to prison in court, he had no remorse, he did not get it. With the help of others and God, he has opened his heart and his mind. Although pennance will be long, it is time to give him a shot.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:20 pm | Danielle T. 

Let him who is without sin cast the first stone. Many of you should be putting your stones down! We have all made bad choices and have had to suffer the consequences. Vick made some bad choices and has suffered the consequences. He&apos;s served his time and now he must be able to move forward with his life. The Eagles are not classless for signing him, but they are showing that EVERYONE deserves second chances. Wrong is wrong and for those of who are defaming him now as a human are WRONG. For those of you who are in support of him being able to move on with his life, I agree with you.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:21 pm | Joe Campbell 

Lordy, Lordy, where were all these folks 40 years ago when they turned the dogs loose on the protesters in the South, talk about
morals!!!!! Leave Vick along, he has payed his debt.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:21 pm | mark g 

tony, some of thoes dogs did not get a second chance. dogs rule!
 August 14, 2009 at 12:21 pm | A. R. Horton, DVM, MS 

I am disgusted by the Eagles choice! Since when does being a gifted athlete excuse one from being a decent human being? Vick didn&apos;t smoke a joint of steal a car. He systematically, methodicaly, deliberately, and repeatedly engaged in the torture and murder of animals for enjoyment and profit. Am I to believe that his minimal time in prison miraculously changed this fundamental character flaw? Indifference to the suffering and misery of animals is no different than indifference to human suffering. Just like those who rape, torture and murder children, Vick is fundamentally deranged, and should never be returned to mainstream society. He cannot be rehabilitated.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:21 pm | Bea 

Michael Vick served his time and should be allowed to live his life, including having a job. If his job is playing football–good. It is sad to hear others comment that he can not be forgiven. Those who make comments like that need to take a long look at their own faults. All those who have served time in prison should have at least a second chance to be productive in society.
Personally, I think the Eagles are setting a good example.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:21 pm | Michael Mckinney (Preacher) 

Everyone deserve a second chance. God gives each of us a second ,third and fourth chance. So why do people try to condem Michael Vick for what he done. Look at the deers and the rabbits that people have as pets but end up on there dinner table. You don&apos;t here annything about that. Not saying what he did was right but who are we to judge. I only know one judge that is God. Have a bless day
 August 14, 2009 at 12:22 pm | Billy Pate 

Give the man a break he did his time what else do you want? let you that has not sinned through the first stone
 August 14, 2009 at 12:22 pm | Doris Clark 

Mr. Vick had paid a very high price for his mistake. Blessings to the Eagle&apos;s owners and coaches for making a very good decision. To all of those who do not support the Eagles decision I pray you never make a mistake or I pray your children never make a mistake. I am sure Mr. Vick will make you proud. Again thank you, I don&apos;t know the young man, but I have him in my prayers.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:22 pm | Reena 

You can&apos;t compare an animal to a child. The man received his punishment, and did the time, which I think was excessive. I have a dog and I love my dog, but I value human life more. The Bible says forgive and forget. Who are we to place judgement on someone else. Judge yourself, because I&apos;m sure you have somethings in your closet. Michael Vick, if don&apos;t no one do, I welcome you back to the game. Just learn from your mistake.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:22 pm | Mary 

I know people who have pigs for domestic pets but yet, pigs get slaughterd and ends up in grocery stores. Slaughter house owners aren&apos;t prosecuted and sent to prison. Michael Vick should never have been prosecuted or sent to prison for something that is done every day with animals. Let&apos;s make the playing field even, and I don&apos;t mean Football!
Now I understand Michael Jackson&apos;s lyrics; Leave Me Alone and Just Stop Dogging Me Around!!!
 August 14, 2009 at 12:22 pm | Khalif Ramadan 

It appears that many of the members in our society are reactionary thinkers and not reflective thinkers...if we can forgive those responsible for enslaving Africans brougth to America and move beyond that horrible treatment to make progress in civil and human rights...we should apply that faith based principle of forgivness and reconciliation to Michael Vick who has served the time ordered by the court and now wants to make a positive contribution to society....if we give society a chance to heal and make progress we can certainly give Michael Vick a chance.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:23 pm | Teri 

Tony,

Reasonable people will conclude that Michael Vick has served his time and deserves a second chance. Judgemental people would prefer to keep him down and out of the NFL. I applaud Donovan McNabb and the Eagles for extending a hand to a guy who recently got out of prison. I bet Michael Vick knows he cannot screw up again and I hope he turns his adversity into a positive outcome.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:23 pm | bigfan1974 

I am going to be upfront. If this was Peyton Manning, Kurt Warner, or any other white quarterback or player in the league they would have been forgiven and moved on. Michael Vick being a young black male who makes millions of dollars offended many Americans who values a dog life more than a black life in America. This is simply history where dogs in slavery time was treated better than black people. Its not right to harm a dog but its not right to take away this man lively hood either. He did his time and is moving on. Maybe those who want to destroy his character should think about years that white america has treated blacks in this country.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:24 pm | Lin 

Give me a break! Mr. Vick has served his time and is obviously repentent, now he needs a job. He is being employed by an organization that needs his skills. There are many organizations that hire ex-felons who have served their time and are attempting to make a new start in life. What is so different about him?
 August 14, 2009 at 12:24 pm | Patty 

Where do you begin with this about Vick? To start off, I agree with the argument that yes, Vick has served his time. Perhaps, Vick has learned from his mistake and deserves a second chance. However, I do not think this is what is at the heart of this matter by the fact that the NFL has decided to let him play again and even worse that any professional team is picking him up.

I do not feel that a person playing in a professional sport who knowingly acknowledged he was breaking the law with not one, but a dozen or more counts of cruelty to animals, gambling charges and the out right brutal killing of a good number of these animals deserves a place in front of our children and young adults as a role model. Who incidentally has the potential of making millions of dollars. There are hundreds of deserving young athletes who could step up and take his place. This is not the message we want to be sending and it is a truly sad day.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:24 pm | Jason Oatis 

I am a huge football fan and love to watch the amazing plays great atheletes like Vick make. Yes he served his time and should not continue be punished by the law, but it it a privledge to be a professional athelete. It is difficult enough to raise our childern with solid values, and forginvess is one of those, without taking sports icons and makeing the suggestion that if you are a star you will get a second chance. Vick should get a second chance at life, but not as a professional athelete.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:25 pm | Bea 

I don&apos;t watch football but I think I will get some Eagles shirts and caps to wear in support of Vick.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:25 pm | Judi Sinks 

Michael Vick Hired by Phil. Eagles ?????&quot;I want to cry like a Beagle&quot;For shame !!!!
 August 14, 2009 at 12:26 pm | nick Di Tommaso 

Vick was a Adult When He Commited This Crime On These Helpless Animals. The Only Reason He Is Begging For Foregiveness Is The Fact The Only Other Way He Is Qualified To Make A living Is To Cut Grass....Shame On You Philly
 August 14, 2009 at 12:27 pm | Rod Brown 

I saw his statement and it seems to be all about&quot;I saw how people reacted&quot;. It does not seem to be about I did a realllllly bad thing. Face it Michael you were a monster and you can never bring back those lives you took. When you can admit that perhaps you can work to do good. It&apos;s not about playing in the NFL it&apos;s about making right with God. Something else you might want to think about is that dog is God spelled backwards. Maybe just a coincidence???
 August 14, 2009 at 12:28 pm | Gerard 

Tony

You know it saddens me to see that even though when a crime has been committed and the court finds one guilty of that crime and you serve your time in jail, after you get out of jail you have certain people that feel that you must continue to be punished. I don&apos;t think that the crime is the real issue here.
Racism still exist, and it is pretty obvious here. That&apos;s the Real Issue Here.
The White Society doesn&apos;t want to see a young Black Man have a second opportunity to earn a better living. Knowing that he can make millions of dollars in the not to distant future.
This is wrong. Yet white folks are hiding their true feelings behind the fact that Michael Vick making these dogs fight one another.

Tell it like it is...... that&apos;s the REAL REASON BEHIND THE MADNESS HERE!!!!!
 August 14, 2009 at 12:28 pm | LaSandra (NC) 

If we can give a man another chance in the NFL who committed vehicular manslaughter, we can DEFINITELY give Michael Vick another chance. He&apos;s paid his time for the crime he committed (which was a bit excessive, in my opinion). It&apos;s time to move on from this nonsense and focus on real news.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:28 pm | Salome G. Rowe 

It is so odd that some people care more about animals than they do human beings. A human being made a mistake, used bad judgement, made restitution, and now America wants to completely ruin his career and life forever. How ironic is that. Has PETA forgotten that, although at the top of the food chain, human beings are also animals. Why would they stop at dog-fighting, wny not take on all violent sports involving pain infliction and the risk of death, such as boxing, hockey, car racing, or football and baseball, for that matter (every heavy bump to the chest or hard ball to the skull). The huge financially-backed machine that they would come against is out of their league, I guess. Maybe they should realize that all of the human beings who are rotting in American jails are animals too. Maybe they should work to help these human animals get the psychological care that they need instead of being caged, stored, pitted against one another where sexual crimes, negligence, bad diets, and violence among the inmates and by those who run the prisons change them into people with pitbull-type temperaments. Guess they do not want to get into that arena. Just gang up on the easy targets. How ethical is that?
 August 14, 2009 at 12:30 pm | Bunni Steele 

During his trial, Vick admitted the hanging and drowning of non-performing dogs was&quot;just&quot;punishment. Shame on him! I propose the following...his first bad game, subject him to the same treatment.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:30 pm | Joyce Lockett 

What have we become? Are we no different that other nations that are cold and inhumane toward human beings in their countries? God forbid if you or one of your dear family members did something really bad; was really sorry; paid restitution; and asked for a second chance? Be very careful when it come to human compassion for life has this very interesting way of&quot;flipping the script&quot;, and you find yourself in desparate need of great MERCY. Thank God for the forgiveness He offers through His Son, Jesus Christ.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:30 pm | Peg 

Perhaps some good could come out of Michael Vick getting a second chance if he puts some of his money where his mouth is to benifit abused animals getting a second chance.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:31 pm | Sue N. 

I live in Ontario, Canada, last December I was diagnosed with Cancer. Just 2 weeks later I had surgery to remove the tumor, and had a 2 week stay in the hospital. All the time receiving great care. This was then followed up quickly with 25 treatements of both Chemo and radiation, I have now finished these treatments and go for a CT scan this next week.
All this has cost me nothing financially, it has been covered under our Ontario governemnt health care. From the diagnosis to treatement and the follow up care I have received both prompt and careing treatment. How would I have faired in the US. I wonder.

THE NFL WILL NOT MISS YOU LOOKING AT THE GAMES. M. VICK DOESN&apos;T FALL INTO THE CATEGORY OF THE HUNTERS WHO KILL DEER, HOGS, TURKEYS, FOXES AND INNOCENT DUCKS, YEAR AFTER YEAR. NOW THAT IS AN AMERICAN TRADITION. LET&apos;S HEAR IT FOR THE LICENSED KILLERS OF ANIMALS OH YEAH, AND THAT MAKES IT LEGAL. THEY ALSO HANG THE POOR DEAD ANIMALS AS TROPHIES IN THEIR HOMES AND MAKE GREAT SPORT OF THE KILLINGS. THE ONLY REASON PEOPLE DON&apos;T WANT TO FORGIVE VICK IS SOMEWHERE IN THEIR PSYCHE THEY ARE SICK. TALKING ABOUT DOUBLE STANDARDS, AND WE KNOW WHY!
YOU WILL NOT BREAK THE NFL&apos;S BANK BY ANY MEANS. THEY MAY EVEN WIN THE SUPERBOWL THIS SEASON. REID IS A REAL MAN AND THE NFL SHOWS THEY WON&apos;T DESTROY A MAN WHEN HE IS DOWN. GO NFL, GO EAGLES. PLAY BALL..........
 August 14, 2009 at 12:32 pm | Marilyn Bond 

I can&apos;t imagine anyone growing up to be 20 something&amp;just now finding out that humans should not torture, mutilate, mame, a poor defenseless creature often referred to as man&apos;s best friend. What about his&quot;family values&quot;...Maybe he was raised by a pack of wild dogs&amp;just wanted revenge. Nothing anyone could call him would be savage enough.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:32 pm | TC Bandit 

Relax people! The guy is not going to work at PETCO! He&apos;s no dog walker, either. Your pooches are safe. He&apos;s a football player. Now, how upset are you (PETA), that the football itself is made from a pig? What about the poor piggy, PETA? What about all those hotdogs they serve at the games? How far should we go with this? Hmmmm?

Every man, woman, boy and girl deserves a second chance for whatever deed he or she comments. Granted, your misdeed may not be as big or what society considers as big as others, but if you were in a situation, you would want someone to forgive you and give you a second chance....therefore Vick deserves a second chance. He paid his debt to society.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:35 pm | Judith Strupp Green Wells 

Tony, In my opinion the only way for Michael Vick to convince people that he is sincerely sorry for his behavior is to donate publicly a significant amount of money to animal rights groups, especially targeting those that rescue animals who have suffered from despicable treatment.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:36 pm | Joyce Goldberg 

I am embarrassed to say I am from Philadelphia. There is a line–yes, people deserve another chance, but not for such a heinous crime. Vick knew what he was doing and did it anyway. It is totally disgusting!!! Andy Reid should be well aware of the association between cruelty to animals and domestic violence–they help serve a shelter here. I will not watch or attend an Eagles game and will also
not buy from any sponsor. Thank you.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:37 pm | WhatWouldJesusSayAboutMichaelVick 

I would like to know how posters such as Judith Chandler know that Michael Vick took&quot;sadistic pleasure in seeing animal (your spelling not mine) tortured and killed.&quot;

And you know that because you are a mind reader??? Were you there and did you see him do it and take pleasure in it?

Or how about eileen who thinks this is a sin and that Vick needs to be in rehabilitation (I believe that is what prison is supposed to do).

Eileen what do you think Jesus would say about Michael Vick. Would Jesus give him another chance or condemn him?

Just wondering.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:40 pm | Tony24 

Michael Vick was convicted of a crime, and paid for ithat crime with a prison sentance. That should be it! He should be allowed to move on with his life and provide for himself and his family. He needs to have a job and playing football is his TRADE. God bless Michael Vick and the Eagles.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:44 pm | Jaycie 

Michael Vick has a huge opportunity here. By becoming a spokesman and a tireless worker for animal welfare, he can do a world of good, especially if he is willing to go into communities where dog fighting exists to try and educate and reform ideas about animals and their value and place in our society. If he is not truly reformed, and goes back to his old ways, he will wind up in trouble again, and won&apos;t get another chance.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:45 pm | Gloria Riler-Harris 

To paraphrase, you asked: Do you believe in 2nd chances, or is Vick an exception? My tendency is to say yes, but....

In reality, I DO believe in 2nd chances, but not so much in 3rd, 4th and 5th ones. Michael Vick has a lot to overcome on a variety of levels, and a lot to prove on some personal levels. So, here&apos;s his chance to be a real human being........a man.......a real athlete, and a credible example for critics, millions of young people, and fans: Or not.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:47 pm | Michael B 

Michael Vick should now realize that having a great job with great pay after prison is a blessing. I pled guilty to a felony TRAFFIC violation that hurt no one but ME,did no jail time, and now find it hard to get job paying $10 an hour.Others in my shoes might begrudge Michael Vick, but I see this as hope that everyday employers can realize that people need a shot at redemption
 August 14, 2009 at 12:49 pm | Coby 

Michael Vick has done a terrible thing in his life no doubt, and in no way do I nor should anyone deny that. However, he is human. Now while we all continue to hear this notion time and time again and both supporters and bashers alike are sick of it, we once again are failing to look at this in a light that we truly can understand.
We all have an issue excusing a mistake and forgiving, yet are the first to shed a tear and beg for support when the situation that may cause for forgiveness directly hits our own lives.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:49 pm | Ronnie 

Michael Vick
The City of Brotherly Love is to Brotherly for me now.

The Eagle&apos;s can keep Michael Vick for all we care, but my relatives, friends and neighbor&apos;s feel differently.

We will not be attending and my motor home will stay parked for all game&apos;s the Eagle&apos;s are involved in.

I hope the Eagle&apos;s think he is worth it!

We live in a culture that celebrates the right to put bullets and arrows into animals, often just maiming them, while the participants lobby to prevent large cities from controlling hand guns.
I believe dog fights, bull fights and cock fights should be banned as cruel, but as to the punishment meted out to Vick, enough is enough.
 August 14, 2009 at 12:52 pm | Robert Lake,MI 

Unbelievable, well cant say that I didnt expect it! The man should clearly be in jail still and should have to go out and get a real job like the rest of us in this country.....he blew his free ride! Tax payers paid his way to the milllions and he should get a second chance sure but not in the NFL! The only reason this man is sorry for what he did is he knows the only way he can make money is by getting back in the NFL, shame on the NFL! Lets feel sorry for a player who really did nothing wrong and is still banned from baseball, yeah thats right Pete Pose! He may have gambled but he still is worth calling a man, cant say that for Vick!
 August 14, 2009 at 12:53 pm | Allison 

Tony Dungy keeps talking about how Vick&quot;made a mistake.&quot;He did NOT make a single mistake. It didn&apos;t happen just once. It happened over and over again. If he&apos;d made another type of&quot;mistake&quot;like taking drugs over and over again, he&apos;d be OUT of there. Murdering dogs is not a&quot;mistake&quot;Mr. Dungy!
 August 14, 2009 at 12:54 pm | Ambre 

Because no one seems to want to mention this, I will.
Michael Vick: Convicted of dogfighting, booted from NFL and served 18 months in federal prison.
Donte Stallworth: Pled guilty to MANSLAUGHTER from a DUI, served 30 days in jail and is SUSPENDED from the NFL for one season.
Am I the only one who sees something wrong with this? Do we value humans less than animals?
 August 14, 2009 at 12:56 pm | Allison 

Dungy kept talking about Vick&apos;s&quot;mistake&quot;as though it were one single thing he&apos;d done, one time. Murdering dogs repeatedly for sport is not a&quot;mistake.&quot;It&apos;s part of his character. If he&apos;d taken drugs repeatedly he&apos;d be out of there, so why does he get a second chance for doing something much worse?
 August 14, 2009 at 12:59 pm | Mike Khati 

Philadelphia is definitely the city of brotherly love. First, the Flyers sign Ray Emery, then the Phillies sign Pedro Martinez, and now the Eagles with Michael Vick. Other than Pedro, Ray Emery and Michael Vick have been in trouble in recent years.
 August 14, 2009 at 1:00 pm | Dego 

It&apos;s no longer about the dogs. He did his time for that and paid for his mistakes. Now it&apos;s about the present and a rehabilitated man moving forward with his life in a positive manner. He&apos;s just like anyone else who is trying to be employed. The NFL only makes sense as this is where his experience is. He has bills to pay and mouths to feed like anyone else. Besides, receivers of social services and SOCIALIST AMERICA shouldn&apos;t complain so much as he will be contributing to their resources and in much larger amounts than the average joe. GOOD LUCK MICHAEL VICK but EAGLES SUCK!!! GO GIANTS!!!!
 August 14, 2009 at 1:00 pm | Vicki Summers 

I just now watched another segment of your show and your interview with Vick&apos;s mentor. I am enraged...so disgusted. An $130 million contract??? Vick is NOW being so&quot;spiritually&quot;conscious in order to play and receive this wealth. He KNEW very well WHAT he was doing when he promoted that horrific dog fighting and deaths of dogs, BUT........he just thought THEN he would not ever get caught. He did get caught and NOW he is being rewarded.

Shame on the Eagles.
 August 14, 2009 at 1:01 pm | dave 

I watch these animal lovers continue to overpopulate their country with all sorts of pets while animal control centers across the country kill hundreds of thousands each year.where is there outrage?In AZ they kill over 10,000 pit bulls every yr because these animal lovers havent got a clue.They will have 10 cats or six dogs or 3 horses while people go without .What a joke their life is.
 August 14, 2009 at 1:02 pm | Skillzgeez 

I’m from Philly and always lived in Philly.....we definitely believe in second chances, plus why not..... a very good pro athlete who takes a slash in salary, whom most likely been training every day since he&apos;s been in ...a good meal regiment, a well controlled morning night system....nothing but weight lifting and training........WE MADE A GREAT INVESTMENT................

One last thing I wanted to comment on you and the former Surgeon General talked about the lacking of education between African Americans and caucasin American.......could it also relate to the forced 400-500 yrs of non education during our slavery time.......that gap in years is extremely great and takes time to correc........just a note to add
 August 14, 2009 at 1:04 pm | Jason Keown 

The fact that Vick is back in the NFL just shows what a classless organization the NFL is. There are some mistakes that one can swallow and emotionally absorb and forgive. We all screw up at some point. This however challenges the very basic value of what it means to be human.

Why dont we let Michael in a cage with a pack of enraged dogs and see how fast he reealy is.

His insincere apology could not have been more scripted and it&apos;s apparent that he realizes that he needs to play that role because his livelihood depends on it.
 August 14, 2009 at 1:07 pm | olemissdad 

In case it hasn&apos;t been noticed, our health care system is busted, our immigration system is busted, our political system is busted, our taxation system is busted, our ability to wage war and successfully defeat an enemy in a reasonable period of time is questionable, and our social values are corrupted beyond comprehension.

This whole thing with Michael Vick is absurd. Through his talents the man was given a chance an opportunity at a very lucrative career. Her blew it, committed a felony, was found guilty and convicted, and served a prison sentence. End of story. Being given a&quot;second chance&quot;flies in the face of every law-abiding, hard working citizen in this country. I, as many, many others find myself unemployed through no fault of my own. I spent my life working to further my career, playing by all the rules and laws of society, setting aside money for retirement. Again through no fault of my own those not satisfied with their financial position in life allowed their greed to ruin the lives of countless citizens who, like me, will probably not have a&quot;second chance&quot;to restart a career nor recap their investments or retirement funds. For Michael Vick to be given a second chance for a multi-million dollar career is an insult to those who suffered in so many ways as a result of this recession. Finally, as others have stated, his&quot;reinstatement&quot;in the NFL sends a very wrong signal in many ways. Have we lost all our senses?
 August 14, 2009 at 1:07 pm | L Adams 

Vick outrage, you people amaze me everyone is on this Vick story, take you sorry pathetic souls with your cameras and see the despicable, inhumane things that human beings are doing to each other in Irac, Iran, Afghanistan, Africa, Mexico, we care more for the animals than we do for each other, the same people are fighting against health care and making death treats to the President and others.
 August 14, 2009 at 1:13 pm | Abby 

I have quite a different opinion on all this. First of all, I think that Michael Vick is himself a victim of an odd brand of reverse discrimination. I think because he was so popular, he was administered a sentence which in its severity did not fit the crime, in order that he might be made an example of. Thus, the message was to be for public satisfaction:&quot;You can&apos;t get away with doing bad things EVEN if you&apos;re a celebrity.&quot;In other words, our nation was drooling to see a hero fall. Why is the punishment too severe for the crime? Because his crimes were not against humans. I&apos;m sorry, but animals are nowhere near as significant as human being. Unless you&apos;re a vegan, then you agree with me. Michael tortured animals. That is distasteful and deserves a fine, but certainly not a day of jail time. We as a nation do and endorse the same thing every day with the animals that are slaughtered and ripped into shreds for our enjoyment (aka, your hamburgers, steaks, chicken, etc.) We lock these animals up, deny them freedom of movement or environment, then butcher them. Michael Vick simply repeated what everyone of us tacitly endorses everyday. So if you think he deserves to be eternally punished for a crime against animals, then you&apos;re a hypocrite, and all meat eating people in this country should receive the same fate.

While everyone has the right to their opinion–let me toss my to the wind and see what flies back at me...most of the people I&apos;m sending this to are pet-owners...so you know where I&apos;m coming from, right from the first few words!

&quot;How can anyone even think of taking this man onto their team? In his own backyard–he let dogs be treated, abused, and killed for sport? Thoroughly disgusting, that&apos;s what this person will be known as for the rest of their life–and to pay him millions of dollars to play on a team that should know better, even more disgusting.

The man has no remorse outside of what his paycheck can cover...if he truly cared for anything other than his own wallet, he would leave sports forever and dedicate his life to the innocent animals that he&quot;bankrolled&quot;and watched being killed...IN HIS OWN BACKYARD...Philly should be sad to have this waste of human flesh be part of their team, in any form!

Needless to say–I sit here with my dog Amber beside me and cannot imagine what kind of disgusting human I would have to become to harm her in any way...it is so far beyond me that I can&apos;t imagine it.

Ever creature that man has as his&quot;pet&quot;is a gift from Above–they are living, breathing, caring, thinking creatures, just like man...they deserve our respect even more since the dogs and cats of this world bond with us for their whole life....Michael Vick–you make me sick....that&apos;s what I want my next bumper sticker and t-shirt to say...

Boycott this man and the Eagles in every way possible...send a message to all humans...that our pets, and all God&apos;s creatures are to be given the utmost respect, admiration, and love/affection that is humanly possible...

I&apos;m so disgusted right now I just don&apos;t know what to say...unlike Vick...I&apos;m going to go HUG my dog...not hang it from a tree in my own backyard just to watch it die from not being good at killing other animals....sick bastard.&quot;

I really have no respect for VICK, he should have spent much more time in prison, he is a sick person and now the world wants him to play football again?? Where are the morals in this world. I do hope that if Vick plays again, that he can get a sponsor or two, here is an awesome sponsor he should go for (it could make him feel just a little better) he should be the top spokeman for HUSH PUPPIES SHOES!! boy that would be a kick in the teeth., I will never watch football of any team that has Vick. He is lower than a snake. Betty Phillips

We have all made mistakes but when it comes to a person being so cruel,&amp;unkind, to helpless animals it is unforgivable. If Vicks wants to work then let him go into another line of work. The big money that these athletics make, tends to take ones conscious away . It sounds as if all that is important is that ( he will be a valuable asset to the team). Is it all about WINNING? What has happened to our society, America. How sad it has become.

For those of you who think what he did is forgivable. How would you feel if he used your pet to train his dogs or used your dog in a fight. Does this change your mind about what he did. If you have ever loved a pet, you would know the extent of the anger felt by those of us who are sickened by this decision. Vick is no role model and the Eagles are a business that only cares about the bottom line. I think they will regret their decision after this blows up in their faces.

Hey Tony to Tony...eh eh )

We have a right, to get Vick on criminal charges, and he has a right to understand his punishment. We have a right to serve him time, he has the grace to do so and to learn.

The Universe, or God, or Jesus or the great energies, whatever you like to call the power, has time after time sent messages to our little brains to learn to FORGIVE.

Reason why so much hate, so much turmoil, problems in the world is we have not let go of past ideas or when a crime so bad is committed. We have a right to be mad, to punish and then we must FORGIVE.

For those whom do not forgive, they will have the most tragedies in their life and beyond, and we have a right to punish, but must forgive to keep the positive balance of the earth.

He did his crime, he served a sentence, PETA must forgive and accept and allow our reform to work. He has the right, under the universe to re gain control of HIS Life in free will choice.

Michael Vick makes me sick. I am to the point where the sight of his face even makes me sick. The only reason he is apologizing and agreeing to speak out against dog fighting is because he got caught. Why does he get a second chance? All those innocent dogs that died because of him didn&apos;t. I will never watch another NFL game as long as he is playing.
 August 14, 2009 at 2:04 pm | Lacey 

I see no problem in his return to the NFL as long as he is sincerely sorry for his crime. Sadly, there is no way of knowing if he is sincere on his stance or if it&apos;s just a bluff. I think he should consider donations and possibly volunteering at the Humane Society.

i think it is horrible what he did to animals. yes he did his time and forgivenes well? lets see how much he does, and how far he goes to be an advocate for animals involed in dog fighting who truely need help, and other guys out there who are in the shoes he was in! everybody knows what he did but it is what he is gonna do about? oh does that mean just go back to playing football?! he should donate his time and money do commercials. travel to humane shelters and talk to teens. Get people to expose people who are doing these acts. lets see him show how he can prevent cruelty to animals! oparh could help him if he needs advice. well the ball is in his hands now ?!

Yes, Michael Vick does deserve a 2nd chance - he has earned his opportunity to rejoin civilized society. Redemption? That has yet to be seen. Let him bang nails. Maybe he can build a little character while he&apos;s at it.

The issue is not&apos;just dogs&apos;. The issue is Vick, himself–his intent–the blackness of heart required to derive pleasure from the heinous, repeated, and relentless torture helpless, defenseless creatures. Professional athletes&apos;are&apos;role models. They ALL should be held to a&apos;higher&apos;standard of character and conduct, on and off the field.

It is a privilege to be put on a pedestal and paid millions to entertain out children. This, Michael Vick does not deserve.
