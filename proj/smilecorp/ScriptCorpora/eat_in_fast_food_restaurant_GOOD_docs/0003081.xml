You Can repair your vehicle for free by just going to Carl’s home&amp;parking any

vehicle in his garage. Roam around for some time&amp;when you will be back your v

ehicle will be as good as new.

 

 

Hint:Store More vehicles in garage:

———————————–

Submitted by: Prathmesh Mhatre

 

At CJ’s home in Los Santos you can store maximum 2 Cars or Bikes or so.To fit more

park one car near the wall Find BMX and park it extream end of garage find some more

bikes this time garage won’t open.Park bike in front of the door and get off the bike

door will open up.Get on the bike casually CJ will take a run up on the bike and bike

will enter the garage without any problem.You can store as many as bikes fit in the

garage. You’ll find BMX parked in front of the house opposite CJ’s at certain timings.

 

 

Hint:Ride on bicycle be healthy:

——————————–

Submitted by: Prathmesh Mhatre

 

Drivers in Los Santos are always in hurry even an old lady don’t hesitate to bump

the stopped car(This reminds me my driving in Liberty City&amp;Vice City) it difficult

no navigate around Los Santos with such traffic.Since people don’t give up their cars

easily like previous versions of GTA;riding on BMX is the best way to get around as

well as increase the Stamina.Railway lines,Water cannals are safer&amp;faster to travel

Or simply stick to footpaths to not to be squashed

 

 

Stuck in Los Santos?:

———————

Submitted by: Prathmesh Mhatre

 

You’re stuck in Los Santos up to the mission’A break from Los Santos…’.But stil

you can have a close look of other cities here are the tips:

 

1.Go to the South-east corner of Los Santos walk along the railway lines.Swim towards

north reach to the coaste quickly.

2.Keep going north along the railway lines soon you’ll reach station.(You’ll be

declared 6 star wanted as soon as you enter other city.Even cheat can’t wipe that

out).

3.If you’re lucky you may catch up the train if there isn’t any train wait and defend

yourself from Army and Police.Soon there’ll be a train.Get into cotrol room by

pressing F standing near he engine.

4.Accelrate train backwards.Now cops and army can’t get you DO NOT SLOW DOWN TRAIN

MUCH or you’ll be busted.

5.Now all you have to do is manage your speed High on straight lined Medium on curved

ones.Have fun watching at least.

 

NOTE: TRAIN COULD DERAIL ON CURVED HIGH GAGE RAILS(ESPACIALLY IN MOUNTAINS)MY TRAIN

ONCE DERAILED NEAR A TUNNEL DONT REMEMBER WHICH BUT COACHES DETACHED&amp;WENT INTO THE

SEA I SURVIVED ONLY BECAUSE ENGINE HAD ENTERD THE TUNNEL DERAILED&amp;TLITED

You can skydive with CJ,some tall buildings have a yellow marker at the bottom to

take you to the top of the building.On top of some buildings there is a parachute,

take it and jump of the building,press Left Mouse Button to deploy the parachute.

Otherwise use the parachute cheat,then spawn the Hydra (Use NumPad8 and NumPad2 to

How to destroy a moving car without any gun: Here’s a way that i found while

playing GTA: SA, first jump onto the top of a car on any highway or road, dont

stand on the bonut but on the top or back of the car. Now when the car starts

moving, start tapping the attack button, Carl Johnson will start kicking the

car.. you’ll see the car waving around when the drive panics. Dont stop and

keep kicking, eventually the car will become on fire.. jump away and look the

car being blast by the engine fire caused by your actioons

After completing the“Just Business”level, Just go to“Santa Marina Beach”.

(See the Map to get there). There, you could see a red colour at the shore of

the beach. Its the starting point of a Competitional Race. First, try to swim

using Sprint key, as normal. Then you will reach the other shore. Then, from

there you have to get on a cycle, to reach the other point of this race. Go as

you wish, but try to use the accelerating key continuously to go faster. Then,

when you reach the next point of race. You will be asked to get down from cycle

and to Run faster to reach the Final Point of the Race.

 

Sometimes you will be going on 7th or 8th Position. Never mind them !

 

Now, just type ROCKETMAN to get jetpack. Then you might be able to Run Faster

if  you press Sprint key along with accelerating key. But, please not that you

have to go in ground level height, or else you cannot win the Race. By using

this Cheat, you can get $10000 very easily!

 

Please Note:- This Trick will not work, if you try to get a vehicle using cheat

code, because you have to run on the roads, or else you will be Failed in the

Race!

By ending all of the missions, that doesn’t mean you have already finished with

the game! By finishing missions ONLY you get only to 75% of completing the game.

You will need to make all competitions of driving, flying, low riders and pick-up

all hidden objects around San Andreas. Then you will get 100% of the game.

Also buying all houses will do the trick (it will raise you the completance of

the game).

I have heard that some users find that they find the races difficult.If you want

to win the races then take a car and drive carefully without damaging it even if

you are in the last place.Just go slowly and at one point the other racers will

slow down and you can catch up with them.This hint is given by my personal

experience.

unlike in that of in GTA Vice City, Police Vehicles are not kept in Stations. (In

some Police stations of Vice city, you may see Police Vehicles in the Station

itself). If you want to take the Police vehicles directly from the Garages, where

the vehicles are keep in safe custody, Get around the Police station and you can

see an entrance (at any nearest Building of the Police Station) at which there you

can see police checkpoint. You may kill them from distant far away and then enter

there. You can see many Police vehicles are parked inside that Building.

Get any of them which are not LOCKED. Then if you press horn to make the

emergency lights to turn on, the other POLICE Vehicles will also give you way.

 

Note: This will be valid if you get a police vehicle by the above methode only.

Get a Packer (Lorry). Then you may use 8 or 2 to move the Packer function to Up or

Down. You may take vehicles upstairs of this packer and you may carry them wherever

you like. BUT, you have to drive very carefully or else the vehicle above the packer

may fell-down and even may explode. This Trick might be useful if you need a vhicle

and at the same time you just dont want to drive that vehicle at that time and you

would like to carry a vhicle by another. I’m doing something naughty with this idea.

I use these packers when cops are to catch me. I will throw cops using this idea.

When cops hit the back of packer, up the packer function and finaly you might be

able to throw the cops. The Cops will constantly hit the vehicle since the Packer

is not having Good Speed on the Roads. Is it really something naughty ?

Bug–Hood Loss:

—————-

While playing the European English version of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas with the

latest patch of 1.01, I encountered a bug.

 

The bug occurs near CJ’s house. I bought in the northwest of ballas territory when it

comes to fighting turf, not too far from the beach and ammuNation. While fighting a

turf war normally there are 3 waves, ie you survive the first wave and then the second

and when you survive the third“the hood is yours”. The trouble occurs near Jefferson’s

neighborhood as you drive to a nearby drive to take territory. While standing on rooftops,

I survive the first wave of attacks but as I shoot a lot of Ballas a couple of them run

away from me and are noted as purple triangles and squares in the green grove street

territory. If I wander too far from the Flashing Red“contested territory”I get a

message saying to“get back into the war zone”. I have stood in the war zone for 20

minutes only to just stand there with nobody coming after me, hence if I leave the war

zone I don’t get to win that area because after a couple minutes I lose it. Therefore

I cannot simply go way out of the warzone and chase down the enemies. It is a glitch

because there is no way to win the territory.

Big Smoke : Wrong Side of the Tracks:

————————————-

Submitted by: Lipinkumar

 

I think this is the easiest way to do the mission. It seems that Big Smoke is not an

expert in shooting. If CJ could help, all the four guys will be down quickly. For that

we must enter the cheat“OUIQDMW”[Full weapon aiming while driving] so that CJ can

shoot the guys on the tain very easily. CJ should try to finish the guy standing at

the very front, he is the toughest person for Big Smoke.

 

 

Modify characteristics of things you can buy:

buy in the game such as cars, clothes, haircuts, tattoos, food, weapons. This also

Invincible car:

—————

Use the following trick to make your car invincible, so that it will not show body damage

or explode. Enable the jcnruad code while CJ is on foot. Then, enter a vehicle and enter

the cheat code again to disable it. Your vehicle is now invincible. After you get out of

the vehicle, it may or may not stay invincible. Occasionally the car will become vulnerable

again for no apparent reason, but most of the time it stays invulnerable.

 

 

Flying car:

———–

Enable the bubblecars code. Get a PCR 600 and drive directly into another car. You should

fly off your bike directly on top of the other car and it will fly away with C.J. still on

it.

 

 

Croupier mission: Invisible tow ropes:

————————————–

When doing the Croupier mission, pull up to the red marker in a Tanker with the trailer.

Your trailer will turn into the nearest car as if you were towing it with invisible

towing ropes.

san andreas\data”directory. You will find a list of all the different types of locations

in the game, such as the airport. You can edit the number of different types of pedestrians

in a place in a specific time period by changing the numbers beside each item. For example,

you can change the amount of cops at the beach on a weekday at noon and increase the amount

of beach folks or farmers. Save your changes and start the game.

Save your changes and start the game.

 

 

Stand on Hydra’s wing:

———————-

When your flying in the Hydra with the bubbleman code, apply the thrusters forward and use

[Down] to aim the Hydra up. Then, monitor it for a while so it does not over or under

balance, and it remains pointing up by itself. After that, leave the Hydra, but do not

touch anything. You should be standing on the wing of a Hydra that should still be flying

up, faster because of the thrusters. You can jump off at anytime to continue the rest of

Finish the Vigilante Missions Easily:

————————————-

Actually a glitch that can be taken advantage of to cheat your way through the Vigilante

sub-missions. Anytime the player accesses an indoor environment and then returns outside

during this sub-mission the target(s) with self-destruct automatically. This means no more

messy pursuing.

 

 

Fast Reload:

When the current weapon clip you have is about to run out press the next weapon button and

then the previous weapon button to equip you with the weapon that was running low. It will

now have a full magazine. This trick doesn’t work if you are reloading at the time of

switching as you will have to let Carl reload it when you switch back.

 

 

Flying Tips:

————

Among the hardest missions in the game involve flying aircraft; chief among these would be

the“Learning to Fly”missions at flight school with the many coronas in between success

and you. Most players make the mistake of steering with the main flaps and not the rudder;

the former are the flaps on the wings and the latter is the flap on the tail.

The big difference is that steering with the former gives the player a tighter turning

radius but with less precise control; the latter restricts your controls greatly and so is

less popularly used. Try a combination of the two: first turn with the stick and then

compensate by using the rudder. The rudder will act to stabilize your plane and return

control to you. Also, know which camera to use. The default camera during flight should

be the one trailing the plane that gives the widest field of view so that you can easily

see where you are going as well as your relative position to the ground. The First person

camera is good to use when doing the barrel roll or when using the Hydra to dogfight.

Easy mission“Vertical Bird”:

—————————–

Submitted by: Omega

 

This mission isn’t too hard. But there’s an easy way to complete this mission:

After get in the Hydra there are 2 or 3 Hydras chasing after you. Don’t Worry, just find

some where surrounded with rocky mountain to land the plane (the desert is quite good).

Then get out of the plane quickly. Keep a distance from the plane. Watch the radar and

you’ll see 2 red marks will disappear (I guess they’re 2 planes destroyed by their own

rockets). The last redmark is the last Hydra. You should watch cuaze it’s quite fun:

it will repeatly fly around you and your Hydra and soon hit the rocks around you.

After several hits it will catch fire and“go boom”. Get in The plane to find the location

of the agency boats, get out then destroy the boats (using rocket launcher or minigun).

The last thing you have to do is flying home. (Note: Find a place without cars and easy

to land/take off. Get out of the plane quickyly or some rocket will hit the plane or you.

If the last plane is not destroyed simply take it down by using Minigun or rocket launcher)

Submitted by: Omega

 

My favourite weapon in this ganme is the barrel Shotgun (I don’t remember its name but it

is shorter than other shotguns). This weapon is real fast and powerful. If you comebine it

with infinite ammo code“WANRLTW”and hit man code“NCSGDAG”this will be the most powerful

weapon in this game (I think).

With this you can kill the target in short distance without cause damage to your health.

 

 

Finding some rare car in Export car mission:

——————————————–

I really enjoy this mission so I give this to you.

Some cars will appear many before the exportin mission but after startin the mision they

are almost impossible to find. I recommend to save before the mission start, then watch

the list of cars. Load save, store some rare cars that you can’t find them easily (such

as Sentinel, Stafford, Journey ect.) then do the mission

I will guide sone way to find those rare car:

 

* Sentinel:

A foor doors car which can be found at the the tv studio (not far from the“Vinewood”

Sign). This place is just like the film studio in GTA Vice City and it could be easier

to find it if flying with Jetpack.

 

* Journey:

A white RV. Sometime park at bar in the country side but when the export mission starts

you have to look it up in the country road. Other way not to go to the country is using

the code“FVTMNBZ”.

 

* BF Injection:

Can be found in the moutain country or at the westcoast of San Fierro. Another way is

using the code“CRAZYTOWN”. It will apear a lot. (better not using this way cauze you

will becom freaky ugly clown).

 

* Euros:

Go to the The Camels Toe casino (pyramid with a sphinx in the front) in Las Venturas.

The Euros is under the sphinx.

 

* Cheetah, Comet, FCR–900, Buffalo, Slamvan:

Easy to find in Las Venturas at night.

 

* Stafford:

Appear alot in the Northest area of Las Venturas

constant, without him needing to eat. You can leave the PlayStation2 idling in this state

to accumulate money easily.

 

 

Easy money:

———–

Find a save point that is close to a betting shop. The one in the Montgomery are is ideal

because it is near to the save point where you have to do the four missions for Catalina.

Save your game, then go to the betting shop and bet all your money on a horse. It takes

awhile to enter the numbers, but is worth it because you can make a huge amount of cash

(especially if you bet on horses with odds of 10/1, 11/1, 12/1, etc.). It takes roughly

three to four minutes to bet the maximum amount of money, which is $9,999,995. You will

not win every time. When you lose, reload your last saved game. It is possible to get

$250,000,000 by betting your winnings of $30,000 to $700,000 to $2,000,000 to the

does the longer reload.

 andreas\data”directory. You will find a list of all the vehicles and a description 

 of each multiplier factor. You can modify the acceleration, top speed, mass, 

 monetary value, transmission, gravity center, and much more. 

 

 

 Two player mode: 

 —————- 

 Successfully complete the Burning Desire mission where you rescue Denise. A red 

 two player free roam icon will now appear on Denise’s porch near the door. The 

 icon will appear there when she is home and will go on a date. Note: If both enter 

 a car, the passenger will have free aim with a machine gun. Do not try to kill 

 Denise, because you will never be able to date her again or play in two player 

 mode at her house. Additionally, once you get your girlfriend, take her on a date. 

 After you drop her off, there will be a rotating icon of two people directly in 

 front of the door. Walk into it. It will tell you to push any button on the 

 controller two. Do so to start two player mode, involving CJ and his girlfriend 

 in a free roam. 

 

 For more fun in two player mode, start the two player mission. Then, enable the 

 “Spawn Jetpack”code and remove the Jetpack. Then, have player two get the Jetpack. 

 Enable the Jetpack code again, then have player one get it. Both players can now 

 fly around and do the two player missions this way. 

 

 

 Two player mode in Los Santos: 

 —————————— 

 Note: You must have a second controller inserted in port two. In the Ganton area, 

 start from Grove Street where the Johnson house is located. Drive under the first 

 bridge and continue to go straight. Next, youshould drive over some railroad tracks. 

 After this, you should drive under a second bridge. Take the first right turn you 

 see. It should be a dead end. Drive until your car hits the grass, then look to 

 your left. You should see an open doorway. Walk through it and you should see a 

 small“2 Player”icon. Press any button on controller two to begin. Additionally, 

 when you are on the missions from Big Smoke go north of his house. You should see 

 some wrecked buildings. Go through them to find a two player free roam icon. 

 

 

 Two player mode in San Fierro: 

 —————————— 

 Not far from the garage you own and beyond the construction area is a large 

 building with a parking lot on either side, on the right side (north according 

 to the map) is a two player icon. Multiple people types can be selected by the 

 second player (three women and three men). Unlike those from the dating missions, 

 this two player location will never go away. 

 

 

 Two player mode in Bone County: 

 ——————————- 

 Starting at the abandoned airstrip, go west and north onto the road. There is a 

 blackish-brown building on the south side of the road with a large balcony going 

 all the way around it. Follow the balcony half way around and you will find a two 

 player mode icon. 

 

 

 Two player mode in Tierra Robada:

 12 of the fire truck missions to make CJ fireproof. 

 

 

 Easily complete fire truck missions: 

 ———————————— 

 Bring a fire truck from another location into Angel Pine, then start the mission. 

 This should be easier than doing it in Los Santos, San Fierro, the desert, or Las 

 Venturas. When you do it at this location, and you are stuck on a cliff that you 

 cannot get up (for example, if the burning car is on the freeway), take your time 

 by taking the long way. You should only use this method if you have at least three 

 minutes or more time remaining. Note: All fires will not always appear in Angel 

 Pine, as they may also happen in Whetstone or other nearby places. Although this 

 sounds difficult, there are not that many roads near the Angel Pine area which 

 actually makes it easier to complete. If the fire truck gets severely damaged, 

 enable the“Health”code. 

 

 

 Mike Toreno missions bonus: 

 —————————

 minigun, rocket launcher, and homing rocket launcher to appear at his cabin in

 northeast part of Angel Pine is a medical building with an Ambulance next to it. 

 Get in it and start the missions. All the victims will appear in the city, which 

 is very small. The farthest person will only be about ten seconds away from the 

 drop off point. You can complete the missions in less then ten minutes by doing 

 this. Also, the cops do not appear very often, allowing your wanted level to remain 

 low. Additionally, do the Paramedic mission in the Angel Pine area. Start the 

 missions. 

 

 All injured people that must be taken to the hospital will be in the crowded town. 

 Unlike the fire truck missions if done in this town, this mission has all the people 

 in one place. Once you complete this mission, you will your health increased to 150.

 level 12 of the vigilante missions to get an armor limit of 150. 

 

 

 Easily complete vigilante missions: 

 ———————————– 

 Use the Rhino to complete the vigilante missions easier. Additionally, start the 

 mission, put the vehicle in your garage, and exit so that the door closes. Enable 

 the“Destroy all cars”code. The criminals will be killed. Run back to the garage, 

 hop in the car, and repeat. This is also a good way to quickly gain more money and 

 status points. 

 

 Get an FBI Rancher and drive onto the Julius Thruway in Las Venturas. Start 

 Vigilante mode and begin driving around the highway. Just stay on the highway, 

 and you will notice that the criminals start dying for no apparent reason. Just 

 drive for about twenty minutes to get the 150 armor award easily. 

 

 Increase respect, money, driving skill and armor in vigilante missions 

 Enable the“Spawn Rhino tank”code and use it for the vigilante missions. When you 

 reach level 12, your armor will increase to 150. Each time you kill a group of 

 criminals, you will get money (on level 20 and over you will be winning $50,000 

 or more). If you get a wanted level, do not cheat to lower it. As police ram you, 

 they will explode and your respect will increase. All the driving that you will 

 do increases your driving skill somewhat.

 and satchel charges to appear at the Four Dragons Casino.

 shotgun, and Molotov cocktails to appear inside your house on Grove Street. 

 

 

 100% game completion bonuses: 

 —————————– 

 Successfully complete the game with a 100% game completion. CJ will get a stats 

 boost, extra money, and a Rhino and Hydra will be delivered to CJ’s house on Grove 

 Street. 

 

 

 Increase muscle or stamina: 

 ————————— 

 At about 22:00, go to a gym and work out, maxing yourself. After you have worked 

 out enough for the day, wait another minute until the time is 0:00. Max yourself 

 out for that day then go home. Save two or three times and you can repeat this 

 process. 

 

 To get your character maxed out in the muscle and stamina attributes, do the 

 following. Go the gym near the Johnson house. Work out until you are told that 

 it is enough for one day. Go home (right down the block), save the game to 

 advance to the next day. Return to the gym and you can work out again. You can 

 now max out your muscle and stamina in less then a half hour. 

 

 

 Increase weapon skill: 

 ———————- 

 Achieve a high wanted level and go into a restaurant. Shoot everyone with the 

 weapon that you want to raise in rank. If you walk around and wait, police will 

 spawn, but will not shoot you. Police can raise your weapon skill faster than 

 pedestrians. This works best in Burger Shot because of the wide area that you 

 can walk around in. Continue until you reach Hitman status. 

 

 Use the following trick in front of any safe house. Use the gun you want to get 

 up to Hitman status to repeatedly shoot a car until it explodes. Then, go to the 

 next car. Repeat this until you reach Hitman status for that weapon. Watch out 

 for the police. You can shoot them, then keep shooting the cars. When you are 

 almost dead, enter your safe house and save the game. Your health will be restored 

 and wanted level removed. 

 

 Get lots of bullets for the guns that you want Hitman or Gangster status for. 

 Go to Tierra Robada. Look around at the north of the island to find a little house. 

 Stay in there and enable the“Increase wanted level”code three times. Stay in the 

 cabin and wait for the police to approach. When they enter the house, kill them. 

 

 To attain Hitman level quicker, select your desired weapon and go to a Pay‘N’ 

 Spray. Park your vehicle directly next to the Pay‘N’Spray. Exit the vehicle and 

 repeatedly shoot people, cars, and cops. When your wanted level is raised to two 

 stars or above, run to your vehicle and drive into the Pay‘N’Spray to cancel it. 

 If your vehicle is not damaged, the respray is free. Wait for the wanted stars to 

 stop flashing, then start shooting people again. 

 

 Go into a police station and find a room with one entry point, and something that 

 you can hide behind (like a desk). Take out your weapon. You should now have a 

 two star wanted level. Shoot any cop who comes through the door. Every cop you 

 shoot makes your gun skill go up by about five. Do this until you either die, run 

 out of bullets, or enable the“Lower wanted level”code. 

 

 

 Increase driving skill: 

 ———————– 

 Go to San Fierro and pass the tests at the driving school. Additionally, find a 

 tractor or a slow moving car. Drive the roads without going as fast as you can 

 (move slowly). This will take awhile, but will increase your driving skills. 

 

 

 Increase underwater skill: 

 ————————– 

 Repeatedly swim underwater to increase your lung capacity and your underwater skill. 

 

 

 Easily max Lung Capacity: 

 ————————- 

 Dive underwater, and once your breath is out, you will start losing health. If 

 you want to stay underwater, keep enabling the“Armor, health, money, and street 

 creds”code when your health is low. You will be able to remain underwater, and 

 max your Lung Capacity attribute easily. 

 

 

 Raising stats quicker: 

 ———————- 

 Go to any pier over any body of water. Swim under the pier and stay in one position. 

 This will immensely raise your muscle, stamina, and lung capacity in just under a 

 minute. Stay under longer for better results. 

 

 

 Return to land faster: 

 ———————- 

 If you get stuck in the water, enable the“Spawn Hotring Racer”then“Spawn 

 Jetpack”codes. It will not appear until you are on a non watery surface. Quickly 

 jump on the car. It may be a far ride, but it is better than swimming. 

 

 

 Unlock areas quickly: 

 ——————— 

 Enable the“Wanted level never increases”code. Go to the shaded areas of the 

 game and they will become unlocked. If you go to a safe house and save the game, 

 all areas will be unlocked from now on. However, in order not to be wanted when 

 you go back into these areas, you must enable the“Wanted level never increases” 

 code again, but you will be free to roam about. 

 

 

 Revealing territories: 

 ———————- 

 Get a plane and fly all the way to either the southeast, southwest, northeast, 

 or northwest of the map where the ocean is found. Keep flying for thirty minutes 

 in that direction, then jump out of the plane. Do not open the parachute and 

 intentionally drown. When you arrive at the hospital, check your map. You will 

 see that there are enormous amounts of new territories in San Fierro, Las Venturas, 

 and some in Las Santos. You can take over these territories, and they only have 

 one wave. 

 

 

 Quick map fill in Los Santos: 

 —————————– 

 To get all of the map showing in the starting area of the game, get on the freeway 

 and continue going until you cannot go further. Then, pause the game and the entire 

 bottom right half of the map should be marked as explored. 

 

 

 Gain respect: 

 ————- 

 To gain respect, stay in your neighborhood and get a wanted star, then kill all 

 the police that arrives. Once you reach a four star wanted level (and if you killed 

 enough police), you will gain some respect. Additionally, completing missions is 

 not the only way to earn respect. By spraying other gang’s tags, you will also 

 earn a bit, and by taking over another gang’s area you will earn a lot. 

 Note: You must have completed some missions before you can take over areas. You 

 can see on the radar witch areas you have taken over, and which areas the enemy 

 gangs own. Your own territory is marked with green, and your enemies are yellow 

 or purple. 

 

 

 Respect status: 

 ————— 

 Your respect is made up of the following factors: 

 

 Running Respect (see below): 40% 

 Mission Progress: 36% 

 Territory Under Control: 6% 

 Money: 6% 

 Fitness: 4% 

 Clothes: 4% 

 Girlfriend Progress: 4% 

 Your Running Respect is changed by the following factors: 

 

 Territory gained: +30% 

 Killing a gang member: +.5% 

 Killing a dealer: +.005% 

 Killing a member of your gang: -.005% 

 A member of your gang is killed: -2% 

 Territory lost: -3% 

 Your respect affects the number of gang members that you can recruit: 

 

 Above  1%: 2 

 Above 10%: 3 

 Above 20%: 4 

 Above 40%: 5 

 Above 60%: 6 

 Above 80%: 7 

 

 

 Easy money: 

 ———– 

 Walk into a bar and beat up all the customers with a bat, nightstick, or pool cue. 

 More customers spawn and your wanted level will not rise. No one pulls out a gun, 

 and your maximum health will increase after a number of fights. Beating up the 

 person next to the pool tables gets you a pool cue, and every once in awhile a 

 customer will spill a few hundred dollars. 

 

 Find a save point that is close to a betting shop. The one in the Montgomery are 

 is ideal because it is near to the save point where you have to do the four 

 missions for Catalina. Save your game, then go to the betting shop and bet all 

 your money on a horse. It takes awhile to enter the numbers, but is worth it 

 because you can make a huge amount of cash (especially if you bet on horses with 

 odds of 10/1, 11/1, 12/1, etc.). It takes roughly three to four minutes to bet 

 the maximum amount of money, which is $9,999,995. You will not win every time. 

 When you lose, reload your last saved game. It is possible to get $250,000,000 by 

 betting your winnings of $30,000 to $700.000 to $2,000,000 to the maximum bet. 

 

 Enable the“Deadly vehicle”and“Flying cars”codes. When you are up in the air, 

 fly down to the ground and hit it to get money for a unique trick. The higher you 

 go and hit the ground, the more money you can make. You can also deactivate the 

 code while in the air and hit the ground to make a lot of money. 

 

 Enable the“Flying cars”code. Fly around for a few seconds, then touch the ground. 

 You will get money for insane stunts. 

 

 

 Easy Hitman rating: 

 ——————- 

 Shoot at the black part of a wheel. If you shoot at the rim it will not work. 

 Keep on shooting until the skill bar is all the way up for the desired weapon. 

 

 

 Easy dual sawn-off shotgun ability: 

 ———————————– 

 It is recommended that you spray all 100 tags, as it is easier for ammunition 

 and early on missions. Get a cop car (preferably a car, OT truck, rancher, etc.). 

 Save it in the Johnson family garage; save the game if desired. Get a large amount 

 of sawn-off shotgun ammunition. If all 100 tags were sprayed, it is available in 

 Johnson kitchen. Go to the garage. Get as far away from the car as possible without 

 letting the garage door close. Then crouch, aim for the grill of the police car, 

 and shoot. Every few shots (or every time the car catches fire), you should have 

 more weapon skill. It will eventually upgrade about every minute. When it catches 

 on fire, let the garage repair the car and come back. This does not work as well 

 at getting Hitman on the other weapons. 

 

 

 Easy money in Los Santos: 

 ————————- 

 From the Johnson house in the Ganton area, go straight until you are in the front 

 yard of the house opposite of yours. Turn right, and go behind it by going between 

 that house and the one next to it. Go in the backyard until you are in the corner. 

 You should see a pistol. Take it, then get back to Grove Street. If you see man, 

 usually in black, that is standing there with his arms crossed, shoot him. 

 He usually carries about $2,000 or more and a pistol, because he is a drug dealer. 

 Repeat this to get easy money. Kill him quickly before he shoots you. It is 

 possible to get $50,000 in one day by doing this. 

 

 Upon exiting the Johnson house in Grove Street, walk straight toward the house 

 opposite of yours, which is the one that sometimes has the BMX bike in the front 

 yard, until you are in the grass. Go to your right between that house and the one 

 next to it. Walk toward the corner and get the pistol. Go back to Grove Street and 

 find a drug dealer. He is dressed in black with his hands crossed down at his hips. 

 You will know he is a drug dealer because if you face him, he will try to do 

 business. You will get a pop-up display in the top-right part of your screen on 

 how to respond to him, even though you cannot actually buy anything. If you shoot 

 and kill him, he drops $2,000 dollars or more, and a gun just like that one you 

 picked up. Note: He will shoot back—try to get a headshot. There is another 

 drug dealer that is wearing a white hooded sweatshirt that does the same thing. 

 He can usually be found up in the northeast part of Los Santos. You can find 

 these dealers all over Los Santos in the areas littered with gangs. 

 

 Go to the building with the parachute. When you get to the top, spawn a Caddy. 

 Get in and drive slowly towards the edge of the building, then just fall off. 

 You will begin to flip slowly. However, if you nudge the edge of the building, 

 the Caddy will spin and flip like crazy. When you hit the ground, you will get a 

 very large insane stunt bonus. 

 

 Find the Inside Track Betting building in the Downtown area. Bet the maximum 

 amount on the horse with the worst odds. If you lose, reload the game and try 

 again. When you win, it will be a substantial amount. 

 

 Go to the Pig Pen Strip Club. You can jump on the big stage with the srtipper. 

 Stand directly in front of her, and people will throw $100 to her each time, 

 which you can collect. Be very careful not to touch her, or the guards will 

 start shooting at you. Note: This cheat takes awhile—eat before you go. 

 

 Get a weapon, then stand outside the your house in the Ganton area. Shoot your 

 homies (wearing green). Some of them will drop a lot of money. Pick it up, and 

 if you have a wanted level go inside and save the game. Repeat this to get a 

 large amount of money. 

 

 This trick requires maximum bike skill for both motorcycles and a regular bike. 

 Go to the highest building in Los Santos, the circular one, and jump off using 

 either the motorcycle or bike. While you are in mid-air, you can spin for a 

 little bit or try to do a back flip. Stay on the bikes until you land and you 

 will receive an insane stunt bonus for over $200. 

 

 Enable the“Kinky theme”code and enter the Ganton area with a nice car. 

 Drive up the alley were the burglar truck is located. Park there and within 

 seconds prostitutes will approach. Press Left to accept their offer, then get 

 out of your car and kill them when they are done. You will get more money than 

 paid. 

 

 Easy Stamina upgrade in Los Santos: 

 Go to the Ganton Gym in Los Santos. Go to the bicycle and start at level 1. 

 Work your way up to level 10. After awhile it will say that you have worked 

 to your limit and to return. Keep pedaling and your stamina will start to 

 increase. 

 

 Use the following trick to get a lot of weapons, increase your muscle, 

 increase your stamina, and get a“Hitman”rating with any weapon. After the 

 initial mission, go to the Verona beach area (on the south part of the map 

 near the ocean). There is a free open gym here. Use it to increase your muscle 

 and stamina. when you need to eat, there is a free hot dog stand down the path 

 east of the gym, or just save the game at your house. To get“Hitman”status 

 with any gun, find the weapon of your choice and shoot people or cars. 

 Try going to any parking lot and shooting cars. It is easier and they respawn 

 if you ride a short distance away and return. You can get as much money as 

 desired doing the fire truck missions, then going to the off track betting 

 after getting at least $10,000. Bet 10% of your money on the last horse until 

 you win. If you lose too much money, reload your game and return. Repeat this 

 process until you have a good amount of money. 

 

 

 Easy weapons in Los Santos: 

 ————————— 

 Drive around and hit Ballas. When they are dead, pick up their guns then get 

 back in your car and find more. This will get you a lot of weapons very fast. 

 

 

 Easy Hitman rating in Los Santos: 

 ——————————— 

 This trick requires a controller in port two. To get an easy Hitman rating 

 for either the 9 mm pistol or shotgun, go to the Los Santos Police Department. 

 Note the two player icon across the street. Quickly enter the Police 

 Department. Run and ignore any cops shooting at you and get the armor in the 

 locker room. It is the first room on your right. There is an available pistol 

 in the room on the right, at the far end of the hall. Proceed to dispose of 

 the police using your pistol. If you need ammunition, the cops will drop a 

 gun after you kill them. Your weapon skill will quickly raise as you kill the 

 swarms of police that come after you. Continue shooting until your armor level 

 becomes low or is gone. Then, run to the far end of the police station hall, 

 down the stairs, and into the holding cells. In the middle cell is more armor. 

 Use it and continue your massacre until your armor is once again depleted. 

 Next, quickly run out of the door and across the street to the two player 

 icon. Start two player mode. Simply kill the second player and your wanted 

 level will be gone and your health will be refilled. Repeat this to gain 

 Hitman status or simply gain ammunition. Note: Hitman status with the pistols 

 will allow duel wielding, faster firing, improved accuracy, lock-on range 

 increased and faster strafing. There is also a shotgun hidden in the police 

 station in the room on your left as you enter, then to the room at the right 

 at the end of that one. The shotgun may not respawn as soon as you enter, 

 but in at least 60 seconds one should appear. You can use this available 

 shotgun to reach Hitman status with. Note: Hitman status with the shotgun 

 only gives you improved accuracy, move while firing, faster firing rate and 

 lock-on range increased—not duel wielding. Duel wielding can only be 

 achieved with the sawed-off shotgun. 

 

 To raise your weapon skills quickly, enter a dance club, such as the 

 “Alhambra”in the Idlewood area. Begin shooting people with the weapon 

 of your choice. Doing so during the afternoon or night hours (12:00 to 04:00) 

 greatly increases the amount of people that respawn in the club. Since so 

 many people spawn, you have a virtually limitless amount of people to“train” 

 with. Doing so however, raises your wanted level greatly. Enable the 

 “Lower wanted level”code or know where the police bribes are, as you will 

 need them. 

 

 Go to the actual beach part of the Verona Beach area. Start shooting with 

 the desired gun. The cops will arrive after awhile, but you can make them 

 go away or just kill them for more. Keep doing this until the desired gun 

 is at Hitman level. It is possible to get four weapons up to Hitman level 

 in about an hour. 

 

 Walk out from CJ’s house and make sure there a car in his garage. Use any 

 weapon to shoot the car in the garage until it catches on fire. Walk away 

 and let the garage close Then, open it and repeat the steps. You can do 

 this with any weapon to get an easy Hitman level. 

 

 Go into the bar near CJ’s house in the Ganton area. Kill everyone there 

 and try to get a two or three star wanted level. Start killing the police 

 that come through the door. When no one remains, turn around and look. 

 They should be there. 

 

 Go to your house in Grove Street. Start randomly killing people until 

 you have two star wanted level. Kill all the cops with any desired weapon. 

 Make sure you have armor on. When you have low health, save the game, then 

 repeat. 

 

 

 Easy races: 

 ———– 

 Before you enter a race, enable the“Cars fly away”code. During the countdown,

 until they take off. Run over all the racers and ram their cars. 

 

 

 Easy Pilot license: 

 ——————- 

 Go to the airport in San Fierro and enable the“Spawn Jetpack”code. 

 Enter the Shamel jet and enable the“Speed up time”code. Fly it until a 

 message appears in the corner. Fly it for about five or ten more minutes 

 and you will have a pilot license without going to pilot school. Note: 

 Make sure you save the game. 

 

 

 Saving money: 

 ————- 

 Buy lots of ammunition for the Tec-9 which costs about $300. When you 

 have enough, buy one SMG. The game will transfer all your Tec-9 ammunition 

 into your SMG, saving you thousands of dollars. Note: This does not work 

 for the pistols, rifles, or thrown weapons. 

 

 

 Free Pay N’Spray: 

 —————— 

 Get a car that can be used for the pimping missions. Go to a Pay N’Spray. 

 When the door is closing, start the pimping missions. Then, deactivate the 

 missions after the door has closed and is re-opening. The door will open 

 again, giving you a free spray. You can repeat this as many times as desired. 

 

 

 Cheap car bomb: 

 ————— 

 Get a fast car or a motorcycle. Either shoot the vehicle or bang it up real 

 good. When it is on fire, jump out. This technique is also good for taking 

 over hoods quickly and easily. 

 

 

 Descend quickly: 

 —————- 

 When stuck at the top of a cliff or mountain and you need to go to the bottom, 

 do not bother going the long way around to get down safely. Instead, edge 

 yourself to the end of the cliff/mountain and slowly but surely you will 

 slide down the side and land safely at the bottom. 

 

 

 Lose weight quickly: 

 ——————– 

 If you want to lose weight quickly, enable the“Speed up time”code.

 Basketball Challenge mini-game: 

 ——————————- 

 Go to one of the basketball courts that have full courts and a chain link 

 fence round them. One of the hoops will have a basketball. Walk up to the 

 basketball and start playing. While playing basketball, start the Basketball 

 Challenge mini-game. A red marker will appear on the court. Run to the red 

 marker and shoot the ball. If you make the shot, the red marker will move 

 to a new spot on the court. The goal of the mini-game is to sink as many 

 shots as you can before time runs out. Each shot you make adds a few seconds 

 on to the clock. When time runs out, CJ will automatically resume playing 

 basketball. Your highest score will be recorded and shown the next time you 

 play the Basketball Challenge mini-game. 

 

 

 Play basketball in Los Santos: 

 —————————— 

 After completing the Taggin Up Turf mission, you can go beside Sweet’s house. 

 There will be a basketball court with a basketball in the middle. Walk up to 

 it and start playing basketball. Note: You can only play by yourself. 

 

 

 Play pool and arcade games in Los Santos: 

 —————————————– 

 Go out of CJ’s neighborhood in Ganton. At night, you will see a bar with 

 beer bottles flashing on top of it. It is next to the bridge. Go inside the 

 bar, and there will be a man next to the pool table. Walk up to him and play 

 a game of pool. You can also bet money on the game. There are also arcade 

 games you can play in the bar. 

 

 

 Bet on horses: 

 ————– 

 Near the Downtown and Mulholland Intersection areas (under the highway, 

 next to the big parking lot), is a building called Inside Track Betting 

 (with red/pink/blue posters). The entrance is just in front of it, and 

 you can play a horse race game. You first bet on one of the horse to win, 

 then the amount of money. Afterwards you can see the race. 

 

 

 Vending machines: 

 —————– 

 When you find a vending machine that serves chips, zoom in on it with 

 a pistol or rifle. It is blurry, but you can tell that the chips inside 

 the machine are real-life brands. Some chips that can be easily identified 

 are Doritos, Lay’s Potato Chips, and Munchos, to name a few. 

 

 

 Breaking fences: 

 —————- 

 Walk up to a fence and either punch it or cut it with a chainsaw. 

 

 

 Climbing trees: 

 ————— 

 To climb a tree, find a ledge that will allow you to jump to the branches 

 at the top of a tree. If you hit them correctly, CJ should grab onto the 

 branches and allow you to pull him up. There is an easily accessible one 

 just outside of Glen Park Hospital to practice with. 

 

 

 Destroying cars quickly: 

 ———————— 

 To quickly blow up cars, shoot the gas tank. This is useful when killing 

 a lot of people at once.

 Use a sniper rifle to shoot the moon to make it expand, then shrink in size. 

 

 

 Eating too much: 

 —————- 

 If you eat too much in a restaurant you will vomit on the floor and the 

 cashier will laugh at you. After this happens, you cannot eat again for a 

 while. 

 

 

 Effects of being fat: 

 ——————— 

 When you are fat, CJ will say different phrases. For example, when you are 

 fighting he will say“I got weight on my side,”or“I may be big, but I 

 ain’t slow”. The downside to being fat is that when your body fat meter 

 gets full, you run the risk of having a heart attack. This only happens in 

 very rare circumstances. You will return to the nearest hospital. Also, 

 if you have no muscle stat, or very little, you may not be able to climb 

 high walls or“super sprint”. When fat, CJ will waddle around like a penguin, 

 and if you look closely (this happens with no shirt) the fat on his body 

 will wobble. 

 

 

 Take a photo of yourself: 

 ————————- 

 Have the camera active as your current weapon, then target a member of your 

 own gang. Give them the camera and they will snap a picture of CJ. 

 

 

 Radio stations diss each other: 

 ——————————- 

 Listen to Radio Los Santos and K-DST. On Radio Los Santos, at times between 

 songs, Julio G. (station DJ) will make fun of the Playback FM DJ, saying 

 “Playback FM has some cool records, but the DJ is wack,”and Tommy“Nightmare” 

 Smith, (K-DST DJ) will make fun of the Radio X DJ, usually just before the 

 song“Running Down a Dream”. He will say,“You know, I can’t bear that chick 

 on Radio X, or is it Rock X, Rock…listen sweetheart, get over it.” 

 

 

 Radio shout-out from Denise: 

 —————————- 

 After you obtain Denise as you girlfriend after the Burning Desire mission, 

 listen to Radio Los Santos. At times between songs, Julio G. (the DJ) will 

 have a shout-out from Denise to you, and at the end he criticizes the shout 

 out by saying“I got a shout out from Denise in Ganton who says she misses 

 her boy desperately. And I quote, desperately. Hey, you know, this isn’t 

 Lonely Hearts, this is Radio Los Santos.” 

 

 

 Screensaver: 

 ———— 

 Allow the game to idle for a few minutes. The HUD will disappear and the game 

 will zoom in on other nearby people instead of CJ. 

 

 

 Wanted level officers, weapons, and vehicles: 

 ——————————————— 

 Depending on your wanted level, different law enforcement vehicles, officers, 

 and weapons will be used against you: 

 

 One star: Police officers on foot, in cars, and HPV1000s (police bikes) will 

 go after you. They have 9mms and nightsticks. If you do not have a gun out, 

 they will try to beat you with their nightsticks. If you have a gun out, they 

 will shoot. 

 

 Two stars: Police officers in cars and HPV1000s will come after you. They 

 will have 9mms and nightsticks, although they will not use their nightsticks. 

 They will shoot at you no matter what. If you are in a car, cops will drive 

 faster after you. 

 

 Three stars: Police officers in cars will go after you. They will have the 

 same weapons. Police choppers are now involved and shoot you from their guns. 

 Police cars will go fast enough to be able to keep up with you and roadblocks 

 will be in place at times, with officers shooting 9mms at your car. 

 

 Four stars: Cops in cars and SWAT officers will come after you in Enforcers 

 (SWAT vans). SWAT officers will now rappel from the police choppers. SWAT 

 officers are now in roadblocks and SWAT officers will have Micro SMGs. If 

 you are in an aircraft, a Hydra will go after you to shoot you down. 

 

 Five stars: FBI agents will go after you with FBI Ranchers. Most authorities 

 going after you will be the FBI; there will be less cop and SWAT cars. 

 The police chopper still goes after you, and the FBI will replace the 

 SWAT men in roadblocks. FBI agents carry SMGs. 

 

 Six stars: Military soldiers will go after you in Rhinos (tanks) and 

 Barracks trucks. They will replace the FBI in roadblocks. The army will 

 carry M4s. 

 

 

 Saving gang members: 

 ——————– 

 To save a gang member or bodyguard when you turn off the game, go to your 

 safe house. Go to your garage, run in the garage with your bodyguards. 

 Run out without your bodyguards, and then save the game. 

 

 

 Taking over gang territories easily: 

 ———————————— 

 An easy way to take over territories is to find a high place like a roof 

 top. First, kill a few gang members to start the war, then get onto a roof. 

 When you are up there, they will still shoot at you, but will not have 

 accurate aim and will miss frequently. 

 

 Note: It is recommended that the“Air Strip”missions be completed first. 

 To easily take over territories, go to the airstrip and take the Jetpack. 

 Go to any enemy territory and start a gang war by killing some enemy gang 

 members. Fly and land on any building roof you can easily see incoming 

 enemy gang members. Kill all gang members from up there. By doing this, 

 you can easily hold all enemy territories. Be patient when killing gang 

 members, and try to stay inside the war zone. The distance between the 

 airstrip and enemy territories is long, but this is the easiest way to 

 quickly and safely hold enemy gang territories. All territories can be 

 held by using the Jetpack, but only one by one. 

 

 

 Keep gang territory easily: 

 ————————— 

 If your gang turf is under attack, go to a save point and save the game. 

 When it is done saving, your turf will no longer be under attack and it 

 will still be yours. Additionally, when your hood is under attack, find 

 a police car or motorcycle, fire truck, ambulance, or taxi. Get in and 

 start the vehicle’s missions. Then, exit the missions and your hood will 

 be safe. 

 

 

 Gang member race: 

 —————– 

 You can do this trick in any race mission with the checkered flag on your 

 map. Bring a gang member with you. You can even bring three if the race 

 is with a four door car. Walk into the red mission circle. Select a race 

 and when it starts and counts down, you will see your gang member spawn 

 to the street and walk towards your car. The races will start, and you 

 must wait a moment before he gets in your car. 

 

 

 Manual aim with any weapon while driving: 

 —————————————– 

 Enable the“Manual weapon drive bys in cars”code and run out of bullets 

 in your Uzi, Tec-9, or Micro SMG. Get out of your vehicle, then select 

 the weapon of your choice (except grenades and rocket launchers). Get 

 back into the vehicle and enable any“Weapons”code. The crosshairs are 

 back on and you can shoot that weapon. 

 

 

 Hit pedestrian with the front of your shotgun: 

 ———————————————- 

 Note: This cannot be done with more than two weapons. Get a melee weapon 

 (baseball bat, dildo, or a police nightstick) and an ordinary shotgun. 

 If you have more than those two weapons this trick cannot be done. Switch 

 to your melee weapon. Walk up to a pedestrian and hit them, then immediately 

 switch to your shotgun. If done correctly, CJ should hit the pedestrian 

 with the shotgun as if he were using it as a melee weapon. 

 

 

 Roboi’s Food Mart asset in Los Santos: 

 ————————————– 

 Go to the 24-7 store located near the Conference Center area. Outside the 

 front parking lot will be a bike. Get on the bike and you will automatically 

 begin the courier missions, which require you to deliver packages thought 

 Los Santos by throwing them through rings at the destination. After completing 

 three levels you will acquire the 24-7 store. Use the bike that was in front 

 of to collect up to $2,000. 

 

 

 Reach hidden areas in Los Santos: 

 ——————————— 

 Enter the Ganton Gym and spawn the Jetpack. Go over the arrow, out but do not 

 go out. Fly up through a blank tile. An all-black area will appear. Use the 

 thermal goggles to see all the people you have killed. You can also see an 

 illegal tattoo parlor, a tornado, a hidden city in your garage in San Fierro, 

 a tornadom and other things. Do not lose height or you will have to kill 

 yourself when you land. 

 

 

 Spray paint as a weapon: 

 ———————— 

 The spray paint is not only meant for spraying tags. It also can be used as 

 a weapon. Aim the spray paint in the direction of a pedestrian and they will 

 lean forward, coughing.

 will find a large purple dildo that can be used to hit people. There is 

 also a PR-24 (nightstick) in the police station as well. You can pick up the 

 dildo and the PR-24 without anything happening, but when you take the shotgun 

 you will get two stars on your wanted meter. 

 

 Go to the small town of Dillimore near Red County. Find the police station 

 with the garage opened up outside. Unequip your weapon and enter the police 

 station by walking over the entrance marker. Once inside, proceed into the 

 hallway ahead of you and take the first right into a locker room. In this l 

 ocker room will be body armor and a night stick. Keep walking behind the 

 locker room, and there will be an opening in the wall with a large walk-in 

 shower. Proceed into the shower and take an immediate right. You will see 

 a pink dildo spinning. You can pick this up as your melee weapon and begin 

 dildo-bashing people.

 Shotgun in Los Santos: 

 ———————- 

 When you rob the pizzeria with Ryder in the beginning of the game, instead

 for the shotgun. Note: This works better if you get the brass knuckles 

 found underneath the over pass near your hood.

 The complex can only be entered by jumping the wall, going through the 

 boxcar warehouse, or by an opening to the right of the warehouse. 

 The boxcar warehouse has a sawed-off shotgun (you will need a car to 

 get it) in one of the cars, a plank bridge that leads to body armor,

 one, there is one on top of the mountain near a Camper and a Journey. 

 Equip your parachute and jump on the mountain bike. You should trigger 

 the downhill race. Then, jump off the edge with the bike, but before 

 you jump off and deploy your parachute. You should spawn back on top 

 with the bike, but with your parachute still deployed. 

 

 

 Helicopter in garage in San Fierro: 

 ———————————– 

 Occasionally at the helipad that is guarded with a police garage not 

 far from it, if you go into the garage when the helicopter is present, 

 you will find another helicopter at the bottom floor of the garage. 

 

 

 Chopper does not chop: 

 ———————- 

 Shoot some people and/or police to get a least a three start wanted 

 level. Then, enable the“Spawn Jetpack”code and fly up. Wait for a 

 helicopter to arrive. When it does, try to land on top of it. When 

 you do, the blades will not chop you up. 

 

 

 Backflipping Packer: 

 ——————- 

 Get a Monster truck and drive down by the docks in Los Santos until 

 you see a Packer. Line up the Monster with the back end of the Packer 

 and drive up the ramp. This should send the Packer up in the air and 

 do backflips. 

 

 

 Somersaulting Rhino: 

 ——————– 

 Go to Los Santos International Airport, and use the“Spawn Jetpack” 

 code to reach the top of the communications tower. Once on the top, 

 there is a small circular platform with a thin platform around it, 

 with just enough room to stand on. Stand on it, and make sure it is 

 the border around the very top platform. Enable the“Spawn Rhino tank” 

 code. If done correctly, the tank will spawn and immediately ricochet 

 off the top and do multiple spins and somersaults in the air before 

 finally hitting the ground below. This can be very funny if done 

 correctly. 

 

 

 Gang members in house: 

 ———————- 

 Make a gang, with however many members as desired. Then, go inside 

 your house and press Up to call for your gang to follow. They cannot 

 go inside the house. Save the game. When you are done, they will be 

 standing in the kitchen. You can shoot them, punch them, or walk 

 through them with nothing happening to them. They will talk to you, 

 but they do not move and nothing hurts them. 

 

 

 Invincible zombie: 

 —————— 

 Find a cab driving around with a passenger. Note: This may also work with other 

 cars and your gang members. Take the car and drive it into water (best done at 

 the Glen Park area in Los Santos). Get out of the car as it is driving into the 

 water and go ashore, so you can see the passenger trying to swim. After a short 

 while he or she will be dead, still are trying to swim. Aim at the person and 

 the target will appear black, indicating that the person is dead. Fire at the 

 car’s gas tank to make it explode and send the person flying ashore. They will 

 now run around for awhile, then act like a normal person. However, they will be 

 invincible and will still be targeted black. 

 

 

 Zombie homies: 

 ————– 

 Wield a knife (tier 2 weapon), and walk up behind one of your fellow gang members. 

 Target him and press Up to recruit him into your posse. Before he can turn around, 

 cut his throat. Note that after you do so, he will fall to the ground quite 

 differently than the other members of the population. As soon as he hits the ground, 

 he will rise back up“from the dead”. 

 

 

 Moving fire: 

 ———— 

 Notice that when you use your flamethrower and are aimed at the floor, you create 

 a small flame or a few that expire in awhile. When they begin to arise, the fire 

 truck arrives and extinguishes the fire. To do this glitch, eat something beforehand 

 to prevent hunger. This may take some time. Do a fire line with your flamethrower of 

 at least four flames horizontally with no cops nearby (or they begin to chase you). 

 Keep watching the fire, centering by using the camera view, trying not to move CJ 

 nly if necessary. If the fire truck arrives to extinguish the fire, repeat this until 

 you get a whirlwind of fire of a decent size. When you get it, it cannot be 

 extinguished. If you keep it centered with the camera view and watch, after awhile 

 the fire truck leaves the fire alone. The fire physics are strange, but if you move 

 Right slowly and walk just a little bit, you can aim the fire. Keep doing this and 

 you can move it in a certain direction. Do not worry if the flames are close to you, 

 they do not cause damage until you move CJ to the flames. If there are pedestrians 

 walking to the flames ,they will not suffer any damage, even though they do not 

 runaway. However, vehicles can take damage. To make them explode they must be stopped 

 for a certain period of time. Try it on traffic lights or when another vehicle is 

 blocking the path. This is particularly useful on highways where cars travel at high 

 speed. There are multiple wrecks and you can wait to watch them all explode. 

 You will not get a wanted level for doing this. 

 

 

 Wear night vision goggles without their effect: 

 ———————————————– 

 Activate the night vision goggles and play any type of arcade game (They Came From 

 Uranus, etc.). When you exit the arcade game, CJ will still be wearing the goggles, 

 but their effect is not there. 

 

 

 Remote explosives go through door: 

 ———————————- 

 Buy some remote explosives at Ammu-Nation, then steal a car. Get out of the car and 

 throw one at the drivers door, then open the door. The explosive will stay in the 

 same place, and the door will go through it. 

 

 

 No explosion: 

 ————- 

 Go into Ammu-Nation. There will be a red circle to go into shooting practice. Get 

 close to that circle, then throw over twenty remote explosives at that door. Without 

 pressing the remote, step in the red circle. You will go to the target practice. 

 Complete round 1, then quit. When your out of target practice, notice there are no 

 explosives by the door, but you still have the remote. Press the remote. and there 

 will be no explosion. 

 

 

 Fall through ground in Flint County: 

 ———————————— 

 Go to Flint County. There should be a road to follow. Drive on it, and you will see 

 a wall that leads off the to the side. If you drive up and down that wall, you should 

 fall through the ground. You may have to do it a few times. You must hug the wall 

 for this glitch to occur. Additionally, go to your safe house in Prickle Pine. Enable 

 the“CJ jumps higher”code. Enter the safe house. Turn towards the entrance and jump 

 up. You should go over the wall and fall into blackness until you land in a field of 

 grey. In front of you should be an incomplete version of the are where you saved 

 Denise. Buildings will be missing, but you can physically touch them. You should 

 also see white letters that read“Ganton”,“North Rock”, and“Downtown”. Stand in 

 front of it and mark the Four Dragons Casino. Then, enable the“Spawn Jetpack” 

 code and fly it toward the casino. You should eventually see an armor pickup, a 

 uzi pickup, a pistol pickup, and a money pickup that contains $15,000 at most. You 

 should also see four white doors, but they have the wall physics around them. 

 

 

 Walk or drive underwater in Flint County: 

 —————————————– 

 Go to the bottom of the water at the end of the island in Flint county. Enable the 

 “Maximum lung capacity”code, then swim down to where you see two rocks and a large 

 starfish. Swim behind the biggest rock. Sooner or later, you will be able to walk 

 on the bottom of the ocean. You can spawn vehicles and fire weapons. 

 Note: Do not get out of the water or try to fly a plane or you will have to do this 

 all over. Also, if you go too close to shore or out too far, you will respawn on 

 the nearest island. This glitch may take a lot of time to do and requires patience. 

 

 

 Invisible spray paint in Los Santos: 

 ———————————— 

 When in CJ’s home, get the spray paint can from his bedroom. Go to his lobby and 

 spray in front off his mirror at a certain distance. You will not see the spray 

 in the mirror when spraying. 

 

 

 Missing gun in Los Santos: 

 ————————– 

 Have a gun capable of doing drive-bys and go on a date with Denise riding in a 

 motorcycle. If she asks if you want some“coffee”, say“Yes”. When you are done and 

 get back on your bike, you will not have the gun out. This will fix itself when you 

 get off the bike. 

 

 

 Fall through ground in Los Santos: 

 ———————————- 

 There is a property to buy directly above Madd Dogg’s mansion in the Mullholland 

 area. You do not have to have buy it; just go there. In the back is a waterless 

 pool and a wall on the east side. Walk up against it and you will fall through an 

 invisible wall and continue falling until you reappear back on the ground. You can 

 use the Jetpack to fly around in blue hell. 

 

 Go to the building where the mission“End Of The Line”took place, where you killed 

 Big Smoke. Note: This will not work after you complete the mission—you should be 

 playing a new file to do this. Get a car and ram the wall in the front. You should 

 either break the wall and go through or break the wall and get pushed back from the 

 impact. Then, drive in and you will fall through the ground and end up back on the 

 street. Sometimes your car will disappear when you get put back on the street. If 

 you walk in, you will fall but when you are put back on the street you will not 

 lose any health. 

 

 Go to the Ganton gym and park a car in the doorway, with the hood touching the door. 

 Get out, jump on the hood, and walk inside. Once inside, walk back out again. You 

 will appear in a hallway. Walk towards the wall, and you will fall through the world. 

 

 Walk behind the Mullholland safe house to the pool. Face the side that has five 

 windows. Walk into the one closest to the corner. If you do not automatically fall, 

 walk to where the iron support beams end. You will start falling. In a few seconds 

 you will land around the billboard that is in front of the Vinewood sign. 

 

 

 Fly under city in Los Santos: 

 —————————— 

 Go to the Ganton gym and park a car in the doorway, with the hood touching the door. 

 Get out, jump on the hood, and walk inside. Once inside, you will appear in a hallway. 

 Enable the“Spawn Jetpack”code and wear it. Walk towards the wall, and you will fall 

 a short distance, then be able to fly under the city. 

 

 

 C.J. dies dancing in Los Santos: 

 ——————————– 

 Enable the“Pedestrians riot”and“Pedestrians have weapons”codes. Enter the dance 

 club and start the dance challenge. During the dance, a pedestrian may have a rocket 

 launcher and start shooting. More people will come in and watch you dance. If the 

 pedestrians are too close, then you will be inflicted with damage from the rocket 

 launcher. If your damage has passed the point of making you wasted, when the dance 

 is over the message will appear stating that you can dance to a harder track. After 

 the message disappears, C.J. will drop to the floor dead. 

 

 

 Late death in Los Santos: 

 ————————- 

 Go to the police station (where there is a toll gate with a policeman standing next 

 to it). Hijack any police vehicle. Note: If you hijack a car or do a crime in that 

 area, this will not work. Then, go in front of the gate and wait for him to open it. 

 Once he does, go inside and go straight. Stay in your vehicle. Park next to the 

 garage door then get out of your vehicle. Once out, go next to the building and 

 your will see another booth next to the building. Go inside and kill the guard. 

 Then, kill the booth man next to the gate. Once this is done, go in the garage 

 through the fire exit. Then, go next to a policeman so that he points his gun at 

 you. He should say that he needs backup into his radio. Kill him with a gun. If 

 done correctly, he should be dead, but still standing. Once he gets off the radio, 

 he should fall down and die. 

 

 

 Fall through map in Red County: 

 ——————————- 

 Get a police bike, and go to the section of the tracks that leads to Red County if 

 you keep driving. Keep moving your bike against the right side so that it sparks 

 severely, but does not crash. After about 30 seconds, you should fall through the 

 map. The bike will fall and disappear, and CJ will appear somewhere on the map 

 randomly. 

 

 

 Walk through wall in Red County: 

 ——————————– 

 When you are by your house on the hills directly behind the“Vinewood”sign, go 

 behind the house where the pool is located. Walk over to the wall and go straight, 

 where another wall meets that wall. You will be able to walk through the wall, and 

 if you walk in the correcl location, you will fall and the“Loading”message will 

 appear. The game will place you on a road below the“Vinewood”sign. 

 

 

 Hospital underworld gateway in San Fierro: 

 —————————————— 

 Go to San Fierro’s hospital. There are two different buildings that are connected 

 by a walkway that is over the road. Go towards the western building (hospital) were 

 the cane is located. (where you get dropped off when you visit the hospital). To 

 your left should be an ambulance. Go towards the ambulance, and face the east 

 building“across the road”. As you look across the road, you will see doors and a 

 part of the building (hospital) that sticks out. Fly between the doors and the part 

 of the building that is sticking out to reach the gateway to get in the hospital 

 underworld. To get back to the real world, sink down to the endless pit. CJ will 

 respawn at the closest street. You can also fly though the opening of the hospital 

 where you first entered the underworld. 

 

 

 Climb a 100 ft. tree in Whetstone: 

 ———————————- 

 Located in the Back O Beyond area is a tree that is leaning over a swamp. CJ can 

 walk up the tree. Note: If you fall off, make sure you have completed the Paramedic 

 missions so that you do not die. 

 

 

 Strange water in Whetstone: 

 ————————— 

 Go to the Back O Beyond area. The swamp water there completely makes any vehicle 

 disappear, while in the water. 

 

 

 Falling pedestrians: 

 ——————– 

 Enable the“Recruit anyone into your gang”code. Recruit three pedestrians, then 

 get into an ambulance. Enable the“Flying cars”code and take off (best done from 

 your house). Gain altitude for about one minute, then start the ambulance missions. 

 Your pedestrians will bail out of the ambulance. 

 

 

 Walk on air: 

 ———— 

 When in a helicopter, fly above the giant bridge and try to land in the middle. The 

 helicopter will land in mid air, and you can get out and walk around in the air. 

 

 

 Die in air: 

 ———– 

 Note: This cannot be done if you completed all the missions in San Fierro. Spawn a 

 plane and a parachute. Fly north of San Fierro. Go over the bridge and to the land. 

 Then, go back and jump out and land on the thing with a parachute. Get that parachute 

 and jump towards San Fierro. Activate the parachute and CJ will die in the air. 

 

 

 Run underwater: 

 ————— 

 Start two player mode and get in a Leviathan helicopter. Land in the ocean. Have 

 the player in the passenger side hijack the driver. He will fall straight into the 

 ocean and be able to just walk around and shoot instead of swim. 

 

 

 Swim in first person view: 

 ————————– 

 Get a rocket launcher or sniper rifle and go near a body of water. Jump in, and 

 before you hit the water, aim and hold it. You should be in the aiming mode of 

 that gun. This also works with other guns. 

 

 

 Floating breasts: 

 —————– 

 Start two player mode and choose the prostitute. Enable the“Spawn Jetpack”code 

 and turn the camera towards her. 

 

 

 Change song on radio: 

 ——————— 

 While in any vehicle except for anything involving the law (police, army or 

 ambulance), set it on any radio station you desire. Then, enable the“Spawn 

 Jetpack”code. If done correctly, the last song that was playing on that radio 

 station should be different. CJ will also be wearing a Jetpack inside the car, 

 and his legs will be going through the bottom. 

 

 

 Dancing Packer: 

 ————— 

 Find a Packer. Move Down so that the railing moves up. Then, get out and walk up 

 the ramp. You will either do one of two things. You will stop but remain walking 

 (if this happens, jump); or you will walk straight. As soon as you get under the 

 top ramp, the packer will do some crazy things, such as tilt so that only one side 

 of tires is touching the ground. 

 

 

 Invincible car: 

 ————— 

 Steal a car, drive it to a safe location, and get out of it. Attach a remote bomb 

 to the hood. Get back into the car and any car you hit with the one you are driving 

 will explode. Your car will not sustain any damage and you will not lose any health. 

 

 

 Invincible flaming car: 

 ———————– 

 Enable the“Deadly vehicle”code. Get in a car then get out and have a few vehicles 

 hit it. The car should start smoking and erupt into flames. Get in the car and it will 

 remain flaming, but will not explode. 

 

 

 Car falls through ocean bottom: 

 ——————————- 

 Enable the“Maximum lung capacity”code. Get in any vehicle and drive into the ocean. 

 You will slowly sink. Remain in car and it will get dark as you go further down. You 

 will go through the ocean bottom. Stay in car and you will sink for about thirty more 

 seconds before respawning near the closest road to the ocean. 

 

 

 Tree through car: 

 —————– 

 This is best done when at a location with a tree that can be knocked down and a 

 store you can enter. Get a car and drive it into the tree. This should knock it 

 down. Park the car directly over where the tree once stood. Enter the store by 

 using the yellow upside down triangle, then exit. The tree will now be sticking 

 out of your car. 

 

 

 Decapitated CJ: 

 ————— 

 After obtaining a katana, find a two player icon and activate multi-player mode. 

 Have player two decapitate CJ. Exit out of two player mode, and CJ will have no 

 head. Additionally, play in two player mode with Denise and have the other player 

 cut off your head. You will lose the mission, but then can continue playing without 

 a head and bleed forever. 

 

 

 Stuck playing basketball: 

 ————————- 

 While in the Jetpack, if you play basketball you will get stuck and have to re-load 

 the game. 

 

 

 Sub Urban turns into Ammu-Nation: 

 ——————————— 

 While at any Sub Urban store, take out a camera and zoom in on the mirror that is 

 close to the changing area. The mirror will disappear, and you can see the interior 

 of an Ammu-Nation. 

 

 

 Late cashier death: 

 ——————- 

 When at a fast food restaurant (such as Cluckin’Bell or Well Stacked Pizza), have 

 a gun with you (preferably a pistol), Go into a corner and aim. Walk up to the 

 counter and put the cross-hairs on the cashier’s head. Shoot the cashier, and wait. 

 The cashier should back up with their hands raised, say something, then fall to 

 the floor. Note: This best done at Cluckin’Bell. 

 

 

 T Bone in two places at once in Mike Toreno mission: 

 —————————————————- 

 Drive the car into the water and swim away. T Bone will be still in the car, but 

 will not die. Get another car, ignoring the“You left T Bone behind”message. Drive 

 to the airport. While going there, you can still hear T Bone talking. As you arrive, 

 shoot at the targets and watch the intermission sequence featuring T Bone getting 

 Mike Toreno out. 

 

 

 Floating guns in Wrong Side Of The Tracks mission: 

 ————————————————– 

 There are four Latino gang members on top of the train that you have must catch 

 and kill. They have guns that they will shoot you with. Fail the mission inten- 

 tionally, then find the train that they where on. Instead of gang members, you 

 will see instead see floating guns that move and fire at you; they are invincible. 

 

 

 Flying fish: 

 ———— 

 Get a rocket or grenade launcher and go near a river or beach with fish. Shoot 

 the fish with a rocket or grenade. The fish will fly out of the water and swim 

 around in mid air. 

 

 Go to any beach area. Swim a little bit underwater to find a school of fish, 

 dolphin, or turtle in the shallow parts. Get back to the beach where you are 

 neck deep in the water, but still able to use a weapon. Aim the rocket launcher 

 in the part of water where you last saw the aforementioned aquatic life. Fire 

 off a few rockets. If all goes well, you should see a splash on the surface of 

 the water and whatever you shot will come out and start flying around in the 

 air. 

 

 

 Flying Tanker: 

 ————– 

 Steal a Tractor, and grab onto a Tanker (tractor-trailer truck/18 wheeler). Back 

 up to the front of the Tanker and latch on to it. Drive forward, then turn sharply 

 into circles. The Tanker should go flying through the air. This may require several 

 attempts. 

 

 

 Misspelling in Los Santos: 

 ————————– 

 In Downtown Los Santos, there is an Atrium. (you fight inside it in Big Smoke’s 

 mission, Just Business). There are two entrances; a front and a side. When you 

 enter the front door, the corner display correctly shows“Atrium”. However, if 

 you enter the side door, the corner display shows that you entered the“Attrium”. 

 

 

 Misspelling in San Fierro: 

 ————————– 

 In San Fierro, the gym is called“Cobra Marital Arts”instead of“Cobra Martial 

 Arts”. 

 

 

 Jump through window in Las Venturas: 

 ———————————— 

 Near the safehouse where your girlfriend Millie lives (directly east from the 

 Abandoned AC Tower; costs $50,000) are windows that you can jump through. Climb 

 the wall beside the house and jump on the roof. You can go through the windows. 

 You can see your garage, shoot people through the window, and if you get a wanted 

 level of 2 or more, can get policemen trapped in your garage. Be careful; when 

 you jump through the window and want to get out you must step back from the 

 window and jump until you can cling onto it, then climb back up. 

 

 

 Wrong casino name in Las Venturas: 

 ———————————- 

 Check the map that was included with the game. Look in Las Venturas near the 

 casino entitled“The Clown’s Pocket.”This casino cannot be found, because it 

 is named“The Ringmaster”on this map. However, in the game it is called“The 

 Clown’s Pocket.” 

 

 

 CJ spontaneously combusts in Whetstone: 

 ————————————— 

 Go to the level area of ground at the peak of Mt. Chiliad, where the mountain 

 bike race is located. Take out a rocket launcher. Aim at the Mountain Bike. The 

 green reticule will home in on the bike. Fire at the bike and blow it up. Then, 

 aim at the bike again, manually. Note: The second time around, the reticule will 

 not automatically aim on the“wreckage”of the bike. When you fire a second 

 missile at the bike, CJ will catch fire. You can be 30 feet away and still catch 

 fire. Also, the same effect has occurs when firing a missile at the bike to 

 “blow it up”, then shooting it with a sniper rifle. However when using the rifle 

 it will usually require two or three rounds before CJ catches on fire. 

 

 

 Feet appear through bottom of car: 

 ———————————- 

 Enter a car and enable the“Spawn Jetpack”code. Your feet will appear through 

 the bottom of the car. This also works with planes and helicopters. With bikes, 

 CJ will appear to be standing up on the bike. 

 

 

 Bicycle catches on fire: 

 ———————— 

 If a bicycle is upside down, it will catch on fire. However, it is very difficult 

 to get bicycle to stay upside down. 

 

 

 Lowrider remains in position: 

 —————————– 

 Get a lowrider with hydraulics. Put the car in any hydraulic position desired. 

 While holding the car in that direction, get out. You can see the car remain 

 that way. For example, have the back of the car raised in the air. 

 

 

 Lowrider lights: 

 —————- 

 When in a lowrider at night, look at the headlights and bounce the car up and 

 down. Notice that the lights on the ground stay in one location while the lights 

 on the car move up and down. 

 

 

 Buy hotdogs from dead vendor in Los Santos: 

 ——————————————- 

 Go to the end of the pier with a Ferris wheel. Enable the“Weapons”code and 

 obtain a rocket launcher. Find the hot dog stand at the far end. Shoot it with 

 a rocket launcher. Jump in the water under the pier, and you should see the 

 stand floating in the water. You can still buy hotdogs, even the vendor is dead. 

 

 

 Wrong restaurant name: 

 ———————- 

 Go to the Cluckin’Bell. Take out a sniper rifle and look at the cups hanging 

 on the wall. They say“Burger Shot”. 

 

 

 Wrong dialogue in Los Santos: 

 —————————– 

 During the Reuniting The Families mission, the police helicopter announces that 

 they are the“Los Angeles Police Department”instead of the“Los Santos Police 

 Department”. 

 

 

 Camera in Los Santos: 

 ——————— 

 Go in CJ’s bedroom. There will be a camera beside the bed. Also, once you complete 

 a certain mission, there will also be a can of spray paint in there. 

 

 

 Reaching other cities early: 

 —————————- 

 Hijack the train. The easiest way to do this is when it is at one of the stations. 

 Then, drive it full speed to the bridges to the other islands. You may need to use 

 the entire city to pick up enough speed. Also, you must be careful around sharp 

 turns. The train will de-rail. Note: This was done with the freight train. When 

 you approach the bridge at the edge of the city, you will slow down, even if you 

 are going very fast. The train will pass through the barricade, as if it were a 

 ghost. You will get a four star wanted level. There is a police bribe on the train 

 tracks in the second city that you will pick up if you pass by it on the train, but 

 your wanted level will immediately jump back to four stars. Also, the train is 

 bullet proof. You cannot die from bullets when inside the train. 

 

 When in Los Santos, you will find that all bridges to the other two regions will 

 be blocked by blockades. Sometimes if you try to go through the blockade at high 

 speed with a fast vehicle, it will go through and glitch, along with the AI 

 vehicles that are following. 

 

 Enable the“Wanted level never increases”and“Flying car”codes. You can now go 

 to all of San Andreas without the four star wanted level appearing. 

 Note: This must be done again every time you load a saved game. Also, if you 

 shoot cops with the“Wanted level never increases”code enabled, some cops will 

 get out and walk away but others will fire their guns at you. 

 

 The following is a multi-step process which may take some time to get correct. 

 Get the parachute located on top of the very tall building a few blocks from 

 the police station in downtown Los Santos. The building is shaped circular 

 inside and“L”shaped on your map. Walk around to the northeast corner of the 

 circular building and step into the yellow triangle to get the parachute that 

 is on the roof. Take it, and keep it (do not switch to a weapon). Go back 

 down and get armor from the police station. It is nearby and has two sets. 

 Do not draw a weapon in the station or you will get a two star wanted level. 

 Next, get the jet at LSX, the airport at Los Santos. Drive up to the gate, 

 climb up on your car, and onto the guard booth, and climb over into the airport. 

 Walk back around to the gate. It will open, and you can get your car and drive 

 back in. Then, find the jet. It is called the Shamal and is located at the end 

 of the runway. Take off and get some practice flying, diving, climbing, rolling, 

 etc. Next, choose a location on your map that you want to go. You can use the 

 map screen to pin that location on the radar. For example, choose the Binco 

 store in Las Venturas. It is next to the Las Venturas airport and the highway. 

 Once you pass the city line, you will get four stars on your wanted meter. 

 Because you are in the air, they will try to shoot you down with missiles. 

 Notice the two red blips on your radar that are fast approaching. Dive, climb, 

 and roll and the missiles will miss. Do not forget to keep your eye on your 

 target. Once you are over your target and are very high, exit the plane. You 

 will drop straight down. You must be high enough for your parachute to open 

 or you die when you hit the ground. When you are safely on the ground, start 

 running. If you chose to go to Binco or another store, notice that you can go 

 inside and buy clothes. If you buy clothes, you will get rid of the four stars 

 wanted level, as long as you remain in the store. Once you step outside, the 

 four stars will return to your wanted meter. 

 

 

 Reach other cities early in Los Santos: 

 ————————————— 

 Use the following trick to get to the other cities before their freeway 

 entrances are actually open. Go to any bridge that connects the start of 

 city of Los Santos to any of the closed cities. Jump into the water that is 

 under that bridge and swim across. When you get far enough, you will have a 

 four star wanted rating. Once you get on land, get a vehicle as soon as 

 possible. Note: You cannot use bribe icons or the Pay N’Spray to decrease 

 this wanted rating. 

 

 

 Fly plane without pilot license: 

 ——————————– 

 Go to either Los Santos or Las Vatos airport. Go to the place that you 

 would enter if you had a pilot license. If you try to get in the gate, 

 it will say you cannot unless you have the license. Next to the gate is 

 a small building. You will need a small car or any type of bike (BMX, 

 bike, motorcycles, etc.). Stand on top of it and jump on top of the 

 building. Jump off and you should see a fence (at Los Santos Airport). 

 Climb the fence and you will see a Dodo plane. Also, if you follow the 

 runway east, you will see a small jet that is unlocked. At Las Vatos, 

 follow the same procedure. After you jump off of the building, just walk 

 around and look for a plane. Note: All but one of the aircraft at San 

 Fereno’s airport are locked. 

 

 After using the“Fly plane without pilot license”trick at the Los 

 Santos airport, go forward you should see a Dodo airplane. Get in and 

 take a right when inside the plane. Go straight, then take a right at 

 the runway. Go down it until you see a jet on the right. It is not on 

 the runway. You can get out of the Dodo and get in the jet. You can now 

 fly the jet wherever desired. However, be careful—if you go out of 

 your territory you will get four stars and jets will shoot missiles at 

 you. Try to dodge them if possible. 

 

 Go to the Los Santos airport and get to the place that you would enter 

 if you had a pilot license. If you try to get in the gate, it will say 

 you cannot unless you have the license. Next to the gate is a small 

 building. You will need a small car or any type of bike (BMX, bike, 

 motorcycles, etc.). Stand on top of it and jump on top of the building. 

 After you jump off of the building, just walk around and look for a plane. 

 

 To get into the Los Santos airport without a pilots license go all the 

 way south until you reach a tunnel. On the south side of the tunnel, 

 look along the fence line of the airport. Notice how the sidewalk has 

 an incline. Walk up the incline and climb up the ledge where the bottom 

 of the fence starts. Turn towards the ramp sign and jump across. You 

 should grab onto the sign. Then, climb up on top of it, turn towards the 

 fence, and jump. You should jump across and grab the fence. CJ will pull 

 himself up and over, and you will be in the airport. 

 

 To access Los Santos International airport early, get a large van and 

 hop over the fence where the guard tells you that you need a pilots 

 license. You can also get any car and hop over the fence around the 

 corner from the guard. Once inside, you will have to hop another fence, 

 then you will find a Dodo. If you go a little further inside near the 

 runway, you will find a jet. 

 

 Go to either the Los Santos airport and get to the place that you would 

 enter if you had a pilot license. If you try to get in the gate, it will 

 say you cannot unless you have the license. Next to the gate is a small 

 building. You will need a small car or any type of bike (BMX, bike, 

 motorcycles, etc.). Stand on top of it and jump on top of the building. 

 After you jump off of the building, just walk around and look for a plane. 

 

 Walk up to the airport gate in San Fierro, touching it. Then, walk along 

 the side of the gate into the corner were the fence bends (keeping in 

 contact with the gate) and walk back into the middle of the gate. It will 

 slide open. You must start in the middle and walk to whichever side the 

 gate will slide open to. For example, if the gates on the left, walk to 

 the left. If it does not work at first, keep trying. 

 

 

 Parachute in Los Santos: 

 ———————— 

 In the Downtown area (near the three way highway section and the red 

 line where the train is passing on your map), you will see a tall 

 circular building with blue/white glass windows. The entrance (with the 

 yellow triangle) is just in the front of it. Enter it, and you will go 

 to the roof of the building where you can find a parachute. Take it, 

 jump down from the roof, and open the parachute. Use Left to control it. 

 Note: You must wait a short time until the parachute respawns back on 

 the roof. 

 

 

 Parachute in San Fierro: 

 ———————— 

 Go to the Downtown area. Find the very big building. Out front, there a 

 sign that reads“No base jumping”. Go to the yellow triangle and you will 

 go to the top. You will automatically get a parachute. This jump lets you 

 fall a long way before opening the parachute. Note: You can only jump once, 

 unless you die. 

 

 After you unlock Mt. Chiliad in the Whetstone area, take a Sanchez to the 

 top of the mountain. Once at the very top, look for a mobile home, and a 

 van. Behind them is a parachute. Pick it up, then look for the ramp by 

 the flag. Driver very fast and jump off. After a few seconds in the air, 

 jump off the bike, then deploy your parachute, or you can wait to do some 

 free falling. You can also jump off of some high buildings, and out of 

 airplanes. 

 

 There is another parachute on the top of the mountain (by the two vehicles). 

 You can fly the Dodo up there, take off, and jump out of the plane whenever 

 you desire. Then, open the parachute. By the time you get back to the 

 mountain, another parachute will have respawned. Note: Sometimes when you 

 jump out of the plane, it will not explode, even from that altitude. 

 

 Unless you have a license, do the“Fly plane without pilot license”trick 

 to get a plane or helicopter early. Fly to the top of Mt. Chiliad. On the 

 east side where campers are parked, there will be rocks. There should be 

 a parachute on those rocks. 

 

 If you ride to the top of Mt. Chiliad, you will find yet another parachute 

 location as well as a Bmx bike race marathon as well as a speed ramp which 

 you can use to fly of the mountain if desired. 

 

 Use the Jetpack to reach the very top of the northernmost tower of the 

 bridge leading from San Fierro to Tierra Robada to find a parachute to 

 skydive with. 

 

 

 Skydiving: 

 ———- 

 Go to any airport. Look for a yellow arrow at the entrances of the airport 

 where you can buy a ticket to another city. Buy the ticket and start the 

 flight. Do not skip the flight. Wait for the airplane to take off and get 

 high in the air. Jump out of the airplane with a parachute and begin 

 skydiving. Open the parachute when you want and float down. There are also 

 other places you can skydive, such as the tall building in the Downtown 

 area of Los Santos, and off the top of Mt. Chiliad. Additionally, to get 

 a parachute very easily, get into any type of flying vehicle, except the 

 Jetpack. You will instantly receive a parachute. If you fly high into the 

 air, then jump out of your plane or helicopter, the parachute will 

 automatically be switched into your weapon inventory. 

 

 

 Skydive longer: 

 ————— 

 Enable the“Cars fly away”code. Go to any airport and hit any aircraft. 

 Then, enter that craft. All you have to do is steer. Soon the height meter 

 will just stay up. You will get to fly higher than normal when you do this. 

 Fly as high as you desired, then Jump out for a long trip back to earth.

 ———————————– 

 After recruiting Zero, stop at his shop and complete all his missions. 

 You will be awarded with a $ spot where you can periodically claim free 

 money. Note: You can also make more money at Zero’s place by doing an 

 extra mission (after you have already completed all the missions to get 

 the shop as an asset). Go to the back room in the shop and step into the 

 red marker to trigger a mission where you use the RC Baron to destroy 

 Berkely’s shipping vans. For each van you destroy, you will get money. 

 There is a time limit for each time you play the mission. You can replay 

 this mission as many times as desired. 

 

 

 Bomb valet parking in San Fierro: 

 ——————————— 

 Go to the valet parking hotel without your uniform and stand next to 

 the valets. When a vehicle drives up, enable the“Weapons (tier 3)” 

 code and plant a bomb on the car that is about to be parked . When 

 the valet enters the vehicle, do not use the remote. Do it as soon as 

 he reaches the parking garage. The car and the valet are toast. 

 

 

 Stealing from valet parking in San Fierro: 

 —————————————— 

 Go to the valet parking hotel without your uniform. Stand next to the 

 valets. When a car drives up, quickly get in and drive off slowly. 

 The valet will begin to chase you . If he is very close to the car, 

 get out, and let him get in . As soon as he does that, quickly pull 

 him out and he will say“I am parking a car here”. As soon as he says 

 that, get back into the car and drive off. The valet will not chase 

 you anymore. 

 

 

 Military vehicles in San Fierro: 

 ——————————– 

 Near the port in San Fierro there will be a naval base. If you quickly 

 enter the compound and drive around, you will eventually find a 

 military truck and Patriot vehicle. Note: Once you enter the compound 

 of the naval base, you will get a five star wanted level. 

 

 

 Baseball bat in San Fierro: 

 ————————— 

 You can find a baseball bat at the baseball diamond in San Fierro 

 at home plate, across the street from Zero’s RC Shop. 

 

 

 Chain gun in San Fierro: 

 ———————— 

 There is a chain gun on Point Kinclad (big red train tracks in San 

 Fierro). Take a helicopter or the Jetpack and fly onto the first arch 

 leaving San Fierro to go to Las Venturas to find it. 

 

 

 Flamethrower and pool stick in San Fierro: 

 —————————————— 

 In the Doherty area, go behind your garage to find a construction area 

 (marked brown on the map). Go to the building just left of the road on 

 the brown area. Under a broken ramp is a flamethrower and pool stick. 

 

 

 Guided rocket launcher in San Fierro: 

 ————————————- 

 Go to the airport and from where the two helicopters spawn, go to 

 the left. There will be two little buildings near the water. To the 

 right of one of them will be propane tanks. In between two of them 

 will be a lock on rocket launcher. 

 

 

 Shooting gallery in San Fierro: 

 ——————————- 

 Go to your gas station safe house. Find the trolley tracks (not the 

 train tracks) in the middle of the road in front of the safe house. 

 Enable the“Spawn Jetpack”code and wait for the trolley to pass by. 

 Once it does, fly into the air and land on top of it. Then, take off 

 your Jetpack. Enable any“Weapons”code and start killing pedestrians. 

 Once the cops start chasing you, you will notice that when they try 

 to ram you, the trolley will not get damaged, and is actually invincible. 

 You will be able to drive through the town and use it like a giant 

 shooting gallery. There is no need to worry if the military starts 

 chasing you. The trolley car can ram right through the tanks, sometimes 

 flipping them over. If your health gets low (you can still be shot by 

 pedestrian cops), enable the“Health, armor, and money”code. This 

 trick allows you to live a surprisingly long time while being hunted 

 down by the feds. To enhance your experience, you can also enable the 

 “Pedestrians riot”,“Pedestrians with guns”,“Aggressive traffic”and 

 “Lower wanted level”codes, then relax and watch the havoc unfold 

 around you all from the safety and comfort of a big red trolley car. 

 

 

 Fling Bulldozer around in San Fierro: 

 ————————————- 

 Go to the construction yard near San Fierro. Go past the crane and 

 turn left after the first hangar. Behind that, you will see a towtruck, 

 Get in and drive towards the Bulldozer. Hook up the Bull Dozer. Drive 

 up the hill to where there is an open area. Then, turn very sharp to 

 either the left or the right. The Bulldozer will fling around, pulling 

 the tow truck with it. For even more fun, get three or more tow trucks 

 and hook them all up into a line. With three or more, the Bulldozer 

 acts like a ball and chain flailing around. 

 

 

 Fall off building and live in San Fierro: 

 —————————————– 

 Go to the Big Pointy Building (the one with a parachute) in the 

 Downtown area and jump off. Open your parachute and land. Go back 

 up to the top. This time, you will not get a parachute. Jump off. 

 Before you hit the ground, you will hit the side of the building 

 and slide down. When you are close to the ground, you should hit 

 one of the many slanted poles that hold up the building. This will 

 slow you down enough so that you only lose about one sixth of your 

 health. Note: Sometimes you will not hit a slanted pole and lose 

 more health or die. 

 

 

 Gant Bridge message in San Fierro: 

 ———————————- 

 Note: This works best if you unlocked the Jet Pack or an expert at 

 landing helicopters. Go to the Gant Bridge and fly up to the very 

 top. Go the very top cable line piece that is horizontal, is south 

 on the Gant Bridge, and is the closest to San Fierro. Fly up to the 

 very top and look at the cable that is vertical to see a sign that 

 reads“There are no Easter Eggs up here. Go Away”. 

 

 

 Easy money in Las Venturas: 

 ————————— 

 Go to the strip club. Stand in front of one of the dancers and wait 

 until somebody throws money at them. CJ will automatically pick it 

 up and say a comment as in“How thoughtful”. Leave the game like this 

 for about an hour or two and your money should have increased 

 significantly by the time you return. 

 

 

 Burger Shot asset in Las Venturas: 

 ———————————- 

 Some of the Burger Shots have a timed delivery mission where you must 

 send packages on a Faggio. Complete them to gain that restaurant as 

 an asset. 

 

 

 Secret government agency base in Las Venturas: 

 ———————————————- 

 Get in any land or air vehicle and drive or fly to the abandoned 

 air field in the region of Las Venturas. To the south from here, 

 there is a little area that is a“no fly zone”. If flown over, a 

 mysterious five star wanted level will appear. This is because the 

 area is a government agency secret base that holds several heavy and 

 speedy army vehicles. You can also find this area in the middle part 

 of the region of Las Venturas on the map included with the game. 

 

 

 Tear gas in Las Venturas: 

 ————————- 

 Go to the AT 400′s hanger at the airport. There is a building with 

 cars nearby. You will see a can which looks like spray paint. When 

 you use it, C.J. does not choke. It is not very strong, but will choke 

 pedestrians. 

 

 

 Sex shop in mirror in Las Venturas: 

 ———————————– 

 In the tattoo parlor, kill the owner and pull out a camera. Zoom 

 in fully into the mirror. You will be able to see the sex shop across 

 the street. 

 

 

 Suicidal pedestrians in Las Venturas: 

 ————————————- 

 Find the gym in the Redsands East area. It is parallel to a bomb shop 

 called“Weddings&amp;Weldings”. There is an alley next to the shop. 

 Go into it and stand on the eastern wall of the bomb shop. Look in 

 the northeastern direction to see a tall white building. If you stand 

 in the correct location, you can see pedestrians spawning on the lower 

 roof and falling off. You can run up to a pedestrian after they have 

 fallen, but you cannot stand underneath the roof and wait for them to 

 fall on you; they only spawn from a certain distance. 

 

 

 Hunter Quarry asset in Bone County: 

 ———————————– 

 Successfully complete all seven quarry missions to get it as an asset, 

 where you can collect money. 

 

 

 Extra car storage space in Bone County: 

 ————————————— 

 Once you have purchased the abandoned airfield in the Verdtant Meadows 

 area, locate the massive garage directly opposite the house that is 

 there. It may not look like a garage as it is a hanger for airplanes, 

 but it is a perfect location to store a large number of cars. 

 

 

 Volcano effect in Bone County: 

 —————————— 

 Find the geyser in Bone County. Shoot a rocket at it and it will 

 turn into a volcano. 

 

 

 Area 69 in Bone County: 

 ———————– 

 Get in any land or air vehicle and drive or fly to the abandoned air 

 field in the region of Las Venturas. To the south from here, there 

 is a little area that is a“no fly zone”. If flown over, a mysterious 

 five star wanted level will appear. This is because the area is a 

 government agency secret base that holds several heavy and speedy 

 army vehicles. You can also find this area in the middle part of the 

 region of Las Venturas on the map included with the game. 

 

 Use the following trick to enter Area 69 without the law on you. 

 Find Barbara (a girl you can date) in a town north of San Fierro and 

 Tierra Robada. Start dating her. After you get your dating percent 

 up to 100%, you will receive a police uniform. Go to a safe house 

 and put it on. Get in a police car or Ranger police SUV (recommended). 

 You can now drive into the base and get several things, such as 

 different types of guns. You can also get a chopper called the 

 Cargobob. You can also get Patriots, Rhinos, and Hydra fighter jets. 

 

 

 Go underground in Area 69 in Bone County: 

 —————————————– 

 Do the underworld glitch (at the Vinewood safehouse head north from 

 Madd Dogg’s) and fly to Area 69. Find the underground complex. Find 

 the area where you get the Black Project, and you should see an empty 

 long hollow room next to it. It should have red boxes at the top of 

 the“silo”. Fly underneath the empty silo then fly to the top of the 

 silo. You should see a“cage”where the room is of the red boxes. 

 Try to take off your Jetpack. When you do, you should land in the 

 Black Project area or the rooms around there. Note: To do the underworld 

 glitch, find the safe house pool. Fly the Jetpack into the corner of 

 the safe house. Then, fly to Area 69. Also, bring weapons and armor 

 because the SAPD officers spawn down there. 

 

 

 Huge air in Bone County: 

 ———————— 

 Go to the Arco De Oste area with a fast car. Go up the mountain until 

 you see either a mine shaft or a wooden track. Follow the track back 

 to the mine shaft then turn around and follow the wood track until 

 you go off a jump. If done correctly, you should be able to clear 

 the Sherman Reservoir. 

 

 

 Machine Gun in Red County: 

 ————————– 

 Go to the town of Blueberry. Behind a wall is a machine gun. 

 

 

 Easy money in Whetstone: 

 ———————— 

 Go to the top of Mt. Chiliad and go behind the RVs. Pick up the 

 parachute and get on the mountain bike, which will start a challenge. 

 Go off the ramp to the right and get off of your bike in mid-air. 

 Pull the parachute and you will not hit the ground, but instead be 

 put back on the bike with the chute still open. You can keep going 

 off the ramp repeatedly to get as much money as desired. 

 

 Go to the top of Mt. Chiliad. There should be cars, a bike, and a 

 parachute. Get on the mountain bike and it will start a mission. 

 Instead of doing the mission, go forward and you should see a flag 

 with a ramp next to it. Get on the bike, go very fast, and jump off 

 the ramp. Once you are going down, the screen should blur. Do not 

 jump off the bike; just keep going and you should respawn back on 

 the mountain. You will get an insane jump bonus for about $300. 

 Repeat this to get as much money as desired. 

 

 

 Climb Mt. Chiliad faster in Whetstone: 

 ————————————– 

 Get a BMX bike and go to Mt. Chiliad. Ride up the mountain (not on the road). 

 Tap as hard as you can with the BMX bike, and you will be able to climb 

 the mountain faster. 

 

 

 Never fall off your bike in Whetstone: 

 ————————————– 

 Go to the top of Mt. Chiliad. Get the parachute and get on the mountain 

 bike at the correct time for the bicycle race challenge. Make sure that 

 the parachute is your current weapon before the race starts. When the 

 race begins, do not go through the checkpoints. There will be a ramp on 

 the left side with a flag beside it. Cycle there and jump off the mountain 

 with your bike as soon a s the race starts. When CJ is in the air with the 

 mountain bike, jump off the bike. Then while in the air, open your parachute. 

 You must do this quickly before CJ is put to the race track again. 

 However, once you open the parachute in the air, CJ will be put on the 

 race track again, with him riding a bike. However, this time you will 

 have a parachute opened while riding your BMX, and CJ will not be holding 

 the bike’s handlebars. He will instead be holding the parachute. You can 

 now go downhill at any angle and at any speed without falling off the bike. 

 Note: You must end the race to take your bike elsewhere. If you try to jump 

 off the cliff again while you have the parachute, you will appear on the 

 track without any parachute. Once you finish the race with your parachute 

 on you, you can go anywhere with it. You can enable the“Massive bunny 

 hops”code and jump as high as desired and land at any angle without falling. 

 Note: Make sure you do this before you get on the bike. Getting off your 

 bike will release the parachute; if you try to do any awkward stunts you 

 might fall. You will not fall unless you release the parachute. Get 

 off the bike to release the parachute. 

 

 

 Infinite nitrous: 

 —————– 

 Activate the nitrous in a car and put it inside your garage. While the 

 nitrous is still activated, shoot the car until it explodes, then allow 

 the garage door to close. When the door opens again, the nitrous will 

 always remain activated in that car. 

 

 

 Quick nitrous refill: 

 ——————— 

 Leave your car, then immediately re-enter it. Your nitrous will be back 

 at full. 

 

 

 Better handling motorcycle: 

 ————————— 

 To get better handling on street bikes, get on one and enable the“Spawn 

 Jetpack”code. You will be able to make turns at full speed without crashing. 

 Note: The Jetpack will disappear when you get off the bike. 

 

 

 Exceed garage limit: 

 ——————– 

 When you want to park a car in a garage but the game states that you cannot 

 store another vehicle, you drive the car near the garage and get out. Then, 

 hop in the car and drive in. 

 

 

 Finding your car after getting busted: 

 ————————————– 

 If you been arrested, go down to the police parking lot. Walk around without 

 a weapon. Eventually, you will find your car. 

 

 

 Stealing locked cars: 

 ——————— 

 Some cars have locked doors so you cannot steal them (such as cop cars and 

 your first girlfriend’s Hustler). However, getting them into a garage will 

 unlock the doors. You can either push a car into the garage or get a Tow 

 Truck or a Tractor to tow them. Additionally, to get in a locked vehicle 

 with someone inside (for example, a Combine Harvester), shoot the person 

 in the head and the door will fling open, allowing you drive it away. 

 

 Find a Tow Truck (for example, at the dump in Mt. Chiliad) and drive to 

 where the locked car is located. Hook the locked car onto the Tow Truck 

 and tow it into your garage. Let the garage close. When you open the 

 garage again, the locked car should be unlocked. This is easier then 

 pushing it into your garage. 

 

 If you try to open a car and it is locked, go far from it, then return. 

 The color of the car should be different and the doors should be unlocked. 

 

 If someone has locked their car doors, and you shoot them out, be careful 

 not to get out before you reach your garage. Otherwise, the doors will 

 stay locked. 

 

 

 Keep aircraft from races: 

 ————————- 

 Enter the races at the Las Venturas Airport. Select the race with the 

 airplane you desire, then ignore the race and instead take it back to your 

 airstrip and park it in your own big hangar. You will fail the mission, but 

 can re-do it. Once you get back to your airstrip and look in your hanger, 

 your airplane will be there. Save the game to keep it. 

 

 

 Recommended hydraulic cars: 

 ————————— 

 The Landstalker and Tahoma are by far one of the highest bouncing vehicles 

 on the game (with lots of practice). If you cannot find one of tem on the 

 streets with hydraulics, take one to the Loco shop. 

 

 

 AT-400: 

 ——- 

 Find the large single hanger at the end of the main runway at the Las 

 Venturas airport. Approach it and it will open. The AT-400 jumbo jet 

 will be inside at certain times. It can climb to the highest altitude 

 possible in the game. 

 

 Go to the northeastern part of the Las Venturas airport, where a huge 

 hanger with a green door is located. When you walk up to it, the door 

 will open downward to reveal an AT-400 airliner. When you see it, there 

 will be a platform to the left of the plane that you can go on. When you 

 get onto the platform, go to the plane and enter it and fly around. 

 

 

 Bandito: 

 ——– 

 Go to the small sandy beach in San Fierro. When on the beach, you should 

 see a small pier or dock. Go on the left side of the pier look around the 

 corner to find a Bandito. Additionally, the Bandito spawns on the very west 

 side of the map, at the Ocean Flats area of San Fierro. Go to where there 

 is a pier. On the left side of the pier will be a Bandito. This is a 

 buggy-type vehicle that is very good off-road. You can also find a Bandito 

 at Ocean Flats area of San Fierro, close to Palisades. 

 

 Collect 15 vehicles for the Import/Export dock to get the Bandito. 

 

 Banshee: 

 Go to Las Ventura and look on The Strip to find the Banshee. Additionally, 

 a Banshee can always be found parked by the Gym in the Garcia area of San 

 Fierro. Face the gym’s door, then turn right. 

 

 Beagle: 

 This airplane can be found at the airports at San Fierro and Las Venturas. 

 

 BF Injection: 

 Finish in first place at the Dirt Ring race at the stadium in Las 

 Venturas to get the BF Injection. Additionally, you can find a BF 

 Injection at the opposite end of the same beach where you can also 

 find the Bandito in San Fierro. 

 

 Bloodring Banger: 

 Get your total time up to one minute in the Bloodring. 

 

 Big jump with Bicycle: 

 While on a bike, pedal at full speed at an oncoming car. Bunny 

 hop onto the hood and you will launch yourself in the air. 

 

 Create ball and chain with Bulldozer: 

 Go to the construction yard near San Fierro. Go past the crane 

 and turn left after the first hangar. Behind that, you will see 

 a towtruck, Get in and drive towards the Bulldozer. Hook up the 

 Bull Dozer. Drive up the hill to where there is an open area. 

 Then, turn very sharp to either the left or the right. The Bulldozer 

 will fling around, pulling the tow truck with it. For even more 

 fun, get three or more tow trucks and hook them all up into a line. 

 With three or more, the Bulldozer acts like a ball and chain flailing 

 around. 

 

 Bullet: 

 Successfully complete driving school with at least all silver awards 

 to unlock the Bullet. Alternately, look for the burger shop in the 

 Juniper Hollow area in the north part of San Fierro, west of the 

 church. The Bullet is located in the parking lot right across 

 from the entrance. 

 

 Successfully complete the Import/Export missions (30 vehicles). 

 The Bullet will be available for import after you have delivered 

 all cars to the Green Basin Harbor. 

 

 A Bullet can always be found parked by the D. Flour Bakery in 

 the Doherty area of San Fierro. 

 

 From the hideout in Doherty (abandoned gas station below the 

 construction site), take a right turn onto the street. Take the 

 first left turn (it slopes down a hill). Wind down the hill and 

 take the first right turn. A Bullet is behind the stone wall. 

 The entrance is at the base of the hill on the left. An alternate 

 way is to wind down the hill and take the second right turn. Get 

 out of the car. Go through the archway on your right and go up the 

 stairs. The Bullet will be directly in front of you, as well as a 

 police bribe. 

 

 

 Keep Taxi light on: 

 ——————- 

 Use the following trick to keep the“Taxi”light on and not have 

 to pick up passengers. Steal a taxi and start the missions. Then, 

 immediately end the missions. The light will stay on. For a better 

 effect, try this at night. 

 

 

 Cargobob Helicopter: 

 ——————– 

 Go to the restricted area in Bone County. Inside you will find 

 a Cargobob helicopter, Rhino tanks and a Patriot. If you go to 

 the center of base you will find a steel vent on the ground. 

 Destroy it, and you can go inside and turn off the SAM sites 

 surrounding the base. You should now be able to fly out in the 

 chopper. Alternately, go to KACC Military Fuels at the top of 

 Las Venturas. Note: You need a Patriot to do this trick. If you 

 have done the mission for the Heist strand called Up, Up, and 

 Away, this is the location of KACC Military Fuels. Once there, 

 take your Patriot and drive through the front gates. No one is 

 there, and you will not get shot. Note: If it does not let you 

 through, take a ramp truck and put it near the gate. Then, run 

 up it and jump the fence. Once you are inside, get out of your 

 vehicle, go to your left, and go inside the hangar (round building) 

 and walk through to the other end. You will end up back outside.

 From 60% to 100% sometimes you will have difficult dates (when you dance). 

 Make sure you have already saved the game. If you are not skilled with the 

 dancing, reload the game until you go on the date where all you do is drive. 

 You should get at least 10% for going on the date, because the game gives 

 you an extra 5% for her inviting you in for coffee.

 Gifts in Dating missions: 

 ————————- 

 The purple dildo found in the police station can also be used as a gift for a 

 girlfriend. It takes the place of the flowers. Flowers can be found at almost 

 any gas station. They are always accepted from girlfriends, unlike the dildo 

 which sometimes may be rejected.

 The girls you date have different tastes in you. They will comment on your looks. 

 For example, one girl likes you to be about 50% fat. 

 

 

 Jealousy in Dating missions: 

 —————————-

 8-Track mission: 

 —————- 

 Enable the“Slow motion”code and you will be able to easily take first place. 

 This is helpful if you are trying to get the Monster Truck. 

 

 

 Air Raid mission: 

 —————– 

 Enable the“Slow motion”code to get a better shot at the RC planes. Enable the 

 “Destroy all cars”code repeatedly to pass the mission. 

 

 

 Are You Going To San Fierro? mission:

 Instead of burning the weed with the flamethrower, use the rocket launcher and 

 shoot the crops; it will destroy them much easier. 

 

 

 Badlands mission: 

 —————– 

 Get to the mountain top and blow up the snitch’s car. He will jump off the side 

 of the mountain, committing suicide. Enable the“Spawn Jetpack”code and go down 

 there. Take a picture of him. Take the picture back to the drop point. By doing 

 this, you will not have to chase him back down the mountain on the dirtbike. 

 Additionally, enable the“Spawn Jetpack”code. Fly up the mountain, near the top 

 of the cabin. Do not let the guards see you. Choose the silenced pistol. Enter 

 through the back of the cabin and shoot the snitch. Be prepared to fight it out 

 with the FBI if you get caught. You can now snap a photo of the dead snitch 

 without chasing him. It is important to watch the guards’movement before 

 attempting this. 

 

 

 Beat The Cock mission: 

 ———————- 

 This is a triathlon. Go to Santa Maria beach in Los Santos and wait until 

 the weekend. Then, go to the lighthouse. You will see a little red marker 

 which will start the mission. Note: You must be in very good shape to win. 

 The reward is $10,000. Also, next to Palomino Creek is a beach that is part 

 of Fisher’s Lagoon. The one attached to that is part of Palomino Creek 

 (if you are looking on a map it is the second largest of them all, and 

 has a dock). Go to it. On there will be a red circle. Enter it to start 

 the mission. You should have full muscle and stamina because it is a 

 swimming race. If you have good stats, you will complete the mission. 

 

 

 Black Project mission: 

 ———————- 

 This mission starts after a number of Torino missions. Truth is upset 

 with you working with Torino. He abandons you on a road. You are getting 

 into Area 69 and must bring back the Black Project. You must go to the 

 control tower and open the blast doors. You have to avoid the searchlights, 

 but not shoot out more than two of them. You have thermal goggles to see 

 the guards. You must get in before 5:30 a.m. You will begin near body armor 

 if you do not have any. There are guards at mid-level on all of the light 

 towers, plus many that are walking around. Try sniping everybody so that 

 you are not spotted. If you do get spotted, you are told to use a vent to 

 get into the building. In any case, there is armor up on the control tower 

 to replenish with, and a red spot to use to open up the blast doors. 

 The blast doors are in the center of the mound. The vent is marked nearby 

 and you can shoot your way in through the grates. There is a health waiting 

 for you inside that room (with the blast doors on the other wall). 

 Go through the hallway and shoot the guards at the other end. There is 

 armor up and to the right in here. There is also a minigun there. This 

 area has bulletproof glass, so you are safe. Go downstairs to the little 

 opening (not the red path to the left). Shoot out more guards in here. 

 At the end of the path is armor. Then, take a right and another right and 

 you can see a radar room. Disable the SAM site. Then, go downstairs and 

 over to the yellow striped area. There is a grate below you. Go to the 

 end where the grate is up and go in for the health and armor that is down 

 there. Move along, as there are more enemies to kill. Then move left– 

 they say that there is a keycard. Get the armor then touch the scientist 

 to get his keycard. Follow him down the path to the left and you will be 

 in a giant cylinder building. Work your way down all of the stairs, 

 shooting as you go. Get the Jetpack and fly out, heading for the triangle. 

 You can fire a weapon while flying, but you really do not have to. Truth 

 takes it from you, takes off, and abandons you there. 

 

 

 Body Harvest mission: 

 ——————— 

 Take a bike to the farm and ride to the back of the farm using an indirect 

 route, bypassing the survivalists in the fields and tractors. Quickly steal 

 the harvester, then run over the survivalists that are on foot between you 

 and the road back. Try to overturn the pickups that are in your way. If 

 they are still following you on the road, do a drive by when one is next 

 to you to kill the gunman on the truck bed. The Harvester can take quite 

 a bit of damage. Hit the pickup until it catches on fire, then get away. 

 

 

 Burglary missions: 

 —————— 

 In the Ganton area of Los Santos, go towards the gym that is just a block 

 south of the Binco store and the bar. Across the street from the gym and 

 to the south, you should see a van parked next to a house. It is a boxcar. 

 After 20:00, jump in and you can go on burglary missions until sunrise. 

 

 Go to CJ’s garage in San Fierro. Look behind it, and there should be a 

 construction site. Behind the structures of broken down buildings in 

 front of you, there should be an abandoned building with a lop-sided 

 sign that reads“Harry Plumbs”just north of the“Turning Tricks Advanced 

 Driving School”. Look to the right of that building to find an alleyway. 

 Walk into the alleyway and look to the right. There should be a black van 

 parked there. Get in sometime before 20:00 and find a nice house you 

 think will make a nice profit. Wait until 20:00, then start the burglary 

 missions; you can do the missions until 06:00. Note: When dropping off 

 the cargo, you will return to the garage next to the alleyway that you 

 found the van at. 

 

 Steal any burglary van you know of, and travel to any city of your choice. 

 Proceed as usual, and after you have steak the goods, a yellow blip will 

 appear on your map. Pause game play and look at the map. You will see that 

 the blip has jumped from the city you stole the van in, to the city you 

 are currently at. For example, if you steal the van in Los Santos and go 

 to Las Venturas and trigger the burglary missions, the yellow blip will 

 appear in las Venturas, close behind“The Camel’s Toe”Casino. 

 

 To commit burglaries in San Fierro, go to the Doherty area. Go to the 

 building that has a big sign board, reading“Hairy Plumbs”. It is opposite 

 the driving school. Go around the back of the building to find the van. 

 

 

 Infinite time in Burglary missions: 

 ———————————– 

 Enable the“Always 21:00″code, then find the van. Additionally, enable the 

 “Always 21:00″and“Wanted level never increases”codes. Find a Boxville and 

 initiate a burglary mission. You should now have as much time as desired to 

 do the mission, and the cops will never chase you if you wake up the people 

 in the houses. 

 

 

 Catalyst mission: 

 —————– 

 When you reach the train, do not bother getting out of your car. Drive 

 around the pinned down Groves and run into the Vagos. Drive into the train 

 tunnel to turn around if needed. After all the ones on the ground are killed, 

 exit the car and shoot the one on the train. Then, get back into your car 

 and run over the arriving Ballas. If your car begins smoking, park it next to 

 the Ballas car to create an explosion that should kill them all. Then, get on 

 the train as instructed. Quickly toss the ammo crates to Ryder. There is an 

 unlimited number of them onboard so you do not have to waste time getting a 

 perfect target. You may want to change the“Invert Look Controls”setting 

 to make this less confusing. Remember to change the setting back after all 

 the crates are tossed. 

 

 

 Cleaning The Hood mission: 

 ————————– 

 Do not bother using fighting moves on the crack dealer outside. A single 

 shot from your pistol will bring him down. Once inside the crack den, use 

 the pistol again to take down the targets quickly. Note: Shoot the man with 

 the bat first. 

 

 

 Cop Wheels mission: 

 ——————- 

 Any police motorcycles will not work. You must steal the ones that the game 

 marks for you. 

 

 

 Da Nang Thang mission: 

 ———————- 

 When the helicopter gets shot down and you are in the water, do not swim to 

 the ship. Instead, swim to shore, steal a car, and drive to Ammu-Nation to 

 buy weapons and armor. Then, go to the ship. The mission is a lot easier 

 with an AK-47 in your inventory. 

 

 

 Drive-By mission: 

 —————– 

 After approaching each group of targets, just continue to drive around the 

 block normally. There is no reason to damage your car trying to reverse or 

 spin back around. The targets do not run far. Simply drive normally around 

 the block until your partners can start shooting them again. With the last 

 group of Balla’s, drive your car down the path and through the tunnel to 

 run them over. Turn around and repeat until they are all dead. Note: Since 

 this mission is not timed, you can drive carefully to a Pay N’Spray between 

 drive-bys to get your car’s health bar restored. You will eventually have 

 to go to the Pay N’Spray anyway at the end of the mission to lower your 

 wanted level. Note: That visit will be complimentary, but any others will 

 be charged. 

 

 

 Drive Thru mission: 

 ——————- 

 Try to get in front of the Ballas car and trap it into a wall or building. 

 Your partners will shoot it until it catches on fire. Get your car away 

 from it before it explodes. Additionally, after getting the background of 

 the mission, drive back to Grove Street and get the bazooka. Aim at the exit 

 for Grove street. When the Ballas car is coming, shoot at it to quickly 

 finish the mission. 

 

 

 Explosive Situation mission: 

 —————————- 

 Go into the quarry and shoot the two workers that are featured the opening 

 sequence at the detonation controls. This will stop the countdown and you 

 can take your time getting the dynamite. Run over the dynamite crates with 

 the giant dump truck to beak them open and get the explosives. 

 

 

 Farewell My Love mission: 

 ————————- 

 As the race begins, instead of going forward, turn around and go straight. 

 You will be jumping off a cliff, but if you can land your car successfully 

 you will be on your way. Keep driving straight into the town. Take a right 

 turn at the first right you see. If you have already done the race you 

 should know where to go. Follow the road and take another right. You will 

 then be driving across a small bridge. Turn left on the small dirt road 

 and park your car at the end of the bridge. Since you are allowed only 25 

 seconds out of your car, you must do this quickly. Once out of your car, 

 run to the middle of the bridge. Enable the“Spawn Rhino”code, which 

 should block the bridge. Do this as many times as desired, but be aware 

 that the other cars will show up sometime around three minutes. When the 

 cars appear, make sure to have the rocket launcher out before getting in 

 your car. When the cars show up, they will drive into the creek/river. 

 Quickly get out of your car and fire multiple rockets at them. Do this 

 very quickly. You can then complete the race with no competitors. 

 Additionally, before the race starts, enable the“Flying cars”code. 

 Go to the race. Immediately at the start of the race, all cars will 

 floor it and will fly off the cliff. This gives you as much time as needed 

 to complete the race. Make sure you go drive slow so that you also do not 

 fly off. About six minutes are required to complete the race. 

 

 

 Fender Ketchup mission: 

 ———————– 

 To easily complete this mission, find a large empty area and just keep 

 going fast back and forth doing a lot of 180 degree turns to get the 

 scare-o-meter full. Watch out for cops—once they spot you, you will 

 have more then one star and they will try to hit you head on. Remember 

 to make sure that you do not get in a head on collision, or the man on 

 the hood will die. Additionally, do not drive on the freeway, as this 

 will attract the police. Instead, drive to the airport and perform a 

 few insane jumps. This will have him terrified quickly. Also, the 

 airport is not too far from Woozie’s casino. Pull to the side of Woozie’s 

 casino and drive back and forth doing 180s until the Scare-O-Meter is 

 full. 

 

 

 High Stakes, Low Rider mission: 

 ——————————- 

 Instead of using the first lowrider that was given you by Cesar, drive 

 any vehicle to Cesar’s house. Look across the street from the mission 

 starting circle to find a light colored Voodoo in a driveway. Get in 

 it, and use it to start the mission. This car is considered a low 

 rider, but does not have hydraulics making it less likely that you 

 will accidentally activate them. It also controls better in turns 

 when compared to your original lowrider. Get to the starting position 

 of the race. When the race begins, try to maneuver around the inevitable 

 initial crash of most of the other drivers. Note that the waypoint 

 markers for races now are visible on the horizon, unlike the“bubble” 

 Markers of previous Grand Theft Auto games. Also, imbedded in the 

 waypoint marker is an arrow that will indicate the direction that you 

 need to follow for the next marker. It may be easier to slip into 

 second place and watch the first place cars for cues on where to turn. 

 Otherwise, just pay attention to the directions and take your turns 

 carefully when in first place. By the time you reach the final waypoint 

 markers, slip into first place, or use the final straight away to take 

 the lead. Do not slow down at the end, even though the road stops. 

 Hit the finish line at full speed. Additionally, when you get in the 

 low rider, enable the“Deadly vehicle”code. During the race, tap the 

 rear bumper of each car in front of you. By the end of the race, you 

 will have as much time as needed to finish in first place without any 

 competition. 

 

 Enable the“Flying cars”code before you get to the starting grid. 

 When the race begins, the five other low-riders will start to fly 

 around the area. When you reach the third or fourth checkpoint, you 

 will be in first place throughout the race. Do not accelerate fast, 

 because you will also end up flying. Instead, drive at a very slow 

 pace, but fast enough so that you can finish the race before the game 

 freezes. 

 

 

 Bulletproof Savanna in High Stakes, Low Rider mission: 

 —————————————————— 

 After completing the mission, Cesar and his Savanna will remain at 

 the finish line, but the doors will be locked. Use another vehicle 

 to push the car to your garage. The doors will now be unlocked and 

 the car remains bulletproof. 

 

 

 Home Invasion mission: 

 ———————- 

 Try to get to the target house with as much time remaining. The 

 required three ammunition boxes can be found in the following 

 locations. In the first room that you enter, look to your right 

 near the cannon next to the front window. Go up the stairs and look 

 on the landing. Go all the way up the stairs and go to the end of 

 the hallway. If desired, you can get three more boxes in the house, 

 but they do not seem to give anything extra. 

 

 

 Ice Cold Killa mission: 

 ———————– 

 Take a gun and shoot out the tires of the pimpmobile. Then, shoot 

 the car until the smoke turns black. Next, get a gun that you can 

 do drive bys with. If you do not have one, go behind the building 

 and by a pole for the bridge to find one. When you get into the 

 club through the windows, meet Jizzy and just run out of the club 

 after him. When you are out there, the pimpmobile should be in the 

 same condition that you left it. It is easier to blow up his car. 

 Additionally, before you go into the club, shoot out the tires of 

 his Pimpmobile. Get in the club, chase him out, and he will get 

 into the car even with blown tires. You just run after him, and pull 

 him out of the car. 

 

 Outside the club are two limos along with Jizzy’s car. Before 

 entering the club through the skylight, park one limo in front 

 of his car and the other behind his car, blocking it in. It will 

 remain this way when Jizzy exits the club and tries to escape, 

 making it easy to run up and pull him out of the car before he can 

 drive off. Also,“high center”Jizzy’s car on the grassy median 

 along the boardwalk prior to entering the club. He will not be able 

 to drive off it before you reach the car to pull him out. Additionally, 

 before entering the club, blow up Jizzy’s car rather than just shooting 

 off the tires or decreasing its health. Then when Jizzy tries to escape, 

 he will be forced to do so in a Pizzaboy scooter. Just knock him off 

 his bike and kill him with an M4 or any other gun. 

 

 Instead of trying to get out and get in jizzy’s car, just follow him for 

 awhile. He will get out of the car, and you can shoot him. 

 

 

 Just Business mission: 

 ———————- 

 On the first part, let Sweet do all the shooting. When on the motorcycle 

 unleash your guns on the people on motorcycles going for the person 

 driving. If he dies they both do. You can also try to pop their tires. 

 They will spin out. Do not worry about the big truck you see—it is 

 indestructible. You will see the action play out of you going of the 

 car. You will jump off the big truck from the trailer. 

 

 

 Key To Her Heart mission: 

 ————————- 

 In the Key To Her Heart mission for Woozie in Las Venturas, when you 

 go to the courtier’s house and kill the gimp, you can take his purple 

 dildo to use as a melee weapon. Additionally, when you get Millie as 

 a girlfriend, instead of dating her, kill her. Wait awhile and Woozie 

 will call. CJ will say that Millie is dead. Woozie will tell you to 

 go to her house and take the pass key. 

 

 

 Strange T-Bone behavior in Mike Toreno mission: 

 ———————————————- 

 In the mission, when instructed to get into the car and doing so, 

 you can choose any car desired. Get out and choose a faster vehicle 

 with T-Bone following you. T-Bone’s following actions for entering 

 and exiting vehicles are scripted strangely. For example, if you 

 crash and get thrown off a motorcycle with T-Bone on it with you, 

 he will get up and walk to any nearby vehicle door, and then follow 

 you. 

 

 

 Misappropriation mission: 

 ————————- 

 Instead of chasing the man in the helicopter, enable the“Spawn 

 Jetpack”code. Fly up behind the man. Make sure he does not see 

 you then open fire from the Jetpack. Swoop in, grab the dossier, 

 then make your escape before the FBI kills you. 

 

 

 Mountain Cloud Boys mission: 

 —————————- 

 This mission seems difficult at first, but if you have the correct 

 weapons it can be easy. First, enable the“Weapons (tier 3)”code 

 to get the rocket launcher. Next, enable the“Deadly vehicle”code. 

 When the men come after you, shoot the first two or three with a 

 gun. Get ahead of Woozie and shoot a rocket at the car to blow it 

 up, killing everyone there. As you go further, two motorcycles will 

 pull up. Hit them with the rocket launcher. Be careful; make sure 

 that the bike blows up before getting too close. As you go further 

 into the alley, you can shoot rockets in the directions of enemies 

 with guns and kill them all, but stay ahead of Woozie. When you and 

 Woozie jump in the car (having the“Deadly vehicle”code enabled), 

 just hit the two cars head on, but be careful. Your car can be 

 damaged and explode as a result of too many hits. 

 

 

 Noon mission: 

 ————- 

 You must keep ramming him and do the“PIT”maneuver as taught in 

 driving school. His car will come next to you. When it does, shoot 

 him with a drive by. His car will catch on fire and he will get 

 out. He will shoot at you. You must shoot at him first and he will 

 die. Additionally, before you start, get a RPG or a homing rocket 

 launcher. Then, enable the“Cars fly away”code. When you start 

 the mission, get the dune buggy nearby and ram Eddie’s car. It will 

 float away slowly, then it will hover. While it is hovering, get 

 out of the dune buggy and shoot him down with the RPG or homing 

 rocket launcher; it will blow up and fall down. 

 

 Sometimes when you drive out of the ghost town, at the of the 

 intersection of the dirt road leading out of the ghost town and 

 the road leading to the Sherman Dam, Pulaski will go too fast on 

 the left turn, go wide, and crash into a road sign on the side of 

 the road. Block him and hijack his car. Drive into the water just 

 north of the Sherman Dam. Do not go too fast though, or you will 

 lose Pulaski and fail the mission. Exit the car and just stay in 

 the water. Pulaski will run after you after you steal his car, and 

 end up walking into the water. Pulaski cannot swim, and will drown. 

 You will have killed Pulaski without using cheats or bullets. 

 

 Before you start mission, equip a sniper riffle. When the Pulaski 

 runs for the car, aim and zoom in. You will have enough time to 

 flatten the front and the rear tire. Then, hop in the Sand Rail 

 next to the cemetery and follow his car. Watch him; he will be 

 swerving all over the place. This will give you enough time to 

 shoot at the car or pull him out and shoot him. 

 

 

 OG Loc mission: 

 ————— 

 After getting the PCJ and beginning the chase, it is not necessary 

 to shoot at or try to knock Freddy off his bike. You simply need 

 to follow him. If you lose sight of him, just keeping him in the 

 zoomed version of the mini-map is enough to keep the mission going. 

 Try to follow his path, but if he gets out of sight, you can use 

 parallel streets and paths to continue. Pay attention to whether 

 his position is above or below you (a triangle instead of a square) 

 on the mini-map, and choose the appropriate course. At the end, 

 he will stop at a park in Vagos territory. Ride your PCJ up the 

 stairs past the gang to the top of the structure, then mow them 

 down as they clear the top of the steps. Additionally, if you 

 failed this mission the first time and try it again, you will be 

 prompted to trip skip. This makes you automatically get OG Loc, 

 and end up at the house where you ring the door bell. 

 

 

 Pier 69 mission: 

 —————- 

 Instead of chasing Ryder in the boat, wait until he approaches 

 in his boat, then enable the“Destroy all cars”code. The mission 

 will be instantly completed. 

 

 Billboard message In Reuniting The Families mission: 

 Along the highway in Los Santos is an advertisement on a billboard. 

 It has a woman on it with a can of pop on the side of her labeled 

 Sprunk. Under that, it reads“A taste of things to come”. At the 

 end of the Reuniting The Families mission, your car will go through 

 that billboard, changing the writing at the bottom to read 

 “A taste of come”. 

 

 

 Riot mission: 

 ————- 

 This mission is quite long and requires a lot of ammunition and 

 body armor. You must take over all of the gang territories in the 

 hood areas. Try driving concentric to the Johnson house going 

 outward in one big circle. Once you have established your territory, 

 the mission is complete and you can celebrate with Big Smoke and 

 continue with the other missions. 

 

 

 Robbing Uncle Sam mission: 

 ————————– 

 Before you climb over the gate, get a gun or Uzi and shoot the 

 two soldiers from outside . When you climb over the gate, shoot 

 the guard standing behind two crates . When you enter the warehouse, 

 use the forklift and carry two boxes at a time. Do this by sliding 

 the arms directly into the middle of two boxes. You can now carry 

 both of them at the same time. However, you cannot put two boxes 

 into the truck at the same time . By the time you carry the two 

 boxes behind the truck , one army guard will appear and Ryder will 

 try to kill him. Do not let him kill the guard by himself, as he 

 takes a long time and could lose a lot of health. After you have 

 carried the four boxes to the truck , there will be two boxes outside 

 the warehouse . They can be found at the left hand side of the 

 warehouse, and the other can be found at the place where you killed 

 the third soldier before you entered the warehouse. After when you 

 escape , two army vehicles will start to chase you. If you are lucky, 

 both of them can keep crashing and they will end up exploding. 

 

 Before starting the mission, find the TV Studios in the northwest 

 part of Los Santos. At the top of the stairs (in the car park), 

 you will find a sniper rifle. When you start the mission, do not 

 shoot the guard at the gate. Instead, run behind the building that 

 is on your left. Go up the stairs, walk along the pathway, and 

 drop down at the end. Run and climb up the container boxes that 

 are in front of you. You may get shot a few times, but if you are 

 fast, you will survive. Use the sniper rifle to shoot all the 

 guards (do not open the gate yet). After you have opened the 

 warehouse door by shooting the switch on the right and have 

 killed the two guards inside, move the boxes close to the door 

 by using the forklift. Also, move the two boxes outside (which 

 one of the guards was previously using for cover). You can now 

 open the front gate. If you use the sniper rifle, you will not 

 have to keep running around. You should be able to load the boxes 

 quickly while Sweet covers you. Note: Keep an eye on Sweet’s health. 

 You may need to stop loading and shoot a few guards if he starts 

 to lose too much health. 

 

 When you pull up to the gate, hop the wall and shoot the guard at 

 the gate. Go and shoot the two other guards by the warehouse, then 

 shoot the keypad next to the door. Kill the men inside the warehouse. 

 Turn back around and another guard will be running towards you. 

 Shoot him, then hop on the forklift and put the crates by the 

 warehouse door where the truck backs up to. Then, get the two crates 

 that are outside and put them by the other ones. Keep one elevated 

 on the forklift. Shoot the keypad on the gate. Get back on the 

 forklift. Put the first crate inside the truck, then get off and 

 kill the soldier attacking Ryder. Then, get another crate and do 

 the same thing. Every time you load one crate, another soldier will 

 appear. Keep getting off the forklift and kill them. This takes some 

 time, but you and Ryder will not get killed. Get back in the truck 

 when Ryder tells you to and leave. The two Patroits that follow you 

 will be easy to get rid of. 

 

 After loading the six crates in the truck, before you jump into the 

 van to drive away, run to the stairs where the soldiers were coming 

 from. Take out the rocket launcher. The two Patriots will follow you 

 to the stairs and you can destroy them with the rocket launcher. 

 After taking them out, you will be able to get back safely with out 

 the nuisance of the Patriots chasing after you. 

 

 

 Stowaway mission: 

 —————– 

 To easily complete this mission, wheelie in a straight line to the 

 right of the plane, getting next to the ramp. When the plane has 

 offloaded the last of its barrels, turn sharply left and go up the 

 ramp. When aboard, it is critical not to use any firearms at all. 

 Even one shot is usually enough to blow you out of the sky. Also, 

 do not plant more than five charges, as they may self-detonate once 

 you pass that amount. Do not detonate the satchel charges until you 

 are standing on the end of the ramp, or you may not get out in time. 

 

 

 Supply Line mission: 

 ——————– 

 First, go after the man on the bike to your left when you take off. 

 Next, swing around and take out the man in the van. Then, head west 

 and take out the other van. This is the easy part. Instead of flying 

 across town to kill the motorbike and the last van, land on a building 

 close to where you started and just remain there. You will not lose 

 any fuel after your model airplane has landed. For some reason, the 

 other two couriers will make their way toward you. Sit patiently until 

 you can get behind the bike (it will reach you first), then land again 

 on a nearby building. The last van may end up on the freeway. You will 

 have a clear shot at him by flying only a few blocks, and you will be 

 close to Zero’s shop. Additionally, enable the“Fast motion”code 

 repeatedly (about five times) before entering the red marker to start 

 the mission. Your plane will fly faster, but your fuel will deplete 

 the same rate as if you were in normal time. Also, wait on Zero’s roof 

 until the van passes by, by doing this, you will save fuel. 

 

 

 Sweet’s Girl mission: 

 ——————— 

 Make sure you have a fast and reliable car in your garage before 

 staring the mission. Quickly drive to the yellow objective marker. 

 Drive your car on the sidewalk to mow down the Ballas. Keep going 

 into the basketball court at the end of the street to turn around and 

 make another pass. If your car starts smoking, quickly park it next 

 to any survivors and bail. The explosion should kill them. Get behind 

 some cover and shoot anyone remaining. 

 

 

 Tagging Up Turf mission: 

 ———————— 

 To spray over the last tag on the upper part of the building, walk to 

 the nearby small fenced in alley. You will be instructed to climb it. 

 Do so, cross to the other higher fence and also climb that. Then, climb 

 the short wall, then climb again to the ledge that you can use to walk 

 to the tag. 

 

 

 Tanker Commander mission: 

 ————————- 

 After hooking up the trailer, jump out of the truck. The gas station 

 attendant and a friend will be in a car nearby. It will repeatedly 

 crash into the stationary truck and trailer and become damage. Stay 

 out of the way and shoot the car when it is in a safe position until 

 it catches on fire. The gas station attendant will bail. Shoot him, 

 then get back in the truck and carefully drive it to the destination 

 marker. 

 

 

 Toreno’s Last Flight mission: 

 —————————– 

 When you go to take out Toreno, wait until his helicopter’s energy bar 

 appears. Then, enable the“Destroy all cars”code. 

 

 

 Up, Up, And Away mission: 

 ————————- 

 Instead of going directly into the military compound and fighting the 

 soldiers, steal a Leviathan from the Las Venturas airport. Land it outside 

 of Woozie’s casino. After the mission briefing, fly above the destination 

 marker. You should see a helipad with a Leviathan in the distance. Try to 

 land near the helipad and watch out for two soldiers armed with rocket 

 launchers. Bail out if needed near the helipad. Kill the armed soldiers, 

 shoot down the other helicopters, then finish the mission. Instead of 

 fighting all the soldiers downstairs, all you had to do is kill two men 

 and destroy two helicopters. 

 

 

 Vertical Bird mission: 

 ———————- 

 Your mission is to board the aircraft carrier by jumping off your boat and 

 swimming inside. If you drive your boat into the back of the loading docks 

 of the aircraft carrier, your cover is blown. Run and gun to the radar room 

 and take out the SAM launcher. Afterwards, run to the back of the carrier, 

 and before you take off with the Hydra, blow up two of the three Hydras. 

 Do not destroy the one on the loading elevator, as this is the one you want. 

 Then, take off and you will only have one other Hydra to shoot down with 

 instead of three. After you have taken out the enemy Hydra, sink the three 

 spy boats by hovering your jet instead of flying. 

 

 

 Wrong Side Of The Tracks mission: 

 ——————————— 

 Once at the station, do not get on the dirt bike. Instead, enable the 

 “Spawn Jetpack”code, then kill the men on the train with the shotgun. 

 Once you have killed the men on the train, you must go back to Smoke and 

 get on the dirt bike to pass the mission. Additionally, smoke has very 

 bad aim. Try to keep up speed with the train. When Smoke tells too take 

 the hill, do not, as this makes completing the mission almost impossible. 

 Instead, stay with the moving train. Go past the barrier and try to avoid 

 getting hit by the other train. Also, turn off the vibration option on the 

 controller to help keep your hands steady while on the tracks. 

 

 

 Notre Dame parody in Las Venturas: 

 ———————————- 

 Enter the bar called The Craw Bar in Las Venturas. As soon as you enter, 

 you will see a small Notre Dame sign that instead reads“Notre Lame”on 

 the wall directly ahead.

 DRIV3R, only they changed“Reflections”to“Refractions”. 

 

 

 Grand Theft Auto 3 reference in Farewell My Love mission: 

 ——————————————————— 

 The man who Catalina is with is the main character from Grand Theft Auto 3. 

 At the end of the mission, she gives a pink slip but it is not to her car 

 She says that she needs her car because they are going to Liberty City.

 where you meat Tenpenny (at a donut shop) for a mission, look at the wall

 Auto: Vice City. 

 

 

 Grand Theft Auto 3 reference: 

 —————————– 

 Pay close attention to the shows that are heard on WFTC while cruising around 

 San Andreas. Notice that one of the shows is called“Gardening With Maurice”. 

 If listened to Chatterbox in Grand Theft Auto 3 , you may remember Lazlow 

 (the host) talking to a caller who said“Gardening With Maurice”got taken 

 off the air. Obviously this game takes place further in the past, so 

 “Gardening With Maurice”is still on.

 Grand Theft Auto: Vice City reference in Los Santos: 

 —————————————————- 

 Near the Vinewood area and the Market district, there is a giant studio company 

 that you can enter. If you look at it, these buildings are the same ones that

 the company is posted. It is Interglobal Television.

 the junkyard level in Manhunt. You can also find a Dozer here to drive. 

 

 

 Radio comments: 

 ——————————– 

 * Afer doing some Grove Street missions and seizing territory, one of the DJs on the 

 radio will say“Have you heard Grove Streets making a comeback? That’s great news. 

 hope they don’t take me out just for playing this music.” 

 

 * After the 555 We Tip mission, another DJ says“Did you hear about that D.A. with 

 the trunk full of drugs? I can’t believe that. Keeping it all for his own personal 

 stash.”

 —— 

 Submitted by: Pancham.R.Bharadwaj 

 

 Modify vehicle characteristics: 

 ——————————- 

 Use a text editor to edit the“handling.cfg”file in the“\rockstar games\gta san 

 andreas\data”directory. You will find a list of all the vehicles and a description 

 of each multiplier factor. You can modify the acceleration, top speed, mass, 

 monetary value, transmission, gravity center, and much more. 

 

 

 Two player mode: 

 —————- 

 Successfully complete the Burning Desire mission where you rescue Denise. A red 

 two player free roam icon will now appear on Denise’s porch near the door. The 

 icon will appear there when she is home and will go on a date. Note: If both enter 

 a car, the passenger will have free aim with a machine gun. Do not try to kill 

 Denise, because you will never be able to date her again or play in two player 

 mode at her house. Additionally, once you get your girlfriend, take her on a date. 

 After you drop her off, there will be a rotating icon of two people directly in 

 front of the door. Walk into it. It will tell you to push any button on the 

 controller two. Do so to start two player mode, involving CJ and his girlfriend 

 in a free roam. 

 

 For more fun in two player mode, start the two player mission. Then, enable the 

 “Spawn Jetpack”code and remove the Jetpack. Then, have player two get the Jetpack. 

 Enable the Jetpack code again, then have player one get it. Both players can now 

 fly around and do the two player missions this way. 

 

 

 Two player mode in Los Santos: 

 —————————— 

 Note: You must have a second controller inserted in port two. In the Ganton area, 

 start from Grove Street where the Johnson house is located. Drive under the first 

 bridge and continue to go straight. Next, youshould drive over some railroad tracks. 

 After this, you should drive under a second bridge. Take the first right turn you 

 see. It should be a dead end. Drive until your car hits the grass, then look to 

 your left. You should see an open doorway. Walk through it and you should see a 

 small“2 Player”icon. Press any button on controller two to begin. Additionally, 

 when you are on the missions from Big Smoke go north of his house. You should see 

 some wrecked buildings. Go through them to find a two player free roam icon. 

 

 

 Two player mode in San Fierro: 

 —————————— 

 Not far from the garage you own and beyond the construction area is a large 

 building with a parking lot on either side, on the right side (north according 

 to the map) is a two player icon. Multiple people types can be selected by the 

 second player (three women and three men). Unlike those from the dating missions, 

 this two player location will never go away. 

 

 

 Two player mode in Bone County: 

 ——————————- 

 Starting at the abandoned airstrip, go west and north onto the road. There is a 

 blackish-brown building on the south side of the road with a large balcony going 

 all the way around it. Follow the balcony half way around and you will find a two 

 player mode icon. 

 

 

 Two player mode in Tierra Robada: 

 ——————————— 

 Start at your safe house in El Quebrados. Get on the street and follow it a short 

 distance south until it turns left around the corner of a building. On the south 

 side of this building will be a two player free roam icon. 

 

 

 Two player mode in Whetstone: 

 —————————– 

 Go to the General Store in Dilmore. There is a two player icon there. The second 

 player will be able to change their character. 

 

 

 Freight Train missions bonus: 

 —————————–

 free train rides. 

 

 

 Fire truck missions bonus: 

 ————————– 

 Steal a fire truck and start the fire truck missions. Successfully complete level 

 12 of the fire truck missions to make CJ fireproof. 

 

 

 Easily complete fire truck missions: 

 ———————————— 

 Bring a fire truck from another location into Angel Pine, then start the mission. 

 This should be easier than doing it in Los Santos, San Fierro, the desert, or Las 

 Venturas. When you do it at this location, and you are stuck on a cliff that you 

 cannot get up (for example, if the burning car is on the freeway), take your time 

 by taking the long way. You should only use this method if you have at least three 

 minutes or more time remaining. Note: All fires will not always appear in Angel 

 Pine, as they may also happen in Whetstone or other nearby places. Although this 

 sounds difficult, there are not that many roads near the Angel Pine area which 

 actually makes it easier to complete. If the fire truck gets severely damaged, 

 enable the“Health”code. 

 

 

 Mike Toreno missions bonus: 

 ————————— 

 Successfully complete all missions assigned by Mike Toreno to get a flamethrower, 

 minigun, rocket launcher, and homing rocket launcher to appear at his cabin in

 northeast part of Angel Pine is a medical building with an Ambulance next to it. 

 Get in it and start the missions. All the victims will appear in the city, which 

 is very small. The farthest person will only be about ten seconds away from the 

 drop off point. You can complete the missions in less then ten minutes by doing 

 this. Also, the cops do not appear very often, allowing your wanted level to remain 

 low. Additionally, do the Paramedic mission in the Angel Pine area. Start the 

 missions. 

 

 All injured people that must be taken to the hospital will be in the crowded town. 

 Unlike the fire truck missions if done in this town, this mission has all the people 

 in one place. Once you complete this mission, you will your health increased to 150. 

 This is a also very good reward because you can jump from the highest place in the 

 game without dying from the fall. Note: If you have the parachute in your inventory, 

 you will die.

 level 12 of the vigilante missions to get an armor limit of 150. 

 

 

 Easily complete vigilante missions: 

 ———————————– 

 Use the Rhino to complete the vigilante missions easier. Additionally, start the 

 mission, put the vehicle in your garage, and exit so that the door closes. Enable 

 the“Destroy all cars”code. The criminals will be killed. Run back to the garage, 

 hop in the car, and repeat. This is also a good way to quickly gain more money and 

 status points. 

 

 Get an FBI Rancher and drive onto the Julius Thruway in Las Venturas. Start 

 Vigilante mode and begin driving around the highway. Just stay on the highway, 

 and you will notice that the criminals start dying for no apparent reason. Just 

 drive for about twenty minutes to get the 150 armor award easily. 

 

 Increase respect, money, driving skill and armor in vigilante missions 

 Enable the“Spawn Rhino tank”code and use it for the vigilante missions. When you 

 reach level 12, your armor will increase to 150. Each time you kill a group of 

 criminals, you will get money (on level 20 and over you will be winning $50,000 

 or more). If you get a wanted level, do not cheat to lower it. As police ram you, 

 they will explode and your respect will increase. All the driving that you will 

 do increases your driving skill somewhat. 

 

 

 Horseshoe bonus: 

 —————- 

 Collect all fifty horseshoes in Las Venturas to get a M4, MP5, combat shotgun, 

 and satchel charges to appear at the Four Dragons Casino.

 ———-

 shotgun, and Molotov cocktails to appear inside your house on Grove Street. 

 

 

 100% game completion bonuses: 

 —————————– 

 Successfully complete the game with a 100% game completion. CJ will get a stats 

 boost, extra money, and a Rhino and Hydra will be delivered to CJ’s house on Grove 

 Street. 

 

 

 Increase muscle or stamina: 

 ————————— 

 At about 22:00, go to a gym and work out, maxing yourself. After you have worked 

 out enough for the day, wait another minute until the time is 0:00. Max yourself 

 out for that day then go home. Save two or three times and you can repeat this 

 process. 

 

 To get your character maxed out in the muscle and stamina attributes, do the 

 following. Go the gym near the Johnson house. Work out until you are told that 

 it is enough for one day. Go home (right down the block), save the game to 

 advance to the next day. Return to the gym and you can work out again. You can 

 now max out your muscle and stamina in less then a half hour. 

 

 

 Increase weapon skill: 

 ———————- 

 Achieve a high wanted level and go into a restaurant. Shoot everyone with the 

 weapon that you want to raise in rank. If you walk around and wait, police will 

 spawn, but will not shoot you. Police can raise your weapon skill faster than 

 pedestrians. This works best in Burger Shot because of the wide area that you 

 can walk around in. Continue until you reach Hitman status. 

 

 Use the following trick in front of any safe house. Use the gun you want to get 

 up to Hitman status to repeatedly shoot a car until it explodes. Then, go to the 

 next car. Repeat this until you reach Hitman status for that weapon. Watch out 

 for the police. You can shoot them, then keep shooting the cars. When you are 

 almost dead, enter your safe house and save the game. Your health will be restored 

 and wanted level removed. 

 

 Get lots of bullets for the guns that you want Hitman or Gangster status for. 

 Go to Tierra Robada. Look around at the north of the island to find a little house. 

 Stay in there and enable the“Increase wanted level”code three times. Stay in the 

 cabin and wait for the police to approach. When they enter the house, kill them. 

 

 To attain Hitman level quicker, select your desired weapon and go to a Pay‘N’ 

 Spray. Park your vehicle directly next to the Pay‘N’Spray. Exit the vehicle and 

 repeatedly shoot people, cars, and cops. When your wanted level is raised to two 

 stars or above, run to your vehicle and drive into the Pay‘N’Spray to cancel it. 

 If your vehicle is not damaged, the respray is free. Wait for the wanted stars to 

 stop flashing, then start shooting people again. 

 

 Go into a police station and find a room with one entry point, and something that 

 you can hide behind (like a desk). Take out your weapon. You should now have a 

 two star wanted level. Shoot any cop who comes through the door. Every cop you 

 shoot makes your gun skill go up by about five. Do this until you either die, run 

 out of bullets, or enable the“Lower wanted level”code. 

 

 

 Increase driving skill: 

 ———————– 

 Go to San Fierro and pass the tests at the driving school. Additionally, find a 

 tractor or a slow moving car. Drive the roads without going as fast as you can 

 (move slowly). This will take awhile, but will increase your driving skills. 

 

 

 Increase underwater skill: 

 ————————– 

 Repeatedly swim underwater to increase your lung capacity and your underwater skill. 

 

 

 Easily max Lung Capacity: 

 ————————- 

 Dive underwater, and once your breath is out, you will start losing health. If 

 you want to stay underwater, keep enabling the“Armor, health, money, and street 

 creds”code when your health is low. You will be able to remain underwater, and 

 max your Lung Capacity attribute easily. 

 

 

 Raising stats quicker: 

 ———————- 

 Go to any pier over any body of water. Swim under the pier and stay in one position. 

 This will immensely raise your muscle, stamina, and lung capacity in just under a 

 minute. Stay under longer for better results. 

 

 

 Return to land faster: 

 ———————- 

 If you get stuck in the water, enable the“Spawn Hotring Racer”then“Spawn 

 Jetpack”codes. It will not appear until you are on a non watery surface. Quickly 

 jump on the car. It may be a far ride, but it is better than swimming. 

 

 

 Unlock areas quickly: 

 ——————— 

 Enable the“Wanted level never increases”code. Go to the shaded areas of the 

 game and they will become unlocked. If you go to a safe house and save the game, 

 all areas will be unlocked from now on. However, in order not to be wanted when 

 you go back into these areas, you must enable the“Wanted level never increases” 

 code again, but you will be free to roam about. 

 

 

 Revealing territories: 

 ———————- 

 Get a plane and fly all the way to either the southeast, southwest, northeast, 

 or northwest of the map where the ocean is found. Keep flying for thirty minutes 

 in that direction, then jump out of the plane. Do not open the parachute and 

 intentionally drown. When you arrive at the hospital, check your map. You will 

 see that there are enormous amounts of new territories in San Fierro, Las Venturas, 

 and some in Las Santos. You can take over these territories, and they only have 

 one wave. 

 

 

 Quick map fill in Los Santos: 

 —————————– 

 To get all of the map showing in the starting area of the game, get on the freeway 

 and continue going until you cannot go further. Then, pause the game and the entire 

 bottom right half of the map should be marked as explored. 

 

 

 Gain respect: 

 ————- 

 To gain respect, stay in your neighborhood and get a wanted star, then kill all 

 the police that arrives. Once you reach a four star wanted level (and if you killed 

 enough police), you will gain some respect. Additionally, completing missions is 

 not the only way to earn respect. By spraying other gang’s tags, you will also 

 earn a bit, and by taking over another gang’s area you will earn a lot. 

 Note: You must have completed some missions before you can take over areas. You 

 can see on the radar witch areas you have taken over, and which areas the enemy 

 gangs own. Your own territory is marked with green, and your enemies are yellow 

 or purple. 

 

 

 Respect status: 

 ————— 

 Your respect is made up of the following factors: 

 

 Running Respect (see below): 40% 

 Mission Progress: 36% 

 Territory Under Control: 6% 

 Money: 6% 

 Fitness: 4% 

 Clothes: 4% 

 Girlfriend Progress: 4% 

 Your Running Respect is changed by the following factors: 

 

 Territory gained: +30% 

 Killing a gang member: +.5% 

 Killing a dealer: +.005% 

 Killing a member of your gang: -.005% 

 A member of your gang is killed: -2% 

 Territory lost: -3% 

 Your respect affects the number of gang members that you can recruit: 

 

 Above  1%: 2 

 Above 10%: 3 

 Above 20%: 4 

 Above 40%: 5 

 Above 60%: 6 

 Above 80%: 7 

 

 

 Easy money: 

 ———– 

 Walk into a bar and beat up all the customers with a bat, nightstick, or pool cue. 

 More customers spawn and your wanted level will not rise. No one pulls out a gun, 

 and your maximum health will increase after a number of fights. Beating up the 

 person next to the pool tables gets you a pool cue, and every once in awhile a 

 customer will spill a few hundred dollars. 

 

 Find a save point that is close to a betting shop. The one in the Montgomery are 

 is ideal because it is near to the save point where you have to do the four 

 missions for Catalina. Save your game, then go to the betting shop and bet all 

 your money on a horse. It takes awhile to enter the numbers, but is worth it 

 because you can make a huge amount of cash (especially if you bet on horses with 

 odds of 10/1, 11/1, 12/1, etc.). It takes roughly three to four minutes to bet 

 the maximum amount of money, which is $9,999,995. You will not win every time. 

 When you lose, reload your last saved game. It is possible to get $250,000,000 by 

 betting your winnings of $30,000 to $700.000 to $2,000,000 to the maximum bet. 

 

 Enable the“Deadly vehicle”and“Flying cars”codes. When you are up in the air, 

 fly down to the ground and hit it to get money for a unique trick. The higher you 

 go and hit the ground, the more money you can make. You can also deactivate the 

 code while in the air and hit the ground to make a lot of money. 

 

 Enable the“Flying cars”code. Fly around for a few seconds, then touch the ground. 

 You will get money for insane stunts. 

 

 

 Easy Hitman rating: 

 ——————- 

 Shoot at the black part of a wheel. If you shoot at the rim it will not work. 

 Keep on shooting until the skill bar is all the way up for the desired weapon. 

 

 

 Easy dual sawn-off shotgun ability: 

 ———————————– 

 It is recommended that you spray all 100 tags, as it is easier for ammunition 

 and early on missions. Get a cop car (preferably a car, OT truck, rancher, etc.). 

 Save it in the Johnson family garage; save the game if desired. Get a large amount 

 of sawn-off shotgun ammunition. If all 100 tags were sprayed, it is available in 

 Johnson kitchen. Go to the garage. Get as far away from the car as possible without 

 letting the garage door close. Then crouch, aim for the grill of the police car, 

 and shoot. Every few shots (or every time the car catches fire), you should have 

 more weapon skill. It will eventually upgrade about every minute. When it catches 

 on fire, let the garage repair the car and come back. This does not work as well 

 at getting Hitman on the other weapons. 

 

 

 Easy money in Los Santos: 

 ————————- 

 From the Johnson house in the Ganton area, go straight until you are in the front 

 yard of the house opposite of yours. Turn right, and go behind it by going between 

 that house and the one next to it. Go in the backyard until you are in the corner. 

 You should see a pistol. Take it, then get back to Grove Street. If you see man, 

 usually in black, that is standing there with his arms crossed, shoot him. 

 He usually carries about $2,000 or more and a pistol, because he is a drug dealer. 

 Repeat this to get easy money. Kill him quickly before he shoots you. It is 

 possible to get $50,000 in one day by doing this. 

 

 Upon exiting the Johnson house in Grove Street, walk straight toward the house 

 opposite of yours, which is the one that sometimes has the BMX bike in the front 

 yard, until you are in the grass. Go to your right between that house and the one 

 next to it. Walk toward the corner and get the pistol. Go back to Grove Street and 

 find a drug dealer. He is dressed in black with his hands crossed down at his hips. 

 You will know he is a drug dealer because if you face him, he will try to do 

 business. You will get a pop-up display in the top-right part of your screen on 

 how to respond to him, even though you cannot actually buy anything. If you shoot 

 and kill him, he drops $2,000 dollars or more, and a gun just like that one you 

 picked up. Note: He will shoot back—try to get a headshot. There is another 

 drug dealer that is wearing a white hooded sweatshirt that does the same thing. 

 He can usually be found up in the northeast part of Los Santos. You can find 

 these dealers all over Los Santos in the areas littered with gangs. 

 

 Go to the building with the parachute. When you get to the top, spawn a Caddy. 

 Get in and drive slowly towards the edge of the building, then just fall off. 

 You will begin to flip slowly. However, if you nudge the edge of the building, 

 the Caddy will spin and flip like crazy. When you hit the ground, you will get a 

 very large insane stunt bonus. 

 

 Find the Inside Track Betting building in the Downtown area. Bet the maximum 

 amount on the horse with the worst odds. If you lose, reload the game and try 

 again. When you win, it will be a substantial amount. 

 

 Go to the Pig Pen Strip Club. You can jump on the big stage with the srtipper. 

 Stand directly in front of her, and people will throw $100 to her each time, 

 which you can collect. Be very careful not to touch her, or the guards will 

 start shooting at you. Note: This cheat takes awhile—eat before you go. 

 

 Get a weapon, then stand outside the your house in the Ganton area. Shoot your 

 homies (wearing green). Some of them will drop a lot of money. Pick it up, and 

 if you have a wanted level go inside and save the game. Repeat this to get a 

 large amount of money. 

 

 This trick requires maximum bike skill for both motorcycles and a regular bike. 

 Go to the highest building in Los Santos, the circular one, and jump off using 

 either the motorcycle or bike. While you are in mid-air, you can spin for a 

 little bit or try to do a back flip. Stay on the bikes until you land and you 

 will receive an insane stunt bonus for over $200. 

 

 Enable the“Kinky theme”code and enter the Ganton area with a nice car. 

 Drive up the alley were the burglar truck is located. Park there and within 

 seconds prostitutes will approach. Press Left to accept their offer, then get 

 out of your car and kill them when they are done. You will get more money than 

 paid. 

 

 Easy Stamina upgrade in Los Santos: 

 Go to the Ganton Gym in Los Santos. Go to the bicycle and start at level 1. 

 Work your way up to level 10. After awhile it will say that you have worked 

 to your limit and to return. Keep pedaling and your stamina will start to 

 increase. 

 

 Use the following trick to get a lot of weapons, increase your muscle, 

 increase your stamina, and get a“Hitman”rating with any weapon. After the 

 initial mission, go to the Verona beach area (on the south part of the map 

 near the ocean). There is a free open gym here. Use it to increase your muscle 

 and stamina. when you need to eat, there is a free hot dog stand down the path 

 east of the gym, or just save the game at your house. To get“Hitman”status 

 with any gun, find the weapon of your choice and shoot people or cars. 

 Try going to any parking lot and shooting cars. It is easier and they respawn 

 if you ride a short distance away and return. You can get as much money as 

 desired doing the fire truck missions, then going to the off track betting 

 after getting at least $10,000. Bet 10% of your money on the last horse until 

 you win. If you lose too much money, reload your game and return. Repeat this 

 process until you have a good amount of money. 

 

 

 Easy weapons in Los Santos: 

 ————————— 

 Drive around and hit Ballas. When they are dead, pick up their guns then get 

 back in your car and find more. This will get you a lot of weapons very fast. 

 

 

 Easy Hitman rating in Los Santos: 

 ——————————— 

 This trick requires a controller in port two. To get an easy Hitman rating 

 for either the 9 mm pistol or shotgun, go to the Los Santos Police Department. 

 Note the two player icon across the street. Quickly enter the Police 

 Department. Run and ignore any cops shooting at you and get the armor in the 

 locker room. It is the first room on your right. There is an available pistol 

 in the room on the right, at the far end of the hall. Proceed to dispose of 

 the police using your pistol. If you need ammunition, the cops will drop a 

 gun after you kill them. Your weapon skill will quickly raise as you kill the 

 swarms of police that come after you. Continue shooting until your armor level 

 becomes low or is gone. Then, run to the far end of the police station hall, 

 down the stairs, and into the holding cells. In the middle cell is more armor. 

 Use it and continue your massacre until your armor is once again depleted. 

 Next, quickly run out of the door and across the street to the two player 

 icon. Start two player mode. Simply kill the second player and your wanted 

 level will be gone and your health will be refilled. Repeat this to gain 

 Hitman status or simply gain ammunition. Note: Hitman status with the pistols 

 will allow duel wielding, faster firing, improved accuracy, lock-on range 

 increased and faster strafing. There is also a shotgun hidden in the police 

 station in the room on your left as you enter, then to the room at the right 

 at the end of that one. The shotgun may not respawn as soon as you enter, 

 but in at least 60 seconds one should appear. You can use this available 

 shotgun to reach Hitman status with. Note: Hitman status with the shotgun 

 only gives you improved accuracy, move while firing, faster firing rate and 

 lock-on range increased—not duel wielding. Duel wielding can only be 

 achieved with the sawed-off shotgun. 

 

 To raise your weapon skills quickly, enter a dance club, such as the 

 “Alhambra”in the Idlewood area. Begin shooting people with the weapon 

 of your choice. Doing so during the afternoon or night hours (12:00 to 04:00) 

 greatly increases the amount of people that respawn in the club. Since so 

 many people spawn, you have a virtually limitless amount of people to“train” 

 with. Doing so however, raises your wanted level greatly. Enable the 

 “Lower wanted level”code or know where the police bribes are, as you will 

 need them. 

 

 Go to the actual beach part of the Verona Beach area. Start shooting with 

 the desired gun. The cops will arrive after awhile, but you can make them 

 go away or just kill them for more. Keep doing this until the desired gun 

 is at Hitman level. It is possible to get four weapons up to Hitman level 

 in about an hour. 

 

 Walk out from CJ’s house and make sure there a car in his garage. Use any 

 weapon to shoot the car in the garage until it catches on fire. Walk away 

 and let the garage close Then, open it and repeat the steps. You can do 

 this with any weapon to get an easy Hitman level. 

 

 Go into the bar near CJ’s house in the Ganton area. Kill everyone there 

 and try to get a two or three star wanted level. Start killing the police 

 that come through the door. When no one remains, turn around and look. 

 They should be there. 

 

 Go to your house in Grove Street. Start randomly killing people until 

 you have two star wanted level. Kill all the cops with any desired weapon. 

 Make sure you have armor on. When you have low health, save the game, then 

 repeat. 

 

 

 Easy races: 

 ———– 

 Before you enter a race, enable the“Cars fly away”code. During the countdown, 

 start entering the“Pedestrians riot”code, but do not press the final button 

 until they take off. Run over all the racers and ram their cars. 

 

 

 Easy Pilot license: 

 ——————- 

 Go to the airport in San Fierro and enable the“Spawn Jetpack”code. 

 Enter the Shamel jet and enable the“Speed up time”code. Fly it until a 

 message appears in the corner. Fly it for about five or ten more minutes 

 and you will have a pilot license without going to pilot school. Note: 

 Make sure you save the game. 

 

 

 Saving money: 

 ————- 

 Buy lots of ammunition for the Tec-9 which costs about $300. When you 

 have enough, buy one SMG. The game will transfer all your Tec-9 ammunition 

 into your SMG, saving you thousands of dollars. Note: This does not work 

 for the pistols, rifles, or thrown weapons. 

 

 

 Free Pay N’Spray: 

 —————— 

 Get a car that can be used for the pimping missions. Go to a Pay N’Spray. 

 When the door is closing, start the pimping missions. Then, deactivate the 

 missions after the door has closed and is re-opening. The door will open 

 again, giving you a free spray. You can repeat this as many times as desired. 

 

 

 Cheap car bomb: 

 ————— 

 Get a fast car or a motorcycle. Either shoot the vehicle or bang it up real 

 good. When it is on fire, jump out. This technique is also good for taking 

 over hoods quickly and easily. 

 

 

 Descend quickly: 

 —————- 

 When stuck at the top of a cliff or mountain and you need to go to the bottom, 

 do not bother going the long way around to get down safely. Instead, edge 

 yourself to the end of the cliff/mountain and slowly but surely you will 

 slide down the side and land safely at the bottom. 

 

 

 Lose weight quickly: 

 ——————– 

 If you want to lose weight quickly, enable the“Speed up time”code. 

 

 Jump off building with motorcycles or bikes in Los Santos 

 Take any motorcycle or bike to the entrance of the tallest building in Los 

 Santos. You will be taken to the roof. Note: This only works with this 

 building and two-wheeled vehicles. 

 

 

 Basketball Challenge mini-game: 

 ——————————- 

 Go to one of the basketball courts that have full courts and a chain link 

 fence round them. One of the hoops will have a basketball. Walk up to the 

 basketball and start playing. While playing basketball, start the Basketball 

 Challenge mini-game. A red marker will appear on the court. Run to the red 

 marker and shoot the ball. If you make the shot, the red marker will move 

 to a new spot on the court. The goal of the mini-game is to sink as many 

 shots as you can before time runs out. Each shot you make adds a few seconds 

 on to the clock. When time runs out, CJ will automatically resume playing 

 basketball. Your highest score will be recorded and shown the next time you 

 play the Basketball Challenge mini-game. 

 

 

 Play basketball in Los Santos: 

 —————————— 

 After completing the Taggin Up Turf mission, you can go beside Sweet’s house. 

 There will be a basketball court with a basketball in the middle. Walk up to 

 it and start playing basketball. Note: You can only play by yourself. 

 

 

 Play pool and arcade games in Los Santos: 

 —————————————– 

 Go out of CJ’s neighborhood in Ganton. At night, you will see a bar with 

 beer bottles flashing on top of it. It is next to the bridge. Go inside the 

 bar, and there will be a man next to the pool table. Walk up to him and play 

 a game of pool. You can also bet money on the game. There are also arcade 

 games you can play in the bar. 

 

 

 Bet on horses: 

 ————– 

 Near the Downtown and Mulholland Intersection areas (under the highway, 

 next to the big parking lot), is a building called Inside Track Betting 

 (with red/pink/blue posters). The entrance is just in front of it, and 

 you can play a horse race game. You first bet on one of the horse to win, 

 then the amount of money. Afterwards you can see the race. 

 

 

 Vending machines: 

 —————– 

 When you find a vending machine that serves chips, zoom in on it with 

 a pistol or rifle. It is blurry, but you can tell that the chips inside 

 the machine are real-life brands. Some chips that can be easily identified 

 are Doritos, Lay’s Potato Chips, and Munchos, to name a few. 

 

 

 Breaking fences: 

 —————- 

 Walk up to a fence and either punch it or cut it with a chainsaw. 

 

 

 Climbing trees: 

 ————— 

 To climb a tree, find a ledge that will allow you to jump to the branches 

 at the top of a tree. If you hit them correctly, CJ should grab onto the 

 branches and allow you to pull him up. There is an easily accessible one 

 just outside of Glen Park Hospital to practice with. 

 

 

 Destroying cars quickly: 

 ———————— 

 To quickly blow up cars, shoot the gas tank. This is useful when killing 

 a lot of people at once. 

 

 

 Expand and shrink moon: 

 ———————– 

 Use a sniper rifle to shoot the moon to make it expand, then shrink in size. 

 

 

 Eating too much: 

 —————- 

 If you eat too much in a restaurant you will vomit on the floor and the 

 cashier will laugh at you. After this happens, you cannot eat again for a 

 while. 

 

 

 Effects of being fat: 

 ——————— 

 When you are fat, CJ will say different phrases. For example, when you are 

 fighting he will say“I got weight on my side,”or“I may be big, but I 

 ain’t slow”. The downside to being fat is that when your body fat meter 

 gets full, you run the risk of having a heart attack. This only happens in 

 very rare circumstances. You will return to the nearest hospital. Also, 

 if you have no muscle stat, or very little, you may not be able to climb 

 high walls or“super sprint”. When fat, CJ will waddle around like a penguin, 

 and if you look closely (this happens with no shirt) the fat on his body 

 will wobble. 

 

 

 Take a photo of yourself: 

 ————————- 

 Have the camera active as your current weapon, then target a member of your 

 own gang. Give them the camera and they will snap a picture of CJ. 

 

 

 Radio stations diss each other: 

 ——————————- 

 Listen to Radio Los Santos and K-DST. On Radio Los Santos, at times between 

 songs, Julio G. (station DJ) will make fun of the Playback FM DJ, saying 

 “Playback FM has some cool records, but the DJ is wack,”and Tommy“Nightmare” 

 Smith, (K-DST DJ) will make fun of the Radio X DJ, usually just before the 

 song“Running Down a Dream”. He will say,“You know, I can’t bear that chick 

 on Radio X, or is it Rock X, Rock…listen sweetheart, get over it.” 

 

 

 Radio shout-out from Denise: 

 —————————- 

 After you obtain Denise as you girlfriend after the Burning Desire mission, 

 listen to Radio Los Santos. At times between songs, Julio G. (the DJ) will 

 have a shout-out from Denise to you, and at the end he criticizes the shout 

 out by saying“I got a shout out from Denise in Ganton who says she misses 

 her boy desperately. And I quote, desperately. Hey, you know, this isn’t 

 Lonely Hearts, this is Radio Los Santos.” 

 

 

 Screensaver: 

 ———— 

 Allow the game to idle for a few minutes. The HUD will disappear and the game 

 will zoom in on other nearby people instead of CJ. 

 

 

 Wanted level officers, weapons, and vehicles: 

 ——————————————— 

 Depending on your wanted level, different law enforcement vehicles, officers, 

 and weapons will be used against you: 

 

 One star: Police officers on foot, in cars, and HPV1000s (police bikes) will 

 go after you. They have 9mms and nightsticks. If you do not have a gun out, 

 they will try to beat you with their nightsticks. If you have a gun out, they 

 will shoot. 

 

 Two stars: Police officers in cars and HPV1000s will come after you. They 

 will have 9mms and nightsticks, although they will not use their nightsticks. 

 They will shoot at you no matter what. If you are in a car, cops will drive 

 faster after you. 

 

 Three stars: Police officers in cars will go after you. They will have the 

 same weapons. Police choppers are now involved and shoot you from their guns. 

 Police cars will go fast enough to be able to keep up with you and roadblocks 

 will be in place at times, with officers shooting 9mms at your car. 

 

 Four stars: Cops in cars and SWAT officers will come after you in Enforcers 

 (SWAT vans). SWAT officers will now rappel from the police choppers. SWAT 

 officers are now in roadblocks and SWAT officers will have Micro SMGs. If 

 you are in an aircraft, a Hydra will go after you to shoot you down. 

 

 Five stars: FBI agents will go after you with FBI Ranchers. Most authorities 

 going after you will be the FBI; there will be less cop and SWAT cars. 

 The police chopper still goes after you, and the FBI will replace the 

 SWAT men in roadblocks. FBI agents carry SMGs. 

 

 Six stars: Military soldiers will go after you in Rhinos (tanks) and 

 Barracks trucks. They will replace the FBI in roadblocks. The army will 

 carry M4s. 

 

 

 Saving gang members: 

 ——————– 

 To save a gang member or bodyguard when you turn off the game, go to your 

 safe house. Go to your garage, run in the garage with your bodyguards. 

 Run out without your bodyguards, and then save the game. 

 

 

 Taking over gang territories easily: 

 ———————————— 

 An easy way to take over territories is to find a high place like a roof 

 top. First, kill a few gang members to start the war, then get onto a roof. 

 When you are up there, they will still shoot at you, but will not have 

 accurate aim and will miss frequently. 

 

 Note: It is recommended that the“Air Strip”missions be completed first. 

 To easily take over territories, go to the airstrip and take the Jetpack. 

 Go to any enemy territory and start a gang war by killing some enemy gang 

 members. Fly and land on any building roof you can easily see incoming 

 enemy gang members. Kill all gang members from up there. By doing this, 

 you can easily hold all enemy territories. Be patient when killing gang 

 members, and try to stay inside the war zone. The distance between the 

 airstrip and enemy territories is long, but this is the easiest way to 

 quickly and safely hold enemy gang territories. All territories can be 

 held by using the Jetpack, but only one by one. 

 

 

 Keep gang territory easily: 

 ————————— 

 If your gang turf is under attack, go to a save point and save the game. 

 When it is done saving, your turf will no longer be under attack and it 

 will still be yours. Additionally, when your hood is under attack, find 

 a police car or motorcycle, fire truck, ambulance, or taxi. Get in and 

 start the vehicle’s missions. Then, exit the missions and your hood will 

 be safe. 

 

 

 Gang member race: 

 —————– 

 You can do this trick in any race mission with the checkered flag on your 

 map. Bring a gang member with you. You can even bring three if the race 

 is with a four door car. Walk into the red mission circle. Select a race 

 and when it starts and counts down, you will see your gang member spawn 

 to the street and walk towards your car. The races will start, and you 

 must wait a moment before he gets in your car. 

 

 

 Manual aim with any weapon while driving: 

 —————————————– 

 Enable the“Manual weapon drive bys in cars”code and run out of bullets 

 in your Uzi, Tec-9, or Micro SMG. Get out of your vehicle, then select 

 the weapon of your choice (except grenades and rocket launchers). Get 

 back into the vehicle and enable any“Weapons”code. The crosshairs are 

 back on and you can shoot that weapon. 

 

 

 Hit pedestrian with the front of your shotgun: 

 ———————————————- 

 Note: This cannot be done with more than two weapons. Get a melee weapon 

 (baseball bat, dildo, or a police nightstick) and an ordinary shotgun. 

 If you have more than those two weapons this trick cannot be done. Switch 

 to your melee weapon. Walk up to a pedestrian and hit them, then immediately 

 switch to your shotgun. If done correctly, CJ should hit the pedestrian 

 with the shotgun as if he were using it as a melee weapon. 

 

 

 Roboi’s Food Mart asset in Los Santos: 

 ————————————– 

 Go to the 24-7 store located near the Conference Center area. Outside the 

 front parking lot will be a bike. Get on the bike and you will automatically 

 begin the courier missions, which require you to deliver packages thought 

 Los Santos by throwing them through rings at the destination. After completing 

 three levels you will acquire the 24-7 store. Use the bike that was in front 

 of to collect up to $2,000. 

 

 

 Reach hidden areas in Los Santos: 

 ——————————— 

 Enter the Ganton Gym and spawn the Jetpack. Go over the arrow, out but do not 

 go out. Fly up through a blank tile. An all-black area will appear. Use the 

 thermal goggles to see all the people you have killed. You can also see an 

 illegal tattoo parlor, a tornado, a hidden city in your garage in San Fierro, 

 a tornadom and other things. Do not lose height or you will have to kill 

 yourself when you land. 

 

 

 Spray paint as a weapon: 

 ———————— 

 The spray paint is not only meant for spraying tags. It also can be used as 

 a weapon. Aim the spray paint in the direction of a pedestrian and they will 

 lean forward, coughing. 

 

 

 Spray paint in Los Santos: 

 ————————– 

 There is a spray can located in the upstairs bedroom of CJ’s house in the 

 Ganton area. 

 

 Go in back of CJ’s house. Climb onto the wall and walk over to the his house. 

 Jump onto it then climb to the raised part of his house. Walk towards the 

 back of it, and you will see that there is a building connected to it. Walk 

 onto that building and you will see a can of paint. 

 

 

 Dildo and nightstick weapons in Los Santos: 

 ——————————————- 

 Enter the police station in the Pershing Square area of Los Santos. Walk 

 around inside the police station to find the shower/bathroom. In there you 

 will find a large purple dildo that can be used to hit people. There is 

 also a PR-24 (nightstick) in the police station as well. You can pick up the 

 dildo and the PR-24 without anything happening, but when you take the shotgun 

 you will get two stars on your wanted meter. 

 

 Go to the small town of Dillimore near Red County. Find the police station 

 with the garage opened up outside. Unequip your weapon and enter the police 

 station by walking over the entrance marker. Once inside, proceed into the 

 hallway ahead of you and take the first right into a locker room. In this l 

 ocker room will be body armor and a night stick. Keep walking behind the 

 locker room, and there will be an opening in the wall with a large walk-in 

 shower. Proceed into the shower and take an immediate right. You will see 

 a pink dildo spinning. You can pick this up as your melee weapon and begin 

 dildo-bashing people. 

 

 

 Cane in Los Santos: 

 ——————- 

 Go behind to the Vinewood sign. Search behind the“V”to find a cane that 

 can be used as a melee weapon. 

 

 

 Chainsaw in Los Santos: 

 ———————– 

 Follow the train tracks south towards the Ocean Docks area. Along the way 

 you should see some tire piles. Look around the stacks and you will find a 

 chainsaw.

 Shotgun in Los Santos: 

 ———————- 

 When you rob the pizzeria with Ryder in the beginning of the game, instead 

 of running to the car as soon as you get out of there, punch out the clerk 

 for the shotgun. Note: This works better if you get the brass knuckles 

 found underneath the over pass near your hood.

 Weapons storage warehouse in Los Santos: 

 —————————————- 

 Go to the Ocean Docks area in Los Santos. Look for railroad tracks and 

 follow them south until they lead to a building with boxcars. 

 The complex can only be entered by jumping the wall, going through the 

 boxcar warehouse, or by an opening to the right of the warehouse. 

 The boxcar warehouse has a sawed-off shotgun (you will need a car to 

 get it) in one of the cars, a plank bridge that leads to body armor, 

 and gas grenades located at the back exit. A short distance away from 

 the back exit, you will see an entrance to another warehouse. This one 

 is full of crates. Go through the crates to find stairs. Behind the 

 stairs is an AK-47. Go up the stairs to find more body armor. 

 

 

 Dual weapons: 

 ———— 

 Reach the“Hitman”rank in a weapon skill to be able to wield two of 

 that weapon at once. To increase your weapon skill, practice at the 

 shooting range or use that weapon frequently. You can dual wield pistols, 

 the sawed off shotgun, Uzi, and Tek. 

 

 

 Get automatic fire with any weapon: 

 ———————————– 

 In two player mode, enable any weapon code one time. Waste all the 

 ammunition in your SMG gun. Then, hold the weapon you want to have 

 automatic fire (Desert Eagle recommended). Get in the passenger side 

 of a car while the other player drives. While holding the Desert Eagle 

 in the car, enable the same weapon code again. You can now shoot the 

 gun automatically.

 —————————– 

 If you fire a gun out of a car in two player mode with no ammunition, 

 it will still fire but no bullets will actually be shot out. 

 

 

 Suicide bomber: 

 ————— 

 Enable the“Weapons (tier 3)”code, then select the bombs which are 

 blown up by a detonator. Throw one of them at someone, and it should

 Escape police in Los Santos: 

 —————————- 

 Walk behind the Mullholland safe house to the pool. Face the side 

 that has five windows. Walk into the one closest to the corner. Go 

 to the area of that window that is away from the corner. Slowly go 

 in there and lean to the right. Unless you go too slow and lead an 

 officer in there, you will be safe. The police can see you, but 

 cannot hurt you, even when you have the maximum amount of stars on 

 your wanted meter. 

 

 

 Devoted bodyguard: 

 —————— 

 Start two player mode and get on a skyscraper. Have one player on 

 the edge of the building and the other player directly behind him. 

 Have the player on the edge jump off, and immediately afterwards 

 have the other in the same spot jump off. As soon as one player lands, 

 the second one will follow and land on him. You will now notice that 

 the second player will have almost full health, using the first player 

 as a cushion. 

 

 

 Scared cops: 

 ———— 

 Go into a Burger Shot restaurant and kill everyone. Then, leave and 

 immediately go back in. Kill everyone until you have four stars on 

 your wanted meter. Cops will enter the shop. If you start shooting, 

 all the cops will act like the people in the shop, and curl up scared. 

 The cops will not shoot you. If you kill them, more will just keep 

 appearing in the same locations. 

 

 

 Cops spawn in club: 

 ——————- 

 Get a three star level level while in a club. Three or four cops will 

 appear and start shooting.

 for you, kill all guards and be done. 

 

 

 Very large stunt bonus in Los Santos: 

 ————————————- 

 Get a BMX and ride it to the most northern safe house in the Mulholland 

 area near the Vinewood sign. Note: If you are interested in buying it, 

 the cost is $120,000. Notice that the building is in a“L”shape. Go to 

 the inner corner of the“L”, next to the pool. Ride into the walls and 

 you will fall through one of them. You will go into a glitched area. 

 Perform lots of rotations before you land back near the safe house to 

 get an extreme stunt bonus. 

 

 

 Make the moon bigger and smaller: 

 ——————————— 

 Using the sniper rifle, shoot the moon at night. It will begin to shrink. 

 After it gets to a certain size, it will begin to grow again. 

 

 

 Survive high falls: 

 ——————- 

 Max out your health bar and get full armor. Go to a high building, such 

 as the one in the Downtown area of Los Santos. Get on the roof and jump 

 off without a parachute in your inventory. When you hit the ground, you 

 will lose most of your life, but still have a small amount remaining. 

 Note: If you have a parachute in your inventory, you will die when you 

 hit the ground. 

 

 If you accidentally fall off a very high building, enable the“Spawn 

 parachute”code. Open the parachute and you will drift safely down to 

 the ground. 

 

 

 Drive around with parachute: 

 —————————- 

 Go to the top of Mt. Chiliad with a parachute. If you cannot find 

 one, there is one on top of the mountain near a Camper and a Journey. 

 Equip your parachute and jump on the mountain bike. You should trigger 

 the downhill race. Then, jump off the edge with the bike, but before 

 you jump off and deploy your parachute. You should spawn back on top 

 with the bike, but with your parachute still deployed. 

 

 

 Helicopter in garage in San Fierro: 

 ———————————– 

 Occasionally at the helipad that is guarded with a police garage not 

 far from it, if you go into the garage when the helicopter is present, 

 you will find another helicopter at the bottom floor of the garage. 

 

 

 Chopper does not chop: 

 ———————- 

 Shoot some people and/or police to get a least a three start wanted 

 level. Then, enable the“Spawn Jetpack”code and fly up. Wait for a 

 helicopter to arrive. When it does, try to land on top of it. When 

 you do, the blades will not chop you up. 

 

 

 Backflipping Packer: 

 ——————- 

 Get a Monster truck and drive down by the docks in Los Santos until 

 you see a Packer. Line up the Monster with the back end of the Packer 

 and drive up the ramp. This should send the Packer up in the air and 

 do backflips. 

 

 

 Somersaulting Rhino: 

 ——————– 

 Go to Los Santos International Airport, and use the“Spawn Jetpack” 

 code to reach the top of the communications tower. Once on the top, 

 there is a small circular platform with a thin platform around it, 

 with just enough room to stand on. Stand on it, and make sure it is 

 the border around the very top platform. Enable the“Spawn Rhino tank” 

 code. If done correctly, the tank will spawn and immediately ricochet 

 off the top and do multiple spins and somersaults in the air before 

 finally hitting the ground below. This can be very funny if done 

 correctly. 

 

 

 Gang members in house: 

 ———————- 

 Make a gang, with however many members as desired. Then, go inside 

 your house and press Up to call for your gang to follow. They cannot 

 go inside the house. Save the game. When you are done, they will be 

 standing in the kitchen. You can shoot them, punch them, or walk 

 through them with nothing happening to them. They will talk to you, 

 but they do not move and nothing hurts them. 

 

 

 Invincible zombie: 

 —————— 

 Find a cab driving around with a passenger. Note: This may also work with other 

 cars and your gang members. Take the car and drive it into water (best done at 

 the Glen Park area in Los Santos). Get out of the car as it is driving into the 

 water and go ashore, so you can see the passenger trying to swim. After a short 

 while he or she will be dead, still are trying to swim. Aim at the person and 

 the target will appear black, indicating that the person is dead. Fire at the 

 car’s gas tank to make it explode and send the person flying ashore. They will 

 now run around for awhile, then act like a normal person. However, they will be 

 invincible and will still be targeted black. 

 

 

 Zombie homies: 

 ————– 

 Wield a knife (tier 2 weapon), and walk up behind one of your fellow gang members. 

 Target him and press Up to recruit him into your posse. Before he can turn around, 

 cut his throat. Note that after you do so, he will fall to the ground quite 

 differently than the other members of the population. As soon as he hits the ground, 

 he will rise back up“from the dead”. 

 

 

 Moving fire: 

 ———— 

 Notice that when you use your flamethrower and are aimed at the floor, you create 

 a small flame or a few that expire in awhile. When they begin to arise, the fire 

 truck arrives and extinguishes the fire. To do this glitch, eat something beforehand 

 to prevent hunger. This may take some time. Do a fire line with your flamethrower of 

 at least four flames horizontally with no cops nearby (or they begin to chase you). 

 Keep watching the fire, centering by using the camera view, trying not to move CJ 

 nly if necessary. If the fire truck arrives to extinguish the fire, repeat this until 

 you get a whirlwind of fire of a decent size. When you get it, it cannot be 

 extinguished. If you keep it centered with the camera view and watch, after awhile 

 the fire truck leaves the fire alone. The fire physics are strange, but if you move 

 Right slowly and walk just a little bit, you can aim the fire. Keep doing this and 

 you can move it in a certain direction. Do not worry if the flames are close to you, 

 they do not cause damage until you move CJ to the flames. If there are pedestrians 

 walking to the flames ,they will not suffer any damage, even though they do not 

 runaway. However, vehicles can take damage. To make them explode they must be stopped 

 for a certain period of time. Try it on traffic lights or when another vehicle is 

 blocking the path. This is particularly useful on highways where cars travel at high 

 speed. There are multiple wrecks and you can wait to watch them all explode. 

 You will not get a wanted level for doing this. 

 

 

 Wear night vision goggles without their effect: 

 ———————————————– 

 Activate the night vision goggles and play any type of arcade game (They Came From 

 Uranus, etc.). When you exit the arcade game, CJ will still be wearing the goggles, 

 but their effect is not there. 

 

 

 Remote explosives go through door: 

 ———————————- 

 Buy some remote explosives at Ammu-Nation, then steal a car. Get out of the car and 

 throw one at the drivers door, then open the door. The explosive will stay in the 

 same place, and the door will go through it. 

 

 

 No explosion: 

 ————- 

 Go into Ammu-Nation. There will be a red circle to go into shooting practice. Get 

 close to that circle, then throw over twenty remote explosives at that door. Without 

 pressing the remote, step in the red circle. You will go to the target practice. 

 Complete round 1, then quit. When your out of target practice, notice there are no 

 explosives by the door, but you still have the remote. Press the remote. and there 

 will be no explosion. 

 

 

 Fall through ground in Flint County: 

 ———————————— 

 Go to Flint County. There should be a road to follow. Drive on it, and you will see 

 a wall that leads off the to the side. If you drive up and down that wall, you should 

 fall through the ground. You may have to do it a few times. You must hug the wall 

 for this glitch to occur. Additionally, go to your safe house in Prickle Pine. Enable 

 the“CJ jumps higher”code. Enter the safe house. Turn towards the entrance and jump 

 up. You should go over the wall and fall into blackness until you land in a field of 

 grey. In front of you should be an incomplete version of the are where you saved 

 Denise. Buildings will be missing, but you can physically touch them. You should 

 also see white letters that read“Ganton”,“North Rock”, and“Downtown”. Stand in 

 front of it and mark the Four Dragons Casino. Then, enable the“Spawn Jetpack” 

 code and fly it toward the casino. You should eventually see an armor pickup, a 

 uzi pickup, a pistol pickup, and a money pickup that contains $15,000 at most. You 

 should also see four white doors, but they have the wall physics around them. 

 

 

 Walk or drive underwater in Flint County: 

 —————————————– 

 Go to the bottom of the water at the end of the island in Flint county. Enable the 

 “Maximum lung capacity”code, then swim down to where you see two rocks and a large 

 starfish. Swim behind the biggest rock. Sooner or later, you will be able to walk 

 on the bottom of the ocean. You can spawn vehicles and fire weapons. 

 Note: Do not get out of the water or try to fly a plane or you will have to do this 

 all over. Also, if you go too close to shore or out too far, you will respawn on 

 the nearest island. This glitch may take a lot of time to do and requires patience. 

 

 

 Invisible spray paint in Los Santos: 

 ———————————— 

 When in CJ’s home, get the spray paint can from his bedroom. Go to his lobby and 

 spray in front off his mirror at a certain distance. You will not see the spray

 ————————– 

 Have a gun capable of doing drive-bys and go on a date with Denise riding in a 

 motorcycle. If she asks if you want some“coffee”, say“Yes”. When you are done and 

 get back on your bike, you will not have the gun out. This will fix itself when you 

 get off the bike. 

 

 

 Fall through ground in Los Santos: 

 ———————————- 

 There is a property to buy directly above Madd Dogg’s mansion in the Mullholland 

 area. You do not have to have buy it; just go there. In the back is a waterless 

 pool and a wall on the east side. Walk up against it and you will fall through an 

 invisible wall and continue falling until you reappear back on the ground. You can 

 use the Jetpack to fly around in blue hell. 

 

 Go to the building where the mission“End Of The Line”took place, where you killed 

 Big Smoke. Note: This will not work after you complete the mission—you should be 

 playing a new file to do this. Get a car and ram the wall in the front. You should 

 either break the wall and go through or break the wall and get pushed back from the 

 impact. Then, drive in and you will fall through the ground and end up back on the 

 street. Sometimes your car will disappear when you get put back on the street. If 

 you walk in, you will fall but when you are put back on the street you will not 

 lose any health. 

 

 Go to the Ganton gym and park a car in the doorway, with the hood touching the door. 

 Get out, jump on the hood, and walk inside. Once inside, walk back out again. You 

 will appear in a hallway. Walk towards the wall, and you will fall through the world. 

 

 Walk behind the Mullholland safe house to the pool. Face the side that has five 

 windows. Walk into the one closest to the corner. If you do not automatically fall, 

 walk to where the iron support beams end. You will start falling. In a few seconds 

 you will land around the billboard that is in front of the Vinewood sign.

 ——————————– 

 Enable the“Pedestrians riot”and“Pedestrians have weapons”codes. Enter the dance 

 club and start the dance challenge. During the dance, a pedestrian may have a rocket 

 launcher and start shooting. More people will come in and watch you dance. If the 

 pedestrians are too close, then you will be inflicted with damage from the rocket 

 launcher. If your damage has passed the point of making you wasted, when the dance 

 is over the message will appear stating that you can dance to a harder track. After 

 the message disappears, C.J. will drop to the floor dead. 

 

 

 Late death in Los Santos: 

 ————————- 

 Go to the police station (where there is a toll gate with a policeman standing next 

 to it). Hijack any police vehicle. Note: If you hijack a car or do a crime in that 

 area, this will not work. Then, go in front of the gate and wait for him to open it. 

 Once he does, go inside and go straight. Stay in your vehicle. Park next to the 

 garage door then get out of your vehicle. Once out, go next to the building and 

 your will see another booth next to the building. Go inside and kill the guard. 

 Then, kill the booth man next to the gate. Once this is done, go in the garage 

 through the fire exit. Then, go next to a policeman so that he points his gun at 

 you. He should say that he needs backup into his radio. Kill him with a gun. If 

 done correctly, he should be dead, but still standing. Once he gets off the radio, 

 he should fall down and die. 

 

 

 Fall through map in Red County: 

 ——————————- 

 Get a police bike, and go to the section of the tracks that leads to Red County if 

 you keep driving. Keep moving your bike against the right side so that it sparks 

 severely, but does not crash. After about 30 seconds, you should fall through the 

 map. The bike will fall and disappear, and CJ will appear somewhere on the map 

 randomly. 

 

 

 Walk through wall in Red County: 

 ——————————– 

 When you are by your house on the hills directly behind the“Vinewood”sign, go 

 behind the house where the pool is located. Walk over to the wall and go straight, 

 where another wall meets that wall. You will be able to walk through the wall, and 

 if you walk in the correcl location, you will fall and the“Loading”message will 

 appear. The game will place you on a road below the“Vinewood”sign. 

 

 

 Hospital underworld gateway in San Fierro: 

 —————————————— 

 Go to San Fierro’s hospital. There are two different buildings that are connected 

 by a walkway that is over the road. Go towards the western building (hospital) were 

 the cane is located. (where you get dropped off when you visit the hospital). To 

 your left should be an ambulance. Go towards the ambulance, and face the east 

 building“across the road”. As you look across the road, you will see doors and a 

 part of the building (hospital) that sticks out. Fly between the doors and the part 

 of the building that is sticking out to reach the gateway to get in the hospital 

 underworld. To get back to the real world, sink down to the endless pit. CJ will 

 respawn at the closest street. You can also fly though the opening of the hospital 

 where you first entered the underworld. 

 

 

 Climb a 100 ft. tree in Whetstone: 

 ———————————- 

 Located in the Back O Beyond area is a tree that is leaning over a swamp. CJ can 

 walk up the tree. Note: If you fall off, make sure you have completed the Paramedic 

 missions so that you do not die.

 Your pedestrians will bail out of the ambulance. 

 

 

 Walk on air: 

 ———— 

 When in a helicopter, fly above the giant bridge and try to land in the middle. The 

 helicopter will land in mid air, and you can get out and walk around in the air.

 ———– 

 Note: This cannot be done if you completed all the missions in San Fierro. Spawn a 

 plane and a parachute. Fly north of San Fierro. Go over the bridge and to the land. 

 Then, go back and jump out and land on the thing with a parachute. Get that parachute 

 and jump towards San Fierro. Activate the parachute and CJ will die in the air. 

 

 

 Run underwater: 

 ————— 

 Start two player mode and get in a Leviathan helicopter. Land in the ocean. Have 

 the player in the passenger side hijack the driver. He will fall straight into the 

 ocean and be able to just walk around and shoot instead of swim. 

 

 

 Swim in first person view: 

 ————————– 

 Get a rocket launcher or sniper rifle and go near a body of water. Jump in, and

 Floating guns in Wrong Side Of The Tracks mission: 

 ————————————————– 

 There are four Latino gang members on top of the train that you have must catch 

 and kill. They have guns that they will shoot you with. Fail the mission inten- 

 tionally, then find the train that they where on. Instead of gang members, you 

 will see instead see floating guns that move and fire at you; they are invincible. 

 

 

 Flying fish: 

 ———— 

 Get a rocket or grenade launcher and go near a river or beach with fish. Shoot 

 the fish with a rocket or grenade. The fish will fly out of the water and swim 

 around in mid air. 

 

 Go to any beach area. Swim a little bit underwater to find a school of fish, 

 dolphin, or turtle in the shallow parts. Get back to the beach where you are 

 neck deep in the water, but still able to use a weapon. Aim the rocket launcher 

 in the part of water where you last saw the aforementioned aquatic life. Fire

 the wall beside the house and jump on the roof. You can go through the windows. 

 You can see your garage, shoot people through the window, and if you get a wanted 

 level of 2 or more, can get policemen trapped in your garage. Be careful; when 

 you jump through the window and want to get out you must step back from the 

 window and jump until you can cling onto it, then climb back up. 

 

 

 Wrong casino name in Las Venturas: 

 ———————————- 

 Check the map that was included with the game. Look in Las Venturas near the 

 casino entitled“The Clown’s Pocket.”This casino cannot be found, because it 

 is named“The Ringmaster”on this map. However, in the game it is called“The 

 Clown’s Pocket.” 

 

 

 CJ spontaneously combusts in Whetstone: 

 ————————————— 

 Go to the level area of ground at the peak of Mt. Chiliad, where the mountain 

 bike race is located. Take out a rocket launcher. Aim at the Mountain Bike. The 

 green reticule will home in on the bike. Fire at the bike and blow it up. Then, 

 aim at the bike again, manually. Note: The second time around, the reticule will 

 not automatically aim on the“wreckage”of the bike. When you fire a second 

 missile at the bike, CJ will catch fire. You can be 30 feet away and still catch 

 fire. Also, the same effect has occurs when firing a missile at the bike to 

 “blow it up”, then shooting it with a sniper rifle. However when using the rifle 

 it will usually require two or three rounds before CJ catches on fire. 

 

 

 Feet appear through bottom of car: 

 ———————————- 

 Enter a car and enable the“Spawn Jetpack”code. Your feet will appear through 

 the bottom of the car. This also works with planes and helicopters. With bikes, 

 CJ will appear to be standing up on the bike. 

 

 

 Bicycle catches on fire: 

 ———————— 

 If a bicycle is upside down, it will catch on fire. However, it is very difficult 

 to get bicycle to stay upside down. 

 

 

 Lowrider remains in position: 

 —————————– 

 Get a lowrider with hydraulics. Put the car in any hydraulic position desired. 

 While holding the car in that direction, get out. You can see the car remain 

 that way. For example, have the back of the car raised in the air. 

 

 

 Lowrider lights: 

 —————- 

 When in a lowrider at night, look at the headlights and bounce the car up and 

 down. Notice that the lights on the ground stay in one location while the lights 

 on the car move up and down. 

 

 

 Buy hotdogs from dead vendor in Los Santos: 

 ——————————————- 

 Go to the end of the pier with a Ferris wheel. Enable the“Weapons”code and 

 obtain a rocket launcher. Find the hot dog stand at the far end. Shoot it with 

 a rocket launcher. Jump in the water under the pier, and you should see the 

 stand floating in the water. You can still buy hotdogs, even the vendor is dead. 

 

 

 Wrong restaurant name: 

 ———————- 

 Go to the Cluckin’Bell. Take out a sniper rifle and look at the cups hanging 

 on the wall. They say“Burger Shot”. 

 

 

 Wrong dialogue in Los Santos: 

 —————————– 

 During the Reuniting The Families mission, the police helicopter announces that 

 they are the“Los Angeles Police Department”instead of the“Los Santos Police 

 Department”. 

 

 

 Camera in Los Santos: 

 ——————— 

 Go in CJ’s bedroom. There will be a camera beside the bed. Also, once you complete 

 a certain mission, there will also be a can of spray paint in there. 

 

 

 Reaching other cities early: 

 —————————- 

 Hijack the train. The easiest way to do this is when it is at one of the stations. 

 Then, drive it full speed to the bridges to the other islands. You may need to use 

 the entire city to pick up enough speed. Also, you must be careful around sharp 

 turns. The train will de-rail. Note: This was done with the freight train. When 

 you approach the bridge at the edge of the city, you will slow down, even if you 

 are going very fast. The train will pass through the barricade, as if it were a 

 ghost. You will get a four star wanted level. There is a police bribe on the train 

 tracks in the second city that you will pick up if you pass by it on the train, but 

 your wanted level will immediately jump back to four stars. Also, the train is 

 bullet proof. You cannot die from bullets when inside the train. 

 

 When in Los Santos, you will find that all bridges to the other two regions will 

 be blocked by blockades. Sometimes if you try to go through the blockade at high 

 speed with a fast vehicle, it will go through and glitch, along with the AI 

 vehicles that are following. 

 

 Enable the“Wanted level never increases”and“Flying car”codes. You can now go 

 to all of San Andreas without the four star wanted level appearing. 

 Note: This must be done again every time you load a saved game. Also, if you 

 shoot cops with the“Wanted level never increases”code enabled, some cops will 

 get out and walk away but others will fire their guns at you. 

 

 The following is a multi-step process which may take some time to get correct. 

 Get the parachute located on top of the very tall building a few blocks from 

 the police station in downtown Los Santos. The building is shaped circular 

 inside and“L”shaped on your map. Walk around to the northeast corner of the 

 circular building and step into the yellow triangle to get the parachute that 

 is on the roof. Take it, and keep it (do not switch to a weapon). Go back 

 down and get armor from the police station. It is nearby and has two sets. 

 Do not draw a weapon in the station or you will get a two star wanted level. 

 Next, get the jet at LSX, the airport at Los Santos. Drive up to the gate, 

 climb up on your car, and onto the guard booth, and climb over into the airport. 

 Walk back around to the gate. It will open, and you can get your car and drive 

 back in. Then, find the jet. It is called the Shamal and is located at the end 

 of the runway. Take off and get some practice flying, diving, climbing, rolling, 

 etc. Next, choose a location on your map that you want to go. You can use the 

 map screen to pin that location on the radar. For example, choose the Binco 

 store in Las Venturas. It is next to the Las Venturas airport and the highway. 

 Once you pass the city line, you will get four stars on your wanted meter. 

 Because you are in the air, they will try to shoot you down with missiles. 

 Notice the two red blips on your radar that are fast approaching. Dive, climb, 

 and roll and the missiles will miss. Do not forget to keep your eye on your 

 target. Once you are over your target and are very high, exit the plane. You 

 will drop straight down. You must be high enough for your parachute to open 

 or you die when you hit the ground. When you are safely on the ground, start 

 running. If you chose to go to Binco or another store, notice that you can go 

 inside and buy clothes. If you buy clothes, you will get rid of the four stars 

 wanted level, as long as you remain in the store. Once you step outside, the 

 four stars will return to your wanted meter. 

 

 

 Reach other cities early in Los Santos: 

 ————————————— 

 Use the following trick to get to the other cities before their freeway 

 entrances are actually open. Go to any bridge that connects the start of 

 city of Los Santos to any of the closed cities. Jump into the water that is 

 under that bridge and swim across. When you get far enough, you will have a 

 four star wanted rating. Once you get on land, get a vehicle as soon as 

 possible. Note: You cannot use bribe icons or the Pay N’Spray to decrease 

 this wanted rating. 

 

 

 Fly plane without pilot license: 

 ——————————– 

 Go to either Los Santos or Las Vatos airport. Go to the place that you 

 would enter if you had a pilot license. If you try to get in the gate, 

 it will say you cannot unless you have the license. Next to the gate is 

 a small building. You will need a small car or any type of bike (BMX, 

 bike, motorcycles, etc.). Stand on top of it and jump on top of the 

 building. Jump off and you should see a fence (at Los Santos Airport). 

 Climb the fence and you will see a Dodo plane. Also, if you follow the 

 runway east, you will see a small jet that is unlocked. At Las Vatos, 

 follow the same procedure. After you jump off of the building, just walk 

 around and look for a plane. Note: All but one of the aircraft at San 

 Fereno’s airport are locked. 

 

 After using the“Fly plane without pilot license”trick at the Los 

 Santos airport, go forward you should see a Dodo airplane. Get in and 

 take a right when inside the plane. Go straight, then take a right at 

 the runway. Go down it until you see a jet on the right. It is not on 

 the runway. You can get out of the Dodo and get in the jet. You can now 

 fly the jet wherever desired. However, be careful—if you go out of 

 your territory you will get four stars and jets will shoot missiles at 

 you. Try to dodge them if possible. 

 

 Go to the Los Santos airport and get to the place that you would enter 

 if you had a pilot license. If you try to get in the gate, it will say 

 you cannot unless you have the license. Next to the gate is a small 

 building. You will need a small car or any type of bike (BMX, bike, 

 motorcycles, etc.). Stand on top of it and jump on top of the building. 

 After you jump off of the building, just walk around and look for a plane. 

 

 To get into the Los Santos airport without a pilots license go all the 

 way south until you reach a tunnel. On the south side of the tunnel, 

 look along the fence line of the airport. Notice how the sidewalk has 

 an incline. Walk up the incline and climb up the ledge where the bottom 

 of the fence starts. Turn towards the ramp sign and jump across. You 

 should grab onto the sign. Then, climb up on top of it, turn towards the 

 fence, and jump. You should jump across and grab the fence. CJ will pull 

 himself up and over, and you will be in the airport. 

 

 To access Los Santos International airport early, get a large van and 

 hop over the fence where the guard tells you that you need a pilots 

 license. You can also get any car and hop over the fence around the 

 corner from the guard. Once inside, you will have to hop another fence, 

 then you will find a Dodo. If you go a little further inside near the 

 runway, you will find a jet. 

 

 Go to either the Los Santos airport and get to the place that you would 

 enter if you had a pilot license. If you try to get in the gate, it will 

 say you cannot unless you have the license. Next to the gate is a small 

 building. You will need a small car or any type of bike (BMX, bike, 

 motorcycles, etc.). Stand on top of it and jump on top of the building. 

 After you jump off of the building, just walk around and look for a plane. 

 

 Walk up to the airport gate in San Fierro, touching it. Then, walk along 

 the side of the gate into the corner were the fence bends (keeping in 

 contact with the gate) and walk back into the middle of the gate. It will 

 slide open. You must start in the middle and walk to whichever side the 

 gate will slide open to. For example, if the gates on the left, walk to 

 the left. If it does not work at first, keep trying. 

 

 

 Parachute in Los Santos: 

 ———————— 

 In the Downtown area (near the three way highway section and the red 

 line where the train is passing on your map), you will see a tall 

 circular building with blue/white glass windows. The entrance (with the 

 yellow triangle) is just in the front of it. Enter it, and you will go 

 to the roof of the building where you can find a parachute. Take it, 

 jump down from the roof, and open the parachute. Use Left to control it. 

 Note: You must wait a short time until the parachute respawns back on 

 the roof. 

 

 

 Parachute in San Fierro: 

 ———————— 

 Go to the Downtown area. Find the very big building. Out front, there a 

 sign that reads“No base jumping”. Go to the yellow triangle and you will 

 go to the top. You will automatically get a parachute. This jump lets you 

 fall a long way before opening the parachute. Note: You can only jump once, 

 unless you die. 

 

 After you unlock Mt. Chiliad in the Whetstone area, take a Sanchez to the 

 top of the mountain. Once at the very top, look for a mobile home, and a 

 van. Behind them is a parachute. Pick it up, then look for the ramp by 

 the flag. Driver very fast and jump off. After a few seconds in the air, 

 jump off the bike, then deploy your parachute, or you can wait to do some 

 free falling. You can also jump off of some high buildings, and out of 

 airplanes. 

 

 There is another parachute on the top of the mountain (by the two vehicles). 

 You can fly the Dodo up there, take off, and jump out of the plane whenever 

 you desire. Then, open the parachute. By the time you get back to the 

 mountain, another parachute will have respawned. Note: Sometimes when you 

 jump out of the plane, it will not explode, even from that altitude. 

 

 Unless you have a license, do the“Fly plane without pilot license”trick 

 to get a plane or helicopter early. Fly to the top of Mt. Chiliad. On the 

 east side where campers are parked, there will be rocks. There should be 

 a parachute on those rocks. 

 

 If you ride to the top of Mt. Chiliad, you will find yet another parachute 

 location as well as a Bmx bike race marathon as well as a speed ramp which 

 you can use to fly of the mountain if desired. 

 

 Use the Jetpack to reach the very top of the northernmost tower of the 

 bridge leading from San Fierro to Tierra Robada to find a parachute to 

 skydive with. 

 

 

 Skydiving: 

 ———- 

 Go to any airport. Look for a yellow arrow at the entrances of the airport 

 where you can buy a ticket to another city. Buy the ticket and start the 

 flight. Do not skip the flight. Wait for the airplane to take off and get 

 high in the air. Jump out of the airplane with a parachute and begin 

 skydiving. Open the parachute when you want and float down. There are also 

 other places you can skydive, such as the tall building in the Downtown 

 area of Los Santos, and off the top of Mt. Chiliad. Additionally, to get 

 a parachute very easily, get into any type of flying vehicle, except the 

 Jetpack. You will instantly receive a parachute. If you fly high into the 

 air, then jump out of your plane or helicopter, the parachute will 

 automatically be switched into your weapon inventory. 

 

 

 Skydive longer: 

 ————— 

 Enable the“Cars fly away”code. Go to any airport and hit any aircraft. 

 Then, enter that craft. All you have to do is steer. Soon the height meter 

 will just stay up. You will get to fly higher than normal when you do this. 

 Fly as high as you desired, then Jump out for a long trip back to earth. 

 

 

 Easy money in San Fierro: 

 ————————- 

 Do the valet side-quest missions. You will be awarded a $ spot, where 

 periodically you can claim free money. 

 

 

 Hippy Shopper asset in San Fierro:

 Ammu-Nation. Complete level 4 of deliveries to get the store as an asset, 

 where you can collect money. 

 

 

 Valet Parking asset in San Fierro: 

 ———————————- 

 After the 555 We Tip mission, you can do valet parking missions at the 

 parking garage. You will be awarded a $ spot after level 5 of valet parking, 

 where periodically you can claim free money. 

 

 

 Zero’s RC Shop asset in San Fierro: 

 ———————————– 

 After recruiting Zero, stop at his shop and complete all his missions. 

 You will be awarded with a $ spot where you can periodically claim free 

 money. Note: You can also make more money at Zero’s place by doing an 

 extra mission (after you have already completed all the missions to get 

 the shop as an asset). Go to the back room in the shop and step into the 

 red marker to trigger a mission where you use the RC Baron to destroy 

 Berkely’s shipping vans. For each van you destroy, you will get money. 

 There is a time limit for each time you play the mission. You can replay 

 this mission as many times as desired. 

 

 

 Bomb valet parking in San Fierro: 

 ——————————— 

 Go to the valet parking hotel without your uniform and stand next to 

 the valets. When a vehicle drives up, enable the“Weapons (tier 3)” 

 code and plant a bomb on the car that is about to be parked . When 

 the valet enters the vehicle, do not use the remote. Do it as soon as 

 he reaches the parking garage. The car and the valet are toast. 

 

 

 Stealing from valet parking in San Fierro: 

 —————————————— 

 Go to the valet parking hotel without your uniform. Stand next to the 

 valets. When a car drives up, quickly get in and drive off slowly. 

 The valet will begin to chase you . If he is very close to the car, 

 get out, and let him get in . As soon as he does that, quickly pull 

 him out and he will say“I am parking a car here”. As soon as he says 

 that, get back into the car and drive off. The valet will not chase 

 you anymore. 

 

 

 Military vehicles in San Fierro: 

 ——————————– 

 Near the port in San Fierro there will be a naval base. If you quickly 

 enter the compound and drive around, you will eventually find a 

 military truck and Patriot vehicle. Note: Once you enter the compound 

 of the naval base, you will get a five star wanted level. 

 

 

 Baseball bat in San Fierro: 

 ————————— 

 You can find a baseball bat at the baseball diamond in San Fierro 

 at home plate, across the street from Zero’s RC Shop. 

 

 

 Chain gun in San Fierro: 

 ———————— 

 There is a chain gun on Point Kinclad (big red train tracks in San 

 Fierro). Take a helicopter or the Jetpack and fly onto the first arch 

 leaving San Fierro to go to Las Venturas to find it. 

 

 

 Flamethrower and pool stick in San Fierro: 

 —————————————— 

 In the Doherty area, go behind your garage to find a construction area 

 (marked brown on the map). Go to the building just left of the road on 

 the brown area. Under a broken ramp is a flamethrower and pool stick. 

 

 

 Guided rocket launcher in San Fierro: 

 ————————————- 

 Go to the airport and from where the two helicopters spawn, go to 

 the left. There will be two little buildings near the water. To the 

 right of one of them will be propane tanks. In between two of them 

 will be a lock on rocket launcher. 

 

 

 Shooting gallery in San Fierro: 

 ——————————- 

 Go to your gas station safe house. Find the trolley tracks (not the 

 train tracks) in the middle of the road in front of the safe house. 

 Enable the“Spawn Jetpack”code and wait for the trolley to pass by. 

 Once it does, fly into the air and land on top of it. Then, take off 

 your Jetpack. Enable any“Weapons”code and start killing pedestrians. 

 Once the cops start chasing you, you will notice that when they try 

 to ram you, the trolley will not get damaged, and is actually invincible. 

 You will be able to drive through the town and use it like a giant 

 shooting gallery. There is no need to worry if the military starts 

 chasing you. The trolley car can ram right through the tanks, sometimes 

 flipping them over. If your health gets low (you can still be shot by 

 pedestrian cops), enable the“Health, armor, and money”code. This 

 trick allows you to live a surprisingly long time while being hunted 

 down by the feds. To enhance your experience, you can also enable the 

 “Pedestrians riot”,“Pedestrians with guns”,“Aggressive traffic”and 

 “Lower wanted level”codes, then relax and watch the havoc unfold 

 around you all from the safety and comfort of a big red trolley car. 

 

 

 Fling Bulldozer around in San Fierro: 

 ————————————- 

 Go to the construction yard near San Fierro. Go past the crane and 

 turn left after the first hangar. Behind that, you will see a towtruck, 

 Get in and drive towards the Bulldozer. Hook up the Bull Dozer. Drive 

 up the hill to where there is an open area. Then, turn very sharp to 

 either the left or the right. The Bulldozer will fling around, pulling 

 the tow truck with it. For even more fun, get three or more tow trucks 

 and hook them all up into a line. With three or more, the Bulldozer 

 acts like a ball and chain flailing around. 

 

 

 Fall off building and live in San Fierro: 

 —————————————– 

 Go to the Big Pointy Building (the one with a parachute) in the 

 Downtown area and jump off. Open your parachute and land. Go back 

 up to the top. This time, you will not get a parachute. Jump off. 

 Before you hit the ground, you will hit the side of the building 

 and slide down. When you are close to the ground, you should hit 

 one of the many slanted poles that hold up the building. This will 

 slow you down enough so that you only lose about one sixth of your 

 health. Note: Sometimes you will not hit a slanted pole and lose 

 more health or die. 

 

 

 Gant Bridge message in San Fierro: 

 ———————————- 

 Note: This works best if you unlocked the Jet Pack or an expert at 

 landing helicopters. Go to the Gant Bridge and fly up to the very 

 top. Go the very top cable line piece that is horizontal, is south 

 on the Gant Bridge, and is the closest to San Fierro. Fly up to the 

 very top and look at the cable that is vertical to see a sign that 

 reads“There are no Easter Eggs up here. Go Away”. 

 

 

 Easy money in Las Venturas: 

 ————————— 

 Go to the strip club. Stand in front of one of the dancers and wait 

 until somebody throws money at them. CJ will automatically pick it 

 up and say a comment as in“How thoughtful”. Leave the game like this 

 for about an hour or two and your money should have increased 

 significantly by the time you return. 

 

 

 Burger Shot asset in Las Venturas: 

 ———————————- 

 Some of the Burger Shots have a timed delivery mission where you must 

 send packages on a Faggio. Complete them to gain that restaurant as 

 an asset. 

 

 

 Secret government agency base in Las Venturas: 

 ———————————————- 

 Get in any land or air vehicle and drive or fly to the abandoned 

 air field in the region of Las Venturas. To the south from here, 

 there is a little area that is a“no fly zone”. If flown over, a 

 mysterious five star wanted level will appear. This is because the 

 area is a government agency secret base that holds several heavy and 

 speedy army vehicles. You can also find this area in the middle part 

 of the region of Las Venturas on the map included with the game. 

 

 

 Tear gas in Las Venturas: 

 ————————- 

 Go to the AT 400′s hanger at the airport. There is a building with 

 cars nearby. You will see a can which looks like spray paint. When 

 you use it, C.J. does not choke. It is not very strong, but will choke 

 pedestrians. 

 

 

 Sex shop in mirror in Las Venturas: 

 ———————————– 

 In the tattoo parlor, kill the owner and pull out a camera. Zoom 

 in fully into the mirror. You will be able to see the sex shop across 

 the street. 

 

 

 Suicidal pedestrians in Las Venturas: 

 ————————————- 

 Find the gym in the Redsands East area. It is parallel to a bomb shop 

 called“Weddings&amp;Weldings”. There is an alley next to the shop. 

 Go into it and stand on the eastern wall of the bomb shop. Look in 

 the northeastern direction to see a tall white building. If you stand 

 in the correct location, you can see pedestrians spawning on the lower 

 roof and falling off. You can run up to a pedestrian after they have 

 fallen, but you cannot stand underneath the roof and wait for them to 

 fall on you; they only spawn from a certain distance. 

 

 

 Hunter Quarry asset in Bone County: 

 ———————————– 

 Successfully complete all seven quarry missions to get it as an asset, 

 where you can collect money. 

 

 

 Extra car storage space in Bone County: 

 ————————————— 

 Once you have purchased the abandoned airfield in the Verdtant Meadows 

 area, locate the massive garage directly opposite the house that is 

 there. It may not look like a garage as it is a hanger for airplanes, 

 but it is a perfect location to store a large number of cars. 

 

 

 Volcano effect in Bone County: 

 —————————— 

 Find the geyser in Bone County. Shoot a rocket at it and it will 

 turn into a volcano. 

 

 

 Area 69 in Bone County: 

 ———————– 

 Get in any land or air vehicle and drive or fly to the abandoned air 

 field in the region of Las Venturas. To the south from here, there 

 is a little area that is a“no fly zone”. If flown over, a mysterious 

 five star wanted level will appear. This is because the area is a 

 government agency secret base that holds several heavy and speedy 

 army vehicles. You can also find this area in the middle part of the 

 region of Las Venturas on the map included with the game. 

 

 Use the following trick to enter Area 69 without the law on you. 

 Find Barbara (a girl you can date) in a town north of San Fierro and 

 Tierra Robada. Start dating her. After you get your dating percent 

 up to 100%, you will receive a police uniform. Go to a safe house 

 and put it on. Get in a police car or Ranger police SUV (recommended). 

 You can now drive into the base and get several things, such as 

 different types of guns. You can also get a chopper called the 

 Cargobob. You can also get Patriots, Rhinos, and Hydra fighter jets. 

 

 

 Go underground in Area 69 in Bone County: 

 —————————————– 

 Do the underworld glitch (at the Vinewood safehouse head north from 

 Madd Dogg’s) and fly to Area 69. Find the underground complex. Find 

 the area where you get the Black Project, and you should see an empty 

 long hollow room next to it. It should have red boxes at the top of 

 the“silo”. Fly underneath the empty silo then fly to the top of the 

 silo. You should see a“cage”where the room is of the red boxes. 

 Try to take off your Jetpack. When you do, you should land in the 

 Black Project area or the rooms around there. Note: To do the underworld 

 glitch, find the safe house pool. Fly the Jetpack into the corner of 

 the safe house. Then, fly to Area 69. Also, bring weapons and armor 

 because the SAPD officers spawn down there. 

 

 

 Huge air in Bone County: 

 ———————— 

 Go to the Arco De Oste area with a fast car. Go up the mountain until 

 you see either a mine shaft or a wooden track. Follow the track back 

 to the mine shaft then turn around and follow the wood track until 

 you go off a jump. If done correctly, you should be able to clear 

 the Sherman Reservoir. 

 

 

 Machine Gun in Red County: 

 ————————– 

 Go to the town of Blueberry. Behind a wall is a machine gun. 

 

 

 Easy money in Whetstone: 

 ———————— 

 Go to the top of Mt. Chiliad and go behind the RVs. Pick up the 

 parachute and get on the mountain bike, which will start a challenge. 

 Go off the ramp to the right and get off of your bike in mid-air. 

 Pull the parachute and you will not hit the ground, but instead be 

 put back on the bike with the chute still open. You can keep going 

 off the ramp repeatedly to get as much money as desired. 

 

 Go to the top of Mt. Chiliad. There should be cars, a bike, and a 

 parachute. Get on the mountain bike and it will start a mission. 

 Instead of doing the mission, go forward and you should see a flag 

 with a ramp next to it. Get on the bike, go very fast, and jump off 

 the ramp. Once you are going down, the screen should blur. Do not 

 jump off the bike; just keep going and you should respawn back on 

 the mountain. You will get an insane jump bonus for about $300. 

 Repeat this to get as much money as desired. 

 

 

 Climb Mt. Chiliad faster in Whetstone: 

 ————————————– 

 Get a BMX bike and go to Mt. Chiliad. Ride up the mountain (not on the road). 

 Tap as hard as you can with the BMX bike, and you will be able to climb 

 the mountain faster. 

 

 

 Never fall off your bike in Whetstone: 

 ————————————– 

 Go to the top of Mt. Chiliad. Get the parachute and get on the mountain 

 bike at the correct time for the bicycle race challenge. Make sure that 

 the parachute is your current weapon before the race starts. When the 

 race begins, do not go through the checkpoints. There will be a ramp on 

 the left side with a flag beside it. Cycle there and jump off the mountain 

 with your bike as soon a s the race starts. When CJ is in the air with the 

 mountain bike, jump off the bike. Then while in the air, open your parachute. 

 You must do this quickly before CJ is put to the race track again. 

 However, once you open the parachute in the air, CJ will be put on the 

 race track again, with him riding a bike. However, this time you will 

 have a parachute opened while riding your BMX, and CJ will not be holding 

 the bike’s handlebars. He will instead be holding the parachute. You can 

 now go downhill at any angle and at any speed without falling off the bike. 

 Note: You must end the race to take your bike elsewhere. If you try to jump 

 off the cliff again while you have the parachute, you will appear on the 

 track without any parachute. Once you finish the race with your parachute 

 on you, you can go anywhere with it. You can enable the“Massive bunny 

 hops”code and jump as high as desired and land at any angle without falling. 

 Note: Make sure you do this before you get on the bike. Getting off your 

 bike will release the parachute; if you try to do any awkward stunts you 

 might fall. You will not fall unless you release the parachute. Get 

 off the bike to release the parachute. 

 

 

 Infinite nitrous: 

 —————– 

 Activate the nitrous in a car and put it inside your garage. While the 

 nitrous is still activated, shoot the car until it explodes, then allow 

 the garage door to close. When the door opens again, the nitrous will 

 always remain activated in that car. 

 

 

 Quick nitrous refill: 

 ——————— 

 Leave your car, then immediately re-enter it. Your nitrous will be back 

 at full. 

 

 

 Better handling motorcycle: 

 ————————— 

 To get better handling on street bikes, get on one and enable the“Spawn 

 Jetpack”code. You will be able to make turns at full speed without crashing. 

 Note: The Jetpack will disappear when you get off the bike. 

 

 

 Exceed garage limit: 

 ——————– 

 When you want to park a car in a garage but the game states that you cannot 

 store another vehicle, you drive the car near the garage and get out. Then, 

 hop in the car and drive in. 

 

 

 Finding your car after getting busted: 

 ————————————– 

 If you been arrested, go down to the police parking lot. Walk around without 

 a weapon. Eventually, you will find your car. 

 

 

 Stealing locked cars: 

 ——————— 

 Some cars have locked doors so you cannot steal them (such as cop cars and 

 your first girlfriend’s Hustler). However, getting them into a garage will 

 unlock the doors. You can either push a car into the garage or get a Tow 

 Truck or a Tractor to tow them. Additionally, to get in a locked vehicle 

 with someone inside (for example, a Combine Harvester), shoot the person 

 in the head and the door will fling open, allowing you drive it away. 

 

 Find a Tow Truck (for example, at the dump in Mt. Chiliad) and drive to 

 where the locked car is located. Hook the locked car onto the Tow Truck 

 and tow it into your garage. Let the garage close. When you open the 

 garage again, the locked car should be unlocked. This is easier then 

 pushing it into your garage. 

 

 If you try to open a car and it is locked, go far from it, then return. 

 The color of the car should be different and the doors should be unlocked. 

 

 If someone has locked their car doors, and you shoot them out, be careful 

 not to get out before you reach your garage. Otherwise, the doors will 

 stay locked. 

 

 

 Keep aircraft from races: 

 ————————- 

 Enter the races at the Las Venturas Airport. Select the race with the 

 airplane you desire, then ignore the race and instead take it back to your 

 airstrip and park it in your own big hangar. You will fail the mission, but 

 can re-do it. Once you get back to your airstrip and look in your hanger, 

 your airplane will be there. Save the game to keep it. 

 

 

 Recommended hydraulic cars: 

 —————————

 possible in the game. 

 

 Go to the northeastern part of the Las Venturas airport, where a huge 

 hanger with a green door is located. When you walk up to it, the door 

 will open downward to reveal an AT-400 airliner. When you see it, there 

 will be a platform to the left of the plane that you can go on. When you

 surrounding the base. You should now be able to fly out in the 

 chopper. Alternately, go to KACC Military Fuels at the top of 

 Las Venturas. Note: You need a Patriot to do this trick. If you 

 have done the mission for the Heist strand called Up, Up, and 

 Away, this is the location of KACC Military Fuels. Once there, 

 take your Patriot and drive through the front gates. No one is 

 there, and you will not get shot. Note: If it does not let you 

 through, take a ramp truck and put it near the gate. Then, run 

 up it and jump the fence. Once you are inside, get out of your 

 vehicle, go to your left, and go inside the hangar (round building) 

 and walk through to the other end. You will end up back outside. 

 Once you are outside in the back of the Military Fuels area, make 

 a right and run towards the stairs that you see. Walk up those 

 stairs, and when you get to the top, the Cargobob will be on the 

 heli-pad. Get in it without any stars or police after you. 

 To make this easier, just take a plane there and parachute out. 

 However, make sure to land on the helipad.

 there, but should spawn after awhile. It may take some time for it to spawn. It 

 will be locked, but you can open it by towing it to your garage with a tow truck. 

 

 

 Sweeper: 

 ——– 

 From the Xoomer Gas Station in Spinybed, go east on the road until you have to turn

 in the road then go on the road to the left. Immediately afterwards you can see a 

 lot on the left decorated with triangular banners and surrounded with a fence. This 

 is the Coutt and Shutz dealership. A Tampa will be in the lot, along with a Clover 

 and Perennial. If none of those cars are there, drive around and the cars will spawn 

 there. 

 

 

 Tow Truck: 

 ———- 

 Enter the ump at Mt. Chiliad to find a Tow Truck. You can steal cars with it by

 In the Breaking the Bank at Caligula’s mission, after you have the parachute 

 intentionally miss the helipad and instead aim for the ground. On the ground, almost

 to the airstrip. Park the Turismo in the garage and finish the mission. Alternately, 

 collect 20 vehicles for the Import/Export dock to get the Turismo. 

 

 

 Vortex: 

 ——- 

 Look in one of the buildings at the Panopticon area in Red County. On your map, it

 8-Track mission: 

 —————- 

 Enable the“Slow motion”code and you will be able to easily take first place. 

 This is helpful if you are trying to get the Monster Truck.

 “Destroy all cars”code repeatedly to pass the mission. 

 

 

 Are You Going To San Fierro? mission: 

 ————————————-

 shoot the crops; it will destroy them much easier. 

 

 

 Badlands mission: 

 —————– 

 Get to the mountain top and blow up the snitch’s car. He will jump off the side 

 of the mountain, committing suicide. Enable the“Spawn Jetpack”code and go down 

 there. Take a picture of him. Take the picture back to the drop point. By doing 

 this, you will not have to chase him back down the mountain on the dirtbike. 

 Additionally, enable the“Spawn Jetpack”code. Fly up the mountain, near the top 

 of the cabin. Do not let the guards see you. Choose the silenced pistol. Enter 

 through the back of the cabin and shoot the snitch. Be prepared to fight it out 

 with the FBI if you get caught. You can now snap a photo of the dead snitch 

 without chasing him. It is important to watch the guards’movement before 

 attempting this. 

 

 

 Beat The Cock mission: 

 ———————- 

 This is a triathlon. Go to Santa Maria beach in Los Santos and wait until 

 the weekend. Then, go to the lighthouse. You will see a little red marker 

 which will start the mission. Note: You must be in very good shape to win. 

 The reward is $10,000. Also, next to Palomino Creek is a beach that is part 

 of Fisher’s Lagoon. The one attached to that is part of Palomino Creek 

 (if you are looking on a map it is the second largest of them all, and 

 has a dock). Go to it. On there will be a red circle. Enter it to start 

 the mission. You should have full muscle and stamina because it is a 

 swimming race. If you have good stats, you will complete the mission. 

 

 

 Black Project mission: 

 ———————- 

 This mission starts after a number of Torino missions. Truth is upset 

 with you working with Torino. He abandons you on a road. You are getting 

 into Area 69 and must bring back the Black Project. You must go to the 

 control tower and open the blast doors. You have to avoid the searchlights, 

 but not shoot out more than two of them. You have thermal goggles to see 

 the guards. You must get in before 5:30 a.m. You will begin near body armor 

 if you do not have any. There are guards at mid-level on all of the light 

 towers, plus many that are walking around. Try sniping everybody so that 

 you are not spotted. If you do get spotted, you are told to use a vent to 

 get into the building. In any case, there is armor up on the control tower 

 to replenish with, and a red spot to use to open up the blast doors. 

 The blast doors are in the center of the mound. The vent is marked nearby 

 and you can shoot your way in through the grates. There is a health waiting 

 for you inside that room (with the blast doors on the other wall). 

 Go through the hallway and shoot the guards at the other end. There is 

 armor up and to the right in here. There is also a minigun there. This 

 area has bulletproof glass, so you are safe. Go downstairs to the little 

 opening (not the red path to the left). Shoot out more guards in here. 

 At the end of the path is armor. Then, take a right and another right and 

 you can see a radar room. Disable the SAM site. Then, go downstairs and 

 over to the yellow striped area. There is a grate below you. Go to the 

 end where the grate is up and go in for the health and armor that is down 

 there. Move along, as there are more enemies to kill. Then move left– 

 they say that there is a keycard. Get the armor then touch the scientist 

 to get his keycard. Follow him down the path to the left and you will be 

 in a giant cylinder building. Work your way down all of the stairs, 

 shooting as you go. Get the Jetpack and fly out, heading for the triangle. 

 You can fire a weapon while flying, but you really do not have to. Truth 

 takes it from you, takes off, and abandons you there. 

 

 

 Body Harvest mission: 

 ——————— 

 Take a bike to the farm and ride to the back of the farm using an indirect 

 route, bypassing the survivalists in the fields and tractors. Quickly steal 

 the harvester, then run over the survivalists that are on foot between you 

 and the road back. Try to overturn the pickups that are in your way. If 

 they are still following you on the road, do a drive by when one is next 

 to you to kill the gunman on the truck bed. The Harvester can take quite 

 a bit of damage. Hit the pickup until it catches on fire, then get away. 

 

 

 Burglary missions: 

 —————— 

 In the Ganton area of Los Santos, go towards the gym that is just a block 

 south of the Binco store and the bar. Across the street from the gym and 

 to the south, you should see a van parked next to a house. It is a boxcar. 

 After 20:00, jump in and you can go on burglary missions until sunrise. 

 

 Go to CJ’s garage in San Fierro. Look behind it, and there should be a 

 construction site. Behind the structures of broken down buildings in 

 front of you, there should be an abandoned building with a lop-sided 

 sign that reads“Harry Plumbs”just north of the“Turning Tricks Advanced 

 Driving School”. Look to the right of that building to find an alleyway. 

 Walk into the alleyway and look to the right. There should be a black van 

 parked there. Get in sometime before 20:00 and find a nice house you 

 think will make a nice profit. Wait until 20:00, then start the burglary 

 missions; you can do the missions until 06:00. Note: When dropping off 

 the cargo, you will return to the garage next to the alleyway that you 

 found the van at. 

 

 Steal any burglary van you know of, and travel to any city of your choice. 

 Proceed as usual, and after you have steak the goods, a yellow blip will 

 appear on your map. Pause game play and look at the map. You will see that 

 the blip has jumped from the city you stole the van in, to the city you 

 are currently at. For example, if you steal the van in Los Santos and go 

 to Las Venturas and trigger the burglary missions, the yellow blip will 

 appear in las Venturas, close behind“The Camel’s Toe”Casino. 

 

 To commit burglaries in San Fierro, go to the Doherty area. Go to the 

 building that has a big sign board, reading“Hairy Plumbs”. It is opposite 

 the driving school. Go around the back of the building to find the van. 

 

 

 Infinite time in Burglary missions: 

 ———————————– 

 Enable the“Always 21:00″code, then find the van. Additionally, enable the 

 “Always 21:00″and“Wanted level never increases”codes. Find a Boxville and 

 initiate a burglary mission. You should now have as much time as desired to 

 do the mission, and the cops will never chase you if you wake up the people 

 in the houses. 

 

 

 Catalyst mission: 

 —————– 

 When you reach the train, do not bother getting out of your car. Drive 

 around the pinned down Groves and run into the Vagos. Drive into the train 

 tunnel to turn around if needed. After all the ones on the ground are killed, 

 exit the car and shoot the one on the train. Then, get back into your car 

 and run over the arriving Ballas. If your car begins smoking, park it next to 

 the Ballas car to create an explosion that should kill them all. Then, get on 

 the train as instructed. Quickly toss the ammo crates to Ryder. There is an 

 unlimited number of them onboard so you do not have to waste time getting a 

 perfect target. You may want to change the“Invert Look Controls”setting 

 to make this less confusing. Remember to change the setting back after all 

 the crates are tossed. 

 

 

 Cleaning The Hood mission: 

 ————————– 

 Do not bother using fighting moves on the crack dealer outside. A single 

 shot from your pistol will bring him down. Once inside the crack den, use 

 the pistol again to take down the targets quickly. Note: Shoot the man with 

 the bat first. 

 

 

 Cop Wheels mission: 

 ——————- 

 Any police motorcycles will not work. You must steal the ones that the game 

 marks for you. 

 

 

 Da Nang Thang mission: 

 ———————- 

 When the helicopter gets shot down and you are in the water, do not swim to 

 the ship. Instead, swim to shore, steal a car, and drive to Ammu-Nation to 

 buy weapons and armor. Then, go to the ship. The mission is a lot easier 

 with an AK-47 in your inventory. 

 

 

 Drive-By mission: 

 —————– 

 After approaching each group of targets, just continue to drive around the 

 block normally. There is no reason to damage your car trying to reverse or 

 spin back around. The targets do not run far. Simply drive normally around 

 the block until your partners can start shooting them again. With the last 

 group of Balla’s, drive your car down the path and through the tunnel to 

 run them over. Turn around and repeat until they are all dead. Note: Since 

 this mission is not timed, you can drive carefully to a Pay N’Spray between 

 drive-bys to get your car’s health bar restored. You will eventually have 

 to go to the Pay N’Spray anyway at the end of the mission to lower your 

 wanted level. Note: That visit will be complimentary, but any others will 

 be charged. 

 

 

 Drive Thru mission: 

 ——————- 

 Try to get in front of the Ballas car and trap it into a wall or building. 

 Your partners will shoot it until it catches on fire. Get your car away 

 from it before it explodes. Additionally, after getting the background of 

 the mission, drive back to Grove Street and get the bazooka. Aim at the exit 

 for Grove street. When the Ballas car is coming, shoot at it to quickly 

 finish the mission. 

 

 

 Explosive Situation mission: 

 —————————- 

 Go into the quarry and shoot the two workers that are featured the opening 

 sequence at the detonation controls. This will stop the countdown and you 

 can take your time getting the dynamite. Run over the dynamite crates with 

 the giant dump truck to beak them open and get the explosives. 

 

 

 Farewell My Love mission: 

 ————————- 

 As the race begins, instead of going forward, turn around and go straight. 

 You will be jumping off a cliff, but if you can land your car successfully 

 you will be on your way. Keep driving straight into the town. Take a right 

 turn at the first right you see. If you have already done the race you 

 should know where to go. Follow the road and take another right. You will 

 then be driving across a small bridge. Turn left on the small dirt road 

 and park your car at the end of the bridge. Since you are allowed only 25 

 seconds out of your car, you must do this quickly. Once out of your car, 

 run to the middle of the bridge. Enable the“Spawn Rhino”code, which 

 should block the bridge. Do this as many times as desired, but be aware 

 that the other cars will show up sometime around three minutes. When the 

 cars appear, make sure to have the rocket launcher out before getting in 

 your car. When the cars show up, they will drive into the creek/river. 

 Quickly get out of your car and fire multiple rockets at them. Do this 

 very quickly. You can then complete the race with no competitors. 

 Additionally, before the race starts, enable the“Flying cars”code. 

 Go to the race. Immediately at the start of the race, all cars will 

 floor it and will fly off the cliff. This gives you as much time as needed 

 to complete the race. Make sure you go drive slow so that you also do not 

 fly off. About six minutes are required to complete the race. 

 

 

 Fender Ketchup mission: 

 ———————– 

 To easily complete this mission, find a large empty area and just keep 

 going fast back and forth doing a lot of 180 degree turns to get the 

 scare-o-meter full. Watch out for cops—once they spot you, you will 

 have more then one star and they will try to hit you head on. Remember 

 to make sure that you do not get in a head on collision, or the man on 

 the hood will die. Additionally, do not drive on the freeway, as this 

 will attract the police. Instead, drive to the airport and perform a 

 few insane jumps. This will have him terrified quickly. Also, the 

 airport is not too far from Woozie’s casino. Pull to the side of Woozie’s 

 casino and drive back and forth doing 180s until the Scare-O-Meter is 

 full. 

 

 

 High Stakes, Low Rider mission: 

 ——————————- 

 Instead of using the first lowrider that was given you by Cesar, drive 

 any vehicle to Cesar’s house. Look across the street from the mission 

 starting circle to find a light colored Voodoo in a driveway. Get in 

 it, and use it to start the mission. This car is considered a low 

 rider, but does not have hydraulics making it less likely that you 

 will accidentally activate them. It also controls better in turns 

 when compared to your original lowrider. Get to the starting position 

 of the race. When the race begins, try to maneuver around the inevitable 

 initial crash of most of the other drivers. Note that the waypoint 

 markers for races now are visible on the horizon, unlike the“bubble” 

 Markers of previous Grand Theft Auto games. Also, imbedded in the 

 waypoint marker is an arrow that will indicate the direction that you 

 need to follow for the next marker. It may be easier to slip into 

 second place and watch the first place cars for cues on where to turn. 

 Otherwise, just pay attention to the directions and take your turns 

 carefully when in first place. By the time you reach the final waypoint 

 markers, slip into first place, or use the final straight away to take 

 the lead. Do not slow down at the end, even though the road stops. 

 Hit the finish line at full speed. Additionally, when you get in the 

 low rider, enable the“Deadly vehicle”code. During the race, tap the 

 rear bumper of each car in front of you. By the end of the race, you 

 will have as much time as needed to finish in first place without any 

 competition. 

 

 Enable the“Flying cars”code before you get to the starting grid. 

 When the race begins, the five other low-riders will start to fly 

 around the area. When you reach the third or fourth checkpoint, you 

 will be in first place throughout the race. Do not accelerate fast, 

 because you will also end up flying. Instead, drive at a very slow 

 pace, but fast enough so that you can finish the race before the game 

 freezes. 

 

 

 Bulletproof Savanna in High Stakes, Low Rider mission: 

 —————————————————— 

 After completing the mission, Cesar and his Savanna will remain at 

 the finish line, but the doors will be locked. Use another vehicle 

 to push the car to your garage. The doors will now be unlocked and 

 the car remains bulletproof. 

 

 

 Home Invasion mission: 

 ———————- 

 Try to get to the target house with as much time remaining. The 

 required three ammunition boxes can be found in the following 

 locations. In the first room that you enter, look to your right 

 near the cannon next to the front window. Go up the stairs and look 

 on the landing. Go all the way up the stairs and go to the end of 

 the hallway. If desired, you can get three more boxes in the house, 

 but they do not seem to give anything extra. 

 

 

 Ice Cold Killa mission: 

 ———————– 

 Take a gun and shoot out the tires of the pimpmobile. Then, shoot 

 the car until the smoke turns black. Next, get a gun that you can 

 do drive bys with. If you do not have one, go behind the building 

 and by a pole for the bridge to find one. When you get into the 

 club through the windows, meet Jizzy and just run out of the club 

 after him. When you are out there, the pimpmobile should be in the 

 same condition that you left it. It is easier to blow up his car. 

 Additionally, before you go into the club, shoot out the tires of 

 his Pimpmobile. Get in the club, chase him out, and he will get 

 into the car even with blown tires. You just run after him, and pull 

 him out of the car. 

 

 Outside the club are two limos along with Jizzy’s car. Before 

 entering the club through the skylight, park one limo in front 

 of his car and the other behind his car, blocking it in. It will 

 remain this way when Jizzy exits the club and tries to escape, 

 making it easy to run up and pull him out of the car before he can 

 drive off. Also,“high center”Jizzy’s car on the grassy median 

 along the boardwalk prior to entering the club. He will not be able 

 to drive off it before you reach the car to pull him out. Additionally, 

 before entering the club, blow up Jizzy’s car rather than just shooting 

 off the tires or decreasing its health. Then when Jizzy tries to escape, 

 he will be forced to do so in a Pizzaboy scooter. Just knock him off 

 his bike and kill him with an M4 or any other gun. 

 

 Instead of trying to get out and get in jizzy’s car, just follow him for 

 awhile. He will get out of the car, and you can shoot him. 

 

 

 Just Business mission: 

 ———————- 

 On the first part, let Sweet do all the shooting. When on the motorcycle 

 unleash your guns on the people on motorcycles going for the person 

 driving. If he dies they both do. You can also try to pop their tires. 

 They will spin out. Do not worry about the big truck you see—it is 

 indestructible. You will see the action play out of you going of the 

 car. You will jump off the big truck from the trailer. 

 

 

 Key To Her Heart mission: 

 ————————- 

 In the Key To Her Heart mission for Woozie in Las Venturas, when you 

 go to the courtier’s house and kill the gimp, you can take his purple 

 dildo to use as a melee weapon. Additionally, when you get Millie as 

 a girlfriend, instead of dating her, kill her. Wait awhile and Woozie 

 will call. CJ will say that Millie is dead. Woozie will tell you to 

 go to her house and take the pass key. 

 

 

 Strange T-Bone behavior in Mike Toreno mission: 

 ———————————————- 

 In the mission, when instructed to get into the car and doing so, 

 you can choose any car desired. Get out and choose a faster vehicle 

 with T-Bone following you. T-Bone’s following actions for entering 

 and exiting vehicles are scripted strangely. For example, if you 

 crash and get thrown off a motorcycle with T-Bone on it with you, 

 he will get up and walk to any nearby vehicle door, and then follow 

 you. 

 

 

 Misappropriation mission: 

 ————————- 

 Instead of chasing the man in the helicopter, enable the“Spawn 

 Jetpack”code. Fly up behind the man. Make sure he does not see 

 you then open fire from the Jetpack. Swoop in, grab the dossier, 

 then make your escape before the FBI kills you. 

 

 

 Mountain Cloud Boys mission: 

 —————————- 

 This mission seems difficult at first, but if you have the correct 

 weapons it can be easy. First, enable the“Weapons (tier 3)”code 

 to get the rocket launcher. Next, enable the“Deadly vehicle”code. 

 When the men come after you, shoot the first two or three with a 

 gun. Get ahead of Woozie and shoot a rocket at the car to blow it 

 up, killing everyone there. As you go further, two motorcycles will 

 pull up. Hit them with the rocket launcher. Be careful; make sure 

 that the bike blows up before getting too close. As you go further 

 into the alley, you can shoot rockets in the directions of enemies 

 with guns and kill them all, but stay ahead of Woozie. When you and 

 Woozie jump in the car (having the“Deadly vehicle”code enabled), 

 just hit the two cars head on, but be careful. Your car can be 

 damaged and explode as a result of too many hits. 

 

 

 Noon mission: 

 ————- 

 You must keep ramming him and do the“PIT”maneuver as taught in 

 driving school. His car will come next to you. When it does, shoot 

 him with a drive by. His car will catch on fire and he will get 

 out. He will shoot at you. You must shoot at him first and he will 

 die. Additionally, before you start, get a RPG or a homing rocket 

 launcher. Then, enable the“Cars fly away”code. When you start 

 the mission, get the dune buggy nearby and ram Eddie’s car. It will 

 float away slowly, then it will hover. While it is hovering, get 

 out of the dune buggy and shoot him down with the RPG or homing 

 rocket launcher; it will blow up and fall down. 

 

 Sometimes when you drive out of the ghost town, at the of the 

 intersection of the dirt road leading out of the ghost town and 

 the road leading to the Sherman Dam, Pulaski will go too fast on 

 the left turn, go wide, and crash into a road sign on the side of 

 the road. Block him and hijack his car. Drive into the water just 

 north of the Sherman Dam. Do not go too fast though, or you will 

 lose Pulaski and fail the mission. Exit the car and just stay in 

 the water. Pulaski will run after you after you steal his car, and 

 end up walking into the water. Pulaski cannot swim, and will drown. 

 You will have killed Pulaski without using cheats or bullets. 

 

 Before you start mission, equip a sniper riffle. When the Pulaski 

 runs for the car, aim and zoom in. You will have enough time to 

 flatten the front and the rear tire. Then, hop in the Sand Rail 

 next to the cemetery and follow his car. Watch him; he will be 

 swerving all over the place. This will give you enough time to 

 shoot at the car or pull him out and shoot him. 

 

 

 OG Loc mission: 

 ————— 

 After getting the PCJ and beginning the chase, it is not necessary 

 to shoot at or try to knock Freddy off his bike. You simply need 

 to follow him. If you lose sight of him, just keeping him in the 

 zoomed version of the mini-map is enough to keep the mission going. 

 Try to follow his path, but if he gets out of sight, you can use 

 parallel streets and paths to continue. Pay attention to whether 

 his position is above or below you (a triangle instead of a square) 

 on the mini-map, and choose the appropriate course. At the end, 

 he will stop at a park in Vagos territory. Ride your PCJ up the 

 stairs past the gang to the top of the structure, then mow them 

 down as they clear the top of the steps. Additionally, if you 

 failed this mission the first time and try it again, you will be 

 prompted to trip skip. This makes you automatically get OG Loc, 

 and end up at the house where you ring the door bell. 

 

 

 Pier 69 mission: 

 —————- 

 Instead of chasing Ryder in the boat, wait until he approaches 

 in his boat, then enable the“Destroy all cars”code. The mission 

 will be instantly completed. 

 

 Billboard message In Reuniting The Families mission: 

 Along the highway in Los Santos is an advertisement on a billboard. 

 It has a woman on it with a can of pop on the side of her labeled 

 Sprunk. Under that, it reads“A taste of things to come”. At the 

 end of the Reuniting The Families mission, your car will go through 

 that billboard, changing the writing at the bottom to read 

 “A taste of come”. 

 

 

 Riot mission: 

 ————- 

 This mission is quite long and requires a lot of ammunition and 

 body armor. You must take over all of the gang territories in the 

 hood areas. Try driving concentric to the Johnson house going 

 outward in one big circle. Once you have established your territory, 

 the mission is complete and you can celebrate with Big Smoke and 

 continue with the other missions. 

 

 

 Robbing Uncle Sam mission: 

 ————————– 

 Before you climb over the gate, get a gun or Uzi and shoot the 

 two soldiers from outside . When you climb over the gate, shoot 

 the guard standing behind two crates . When you enter the warehouse, 

 use the forklift and carry two boxes at a time. Do this by sliding 

 the arms directly into the middle of two boxes. You can now carry 

 both of them at the same time. However, you cannot put two boxes 

 into the truck at the same time . By the time you carry the two 

 boxes behind the truck , one army guard will appear and Ryder will 

 try to kill him. Do not let him kill the guard by himself, as he 

 takes a long time and could lose a lot of health. After you have 

 carried the four boxes to the truck , there will be two boxes outside 

 the warehouse . They can be found at the left hand side of the 

 warehouse, and the other can be found at the place where you killed 

 the third soldier before you entered the warehouse. After when you 

 escape , two army vehicles will start to chase you. If you are lucky, 

 both of them can keep crashing and they will end up exploding. 

 

 Before starting the mission, find the TV Studios in the northwest 

 part of Los Santos. At the top of the stairs (in the car park), 

 you will find a sniper rifle. When you start the mission, do not 

 shoot the guard at the gate. Instead, run behind the building that 

 is on your left. Go up the stairs, walk along the pathway, and 

 drop down at the end. Run and climb up the container boxes that 

 are in front of you. You may get shot a few times, but if you are 

 fast, you will survive. Use the sniper rifle to shoot all the 

 guards (do not open the gate yet). After you have opened the 

 warehouse door by shooting the switch on the right and have 

 killed the two guards inside, move the boxes close to the door 

 by using the forklift. Also, move the two boxes outside (which 

 one of the guards was previously using for cover). You can now 

 open the front gate. If you use the sniper rifle, you will not 

 have to keep running around. You should be able to load the boxes 

 quickly while Sweet covers you. Note: Keep an eye on Sweet’s health. 

 You may need to stop loading and shoot a few guards if he starts 

 to lose too much health. 

 

 When you pull up to the gate, hop the wall and shoot the guard at 

 the gate. Go and shoot the two other guards by the warehouse, then 

 shoot the keypad next to the door. Kill the men inside the warehouse. 

 Turn back around and another guard will be running towards you. 

 Shoot him, then hop on the forklift and put the crates by the 

 warehouse door where the truck backs up to. Then, get the two crates 

 that are outside and put them by the other ones. Keep one elevated 

 on the forklift. Shoot the keypad on the gate. Get back on the 

 forklift. Put the first crate inside the truck, then get off and 

 kill the soldier attacking Ryder. Then, get another crate and do 

 the same thing. Every time you load one crate, another soldier will 

 appear. Keep getting off the forklift and kill them. This takes some 

 time, but you and Ryder will not get killed. Get back in the truck 

 when Ryder tells you to and leave. The two Patroits that follow you 

 will be easy to get rid of. 

 

 After loading the six crates in the truck, before you jump into the 

 van to drive away, run to the stairs where the soldiers were coming 

 from. Take out the rocket launcher. The two Patriots will follow you 

 to the stairs and you can destroy them with the rocket launcher. 

 After taking them out, you will be able to get back safely with out 

 the nuisance of the Patriots chasing after you. 

 

 

 Stowaway mission: 

 —————– 

 To easily complete this mission, wheelie in a straight line to the 

 right of the plane, getting next to the ramp. When the plane has 

 offloaded the last of its barrels, turn sharply left and go up the 

 ramp. When aboard, it is critical not to use any firearms at all. 

 Even one shot is usually enough to blow you out of the sky. Also, 

 do not plant more than five charges, as they may self-detonate once 

 you pass that amount. Do not detonate the satchel charges until you 

 are standing on the end of the ramp, or you may not get out in time. 

 

 

 Supply Line mission: 

 ——————– 

 First, go after the man on the bike to your left when you take off. 

 Next, swing around and take out the man in the van. Then, head west 

 and take out the other van. This is the easy part. Instead of flying 

 across town to kill the motorbike and the last van, land on a building 

 close to where you started and just remain there. You will not lose 

 any fuel after your model airplane has landed. For some reason, the 

 other two couriers will make their way toward you. Sit patiently until 

 you can get behind the bike (it will reach you first), then land again 

 on a nearby building. The last van may end up on the freeway. You will 

 have a clear shot at him by flying only a few blocks, and you will be 

 close to Zero’s shop. Additionally, enable the“Fast motion”code 

 repeatedly (about five times) before entering the red marker to start 

 the mission. Your plane will fly faster, but your fuel will deplete 

 the same rate as if you were in normal time. Also, wait on Zero’s roof 

 until the van passes by, by doing this, you will save fuel. 

 

 

 Sweet’s Girl mission: 

 ——————— 

 Make sure you have a fast and reliable car in your garage before 

 staring the mission. Quickly drive to the yellow objective marker. 

 Drive your car on the sidewalk to mow down the Ballas. Keep going 

 into the basketball court at the end of the street to turn around and 

 make another pass. If your car starts smoking, quickly park it next 

 to any survivors and bail. The explosion should kill them. Get behind 

 some cover and shoot anyone remaining. 

 

 

 Tagging Up Turf mission: 

 ———————— 

 To spray over the last tag on the upper part of the building, walk to 

 the nearby small fenced in alley. You will be instructed to climb it. 

 Do so, cross to the other higher fence and also climb that. Then, climb 

 the short wall, then climb again to the ledge that you can use to walk 

 to the tag. 

 

 

 Tanker Commander mission: 

 ————————- 

 After hooking up the trailer, jump out of the truck. The gas station 

 attendant and a friend will be in a car nearby. It will repeatedly 

 crash into the stationary truck and trailer and become damage. Stay 

 out of the way and shoot the car when it is in a safe position until 

 it catches on fire. The gas station attendant will bail. Shoot him, 

 then get back in the truck and carefully drive it to the destination 

 marker. 

 

 

 Toreno’s Last Flight mission: 

 —————————– 

 When you go to take out Toreno, wait until his helicopter’s energy bar 

 appears. Then, enable the“Destroy all cars”code. 

 

 

 Up, Up, And Away mission: 

 ————————- 

 Instead of going directly into the military compound and fighting the 

 soldiers, steal a Leviathan from the Las Venturas airport. Land it outside 

 of Woozie’s casino. After the mission briefing, fly above the destination 

 marker. You should see a helipad with a Leviathan in the distance. Try to 

 land near the helipad and watch out for two soldiers armed with rocket 

 launchers. Bail out if needed near the helipad. Kill the armed soldiers, 

 shoot down the other helicopters, then finish the mission. Instead of 

 fighting all the soldiers downstairs, all you had to do is kill two men 

 and destroy two helicopters. 

 

 

 Vertical Bird mission: 

 ———————- 

 Your mission is to board the aircraft carrier by jumping off your boat and 

 swimming inside. If you drive your boat into the back of the loading docks 

 of the aircraft carrier, your cover is blown. Run and gun to the radar room 

 and take out the SAM launcher. Afterwards, run to the back of the carrier, 

 and before you take off with the Hydra, blow up two of the three Hydras. 

 Do not destroy the one on the loading elevator, as this is the one you want. 

 Then, take off and you will only have one other Hydra to shoot down with 

 instead of three. After you have taken out the enemy Hydra, sink the three 

 spy boats by hovering your jet instead of flying. 

 

 

 Wrong Side Of The Tracks mission: 

 ——————————— 

 Once at the station, do not get on the dirt bike. Instead, enable the 

 “Spawn Jetpack”code, then kill the men on the train with the shotgun. 

 Once you have killed the men on the train, you must go back to Smoke and 

 get on the dirt bike to pass the mission. Additionally, smoke has very 

 bad aim. Try to keep up speed with the train. When Smoke tells too take 

 the hill, do not, as this makes completing the mission almost impossible. 

 Instead, stay with the moving train. Go past the barrier and try to avoid 

 getting hit by the other train. Also, turn off the vibration option on the 

 controller to help keep your hands steady while on the tracks. 

 

 

 Notre Dame parody in Las Venturas: 

 ———————————- 

 Enter the bar called The Craw Bar in Las Venturas. As soon as you enter, 

 you will see a small Notre Dame sign that instead reads“Notre Lame”on 

 the wall directly ahead. 

 

 

 DRIV3R reference in Madd Dogg’s Rhymes mission: 

 ———————————————–

 you, Refractions, how could you mess up so bad?!”This is a reference to 

 DRIV3R, only they changed“Reflections”to“Refractions”. 

 

 

 Grand Theft Auto 3 reference in Farewell My Love mission: 

 ——————————————————— 

 The man who Catalina is with is the main character from Grand Theft Auto 3.

 Business references in Los Santos: 

 ———————————- 

 In the“Sunset Strip”area ,you can see a train car parked off the street 

 (near the hill that you drive up to get to Mad Dog’s mansion). This is 

 supposed to be Carney’s, the burger joint that is actually on the real Sunset 

 Strip in Los Angeles. Additionally, earlier in the game, across the street 

 where you meat Tenpenny (at a donut shop) for a mission, look at the wall 

 across the street. You can see an advertisement for“Blob Music”, which is 

 a reference to Amoeba Music which can be found in Hollywood, Berkeley, and 

 San Francisco. The design looks almost identical to that of the real business. 

 

 In the opening sequence before you start the game (with the game credits), 

 watch the pictures that are shown. In one picture is a building in Vinewood. 

 This is a reference to the Capitol Records building in Hollywood. The building 

 in the game is located somewhere in Vinewood. 

 

 

 Candy Suxxx reference:

 film star Candy Suxxx on the wall, who originally appeared in Grand Theft 

 Auto: Vice City. 

 

 

 Grand Theft Auto 3 reference: 

 —————————– 

 Pay close attention to the shows that are heard on WFTC while cruising around 

 San Andreas. Notice that one of the shows is called“Gardening With Maurice”. 

 If listened to Chatterbox in Grand Theft Auto 3 , you may remember Lazlow

 off the air. Obviously this game takes place further in the past, so 

 “Gardening With Maurice”is still on.

 has a wide selection of Peace Makers! Come by Ammunation on Militia Mondays”

 the safe houses in Las Venturas is a casino in the northern part. 

 Behind it is a sign of Candy Suxx moving her leg. 

 

 On the Old Venturas Strip, the cowboy on a casino is Grand Theft Auto: 

 Vice City’s southern real estate tycoon Avery Carrington. 

 

 

 Grand Theft Auto: Vice City reference in Los Santos: 

 —————————————————- 

 Near the Vinewood area and the Market district, there is a giant studio company 

 that you can enter. If you look at it, these buildings are the same ones that 

 are at Interglobal Studios in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City . Keep looking around 

 the building and you will see the front offices. In big letters, the name of 

 the company is posted. It is Interglobal Television. 

 

 

 Grand Theft Auto: Vice City references in San Fierro:

 mansion from Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. 

 

 

 Manhunt reference in Los Santos: 

 ——————————–

 There is a junkyard in the Mt. Chiliad/Shady Creek area that is exactly like 

 the junkyard level in Manhunt. You can also find a Dozer here to drive. 

 

 

 Radio comments: 

 ——————————– 

 * Afer doing some Grove Street missions and seizing territory, one of the DJs on the 

 radio will say“Have you heard Grove Streets making a comeback? That’s great news. 

 hope they don’t take me out just for playing this music.” 

 

 * After the 555 We Tip mission, another DJ says“Did you hear about that D.A. with 

 the trunk full of drugs? I can’t believe that. Keeping it all for his own personal 

 stash.” 

 

 * You can also listen to the talk radio to hear Lazlo host the entertainment section, 

 where he interviews OG LOC (the rapper you help during the Grove Street missions)

 Get Tanks Quickly ! 

 =================== 

 Take the First city, Second scene (Hiest All Mighty). 

 To get a tank without having to get an ambulance or 

 patrol car, drive to the bridge in North Estoria. 

 Now turn around and go just a little to the south, 

 take the fist right (the car’s right) and then the 

 first right (again the first right). Stay on this 

 road until you reach the north west coner of this 

 road. Drive onto the boardwalk, go north first you’ll 

 see a couple of black boxes then farther north you’ll 

 stumble across the 2, (Yes!)the 2 army tanks. 

 

 Monster Bug ! 

 ============= 

 In the city San Andreas, Level 1 (Mandarin Mayhem)go to 

 Central Richman. In one of the driveways there will be a 

 Monster Bug. Get in it and have fun! (Kill Frenzy for 2 

 minutes) 

 

 Walk Along The Train Track ! 

 ============================ 

 On Liberty city (doesn’t matter which one) Hijack the train 

 by pressing ctrl and press foward. Just after you have gone 

 under the park you will go south (to a pick up point for 

 one of the missions) Stop the train there and press enter. 

 Hopefully you have done it right and you can get out of the 

 train (If not try moving the train slighty) Once the train 

 have gone you are free to walk on around as much as you want. 

 It is especally good if you have a rocket lancher because you 

 can fire into buildings with people underneath and the coppers 

 can’t get you!

 When you start out on a level steal a car, but don’t pick 

 a big one or else the trick will be harder. Then keep 

 searching for a garage door kinda thing that has an X 

 coming out from it. Enter that place and your car will be 

 rigged or in other words bombed. Then stop the car somewhere 

 and press the FIRE button your car will be armed so get out 

 of it within about five seconds or you will BLOW up! 

 This trick is useful for jobs, killing and collecting money. 

 You MUST have at least $5,000 dollors or you will not be able 

 to get your car rigged. 

 

 

 Easy Tank 

 ——— 

 On the first city, access the second scene (Heist All Mighty.) 

 When you start, run somebody over and wait for the ambulance 

 to arrive. When it does, nick it and drive to the army base, 

 drive in and you can nick the tank. 

 This only works with an ambulance or a police car. 

 

 

 Gang Leader 

 ———– 

 Go up to a group of Gurangas, or the groups of people making 

 noise and running around following each other. Now, don’t shoot 

 them, but instead beat up the person in the front. If you beat 

 him up enough, they will start following you almost anywhere. 

 It’s a good way to get a guranga with a machine gun, flame 

 thrower, or other high powered weapon of death. 

 

 

 Train Hijacking 

 ————— 

 At any train station, enter the train and press CTRL to gain 

 control of that train. 

 

 

 Walk in the Sewer 

 —————– 

 From the starting location, in Liberty City, go north on the 

 starting road past the park, all the way until you get to the 

 Beast, then go north on that road, around the bend until you 

 get to the next major 3-way intersection. Take an immediate 

 left on that major road. Go over the bridge and take a right 

 on the road, heading north, immediately after it. Go past the 

 Hospital and Police station, then take a left on that major 

 road. Follow that road until you get to a 3-way intersection 

 with a 6-lane road. It is the first sewer on YOUR right. Get 

 out of your car and step on the curb next to the sewer, you 

 should fall through. 

 Once you fall in, you can’t get out. Drive your car on it for 

 a nasty surprise. 

 

 

 

 RAMPAGE HINTS: 

 ————– 

 Submitted by: bsh 

 

 There are two easy ways to complete a rampages that you have to destroy cars. 

 The first way is to make a collection of the amount of the cars you need for 

 the mission, you will have the problem of the cars disserpearing, if you go 

 to 8-balls first and plant a bomb on the car it will stay where you leave it 

 enabling you to make a collection of cars to blow up on the rampage. 

 The second way is to block a road next to the rampage with a bus 

 that also has a bomb planted on it, this enables you to leave the 

 bus and collect the rampage, once you have collected the rampage 

 and returned to the bus you should have collected some traffic 

 behind the bus. all that you have to do then is to destroy the 

 cars that have built up. 

 Hoola hoola 

 

 

 More money: 

 ———– 

 Steal a taxi cab and stop at a sidewalk. Wait for someone to call a taxi and take 

 them to their destination to receive money. Repeat this to receive your desired pay 

 from this job. 

 

 

 Go under fences: 

 —————- 

 Park a HGV next to a fence. Face the fence and press [Space] to crawl under the bus 

 and then under the fence. Note: You can not get back out unless there is a opening 

 or an HGV to use the same trick on. 

 

 

 Go underground: 

 ————— 

 Go to the first train station after the park and get in the train. Keep going until 

 you reach the part of the track where it goes underground. Stop the train and you 

 should be able to get out. Then, quickly go to the back of the train and wait until 

 it moves off. You may now walk underground. Note: You can only get back on top by 

 finding the train track exit and following it to the station. 

 

 

 Kill all twelve boy scouts at once: 

 ———————————– 

 Find a group of the little orange boy scouts and stand in front of them so they will 

 come over to you. Then, lead them to an electric train station. Lead them onto the 

 tracks and run away quickly. 

 

 

 Jam up train: 

 ————- 

 When you start the first level, jump into the Bulldog and drive it over to the train 

 station across the street. Drive it towards the tracks, then jump out as it hits the 

 tracks. Run away before it explodes. If done correctly, the car should be blocking the 

 tracks. When the train arrives, it will hit the car and become stuck. 

 You cannot get into the train once it hits the car. 

 

 

 Police Helicopters: 

 ——————- 

 Submitted by: Xuodin 

 

 When You Are Under Attack By Police Helicopter, You Can Destroy It With One Shot. 

 Just Aim Above The Cockpit, In The Engine And Shoot With Any Sniper Rifle To Destroy It. 

 

 When You Have A Wanted Level (3 or more), And Under Attack By A Police Helicopter, You 

 Can Destroy It With One Hit. You Just Fire On It With Any Sniper Rifle, But You Have To Aim 

 At The Engine, Just Above The Cockpit. That Should Take Care Of Him. Stay Cool.

 Hints: 

 —— 

 Submitted by: Pancham.R.Bharadwaj 

 

 Modify vehicle characteristics: 

 ——————————- 

 Use a text editor to edit the“handling.cfg”file in the“\rockstar games\gta san 

 andreas\data”directory. You will find a list of all the vehicles and a description 

 of each multiplier factor. You can modify the acceleration, top speed, mass, 

 monetary value, transmission, gravity center, and much more. 

 

 

 Two player mode: 

 —————- 

 Successfully complete the Burning Desire mission where you rescue Denise. A red 

 two player free roam icon will now appear on Denise’s porch near the door. The 

 icon will appear there when she is home and will go on a date. Note: If both enter 

 a car, the passenger will have free aim with a machine gun. Do not try to kill 

 Denise, because you will never be able to date her again or play in two player 

 mode at her house. Additionally, once you get your girlfriend, take her on a date. 

 After you drop her off, there will be a rotating icon of two people directly in 

 front of the door. Walk into it. It will tell you to push any button on the 

 controller two. Do so to start two player mode, involving CJ and his girlfriend 

 in a free roam. 

 

 For more fun in two player mode, start the two player mission. Then, enable the 

 “Spawn Jetpack”code and remove the Jetpack. Then, have player two get the Jetpack. 

 Enable the Jetpack code again, then have player one get it. Both players can now 

 fly around and do the two player missions this way. 

 

 

 Two player mode in Los Santos: 

 —————————— 

 Note: You must have a second controller inserted in port two. In the Ganton area, 

 start from Grove Street where the Johnson house is located. Drive under the first 

 bridge and continue to go straight. Next, youshould drive over some railroad tracks. 

 After this, you should drive under a second bridge. Take the first right turn you 

 see. It should be a dead end. Drive until your car hits the grass, then look to 

 your left. You should see an open doorway. Walk through it and you should see a 

 small“2 Player”icon. Press any button on controller two to begin. Additionally, 

 when you are on the missions from Big Smoke go north of his house. You should see 

 some wrecked buildings. Go through them to find a two player free roam icon. 

 

 

 Two player mode in San Fierro: 

 —————————— 

 Not far from the garage you own and beyond the construction area is a large 

 building with a parking lot on either side, on the right side (north according 

 to the map) is a two player icon. Multiple people types can be selected by the 

 second player (three women and three men). Unlike those from the dating missions, 

 this two player location will never go away. 

 

 

 Two player mode in Bone County: 

 ——————————- 

 Starting at the abandoned airstrip, go west and north onto the road. There is a 

 blackish-brown building on the south side of the road with a large balcony going 

 all the way around it. Follow the balcony half way around and you will find a two 

 player mode icon. 

 

 

 Two player mode in Tierra Robada: 

 ——————————— 

 Start at your safe house in El Quebrados. Get on the street and follow it a short 

 distance south until it turns left around the corner of a building. On the south 

 side of this building will be a two player free roam icon. 

 

 

 Two player mode in Whetstone: 

 —————————– 

 Go to the General Store in Dilmore. There is a two player icon there. The second 

 player will be able to change their character. 

 

 

 Freight Train missions bonus: 

 —————————– 

 Successfully complete level 2 of the Freight Train missions to get $50,000 and 

 free train rides. 

 

 

 Fire truck missions bonus: 

 ————————– 

 Steal a fire truck and start the fire truck missions. Successfully complete level 

 12 of the fire truck missions to make CJ fireproof. 

 

 

 Easily complete fire truck missions: 

 ———————————— 

 Bring a fire truck from another location into Angel Pine, then start the mission. 

 This should be easier than doing it in Los Santos, San Fierro, the desert, or Las 

 Venturas. When you do it at this location, and you are stuck on a cliff that you 

 cannot get up (for example, if the burning car is on the freeway), take your time 

 by taking the long way. You should only use this method if you have at least three 

 minutes or more time remaining. Note: All fires will not always appear in Angel 

 Pine, as they may also happen in Whetstone or other nearby places. Although this 

 sounds difficult, there are not that many roads near the Angel Pine area which 

 actually makes it easier to complete. If the fire truck gets severely damaged, 

 enable the“Health”code. 

 

 

 Mike Toreno missions bonus: 

 ————————— 

 Successfully complete all missions assigned by Mike Toreno to get a flamethrower, 

 minigun, rocket launcher, and homing rocket launcher to appear at his cabin in 

 Tierra Robada. 

 

 

 Paramedic missions bonus: 

 ————————-

 12 of the paramedic missions to get a health limit of 150. 

 

 

 Easily complete paramedic missions: 

 ———————————– 

 Go to Angel Pine, which is located in southeast area of the main map. In the 

 northeast part of Angel Pine is a medical building with an Ambulance next to it. 

 Get in it and start the missions. All the victims will appear in the city, which 

 is very small. The farthest person will only be about ten seconds away from the 

 drop off point. You can complete the missions in less then ten minutes by doing 

 this. Also, the cops do not appear very often, allowing your wanted level to remain 

 low. Additionally, do the Paramedic mission in the Angel Pine area. Start the 

 missions. 

 

 All injured people that must be taken to the hospital will be in the crowded town. 

 Unlike the fire truck missions if done in this town, this mission has all the people 

 in one place. Once you complete this mission, you will your health increased to 150. 

 This is a also very good reward because you can jump from the highest place in the 

 game without dying from the fall. Note: If you have the parachute in your inventory, 

 you will die. 

 

 

 Pimping missions bonus: 

 ———————– 

 Steal the pimp convertible in the car wash parking lot near the Pay N’Spray and 

 start the pimping missions. Successfully complete level 10 of the pimping missions 

 to get money from prostitutes instead of paying them. 

 

 

 Quarry missions bonus: 

 ———————- 

 Successfully complete level 7 of the Quarry missions to get the Hunter Quarry asset 

 and Quarry Mission time-trials. 

 

 

 Taxi missions bonus: 

 ——————– 

 Steal a taxi and start the taxi missions. After a total of 50 successful fares, 

 you will unlock hydraulics and nitrous on all taxi-class vehicles. After using 

 nitrous, you must wait awhile between shots. However, that time decreases as your 

 driving skill increases.

 level 12 of the vigilante missions to get an armor limit of 150. 

 

 

 Easily complete vigilante missions: 

 ———————————– 

 Use the Rhino to complete the vigilante missions easier. Additionally, start the 

 mission, put the vehicle in your garage, and exit so that the door closes. Enable 

 the“Destroy all cars”code. The criminals will be killed. Run back to the garage, 

 hop in the car, and repeat. This is also a good way to quickly gain more money and 

 status points. 

 

 Get an FBI Rancher and drive onto the Julius Thruway in Las Venturas. Start 

 Vigilante mode and begin driving around the highway. Just stay on the highway, 

 and you will notice that the criminals start dying for no apparent reason. Just 

 drive for about twenty minutes to get the 150 armor award easily. 

 

 Increase respect, money, driving skill and armor in vigilante missions 

 Enable the“Spawn Rhino tank”code and use it for the vigilante missions. When you 

 reach level 12, your armor will increase to 150. Each time you kill a group of 

 criminals, you will get money (on level 20 and over you will be winning $50,000 

 or more). If you get a wanted level, do not cheat to lower it. As police ram you, 

 they will explode and your respect will increase. All the driving that you will 

 do increases your driving skill somewhat. 

 

 

 Horseshoe bonus: 

 —————- 

 Collect all fifty horseshoes in Las Venturas to get a M4, MP5, combat shotgun, 

 and satchel charges to appear at the Four Dragons Casino. 

 

 

 Oyster bonus: 

 ————- 

 Collect all fifty oysters to increase your sex appeal and lung capacity. Note: 

 To find the oysters faster, get a Sea Sparrow (which can land on water). You 

 can find one by the Sherman Dam. 

 

 

 Racing bonus: 

 ————- 

 Get first place in all races at the four racing locations across San Andreas 

 (marked with a checkered flag on the map/radar) to win $1,000,000. 

 

 

 Snapshot bonus: 

 ————— 

 Take all fifty snapshots in San Fierro to get a sniper rifle, Micro SMG, shotgun, 

 and grenades to appear at your San Fierro garage. 

 

 

 Tag bonus: 

 ———- 

 Spray all one hundred hidden tags in Los Santos to get an AK-47, Tec-9, Sawn-off 

 shotgun, and Molotov cocktails to appear inside your house on Grove Street. 

 

 

 100% game completion bonuses: 

 —————————– 

 Successfully complete the game with a 100% game completion. CJ will get a stats 

 boost, extra money, and a Rhino and Hydra will be delivered to CJ’s house on Grove 

 Street. 

 

 

 Increase muscle or stamina: 

 ————————— 

 At about 22:00, go to a gym and work out, maxing yourself. After you have worked 

 out enough for the day, wait another minute until the time is 0:00. Max yourself 

 out for that day then go home. Save two or three times and you can repeat this 

 process. 

 

 To get your character maxed out in the muscle and stamina attributes, do the 

 following. Go the gym near the Johnson house. Work out until you are told that 

 it is enough for one day. Go home (right down the block), save the game to 

 advance to the next day. Return to the gym and you can work out again. You can 

 now max out your muscle and stamina in less then a half hour. 

 

 

 Increase weapon skill: 

 ———————- 

 Achieve a high wanted level and go into a restaurant. Shoot everyone with the 

 weapon that you want to raise in rank. If you walk around and wait, police will 

 spawn, but will not shoot you. Police can raise your weapon skill faster than 

 pedestrians. This works best in Burger Shot because of the wide area that you 

 can walk around in. Continue until you reach Hitman status. 

 

 Use the following trick in front of any safe house. Use the gun you want to get 

 up to Hitman status to repeatedly shoot a car until it explodes. Then, go to the 

 next car. Repeat this until you reach Hitman status for that weapon. Watch out 

 for the police. You can shoot them, then keep shooting the cars. When you are 

 almost dead, enter your safe house and save the game. Your health will be restored 

 and wanted level removed. 

 

 Get lots of bullets for the guns that you want Hitman or Gangster status for. 

 Go to Tierra Robada. Look around at the north of the island to find a little house. 

 Stay in there and enable the“Increase wanted level”code three times. Stay in the 

 cabin and wait for the police to approach. When they enter the house, kill them. 

 

 To attain Hitman level quicker, select your desired weapon and go to a Pay‘N’ 

 Spray. Park your vehicle directly next to the Pay‘N’Spray. Exit the vehicle and 

 repeatedly shoot people, cars, and cops. When your wanted level is raised to two 

 stars or above, run to your vehicle and drive into the Pay‘N’Spray to cancel it. 

 If your vehicle is not damaged, the respray is free. Wait for the wanted stars to 

 stop flashing, then start shooting people again. 

 

 Go into a police station and find a room with one entry point, and something that 

 you can hide behind (like a desk). Take out your weapon. You should now have a 

 two star wanted level. Shoot any cop who comes through the door. Every cop you 

 shoot makes your gun skill go up by about five. Do this until you either die, run 

 out of bullets, or enable the“Lower wanted level”code. 

 

 

 Increase driving skill: 

 ———————– 

 Go to San Fierro and pass the tests at the driving school. Additionally, find a 

 tractor or a slow moving car. Drive the roads without going as fast as you can 

 (move slowly). This will take awhile, but will increase your driving skills. 

 

 

 Increase underwater skill: 

 ————————– 

 Repeatedly swim underwater to increase your lung capacity and your underwater skill. 

 

 

 Easily max Lung Capacity: 

 ————————- 

 Dive underwater, and once your breath is out, you will start losing health. If 

 you want to stay underwater, keep enabling the“Armor, health, money, and street 

 creds”code when your health is low. You will be able to remain underwater, and 

 max your Lung Capacity attribute easily. 

 

 

 Raising stats quicker: 

 ———————- 

 Go to any pier over any body of water. Swim under the pier and stay in one position. 

 This will immensely raise your muscle, stamina, and lung capacity in just under a 

 minute. Stay under longer for better results. 

 

 

 Return to land faster: 

 ———————- 

 If you get stuck in the water, enable the“Spawn Hotring Racer”then“Spawn 

 Jetpack”codes. It will not appear until you are on a non watery surface. Quickly 

 jump on the car. It may be a far ride, but it is better than swimming. 

 

 

 Unlock areas quickly: 

 ——————— 

 Enable the“Wanted level never increases”code. Go to the shaded areas of the 

 game and they will become unlocked. If you go to a safe house and save the game, 

 all areas will be unlocked from now on. However, in order not to be wanted when 

 you go back into these areas, you must enable the“Wanted level never increases” 

 code again, but you will be free to roam about. 

 

 

 Revealing territories: 

 ———————- 

 Get a plane and fly all the way to either the southeast, southwest, northeast, 

 or northwest of the map where the ocean is found. Keep flying for thirty minutes 

 in that direction, then jump out of the plane. Do not open the parachute and 

 intentionally drown. When you arrive at the hospital, check your map. You will 

 see that there are enormous amounts of new territories in San Fierro, Las Venturas, 

 and some in Las Santos. You can take over these territories, and they only have 

 one wave. 

 

 

 Quick map fill in Los Santos: 

 —————————– 

 To get all of the map showing in the starting area of the game, get on the freeway 

 and continue going until you cannot go further. Then, pause the game and the entire 

 bottom right half of the map should be marked as explored. 

 

 

 Gain respect: 

 ————- 

 To gain respect, stay in your neighborhood and get a wanted star, then kill all 

 the police that arrives. Once you reach a four star wanted level (and if you killed 

 enough police), you will gain some respect. Additionally, completing missions is 

 not the only way to earn respect. By spraying other gang’s tags, you will also 

 earn a bit, and by taking over another gang’s area you will earn a lot. 

 Note: You must have completed some missions before you can take over areas. You 

 can see on the radar witch areas you have taken over, and which areas the enemy 

 gangs own. Your own territory is marked with green, and your enemies are yellow 

 or purple. 

 

 

 Respect status: 

 ————— 

 Your respect is made up of the following factors: 

 

 Running Respect (see below): 40% 

 Mission Progress: 36% 

 Territory Under Control: 6% 

 Money: 6% 

 Fitness: 4% 

 Clothes: 4% 

 Girlfriend Progress: 4% 

 Your Running Respect is changed by the following factors: 

 

 Territory gained: +30% 

 Killing a gang member: +.5% 

 Killing a dealer: +.005% 

 Killing a member of your gang: -.005% 

 A member of your gang is killed: -2% 

 Territory lost: -3% 

 Your respect affects the number of gang members that you can recruit: 

 

 Above  1%: 2 

 Above 10%: 3 

 Above 20%: 4 

 Above 40%: 5 

 Above 60%: 6 

 Above 80%: 7 

 

 

 Easy money: 

 ———– 

 Walk into a bar and beat up all the customers with a bat, nightstick, or pool cue. 

 More customers spawn and your wanted level will not rise. No one pulls out a gun, 

 and your maximum health will increase after a number of fights. Beating up the 

 person next to the pool tables gets you a pool cue, and every once in awhile a 

 customer will spill a few hundred dollars. 

 

 Find a save point that is close to a betting shop. The one in the Montgomery are 

 is ideal because it is near to the save point where you have to do the four 

 missions for Catalina. Save your game, then go to the betting shop and bet all 

 your money on a horse. It takes awhile to enter the numbers, but is worth it 

 because you can make a huge amount of cash (especially if you bet on horses with 

 odds of 10/1, 11/1, 12/1, etc.). It takes roughly three to four minutes to bet 

 the maximum amount of money, which is $9,999,995. You will not win every time. 

 When you lose, reload your last saved game. It is possible to get $250,000,000 by 

 betting your winnings of $30,000 to $700.000 to $2,000,000 to the maximum bet. 

 

 Enable the“Deadly vehicle”and“Flying cars”codes. When you are up in the air, 

 fly down to the ground and hit it to get money for a unique trick. The higher you 

 go and hit the ground, the more money you can make. You can also deactivate the 

 code while in the air and hit the ground to make a lot of money. 

 

 Enable the“Flying cars”code. Fly around for a few seconds, then touch the ground. 

 You will get money for insane stunts. 

 

 

 Easy Hitman rating: 

 ——————- 

 Shoot at the black part of a wheel. If you shoot at the rim it will not work. 

 Keep on shooting until the skill bar is all the way up for the desired weapon. 

 

 

 Easy dual sawn-off shotgun ability: 

 ———————————– 

 It is recommended that you spray all 100 tags, as it is easier for ammunition 

 and early on missions. Get a cop car (preferably a car, OT truck, rancher, etc.). 

 Save it in the Johnson family garage; save the game if desired. Get a large amount 

 of sawn-off shotgun ammunition. If all 100 tags were sprayed, it is available in 

 Johnson kitchen. Go to the garage. Get as far away from the car as possible without 

 letting the garage door close. Then crouch, aim for the grill of the police car, 

 and shoot. Every few shots (or every time the car catches fire), you should have 

 more weapon skill. It will eventually upgrade about every minute. When it catches 

 on fire, let the garage repair the car and come back. This does not work as well 

 at getting Hitman on the other weapons. 

 

 

 Easy money in Los Santos: 

 ————————- 

 From the Johnson house in the Ganton area, go straight until you are in the front 

 yard of the house opposite of yours. Turn right, and go behind it by going between 

 that house and the one next to it. Go in the backyard until you are in the corner. 

 You should see a pistol. Take it, then get back to Grove Street. If you see man, 

 usually in black, that is standing there with his arms crossed, shoot him. 

 He usually carries about $2,000 or more and a pistol, because he is a drug dealer. 

 Repeat this to get easy money. Kill him quickly before he shoots you. It is 

 possible to get $50,000 in one day by doing this. 

 

 Upon exiting the Johnson house in Grove Street, walk straight toward the house 

 opposite of yours, which is the one that sometimes has the BMX bike in the front 

 yard, until you are in the grass. Go to your right between that house and the one 

 next to it. Walk toward the corner and get the pistol. Go back to Grove Street and 

 find a drug dealer. He is dressed in black with his hands crossed down at his hips. 

 You will know he is a drug dealer because if you face him, he will try to do 

 business. You will get a pop-up display in the top-right part of your screen on 

 how to respond to him, even though you cannot actually buy anything. If you shoot 

 and kill him, he drops $2,000 dollars or more, and a gun just like that one you 

 picked up. Note: He will shoot back—try to get a headshot. There is another 

 drug dealer that is wearing a white hooded sweatshirt that does the same thing. 

 He can usually be found up in the northeast part of Los Santos. You can find 

 these dealers all over Los Santos in the areas littered with gangs. 

 

 Go to the building with the parachute. When you get to the top, spawn a Caddy. 

 Get in and drive slowly towards the edge of the building, then just fall off. 

 You will begin to flip slowly. However, if you nudge the edge of the building, 

 the Caddy will spin and flip like crazy. When you hit the ground, you will get a 

 very large insane stunt bonus. 

 

 Find the Inside Track Betting building in the Downtown area. Bet the maximum 

 amount on the horse with the worst odds. If you lose, reload the game and try 

 again. When you win, it will be a substantial amount. 

 

 Go to the Pig Pen Strip Club. You can jump on the big stage with the srtipper. 

 Stand directly in front of her, and people will throw $100 to her each time, 

 which you can collect. Be very careful not to touch her, or the guards will 

 start shooting at you. Note: This cheat takes awhile—eat before you go. 

 

 Get a weapon, then stand outside the your house in the Ganton area. Shoot your 

 homies (wearing green). Some of them will drop a lot of money. Pick it up, and 

 if you have a wanted level go inside and save the game. Repeat this to get a 

 large amount of money. 

 

 This trick requires maximum bike skill for both motorcycles and a regular bike. 

 Go to the highest building in Los Santos, the circular one, and jump off using 

 either the motorcycle or bike. While you are in mid-air, you can spin for a 

 little bit or try to do a back flip. Stay on the bikes until you land and you 

 will receive an insane stunt bonus for over $200. 

 

 Enable the“Kinky theme”code and enter the Ganton area with a nice car. 

 Drive up the alley were the burglar truck is located. Park there and within 

 seconds prostitutes will approach. Press Left to accept their offer, then get 

 out of your car and kill them when they are done. You will get more money than 

 paid. 

 

 Easy Stamina upgrade in Los Santos: 

 Go to the Ganton Gym in Los Santos. Go to the bicycle and start at level 1. 

 Work your way up to level 10. After awhile it will say that you have worked 

 to your limit and to return. Keep pedaling and your stamina will start to 

 increase. 

 

 Use the following trick to get a lot of weapons, increase your muscle, 

 increase your stamina, and get a“Hitman”rating with any weapon. After the 

 initial mission, go to the Verona beach area (on the south part of the map 

 near the ocean). There is a free open gym here. Use it to increase your muscle 

 and stamina. when you need to eat, there is a free hot dog stand down the path 

 east of the gym, or just save the game at your house. To get“Hitman”status 

 with any gun, find the weapon of your choice and shoot people or cars. 

 Try going to any parking lot and shooting cars. It is easier and they respawn 

 if you ride a short distance away and return. You can get as much money as 

 desired doing the fire truck missions, then going to the off track betting 

 after getting at least $10,000. Bet 10% of your money on the last horse until 

 you win. If you lose too much money, reload your game and return. Repeat this 

 process until you have a good amount of money. 

 

 

 Easy weapons in Los Santos: 

 ————————— 

 Drive around and hit Ballas. When they are dead, pick up their guns then get 

 back in your car and find more. This will get you a lot of weapons very fast. 

 

 

 Easy Hitman rating in Los Santos: 

 ——————————— 

 This trick requires a controller in port two. To get an easy Hitman rating 

 for either the 9 mm pistol or shotgun, go to the Los Santos Police Department. 

 Note the two player icon across the street. Quickly enter the Police 

 Department. Run and ignore any cops shooting at you and get the armor in the 

 locker room. It is the first room on your right. There is an available pistol 

 in the room on the right, at the far end of the hall. Proceed to dispose of 

 the police using your pistol. If you need ammunition, the cops will drop a 

 gun after you kill them. Your weapon skill will quickly raise as you kill the 

 swarms of police that come after you. Continue shooting until your armor level 

 becomes low or is gone. Then, run to the far end of the police station hall, 

 down the stairs, and into the holding cells. In the middle cell is more armor. 

 Use it and continue your massacre until your armor is once again depleted. 

 Next, quickly run out of the door and across the street to the two player 

 icon. Start two player mode. Simply kill the second player and your wanted 

 level will be gone and your health will be refilled. Repeat this to gain 

 Hitman status or simply gain ammunition. Note: Hitman status with the pistols 

 will allow duel wielding, faster firing, improved accuracy, lock-on range 

 increased and faster strafing. There is also a shotgun hidden in the police 

 station in the room on your left as you enter, then to the room at the right 

 at the end of that one. The shotgun may not respawn as soon as you enter, 

 but in at least 60 seconds one should appear. You can use this available 

 shotgun to reach Hitman status with. Note: Hitman status with the shotgun 

 only gives you improved accuracy, move while firing, faster firing rate and 

 lock-on range increased—not duel wielding. Duel wielding can only be 

 achieved with the sawed-off shotgun. 

 

 To raise your weapon skills quickly, enter a dance club, such as the 

 “Alhambra”in the Idlewood area. Begin shooting people with the weapon 

 of your choice. Doing so during the afternoon or night hours (12:00 to 04:00) 

 greatly increases the amount of people that respawn in the club. Since so 

 many people spawn, you have a virtually limitless amount of people to“train” 

 with. Doing so however, raises your wanted level greatly. Enable the 

 “Lower wanted level”code or know where the police bribes are, as you will 

 need them. 

 

 Go to the actual beach part of the Verona Beach area. Start shooting with 

 the desired gun. The cops will arrive after awhile, but you can make them 

 go away or just kill them for more. Keep doing this until the desired gun 

 is at Hitman level. It is possible to get four weapons up to Hitman level 

 in about an hour. 

 

 Walk out from CJ’s house and make sure there a car in his garage. Use any 

 weapon to shoot the car in the garage until it catches on fire. Walk away 

 and let the garage close Then, open it and repeat the steps. You can do 

 this with any weapon to get an easy Hitman level. 

 

 Go into the bar near CJ’s house in the Ganton area. Kill everyone there 

 and try to get a two or three star wanted level. Start killing the police 

 that come through the door. When no one remains, turn around and look. 

 They should be there. 

 

 Go to your house in Grove Street. Start randomly killing people until 

 you have two star wanted level. Kill all the cops with any desired weapon. 

 Make sure you have armor on. When you have low health, save the game, then 

 repeat. 

 

 

 Easy races: 

 ———– 

 Before you enter a race, enable the“Cars fly away”code. During the countdown, 

 start entering the“Pedestrians riot”code, but do not press the final button 

 until they take off. Run over all the racers and ram their cars. 

 

 

 Easy Pilot license: 

 ——————- 

 Go to the airport in San Fierro and enable the“Spawn Jetpack”code. 

 Enter the Shamel jet and enable the“Speed up time”code. Fly it until a 

 message appears in the corner. Fly it for about five or ten more minutes 

 and you will have a pilot license without going to pilot school. Note: 

 Make sure you save the game. 

 

 

 Saving money: 

 ————- 

 Buy lots of ammunition for the Tec-9 which costs about $300. When you 

 have enough, buy one SMG. The game will transfer all your Tec-9 ammunition 

 into your SMG, saving you thousands of dollars. Note: This does not work 

 for the pistols, rifles, or thrown weapons. 

 

 

 Free Pay N’Spray: 

 —————— 

 Get a car that can be used for the pimping missions. Go to a Pay N’Spray. 

 When the door is closing, start the pimping missions. Then, deactivate the 

 missions after the door has closed and is re-opening. The door will open 

 again, giving you a free spray. You can repeat this as many times as desired. 

 

 

 Cheap car bomb: 

 ————— 

 Get a fast car or a motorcycle. Either shoot the vehicle or bang it up real 

 good. When it is on fire, jump out. This technique is also good for taking 

 over hoods quickly and easily. 

 

 

 Descend quickly: 

 —————- 

 When stuck at the top of a cliff or mountain and you need to go to the bottom, 

 do not bother going the long way around to get down safely. Instead, edge 

 yourself to the end of the cliff/mountain and slowly but surely you will 

 slide down the side and land safely at the bottom. 

 

 

 Lose weight quickly: 

 ——————– 

 If you want to lose weight quickly, enable the“Speed up time”code. 

 

 Jump off building with motorcycles or bikes in Los Santos

 building and two-wheeled vehicles. 

 

 

 Basketball Challenge mini-game: 

 ——————————- 

 Go to one of the basketball courts that have full courts and a chain link 

 fence round them. One of the hoops will have a basketball. Walk up to the 

 basketball and start playing. While playing basketball, start the Basketball 

 Challenge mini-game. A red marker will appear on the court. Run to the red 

 marker and shoot the ball. If you make the shot, the red marker will move 

 to a new spot on the court. The goal of the mini-game is to sink as many 

 shots as you can before time runs out. Each shot you make adds a few seconds 

 on to the clock. When time runs out, CJ will automatically resume playing 

 basketball. Your highest score will be recorded and shown the next time you 

 play the Basketball Challenge mini-game. 

 

 

 Play basketball in Los Santos: 

 —————————— 

 After completing the Taggin Up Turf mission, you can go beside Sweet’s house. 

 There will be a basketball court with a basketball in the middle. Walk up to 

 it and start playing basketball. Note: You can only play by yourself. 

 

 

 Play pool and arcade games in Los Santos: 

 —————————————– 

 Go out of CJ’s neighborhood in Ganton. At night, you will see a bar with 

 beer bottles flashing on top of it. It is next to the bridge. Go inside the 

 bar, and there will be a man next to the pool table. Walk up to him and play 

 a game of pool. You can also bet money on the game. There are also arcade 

 games you can play in the bar. 

 

 

 Bet on horses: 

 ————– 

 Near the Downtown and Mulholland Intersection areas (under the highway, 

 next to the big parking lot), is a building called Inside Track Betting 

 (with red/pink/blue posters). The entrance is just in front of it, and 

 you can play a horse race game. You first bet on one of the horse to win, 

 then the amount of money. Afterwards you can see the race. 

 

 

 Vending machines: 

 —————– 

 When you find a vending machine that serves chips, zoom in on it with 

 a pistol or rifle. It is blurry, but you can tell that the chips inside 

 the machine are real-life brands. Some chips that can be easily identified 

 are Doritos, Lay’s Potato Chips, and Munchos, to name a few. 

 

 

 Breaking fences: 

 —————- 

 Walk up to a fence and either punch it or cut it with a chainsaw. 

 

 

 Climbing trees: 

 ————— 

 To climb a tree, find a ledge that will allow you to jump to the branches 

 at the top of a tree. If you hit them correctly, CJ should grab onto the 

 branches and allow you to pull him up. There is an easily accessible one 

 just outside of Glen Park Hospital to practice with. 

 

 

 Destroying cars quickly: 

 ———————— 

 To quickly blow up cars, shoot the gas tank. This is useful when killing 

 a lot of people at once. 

 

 

 Expand and shrink moon: 

 ———————– 

 Use a sniper rifle to shoot the moon to make it expand, then shrink in size. 

 

 

 Eating too much: 

 —————- 

 If you eat too much in a restaurant you will vomit on the floor and the 

 cashier will laugh at you. After this happens, you cannot eat again for a 

 while. 

 

 

 Effects of being fat: 

 ——————— 

 When you are fat, CJ will say different phrases. For example, when you are 

 fighting he will say“I got weight on my side,”or“I may be big, but I 

 ain’t slow”. The downside to being fat is that when your body fat meter 

 gets full, you run the risk of having a heart attack. This only happens in 

 very rare circumstances. You will return to the nearest hospital. Also, 

 if you have no muscle stat, or very little, you may not be able to climb 

 high walls or“super sprint”. When fat, CJ will waddle around like a penguin, 

 and if you look closely (this happens with no shirt) the fat on his body 

 will wobble. 

 

 

 Take a photo of yourself: 

 ————————- 

 Have the camera active as your current weapon, then target a member of your 

 own gang. Give them the camera and they will snap a picture of CJ. 

 

 

 Radio stations diss each other: 

 ——————————- 

 Listen to Radio Los Santos and K-DST. On Radio Los Santos, at times between 

 songs, Julio G. (station DJ) will make fun of the Playback FM DJ, saying 

 “Playback FM has some cool records, but the DJ is wack,”and Tommy“Nightmare” 

 Smith, (K-DST DJ) will make fun of the Radio X DJ, usually just before the 

 song“Running Down a Dream”. He will say,“You know, I can’t bear that chick 

 on Radio X, or is it Rock X, Rock…listen sweetheart, get over it.” 

 

 

 Radio shout-out from Denise: 

 —————————- 

 After you obtain Denise as you girlfriend after the Burning Desire mission, 

 listen to Radio Los Santos. At times between songs, Julio G. (the DJ) will 

 have a shout-out from Denise to you, and at the end he criticizes the shout 

 out by saying“I got a shout out from Denise in Ganton who says she misses 

 her boy desperately. And I quote, desperately. Hey, you know, this isn’t 

 Lonely Hearts, this is Radio Los Santos.” 

 

 

 Screensaver: 

 ———— 

 Allow the game to idle for a few minutes. The HUD will disappear and the game 

 will zoom in on other nearby people instead of CJ. 

 

 

 Wanted level officers, weapons, and vehicles: 

 ——————————————— 

 Depending on your wanted level, different law enforcement vehicles, officers, 

 and weapons will be used against you: 

 

 One star: Police officers on foot, in cars, and HPV1000s (police bikes) will 

 go after you. They have 9mms and nightsticks. If you do not have a gun out, 

 they will try to beat you with their nightsticks. If you have a gun out, they 

 will shoot. 

 

 Two stars: Police officers in cars and HPV1000s will come after you. They 

 will have 9mms and nightsticks, although they will not use their nightsticks. 

 They will shoot at you no matter what. If you are in a car, cops will drive 

 faster after you. 

 

 Three stars: Police officers in cars will go after you. They will have the 

 same weapons. Police choppers are now involved and shoot you from their guns. 

 Police cars will go fast enough to be able to keep up with you and roadblocks 

 will be in place at times, with officers shooting 9mms at your car. 

 

 Four stars: Cops in cars and SWAT officers will come after you in Enforcers 

 (SWAT vans). SWAT officers will now rappel from the police choppers. SWAT 

 officers are now in roadblocks and SWAT officers will have Micro SMGs. If 

 you are in an aircraft, a Hydra will go after you to shoot you down. 

 

 Five stars: FBI agents will go after you with FBI Ranchers. Most authorities 

 going after you will be the FBI; there will be less cop and SWAT cars. 

 The police chopper still goes after you, and the FBI will replace the 

 SWAT men in roadblocks. FBI agents carry SMGs. 

 

 Six stars: Military soldiers will go after you in Rhinos (tanks) and 

 Barracks trucks. They will replace the FBI in roadblocks. The army will 

 carry M4s. 

 

 

 Saving gang members: 

 ——————– 

 To save a gang member or bodyguard when you turn off the game, go to your 

 safe house. Go to your garage, run in the garage with your bodyguards. 

 Run out without your bodyguards, and then save the game. 

 

 

 Taking over gang territories easily: 

 ———————————— 

 An easy way to take over territories is to find a high place like a roof 

 top. First, kill a few gang members to start the war, then get onto a roof. 

 When you are up there, they will still shoot at you, but will not have 

 accurate aim and will miss frequently. 

 

 Note: It is recommended that the“Air Strip”missions be completed first. 

 To easily take over territories, go to the airstrip and take the Jetpack. 

 Go to any enemy territory and start a gang war by killing some enemy gang 

 members. Fly and land on any building roof you can easily see incoming 

 enemy gang members. Kill all gang members from up there. By doing this, 

 you can easily hold all enemy territories. Be patient when killing gang 

 members, and try to stay inside the war zone. The distance between the 

 airstrip and enemy territories is long, but this is the easiest way to 

 quickly and safely hold enemy gang territories. All territories can be 

 held by using the Jetpack, but only one by one. 

 

 

 Keep gang territory easily: 

 ————————— 

 If your gang turf is under attack, go to a save point and save the game. 

 When it is done saving, your turf will no longer be under attack and it 

 will still be yours. Additionally, when your hood is under attack, find 

 a police car or motorcycle, fire truck, ambulance, or taxi. Get in and 

 start the vehicle’s missions. Then, exit the missions and your hood will 

 be safe. 

 

 

 Gang member race: 

 —————– 

 You can do this trick in any race mission with the checkered flag on your 

 map. Bring a gang member with you. You can even bring three if the race 

 is with a four door car. Walk into the red mission circle. Select a race 

 and when it starts and counts down, you will see your gang member spawn 

 to the street and walk towards your car. The races will start, and you 

 must wait a moment before he gets in your car. 

 

 

 Manual aim with any weapon while driving: 

 —————————————– 

 Enable the“Manual weapon drive bys in cars”code and run out of bullets 

 in your Uzi, Tec-9, or Micro SMG. Get out of your vehicle, then select 

 the weapon of your choice (except grenades and rocket launchers). Get 

 back into the vehicle and enable any“Weapons”code. The crosshairs are 

 back on and you can shoot that weapon. 

 

 

 Hit pedestrian with the front of your shotgun: 

 ———————————————- 

 Note: This cannot be done with more than two weapons. Get a melee weapon 

 (baseball bat, dildo, or a police nightstick) and an ordinary shotgun. 

 If you have more than those two weapons this trick cannot be done. Switch 

 to your melee weapon. Walk up to a pedestrian and hit them, then immediately 

 switch to your shotgun. If done correctly, CJ should hit the pedestrian 

 with the shotgun as if he were using it as a melee weapon. 

 

 

 Roboi’s Food Mart asset in Los Santos: 

 ————————————– 

 Go to the 24-7 store located near the Conference Center area. Outside the 

 front parking lot will be a bike. Get on the bike and you will automatically 

 begin the courier missions, which require you to deliver packages thought

 three levels you will acquire the 24-7 store. Use the bike that was in front 

 of to collect up to $2,000. 

 

 

 Reach hidden areas in Los Santos: 

 ——————————— 

 Enter the Ganton Gym and spawn the Jetpack. Go over the arrow, out but do not 

 go out. Fly up through a blank tile. An all-black area will appear. Use the 

 thermal goggles to see all the people you have killed. You can also see an 

 illegal tattoo parlor, a tornado, a hidden city in your garage in San Fierro, 

 a tornadom and other things. Do not lose height or you will have to kill 

 yourself when you land. 

 

 

 Spray paint as a weapon: 

 ———————— 

 The spray paint is not only meant for spraying tags. It also can be used as 

 a weapon. Aim the spray paint in the direction of a pedestrian and they will 

 lean forward, coughing.

 will find a large purple dildo that can be used to hit people. There is 

 also a PR-24 (nightstick) in the police station as well. You can pick up the 

 dildo and the PR-24 without anything happening, but when you take the shotgun 

 you will get two stars on your wanted meter. 

 

 Go to the small town of Dillimore near Red County. Find the police station 

 with the garage opened up outside. Unequip your weapon and enter the police 

 station by walking over the entrance marker. Once inside, proceed into the 

 hallway ahead of you and take the first right into a locker room. In this l 

 ocker room will be body armor and a night stick. Keep walking behind the 

 locker room, and there will be an opening in the wall with a large walk-in 

 shower. Proceed into the shower and take an immediate right. You will see 

 a pink dildo spinning. You can pick this up as your melee weapon and begin 

 dildo-bashing people.

 Shotgun in Los Santos: 

 ———————- 

 When you rob the pizzeria with Ryder in the beginning of the game, instead

 for the shotgun. Note: This works better if you get the brass knuckles 

 found underneath the over pass near your hood.

 follow them south until they lead to a building with boxcars. 

 The complex can only be entered by jumping the wall, going through the 

 boxcar warehouse, or by an opening to the right of the warehouse. 

 The boxcar warehouse has a sawed-off shotgun (you will need a car to 

 get it) in one of the cars, a plank bridge that leads to body armor, 

 and gas grenades located at the back exit. A short distance away from 

 the back exit, you will see an entrance to another warehouse. This one 

 is full of crates. Go through the crates to find stairs. Behind the 

 stairs is an AK-47. Go up the stairs to find more body armor.

 Go to Los Santos International Airport, and use the“Spawn Jetpack” 

 code to reach the top of the communications tower. Once on the top, 

 there is a small circular platform with a thin platform around it, 

 with just enough room to stand on. Stand on it, and make sure it is 

 the border around the very top platform. Enable the“Spawn Rhino tank” 

 code. If done correctly, the tank will spawn and immediately ricochet 

 off the top and do multiple spins and somersaults in the air before 

 finally hitting the ground below. This can be very funny if done 

 correctly. 

 

 

 Gang members in house: 

 ———————- 

 Make a gang, with however many members as desired. Then, go inside 

 your house and press Up to call for your gang to follow. They cannot 

 go inside the house. Save the game. When you are done, they will be 

 standing in the kitchen. You can shoot them, punch them, or walk 

 through them with nothing happening to them. They will talk to you, 

 but they do not move and nothing hurts them. 

 

 

 Invincible zombie: 

 —————— 

 Find a cab driving around with a passenger. Note: This may also work with other 

 cars and your gang members. Take the car and drive it into water (best done at 

 the Glen Park area in Los Santos). Get out of the car as it is driving into the 

 water and go ashore, so you can see the passenger trying to swim. After a short 

 while he or she will be dead, still are trying to swim. Aim at the person and 

 the target will appear black, indicating that the person is dead. Fire at the 

 car’s gas tank to make it explode and send the person flying ashore. They will 

 now run around for awhile, then act like a normal person. However, they will be 

 invincible and will still be targeted black. 

 

 

 Zombie homies: 

 ————– 

 Wield a knife (tier 2 weapon), and walk up behind one of your fellow gang members. 

 Target him and press Up to recruit him into your posse. Before he can turn around, 

 cut his throat. Note that after you do so, he will fall to the ground quite 

 differently than the other members of the population. As soon as he hits the ground, 

 he will rise back up“from the dead”. 

 

 

 Moving fire: 

 ———— 

 Notice that when you use your flamethrower and are aimed at the floor, you create 

 a small flame or a few that expire in awhile. When they begin to arise, the fire 

 truck arrives and extinguishes the fire. To do this glitch, eat something beforehand 

 to prevent hunger. This may take some time. Do a fire line with your flamethrower of 

 at least four flames horizontally with no cops nearby (or they begin to chase you). 

 Keep watching the fire, centering by using the camera view, trying not to move CJ 

 nly if necessary. If the fire truck arrives to extinguish the fire, repeat this until 

 you get a whirlwind of fire of a decent size. When you get it, it cannot be 

 extinguished. If you keep it centered with the camera view and watch, after awhile 

 the fire truck leaves the fire alone. The fire physics are strange, but if you move 

 Right slowly and walk just a little bit, you can aim the fire. Keep doing this and 

 you can move it in a certain direction. Do not worry if the flames are close to you, 

 they do not cause damage until you move CJ to the flames. If there are pedestrians 

 walking to the flames ,they will not suffer any damage, even though they do not 

 runaway. However, vehicles can take damage. To make them explode they must be stopped 

 for a certain period of time. Try it on traffic lights or when another vehicle is 

 blocking the path. This is particularly useful on highways where cars travel at high 

 speed. There are multiple wrecks and you can wait to watch them all explode. 

 You will not get a wanted level for doing this. 

 

 

 Wear night vision goggles without their effect: 

 ———————————————– 

 Activate the night vision goggles and play any type of arcade game (They Came From 

 Uranus, etc.). When you exit the arcade game, CJ will still be wearing the goggles, 

 but their effect is not there. 

 

 

 Remote explosives go through door: 

 ———————————- 

 Buy some remote explosives at Ammu-Nation, then steal a car. Get out of the car and 

 throw one at the drivers door, then open the door. The explosive will stay in the 

 same place, and the door will go through it. 

 

 

 No explosion: 

 ————- 

 Go into Ammu-Nation. There will be a red circle to go into shooting practice. Get 

 close to that circle, then throw over twenty remote explosives at that door. Without 

 pressing the remote, step in the red circle. You will go to the target practice. 

 Complete round 1, then quit. When your out of target practice, notice there are no 

 explosives by the door, but you still have the remote. Press the remote. and there 

 will be no explosion. 

 

 

 Fall through ground in Flint County: 

 ———————————— 

 Go to Flint County. There should be a road to follow. Drive on it, and you will see 

 a wall that leads off the to the side. If you drive up and down that wall, you should 

 fall through the ground. You may have to do it a few times. You must hug the wall 

 for this glitch to occur. Additionally, go to your safe house in Prickle Pine. Enable 

 the“CJ jumps higher”code. Enter the safe house. Turn towards the entrance and jump 

 up. You should go over the wall and fall into blackness until you land in a field of 

 grey. In front of you should be an incomplete version of the are where you saved 

 Denise. Buildings will be missing, but you can physically touch them. You should 

 also see white letters that read“Ganton”,“North Rock”, and“Downtown”. Stand in 

 front of it and mark the Four Dragons Casino. Then, enable the“Spawn Jetpack” 

 code and fly it toward the casino. You should eventually see an armor pickup, a 

 uzi pickup, a pistol pickup, and a money pickup that contains $15,000 at most. You 

 should also see four white doors, but they have the wall physics around them. 

 

 

 Walk or drive underwater in Flint County: 

 —————————————– 

 Go to the bottom of the water at the end of the island in Flint county. Enable the 

 “Maximum lung capacity”code, then swim down to where you see two rocks and a large 

 starfish. Swim behind the biggest rock. Sooner or later, you will be able to walk 

 on the bottom of the ocean. You can spawn vehicles and fire weapons. 

 Note: Do not get out of the water or try to fly a plane or you will have to do this 

 all over. Also, if you go too close to shore or out too far, you will respawn on 

 the nearest island. This glitch may take a lot of time to do and requires patience. 

 

 

 Invisible spray paint in Los Santos: 

 ———————————— 

 When in CJ’s home, get the spray paint can from his bedroom. Go to his lobby and 

 spray in front off his mirror at a certain distance. You will not see the spray 

 in the mirror when spraying. 

 

 

 Missing gun in Los Santos: 

 ————————– 

 Have a gun capable of doing drive-bys and go on a date with Denise riding in a 

 motorcycle. If she asks if you want some“coffee”, say“Yes”. When you are done and 

 get back on your bike, you will not have the gun out. This will fix itself when you 

 get off the bike. 

 

 

 Fall through ground in Los Santos: 

 ———————————- 

 There is a property to buy directly above Madd Dogg’s mansion in the Mullholland 

 area. You do not have to have buy it; just go there. In the back is a waterless 

 pool and a wall on the east side. Walk up against it and you will fall through an 

 invisible wall and continue falling until you reappear back on the ground. You can 

 use the Jetpack to fly around in blue hell. 

 

 Go to the building where the mission“End Of The Line”took place, where you killed 

 Big Smoke. Note: This will not work after you complete the mission—you should be 

 playing a new file to do this. Get a car and ram the wall in the front. You should 

 either break the wall and go through or break the wall and get pushed back from the 

 impact. Then, drive in and you will fall through the ground and end up back on the 

 street. Sometimes your car will disappear when you get put back on the street. If 

 you walk in, you will fall but when you are put back on the street you will not 

 lose any health. 

 

 Go to the Ganton gym and park a car in the doorway, with the hood touching the door. 

 Get out, jump on the hood, and walk inside. Once inside, walk back out again. You 

 will appear in a hallway. Walk towards the wall, and you will fall through the world. 

 

 Walk behind the Mullholland safe house to the pool. Face the side that has five 

 windows. Walk into the one closest to the corner. If you do not automatically fall, 

 walk to where the iron support beams end. You will start falling. In a few seconds 

 you will land around the billboard that is in front of the Vinewood sign. 

 

 

 Fly under city in Los Santos: 

 —————————— 

 Go to the Ganton gym and park a car in the doorway, with the hood touching the door. 

 Get out, jump on the hood, and walk inside. Once inside, you will appear in a hallway. 

 Enable the“Spawn Jetpack”code and wear it. Walk towards the wall, and you will fall 

 a short distance, then be able to fly under the city. 

 

 

 C.J. dies dancing in Los Santos: 

 ——————————– 

 Enable the“Pedestrians riot”and“Pedestrians have weapons”codes. Enter the dance 

 club and start the dance challenge. During the dance, a pedestrian may have a rocket 

 launcher and start shooting. More people will come in and watch you dance. If the 

 pedestrians are too close, then you will be inflicted with damage from the rocket 

 launcher. If your damage has passed the point of making you wasted, when the dance 

 is over the message will appear stating that you can dance to a harder track. After 

 the message disappears, C.J. will drop to the floor dead. 

 

 

 Late death in Los Santos: 

 ————————- 

 Go to the police station (where there is a toll gate with a policeman standing next 

 to it). Hijack any police vehicle. Note: If you hijack a car or do a crime in that 

 area, this will not work. Then, go in front of the gate and wait for him to open it. 

 Once he does, go inside and go straight. Stay in your vehicle. Park next to the 

 garage door then get out of your vehicle. Once out, go next to the building and 

 your will see another booth next to the building. Go inside and kill the guard. 

 Then, kill the booth man next to the gate. Once this is done, go in the garage 

 through the fire exit. Then, go next to a policeman so that he points his gun at 

 you. He should say that he needs backup into his radio. Kill him with a gun. If 

 done correctly, he should be dead, but still standing. Once he gets off the radio, 

 he should fall down and die. 

 

 

 Fall through map in Red County: 

 ——————————- 

 Get a police bike, and go to the section of the tracks that leads to Red County if 

 you keep driving. Keep moving your bike against the right side so that it sparks 

 severely, but does not crash. After about 30 seconds, you should fall through the 

 map. The bike will fall and disappear, and CJ will appear somewhere on the map 

 randomly. 

 

 

 Walk through wall in Red County: 

 ——————————– 

 When you are by your house on the hills directly behind the“Vinewood”sign, go 

 behind the house where the pool is located. Walk over to the wall and go straight, 

 where another wall meets that wall. You will be able to walk through the wall, and 

 if you walk in the correcl location, you will fall and the“Loading”message will 

 appear. The game will place you on a road below the“Vinewood”sign. 

 

 

 Hospital underworld gateway in San Fierro: 

 —————————————— 

 Go to San Fierro’s hospital. There are two different buildings that are connected 

 by a walkway that is over the road. Go towards the western building (hospital) were 

 the cane is located. (where you get dropped off when you visit the hospital). To 

 your left should be an ambulance. Go towards the ambulance, and face the east 

 building“across the road”. As you look across the road, you will see doors and a 

 part of the building (hospital) that sticks out. Fly between the doors and the part 

 of the building that is sticking out to reach the gateway to get in the hospital 

 underworld. To get back to the real world, sink down to the endless pit. CJ will 

 respawn at the closest street. You can also fly though the opening of the hospital 

 where you first entered the underworld. 

 

 

 Climb a 100 ft. tree in Whetstone: 

 ———————————- 

 Located in the Back O Beyond area is a tree that is leaning over a swamp. CJ can 

 walk up the tree. Note: If you fall off, make sure you have completed the Paramedic 

 missions so that you do not die. 

 

 

 Strange water in Whetstone: 

 ————————— 

 Go to the Back O Beyond area. The swamp water there completely makes any vehicle 

 disappear, while in the water. 

 

 

 Falling pedestrians: 

 ——————– 

 Enable the“Recruit anyone into your gang”code. Recruit three pedestrians, then 

 get into an ambulance. Enable the“Flying cars”code and take off (best done from 

 your house). Gain altitude for about one minute, then start the ambulance missions. 

 Your pedestrians will bail out of the ambulance. 

 

 

 Walk on air: 

 ———— 

 When in a helicopter, fly above the giant bridge and try to land in the middle. The 

 helicopter will land in mid air, and you can get out and walk around in the air. 

 

 

 Die in air: 

 ———– 

 Note: This cannot be done if you completed all the missions in San Fierro. Spawn a 

 plane and a parachute. Fly north of San Fierro. Go over the bridge and to the land. 

 Then, go back and jump out and land on the thing with a parachute. Get that parachute 

 and jump towards San Fierro. Activate the parachute and CJ will die in the air. 

 

 

 Run underwater: 

 ————— 

 Start two player mode and get in a Leviathan helicopter. Land in the ocean. Have 

 the player in the passenger side hijack the driver. He will fall straight into the 

 ocean and be able to just walk around and shoot instead of swim. 

 

 

 Swim in first person view: 

 ————————– 

 Get a rocket launcher or sniper rifle and go near a body of water. Jump in, and 

 before you hit the water, aim and hold it. You should be in the aiming mode of 

 that gun. This also works with other guns. 

 

 

 Floating breasts: 

 —————– 

 Start two player mode and choose the prostitute. Enable the“Spawn Jetpack”code 

 and turn the camera towards her. 

 

 

 Change song on radio: 

 ——————— 

 While in any vehicle except for anything involving the law (police, army or 

 ambulance), set it on any radio station you desire. Then, enable the“Spawn 

 Jetpack”code. If done correctly, the last song that was playing on that radio 

 station should be different. CJ will also be wearing a Jetpack inside the car, 

 and his legs will be going through the bottom. 

 

 

 Dancing Packer: 

 ————— 

 Find a Packer. Move Down so that the railing moves up. Then, get out and walk up 

 the ramp. You will either do one of two things. You will stop but remain walking 

 (if this happens, jump); or you will walk straight. As soon as you get under the 

 top ramp, the packer will do some crazy things, such as tilt so that only one side 

 of tires is touching the ground. 

 

 

 Invincible car: 

 ————— 

 Steal a car, drive it to a safe location, and get out of it. Attach a remote bomb 

 to the hood. Get back into the car and any car you hit with the one you are driving 

 will explode. Your car will not sustain any damage and you will not lose any health. 

 

 

 Invincible flaming car: 

 ———————– 

 Enable the“Deadly vehicle”code. Get in a car then get out and have a few vehicles 

 hit it. The car should start smoking and erupt into flames. Get in the car and it will 

 remain flaming, but will not explode. 

 

 

 Car falls through ocean bottom: 

 ——————————- 

 Enable the“Maximum lung capacity”code. Get in any vehicle and drive into the ocean. 

 You will slowly sink. Remain in car and it will get dark as you go further down. You 

 will go through the ocean bottom. Stay in car and you will sink for about thirty more 

 seconds before respawning near the closest road to the ocean. 

 

 

 Tree through car: 

 —————– 

 This is best done when at a location with a tree that can be knocked down and a 

 store you can enter. Get a car and drive it into the tree. This should knock it 

 down. Park the car directly over where the tree once stood. Enter the store by 

 using the yellow upside down triangle, then exit. The tree will now be sticking 

 out of your car. 

 

 

 Decapitated CJ: 

 ————— 

 After obtaining a katana, find a two player icon and activate multi-player mode. 

 Have player two decapitate CJ. Exit out of two player mode, and CJ will have no 

 head. Additionally, play in two player mode with Denise and have the other player 

 cut off your head. You will lose the mission, but then can continue playing without 

 a head and bleed forever. 

 

 

 Stuck playing basketball: 

 ————————- 

 While in the Jetpack, if you play basketball you will get stuck and have to re-load 

 the game. 

 

 

 Sub Urban turns into Ammu-Nation: 

 ——————————— 

 While at any Sub Urban store, take out a camera and zoom in on the mirror that is 

 close to the changing area. The mirror will disappear, and you can see the interior 

 of an Ammu-Nation. 

 

 

 Late cashier death: 

 ——————- 

 When at a fast food restaurant (such as Cluckin’Bell or Well Stacked Pizza), have 

 a gun with you (preferably a pistol), Go into a corner and aim. Walk up to the 

 counter and put the cross-hairs on the cashier’s head. Shoot the cashier, and wait. 

 The cashier should back up with their hands raised, say something, then fall to 

 the floor. Note: This best done at Cluckin’Bell. 

 

 

 T Bone in two places at once in Mike Toreno mission: 

 —————————————————- 

 Drive the car into the water and swim away. T Bone will be still in the car, but 

 will not die. Get another car, ignoring the“You left T Bone behind”message. Drive 

 to the airport. While going there, you can still hear T Bone talking. As you arrive, 

 shoot at the targets and watch the intermission sequence featuring T Bone getting 

 Mike Toreno out. 

 

 

 Floating guns in Wrong Side Of The Tracks mission: 

 ————————————————– 

 There are four Latino gang members on top of the train that you have must catch 

 and kill. They have guns that they will shoot you with. Fail the mission inten- 

 tionally, then find the train that they where on. Instead of gang members, you 

 will see instead see floating guns that move and fire at you; they are invincible. 

 

 

 Flying fish: 

 ———— 

 Get a rocket or grenade launcher and go near a river or beach with fish. Shoot 

 the fish with a rocket or grenade. The fish will fly out of the water and swim 

 around in mid air. 

 

 Go to any beach area. Swim a little bit underwater to find a school of fish, 

 dolphin, or turtle in the shallow parts. Get back to the beach where you are 

 neck deep in the water, but still able to use a weapon. Aim the rocket launcher 

 in the part of water where you last saw the aforementioned aquatic life. Fire 

 off a few rockets. If all goes well, you should see a splash on the surface of 

 the water and whatever you shot will come out and start flying around in the 

 air. 

 

 

 Flying Tanker: 

 ————– 

 Steal a Tractor, and grab onto a Tanker (tractor-trailer truck/18 wheeler). Back 

 up to the front of the Tanker and latch on to it. Drive forward, then turn sharply 

 into circles. The Tanker should go flying through the air. This may require several 

 attempts. 

 

 

 Misspelling in Los Santos: 

 ————————– 

 In Downtown Los Santos, there is an Atrium. (you fight inside it in Big Smoke’s 

 mission, Just Business). There are two entrances; a front and a side. When you 

 enter the front door, the corner display correctly shows“Atrium”. However, if 

 you enter the side door, the corner display shows that you entered the“Attrium”. 

 

 

 Misspelling in San Fierro: 

 ————————– 

 In San Fierro, the gym is called“Cobra Marital Arts”instead of“Cobra Martial 

 Arts”. 

 

 

 Jump through window in Las Venturas: 

 ———————————— 

 Near the safehouse where your girlfriend Millie lives (directly east from the 

 Abandoned AC Tower; costs $50,000) are windows that you can jump through. Climb 

 the wall beside the house and jump on the roof. You can go through the windows. 

 You can see your garage, shoot people through the window, and if you get a wanted 

 level of 2 or more, can get policemen trapped in your garage. Be careful; when 

 you jump through the window and want to get out you must step back from the 

 window and jump until you can cling onto it, then climb back up. 

 

 

 Wrong casino name in Las Venturas: 

 ———————————- 

 Check the map that was included with the game. Look in Las Venturas near the 

 casino entitled“The Clown’s Pocket.”This casino cannot be found, because it 

 is named“The Ringmaster”on this map. However, in the game it is called“The 

 Clown’s Pocket.” 

 

 

 CJ spontaneously combusts in Whetstone: 

 ————————————— 

 Go to the level area of ground at the peak of Mt. Chiliad, where the mountain 

 bike race is located. Take out a rocket launcher. Aim at the Mountain Bike. The 

 green reticule will home in on the bike. Fire at the bike and blow it up. Then, 

 aim at the bike again, manually. Note: The second time around, the reticule will 

 not automatically aim on the“wreckage”of the bike. When you fire a second 

 missile at the bike, CJ will catch fire. You can be 30 feet away and still catch 

 fire. Also, the same effect has occurs when firing a missile at the bike to 

 “blow it up”, then shooting it with a sniper rifle. However when using the rifle 

 it will usually require two or three rounds before CJ catches on fire. 

 

 

 Feet appear through bottom of car: 

 ———————————- 

 Enter a car and enable the“Spawn Jetpack”code. Your feet will appear through 

 the bottom of the car. This also works with planes and helicopters. With bikes, 

 CJ will appear to be standing up on the bike. 

 

 

 Bicycle catches on fire: 

 ———————— 

 If a bicycle is upside down, it will catch on fire. However, it is very difficult 

 to get bicycle to stay upside down. 

 

 

 Lowrider remains in position: 

 —————————– 

 Get a lowrider with hydraulics. Put the car in any hydraulic position desired. 

 While holding the car in that direction, get out. You can see the car remain 

 that way. For example, have the back of the car raised in the air. 

 

 

 Lowrider lights: 

 —————- 

 When in a lowrider at night, look at the headlights and bounce the car up and 

 down. Notice that the lights on the ground stay in one location while the lights 

 on the car move up and down. 

 

 

 Buy hotdogs from dead vendor in Los Santos: 

 ——————————————- 

 Go to the end of the pier with a Ferris wheel. Enable the“Weapons”code and 

 obtain a rocket launcher. Find the hot dog stand at the far end. Shoot it with 

 a rocket launcher. Jump in the water under the pier, and you should see the 

 stand floating in the water. You can still buy hotdogs, even the vendor is dead. 

 

 

 Wrong restaurant name: 

 ———————- 

 Go to the Cluckin’Bell. Take out a sniper rifle and look at the cups hanging 

 on the wall. They say“Burger Shot”. 

 

 

 Wrong dialogue in Los Santos: 

 —————————– 

 During the Reuniting The Families mission, the police helicopter announces that 

 they are the“Los Angeles Police Department”instead of the“Los Santos Police 

 Department”. 

 

 

 Camera in Los Santos: 

 ——————— 

 Go in CJ’s bedroom. There will be a camera beside the bed. Also, once you complete 

 a certain mission, there will also be a can of spray paint in there. 

 

 

 Reaching other cities early: 

 —————————- 

 Hijack the train. The easiest way to do this is when it is at one of the stations. 

 Then, drive it full speed to the bridges to the other islands. You may need to use 

 the entire city to pick up enough speed. Also, you must be careful around sharp 

 turns. The train will de-rail. Note: This was done with the freight train. When 

 you approach the bridge at the edge of the city, you will slow down, even if you 

 are going very fast. The train will pass through the barricade, as if it were a 

 ghost. You will get a four star wanted level. There is a police bribe on the train 

 tracks in the second city that you will pick up if you pass by it on the train, but 

 your wanted level will immediately jump back to four stars. Also, the train is 

 bullet proof. You cannot die from bullets when inside the train. 

 

 When in Los Santos, you will find that all bridges to the other two regions will 

 be blocked by blockades. Sometimes if you try to go through the blockade at high 

 speed with a fast vehicle, it will go through and glitch, along with the AI 

 vehicles that are following. 

 

 Enable the“Wanted level never increases”and“Flying car”codes. You can now go 

 to all of San Andreas without the four star wanted level appearing. 

 Note: This must be done again every time you load a saved game. Also, if you 

 shoot cops with the“Wanted level never increases”code enabled, some cops will 

 get out and walk away but others will fire their guns at you. 

 

 The following is a multi-step process which may take some time to get correct. 

 Get the parachute located on top of the very tall building a few blocks from 

 the police station in downtown Los Santos. The building is shaped circular 

 inside and“L”shaped on your map. Walk around to the northeast corner of the 

 circular building and step into the yellow triangle to get the parachute that 

 is on the roof. Take it, and keep it (do not switch to a weapon). Go back 

 down and get armor from the police station. It is nearby and has two sets. 

 Do not draw a weapon in the station or you will get a two star wanted level. 

 Next, get the jet at LSX, the airport at Los Santos. Drive up to the gate, 

 climb up on your car, and onto the guard booth, and climb over into the airport. 

 Walk back around to the gate. It will open, and you can get your car and drive 

 back in. Then, find the jet. It is called the Shamal and is located at the end 

 of the runway. Take off and get some practice flying, diving, climbing, rolling, 

 etc. Next, choose a location on your map that you want to go. You can use the 

 map screen to pin that location on the radar. For example, choose the Binco 

 store in Las Venturas. It is next to the Las Venturas airport and the highway. 

 Once you pass the city line, you will get four stars on your wanted meter. 

 Because you are in the air, they will try to shoot you down with missiles. 

 Notice the two red blips on your radar that are fast approaching. Dive, climb, 

 and roll and the missiles will miss. Do not forget to keep your eye on your 

 target. Once you are over your target and are very high, exit the plane. You 

 will drop straight down. You must be high enough for your parachute to open 

 or you die when you hit the ground. When you are safely on the ground, start 

 running. If you chose to go to Binco or another store, notice that you can go 

 inside and buy clothes. If you buy clothes, you will get rid of the four stars 

 wanted level, as long as you remain in the store. Once you step outside, the 

 four stars will return to your wanted meter. 

 

 

 Reach other cities early in Los Santos: 

 ————————————— 

 Use the following trick to get to the other cities before their freeway 

 entrances are actually open. Go to any bridge that connects the start of 

 city of Los Santos to any of the closed cities. Jump into the water that is 

 under that bridge and swim across. When you get far enough, you will have a 

 four star wanted rating. Once you get on land, get a vehicle as soon as 

 possible. Note: You cannot use bribe icons or the Pay N’Spray to decrease 

 this wanted rating. 

 

 

 Fly plane without pilot license: 

 ——————————– 

 Go to either Los Santos or Las Vatos airport. Go to the place that you 

 would enter if you had a pilot license. If you try to get in the gate, 

 it will say you cannot unless you have the license. Next to the gate is 

 a small building. You will need a small car or any type of bike (BMX, 

 bike, motorcycles, etc.). Stand on top of it and jump on top of the 

 building. Jump off and you should see a fence (at Los Santos Airport). 

 Climb the fence and you will see a Dodo plane. Also, if you follow the 

 runway east, you will see a small jet that is unlocked. At Las Vatos, 

 follow the same procedure. After you jump off of the building, just walk 

 around and look for a plane. Note: All but one of the aircraft at San 

 Fereno’s airport are locked. 

 

 After using the“Fly plane without pilot license”trick at the Los 

 Santos airport, go forward you should see a Dodo airplane. Get in and 

 take a right when inside the plane. Go straight, then take a right at 

 the runway. Go down it until you see a jet on the right. It is not on 

 the runway. You can get out of the Dodo and get in the jet. You can now 

 fly the jet wherever desired. However, be careful—if you go out of 

 your territory you will get four stars and jets will shoot missiles at 

 you. Try to dodge them if possible. 

 

 Go to the Los Santos airport and get to the place that you would enter 

 if you had a pilot license. If you try to get in the gate, it will say 

 you cannot unless you have the license. Next to the gate is a small 

 building. You will need a small car or any type of bike (BMX, bike, 

 motorcycles, etc.). Stand on top of it and jump on top of the building. 

 After you jump off of the building, just walk around and look for a plane. 

 

 To get into the Los Santos airport without a pilots license go all the 

 way south until you reach a tunnel. On the south side of the tunnel, 

 look along the fence line of the airport. Notice how the sidewalk has 

 an incline. Walk up the incline and climb up the ledge where the bottom 

 of the fence starts. Turn towards the ramp sign and jump across. You 

 should grab onto the sign. Then, climb up on top of it, turn towards the 

 fence, and jump. You should jump across and grab the fence. CJ will pull 

 himself up and over, and you will be in the airport. 

 

 To access Los Santos International airport early, get a large van and 

 hop over the fence where the guard tells you that you need a pilots 

 license. You can also get any car and hop over the fence around the 

 corner from the guard. Once inside, you will have to hop another fence, 

 then you will find a Dodo. If you go a little further inside near the 

 runway, you will find a jet. 

 

 Go to either the Los Santos airport and get to the place that you would 

 enter if you had a pilot license. If you try to get in the gate, it will 

 say you cannot unless you have the license. Next to the gate is a small 

 building. You will need a small car or any type of bike (BMX, bike, 

 motorcycles, etc.). Stand on top of it and jump on top of the building. 

 After you jump off of the building, just walk around and look for a plane. 

 

 Walk up to the airport gate in San Fierro, touching it. Then, walk along 

 the side of the gate into the corner were the fence bends (keeping in 

 contact with the gate) and walk back into the middle of the gate. It will 

 slide open. You must start in the middle and walk to whichever side the 

 gate will slide open to. For example, if the gates on the left, walk to 

 the left. If it does not work at first, keep trying. 

 

 

 Parachute in Los Santos: 

 ———————— 

 In the Downtown area (near the three way highway section and the red 

 line where the train is passing on your map), you will see a tall 

 circular building with blue/white glass windows. The entrance (with the 

 yellow triangle) is just in the front of it. Enter it, and you will go 

 to the roof of the building where you can find a parachute. Take it, 

 jump down from the roof, and open the parachute. Use Left to control it. 

 Note: You must wait a short time until the parachute respawns back on 

 the roof. 

 

 

 Parachute in San Fierro: 

 ———————— 

 Go to the Downtown area. Find the very big building. Out front, there a 

 sign that reads“No base jumping”. Go to the yellow triangle and you will 

 go to the top. You will automatically get a parachute. This jump lets you 

 fall a long way before opening the parachute. Note: You can only jump once, 

 unless you die. 

 

 After you unlock Mt. Chiliad in the Whetstone area, take a Sanchez to the 

 top of the mountain. Once at the very top, look for a mobile home, and a 

 van. Behind them is a parachute. Pick it up, then look for the ramp by 

 the flag. Driver very fast and jump off. After a few seconds in the air, 

 jump off the bike, then deploy your parachute, or you can wait to do some 

 free falling. You can also jump off of some high buildings, and out of 

 airplanes. 

 

 There is another parachute on the top of the mountain (by the two vehicles). 

 You can fly the Dodo up there, take off, and jump out of the plane whenever 

 you desire. Then, open the parachute. By the time you get back to the 

 mountain, another parachute will have respawned. Note: Sometimes when you 

 jump out of the plane, it will not explode, even from that altitude. 

 

 Unless you have a license, do the“Fly plane without pilot license”trick 

 to get a plane or helicopter early. Fly to the top of Mt. Chiliad. On the 

 east side where campers are parked, there will be rocks. There should be 

 a parachute on those rocks. 

 

 If you ride to the top of Mt. Chiliad, you will find yet another parachute 

 location as well as a Bmx bike race marathon as well as a speed ramp which 

 you can use to fly of the mountain if desired. 

 

 Use the Jetpack to reach the very top of the northernmost tower of the 

 bridge leading from San Fierro to Tierra Robada to find a parachute to 

 skydive with. 

 

 

 Skydiving: 

 ———- 

 Go to any airport. Look for a yellow arrow at the entrances of the airport 

 where you can buy a ticket to another city. Buy the ticket and start the 

 flight. Do not skip the flight. Wait for the airplane to take off and get 

 high in the air. Jump out of the airplane with a parachute and begin 

 skydiving. Open the parachute when you want and float down. There are also 

 other places you can skydive, such as the tall building in the Downtown 

 area of Los Santos, and off the top of Mt. Chiliad. Additionally, to get 

 a parachute very easily, get into any type of flying vehicle, except the 

 Jetpack. You will instantly receive a parachute. If you fly high into the 

 air, then jump out of your plane or helicopter, the parachute will 

 automatically be switched into your weapon inventory. 

 

 

 Skydive longer: 

 ————— 

 Enable the“Cars fly away”code. Go to any airport and hit any aircraft. 

 Then, enter that craft. All you have to do is steer. Soon the height meter 

 will just stay up. You will get to fly higher than normal when you do this. 

 Fly as high as you desired, then Jump out for a long trip back to earth.

 After recruiting Zero, stop at his shop and complete all his missions. 

 You will be awarded with a $ spot where you can periodically claim free 

 money. Note: You can also make more money at Zero’s place by doing an 

 extra mission (after you have already completed all the missions to get 

 the shop as an asset). Go to the back room in the shop and step into the 

 red marker to trigger a mission where you use the RC Baron to destroy 

 Berkely’s shipping vans. For each van you destroy, you will get money. 

 There is a time limit for each time you play the mission. You can replay 

 this mission as many times as desired. 

 

 

 Bomb valet parking in San Fierro: 

 ——————————— 

 Go to the valet parking hotel without your uniform and stand next to 

 the valets. When a vehicle drives up, enable the“Weapons (tier 3)” 

 code and plant a bomb on the car that is about to be parked . When 

 the valet enters the vehicle, do not use the remote. Do it as soon as 

 he reaches the parking garage. The car and the valet are toast. 

 

 

 Stealing from valet parking in San Fierro: 

 —————————————— 

 Go to the valet parking hotel without your uniform. Stand next to the 

 valets. When a car drives up, quickly get in and drive off slowly. 

 The valet will begin to chase you . If he is very close to the car, 

 get out, and let him get in . As soon as he does that, quickly pull 

 him out and he will say“I am parking a car here”. As soon as he says 

 that, get back into the car and drive off. The valet will not chase 

 you anymore. 

 

 

 Military vehicles in San Fierro: 

 ——————————– 

 Near the port in San Fierro there will be a naval base. If you quickly 

 enter the compound and drive around, you will eventually find a 

 military truck and Patriot vehicle. Note: Once you enter the compound 

 of the naval base, you will get a five star wanted level. 

 

 

 Baseball bat in San Fierro: 

 ————————— 

 You can find a baseball bat at the baseball diamond in San Fierro 

 at home plate, across the street from Zero’s RC Shop. 

 

 

 Chain gun in San Fierro: 

 ———————— 

 There is a chain gun on Point Kinclad (big red train tracks in San 

 Fierro). Take a helicopter or the Jetpack and fly onto the first arch 

 leaving San Fierro to go to Las Venturas to find it. 

 

 

 Flamethrower and pool stick in San Fierro: 

 —————————————— 

 In the Doherty area, go behind your garage to find a construction area 

 (marked brown on the map). Go to the building just left of the road on 

 the brown area. Under a broken ramp is a flamethrower and pool stick. 

 

 

 Guided rocket launcher in San Fierro: 

 ————————————- 

 Go to the airport and from where the two helicopters spawn, go to 

 the left. There will be two little buildings near the water. To the 

 right of one of them will be propane tanks. In between two of them 

 will be a lock on rocket launcher. 

 

 

 Shooting gallery in San Fierro: 

 ——————————- 

 Go to your gas station safe house. Find the trolley tracks (not the 

 train tracks) in the middle of the road in front of the safe house. 

 Enable the“Spawn Jetpack”code and wait for the trolley to pass by. 

 Once it does, fly into the air and land on top of it. Then, take off 

 your Jetpack. Enable any“Weapons”code and start killing pedestrians. 

 Once the cops start chasing you, you will notice that when they try 

 to ram you, the trolley will not get damaged, and is actually invincible. 

 You will be able to drive through the town and use it like a giant 

 shooting gallery. There is no need to worry if the military starts 

 chasing you. The trolley car can ram right through the tanks, sometimes 

 flipping them over. If your health gets low (you can still be shot by 

 pedestrian cops), enable the“Health, armor, and money”code. This 

 trick allows you to live a surprisingly long time while being hunted 

 down by the feds. To enhance your experience, you can also enable the 

 “Pedestrians riot”,“Pedestrians with guns”,“Aggressive traffic”and 

 “Lower wanted level”codes, then relax and watch the havoc unfold 

 around you all from the safety and comfort of a big red trolley car. 

 

 

 Fling Bulldozer around in San Fierro: 

 ————————————- 

 Go to the construction yard near San Fierro. Go past the crane and 

 turn left after the first hangar. Behind that, you will see a towtruck, 

 Get in and drive towards the Bulldozer. Hook up the Bull Dozer. Drive 

 up the hill to where there is an open area. Then, turn very sharp to 

 either the left or the right. The Bulldozer will fling around, pulling 

 the tow truck with it. For even more fun, get three or more tow trucks 

 and hook them all up into a line. With three or more, the Bulldozer 

 acts like a ball and chain flailing around. 

 

 

 Fall off building and live in San Fierro: 

 —————————————– 

 Go to the Big Pointy Building (the one with a parachute) in the 

 Downtown area and jump off. Open your parachute and land. Go back 

 up to the top. This time, you will not get a parachute. Jump off. 

 Before you hit the ground, you will hit the side of the building 

 and slide down. When you are close to the ground, you should hit 

 one of the many slanted poles that hold up the building. This will 

 slow you down enough so that you only lose about one sixth of your 

 health. Note: Sometimes you will not hit a slanted pole and lose 

 more health or die. 

 

 

 Gant Bridge message in San Fierro: 

 ———————————- 

 Note: This works best if you unlocked the Jet Pack or an expert at 

 landing helicopters. Go to the Gant Bridge and fly up to the very 

 top. Go the very top cable line piece that is horizontal, is south 

 on the Gant Bridge, and is the closest to San Fierro. Fly up to the 

 very top and look at the cable that is vertical to see a sign that 

 reads“There are no Easter Eggs up here. Go Away”. 

 

 

 Easy money in Las Venturas: 

 ————————— 

 Go to the strip club. Stand in front of one of the dancers and wait 

 until somebody throws money at them. CJ will automatically pick it 

 up and say a comment as in“How thoughtful”. Leave the game like this 

 for about an hour or two and your money should have increased 

 significantly by the time you return. 

 

 

 Burger Shot asset in Las Venturas: 

 ———————————- 

 Some of the Burger Shots have a timed delivery mission where you must 

 send packages on a Faggio. Complete them to gain that restaurant as 

 an asset. 

 

 

 Secret government agency base in Las Venturas: 

 ———————————————- 

 Get in any land or air vehicle and drive or fly to the abandoned 

 air field in the region of Las Venturas. To the south from here, 

 there is a little area that is a“no fly zone”. If flown over, a 

 mysterious five star wanted level will appear. This is because the 

 area is a government agency secret base that holds several heavy and 

 speedy army vehicles. You can also find this area in the middle part 

 of the region of Las Venturas on the map included with the game. 

 

 

 Tear gas in Las Venturas: 

 ————————- 

 Go to the AT 400′s hanger at the airport. There is a building with 

 cars nearby. You will see a can which looks like spray paint. When 

 you use it, C.J. does not choke. It is not very strong, but will choke 

 pedestrians. 

 

 

 Sex shop in mirror in Las Venturas: 

 ———————————– 

 In the tattoo parlor, kill the owner and pull out a camera. Zoom 

 in fully into the mirror. You will be able to see the sex shop across 

 the street. 

 

 

 Suicidal pedestrians in Las Venturas: 

 ————————————- 

 Find the gym in the Redsands East area. It is parallel to a bomb shop 

 called“Weddings&amp;Weldings”. There is an alley next to the shop. 

 Go into it and stand on the eastern wall of the bomb shop. Look in 

 the northeastern direction to see a tall white building. If you stand 

 in the correct location, you can see pedestrians spawning on the lower 

 roof and falling off. You can run up to a pedestrian after they have 

 fallen, but you cannot stand underneath the roof and wait for them to 

 fall on you; they only spawn from a certain distance. 

 

 

 Hunter Quarry asset in Bone County: 

 ———————————– 

 Successfully complete all seven quarry missions to get it as an asset, 

 where you can collect money. 

 

 

 Extra car storage space in Bone County: 

 ————————————— 

 Once you have purchased the abandoned airfield in the Verdtant Meadows 

 area, locate the massive garage directly opposite the house that is 

 there. It may not look like a garage as it is a hanger for airplanes, 

 but it is a perfect location to store a large number of cars. 

 

 

 Volcano effect in Bone County: 

 —————————— 

 Find the geyser in Bone County. Shoot a rocket at it and it will 

 turn into a volcano. 

 

 

 Area 69 in Bone County: 

 ———————– 

 Get in any land or air vehicle and drive or fly to the abandoned air 

 field in the region of Las Venturas. To the south from here, there 

 is a little area that is a“no fly zone”. If flown over, a mysterious 

 five star wanted level will appear. This is because the area is a 

 government agency secret base that holds several heavy and speedy 

 army vehicles. You can also find this area in the middle part of the 

 region of Las Venturas on the map included with the game. 

 

 Use the following trick to enter Area 69 without the law on you. 

 Find Barbara (a girl you can date) in a town north of San Fierro and 

 Tierra Robada. Start dating her. After you get your dating percent 

 up to 100%, you will receive a police uniform. Go to a safe house 

 and put it on. Get in a police car or Ranger police SUV (recommended). 

 You can now drive into the base and get several things, such as 

 different types of guns. You can also get a chopper called the 

 Cargobob. You can also get Patriots, Rhinos, and Hydra fighter jets. 

 

 

 Go underground in Area 69 in Bone County: 

 —————————————– 

 Do the underworld glitch (at the Vinewood safehouse head north from 

 Madd Dogg’s) and fly to Area 69. Find the underground complex. Find 

 the area where you get the Black Project, and you should see an empty 

 long hollow room next to it. It should have red boxes at the top of 

 the“silo”. Fly underneath the empty silo then fly to the top of the 

 silo. You should see a“cage”where the room is of the red boxes. 

 Try to take off your Jetpack. When you do, you should land in the 

 Black Project area or the rooms around there. Note: To do the underworld 

 glitch, find the safe house pool. Fly the Jetpack into the corner of 

 the safe house. Then, fly to Area 69. Also, bring weapons and armor 

 because the SAPD officers spawn down there. 

 

 

 Huge air in Bone County: 

 ———————— 

 Go to the Arco De Oste area with a fast car. Go up the mountain until 

 you see either a mine shaft or a wooden track. Follow the track back 

 to the mine shaft then turn around and follow the wood track until 

 you go off a jump. If done correctly, you should be able to clear 

 the Sherman Reservoir. 

 

 

 Machine Gun in Red County: 

 ————————– 

 Go to the town of Blueberry. Behind a wall is a machine gun. 

 

 

 Easy money in Whetstone: 

 ———————— 

 Go to the top of Mt. Chiliad and go behind the RVs. Pick up the 

 parachute and get on the mountain bike, which will start a challenge. 

 Go off the ramp to the right and get off of your bike in mid-air. 

 Pull the parachute and you will not hit the ground, but instead be 

 put back on the bike with the chute still open. You can keep going 

 off the ramp repeatedly to get as much money as desired. 

 

 Go to the top of Mt. Chiliad. There should be cars, a bike, and a 

 parachute. Get on the mountain bike and it will start a mission. 

 Instead of doing the mission, go forward and you should see a flag 

 with a ramp next to it. Get on the bike, go very fast, and jump off 

 the ramp. Once you are going down, the screen should blur. Do not 

 jump off the bike; just keep going and you should respawn back on 

 the mountain. You will get an insane jump bonus for about $300. 

 Repeat this to get as much money as desired. 

 

 

 Climb Mt. Chiliad faster in Whetstone: 

 ————————————– 

 Get a BMX bike and go to Mt. Chiliad. Ride up the mountain (not on the road). 

 Tap as hard as you can with the BMX bike, and you will be able to climb 

 the mountain faster. 

 

 

 Never fall off your bike in Whetstone: 

 ————————————– 

 Go to the top of Mt. Chiliad. Get the parachute and get on the mountain 

 bike at the correct time for the bicycle race challenge. Make sure that 

 the parachute is your current weapon before the race starts. When the 

 race begins, do not go through the checkpoints. There will be a ramp on 

 the left side with a flag beside it. Cycle there and jump off the mountain 

 with your bike as soon a s the race starts. When CJ is in the air with the 

 mountain bike, jump off the bike. Then while in the air, open your parachute. 

 You must do this quickly before CJ is put to the race track again. 

 However, once you open the parachute in the air, CJ will be put on the 

 race track again, with him riding a bike. However, this time you will 

 have a parachute opened while riding your BMX, and CJ will not be holding 

 the bike’s handlebars. He will instead be holding the parachute. You can 

 now go downhill at any angle and at any speed without falling off the bike. 

 Note: You must end the race to take your bike elsewhere. If you try to jump 

 off the cliff again while you have the parachute, you will appear on the 

 track without any parachute. Once you finish the race with your parachute 

 on you, you can go anywhere with it. You can enable the“Massive bunny 

 hops”code and jump as high as desired and land at any angle without falling. 

 Note: Make sure you do this before you get on the bike. Getting off your 

 bike will release the parachute; if you try to do any awkward stunts you 

 might fall. You will not fall unless you release the parachute. Get 

 off the bike to release the parachute. 

 

 

 Infinite nitrous: 

 —————– 

 Activate the nitrous in a car and put it inside your garage. While the 

 nitrous is still activated, shoot the car until it explodes, then allow 

 the garage door to close. When the door opens again, the nitrous will 

 always remain activated in that car. 

 

 

 Quick nitrous refill: 

 ——————— 

 Leave your car, then immediately re-enter it. Your nitrous will be back 

 at full. 

 

 

 Better handling motorcycle: 

 ————————— 

 To get better handling on street bikes, get on one and enable the“Spawn 

 Jetpack”code. You will be able to make turns at full speed without crashing. 

 Note: The Jetpack will disappear when you get off the bike. 

 

 

 Exceed garage limit: 

 ——————– 

 When you want to park a car in a garage but the game states that you cannot 

 store another vehicle, you drive the car near the garage and get out. Then, 

 hop in the car and drive in. 

 

 

 Finding your car after getting busted: 

 ————————————– 

 If you been arrested, go down to the police parking lot. Walk around without 

 a weapon. Eventually, you will find your car. 

 

 

 Stealing locked cars: 

 ——————— 

 Some cars have locked doors so you cannot steal them (such as cop cars and 

 your first girlfriend’s Hustler). However, getting them into a garage will 

 unlock the doors. You can either push a car into the garage or get a Tow 

 Truck or a Tractor to tow them. Additionally, to get in a locked vehicle 

 with someone inside (for example, a Combine Harvester), shoot the person 

 in the head and the door will fling open, allowing you drive it away. 

 

 Find a Tow Truck (for example, at the dump in Mt. Chiliad) and drive to 

 where the locked car is located. Hook the locked car onto the Tow Truck 

 and tow it into your garage. Let the garage close. When you open the 

 garage again, the locked car should be unlocked. This is easier then 

 pushing it into your garage. 

 

 If you try to open a car and it is locked, go far from it, then return. 

 The color of the car should be different and the doors should be unlocked. 

 

 If someone has locked their car doors, and you shoot them out, be careful 

 not to get out before you reach your garage. Otherwise, the doors will 

 stay locked. 

 

 

 Keep aircraft from races: 

 ————————- 

 Enter the races at the Las Venturas Airport. Select the race with the 

 airplane you desire, then ignore the race and instead take it back to your 

 airstrip and park it in your own big hangar. You will fail the mission, but 

 can re-do it. Once you get back to your airstrip and look in your hanger, 

 your airplane will be there. Save the game to keep it. 

 

 

 Recommended hydraulic cars: 

 ————————— 

 The Landstalker and Tahoma are by far one of the highest bouncing vehicles 

 on the game (with lots of practice). If you cannot find one of tem on the 

 streets with hydraulics, take one to the Loco shop. 

 

 

 AT-400: 

 ——- 

 Find the large single hanger at the end of the main runway at the Las 

 Venturas airport. Approach it and it will open. The AT-400 jumbo jet 

 will be inside at certain times. It can climb to the highest altitude 

 possible in the game. 

 

 Go to the northeastern part of the Las Venturas airport, where a huge 

 hanger with a green door is located. When you walk up to it, the door 

 will open downward to reveal an AT-400 airliner. When you see it, there 

 will be a platform to the left of the plane that you can go on. When you 

 get onto the platform, go to the plane and enter it and fly around. 

 

 

 Bandito: 

 ——– 

 Go to the small sandy beach in San Fierro. When on the beach, you should 

 see a small pier or dock. Go on the left side of the pier look around the 

 corner to find a Bandito. Additionally, the Bandito spawns on the very west 

 side of the map, at the Ocean Flats area of San Fierro. Go to where there 

 is a pier. On the left side of the pier will be a Bandito. This is a 

 buggy-type vehicle that is very good off-road. You can also find a Bandito 

 at Ocean Flats area of San Fierro, close to Palisades. 

 

 Collect 15 vehicles for the Import/Export dock to get the Bandito. 

 

 Banshee: 

 Go to Las Ventura and look on The Strip to find the Banshee. Additionally, 

 a Banshee can always be found parked by the Gym in the Garcia area of San 

 Fierro. Face the gym’s door, then turn right. 

 

 Beagle: 

 This airplane can be found at the airports at San Fierro and Las Venturas. 

 

 BF Injection: 

 Finish in first place at the Dirt Ring race at the stadium in Las 

 Venturas to get the BF Injection. Additionally, you can find a BF 

 Injection at the opposite end of the same beach where you can also 

 find the Bandito in San Fierro. 

 

 Bloodring Banger: 

 Get your total time up to one minute in the Bloodring. 

 

 Big jump with Bicycle: 

 While on a bike, pedal at full speed at an oncoming car. Bunny 

 hop onto the hood and you will launch yourself in the air. 

 

 Create ball and chain with Bulldozer: 

 Go to the construction yard near San Fierro. Go past the crane 

 and turn left after the first hangar. Behind that, you will see 

 a towtruck, Get in and drive towards the Bulldozer. Hook up the 

 Bull Dozer. Drive up the hill to where there is an open area. 

 Then, turn very sharp to either the left or the right. The Bulldozer 

 will fling around, pulling the tow truck with it. For even more 

 fun, get three or more tow trucks and hook them all up into a line. 

 With three or more, the Bulldozer acts like a ball and chain flailing 

 around. 

 

 Bullet: 

 Successfully complete driving school with at least all silver awards 

 to unlock the Bullet. Alternately, look for the burger shop in the 

 Juniper Hollow area in the north part of San Fierro, west of the 

 church. The Bullet is located in the parking lot right across 

 from the entrance. 

 

 Successfully complete the Import/Export missions (30 vehicles). 

 The Bullet will be available for import after you have delivered 

 all cars to the Green Basin Harbor. 

 

 A Bullet can always be found parked by the D. Flour Bakery in 

 the Doherty area of San Fierro. 

 

 From the hideout in Doherty (abandoned gas station below the 

 construction site), take a right turn onto the street. Take the 

 first left turn (it slopes down a hill). Wind down the hill and 

 take the first right turn. A Bullet is behind the stone wall. 

 The entrance is at the base of the hill on the left. An alternate 

 way is to wind down the hill and take the second right turn. Get 

 out of the car. Go through the archway on your right and go up the 

 stairs. The Bullet will be directly in front of you, as well as a 

 police bribe. 

 

 

 Keep Taxi light on: 

 ——————- 

 Use the following trick to keep the“Taxi”light on and not have 

 to pick up passengers. Steal a taxi and start the missions. Then, 

 immediately end the missions. The light will stay on. For a better 

 effect, try this at night. 

 

 

 Cargobob Helicopter: 

 ——————– 

 Go to the restricted area in Bone County. Inside you will find 

 a Cargobob helicopter, Rhino tanks and a Patriot. If you go to 

 the center of base you will find a steel vent on the ground. 

 Destroy it, and you can go inside and turn off the SAM sites 

 surrounding the base. You should now be able to fly out in the 

 chopper. Alternately, go to KACC Military Fuels at the top of 

 Las Venturas. Note: You need a Patriot to do this trick. If you 

 have done the mission for the Heist strand called Up, Up, and 

 Away, this is the location of KACC Military Fuels. Once there, 

 take your Patriot and drive through the front gates. No one is 

 there, and you will not get shot. Note: If it does not let you 

 through, take a ramp truck and put it near the gate. Then, run 

 up it and jump the fence. Once you are inside, get out of your 

 vehicle, go to your left, and go inside the hangar (round building) 

 and walk through to the other end. You will end up back outside. 

 Once you are outside in the back of the Military Fuels area, make 

 a right and run towards the stairs that you see. Walk up those 

 stairs, and when you get to the top, the Cargobob will be on the 

 heli-pad. Get in it without any stars or police after you. 

 To make this easier, just take a plane there and parachute out. 

 However, make sure to land on the helipad. 

 

 The Cargobob Helicopter can also be found where you found the 

 Levitation in the mission for Woozie, at the military fueling 

 area. It not too far from the Twin Dragon Casino. You will 

 probably need another flying vehicle to get into the fueling area. 

 

 

 Cheetah: 

 ——– 

 Go to Las Ventura and look on The Strip to find the Cheetah. 

 

 

 Clover: 

 ——- 

 Go to the Jefferson Motel in the Jefferson area of Los Santos. Go 

 west to the split in the road then go on the road to the left. 

 Immediately afterwards you can see a lot on the left decorated with 

 triangular banners and surrounded with a fence. This is the Coutt 

 and Shutz dealership. A Clover will be in the lot, along with a Tampa 

 and Perennial. If none of those cars are there, drive around and the 

 cars will spawn there. Additionally, go to the Pig Pen Strip Club in 

 East Los Santos. There will be an intersection on the southeast 

 corner of the club’s parking lot. Drive south on north-south road

 Gifts in Dating missions: 

 ————————- 

 The purple dildo found in the police station can also be used as a gift for a 

 girlfriend. It takes the place of the flowers. Flowers can be found at almost 

 any gas station. They are always accepted from girlfriends, unlike the dildo 

 which sometimes may be rejected. 

 

 

 Girls’tastes in Dating missions: 

 ——————————— 

 The girls you date have different tastes in you. They will comment on your looks. 

 For example, one girl likes you to be about 50% fat. 

 

 

 Jealousy in Dating missions: 

 —————————- 

 Be careful when dating other women. For example, if you take Barbara out on a 

 date, Denise may show up in her car and start chasing you. It also lowers your 

 status with the particular woman you are currently with. 

 

 

 8-Track mission: 

 —————- 

 Enable the“Slow motion”code and you will be able to easily take first place. 

 This is helpful if you are trying to get the Monster Truck. 

 

 

 Air Raid mission: 

 —————– 

 Enable the“Slow motion”code to get a better shot at the RC planes. Enable the 

 “Destroy all cars”code repeatedly to pass the mission. 

 

 

 Are You Going To San Fierro? mission: 

 ————————————- 

 Instead of burning the weed with the flamethrower, use the rocket launcher and 

 shoot the crops; it will destroy them much easier. 

 

 

 Badlands mission: 

 —————– 

 Get to the mountain top and blow up the snitch’s car. He will jump off the side 

 of the mountain, committing suicide. Enable the“Spawn Jetpack”code and go down 

 there. Take a picture of him. Take the picture back to the drop point. By doing 

 this, you will not have to chase him back down the mountain on the dirtbike. 

 Additionally, enable the“Spawn Jetpack”code. Fly up the mountain, near the top 

 of the cabin. Do not let the guards see you. Choose the silenced pistol. Enter 

 through the back of the cabin and shoot the snitch. Be prepared to fight it out 

 with the FBI if you get caught. You can now snap a photo of the dead snitch 

 without chasing him. It is important to watch the guards’movement before 

 attempting this. 

 

 

 Beat The Cock mission: 

 ———————- 

 This is a triathlon. Go to Santa Maria beach in Los Santos and wait until 

 the weekend. Then, go to the lighthouse. You will see a little red marker 

 which will start the mission. Note: You must be in very good shape to win. 

 The reward is $10,000. Also, next to Palomino Creek is a beach that is part 

 of Fisher’s Lagoon. The one attached to that is part of Palomino Creek 

 (if you are looking on a map it is the second largest of them all, and 

 has a dock). Go to it. On there will be a red circle. Enter it to start 

 the mission. You should have full muscle and stamina because it is a 

 swimming race. If you have good stats, you will complete the mission. 

 

 

 Black Project mission: 

 ———————- 

 This mission starts after a number of Torino missions. Truth is upset 

 with you working with Torino. He abandons you on a road. You are getting 

 into Area 69 and must bring back the Black Project. You must go to the 

 control tower and open the blast doors. You have to avoid the searchlights, 

 but not shoot out more than two of them. You have thermal goggles to see 

 the guards. You must get in before 5:30 a.m. You will begin near body armor 

 if you do not have any. There are guards at mid-level on all of the light 

 towers, plus many that are walking around. Try sniping everybody so that 

 you are not spotted. If you do get spotted, you are told to use a vent to 

 get into the building. In any case, there is armor up on the control tower 

 to replenish with, and a red spot to use to open up the blast doors. 

 The blast doors are in the center of the mound. The vent is marked nearby 

 and you can shoot your way in through the grates. There is a health waiting 

 for you inside that room (with the blast doors on the other wall). 

 Go through the hallway and shoot the guards at the other end. There is 

 armor up and to the right in here. There is also a minigun there. This 

 area has bulletproof glass, so you are safe. Go downstairs to the little 

 opening (not the red path to the left). Shoot out more guards in here. 

 At the end of the path is armor. Then, take a right and another right and 

 you can see a radar room. Disable the SAM site. Then, go downstairs and 

 over to the yellow striped area. There is a grate below you. Go to the 

 end where the grate is up and go in for the health and armor that is down 

 there. Move along, as there are more enemies to kill. Then move left– 

 they say that there is a keycard. Get the armor then touch the scientist 

 to get his keycard. Follow him down the path to the left and you will be 

 in a giant cylinder building. Work your way down all of the stairs, 

 shooting as you go. Get the Jetpack and fly out, heading for the triangle. 

 You can fire a weapon while flying, but you really do not have to. Truth 

 takes it from you, takes off, and abandons you there. 

 

 

 Body Harvest mission: 

 ——————— 

 Take a bike to the farm and ride to the back of the farm using an indirect 

 route, bypassing the survivalists in the fields and tractors. Quickly steal 

 the harvester, then run over the survivalists that are on foot between you 

 and the road back. Try to overturn the pickups that are in your way. If 

 they are still following you on the road, do a drive by when one is next 

 to you to kill the gunman on the truck bed. The Harvester can take quite 

 a bit of damage. Hit the pickup until it catches on fire, then get away. 

 

 

 Burglary missions: 

 —————— 

 In the Ganton area of Los Santos, go towards the gym that is just a block 

 south of the Binco store and the bar. Across the street from the gym and 

 to the south, you should see a van parked next to a house. It is a boxcar. 

 After 20:00, jump in and you can go on burglary missions until sunrise. 

 

 Go to CJ’s garage in San Fierro. Look behind it, and there should be a 

 construction site. Behind the structures of broken down buildings in 

 front of you, there should be an abandoned building with a lop-sided 

 sign that reads“Harry Plumbs”just north of the“Turning Tricks Advanced 

 Driving School”. Look to the right of that building to find an alleyway. 

 Walk into the alleyway and look to the right. There should be a black van 

 parked there. Get in sometime before 20:00 and find a nice house you 

 think will make a nice profit. Wait until 20:00, then start the burglary 

 missions; you can do the missions until 06:00. Note: When dropping off 

 the cargo, you will return to the garage next to the alleyway that you 

 found the van at. 

 

 Steal any burglary van you know of, and travel to any city of your choice. 

 Proceed as usual, and after you have steak the goods, a yellow blip will 

 appear on your map. Pause game play and look at the map. You will see that 

 the blip has jumped from the city you stole the van in, to the city you 

 are currently at. For example, if you steal the van in Los Santos and go 

 to Las Venturas and trigger the burglary missions, the yellow blip will 

 appear in las Venturas, close behind“The Camel’s Toe”Casino. 

 

 To commit burglaries in San Fierro, go to the Doherty area. Go to the 

 building that has a big sign board, reading“Hairy Plumbs”. It is opposite 

 the driving school. Go around the back of the building to find the van. 

 

 

 Infinite time in Burglary missions: 

 ———————————– 

 Enable the“Always 21:00″code, then find the van. Additionally, enable the 

 “Always 21:00″and“Wanted level never increases”codes. Find a Boxville and 

 initiate a burglary mission. You should now have as much time as desired to 

 do the mission, and the cops will never chase you if you wake up the people 

 in the houses. 

 

 

 Catalyst mission: 

 —————– 

 When you reach the train, do not bother getting out of your car. Drive 

 around the pinned down Groves and run into the Vagos. Drive into the train 

 tunnel to turn around if needed. After all the ones on the ground are killed, 

 exit the car and shoot the one on the train. Then, get back into your car 

 and run over the arriving Ballas. If your car begins smoking, park it next to 

 the Ballas car to create an explosion that should kill them all. Then, get on 

 the train as instructed. Quickly toss the ammo crates to Ryder. There is an 

 unlimited number of them onboard so you do not have to waste time getting a 

 perfect target. You may want to change the“Invert Look Controls”setting 

 to make this less confusing. Remember to change the setting back after all 

 the crates are tossed. 

 

 

 Cleaning The Hood mission: 

 ————————– 

 Do not bother using fighting moves on the crack dealer outside. A single 

 shot from your pistol will bring him down. Once inside the crack den, use 

 the pistol again to take down the targets quickly. Note: Shoot the man with 

 the bat first. 

 

 

 Cop Wheels mission: 

 ——————- 

 Any police motorcycles will not work. You must steal the ones that the game 

 marks for you. 

 

 

 Da Nang Thang mission: 

 ———————- 

 When the helicopter gets shot down and you are in the water, do not swim to 

 the ship. Instead, swim to shore, steal a car, and drive to Ammu-Nation to 

 buy weapons and armor. Then, go to the ship. The mission is a lot easier 

 with an AK-47 in your inventory. 

 

 

 Drive-By mission: 

 —————– 

 After approaching each group of targets, just continue to drive around the 

 block normally. There is no reason to damage your car trying to reverse or 

 spin back around. The targets do not run far. Simply drive normally around 

 the block until your partners can start shooting them again. With the last 

 group of Balla’s, drive your car down the path and through the tunnel to 

 run them over. Turn around and repeat until they are all dead. Note: Since 

 this mission is not timed, you can drive carefully to a Pay N’Spray between 

 drive-bys to get your car’s health bar restored. You will eventually have 

 to go to the Pay N’Spray anyway at the end of the mission to lower your 

 wanted level. Note: That visit will be complimentary, but any others will 

 be charged. 

 

 

 Drive Thru mission: 

 ——————- 

 Try to get in front of the Ballas car and trap it into a wall or building. 

 Your partners will shoot it until it catches on fire. Get your car away 

 from it before it explodes. Additionally, after getting the background of 

 the mission, drive back to Grove Street and get the bazooka. Aim at the exit 

 for Grove street. When the Ballas car is coming, shoot at it to quickly 

 finish the mission. 

 

 

 Explosive Situation mission: 

 —————————- 

 Go into the quarry and shoot the two workers that are featured the opening 

 sequence at the detonation controls. This will stop the countdown and you 

 can take your time getting the dynamite. Run over the dynamite crates with 

 the giant dump truck to beak them open and get the explosives. 

 

 

 Farewell My Love mission: 

 ————————- 

 As the race begins, instead of going forward, turn around and go straight. 

 You will be jumping off a cliff, but if you can land your car successfully 

 you will be on your way. Keep driving straight into the town. Take a right 

 turn at the first right you see. If you have already done the race you 

 should know where to go. Follow the road and take another right. You will 

 then be driving across a small bridge. Turn left on the small dirt road 

 and park your car at the end of the bridge. Since you are allowed only 25 

 seconds out of your car, you must do this quickly. Once out of your car, 

 run to the middle of the bridge. Enable the“Spawn Rhino”code, which 

 should block the bridge. Do this as many times as desired, but be aware 

 that the other cars will show up sometime around three minutes. When the 

 cars appear, make sure to have the rocket launcher out before getting in 

 your car. When the cars show up, they will drive into the creek/river. 

 Quickly get out of your car and fire multiple rockets at them. Do this 

 very quickly. You can then complete the race with no competitors. 

 Additionally, before the race starts, enable the“Flying cars”code. 

 Go to the race. Immediately at the start of the race, all cars will 

 floor it and will fly off the cliff. This gives you as much time as needed 

 to complete the race. Make sure you go drive slow so that you also do not 

 fly off. About six minutes are required to complete the race. 

 

 

 Fender Ketchup mission: 

 ———————– 

 To easily complete this mission, find a large empty area and just keep 

 going fast back and forth doing a lot of 180 degree turns to get the 

 scare-o-meter full. Watch out for cops—once they spot you, you will 

 have more then one star and they will try to hit you head on. Remember 

 to make sure that you do not get in a head on collision, or the man on 

 the hood will die. Additionally, do not drive on the freeway, as this 

 will attract the police. Instead, drive to the airport and perform a 

 few insane jumps. This will have him terrified quickly. Also, the 

 airport is not too far from Woozie’s casino. Pull to the side of Woozie’s 

 casino and drive back and forth doing 180s until the Scare-O-Meter is 

 full. 

 

 

 High Stakes, Low Rider mission: 

 ——————————- 

 Instead of using the first lowrider that was given you by Cesar, drive 

 any vehicle to Cesar’s house. Look across the street from the mission 

 starting circle to find a light colored Voodoo in a driveway. Get in 

 it, and use it to start the mission. This car is considered a low 

 rider, but does not have hydraulics making it less likely that you 

 will accidentally activate them. It also controls better in turns 

 when compared to your original lowrider. Get to the starting position 

 of the race. When the race begins, try to maneuver around the inevitable 

 initial crash of most of the other drivers. Note that the waypoint 

 markers for races now are visible on the horizon, unlike the“bubble” 

 Markers of previous Grand Theft Auto games. Also, imbedded in the 

 waypoint marker is an arrow that will indicate the direction that you 

 need to follow for the next marker. It may be easier to slip into 

 second place and watch the first place cars for cues on where to turn. 

 Otherwise, just pay attention to the directions and take your turns 

 carefully when in first place. By the time you reach the final waypoint 

 markers, slip into first place, or use the final straight away to take 

 the lead. Do not slow down at the end, even though the road stops. 

 Hit the finish line at full speed. Additionally, when you get in the 

 low rider, enable the“Deadly vehicle”code. During the race, tap the 

 rear bumper of each car in front of you. By the end of the race, you 

 will have as much time as needed to finish in first place without any 

 competition. 

 

 Enable the“Flying cars”code before you get to the starting grid. 

 When the race begins, the five other low-riders will start to fly 

 around the area. When you reach the third or fourth checkpoint, you 

 will be in first place throughout the race. Do not accelerate fast, 

 because you will also end up flying. Instead, drive at a very slow 

 pace, but fast enough so that you can finish the race before the game 

 freezes. 

 

 

 Bulletproof Savanna in High Stakes, Low Rider mission: 

 —————————————————— 

 After completing the mission, Cesar and his Savanna will remain at 

 the finish line, but the doors will be locked. Use another vehicle 

 to push the car to your garage. The doors will now be unlocked and 

 the car remains bulletproof. 

 

 

 Home Invasion mission: 

 ———————- 

 Try to get to the target house with as much time remaining. The 

 required three ammunition boxes can be found in the following 

 locations. In the first room that you enter, look to your right 

 near the cannon next to the front window. Go up the stairs and look 

 on the landing. Go all the way up the stairs and go to the end of 

 the hallway. If desired, you can get three more boxes in the house, 

 but they do not seem to give anything extra. 

 

 

 Ice Cold Killa mission: 

 ———————– 

 Take a gun and shoot out the tires of the pimpmobile. Then, shoot 

 the car until the smoke turns black. Next, get a gun that you can 

 do drive bys with. If you do not have one, go behind the building 

 and by a pole for the bridge to find one. When you get into the 

 club through the windows, meet Jizzy and just run out of the club 

 after him. When you are out there, the pimpmobile should be in the 

 same condition that you left it. It is easier to blow up his car. 

 Additionally, before you go into the club, shoot out the tires of 

 his Pimpmobile. Get in the club, chase him out, and he will get 

 into the car even with blown tires. You just run after him, and pull 

 him out of the car. 

 

 Outside the club are two limos along with Jizzy’s car. Before 

 entering the club through the skylight, park one limo in front 

 of his car and the other behind his car, blocking it in. It will 

 remain this way when Jizzy exits the club and tries to escape, 

 making it easy to run up and pull him out of the car before he can 

 drive off. Also,“high center”Jizzy’s car on the grassy median 

 along the boardwalk prior to entering the club. He will not be able 

 to drive off it before you reach the car to pull him out. Additionally, 

 before entering the club, blow up Jizzy’s car rather than just shooting 

 off the tires or decreasing its health. Then when Jizzy tries to escape, 

 he will be forced to do so in a Pizzaboy scooter. Just knock him off 

 his bike and kill him with an M4 or any other gun. 

 

 Instead of trying to get out and get in jizzy’s car, just follow him for 

 awhile. He will get out of the car, and you can shoot him. 

 

 

 Just Business mission: 

 ———————- 

 On the first part, let Sweet do all the shooting. When on the motorcycle 

 unleash your guns on the people on motorcycles going for the person 

 driving. If he dies they both do. You can also try to pop their tires. 

 They will spin out. Do not worry about the big truck you see—it is 

 indestructible. You will see the action play out of you going of the 

 car. You will jump off the big truck from the trailer. 

 

 

 Key To Her Heart mission: 

 ————————- 

 In the Key To Her Heart mission for Woozie in Las Venturas, when you 

 go to the courtier’s house and kill the gimp, you can take his purple 

 dildo to use as a melee weapon. Additionally, when you get Millie as 

 a girlfriend, instead of dating her, kill her. Wait awhile and Woozie 

 will call. CJ will say that Millie is dead. Woozie will tell you to 

 go to her house and take the pass key. 

 

 

 Strange T-Bone behavior in Mike Toreno mission: 

 ———————————————- 

 In the mission, when instructed to get into the car and doing so, 

 you can choose any car desired. Get out and choose a faster vehicle 

 with T-Bone following you. T-Bone’s following actions for entering 

 and exiting vehicles are scripted strangely. For example, if you 

 crash and get thrown off a motorcycle with T-Bone on it with you, 

 he will get up and walk to any nearby vehicle door, and then follow 

 you. 

 

 

 Misappropriation mission: 

 ————————- 

 Instead of chasing the man in the helicopter, enable the“Spawn 

 Jetpack”code. Fly up behind the man. Make sure he does not see 

 you then open fire from the Jetpack. Swoop in, grab the dossier, 

 then make your escape before the FBI kills you. 

 

 

 Mountain Cloud Boys mission: 

 —————————- 

 This mission seems difficult at first, but if you have the correct 

 weapons it can be easy. First, enable the“Weapons (tier 3)”code 

 to get the rocket launcher. Next, enable the“Deadly vehicle”code. 

 When the men come after you, shoot the first two or three with a 

 gun. Get ahead of Woozie and shoot a rocket at the car to blow it 

 up, killing everyone there. As you go further, two motorcycles will 

 pull up. Hit them with the rocket launcher. Be careful; make sure 

 that the bike blows up before getting too close. As you go further 

 into the alley, you can shoot rockets in the directions of enemies 

 with guns and kill them all, but stay ahead of Woozie. When you and 

 Woozie jump in the car (having the“Deadly vehicle”code enabled), 

 just hit the two cars head on, but be careful. Your car can be 

 damaged and explode as a result of too many hits. 

 

 

 Noon mission: 

 ————- 

 You must keep ramming him and do the“PIT”maneuver as taught in 

 driving school. His car will come next to you. When it does, shoot 

 him with a drive by. His car will catch on fire and he will get 

 out. He will shoot at you. You must shoot at him first and he will 

 die. Additionally, before you start, get a RPG or a homing rocket 

 launcher. Then, enable the“Cars fly away”code. When you start 

 the mission, get the dune buggy nearby and ram Eddie’s car. It will 

 float away slowly, then it will hover. While it is hovering, get 

 out of the dune buggy and shoot him down with the RPG or homing 

 rocket launcher; it will blow up and fall down. 

 

 Sometimes when you drive out of the ghost town, at the of the 

 intersection of the dirt road leading out of the ghost town and 

 the road leading to the Sherman Dam, Pulaski will go too fast on 

 the left turn, go wide, and crash into a road sign on the side of 

 the road. Block him and hijack his car. Drive into the water just 

 north of the Sherman Dam. Do not go too fast though, or you will 

 lose Pulaski and fail the mission. Exit the car and just stay in 

 the water. Pulaski will run after you after you steal his car, and 

 end up walking into the water. Pulaski cannot swim, and will drown. 

 You will have killed Pulaski without using cheats or bullets. 

 

 Before you start mission, equip a sniper riffle. When the Pulaski 

 runs for the car, aim and zoom in. You will have enough time to 

 flatten the front and the rear tire. Then, hop in the Sand Rail 

 next to the cemetery and follow his car. Watch him; he will be 

 swerving all over the place. This will give you enough time to 

 shoot at the car or pull him out and shoot him. 

 

 

 OG Loc mission: 

 ————— 

 After getting the PCJ and beginning the chase, it is not necessary 

 to shoot at or try to knock Freddy off his bike. You simply need 

 to follow him. If you lose sight of him, just keeping him in the 

 zoomed version of the mini-map is enough to keep the mission going. 

 Try to follow his path, but if he gets out of sight, you can use 

 parallel streets and paths to continue. Pay attention to whether 

 his position is above or below you (a triangle instead of a square) 

 on the mini-map, and choose the appropriate course. At the end, 

 he will stop at a park in Vagos territory. Ride your PCJ up the 

 stairs past the gang to the top of the structure, then mow them 

 down as they clear the top of the steps. Additionally, if you 

 failed this mission the first time and try it again, you will be 

 prompted to trip skip. This makes you automatically get OG Loc, 

 and end up at the house where you ring the door bell. 

 

 

 Pier 69 mission: 

 —————- 

 Instead of chasing Ryder in the boat, wait until he approaches 

 in his boat, then enable the“Destroy all cars”code. The mission 

 will be instantly completed. 

 

 Billboard message In Reuniting The Families mission: 

 Along the highway in Los Santos is an advertisement on a billboard. 

 It has a woman on it with a can of pop on the side of her labeled 

 Sprunk. Under that, it reads“A taste of things to come”. At the 

 end of the Reuniting The Families mission, your car will go through 

 that billboard, changing the writing at the bottom to read 

 “A taste of come”. 

 

 

 Riot mission: 

 ————- 

 This mission is quite long and requires a lot of ammunition and 

 body armor. You must take over all of the gang territories in the 

 hood areas. Try driving concentric to the Johnson house going 

 outward in one big circle. Once you have established your territory, 

 the mission is complete and you can celebrate with Big Smoke and 

 continue with the other missions. 

 

 

 Robbing Uncle Sam mission: 

 ————————– 

 Before you climb over the gate, get a gun or Uzi and shoot the 

 two soldiers from outside . When you climb over the gate, shoot 

 the guard standing behind two crates . When you enter the warehouse, 

 use the forklift and carry two boxes at a time. Do this by sliding 

 the arms directly into the middle of two boxes. You can now carry 

 both of them at the same time. However, you cannot put two boxes 

 into the truck at the same time . By the time you carry the two 

 boxes behind the truck , one army guard will appear and Ryder will 

 try to kill him. Do not let him kill the guard by himself, as he 

 takes a long time and could lose a lot of health. After you have 

 carried the four boxes to the truck , there will be two boxes outside 

 the warehouse . They can be found at the left hand side of the 

 warehouse, and the other can be found at the place where you killed 

 the third soldier before you entered the warehouse. After when you 

 escape , two army vehicles will start to chase you. If you are lucky, 

 both of them can keep crashing and they will end up exploding. 

 

 Before starting the mission, find the TV Studios in the northwest 

 part of Los Santos. At the top of the stairs (in the car park), 

 you will find a sniper rifle. When you start the mission, do not 

 shoot the guard at the gate. Instead, run behind the building that 

 is on your left. Go up the stairs, walk along the pathway, and 

 drop down at the end. Run and climb up the container boxes that 

 are in front of you. You may get shot a few times, but if you are 

 fast, you will survive. Use the sniper rifle to shoot all the 

 guards (do not open the gate yet). After you have opened the 

 warehouse door by shooting the switch on the right and have 

 killed the two guards inside, move the boxes close to the door 

 by using the forklift. Also, move the two boxes outside (which 

 one of the guards was previously using for cover). You can now 

 open the front gate. If you use the sniper rifle, you will not 

 have to keep running around. You should be able to load the boxes 

 quickly while Sweet covers you. Note: Keep an eye on Sweet’s health. 

 You may need to stop loading and shoot a few guards if he starts 

 to lose too much health. 

 

 When you pull up to the gate, hop the wall and shoot the guard at 

 the gate. Go and shoot the two other guards by the warehouse, then 

 shoot the keypad next to the door. Kill the men inside the warehouse. 

 Turn back around and another guard will be running towards you. 

 Shoot him, then hop on the forklift and put the crates by the 

 warehouse door where the truck backs up to. Then, get the two crates 

 that are outside and put them by the other ones. Keep one elevated 

 on the forklift. Shoot the keypad on the gate. Get back on the 

 forklift. Put the first crate inside the truck, then get off and 

 kill the soldier attacking Ryder. Then, get another crate and do 

 the same thing. Every time you load one crate, another soldier will 

 appear. Keep getting off the forklift and kill them. This takes some 

 time, but you and Ryder will not get killed. Get back in the truck 

 when Ryder tells you to and leave. The two Patroits that follow you 

 will be easy to get rid of. 

 

 After loading the six crates in the truck, before you jump into the 

 van to drive away, run to the stairs where the soldiers were coming 

 from. Take out the rocket launcher. The two Patriots will follow you 

 to the stairs and you can destroy them with the rocket launcher. 

 After taking them out, you will be able to get back safely with out 

 the nuisance of the Patriots chasing after you. 

 

 

 Stowaway mission: 

 —————– 

 To easily complete this mission, wheelie in a straight line to the 

 right of the plane, getting next to the ramp. When the plane has 

 offloaded the last of its barrels, turn sharply left and go up the 

 ramp. When aboard, it is critical not to use any firearms at all. 

 Even one shot is usually enough to blow you out of the sky. Also, 

 do not plant more than five charges, as they may self-detonate once 

 you pass that amount. Do not detonate the satchel charges until you 

 are standing on the end of the ramp, or you may not get out in time. 

 

 

 Supply Line mission: 

 ——————– 

 First, go after the man on the bike to your left when you take off. 

 Next, swing around and take out the man in the van. Then, head west 

 and take out the other van. This is the easy part. Instead of flying 

 across town to kill the motorbike and the last van, land on a building 

 close to where you started and just remain there. You will not lose 

 any fuel after your model airplane has landed. For some reason, the 

 other two couriers will make their way toward you. Sit patiently until 

 you can get behind the bike (it will reach you first), then land again 

 on a nearby building. The last van may end up on the freeway. You will 

 have a clear shot at him by flying only a few blocks, and you will be 

 close to Zero’s shop. Additionally, enable the“Fast motion”code 

 repeatedly (about five times) before entering the red marker to start 

 the mission. Your plane will fly faster, but your fuel will deplete 

 the same rate as if you were in normal time. Also, wait on Zero’s roof 

 until the van passes by, by doing this, you will save fuel. 

 

 

 Sweet’s Girl mission: 

 ——————— 

 Make sure you have a fast and reliable car in your garage before 

 staring the mission. Quickly drive to the yellow objective marker. 

 Drive your car on the sidewalk to mow down the Ballas. Keep going 

 into the basketball court at the end of the street to turn around and 

 make another pass. If your car starts smoking, quickly park it next 

 to any survivors and bail. The explosion should kill them. Get behind 

 some cover and shoot anyone remaining. 

 

 

 Tagging Up Turf mission: 

 ———————— 

 To spray over the last tag on the upper part of the building, walk to 

 the nearby small fenced in alley. You will be instructed to climb it. 

 Do so, cross to the other higher fence and also climb that. Then, climb 

 the short wall, then climb again to the ledge that you can use to walk 

 to the tag. 

 

 

 Tanker Commander mission: 

 ————————- 

 After hooking up the trailer, jump out of the truck. The gas station 

 attendant and a friend will be in a car nearby. It will repeatedly 

 crash into the stationary truck and trailer and become damage. Stay 

 out of the way and shoot the car when it is in a safe position until 

 it catches on fire. The gas station attendant will bail. Shoot him, 

 then get back in the truck and carefully drive it to the destination 

 marker. 

 

 

 Toreno’s Last Flight mission: 

 —————————– 

 When you go to take out Toreno, wait until his helicopter’s energy bar 

 appears. Then, enable the“Destroy all cars”code. 

 

 

 Up, Up, And Away mission: 

 ————————- 

 Instead of going directly into the military compound and fighting the 

 soldiers, steal a Leviathan from the Las Venturas airport. Land it outside 

 of Woozie’s casino. After the mission briefing, fly above the destination 

 marker. You should see a helipad with a Leviathan in the distance. Try to 

 land near the helipad and watch out for two soldiers armed with rocket 

 launchers. Bail out if needed near the helipad. Kill the armed soldiers, 

 shoot down the other helicopters, then finish the mission. Instead of 

 fighting all the soldiers downstairs, all you had to do is kill two men 

 and destroy two helicopters. 

 

 

 Vertical Bird mission: 

 ———————- 

 Your mission is to board the aircraft carrier by jumping off your boat and 

 swimming inside. If you drive your boat into the back of the loading docks 

 of the aircraft carrier, your cover is blown. Run and gun to the radar room 

 and take out the SAM launcher. Afterwards, run to the back of the carrier, 

 and before you take off with the Hydra, blow up two of the three Hydras. 

 Do not destroy the one on the loading elevator, as this is the one you want. 

 Then, take off and you will only have one other Hydra to shoot down with 

 instead of three. After you have taken out the enemy Hydra, sink the three 

 spy boats by hovering your jet instead of flying. 

 

 

 Wrong Side Of The Tracks mission: 

 ——————————— 

 Once at the station, do not get on the dirt bike. Instead, enable the 

 “Spawn Jetpack”code, then kill the men on the train with the shotgun. 

 Once you have killed the men on the train, you must go back to Smoke and 

 get on the dirt bike to pass the mission. Additionally, smoke has very 

 bad aim. Try to keep up speed with the train. When Smoke tells too take 

 the hill, do not, as this makes completing the mission almost impossible. 

 Instead, stay with the moving train. Go past the barrier and try to avoid 

 getting hit by the other train. Also, turn off the vibration option on the 

 controller to help keep your hands steady while on the tracks. 

 

 

 Notre Dame parody in Las Venturas: 

 ———————————- 

 Enter the bar called The Craw Bar in Las Venturas. As soon as you enter, 

 you will see a small Notre Dame sign that instead reads“Notre Lame”on 

 the wall directly ahead. 

 

 

 DRIV3R reference in Madd Dogg’s Rhymes mission: 

 ———————————————– 

 Just before you sneak past Madd Dogg, he will say“Tanner you suck! damn 

 you, Refractions, how could you mess up so bad?!”This is a reference to 

 DRIV3R, only they changed“Reflections”to“Refractions”. 

 

 

 Grand Theft Auto 3 reference in Farewell My Love mission: 

 ——————————————————— 

 The man who Catalina is with is the main character from Grand Theft Auto 3. 

 At the end of the mission, she gives a pink slip but it is not to her car 

 She says that she needs her car because they are going to Liberty City. 

 

 

 Grand Theft Auto 3 reference in Wu Zi Mu mission: 

 ————————————————- 

 In the opening sequence to the mission, look in the car in the background 

 to see your character from Grand Theft Auto 3 sitting inside. 

 

 

 Grand Theft Auto: Vice City reference in 555 We Tip mission: 

 ———————————————————— 

 While going to the destination marker, you will see police cars chase a car 

 and a man firing at them. If you look closely, you can see it is Tommy 

 Vercetti from Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. Be careful—the police will 

 sometimes crash into you, giving you one star on your wanted meter. 

 

 

 Xbox reference in Madd Dogg’s Rhymes mission: 

 ——————————————– 

 When stealing the lyrics from Madd Dogg for Og Loc, you must sneak around 

 in the mansion. When passing Madd Dogg playing his video game, look closely 

 to see that it strongly resembles an Xbox system. 

 

 

 Business references in Los Santos: 

 ———————————- 

 In the“Sunset Strip”area ,you can see a train car parked off the street 

 (near the hill that you drive up to get to Mad Dog’s mansion). This is 

 supposed to be Carney’s, the burger joint that is actually on the real Sunset 

 Strip in Los Angeles. Additionally, earlier in the game, across the street 

 where you meat Tenpenny (at a donut shop) for a mission, look at the wall 

 across the street. You can see an advertisement for“Blob Music”, which is 

 a reference to Amoeba Music which can be found in Hollywood, Berkeley, and 

 San Francisco. The design looks almost identical to that of the real business. 

 

 In the opening sequence before you start the game (with the game credits), 

 watch the pictures that are shown. In one picture is a building in Vinewood. 

 This is a reference to the Capitol Records building in Hollywood. The building 

 in the game is located somewhere in Vinewood. 

 

 

 Candy Suxxx reference: 

 ———————- 

 Some of the safe houses you can purchase have a familiar picture of adult 

 film star Candy Suxxx on the wall, who originally appeared in Grand Theft 

 Auto: Vice City. 

 

 

 Grand Theft Auto 3 reference: 

 —————————– 

 Pay close attention to the shows that are heard on WFTC while cruising around 

 San Andreas. Notice that one of the shows is called“Gardening With Maurice”. 

 If listened to Chatterbox in Grand Theft Auto 3 , you may remember Lazlow 

 (the host) talking to a caller who said“Gardening With Maurice”got taken 

 off the air. Obviously this game takes place further in the past, so 

 “Gardening With Maurice”is still on. 

 

 

 Grand Theft Auto 3 reference in Las Venturas: 

 ——————————————— 

 Go to any casino in Las Venturas and play video poker. Notice that there are 

 various characters from Grand Theft Auto 3 on the faces of the cards. 

 Additionally, go to any casino in Las Venturas. Find a blackjack vendor and 

 play blackjack. If a King, Queen, or Joker appears, you can see some characters 

 from the Grand Theft Auto 3 and Vice City. Some of them are Ricardo Diaz, 

 Candy Suxxx, a man trying to look up wearing sunglasses, Asuka Kasen, Steve 

 Scott, Donald Love, Marty Chonks, Misty, Don Salvatore Leone, and Lance Vance. 

 Note: If you cannot see the characters clearly, use the video poker instead. 

 

 

 Grand Theft Auto: Vice City references: 

 ————————————— 

 In the mission when you have to rescue Truth’s friends, one of them is Kent 

 Paul from Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. The old man who runs the casino that 

 you later meet in the mission is Ken Rosenberg, Tommy Vercetti’s lawyer in 

 Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and mentions Tommy and the“good old days”in 

 an intermission sequence. 

 

 Walk into an Ammu-Nation and listen carefully. You can hear a commercial 

 that was featured in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. It says“The store 

 leading the fight against communism is having a blowout sale! Ammunation 

 has a wide selection of Peace Makers! Come by Ammunation on Militia Mondays” 

 

 

 Grand Theft Auto: Vice City references in Las Venturas: 

 ——————————————————- 

 In the intermission sequence for Wuzi’s casino mission entitled 

 “Key To Her Heart”, the board that CJ reveals is none other than the 

 band Love Fist from Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. Additionally, one of 

 the safe houses in Las Venturas is a casino in the northern part. 

 Behind it is a sign of Candy Suxx moving her leg. 

 

 On the Old Venturas Strip, the cowboy on a casino is Grand Theft Auto: 

 Vice City’s southern real estate tycoon Avery Carrington. 

 

 

 Grand Theft Auto: Vice City reference in Los Santos: 

 —————————————————- 

 Near the Vinewood area and the Market district, there is a giant studio company 

 that you can enter. If you look at it, these buildings are the same ones that 

 are at Interglobal Studios in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City . Keep looking around 

 the building and you will see the front offices. In big letters, the name of 

 the company is posted. It is Interglobal Television. 

 

 

 Grand Theft Auto: Vice City references in San Fierro: 

 —————————————————– 

 Go inside the Zero RC toy shop. Behind the cashier is a game being sold. 

 That game is Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. Additionally, go to the counter 

 inside the Zero RC toy shop. You will see a rack of action figures that 

 includes Tommy Vercetti from Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. 

 

 Buy the house in the Carlton Heights area (near the Go Kart Track). 

 Go inside and look to your left. There should be a hallway. To your left 

 should be your wardrobe. Look to your right and walk through the first door. 

 After it opens, look at the picture above the bed to see the Diaz/Vercetti 

 mansion from Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. 

 

 

 Manhunt reference in Los Santos: 

 ——————————– 

 Enter the bar near CJ’s house. Along with various other paintings on the 

 inside walls, there will be the red-eyed elite guardsmen that worked for 

 the Director in Manhunt. 

 

 

 Manhunt reference in Red County: 

 ——————————– 

 In Fisherman’s Lagoon, there is a circle wire holder. On it is a company 

 name and Carcer, which was the city in Manhunt. 

 

 

 Manhunt reference in San Fierro: 

 ——————————– 

 When you first start the Zero RC toy shop’s missions, watch the intermission 

 sequence. Look closely in the background to see action figures of the main 

 character from Manhunt, James Earl Cash. 

 

 

 Manhunt reference in Whetstone: 

 ——————————- 

 There is a junkyard in the Mt. Chiliad/Shady Creek area that is exactly like 

 the junkyard level in Manhunt. You can also find a Dozer here to drive. 

 

 

 Radio comments: 

 ——————————– 

 * Afer doing some Grove Street missions and seizing territory, one of the DJs on the 

 radio will say“Have you heard Grove Streets making a comeback? That’s great news. 

 hope they don’t take me out just for playing this music.” 

 

 * After the 555 We Tip mission, another DJ says“Did you hear about that D.A. with 

 the trunk full of drugs? I can’t believe that. Keeping it all for his own personal 

 stash.” 

 

 * You can also listen to the talk radio to hear Lazlo host the entertainment section, 

 where he interviews OG LOC (the rapper you help during the Grove Street missions) 

 OG LOC’s manager is now Big Smoke.

 Hint:Store More vehicles in garage: 

 ———————————– 

 Submitted by: Prathmesh Mhatre 

 

 At CJ’s home in Los Santos you can store maximum 2 Cars or Bikes or so.To fit more 

 park one car near the wall Find BMX and park it extream end of garage find some more 

 bikes this time garage won’t open.Park bike in front of the door and get off the bike 

 door will open up.Get on the bike casually CJ will take a run up on the bike and bike 

 will enter the garage without any problem.You can store as many as bikes fit in the 

 garage. You’ll find BMX parked in front of the house opposite CJ’s at certain timings. 

 

 

 Hint:Ride on bicycle be healthy: 

 ——————————– 

 Submitted by: Prathmesh Mhatre 

 

 Drivers in Los Santos are always in hurry even an old lady don’t hesitate to bump 

 the stopped car(This reminds me my driving in Liberty City&amp;Vice City) it difficult 

 no navigate around Los Santos with such traffic.Since people don’t give up their cars 

 easily like previous versions of GTA;riding on BMX is the best way to get around as 

 well as increase the Stamina.Railway lines,Water cannals are safer&amp;faster to travel 

 Or simply stick to footpaths to not to be squashed 

 

 

 Stuck in Los Santos?: 

 ——————— 

 Submitted by: Prathmesh Mhatre 

 

 You’re stuck in Los Santos up to the mission’A break from Los Santos…’.But stil 

 you can have a close look of other cities here are the tips: 

 

 1.Go to the South-east corner of Los Santos walk along the railway lines.Swim towards 

 north reach to the coaste quickly. 

 2.Keep going north along the railway lines soon you’ll reach station.(You’ll be 

 declared 6 star wanted as soon as you enter other city.Even cheat can’t wipe that 

 out). 

 3.If you’re lucky you may catch up the train if there isn’t any train wait and defend 

 yourself from Army and Police.Soon there’ll be a train.Get into cotrol room by 

 pressing F standing near he engine. 

 4.Accelrate train backwards.Now cops and army can’t get you DO NOT SLOW DOWN TRAIN 

 MUCH or you’ll be busted. 

 5.Now all you have to do is manage your speed High on straight lined Medium on curved 

 ones.Have fun watching at least. 

 

 NOTE: TRAIN COULD DERAIL ON CURVED HIGH GAGE RAILS(ESPACIALLY IN MOUNTAINS)MY TRAIN 

 ONCE DERAILED NEAR A TUNNEL DONT REMEMBER WHICH BUT COACHES DETACHED&amp;WENT INTO THE 

 SEA I SURVIVED ONLY BECAUSE ENGINE HAD ENTERD THE TUNNEL DERAILED&amp;TLITED

 just step out of the car and then get in. Now see,u got full nitrous again.

 How to destroy a moving car without any gun: Here’s a way that i found while 

 playing GTA: SA, first jump onto the top of a car on any highway or road, dont 

 stand on the bonut but on the top or back of the car. Now when the car starts 

 moving, start tapping the attack button, Carl Johnson will start kicking the 

 car.. you’ll see the car waving around when the drive panics. Dont stop and 

 keep kicking, eventually the car will become on fire.. jump away and look the 

 car being blast by the engine fire caused by your actioons

 After completing the“Just Business”level, Just go to“Santa Marina Beach”. 

 (See the Map to get there). There, you could see a red colour at the shore of 

 the beach. Its the starting point of a Competitional Race. First, try to swim 

 using Sprint key, as normal. Then you will reach the other shore. Then, from 

 there you have to get on a cycle, to reach the other point of this race. Go as 

 you wish, but try to use the accelerating key continuously to go faster. Then, 

 when you reach the next point of race. You will be asked to get down from cycle 

 and to Run faster to reach the Final Point of the Race. 

 

 Sometimes you will be going on 7th or 8th Position. Never mind them ! 

 

 Now, just type ROCKETMAN to get jetpack. Then you might be able to Run Faster 

 if  you press Sprint key along with accelerating key. But, please not that you 

 have to go in ground level height, or else you cannot win the Race. By using 

 this Cheat, you can get $10000 very easily! 

 

 Please Note:- This Trick will not work, if you try to get a vehicle using cheat 

 code, because you have to run on the roads, or else you will be Failed in the 

 Race!

 By ending all of the missions, that doesn’t mean you have already finished with 

 the game! By finishing missions ONLY you get only to 75% of completing the game. 

 You will need to make all competitions of driving, flying, low riders and pick-up 

 all hidden objects around San Andreas. Then you will get 100% of the game. 

 Also buying all houses will do the trick (it will raise you the completance of

 Get a Packer (Lorry). Then you may use 8 or 2 to move the Packer function to Up or 

 Down. You may take vehicles upstairs of this packer and you may carry them wherever 

 you like. BUT, you have to drive very carefully or else the vehicle above the packer 

 may fell-down and even may explode. This Trick might be useful if you need a vhicle 

 and at the same time you just dont want to drive that vehicle at that time and you 

 would like to carry a vhicle by another. I’m doing something naughty with this idea. 

 I use these packers when cops are to catch me. I will throw cops using this idea. 

 When cops hit the back of packer, up the packer function and finaly you might be 

 able to throw the cops. The Cops will constantly hit the vehicle since the Packer 

 is not having Good Speed on the Roads. Is it really something naughty ?

 Bug–Hood Loss: 

 —————- 

 While playing the European English version of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas with the 

 latest patch of 1.01, I encountered a bug. 

 

 The bug occurs near CJ’s house. I bought in the northwest of ballas territory when it 

 comes to fighting turf, not too far from the beach and ammuNation. While fighting a 

 turf war normally there are 3 waves, ie you survive the first wave and then the second 

 and when you survive the third“the hood is yours”. The trouble occurs near Jefferson’s 

 neighborhood as you drive to a nearby drive to take territory. While standing on rooftops, 

 I survive the first wave of attacks but as I shoot a lot of Ballas a couple of them run 

 away from me and are noted as purple triangles and squares in the green grove street 

 territory. If I wander too far from the Flashing Red“contested territory”I get a 

 message saying to“get back into the war zone”. I have stood in the war zone for 20 

 minutes only to just stand there with nobody coming after me, hence if I leave the war 

 zone I don’t get to win that area because after a couple minutes I lose it. Therefore 

 I cannot simply go way out of the warzone and chase down the enemies. It is a glitch 

 because there is no way to win the territory.

 look around. Next to that room, you will see another. Fly to it and look for the entrance. 

 Fly to it and you can fly around the level.

 buy in the game such as cars, clothes, haircuts, tattoos, food, weapons. This also 

 shows the effect on your fat, health, stamina, respect and sexiness. You can modify 

 the fat, health, stamina, respect and sexiness by changing the numbers beside each 

 item. Save your changes and start the game. 

 

 

 Secret interiors: 

 —————– 

 Go to the Ganton gym in Los Santos and kill all four people. Enable the rocketman code 

 to spawn a Jetpack. Go to the entrance and fly up until you exit out the top. Then, 

 fly to the east two blocks. You will see a yellow marker. Land around the marker and 

 take off the Jetpack. Walk into the marker and you will be in a secret room. It resembles 

 a hotel or strip club). Then enable the rocketman code again and use the Jetpack to fly 

 up and look around. Next to that room, you will see another. Fly to it and look for the 

 entrance. Fly to it and you can fly around the level. 

 

 

 Invincible car: 

 ————— 

 Use the following trick to make your car invincible, so that it will not show body damage 

 or explode. Enable the jcnruad code while CJ is on foot. Then, enter a vehicle and enter 

 the cheat code again to disable it. Your vehicle is now invincible. After you get out of 

 the vehicle, it may or may not stay invincible. Occasionally the car will become vulnerable 

 again for no apparent reason, but most of the time it stays invulnerable. 

 

 

 Flying car: 

 ———– 

 Enable the bubblecars code. Get a PCR 600 and drive directly into another car. You should 

 fly off your bike directly on top of the other car and it will fly away with C.J. still on 

 it. 

 

 

 Croupier mission: Invisible tow ropes: 

 ————————————– 

 When doing the Croupier mission, pull up to the red marker in a Tanker with the trailer. 

 Your trailer will turn into the nearest car as if you were towing it with invisible 

 towing ropes. 

 

 

 Modify population cycle: 

 ———————— 

 Note: This procedure involves editing a game file; create a backup copy of the file before 

 proceeding. Use a text editor to edit the“popcycle.dat”file in the“\rockstar games\gta 

 san andreas\data”directory. You will find a list of all the different types of locations 

 in the game, such as the airport. You can edit the number of different types of pedestrians 

 in a place in a specific time period by changing the numbers beside each item. For example, 

 you can change the amount of cops at the beach on a weekday at noon and increase the amount 

 of beach folks or farmers. Save your changes and start the game. 

 

 

 Modify gang reactions: 

 ———————- 

 Note: This procedure involves editing a game file; create a backup copy of the file before 

 proceeding. Use a text editor to edit the“ped.dat”file in the“\rockstar games\gta san 

 andreas\data”directory. You will find a list of the different types of characters in the 

 game. Change the way the other gangs react to your gang. Your gang is“GANG2″. Beside 

 “Respect”under each gang, enter the gang you want them to respect or hate. To find a list 

 of what gang numbers represent each gang refer to the“pedgrp.dat”file in the same folder. 

 Save your changes and start the game. 

 

 

 Stand on Hydra’s wing: 

 ———————- 

 When your flying in the Hydra with the bubbleman code, apply the thrusters forward and use 

 [Down] to aim the Hydra up. Then, monitor it for a while so it does not over or under 

 balance, and it remains pointing up by itself. After that, leave the Hydra, but do not 

 touch anything. You should be standing on the wing of a Hydra that should still be flying 

 up, faster because of the thrusters. You can jump off at anytime to continue the rest of 

 the code.

 If you are taking photos with your camera then the photos will be counted and there is a limit. 

 But taking photos of you with the help of your gang members will not be counted. Use the cheat 

 ‘WANRLTW’or‘FULLCLIP’to take infinite pictures.

 Take the camera from the bedroom of the safe house by pressing the tab button. Then make 

 gang members (pointing gun towards them and pressing‘G’).If you are just started you have 

 no respect and so that you can use the cheat‘SJMAHPE’for making anyone as gang member. 

 When your gang members come closer then a message will appear that‘PRESS TAB TO HAVE YOUR 

 PICTURE TAKEN’. By pressing the tab another message will appear and then press the tab once 

 again. Thus you can have your photos and enjoy.

 Millie to get the card for the mission:‘Robbing the bank at Caligula’s’When your relationship 

 is 35%, you’ll get the card. To get the 35% without dating her and stuff, go to a save house, 

 put on your gimp suit, go to Millie, the date will start, go back home, save a few times (2 or

 This is the biggest cheat in San Andreas: 

 —————————————– 

 Submitted by: nina 

 

 CAINEMVHZC–With this cheat your health is unlimited, except when falling of from big heights 

 and in explosions. 

 

 

 Finish the Vigilante Missions Easily: 

 ————————————- 

 Actually a glitch that can be taken advantage of to cheat your way through the Vigilante 

 sub-missions. Anytime the player accesses an indoor environment and then returns outside 

 during this sub-mission the target(s) with self-destruct automatically. This means no more 

 messy pursuing. 

 

 

 Fast Reload: 

 ———— 

 When the current weapon clip you have is about to run out press the next weapon button and 

 then the previous weapon button to equip you with the weapon that was running low. It will 

 now have a full magazine. This trick doesn’t work if you are reloading at the time of 

 switching as you will have to let Carl reload it when you switch back. 

 

 

 Flying Tips: 

 ———— 

 Among the hardest missions in the game involve flying aircraft; chief among these would be 

 the“Learning to Fly”missions at flight school with the many coronas in between success 

 and you. Most players make the mistake of steering with the main flaps and not the rudder; 

 the former are the flaps on the wings and the latter is the flap on the tail. 

 The big difference is that steering with the former gives the player a tighter turning 

 radius but with less precise control; the latter restricts your controls greatly and so is 

 less popularly used. Try a combination of the two: first turn with the stick and then 

 compensate by using the rudder. The rudder will act to stabilize your plane and return 

 control to you. Also, know which camera to use. The default camera during flight should 

 be the one trailing the plane that gives the widest field of view so that you can easily 

 see where you are going as well as your relative position to the ground. The First person 

 camera is good to use when doing the barrel roll or when using the Hydra to dogfight.

 Easy mission“Vertical Bird”: 

 —————————– 

 Submitted by: Omega 

 

 This mission isn’t too hard. But there’s an easy way to complete this mission: 

 After get in the Hydra there are 2 or 3 Hydras chasing after you. Don’t Worry, just find 

 some where surrounded with rocky mountain to land the plane (the desert is quite good). 

 Then get out of the plane quickly. Keep a distance from the plane. Watch the radar and 

 you’ll see 2 red marks will disappear (I guess they’re 2 planes destroyed by their own 

 rockets). The last redmark is the last Hydra. You should watch cuaze it’s quite fun: 

 it will repeatly fly around you and your Hydra and soon hit the rocks around you. 

 After several hits it will catch fire and“go boom”. Get in The plane to find the location 

 of the agency boats, get out then destroy the boats (using rocket launcher or minigun). 

 The last thing you have to do is flying home. (Note: Find a place without cars and easy 

 to land/take off. Get out of the plane quickyly or some rocket will hit the plane or you. 

 If the last plane is not destroyed simply take it down by using Minigun or rocket launcher) 

 

 

 Hint: 

 —– 

 Submitted by: Omega 

 

 My favourite weapon in this ganme is the barrel Shotgun (I don’t remember its name but it 

 is shorter than other shotguns). This weapon is real fast and powerful. If you comebine it 

 with infinite ammo code“WANRLTW”and hit man code“NCSGDAG”this will be the most powerful 

 weapon in this game (I think). 

 With this you can kill the target in short distance without cause damage to your health. 

 

 

 Finding some rare car in Export car mission: 

 ——————————————– 

 I really enjoy this mission so I give this to you. 

 Some cars will appear many before the exportin mission but after startin the mision they 

 are almost impossible to find. I recommend to save before the mission start, then watch 

 the list of cars. Load save, store some rare cars that you can’t find them easily (such 

 as Sentinel, Stafford, Journey ect.) then do the mission 

 I will guide sone way to find those rare car: 

 

 * Sentinel: 

 A foor doors car which can be found at the the tv studio (not far from the“Vinewood” 

 Sign). This place is just like the film studio in GTA Vice City and it could be easier 

 to find it if flying with Jetpack. 

 

 * Journey: 

 A white RV. Sometime park at bar in the country side but when the export mission starts 

 you have to look it up in the country road. Other way not to go to the country is using 

 the code“FVTMNBZ”. 

 

 * BF Injection: 

 Can be found in the moutain country or at the westcoast of San Fierro. Another way is 

 using the code“CRAZYTOWN”. It will apear a lot. (better not using this way cauze you 

 will becom freaky ugly clown). 

 

 * Euros: 

 Go to the The Camels Toe casino (pyramid with a sphinx in the front) in Las Venturas. 

 The Euros is under the sphinx. 

 

 * Cheetah, Comet, FCR–900, Buffalo, Slamvan: 

 Easy to find in Las Venturas at night. 

 

 * Stafford: 

 Appear alot in the Northest area of Las Venturas

 Liberty city: 

 ————- 

 1: Go in the Gym and kill all the peolp inside. 

 2: Spawn JetPack and head to the Yellow Marker (East Beach). 

 3: Enter and spawn the Jetpack and fly over to Liberty City (West VineWood). 

 4: Out for Non Soild Street. and have fun exporing. (with a Jetpack). 

 

 Note: Its only 40% of Portland. Not the Whole State Itself. beware and walk on Only 

 Soild Street. use the jetpack To Fly Over non Soild Roads and Buildings. 

 

 

 Easy money: 

 ———– 

 This trick requires maximum bike skill for both motorcycles and a regular bike. Go to the 

 highest building in Los Santos, the circular one, and jump off using either the motorcycle 

 or bike. While you are in mid-air, you can spin for a little bit or try to do a back flip. 

 Stay on the bikes until you land and you will receive an insane stunt bonus for over $200. 

 

 

 Planes with two person capacity: 

 ——————————– 

 Even though the Dodo is the most well known aircraft with a two person capacity, it is not 

 the only airplane with this feature. There are actually many aircraft that can hold two 

 people. They are the Dodo, Beagle, Maverick, Leviathan, Raindance, Sea Sparrow, Sparrow, 

 Skimmer and Cargobob helicopter. 

 

 

 Easy money: 

 ———– 

 In order to waste time to allow money to accumulate without dealing with CJs eating needs, 

 simply press Triangle in front of the television in your hideout. His health will remain 

 constant, without him needing to eat. You can leave the PlayStation2 idling in this state 

 to accumulate money easily. 

 

 

 Easy money: 

 ———– 

 Find a save point that is close to a betting shop. The one in the Montgomery are is ideal 

 because it is near to the save point where you have to do the four missions for Catalina. 

 Save your game, then go to the betting shop and bet all your money on a horse. It takes 

 awhile to enter the numbers, but is worth it because you can make a huge amount of cash 

 (especially if you bet on horses with odds of 10/1, 11/1, 12/1, etc.). It takes roughly 

 three to four minutes to bet the maximum amount of money, which is $9,999,995. You will 

 not win every time. When you lose, reload your last saved game. It is possible to get 

 $250,000,000 by betting your winnings of $30,000 to $700,000 to $2,000,000 to the 

 maximum bet. 

 

 

 Quick reload: 

 ————- 

 When you are short on time (for example during the gang wars), you can quickly reload 

 by switching to another weapon. Your ammunition must be 1 to 30. When at 0 it automatically 

 does the longer reload. 

 

 

 8-Track mission: 

 —————- 

 Enable the“Slow motion”code and you will be able to easily take first place. This is 

 helpful if you are trying to get the Monster Truck. 

 

 

 Shovel: 

 ——- 

 Go into Ryder’s back yard (to the right of your house) in the Ganton area. There is a 

 shovel next to the back of the  house.

5 elements with C.E | Ninja Saga

Sebenernya cheat ini udah tersebar di blog-blog luar dan juga di forum-forum game, tapi berhubung ada pihak yang memanfaatkan cheat ini seperti jasa joki dan lain-lain lebih baik saya share aja. Kasihan yang belum pada tahu, daripada mereka memakai jasa joki untuk mendapatkan cheat ini lebih baik mereka pake cheat sendiri aja. Cheat untuk di nikmati, bukan untuk di perjualbelikan. Kecuali mereka bikin cheat sendiri ^^

Langsung aja deh, cekidot…..

 

peralatan yang di butuhkan :

 Cheat Engine 

Caranya :

 Buka Char Ninja Saga Kamu Jalankan Cheat Engine Scan Token Yang kamu punya dengan CE (contoh : kamu punya 100 token, kemudian masukkan angka 100 pada kolom scan) Masuk ke Headquarters Convert 1 token kamu ke gold Kemudian keluar dari Headquarters Lalu scan lagi sisa token kamu (contoh : token kamu tinggal 99, lalu masukkan angka 99 ke kolom scan, lalu klik Next Scan) Ketemu 1 address Double klik address tersebut, sehingga address tersebut pindah ke kolom bawah Setelah itu double klik address yang sudah pindah di kolom bawah, dan tambahkan +4 pada address (contoh : xxxxxU6 +4 ) Kemudian rubah value menjadi 2 Checklist/Centang kotak Frozen, yang letaknya di sebelah kiri address Jika kotak jutsu kamu penuh, hilangkan salah satu Jutsu. Sehingga ada ruang kosong satu Pergi ke Academy, lalu pilih elemen ketiga yang ingin kamu pelajari Kadang terjadi error, jika terjadi error kamu tinggal refresh page saja. Dan jutsunya sudah masuk ke kotak jutsu. Jika kamu ingin mempelajari element yang ke 4 dan 5, kamu tinggal ulangi langkah di atas 

 

Cheat ini khusus untuk jutsu gold

Dan cheat ini Permanent !! Jadi berhati-hatilah 

 

 

 

Cheat Weapon Emblem User | C.E

Kali ini saya juga akan posting cheat Ninja Saga dengan menggunakan Cheat Engine. Kali ini kita bisa mendapatkan senjata Rare (langka). Tapi maaf, senjata ini hanya untuk Emblem User. Untuk Previewnya, kalian bisa lihat gambar di bawah ini. Dan niat saya share cheat ini agar kalian tidak usah menggunakan jasa Joki untuk mendapatkan senjata ini ^^

 

Sebenernya cheat ini bisa menggunakan fiddler , tapi untuk sementara yang saya tunjukan menggunakan Cheat Engine. Dan ini PERMANENT !! 

langsung aja deh

 

peralatan yang di butuhkan :

 Cheat Engine 

Caranya :

 Masuk ke Ninja Saga Kemudian Jalankan Cheat Engine Klik gambar komputer, terus pilih“plugin container exe”untuk mozilla, atau icon chrome jika kamu pake chrome (pokoknya sesuaiin sama browser kamu) Masuk ke Kage Room, dan jalankan misi“Escaped Criminals”(LVL 13) Dalam misi itu, usahakan kamu mendapatkan“Healing Scroll”dan“Chakra Scroll” Jika dapat, scan item11 jika kamu mendapatkan Healing Scroll dan item10 jika kamu mendapatkan Chakra Scroll. Dengan Value type : Text Nanti akan muncul address, kemudian klik address itu sehingga address itu akan pindah ke tabel bawah. Ganti Value nya dengan code weapon tersebut (untuk code, kalian bisa lihat di bawah) Setelah itu jalankan misi nya sampai selesai Biar tambah lancar, kamu tinggal Reload (F5) 

 Code Weapon : 

 wpn4 untuk Tonfa wpn8 untuk Tri-Star Shuriken wpn11 untuk Tailed Jutte wpn17 untuk Dual Head Kunai wpn34 untuk Lightning Sai wpn48 untuk Bone Machete wpn58 untuk Thick Broadsword 

 

 NB : DILARANG MEMPERJUAL BELIKAN CHEAT !!!!!!!!!!! 

Cheat Wapon

 Keterangan : 
^ Senjata gold

Sebenarnya cara ini sudah di patch oleh NS. oleh karna itu yg bs kita ambil hanya senjata gold saja. Tp tak apalah…lumayan bs menghemat gold…hehehe…
Caranya sangat mudah…hampir sama dengan penggantian jurus seperti posting saya sebelumnya…hanya saja waktu penggantiannya berbeda…
Yaitu saat kita menjalankan misi yg memiliki bonus senjata / scroll. Ketika kita mendapatkan bonus, seperti tampak pada gambar berikut…

jangan buru2 mengklik ok…
ikuti dulu langkah2 berikut..

 Langkah2: 
- Open Cheat Engine
- setelah kita mendapatkan bonus item berupa“Black Wing Sai”, cari kodenya di daftar kode diatas.
- Setelah tau kodenya yaitu wpn84, masukkan ke cheat engine sebagai teks. kemudian search…
- Ganti dengan kode senjata gold yg se-digit. (langkah2 penggantiannya sama seperti penggantian jurus)
- Kembali ke halaman NS, klik ok dan selesaikan misi sampai selesai.
- Setelah itu reload atau refresh halaman.
- masuk lagi ke char kita dan lihat senjata sudah ada di Gear.

Selamat mencoba….

 Segitiga 
 
 Agu 16 
 
Posted by Cerdas Pandai 
 
 Segitiga atau segi tiga adalah nama suatu bentuk yang dibuat dari tiga sisi yang berupa garis lurus dan tiga sudut . Matematikawan Euclid yang hidup sekitar tahun 300 SM menemukan bahwa jumlah ketiga sudut di suatu segi tiga adalah 180 derajat. Hal ini memungkinkan kita menghitung besarnya salah satu sudut bila dua sudut lainnya sudah diketahui.

[ sunting ]Klasifikasi segitiga

Menurut panjang sisinya:

 Segitiga sama sisi adalah segitiga yang ketiga sisinya sama panjang. Sebagai akibatnya semua sudutnya juga sama besar, yaitu 60 o . Segitiga sama kaki adalah segitiga yang dua dari tiga sisinya sama panjang. Segitiga ini memiliki dua sudut yang sama besar. Segitiga sembarang adalah segitiga yang ketiga sisinya berbeda panjangnya. Besar semua sudutnya juga berbeda. 

 Segitiga sama sisi Segitiga sama kaki Segitiga sembarang 

Menurut besar sudut terbesarnya:

 Segitiga siku-siku adalah segitiga yang salah satu besar sudutnya sama dengan 90 o . Sisi di depan sudut 90 o disebut hipotenusa atau sisi miring. Segitiga lancip adalah segitiga yang besar semua sudut&lt;90 o Segitiga tumpul adalah segitiga yang besar salah satu sudutnya&gt;90 o 

 Segitiga siku-siku Segitiga tumpul Segitiga lancip 

[ sunting ]Lingkaran dalam dan luar segitiga

Suatu lingkaran yang berada di dalam segitiga serta menyinggung ketiga sisi segitiga tersebut disebut lingkaran dalam segitiga . Jari-jari lingkaran dalam segitiga bisa dicari dengan rumus:
 dimana r adalah jari-jari lingkaran dalam segitiga, L adalah luas segitiga dan s adalah setengah keliling segitiga. 
Suatu lingkaran yang berada di luar segitiga serta keliling lingkaran tersebut menyinggung perpotongan tiga garis segitiga disebut lingkaran luar segitiga . Jari-jari lingkaran luar segitiga dapat dicari dengan rumus:
 dimana R adalah jari-jari lingkaran luar segitiga; a , b dan c adalah tiga sisi segitiga dan L adalah luas segitiga. 
[ sunting ]Mencari luas dan keliling segitiga

 atau 

 Teorema Heron 
 
Teorema Heron biasanya digunakan untuk mencari luas dari suatu segitiga sembarang. a, b dan c adalah ketiga sisi segitiga.

 

 Segitiga sama sisi 
 
Untuk mencari luas dan keliling segitiga sama sisi yang bersisi a dapat digunakan rumus sebagai berikut:

 

[ sunting ]Dalil Pythagoras
 
 
Segitiga siku-siku
 
 Dalil Pythagoras hanya berlaku pada segitiga siku-siku. Pythagoras menyatakan bahwa: 

Jika ada tiga buah bilangan a, b dan c yang memenuhi persamaan di atas, maka ketiga bilangan tersebut disebut sebagai Triple Pythagoras . Triple Pythagoras tersebut dapat dibangun menggunakan rumus berikut dengan memasukkan sebuah nilai n dengan n adalah bilangan bulat positif.

Rumus Bangun Datar–Matematika
 Sat, 22/04/2006–1:59pm — godam64
 
Rumus Bujur Sangkar
Bujur sangkar adalah bangun datar yang memiliki empat buah sisi sama panjang
- Keliling : Panjang salah satu sisi dikali 4 (4S) (AB + BC + CD + DA)
- Luas : Sisi dikali sisi (S x S)

Rumus Persegi Panjang
Persegi panjang adalah bangun datar mirip bujur sangkar namun dua sisi yang berhadapan lebih pendek atau lebih panjang dari

dua sisi yang lain. Dua sisi yang panjang disebut panjang, sedangkan yang pendek disebut lebar.
- Keliling : Panjang tambah lebar kali 2 ((p+l)x2) (AB + BC + CD + DA)
- Luas : Panjang dikali lebar (pl)

Rumus Segitiga
- Keliling : Sisi pertama + sisi kedua + sisi ketiga (AB + BC + CA)
- Luas : Panjang alas dikali pangjang tinggi dibagi dua (a x t / 2)

Rumus Lingkaran
- Keliling : diameter dikali phi (d x phi) atau phi dikali 2 jari-jari (phi x (r + r)
- Luas : phi dikali jari-jari dikali jari-jari (phi x r x r)
- phi = 22/7 = 3,14

Rumus Jajar Genjang atau Jajaran Genjang
- Keliling : Penjumlahan dari keempat sisi yang ada (AB + BC + CD + DA)
- Luas : alas dikali tinggi (a x t)

Rumus Belah Ketupat
- Keliling : Penjumlahan dari keempat sisi yang ada (AB + BC + CD + DA)
- Luas : alas dikali panjang diagonal dibagi 2 (a x diagonal / 2)
- Diagonal : Garis tengah dua sisi berlawanan

Rumus Trapesium
- Keliling : Penjumlahan dari keempat sisi yang ada (AB + BC + CD + DA)
- Luas : Jumlah sisi sejajar dikali tinggi dibagi 2 ((AB + CD) / 2)

 Rumus Kubus 
- Volume : Sisi pertama dikali sisi kedua dikali sisi ketiga (S pangkat 3)

 Rumus Balok
 - Volume : Panjang dikali lebar dikali tinggi (p x l x t)

 Rumus Bola 
- Volume : phi dikali jari-jari dikali tinggi pangkat tiga kali 4/3 (4/3 x phi x r x t x t x t)
- Luas : phi dikali jari-jari kuadrat dikali empat (4 x phi x r x r)

 Rumus Limas Segi Empat 
- Volume : Panjang dikali lebar dikali tinggi dibagi tiga (p x l x t x 1/3)
- Luas : ((p + l) t) + (p x l)

 Rumus Tabung 
- Volume : phi dikali jari-jari dikali jari-jari dikali tinggi (phi x r2 x t)
- Luas : (phi x r x 2) x (t x r)

 Rumus Kerucut 
- Volume : phi dikali jari-jari dikali jari-jari dikali tinggi dibagi tiga (phi x r2 x t x 1/3)
- Luas : (phi x r) x (S x r)
- S : Sisi miring kerucut dari alas ke puncak (bukan tingi)

 Rumus Prisma Segitiga Siku-siku 
- Volume : alas segitiga kali tinggi segitiga kali tinggi prisma bagi dua (as x ts x tp )

 MACAM-MACAM 

 BATIK DI INDONESIA 

 

 

 I. Arti dan Cara membuat Batik 
 
 Arti kata batik :  para sarjana ahli seni rupa, baik yang berkebangsaan Indonesia maupun yang bangsa asing, belum mencapai kata sepakat tentang apa sebenarnya arti kata batik itu.   Ada yang mengatakan bahwa sebutan batik berasal dari kata tik yang terdapat di dalam kata titik .  Titik berarti juga tetes.  Memang di dalam membuat kain batik dilakukan pula penetesan lilin di atas kain putih.  Ada juga yang mencari asal kata batik di dalam sumber-sumber tertulis kuno.  Menurut pendapat ini, kata batik dihubungkan dengan kata tulis atau lukis.  Dengan demikian, asal mula batik dihubungkan pula dengan seni lukis dan gambar pada umumnya. . Batik merupakan warisan nenek moyang Indonesia ( Jawa ) yang sampai saat ini masih ada. Batik juga pertama kali diperkenalkan kepada dunia oleh Presiden Soeharto, yang pada waktu itu memakai batik pada Konferensi PBB. 
 
 
 Cara membatik :   alat untuk membatik ialah canting .  Terbuat dari bambu, berkepala tembaga serta bercerat atau bermulut, canting ini berfungsi seperti sebuah pulpen.  Canting ini dipakai untuk menyendok lilin cair yang panas, yang dipakai sebagain bahan penutup atau perlindung terhadap zat warna .  Sebelum pembatik melelehkan lilin di kain putih, banyak langkah yang harus dilalui dulu oleh kain itu.  Perkerjaan persiapan berupa pencelupan dalam minyak tumbuh-tumbuhan serta larutan soda, gunanya untuk memudahkan lilin melekat dan zat warna meresap . 
 
 
 Setiap kali kain hendak diberi warna lain, bagian-bagian yang tidak boleh kena zat warna ditutup dengan lilin, sehingga makin banyak warna yang dipakai untuk menghias kain batik, makin lama juga pekerjaan menutup itu.  Pada taraf yang penghabisan lilin dibuang dengan merebus kain dalam air mendidih.  Sesudah itu kain batik keluar dengan warna-warnanya yang indah serta pola-polanya yang terpilih. Teknik membatik telah dikenal sejak ribuan tahun yang silam. Tidak ada keterangan sejarah yang cukup jelas tentang asal usul batik. Ada yang menduga teknik ini berasal dari bangsa Sumeria , kemudian dikembangkan di Jawa setelah dibawa oleh para pedagang India . Saat ini batik bisa ditemukan di banyak negara seperti Indonesia , Malaysia , Thailand , India , Sri Lanka , dan Iran . Selain di Asia , batik juga sangat populer di beberapa negara di benua Afrika . Walaupun demikian, batik yang sangat terkenal di dunia adalah batik yang berasal dari Indonesia, terutama dari Jawa . 
 
 

 

 

 II. Motif-Motif Baik Indonesia Dan Maknanya 

 

 Motif-motif batik Indonesia yang sudah ada sejak turun-temurun masing-masing memiliki makna dan peruntukan tersendiri :

 1. Motif Parang 

motif diagonal bersudut 45 drajat. Diantara 2 deret parang diisi dengan motif mlinjon. Mlinjon berasal dari kata melinjo (biji pohon Eso/Gnetum gnemon) yang merupakan bahan mentah emping.
Parang berasal dari kata pereng atau tebing/lereng dan juga berarti senjata. Menurut sejarah, motif parang tercipta ketika Raja Mataram berkelana dan menemukan tebing untuk bertapa. Dulu kain bermotif parang hanya boleh digunakan untuk kerabat keraton.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 2.  Motif Berawalan Sida

Motif kawung berasal dari bentuk buah kawung (buah pohon aren atau kolang-kaling) tp  ada pula anggapan bahwa kawung adalah bunga teratai yang melambangkan umur panjang dan kesucian.

 

 

 

 

 4. Motif Pringgodani atau pringgondani ? saya agak lupa tulisannya

Pringgondani adalah sebuah nama kerajaan tempat asal Gatotkaca (putra Bima-saudara tengah keluarga Pandawa dalam cerita Wayang Kulit Purwa). Motif Pringgondani termasuk kelompok pola Semen dan pola non geometris.

 9. Motif Batik Yogyakarta 

Yogya memiliki kesamaan dengan Solo, Yogya mempunyai tradisi dan adat istiadat kraton dan batik Yogya juga memiliki lambang-lambang simbolis yang erat hubunganya dengan falsafah Hindu Jawa, walaupun motif batik Yogya tidak memiliki arti simbolis sebanyak Solo. Kadang batik Yogya mempunyai nama yang sama dengan batik Solo namun ternyata penampilannya berbeda, seperti ragam hias semen rama.


Yogya mempunyai motif dengan isen–isen khas dan ukel cantel, ukel tutul dan ukel monte. Batik Yogya juga memiliki banyak motif nitik, seperti nitik jaarbeurs. Jaarbeurs adalah nama yang diberikan oleh juragan batik H.Bilal pada motif ini a karena ragam hias tersebut mendapat penghargaan dalam pekan raya Jaarbeurs di zaman kolonialisme Belanda. Motif khas Yogya yang lain adalah kawung semar, kawung beton, perang wenang, werkudoro dan keong sri, tambal kitiran, udan liris.

Motif batik Yogya yang memiliki makna simbolis antara lain adalah motif grompol, arti katanya adalah berkumpul atau bersatu, kain motif ini biasanya digunakan pada acara perkawinan, dengan harapan berkumpulnya segala sesuatu yang baik-baik, seperti rezeki, kebahagiaan, dan lain-lain.

Ragam hias tambal mempunyai arti kata menambah atau memperbaiki sesuatu yang kurang, yang kemudian diharapkan dapat membantu menyehatkan si pemakai yang sakit dan juga agar dapat menolak bahaya.


Yogya juga memiliki batik yang bermotif berdasarkan alam desa sekitarnya yang dibuat di desa Bantul. Sedangkan batik masyarakat Cina di Yogya salah satunya adalah menggunakan motif parang wenang, dengan latar belakang putih bersih.

Irregular Verbs

Irregular verbs are an important feature of English. We use irregular verbs a lot when speaking, less when writing. Of course, the most famous English verb of all, the verb“to be”, is irregular.

What is the difference between regular verbs and irregular verbs?

   Base Form Past Simple Past Participle With regular verbs, the rule is simple… The past simple and past participle always end in -ed: finish finish ed finish ed stop stopp ed stopp ed work work ed work ed But with irregular verbs, there is no rule… Sometimes the verb changes completely: sing sang sung Sometimes there is“half”a change: buy bought bought Sometimes there is no change: cut cut cut
