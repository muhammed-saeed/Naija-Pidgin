My Story -- by Jennifer Panlaque
 
  View Larger 

Jennifer finds it hard to imagine life without her mother, Betty.
 

 My mother was a kind and thoughtful person. She lived her life helping others. My mother was my best friend. We did everything together. Every person she came in contact with will always remember her. She would help anyone she could. 

Betty Wise was a hardworking woman. On Wednesday morning, March 2, 2005, she got ready for work just like every other day to head out to her job as a manager at a Checkers fast food restaurant in Kissimee, Fla. Little did Betty know that this would be the last time she would get ready for work and see her family.

 She left our house and proceeded to the Checkers at Old Town as normal. About 11:45 p.m. a customer walked up to the order window to place an order. 


At that point, police say a black male ordered a spicy chicken sandwich and handed the cashier two one dollar bills. As the cashier opened the register, the suspect pulled out a black revolver and pointed it toward the employee.

 

 My mother worked at the restaurant for 13 years without one single incident. I guess you never know when your time will be up. 

An Ordinary Night Turns Deadly
 
  View Larger 

Betty was a warm and loving person to everyone she knew.
 

 The cashier tried to warn my mom who was the manager of the restaurant. My mother turned to see what was happening, and the gun went off. She was in the direct line of the bullet... My mother&apos;s body automatically was in shock. The cashier ran over to her to help as the robber ran off into the distance. There were only two employees at the time and herself. 

This regular night at work had turned into a horrific crime scene. The fire department arrived quickly and tended to Betty, but it was too late. She passed away on the way to the hospital. K-9 dogs were brought to the scene to track the killer&apos;s scent, and other police units in other areas were called in to assist in the manhunt. But it was simply too late. The suspect got away.

 The police have a composite sketch of the robber, and it has been passed out around the area of the crime. Local news has been broadcasting this homicide since an hour after it happened. They still have no luck on any aspect of this case, because it is a tourist area. Please help us solve our mother&apos;s murder case. We can not let this murder go unsolved. 


Police describe the suspect as a light skinned black male, 5&apos;9&quot;-6&apos;, 190-210 lbs, and having a mustache or possibly a goatee. The suspect is believed to have been wearing dark colored jeans, a black jacket, and a gray hooded sweatshirt.
 



A Life That Will Never Be Forgotten


 You never know when your time is going to be up, and I don&apos;t want to miss anything with my kids. My mother and I were together all the time, so it&apos;s hard to just get through the days sometimes. She lived at my house... I have a hard getting up in the mornings sometimes. Going shopping is really different. I&apos;ve never gone alone, so when I go now its not the same. It makes me want to cry just writing this letter. When I see my kids achieve things and do things, I have to try not to cry thinking about how it would be if she was here to see them... I often wonder if my kids will even remember their nana. My daughter was only 4 at the time and my son 6. I hope that they never forget her, because they meant the world to her.

In March 2006, a year after Betty Wise was murdered during her shift at Checkers restaurant in Kissimmee, Fla., her town held a candlelight vigil to pay their respects. Local news stations took an interest in the event and covered it, offering a number to a crime tip hotline for anyone who might have information on the case.

The news coverage paid off when an anonymous tipster called the hotline and claimed they were a friend of the driver of the getaway car that held up the restaurant.  Police followed up on the tip and arrested 34-year-old Marlo F. Cobb, who then implicated her ex-boyfriend, Sean Orlando Camacho, as the gunman. Police say Camacho was also arrested and charged with Felony First Degree Murder. According to police, Cobb is being held without bond at the Osceola County Jail until his trial at the end of January in 2007. Cobb took a plea bargain for 30 years as an accomplice to the murder.
