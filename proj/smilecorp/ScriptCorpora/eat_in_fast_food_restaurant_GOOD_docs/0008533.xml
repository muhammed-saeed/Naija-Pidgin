[My paper] S Stender , J Dyerberg , A Astrup 1Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Gentofte Hospital University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. Although nutrition experts might be able to navigate the menus of fast-food restaurant chains, and based on the nutritional information, compose apparently &apos;healthy&apos; meals, there are still many reasons why frequent fast-food consumption at most chains is unhealthy and contributes to weight gain, obesity, type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease. Fast food generally has a high-energy density, which, together with large portion sizes, induces over consumption of calories. In addition, we have found it to be a myth that the typical fast-food meal is the same worldwide. Chemical analyses of 74 samples of fast-food menus consisting of French fries and fried chicken (nuggets/hot wings) bought in McDonalds and KFC outlets in 35 countries in 2005-2006 showed that the total fat content of the same menu varies from 41 to 65 g at McDonalds and from 42 to 74 g at KFC. In addition, fast food from major chains in most countries still contains unacceptably high levels of industrially produced trans-fatty acids (IP-TFA). IP-TFA have powerful biological effects and may contribute to increased weight gain, abdominal obesity, type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease. The food quality and portion size need to be improved before it is safe to eat frequently at most fast-food chains.International Journal of Obesity advance online publication, 24 April 2007; doi:10.1038/sj.ijo.0803616.

[My paper] Carmen Piernas , Barry M Popkin Department of Nutrition, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA. BACKGROUND Larger portion sizes of foods and beverages could affect overall energy intake at meals and promote overeating. OBJECTIVE We investigated trends in portion sizes of energy-dense foods and energy intakes at eating occasions in US children and adolescents. DESIGN Four US nationally representative surveys from 1977 to 2006 were analyzed (n = 31,337). We measured trends in portion sizes (kcal, g, and mL) of selected foods [sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), salty snacks, desserts, French fries, burgers, pizzas, and Mexican fast foods] and energy intake (kcal) at eating occasions during which selected foods were consumed. Trends were reported by age group (2-6-, 7-12-, and 13-18-y-olds), sex, and socioeconomic status. RESULTS In 2003-2006, the selected foods accounted for 38% of daily energy intake in 13-18-y-olds, 35% of the daily energy intake in 7-12-y-olds, and 28% of the daily energy intake in 2-6-y-olds. In all age groups, larger portion sizes of pizza coincided with higher energy intakes at eating occasions during which pizzas were consumed. In 7-12- and 13-18-y-olds, higher energy intakes at meals coincided with larger portion sizes of SSBs, French fries, or salty snacks. In all age groups, nonsignificant larger portions of Mexican fast foods were related to higher energy intakes at meals. Adolescent boys consumed larger portion sizes of the selected foods and had higher energy intakes at meals for all periods than did girls (P&lt;0.01). The percentage of kilocalories from pizza within a meal increased more sharply in non-Hispanic African Americans, in Hispanics, and in the group with a low household education than in the other groups. CONCLUSIONS Adolescents are more susceptible to increased portion sizing than are younger children. The group of non-Hispanic African Americans and Hispanics and individuals with a lower education represents key concerns for public health policies.

[My paper] Ryan T Hurt , Thomas H Frazier , Stephen A McClave , Lee M Kaplan Division of General Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. Obesity is one of the leading causes of preventable death in the United States, second only to smoking. The annual number of deaths attributed to obesity is estimated to be as high as 400,000. Nearly 70% of the adult U.S. population is overweight or obese. The historical viewpoint toward obesity has deemed it to be a lifestyle choice or characterological flaw. However, given the emerging research into the development of obesity and its related complications, our perspective is changing. It is now clear that obesity is a heterogeneous disease with many different subtypes, which involves an interplay between genetic and environmental factors. The current epidemic of obesity is the result of an obesogenic environment (which includes energy-dense foods and a lack of physical activity) in individuals who have a genetic susceptibility for developing obesity. The pathophysiology associated with weight gain is much more complex than originally thought. The heterogeneous nature of the disease makes the development of treatment strategies for obesity difficult. Obesity in general is associated with increased all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality (from cardiovascular, diabetic, hepatic, and neoplastic causes). Yet despite increased overall mortality rates, current evidence suggests that when these same patients are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), the obesity provides some protection against mortality. At present, there is no clear explanation for this obesity conundrum in critical illness.

[My paper] L K Fraser , K L Edwards , J E Cade , G P Clarke School of Geography, University of Leeds, University Road, Leeds, UK. l.k.fraser@leeds.ac.uk OBJECTIVE To assess the association between the consumption of fast food (FF) and body mass index (BMI) of teenagers in a large UK birth cohort. METHODS A structural equation modelling (SEM) approach was chosen to allow direct statistical testing of a theoretical model. SEM is a combination of confirmatory factor and path analysis, which allows for the inclusion of latent (unmeasured) variables. This approach was used to build two models: the effect of FF outlet visits and food choices and the effect of FF exposure on consumption and BMI. RESULTS A total of 3620 participants had data for height and weight from the age 13 clinic and the frequency of FF outlet visits, and so were included in these analyses. This SEM model of food choices showed that increased frequency of eating at FF outlets is positively associated with higher consumption of unhealthy foods (β=0.29, P&lt;0.001) and negatively associated with the consumption of healthy foods (β=-1.02, P&lt;0.001). The SEM model of FF exposure and BMI showed that higher exposure to FF increases the frequency of visits to FF outlets (β=0.61, P&lt;0.001), which is associated with higher body mass index standard deviation score (BMISDS; β=0.08, P&lt;0.001). Deprivation was the largest contributing variable to the exposure (β=9.2, P&lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS The teenagers who ate at FF restaurants consumed more unhealthy foods and were more likely to have higher BMISDS than those teenagers who did not eat frequently at FF restaurants. Teenagers who were exposed to more takeaway foods at home ate more frequently at FF restaurants and eating at FF restaurants was also associated with lower intakes of vegetables and raw fruit in this cohort. Gastroenterol Hepatol (N Y). 2010 Dec ;6 (12):780-92  21301632  The obesity epidemic: challenges, health initiatives, and implications for gastroenterologists. [My paper] Ryan T Hurt , Christopher Kulisek , Laura A Buchanan , Stephen A McClave Dr. Hurt serves as an Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of General Internal Medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and as Assistant Clinical Professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of Louisville School of Medicine in Louisville, Kentucky. Obesity is the next major epidemiologic challenge facing today&apos;s doctors, with the annual allocation of healthcare resources for the disease and related comorbidities projected to exceed $150 billion in the United States. The incidence of obesity has risen in the United States over the past 30 years; 60% of adults are currently either obese or overweight. Obesity is associated with a higher incidence of a number of diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Consumption of fast food, trans fatty acids (TFAs), and fructose-combined with increasing portion sizes and decreased physical activity-has been implicated as a potential contributing factor in the obesity crisis. The use of body mass index (BMI) alone is of limited utility for predicting adverse cardiovascular outcomes, but the utility of this measure may be strengthened when combined with waist circumference and other anthropomorphic measurements. Certain public health initiatives have helped to identify and reduce some of the factors contributing to obesity. In New York City and Denmark, for example, such initiatives have succeeded in passing legislation to reduce or remove TFAs from residents&apos; diets. The obesity epidemic will likely change practice for gastroenterologists, as shifts will be seen in the incidence of obesity-related gastrointestinal disorders, disease severity, and the nature of comorbidities. The experience gained with previous epidemiologic problems such as smoking should help involved parties to expand needed health initiatives and increase the likelihood of preventing future generations from suffering the consequences of obesity.

[My paper] Jennifer L Pomeranz Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University, CT, USA. The evidence reveals that young children are targeted by food and beverage advertisers but are unable to comprehend the commercial context and persuasive intent of marketing. Although the First Amendment protects commercial speech, it does not protect deceptive and misleading speech for profit. Marketing directed at children may fall into this category of unprotected speech. Further, children do not have the same First Amendment right to receive speech as adults. For the first time since the Federal Trade Commission&apos;s original attempt to regulate marketing to children in the 1970s (termed KidVid), the political, scientific, and legal climate coalesce to make the time well-suited to reevaluate the FTC&apos;s authority for action. This paper analyzes the constitutional authority for the FTC to regulate television food marketing directed at children as deceptive in light of the most robust public health evidence on the subject.

[My paper] Seddigheh Asgary , Bahar Nazari , Nizal Sarrafzadegan , Sahar Parkhideh , Salbali Saberi , Ahmad Esmaillzadeh , Leila Azadbakht Isfahan Cardiovascular Research Center, WHO Collaborating Center, Applied physiology research center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, PO. Box: 81465-1148, Iran. s_asgari@ crc mui.ac.ir. Although the disadvantages of trans fatty acids (TFAs) are widely mentioned, limited data are available on the TFAs contents of Iranian foods, including fast foods. The aim of this study was to quantify the amounts of common fatty acids in several fast foods in Iran, with specific focus on TFAs. The most commonly consumed fast foods in Iran: sausage, calbas, hamburgers and pizzas, were randomly selected seven times from products available in supermarkets and restaurants. Each time a 10 g sample was drawn and prepared for fatty acid analysis. Total and individual fatty acids were quantified according to standard methods by gas chromatography with 60 meter capillary column and flame ionization detector. The most common saturated fatty acids in Iranian fast foods is stearic acid (C18:0) which ranged from 14.0% to 20.9%. Saturated fatty acid content in calbas was significantly higher than that found in other groups. Trans fatty acids constitute almost 23.6% to 30.6% of total fatty acids of these products. The most common TFA in these fast foods was elaidic acid (C18:1 9t). Total cis unsaturated fatty acid content of tested fast foods varied from 25.3 %( in sausage) to 46.8(in calbas) with oleic acid (C18:1 9c) followed by linoleic acid (C18:2) being the most common fatty acids in these products. This study showed higher TFAs contents in commercially available fast foods compared to the amounts recommended by dietary guidelines in Iran. Further studies must assess the effects of these fatty acids on human health. J Am Diet Assoc. 2009 Aug ;109 (8):1354-5  19631040  Dietary patterns may modify central adiposity. [My paper] George A Bray , Catherine M Champagne Eur J Public Health. 2009 Jul 8;:  19587232  Value for money or making the healthy choice: the impact of proportional pricing on consumers&apos; portion size choices. [My paper] Willemijn M Vermeer , Esther Alting , Ingrid H M Steenhuis , Jacob C Seidell Institute for Health Sciences, VU University Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Background: Large food portion sizes are determinants of a high caloric intake, especially if they have been made attractive through value size pricing (i.e. lower unit prices for large than for small portion sizes). The purpose of the two questionnaire studies that are reported in this article was to assess the impact of proportional pricing (i.e. removing beneficial prices for large sizes) on people&apos;s portion size choices of high caloric food and drink items. Methods: Both studies employed an experimental design with a proportional pricing condition and a value size pricing condition. Study 1 was conducted in a fast food restaurant (N = 150) and study 2 in a worksite cafeteria (N = 141). Three different food products (i.e. soft drink, chicken nuggets in study 1 and a hot meal in study 2) with corresponding prices were displayed on pictures in the questionnaire. Outcome measures were consumers&apos; intended portion size choices. Results: No main effects of pricing were found. However, confronted with proportional pricing a trend was found for overweight fast food restaurant visitors being more likely to choose small portion sizes of chicken nuggets (OR = 4.31, P = 0.07) and less likely to choose large soft drink sizes (OR = 0.07, P = 0.04). Conclusion: Among a general public, proportional pricing did not reduce consumers&apos; size choices. However, pricing strategies can help overweight and obese consumers selecting appropriate portion sizes of soft drink and high caloric snacks. More research in realistic settings with actual behaviour as outcome measure is required.

[My paper] Marianne Furnes , Chun-Mei Zhao , Duan Chen Department of Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Laboratory Center (3rd Floor-East Side), Erling Skjalgssons gate 1, 7006, Trondheim, Norway. BACKGROUND: We challenge the current belief that obesity is a result of overnutrition by studying a rodent model of human obesity. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats at 3 weeks of age were fed with a mixed normal diet of 10% fat and high-fat diet of 60% fat (50:50) for 2 weeks and then turned to 100% high-fat diet until 43 weeks of age. Body weight gain was recorded, and food intake, eating behavior, and metabolic variables were measured by a comprehensive laboratory animal monitoring system. Body composition was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Ghrelin/obestatin-producing A-like cells in the stomach were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Rats on high-fat diet were overweight at 9 weeks of age and later became obese characterized by increased body weight and excess fat deposition. There were no obesity-prone, obesity middle tertile, and obesity-resistant subgroups in rats on high-fat diet. The young rats on high-fat diet, even before becoming overweight (i.e., 8 weeks), consumed larger portion of meal (kilocalorie per meal) and ate faster but less frequent than the rats on normal diet. Obese rats had reduced food intake (expressed as gram per 100-g body weight per 24 h), unchanged calorie intake (kilocalorie per 100-g body weight per 24 h), and energy expenditure (kilocalorie per hour per 100-g body weight), and increased number of A-like cells in the stomach. CONCLUSION: Large size of meal, but not overnutrition, appears to be responsible for high-fat diet-induced obesity in rats. We propose a consideration that prevention strategies for obesity epidemic should strongly focus on meal size at early childhood and adolescence.

[My paper] J Dyerberg , D C Eskesen , P W Andersen , A Astrup , B Buemann , J H Christensen , P Clausen , B F Rasmussen , E B Schmidt , T Tholstrup , E Toft , S Toubro , S Stender 1Department of Human Nutrition, The Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University, Frederiksberg, Denmark. BACKGROUND:: Studies of long-term intake of industrially produced trans fatty acids (TFA) and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) suggest opposite effects on cardiovascular disease risk. Common mechanisms of action are probable. OBJECTIVE:: To examine the effects on cardiovascular risk markers of dietary enrichment with TFA or n-3 PUFA. DESIGN:: Randomized, double-blind, parallel intervention trial. SETTING:: Department of Human Nutrition, The Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University. SUBJECTS:: In all, 87 healthy males included, 79 completed. INTERVENTION:: Subjects were randomly assigned to 8 weeks of a daily intake of 33 g of experimental fats from either partially hydrogenated soy oil containing 20 g of TFA, 12 g of fish oil with approximately 4 g of n-3 PUFA and 21 g of control fat, or 33 g of control fat. The experimental fats were incorporated into bakery products. Plasma lipids, blood pressure, heart rate variability (HRV), arterial dilatory capacity, compliance, and distensibility were recorded before and after intervention and at follow-up 12 weeks after the intervention. RESULTS:: High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) decreased in the TFA group and triglycerides and mean arterial blood pressure decreased in the n-3 PUFA group compared to the control group. HRV, arterial dilatory capacity, compliance, and distensibility were unchanged. CONCLUSION:: The results indicate that the association between coronary heart disease risk and intake of TFA and n-3 PUFA relates only modestly to changes in traditional risk markers.

[My paper] A Belza , S Toubro , S Stender , A Astrup 1Department of Human Nutrition, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. Aims:To dissociate the possible differential effects of negative energy balance and reduction in body fat mass (FM) on inflammatory markers: C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, interleukin-6 (IL-6), haptoglobin, transferrin and the adipokines leptin and adiponectin.Methods:Thirty-three obese subjects (BMI: 34.0+/-3.1 kg/m(2), age: 43.0+/-10.5 years, mean+/-s.d., 16 men) participated in a 20-week controlled dietary intervention divided into four periods. Weight reduction was induced by an 8-week low energy diet (3.4 MJ d(-1))(LED-1) followed by a 4-week weight maintenance program (M-1). Subsequently participants underwent an additional 4-week LED (4.2 MJ d(-1))(LED-2) followed by a final 4-week weight maintenance diet (M-2). Blood samples and anthropometrics were assessed at baseline and after LED-1, M-1, LED-2 and M-2.Results:Body weight was significantly reduced by 13%(13.7+/-4.0 kg, P&lt;0.0001) after LED-1. However, a reduction in high-sensitive CRP (hs-CRP) by 35%(-1.1 (95% CI:-2.5:0.2) mg l(-1), P=0.02) only became apparent after LED-2, which produced an additional weight loss of 2.9 kg compared to baseline, and it was maintained after M-2 (-1.0 (-1.4:0.4) mg l(-1), P=0.02). Also IL-6 was reduced by 21%(-0.6 (-2.4:0.2) ng l(-1), P=0.02) after M-2. The reductions in hs-CRP and IL-6 were both associated with reduction in FM but not body weight. Haptoglobin, transferrin and leptin were significantly reduced after both LED-1 and LED-2, but increased during weight maintenance. Adiponectin was not significantly changed during the intervention.Conclusions:The results suggest that, whereas haptoglobin and transferrin respond more rapidly and are more susceptible to the acute change in energy balance, a reduction in hs-CRP and IL-6 seems to be achieved by a reduction in FM when a new steady state has been established.International Journal of Obesity advance online publication, 24 February 2009; doi:10.1038/ijo.2009.27.

[My paper] A Due , S Toubro , S Stender , A R Skov , A Astrup Department of Human Nutrition, Centre for Advanced Food Studies, The Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University, Rolighedsvej 30, 1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark. AIM: Increased levels of inflammatory markers have been associated with weight gain and cardiovascular disease. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of diets high in either carbohydrate or protein on the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP), haptoglobin and transferrin in plasma after weight loss. METHODS: Fifty overweight subjects [age: 18-56 years, body mass index (BMI): 27-34] were randomly assigned to an ad libitum, fat-reduced diet (30% of energy, E%), either high in protein and low in carbohydrate (25 E and 45 E% respectively) or high in carbohydrate and low in protein (58 E and 12 E% respectively), during 6 months of strictly controlled dietary intervention with dietary counselling. RESULTS: An average reduction of 25% in CRP and an average increase of 20% in haptoglobin and transferrin were seen in both groups, however, these changes were not significant. In cross-sectional analyses after the intervention CRP was associated with fat mass (r = 0.323, p = 0.03), and the changes in CRP were associated with various indices of body fatness (Deltabody weight r = 0.346, p = 0.02). Changes in body fatness were positively associated with Deltatransferrin (r = 0.344, p = 0.02) and nearly significantly associated with Deltahaptoglobin (r = 0.271, p = 0.07) after 6 months. Multiple regression analysis showed no associations between dietary protein and carbohydrate content and serum CRP, haptoglobin or transferrin concentrations, and this remained unaltered after adjustment for weight change. CONCLUSION: Dietary carbohydrate/protein ratio has no effect on inflammatory markers, but the study confirmed that body fatness is positively associated with levels of serum CRP.

Update 2001] [My paper] S Stender , J Dyerberg Klinisk biokemisk afdeling, Amtssygehuset i Gentofte. The contribution of a high intake of trans fatty acids to the risk of coronary heart disease has gained further support since the report from the Danish Nutrition Council in 1994. Any deleterious effect of trans fatty acids on the human fetus and newborn infants has not been negated. Their possible effect on cancer is still unsettled. The daily intake of trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated oils in Denmark was in 1994 about 2.5 grams (recommended 2.0 grams) and has since decreased, mainly due to a reduction of the trans fatty acid content in Danish margarines. Population groups with eating habits that include frequent intake of French fries, micro-oven popcorn, chocolate bars, fast food, etc., may consume trans fatty acids in amounts far exceeding the recommended maximum levels. The Danish Nutrition Council recommends that the addition of industrially produced trans fatty acids to food stuffs ceases before 2005 and until then that declaration of the content in foodstuffs becomes mandatory.

The intake of trans fatty acids from margarine in Denmark was in 1991 on average about 2.5 gram/person/day, and for about 150,000 Danes more than 5 gram/person/day. Several recent case-control studies and a large cohort study as well as clinical ward studies suggest that the intake of trans fatty acids enhances atherogenesis to the same extent or possibly even more than saturated fatty acids. In addition a few studies suggest that the intake of trans fatty acids by the pregnant mother impairs growth of the human foetus. On this background it seems reasonable to reduce the intake of trans fatty acids as much as possible. This could be implemented by a reduction in the fat content of the diet together with a reduction of trans fatty acid content to less than 5% in all margarines. This would ensure that Danes--including pregnant and nursing women--with a high intake of margarine on average consume less than 2 gram of trans fatty acids of vegetables origin per day. This amount corresponds to intake in low risk groups in several studies.

 CMAJ. 2012 Apr 16;:  22508978  The variability of reported salt levels in fast foods across six countries: opportunities for salt reduction. [My paper] Elizabeth Dunford , Jacqueline Webster , Mark Woodward , Sebastien Czernichow , Wen Lun Yuan , Katharine Jenner , Cliona Ni Mhurchu , Michael Jacobson , Norm Campbell , Bruce Neal BACKGROUND:Several fast food companies have made commitments to reduce the levels of salt in the foods they serve, but technical issues are often cited as a barrier to achieving substantial reductions. Our objective was to examine the reported salt levels for products offered by leading multinational fast food chains. METHODS:Data on salt content for products served by six fast food chains operating in Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States were collected by survey in April 2010. Mean salt contents (and their ranges) were calculated and compared within and between countries and companies. RESULTS:We saw substantial variation in the mean salt content for different categories of products. For example, the salads we included in our survey contained 0.5 g of salt per 100 g, whereas the chicken products we included contained 1.6 g. We also saw variability between countries: chicken products from the UK contained 1.1 g of salt per 100 g, whereas chicken products from the US contained 1.8 g. Furthermore, the mean salt content of food categories varied between companies and between the same products in different countries (e.g., McDonald&apos;s Chicken McNuggets contain 0.6 g of salt per 100 g in the UK, but 1.6 g of salt per 100 g in the US). INTERPRETATION:The salt content of fast foods varies substantially, not only by type of food, but by company and country in which the food is produced. Although the reasons for this variation are not clear, the marked differences in salt content of very similar products suggest that technical reasons are not a primary explanation. In the right regulatory environment, it is likely that fast food companies could substantially reduce the salt in their products, translating to large gains for population health.

[My paper] Lyndal Wellard , Colleen Glasson , Kathy Chapman , Caroline Miller Cancer Council, New South Wales. lyndalw@nswcc.org.au ISSUE ADDRESSED Nutrition information at the point-of-sale assists consumers to make informed fast food choices. This study provides a baseline measure of the availability and accessibility of nutrition information in fast food outlets in Australia, filling a gap in the literature. METHODS An in-store observational survey was conducted in 222 outlets of five fast food chains in five states. The Australian websites for each chain were surveyed for nutrition information. RESULTS At least some nutrition information was available in 66% of outlets. The availability of information was higher in lower socioeconomic areas. Significantly less information was available in signatory chains of the self-regulatory marketing code. Information provided was generally incomplete; only one outlet (0.5%) provided information for all food and beverage items. In some instances information was old. Information was more available for &apos;healthier&apos; products and less available for meal combinations. Information was provided on all chains&apos; websites, however it was sometimes difficult to locate. CONCLUSIONS While most outlets surveyed made some nutrition information available to consumers, it was generally incomplete. Fast food chains should provide comprehensive, up-to-date information for all menu items. Chains should also ensure their staff members are adequately trained in providing nutrition information.

[My paper] B Wansink , M Shimizu , G Camps Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA. FoodandBrandLab@Cornell.edu BACKGROUND Fast food patronage is a frequent reality for many children and their parents. Although there are increasingly healthier alternatives for popular menu items (apple slices instead of French fries), they are infrequently selected. OBJECTIVES We investigated whether either of two priming tactics - the priming of a role model&apos;s food choices or the priming of healthy foods - could influence children to make healthier fast food choices. METHODS In the priming model condition, 22 children (ranging in age from 6 to 12 years) were presented with 12 photos of 6 admirable and 6 less admirable models and asked,&apos;Would this person order apple fries or French fries?&apos; In the health prime condition, the same children were shown 12 photos of 6 healthy foods and 6 less healthy foods and asked to indicate if each food was healthy or unhealthy. RESULTS When children were asked what various admirable people - such as Batman or Spiderman - would eat, 45% chose apple slices over French fries, which was higher than the health prime (P&lt;0.001) or the control condition (P&lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS Advising a parent to ask their child &apos;What would Batman (or another admired character or person) eat?&apos; might be an easy step to take in what could be a healthier fast food world.

[My paper] Janet Schwartz , Jason Riis , Brian Elbel , Dan Ariely Tulane University&apos;s Freeman School of Business, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA. janet.schwartz@tulane.edu Policies that mandate calorie labeling in fast-food and chain restaurants have had little or no observable impact on calorie consumption to date. In three field experiments, we tested an alternative approach: activating consumers&apos; self-control by having servers ask customers if they wanted to downsize portions of three starchy side dishes at a Chinese fast-food restaurant. We consistently found that 14-33 percent of customers accepted the downsizing offer, and they did so whether or not they were given a nominal twenty-five-cent discount. Overall, those who accepted smaller portions did not compensate by ordering more calories in their entrées, and the total calories served to them were, on average, reduced by more than 200. We also found that accepting the downsizing offer did not change the amount of uneaten food left at the end of the meal, so the calorie savings during purchasing translated into calorie savings during consumption. Labeling the calorie content of food during one of the experiments had no measurable impact on ordering behavior. If anything, the downsizing offer was less effective in changing customers&apos; ordering patterns with the calorie labeling present. These findings highlight the potential importance of portion-control interventions that specifically activate consumers&apos; self-control.

[My paper] Jonas J Swartz , Danielle Braxton , Anthony J Viera Public Health Leadership Program, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7461, USA. jonas_swartz@med.unc.edu Nutrition labels are one strategy being used to combat the increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity in the United States. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 mandates that calorie labels be added to menu boards of chain restaurants with 20 or more locations. This systematic review includes seven studies published since the last review on the topic in 2008. Authors searched for peer-reviewed studies using PUBMED and Google Scholar. Included studies used an experimental or quasi-experimental design comparing a calorie-labeled menu with a no-calorie menu and were conducted in laboratories, college cafeterias, and fast food restaurants. Two of the included studies were judged to be of good quality, and five of were judged to be of fair quality. Observational studies conducted in cities after implementation of calorie labeling were imprecise in their measure of the isolated effects of calorie labels. Experimental studies conducted in laboratory settings were difficult to generalize to real world behavior. Only two of the seven studies reported a statistically significant reduction in calories purchased among consumers using calorie-labeled menus. The current evidence suggests that calorie labeling does not have the intended effect of decreasing calorie purchasing or consumption.

[My paper] Ashmita Chand , Helen Eyles , Cliona Ni Mhurchu Clinical Trials Research Unit, The University of Auckland, Private Bag 92019, Auckland Mail Centre, Auckland, New Zealand. The aim of this study was to assess the availability of healthier options and nutrition information at major New Zealand fast food chains. A cross-sectional survey was undertaken at 24 fast food stores (two from each of 12 major chains) using on-site visits, telephone calls, and website searches. Of available products, only 234/1126 (21%) were healthier options. Healthier options were generally cheaper and lower in energy, total fat, saturated fat, sugar, and sodium per serve than their regular counterparts. Regular options were commonly high in sugar or sodium per serve (mean sugar content of beverages=56 g (11 teaspoons) and sodium content of burgers and pasta=1095 mg and 1172 mg, respectively). Nutrition information was available at 11/12 (92%) restaurant chains (range=0% at Tank Juice to 99% at Domino&apos;s Pizza). However,&lt;1% of this information was available at the point-of-purchase. Therefore, there is huge potential for improving nutrition in the New Zealand fast food restaurant setting. Implications of these findings for policy and food industry include: consideration of mandatory menu labelling, increasing the percentage of healthier options available, and improving the nutrient content of regular options at New Zealand fast food restaurants. Curr Drug Abuse Rev. 2011 Sep 1;:  21999689  Is Fast Food Addictive? [My paper] Andrea K Garber , Robert H Lustig Division of Adolescent Medicine, University of California San Francisco, 3333 California St. Suite 245, San Francisco, CA. 94143, USA. garbera@peds.ucsf.edu. Studies of food addiction have focused on highly palatable foods. While fast food falls squarely into that category, it has several other attributes that may increase its salience. This review examines whether the nutrients present in fast food, the characteristics of fast food consumers or the presentation and packaging of fast food may encourage substance dependence, as defined by the American Psychiatric Association. The majority of fast food meals are accompanied by a soda, which increases the sugar content 10-fold. Sugar addiction, including tolerance and withdrawal, has been demonstrated in rodents but not humans. Caffeine is a &quot;model&quot; substance of dependence; coffee drinks are driving the recent increase in fast food sales. Limited evidence suggests that the high fat and salt content of fast food may increase addictive potential. Fast food restaurants cluster in poorer neighborhoods and obese adults eat more fast food than those who are normal weight. Obesity is characterized by resistance to insulin, leptin and other hormonal signals that would normally control appetite and limit reward. Neuroimaging studies in obese subjects provide evidence of altered reward and tolerance. Once obese, many individuals meet criteria for psychological dependence. Stress and dieting may sensitize an individual to reward. Finally, fast food advertisements, restaurants and menus all provide environmental cues that may trigger addictive overeating. While the concept of fast food addiction remains to be proven, these findings support the role of fast food as a potentially addictive substance that is most likely to create dependence in vulnerable populations.

[My paper] Sue Reeves , Yvonne Wake , Andrea Zick School of Human and Life Sciences, Roehampton University, London, UK. s.reeves@roehampton.ac.uk OBJECTIVE To investigate meals, price, nutritional content, and nutrition and portion size information available on children&apos;s menus in fast-food and table-service chain restaurants in London, since the United Kingdom does not currently require such information but may be initiating a voluntary guideline. METHODS Children&apos;s menus were assessed in 22 chain restaurants for portion size information, nutrition information, and price. The most healthful available meal was purchased and analyzed for nutritional content and portion size. RESULTS Nutrition and portion size information was not provided in 67% of the restaurants. Fast-food restaurants were significantly cheaper, had smaller portion sizes than table-service restaurants, and provided fewer portions of fruit, vegetables, iron, and vitamin C. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Not all restaurants provided nutrition or portion size information. Differences in portion size and nutritional content between fast-food and table-service restaurants were established, and both were below recommendations. In the future, nutrition labeling in restaurants in the United Kingdom may provide consumers with the nutrition and portion size information necessary to help make appropriate choices.

[My paper] Aparna Lhila Economics Department, Central Michigan University, 317 Sloan Hall, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859, United States. lhila1a@cmich.edu Rise in the availability of fast-food restaurants has been blamed, at least partly, for the increasing obesity in the U.S. The existing studies of obesity have focused primarily on children, adolescents, and adults, and this paper extends the literature by raising a little-studied question and using nationally representative data to answer it. It examines the relationship between the supply of fast-food restaurants and weight gain of pregnant women and their newborns. I study prenatal weight gain because excessive weight gain has been linked to postpartum overweight/obesity and I study both tails of the birthweight distribution because the origin of obesity may be traced to the prenatal period and both tail outcomes have been associated with obesity later in life. I merge the 1998 and 2004 Natality Detail Files with the Area Resource File, and County Business Patterns, which provide data on the number of fast-food restaurants in the metropolitan area where the mother resides. The empirical model includes an extensive list of MSA characteristics and MSA fixed effects to control for factors that may be correlated with both health outcomes and restaurants&apos; location decision. Results reveal that the fast-food and weight gain relationship is robust to the inclusion of these controls but these controls greatly mitigate the fast food-infant health relationship. Greater access to fast-food restaurants is positively related to mothers&apos; probability of excessive weight gain but it does not share a statistically significant relationship with birthweight. These relationships hold in all the socioeconomic and demographic subgroups studied. Obesity (Silver Spring). 2011 Oct ;19 (10):1971-8  21779085  Consumer estimation of recommended and actual calories at fast food restaurants. [My paper] Brian Elbel NYU School of Medicine, NYU Wagner School of Public Service, New York, New York, USA. brian.elbel@nyumc.org Recently, localities across the United States have passed laws requiring the mandatory labeling of calories in all chain restaurants, including fast food restaurants. This policy is set to be implemented at the federal level. Early studies have found these policies to be at best minimally effective in altering food choice at a population level. This paper uses receipt and survey data collected from consumers outside fast food restaurants in low-income communities in New York City (NYC)(which implemented labeling) and a comparison community (which did not) to examine two fundamental assumptions necessary (though not sufficient) for calorie labeling to be effective: that consumers know how many calories they should be eating throughout the course of a day and that currently customers improperly estimate the number of calories in their fast food order. Then, we examine whether mandatory menu labeling influences either of these assumptions. We find that approximately one-third of consumers properly estimate that the number of calories an adult should consume daily. Few (8% on average) believe adults should be eating over 2,500 calories daily, and approximately one-third believe adults should eat lesser than 1,500 calories daily. Mandatory labeling in NYC did not change these findings. However, labeling did increase the number of low-income consumers who correctly estimated (within 100 calories) the number of calories in their fast food meal, from 15% before labeling in NYC increasing to 24% after labeling. Overall knowledge remains low even with labeling. Additional public policies likely need to be considered to influence obesity on a large scale.
