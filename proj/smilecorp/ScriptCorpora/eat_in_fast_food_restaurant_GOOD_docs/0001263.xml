Wendy&apos;s Fast Food Restaurant
 Puerto Rico 
 Tweet On 09/4/11@ 11:30AM I order chicken nuggets (99cts) which bring five and told the the female serving me that the chicken nuggets were burnt and that I was requesting fresh chicken nuggets and not burnt chicken nuggets. The female employee became very upset and gave me a bad look and turn around and threw the same nuggets into the basket where they empty it after frying. I then requested to speak to the manager and I gave him my complaint of the female&apos;s negative attitude towards serving and satisfying the consumer request. He looked at me and said nothing. As I waited for fresh nuggets, I bend over the the counter and could see the manager and the female employee laughing as he told her not to pay attention to me. He then became aware that I was watching and changed his expression to a serious one and disappeared. When the female came back I told her that this would be the last time I would visit this Wendy&apos;s and she could tell he manager this, and she responded that it was not her problem and I should tell the manager myself. I decided to leave things as they were since it appears that there is no respect towards the consumers and the personnel at that Wendy&apos;s don&apos;t have an idea on how to cook the menu and treat the consumer. Since I was given burnt nuggets for a second time and I decided to take them, however, I did throw them into the trash. It seems they keep on using the oil over and over and over again, and do not change it in order to save money. In addition, the employee&apos;s have not been given the appropriate training on how to serve the customer, this of course, includes the manager. This Wendy&apos;s located at Isla Verde, Carolina, Puerto Rico needs to understand if the have no clients, there is no money coming into the the franshice. And most of all, the most important thing is to satisfy the customer so he/she comes back again. Comments Puerto Rico Fast Food Restaurants Share with others:
