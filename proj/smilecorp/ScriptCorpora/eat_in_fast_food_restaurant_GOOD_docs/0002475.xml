Your review should focus on specific aspects of the business you are reviewing. Do not simply state you liked or disliked the business - be specific.

The best reviews include not only whether you liked or disliked a business&apos; products or service, but also why.

DO NOT TYPE IN ALL CAPS!

Do not mention competing company names in your reviews. Focus on the company you are reviewing, and if you wish, leave a review about the other companies on their directory listings.

Do not comment on other reviews - respect their position and write your own, but do not argue with others.

Do not use profanity or post spiteful remarks.

Do not write a review that is less than 50 words in length. The goal of a review is to share your experiences with a particular company - very short reviews do not accomplish this.

Do not post phone numbers, email addresses or URLs.

Do not post inflammatory reviews - stop and put yourself in the shoes of the owner of the business you are posting about.

Do not post many reviews about one business. Doing this will cause all of your reviews to be deleted.

 6 of 13 people found this review helpful: Value: Service: Food: Ambiance: Wine List: Cute place, food not so cute. By Close by on 1/10/2009 We have eaten here a few times now. Live locally and two times were served fish that were NOT what they claimed them to be. When brought to the managers attention was talked down too. What we ate was good, just not what it was said to be. Probably won&apos;t give it another try

 4 of 5 people found this review helpful: Value: Service: Food: Ambiance: Wine List: Bar Menu By William on 12/17/2008 Went to McCurdy&apos;s for their new Bar Menu to check out what they had to offer. I was delighted to see that everything was reasonably priced and there was lots to choose from on the menu. I got the cheesteak and it&apos;s the best around hands down. I sat at the bar and it was Local&apos;s Night a Wednesday. They had $2 beers and a full bar. This place comes highly recommended so go check it out.

 6 of 6 people found this review helpful: Value: Service: Food: Ambiance: Came highly recommended By Al on 8/3/2008 We&apos;ve vacationed in Atlantic Beach for the past 14 years. Had one dinner when the restaurant was Lawrey&apos;s. Swore never return. This year McCurdy&apos;s came highly recommended. We never realized that the location was the same. What a great surprise! The food was excellent, but the service couldn&apos;t be beaten. Hat&apos;s off to the gentleman that came to my rescue. I had a slight problem and he took care of it right away. I believe the phrase is &apos;&apos;timing is everything&apos;&apos;. He introduced himself as the father of the owner. Thanks again. And we&apos;ll certainly return next year.

 3 of 3 people found this review helpful: Value: Service: Food: Ambiance: Wine List: A delightful surprise!! By Cwbconner on 7/22/2008 We actually LIVE at the Crystal Coast but had not visited this restaurant. Big Mistake!! The food was excellent, the variety was amazingly extensive, the interior was neat, CLEAN, well-maintained and spacious. The wait staff was very friendly and courteous, even those staff members who were not responsible for our table. We WILL return!

 4 of 4 people found this review helpful: Value: Service: Food: Ambiance: Highly recommended By ScottyZak on 7/22/2008 I&apos;ve enjoyed several restaurants in the area over the last several years and can say that this is one of my favorites.

I just had to write this after seeing some of the scathing reviews by a few miserable people.

The seafood I had was excellent. It wasn&apos;t cheap, but not exorbitant either.

The place has great atmosphere and our service was excellent.

Make this place a must stop for a great evening meal

 3 of 3 people found this review helpful: Value: Service: Food: Ambiance: One Visit Won&apos;t Be Enough By Debbie Thompson on 7/21/2008 I&apos;ve been coming to the Crystal Coast for more than 20 years, and have never found a better restaurant than McCurdy&apos;s. While there are several restaurants I like, I&apos;m a very frequent guest at McCurdy&apos;s. The varied menu makes it possible to have something different each night, and it&apos;s all delicious. I&apos;ve only had desert a few times (rarely save room for it), but when I have splurged it&apos;s been a real treat.

While I&apos;d return to McCurdy&apos;s again and again just for the food, my visits are made more enjoyable by the friendly welcoming owner, the great view over the bay, and the excellent service. The wait staff are friendly and efficent, and the owner is never too busy to stop by the table for a short visit.

I highly recommend McCurdy&apos;s to anyone visiting the Crystal Coast. If you haven&apos;t been there, you&apos;ve missed a wonderful dining experience.

 3 of 3 people found this review helpful: Value: Service: Food: Ambiance: Wine List: A MUST VISIT By an NCBeaches Guest on 7/17/2008 We love going to McCurdy&apos;s, the food is wonderful, and the service is excellent. As a previous restaurant owner, I can honestly say that the total experience at McCurdy&apos;s is one of the best I have ever seen. One should remain cognizant of the fact that McCurdy&apos;s is fine dining a not a fast food restaurant.

 2 of 13 people found this review helpful: Value: Service: Food: Ambiance: Wine List: McCurdy&apos;s Food Was Horrible By Guest on 7/11/2008 Our party of 9 visited McCurdys&apos; on July 8th and found the expereicne regrettable.

It started when we were seated in back corner where there sas no light. This not only made the menus difficult to read but also played into porbelems we had with the service and food.

Becasue of the darkness, our server could not recognize one dish when she tried to serve it. It eventually was placed in front of 3 different people in our party before landing in front of the correct one.

8 of our orders came out together but one did not. A simple shrimp scampi that did not arrive for over 10 minutes after all the other entrees. what makes this more frustrating is that several of the entrees had clearly been sitting under the heat lamp far too long before being served.

Sauce on a flounder was congealed, the oil had seperated from the cheese on top of the Shrimp with grits, shrimp parmasean had shells on the shrimp,etc.

Basically the food was inedible.

Final note, the manager while offering a minimal discount, still tried to argue with me as to whether the food had set under the heat lamp tool long and other issues with the food, until I began to list specifics and asked her to come look at herself.

Do not go to this restaurant.

 3 of 4 people found this review helpful: Value: Service: Food: Ambiance: McCurdy&apos;s is delicious By Guest on 7/2/2008 Our family ate at McCurdy&apos;s on our recent vacation. It was the best meal we had all week and the service was fantastic. They had some creative dishes which were a nice break from all the typical fried seafood we ate all week. My husband has been coming to the crystal coast for 25 years and he said it was the best food he&apos;s ever had there. I would recommend it and we&apos;ll come back next year.
Also, I left my purse there by accident and they were nice enough to mail it back to me!

 3 of 3 people found this review helpful: Value: Service: Food: Ambiance: Nice, fun dinner By Guest on 6/25/2008 We had dinner here recently and it was a very nice night out. It doesn&apos;t look like much from the road but the inside was very clean and neat. The view of the water was amazing. The place was very busy and there was a little wait but I consider that a good sign. Once seated the food was served in a timely fashion and was the perfect temp. The food was delicious. I had the jumbo lump crabmeat. My wife had the chicken. Both were great. For appetizer, we had the quesadilas and they were cooked perfectly. Didn&apos;t save room for dessert. Too bad because it sounds like they are good, too. I&apos;ve read the other reviews here and I have to say, I&apos;m not sure which restaurant some of these people went to. Our experience was nothing but positive. Thanks for a great dinner.

 5 of 5 people found this review helpful: Value: Service: Food: Ambiance: Wine List: Beautiful Sunsets on the Deck By Guest on 6/22/2008 Visiting the area for the first time and we heard about Local&apos;s Night on Wednesdays at McCurdy&apos;s. We got there about 7pm and it was packed. There was a 10 minute wait to get on the deck b/c we wanted to hear the live music and enjoy the sunset. We waited outside and hungout and we were seated within 5 minutes. The whole night was a blast with some great beer specials and not to mention the great beer list. We ordered off the bar menu and we had one of the best cheesesteaks and wings in a long time. I would firmly recommend checking this restaurant out while visiting Atlantic Beach. The owners were very pleasant and approachable and even recommended other restaurants to check out.

 5 of 5 people found this review helpful: Value: Service: Food: Ambiance: Wine List: New Family Favorite! By Rhonda Green on 5/26/2008 As a visitor to the crystal coast over the past 25 years, I am pleased to say that I have found my restaurant of choice. The view off the deck at McCurdy&apos;s is outstanding at sunset, and the atmosphere is bustling with a key west vibe. Quite honestly, I hesitated to patron this restaurant after reading reviews below and am pleased to report everything to the contrary. My family enjoyed all aspects of our dining experience. We were greeted by an excellent server, spoken to by a delightful young owner and were served fabulous seafood. The food was superb and arrived nice and hot. I enjoyed the tunabites and the seafood gumbo, while my hubby devoured a steak, all were fantastic. I would recommend McCurdy&apos;s to anyone visiting our beautiful coast.

 5 of 6 people found this review helpful: Value: Service: Food: Ambiance: Wine List: New Owners, Excellent Results By Guest on 5/18/2008 The new owners are really making an effort to be sure each customer feels special. The menu is wonderful- hard to save room for dessert but definitely worth it- melt in your mouth, home made, and delicious. The bar is great too- I try a different entree each time I come here, and I have never been disappointed- I can honestly say I have rarely felt the same welcoming atmosphere in any restaruant as I do here- You just feel like family-You should definitely give this place a try-

 10 of 26 people found this review helpful: Value: Service: Food: Ambiance: Terrible management, never been so insulted by the owner of a restaurant By Guest on 5/14/2008 I have never had service so horrible in my life. When we were first sat, there were not many people in the restaurant and it took the waitress around 7-8 minutes to even come and take our drink order. The place looked kind of run down for the prices they have on their menu. When she finally came, our party of 5 ordered drinks and appetizers. It took another 25 - 30 minutes before our drinks arrived. One member of our party asked for a mug for his beer, and it took about 10 minutes before she brought that out as well. The manager came to our table and asked how everything was going, and I expressed that it was taking a long time for us to receive drinks and food. He replied &apos;&apos;Well, we are backed up in the kitchen so you will have to wait&apos;&apos;. It was a total of 45 minutes before our appetizers arrived.
Once the waitress came to take our main order, the manager rudely interrupted us to talk to the waitress about a private party, instead of letting her finish taking our order.
We had been there over and hour and a half when our main course arrived. 4 of us ordered crab leg platters which were supposed to come with corn and coleslaw. None of our meals had coleslaw with it. The waitress brought us the coleslaw once I informed her it wasn&apos;t included in the order. As she was getting our slaw, we all noticed that our corn on the cob was ice cold! I told the waitress and she offered to take it to the kitchen to MICROWAVE it for us!! For a $35 entree, I do not want microwaved food!
The owner of the restaurant came out and apologized for the long wait, cold food, and rude manager, and said for our troubles, she would get us all a round of drinks and free dessert.
When we finished our dessert, we got our bill and were charged for all the &apos;&apos;free&apos;&apos; desserts except one. I asked the waitress to have the owner to come explain why we were being charged for something she said was free of charge.
The owner came out and said she only told us she would give us ONE free dessert (even though the service was terrible for all 5 of us). I told her obviously we misunderstood, because we all wouldn&apos;t have ordered dessert if we knew we were going to be charged for it. She replied &apos;&apos;You actually expect me to give you all free dessert? Thats like $50 bucks!&apos;&apos; I told her for the price of their meals, and the bad service we received, I did expect free dessert. The owner then rolled her eyes at me, said &apos;&apos;Whatever!!! I&apos;ll just take them off&apos;&apos; and grabbed our tickets off the table and stomped off to the kitchen. When she returned with our credit cards, the owner looked at me and said &apos;&apos;Let me ask you something, Do you always act like this when you go to a restaurant?!!?&apos;&apos; I have never been so insulted by a business owner in my life. I absolutely do not recommend this place. The service was terrible, food was cold, and the owner of the place was completely rude and unprofessional...don&apos;t waste your money on a dump like this!
Oh yeah, and after we left, 1 member of our party looked at her bill, and she was still charged for her dessert!

 Response: 

While we appreciate constructive criticism, this review is full of inaccuracies. We specifically remember this night and know this reviewer&apos;s statements about our food and service to be false. We stand by our food and our service and suggest giving it a try before taking the word of one disgruntled person.
 
 


 6 of 6 people found this review helpful: Value: Service: Food: Ambiance: Hidden Treasure - Worth the Trip By Guest on 3/18/2008 Superb Place with nice atmosphere, very clean with tasty food. Job well done by owners who daily show how hard they are trying to please each and every customer. My steak was delicious and the desserts are amazing. I&apos;m not a drinker, so can not comment at all about the wine list.

 6 of 6 people found this review helpful: Value: Service: Food: Ambiance: Wine List: Great Beer List By Marty on 3/18/2008 This place has the biggest and best beer selection on the Island. With over 70 different beers to choose from we had a hard time selecting some beers, but the waitress was able to lead us in the right direction. The bar is beautiful and the atmosphere is great. We also love the fact that the entire restaurant is smoke free. If you smoke you can just amble on out onto the deck and enjoy the view of Moonlight Bay.

We always try to get there on Wednesday Nights for their great drink specials. Get there early to get a seat at the bar or just hang out on the deck.

 4 of 12 people found this review helpful: Value: Service: Food: Ambiance: Wine List: Service was better, before By Jim on 8/17/2007 I wish I could be as positive as the previous reviews.

I&apos;d been to the same location when it was Lowery&apos;s and got much better service. The wait was 45 minutes at 7pm. Numerous tables were open but not enough staff to wait on them. The manager apologized three times before we got to the table. The table was a typical white plastic one which had not been &apos;&apos;bleached&apos;&apos; this season. (a little bleach and water goes a long way on making it all white.)

The view would have been great but we had to ask the waitress to have the table in front of us cleaned. No fun looking at a sunset for 10 minutes over half eaten food and soiled plates. We also had to ask for the waitress after our meal for the check.

While the kitchen staff may have remained the same, I miss the service of the previous owners.

The service was wonderful and the food great. My husband, who is hard to please, was very impressed. The pecan tart just melted in my mouth. Thank you for a great experience and a delicious dinner.
