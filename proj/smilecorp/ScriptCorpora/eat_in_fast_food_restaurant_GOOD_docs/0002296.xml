What are some jobs that hire people UNDER 18?
 Posted by

 Mar 30 
 
I have a friend who has a very nasty financial situation right now and needs a job. Her dad is out of work because of a DUI and her mom has a low-income job. She is 17 and wants to help support the family and herself or else they could lose their home. I really want to help her find a job but so many places only hire 18+.

I am asking for help to compile a list of places that hire minors. Obviously, if it’s a place exclusive to your city or state, please don’t list it; list places that are everywhere like McDonalds, etc. We are from SE Michigan if that helps at all.

Will pick best answer. Please help. Thanks in advance.

Sports refs,
if you know a sport chances are you can sign up to ref it.
not tons of money but it’s income.

Also check out the money section on bored.com
it’s things you can sell like old book ands get money for.

You are a good friend to try to help her and her family.

Some places will hire with a parents signed consent. You can ask about that, most restaurant type places. They may hire you just as a bus person or something like that.

She could babysit or walk dogs, or dog sit.

I de-tasseled corn at her age. I am in Indiana. I don’t know if they do that there.

Pray for her and her family as I will too.
