CONOVER, N.C. (AP) — Police in two western North Carolina towns have charged an 18-year-old in an ongoing probe of counterfeit cash in Catawba County.

The Hickory Daily Record reports ( http://bit.ly/wjLBev ) that Devin Andrew Yancey of Conover has been charged by police in his hometown and in nearby Newton.

Police in Conover have collected at least 25 counterfeit bills since January, while police in Hickory have found more than three dozen. Bogus cash has also been passed in Newton.

Conover police charged Yancey after questioning a customer who tried to pass a fake bill at a fast food restaurant. A separate incident led to Yancey being questioned by Newton police, who say they found bogus $20 bills in his backpack.

It couldn&apos;t be immediately determined if Yancey has a lawyer.
