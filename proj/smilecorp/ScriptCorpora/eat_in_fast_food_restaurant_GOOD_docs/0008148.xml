 Targeting Trouble Spots 

It&apos;s a common myth that you can target fat loss to a specific part of your body. Ultimately, it&apos;s up to your body to decide where its fat cells are going to shrink, and no cream or machine is capable of changing that.

The best way to shed the pounds from your trouble spots is through a regular schedule of cardiovascular exercise and strength training. The combination of the two will help raise your metabolism, so that you will lose weight even while you sleep.

If you&apos;ve been working out for a while and have seen no noticeable difference in your problem areas, try varying the intensity or difficulty of your workout. Sometimes all your body needs is a small change to leap over the workout plateau into a new level of weight loss. The best way to vary your routine is by trying a different type of exercise. For more ideas on jump-starting your routine, consult a personal trainer or fitness expert.

 Serving Up Summer Squash 

 This Daily Dish is part of a series on seasonal produce. 

Squash is one of those vegetables that is not used enough in summer cuisine. Not only is it immensely nutritious, it&apos;s also versatile, cheap, and at its peak during the summer months. Here&apos;s how to buy, store, and prepare summer squash.

 Buying: The potential health benefits of summer squash are numerous. They are rich sources of magnesium, vitamin C, beta-carotene, vitamin A, fiber, potassium, vitamin B6, niacin, folate, copper, and riboflavin. In the market, you&apos;ll find a variety of summer squash, including zucchini, sunburst, crookneck, pattypan, and yellow squash. When purchasing, select squash that are firm and heavy for their size, with bright and glossy skin. Avoid those with nicks, bruises, or soft spots.

 Storing: You can store squash tightly wrapped or in plastic bags in the refrigerator for up to one week. Those with thicker skin can be kept up to two weeks.

 Eating: The thin, edible skin of summer squash allow them to cook more quickly than winter squash. They can be prepared by steaming, baking, or sautÃ©ing. You can cut them in half, remove the seeds, and bake with a little olive oil and seasonings, or you can dice and add to soups, salads, and stews. Squash will add texture and flavor to any meal.

 Have a Berry Good Summer 

 This Daily Dish is part of a series on seasonal produce 

With summer officially in full swing, it&apos;s time to enjoy that sweetest fruit of allâ€”the berry. Whether you love strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, or blackberries, the months from May to September offer an abundant harvest of berry goodness. Here are a few tips on how to buy them, store them, and put them to good use.

 Buying: At the grocery store or farmers market, choose dry, plump, and brightly colored berries with no obvious rotten spots. Avoid containers with juice stainsâ€”this is a sign that the berries have either been battered or are overripe. Also be on the lookout for moldy spotsâ€”mold travels like wildfire through berries and is best avoided.

 Storing: After you&apos;ve brought home your berries, store them unwashed in the refrigerator in a covered container. Fresh berries don&apos;t last long and are best used within two days of purchase. Berries can also be stored in the freezer for up to four months. To freeze, spread the berries out on a cookie tray and freeze before consolidating into a smaller container.

 Eating: When you&apos;re ready to use your berries, they can be added to pies, sauces, compotes, and drinks, or you can enjoy them as is with a dollop of fat-free, sugar-free whipped cream. Whatever you choose to do, make sure to wash your berries before using, since they can often harbor bacteria.

Berries can be enjoyed starting in Phase 2 of The South Beach Dietâ„¢. Try to limit all berries to 3/4 cup per day.

 (Kimbo&apos;s note: this last recommendation conflicts with the menus in the book, which often suggest eating a full cup of berries at breakfast, sometimes with strawberries at dessert that same day. I have no solutions to suggest other than to do what works best for you.) 

---------------
 Melon Madness 

 This Daily Dish is part of a series on seasonal produce 

What would summertime be without a nice juicy melon? Unfortunately, because of their higher glycemic index, watermelons are more or less off-limits to South Beach Dietersâ„¢ except as an occasional treat. However, you can fulfill your melon craving with a tasty cantaloupe as long as you limit yourself to 1/4 melon or 1 cup of the chopped fruit starting in Phase 2. Here are a few tips for choosing, storing, and preparing melons.

 Buying: When choosing a whole melon, look for one without dents or bruises and with a uniform color and appearance. A ripe cantaloupe should have a noticeable netting and a distinctly sweet cantaloupe smell coming from the stem end. In addition, melons should feel solid when you shake themâ€”anything rattling or sloshing on the inside may indicate a melon that is over-the-hill. Cut melons should be brightly colored and juicyâ€”avoid dry or mealy melons.

 Storing: Underripe melons can be allowed to ripen at room temperature for a few days, or you can speed up the ripening process by placing the melon in a plastic bag. Ripe melons should be stored in the refrigerator and used within four to five days of purchase. Once they&apos;re cut, make sure to tightly wrap the leftover pieces and store them in your crisper drawer.

 Eating: Melons are best enjoyed alone or as part of a fruit salad. To prepare, first wash the melon (the skin can harbor harmful bacteria) and slice in half with a sharp knife. You can then scoop out the seeds and cut the melon with a knife or a melon baller. Don&apos;t remove the seeds until you intend to use the melon, since the seeds protect the fruit from drying out.

 Non-Traditional Breakfast Alternatives 

If you don&apos;t like eating eggs in the morning, why not try some non-traditional breakfast foods? The key element to a successful breakfast is protein, say South Beach Dietâ„¢ nutritionists, who recommend anything from smoked fish salad to the ricotta crÃ¨me dessert in the morning. Here are more egg-less breakfast alternatives for Phase 1:

Cottage cheese with 1/2 cup chopped cucumbers and tomatoes
Turkey slices and 1/2 cup red and green pepper slices
Low fat cheese slices on 1/2 cup chopped spinach, microwaved with trans-free butter-flavored spray

--------------
 Brunch on the Beach 

Not only is this Phase 1 recipe quick and easy to prepare, it&apos;s also an interesting breakfast alternative.

Salmon Brunch Bouquets
Serves 3

Ingredients:
6 ounces smoked salmon
1/4 cup light cream cheese
1/2 medium seedless cucumber, sliced thinly lengthwise
6 strips of roasted red pepper
6 red leaf lettuce leaves, washed and blotted dry

Instructions:
Place cream cheese in a small bowl. Microwave for 15 to 20 seconds until softened. Lay out lettuce leaves and place strips of salmon on top. Spread softened cream cheese on the salmon, followed by strips of cucumber and one roasted red pepper in the center of each. Roll each lettuce leaf from one corner to form a short cone. Chill before serving.

---------------
 Midnight Snacks 

Are you a night owl who sometimes gets the midnight munchies? It&apos;s okay to add a late night snack to your meal plan, particularly during Phase 1 of the diet when you&apos;re still getting your hunger and cravings under control. Frequent snacking can help stabilize your sugar and insulin levels, according to Dr. Agatston. Here are some tasty late-night snack ideas:

Celery sticks with hummus or peanut butter
Left-over meat from supper
Raw veggies
Nuts like almonds, peanuts, or pistachios
Cottage cheese with salsa or chopped cucumber

----------------
 The Egg Pecking Order 

What&apos;s the difference between brown and white eggs? Why are some egg yolks darker than others? These differences in color have nothing to do with quality or nutritional valueâ€”they&apos;re simply a factor of the type of hen and what it is fed.

The color of the eggshell depends on the breed of the hen. Some hens lay white eggs and others lay brown ones. There is no difference in nutritional value or taste. The price of brown eggs tends to be higher only because the hens that lay these eggs are larger and require more food.

The color of the egg yolk can vary depending on the type of feed given to the hen. While hens given wheat-based feed tend to produce eggs with lighter yellow yolks, those given corn-based feed tend to produce eggs with darker yellow yolks.

Whatever the color, shape, or size of the yolk, the quality and the flavor remain the same.

-------------
 Egg Substitutes Explained 

You may have noticed that eggs are an important and widely used part of The South Beach Dietâ„¢. Though there is currently no concrete medical reason why the average person should limit their weekly intake of eggs, people who are either vegetarian, have egg allergies, or who have been advised by their physician to cut back on cholesterol intake, can turn to egg substitutes as an alternative to shell eggs.

Egg substitutes come in many different formsâ€”from frozen to liquid to powdered. Some eliminate cholesterol by using a combination of egg whites (cholesterol is found in the yolk), vegetable oil, and food coloring. These products are great for making scrambled eggs, omelets, and for use in baking. In addition, they retain the high-quality protein found in shell eggs. For vegetarians and those with allergies, there are substitutes made without any egg at all. Some of these products are meant for scrambling and others for baking, but none can supply the same nutrients as shell eggs.

Whichever type of egg substitute you choose to use, keep in mind that 1/4 cup of liquid egg substitute is equal to one large egg. If the egg substitute comes in powder form, check the directions on the package for conversion information.

 Water Is Water...Or Is It? 

Did you know that bottled water is sometimes nothing more than purified tap water? Have you ever wondered if your so-called &quot;spring water&quot; really came from that mountain or glacier pictured on the bottle? Despite the fact that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has strict labeling rules for bottled water, it&apos;s up to you to learn the differences between bottled waters andâ€”to familiarize yourself with the tricks of the trade.

There are three major types of bottled water:

1. Purified water/drinking water is tap water that has been treated to improve safety, taste, and quality.

2. Spring water is water that flows naturally from the earth and is collected directly at the source.

3. Mineral water is spring water that contains dissolved solids (minerals in no more than 250 parts per million) that come directly from the source.


Though the FDA states that drinking water can never be labeled spring waterâ€”and spring water can never be labeled mineral waterâ€”manufacturers can use misleading images on their packaging as long as they don&apos;t claim in writing that the water came from the location in the picture. This means your water probably didn&apos;t come from that mountain or glacier. Keep that in mind the next time you choose your bottle of water based on the pretty picture.

 Pump Some Iron 

Are you getting enough iron? Research shows that approximately 20 percent of women, 50 percent of pregnant women, and 3 percent of men don&apos;t get the iron their bodies require. Left unchecked, iron deficiency can lead to anemiaâ€”a condition in which red blood cells don&apos;t provide adequate oxygen to body tissues. Symptoms of anemia can include fatigue, pale skin, and brittle nails. The recommended daily allowances of iron are as follows:

Women (ages 19 to 50): 18 mg/day
Women (ages 51 or older): 8 mg/day
Pregnant women: 27 mg/day
Nursing mothers: 9 mg/day
Men (all ages): 8 mg/day

You can get your RDA of iron from a multivitamin, but caffeine and dairy products can interfere with the absorption of iron from a supplement. A more natural and effective approach is to eat a variety of iron-rich foods, like the ones in the list below:

Avocado
Broccoli
Clams
Kidney, pinto, and navy beans
Lean beef
Lentils
Lima beans
Oysters
Pork loin
Sardines
Shrimp
Spinach
Split green peas
Tuna

 Food Processing 101 

The food processor can be a very useful tool to help quickly prepare your favorite South Beach Dietâ„¢ meals. With the help of an assortment of blades and attachments, the food processor chops, slices, blends, grinds, purÃ©es, and mixes. The machine comes in three basic sizes: full, compact, and mini. Standard attachments include an all-purpose s-blade, a shredding blade, a slicing blade, and a dough blade (for bread and pastry).

You can use the shredding blade for cheese, carrots, cabbage, etc. The slicing blade will make perfect slices of your favorite vegetables, and the s-blade will chop nuts, fruits, and whatever else your heart desires. The pulse button is one of the most important aspects of the food processor. Pulsing allows you to pay close attention to the texture of the food so that you wind up with the desired consistency. Pulsing also results in a more even chop, since the food has time to drip back down to the bottom before the next pulse.

One last thing to keep in mind when using your food processor: Make sure to chop/combine the dry ingredients before moving on to the wet ingredients. This way you won&apos;t have to clean and dry the processor bowl in between jobs.

 In the News: Change in Medicare Policy 

On July 15th, the United States Department of Health and Human Services announced an important change in Medicare policy. As part of an effort to address the growing health threat caused by obesity, Medicare will be eliminating a statement from its manual, which claims that obesity is not a disease.

This simple change in wording may eventually allow Medicare recipients to seek benefits for obesity treatments such as gastric-bypass surgery and nutritional counseling. These treatments will be covered only if they can be proven to be medically effective. Since this will take time to establish, you shouldn&apos;t expect to see increased coverage anytime in the near future.

While this policy change is good news for the 41 million senior and disabled Americans on Medicare, it still doesn&apos;t address everyone else&apos;s obesity woes. But as obesity continues its climb to being the number one health threat to adult Americans, it is likely that private health insurance companies will also begin to reevaluate their own obesity coverage.

 In the News: Lose Weight Naturally 

It&apos;s not how much you lose but how you lose it. So say the results of a recent study, which found that even though liposuction may drastically reduce fat deposits, the procedure has no effect on the incidence of heart disease and diabetes.

The study, published in the June 17 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, followed 15 obese women as they underwent liposuction to reduce body fat. Doctors removed an average of 22 pounds per person and then tested common disease risk factors following the surgery. The removal of fat had no influence on insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, or cholesterol levels.

Why does losing fat through diet and exercise appear to be more beneficial than removing fat by liposuction? Scientists believe that when you lose weight through natural means, you shrink the size of your remaining fat cells. With liposuction there is no resulting shrinkage of fat cells, which means that these large fat cells will continue to place a strain on your blood pressure and metabolism. In addition, natural weight loss helps to reduce deep-tissue deposits of fatâ€”something that liposuction cannot do.

Liposuction is, and remains, a purely cosmetic procedure and not an overall health improvement. To achieve the benefits of The South Beach Dietâ„¢, you need to adjust your diet and exercise regimen to ultimately improve your health from the inside out.

If you are considering liposuction or any other type of cosmetic surgery, consult a physician. He or she will be able to give you more information about the associated risks and benefits.

------------
 In the News: Vitamin C and Your Joints 

A recent study published in the Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases suggests that a diet high in vitamin C may help protect against rheumatoid arthritis.

The study, performed at the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom, focused on the development of inflammatory polyarthritis, a type of rheumatoid arthritis involving more than one joint. Scientists found that participants who consumed the most vitamin C from fruit and vegetable sources were three times less likely to develop inflammatory polyarthritis than those who consumed the least vitamin C.

What does this mean for the South Beach dieter? It&apos;s simply another reason to eat a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables. The best natural sources of vitamin C are tomatoes (Phase 1); green vegetables including peppers, broccoli, and spinach (Phase 1); citrus fruits like oranges and grapefruit (Phase 2); cantaloupe (Phase 2); and sweet potatoes (Phase 2). So be sure to enjoy whichever of these foods you prefer most to get your regular dose of C!


 Kimbo&apos;s note: cauliflower is a surprising, and oft overlooked, good source of vitamin C. 1 cup of raw cauliflower provides 100% of the vitamin C daily value. So there&apos;s another reason to enjoy those mock mashed &quot;potatoes&quot;! 

---------------
 Buying Fresh Vegetables 

 This Daily Dish is part of a series on kitchen basics. 

Purchasing the freshest vegetables can be a tricky endeavorâ€”one that can make an unseasoned shopper shy away from the produce section of the supermarket. Instead of resorting to frozen veggies, learn how to shop like a pro with the following South Beach Dietâ„¢ tips.

Looks are everything. You should only purchase vegetables that are rich in color and firm to the touch. Avoid anything that is bruised, damaged, soft, or moldy.

Bigger is not always better. A small vegetable may actually be tastier and more tender than a large one. This is commonly true for tomatoes.

Take advantage of sales. Not only will you save money, chances are good that the cheaper vegetables are those that are in season and abundant. Do keep in mind that some supermarkets mark down old vegetables in order to get rid of them.

Resist the urge to splurge. It&apos;s easy to go overboard when buying vegetables, so make sure you have a use for each veggie before you get it. If you buy everything that looks good, you may end up wasting a whole lot of perfectly good food.

Keep &apos;em cold. Always refrigerate cut or perishable vegetables as soon as you get home. If you&apos;re buying vegetables that have been cut in the store, make sure they have been kept on ice or refrigerated at the supermarket.

Wash before you cut. You should wash all vegetables before cutting themâ€”even the slightest amount of surface bacteria can contaminate your knife and get into your food.

------------
 Ripe and Ready 

Tired of waiting for green bananas to turn yellow? Wondering if there&apos;s a way to make your tomatoes and avocados ripen faster? Here&apos;s a simple trick to speed up the ripening process when you don&apos;t feel like letting nature do the work.

Unripe fruit can take up to four or five days to come to peak ripeness while sitting on your kitchen counter. To accelerate this process, place the unripe item in a brown paper bag with a ripe apple, tomato, or banana for a day or two. What exactly does this do? Some fruitsâ€”including apples, bananas, peaches, pears, plums, tomatoes, and avocadosâ€”produce a substance called ethylene gas as they ripen. Ethylene gas acts as the trigger that starts maturationâ€”without it, ripening would not occur.

Because of this, ethylene gas has become an important part of produce distribution. Many fruits sold in our grocery stores come from South American and Central American countries where they are picked before they have a chance to mature. This allows them to be transported without spoiling. Once they reach the distribution center in the United States, they&apos;re placed in a room filled with ethylene gas to start the ripening process. The produce is then sent to supermarkets so consumers can buy it at the peak of ripeness.

When you place an unripe piece of fruit in a bag with a ripe one, you are taking advantage of the ethylene gas emanating from the ripe fruit. The proximity of the ripe fruit to the unripe fruit stimulates the production of ethylene gas in the unripe fruit and allows it to mature quickly. One warningâ€”pay close attention to the fruit when it&apos;s in the bag. If the ripe fruit starts to spoil, it could contaminate the other piece of fruit.

 Beware of Imitators! 

If you&apos;ve run across a meal replacement bar known as &quot;South Beach Solutions,&quot; then you should know that these bars are not endorsed or manufactured by The South Beach Dietâ„¢.

It&apos;s easy to be confused, since South Beach Solutions bars have the same name as the dietâ€”but rest assured that they are not SBD-approved. The name similarity is merely an unfortunate coincidence.

There are currently no bars that are approved as meal replacements on The South Beach Dietâ„¢. Instead, Dr. Agatston promotes consumption of fresh, whole foods. However, he is currently working with manufacturers to develop an appropriate alternative. Stay tuned to The South Beach Dietâ„¢ Online for further updates.

-----------------
 Weekly Weigh-Ins 

It&apos;s tempting to step on the scale every day when you&apos;re trying to lose weight. But daily weigh-ins can lead to disappointment and confusion, particularly during Phase 1 of the South Beach Dietâ„¢ when changes in water weight can cause day-to-day ups and downs. Better to weigh yourself once a week, says Dr. Agatston. And try to rely on another, more accurate measure of success: Pay attention to how loose your clothes are becoming.

------------
 The Start of The South Beach Diet 

It may surprise some of you to learn that The South Beach Dietâ„¢ is not named after a beach in Florida. The diet gets its name from Dr. Agatston&apos;s South Beach cardiology clinicâ€”the place where the diet was first conceived and implemented.

Dr. Agatston is first and foremost a renowned cardiologist. In the mid-&apos;90s,after deciding that low-fat diets weren&apos;t doing the trick, he developed a diet to help his patients prevent or reverse the negative health effects of obesity. Not only was it successful in improving the heart health of his older patients, but many young people also found they could lose weight on the diet.

Before he knew it, the diet was a sensation in southern Florida. Realizing that his diet could benefit many more people throughout the world, he set out to write a book outlining the lifestyle. When it came time to choose a name, it seemed only right to name it after the medical practice where it was born.

-------------
 The Snapper Conspiracy? 

Before you shell out the cash for fresh red snapper at the fish market, you should know that you might not be getting what you paid for. A recent study published in the journal Nature shows that the majority of red snapper currently available on the market is, in fact, not red snapper at all.

If it&apos;s not red snapper, then what is it? Three-quarters of the samples tested in the study were shown to be vermilion or lane snapperâ€”two types of fish that are both similar to red snapper, yet not as rare. How is this deception possible? Scientists suspect that fisherman may be trying to cash in on the high price of rare red snapper by substituting it with the similar and more abundant vermilion and lane varieties.

What can you do to avoid being duped? Aside from boycotting red snapper, there&apos;s not much you can do. Markets will continue to carry this overpriced &quot;red snapper&quot; until the government finds a successful way to regulate its sale. If you don&apos;t want to support this false marketing, then start buying a less expensive fresh fish. If you can afford the expense, then lane and vermilion snapper are just as good for you as red snapperâ€”even if they&apos;re not as rare.

 How to Make a Vinaigrette 

 This Daily Dish is part of a series on kitchen basics. 

A basic vinaigrette can be tossed with salad or used as a marinade for fish, chicken, or vegetables. Once you&apos;ve mastered its creation, you can express your own creativity by changing the flavor with a variety of ingredients. Here is the recipe for The South Beach Dietâ„¢ balsamic vinaigrette, along with some ideas for variations.

Balsamic Vinaigrette
1 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/3 cup balsamic vinegar
2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon white pepper
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil

Combine the olive oil, vinegar, thyme, salt, pepper, and basil in a screw-top jar. Cover and shake.

Enjoy two tablespoons of salad dressing with a meal.

Variations: The basic ratio for any vinaigrette is one part vinegar to three or four parts oil. Instead of balsamic vinegar, you can use any other type of vinegar (red wine, cider, etc.), or try lemon juice. Shallots and fresh herbs make nice additions, as does mustard. To ensure proper mixing of the ingredients, either shake well or mix with a wire whisk.

 Top 20 Antioxidant-Rich Foods 

Trying to maximize your intake of disease-fighting antioxidants? According to a new list published by scientists at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the following 20 foods contain the highest antioxidant concentration.

From highest to lowest:

1. Small red beans (dried)
2. Wild blueberries
3. Red kidney beans
4. Pinto beans
5. Blueberries (cultivated)
6. Cranberries
7. Artichokes (cooked)
8. Blackberries
9. Prunes
10. Raspberries
11. Strawberries
12. Red Delicious apples
13. Granny Smith apples
14. Pecans
15. Sweet cherries
16. Black plums
17. Russet potatoes (cooked)
18. Black beans (dried)
19. Plums
20. Gala apples

Antioxidants are naturally occurring nutrients that help prevent heart disease, cancer, and aging. Little is known about how antioxidants work and what affects their ability to function properly. Scientists believe that some antioxidants are more potent than others, and their potency can be affected by how they&apos;re cooked or how they&apos;re digested. For example, the antioxidants in blueberries lose their potency when cooked, while the antioxidants in tomatoes become more potent when cooked.

So even though this list is a good guide for finding antioxidant-rich foods, it&apos;s best to hedge your nutritional bets by eating a wide variety of items. (Note that all of the foods listed above are acceptable on The South Beach Dietâ„¢, except for the russet potatoes. The fruits would be introduced into your diet in Phase 2.)

 How to Zest 

 This Daily Dish is part of a series on kitchen basics. 

Many South Beach Dietâ„¢ recipes call for the zest of fruits like lemons or oranges. But if you&apos;re a cooking newbie, you may have no clue what zest is or how to get it. Here are the basics on zest and its uses.

Zest is the colorful, outermost rind of citrus fruits like lemons and oranges. It contains strong perfumes and a tangy flavor, and is, therefore, a common ingredient in both savory and sweet dishes. It also makes an elegant garnish.

You can remove the zest of a citrus fruit using a knife, a vegetable peeler, a grater, or a special tool called a zester. Each one of these tools creates a different size zest, which can be used for different purposes. A zester is a hand-held utensil with five tiny holes that can be used to create small strips of the flavorful zest. To use a zester, place it on the rind and firmly pull toward you. A grater can be used to create finer particles of zest, and a peeler can be used to create wider strips. In addition, you can use a handy new tool called a Microplane (a refashioned woodworking rasp) to create fine zest. The tool you use will depend on the recipe and what you have on hand in your kitchen.

A few things to keep in mind when zesting citrus fruit:

1. Avoid stripping off the white inner membrane (pith). The pith is bitter and fairly inedible. It will not make a good addition to a recipe.

2. Always remember to zest fruit before juicing it. It will be almost impossible to zest afterwards.

3. To get the best zest, buy fruit that is firm and brightly colored with no soft spots. Bumpy fruit will yield the most zest.

4. Wash the fruit before zesting to remove dirt, pesticides, and wax residue.

5. Use zest immediately, since it will lose its flavor over time.

 Changing &apos;Cheating&apos; to &apos;Treating&apos; 

It&apos;s all too common for dieters to obsess over their momentary lapsesâ€”their cheats. But worrying about cheating only encourages feelings of guilt and failure, two powerful negatives that can compromise weight loss efforts. Instead of thinking about these lapses as &quot;cheating,&quot; consider them &quot;treating.&quot; Enjoying a rare treat can make dieting less daunting.

The South Beach Dietâ„¢ is one of the few diets that allows for occasional treats. The unique three-phase structure lets you move easily from one stage to another. This means that if you overindulge one day, you can return to an earlier stage to get your cravings back under control. Try not to abuse this privilegeâ€”if you treat yourself too much, you&apos;ll have a harder time adapting to your new way of eating.

The fact is there will always be unavoidable temptations. Whether it&apos;s a summer barbecue, a birthday party, or a holiday celebration, you will have moments when you make a conscious choice to indulge. Go ahead and make that choice. As long as you don&apos;t overdo it, you&apos;ll still be able to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

 Choosing the Best Cold Cuts 

Presliced deli lunchmeats provide protein and make for handy on-the-go eating. Before you stop at the deli counter, check out this shopping guide to learn which meats are SBD-recommended and which ingredients you should avoid:

~Choose lean meats that are low in saturated fat. Turkey breast, boiled ham, and chicken breast are all great choices. A lean roast beef is also acceptable.

~Avoid processed meats with fillers. Fillers are carbohydrate additives that are used to hold the meat together and reduce production costs. Common fillers include cereal flours and starches derived from rice, bread, corn, and potato.

~Steer clear of meats with added sugar, like honey-baked ham or honey-roasted turkey. If your meat lacks flavor, add a little mustard or mayonnaise.

-------------
 Savoring Soybeans 

Soybeans wear two hats on The South Beach Dietâ„¢. They can be treated as protein or vegetable, allowing you to eat them either as a healthy snack or as an addition to a regular meal.

Soybeans are available either as young, fresh &quot;edamame&quot; or as dried &quot;soynuts.&quot; Both make a great protein snack between meals since they are low in fat and high in protein, fiber, and other nutrients.

You can find fresh edamame in Asian markets or frozen edamame in the freezer aisle of some specialty stores. Edamame can be eaten both as a snack and as a vegetable. You can enjoy cooked edamame topped with a little salt, or you can add them to salads or stir-fries. Soynuts can be found in health food stores and in most major grocery stores. They&apos;re best eaten as a snack.

The suggested serving size for soybeans is 1/3-1/2 cup for fresh and 1/4 cup for dried, whether you eat them as a snack or as part of a larger meal. As with other beans, soybeans can be a diet buster if eaten in large quantities.

 Five Guiltless Rewards 

You&apos;ve made it through the first week, the second week, and beyond. With each milestone you hit, you deserve a rewardâ€”to congratulate yourself on a job well done. Here are five great ways to pat yourself on the back without falling off the wagon:

1. Buy a new outfit to go with your new body. Or, if you really feel like celebrating, buy a whole new wardrobe.

2. Treat yourself to a day at the salon or spa. A pedicure or massage can really keep your spirits up.

3. Have a &quot;night out&quot; that doesn&apos;t revolve around dinner. Instead, cook a simple meal at home and then go out to the theater or movies.

4. Buy yourself some fresh-cut flowers to decorate your home or office. Having a thing of beauty nearby will help remind you of your own beauty.

5. Take a bubble bath. Enjoying some quiet &quot;me&quot; time will give you the energy to stay on track.

-----------
 Asparagus Aroma 

Have you ever noticed that your urine smells funny after eating asparagus? That&apos;s because asparagus contains a sulfur-based compound known as mercaptan. When broken down into its sulfur-containing parts during digestion, mercaptan can give your urine an unpleasant ammonia-like smell.

This strange asparagus-related odor is no cause for alarm. The smell is a harmless and temporary effect that usually dissipates within a few hours. If, on the other hand, your urine doesn&apos;t smell after eating asparagus, there&apos;s still no cause for alarm. It turns out that only about half the population develops smelly urine from eating asparagus.

There&apos;s increasing debate over why some people develop smelly urine and others don&apos;t. Most scientists agree the answer lies in your genetic makeup. However, while some scientists believe that half the population lacks the gene that produces smelly urine, others believe that half the population merely lacks the ability to smell the odor in the urine. In other words, either your urine doesn&apos;t smell at all, or your urine may smell and you just don&apos;t know it.

Whatever the case, don&apos;t let the smell turn you off from asparagus. In addition to being a quick-cooking vegetable, asparagus is also incredibly rich in nutrients such as folic acid, vitamin C, fiber, and a variety of antioxidants. Surely the benefits far outweigh this unpleasant side effect!

------------
 Is It Really Rotten? 

Mold is a sure sign that your food has gone or is about to go over the hill. But even though it may not look pretty, not all moldy foods must be discarded. Here&apos;s how to tell the difference between a moldy item that&apos;s destined for the garbage can and one that can still be salvaged.

The trick with mold is realizing that what you see is not always what you get. Even though the mold that&apos;s visible may be contained in a small area, it&apos;s possible that it has spread unseen into other parts of the food item. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, the following foods should be discarded at the first sign of mold, since the mold may have contaminated the entire product:

Soft cheese (cottage cheese and cream cheese)
Shredded cheeses
Yogurt and sour cream
Luncheon meats
Cooked leftover meats and poultry
Cooked pasta
Jams and jellies
Soft fruits and vegetables
Bread and baked goods
Peanut butter
Cheese made with mold (if it develops mold that&apos;s not part of the manufacturing process)

Solid foods like hard cheese, salami, and firm fruits and vegetables can be salvaged by cutting out at least 1 inch around and below the mold spot.

---------------
 Caffeine Caution? 

According to a new study in the journal Diabetes Care, people with type 2 diabetes may want to reduce or eliminate their caffeine consumption. The study found that caffeine may worsen diabetes by elevating blood glucose levels.

However, a study released earlier this year found that drinking four cups of coffee per day might actually reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 50 percent. Researchers suggest that though caffeine appears to have a negative effect on blood glucose, there may be another compound in coffee that reverses this effect.

What does all of this mean for the South Beach Dieter? If you suffer from type 2 diabetes, it would probably be a good idea to avoid caffeine from all sources including coffee. For all others, try to limit yourself to one or two caffeinated beverages per dayâ€”this small amount of caffeine shouldn&apos;t be enough to affect blood glucose. And if you&apos;re a coffee drinker, you may be able to reap some of the benefits of the mystery coffee compound.

 Getting Started: Seven Things To Remember 

If you&apos;re in Phase 1 or getting ready to begin, print out the following and hang it on your refrigerator next to the list of Foods to Avoid and Enjoy. When you feel like you&apos;ve gotten a little off track, or you&apos;ve forgotten the key elements and goals of the South Beach Dietâ„¢, take a quick glance to refresh your memory.

1. The South Beach Dietâ„¢ is not a low-carb or low-fat diet. The focus is on selecting the right carbs and fats.

2. The South Beach Dietâ„¢ does not require you to limit portion size, count calories, or count grams of carbohydrates. You can eat until your hunger is satisfied.

3. The South Beach Dietâ„¢ is flexible. You don&apos;t have to follow the meal plans to the letterâ€”feel free to swap meals and ingredients to suit your tastes and needs.

4. You can&apos;t lose in a day what it took years to put on. Permanent weight loss is a slow process. Eliminating the carbs that cause cravings makes weight loss easier.

5. The South Beach Dietâ„¢ allows for the inevitable slipupsâ€”that is why there are three phases. It&apos;s okay to fall off the wagon as long as you get right back on.

6. The South Beach Dietâ„¢ is a lifestyle change, not just another diet. Because it allows you to eat the way you actually like to eat, you can sustain it for the rest of your life.

7. Weight loss is only one of the benefits of the South Beach Dietâ„¢. It will also improve blood chemistryâ€”and lead to a healthier you. Last edited by Kimboroni on Thu Sep 09, 2004 7:38 am, edited 4 times in total. My FAQ -- food lists, portion guidelines, etc.

 Fast Food on the Beach 

Dr. Agatston has a busy cardiology practice, so he understands how difficult it can be to balance work, family, and daily obligations. Sometimes, preparing a meal from scratch in the kitchen just isn&apos;t an option.

Fortunately, The South Beach Dietâ„¢ was designed to be flexible. On your busiest days, eating takeout or hitting a fast-food restaurant isn&apos;t entirely out of the picture. Just avoid white sandwich bread and buns, sugar-filled condiments such as ketchup, and items such as French fries that are cooked in bad fats. To help you navigate the menus, we&apos;ve created a Fast Food Guide, which can be found in the &quot;Food Guide&quot; section under &quot;Meal Plan&quot; in the left navigation toolbar (Kimbo&apos;s note: this navigation info is for the paid site, not this free site) . You&apos;ll get information on what you can order at many major burger, sandwich, and chicken chains. Our team of dietitians has evaluated the menus at each of the restaurants, and they continue to keep an eye out for any new items that might be South Beach-friendly.

The updated list is posted here:

 In the News: Cholesterol Changes 

 This Daily Dish is part of a series for National Cholesterol Education Month 

On July 13, the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) recommended new cholesterol guidelines for people at high risk of heart attack or stroke. The shift comes in response to the reevaluation of research conducted over the last three years.

High-risk patients with more than a 20 percent chance of having a heart attack or stroke within the next 10 years are encouraged to lower their LDL (&quot;bad cholesterol&quot;) levels to no more than 100 parts per deciliter. That&apos;s down from the previously recommended level of 130 parts per deciliter. Those at severe high riskâ€”smokers, patients with poorly controlled high blood pressure, and people with low HDL levels (&quot;good cholesterol&quot;)â€”can aim to reduce LDL levels even further (to less than 70 parts per deciliter).

These changes signal a more aggressive effort to combat cardiovascular illness. They do not, however, change any recommendations for improved diet and increased exercise. Scientists and doctors agree that simply taking a pill cannot control LDL levels. Consult with your physician to determine your best course of action.

 Five Ways to Lower Your Cholesterol 

 This Daily Dish is part of a series for National Cholesterol Education Month 

Worried your cholesterol may be a little too high? High cholesterol is one of the major risk factors of heart disease and, therefore, should be taken seriously. Here are the best ways to lower your cholesterol:

1. Eliminate saturated fat from your diet. A diet high in saturated fat will cause your cholesterol levels to rise. By adopting a low-saturated fat lifestyle, like The South Beach Dietâ„¢, you&apos;ve taken your first step toward improving cholesterol levels.

2. Lose weight. Being overweight also causes an increase in cholesterol. By working to lose weight, you will not only lower &quot;bad cholesterol&quot; (LDL) levels, you&apos;ll also increase your &quot;good cholesterol&quot; (HDL).

3. Exercise regularly. A mere thirty minutes of daily exercise can help lower LDL levels and raise HDL levels. When combined with a healthy diet, exercise will also help you lose weight, which will in turn lower cholesterol levels even more.

4. Quit smoking. In addition to being a major risk factor for heart disease and cancer, cigarette smoking also contributes to high LDL levels.

5. Seek medical help. If none of the above tactics help to lower your cholesterol, or if you have a family history of heart disease, it may be necessary to seek medical help in the form of cholesterol-lowering drugs. Consult your family physician for the best course of action.

 Food Safety 101 

September is National Food Safety Education Month. To ensure the proper and safe preparation of foods, you must first understand the potential hazards. Here are a few common foods that require special attention when handling.

Raw meat: Meats such as chicken, pork, and beef can harbor dangerous bacteria, which can cause serious illness or even death. You can avoid this type of food poisoning by using a dedicated cutting board to prepare meat and by thoroughly washing all surfaces and utensils that have come in contact with the meat. In addition, make sure you thoroughly wash your hands before touching any other foods, utensils, or surfaces.

Eggs: Raw eggs have been associated with salmonella poisoning. To prevent illness, avoid eating raw eggs, keep your eggs refrigerated, and make sure you use your eggs immediately after cracking.

Fruits and vegetables: The surfaces of some fruits and veggies may be contaminated with pesticides and bacteria. Proper cleaning before use can prevent potential health risks. Thoroughly wash all fruits and vegetables before eating, and avoid contact with raw meats, seafood, and eggs.

Fish: To prevent possible illness, fish must be used soon after purchasing. Keep it refrigerated until you&apos;re ready to cook it, and never defrost frozen fish under hot water. Instead, submerge frozen fish in cold water for quick defrosting, or allow it to defrost overnight in the refrigerator. In addition, it&apos;s a good idea to wash fish before cooking and, as with meat, thoroughly clean surfaces and utensils after preparation.

---------------
 Getting Your Family Involved 

Are your kids at risk of becoming overweight? A recent study published in Pediatrics shows that 64 percent of children with obese parents are likely to become overweight.

Overweight and obese children are in danger of developing high blood pressure, diabetes, sleep apnea, and asthma. In addition, children who are overweight have a 70 percent chance of becoming obese adults, according to the study. It&apos;s up to parents to put an end to these statistics by encouraging healthy eating and regular exercise. But it&apos;s not enough to tell your kids what to doâ€”you also need to set a good example with your own lifestyle.

Here are a few ways to help your children maintain a healthy body weight:

1. Involve them in meal planning and preparation. Take your kids with you when grocery shopping, and encourage them to help out with the cooking. If you get them involved in the decision-making process, you can teach them how to make healthy choices when they&apos;re on their own.

2. Exercise together. By planning family activities such as hiking or biking, you can include the kids in your exercise routine while maintaining your own motivation to exercise. Make sure to have plenty of options so your kids feel like they have a say in the decision-making process.

3. Limit the amount of time you and your kids spend in front of the television or computer. This one may be harder to enforce if you&apos;re not always at home, but by setting a good example, you will show your kids that there are alternatives to just idly sitting around.

-------------
 Facts About Fish 

Confused about the benefits and risks of eating fish? Sometimes it can be difficult to keep all the recommendations straight when shopping for your evening meal. Here&apos;s a quick roundup of important findings about fish:

1. Eating fish may protect against stroke. A recent study published in the journal Stroke found that people who ate fish at least once a week were 13 percent less likely to suffer from a blockage of the blood supply to the brain (ischemic stroke). Scientists involved in the study believe that it may be possible to reap this benefit by eating fish a mere one to three times a month.

2. Fatty fish are the richest source of omega-3 fats. Omega-3s are critical for cardiovascular health and may also help protect against arthritis, diabetes, depression, and some cancers. Omega-3s are most concentrated in sardines, salmon, mackerel, and albacore tuna.

3. Pregnant women, nursing mothers, and women considering pregnancy should limit exposure to fish containing methylmercury. This industrial pollutant can impede the development of the nervous system in fetuses, babies, and young children. Since methylmercury tends to accumulate over time, it is most concentrated in larger fish with longer life spans (shark, swordfish, king mackerel).

4. Farmed salmon contain high levels of pesticides and other toxins. To avoid any negative effects of this contamination, make it a point to buy wild salmon instead of farmed salmon. Beginning in September, U.S. supermarkets will be required to put labels on salmon to identify the fish as either farmed or wild.

--------------
 Sweet Treat Guidelines 

On The South Beach Dietâ„¢, desserts aren&apos;t entirely off-limits, because that would be unrealistic! Dr. Agatston instead suggests you enjoy a favorite dessert as an occasional treat. The best approach is to eat healthily throughout the day and then to limit yourself to three bites of your treat. Savor each bite slowly, drink plenty of water, and you&apos;ll find that three bites are more than enough to satisfy you. You can also enjoy something sweet while keeping your blood sugar levels steady by eating sugar-free products. Here are some guidelines to follow:

Since artificial sweeteners are approved for The South Beach Dietâ„¢, you can enjoy a variety of tasty treats without the threat of causing cravings. Some subscriber favorites include sugar-free fudgsicles, sugar-free Popsicles, sugar-free gelatin, sugar-free sodas and drink mixes, sugar-free candies and chewing gum, and the ever-popular part-skim ricotta cheese mixed with flavored extracts and sugar substitute.

A word of caution: Some sugar-free foods contain sugar alcohols for sweetness and texture. These additives (recognized in the ingredient listing as words ending in &quot;ol&quot;) can often have an unpleasant laxative effect. Because of this, Dr. Agatston recommends limiting sweet treat intake to around 75 calories per day. (Kimbo&apos;s note: of course, that isn&apos;t the only reason for a limit! SB focuses on real, whole foods like veggies, lean meats, fresh fruits, whole grains, good oils, and nuts. Sweets aren&apos;t a food group ) 

-------------
 The Basics on Nut Butters 

Nut butters are any creamy spread made from crushed nuts, including peanut butter, almond butter, cashew butter, and macadamia nut butter. On The South Beach Dietâ„¢, natural nut butters are the best choice, but most nut butters can be used as long as they don&apos;t contain trans fat.

As with peanut butter, nut butters are a rich source of high-quality protein and monounsaturated fats. Also, like peanut butter, nut butters can be diet busters if eaten in too large quantities. When adding nut butter to your daily diet, you can choose to treat it as a protein (eating it with a meal) or as a nut (eating it as a snack). Try to limit yourself to one serving per day, and avoid eating whole nuts in the same day. Current recommendations allow for two tablespoons daily of any nut butter.

Nut butters other than peanut butter can be found in specialty grocery stores or in health food stores. You can also make your own by grinding up whole nuts in your food processor. Natural nut butters should be stored in the refrigerator to prevent spoilage. If the natural oils separate from the solids, simply stir them together before use.

--------------
 Could the Scale Lie? 

Don&apos;t be discouraged if your weight fluctuates day by day. Shifts in water weight, constipation, and even the food you just ate can cause the daily changes reflected on the scale. To avoid confusion and disappointment, weigh yourself only once a week. Let how much healthier you feel and how your clothes are fitting be your &quot;scale.&quot;

These daily weight changes are particularly common during Phase 1, when your body is adjusting to the new way of eating. You may also notice that you weigh more immediately after a meal. This is due to the actual weight of the food and not to any fat weight you&apos;ve gained. Remember that it takes time for your body to digest food, and it can take a couple of days for weight loss or weight gain to register on the scale.

---------------
 Save a Life, Donate Blood 

Winter is traditionally a difficult time for blood centers collecting donations. In an effort to encourage blood donation, January has been designated National Volunteer Blood Donor Month by America&apos;s Blood Centers and the American Red Cross.

Almost 38,000 units of blood are used in hospitals across the country on a daily basis. The majority of this blood is gathered from generous people willing to take an hour out of their schedules to help save lives.

Blood donations can be given at hospitals and blood drives across the country. You must be 17 and weigh at least 110 pounds in order to donate (though requirements may differ in some states). You can donate once every eight weeks, but you must be free of sexually transmitted diseases and meet other eligibility requirements. Every time you donate, you will be asked a series of questions used to screen out unusable donations.

After a volunteer donates blood, he or she will usually be offered crackers or juice. This is because your body loses some glucose and fluids when you donate blood. Although these food items are generally not recommended during Phase 1 of The South Beach Dietâ„¢, Dr. Agatston encourages blood donors to follow the advice of the medical professionals on staff at the donor center, regardless of their status on the diet. Before you go to donate, make sure you eat a good meal and drink plenty of fluids. Afterwards, juice is probably the best choice to replace the lost glucose, and one container should be enough. As for the fluid loss, make sure you drink plenty of water after donating, even once you&apos;ve left the donation center.

For more information or to locate a donation center in your area, visit the Web site of the American Association of Blood Banks, http://www.aabb.org/ .

------------
 Cravings or Hunger? 

The South Beach Dietâ„¢ encourages you to resist cravings but also to respond to hunger. Sometimes, it&apos;s not always easy to tell which is which. Here are guidelines for telling the difference:

Hunger is the feeling you get when you experience a normal and gradual drop in blood sugar about four or five hours after a meal. It&apos;s your body&apos;s way of telling you that you&apos;re past due for your next meal.

Cravings, on the other hand, happen within a couple of hours after your last meal. They are usually brought on as a result of reactive hypoglycemia, a process where your brain detects too-low blood sugar and your body starts to crave foods that will provide the fastest fixâ€”usually a high-GI carbohydrate. Reactive hypoglycemia is a vicious cycle. Once you eat a high-GI carb to curb your cravings, you&apos;ve set yourself up for another quick drop in blood sugarâ€”which will, in turn, make you crave more carbs.

It may not always be possible to tell whether you are experiencing cravings or legitimate hunger. That is why it&apos;s best to eat consistent, regular meals and to enjoy healthy snacks throughout the day. If you don&apos;t give your body the chance to be hungry, you won&apos;t be at risk of experiencing cravings.

---------------
 Phase 1 Time Limit 

It can be tempting to stay in Phase 1 until you&apos;ve reached your goal weight. Not only can you shed pounds quickly during the early part of this Phase, but it can also be scary to start opening yourself up to more food choices. However, Dr. Agatston has several good reasons for moving on to Phase 2.

Extending Phase 1 means you&apos;ll be missing out on a variety of whole-grain foods and fresh fruits that offer important nutritional benefits. In addition, Phase 1 wasn&apos;t designed to be a long-term eating plan. The meal options are limited and constrictive, so dieters are in danger of improvising to eliminate boredom. After a while, you may find old habits creeping back in, and before long, you&apos;re cheating more than eating healthy.

The three-phase approach of The South Beach Dietâ„¢ is central to its success. We strongly encourage you to follow the diet as recommended. Look at this journey as a lifestyle change. It&apos;s important to take things one step at a time â€” don&apos;t get caught up in the idea that this is a race to reach a particular goal. Remember, gradual weight loss will be more sustainable over the long term.

 Glaucoma Awareness Month 

Been to the eye doctor lately? Yearly eye exams are vital for the prevention and treatment of glaucoma â€” an avoidable eye disease that can gradually lead to irreversible vision loss. Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the United States.

Glaucoma can cause loss of sight without any warning or symptoms. The damage it inflicts on the optic nerve can be prevented with medicine or surgery if identified in its earlier stages. It&apos;s impossible to know if you have the disease unless you maintain yearly visits to the eye doctor. Since glaucoma can be hereditary, these checkups are especially important for people with a history of glaucoma in the family.

 New Government Guidelines for Diet and Exercise 
(from Thursday, January 13, 2005)

Yesterday, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) released new dietary guidelines that emphasize making smart choices from every food group and engaging in regular physical activity. The new recommendations encourage people to eat whole grains, fresh produce, lean sources of protein, and heart-healthy unsaturated fats â€” foods that are all an integral part of The South Beach Dietâ„¢.

The guidelines aim to address the concern that 2/3 of Americans are overweight or obese, and 50% don&apos;t get the recommended amount of activity, according to the HHS. It&apos;s part of the government&apos;s ongoing effort to fight the obesity epidemic and to increase healthful habits â€” which help reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, osteoporosis, diabetes, and cancer. Here are some of the recommendations:


 Select low-fat dairy and lean sources of protein, such as lean poultry and fish. Consume a variety of fruits, as well as more dark green vegetables (broccoli, kale); more orange vegetables (carrots, sweet potatoes, winter squash); and beans and peas. Make sure at least half the grains you eat are whole grains. Limit fat, salt, and sugar. If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation, which is defined as up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men. Be sure to exercise, and try to do so for at least 30 minutes a day, most days of the week. (60 minutes a day may be needed to maintain a healthy weight.) 

So how does The South Beach Dietâ„¢ fit in to the new guidelines? Secretary of Agriculture Ann M. Veneman said that The South Beach Dietâ„¢ â€” beginning with Phase 2 and particularly in Phase 3, the maintenance Phase â€” is &quot;very consistent with these guidelines.&quot; This is because The South Beach Dietâ„¢ encourages people to eat a balanced diet that emphasizes whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy, and lean protein sources, such as nuts, fish, and lean meats and poultry.

The new guidelines have been compiled into an easy-to-read brochure titled, &quot;Finding Your Way to a Healthier You.&quot; You can find a copy by visiting http://www.healthierus.gov/dietaryguidelines/ .

 Practicing Patience 

Some of our members haven&apos;t seen the Phase 1 weight loss they would have hoped for. Does this mean the diet&apos;s not working for them? Absolutely not. The South Beach Dietâ„¢ (SBD) is not a cookie-cutter dietâ€”everyone will respond differently.

There are many factors involved in how quickly you lose weight:

 What you eat. It can take some time to learn better eating habits and cut out cravings. Stick to the SBD principals, and eventually the weight will come off.

 How much weight you have to lose. People with fewer pounds to lose may experience a slower rate of weight loss.

 How long you spend on Phase 1. If you spend too much time on Phase 1, you may begin to lose lean muscle mass, which can stall weight loss. It&apos;s better to move on to Phase 2 after two weeks. If you experience weight gain, you can always go back to Phase 1.

 How your body works. Some people have a harder time losing weight than others. This could be due to a slow metabolism or a medical condition. Whatever the case, no two people will be exactly alike in their ability to lose weight.

If you have unreasonable expectations, you may set yourself up for failure. Be patient and persistentâ€”weight lost slowly and steadily tends to stay off over the long term. And remember that, in the process, you&apos;re improving your blood chemistry and learning to make healthier choices for life.

 Entertaining on the Beach 

Impress your guests with this elegant Phase 1 appetizer. They&apos;ll never guess it&apos;s diet-friendly!

Antipasto of Seared Tuna&amp;Roasted Peppers
Serves 2

Ingredients:
3 ounces tuna steak (about 1-inch thick)
Coarsely ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup roasted red peppers
1/2 teaspoon olive oil, preferably extra-virgin
1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1/2 ounce Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, at room temperature
1 1/2 teaspoons drained capers
Allowed vegetables
Caper berries, lemon wedges, and lettuce for garnish

Instructions:
Sprinkle both sides of tuna steak with pepper. Lightly oil a large nonstick skillet or coat it with nonstick cooking spray. Heat the skillet over high heat until a drop of water sizzles; add the tuna and cook until the underside is lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes, then turn and cook just until opaque in the center, 4 to 5 minutes longer. Remove from the skillet and cool to room temperature. (Tuna can be cooked up to 8 hours ahead. Cool to room temperature, wrap, and refrigerate.)

Shortly before serving, cut the tuna on the bias into 1/4-inch slices. Cut the red peppers into 1/4-inch slices. Arrange tuna and peppers on a serving plate. Sprinkle with pepper, then drizzle with the olive oil and lemon juice. With a vegetable peeler, shave the cheese into thin slices. Scatter the cheese and capers over the tuna and peppers. Serve with allowed vegetables. Garnish with caper berries, lemon wedges, and lettuce, if desired.

 Knowing When to Throw It Away 

How many times have you discovered year-old food hiding in the back of your freezer and wondered if it&apos;s OK to eat? When handled and frozen properly, frozen food is safe to eat. However, there definitely comes a time when the taste starts to suffer. When is it time to throw something away?

The Partnership for Food Safety Education has cutoffs for some of your favorite foods:

Hamburger meat, stew meat, and ground turkey (raw) = 3-4 months
Lunch meat = 1-2 months
Bacon (raw) = 1 month
Steak and roasts (raw) = 6-12 months
Pork chops and roasts (raw) = 4-6 months
Lamb chops and roasts (raw) = 6-9 months
Cooked meat = 2-3 months
Whole chicken (raw) = 1 year
Chicken pieces (raw) = 9 months
Cooked chicken = 4-6 months
Lean fish (raw) = 6 months
Fatty fish (raw) = 2-3 months

Note: Eggs (raw or cooked), mayonnaise, and stuffed meats do not freeze well.

When in doubt, don&apos;t taste food that looks or smells strangeâ€”just throw it out!

 How to Thaw Safely 

 This Daily Dish is part of a series on kitchen basics. 

Before you thaw those chicken breasts in a pot of hot water, keep in mind that you may be endangering your family&apos;s health. Improper thawing of food can cause bacterial contamination and lead to food poisoning. Here&apos;s how to safely thaw your foods.

The best way to thaw frozen foods is to place them in the refrigerator all day or overnight. On average, meat thaws in eight to nine hours per pound, and poultry thaws in three to four hours per pound. If you can&apos;t wait that long, the second-best thawing method is to place the food in a watertight container and submerge in cold water. This typically takes about one-eighth of the time to thaw in the refrigerator.

Still, even this may not be fast enough for you. If you&apos;re in a rush and want to thaw quickly, use the defrost setting on your microwave oven. Most ovens come with a manual with recommended thawing times for common foods. Consult this manual before thawing. To speed up the process even further, cut the food to be thawed into smaller pieces.

NEVER

Â· Thaw meat on the countertop
Â· Thaw food under hot water
Â· Refreeze thawed foods
Â· Keep thawed foods for more than one day

Improper thawing can lead to food-borne illness. While most foods can be stored for long periods of time in the freezer with no health consequences, once you take an item out of the freezer and warm it up to 40Â°F, any bacteria present before freezing will begin to multiply. By following proper thawing techniques, you&apos;ll go a long way toward protecting yourself and your family.

 Fabulous Fall Foods: Grapes 

If you&apos;re in Phase 2, you can now enjoy the seasonal delights of fresh grapes. Grapes are at their peak ripeness and abundance beginning now and lasting until the month of December. Here is everything you need to know about buying, storing, and eating grapes.

 Buying: Grapes do not ripen after they are picked, which means that what you see is what you get. To make sure you&apos;re getting the ripest, sweetest grapes, look for vines full of tender and plump fruit. You can also use a secret chef&apos;s trick to check for ripenessâ€”grab a bunch of grapes and shake. If the fruit clings to the stems, they&apos;re fresh; if they fall off, they&apos;re over the hill.

 Storing: Grapes should be stored in the refrigerator. If they&apos;re left out on the counter, they will begin to wither and ferment. You can keep grapes in the refrigerator for up to two weeks, as long as you make sure they stay on the stem and you avoid washing them until you&apos;re ready to eat them.

 Eating: Grapes are best eaten right off the stem. Fifteen grapes are considered a serving. Because of the pesticides commonly used in grape production, they should be washed thoroughly before eating.

-------------
 Fabulous Fall Foods: Pears 

Pears are at their peak from August to May. Though this apple relative is often underappreciated, it is a rich source of fiber and nutrients. Here are some tips for buying, storing, and eating pears.

 Buying: Most of the pears you find in the store are sold before they have ripened. This is because ripe pears do not last long and would probably not survive transport. When you purchase pears, look for fruit free of bruises or blemishes. Once you get them home, you can ripen them at room temperature. Ripe pears will yield to gentle pressure at the stem end.

 Storing: Pears should be kept at room temperature until ripe and then in the refrigerator for a couple of days. To speed up the ripening process, place them in a bowl or bag with a ripe apple.

 Eating: Pears can be eaten as is for a sweet and crunchy touch. They can also be poached for a sweet dessertâ€”try our Poached Pears recipe, available on The South Beach Dietâ„¢ Online. As with any other fruit, be sure to wash pears before eating.

--------------
 Fabulous Fall Foods: Cauliflower 

Cauliflower, the main ingredient in Surprise South Beach Mashed Potatoes (recipe to follow), is at its peak ripeness from September through November. A member of the cabbage family, cauliflower gets its distinct white color from lack of exposure to the sun. The green leaves shade the florets, preventing the formation of green chlorophyll. Here are a few tips for buying, storing, and eating cauliflower.

 Buying and Storing: Look for a head of cauliflower with bright green leaves enclosing firm, tightly packed florets that are a creamy white. Avoid plants with bruised, brown, or exposed florets. Cauliflower can be kept refrigerated in a ventilated plastic bag for up to two days.

 Eating: Chop the florets before using, and be sure to wash them well. Dirt can collect in the hard-to-reach places. Chopped cauliflower can turn brown when cookingâ€”to avoid this, add a teaspoon of lemon juice to the cooking water. Cauliflower can be boiled and used to make Surprise South Beach Mashed &quot;Potatoes,&quot; or it can be roasted in the oven with a little olive oil and seasoning. Cauliflower is a rich source of vitamin C and also offers folate (a vitamin important to the body&apos;s cells), fiber, and cancer-fighting antioxidants.

 Fabulous Fall Foods: Sweet Potatoes 

Sweet potatoes are a starchy vegetable rich in nutrients such as fiber, vitamin A, and vitamin C. They are at their peak abundance from September through December and are an acceptable addition to The South Beach Dietâ„¢ beginning in Phase 2. Here are a few tips for buying, storing, and eating sweet potatoes.

 Buying: Look for thick and solid potatoes with no bruises or signs of decay. Sweet potatoes typically taper at one end and are characterized by their dry, yellow flesh. They are originally from the West Indies but are now grown in many parts of the United States. Since sweet potatoes can vary in size, choose small ones when first reintroducing them to your diet.

 Storing: Sweet potatoes should be kept in a cool, dark, and dry place. Refrigeration is not a good idea, as the cold temperature can damage them. They should be used within two weeks of purchase.

 Eating: Before preparing, make sure to scrub your sweet potatoes thoroughly with a potato brush. They grow under the ground and, therefore, collect a lot of dirt. To cook, you can either boil them and mash them as you would regular potatoes, or you can roast or bake them in the oven. If you choose to bake them whole, make sure you pierce the skin several times with a fork to avoid an explosion.

 Sweet Potatoes on the Beach 

This simple Phase 2 recipe is the perfect way to celebrate the fall season.

Sweet Potatoes With Roasted Fennel and Tarragon
Serves 2

Description
Sweet potatoes, also often sold as &quot;yams,&quot; are a fantastic source of antioxidants, but traditional recipes that call for maple syrup and brown sugar can banish this favorite from your South Beach Dietâ„¢ menu. Instead, complement the natural flavor of the sweet potatoes with the delicacy of fennel and fresh tarragon.

Ingredients
2 sweet potatoes, scrubbed and peeled
1 fennel bulb
1 tablespoon fresh tarragon, finely chopped
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
Canola oil
salt and pepper

Instructions
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Chop fennel bulbs into small cubes and toss with canola oil, salt, and pepper. Roast fennel pieces on a rimmed cookie sheet for about 20 minutes or until fragrant and pieces start to show some color. Cut sweet potatoes in 2 or 3 pieces lengthwise, and then chop each spear into bite-sized pieces. Roast sweet potatoes for about 40-50 minutes or until fork-tender. Toss roasted sweet potatoes with roasted fennel, vinegar, and fresh tarragon.

 10 Breast Cancer Risk Factors 

 The following Daily Dish is part of a series for National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. 

According to the National Cancer Institute, breast cancer is the most common cancer in U.S. women other than skin cancerâ€”more than 200,000 American women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2003. The following is a list of the most common risk factors. Please note that some are not within your power to control.

 Age. Most women diagnosed with breast cancer are over the age of 50.

 History of breast cancer. A woman with cancer in one breast has an increased chance of developing cancer in the other breast.

 Family history of breast cancer. If a woman&apos;s mother, sister, or daughter had breast cancer (especially before the age of 40), her risk of developing breast cancer is increased.

 Menstrual history. Early onset of your menstrual period (before age 12) or late onset of menopause (after age 55) also increases your chance of developing breast cancer.

 Childbirth history. Women who have no children or who have their first child after age 30 are at greater risk of developing breast cancer.

 Obesity. Obesity after menopause is also a risk factor.

 Radiation exposure to chest. Women who developed Hodgkin&apos;s Lymphoma at an early age may have been exposed to radiation for treatment.

 Inactivity. Women who exercise regularly are less likely to develop cancer.

 Alcohol consumption. Some studies have shown that the more a woman drinks, the greater her chances of developing breast cancer.

 Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT). There is some evidence that taking HRT after menopause can increase your risk of developing breast cancer.

If you fear you may be at an increased risk of developing breast cancer, consult your physician for a proper course of action.

--------------
 Soy and Breast Cancer 

 The following Daily Dish is part of a series for National Breast Cancer Awareness Month 

Advice about soy foods and cancer is conflicting at best. While some scientists believe soy has important anti-cancer effects, others worry that the cancer-fighting compounds in soy may actually promote the development of cancer. What&apos;s the story with soy?

Soy products including tofu, soy milk, soybeans, soy nuts, miso, and tempeh contain plant estrogens known as isoflavones. These isoflavones are believed to compete with human estrogen to fit into estrogen receptor sites within the body. By taking the place of human estrogen, isoflavones are believed to slow cancerous cell growth.

However, some scientists worry that the estrogenlike effects of isoflavones may actually help encourage cancerous growth. The majority of the research nonetheless supports soy as a beneficial food instead of a harmful one. For example, quite a few studies have shown that regular consumption of soy before menopause can lower breast cancer risk. Results are not as promising for soy consumption after menopause.

Though the research remains inconclusive, at present it appears to be safe to consume soy on a regular basis, including as part of The South Beach Dietâ„¢. To maximize the benefit from its anti-cancer properties it would be best to start consuming soy earlier rather than later in life.

 Soup on the Beach 

Nothing beats a comforting bowl of soup when the weather starts to cool. You can enjoy this hearty recipe beginning in Phase 1.

White Bean Soup with Greens
Serves 6

Description:
This southern Italian soup features white beans. Choose from great Northern beans, cannellini beans, or any other white bean you happen to have on hand.

Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds Swiss chard, escarale, or beet greens, trimmed
6 cups chicken broth
1 clove garlic, crushed
1 cup cooked white beans
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground white pepper
Grated Parmesan cheese, for garnish
Red-pepper flakes, for garnish

Instructions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the greens and cook for 7 minutes, or until barely tender. Drain the greens, squeezing out as much water as possible. (This can be done several hours before cooking in the soup. It is not necessary to cut the greens, because they will break apart while they cook in the soup.)

Bring the broth to a simmer in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and greens. If using canned white beans, place them in a strainer and rinse them under cold running water to remove excess sodium. Add the beans to the broth. Simmer gently, partially covered, for 10 minutes. Sprinkle with the salt and pepper to taste. (Do not add the salt before the soup has finished cooking, or it may become too salty.)

Ladle the soup into heated bowls. Pass the cheese and pepper flakes at the table.

 Fitness and Heart Disease Risk 

A recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association shows that physical fitness may have a greater impact on heart health than being overweight or obese.

The study followed 906 at-risk women over a period of four years and found that women with low activity levels were more likely to develop heart problems regardless of their weight. Women who stayed at least moderately active had fewer incidences of heart attack, stroke, and other heart-disease-related problems. This research suggests increased physical activity may be an ideal recommendation for those who are at risk of developing coronary heart disease.

These findings provide yet another reason to add at least 30 minutes of exercise to your daily routine. Not only does exercise promote weight loss, build strength, and increase stamina, it may also prevent heart disease so you can live a longer, happier life.

 Tips for International Dieters 

If you live overseas and are having trouble locating some South Beach Dietâ„¢-recommended products, there&apos;s no need to worry. None of the foods suggested for the diet are mandatory. Here are a few ideas for simple solutions to your international dieting woes:

 Black Beans â€”Substitute with any other type of bean. The important nutrients to replace are protein and fiber.

 Laughing Cow Cheese and Mozzarella Cheese Sticks â€”Substitute with any reduced-fat local cheese. Or, if that&apos;s not available, choose regular cheese and cut your portion size in half. Or, replace cheese with nuts, beans, plain nonfat yogurt, or lean meats.

 Ricotta â€”If ricotta is not available for you to use in the ricotta crÃ¨me recipes, you can replace it with nonfat yogurt, blended tofu, or blenderized low-fat cottage cheese.

The key to international success is to do the best with what you can find. The South Beach Dietâ„¢ aims to teach you the basics of healthy eatingâ€”those principles can be applied no matter where you live.

 5 ways to Avoid Halloween Temptations 

Sometimes it seems as though Halloween is just an excuse to gorge on a whole lot of candy. If you&apos;re afraid you won&apos;t be able to resist temptation, you don&apos;t have to give in without a fight. Here are five strategies to survive the holiday without compromising your diet.

1. Provide healthy alternatives for you and your kids. Keep a ready supply of nuts, cheese sticks, and fresh fruit on hand throughout the day. By filling up on healthy snacks, you&apos;ll feel less of an urge to splurge on sweets.

2. Donate leftover candy to a children&apos;s shelter. If it stays in your house, someone&apos;s bound to eat it. Eliminate the danger by giving your leftover candy to someone who needs it more than you do.

3. Establish a &quot;no leftovers&quot; rule at the office. For all your careful preparation at home, it&apos;s sometimes hard to avoid leftover candy at work. Pack South Beach-friendly snacks the night before so you&apos;re prepared with alternative munchies.

4. Don&apos;t get taken in by clearance sales. After Halloween is over, stores will try to move as much Halloween merchandise as possible. By avoiding the candy aisle altogether, you won&apos;t be tempted to take advantage of the lower prices.

5. Allow yourself one splurge so you don&apos;t feel deprived. No one said you should have no candy at all during Halloween. It is, after all, a holiday that comes but once a year. Treat yourself to one or two small pieces of dark chocolate and move on with your diet.

 Grapefruit and Medications Alert 

Although grapefruit is generally healthy and nutritious, the fruit has been shown to interact negatively with a variety of medications for treating heart disease, depression, seizures, and HIV. What is it about grapefruit that may be so dangerous?

Unlike other fruits, grapefruit contains chemicals that interfere with your body&apos;s ability to break down certain drugs. This can lead to undesirably high concentrations of the drug within your bloodstream and an increased risk of developing serious side effects. While it&apos;s not known what specifically causes this interaction, scientists do know that the chemical culprits are present in all parts of the grapefruit. Negative effects can also be experienced after taking dietary supplements made with grapefruit extract.

If you are on medication for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, depression, HIV, or seizures, consult your physician about the dangers associated with eating grapefruit. You may be instructed to eliminate grapefruit from your diet. Last edited by Kimboroni on Wed Dec 08, 2004 8:23 am, edited 10 times in total. My FAQ -- food lists, portion guidelines, etc.

 TV Dinners: Good or Bad? 

If you don&apos;t have a lot of time to cook, you may find yourself shopping the frozen dinner aisle for quick nourishment. South Beach Dieters should try to avoid eating frozen dinners for two reasons: First, the only way you can know exactly what you&apos;re putting in your body is to get in the habit of eating fresh, whole foods you&apos;ve prepared yourself. And second, ready-made dinners often contain high-glycemic carbs, sugars, and ingredients like potatoes that are not South Beach Dietâ„¢-friendly. It&apos;s extremely difficult to find frozen dinners made with whole grains and low-GI side dishes that fit the South Beach Dietâ„¢ plan.

So, the next time you&apos;re at the grocery store, try to avoid the frozen dinner section. This does not mean that all frozen foods are off-limitsâ€”frozen vegetables and meats are fine and can be great choices for those with busy schedules. But if you can&apos;t resist the temptation of a ready-made meal, check the ingredients carefully to find the one with the best carbs and the lowest amount of saturated fat.

 Holidays for Diabetics 

 The following Daily Dish is part of a series for American Diabetes Month 

Planning holiday menus can be difficult for healthy families, let alone for families that include diabetics. But with Thanksgiving fast approaching and Christmas not too far behind, it&apos;s important to put some thought into your holiday celebrations before they catch you off guard.

The holidays don&apos;t have to be a time of deprivation for those with diabetes. There are many ways you can make your meals healthier. It&apos;s a good idea to speak with your doctor or dietitian before the holidays hit. In the meantime, here are two ways to make your holidays more diabetes-friendly:

1. Make your food healthier. While this may not sound appealing, it&apos;s the best way to avoid aggravating your diabetes. For example, cook with canola or olive oil instead of butter, use low-fat milk instead of cream, and fill up on vegetable dishes instead of baked goods. Cutting down on fat and sugar can make the holidays go smoother.

2. Get more exercise. The holidays are hectic, so you may think you just don&apos;t have time for exercise. But the good news is that exercise doesn&apos;t always mean going for a long jog or hitting the gym. Cleaning the house, using the stairs at work, or even walking around the mall while shopping for gifts can be enough to maintain your blood-sugar balance.

-------------
 How Eating Affects Your Blood Sugar 

 The following Daily Dish is part of a series for American Diabetes Month 

If you have diabetes, it&apos;s important that you understand exactly how eating can affect your blood-sugar levels. The symptoms of low blood sugar can occur quickly and include fatigue, weakness, and shakiness. On the other end of the spectrum, allowing your blood sugar to get slightly above normal can cause feelings of fatigue and thirst. Over time, elevated blood sugar levels can lead to long-term damage to the eyes, heart, kidneys, blood vessels, and nerves.

Certain foods cause rapid increases in blood-sugar levels, while others slow digestion and keep blood-sugar levels steadier. Which foods cause the fastest increases in blood sugar? Those that give up their sugars the easiest and are, therefore, highest on the glycemic index, including white bread, potatoes, rice, corn, and other refined carbohydrates. Foods that also assist with slowing the rate of digestion include those rich in fiber, good fat, or acids (such as lemon juice and vinegar).

The South Beach Dietâ„¢ can aid in maintaining stable blood-sugar levels, since it emphasizes foods that offer a good nutritional package, help to slow digestion, and are lower on the glycemic index. If you have diabetes, you should always be under the care of a physicianâ€”and be sure to check with him or her before modifying your eating habits.

------------
 Preventing Hypoglycemia 

 The following Daily Dish is part of a series for American Diabetes Month 

Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, is a health threat for those with diabetes. The key to treating symptoms without sabotaging your diet is to prevent hypoglycemia before it happens.

The first step in staving off hypoglycemia is to work closely with your physician. It&apos;s especially important to consult with your doctor when beginning Phase 1 of The South Beach Dietâ„¢, since cutting out high-glycemic carbohydrates could alter your diabetic medication needs.

Symptoms of hypoglycemia include feelings of hunger, dizziness, increased sweating, and irregular heartbeat. If you experience one of these symptoms, it&apos;s already too late. Your first instinct will be to reach for the quickest sugar fix. In fact, diabetics suffering from hypoglycemia are generally told to do just that-- pop a few candies or drink a sweet fruit juice and blood sugar will stabilize. While this is good advice in emergencies, waiting until hypoglycemia hits can encourage cravings and compromise your diet. An even better way to deal with hypoglycemia is to prevent symptoms before they occur.

The best way to prevent the symptoms of hypoglycemia is through regular snacking. Eating a low-glycemic carbohydrate and lean protein between meals will stave off feelings of intense hunger and allow your blood sugar levels to normalize. Aim for snacks, such as hummus and cruditÃ©s, that combine protein and vegetables.

------------
 Preventing Type 2 Diabetes 

 The following Daily Dish is part of a series for American Diabetes Month 

Type 2 diabetes develops when cells in the muscles, liver, and fat can no longer properly use insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar (glucose) levels. With type 2 diabetes, the pancreas is unable to keep up with increased insulin demand, and glucose begins to build up in the blood. Left unchecked, high concentrations of blood glucose can damage blood vessels and nerves and can cause heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and blindness.

The surest way to avoid developing diabetes is to reduce your risk factors while you&apos;re still healthy. The most common risk factors for type 2 diabetes are:

Â· Being overweight or obese
Â· Lack of exercise
Â· High blood pressure
Â· Age (the older you are, the greater the risk)
Â· Family history of diabetes
Â· Race (more common in African Americans, Asian Americans, American Indians, and Hispanics)

While some risk factors are beyond your control, the Diabetes Prevention Program, a major federally funded study of more than 3,000 people at high risk for diabetes, found that losing 5 to 7 percent of your body weight along with improved diet and increased exercise can delay or prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes. In addition, lowering your blood pressure and improving good cholesterol may also help you maintain your health. By following The South Beach Dietâ„¢, you&apos;ll be taking an important step toward improving your well-being, both now and for years to come.

Type 2 diabetes was regularly referred to as &quot;adult onset diabetes,&quot; since the disease generally began to appear during adulthood. In the last 20 years, however, the number of children diagnosed with type 2 diabetes has skyrocketed, presumably due to the epidemic of obesity and decreased physical activity among children.

If you suspect your child may be at high risk of developing diabetes, it&apos;s important you have him or her tested by your health-care provider. At-risk children include those who are overweight or obese and those with diabetes in the family.

What can parents do to prevent childhood diabetes before it develops? The number one way is to encourage your child to be physically active. You can do this by planning regular family activities or by setting a good example with your own fitness routine. It&apos;s also a good idea to encourage your child to turn off the computer or television every once in a while and get outdoors to play. And whether or not your child is carrying extra weight, be sure to boost his or her take of fresh whole fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.

 Preventing Diabetes with Exercise 

 The following Daily Dish is part of a series for American Diabetes Month 

According to the National Institutes of Health, being overweight or obese is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Reducing your body weight can reduce your risk of developing diabetes, and the best way to lose weightâ€”besides a healthy dietâ€”is by participating in a regular exercise program.

In response to a landmark study known as the Diabetes Prevention Program, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) created an initiative to encourage those at risk of diabetes to make healthy lifestyle changes. The NIH recommends that people with pre-diabetes (higher-than-normal blood sugar but not yet diabetes) participate in 30 minutes of exercise five days a week.

Acceptable physical activities can be as simple as walking the dog or taking the stairs instead of the elevator. For more information, visit the Web site of the National Diabetes Education Program .

 How to Cook with Tofu 

 This Daily Dish is part of a series on kitchen basics. 

Tofu is made from curdled soy milk, a liquid extracted from ground, cooked soybeans. Tofu is a versatile ingredient that can be either the blandest or the tastiest part of a dish, depending on how it&apos;s used. Its numerous varieties make it an ideal replacement for animal products in both savory and sweet dishes.

Tofu comes in two typesâ€”silken and normal. Silken tofu tends to be more slimy because it&apos;s not as pressed as normal tofu and, therefore, contains more moisture. Silken tofu is ideal for baking, smoothies, or for other times when you would desire a smoother consistency. Normal tofu is the kind that you would typically buy in the grocery store.

Both silken and normal tofu come in varying levels of firmness: soft, firm, and extra firm. The firmer the tofu, the less moisture it contains and the more marinade it will be able to absorb. Even so, since tofu comes packaged in water, it&apos;s always a good idea to remove excess moisture before use by pressing your tofu. To do this, cut the block into four slices, wrap with paper towels, and lay them under a heavy object (like a cutting board). Leave it for thirty minutes and the paper towels will absorb the excess water. Don&apos;t bother pressing soft tofu, as it will just fall apart.

The kind of tofu you use depends on what you plan to cook. Both soft and silken tofus are good blended into baked goods or fruit smoothies. Firm and extra-firm tofu can be used as a meat replacement in any dish, from a stir-fry to cacciatore. You can fry tofu in oil or broil it in the oven to create a crunchy, golden-brown skin; you can scramble tofu to make an omelet; and you can even use tofu to make cheesecake. Whatever you choose to do, don&apos;t be afraid to experiment.

 Maintaining a Healthy Brain 

 November is National Alzheimer&apos;s Awareness Month 

What good is a healthy body if you don&apos;t have a healthy mind to go along with it? The good news is that improving your diet is just one of the many ways you can maintain a healthy brain and reduce your risk of developing Alzheimer&apos;s disease.

According to the National Institute on Aging, 4.5 million Americans suffer from Alzheimer&apos;s disease, a progressive brain disorder that gradually damages a person&apos;s memory and ability to learn, reason, make judgments, communicate, and carry out daily activities. No cure currently exists for the disease, though daily inroads are being made toward effective treatments.

Some risk factors for Alzheimer&apos;s are beyond your controlâ€”aging and family history play a big part in your chances of developing the disease. Still, you may be able to delay or prevent Alzheimer&apos;s by adopting the following brain-healthy habits:

 Aim for a healthy heart. High blood pressure and heart disease are both risk factors for Alzheimer&apos;s. You can control both by maintaining a healthy body weight, cholesterol level, and blood-sugar level.

 Exercise, exercise, exercise. Regular exercise maintains proper blood flow to the brain and lowers the risk of heart disease and stroke.

 Work out your brain. Participate in activities that stimulate your brain, such as reading, crossword puzzles, or adult education classes. Such activities can strengthen brain cells or even create new ones.

 Are You at Risk for Lung Cancer? 

 November is National Lung Cancer Awareness Month 

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths among men and women in the United States, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS). Are you at risk of developing this potentially deadly disease? Here are some common risk factors for lung cancer:


 Smoking. According to the ACS, tobacco smoke causes 80 percent of lung cancer cases. As a man, you increase your chances of developing cancer by 22 percent if you smoke. For a woman, those chances increase by 12 percent. The good news is that quitting smoking can reduce your risk of developing the disease. Second-hand smoke. Also called passive smoking or environmental tobacco smoke, second-hand smoke is a legitimate health threat. Tobacco smoke contains more than 4,000 chemicals that are known carcinogens. Even the slightest exposure to tobacco smoke can increase your chances of developing lung cancer. Because of this, many states now have smoking laws to cut down on tobacco smoke exposure in public places such as businesses, airports, restaurants, and even bars. Radon exposure. The third most dangerous risk factor, radon is an invisible and odorless gas that occurs naturally as uranium breaks down in soil. While radon is not dangerous outdoors, it can be harmful indoors at more concentrated levels. If you&apos;re worried about radon contamination, you can have your home&apos;s levels tested. Radon inside the home can increase your risk of cancer by only a small amount when compared to the effects of smoking. Exposure to asbestos and other industrial materials. The government has for years banned the use of asbestos, although there are still some older commercial and public buildings where it can be found. Asbestos is known to cause a type of lung cancer, but it&apos;s only considered dangerous when it is released into the air either by demolition or deterioration.

 Can You Predict Heart Disease? 

Think your parents&apos; heart-health history is the best predictor of your own future heart health? Not according to a recent study published in the journal Circulation, which found that the health of your siblings appears to have a greater influence on your chances of developing heart disease.

Researchers in Ohio interviewed and tested 8,500 healthy adults and found that those with a brother or sister who had already been diagnosed with heart disease were almost three times more likely to have heart disease themselves. People with siblings who had suffered heart attacks or required heart surgery were almost four times more likely to have advanced heart disease. In comparison, people with healthy siblings and parents with heart disease were only twice as likely to suffer from heart disease.

What does this mean for the average Joe or Jane? These findings stress the importance of providing your physician with a thorough family health history that includes your siblings. If your physician determines that you are at a greater risk of developing heart disease because of the health of your parents and/or siblings, you can begin to work to lower your risk with diet changes, regular exercise, and possibly medication.

 Benefits of a Mediterranean Diet 

Two recent studies in the Journal of the American Medical Association show that following a Mediterranean-style diet can increase longevity and decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease.

A Mediterranean diet is rich in whole grains, fresh vegetables, fish, and monounsaturated fats and low in meat, dairy, and saturated fats. It&apos;s common in households in Italy and Greece and is rapidly growing in popularity throughout the world.

The first study examined the Mediterranean diet as an influential factor in longevity. Scientists from the Netherlands looked at the individual and combined benefits of following a Mediterranean diet, limiting alcohol consumption, getting regular exercise, and not smoking. People who ate a Mediterranean diet had a 23 percent lower risk of death from all causes.

The second study found that following a Mediterranean diet decreased body weight, cholesterol, glucose levels, blood pressure, and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease (known collectively as metabolic syndrome).

What does this mean for South Beach dieters? The South Beach Dietâ„¢ incorporates many of the beneficial aspects of the Mediterranean diet. When combined with regular exercise, moderate alcohol consumption, and a nonsmoking lifestyle, the South Beach Dietâ„¢ can be another step toward living a longer, fuller life.

 South Beach Diet Study Results Are In! 

The results are in on a new study comparing The South Beach Dietâ„¢ to the more traditional low-fat, low-calorie, high-carbohydrate diet promoted by the American Heart Association (AHA) and the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP). The verdict? Following The South Beach Dietâ„¢ promotes favorable changes in blood lipid levels and greater short-term weight loss than a traditional low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet.

The study, co-written by Dr. Agatston and published in the October 25th issue of the Archives of Internal Medicine, followed 60 people on either The South Beach Dietâ„¢ or a lower-fat, high-carb diet. Researchers tracked participants over a period of three months and evaluated weight loss, blood lipid levels, and waist-to-hip ratios.

After three months, those on The South Beach Dietâ„¢â€”which includes overall lower total carbohydrates than the NCEP diet, but is higher in complex carbohydrates, lean protein, and monounsaturated fatâ€”lost 6 pounds more than those on the NCEP diet. Significantly favorable changes in all lipid levels occurred with The South Beach Dietâ„¢â€”but not in the NCEP group. Waist-to-hip ratio was not significantly different between the two groups. Overall, The South Beach Dietâ„¢ caused more weight loss than the NCEP diet, had no adverse effects, and improved lipid levels during the three-month trial.

 How to Steam Vegetables 

 This Daily Dish is part of a series on kitchen basics. 

Steaming is the ideal way to cook vegetablesâ€”not only is it easy, but it also requires no added fat. Steamed vegetables are healthy, crunchy, and flavorful. If you&apos;ve never steamed your vegetables before, now&apos;s the time to master this technique.


 Add an inch or two of water to a large pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Prepare your vegetables for cooking. Make sure you cut them into evenly sized pieces so they will all cook within the same amount of time. Place your steaming basket (a specially designed tool that fits inside a pot and holds food just over the surface of the water) into the pot of water. Add your vegetables to the basket and cover. Cook until your vegetables reach the desired texture. The longer you cook them, the less crunchy they will be. Most vegetables only require about a minute or two of steamingâ€”remember that steam is hotter than boiling water, so vegetables won&apos;t need as long to cook. Be careful not to overcook, or you&apos;ll end up with mushy veggies. Remove the vegetables from the heat and serve immediately. Try out your steaming skills with new recipes.

 &apos;South Beach Diet Recommended&apos; Kraft Products 

While shopping at the grocery store, you&apos;ll likely run across Kraft products such as lean Oscar Mayer meats and Boca meat substitutes labeled with a circular blue button that reads &quot;South Beach Dietâ„¢ Recommended.&quot; What does this button mean? As part of a new alliance between Kraft Foods and The South Beach Dietâ„¢, food items with the label meet the nutrition principles of The South Beach Dietâ„¢ and are therefore an acceptable part of the plan. On the back of each package, you&apos;ll also find information about which Phases of the diet the item fits into.

Having South Beach Dietâ„¢ recommended products available at grocery stores nationwide should help make the plan even simpler to followâ€”especially for those of us who are crunched for time. Of course, you can still eat other foods and brands that comply with the principles of the diet.

Kraft has also developed the South Beach Dietâ„¢ Recipe Sampler, a booklet containing a diet overview, coupons, and 45 recipes complete with color photographs. Look for it at your grocery store.

 Avoiding Stress-Eating 

It&apos;s common to respond to stress by distracting yourself with your favorite comfort foods. Here are some ideas for healthier ways to cope when you&apos;re under pressure:


 Preempt unhealthy eating. Keep unacceptable foods out of the houseâ€”or at least keep them out of sight. If you know a particular food will be irresistible to you when you&apos;re stressed, act now to make it hard to get later. Keep your hands busy. Find something else to do with your hands besides eat. Keep the daily crossword handy, turn your attention to minor chores, or distract yourself by picking up the phone and calling your friends or family. Reach for healthy snacks. If you have to eat, make sure that any foods you reach for will be healthy ones. Try crunchy vegetables like celery sticks, green-pepper strips, cauliflower buds, and broccoli florets. If you don&apos;t want them plain, dip them in hummus or an eggplant dip, or eat them with a bit of low fat cheese. Prepare these snacks ahead of time, and keep them in front of your refrigerator. 
----------
 New Health Claim for Olive Oil 

Your olive oil may be getting a new label. On November 1, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that it would allow a qualified health claim for olive oil and certain products containing olive oil. Manufacturers can begin printing this health claim on their packaging.

The FDA-approved health claim reads, &quot;Limited and not conclusive scientific evidence suggests that eating about 2 tablespoons (23 grams) of olive oil daily may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease due to the monounsaturated fat in olive oil. To achieve this possible benefit, olive oil is to replace a similar amount of saturated fat and not increase the total number of calories you eat in a day. One serving of this product [Name of food] contains [x] grams of olive oil.&quot;

Olive oil is one of the few cooking oils available that is both rich in monounsaturated fats and cancer-fighting antioxidants. It can be used for sautÃ©ing, stir-frying, or dressing salads and vegetables. A mere two tablespoons a day is all you need to enjoy its benefits, but remember not to overdo itâ€”too much olive oil can be a diet buster.

 Handling a Winter Cold 

Have you been hit by a nasty winter cold? We all get them from time to time, but the trick is figuring out how to avoid compromising your diet while sick. Here are a few tips from Dr. Agatston on how to treat a cold while on The South Beach Dietâ„¢.


 Drink plenty of fluids. Water is the optimal choice, but if you feel especially dehydrated, an electrolyte balancing drink can be a good alternative. In addition, hot herbal tea will soothe a sore throat, and club soda may soothe an upset stomach. Choose a medication in pill or sugar-free liquid form. Pills will not contain a significant amount of high-glycemic sugars, and sugar-free cough drops or cough syrup should not be difficult to find with the help of your pharmacist. These products are commonly made for diabetics. Be aware that these products may contain sugar alcohols, increased amounts of which can cause GI distress. Take a zinc pill within the first 24 hours of a cold. Zinc products, such as Zicam or Cold-Eeze, can shorten the duration and intensity of a cold if taken at the first sign of symptoms. Get plenty of rest. Allowing your body proper time to rest will help ensure a speedy recovery. Put your health first. If you can&apos;t find sugar-free medicine or are worried about skipping your daily exercise, don&apos;t stress. Your health should come first â€” once you are 100 percent again, you can get back to the diet. 
----------
 Ending Embarrassing Gas 

Some people experience an increase in gas when starting a new diet. While not a symptom of any serious condition, gas can be uncomfortable and embarrassing. Here are a few ways to cut down on gas:


 Reduce sugar alcohol intake. One of the unfortunate side effects of sugar alcohol consumption is excessive gas production. Since sugar alcohols are found in a variety of sugar-free foods, it&apos;s very likely that they are the cause of your troubles. For this reason, it&apos;s recommended that you limit your consumption of sugar alcohol-containing foods to no more than 75 calories per day. Give it more time. The South Beach Dietâ„¢ encourages increasing dietary fiber intake, and increased fiber leads to increased gas production. Once your body has grown accustomed to the increased fiber, gas production should settle down. Reduce gas-producing foods. If time doesn&apos;t correct the problem, you may need to identify and reduce problem foods. Beans, cauliflower, and cabbage are notorious gas producers. Try cutting back on the number of daily servings of each of these foods. Cut back on fiber supplementation. Taking a daily fiber supplement like Metamucil will also increase gas production. Try easing up on your daily use of these supplements and see if your gas problem clears up. If it does, you may want to cut back on your dosage of these supplements and concentrate more on getting fiber from natural sources. Pay a visit to your doctor. If none of the above culprits are responsible for your troubles, it may be time to see a doctor. Excessive gas production can also be attributed to lactose intolerance, irritable bowel syndrome, or antibiotic use. Your doctor should be able to help you figure out an appropriate solution.

 Hot Cocoa on a Cold Day? 

Nothing warms the bones on a cold winter day better than a nice big cup of hot chocolate. Thanks to recent advances in food manufacturing, along with the push for diet-friendly foods, hot cocoa can be an acceptable part of The South Beach Dietâ„¢.

Most traditional hot cocoas contain a lot of added high-glycemic sugar, but you can find a few varieties made with artificial sweeteners. As with other artificially sweetened products, be careful not to overdo it. These products may contain sugar alcohols, which can cause intestinal distress if eaten in large quantities. Count hot cocoa as a sweet treat, and limit yourself to no more than 75 calories per day.

If hot cocoa&apos;s not your thing, but you&apos;re still looking for a warm, diet-friendly drink with a little more pizzazz than tea or coffee, try a cup of chai tea (go for the varieties in tea bags, as mixes often have added sugar or honey) with a touch of nonfat milk or soy milk.

 New-and-Improved Thanksgiving Menu 

If you&apos;re determined to do Thanksgiving on The South Beach Dietâ„¢, you&apos;ll need a plan of attack and a revised menu. Here are South Beach alternatives to all of your favorite Thanksgiving dishes:

 Roast turkey = Nothing unhealthy here!

 Stuffing = (Phase 2) Use whole-wheat bread and add mushrooms, garlic, nuts, beans, or eggplant.

 Gravy = Use the pan drippings with the fat skimmed off, and replace cornstarch with a small amount of arrowroot.

 Cranberry relish = Replace sugar with sugar substitute (for a recipe, visit the Thanksgiving section of The South Beach Dietâ„¢ Online). Those in Phase 2 and beyond can try blending other whole fruits, such as oranges, to balance the tart flavor of cranberries.

 Mashed potatoes = Whip up a batch of South Beach &quot;Surprise&quot; Mashed Potatoes (you&apos;ll find the recipe online).

 Side dishes = This is a great opportunity to boost your take of fresh vegetables. Try roasted green beans with slivered almonds, or saute some spinach with garlic and olive oil.

 Pumpkin pie = The South Beach Dietâ„¢ Online has a number of clever alternatives, including Pumpkin Spice Ricotta CrÃ¨me (Phase 1) and Individual Pumpkin SoufflÃ©s (Phase 2 and beyond).

 Preparing for the Holidays 

Halloween is behind us, but the holiday fun is just beginning. Along with the festivities come countless opportunities for feasting on fattening foods. Instead of locking yourself in your home until January 1, remember that it is possible to enjoy the holidays while staying on track with your diet.

The key to holiday success is to plan for indulgences. It&apos;s OK to enjoy an occasional treat as long as you follow the meal plan for your Phase and exercise on a daily basis. Rather than eating whatever you want during the holidays and trying to make up for it later, try to find a happy balance between indulgence and moderation. If you can master this skill, you will find it useful for special occasions throughout the year.

-------------
 Finding Time to Exercise During the Holidays 

If you&apos;re cooking up a Thanksgiving feast to feed a small army, you may not have a lot of time for your regular exercise routine. Here are four ways to make time for exercise during the holidays:


 Cook ahead of time. Dishes made South Beach Dietâ„¢-friendly, such as cranberry relish, soups, and vegetable sides, can be prepared on the day before Thanksgiving. By spreading out the work over two days, you&apos;ll reduce stress and make time for a short walk. Recruit a few helpers. Get your family members involved in the preparation of the meal, and you can ask someone to take over for thirty minutes while you go for a walk. Having multiple &quot;chefs&quot; means that you can each alternate taking short breaks. Plan a family activity. Not only will a family activity get everyone moving, but it&apos;ll also get you out of a cramped, family-filled house. You can all head to the park, go for a bike ride, or take a walk around town. Maybe you&apos;ll even get in some early Christmas shopping! Get up a little earlier. If you can get up before the rest of the family, you can squeeze in a short workout or yoga routine. This will give you the energy to survive the day and keep you focused and calm throughout the holiday.

 Taking the &apos;Stuffed&apos; Out of Stuffing 

What&apos;s Thanksgiving without stuffing for your turkey? This year, if you&apos;re in Phase 2 or beyond, you don&apos;t have to skip this delicious side dish. Instead, try this recipe for a South Beach Dietâ„¢-friendly stuffing:

Whole-Wheat and Sage Stuffing (Serves 8 )

Ingredients
1 16-ounce can fat-free chicken stock
1 cup onion, diced small
1/2 cup celery, diced small

1/4 teaspoon ground pepper
8 slices whole-wheat bread (crusts removed), cut into 1/2-inch cubes

Instructions
Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Heat oil in skillet and sautÃ© onions and celery until translucent. Remove from heat and let cool. Cut bread into 1/2-inch cubes and set aside. In a large bowl, mix bread, vegetables, egg, sage, salt, and pepper. Spray 1 1/2-quart casserole dish with nonstick spray. Bake until done, about 30 minutes.

-------------
 Holiday Pumpkin Souffles 

Have you decided to forgo pumpkin pie this Thanksgiving? Instead of depriving yourself of this treat, try this delicious, Phase 2 alternative:

Individual Pumpkin SoufflÃ©s (Serves 8 )

Ingredients
2 whole eggs
2 egg whites
1 1/4 cups canned pumpkin
1/4 cup fructose or sucralose
Pinch salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1 1/4 cups evaporated skim milk
1/2 tablespoon vanilla extract
Fat-free whipped topping (optional)

Blend in the fructose or sucralose, salt, cinnamon, evaporated milk, and vanilla. Fill each ramekin with 1/2 cup mixture. Place the ramekins in a baking dish and add enough warm water to come 2/3 of the way up the cups. Bake 40 minutes or until knife inserted in center of custard comes out clean. Remove from oven. Serve warm or room temperature, and top with fat-free whipped topping, if desired.

 Getting Back on Track After Thanksgiving 

Thanksgiving&apos;s over, for better or worseâ€”now what? Whether you strayed from the diet or not, it may take a little work to return to your normal routine. Here are five steps to get you back on track.


 Get rid of leftovers . Turkey can be made into healthy dishes, but mashed potatoes and pumpkin pie (if you allowed yourself these treats) should be thrown away. If you don&apos;t want to waste food, have your relatives take home the leftovers, or donate them to a local shelter. Clean your kitchen. Make sure no unhealthy foods have crept back into the cupboards over the holiday. Take a trip to the grocery store to replenish your healthy snacks. Return to Phase 1. If you overindulged, you may have to go back to Phase 1 in order to eliminate cravings. Don&apos;t think of it as starting over; instead, look at it as a way to avoid packing on the post-holiday pounds. Get back to the gym. Dive right back into your normal exercise routine. It&apos;s easy to avoid exercising during this time of the year, but resist the temptation, and you&apos;ll help keep off extra holiday weight. Get ready for the next holiday. Christmas and Hanukkah are just around the corner. Take the lessons you learned from Thanksgiving and use them to plan your next holiday celebration. If you keep your Thanksgiving failures and successes in mind, you&apos;ll be better prepared for the road ahead.

 Hanukkah Help 

Hanukkah, also known as the festival of lights, is an eight-day Jewish holiday that celebrates the ideals of freedom of belief and expression. Jews commemorate this special occasion by spending time with family, exchanging gifts, lighting candles, and eating traditional foods. During this special time of the year, Dr. Agatston wants you to feel free to enjoy your favorite dishes without modification if you so choose. For those who want to maintain The South Beach Dietâ„¢ throughout this holiday, all it takes are a few simple changes.

The two most traditional Hanukkah foods are potato pancakes (known as latkes) and jelly doughnuts (known as soofganiot). To make them diet-friendly, try the following:

South Beach &quot;Potato&quot; Pancakes (Phase 1): Replace potatoes with low-fat cottage cheese, whole milk with skim milk, sugar with artificial sweetener, and vegetable oil with canola oil.

Jelly Doughnuts (Phase 2): Replace white flour with whole-wheat flour, sugar with artificial sweetener; sugar-sweetened preserves with no-added-sugar preserves, jam, or jelly; and whole milk with skim milk. Fry lightly in oil and pat with a towel to soak up extra oil.

----------------
 Cheese Latkes on the Beach 

Starting in Phase 2, this Hanukkah recipe is a good alternative to the traditional potato pancake. The South Beach Dietâ„¢ encourages the use of whole wheat flour for baking, but due to the delicate nature of this recipe and the yield of 12 pancakes, a small amount of white flour is allowed.

Cheese Latkes
PHASE 2

Makes approx. 12 pancakes

Ingredients
3 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup water
1 tablespoon sugar substitute
1 1/2 cups low-fat cottage cheese
1/2 cup all-purpose (plain) flour, sifted
3 tablespoons skim milk
salt
ground black pepper
canola oil for frying
sugar-free apricot jam

Instructions
Mix all the ingredients together. Heat the oil. Put spoonfuls of the mixture into the pan and fry on both sides until golden. Serve with the sugar-free apricot jam.

 4 Easy Holiday Exercises 

Convinced you can&apos;t stay in shape during the holidays? Try one of these simple at-home exercises. Remember, every little bit of activity can boost your health and help burn calories!


 Stair climbing. If you live in a multi-level house, stairs are the most readily accessible exercise tool. Make it a point to climb up and down them an extra 10 times each day. Yoga. If you don&apos;t know any moves, pick up a video at your local rental place. Yoga not only calms you during these stressful times, it also improves strength, flexibility, and balance. Weight lifting. If you own a set of hand weights, you can easily do two to three sets of each of your favorite arm and leg exercises. If you don&apos;t have hand weights at your disposal, cans of pumpkin or cranberry sauce make great stand-ins. Flex your creativity as well as your muscles. Couch crunches. Keep your abs in shape with this simple technique. Lay on the floor with your butt flush against the couch and your legs at a ninety-degree angle on the cushions. Put your hands behind your head and crunch up toward the couch. Perform two to three sets of 15. 
-------------
 Drinking During the Holidays 

What fun are the holidays without eggnog, Christmas punch, and champagne? Luckily, if you&apos;re in Phase 2, you don&apos;t have to give up these special beverages in order to stick to your diet. As always, drink them in moderation (and during or after a meal), and use the following list as your drinking guide:

 OK As Is: 
Vodka, Rum, Gin, Whiskey, Scotch, Bourbon, Tequila, Wine

Note: Replace sweetened mixers and sodas with their sugar-free counterparts.

 OK With Modifications: 
Eggnog: Replace cream with skim milk or fat-free half-and-half and sugar with artificial sweetener.
Champagne: Enjoy a glass or two of the extra-brut variety over the holidays starting in Phase 2.
Christmas Punch: Make with sugar-free powdered drink mixes and extra-brut champagne.


 Avoid, If Possible: 
Dessert Wines, Flavored Liqueurs, Wine Coolers

Note: If you choose to drink, make sure you do so during or right after a meal, since a stomach full of food will slow the absorption of alcohol into your bloodstream â€” and keep your blood-sugar levels steadier.

--------------
 The December Kitchen 

Navigating the holidays while sticking to a diet can be tricky. How do you treat yourself without going overboard? The first step is to maintain a kitchen stocked with healthy treats instead of temptations.

You can indulge a little at family meals and office parties as long as you&apos;re eating healthy foods at home. Here are a few items you should keep around at all times during the holiday season:

Part-skim ricotta cheese
Fresh eggs
Nuts
Fat-free plain yogurt
Part-skim cheese sticks
Sliced deli meat: ham, turkey breast, roast beef, and chicken
Fresh fruits and vegetables
Tuna fish (canned in water)
Turkey bacon
Olive oil

By keeping these healthy foods on hand at all times, you can save your moments of indulgence for those truly irresistible holiday treats.

--------------
 Turkey and Ham Alternative 

Tired of the same old turkey or ham at Christmastime? Looking for a main course that is both nutritious and innovative? Shake up your holiday table by serving a delicious fish dish like Orange Roughy in Scallion and Ginger Sauce, which is good for all Phases.

Orange Roughy in Scallion and Ginger Sauce (Serves 2)

Ingredients
1/3 cup dry sherry or vermouth
3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
2 teaspoons sesame oil
1/4 cup finely chopped green onion
1 teaspoon freshly grated ginger
1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic
2 orange roughy* fillets (1 pound)

Instructions
Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Combine the sherry or vermouth, soy sauce, sesame oil, onion, ginger, and garlic in a small bowl.

Place the fish fillets in an ovenproof casserole dish. Drizzle the marinade over the fish and bake for 12 minutes or until the fish flakes easily.

* Substitute cod, sole, or flounder for the orange roughy.

 Holiday Parties 101 

Whether it&apos;s a family dinner or an office gathering, parties are enemy number one to struggling dieters. These five simple strategies can help you cope:


 Fill up before the feast. If you&apos;re worried about overindulging at a holiday celebration, eat a healthy meal or snack beforehand. You may allow yourself an occasional treat throughout the holidays â€” while enjoying healthy foods the majority of the time. Just remember that the more you indulge, the more setbacks you&apos;ll have to overcome in the New Year. Make the rounds. Instead of stationing yourself by the food table, make it a point to mingle among the guests. If you&apos;re seated at a family table, get up and pay a visit to every cousin or nephew. Moving around will help you resist the urge to overeat. Bring a sidekick. Two willpowers are better than one, right? If you don&apos;t think you can resist the season&apos;s temptations, then bring a dieting friend along for the ride. Together you can encourage each other to stay true to your goals, or you can at least commiserate when you falter â€” and then check in with each other to make sure you&apos;re each getting back on track! Keep a secret stash. For those dire emergencies, hide a healthy snack in your purse or coat. When the urge to splurge hits, reach for the snack instead. Offer to bring a dish. Your host will appreciate the offer, and you&apos;ll get the chance to surround yourself with Beach-friendly treats such as Chilled Espresso Custard or Lemon Zest Ricotta CrÃ¨me.

 Holidays and The South Beach Diet 

Thinking of starting The South Beach Dietâ„¢ during the holidays? The holiday season is always a challenging time to try to change the way you eat. Still, it&apos;s not impossible. If you&apos;re determined to start the diet now, consider starting in Phase 2 and go back to Phase 1 after New Year&apos;s.

For the next few weeks, you will be constantly surrounded by temptations in the form of cookies, cakes, and other holiday dishes. Dr. Agatston suggests that you approach this festive time of year by eating healthily whenever possible and allowing yourself a few bites of an occasional treat now and then. By following Phase 2, you&apos;ll also be permitting yourself the occasional glass of wine at a holiday celebration. Then, once the New Year hits, you can follow the more restrictive Phase 1 in order to kick your cravings and jump-start your weight loss.

 Holiday Survival Tactics 

Stressed out by the upcoming Christmas and New Year&apos;s holidays? Take a few tips from fellow South Beach Dieters who&apos;ve been through it time and again. Here are just a few of the ways they avoid undoing all their hard work:

&quot;With luncheons and gatherings, as well as Christmas dinner, I am going to use the three-bites [rule] â€” and select SBD-friendly foods when [eating] out as best I can.&quot;
â€” Bree

&quot;My tactic this season is to step up my exercise. My health club has a contest that requires participants to try a bunch of different exercise offerings at the club. The contest should be a motivator for me as well.&quot;
â€” Sue G.

&quot;I usually walk about five miles at night. When I&apos;m unable to do that, I go to the mirror and pull my shirt up just enough to admire the curves I have gotten back from this diet. After that, I have the willpower I need to walk back out and not cheat, because I&apos;m worth the progress that I have worked so hard for and I want to keep it.&quot;
â€” Jenney

 Holiday Ham 

Although honey-baked hams are not recommended on The South Beach Dietâ„¢ (they contain large amounts of high-glycemic sugar), you can enjoy ham as long as it doesn&apos;t have a sugary glaze and you trim excess fat before baking. If you&apos;re in Phase 2, try this Beach-friendly technique: Fifteen minutes before removing your ham from the oven, brush it with sugar-free apricot preserves. Then, right before applying the glaze, press whole cloves into the ham.

 Succulent Sweet Potato Side 

This tempting dish is sure to be a hit for the holidays. Not only will it bring color and variety to your holiday table, it&apos;s more nutritious than traditional mashed potatoes. Whip up a batch for your celebration (Phase 2 and beyond).

Whipped Sweet Potatoes (Serves 2)

Ingredients
1/2 pound sweet potatoes
2 tablespoons low-fat buttermilk
1/4 tablespoon trans-free margarine
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/8 teaspoon white pepper
Pinch of nutmeg
1/8 teaspoon allspice
2 tablespoons chopped pecans (optional)

Instructions
Peel potatoes and chop into medium-sized chunks. Cover with water in large pot and boil until pieces are easily pierced with a fork. While sweet potatoes cook, toast pecans on rimmed cookie sheet. Remove sweet potatoes from water, add buttermilk, margarine, and spices and mash together. With hand mixer or immersion blender, whip potatoes until smooth. Transfer potatoes to serving dish and top with chopped pecans. Serve immediately or keep warm uncovered in a 200Â° F oven.

 Celebrate with Soup 

Looking for the perfect cold-weather soup? Warm your insides with this tasty Phase 2 concoction. Not only is it a great way to use up any leftover sweet potatoes, it&apos;s easy to assemble and sure to please even the most stubborn Scrooge.

Ginger&amp;Sweet Potato Soup with Cilantro

8 servings
Prep time: 15 minutes
Start to finish: 50 minutes

Ingredients
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 medium leek, white part only, cut in half lengthwise, rinsed well between layers, and thinly sliced
1 medium carrot, chopped
2 pounds sweet potatoes or yams, peeled and cubed
1 1-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped, plus 1 teaspoon grated
4 cups chicken broth (homemade or reduced-sodium canned), or vegetable stock
3/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/4 cup nonfat plain yogurt
2 tablespoons 1 percent milk
Fresh cilantro leaves for garnish
Lime wedges

Instructions
1. Heat oil in a 4- to 6-quart Dutch oven or soup pot over medium-high heat. Add leek and carrot. Cook, stirring often, until they begin to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in sweet potatoes (or yams) and chopped ginger. Add broth and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until sweet potatoes are soft, about 30 minutes.

2. In batches, if necessary, transfer the soup to a blender or food processor and process until smooth. Return the soup to the pot, season with salt, and reheat. Just before serving, stir in grated ginger. Whisk yogurt and milk in a small bowl until smooth. Ladle soup into bowls, and drop a large dollop (or several small dollops) of thinned yogurt onto each one. Draw the tip of a knife or a toothpick through the yogurt to make decorative swirls.

 No More Wasting Food! 

Dieting can be expensive. The last thing you need is to throw away food because it spoiled before you had a chance to use it. The good news is, with some careful planning, you can easily avoid wasting food. Here&apos;s how:

1. The South Beach Dietâ„¢ recipes are good places to go for inspiration for your daily meals. However, some recipes, admittedly, are not ideal for the budget-conscious. A recipe containing 10 or more ingredients can be costly. To save money, refashion the recipes to fit your budget, or plan your own meals with your own ingredients. Once you grasp the principles of the diet, you&apos;ll have all the knowledge you need to create your own recipes.

2. Before you hit the grocery store, know exactly what you plan to make for the next two or three days, or even the next week. Make a list of foods you&apos;ll need, and don&apos;t stray from the list.

3. Fresh vegetables pose the biggest challenge for shoppers trying to save money. To avoid waste, don&apos;t overbuy at the market. It can be tempting to pick up extra vegetables from the produce aisle, but veggies spoil quickly. Instead, buy just what you need for the next few days, and use up what you have before buying more.

4. One of the best ways to save money and reduce waste is to keep your meals simple. Versatile food items such as grilled meat or fish, steamed vegetables, and simple salads can work well any night of the week for dinner. Leftovers can be used for lunch the following day. Remember that reducing waste is the first step toward saving money while on a diet.

5. If you cook a big meal on the weekends and plan to eat the leftovers throughout the week, make sure you use airtight containers to prevent spoilage. Also, some foods may lose their appeal after one or two days. To make them more appetizing, use them as the base for another dish. For example, a roast chicken can be eaten for three to four days, and after that, you can use any leftover meat to make soup.

 How to Store Leftovers 

Leftovers are beautiful when you&apos;re in a rush. However, if not packaged and stored properly, leftovers can be a recipe for illness. Here are a few tips for the safe handling of leftovers:


 To prevent contamination, always wash your hands before handling. Refrigerate or freeze leftovers within two hours of cooking. Divide large amounts of food into small, shallow containers to speed cooling and prevent bacterial growth. Cover food tightly with a lid, plastic wrap, or aluminum foil. Avoid overstuffing the refrigerator or freezerâ€”cold air needs room to circulate. Eat leftovers containing meat within three days of preparation. Everything else should be eaten within five days unless you choose to freeze it. Don&apos;t try to let hot food cool on the counter before putting it in the refrigerator. It&apos;s perfectly OKâ€”as well as advisableâ€”to refrigerate hot food immediately.

 Four Reasons to Eat Beans 

Beans are a great addition to any Phase of the South Beach Dietâ€”. Here&apos;s why:


 Curb your cholesterol. Beans are a major source of soluble fiber, which helps to remove cholesterol from the body before it&apos;s absorbed. Relieve your insulin woes. The soluble fiber in beans also aids in the creation of insulin receptor sites and helps to lower the amount of insulin floating through the bloodstream. Fulfill your dietary needs. In addition to fiber, beans are high in protein, folic acid, potassium, iron, calcium, and B-vitamins. On the flip side, they&apos;re low in cholesterol, fat, and, for the most part, sodium (stay away from canned beans unless they&apos;re the low-sodium type). Delay your hunger. In general, beans digest slowly, causing a sustained increase in blood sugar while preventing frequent hunger pangs.

 Apples for Alzheimer&apos;s 

A recent study performed at Cornell University found that a powerful antioxidant in apples might help fend off Alzheimer&apos;s disease.

The study compared the effectiveness of two antioxidants â€” quercetin (found in apples) and vitamin C. What they found was that rat brain cells treated with quercetin resisted Alzheimer&apos;s-like damage more readily than those treated with vitamin C or nothing at all.

Apples, which are reintroduced during Phase 2 of The South Beach Dietâ„¢ are the best sources of quercetin. In light of the study results, scientists are encouraging people to eat more apples. The highest concentration of quercetin is found in the skins of red apples. If you don&apos;t like whole apples, you can also get smaller concentrations of quercetin from onions, blueberries, and cranberries.
