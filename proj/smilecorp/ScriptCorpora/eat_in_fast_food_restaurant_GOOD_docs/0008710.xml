 June 2nd, 2011 

I am sitting in the main room of Metanoia 
 Braşov which is in Transilvania. Braşov is my favorite city so far. We 
 are into the second day of working on the seminar that is scheduled for 
 October of this year. It will be titled, The Theology of Church 
 Growth. They are working on what will become the workbook all 
 registrants will receive. It is quite a grueling process. If this were 
 America, I would tend to think that they are trying to go into too much 
 detail. However, I really dont have enough information. I do know that 
 they will whittle down the massive amount of charts, definitions, case 
 studies, etc., until they have 2-3 pages per session. That may mean they 
 will end up with something succinct and understandable that will 
 accomplish their purpose of giving the individual churches a tool 
 whereby they can measure their spiritual health as a church, relative to 
 growth.

Most churches that this survey will 
 ultimately go to are small by U.S. standards. Most have less than 100 on 
 Sundays. A few in the North and West have a few hundred. That is rare. 
 It is even rarer in the South, where Curtea De Argeşis. There is a 
 strong resistance in the South so churches tend to be small.

Back to the work at hand. The effort is based 
 on the idea that there are certain characteristics of a healthy church 
 that make it healthy. It also creates the right conditions for a church 
 to grow through conversions. The parable of the four soils is one of the 
 texts used to support this. The basic concept is that if the soil is 
 right then the seed will grow. If there are no weeds, if the soil is not 
 packed down, if it isnt choked out by thorns, then it will grow all by 
 itself. It is natural.

If this sounds familiar, it may be. I am 
 aware of Christian Schwartz work, Natural Church Development. I have 
 used his material and method in the past and I believe Osco has, as 
 well. I would like to do it again with the commitment to follow through 
 over a period of years, which is what it takes to benefit from the data 
 and the implementation of the action steps which were determined by the 
 surveys taken by 30 parishioners. Some of our people have no doubt taken 
 the surveys in the past.

The Romanians are devising their own system. 
 Im not absolutely sure why. It may be that using Schwartz would be cost 
 prohibitive. They do reference his work throughout.
I have to admire the dedication and hard work that I am witnessing. This 
 is the second or third time they have met. They drive from the four 
 corners of the country in order to gather to hash out what this 
 conference will be. Believe me, this is not a money making endeavor. 
 This is all about helping churches across the nation become a force in 
 their cities. To help them become healthy and able to win and disciple 
 the lost into maturity. It is a noble task, but a tough one.
Besides helping churches to become healthy through this project, there 
 is also the back story of teamwork and fellowship that is being modeled 
 by this coalition of several denominations and pastors. They are very 
 aware of their call to model authentic Christianity as best they can.
Why do this? They dare to believe that they can make a difference in the 
 social and spiritual condition of Romania. This is a big dream. No 
 wonder their coalition is called BIG Impact. I do know that this is 
 coming at a great sacrifice for most of them. They are not receiving 
 pay. They do get some help from some support in the U.S. However, it is 
 not much. Their lives are dedicated to winning Romanians and even 
 impacting the rest of Europe. It is encouraging to see such focused 
 dedication.

I am able to follow the general flow of 
 thought in most cases through the assistance of Cristis translating and 
 the fact that I am familiar with the material and can pick up a little 
 through PowerPoint. Reading is much easier than understanding Romanian 
 speech. The only trouble is that I have discovered that several 
 Romanians talking is a great natural sleep aid! It is now about an hour 
 after lunch and I find myself writing nonsense.

 Better go.

 May 31, 2011 

I spent 3 or 4 hours with Nelu and Cornelia, Magda, a 
 lady from the church, and Stefania, Nulus daughter who served as my 
 interpreter for the day. As I mentioned yesterday, we went to the 
 facility where the elderly are cared for. It is called an azil or an 
 asylum, which means it is a refuge for the elderly. Actually, it wasnt 
 just the elderly but included some middle aged folks, as well. It wasnt 
 nearly as bad as I had imagined. Although the circumstances were often 
 very sad.

Many of the individuals had been moved out of their homes and had been 
 sent to this facility by their children. It wasnt a very happy 
 situation. Many dont get visitors. So, they are always glad to have 
 someone from the outside to talk to. Also, more than a smattering were 
 not in their right minds.

Before I tell you about the ministry that took place there, let me tell 
 you about the area around the azil. As we drove north out of Curtea de 
 Arges, we drove through a number of villages and the countryside. The 
 countryside reminds me a lot of the hills and mountains of south central 
 Kentucky. The main difference is that is that as we would continue 
 north, the hills would gradually turn into true snow covered mountains, 
 unlike Kentucky. But the area around the azil was like it.

The team had packed a large supply of candy, pastries, strawberries, and 
 bananas to give to each patient. We would go room to room, each room 
 housing up to six patients. Once there, the two older ladies would greet 
 the patients and share the goodies with them. My job became toting the 
 bucket of strawberries as the ladies had enough to carry. Cornelia and 
 Magda had such compassion! Often, they would feed those who were either 
 blind or unable to feed themselves. They were always smiling and so 
 kind. Some of the rooms had quite a stench. Once, I had entered a 
 particularly pungent room before Cornelia came in. I watched her 
 intentionally to see if her smile altered as she breathed in the foul 
 air. Not a bit! Her smile never wavered. That took a lot of self-control 
 and genuine love. I wont name names but someone in our group (not me) 
 would sometimes be unable to enter and would often breathe through a 
 cloth. Some rooms were pretty bad.

The Romanian custom is to greet those you care for with kisses on both 
 cheeks, especially among the women. This was the usual greeting, 
 particularly for the old women Cornelia and Magda greeted. Nothing 
 mattered except that these ladies, in many cases, had no one who came to 
 visit or touch them. Many cried. Especially when Cornelia, Magda and 
 Stefania would sing a hymn to them. I cant say that I blame them. They 
 have such wonderfully beautiful voices.

The azil houses about two hundred patients and I believe all were 
 ministered to that day. Many were asked about their faith and many an 
 animated discussion followed. The Romanians are generally very 
 expressive and it is easy for an American to mistakenly think that 
 someone is angry when, in fact, they are simply being Romanian and 
 engaged.

After about four hours of going room to room on what I remember to be 
 five floors spread over two buildings, everyone was tired and hungry. As 
 I followed and observed them, I had to think of Matthew 25. Then the 
 righteous will answer him, Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed 
 you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a 
 stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did 
 we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you? The King will reply, 
 I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these 
 brothers of mine, you did for me.

I had prayed throughout the day that God would touch the patients and 
 reveal himself to them, as well as receive the service himself as the 
 Scripture promises. God bless those dear ladies who go once a month to 
 the azil.

(Nelu was present, as well. Sometimes he was with us. Often he was in 
 conversation with some of the patients that he had been building 
 relationships with. Quite few of the men were fairly healthy and were 
 out of their rooms, even outside. He has a great rapport with them. The 
 women were much more hands on and compassion sharing, as per their 
 particular calling.)

We topped the day off with a stop at one of Nelus sons-in-laws fish 
 farm where we were given some trout. Cornelia fried up a mess and we had 
 turkey soup for an appetizer, trout and strawberries dipped in sugar.

I arrived back at Cristis and Mirelas at 9:30. It was a full day, but 
 Im not complaining. 
 

 May 30, 2011 

Buna Dimineata!

I am spending a quiet Monday (Luni) morning at home. Cristi and Mirela 
 are taking Bill and Bobbie to Bucharesti. They fly back to the States 
 tomorrow very early. Home for them is Idaho. They will be back in the 
 fall to set up house in their new apartment. They are with Josiah 
 Venture. A great couple, they have been so helpful in giving me an 
 American perspective after having been here for several weeks, 
 exploring, learning and processing what it means to live in Romania. My 
 prayers are with them as they go home to tie up loose ends.

I am glad for a few quiet moments to reflect and pray. It has been a 
 whirlwind of activity since touching down over a week ago. Good 
 activities, but very busy. I really havent had very much time to 
 process and reflect on what I have seen and experienced.

We attended CCC last night here in Curtea de Arges. It was a discussion 
 of the sermon I preached that morning. It is standard to do that so 
 dont think I was being evaluated or up before the elders or anything! I shared some applications that I had not included in my sermon due to 
 time. Others shared as well. Afterward, we shared in communion. (I was 
 invited by Nelu to lead in communion as we would do it at Osco. I 
 graciously declined, saying I really wanted to experience the way they 
 normally did it.)

Cristi led in the communion segment. He shared from Scripture in Matthew 
 27 and 26. There was prayer and then Cristi broke a large piece of 
 flatbread and passed the loaf around. Everyone pulled off a substantial 
 piece. We then partook and prayed. Then the wine was served in a tray 
 very much like ours with little glass cups. It was a very deliberate and 
 unhurried service, as are most things here. It was good.

There are lots of times when I am unsure what the next step is in a 
 church service or gathering. I have learned that if you wait long 
 enough, it will become clear. Many Americans would become very 
 frustrated thinking that nothing was planned or organized well. Some 
 Romanians get a little frustrated, as well. I think that it is partly a 
 clash between the old, slower pace and the faster, more modern and 
 focused pace. Villages still operate on the old schedule. Cities tend to 
 move a bit faster, but that isnt totally true. Remember, I have been 
 here a week. My observations are not flawless. I am still trying to 
 understand.

This afternoon I am going to visit a facility for the elderly who dont 
 have enough money to live on their own. I was told it is something like 
 the orphanages of the 80s and 90s. The care is and facility isnt the 
 best. I am praying for Gods Spirit to really prepare me for what is to 
 come. Who knows what that will be like.

Wednesday morning we will be going to Brasov in Transylvania. This is 
 for a gathering of pastors who will be writing curriculum for BIG Impact 
 which is a Romania-wide network of pastors and churches designed to 
 strategically impact Romania. I am looking forward to both the 
 conference and to the mountain environment.

I heard that services at Osco have gone well these past two Sundays. I 
 am so appreciative to Tony and Paul as well as everyone who has been 
 caring for the responsibilities there. Special thanks to Nick J. who 
 reportedly did a great job preaching yesterday.

Thanks for your prayers and look to the Lord for your strength and hope.

 Pace (peace),

Doug

Buna dimineata! (the&quot;t&quot;should have a tail, giving 
 it a&quot;ts&quot;sound), Good morning!

I went to church at Community Christian Center in Curtea de Arges this 
 morning. It was a wonderful mixture of acapella singing (evidently there 
 are simply no musicians), prayer and preaching. The singing was 
 wonderful, as I have found all Romanian singing to be. Such a sweet 
 sound. Of course I understood almost none of the words, unless it was to 
 a familiar tune.

I was warmly welcomed and preached on Psalm 30 as planned. Preaching 
 through an interpreter was a new experience but went quite well, at 
 least from my point of view. Cristi is an excellent interpreter. I did 
 get so caught up in his interpreting my message that at one point I had 
 to ask him what I had said! Like I said, it was new to me. It was a 
 blessing.

I just returned from a feast at Nelu and Cornelia&apos;s home. Nelu is the 
 pastor at CCC. Five of his seven daughters were there, two with their 
 husbands and children...I&apos;m not sure who belonged to who. Those who have 
 been to CDA should know that Ruth, the youngest, is now a senior in high 
 school. So, of the seven, I think three are living at home.

We had a wonderful time. Even though most of the conversation was in 
 Romanian, it was delightfully entertaining as I have always found Latin 
 families to be. So dramatic and expressive! And, with five daughters 
 present, along with Cornelia, the women carried the conversation, 
 although the sons-in-law were no slouches.

It was an amazing meal. They had killed the fatted turkey. I guess you 
 can have a fatted turkey. Anyway, with turkey, dressing, mashed 
 potatoes, salad and some sort of pastry really brought to mind an 
 American Thanksgiving dinner. It was good. Of course, as is the custom 
 in Romania, strong coffee followed, which is fine with me.

I presented Cornelia with a scarf as a token of our love and 
 appreciation. I think she liked it and especially the workmanship. She 
 wore it throughout the meal. Thanks to Doreen V. for guiding me in that 
 direction.

I am reminded of God&apos;s love for us. At heart, American, Romanian or 
 whatever, we all have the same needs and desires. It is to a very 
 diversified world that Christ died for. It is exciting to see his work 
 and his workmanship among the Romanians. Continue to pray for the church 
 at Curtea de Arges and for me as I continue to grow in my understanding 
 of how God is working here and at home. Like the sons of Issachar, I 
 need wisdom both to interpret the signs and respond to the Spirit of God 
 as he leads.

Have a blessed service this morning. I have been praying that as Nick 
 speaks, God will speak to each and every heart present. You are near to 
 my heart. Pace.

Day 6 (already!): 


Spent a quiet morning at Cristi and Mirelas. They have a wonderful 
 house in which to host traveling dignitaries. And, even someone like me 
 I inhabit the lowest level of three. Bill and Bobbie Trenckmann are 
 staying on the main level and the Petricioius are on the upper level. 
 That is, our rooms are on those levels. With the kitchen on my level and 
 the main living room on the second level, we all sort of mix together 
 when we are all here.


Cristi, who was at Osco in February, has three kids: 
 Robert, Andrea, and Naomi. Im guessing 17, 15, and nine, respectively. 
 The entire family is a joy to be around.


Bill and Bobbie are newly appointed missionaries to 
 Romania. They just secured an apartment, ordered a car and are heading 
 back to the states for the summer on Monday. Their official start is in 
 the fall as I understand it. I have enjoyed getting to know them. They 
 have spent their lives in the western states (United States) and have 
 also served in Rwanda, Africa. They will be based in Piteste, about an 
 hour northwest of Curtea de Arges, where the Christian Community Center 
 is.


This afternoon, I met with Nelu, the pastor of CCC. 
 We talked and shared through his daughter, Stefaneia (sp?), who is about 
 to graduate with her masters in English. God has certainly been at work 
 in Romania, Curtea de Arges and at CCC. The great news is that Osco has 
 had a part of what has happened with CCC. It is clear to me that the 
 congregation there has had a great impact on Osco Church, as well. So 
 much of how they have reached out to kids and are seeking to connect 
 with their community reminds me of Osco.


As I said, we had a good talk for about 2 hours. He 
 also shared his dream of building on to the building next to the main 
 building. He showed me the drawings. It is exciting to see what God can 
 do through a church who really believe God will do what he has promised.


In a way, Nelu being a bit reserved, and, the 
 language barrier being a natural hindrance, we didnt really connect 
 until we played a marathon game of ping pong. Now, I play ping pong 
 about once every 7 yearsmaybe. I knew from the moment he spoke two 
 words ping and pong that I was being set up. However, it was great fun 
 and Im not terrible and the more I played the better I got, so I dont 
 think he was bored. It seems to hold true that men often connect over a 
 project or some physical activity. It was good.


The economy in Romania has not been good but it had 
 been gradually improving until the recent downturn. As a result, Pastor 
 Nelu accepted a position on an oil rig in the Black Sea. He is on two 
 weeks and off two weeks. He preaches when he is home and works as a 
 mechanic and witness for Christ on the oil platforms the other two 
 weeks. Cristi preaches while he is away. Cristi is sort of the volunteer 
 associate.


Nelu and I had a good conversation. They have a 
 pharmacy where folks from the community can get free prescriptions and 
 other medical care items. A local doctor and another medical person 
 helps out too. Romania has socialized medicine but no one wants to go to 
 the hospital because of cost, lack of good care (each patient is 
 responsible for his own linens, and must pay for or provide most 
 everything else including medicines) so a pharmacy that doesnt charge 
 is a great way to meet needs and meet people.


The last Friday of every month is a fast day. 
 Everyone gathers at 6pm for singing, sharing about Gods answers to 
 prayer, what they fasted and prayed for and, then we prayed. Afterward, 
 we shared a meal and fellowship. It was a great night. The Romanians are 
 very welcoming and a joy to pretend to communicate withand really 
 communicate with.


Speaking of communicationthat is about it for me. 
 Thanks! Continue to pray.
Pastor Doug




 May 26, 2011 (afternoon) 

Arrived in Curtea de Arges today after four days at a 
 conference in Bucharest. It was a wonderfully challenging and insightful 
 few days, as I have tried to communicate, at least a little.

CDA is a wonderful change from the heat and hustle and bustle of a city 
 of over three million like Bucharest. It is located in the 
 foothills of the Carpathian Mountains and is a lively mixture of old and 
 new.

I am scheduled to preach on Sunday here in CDA. I will be jumping into a 
 series on the Psalms. I will be preaching on Psalm 30. Pray for me as I 
 haven&apos;t had to use a translator before. Plus, I just want to be clear 
 and biblical. I will try to get some photos and video uploaded soon. I 
 hope my time will be a little more conducive to keeping my Osco Family 
 informed.


Thanks for your prayers and for reading. I will tell 
 you more next time.

Blessings,
Doug

 

 May 26, 2011 

The conference is going well. It is interesting to 
 worship with hundreds of Romanians who are singing in a language that I 
 dont understand. Yet, there is such a sweet spirit there is no 
 mistaking that God is present in their hearts and lives. There is no 
 language barrier when hearts are joined in the worship of our Heavenly 
 Father. There is an eagerness to continue worship and it often goes on 
 for 40 minutes that feels like 15. The thought that I may not experience 
 that again many more times makes me a little sad. The upside is that it 
 is probably a bit like heaven. Only the complete understanding is 
 lacking. Can you imagine all Christians from all of history joining 
 together in praise around the throne of God? All nations, tribes and 
 tongues, lifting up the Name of our common Lord. Somehow, it is easier 
 to imagine here, surrounded by those so different, yet so much the same.

On a different note (pun, noted), I visited the 
 Peoples Palace with a couple of other Americans. It is the second 
 largest building in the world. Only our Pentagon is larger. This one was 
 built at the cost of three years of the gross national product of 
 Romania, and at the cost of thousands of lives, mostly through 
 starvation. The orphans that we heard so much about in the 90s are a 
 direct result of the egomaniacal character of Ceausescu who had this 
 building built as a monument to himself. So many families were forced 
 into abject poverty that either through death or hopelessness, they 
 abandoned their children. Since so much money had been rerouted to the 
 building of the palace, there was no civil organization or public work 
 that could care for them.

It was an astonishingly overwhelming experience, both 
 because of the grandeur and size (you really should look it up) and 
 because of the cost to human lives and the poverty it brought to 
 Romania. The country is still experiencing the consequences today.

Anyway, as the pastor who drove me to the palace 
 said, one eye is proud because of the greatness of the building, a 
 building that was built by Romanians. The other eye weeps because it 
 stole my childhood, and ruined the lives of thousands of Romanians, and 
 crippled our nation for years to come.

The history of a people plays into how they live and 
 worship. This is something that I am trying to understand as I worship 
 with and get to know our Romanian brothers and sisters. Continue to pray 
 for me as my Romanian journey continues. I continue to pray for the 
 church at Osco. Sorry to be so brief.

Blessings,
Doug

 

 May 23, 2011 
I left Chicago at 8:05 Saturday night. Thanks to Mike Betcher for 
 driving me to O&apos;Hare. Uneventful flight to London. Cold in London. Short time to catch flight to Bucharest but I made it. About a three 
 hour flight. Didn&apos;t get much sleep so was looking forward to a good 
 night&apos;s sleep. 

Cristi and Mirela Petriciou were waiting at Odepeni 
 airport near Bucharest. Hair raising drive into the capital city of 
 Bucharest, Romania. (I do see the humor in that!) Wonderful images of 
 parks, old magnificent buildings and ugly communist era buildings, 
 though not so many of them anymore. Arrived at Rin Grand Hotel, the 
 largest in Europe per their website. New four star hotel.

Went to eat at a Romanian fast food restaurant, 
 Spring Time. Odd that it has an English name. Good food. It was 
 located at the mall which is next door to the hotel. Pretty much like 
 American malls...

Will post more later...

La reverdere!
