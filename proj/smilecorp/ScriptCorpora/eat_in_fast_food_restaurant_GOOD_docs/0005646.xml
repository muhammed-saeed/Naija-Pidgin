 Trash Your Weak Goals 
By HTC ·Comments (40) 
 You seek a better life.

You are ambitious.

You are competitive.

You desire to get ahead at work.

You write down your goals and dreams.

You are motivated and ready to get to work.

 Now what? Review 

 Look at your goals and make them personal.  Trash your weak goals and instead make them matter. 

 
 

Our minds are powerful.  They can be our ally or our enemy if we do not pay close attention.   Our minds will allow us to fight through seemingly impossible situations and then trick us into easily giving up during a moment of weakness.  When do most people decide to put forth the effort, intensity and follow through necessary to accomplish their goals?  Sadly, the answer for most is when it is personally convenient.  Nothing worthwhile is convenient.

After you trash your weak goals, do these 3 things:

 Make your goals very detailed, specific and personal.  You have to “feel” your goals in your soul.  No one will put forth the necessary effort and energy for vague, nondescript goals. List the positive and negative consequences of not achieving your goals.  I make the consequences drastic.   I have noticed that if there is little to gain or lose, then I tend not to follow through. Get yourself fired up:  Failure is not an option.  I do not take the easy way out and quit.  This matters.  My future depends on this task. 

 

 Remember: Play now and pay later or pay now and play later. Either way, you will pay.

 Houston Texas Consulting Participates in 23rd Annual AIDS Walk Houston 2012 
By HTC ·Comments (99) 
 

The team from Houston Texas Consulting came together and participated in the 23rd annual AIDs Walk Houston. AIDS Walk Houston is an exciting, non-competitive event that increases community awareness and educates Houstonians about HIV/AIDS.

 http://www.aidshelp.org/site/TR?team_id=21060&amp;fr_id=1180&amp;pg=team 

AIDS Walk Houston 2012, presented by Marathon Oil, is a community-wide event that attracts thousands of Houstonians each year. The Walk is produced by AIDS Foundation Houston, Inc. and proceeds benefits local AIDS Service Organizations striving to make an impact in the fight against AIDS while providing vital social services to Houstonians living with HIV/AIDS.

AIDS Foundation Houston, Inc. (AFH) was founded in 1982 as Texas’ first organization dedicated to HIV education and services. The mission of AFH is to create positive social impact through the innovative management of HIV/AIDS and other chronic illnesses. AFH has steadily evolved from a grass-roots community agency to a professionally managed human services organization that provides many services including benefits and resources, counseling, case management, housing, food and nutrition assistance to low-income, HIV+ men, women, and children.

Houston Texas Consulting raised $960.00 to support the AIDS Foundation. From all of us here at HTC, we would like to express our thanks to all those that helped us support a great cause.

 Houston Texas Consulting reviews the book“The One Minute Manager” 
By HTC ·Comments (175) 
 
 The One Minute Manager 

by Kenneth Blanchard and Spencer Johnson

This book is a must read for anyone serious about helping others reach their potential. It is a simple read and can easily be consumed in an afternoon. Our favorite quote from this book:

 “The best minute you spend is the one you invest in people.” 

Here are the basics:

The One Minute Manager presents concepts such as developmental psychology, behavioral psychology, crisis intervention method, communication theory, goal-setting, and business transparency to illustrate three main concepts:

1. One Minute Goal Setting

2. One Minute Praising

3. One Minute Reprimands

 One Minute Goal Setting 

Team member submits one-minute, one-page set of goals.

1. Agree on his or her goals.

2. Discuss what good behavior looks like.

3. Tell people beforehand that you are going to let them know how they are doing and in no uncertain terms.

4. Agree that it might be uncomfortable but ultimately effective.

 One Minute Praising 

When a team member does something right they are immediately praised for a minute.

1. Praise people immediately.

2. Tell people what they did right, be specific.

3. Tell people how good you feel about what they did right, and how it helps the organization.

4. Stop for a moment of silence to let them feel how good you feel.

5. Encourage them to do more of the same.

6. Shake hands or touch people in a way that makes it clear that you support their success in the organization.

 One Minute Reprimands 

When a team member does something wrong they are to be reprimanded for a minute.

1. The first half of the reprimand: Reprimand people immediately.

2. Tell people what they did wrong, be specific.

3. Tell people how you feel about what they did wrong- and in no uncertain terms.

4. Stop for a few seconds of silence and let them feel how you feel.

5. The second half of the reprimand: Shake hands, or touch them in a way that lets them know you are honestly on their side.

6. Remind them how much you value them.

7. Reaffirm that you think well of them but not of their performance in this situation.

8. Realize that when the reprimand is over, it’s over.

 Discipline and Willpower Are Overrated 
By HTC ·Comments (180) 
Whoa!?! Discipline and willpower are overrated?  For most people, yes.  It is human nature to be an instant gratification junkie.  To be lazy, to seek comfort, to do what is convenient has become a habit for many.  We tend to have great intentions then do not follow through and conjure up great excuses.  I have caught myself doing this too many times. If you are like me and routinely find yourself doing things that do not align with your long term vision, then you probably are probably a little bit frustrated and need some help.

So I had to take a closer look at what was holding me back from the living a better life.  I wrongly assumed that discipline and willpower would be the answer.  Unfortunately, I am not that strong.  After I admit that I am not perfect and realize discipline and willpower are a weakness of mine, I follow a simple strategy. 

 

2 simple things you can do:

 Remove yourself immediately from an environment where it is easy to make poor decisions
 Prepare your environment with only good options from which to choose
 

 Want to stop smoking?  #1) Do not hang out with smokers #2) Throw away cigarettes and never buy again Want to stop watching endless TV at night?  #1) Remove the TV from your bedroom #2)  Put a book on your nightstand Want to stop eating fast food?  #1) Forbid yourself from driving into the parking lot of a fast food restaurant  #2) Pack your lunch Want to stop snacking on junk food? #1) Eat only at home #2) Throw away all junk food in your house Want to stop drinking?  #1) Stay away from bars, parties where alcohol is served #2)  Throw out all alcohol and replace with healthy beverages 

 This strategy will take some practice. These tactics may seem drastic to some.  But if you are serious about changing your behavior, then it is necessary. No one said it was easy.
 

Leave a comment and tell me what you do when discipline and willpower are not enough.

 Houston Texas Consulting Teams up with the Ronald McDonald House 
By HTC ·Comments (307) 
 Houston Texas Consulting began a “Wish List” drive for the Ronald McDonald House of Houston on Monday, January 2nd.

 http://www.rmhhouston.org 

 

 http://www.prweb.com/releases/houstontexasconsulting/htc_communityinvolvement 

Houston’s Ronald McDonald House offers loving, home-like environments, where families can find support and share experiences with others while on their journey to overcome a critical childhood illness. This mission has been the vision and driving force behind Houston’s Ronald McDonald House for more than three decades. Today that vision has grown to include:

 Holcombe House a freestanding 50-bedroom home for longer term stays House inside Texas Children’s Hospital (TCH) a home with 20 bedrooms House inside Children’s Memorial Hermann Hospital a home with 14 bedrooms Three Family Rooms inside TCH ”Cookie Corner”at M. D. Anderson Children’s Cancer Hospital 

When a critical illness strikes a child, the nearest treatment can be far from home in an unfamiliar medical center. The treatment likely requires long periods of hospitalization and extended periods of hospital-based therapy. The only solution for many families is to leave their home, friends and family behind in order to remain at their child’s side and stay as close to the hospital as possible.

However, no health insurance plan has ever covered the additional expense of food and lodging while living far from home. Nor do they accommodate the special emotional needs of fearful parents and confused siblings. The best solution is to offer families a home away from home where they could be a family again, and enjoy a little privacy as well as the support of others experiencing a similarly anxious time.

Houston Texas Consulting supports the Ronald McDonald House’s vision that every child and family dealing with a critical illness will have a place they can stay and be close with their family during the hardship of dealing with the illnesses. The team at Houston Texas Consulting hopes to send boxes to the Ronald McDonald House overflowing!

Houston Texas Consulting collected the items below that are part of the Ronald McDonald House “Wish List” and are in continuous use, and are necessary for the daily operation of“The House That Love Built.”

 Individually packaged breakfast items such as muffins, Danishes, POP Tarts and breakfast bars, cereal, oatmeal Individually packaged snacks such as granola bars, crackers, chips, pretzels, cookies, gummie snacks, candy and popcorn Fruit–Fresh or individual servings Tuna lunch kits Coffee–regular Sugar Packets Microwaveable soups – individual servings Paper Products (paper towels, toilet paper, tissue, paper plates/cups, trash bags, etc.) Shower essentials Disinfecting Products: Hand Sanitizer, Lysol Wipes and Spray Dishwashing and Laundry Detergent Houston Zoo passes Houston Museum of Natural Science passes 

Houston Texas Consulting made a donation of over 280lbs of the “Wish List” essentials and necessities. We will continue to donate throughout the year and be a continuous supporter of the Ronald McDonald House of Houston.

 3 Words That Will Change Your Life 
By HTC ·Comments (204) 
 

 STOP, START&amp;CONTINUE 

Have you ever felt lost?  Have you ever felt like you were on track to hitting your goals only to find yourself stuck in the mud spinning your wheels and not knowing how to get out? I know I have.  Countless times…  Three words have made a huge difference in my life:  STOP, START&amp;CONTINUE.

Decide what you want then keep it simple.

 Simple instructions: 

 List 2 things you must stop doing List 2 things you must start doing List 2 things you must continue doing 

 

Do not over think this.  Just pick two actions for each.  Then focus on those actions for the next seven days.  Nothing more, nothing less.  With this exercise you will simply identify what is holding you back (STOP), what you must do (START) and lastly, what you are doing well (CONTINUE).  Talk to your mentor or someone you trust.  Ask for his or her input to correctly identify where your focus should be.   Finally, ask them to hold you accountable to do these things.  Ask them to give honest and timely feedback.

 Balance 
By HTC ·Comments (217) 
 

It has long been assumed that anyone can find problems but it takes REAL talent to find solutions. A solid, healthy relationship with employees, employers, clients, coworkers, friends and family require us to be BOTH a problem finder and a problem solver.

Problem finders sometimes get labeled as negative and complainers. Problem solvers often get labeled as rigid and poor listeners. While both statements have merit, it could be argued that a person must be BOTH a problem finder and a problem solver to be a critical component of a relationship. To reach our potential, we must find a healthy balance.

Here are four simple ways to balance being a problem “finder” and a problem “solver”:

1.) Remember: If you do not know what you want from a situation, and you cannot offer any solutions then you are just complaining. No one likes complainers.

2.) Stop and listen to the person speaking before you cut them off, jump right in and try to solve a problem. Sometimes people just want you to listen.

3.) Slow down, notice what your emotions are telling you to do and act according to how you want to behave. You decide.

4.)  For every problem you notice, “find” three things that are going great. This will keep you level.

 Houston Texas Consulting Adopts a Family for the Holidays 
By HTC ·Comments (174) 
 

 

Houston Texas Consulting has joined forces with the Houston Children’s Charity for their annual Adopt-A-Family program. The Adopt-A-Family program aids families going through hardships during the holiday season. Through this program, organizations, such as Houston Texas Consulting, are afforded the opportunity to assist local families and offer gifts of hope, encouragement, and caring to those needing it most.

 

The team at Houston Texas Consulting sponsored a local family of three by purchasing Christmas presents and gift cards for, not only the kids, but also the parents to enjoy this holiday season. Houston Texas Consulting has taken great pride in being able to help a local family in need, especially around the holidays.

 

Although the family remains anonymous, the experience was a reminder to the team at Houston Texas Consulting about the spirit of the holidays. The team hopes the family enjoyed their time together opening the gifts and celebrating. Houston Texas Consulting looks forward to adopting another family next year.

 Press Release 

 

About Houston Children’s Charity:

Houston Children’s Charity is a non-profit organization dedicated to improving the quality of life for Greater Houston’s underprivileged, abused and disabled children who have been otherwise left behind.

Through an array of capital programs and operating support Houston Children’s Charity has provided $6.8 Million to program services for over 75 agencies. In addition, the Becker Emergency Fund has provided over $60,000 to assist families in an emergency crisis situation.

 2012: Your Best Year Ever 
By HTC ·Comments (189) 
 

 

Take a few minutes, ok maybe thirty, and go to a quiet place where you will not be disturbed. This is harder than you think, especially around the holidays. Take out a pencil and paper, think about the following questions and just start writing.

 

1.) What 5 things do I like about my personal life?

 

2.) What 5 things do I like about my business life?

 

3.) What one thing would I like to see happen in 2012 in regards to my relationships, health, finances, soul and mind? Or any other part of your life. Then choose one thing per each category.

 

4.) What one, simple thing will I commit to do every day, for each of those subjects, to make 2012 my best year ever?

 

Life is too short to always focus on the things you want to change or do not like in your life. Instead, be grateful for what you have and notice where you want to be.

 

Pick one thing to do daily to get you closer to your goals.

The joy is in the process.

 The G.I.F.T. of Competition 
By HTC ·Comments (199) 
 

 G oals: Competition is defined by goals. The goals you choose are critical to harnessing the power of competition. Having a goal sets the stage for competition, regardless of whom you are competing against. Consider your goals from the perspective of how they stoke your competitiveness.

 I ntent: Your intent will determine how you compete. If your intent is to win at all costs, your behaviors will be different than if you want to do your best, or improve since your last effort. If my intent in a race is only to win, my thoughts and behaviors will be different than if my intent is to improve on past performance.

 F ocus: Who are you competing against? Think carefully about who the competition really is before ramping up your competitive juices. View yourself, others, other teams and other companies as your competition. There is nothing wrong with internal competition, just make sure the focus is on overall goal achievement, not just winning for the sake of winning.

 T imeline: Where do you place the finish line? Do you consider it winning only when you reach a life-long major goal, or can you revel in and celebrate small wins along the way? Where you place the finish line determines how often you can win. While you can have the long-term, big, competitive aspirations, you must set many smaller, intermediate opportunities to win along the way.
