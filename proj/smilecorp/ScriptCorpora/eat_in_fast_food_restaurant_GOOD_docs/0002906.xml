 Listening to the Web the wrong way 

Information Week has a great article on sentiment analysis. I got the link via Seth Grimes. He is the greatest cheerleader for the industry and does a magnificent job. He is smart, smooth, well spoken and a great MC at conferences. I’m the dark, polar-opposite of him. I’m the one who speaks up and says your baby [...]
 
 From Text to Truth 

Or: What we can learn from crowdsourcing Text Analytics can learn a lot from a competing system for getting answers to analytical-like questions. Crowdsourcing is a voluntary effort where collaboration to solve a problem is key. Text analytics is a sort of involuntary collaboration of multiple voices gathered together in a corpus. How do these compare and what [...]
 
 Defeating Misinformation with Community and Data Centralization 

Hoaxers and Misinformation are problems for modern Intelligence platforms–problems that can be solved through collaboration. I spent years helping build analytical tools for the military. One key development in the Intelligence community was the recognition that putting many analysts on really tough problems can solve them quicker. The approach was called Swarming and [...]

About Nectarine Imp
 
Nectarine Imp is Peter Mancini. That&apos;s me. It has been said I go from conversational to esoteric in about 30 seconds. That makes me a bit opaque at times. However once I know you are lost I can use one of my strengths which is to make technically hard issues intelligible.
 
As a technologist I am always looking to solve problems from the experience of the person facing them.I will bring my understanding of what technology brings to bear given the nature of any problem or difficult workflow experience. I will figure out how technology can improve that process.
 
I&apos;ve spent years working with both civilian and government to help them solve big data problems. Finding the so-called pain points and working to ease them has great benefit for nearly any organization. Let me help you take advantage of the new revolution in analytical tools.
 
I am also the inventor of Dynamic Sentiment Understanding, a new way of looking at sentiment in language. This technology differs vastly from what is currently in the market today. It takes the conversation and divides it up by groups. It looks at the conversations the groups are having on topics and discovers the distance between them. There is no reliance on determining an artificial and arbitrary sentiment score of a particular word, or document. It looks for effective sentiment. Contact me for more details.
