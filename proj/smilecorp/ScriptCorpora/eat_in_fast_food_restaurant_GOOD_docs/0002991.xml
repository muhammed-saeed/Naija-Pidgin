Dunkin&apos;Donuts to unveil prototype
 By James Chen 
The Dunkin’Donuts of the future has arrived in Cleveland. Company officials announced the opening of the company’s second prototype store, one with a greatly expanded menu and a more casual environment.
 
?Ǩ?This is the Dunkin?ǨѢ of the future,?Ǩ said Randy Brashier, Dunkin?ǨѢs vice president of new concept development, as a few dozen employees and company trainers buzzed about on Wednesday morning testing equipment and procedures. The store will employ 60 workers.

While the breakfast menu also is getting some new additions such as breakfast pizza and biscuit-wrapped sausage links, the big changes come when the menu board flips to its afternoon offerings. That?ǨѢs where you?ǨѢll find bite-size pastries with those fillings that don?ǨѢt seem to belong anywhere near a donut.

But Stan Frankenthaler, Dunkin?ǨѢs executive chef, said the new items began first and foremost as an extension of Dunkin?ǨѢs strengths. ?Ǩ?If we surround these fillings with a really great dough ?Ǩ that really speaks to a quality baking tradition,?Ǩ Mr. Frankenthaler said. ?Ǩ?What went inside them came second.?Ǩ

The 1,900-square-foot store?ǨѢs architecture also is a departure from Dunkin?ǨѢs traditionally utilitarian layouts. The open floor plan offers a view of the kitchen and ovens, evoking what Dunkin?ǨѢ director of concept development Jimmy Fitzgerald calls a ?Ǩ?big industrial bakery feel.?Ǩ And the eating area is designed to feel more like a casual coffee place than a fast-food restaurant.
 
The bottom line appears to be that Dunkin’Donuts expansion plans for the US will take it in head-to-head competition with rivals such as McDonalds and Starbucks.
