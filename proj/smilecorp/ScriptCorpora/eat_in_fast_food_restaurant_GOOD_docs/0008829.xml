 Most played song at weddings revealed as Black Eyed Peas hit 
 April 24th, 2012 by admin 
 A recent survey into the most played songs at wedding receptions has revealed that the Black Eyed Peas hit record, I Gotta Feeling, is the most popular choice for brides and grooms in the UK beating the usual cheesy tunes more typically associated with weddings to clinch the number one spot.

Digital music service, Spotify, studied 78,000 wedding playlists as part of their quest to track down the country’s most popular wedding song. While the usual offenders including Abba’s Dancing Queen and the Jackson 5’s Blame it on the Boogie all appeared in the top 20 most played wedding songs, the results signal a definite shift towards modern hits as brides and grooms look to shun the golden oldie hits.

While Black Eyed Peas with I Gotta Feeling came in at number one on the Spotify wedding playlist top 20, in at number two was another up tempo number, Sex on Fire from The Kings of Leon, followed by The Killers and Mr Brightside at number three.

The reigning queen of the ballads, Adele, did appear in the top 20 list, coming in at number 10 with her cover of the Bob Dylan classic, To Make You Feel My Love, however former wedding favourites such as Celine Dion and Mariah Carey failed to appear in the list at all. Beyoncé appears in the Spotify list twice but it’s her up tempo hits which are favoured on the wedding playlist with Single Ladies and Crazy in Love both featuring.

Celebrity DJ and a regular on the wedding circuit, DJ Sam Young, believes that couples these days are more concerned with throwing a great party for their guests hence the popularity of party tunes such as I Gotta Feeling in wedding playlists.

Spotify also noted that 70% of wedding playlists are compiled by men; so ladies, are you handing over the reins to your other half when it comes to creating your wedding playlist? Let us know your plans for music at your wedding reception and see if any of your choices appear in the Spotify top 20 most popular wedding songs below.

 Carey Mulligan’s Secret wedding to Jason Mumford 
 April 23rd, 2012 by admin 
 Oscar nominated actress Carey Mulligan married Mumford and Sons frontman, musician Jason Mumford, in a secret wedding in Somerset over the weekend. The Brit actress tied the knot in a low key ceremony conducted by the groom’s own father, who just happens to be a vicar.

While the wedding itself is reported to have been a rustic affair, taking place in a converted barn in rural Somerset, the wedding guest list was far from low key with a number of A list celebrities including Colin Firth, Sienna Miller and Jake Gyllenhaal all believed to have attended the nuptials.

The bride is thought to have worn a backless ivory gown with v-neck straps, rumoured to have been designed by Versace. The blushing bride was accompanied down the aisle by eight bridesmaids all dressed in turquoise knee length gowns with matching shoes.

Actress Carey and musician Jason got engaged last August after a 5-month whirlwind romance. Prior to dating the Mumford and Sons singer, the 26-year-old actress was romantically linked to fellow Hollywood actor, Jake Gyllenhaal, who reportedly attended the wedding over the weekend proving the former couple are on good terms.

It’s understood that Oscar winning actor, Colin Firth, had the guests in fits of laughter with his speech, while Grammy winner Adele provided the musical entertainment and world famous photographer Rankin was in charge of the wedding snaps – now that’s what we’d call a dream wedding line up!

 Obama congratulates Scottish couple on golden wedding anniversary 
 April 13th, 2012 by admin 
 A Scottish couple were bowled over when they received a message of congratulations on their golden wedding anniversary from none other than the President of the United States, Barack Obama.

Jan and Eddie Black from Cardenden in Fife were celebrating 50 years of married life surrounded by their family and friends this week when they discovered that one of the many presents given to them to mark the occasion was in fact a framed message from President Obama. The gift was wrapped and placed amongst all of the couple’s other presents which made the surprise all the greater when they finally opened it.

The extra special gift came from the couple’s son, Steven, who has been living in Georgia, USA for the last 20 years. Steve’s wife wrote to the governor to arrange the wedding anniversary message from the president. The framed messages are usually reserved for American citizens, however it seems the White House made an exception in the case of Jan and Eddie Black who’ve lived their entire married life in Fife.

The framed message from Obama, which bears the official stamp of The White House, reads, “An enduring marriage like yours is truly golden”. 70-year-old Eddie and 68-year-old Jan said receiving the personal message from the president “topped off” their 50 th wedding anniversary celebrations.

 Wedding venue bribe claims rubbished by Christine Bleakley 
 April 12th, 2012 by admin 
 Claims that TV presenter Christine Bleakley and her Chelsea footballer fiancé Frank Lampard offered money to two sets of brides and grooms to get them to move their wedding day at their chosen venue have been rubbished by the former One Show host.

The bribe reports first emerged over the weekend in a number of Irish newspapers. It was claimed that the Northern Irish born TV presenter and the footballer had offered one couple planning to marry at Galgorm Manor wedding venue £100,000 to change their date, while the celebrity couple were also accused of offering to pay off another bride and groom-to-be’s mortgage in exchange for switching the date of their big day at another wedding venue, Dromoland Castle in County Clare.

However the Dancing on Ice presenter, who got engaged to footballer Frank Lampard while on holiday last June, has spoken out to vehemently deny the claims. The 33-year-old said she wouldn’t “in a million years” ask anyone to move their wedding date to accommodate her own plans. Speaking in a newspaper interview, the brunette TV presenter added that these types of reports are upsetting as they paint her as a “horrible person.”

After pouring cold water on the wedding venue bribe claims, the bride-to-be revealed she isn’t well prepared for her big day, adding that she has no set plans in place. The TV star said she’s keen to just have a low key wedding and isn’t obsessed with the tiny details.

No wedding date for Christine Bleakley and Frank Lampard’s wedding has been revealed, however it’s rumoured the couple will marry sometime this summer.

 Ricki Lake walks downs the aisle for the second time 
 April 11th, 2012 by admin 
 Chat show host, Ricki Lake has walked down the aisle for the second time, despite vowing she’d never marry again after her ten year marriage to artist Rob Sussman ended in 2003. However the 43-year-old TV personality has found love again and married Christian Evans on Sunday in a secret ceremony in South California.

While the mother-of-two remained tight lipped about her plans to marry in the lead up to the big day, Ricki Lake has since broken her silence on the subject of her second wedding, even posting a picture on Twitter of herself in her wedding dress. The snap shows the TV host wearing what looks like a chiffon wedding gown with cascading ruffles. The bride is seen looking out of a window carrying a bridal bouquet bursting with deep pink blooms.

 Speaking in an exclusive magazine interview, Ricki Lake revealed she wasn’t at all nervous at the prospect of tying the knot a second time, in fact the former Dancing With The Stars contestant said she felt “relaxed and excited” before exchanging vows with 40-year-old Christian Evans.

Ricki and Christian got engaged last August dating for just over a year. It’s understood Christian got down on one knee while the couple were holidaying in Spain.

The actress and TV host confirmed the news of her recent marriage on Twitter writing, “It’s official and I am so happy!”

 X Factor’s Ray Quinn marries former West End co-star 
 April 10th, 2012 by admin 
 X Factor 2006 runner-up, Ray Quinn, has tied the knot with his former West End co-star in a romantic beach wedding in Barbados. The 23-year-old from Liverpool wed Emma Stephens who he first met when the pair were starring together in London’s West End in the hit musical Grease.

An interview and exclusive photographs from the wedding are due to be published in a glossy magazine this week. The Dancing on Ice winner reveals all about his romantic proposal on Christmas Day, and also spills the beans about the happy couple’s special news.

Ray Quinn and his bride Emma Stephens revealed on their wedding day that they are set to become parents this summer, with singer and actress Emma due to give birth to the couple’s first child in July.

One photograph from the musical star’s big day has been released and shows the Liverpudlian and his blonde bride exchanging vows in a beach ceremony in Barbados, with just a hint of a bump visible under the bride’s flowing one shouldered white gown.

The couple flew seven of their closet family members out to Barbados for the intimate beach wedding. Ray proposed to his now-wife on a beach on Christmas Day 2010, presenting her with a diamond Tiffany engagement ring, so it seemed fitting for the pair to finally tie the knot in a seaside ceremony; what better location for a beach wedding than the Caribbean?!

 Jay-Z spotted shopping for fourth wedding anniversary gift for wife Beyonce 
 April 5th, 2012 by admin 
 Rap star and music producer, Jay-Z, was spotted shopping at a luxury jewellers in New York this week where he is believed to have purchased a special gift to mark his fourth wedding anniversary with wife Beyonce.

The 42-year-old was seen hugging the owner of the exclusive jewellers, Jacob Arabo, before hopping into a waiting chauffeur driven car. It’s understood the international music star was visiting the New York jewellers to view their range of rare blue diamond gems known as Lumina. The jewellery store is renowned for creating extravagant designs for celebrities with a single piece costing upwards of $10,000.

The light blue coloured precious stone, Topaz, is often associated with fourth year wedding anniversaries so Jay-Z’s choice of a rare blue diamond is a perfect, and also lavish, choice of gift.

The couple are due to celebrate their fourth wedding anniversary this week, however it seems Jay-Z is pulling out all the stops on this anniversary as the number 4 is special to the celebrity pair. Both Beyonce and Jay-Z have their birthdays on the fourth of the month, and the Roman numeral for four, lV, inspired the name of their baby daughter, Blue Ivy.

Beyonce and Jay-Z married in secret at their New York home in April 2008, although the singer not being photographed wearing her wedding ring until that September. There have been reports that the high profile couple are planning to renew their wedding vows, prompting speculation that Jay-Z may have been shopping for a new engagement ring especially for the vow renewal at Jacob Arabo’s jewellery store this week.

 Madame Tussauds recreate Kate and William’s engagement announcement 
 April 4th, 2012 by admin 
 World renowned London attraction, Madame Tussauds, have today unveiled their latest addition to their waxwork model collection. Arguably the most high profile couple in the world, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, are the latest famous faces to be created into life size waxwork models, with Madame Tussauds choosing to recreate the couple’s engagement announcement from November 2010 for the display.

The two waxwork models, which cost £150,000 each, were painstakingly created by a team of designers who spent months perfecting the finished articles. It’s understood that Kate and William were kept informed on the progress of their waxworks at every juncture.

Madame Tussauds have recreated the outfits worn by the royal couple when they announced their plans back in 2010. The Kate Middleton model wears the now iconic navy coloured Issa dress. The fashion house behind the dress made a replica especially for the waxwork model. A replica sapphire and diamond engagement ring, which once belonged William’s mother Princess Diana, has also been created especially for the display, while Prince William’s Gieves and Hawks navy two piece suit was recreated especially for his model.

The waxwork couple are expected to be one of the main attractions at the Madame Tussauds Royal Zone where other waxwork models on display include her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Harry, and also the late Princess Diana.

The timing of the launch of the new Duke and Duchess of Cambridge waxwork models couldn’t have been better as the royal couple will celebrate their first wedding anniversary at the end of this month.

 Move over wedding rings, the divorce ring makes its debut 
 April 3rd, 2012 by admin 
 We’ve heard of divorce parties, but divorce rings to celebrate the newly single status of a woman is a new one on us, however one jewellery designer is hoping her designs for women who want to commemorate their new relationship status will tap into a whole new market.

The rings are worn in place of a wedding band and take their inspiration from traditional wedding and marriage symbols, but with a dark twist. One of the divorce rings designed by Gisele Ganne, priced from £850, mixes symbols we’d associate with love and marriage, including a bride’s bouquet and pink delicate gems combined with a bird’s skull.

While the end of a marriage is an obviously painful and upsetting time, for some women, a divorce is a liberating experience if the marriage was a particularly unhappy one. Replacing their wedding rings which may symbolise negativity with a different type of ring to mark their departure from their role as a wife, to independent woman is something to be celebrated and embraced, some parties have argued.

Recent statistics revealed that 42% of marriages in the UK end in divorce, with the recent downturn in the economy being blamed for putting an extra strain on marriages and being a contributing factor in many divorces. With such a large proportion of marriages sadly ending in divorce, Gisele Ganne may well have hit upon a growing new trend with the introduction of her divorce rings, and also divorce knuckledusters for those going through a particularly bitter breakup.

 Heavily pregnant Jessica Simpson performs bridesmaid duties for pal’s wedding 
 March 30th, 2012 by admin 
 Despite being nine months pregnant and about to give birth any day, pop star turned fashion designer, Jessica Simpson, dressed up in a flowing bridesmaid gown and walked down the aisle as part of her friend and former assistant’s bridal party last weekend.

The 31-year-old, who’s a bride-to-be herself and due to be married to ex-footballer Eric Johnson after their baby arrives, was helped down the aisle by her fiancé. The singer wore a floor length halterneck style bridesmaid dress which featured a pastel coloured pattern.

Also involved in the bridal party was Jessica’s 27-year-old sister, Ashlee Simpson and her son Bronx who had the very important role of ring bearer during the ceremony. The Simpson sisters dressed in matching bridesmaid dresses looked on as their close friend and former assistant, Lauren Zelman, married TV actor Bret Harrison in a romantic ceremony in sunny Palm Springs, California.

Ashlee and Jessica Simpson were two of the eight bridesmaids for the California wedding of their friend. A source revealed that despite being heavily pregnant, the 31-year-old fashion designer and singer was a “good sport” about being a bridesmaid, although she did find it difficult getting around and trying to help the bride-to-be and doing all of the usual duties required of bridesmaids.

 Woman gets hitched to herself 
 October 26th, 2010 by admin 
Woman opts to marry herself due to mounting social pressure
 
A Taiwanese woman has been making headlines across the world after revealing her plans to get married, to herself.

At 30 years old, the average age for women to settle down and tie the knot, Chen Wei-Yih was starting to feel the pressure. Although the office worker is extremely happy with her lot in terms of her career and social life, when it comes to love it’s another matter entirely.

Having not met “the one” and with the social pressure building to get hitched, Chen decided to take radical action.

The bride-to-be set to work organising her own wedding hiring a wedding planner, booking a reception venue and shopping for the all-important dress, however one crucial element will be missing from this wedding; the groom.

Chen says she’s not against marriage in any way, and that she would consider marrying a partner in the future. The Taiwanese woman says she hopes her self-marriage will encourage more single men and women to love themselves, and not feel pressurised into marriage once they reach a certain age.

The office worker, who’s shelling out $3,700 for her wedding, has even started an online campaign in the lead up to the big day which has won her fans from across the globe who share Chen’s views on marriage and feel inspired by her act.

Chen’s marriage to herself will be a symbolic one as it is not legally possible to marry yourself.

30 wedding guests have been invited to share Chen’s big day. The newlywed is also planning a honeymoon to Australia.

 No Girls Aloud at Nadine Coyle’s wedding 
 October 21st, 2010 by admin 
Reports suggest Nadine won&apos;t be inviting her Girls Aloud band mates to her big day
 
Girls Aloud singer Nadine Coyle has reported banished the rest of her band mates from her forthcoming nuptials.

The Irish singer is due to tie the knot with Jason Bell on June 15 th next year. The date was chosen as it’s Nadine’s 26 th birthday. The couple are due to exchange their vows in New York, with a venue in Manhattan chosen to host the big event as the pair enjoyed several early dates in this area of the city.

After the Big Apple wedding, the newlyweds are planning to jet back to Ireland where they’ll throw a big party to celebrate their happy occasion with all of Nadine’s family and friends who won’t be able to make it to the actual wedding in America. Once all the celebrations are over, the pair are planning to honeymoon in Paris.

According to a source close to the singer, Nadine isn’t planning to invite the other members of Girls Aloud as she doesn’t want anything to detract from her big day. Earlier in the year there were press reports that cracks were beginning to emerge within the group and Nadine has distanced herself from the rest of her band mates.

Although Cheryl Cole, Kimberly Walsh, Nicola Roberts and Sarah Harding haven’t made the guest list at Nadine’s big day, interestingly Spice Girl Mel B and socialite Lady Victoria Hervey have.

 Hen party saves man’s life 
 October 20th, 2010 by admin 
The bride-to-be from Cumbria celebrated her hen do in Magaluf
 
A hen party from Cumbria certainly got more than they bargained for when they set off to celebrate the last weekend of freedom of nurse Lyndsey Wojcik last month.

The gaggle of girls flew out to the renowned holiday hot spot in Spain to celebrate the bride-to-be’s forthcoming nuptials. However just a few hours into the hen party, things took a turn for the worse.

The hen party were enjoying the sunshine and sangria in their hotel pool when a fellow holiday maker, an elderly man from Holland, jumped in the pool and appeared to be experiencing some difficulties.

It was at this point that the hen party from Cumbria, several of whom are trained cardiac nurses, recognised the signs and realised the man was having a heart attack.

After pulling the man from the water, the three administered mouth to mouth resuscitation along with chest compressions and inserted an airway. Thanks to the quick thinking actions of the hens, the man’s breathing came back, and he regained consciousness.

The man was discharged from hospital several days later, and was quick to seek out the hen party and in particular the “angels” who saved his life. If the nurses hadn’t been there to administer the first aid immediately, it might have been a completely different story.

While most hens come home from a wild weekend away with tales of drunken fun, not many can boast saving a person’s life while celebrating a hen do!

 Prince William and Kate Middleton to finally make it down the aisle in 2011 
 October 19th, 2010 by admin 
Will Prince William and Kate Middleton finally make it up the aisle next August?
 
According to recent reports, the Prince William and Kate Middleton will finally tie the knot in 2011 bringing an end to the “will they, won’t they” saga which has plagued the couple for the last year.

A senior palace source has reportedly confirmed that wedding plans are in full swing, although the official announcement of the engagement isn’t due until early next year, with the nuptials due to take place during the summer.

It is thought 3 dates during July and August have been earmarked for the big day and the Queen is expected to declare the day a national holiday.

The couple got together in 2001 when they met while studying at university in St Andrews. Although a source revealed the Prince would have liked to have waited until his mid-thirties before tying the knot, he realises he can’t keep Kate waiting any longer. The 28-year-old has already been dubbed Waity Katy by the press because of the length of time she’s been dating the Prince.

Speculation is already mounting over who the bride will choose to design the all-important dress. It’s believed Kate will opt for a British designer with names such as Bruce Oldfield, Vivienne Westwood, Amanda Wakely and Jenny Packham all being mentioned as possible contenders for the role.

The Royal Mint will also prepare a special coin to mark the Royal wedding date.

2011 has been chosen for the much anticipated wedding as the following year would have been too hectic as London is hosting the Olympics, plus the Queen is due to celebrate her Golden Jubilee in 2012.

 It wasn’t a wedding, it was a blessing says Kate Moss 
 October 18th, 2010 by admin 
Kate Moss&apos;s secret&quot;wedding&quot;was in fact, a blessing
 
It wasn’t a wedding, but a blessing. That’s Kate Moss’s reaction to the newspaper reports which emerged last week claiming the supermodel has married her boyfriend Jamie Hince in a church ceremony in Sicily this summer.

The 36-year-old model did walk down the aisle in August this year in a church in Italy, however the ceremony performed on the big day was a spiritual blessing for their relationship, and not a conventional wedding.

The Croydon born model was so determined to keep the ceremony private that she didn’t even invite her long time best pal, and the woman who introduced her to Kills’ rocker Hince, Sadie Frost.

Only a very select number of close friends were invited to the secret blessing as Kate’s number one priority was to keep the event under wraps from the press.

Although the couple may have demonstrated their commitment to each other with the spiritual ceremony in Sicily, the blessing is not legally binding in any way, meaning if the pair split, Kate’s estimated fortune of £48 million will be completely safe.

Many people are drawing parallels between Kate Moss’s spiritual blessing, and Hindi ceremony The Rolling Stones front man, Mick Jagger, had with this then partner Jerry Hall 30 years ago. 9 year after Mick and Jerry made their commitment to each other through the Hindi blessing, The Stones singer had the marriage annulled.

 Is Kate Moss Married? 
 October 15th, 2010 by admin 
Kate Moss and Jamie Hince got engaged in January, but have they made it down the aisle yet?
 
Conflicting stories have hit the press today regarding the marital status of supermodel Kate Moss. One tabloid is reporting that the 36-year-old wed boyfriend Jamie Hince in an Italian wedding in July, while another newspaper claims a source close to the model has spoken out to rubbish the marriage rumour.

So what’s the truth? Kate Moss and her partner of 3 years, guitarist Jamie Hince, have been seen out in public wearing matching wedding bands as recently as this week. The model was also spotted wearing a ring on her wedding finger while on holiday in Italy this summer, the same holiday during which one newspaper claims she tied the knot.

It’s been reported that the catwalk queen walked down the aisle barefoot in a see-through white gown in a church in Sicily in late July of this year. According to the report, only close friends were in attendance, and the model’s young daughter, Lila Grace, acted as one of the ring bearers. After the ceremony the locals also joined in the celebrations on the sun soaked island.

However a rival paper claims they’ve spoken directly to an employee of Kate Moss who says that any story which states the model has married The Kills guitarist is “factually incorrect.”

The couple did visit Tuscany and the Aeolian islands during the summer for a two-week holiday. The pair got engaged in January of this year when Hince popped the question on Moss’s 36 th birthday.

So it seems the “did she? Didn’t she?” saga will continue unless the model speaks out personally to either confirm or deny the rumours.

 McDonalds weddings launched in Hong Kong 
 October 14th, 2010 by admin 
From next January couples in Hong Kong will able to tie the knot in selected McDonalds restaurants
 
Not content with dominating the fast food industry the world over, McDonalds now has its sights set on breaking into the wedding business by offering wedding packages at selected restaurants in Hong Kong.

According to some reports, the idea to offer weddings at the well known fast food chain came about after one couple in Hong Kong, who’d met at a specific restaurant, requested to hold their wedding there. Other engaged couples heard about the novel idea, and soon McDonalds were receiving up to 10 calls a month asking for weddings to be held in their restaurants.

For many couples McDonalds has a special significance as they may have met in a restaurant, had their first date in McDonalds or have got engaged at the fast food restaurant, therefore the idea is already proving popular with brides and grooms in Hong Kong who are looking for a wedding venue which is personal to them.

It’s also a great option for couples on a budget as McDonalds wedding packages are priced at between HK$ 2000-3000 (€185-278). Guests will be able to order off the set menu for the wedding breakfast, and McDonalds will even provide a wedding cake, either of the apple pie or burger variety. On the downside however, all toasts will be alcohol-free, and your wedding party may be looked on by strangers as McDonalds won’t be closing the restaurant down for your nuptials.

Bookings for McWeddings in Hong Kong are already being taken from January 2011 onwards.

On the same day that David Schwimmer revealed he and his long-term partner have tied the knot, his Friends co-star, Courtney Cox announced that she and her husband of 11 years, David Arquette, have decided to have a trial separation.

The 46-year-old actress and 39-year-old actor released a joint statement which confirmed they have decided to have a trial separation. In the statement the pair state that they are still “best friends” and “love each other deeply” however they have decided to take time away from each other to try to better “understand themselves and their relationship.”

The couple have a 6-year-old daughter, Coco, and say they are committed to remaining “responsible parents” to their young child. In the joint statement it was revealed that the couple have been separated for some time.

Courtney and David met in 1996 when they appeared alongside each other in the popular Scream movies, they married 3 years later in San Francisco.

In the past Courtney has admitted that she and her husband have attended couple’s therapy to try and work through their issues. Earlier this year David was photographed without his wedding ring.

Ironically, the pair have just finished working on the fourth of the Scream film, the movie which brought them together 13 years ago. The movie is due out next year.

After the news broke of the couple’s trial separation, Courtney Cox was seen leaving her Los Angeles home on her way to the studios where her new hit series, Cougar Town, is filmed.
