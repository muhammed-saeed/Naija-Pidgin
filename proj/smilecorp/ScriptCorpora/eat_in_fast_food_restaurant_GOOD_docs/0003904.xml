 Lifestyle Changes = Prevention Week 2 
 Posted on July 19, 2011 by kalenutrition 
Stop obsessing about the number on the scale and set yourself up for success!  I have had a great week and I contribute it to putting a few strategies in place.  Really this could have been a difficult week with family visiting, road trips and lazy hot days on the patio but really it was a fantastic week and all because I didn’t stress and I’m not dieting just incorporating a few changes.

 Weight Loss Tips

 Weight Loss Tips 

 Gently shift into a new lifestyle – Take it slow, gently shift into your new lifestyle and remember diets are temporary measures and often appear to have results while “ ON ” the diet but the weight is usually gained back when “ OFF ” the diet.  Incorporating lifestyle changes that can be maintained allows for long term success and weight management.  A new study from University of Pennsylvania shows that, dieting constantly with yo-yo results may cause changes in their brain that set them up to eat more when stressed. Eat breakfast with in an hour of waking – “We need to break the fast from the previous night. After sleeping for 7 to 8 hours we need to give our metabolism a boost and rev up our fat burning ability.  Let’s think about it, if your last meal was at 8 or 9 pm before bed and you don’t eat until lunch at noon were talking about 16 hours of running on empty.  We need glucose for our brain and nervous system to work and when we don’t supply it our body goes in search of it finding stored carbohydrates or it tries to turn fat into glucose. Eat 5 – 6 small meals per day – why eat 5 or 6 small meals spaced out though out the day?  Doing so can help with eating smaller portion which research has shown that those who eat only two or three large meals a day tend to eat more calories than people who eat five of six meals per day.  This might be because when you eat at say 8 am and then not again until noon you become so hungry that you eat more calories to help you feel full. Powerful Protein – Include protein in each meal and snack most of us don’t eat enough protein.  Protein stabilizes blood sugar; it is the most satisfying nutrient which helps to stop hunger and cravings and is a powerful metabolism booster.  Protein is the building blocks for every cell in our body and is used for growth and daily function. Fat friend or foe – there are good fats and bad fats but the good fats (EFA’s essential fatty acids) are essential, which means our body cannot manufacture them so we need to get them through our diet.  Essential fatty acids help to stimulate hormone production, healthy skin, and transport fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin D.   Deficiency can lead to health issues such as rheumatoid arthritis, eczema, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, high triglycerides, asthma, diabetes, depression and others. Incorporate a food journal – there are so many benefits to keeping a food journal.  It can help to create awareness of your habits, emotions with food and accountability.  Food journaling can also help if you’re working with a nutritionist, physician, clinicians and or other professional see triggers or habits that may be contributing to your weight gain. Become aware of what you are eating – read the labels.  Know what your putting into your mouth, in your body.  A good rule of thumb is if you can’t   pronounce it   don’t eat it and remember that ingredients go from highest to lowest so for example if sugar is the first ingredients it is the highest ingredient in that food. Keep hydrated – the amount of water is really dependent on your weight. About 1.5 lt a day and 1 lt for every hour of exercise that you do.  Remember black tea, coffee and juices don’t count towards water consumption as they dehydrate you (herbal tea is ok). E xercise – get moving; remember to do activities you like.  If you don’t like to running you won’t continue to incorporate it long term.  Include cardio and strength training but remember find something you like. Live, love and laugh – “Live your life whole heartily” I absolutely love this and heard this from a good friend Rachelle Wood, RHN .  This really is so true making lifestyle changes requires daily dedication. Avoid the sugar blues – it seems it is just so difficult to get away from it and the more refined it is the more our bodies react to it.  Too much sugar can lead to osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, over weight and so much more … Also watch out for artificial sweeteners which are toxic to the liver because they are chemically adjusted products.  Avoid saccharin, aspartame and sucralose. Eat live, natural and good quality foods - eating organic when possible will help lessen toxic load eliminate pesticides, antibiotic and hormonal residues.  Avoid processed and refined foods that are prepackaged and artificially sweetened.

 Lifestyle Changes = Preventention Day 1 
 Posted on July 11, 2011 by kalenutrition 
Hello and Welcome!

Day 1–Lifestyle Changes

I decided that it would only make sense for me to try my own program before I could tell others that they work right!  Well today is day 1, I started my day out running late (ugh) managed to have my glass of room temperature water with  a squeeze of lemon while I was getting ready for work.  I grabbed my coffee to go and out the door.  Not an ideal way to start the day.

I did make up for it when I got to work, grabbed a organic plain yogurt, my stand by cereal”Holy Crap”Dragons’Blend and another large glass of water.  For a snack I was able to get a hard-boiled egg and some cut up veggies.  For lunch a Salad from the salad bar with chicken, balsamic vinegar and olive oil.

ote to self:  remember to pre-portion veggies, nuts and seeds and my other snacks for the week tonight (great way to grab and go).  This of course would not be how I would suggest to start a weight loss program to incorporate lifestyle changes but to be honest I was in Edmonton over the weekend, my mother is in town and I just did not remember to schedule in my time to take care of me.  Sometimes its really just about making the best choices that you can in the situation you’re in.  For example I could have gone to a fast food restaurant and ordered off the menu and said ok I’ll start tomorrow but in reality I wanted to show that you just have to make the best choice that is available to you.

So tonight I will make the time to prepare for my week which will allow me to set myself up for success!  Watch for upcoming articles, weight loss/management tips and recipes!

until my next post your friend in health,

Michelle

 Lifestyle Changes = Prevention = Healthy Aging 
 Posted on July 6, 2011 by kalenutrition 
Hello and Welcome!

Wow where has the time gone? Over the past few months I have been so fortunate to work with amazing people and their weight loss&amp;wellness journey.  It truly is so inspiring to see how simple lifestyle changes can create such powerful transformations in peoples lives.

Although working with others has left me feeling inspired I noticed that over the past few months I have been feeling tiered (just not enough energy) and my clothes are fitting a bit tighter.  Sometimes when we get so busy in life we forget to take care of ourselves and so a few pounds sneak back on and the food choices may not be as optimal for energy.

I often ask the people I work with to journal which not only helps to keep accountability but also the what, how and when  of our choices and how we are feeling.  What better way then to update this blog once a week for me to keep myself motivated but journal on here.

I would like to hear your stories too!  Tell me what has been your frustration or sticking points.

your friend in health,

Michelle
