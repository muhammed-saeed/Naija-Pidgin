 Diner Style Cheeseburgers 
 

 One of the best things about Racine , Wisconsin is Kewpee&apos;s . It&apos;s an old-fashioned burger joint serving up good food and friendly service. Customers sit on stools at the horseshoe counter, servers still take your order with pen and paper.

 

The burgers are juicy, the buns are toasted, the crinkle-cut fries are crispy, and the root beer is homemade. Plus, there&apos;s a sense of community you just don&apos;t feel at a typical fast food restaurant. 
 A Kewpee cheeseburger is the standard by which my kids measure all other burgers. They complained my burgers at home were too thick, too crusty, too charred -- &quot;we only like Kewpees, Mom.&quot; 
 So on our next visit to Kewpees, we sat right across from the grill and I paid attention. I can&apos;t match the practiced technique and timing that comes from years of experience at the grill station. (You can see a pic of Kewpee chefs in action on their website here .) But I adapted the Kewpee method for my home kitchen. 
 Burger nights at home now get enthusiastic response. The family says my burgers are &quot;almost as good as Kewpees.&quot; There&apos;s no substitute for a visit to Kewpees, but every once in a while, it&apos;s fun to capture the diner experience at home. 
 
 
 Kewpee&apos;s-Style Cheeseburger 
 If you&apos;re ever in downtown Racine, grab a burger at Kewpees (and check out their display of Kewpee collectibles). Otherwise, make a Kewpee&apos;s-style burger at home. I use an electric non-stick griddle to accommodate about 1 pound of beef (6 burgers) at once. You could adapt the method using a non-stick frying pan on the stove-top, but you&apos;ll need to cook the burgers in two batches. We love to serve these burgers with homemade french fries, but chips make for a quick weeknight dinner. 
 1.125 pounds ground chuck (18 ozs.)
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
6 soft white hamburger buns
6 deli slices sharp cheddar 
 Heat griddle to 350 degrees F. Combine ground chuck, salt, and pepper. Mix gently but thoroughly. Form 6 thin hamburger patties, about 4 inches in diameter. Transfer the burgers to the hot griddle and cook for 3 minutes till burgers are browned on bottom. Flip burgers over and cook for another 3 minutes, or until burgers are cooked through (internal temp at least 160 degrees F). Transfer burgers to clean plate. 
 Remove all but about 2 teaspoons of grease from the surface of griddle. Place the buns cut-side down on the griddle. Cook for a minute or so until buns are toasted to your liking. Put the toasted bun bottoms under the burgers, set the bun tops aside. Turn off the griddle; wait a minute for it to cool a bit. 
 At this point you can put the cheese directly on your burgers. We like to melt it slightly on the griddle before topping the burger, just like they do at Kewpees. Until you get the hang of it, it&apos;s best to only heat only 1 or 2 slices at a time. 
 Put the cheese slices directly on the griddle. After 30 to 60 seconds, when the entire slice has softened and is melting (but not bubbling), scrape up each slice of cheese and quickly transfer to burger. The cheese will crumple up on the spatula a bit and might be difficult to place neatly on the burger. The trick is to work quickly and confidently (and use a spatula that won&apos;t scratch your non-stick surface). Don&apos;t worry if the cheese is a bit messy -- it will be meltingly delicious. 
 Finish the burgers with the toasted bun tops. Serve immediately with your favorite condiments. Grilled onions make a nice addition too. 
 Makes 6 cheeseburgers.
