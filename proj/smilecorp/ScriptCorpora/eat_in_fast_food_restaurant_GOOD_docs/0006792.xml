Each student was to visit two different fast-food restaurants that make hamburgers and give a report on the production process. The 2 different fast-food restaurants that one visited to observe the making of hamburgers were McDonalds and Jack in the Box. The results were quite different after each observation was conducted (Aquilano, Chase, Jacobs, 2006).

The McDonalds restaurant was the first visit. As soon as one walks through the doors, one can see that the production process in this establishment was very organized in watching each individual going about and doing each of his or her job duties repetitively. The first person that one encountered was the clerk who took the order from the customer. He or she would ring in the order into the register which would show up on a screen behind the counter where another clerk would gather up the items to make the order complete. If there were no appropriate items in the bin, he or she would communicate with another individual who was the cook to prepare such item. Within seconds, the clerk would receive the item that was requested from the cook. The clerk would then bag the items and present them to the customer. The production process of each individual at this McDonalds restaurant resembled an automobile factory assembly line. Each individual knew exactly what he or she was to do in getting the customers order fulfilled in a timely and efficient manner.

The next stop was, the Jack in the Box restaurant. As soon as one stepped into the door, one could immediately see chaos in the restaurant. Many customers were waiting for their orders, clerks behind the counter were going in every different direction trying to get out of each others way and the eating area in the restaurant was untidy.
