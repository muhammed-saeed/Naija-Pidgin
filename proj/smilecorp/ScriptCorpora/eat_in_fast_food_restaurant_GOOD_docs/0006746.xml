 May 2009 $25 Well marked, easy access from I30 Westbound from Little Rock. Paved interior roads, gravel sites, terrific views! Very nice clubhouse, with home baked treats. Very friendly and helpful staff. Designed and built to be &quot;big rig friendly&quot;, even back-in sites are easy to access. You can always tell a campground, designed and built by campers. This is on our A list. Rig is 32&apos;. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 March 2009 $25 A small campground area in a wooded area. A small unisex bathroom and shower on-site. The sites are not level and required about a 12 inch rise on the front wheels of our 30ft Motorhome. Access to the sites to backup a motorhome is tight. Although the campground is just off the highway it was remarkably quite. We were the only unit at the park when we visited in March. Overall a very nice RV area if you like a quite secluded wooded area. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 June 2012 $38 Other than the lack of grass or anything else green at this park, it&apos;s a nice place. The landscape mesh around the river is required by environmental laws and will be there until they get grass to grow! It protects the river. I hope they have plans to install an irrigation system soon. Nice dog walk, pool and other amenities on site. Follow the &quot;RV friendly&quot; directions provided by the office or you may end up going through a subdivision. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 June 2012 $38 We stayed here 5 nights. We really enjoyed the peace and quiet at this park. The family enjoyed the saline swimming pool which was nice because when you got out of it you didn&apos;t smell like chlorine. There is a little recreation room where you can watch movies on their big TV. My wife and I did this when she washed laundry across the hall. The exercise room was a nice perk. Unfortunately, the camp store didn&apos;t carry little necessities like milk. We were close to Hot Springs which was good. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 June 2012 $38 We did enjoy our stay at this campground but felt that the place is over-rated and over-priced. I guess if you needed to use their bathrooms/event rooms/pavilion, then maybe the ratings/prices would be justified. They looked very nice. But we didn&apos;t need/use any of those. Based on the high ratings on this website, I picked a &quot;waterfront&quot; site. It wasn&apos;t really what I&apos;d call waterfront. You couldn&apos;t really access the water from your site. You could see it and were much closer to it than the other sites, but they had a black mesh barrier between the sites and the water (rather ugly thing). The rate was actually $42 but they took the standard 10% off for Good Sam. This is a dry year for the area so grass was brown and crunchy underfoot for most of the park (maybe they should consider using sprinklers!? Almost all their plantings looked dead too). We found the people who worked outdoors there to be very friendly, but the people inside varied. The gal who helped me on check-in was not exactly the most friendly or smiley person I&apos;ve run into. And they&apos;d run out of their &quot;brochures&quot; so no campground map or info for us. It&apos;s in a good location - off the beaten path enough to be quiet and pretty but still close to freeway access/shopping/etc. And thank you to the previous reviewer who mentioned Garvan Woodland Gardens. It was very nice. The Anthony Chapel (outside of the area you have to pay for) was the best part!!! But you have to be sure they don&apos;t have it closed off due to weddings, etc. Overall, I&apos;d give it a higher mark if all the other places we&apos;d stayed at in OK and AR weren&apos;t as nice or nicer and HALF the price!!! We camped here in a Motorhome.

 May 2012 $32 This is a fairly new park (open about two years), but super nice. It has a small boat ramp for small fishing boats or house boats/party barge type boats, and four or five boat slips. Love that they have a fenced in dog area. Restrooms were super nice and clean. There are restrooms in three areas that I saw, plus more at the pool. There are two laundry areas that I saw, but I did not utilize them or even go inside. There is a great pavilion with picnic tables and a long prep table area with double stainless steel sinks on both ends. There are big 10 blade ceiling fans in the pavilion. There is a set of restrooms in the pavilion, as well as an ice machine (the kind where you put money in and can pick two different sizes of bags to fill up), and there is a soda machine. The pool was warm and nice and clean. No hot tub. There are currently 10 cabins and 4 or 5 yurts. Our friends stayed in a cabin and said they were very nice inside. I&apos;ve never heard of a yurt - but they are a permanent tent structure; round like a tepee, but has a hinged door and a small a/c unit and a round skylight in the top of it. They plan to put in a Frisbee golf area and more cabins with RV sites beside them. The grounds are a former dairy pasture, so they are still working on getting the grass nice and pretty. All of the sites have a patio area with a picnic table, and a fire pit. Very quiet when we were here, with about 20 or so other RVs on the grounds. Would stay here again if we visit the area again. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 April 2012 $24 All sites are concrete and roads asphalt. We had a great pull through site with a view of the lake. The park is new and adding landscaping. Sites are level and easy in and out. WiFi was good. This is one of the nicest parks that we have encountered. Staff was friendly and helpful. It is close enough to most attractions without being in a congested area. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 April 2012 $29 Very nice RV Park in an excellent location. Close to everything in Hot Springs and right on a beautiful river. Spotless showers, two nice laundry rooms, huge Pavilion, nice office with the necessities and friendly staff. Great pool. All sites are long and wide with great hookups. Good Wi-Fi without extra dollars and great cable. They do need more landscaping but they were working on that the week we were there. Price is weekly rate. We will be back. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 March 2012 $38 Easy access to Hot Springs attractions. Lots of amenities onsite, including pool, covered group meeting areas, boat docks and boat rentals exercise room. Easy access for large rigs, level sites. Good Verizon cell coverage. Not a lot of trees to interfere with satellite service. We loved this campground. We would love to return. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 March 2012 $24 Beautiful new park. Long, level, back-in and pull throughs. Paved streets and pads. Good utilities. Brand new clean private showers and rest rooms. Pet friendly and has dog park (needs more work but fenced). Lake front sites on inlet to Lake Catherine. Boat docks (not at each site). Large saline pool, heated (sometimes). Open all year. 2 levels of Wi-Fi (free and $$ for higher speed). Cabins and yurts. 5 mins to shops and restaurants. Quiet residential area. Trees and landscape has been planted and getting there. Introductory rates for back-ins, and weekly&amp;monthly rates. Great value for the price. We will definitely return when in the area. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 October 2011 $35 A good spot for exploring Hot Springs in the off season. A large campground with very easy access around the grounds. Very little vegetation due to the newness of the site but trees have been planted that in time will provide shade. Lots of empty spaces due to the time of year and good facilities for laundry. Do not use GPS off the interstate as it takes you the wrong way. Phone the site and get their instructions. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 October 2011 $35 This is a very friendly well kept park. It is very big rig friendly. There was a Newmar Rally being held, and it looked as though everyone was having a good time. We want to rent a party barge next time and see Lake Catherine. There is a lot to do in Hot Springs. There&apos;s Historical Bath House Row, The Belle of Hot Springs on Lake Hamilton, The Alligator Farm, Oaklawn Race Track and Casino. We highly recommend this park, and plan on going back. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 October 2011 $33 Great park with great amenities. New park in the finishing stages getting the grass to grow and other minor stuff. Very friendly staff and very well maintained property. Lot 104 was a back in spot next to the lake. They have both pull through and back in. Awesome restroom/showers. Will definitely return. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 September 2011 $37 Catherine&apos;s Landing has potential. Open since April, and with some heavy rains, the grounds are a bit of a mess. Grass is patchy, soil is washing through sites, and the landscaping is barely there. The management told us the owners will be spending considerable money to fix this during the winter. With the excellent facilities, I hope so, for a park like this is a pleasure. The pool and gym were welcome, though more equipment is needed in the latter. The pavilion is ideal for clubs, and the meeting room was in daily use while we were there. Showers and restrooms are beautiful and clean too. Our biggest complaint? The noise from some permanent tenants with a yappy, disobedient, off leash Dachsund. The ongoing calls &quot;Duke! Duke! Duke!&quot; woke us up each day, and the barking was ever present. This was punctuated by the work crew buzzing through the campground on 4 wheelers picking up trash at each site. For gosh sake, please get an electric cart to do this! We would use this park to visit Hot Springs again, and hope for improvement. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 September 2011 $30 Fabulous!! A new park that is already great and working hard to be even better. Right on the water with a boat ramp and new docks, and sites sporting wide level concrete pads with fire rings, barbecue pits, and picnic tables. The cable service is very good and the broadband Wi-Fi is free and fast. Trash is promptly picked up at your site (no searching for and hiking to the trash bin). We came here for a week and decided to stay for two weeks. The staff is quite helpful and so very courteous. Southern hospitality is alive and well at Catherine&apos;s Landing. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 September 2011 $38 We were on one of the lake lots which gave us easy access for fishing, birding and just relaxing. The park is kept is very good condition, has excellent bath facilities. If you have friends without an RV who need accommodations, the Yurts are really cool. The park just recently opened and they are still in the process of putting in hiking trails. It is close to Hot Springs-the racetrack, historical Bathhouse Row and other lakes. We recommend it! We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 August 2011 $35 This park has excellent facilities, concrete pads, paved roads, a huge pavilion, very nice meeting room and kitchen for small groups. Strongly recommend the lakeside sites in the summer. In the evening you get a cooling effect off the water. The only problem I noted was a lot of dirt between the sites and on the pads. The manager mentioned that the grass had just started growing the last few weeks, so time should take care of that problem. We will go back again, probably in the late fall or spring. We have camped at over 100 campgrounds and we would certainly put this one in the top 4 or 5 we&apos;ve been to. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 August 2011 $1 The website makes this new park sound wonderful. That wasn&apos;t our experience. The potential is certainly here: cement pads, large picnic pavilion with grills and sinks, modern restrooms, private showers, laundry, pool--all on a lovely lake. But the reality was disappointing. The cement pads were covered with up to an inch and a half of sandy soil washed down from the surrounding area by past heavy rains, making it impossible not to track soil into our rig. Dead trees and shrubs abound. At a site near ours a fallen tree was lying on its side across the top of the fire ring. The site next to ours had trash strewn about, including a plastic soda bottle and metal cans and wrappers, all faded as if they&apos;d been there a while. The sparse grass was unmowed and a foot high in places, growing in scraggly tufts in the sandy soil along with tall weeds, even inside the fire rings, giving the entire park a seedy, unkempt appearance. At 4 PM the bathrooms were in need of cleaning, with waste splattering one toilet bowl, trash on the floor, and soap scum in the shower stalls. The laundry had soap spilled on the floor in several places and one machine out of order. The pool was supposed to be open until 10 but was locked at 9:30 and the bathrooms were still in need of attention. Perhaps all this could be explained if the park was busy, but we saw about 12 other campers and there are over 100 sites. The next morning the bathrooms were still dirty and the staff mowed our site while we were there, stirring up dust. When they brought out the blower my husband told them to stop to avoid an even bigger dust cloud. The free, strong Wi-Fi signal, nice buildings, pretty surroundings and good layout don&apos;t make up for the lack of maintenance and upkeep, and don&apos;t justify the cost, even with a Good Sam discount. We spoke to the manager on our way out, and after multiple attempts to justify the issues we experienced, he offered us a full refund. This may be a great park someday, but we will seek other options. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 July 2011 $45 Wow, you can tell this park is brand spanking new, but by the time we arrived, things looked like they were coming along nicely. Their giant pool was open and it was very refreshing, especially during this awful heat wave! The pool is a salt system, which was a nice change from the usual chlorine we&apos;re used to. They had a spacious pool deck that overlooked the entire property and a beautiful stone waterfall too. Our waterfront site came with no problems and a gorgeous view of Lake Catherine. Lake Catherine is a bit small compared to its sister lakes in Hot Springs, but it is quite clean and clear (and a bit cold!). The bathrooms and laundry facilities we used were fairly close to our site and huge! Not to mention very clean and rather luxurious looking for an RV Park. We were pleasantly surprised. Overall this was a great experience for us. The General Manager was very friendly and helpful. (We even got a personal escort down to our RV site by one of the front desk girls!) Everything was very well kept up and the landscaping was tasteful. We will probably be coming back in the near future. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 May 2011 $25 Brand new RV park - rate reflects 50% discount as they are finishing development. Sites were good size, plenty of room for slideouts and awnings. Each site had a fire ring/BBQ grill, picnic table, and concrete pad. Blacktop roads throughout, good street width and all sites are angled with an easy approach for large 5th wheels and motorhomes. Sites were level, good power&amp;water pressure. Nice boat launch and docks, good fishing on Lake Catherine. Bathrooms and showers were very nice and very clean. Huge shaded pavilion with picnic tables and fans, good setup for groups or rallys. Lodge was very nice with meeting room, laundry, exercise room, and some kind of game room. Wi-Fi was free and had good signal strength and speed. Landscaping still needs to be finished, but overall this is going to be a very beautiful property when finished. I rated it an 8 as there&apos;s some dust&amp;construction going on, but when it&apos;s finished I would easily rate it a 10. Will definitely come back. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 June 2010 $30 We were a little disappointed by the condition of this campground. It looks like this was a first class park at one time, but was clearly set up for older campers. The sites were very tight, we have a trailer with (2) slides on each side on the camper and the spot was so tight, both of them kind of sealed off the camp site. The bath house that was close to our area had only (1) men and (1) ladies room, AND the men’s was out of service. The club house and clothes washing room were locked up. The beautiful “waterfall” that is shown on the website was a man-made thing, and even it was not functioning. They did have a nice clean pool that had big clean bath house, but that was all the way to the front of the campground that we had to take our truck to get to. The park itself is on a waterway that leads to the lake and is very nice. They have a couple boat launches as well as a beach area to enjoy. The sites by the water all had private docks but all but (2) were flagged off due to the wood being rotten. We were lucky, ours was in service and a very nice way to spend the afternoon during the sunset. Talking to the lady at the front desk, she stated the park was under new management and they were working on trying to get all these things resolved. I’m not sure how long it has been since this “new” management has had this property but some things could have been made available to the park like the club house and washroom both of which looked to be in good shape. We made the best of what we had and the lady was very, very friendly. I hope the new owners will get this park back to what it used to be, a very nice campground, until then I would look around the area to see if there may be other options. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 June 2009 $30 I was slightly worried about this park when driving to my spot because they have all the permanent residents in the front. However, once you get back to the lakeside spots, it really becomes a neat park. Rig access was a little tight and there was barely enough room for the slide-out, however, once we got pulled in it was worth it. Each lakeside spot has its own pier and when they say “lakeside,” they mean lakeside! We were probably 20 feet from the water. This was nice especially since they are a pet friendly park and our dogs could go play in the water. The pool looked to be nice as well but we did not swim in it. I’m not sure if they have 50 amp services or not. We looked around a little while for a 50 amp spot for our friends but could not find one. There is Wi-Fi access at the office. My only complaints were how hard the spots were to get into and the bathrooms were terrible (but there’s a very clean bathroom in my R.V. ;-) ) We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 July 2012 $27 We paid the Good Sam rate. This park is literally on a mountain top. One reaches it via a paved, curvy, and somewhat steep 1/4 mile private road. The sites are level, well-drained, and have a great view. The Wi-Fi is free and fast. The temperature atop the mountain is 10 degrees cooler than Hot Springs (where it hit 104 during our stay). We found the hostess/manager to be a charming and informative character. This is a great campground. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 January 2012 $28 Staff was friendly. We stayed here for the Wi-Fi, but it did not work the first day, problem was AT&amp;T.;Called the office, they were willing to give us some money back but the Wi-Fi worked in the evening so we did not pursue it. No grass for our dog. It is 12 miles to Hot Springs, too long. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 November 2011 $27 High on a hilltop, this campground has nice views off to the south, and is quiet even while being within a short driving distance of Hot Springs. Bathrooms were very clean, and the shower stalls were large. Good WiFi signal. Very nice rec hall for club use, or for sitting in a sofa and watching TV. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 October 2011 $27 This is a nice, neat, well maintained RV park. It is a little far away from things but for that distance you are rewarded with peace and quiet and a nice view overlooking the surrounding countryside. The parking places are wide gravel, level, but somewhat short. The interior road is paved blacktop. If you have a long coach, you may have to disconnect your toad. If that is the case, there is plenty of room to park next to your rig. The staff was very friendly and you will be escorted to your parking place. The electric, water,and sewer are easily accessible and stable. The Wi-Fi was one of the best we have ever used. Cell phone service was fine. This park has a nice clubhouse and a clean laundry facility. The only negative I have with the park is with the showers. They are large, clean, and tiled but you have no privacy. There is one bench for two showers and you have to dress and leave your clothes outside of the shower stall. Obviously this is not a problem if you do not use the park&apos;s showers but I am mentioning it for others to decide. It is sort of like being in gym class again. We would definitely stay in this park again if in the area. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 September 2011 $28 Good access, immaculate facilities, nice club house with pool table, free coffee and donuts/muffins, and an enormous wrap around porch with rocking chairs and lounge chairs, with view on forest. Some sites are a little narrow. Road paved, sites gravel and mostly level. Very friendly staff. Book exchange in laundry room. The &quot;steep&quot; road to get there is not so steep..not difficult at all. Well signed from Hwy 70. Only drawback is that it&apos;s a little bit far from town..but the quiet and fragrant forest is worth the drive to town. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 September 2011 $27 Pleasant location on a knoll above surrounding forest. The clubhouse is very nice, with games and exercise equipment, and a big covered porch. Facilities are spotless, so much so we used them with relish. Sites vary from spacious to narrow, but all are gravel and easy to level on. Quiet, with mature travelers when we were there. The staff was great. We will seek other sites owned by this colorful &quot;tycoon&quot;. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 May 2011 $25 Rate reflects Good Sam club. Stayed her 5 days and found CG to be above average. Cable was acceptable, over the air TV was very clear and the Wi-Fi actually worked very well the majority of the time. Will probably stay here again. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 April 2011 $25 Beautiful park located on top of a hill, hence the name, with gorgeous views. Staff is very friendly and accommodating. We were a little worried about the road leading up to the park, but it proved to be no problem. Our truck easily towed our 39&apos; 5th wheel up/down the paved hilly drive. We would stay here again. The rate above reflects the Good Sam discount. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 April 2011 $39 Rate reflects premium for 4 adults. Base rate is $28. It is a Good Sam park which gives 10% off for that. My rating is lower than any recent rating. The park is everything that others have said - very nice owners, large flat sites, beautiful view, well kept, awesome rec hall with pool, large screen TV, etc. So - why only 7? Two main issues that I was not aware of from previous reviews. First of all, the park is not all that easy to locate. Our GPS didn&apos;t recognize Cloud Nine road, nor did it identify the 5400 block of E Grand Ave. The park is located off of Highway 70. There are two small signs marking it just before you reach the driveway, one either side of it. The driveway, or &quot;Cloud Nine Road&quot; is winding and uphill. I wouldn&apos;t want to meet an oncoming RV while climbing it. Second, I did not get a good night&apos;s sleep, and that&apos;s the most important thing to me as I travel. This was an overnight stop only for us. At least four times between 5 AM and 6 AM loud diesel engine vehicles drove around the park. We believe they are long term campers who were going to work. One of those vehicles was very loud and I did not get back to sleep after being startled from sound sleep by it. So - just make sure you know the area well enough to find the park, and beware that there may be transient workers who rise early to go to work. We probably won&apos;t stay here again. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 March 2011 $25 This is a very nice park located approximately halfway between I-30 and Hot Springs. It is convenient to the city, yet far enough away to be peaceful and relaxing. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. This is a pet friendly park with a nice walking area. The road going to the park is paved and winds to the top of the hill with no really sharp turns that would inhibit a big rig. We found our pull-through space (#3) to be level with all hookups in the right place. The spaces did slope slightly to the front at the end, but the trailer location on the space was level and we had no trouble hitching and unhitching. If you are expecting a resort, you probably will be disappointed, but if you are looking for a nice quiet place to stay at a reasonable price you will be delighted. If you use their addresss in your GPS it will tell you to turn approximately 1/4 mile south of the entrance. The entrance is well marked from both directions. We stayed in a 38&apos; rig and will stay here again anytime we are in the area. The lady in the office said it is best to call a couple of days ahead as this is a smaller RV park and tends to fill up. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

It has a great recreation room containing a big screen TV, pool table, exercise equipment ,and a WII. Our Winnebago Camping Club had its Christmas camp out here and will return again.

 October 2010 $27 Lovely park, great views, about 9 miles from the Hot Springs historical area and the National Park. The winding short road up to the park isn&apos;t as bad as earlier described. We traveled it easily in a large fifth wheel with no problems. Wide, pretty level sites. Small laundry room, well maintained, and clean bathrooms, but the showers weren&apos;t private. FANTASTIC clubhouse with a front porch with a view to die for; big-screen TV, darts and pool table inside. Personnel were very nice. Nice short hiking trail through the woods. Our cable reception was snowy; Wi-Fi was essentially non-existant, even though I was told at the desk it was &quot;good&quot;. Wasn&apos;t able to get on even once in three days. Even with that, though, we&apos;d stay there again. I&apos;d give the park a 9 if the cable and Wi-Fi had been better. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 October 2010 $25 We spent 4 peaceful nights (and days) in this little campground. Now if you are looking for a swimming pool with hot tub and night life: this is not the place for you. If you are looking for great views, slow pace, relaxing time: you should make a visit. Showers and restrooms were spotless. Large community center with limited exercise equipment, pool table, a couple of very large screen TVs, pool table, couches, chairs, large deck with furniture, great views, and the coffee along with snacks were always waiting on the table. One night we were greeted by a fox walking through our site, the next day a couple of white tail deer. Road into and around the park are asphalt with gravel semi level grade sites. All sites had a picnic table, however grass area around the sites is somewhat on the smaller size. Good water pressure, good electric at the sites. The park is outside of Hot Springs, but it is a fast straight 10 miles from one to the other. The driveway into the RV park from the hiway is worth the trip itself, a series of short switchbacks up to the top of the hill. Nothing that would be any problem for a motorhome or tow vehicle. Honestly it was fun to drive in the motorhome and the dinghy. We paid $25 per night which included the Good Sam discount. The clear night skys and bright stars were included at no charge. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 September 2010 $27 This is a small campground, a few miles from Hot Springs, with nice views of the surrounding hills, level gravel sites with picnic table, most of which are open for satellite. The staff is friendly and helpful. The Wi-Fi internet is based on HughesNet and is almost unusable. Even the staff tells you that. We would stay here again. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 September 2010 $25 Among the best! Quiet, great view, immaculate bath/showers with handicap assist bar, wheelchair access. Fabulous rec-room: you name it, it was here. Exercise bikes, 2 large screen TVs, dvd&apos;s, full kitchen, pool table, darts, board game, a/c, lots of tables and couches for time away from the M/H. Everything is very clean. We&apos;ll be back.

 July 2010 $25 Although not a lot of amenities, this was a great little park; beautiful mountain views, excellent staff, great little clubhouse with &quot;viewing&quot; porch for the mountain views. This is far superior to the other parks in Hot Springs and I&apos;d highly recommend it! We camped here in a Motorhome.

 July 2010 $25 The shade trees are growing. Sites are very level gravel, the park road is black top. Sites are a bit close if parking a tow, picnic table is next to to neighbor&apos;s hook ups. Location is about 10 miles out of Hot Springs, but the road to get here is direct. Fantastic club house with great views and a huge wrap-around porch. Has a nice, short walking trail (pet friendly). A very clean park. We will definitely stay here again. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 June 2010 $40 A very nice park when you get there, but be VERY CAREFUL going up a very curvy, paved road. There are turns where you must be careful to look ahead of you as far as possible. I think we&apos;ll unhook our toad at the bottom of the hill when we stay there again. I&apos;ll probably follow our toad up the hill. There is no way two meeting RV&apos;s could drive on that narrow, winding road. Still, it is a very nice park with beautiful mountain views. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 June 2010 $25 Rate shown Good Sam discount. Access road as previously stated is a narrow, winding road with some breaks in the pavement. Site was a gravel pull through and not level. Limited cable TV selection, WiFi worked fine. There was a nice view of the hills from our site. Has a well equipped clubhouse with free coffee and cookies. Had tables and chairs out on the veranda.

 May 2010 $25 Although the park name sounds lovely, it&apos;s really mediocre. The sites are gravel, not very level and not well groomed (weeds, etc.). The laundry room only had 2 washers and 2 dryers. The recreation room is nice with a pool table, large TV, kitchen, and coffee available. The climb to the facility was a narrow asphalt road which required wide turns placing you in the path of any possible oncoming rig heading downhill simultaneously. Would have been impossible for 2 rigs to pass under this scenario. Thankful we weren&apos;t tested because one of us would have had to back up to maneuver the curve. Because of the curves in the road, it was impossible to see ahead to tell if any rigs were departing from the park down the hill while you were driving up it (or visa versa). There was ample room for our 35 ft 5th wheel, to open all 3 slides, and they provide a picnic table. Wouldn&apos;t stay here again. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 May 2010 $28 Surprisingly nice, very well situated park. Had a large pull through site with good views of mountains. Our dog enjoyed the nature walk trails, especially not having to be on the leash. The clubhouse is really large for a park this size, with lots of rocking chairs on the deck with great views, free coffee and muffins. Staff had a great, helpful attitude. We stayed one night while running from tornadoes and sure enough the fact that this park is in the mountains, kept us from having to evacuate again. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 April 2010 $28 Our fourth stay here so that in itself bodes well for the park. An excellent stop over on our way to and from wintering on the Texas Gulf. Always friendly, taken to our site, gravel, long and level sites so we just leave 5th wheel attached. We don&apos;t use the facilities but did tour them on our walk. It&apos;s quiet, restful, clean and immaculate. Outstanding view from the hill top! Rated only a 9 because it is smaller and simpler: just like we like it! Some 12 miles from freeway but worth it. We will stay here again, based only on what route we take. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 April 2010 $30 I vouch for all the good things that have been said about this little park. I pulled into my site and didn&apos;t have to level. People are more than friendly. I&apos;m hiding out from tornadoes, and the people who run the RV park have come down to tell me that rarely does a tornado hit this area, but the bathrooms/laundry room is a shelter. They are immaculate. I&apos;d prefer a separate changing area, but it won&apos;t stop me from showering. There&apos;s a nice club house. Cloud Nine is 10 miles from Hot Springs. I ran down for groceries this morning. My lab LOVES the trail, and I can let him off leash on it, a welcome relief from most parks. We&apos;ve already been three times today, in between the scattered rain showers. I&apos;ve signed on for two more days before heading further west. Someone in the park has a green thumb. The gardens are absolutely beautiful and you can tell they are tended to with love. The park has some semi permanent and permanent residents. All sites neat and clean, and people are friendly. I&apos;d recommend this park to anyone traveling through the area. I paid $30. per night without any discounts. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 February 2010 $27 What a welcome relief from interstate noise. We stayed for an overnight in a pull-through site. By the time we had our towed vehicle off the roadway, we were &apos;low in the front&apos; enough to require boards under the tires to level. It appeared this would be an issue on all the pull-through sites for MH&apos;s pulling toads. We had a beautiful view of the mountains from our site. Bathrooms and showers were immaculate. My only complaint, as others mentioned, is there is no private changing area. You exit the shower directly into the public area. Since there were only a few other RVs here at the time, this wasn&apos;t a problem. The hiking trail / dog walk was great and the park is very pet friendly. There are a lot of deer in the area, and two days after we left, we discovered a tick on one of our dogs. By process of elimination, it is probable it came from the Cloud Nine dog walk area. (Even with preventative solutions, ticks will still attach) so just something to be aware of. Overall, this is an excellent park and the owner was friendly and helpful. We had a 38&apos; motorhome plus toad and had no problems navigating the access roadway up or down. We would stay here again. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 November 2009 $22 This campground has a very pretty setting on the top of a mountain. We stayed in a pull-through site near the office. The pull through sites closer to the clubhouse have a much nicer view. Water pressure is not as high as we prefer. This park is run by two women who are very nice. They provide cookies and candies which are a nice touch. Clubhouse is well maintained and comfortable. Not a fancy place to stay; but quiet, pretty and not too far a drive from Hot Springs. We also did a day visit to Little Rock. In Hot Springs, be sure to check out The Wharf Restaurant: excellent. We were so sorry we did not find it until our last day. Excellent sea food: halibut and talapia to die for. Also Doe&apos;s is good for steak. Both have nice views of Lake Hamilton and decks for eating out in nice weather. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 October 2009 $27 Located 12 miles off I-30 and 10 miles from the historic business district of Hot Springs. The short road leading to the campground is a steep climb with turns. Big rigs should watch for and heed the “swing wide” signs leading up to the park. This is a very nice, clean, well maintained park with beautiful views. The interior road is paved and the sites are gravel. Each site has a nice picnic table. Long pull-throughs and enough room between sites to enjoy the outdoors. The park has a very nice recreation building with an outside deck and chairs and picnic tables to enjoy. The laundry room is small with 2 washers and 2 dryers. Very quiet and peaceful setting. Super courteous and friendly management. We will definitely stay here again. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 September 2009 $25 This is a lovely campground with very friendly and helpful managers. It is on top of the mountain with a fantastic view and a great breeze. The pull thrus were long and level with large concrete patios alongside the sites. The recreation hall is well-maintained and inviting and the laundry facilities are modern, clean and spacious. We had no difficulty managing the approach road, either up or down, with our 33&apos; motorhome towing a car on a dolly. We stayed here four nights and thought the park was a very good value for the price we paid. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 September 2009 $25 This is a very nice park. The roads and sites are paved. The 1/4 mile paved road leading up to the hilltop park is fairly steep and has some hairpin turns, but they are negotiable and the climb is very do-able. The staff is super nice and helpful. The park is well marked on the highway and there are signs along the road giving you plenty notice of the upcoming turnoff. Wi-Fi worked well and the cable TV was good, but has a limited number of channels. We never could find an ABC station. The park is about 12 miles from downtown Hot Springs, but it&apos;s an easy drive. The park is very quiet and you can see in every direction from atop this hill. Very nice place to stay.

There was not a playground or pool, but there was a nice game room.

 April 2009 $25 Very nice park. Owner very friendly and helpful. Gave us an escort to site and assisted with directing to proper place for hook-ups. Level, gravel, pull-through and back-in sites. Some shaded overlooking the valley. As others have said, the entrance to park was a rather steep grade with a couple sharp turns, but the road was in good condition and not difficult to navigate. My only complaint was the extreme slowness of the WI-FI connection. Will definitely camp here again. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 April 2009 $25 We stayed here for a week in April 2009. Although it has a very steep grade to reach their hill top park, it is well worth it. Our 42&apos;MH climbed the grade plus their &quot;Swing Wide&quot; signs were very helpful. The hosts were very helpful&amp;friendly plus freshly baked cookies were available every day. The park always had a little breeze and was cooler than Hot Springs downtown. Satellite reception was excellent. That is a definite plus. We would highly recommend this park as your base to all the attractions in the area. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 April 2008 $25 We enjoyed this park so much that we added several more days to our initial plans. Management threw a BBQ at the clubhouse while we were there. The amenities are spotless and management was very cordial. The views are incredible, and it&apos;s just far enough from town (about 11 miles) to be &apos;country-like&apos;. Songbirds abound. Our two dogs loved the nature trails. We checked out the other campgrounds in Hot Springs, and there is no comparison. We will definitely stay here again. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 February 2008 $27 Wonderful location on the top of a small mountain. The view would be spectacular, there is even an observation deck, but &quot;Clouds&quot; cut visibility to 100 yards that day. (Timing is everything). Showers and laundry were spotless as was the whole park, but there was no hot water as they &quot;had problems that day.&quot; (Timing is everything). Wi-Fi and cable TV are included, but we stopped here expecting to watch the Super Bowl and their cable, did not get Fox network. (Timing). Will definitely try to go back at another time as this could be one of the nicest parks of all, anywhere. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 November 2007 $25 Nice, clean park. I read several reviews on here stating the lack of grass and all rocks on sites, all true by the way. It wasn&apos;t until I read about using rocks to keep down chiggers&amp;fleas in this beautiful mountain top park that I understood. You are on a mountain top surrounded by trees. We stayed 3 days in a 5th wheel in November so there were not many others here. I think there may have been 15-18 campers total. The park is spotless. The laundry room is very clean, as is the bath house. My only problem with the shower was there was no dressing area. You stepped right out of the shower into the open area of the rest of the room. This is not a campground, it is an RV park. Campfires are not allowed, there is no playground or pool, and the sites are relatively close. But that was what we were looking for on this trip, just a &quot;base&quot; place to stay. The wi-fi is not fast and actually went out on me. Luckily there was somebody with unsecured satellite internet and I was able to piggyback on them. The cable channels are very limited, no regular FOX channel. We were able to get it over the air though. I would reccommend this as a place to park the rig and visit the area, but not as a campground to camp. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 November 2007 $28 After too many nights of trying to sleep next to the freeways, we found this park a great relief and spent 5 nights. It&apos;s so quiet! Clean grounds, friendly owners. Clear shot at the southern sky for satellite dishes. Laundry facility has two washers and dryers is only downside. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 September 2007 $35 I would have given this park a 9 rating except for two things. It is ten miles from town which is too far for my liking. Also, they charged for cable tv that did not work. I checked with the people next door and they had the same problem. I called the office and told them. The lady insisted that the cable tv was ok and refused to repair it or give us a refund. Enough said. We will not return. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 September 2007 $38 Very clean and well maintained. The view is stunning. We would plan a trip around this place and will definitely stay here if we are coming to Hot Springs. Road in is steep and curvy, but totally doable and black top is in great shape throughout. All of the hookups are easily accessible and if you get a chance, get site C-11. You won&apos;t be disappointed, best view in the park. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 September 2007 $25 Super park! On top of a mountain. Immaculately clean. Owners on site and very hospitable. Sites wide for this type of campsite. Picnic table at each site that could be moved. Wireless and cable could be added for minimal extra fees. Nice to have option to keep fees low ($25) if you didn&apos;t want extras. Owners very strict (pet waste, type of RV) but that only resulted in a excellent place to stay. We look forward to staying here again should we be in the area. Highly recommended. Very impressive.

 September 2007 $35 Not a bad park, but certainly not a 9-10. No grass for your pet, and one dumpster which seems like a 1/2 mile from our site. Lots of dust with gravel sites. Could not sit outside due to the smell of something like a dead animal coming from the site next to us, but no people were there, only a coach. Getting to the park is challenging, but can be done. Tough road for a big rig. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 January 2007 $20 We stayed at Cloud Nine Campground in January of 2007 in a fifth wheel. What a gem of a campground. Located on the top of a hill it has a great view of surrounding area. The owners are on site and are very nice. Sites are roomy. Cloud Nine Campground is close to HOTSPRINGS. There is lots to do in the area. I did not see a playground. We have stopped here before on the way south. We will stop again. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 November 2006 $13 This is a lovely park with easy and clean hook-ups. Road to the park is quite steep and windy, but wide and paved so not a problem for our 38’ motorhome with tow. The sites are wide and although our pull-thru site was long, it was not level at the front, so we had to disconnect to stay on the level portion. This was not a problem for us as we stayed 2 nights and had to disconnect anyway to tour Hot Springs. Very friendly and helpful staff. They brought us to our site, told us about places of interest in the area and things to see and do in our short stay. The view is gorgeous with some fall colours still in mid November. We used Passport America ($13) for our first night and Good Sam ($22) for our 2nd night. We paid an additional $2.50 per night for 50 AMP service, which is mandatory if your rig is 35’ or longer and we paid $2/day for Wi-FI. Our only negative comments on this park are: 1) picnic tables were usually situated next to your neighbour’s hook-ups (could be moved closer to the front of the site) and 2) the additional costs. We did not take cable TV, which is an additional $1.50/day. Even with our negative comments, we would stay again and for a longer period so we could take in more of the beautiful sites of Hot Springs and surrounding area. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 October 2006 $25 This is a very secluded park, very quiet, and scenic. Spaces are nice and big, lots of room. There is a really nice wooded area to walk your pets or take walks yourself. We stayed there in a motorhome and would most certainly stay again. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 October 2006 $13 Nice enough place. If we could have used Passport America for more than one night, we probably would have stayed two nights. It was raining when we got in, but the work campers manning the office walked us to the site. They also told us places to visit. We aren&apos;t mall people, but it was raining and we needed to get out of the RV, so we went there and picked up a cable TV connector to watch a football game that night. The campground is up on a hill. I walked the dogs on the nature path in the morning, which was nice, and the view was beautiful. This was the place that made us think it would be nice to own an RV park. If you are going to downtown Hot Springs, be advised there is dedicated RV parking in one of the downtown lots. If you ask a police officer, they can direct you. The park&apos;s marketing is quite good, such that my high expectations were probably not quite met. But it seems like it would be a nice place for a long-term stay. There seemed to be a friendly community there. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 October 2006 $28 We stayed here for the first time about 3 years ago. It was very nice then and still is. They have added wifi for a charge. We didn&apos;t use it so I can&apos;t say how good it is. The park is located a little bit out of town, but the views and the quiet surroundings are worth it. The center section of pull throughs have a drop off that looks like it would be difficult to get level. However, there were several large rigs in this section, and they did not seem to have a problem. We prefer the the C section back in sites which are very level and have the best views. The nightly rate included 50 amp and cable both of which are separate add on charges. The spaces are a little close together, but there was plenty of room for slides and awnings. We would definitely stay here again. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 July 2006 $24 Road up hill to park is paved and plenty wide, not a problem. Back-in sites provide great views and are very wide. Pull throughs are saved for overnighters and the end ones have a drop off that I&apos;d rather not pull my rig down. You are 6 miles to milk and bread, 15 miles to more. Water tastes great!

 June 2006 $27 Cloud Nine is an appropriate name. The panoramic views make this and excellent place to relax. The Owners are very attentive to the park and the guests. Sites are wide and long with shade. Sites are gravel to prevent chiggers and ticks associated with grass. Any time I am in this area, this is my park of choice. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 June 2006 $27 Very beautiful and photogenic. Level lots and easy to park-in. Friendly owners and very helpful in all ways. Modern campground only 4 years old. Well kept and updated. Owners do most all work to be sure it is done correct and clean. Owners take you to the spot and you chose the spot for yourself. Nice shade with young trees. I&apos;ve been camping for over 40years and highly recommend it. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 June 2006 $27 This park is in a quiet, remote location on top of a hill. The paved access road is slightly steep in places, but quite manageable. There are some nice views from several sites, but most of these do not have 50 amp hookups. The roads around the park are paved, but everything else is gravel. There are a few shady spots, but most are in full sun. Small trees were planted apparently without consideration for slides and required extra maneuvering to avoid them. There was no escort to the site, as was advertised. The manager was seldom in the locked office, but an intercom to her residence was provided, and she would appear soon after being contacted. The wi-fi was inoperative at the time of our visit, but we went ahead and paid for two nights, anticipating our wireless phone card would work for an internet connection. It didn&apos;t, because of the remoteness of the place, which we thought was an inconveniently long drive from town. After staying one night, we decided to leave and asked for a refund of the unused night. We were refused, which was a first for us in our RV travels. The park host said she didn&apos;t have the money (which we thought was less than truthful) and that besides, the no-refund policy is on their brochure. It is, but on the last page, which we didn&apos;t read until after check-in. We also overheard the host, a somewhat brusque woman, chiding another customer about his driving ability because he was requesting a pull-through instead of the back-in space he was assigned. For us, the negatives here far outweighed the positives, and we won&apos;t be coming back. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 May 2006 $28 We chose this campground because of the good reviews and were very disappointed. The sites consisted of dirt and gravel, no grass. Our neighbor&apos;s sewer connection was right next to our picnic table. There are a few sites with shade part of the day, but most of the sites are in full sun all day. Small trees have been planted between the sites which could be in the way of slides if you aren&apos;t careful. There was not a decent area for walking pets. The only semi-grassy area was full of weeds, stickers, and rocks. Some pets were not required to be on leashes. There was an extra charge for cable, but there are only a few channels so it was not worth the extra expense. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 October 2005 $11 We absolutely loved this camp ground. The 50 amp sites backed up to a spectacular view of the mountain range. The sites where very clean along with the bathrooms and laundry area. The camp host was walking around with a bag picking up something at each camp site. I figured he was collecting rocks or crystals. Turns out he was collecting cigarette butts. Thats how clean this place is. The town of Hot Springs had lots to offer and so did the many state and federal parks. We would return to this camp ground next time we visit the area. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 October 2005 $22 Beautiful park with very easy approach (not a tail scraper) up a smoothly paved road. Owners are very nice and take good care of the park. Stayed 3 nights and saw a lot of 1 nighters, probably due to it being a Passport America campground. Very quiet. Negatives: Charge extra for 50 amps because sites that fit RV&apos;s over 35&apos;, but prohibit electric heaters (used it anyway). Charge extra for cable that only has 10 channels. Also charge extra for wi-fi, but that&apos;s expected. Hint: Wi-fi key is same everyday. Overall, a good campground for the money. We drove through the KOA in Hot Springs to get propane. Scraped the tail twice and had to go around some tight turns. For $10/night less, Cloud 9 is it! We camped here in a Motorhome.

 July 2005 $28 We stayed at Cloud Nine for 7 days in July 2005. We are fulltimers and pull a large rig, so we were a bit apprehensive about the &quot;long winding uphill road&quot; comments, but the road has been newly asphalted and is among the SMOOTHEST Rv park entrances that we have found in a hilly environment. It&apos;s actually easier to enter and leave Cloud Nine than many flat-land parks! The hosts are gracious and reponsive to every need. We had a problem with the wi-fi, and they had the repairmen out the same day, and although not completely fixed, was still usable. But the real star of this show is the friendly and fine attitude of the hosts. About the park: Cloud Nine is situated on 65 acres of flat top mountain, and overlooks the vast green umbrella of oak, hickory and pine forests for as far as the eye can see. There&apos;s NO road noise and all 5 of us slept like logs. If you can back in, the views from the rear window are simply breathtaking at sunrise and sunset. The park is very clean, and there are walking paths that are kept groomed through the otherwise dense and fragrant forest. The geology has a vein of crystal running through the park and we picked up some beautiful stones here. The park is located about 2 minutes from a water-slide and roller coaster amusement park, with a go-kart track nearby, so the kids can have a ball while the adults enjoy the relaxation. Hot Springs, AR offers a wide variety of tourist attractions and activities, and Little Rock is about 40 miles away. I would give this park a solid 9 rating, saving the 10 rating for a similar high-quality park setting with a pool. This park is the closest thing we&apos;ve found to a natural setting like a national park, but with all the conveniences of 50 amp outlets, wi-fi, cable, cleanliness and non-intrusive institutional hosts and rules. This &quot;hands-off&quot; approach to guests and their privacy is always much appreciated by fulltimers, and too often overlooked by the nicer parks. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

The road in is very steep and winding, be prepared to go to the lowest gears. Other than that, it&apos;s a nice park and one of the nicest in the area. It&apos;s also a Passport America park.

 March 2005 $28 This is a very pleasant campground that sits up on a hill. The drive up a somewhat steep with some curves, but the roads are paved and it wasn&apos;t a problem. Once you arrive on top, you&apos;ll encounter a very nice couple who spent 15-20 minutes giving us an orientation and maps of nearby Hot Springs National Park. In this case, Hot Springs NP is the town. Sites are gravel, plenty long enough for our 36&apos;RV and truck, and ours was fairly level. Some of the pull-throughs do drop off and we may not have fit as comfortably in those. There are extra fees for 50a service, cable TV and WiFi. Because you&apos;re so high, it&apos;s very quiet and we had a very pleasant stay. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

Spot seemed a bit tight getting in and there was no room on our site to park our truck but they allowed us to park it in an unused site next door. Little bit noisy over the weekend with lots of children here but very quiet during the week. Super amenities and a great doggie park for our Ruby! If we are back in this area this is where we will stay. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 May 2012 $48 Let me start by saying we camped here Memorial Day weekend. Most of the employees were very friendly and helpful. Nice facilities. Short drive to Hot Springs&amp;BathHouse Row. At times, the restrooms could have been cleaner but for Memorial Day probably not too bad. Great pool. Nice shaded sites but spaces were a little snug for our&lt;30&apos; MH and TOAD (but I think it had more to do with our individual site due to a tree). Wouldn&apos;t bother bringing fishing pools for the fishing pond. Overall would stay again if in the area. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 August 2010 $45 NOTE: Try to arrive in the daylight or at least during office hours. We had a very difficult time finding our spot after dark. My favorite thing about this park is the dog park. When I made my reservation, they asked about pets. Since I have 3 dogs they put us in a great pull-through spot near the dog park. The area for dogs was a large, shaded fenced in area with a bench. We were able to take our dogs and let they play as we sat in the shade and watched them. The park is very clean and shaded. The roads are narrow and hilly. We were in a 30 footer and didn&apos;t have too much trouble, but a larger rig might have problems. Overall, a great park that I would return to. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 July 2010 $60 It is over priced and too crowded. Big Rigs can get in certain spots. The service road needs repair/ruts. It is a pretty park, but we had problems getting a signal with our Dome.

 June 2010 $56 This is a very convenient park for visiting Hot Springs, and is a little nicer than most KOAs, but still not great for the price. Park is very hilly and sites are a little tight, due to terracing that had to be done in order to get the sites level. Park roads are showing a little wear and tear. Staff is very friendly. WiFi works good and Verizon air card worked fine, too. We would stay here again, if we were in the Hot Springs area. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 May 2010 $49 We stayed here for three nights. The location is convenient to town and Bathhouse row. The KOA provides a tour, but we did not go on it. Our site was a pull through, but there really was not enough space for our tow vehicle. The campground is hilly, but was not a problem for us. The restrooms were clean, but in one, all the toilets were backed-up. There is a small dog park, a bit muddy, but shady. The staff was friendly. We would stay here again. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 February 2010 $35 This is not a typical KOA, this is a destination. This is one of our favorite parks to visit. We have family in HS so it is nice to have our rig with us when visiting. During the summer the pool is open, they love kids having lots of activities and fun things at night. Even a miniature golf area and local pizza that is not too bad. It is rare to be at a park that treats you like one of the family and we&apos;ve been treated that way on every visit. A real asset. This is a family owned park and they are great. The sites are older and tight but once back in you really feel like your in the forest, well you are really. We always come back and always will. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 October 2009 $32 This is a very nice park and close to Magic Springs. The pond is cute and we enjoyed watching the water fowl, everything was exceptionally clean, the staff was very helpful, and our dogs had a blast in the pet park. About the only negative would be the sites are extremely close together. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 August 2009 $35 Very nice campground convenient to downtown Hot Springs. Sites were shady and roomy, some more than others. Sites are built into a hillside and tiered so that each site is a little higher than the neighbor so that you are not looking directly into your neighbors window. Clean well kept grounds. Paved roads, gravel sites. Our site was very level and most others appeared to be also. Very nice hosts. Some premium sites available (at higher cost) with more room, concrete patios, nicer tables, hammocks, etc. Only downside (if it could be called that) was somewhat low water pressure. But not a real problem. Would stay there again. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 June 2009 $43 Not the best signage and watch out for sudden exit by dip in road: see brake and scrape marks on road. That said, we enjoyed our stay very much. We were escorted to our very clean, gravel pull-through site by very pleasant staff. We did need some blocks to level. Very nice store. Park was quiet, clean, and secure. We loved the lightning bugs, beautiful landscaping, and the super clean restrooms with the best shower drain/trough system I&apos;ve ever seen to keep all hair etc., flowing away from you. Nice pool. Enjoyed the pet park with a couple pieces of dog agility equipment and supplied doo bags. Free Wi-Fi. Pancake breakfast service very slow. Price seems a bit high, incl our KOA discount and additional charge of $3/child/day. We would probably stay again. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 April 2009 $34 We stayed here for two weeks and would definitely return. The laundry is immaculate with plenty of machines. The site we were on was very long and wide and very quiet. The grounds are very well maintained. As for the staff, we cannot say enough about their friendliness and professionalism. The campground is located close to all the things we wanted to access. There is even a great pet park for those who travel with dogs as we do. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 April 2009 $29 We were disappointed with this KOA. Lots of steep hills to get in and get to a site, tight in getting into site. Staff insisted in “helping” us. We could have done better alone. Sites close together. Laundry inefficient and costly. Poor signage to find the CG. commercial: $4 for miniature golf that is free at most CG. We will NOT return. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 March 2009 $35 This is a nice little campground located just outside of Hot Springs, Arkansas. It is around a five minute drive to most of the sights of town. Sights were mostly level and gravel. The roads were just a little tight. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about the area. The campground is quiet and clean. After looking at campgrounds around Hot Springs, this KOA looks like its the best one to be had. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 September 2008 $34 One of the nicest KOA’s we have experienced over the last year. We stayed at this KOA four nights while we attended an event in Hot Springs. The location was close enough to downtown Hot Springs to be convenient yet far enough away that we felt like we were in a woods setting. A state highway and county road are nearby yet did not create problems for us. We did notice that several tent campers were in sites only a few feet from the county road. Other tent sites were also available throughout the campground. The campground is built into a shaded, treed hillside so it was especially helpful that the camp workers escorted us to our site and made sure we were settled before leaving. The campground staff were helpful and friendly. All of the services we used worked well (30 amp power, water, sewer). We did notice that the cable TV hookup was at the far front of our site. The Wi-Fi was slow at times yet was accessible. We paid extra for 3 days of all day Wi-Fi access in addition to the one hour a day that was provided free of charge. While we were there, the on site cafe served breakfast on Friday, Saturday and Sunday mornings for a reasonable price. The offerings were similar to breakfast at a fast food restaurant and were a nice alternative to fixing breakfast at your camp site. The campground is nicely landscaped and has fun yard art sculptures in the flower beds and gardens. The bathrooms and showers were absolutely impeccably clean – all day and night during our stay. We would definitely stay in this RV park again. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 June 2008 $45 We avoid KOA campgrounds when at all possible, but in Hot Springs, there was no other place to stay. This is a typical KOA: over priced, narrow roads making it difficult to maneuver a big rig, narrow RV pads that are gravel and dirt, overgrowth of trees and shrubs. Lots of people obviously like this kind of setting but we do not. We could hardly wait to leave! Wi-Fi was adequate and reasonably priced: $4 for 2 days, The ladies checking us in were friendly. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 June 2008 $34 Positives: well organized and managed. Hosts and employees are &quot;at-your-service&quot;. Your are escorted to site with assistance on back-in. Bathrooms and showers are immaculate. Saturday and Sunday morning breakfasts are offered for a nominal fee. Ice cream social is also offered for a fee. The park is family oriented with kids playing in many areas. Sites are level and gravel. There are picnic tables at all sites. Minuses: The price was very high (we paid $34). Sites are a bit close together, but reasonable for awnings. There is a $3 charge for 24 hours of internet, and for only one computer (again, pricey). US 70B is very close in the lower (front) area of the campground and could be a noise factor for some, but was not for us. Kids on small pond dam and the downhill gradient of vehicles passing over it are a potential accident waiting to happen, and there was no lighting in that area. We would camp here again, regardless of the rate. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 May 2008 $46 This was my 4th time at this KOA in 2 years. I am always pleased with the friendly staff, clean park, and activities. Even though it is crowded, the layout of the sites gives the illusion of space. I was in section L (pull through section). There are no shade trees in this section but the sites are longer and have more room for parking. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 May 2008 $41 Outstanding campground! The only short side was that some sites are very close together (B loop). We couldn&apos;t use our awning due to a tree. The up sides were, staff takes you to your site and help you back in (very helpfull when the campground is packed and TVs and toads are parked on the road). The staff at this site are fantastic. Nice pool and very clean bathrooms. We would stay here again. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 December 2007 $32 We stayed here 3 nights while visiting Hot Springs. Convenient to downtown and located off well off interstate. CG managers on site and extremely helpful. Since was off season, we had our choice of spots. Beautiful CG, nice wide level terraced sites. Everything looked extremely clean and maintained. Pool looked nice but too cold to try it out. One of the best KOA&apos;s we&apos;ve ever stayed/ We would camp here again. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 November 2007 $32 What a wonderful experience. This is for certain one of the best KOA&apos;s we have stayed at. The hosts are very helpful, friendly. Helped us back into our site, offered to deliver firewood to the site. Wide level site, plenty of room for our 35ft trailer and truck. We spent 4 nights here, and will stay here again on our next visit to Hot Springs, which was about 2 miles down the road. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 September 2007 $35 Very nice park. Laid out nicely. Older park but well kept. Lots are pretty wide, and terraced so seems like they are even wider. Trees are kept cut so no problems with low limbs. Good WiFi. Close enough to Hot Springs to go and come easily. Could be a little more attentive to cleaning up after people who haven&apos;t learned to clean up after themselves (i.e: cigarette butts, wrappers, etc.). Would definitely stay here again if in the area. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 July 2007 $50 Our rates were higher because we had 2 kids and 2 grand kids and taxes. They didn&apos;t charge for the 3 month old. All sites were gravel and looked level. Lots of trees. There&apos;s a pond and ducks. Playground and a tractor pulled train ride for the kids. We had an excellent site across from the pool, baths, showers and store. Traffic was not bad. This site even had a little grassed area unlike all the other sites. Sites are back-in and quiet. Our sewer connection had no screw cap, just remove the plug and drop it in. Hot Springs is very close. Enterprise Car Rental will deliver a car to your camp site and give you a KOA discount on top of that. I&apos;d definitely recommend this campground. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 March 2007 $39 We arrived late and the staff was super helpful in getting us to the campsite. The campground itself was very clean. The bathrooms were spotless. Hats off to a great campsite and staff. If road noise bothers you, stay away from the highway sites. We were on the highway and got used to it, especially since our site was bigger. Great stay for us. We will camp here again. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 December 2006 $25 This was our first camping trip to HS. My wife is from here and this is where we were married. We found this KOA from this site, and we are sure glad we stayed here. It was WAY more than what we expected. Very clean, quiet, and the staff was great. They have a store on site that is great. We were there during a VERY cold first night and our water line froze. The staff was very helpful in fixing that for us. Also got our LP filled for cheap. This is a GREAT KOA and we will visit again. If you have a satellite dish, you will want to be on the left side up the hill before looping back to the store. The Entrance is very steep but you can do it, take your time. The Wi-Fi worked great and was super cheap per day. It came in handy. We met some really nice folks here and we look forward to going back. There are other parks in HS. If you hadn&apos;t been here before, you will want to stay here after you see the other parks. Diesel gas is also close by and so is the Nat Park (down town). Lots of trees. I would take your leveling blocks, you may need them on some pads. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

The sites are a little small and parking is limited but the services are great including the wireless internet, laundry, store, breakfast (limited to certain days), putt-putt golf. If you want to be close to the city of Hot Springs this is a good choice. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 July 2006 $32 A shade tight for a 36&apos; MH with a toad, but the facilities and staff make up for the work to get into the pull through site. I called once for directions, the clerk was busy but saw my call and number and called me on her own, GREAT. Only negative was the walk up the hill to the office, tough for an overweight Senior. I will stay here again and again. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 July 2006 $22 The sites are large and spacious but the roads are a little narrow. When we had to back in our 36 foot fifth wheel it took about 30 minutes. Not a lot of room to park tow vehicles which also contributed to us not getting into our site well. Other than that it was a nice organized clean KOA. Our sites was very large and all the sites are shady. Thank goodness because at 107 degrees of heat out side it helped keep the camper cool. We will stay here again but we have learned to go ask the neighbors to move their vehicles so we can get in easier. The playground, pool, and game room are very nice. They also have a little cafe thats open only on weekends that serve breakfast. That was very good. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 April 2011 $31 I was so impressed with this park. It was easy to find and easy to access. The owner was very friendly and attentive to our needs. There is plenty of places to walk our dog and it was extremely clean. The showers and bathrooms were exceptional and I noticed that they were checked rather frequently. The owner&apos;s wife was planting flowers in the beds and working on landscaping which really gave the park an &quot;at home&quot; feeling. We were fairly close to downtown but not too close. Everything was quiet and peaceful even though there was a park full of people. I felt so welcome and appreciated- which is nice. I would not stay anywhere else in Hot Springs. J&amp;J;has earned my loyalty! We camped here in a Motorhome.

 April 2010 $35 Stayed 3 nights. Advertises closest to Hot Springs. Not any closer than the KOA across the road. About 15 minutes to town. Park is a little bit run down. Creek runs around one edge of park. Pretty. Everything is gravel: road, sites. Owner is friendly enough, but thought $35 a night was expensive for what you get. Would probably stay again, but not more than a week. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 April 2009 $29 We stayed here in April and recently returned for another visit. This park is the best available in Hot Springs. J&amp;J;is in the perfect location with the easiest access ever! We love the open layout of the park: it makes it very easy to maneuver our &quot;Big Rig&quot; in and out! They have many pull-through sites that are so large that we didn&apos;t have to worry about getting too close to our neighbor. Clean, natural, beautiful and convenient. We will definitely make a stop here every year! We camped here in a Motorhome.

 September 2008 $29 This park has the basics and is convenient to town but we would not want to spend more than a few days there. The owner is very friendly and helpful. The long pull-throughs are located on a gravel parking lot with no trees, shrubs, grass or any features to separate the sites from one another. Not very attractive. The back-ins at least have shade from the trees along the creek. The Cable TV is good. We used our own Wi-Fi, not the park&apos;s. Although the park is on a busy highway, traffic noise is minimal, especially in the back where we were. However, during one of the nights we were there dogs barked loudly all night. We probably would return but only for a couple of days. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 April 2007 $22 Rate was 22 with Good Sam Discount. Park was about 1/2 full. We were given a beautiful back-in spot at the far end of the park next to a pool with a fountain spraying water. The neighbor&apos;s Pea Fowl roam the grass keeping the insect population under control. We have stayed in perhaps 20 campgrounds this winter from Florida to California and this rates right next to the best. Even though we rarely use one, a spa or pool would make this a 10. Note: the FREE wifi reaches the inside of the coach at the far end of the park. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 March 2006 $25 Nice little park, bikers welcome. Little road noise. Across from KOA. No pool, but the creek and ponds more than make up for it. Ponds have fish and other wildlife roams the park. A nice path along the creek for a walk. Some sites back up to the creek. Approx 15 pull throughs available. All sites have 30/50 amp, water , and sewer. Utilities are very well placed. Wi-Fi reaches to the farthest corner of the camp. Very little grass in camp. Sites are all pea gravel. Good space in between sites. Laundry has two machines each. Owner is a hands on guy and VERY friendly. Cash or check only. No Credit Cards. Good Sam discount accepted. A handful of long terms that all looked road worthy. I&apos;d go again in a flash. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 2002 $23 They have a nice stream that runs beside the park that is real nice and is very calming. It is a very new rv park so they don&apos;t have many shade spots. Very clean and nice rv park. Highly recommend if in Hot Springs for a night or more. $23.00 if you get a 50 amp. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 November 2011 $10 Rate reflects half-price for Arkansas resident senior citizen. Note that there are 2 types of sites, $20 for 30 amp and water, $30 for 30/50 amp, water, and sewer. The $30 sites are absolutely level and concrete pads, while the $20 sites are asphalt and slightly off-level, but not bad. The restrooms were spotless and nice and warm (it got down into the upper 30&apos;s during our stay) and the showers were adequately warm, but not adjustable in temperature. There are some excellent hiking trails in this park, and the sites themselves have a nice view of the lake and lots of space between adjacent sites. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 May 2011 $28 We camped here for 2 nights and were extremely happy with our stay. The first site they had us at was too difficult to get into, but they accommodated us very well and gave us another site. We did not know that with the Arkansas state parks you could actually pick the site you would like to be on, a year in advance. It is advisable to call the park and they will direct you to the best site for your trailer. The website for the state parks do not let you pick out your site yet. The staff made up greatly for that oversight. Very quiet and relaxing park. We were not able to hike, but we will definitely be back. Restrooms and park are very clean. Lake front campsites are very nice. We will be back. Hot Springs less than 30 minutes away. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 March 2011 $28 Stayed here over Spring Break 2011. VERY NICE sites if you pay extra for the sewer (AAA sites) in the new camping area. In-laws chose not to pay the extra $10 a night and barely got their 5th wheel down the sloping site they got. The AAA sites are level w/ asphalt drive, concrete picnic area w/table and leveled, graveled fire pit and tent areas. Connections for water, electric and sewer were all conveniently at the back of the slot on the correct side. OVERALL a beautiful park w/ playgrounds and activities for kids, right on the lake and just a few minutes from downtown Hot Springs. PS: Garvan Woodland Gardens is a MUST SEE!!! Just wear good walking shoes and find all the side trails you can! We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 October 2010 $30 Most of my opinion is based on shower/restroom condition. If you are self contained you may have a different opinion. Great staff, great site, and the showers/bathrooms are perfect!! I counted it, the facilities were cleaned 5 times in one day! The couple that does the cleaning do a fantastic job! The site I stayed in was concrete with a large adjacent area covered in pea gravel. I was with an Aliner group and we all had perfect spots for set up. This is a perfect spot for a pop up camper. I will be back!!! We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 July 2009 $25 Lake Catherine was a very peaceful and serene place to spend our vacation. We stayed in area C at the far end of the campground. There was just an abundance of different wildlife in the park. We saw geese, ducks, squirrels, deer, woodpeckers and other birds. We were even visited at night by the clever racoons. We were able to receive a few digital TV stations on our RV antenna. The showers were very clean and neat, but could use a shelf to place your shampoo and soap. The few drawbacks were that the other guests felt compelled to just walk through your campsite to get to the walking trails on the south end of the park. They had no regard for the people that were trying to enjoy themselves. The other small drawback was the view of the power plant across the other side of the lake, but it was not a major problem. I would definitely stay here again. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 April 2009 $27 The campground has just this season completed renovating the last of the camping loops. The sites were very large in the loop we were in (loop A),the only loop not right on the The other two loops have sites that are a bit closer together but not horrid. There is a swimming lagoon as well as boat rental. The sites are large and well set up. Even with kids running around the park sprawls enough that your not running over each other. This is why I loved camping as a kid places like this. As with all things some sites were more level than others and while the bath houses were new and shiny the showers were metered and I had to keep hitting the button to get a hot shower. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 February 2009 $14 This is a wonderful state park that combines waterfront sites, great hiking/wilderness activities with close proximity to Hot Springs. The sites were level and well maintained. The staff was absolutely delightful. I don&apos;t think we hit a special time or were treated out of the ordinary. All of the &quot;state park of the year&quot; commendation plaques in the main office would indicate that they have been doing a great job for a long time. Highly recommended.

 January 2009 $14 Nice hiking trails. Roads and pads all asphalt and concrete. Large, shady camp sites. Most are not level so be prepared to spend a little more time setting up. The new hookups in areas A and C are great. The only problem was that the sewer is at the very back corner of the pad. I camped 3 nights. All the employees that I spoke with were friendly and helpful. The rate was half price, winter rates. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 November 2008 $17 We camped at the park for 2 nights while visiting my wife&apos;s parents. The park staff at check-in were very friendly and helpful. What an incredible gem of a park! The new renovations to the park that have been made are fantastic. We&apos;ll definitely stay at the park again very soon. Our site was right on the lake, #33. The site is highly recommended.

 February 2007 $8 This older park has friendly staff but is beginning to show her age. A lot of the sites are extremely unlevel and the hookups are on the wrong side. If you need big rig access, use caution, because the roads are one-way and turns can be a little tight. The nightly rate was reduced off-season. Trash could have been collected more often. Even though there&apos;s a Walmart one exit away, we&apos;ll try other state parks in the area before choosing this one again. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 November 2006 $22 Driving in to this park was interesting, but once inside, it&apos;s beautiful, until you spot the electric plant on the opposite side of the lake. We had a waterfront spot, and when I say waterfront, I mean waterfront! The dogs had a ball chasing each other thru the mud at the edge of the lake. Large spaces and friendly workers quickly came to our rescue when we couldn&apos;t get the electric to work. The electric plant was quite a disappointment, and a little noisy. Lots of great hiking trails and very quiet. Would stay again. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 September 2006 $17 This is one of the most beautiful parks I have in Arkansas. We stayed in the preferred sites and nearly backed up to the lake. It was gorgeous, and the lake was high. It is well taken care of, and everyone was so friendly. The people there were great. It doesn&apos;t have sewer but we intend to go back in the Spring when the crappie are bedding. This is one of the BEST parks we have ever stayed at! We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 September 2005 $15 This is a old campground and as a result has non-friendly hook ups with the water being on the wrong side for RV&apos;s and unlevel sites. I was informed by the lady at the office that it was built before RV&apos;s became popular and the state will start a complete rebuild on most of the sites this and next winter. The staff was friendly. It is located about 8 miles west of I-30, 30 miles south of Little Rock, 10 miles north of Hot Springs. The lake was full and beautiful and I would still recommend it to anyone for a night or a extended stay. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 June 2012 $19 This is a very rustic campground set in the woods, some 30amps and some 50amps. Helpful and friendly staff at check in. Easy access and the road is paved. The pad is concrete and there is plenty of space and and privacy around the RV. The lake is small and you can see the ugly steam generating plant across the lake very clearly. Grill and fire ring are old, filthy dirty and falling apart. Restrooms are adequate and clean. We were here in June: too many unsupervised screaming kids, loud music playing, motor bikes revving, and junky trailers with lines of washing hanging outside. After reading all the great reviews on this campground, the actual place was a major disappointment, we would never stay here again. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 June 2012 $31 Positives are that the campground is close to Hot Springs and all of the attractions. Restrooms were very clean and the campground was well maintained. The park has 3 nice hiking trails and is directly on Lake Catherine. Beach is very nice, clean water and sand all the way out. Nice marina to rent canoes, kayaks, and motorboats. The biggest negative is that there is a steam generating plant directly across the lake which operates 24/7 emitting a white noise. The lake is fairly small and narrow so the plant is &quot;in your face&quot; so to speak. The sewer hookups are at the far corner of the sites which required a sewer extension. We camped here for nine nights and feel there are better alternatives in the area. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 October 2011 $28 These sites are HUGE. If I could rate this park as 11, I would. It&apos;s an absolute gem. We need to send Texas Parks&amp;Wildlife to Arkansas to learn how to operate a state park. A paved, level, full hookup site with a lake view, mobile hotspot reception, a full service marina, and a great staff. If this park could be made better, let me know how. It&apos;s 10 miles from Hot Springs, but we aren&apos;t tourists. Since we are in the area, we drove over and checked out Lake Ouachita SP and it looks just as nice. If I had to have a complaint, it would be that my wife didn&apos;t drive her car and pull my fishing boat. I will be back. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 November 2010 $25 Lake Catherine has become one of our favorite Arkansas State Parks. We spent a week at the park during Thanksgiving and had an incredible time in the area. The park staff is wonderful and the facility is first rate. We needed directions to one of the local attractions and they were more than helpful in pointing out additional sights we needed to take in while in the area. We stayed in one of the newly redone sites that had a very level concrete pad. We loved the full hookups (water, sewer and electricity). Many of the RVers staying in the park had decorated for Thanksgiving giving the park a festive feel to it. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 September 2010 $28 Wonderful park,we stayed in 68. Lot was large and was easy to back in. Took my mother and she loved it. Plenty of ducks and geese and plenty of motorboats with water skiers to watch. Stayed 10 days and would gladly have stayed longer. Park seemed to stay full. Would gladly stay here again even though it was a way into Hot Springs. Good cell reception. Staff was excellent and friendly. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 August 2010 $19 First impression was perfect. Just absolutely friendly staff. Very clean and pretty camp grounds. We were lucky and was assigned spot 27. This spot is located on a peninsula with about a 25&apos; pier and sandy area to swim in with lots of room between us and the neighbor. They have inexpensive boat rentals and horse back riding. Take all the food you need, town is about 20 miles away. P.s., the showers are tricky. there is a single button to press to get the shower going. Turn that same button to regulate the water temperature. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 November 2009 $22 We enjoyed our stay here for Thanksgiving week. We drove 9 hours to stay at this park. This campground has a couple of nice hiking trails, although one was closed due to hunting season. The water level is intentionally dropped very low in the winter so the lake was not as pretty as it could be. Some of the sites are short and very unlevel so you have to be careful with larger rigs. Overall we like the campground, but it probably wasn&apos;t worth the 9 hour drive. Next time we will try another park, but will definitely visit Arkansas again. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 May 2010 $40 This is the third time we have stayed there. It is under new management, and they were friendly. Lake Hamilton is a fun lake with beautiful homes. This park is close to Hot Springs, and really good restaurants. There is a good seafood/Cajun restaurant within walking distance. It is safe to turn into, and the interior roads are good. There is not much shade, but there are trees planted that have grown a lot since we stayed there a few years ago. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 July 2009 $25 This is a very clean park, as you will see the moment you drive down the entrance. The park is basically an asphalted oval with a road splitting the center of the oval. The sites are gravel with full hook-ups. I stayed a month over the summer: used the pool daily and found it to be very well taken care of. The pool rules were no drinking, eating or smoking, which I found to be acceptable. Because my stay was a little more than a month: I got to know the hired help somewhat, they were always courteous and professional, even in adverse situations, like dealing with drunks over the 4th of July holiday. My dogs were welcome and I was informed that if they couldn&apos;t make it to &quot;the dog walking area&quot;, it was not a problem as long as I picked up after them. I used the internet daily, but I also carry an air card which I never had to use. I have recommended this campground to other full-timers I know and will definitely stay here myself when in this area. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 July 2009 $27 This campground is by far the biggest disapointment we have encountered. There is no shade, but lots of rules. We were asked to leave our plastic bottled water at campsite before entering pool area. It was 100 degrees. On two other occasions the pool was closed (because all the workcampers decided they had better things to do than hang around the campground.) Also near 100 degrees. The owner is a real work of art, and the workcampers are the lasiest, most unfriendly people we have ever seen. Also the Wi-Fi didn&apos;t work more often than it worked.This place sucks!

 July 2007 $22 This is a fairly new park on a really beautiful lake. We had relatives with us, and they loved renting a boat and seeing all the beautiful homes on Lake Hamilton. Their children enjoyed the pool. Trees have been planted, and someday there will be some shade. The spaces are close together, but we were gone a lot and not really &quot;camping&quot;. One can go boating, swimming, or fishing. This park is close to all the Hot Springs attractions, and there are some really good restaurants close by. The office workers were very nice people. We didn&apos;t meet the owner. When we have relatives in town again, we&apos;ll go back there. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 July 2007 $19 The best I have to say is it has a good location right on the lake and the pool, restrooms and showers are clean. Negative-the owner is a grouch and has run off all the good workampers. Grass is growing on the gravel pads and along the far side it is very high. Pads are narrow and it may be hard to put out the awning if you have a neighbor. Not much space for your tow vehicle or dingy. Make sure your dog can make it to the far west side or you may be asked to leave. I would pass unless you are staying a very short time. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 April 2007 $18 Clean park, with asphalt streets surrounding all gravel sites. There is no grass at any site - all of the grass is at one end of the park. Sites are close together making it unworkable to use the awning. Previous review mentioned expulsion from the park if you let your pet use the No Pet areas. There is only one pet area at the west end of the park - they currently have doggie bags but the doggie bag holders are empty. I&apos;ve been told they are taking them down because some people abuse the bag availability. Sounds like they are cutting corners to save $$. The 7+ acres is For Sale, maybe that says it all.

 October 2006 $28 This is a gravel parking lot with hookups. The hookups are well done. I question the big rig because a 35 ft MH just fits into the back in sites. No pull through sites. Work camper on site. No cable TV even mentioned. Voltage is 127 v and water pressure is 45. Very little grass and what there is is off limits to pets on threat of eviction. LOTS of pet rules. Roads are asphalt sites are gravel and some mud (not horrible, just enough to track into the trailer). Well kept park. Didn&apos;t find bath/shower house. Pool closed. Fires only in fire rings: no fire rings. Dock boat at one of the lake side sites. Great for fishermen. Wi-Fi drops out but is OK. A few local eateries nearby. This price in off season doesn&apos;t make it. I think I&apos;ll pass on this one next time. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 June 2006 $22 We really enjoyed this park. The sites are nice and level and it was very quiet. The owners were very friendly and had our site ready when we arrived late. There were many places to eat nearby and all of the facilities, including the pool, were nice and clean. We especially liked the nearby boat rentals and were able to bring the boat back to the on-site dock. There were also many activities for children nearby. We stayed for four nights and had a great experience. The only thing lacking is shade trees. We will definitely return. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 November 2011 $31 Very nice park with outstanding showers. Entrance is a little tricky, so be sure to get directions. Waterfront is a little misleading. There is a very small area on an inlet of Lake Hamilton, not enough to walk around. Park and sites were loose gravel, which I found difficult to walk on with knee problems. Wi-Fi good. Cable somewhat limited: no business channel, which we miss. Very quiet and squeaky clean. Easy access for filling a motorhome with propane. Staff very nice, offering any help if needed. Small exercise room. Sites are not really long, but there is ample parking beside your rig for your tow vehicle. Convenient location. Would definitely stay here again. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 October 2011 $32 Park is on very small inlet of lake. Roads and sites are gravel. Sites are large with grass between. Water, power, and cell (AT&amp;T;) were good. Very modern bath and showers, but no privacy in changing rooms. Very nice meeting (small) room. Staff was friendly. We would camp here again. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 March 2011 $32 Brand new park on inlet to Lake Hamilton. Has spotless new restrooms, laundry, workout room, meeting room. Gravel drives and spaces. Spaces are a little tight but very well positioned. Plenty of room for large rigs and slides. Got satellite and their cable tV was good. Wi-Fi had a strong signal from site 25. Very helpful, friendly manager. Close to everything, yet quiet residential area. Would camp here again. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 July 2008 $30 The RV park has a beautiful setting right on the water and we enjoyed swimming. The problem is the park has been neglected and is run down. All the concrete pads are crumbling and all the wood docks next to the water are rotting. I talked to one of the campers who has a timeshare out there and he told me the place went through bankruptcy a few years back and is now under new ownership (Clearwater). They seem to be trying to do some repairs to some of the rv sites but they have a long ways to go to bring it up to a suitable park again. If you are at a RV site their is no cable or wireless internet unless you are parked right next to the office. We were down the hill next to the water but had no TV or internet. This is a real beautiful setting but has been severly neglected. Hopefully the new owners will give it the care it needs. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 June 2007 $30 Narrow entrance. Low hanging limbs over the access roads and over the sites. I could not park my 40 foot Motorhome on the pad because of low hanging limbs. We camped here in a Motorhome.

 2002 $15 This is an adult mobile home park that also has rv parking. Most of the adults appear to be older retired residents. Park is kept clean. Has no showers or restrooms. Cable and phone is not provided by park, but can be requested from local service. If you have sattelite you will want to request a site where you can use it as there are many pine trees. All sites are newly paved, mostly level with hookups very easy to access. Near mall, outlet mall, lakes, and lots of things to see and do. $15 night, $90 week, $235 month. Management helpful and friendly. I&apos;ve stayed here 5 weeks and will be back. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 June 2009 $25 If you like dogs running loose everywhere, dust flying constantly, tons of black biting flies, (presumably due to all the dog excrement), and Wi-Fi that nearly never worked: this is the RV park for you. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 February 2009 $25 Not too bad. Lots of people live there. Some nice pads by the water, some by the office and pool. Talked to the owner and he bought it a couple of years ago and lives in the office area. Nice guy he is trying to fix the place up for a resort. The lake area past the office is the place to be. I would return but by the lake. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 July 2010 $28 I would stay again, if I were to return to the Hot Springs area. The Good: Very easy and close access to Hot Springs. Friendly staff. Sites are pretty level and gravel. Plenty of shade. Not crowded Quiet Wi-Fi and Cable TV were both great. The Bad: Not an attractive park at all. Sites are kind of small. Our 35 foot barely fit into our spot, and parking our truck was a little difficult. Access to the lake is not good, unless you have a boat. Most of the campers in the park appear to be long term, and many of the campers appeared empty. Sort of has a mobile home park feel, and didn&apos;t seem like camping. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 June 2007 $28 You&apos;d think that will all of the amenities this place would be a camper&apos;s paradise. Think again. Dirty, noisy and ill-mannered and ill-tempered staff. This was their big motorcycle week and those people were friendly and helpful. Had the staff, particularly the management, been friendly and helpful we could have overlooked the issues. We planned on staying two weeks but left after 2 nights. This is a place sorely in need of new management. Ask any question about the area, restaurants, attractions and shopping and get a finger pointing to a rack and a surely comment like, &quot;There, if you know how to read.&quot; I do know how to read and this shows I know how to write as well. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.

 June 2006 $25 Good one for visiting the Hot Springs area. Easy to find off 270 by-pass. Easy to navigate and quiet park. Well worth the money. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.

 2002 $18 Extremely nice people. Clean park, level, grass over gravel. Close to bypass with some traffic noise. Away from shopping and downtown, but driveable in ten minutes or so. Would go back. We camped here in a camper.
