Drew Bledsoe’s career marked by brilliance, frustration for New England Patriots fans: A fan’s take
 
By Scott Duhaime , Yahoo! Contributor Network Friday, Sep 23, 2011 
 
On Sept. 16, the New England Patriots Hall of Fame welcomed two new members into its fraternity. The name spotlighted was that of former quarterback Drew Bledsoe. The ceremony represented the celebration of an accomplished career that instilled fan optimism along with criticism in the 1990s.



I was one of the fans who saw the positive aspects of the four-time Pro Bowler&apos;s career, in spite of the many times where I was left frustrated at his and the team&apos;s eventual outcome.

Bledsoe arrived in New England as the top pick in the 1993 draft out of Washington State. After a pedestrian rookie season under the scrutinizing eye of coach Bill Parcells, Bledsoe would highlight a 5-11 Patriots season with a final-game performance where he would pass for 329 yards and four touchdowns in a 33-27 win against the Miami Dolphins .



The 1994 season was the true coming out party for Bledsoe, as he followed up his rookie season with a league-best 400 completions for 4,555 yards as the Patriots won 10 games. The season was be filled in with personal accomplishments as Patriots&apos;quarterback set an NFL single-game record of 70 pass attempts as the team came from behind to beat the Minnesota Vikings in overtime. The win was the first of six straight that propelled the team into the playoffs for the first time in eight seasons.



After a disappointing 1995 season, fan expectations were mixed in for 1996. In spite of an improved running game, Bledsoe would still lead the league in pass attempts, completions and yards, while doubling his touchdown total and finish with a career-best passer rating. The Patriots would finish the season with a 11-5 record and make it all the way to the second Super Bowl appearance in team history, eventually losing to another aggressive, young passing talent, Brett Favre (notes) . 



The Patriots would follow the Super Bowl season with three disappointing seasons, including two straight playoff appearances under new head coach Pete Carroll, each time advancing one step fewer than the year before. Bledsoe would continue to put up volume statistics but his efficiency and accuracy would decline along with the team&apos;s record. Fans would respond with an outpouring of criticism for the game management and decision-making ability of their franchise quarterback.



The 2000 season, under new head coach Bill Belichick, would result in a renaissance of sorts, improving his accuracy and touchdown-to-interception ratio in spite of the team&apos;s a 5-11 record. In 2001, the season appeared to be more of the same as the Patriots were losing their second straight game to start the season. During a violent sideline collision against the Jets, Bledsoe would suffer a chest injury and be removed from the game. That injury set in motion a sequence of events that would turn the team and their star quarterback&apos;s fates around.



Backup quarterback Tom Brady (notes) was inserted into the lineup and the team responded to the more conservative, game-management approach. The Patriots would win 11 of their final 14 games and earn a playoff berth. Even when healthy enough to return to the lineup, Belichick would stay with Brady as the team performed better under his leadership. During the time away, Bledsoe would say little about not playing at a time when most quarterbacks would argue that their starting job should not be lost to injury.



In one lasting moment in a Patriots uniform, Bledsoe would be inserted into action due to an injury to Brady in the conference championship game against the Pittsburgh Steelers . As if never missing a snap all season, Bledsoe would step in and lead the team to a decisive touchdown drive that was culminated with a perfect touch pass in the end zone. Helping win the AFC championship and another trip to the Super Bowl would be the final glimpse for the fans of Bledsoe&apos;s productive but inconsistent career, as Brady would return for the Super Bowl and lead the team to an upset win over heavily favored St. Louis Rams .



Following the Super Bowl win, Bledsoe would be traded to division rival Buffalo Bills . Upon leaving New England, Bledsoe would take a full-page ad out in the local paper thanking the Patriot fans for their support during his career. Given the mixed response that he would garner during his time with New England, it was a truly classy act as he embarked on the next stage of his career.



The results in Buffalo would again be mixed, as Bledsoe would have moments of brilliance but the team would continue to struggle. His three seasons in Buffalo resulted in declining statistics, and the Bills would win just nine games in his final season in Buffalo but would fail in leading his new team to the playoffs.



Bledsoe would reunite with his first professional coach Bill Parcells in Dallas for the 2005-06 seasons, but would see his career end in Dallas much like it did in New England. In 2006, Bledsoe would be replaced as the starter after six games by third-year pro Tony Romo (notes) , who would lead the team to the playoffs. Quietly in the offseason, Bledsoe would announce his retirement. Much like his departure from New England and true to his personality, there was little fan fare regarding his leaving.



As a fan of Bledsoe, I had the good fortune of meeting the man at the peak of his popularity, and he kindly thanked me for my support. He offered no air of superiority; just a warm humble gesture of appreciation to someone who expressed gratitude for his contributions to the team and wishing him well. In the face of criticism, he never lashed back at the fans, instead maintaining a quiet composure regardless of whether he was successful or struggling.



Fan reaction to Bledsoe is still mixed years after his departure from New England, as best evidenced by the sarcasm that was directed toward me a few years back by an elderly man at a nearby fast food restaurant. To my shock, the animated senior in his bright canary yellow Sunday-best attire would scream to me,&quot;You have some nerve wearing that Bledsoe jersey around here, buddy!&quot;The fact that simply wearing a player&apos;s jersey would solicit such a reaction still sticks with me to this very day. Shortly thereafter, I stopped wearing the jersey in public as to not incite more animosity.



I write with great pride that there are others that have an appreciation for the contributions of Drew Bledsoe as evidenced by the honor bestowed upon him by his former team. I still look back to those days when Bledsoe would carry the team&apos;s offense (and the fan&apos;s expectations) on his shoulders.



For better or worse, the decade of the 1990s could have turned out far different had he not been with the Patriots then. Whether those days would have been better is a matter of speculation, and likely to align with the reaction given to him when he was the face of the franchise.



 Scott Duhaime is a fan and follower of the New England Patriots for over 30 years, witnessing the team&apos;s ascent from league irrelevance to among the league&apos;s elite franchises. His professional career includes a solid foundation of analytics that contributes to a better appreciation of player and team contributions.

Bledoe is still my favorite Patriot of all time. People forget how truly awful the Pat&apos;s were prior to him coming on board. Drew was a huge piece leading to the sucess the Pat&apos;s have enjoyed over the last 10 to 15 years. 3 users liked this comment Please sign in to rate this comment up.

I wish his tenure in New England could have ended a little different but he always handled everything like a pro. Tom Brady is a better fit into the New England&quot;system&quot;but Drew will always be a favorite of mine. A classy classy guy.

He deserves proper recognition for his commitment to the Patriots. As a quarter back he hurt himself by not keeping his ball flight down in the numbers. Too ofter he hung his receivers out high and open for big hits. In the end the receivers grew shorter arms resulting in too many incomplete passes. 1 users liked this comment Please sign in to rate this comment up.

Congrats on the NEHOF and thanks for everything! We wouldn&apos;t be anywhere near where we are now without #11! 2 users liked this comment Please sign in to rate this comment up.

To me he was the cornerstone building block that set Tom up,down his historic run as qb. He was all&quot;Class&quot;on the sidelines,while watching Tom emerge as an elite qp,never winning that he wasn&apos;t playing!
It was a given that he&apos;d make NEHOF! 2 users liked this comment Please sign in to rate this comment up.

He was a class act through his NFL career. I still have 2 Bledsoe jerseys myself, I don&apos;t wear them much. But they always serve as a reminder of where the Pats were then and now and how they evolved into an elite franchise. I have been a Patriot fan for 27 years and the Bledsoe era wasn&apos;t a total downward spiral,he had some great games mixed in. And the Terry Glenn rookie year will probably always be one of my favorite seasons even though they fell a bit short in the big game.
