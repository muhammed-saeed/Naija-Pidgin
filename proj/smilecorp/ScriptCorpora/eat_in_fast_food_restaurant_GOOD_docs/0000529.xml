TO THE READER. 

The notes in the present edition of Martial were for the 
most part written in the years 1862 — 1863. Mj late 
lamented friend and former pupil, Mr. Stone^ scholar of 
Trinity College, had consented to join me in the attempt 
(no light one, we were well aware) to produce such an 
edition of this poet as might be found suitable both for 
school reading and for general use. He entered into his 
work with great enthusiasm, and devoted much time and 
labour to his allotted portion of the task. An excellent 
and promising scholar, and a keen admirer of Martial, 
whom he justly regarded as the greatest wit as well as 
the most accomplished and artistic versifier of antiquity, 
he had not only made himself master of his author, but 
he had read a good deal for the express purposes of illus- 
tration and explanation. His notes were placed in my 
hands, after his early decease, not indeed fully finished, 
nor as he himself intended them for publication, yet in 
such an advanced state that I have been able to avail 
myself of them as far as they went. 
In considering how we might best satisfy a want that

all scholars admit — for it is a remarkable fact, ttat no 
complete edition of Martial with explanatory notes has 
ever appeared, either in England or in Germany, since 
the &apos;Variorum&apos; editions of nearly two centuries ago, 
which, even when they can be procured, are behind the 
requirements of the age,— one principal difficulty pre- 
sented itself. However brilliant the wit, however valu- 
able the details of domestic Roman life and of Roman 
topography, and however admirable the poetry and the 
latinity of Martial, there is this valid ground of objection 
to the use of his epigrams in schools, that not less than a 
fourth part of them is exceedingly gross, and quite unfit 
for general reading. The same, indeed, may justly be said 
of Catullus, Juvenal, Aristophanes, and some others; 
but the remedy of expurgation has long ago been so far 
applied to them, as to make them not only endurable, 
but highly popular in schools. Now selection, which is 
the plan we resolved upon, has obvious advantages over 
expurgation; and it is fortunate that of all authors 
Martial most readily admits of selection, because each 
epigram is quite complete in itself*. Since, however, 
many of the epigrams are very difficult, and require a 
large amount of illustration, we feared that it would be 
found impossible to include in one moderately sized volume 
all the residue, i. e. all the really readable epigrams. We 
were compelled, therefore, to select ag^in from these ; and 
that was a task in itself requiring a good deal of time and 
judgment. Having agreed, in common consultation, as to 

* Very rarely — perhaps in half-a-dozen instances — we have omitted 
a line or two from the epigrams ^ven in this series. 



TO THE READER. ▼ 

the particulai* epigrams we would admit (aud be it under- 
stood, we have omitted hardly any of the readable sort 
which can fairly be considered important, excluding, how- 
ever, not without regret, the very interesting distichs, about 
350 in number, composing the thirteenth and foui-teenth 
books), it only remained to mark them in our respective 
editions, and work upon them by reference to our own 
numbers. Thus, we uniformly quote the number and 
verse of&lt;mr collection, as a shorter and more convenient 
method than the full reference to book, epigram, and 
verse, except in the tolerably numerous cases where 
epigrams not in our series are referred to or cited for the 
sake of illustration. Once made, it is obvious that the 
numbering of our epigrams could not be altered without 
throwing all our references into confusion. I hope that 
this plan will be thought, on the whole, the best that 
could &quot;be adopted. I think that to have produced a 
readable edition of the best parts of such a poet, fit to be 
placed in the hands of all, with a brief heading to each 
epigram to explain the general drift of it, and with such 
notes as will suffice for every purpose of explanation, will 
be thought a useful expenditure of labour. 

My own time has been so much taken up with other 
classical work of late years, that I have advanced but 
slowly with these notes, though I have never laid them 
entirely aside. Still, all that time I have been reading and 
teaching Martial, and thus learning him better and better. 
And of this I have long been satisfied — that there is no 
Latin poet that would take such extensive illustration, if 
the learning of an editor or the limits of his work would

allow of its application. This is probably the real reasoD 
which has&quot; deterred even German scholars from under- 
taking complete editions of Martial. It would be easy 
to name some two dozen epigrams in this volume, on 
which alone hundreds of pages of notes might have been 
written. We found it a difficult task to say only just so 
much, or rather so little, as should suffice to make each 
epigram fairly intelligible in itself. If we have erred at 
all, it has been on the side of deficiency ; but any other 
plan than that we have followed would probably have 
defeated the object we had at heart, viz. to bring Martial 
into the series of Roman poets usually read in our schools. 

There are three books especially which we have used 
constantly as references ; so constantly indeed, that I 
must almost ask the student of Martial in this edition to 
have them at hand. These are — 

1. Becker&apos;s * Gallus,* translated by the Rev. F. Met- 
calfe ; a work very largely devoted to the illustration of 
Martial, and quite essential to the right understanding of 

, the poet. The words given in Becker&apos;s index, as ex- 
plained in the body of the work, in themselves form 
almost a glossary to Martial. 

2. The * Illustrated Companion to the Latin Dictionary 
and Greek Lexicon,&apos; by Anthony Rich, Jun., B.A. This 
is, in my opinion, one of the most valuable contributions 
ever made in this country to classical school literature. 
I have used it for years, and I more and more admire and 
appreciate the accuracy, the learning, the artistic feeling, 
and the great value and beauty of its numerous illustra- 
tions. Like the work before mentioned, it is not only 



TO THE READER. i^ii 

important^ but almost necessary for the student of 
Martial. 

3. Thirteen Satires of Juvenal, by the Rev. J. E. B. 
Mayor, M.A. I need say nothing Airther in praise of this 
well-known work, than that it is one of the few classical 
editions that have emanated from this University, which 
can fairly vie in the immensity of its erudition with the 
German commentaries. Of all the Roman poets, Juvenal 
most directly illustrates MartiaL In very many cases 
I have merely referred to a note of Mr. Mayor&apos;s, where 
the student will at once find all the information, or at 
least all the references, he can possibly desire. 

From the seventh volume of Mr. Merivale&apos;s * History 
of the Romans under the Empire,&apos; (under the life and 
times of the Emperor Domitian), an explanation of the 
historical allusions to the wars and other political events 
of the period will be most readily and conveniently 
obtained. 

Nothing indeed more curiously illustrates the force of&amp;shion, and the routine of school teaching, than the fact 
that Juvenal, a contemporary and friend of Martial, and 
quite as liable to the charge of grossness ^ has always 
been read in our schools and colleges, and that at least a 
dozen good school editions exist of that poet, while Mar- 
tial has remained, to ordinary students, almost unread 
and unknown. And yet it is impossible to speak too 
highly of the merits of Martial, if Roman poets are to be 

&apos; Of conrse, th^re is a difference between satirizing vice and 
glorying in it. For school reading, however, the difference is not 
very important. 



viii TO THE READER. 

read at all. His wit is of that peculiarly pointed and 
brilliant kind which must be felt to be appreciated — it is 
wit in the very highest and most perfect definition of it. 
A single word at the end of an epigram, perhaps, con- 
tains the whole point of the thing ; or a double entendre^ 
or a turn irapa irpoahoKiavy different from what you though 
was to come, gives the colour and expression to the epi 
gram. Of course, those minds (and there are such) 
which do not appreciate wit, may find more genial exer- 
cise than in reading Martial. But it is as an elegiac poet 
that I particularly wish to commend to all the study of 
Martial. If Latin verse-writing is to hold its place in 
schools, no model can be found superior in elegance and 
versatility to Martial. Although fun is his liking, pathos 
is his forte. Many of his epigrams breathe the most 
exquisite tones of sentiment and affection. A perfect 
master of latinity, he could describe the dishes of a 
Roman dinner, the follies of a Roman fop, the furniture 
of a bath, or the picturesque site of a villa, the decease 
of a favourite vema, or the tears of a mother over her 
infant&apos;s grave, with equal reality and felicity of expres- 
sion. His chief weakness was one that he had in common 
with nearly every Roman poet under the empire — abject 
servility and fulsome flattery of the man on the im- 
perial throne, whom he calls his *lord and his god&apos;.&apos; 
Living, however, in the reign of Domitian, he had the 
excuse of a kind of necessity. None were then safe 
who did not flatter ; every man of note purchased his life 

s £p. 219. 1, &apos;edictoin domini deiqae nostri.&apos;

at the cost of his mdependence*. &apos;Quid si per qoin- 
decim annos,&apos; asks Tacitus*, *grande mortalis aevi 
spatiunij multi fortuitis casibus, promptissimu« quisque 
saevitia principis, intercidenint ? Pauci, ut ita dixeriin, 
non modo alionun sed etiam nostri superstites sumus, 
exemptis e media vita tot annis, quibus juvenes ad 
senectutem, senes prope ad ipsos exactae aetatis ter- 
mines per silentium venimus.&apos; Like Tacitus, Martial 
lived to see, and wrote to praise, the happier reigns of 
Nerva and Trajan. If Martial was a sensualist, he was 
a Roman among Romans that lived the same lives them- 
selves, and praised and bought epigrams bearing most 
imdisguisedly on the fashionable vices ®. But in Martial 
we have a great mixture of the bad with the good. If 
we have placed the latter in the hands of the yoi\ng with- 
out the fear of scandal from the former, I think that we 
shall have served in some degree the cause of Roman 
literature. 

It only remains to add, that we have adopted in this 
edition the excellent and carefully revised text of F. G. 
Schneidewin (Teubner, 1853), which, being founded on a 
collation of all the best MSS., is as good a one as can be 
obtained, or even desired. In three or four places, per- 
haps, we have ventured slightly to modify the punctuation.

X TO THE READER. 

The edition of Martial by Lemaire (Paris, 1825), in three 
vols, octavo, has been consulted throughout ; but it does 
not contain very much more than the * Variorum&apos; editions, 
of which I have chiefly used that by Schrevelius, a sound 
and learned work, and hitherto almost the only one with 
notes available for ordinary students, though first pub- 
lished as long ago as 1666.

A BRIEF NOTICE 

07 THI 

LIFE AND WRITINGS OF THE POET. 

Mabcus Valerius Mabtialis was a native of Bilbilis, 
on the river Sale, a confluent of the Ebro. This town 
was situated picturesquely on a hill side, partly sur- 
rounded by the Salo, and not very far distant from the 
sources of the Tagus ; it was famous for the manufacture 
of steel, to which the waters of the Salo were supposed 
to give a peculiar temper *. By birth a Spaniard, a com- 
patriot of Lucan the poet and the two Senecas &apos;, it is not 
certain whether Martial was of naturalized Roman parent- 
age, or a native Celt. He speaks indeed of his stiff 
and uncurling Spanish hair &apos;, and often of his * Celti- 
berian descent.&apos; It appears, however, from Pliny (N. H. 
iii. 3, § 24), that Celtiberia, including the Behlitani or 
Bilbilttani, was a Roman Colonia ; it is therefore pro- 
bable that Martial&apos;s parents were Spaniards, who had

spect, and the singular process they employed, are described by 
Diodoms Siculus, v. 33.

the privileges of the Roman civitas. The gens Valeria 
reckoned other poets of note, among whom were Caius 
Valerius Catullus and Caius Valerius Flaccus, the author 
of the Argonautica, The cognomen Martialis may have 
reference to the circumstance that he was born on the 
Kalends of March *. The date of his birth is commonly 
placed at a.d. 43 ; but as he calls himself fifty-seven 
years old in the tenth book *, which appears to have been 
written in Nerva&apos;s reign *, a.d. 96 — 97, his birth would 
seem to have been somewhat earlier, viz. a.d. 39 — 40. 
Though he came to Rome at an eaily age, and com- 
menced writing epigrams even as a boy \ he retained a 
vivid recollection of, and a strong liking for, the pic- 
turesque scenery and the easy as well as economical life 
that he had enjoyed in his native town. Many epigrams 
allude to it, and in one ® we have a description of Bilbilis, 
characterized by great feeling and the keenest sense of 
the pleasures and beauties of the country. 

After a long residence at Rome, he returned *an old 
man &apos;,&apos; as he calls himself, to Bilbilis, from which he had 
been absent (except, perhaps, in occasional visits) thirty- 
four years ^ At Rome the poet formed a friendship with 
many of the illustrious men and authors of the day — Lucan, 
Juvenal, Valerius Flaccus, Pliny the Younger, Quinti- 
lian. Statins, Silius Italicus,&amp;c., and many others of 
wealth and influence whom he addresses in his epigrams*

OF THE POET. xiii 

B7 the Emperor Domitian, whom he every where flatters 
with a servility that sounds to our ears positively ridi- 
culous, he was held in high estimation as an author; 
and he was also patronized by two very influential 
members of the emperor&apos;s household, Parthenius and 
Burrus. Prisons Terentius, Stella the poet, Faustinus, 
Julius Cerealis, Julius Proculus, Julius Martialis, Atedius 
Melior*, were also among his wealthy patrons; and from 
some of these, or perhaps in part from tlie sale of his 
poems, which were very successful, both in Rome and 
in all the provinces&apos;, he obtained a farm and villa, to 
which he often alludes, at Nomentum, on the borders of 
the Sabine territory. A frequent theme in Martial&apos;s epi- 
grams is the games in the amphitheatre, i. e. in the great 
Colosseum then recently erected; in the collection of 
epigrams commonly prefixed to the editions, and known 
as *jLiber Spectaculorum,&apos; or *De Spectaculis Libellus&apos; 
(though the genuineness of them is rather doubtful), 
this is exclusively the subject. The information to be 
derived from these, both as to the kinds of beasts im- 
ported to Rome, to be either baited or exhibited, and the 
marvellous degree of taming to which even lions and 
wild bulls were brought, is as curious as it is copious and 
Taluable. The emperor, as we know also from Suetonius *, 
took the greatest interest in these exhibitions, as well as 
in the games in the Circus. To flatter and please him, 
Martial would do and say any thing. Among the marks 
of favour he obtained from Domitian were the jus trium 
Uberorum * (which at this time, as in Trajan&apos;s reign ^, was

sometimes given merely as a privilege), a tiiboneship^ 
and the rights of equestrian rank *, though he was not a 
Justus equesy i. e. had not the full equestrian census. So 
popular had Martial&apos;s writings hecome at Rome, that he 
had many plagiarists and detractors to contend against, 
of both of whom he often speaks with great bitterness &apos;. 
The usual way by which young poets at this time came 
into notice, was by giving public recitations. We know 
from Juvenal (vii. 83) that Statins invited his friends to 
a hearing, &apos; promisitque diem,&apos; when he had completed 
his Thebais. That Martial did the same at first, is clear 
from his complaint &apos; that the friends, who ostentatiously 
copied down his epigrams at the time, by way of com- 
pliment, did not show the same fondness for them after- 
wards. It was in this way that plagiarists used to 
appropriate the verses of others. This the poet charges 
one Fidentinus with doing (i. 29) : — 

&apos; Fama refert nostros te, Fidentine, libellos 
Non aliter popalo quam recitare tuos. 
Si mea vis did, gratis tibi carmina mittam ; 
Si dici tua vis, en, erne, ne mea sint/ 

And he not unfrequently ^ jokes on selling to plagiarists 
verses of his own that have never been recited ; whereby 
he shows up their impudence in appropriating those 
which had. Of criticism he was, or affected to be, very 
timid, and he often asks the patronage or friendly re- 

^ See iii. 95. 9, &apos; vidit me Boma tribunum, £t sedeo qua te snscitat 
Oceanus/ i. e. in the fourteen ordines. The privilege of the jus trium 
Uberorum was this : a father of three children was free from all per- 
sonal taxes, and had a prior claim to all magisterial dignities and 
remunerative posts in the administration; and in such posts, for 
which a certain age was required, each child was considered equal to 
one year in the computation of the f^^e of the father.&gt;See, for example, Epp. 28, 32, 509, 511.

vision ot those whose judgment and friendship he could 
trust *. Latterly, he seems to have preferred publishing 
a separate book on the occasion of the Saturnalia^, 
which corresponded nearly with our Christmas festivities. 
Another constant subject of complaint is the loss of 
time and the weariness and unprofitableness of the city- 
life of a togatus, or client. He cannot, he says, both 
&quot;write epigrams and attend levies *, 

The great reges were probably desirous to number a 
man of such note as the poet among the anteambulones 
and the attendants on their sella. But he severely 
satirizes the smallness of the sportula, and the insult 
of dining with a patron at the same table indeed, but on 
inferior fare*. Of Martial&apos;s life as a * gay man&apos; there is, 
unfortunately, too much evidence, though not much of it 
wUI appear in the collection of epigrams in this voliune. 
Of his married life we know very little. Only twice* he 
alludes, and with great affection, to Marcella, a Spanish 
lady ; but it does not seem quite certain whether she 
was a first or a second wife. All we have to judge of 
are these words (656. 7) — * 

&apos;post septima lustra reverse 
Hob Marcella lares parvaque regna ded&apos;t.&apos; 

This sounds like the I^anguage of a man who is returning 

to the wife of his youth after thirty-five years absence. 

On the other hand, in 649. 7, in speaking of the same 

lady, 

* Nee cite ridebit peregrini gloria partus, 
Bomanam deceat quam magis esse nurum/

he would seem to praise the good looks of a young and 
buxom wife. Again, in xi. 104. 1, 

* Uxor, vade foras, aut moribus utere nostria/ 

in which he goes on to speak with some aversion of the 
person meant^ as a prude and uncongenial to him, a doubt 
remains whether the character is not merely feigned for 
the sake of remarks of not very moral tone. It is more 
probable, perhaps, that on his return to Spain without 
much money but with some fame, he married the widow 
of some honest burgher of Bilbilis. That he had no 
legitimate children may be inferred from Ep. 108 — 

* Natorum mihi jus trium roganti 
Musaram pretium dedit mearnm 
Solus qui poterat. Valebis, uxor ; 
Non debet domini perire munus.* 

Yet here again some allowance must be made for words 
of flattery ; and in Ep. 288. 10, *possunt et patres vivere, 
crede mihi,&apos; the reference may be to himself as having 
^offspring. 

Among the infinity of subjects illustrating in tiie 
minutest manner the details of domestic Roman life, we 
have many allusions to that of books, as the transcrip-

OF THE POET xvii 

Not much uncertainty exists as to the dales and places 
at which the hooks were written. The first nine were 
published at Rome in the course of twelve years, as the 
poet himself says •, in the reign of Domitian. The first, 
however, seems to have been brought out after the second 
and third ; for in ii. 93 he says to a friend, * You ask where 
book i. is, when this is book ii. ;&apos; and in Ep. 109, in in- 
troducing the third book, as written in Gallia Togata, 
he speaks of * librum priorem,&apos; not as * libros priores.&apos; 
And yet in Ep. 2 he addresses his book as an author 
would who was about to appear first before the public. 
Inconsistently with this, he commences his first book 
with a somewhat boastful vaunt — 

* Hie est quern legis ille, quern requiris, 
Toto notus in orbe Martialis 
Argutis epigrammaton libellis.&apos; 

Prom which it would seem that the first book was either 
brought out later, or added to in a subsequent edition. 
The tenth book was published in the short period (little 
more than a year) during wiiich Nerva wore the imperial 
purple. The eleventh and twelfth appeared during Tra- 
jan&apos;s reign, the latter, as the poet distinctly says, in a 
letter to Priscus Terentius, prefixed to the book, after an 
interval of three years&apos; idleness, * triennis desidia.&apos; This 
book was written in Spain. Some of the epigrams in 
the * Book of Games &apos; were probably written in the time 
of Titus, who had completed and dedicated the great 

• Ep. 492. 9, * omne tibi ncstrum quod bis trieteride juncta Ante 
dabat lector, nunc dabit auctor opus.&apos; (Lib. ix. Ep. 84.) Schneidewin 
(Praef. p. iii.) says, * libri novem priores Domitiano imperante editi 
nmt inter annos Ixxxii et xcv post Christum.&apos; If so, we must in-

Colosseum (which appears to be referred to in Ep. 522. 7 
as * theatrum&apos;). 

In writing epigrams Martial did not profess to be the 
founder of the style, in the sense that Horace claimed to 
have introduced lyric verse into Latium. On the con- 
trary, he preferred to follow Catullus, Marsus, and Pedo 
Albinovanus : 

* Sit locus et nostris aliqua tibi parte libellis, 
Qua Pedo, qua Marsus, quaque Catullus erit,* 

he says (Ep. 216) in writing to a friend ; of Catullus 
especially he often expresses his admiration ^ In some 
sense it may be said, as Dr. Smith observes (Classical 
Diet.), that &apos;he first placed the epigram upon the 
narrow basis which it now occupies, and from his time 
the term has been in a great measure restricted to denote 
a short poem, in which all the thoughts and expressions 
converge to one sharp point, which forms the termina- 
tion of the piece.&apos; In point of fact, however, many of 
the epigrams of Catullus resemble those of Martial both 
in their character and their length ; and it is but fair 
to regard Catullus as the first Roman epigrammatist. 
Martial as clearly and avowedly imitated him as Persius 
did Horace. 

It would be unfair to regard Martial merely as a 
composer of lampoons in verse, or esteem him only as a 
satirist or a wit, though he occupies the first place in 
both these respects. He was a poet of more than ordi- 
nary merit, certainly the first of the age in which he lived. 
His style has a singular charm from its ever-varying

fat3Tmdas,&amp;c., are applied to hiid. * 



OF THE POET. xix 

freshness and brilliancy ; in lucidness and appropriateness 
of expression it is surpassed by none. He is neither heavy 
nor turgid, as Silius Italicus, Statins, and Lucan too often 
are ; and though he lived and wrote in what is called the 
Silver Age of Roman literature, the purity of the Latinity 
is as remarkable in Martial as in the letters of the younger 
Pliny. No author, perhaps, when once understood, is 
more likely or more deserving to become a lasting 
favourite with those who have a natural taste for wit, 
sarcasm, and repartee. The conditions of understanding 
Martial are an accurate and extensive knowledge of 
Roman topography and archaeology. To the science of 
these his writings in themselves contribute, as has aheady 
been intimated, as much, perhaps, as all the rest of the 
Roman poets taken together. 

The death of the poet — or at least the report of his 
death — is bewailed by Pliny in an interesting letter, 
Epist. iii. 21. &apos;I hear,&apos; he says, * of the decease of 
Valerius Martialis, and am sorry for it. He was a man 
of genius, acute and keen, and one who in his writings 
showed the greatest amount of wit, gall, and yet fairness&apos; 
(candoris). He quotes in this letter ten verses from book 
X. 19 (Ep. 522. 12 — 21), and concludes with these re- 
markable words : * What can be given to a man greater 
than glory, praise, and eternity ? Perhaps, however, his 
writings will not last for ever. Perhaps they will not : 
yet he wrote them with the impression that they would.&apos; 
How justly Pliny estimated the hopes and the ambition 
of our poet, may be seen from Epp. 224. 4, and 389. 5, 6; 
508. 7,&amp;c. What Pliny calls his fairness is shown by the 
repeated protests which the poet makes against the 
charge of illnature, brought by his enemies against his 
more satirical epigrams. &apos;Absit a jocorum nostrorum 
simplicitate malignus interpres, nee epigranmiata mea 



XX LIFE AND WRITINGS OF THE POET. 

Bcribat,&apos; he says in an epistolary address or preface to 
the first book ; and again (Ep. 509. 9)— 

&apos; Procul a libellis nigra sit meis fama, 
Quos rumor alba gemmeus vehit pinna.&apos; 

His death took place a.d. 102 — 104, in Trajan&apos;s time. 
The exact year it is difficult to determine. Schneidewm 
(Praef. p. iii.) places the date of his last work, the twelfth 
book, between a.d. 96 and 102, and believes that Books 
xiii. and xiv. were composed somewhat earlier at Rome.

against tyranny, still thought it wiser and better to live, even in hard times. 
From i. 39, which is a eulogy on Decianus, we infer that he was a man of 
the old Republican stamp, Teamed in the eloquence both of Athens and of 
Latium, simple-hearted, nonest, and magnanimous.

he would seem to praise the good looks of a young and

* Uxor, vade foras, aut moribus utere nostris/ 

in which he goes on to speak with some aversion of the 
person meant, as a prude and uncongenial to him, a doubt 
remains whether the character is not merely feigned for 
the sake of remarks of not very moral tone. It is more 
probable, perhaps, that on his return to Spain without 
much money but with some fame, he married the widow 
of some honest burgher of Bilbilis. That he had no

offspring. 

Among the infinity of subjects illustrating in the

a written copy of one of Martial&apos;s books could be bought 
considerably cheaper than a printed one now could, viz. 
for about fourpence-halfpenny, and with a profit to the

OF THE POET xvii 

Not much uncertainty exists as to the dates and places 
at which the books were written. The first nine were 
published at Rome in the course of twelve years, as the 
poet himself says *, in the reign of Domitian. The first, 
however, seems to have been brought out after the second 
and third ; for in ii. 93 he says to a fnend, * You ask where 
book i. is, when this is book ii. ;&apos; and in Ep. 109, in in- 
troducing the third book, as written in Gallia Togata, 
he speaks of * librum priorem,* not as * libros priores.&apos; 
And yet in Ep. 2 he addresses his book as an author 
would who was about to appear first before the public. 
Inconsistently with this, he commences his first book 
with a somewhat boastful vaunt — 

&apos; Hie est quern legis ille, qnem reqnirisy 
Toto notus in orbe Martialis 
Argntis epigrammaton libellis.&apos; 

From which it would seem that the fii&apos;st book was either 
brought out later, or added to in a subsequent edition. 
The tenth book was published in the short period (little 
more than a year) during wnich Nerva wore the imperial 
purple. The eleventh and twelfth appeared during Tra- 
jan&apos;s reign, the latter, as the poet distinctly says, in a 
letter to Prisons Terentius, prefixed to the book, after an 
interval of three years&apos; idleness, * triennis desidia.&apos; This 
book was written in Spain. Some of the epigrams in 
the * Book of Games &apos; were probably written in the time 
of Titus, who had completed and dedicated the great 

* Ep. 492. 9, * omne tibi ncstrum quod bis trieteride juncta Ante

In writing epigrams Martial did not profess to be the 
founder of the style, in the sense that Horace claimed to 
have introduced lyric verse into Latium. On the con- 
trary, he preferred to follow Catullus, Marsus, and Pedo 
Albinovanus : 

&apos; Sit locus et nostris aliquk tibi parte libellis, 
Qua Pedo, qua Marsus, qoaque Catullus erit,* 

he says (Ep. 216) in writing to a friend ; of Catullus 
especially he often expresses his admiration \ In some 
sense it may be said, as Dr. Smith observes (Classical 
Diet.), that *he first placed the epigram upon the 
narrow basis which it now occupies, and from his time 
the term has been in a great measure restricted to denote 
a short poem, in which all the thoughts and expressions 
converge to one sharp point, which forms the termina- 
tion of the piece.&apos; In point of fact, however, many of 
the epigrams of Catullus resemble those of Martial both 
in their character and their length ; and it is but fair 
to regard Catullus as the first Roman epigrammatist. 
Martial as clearly and avowedly imitated him as Persius 
did Horace. 

It would be unfair to regard Martial merely as a 
composer of lampoons in verse, or esteem him only as a 
satirist or a wit, though he occupies the first place in 
both these respects. He was a poet of more than ordi- 
nary merit, certainly the first of the age in which he lived. 
His style has a singular charm from its ever-varying

OF THE POET. xix 

freshness and brilliancy ; in lucidness and appropriateness 
of expression it is surpassed by none. He is neither heavy 
nor turgid, as Silius Italicus, Statins, and Lucan too often 
are ; and though he lived and wrote in what is called the 
Silver Age of Roman literature, the purity of the Latinity 
is as remarkable in Martial as in the letters of the younger 
Pliny. No author, perhaps, when once understood, is 
more likely or more deserving to become a lasting 
favourite with those who have a natural taste for wit, 
sarcasm, and repartee. The conditions of understanding 
Martial are an accurate and extensive knowledge of 
Roman topography and archaeology. To the science of 
these his writings in themselves contribute, as has aheady 
been intimated, as much, perhaps, as all the rest of the 
Roman poets taken together. 

The death of the poet — or at least the report of his 
death — is bewailed by Pliny in an interesting letter, 
Epist. iii. 21. * I hear,&apos; he says, * of the decease of 
Valerius Martialis, and am sorry for it. He was a man 
of genius, acute and keen, and one who in his writings 
showed the greatest amount of wit, gall, and yet fairness&apos; 
(candoris). He quotes in this letter ten verses from book 
X. 19 (Ep. 522. 12 — 21), and concludes with these re- 
markable words : * What can be given to a man greater 
than glory, praise, and eternity ? Perhaps, however, his 
writings will not last for ever. Perhaps they will not : 
I yet he wrote them with the impression that they would.&apos; 
How justly Pliny estimated the hopes and the ambition 
of our poet, may be seen from Epp. 224. 4, and 389. 5, 6; 
508. 7,&amp;c. What Pliny calls his fairness is shown by the 
repeated protests which the poet makes against the 
charge of illnature, brought by his enemies against his 
more satirical epigrams. * Absit a jocorum nostrorum 
omplicitate malignus interpres, nee epigranamata mea

the first book ; and again (Ep. 509. 9) — 

&apos; Procul a libellis nigra sit meis fama, 
Qaos rumor alba gemmeus vehit pinna.&apos; 

His death took place a.d. 102 — 104, in Trajan&apos;s time. 
The exact year it is difficult to determine. Schneidewm 
(Praef. p. iii.) places the date of his last work, the twelfth 
book, between a.d. 96 and 102, and believes that Books 
xiii. and xiv. were composed somewhat earlier at Rome.

To his friend and countryman Decianus (Ep. 31. 10), who, while pro- 
fessing to follow the principles of two famed stoics of past times, Paetus 
Thrasea and Cato of Utica, both of whom committed suicide with a protest 
against tyranny, still thought it wiser and better to live, even in hard times. 
From i. 39, which is a eulogy on Decianus, we infer that he was a man of 
the old Republican stamp. Teamed in the eloquence both of Athens and of 
Latium, simple-hearted, nonest, and magnanimous.

he would seem to praise the good looks of a young and 
buxom wife. Again, in xi. 104. 1, 

* Uxor, vade foras, aut moribus utere nostria/ 

in which he goes on to speak with some aversion of the 
person meant, as a prude and uncongenial to him, a doubt 
remains whether the character is not merely feigned for 
the sake of remarks of not very moral tone. It is more 
probable, perhaps, that on his return to Spain without 
much money but with some fame, he married the widow 
of some honest burgher of Bilbilis. That he had no 
legithnate children may be inferred from Ep. 108—&lt;Natomm mihi jus trium rogaotl

of flattery ; and in Ep. 288. 10, *possunt et patres vivere, 
crede mihi,&apos; the reference may be to himself as having 
offspring. 

Among the infinity of subjects illustrating in the 
minutest manner the details of domestic Roman life, we 
have many allusions to that of books, as the transcrip-

tus ?), Trypho, Polius Quintus &apos;. It is remarkable, that 
a written copy of one of Martial&apos;s books could be bought 
considerably cheaper than a printed one now could, viz. 
for about fourpence-halfpenny, and with a profit to the 
bookseller &apos;, as he expressly says.

OF THE POET xvii 

Not much uncertainty exists as to the dates and places 
at which the books were written. The first nine were 
published at Rome in the course of twelve years, as the 
poet himself says *, in the reign of Domitian. The first, 
however, seems to have been brought out after the second 
and third ; for in ii. 93 he says to a friend, * You ask where 
book i. is, when this is book ii. ;&apos; and in Ep. 109, in in- 
troducing the third book, as written in Gallia Togata, 
he speaks of * librum priorem,* not as * libros priores.* 
And yet in Ep. 2 he addresses his book as an author 
would who was about to appear first before the public. 
Inconsistently with this, he commences his first book 
with a somewhat boastful vaunt — 

&apos; Hie est quern legis ille, qnem reqnirisy 
Toto notus in orbe Martialis 
Argntis epigrammaton libellis.&apos; 

From which it would seem that the first book was either 
brought out later, or added to in a subsequent edition. 
The tenth book was published in the short period (little 
more than a year) during wnich Nerva wore the imperial 
purple. The eleventh and twelfth appeared during Tra- 
jan&apos;s reign, the latter, as the poet distinctly says, in a 
letter to Prisons Terentius, prefixed to the book, after an 
interval of three years&apos; idleness, * triennis desidia.&apos; This 
book was written in Spain. Some of the epigrams in 
the * Book of Games &apos; were probably written in the time 
of Titus, who had completed and dedicated the great

Colosseum (which appears to be referred to in Ep. 522. 7 
as * theatrum&apos;). 

In writing epigrams Martial did not profess to be the 
founder of the style, in the sense that Horace claimed to 
have introduced lyric verse into Latium. On the con- 
trary, he preferred to follow Catullus, Marsus, and Pedo 
Albinovanus : 

&apos; Sit locus et nostris aliqua tibi parte libellis, 
Qua Pedo, qua Marsua, quaque Catullus erit/ 

he says (Ep. 216) in writing to a friend ; of Catullus 
especially he often expresses his admiration \ In some 
sense it may be said, as Dr. Smith observes (Classical 
Diet.), that *he first placed the epigram upon the 
narrow basis which it now occupies, and from his time 
the term has been in a great measure restricted to denote 
a short poem, in which all the thoughts and expressions 
converge to one sharp point, which forms the termina- 
tion of the piece.&apos; In point of fact, however, many of 
the epigrams of Catullus resemble those of Martial both 
in their character and their length ; and it is but fair 
to regard Catullus as the first Roman epigrammatist. 
Martial as clearly and avowedly imitated him as Persius 
did Horace. 

It would be unfair to regard Martial merely as a 
composer of lampoons in verse, or esteem him only as a 
satirist or a wit, though he occupies the first place in 
both these respects. He was a poet of more than ordi- 
nary merit, certainly the first of the age in which he lived. 
His style has a singular charm from its ever-varying 

1 E. g. in Ep. 568. 16. The epithets doctas, tener, argntna, 
favTindoB,&amp;C., are appUed to hixA. &apos; 



OF THE POET. xix 

freshness and brilliancy ; in lucidness and appropriateness 
of expression it is surpassed by none. He is neither heavy 
nor turgid, as Silius Italicus, Statins, and Lucan too often 
are ; and though he lived and wrote in what is called the 
Silver Age of Roman literature, the purity of the Latinity 
is as remarkable in Martial as in the letters of the younger 
Pliny. No author, perhaps, when once understood, is 
more likely or more deserving to become a lasting 
favourite with those who have a natural taste for wit^ 
sai&apos;casm, and repartee. The conditions of understanding 
Martial are an accurate and extensive knowledge of 
Roman topography and archaeology. To the science of 
these his writings in themselves contribute, as has already 
been intimated, as much, perhaps, as all the rest of the 
Roman poets taken together. 

The death of the poet — or at least the report of his 
death — ^is bewailed by Pliny in an interesting letter, 
Epist. iii. 21. * I hear,&apos; he says, * of the decease of 
Valerius Martialis, and am sorry for it. He was a man 
of genius, acute and keen, and one who in his writings 
showed the greatest amount of wit, gall, and yet fairness&apos; 
(candoris). He quotes in this letter ten verses from book 
X. 19 (Ep. 522. 12 — 21), and concludes with these re- 
markable words : &apos; What can be given to a man greater 
than glory, praise, and eternity ? Perhaps, however, his 
writings will not last for ever. Perhaps they will not : 
yet he wrote them with the impression that they would.&apos; 
How justly Pliny estimated the hopes and the ambition 
of our poet, may be seen from Epp. 224. 4, and 389. 5, 6; 
508. 7,&amp;c. What Pliny calls his fairness is shown by the 
repeated protests which the poet makes against the 
charge of illnature, brought by his enemies against his 
more satirical epigrams. * Absit a jocorum nostroTUoi

he would seem to praise the good looks of a young and 
buxom wife. Again, in xi. 104. 1, 

* Uxor, vade foras, aut moribus utere nostria/ 

in which he goes on to speak with some aversion of the 
person meant^ as a prude and uncongenial to him, a doubt 
remains whether the character is not merely feigned for 
the sake of remarks of not very moral tone. It is more 
probable, perhaps, that on his return to Spain without 
much money but with some fame, he married the widow 
of some honest burgher of Bilbilis. That he had no 
legitimate children may be inferred from Ep. 108— 

* Natorum mihi jus trium roganti 
Musarum pretium dedit mearum 
Solus qui poterat. Yalebis, uxor ; 
Non debet domini perire munus.&apos; 

Yet here again some allowance must be made for words 
of flattery ; and in Ep, 288. 10, *possunt et patres vivere, 
crede mihi,&apos; the reference may be to himself as having 
offspring. 

Among the infinity of subjects illustrating in the 
minutest manner the details of domestic Roman life, we 
have many allusions to that of books, as the transcrip- 
tion, the price, the bindings, the presentation copies, the 
booksellers&apos; names,&amp;c., as Secundus, Atrectus (Atres- 
tus ?), Trypho, Polius Quintus ^ It is remarkable, that 
a written copy of one of Martial&apos;s books could be bought 
considerably cheaper than a printed one now could, viz. 
for about fourpence-halfpenny, and with a profit to the 
bookseller &quot;, as he expressly says.

OF THE POET xvii 

Not much uncertainty exists as to the dates and places 
at which the books were written. The first nine were 
published at Rome in the course of twelve years, as the 
poet himself says &quot;, in the reign of Domitian. The first, 
however, seems to have been brought out after the second 
and third ; for in ii. 93 he says to a friend, * You ask where 
book i. is, when this is book ii. ;&apos; and in Ep. 109, in in- 
troducing the third book, as written in Gallia Togata, 
he speaks of * librum priorem,&apos; not as * libros priores.&apos; 
And yet in Ep. 2 he addresses his book as an author 
would who was about to appear first before the public. 
Inconsistently with this, he commences his first book 
with a somewhat boastful vaunt — 

&apos; Hie est quern legis ille, qnem reqoiriiy 
Toto notus in orbe Martialis 
Argntis epigrammaton libellis.&apos; 

From which it would seem that the first book was either 
brought out later, or added to in a subsequent edition. 
The tenth book was published in the short period (little 
more than a year) during wnich Nerva wore the imperial 
purple. The eleventh and twelfth appeared during Tra- 
jan&apos;s reign, the latter, as the poet distinctly says, in a 
letter to Prisons Terentius, prefixed to the book, after an 
interval of three years&apos; idleness, * triennis desidia.&apos; This 
book was written in Spain. Some of the epigrams in 
the * Book of Games &apos; were probably written in the time 
of Titus, who had completed and dedicated the great 

9 Ep. 492. 9, * omne tibi ncstrum quod bis trieteride juncta Ante 
dabat lector, nunc dabit auctor opus.* (Lib. ix. Ep. 84.) Schneidewin

Colosseum (which appears to be referred to in Ep. 522. 7 
as * theatrum&apos;). 

In writing epigrams Martial did not profess to be the 
founder of the style, in the sense that Horace claimed to 
have introduced lyric verse into Latium. On the con- 
trary, he preferred to follow Catullus, Marsus, and Pedo 
Albinovanus : 

&apos; Sit locus et nostris aliqua tibi parte libellis, 
Qua Pedo, qua Marsu^ quaque Catullus erit/ 

he says (Ep. 216) in writing to a friend ; of Catullus 
especially he often expresses his admiration ^ In some 
sense it may be said, as Dr. Smith observes (Classical 
Diet.), that *he first placed the epigram upon the 
narrow basis which it now occupies, and from his time 
the term has been in a great measure restricted to denote 
a short poem, in which all the thoughts and expressions 
converge to one sharp point, which forms the termina- 
tion of the piece.&apos; In point of fact, however, many of 
the epigrams of Catullus resemble those of Martial both 
in their character and their length ; and it is but fair 
to regard Catullus as the first Roman epigrammatist. 
Martial as clearly and avowedly imitated him as Persius 
did Horace. 

It would be unfair to regard Martial merely as a 
composer of lampoons in verse, or esteem him only as a 
satirist or a wit, though he occupies the first place in 
both these respects. He was a poet of more than ordi- 
nary merit, certainly the first of the age in which he lived. 
His style has a singular charm from its ever-varying 

^ JE. g. m Ep. 568. 16. The epithets doctos, teuor, argntns 
f^&apos;anduB,&amp;c, are applied to bidL

freshness and brilliancy ; in lucidness and appropriateness 
of expression it is surpassed by none. He is neither heavy 
nor turgid, as Silius Italicus, Statins, and Lucan too often 
are ; and though he lived and wrote in what is called the 
Silver Age of Roman literature, the purity of the Latinity 
is as remarkable in Martial as in the letters of the younger 
Pliny. No author, perhaps, when once understood, is 
more likely or more deserving to become a lasting 
favourite with those who have a natural taste for wit, 
sarcasm, and repartee. The conditions of understanding 
Martial are an accurate and extensive knowledge of 
Roman topography and archaeology. To the science of 
these his writings in themselves contribute, as has aheady 
been intimated, as much, perhaps, as all the rest of the 
Roman poets taken together. 

The death of the poet — or at least the report of his 
death — is bewailed by Pliny in an interesting letter, 
Epist. iii. 21. *I hear,&apos; he says, *of the decease of 
Valerius Martialis, and am sorry for it. He was a man 
of genius, acute and keen, and one who in his writings 
showed the greatest amount of wit, gall, and yet fairness&apos; 
(candoris). He quotes in this letter ten verses from book 
X. 19 (Ep. 522. 12 — 21), and concludes with these re- 
markable words : * What can be given to a man greater 
than glory, praise, and eternity ? Perhaps, however, his 
writings will not last for ever. Perhaps they will not : 
yet he wrote them with the impression that they would.&apos; 
How justly Pliny estimated the hopes and the ambition 
of our poet, may be seen from Epp. 224. 4, and 389. 5, 6; 
508. 7,&amp;c. What Pliny calls his fairness is shown by the 
repeated protests which the poet makes against the 
charge of illnature, brought by his enemies against his 
more satirical epigrams. * Absit a jocorum nostYOXTJiCDL

His death took place a.d. 102 — 104, in Trajan&apos;s time.

acquire possession of a small farm, in which Fenius Telesphoiois, who was

Another epigram to the book, commending it to the favourable notice of

was probably written to accompany a copy sent as a present. The formal 
dedication to Faustinus in Ep. 110 is therefore different

An answer to one Quintus, who seems to have been offended by Ep. 115, 
and who denied that the object of his affection was one-eyed, or her name 
Tkais, The poet argues that TAais has only a fancied resemblance to the 
name LaiSy and he jocosely adds, that if Quintus does not like Thais, 
Sextos ma^ take her, by which he means, that the public will equally 
^ess who 18 meant, whether he be called Quintus or Sextus. 

Si tna nee Thais nee lusca est, Quinte, puella,

Gaums, petitioning his patron for a hundi&apos;ed sesterces to make up the 400 
necessary ; but his suit is unsuccessful, as the praetor pleads that ne has to 
pre laige sums of money to certain charioteers to pay for equestrian statues

ViUing to give to the horse and not to the knight. Cf. Ep. 234. 9.

Papilos was famed for the quality of his wine, but at the same time he 
had been a widower four times, so that a report cot about that his wines

this to be a fact; nevertheless, he is not athirst, i.e. he wiU not ride his 
life by drinking from that flask.

The poet lauds Yestinus (a son of the Yestinus killed by Nero in his 
consnlate, cf. Tac. Ann. xv. 68), for that on the point of death he liberally 
divided all his wealth among his friends. The motive for this may be 
inferred from Tac. Agric. 43 fin. 

Cum gravis extremas Vestinus duceret horas

In this elegant epigram the poet praises Nigrina for her love to her 
hoshand, on whom sne had bestowed her dowry, whereas by the Roman oaw 
a fafluband had no right to his wife&apos;s money unless he had children by her. 
For this love Martial praises her above Evadne and Alcestis, for they 
prored theirs by their death, Nigrina in her life.

A boastful slave, who has presumed on the strength of his cocciua

Domitian, when starting on his expedition against the Sarmatae or 
Daci, had caused a breast-plate to be made for him, similar to the fabled 
Aegis of Pallas, whom Domitian held in particular reverence (Ep. 160). 
Martial, in this and the following epigram, lauds it above the real Aegis. 

Accipe belligerae crudum tlioi*aca Minervae,

Martial complains that one Annius, instead of putting the dishes on the 
Cable at his dinner-parties, so that the guests might help themselves as they 
liked, had them brought round by his servants so quickly, that there was no 
time to eat one thing before another was handed in ; the consequence being, 
that the guests had little to eat, and the host saved expense. It appears that 
the expressions &apos; mensa prima,* *mensa secunda,* and so on, were literally true, 
and that when one course was finished the whole table, dishes and all, was 
taken off, and a fresh one with the next course brought in ; so that Annius 
would have had an opportunity of showing off some at least of his innu- 
merable tables, if his economy had not overcome his love of display.

Nasidienus, on the pretence of expiating bad dreams about Martial, got 
from him eggs, wine, frankincense, lambs,&amp;c. Martial complains that all 
his property is going, and begs Nasidienus either to keep awake, or, if he 
n)U8t dream, to dream about himself. This is a satire on Roman supersti- 
tion, and not to be regarded as a true storv against Martial. So Hoitice,

Rabirius (cf. Ep. 562) had built a palace for Domitian, the pattern of 
which Martial says he must have taken from the heavens; and he adds, 
that if Pisa should want to rear a temple fit to contain the statue of 
Jupiter Olympius, made by Phidias (who is said in making it to have 
taken his ideas from the description of Zeus, in the first Iliad), it must ask 
the Boman Jupiter to send Rabirius to be the architect.

This epigram is well called * foeda adulatio erga Domitianum.* Martial

kis title to being a god). Domitian shall be his god, to whom he will pray 
for all good.

It appears that at Rome small shopkeepers, barbers,&amp;c., had been 
accustomed to expose their wares for sale in the street, and block up the 
way with them. Small booths were also erected in front of their shops for 
the same pui-pose. So Suet. Ner. 26, says, * Nero circa vices vagalatar 
ludibundus — tabemulas etiam eflFringere et expilare ;&apos; with which compare 
Tac. Ann. xiii. 25, &apos; itinera urbis pererrabat comitantibus qui raperent

Germanicus Caesar (Domitian) forbade it entirely, and is here praised 1^ 
Martial for his good offices in clearing the streets.

On Domitian&apos;s third victory over the German tribes, to honour which 
he dedicated a laurel-crown to Jupiter Capitolinus, instead of receiving a

him.

Sextos had engaged to pay his advocate 2000 sesterces for pleading some 
doubtful and probably disgracefxil cause. He was cast, and refused to 
pay more than 1000, on the plea that he had betrayed the cause, and not 
spoken for him. Martial says : &apos; If that is the case, you owe me the more, 
because my modesty prevented things coming out, which would have been 
of infinitely more discredit to you, than the gain would have been great 
if you had won the cause.* A simpler sense, however, may be the truer 
one : * You owe me so much the more, because I was put to the blush

Martial prays for the mom to come which is to restore Domitian to

in his presence there is always sufficient light. A highly poetical epigram,

desirable.

On the piety of Melior towards Blaesos, a scribe, whose birthday he 
celebrated oy a feast, which in memory of him he called Blae&amp;ianum 
sacrum. For this custom of celebrating the birthdays of friends or great 
men, see Ep. 674. Jut. 5. 37, &apos; Quale coronati Thrasea Helvidiusque

religiosius quam suum celebmbat. Compare also Sen. Ep. 64. 8, * Quidni 
ego magnorum virorum et imagines habeam incitamenta animi et natales 
celebrem.* Martial here says that gifts may be made to the liying in 
hopes of a return ; gifts in honour of the dead can only be giyen out of 
pure affection. The differance is, whether you are really good, or only 
wish to seem so. Melior (see Ep. 289), as he cannot hope for a return, 
must be acting well from real loye to Blaesus

On the oonTenion of the house in which Domitiui wu horn (ia|». 
Ep. 445) into a temple. See Merivale^s Hist. Rom. yii. p. 319. The poet 
compares the event with the hirth of Pallas in Rhodes, and of Jupiter in 
Crete. 

HaeCy quae tota patet tegiturqne et marmore et auro, 

Infantis domini conscia terra fiiit. 
Felix o qnantis sonuit vagitibus et qnas 

Vidit reptantes sustinuitque manus ! 
Hie steterat veneranda domus, quae praestitit orb! 6 

Quod Rhodes astrifero, quod pia Creta polo. 
Curetes texere lovem crepitantibus armis, 

Semiviri poterant qualia ferre Phryges : 
At te protexit superum pater et tibi, Caesar, 

Pro iaculo et panna fulmen et aegis erat. 10

open colonnade seems to he meant, 
vnidch was adorned with marble and 
gilded pillars. Perhaps this was the 
original atrium of the domtts.^-con-

the temple.&apos; Cf. Ep. 160. 2.

5.] * Here stood the mansion, 
which gave to the world the same 
boon that Rhodes and Crete gave 
to heaven,&apos; viz. the birth of a god. 
In Pindar, 01. vii. 35 seqq., PsQlas 
is described as springing from the 
head of Zeus, in the island of Rhodes; 
at least, the context suggests that as 
the locality. Others say that Nep- 
tune is meant. — pia Creta^ * dutiful 
Crete,&apos; because she protected the 
infant god from being devoured by 
Saturn.

Sardonica^ Sardinia being famed 
for its bitter herbs, which gave a 
flavour to the honey. Vixg. Eel.

On an old sailor, who having bought land by the Tiber, kept out the

Caesaris haec nostri pars est quota ? vidit id nndis

Vidit in aequoreo ferventes pulvere cumis 

Et domioi Triton isse putavit equos : 
Dumque parat saevis ratibus fera praelia Nereus,

Quidquid et in Circo spectatur et Amphitheatro,

unknown or unfamiliar to the people ; 
or land animals, as hulls and norses, 
unknown to Thetis, because alien 
from the water, hut taught to per- 
form in it or on it, may be doubted. 
Doniitian, according to Suetonius, 
§ 14, save a &apos;proelium navale in 
arophitheatro,* from which it must 
be inferred that the floor of the 
Colosseum, to some depth, could be 
flooded with water. 

5. Vidit,&amp;c.] &apos; Triton saw cha- 
riots at full speed on a watery plain &apos; 
(or, &apos; on a dusty course now turaed 
into water&apos;), &apos; and fancied that the 
hippocampi of his lord and master 
Neptune had run the race.* There 
is, perhaps, an intentional ambi- 
guity in dominiy meaning also the 
emperor. 

8. ire pedester] We cannot ex-
