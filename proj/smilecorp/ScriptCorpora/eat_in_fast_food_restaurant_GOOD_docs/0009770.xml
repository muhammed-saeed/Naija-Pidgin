 Christine Ricketts 
 HANDOUT PHOTO Christine Ricketts, seen in this undated handout photo, was murdered in March, 1998. 
 Star Staff 
 
 Note: This story is based on previous Star reports 

Living by the work ethic she learned as a girl in Kingston, Jamaica, Christine Ricketts always had a job. She went to school, sang in the church choir and taught at a day-care centre in her native land.

When she arrived in Canada, she continued to work hard and never forgot her family back home.

Ricketts&apos; mother, Gloria Nugent, who lives in Jamaica but flew to Toronto for her daughter&apos;s funeral and the murder trial of Adrian Paul, said July 13, 1999 that her daughter would often send her&quot;barrels,&quot;a tradition whereby containers of clothing, food and other goods are sent from Caribbean people living abroad to their families in the islands.

The life of the single mother of two came to an end at the hands of Paul, who was found guilty of first-degree murder July 13, 1999 in her beating and strangulation death.

The 31-year-old Toronto Star canvasser was murdered while on the job, her body found at about 3:40 a.m. March 5, 1998, on the fifth-floor landing of Paul&apos;s apartment building at Brookbanks Dr. in the York Mills Rd.-Don Valley Parkway area. (Note: The Star announced March 6, 1998, that it was establishing a trust fund for the benefit of Ricketts&apos; children, then aged 2 and 7, and has donated $100,000 to it.)

Paul, 34, was a convicted sex offender who was on parole after serving 16 months for choking and sexually assaulting a prostitute.

DNA analysis was crucial in the Ricketts case.

Small amounts of sperm found on a red blouse and a pink jacket Ricketts was wearing when she was killed proved decisive for a Superior Court of Justice jury.

While Toronto police had Paul under surveillance, they seized a cup and straw he used at a fast-food restaurant on March 8, 1998, three days after Ricketts&apos; body was found. Police had also discovered Paul&apos;s past convictions for sex crimes, and the fact he lived one floor above the one where Ricketts&apos; body was found.

Scientists at Toronto&apos;s Centre of Forensic Sciences compared Paul&apos;s DNA from the straw and cup to the DNA found on Ricketts&apos; clothing.

The tests showed a male DNA profile that was a fit for Paul&apos;s DNA.

Paul, who pleaded not guilty, told police before his arrest he didn&apos;t know and hadn&apos;t seen Ricketts at his apartment the day she disappeared.

He said he was home in the afternoon of March 4, 1998, then went out around 10:30 p.m. to pick up his mother and bring her back to their apartment. Paul did not testify at the trial.

The DNA wasn&apos;t the only piece of evidence against Paul. There was also a previous sexual assault in the summer of 1994 involving a 26-year-old prostitute.

He was convicted Aug. 8, 1996, receiving two years less a day in jail. He was granted parole after serving 16 months.

But on Dec. 11, 2002, Ontario&apos;s highest court ordered a new trial for Paul, saying a jury should never have been told about his previous conviction for choking and sexually assaulting a prostitute.

The evidence was&quot;highly prejudicial&quot;to Paul and of marginal use to the jury because the attack on the prostitute known as&quot;S&quot;bore little more than a vague similarity to Ricketts&apos; fatal beating and choking in a North York apartment building, the Ontario Court of Appeal said in a 3-0 decision.

But Paul was convicted again and on March 29, 2004, he was sentenced to 25 years to life with no chance of parole.
