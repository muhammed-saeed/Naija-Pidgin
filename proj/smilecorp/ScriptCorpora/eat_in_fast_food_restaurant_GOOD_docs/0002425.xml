 The Children&apos;s Playroom - January 11, 2007 5 out of 5 people found this review helpful. The Children&apos;s Playroom is a child care facility that takes care of children up to age 12, seven days a week.

I dropped by the other day&amp;you would not believe the fun they were all having in there. It was rather intoxicating. 
 I recommend this place.

 Oreck - January 11, 2007 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. Just like the other Oreck Vacuum Centers, this Brentwood-located store delivers all that you have come to expect from this chain.

With many Orecks to choose from to purchase, as well as a very handy repair center, this is a yearly stop for us. Never had a problem.

 Merle Norman Cosmetics&amp;Day Spa - January 11, 2007 2 out of 2 people found this review helpful. As far as Merle Normans go, this is a 10 out of 10. You can do everything here- facials, nails, waxing, makeup, massage. Just about everything that makes a girl happy, you can do here.

 L A Weight Loss Ctr - January 11, 2007 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. I&apos;m not a big LA Weight Loss kind of gal, and this Brentwood-located store is a little dingy I&apos;d say.

I did have a pal try out this location, and she said it was just like the other stores and very convenient for her. 
 I recommend this place.

 Brentwood Wine&amp;Spirits - January 11, 2007 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. Located in a Brentwood shopping center right off Franklin Rd. this wine&amp;liquor store treats customers right.

With good deals every week, great hours&amp;fully-stocked shelves, you&apos;re going to love this find. A knowledgeable staff will lead you to the right place&amp;if there&apos;s a wine you&apos;re looking for that they do not stock, they are happy to order it for you.

 Kroger - January 11, 2007 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. One of my favorite Kroger, this Brentwood-located store is setup a little differently, but it&apos;s worth it.

When you park, know that the produce&amp;deli are on the right side&amp;groceries on the left. With great, fresh produce this Kroger aims to please. 
 I recommend this place.

 Smoothie King - January 11, 2007 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. Located in Brentwood right off Franklin Rd, this Smoothie King is always a little bit dirty for my taste.

The bathroom leaves a little less to be desires&amp;I could swear that no one washes their hands there. Go enjoy a smoothie, but you have been warned. 
 I do not recommend this place.

 Sky Cleaners - January 11, 2007 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. Now, I love Carriage Cleaners on the corner of Old Hickory&amp;Franklin Rd, but when money&apos;s tight, Sky Cleaners will do.

With fast&amp;friendly service, you just might make Sky Cleaners the place where you take all your dry cleaning. And with excellent tailoring&amp;alterations, you don&apos;t have to go far for a good deal. 
 I recommend this place.

 Cristin&apos;s Furniture&amp;Home Decor - January 11, 2007 2 out of 2 people found this review helpful. Located in Brentwood right off Franklin Rd, this home decor store is a good find.

If you&apos;ve been shopping in Franklin&amp;amp; downtown Nashville, you know how the prices can be for home furnishings, and that&apos;s why you need to send yourself on to Cristin&apos;s. With many pieces to choose from&amp;amp; the prices close to being right, this is a store you will keep coming back to. 
 I recommend this place.

 UPS Store - January 11, 2007 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. I don&apos;t have a lot of luck at this UPS Store location, I much prefer the Edmonson Pike location myself. This UPS Store is always crowded&amp;comes with grumpy sales clerks.

If you&apos;re just doing some light shipping, grab a place in line; but if you&apos;re a serious shipper- try Edmonson. 
 I do not recommend this place.

 N 101 - January 11, 2007 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. If you&apos;re looking for a more local GNC, N 101 is the place for you. Located in Brentwood right off Franklin Rd in a shopping mall, N 101 is very conveniently located.

With all kinds of health supplements&amp;amp; nutrition aids, this health store helps you maintain the lifestyle you&apos;re working so hard for! Make sure to check out their sale items&amp;save some cash.

 Bruegger&apos;s Bagels Bakery - January 11, 2007 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. Oh, how I love Bruegger&apos;s Bagels. Open early for breakfast, this bagelry always has FRESH bagels just waiting for you to gobble down.

The pumpernickel is my favorite bagel, but they&apos;re all very tasty- especially when you add any of their assortment of cream cheese. Get them to toast your bagel, or just eat it plain, this is my kind of place!

Make sure to check out their catering menu for that next business meeting! 
 I recommend this place.

 Pizza Hut - January 11, 2007 1 out of 1 people found this review helpful. To be honest, I&apos;ve never had much luck with this Pizza Hut location. Located right off Frankin Rd in a Brentwood shopping center, my pizzas are never on time, they&apos;re always a bit sloppy&amp;amp; I feel like I paid way too much for what I&apos;m getting. My advice, skip the pizza&amp;amp; head on over next door to Kroger&amp;amp; make your own!

But maybe you can change things around in there, as I see that they&apos;re hiring! 
 I do not recommend this place.

 YMCA - January 11, 2007 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. An older YMCA that&apos;s currently in the process of more renovation, this is my favorite Y in the area. Less snooty than Maryland Farms&amp;amp; with tennis courts that you don&apos;t have to pay extra for in your membership, this is the Y for you.

The best time to get your exercise is between 9am&amp;amp; 2pm. After 3pm, all the school kids hit the area pretty hard. With great&amp;amp; helpful staff, I know you will love this YMCA. 
 I recommend this place.

 Taco Bell - January 11, 2007 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. No matter how you feel about Taco Bell, this new location off Old Hickory is always clean&amp;amp; always fast.

Not the best parking planning in the world, this chain fast food restaurant is always reliable in what it sells&amp;amp; it&apos;s open late, what more could you ask for? 
 I recommend this place.

 Kroger - January 11, 2007 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. Not the newest Kroger on the block, but still very handy to Old Hickory.

This Kroger features a First Tennessee Bank, pharmacy, one-hour photo, groceries of course as well as a small floral department.

I like this Kroger because it&apos;s close to home, but the deli is expensive&amp;amp; the sushi isn&apos;t always fresh. 
 I recommend this place.

 Stein Mart - January 9, 2007 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. Just because it&apos;s in Franklin doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s my favorite, Brentwood&apos;s still the top.

 Stein Mart - January 9, 2007 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. How can you beat a Stein Mart that&apos;s right next to a TJ Maxx&amp;amp; Chick-Fil-A? You can&apos;t. That&apos;s all there is to it.

Stein Mart has never been my favorite store, but this location is the best of the best. Great displays, good deals&amp;amp; good organization make this store an A+++. 
 I recommend this place.

 Stein Mart - January 9, 2007 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. Not my favorite Stein Mart by far, but it helps that it&apos;s located next to one of my favorite Chinese buffets!

 Wal-Mart - January 9, 2007 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. This non-superstore Wal-Mart located off Nolensville is nothing really special. It has a small amount of groceries, a pharmacy&amp;amp; all the other things you have come to expect from Wal-Mart.

If you&apos;re looking for a good deal on toothpaste, you&apos;re in the right spot, but if you&apos;re looking for all the other fun stuff Wal-Mart Supercenters can offer go to Franklin or Antioch. 
 I recommend this place.

 Wal-Mart - January 9, 2007 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. Unless you absolutely have to, I would avoid this Wal-Mart almost at all costs.

Not a supercenter, this old school Wal-Mart only offers the minimum in groceries&amp;amp; is always ghettotastic. Never very clean or organized, I would go to the Franklin location a few miles away on 65. 
 I do not recommend this place.

 Wolf Camera&amp;Video - January 9, 2007 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. This Wolf Camera is located in the heart of Cool Springs in Franklin. This location is inside the Cool Springs Galleria Mall, on the second floor.

You know how I feel about mall locations, they&apos;re too much trouble to get in&amp;out of. But if you must, or you&apos;re already going to be at the mall- this location is always fast with their photo processing&amp;you can usually find at least one helpful person. B+.

 Wolf Camera&amp;Video - January 9, 2007 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. You know I love the Green Hills Mall&amp;Starbucks, so this Wolf Camera ranks high.

Located across the street from the best mall in Nashville, and right next to Starbucks Coffee, you have a lot to keep you occupied while you wait for your one-hour photos.

This particular Wolf Camera location specializes in video conversion. It may take a few days to get back, but it&apos;s well worth not sending your precious wedding video out to California to get converted to DVD. A++++!

 Wolf Camera&amp;Video - January 9, 2007 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. My favorite Wolf Camera in the Nashville area. There is always someone helpful around to answer any questions you may have.

The photo finishing&amp;amp; processing are superb, I&apos;ve never had a problem. As at all Wolf Cameras, the prices are a little high because of the quality of your images, so make sure to get a Wolf Pack card to help you when you need it!

 Wolf Camera&amp;Video - January 9, 2007 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. This Wolf Camera located on Thompson Lane is a handy location, especially since it&apos;s not located in an annoying mall that&apos;s hard to get to.

The one-hour photo is just that, one-hour with no wait usually. The yearly discount card is a good idea if you&apos;re getting a lot of processing done at one time- it pays for itself.

A good location with good staff, an A+.

 Marshalls - January 9, 2007 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. There&apos;s never a thing as a bad Marshalls or TJ Maxx, just ones that are not as organized as some. And this location falls in that category.

While the clothing&amp;amp; shoes are all there&amp;amp; fully stocked, the fact that it&apos;s so poorly displayed&amp;amp; kept up can be frustrating. For a better experience, try the Cool Springs location. 
 I recommend this place.

 T J Maxx - January 9, 2007 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. One of the best TJ Maxx stores around, only being beat by the Brentwood location sometimes.

 T J Maxx - January 9, 2007 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. Highway 70 I never find to be convenient, but if you&apos;re in the area, this is a decent enough TJ Maxx to visit.

But sometimes some stores are better than others. While I can sometimes weed through this Thompson Lane location, it&apos;s never very organized&amp;amp; often very frustrating to shop.

If you&apos;re looking for a great Maxx experience in Nashville, try the Cool Springs or Brentwood locations.

 Linens&apos;n Things - January 9, 2007 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. Located in Goodlettsville, this Linens&apos;n Things lacks nothing, but a good location.

With everything you need for your home&amp;amp; bath in one place, the only thing I would think of criticizing is the organization, which is rather sloppy at times.

Go to Cool Springs if you&apos;re needing a good Linens&apos;n Things, but for a quick stop, this store is just fine.

With everything any other location would have, this branch is just a little dingier. If I were you, I would head on over to the Cool Springs store.

 Cross Corner Bar&amp;Grill - January 9, 2007 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. When in Brentwood, you don&apos;t have a lot to choose from where the bars are concerned. But this little gem is worth even a drive from Franklin.

With a pool table that&apos;s rarely used, actually good food&amp;amp; a good enough list of beers on tap, this is the must-see bar in Brentwood.

Be friendly to your bartender&amp;amp; they will always treat you right!

 Rainforest Cafe - January 9, 2007 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. Amid the rainforest sounds, fake trees&amp;amp; wonderful aquariums, you will find an overpriced restaurant with bland food.

Don&apos;t get me wrong, if you want to wait in a long line to be fed mediocre food in a wonderful illusion, then this is the place for you. But if you can hang on for a bit&amp;amp; make it outside of Opry Mills Mall, head on over to Amerigo&apos;s in downtown Nashville for a real meal. But that&apos;s just me...

 Target - January 9, 2007 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. An older Target located off White Bridge Rd, this location doesn&apos;t have all the bells&amp;amp; whistles but it gets the job done.

 Target One Hour Photo - January 9, 2007 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. I have used Target One-Hour Photo in the past. The photos were great, although not as good as Wolf Camera, they were on time, but just a little more expensive than what I like.

If you don&apos;t mind paying the extra cash&amp;amp; Wolf Camera isn&apos;t an option, this is a good back-up. Just bring the bank with you!!!

Once you find the coffee house, good luck with parking! As this Starbucks is always crowded, I always opt for the drive-thru. You just have to go around the back of the complex to get there, but once you&apos;ve found this creative piece of architecture, you&apos;ll never forget.

Only thing about this Aveda salon I have had a problem with is trying to order items that are out of stock. It takes forever! But if you need a place for a nice do, or need to stock up on some product or get a waxing, this is the place to do it in Cool Springs.

Mens and Womens shoes both abound here at the shoes heaven of Middle Tennessee. If you don&apos;t like what you find here, try out the Murfreesboro and Tullahoma locations. But while you&apos;re in Cool Springs, check out The Greek Cafe which is just down from Marti and Liz.

 Sue&apos;s Gyro Inc - December 5, 2006 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. Sue&apos;s Gyros is a local Franklin Greek cafe. It gets pretty crowded during lunch, so make sure you have the time to wait.

This Greek cafe offers everything from grape leaf wraps, to tabouli, to baklava and hummus from a can. Did you get that, hummus from a can! And they&apos;re not shy about showing you that they didn&apos;t make the hummus, nor are they shy about charging you as much as if they did make it!

However, the gyros are great, there&apos;s a TV always on, so can watch CNN or the game&amp;amp; enjoy your grape leaves. But I just can&apos;t go back because a meal, with drink, is usually around $10 and the hummus isn&apos;t real.

The Puffy Muffin specializes in sandwiches, salads&amp;amp; soups. I am a fan of their Reuben sandwich&amp;amp; their breakfast foods. The prices are a little high, but you&apos;re in Brentwood so you kind of expect that, right?

A great place to bring the family for a casual, yet pricey, lunch.

 Garcias - December 5, 2006 1 out of 1 people found this review helpful. Say hello to the last Mexican restaurant you will frequent. Located right next to Hobby Lobby in Franklin, you will never go to another Mexican restaurant after one bite of Garcias&apos;cuisine.

This family-run Mexican restaurant always has specials, usually seafood, so make sure you check the dry-erase board when you enter. Garcias has the best white cheese dip&amp;amp; cilantro-filled salsa around. Make sure to try the always great Taco Loco with chicken, salmon, tilapia&amp;amp; for sure the blackened trout with cilantro sauce will forever be a winner.

The mango margaritas are especially tasty, though at $20 a pitcher, they&apos;re a rare treat.

But make sure to save room for dessert, their banana pudding is to die for. This is not your every day Southern banana pudding, this is a whipped banana pudding inside a shell which is on top of hot caramel. And if you&apos;re lucky, the chef will have prepared a Mexican flag alongside your banana pudding with vanilla, green apple&amp;amp; raspberry.

Garcias is a Sunday afternoon favorite, so stop by today&amp;amp; check out the last Mexican restaurant you will love!

 Pei Wei Asian Diner - December 5, 2006 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. This is a Friday night ritual. We order the Crab Wontons, move onto the Dan Dan Noodle Bowl&amp;amp; then, if we&apos;re feeling randy, a Sobo Miso Bowl.

The prices are about average for higher end Asian take-away. We usually pay a little under $20 for the above meal. I love to take the food away rather than eat at Pei Wei, since their dining area is pretty small&amp;amp; always crowded, especially on Sunday mornings- a time to avoid.

But the staff is very helpful, always checking on you&amp;amp; making sure your order is correct. And the food is great, always fresh&amp;amp; hot. The only problems I see with is Friday night take-away must is that it really needs a larger dining area. The place is great in the summer months, as it has an outdoor eating area perfect for dinner&amp;amp; a movie date!

 Starbucks - December 5, 2006 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. While this Starbucks gets a negative right off the back due to no drive-thru, the coffee is always right on the nose, fresh&amp;amp; consistent.

Despite NOT having free WiFi, you can pay around $6 per day to access their T-Mobile HotSpot wireless. In a location right next to Blockbuster&amp;amp; Kinko&apos;s you can get your coffee on while you do a little work&amp;amp; pick out tonight&apos;s movie.

 Panera Bread - December 5, 2006 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. I LOVE Panera Bread&amp;it&apos;s not just because of their great sandwiches, delicious daily soups&amp;amp; pastries. Nope, it&apos;s because of the absolutely free wireless Internet! Unlike Starbucks, this sandwich shop allows you to access their WiFi totally free&amp;amp; that is certainly priceless, right?

This location, close to Hillsboro Village, and right in the heart of Nashville sometimes gets a little crowded, so be patient or try to hit the off-lunch hours to avoid the rush.

The food at Panera Bread locations are always fresh, the service fast&amp;amp; the coffee not super, but pretty decent. This is a great on-the-go healthy alternative to fast food. Make sure to give their new Crispanis a try, they&apos;re my new favorite! Just think free WiFi&amp;amp; you&apos;ll love Panera!

 Hobby Lobby Creative Ctr - December 5, 2006 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. Let me start by saying that the only reason I gave this particular Hobby Lobby a 2 out of 5, is the staff. If you&apos;re been, you know what I&apos;m talking about. It&apos;s amazing they don&apos;t get complaints regarding their customer service (or lack thereof) every day! The management is prickly&amp;amp; not on the customer&apos;s side, but the profit&apos;s side. The cashiers are overworked and cranky, especially that one- you know the one I&apos;m talking about, don&apos;t you?

The saving grace of this Hobby Lobby is the art department&apos;s knowledge&amp;amp; availability, as well as the framing department&apos;s concern for your satisfaction&amp;amp; their commitment to detail.

Other than that, this Hobby Lobby is set up just like most of the others. The floral is on the left as you enter, knitting&amp;amp; fabric supplies on the left in the middle, framing in the back, art department in the back middle&amp;amp; scrapbooking on your right.

As you know, Hobby Lobby is a great place for sales, so make sure you check out their specials listed on their website before you head out.

 Haus Of Yarn - December 5, 2006 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. This is by far the most expensive yarn shop I have ever been to, coupled with some less than helpful staff, I fear I shall not go back until my pocketbook can recover.

But if you&apos;re tired of the middle of the road yarn that you find at Hobby Lobby, this is the place to be, just bring the bank with you!

Haus of Yarn has a multitude of choices when it comes to yarn, from baby llama (my personal favorite) yarn to multi-colored&amp;amp; multi-layered yarn. About 200 yards of the baby llama will set you back $15 per, but make sure you stock up on the colors you want, as these puppies go fast!

Make sure to check out the bargain bin in the back left corner of the shop, the only place my yarn budget will allow me to visit.

All in all, this is a fabulous yarn shop full of many different types&amp;shapes, but just a little pricey. 
 I recommend this place.

 Frugal Mac Doogal&apos;s Liquor - December 5, 2006 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. Don&apos;t look around, this is the best spot in Nashville to buy wine&amp;amp; liquor. With another beer shop right next door, you don&apos;t need to go anywhere else!

This famous liquor store has quite the selection of wine, including sectioned-off areas for those high priced items. Can&apos;t find what you like? Just ask a staff member&amp;amp; they will happily order the wine you are interested in.

The liquor selection is top notch as well, with many hard to find items always in stock. The best thing about Frugal MacDoogal&apos;s, however, are the prices! You cannot beat the prices at this store. You wouldn&apos;t ever believe me if I told you, but I&apos;ll try. I recently stopped by&amp;amp; picked up a Handle of Captain Morgan&apos;s Spiced Rum for $18.99, along with a Fess Parker red blend for $10.99.

I dare you to find better prices&amp;amp; a more friendly&amp;amp; helpful staff; for Mr. Frugal MacDoogal will always remain my best frugal liquor friend. A+++

 Pangaea - December 5, 2006 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. Say hello to eclectic. This Hillsboro Village shop has just about everything you want for a gift or for yourself. From Mexican Day of the Day crafts to handmade jewelry&amp;amp; Free People clothing.

Be prepared to leave with a prize, as it&apos;s almost impossible to enter this store&amp;amp; leave without buying at least a little something.

The staff is available, though not always readily so. One word of warning, there is a high mark-up on items, but unless you want to shop around for hours online, this little boutique has everything you could want for yourself, your home, your pet, your friends&amp;amp; those on any holiday list. A +++

 Provence Breads&amp;Cafe - December 5, 2006 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. Say hello to the Petite Provence Breads&amp;Cafe at the Amsouth building downtown. I assume when Regions officially takes over Amsouth Bank, this will then become the Regions Bank building.

Anyhoo, this is the smallest of the Provence breads, tucked away into a little nook downtown. The food is still the same wonderful French cuisine plus pastries, just in a more compact place.

The staff is excellent&amp;helpful. A ++++

 Provence Breads&amp;Cafe - December 5, 2006 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. This is the Provence Breads right next to the Nashville downtown library. This is the worst of the Provence Breads, in my opinion. The staff is a little less knowledgeable, and the space is much smaller than the 21st Ave Hillsboro Village Provence. But the food is still great. although a little less pastries than some shops. All in all, not fantabulous, but not terrible either. If you have a soft spot for French food&amp;amp; books,this is the place to go!

 Provence Breads&amp;Cafe - December 4, 2006 0 out of 0 people found this review helpful. I have a soft spot for French cuisine&amp;amp; Provence delivers! This deli / bakery has it all&amp;amp; it&apos;s located in the very sheek Hillsboro Village area, so you grab a bit to eat&amp;amp; head on over to Pangaea!
Provence has two daily homemade soups to choose from as well as more pastries than you know what to do with.
Only complaint is the price, last meal included a veggie sandwich, large cappuccino with vanilla of course, chocolate tart&amp;amp; soup- all for close to $19! But it was worth every penny, as it was so completely delicious&amp;amp; reminded me of Paris more than Paris reminded me of Paris! A++++ 
 I recommend this place.
