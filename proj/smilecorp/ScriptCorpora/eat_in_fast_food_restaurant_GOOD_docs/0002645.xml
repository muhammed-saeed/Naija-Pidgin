Please help me answer the question
 Anonymous asked A fast food restaurant has drive-through window that can handle a
maximum of 60 cars per hour. The drive through is attended by one
employee that also acts as cashier. The average sale per order is
$7.00. A proposal has been made to add two additional workers. With
the new system the drive-through window will be able to handle up
to 100 orders per hour.

Based on the worker productivity, would you recommend the change?
(Show calculations)

Based on dollar productivity and assuming that each worker cost
$3.00 per hour, would you recommend the change (show
calculations)

Thank you!
