 I work in a pizza place and I will not reveal where but my General manager put bad stinking mushrooms and slimy chicken on a pizza. I told him is was bad and he went back to the back and put the mushrooms and chicken in separate strainers and washed it off. Now I&apos;m a manager to and needless to say as soon as he left I pitched that nasty crap. He has also served other spoiled food but much to my suprise no body has ever called back about food poisoning. But I always throw out spoiled food no matter if the inventory is way off at the end of the night.

 There was this one kid who worked at a Taco Bell in College Station, TX about 10 years ago who was caught on video taking a sh*t in a container of taco meat and then mixing it up.

It was all over the news there and the kid wound up doing some time in jail for it.

For those of you who eat at Taco Bell regularly, don&apos;t be put off by this. It was only at that location with some sick little b**t**d under their employ. It&apos;s not a company-wide thing.

 There was this one place I went to a lot in Boise (still go whenever I am there) but I had the worst experience I have ever had: My freinds and I ordered an appitizer sampler and it was very yummy. However, I noticed that a maggot was crawling out from a piece of kale (a very thick leafy green which has very curly and densly packed leaves. It is very bitter when raw) that was used as decoration. We called the waitress over who was very embarassed, but we were all totally cool (I work in food service and understand that these things happen). We got the whole meal for free along with gratis dessert.

 Yes, Taco Bell, in Delaware Ohio:
One lady orders food and wonders why she has stinging in her lip, I guess she waits a week until finally the lip is swollen the size of a walnut. She runs to the ER and has to have a sac of Roach eggs surgically removed from her lip.

That is freakin gross.

 I used to get lunch from a vocational-school cafeteria that was in the same building as my school. One time I ordered sweet and sour beef and when I got half way through eating it I bit down on a piece of steel wool (like the kind used to scrub pots!) GROSS.

 I worked in hotels for a long time. We had restaurants that were run by other companies. Some of the worst things I saw were:
1. Bug stickers to catch nats over the soup bin, the nats were drawn to the soup too...they stirred it up so it looked like pepper.
2. Ran out of salad unexpectedly during lent, it was a preordered lunch, the servers were taking the old uneaten lettuce off returned plates and reusing it on new dishes going out because people were insisting on changing their order.
3. Lots of roaches, not much you can do about it, just keep treating the kitchen for them.
4. A dead rat fell through a ceiling tile in the kitchen it had rotted so bad up there.
5. A server come to work wtih a herpes like virus on her face *(cold sore type) , touch it then butter someones toast (yuck).
6. A major swarm of ants came through a restaurant we were at on the hotel on the beach...they invaded the liquor bottles, the manager went through and strained the liquor so he didn&apos;t have to throw it out.
7. A area manager came in to eat breakfast, picked up a scoop of eggs and a roach fell from the ceiling onto his fork.
8. Take out returned with meal worms in it.
9. Lots of rumors from the State inspector. He would give me a list of restaurants he would eat at in the tri county area, there were only like 5 on the whole list.

My friend worked at McDonalds about 15 years ago, she said that when people would order extra something, they would drop it on the floor first. Or if it was a complaining person some cooks would spit on the food.

I believe that can happen at any restaurant, especially when they are kids just like you who don&apos;t get it and think it&apos;s funny to F--- with people and ask stupid questions like pretending your 13 and pregnant.

 Ok, I used to work in a bakery/sub shop when I was a kid. They kept the meat locked up in a cage in the cooler. In the winter, rodents would run in to the bakery when the doors were open to load up the delivery trucks.

Well one night, I reached into the meat cage and pulled out a package of ham to take up front. One side had been chewed off by mice or rats. I asked the boss what to do with the meat. He told me to fold it so that the chewed up side was to the inside oand did not show.

 -My cousin used to work at McDonalds and he said they serve policemen that come in burgers that go under machines. He also said once he pooped in a bun and put lettuce and ketchup on it and gave it to an old woman. She didn&apos;t eat it though.

-I went to KFC once and there was a chicken bone in my macaroni and cheese.

 I have a part time job which allows me to see kitchens o f restaurants. They are not very nice to look at. Last week I saw a big pot of rice setting on the floor. When the people working there saw me looking at it they put it on a shelf.

 My job takes me into the kitchens of many restaurants. I see quite a few questionable things. I&apos;ve seen diswashers handle clean dishes right after scrapping (pushing the food off of) dirty ones. There are many places where there is no soap or paper towels in the employee restrooms. I seen a chef smoking while preparing food. I seen a salad prep guy not wash his hands after he pooped. Fast food joints are the cleanest.
Most restaurants are perfectly ok. You can tell by looking around the dining room. If they are putting the time and effort to keep it clean and in good condition, the same could be said for the food prep area.
