Case Study # 1 - McDonaldÑ—s Ñ—SeniorsÑ— Restaurant (for W1/DQ2)

Â

Suzanne Drolet is manager of a McDonaldÑ—s restaurant in a city with
many Ñ—seniors.Ñ— She has noticed that some senior citizens have become
not just regular patrons Ñ— but patrons who come for breakfast and stay
on until about 3 PM. Many of these older customers were attracted
initially by a monthly breakfast special for people aged 55 and older.
The meal costs $1.99, and refills of coffee are free. Every fourth
Monday, between 100 and 150 seniors jam SuzanneÑ—s McDonaldÑ—s for the
special offer. But now almost as many of them are coming every day Ñ—
turning the fast-food restaurant into a meeting place. They sit for
hours with a cup of coffee, chatting with friends. On most days, as
many as 100 will stay from one to four hours.

Â

SuzanneÑ—s employees have been very friendly to the seniors, calling
them by their first names and visiting with them each day. In fact,
SuzanneÑ—s McDonaldÑ—s is a happy place Ñ— with her employees developing
close relationships with the seniors. Some employees have even visited
customers who have been hospitalized. Ñ—You know,Ñ— Suzanne says, Ñ—I
really get attached to the customers. TheyÑ—re like my family. I
really care about these people.Ñ— They are all Ñ—friendsÑ— and it is
part of McDonaldÑ—s corporate philosophy (as reflected in its web site,
www.mcdonalds.com) to be friendly with its customers and to give back to
the communities it serves.

Â

These older customers are an orderly group Ñ— and very friendly to
anyone who comes in. Further, they are neater than most customers, and
carefully clean up their tables before they leave. Nevertheless,
Suzanne is beginning to wonder if anything should be done about her
growing Ñ—nonfast-foodÑ— clientele. ThereÑ—s no crowding problem yet,
during the time when the seniors like to come. But if the size of the
senior citizen group continues to grow, crowding could become a problem.
Further, Suzanne is concerned that her restaurant might come to be
known as an Ñ—old peopleÑ—sÑ— restaurant Ñ— which might discourage some
younger customers. And if customers felt the restaurant was crowded,
some might feel that they wouldnÑ—t get fast service. On the other
hand, a place that seems busy might be seen as Ñ—a good place to goÑ—
and a friendly place.Ñ—

Â

Suzanne also worries about the image she is projecting. McDonaldÑ—s is
a fast-food restaurant (there are over 30,000 of them in 119 countries),
and normally customers are expected to eat and run. Will allowing
people to stay and visit change the whole concept? In the extreme,
SuzanneÑ—s McDonaldÑ—s might become more like a European-style
restaurant where the customers are never rushedÑ—and feel very
comfortable about lingering over coffee for an hour or two! Suzanne
knows that the amount her senior customers spend is similar to the
average customerÑ—s purchase Ñ— but the seniors do use the facilities
for a much longer time. However, most of the older customers leave
McDonaldÑ—s by 11:30 Ñ— before the noon crowd comes in.

Â

Suzanne is also concerned about another possibility. If catering to
seniors is OK, then should she do even more with this age group? In
particular, she is considering offering bingo games during the slow
morning hours Ñ— 9 AM to 11 AM. Bingo is popular with some seniors, and
this could be a new revenue source Ñ— beyond the extra food and drink
purchases that probably would result. She figures she could charge $5
per person for the two-hour period and run it with two underutilized
employees. The prizes would be coupons for purchases at her store (to
keep it legal) and would amount to about two-thirds of the bingo
receipts (at retail prices). The party room area of her McDonaldÑ—s
would be perfect for this use and could hold up to 150 persons.

Â

Evaluate Suzanne DroletÑ—s current strategy regarding senior citizens.
Â In terms of defining a &quot;target market&quot;, is Suzanne on target?Â Â Does
this strategy improve this McDonaldÑ—s image? What is her product?Â
What would your advice to Suzanne be?Â  Â Explain why or why not?

Case Study #Â 9 Ñ— SleepEasy Motel (for W2/DQ2)

Â

Eng Huang is trying to decide whether he should make some minor changes
in the way he operates his SleepEasy Motel or if he should join either
the Days Inn or Holiday Inn motel chains. Some decision must be made
soon because his present operation is losing money. But joining either
of the chains will require fairly substantial changes, including new
capital investment if he goes with Holiday Inn. Huang bought the
recently completed 60-room motel two years ago after leaving a
successful career as a production manager for a large producer of
industrial machinery. He was looking for an interesting opportunity that
would be less demanding than the production manager job. The SleepEasy
is located at the edge of a very small town near a rapidly expanding
resort area and about one-half mile off an interstate highway. It is 10
miles from the tourist area, with several nationally franchised
full-service resort motels suitable for Ñ—destinationÑ— vacations. There
is a Best Western, a Ramada Inn, and a Hilton Inn, as well as many Ñ—mom
and popÑ— and limited-service, lower-priced hotelsÑ—and some quaint bed
and breakfast facilities Ñ— in the tourist area.

Â

The interstate highway near the SleepEasy carries a great deal of
traffic, since the resort area is between several major metropolitan
areas. No development has taken place around the turnoff from the
interstate highway. The only promotion for the tourist area along the
interstate highway is two large signs near the turnoffs. They show the
popular name for the area and that the area is only 10 miles to the
west. These signs are maintained by the tourist areaÑ—s Tourist Bureau.
In addition, the state transportation department maintains several small
signs showing (by symbols) that near this turnoff one can find gas,
food, and lodging. Huang does not have any signs advertising SleepEasy
except the two on his property. He has been relying on people finding
his motel as they go toward the resort area.

Â

Initially, Huang was very pleased with his purchase. He had traveled a
lot himself and stayed in many different hotels and motels Ñ— so he had
some definite ideas about what travelers wanted. He felt that a
relatively plain but modern room with a comfortable bed, standard bath
facilities, and free cable TV would appeal to most customers. Further,
Huang thought a swimming pool or any other non revenue-producing
additions were not necessary. And he felt a restaurant would be a
greater management problem than the benefits it would offer. However,
after many customers commented about the lack of convenient breakfast
facilities, Huang served a free continental breakfast of coffee, juice,
and rolls in a room next to the registration desk.

Â

Day-to-day operations went fairly smoothly in the first two years, in
part because Huang and his wife handled registration and office duties
Ñ— as well as general management.Â  During the first year of operation,
occupancy began to stabilize around 55 percent of capacity. But
according to industry figures, this was far below the average of 68
percent for his classification Ñ— motels without restaurants. After two
years of operation, Huang was concerned because his occupancy rates
continued to be below average. He decided to look for ways to increase
both occupancy rate and profitabilityÑ—and still maintain his
independence. Huang wanted to avoid direct competition with the full
service resort motels. He stressed a price appeal in his signs and
brochures Ñ— and was quite proud of the fact that he had been able to
avoid all the unnecessary expensesÑ— of the full service resort motels.
As a result, Huang was able to offer lodging at a very modest price Ñ—
about 40 percent below the full-service hotels and comparable to the
lowest-priced resort area motels. The customers who stayed at SleepEasy
said they found it quite acceptable. But he was troubled by what seemed
to be a large number of people driving into his parking lot, looking
around, and not coming in to register.

Â

Huang was particularly interested in the results of a recent study by
the regional tourist bureau. This study revealed the following
information about area vacationers:

Â

1. 68 percent of the visitors to the area are young couples and older
couples without children.

2. 40 percent of the visitors plan their vacations and reserve rooms
more than 60 days in advance.

3. 66 percent of the visitors stay more than three days in the area and
at the same location.

4. 78 percent of the visitors indicated that recreational facilities
were important in their choice of accommodations.

5. 13 percent of the visitors had family incomes of less than $27,000
per year.

6. 38 percent of the visitors indicated that it was their first visit to
the area.

Â

After much thought, Huang began to seriously consider affiliating with a
national motel chain in hopes of attracting more customers and maybe
protecting his motel from the increasing competition. There were
constant rumors that more motels were being planned for the area. After
some investigating, he focused on two national chain possibilities: Days
Inn and Holiday Inn. Neither had affiliates in the area even though they
both have aboutÂ 2,000 units nationwide.Â Â

Â

Days Inn of America, Inc., is an Atlanta-based chain of economy
lodgings. It has been growing rapidly Ñ— and is willing to take on new
franchisees. A major advantage of Days Inn is that it would not require
a major capital investment by Huang. The firm is targeting people
interested in lower-priced motels Ñ— in particular, senior citizens, the
military, school sports teams, educators, and business travelers. In
contrast, Holiday Inn would probably require Huang to upgrade some of
his facilities, including adding a swimming pool. The total new capital
investment would be between $300,000 and $500,000, depending on how
fancy he got. But then Huang would be able to charge higher prices Ñ—
perhaps $75 per day on the average, rather than the $45 per day per room
heÑ—s charging now.

Â

The major advantages of going with either of these national chains would
be their central reservation system Ñ— and their national names. Both
companies offer toll-free reservation lines Ñ— nationwide Ñ— which
produce about 40 percent of all bookings in affiliated motels. Both
companies also offer web sites (www.daysinn.com and www.holiday-inn.com)
that help find a specific hotel by destination, rate, amenities, quality
rating, and availability. A major difference between the two national
chains is their method of promotion. Days Inn uses little TV advertising
and less print advertising than Holiday Inn. Instead, Days Inn
emphasizes sales promotions. In a recent campaign, for example, Blue
Bonnet margarine users could exchange proof-of-purchase seals for a free
night at a Days Inn. This tie-in led to the Days Inn system selling an
additional 10,000 rooms. Further, Days Inn operates a September Days
Club for over 300,000 senior citizens who receive such benefits as
discount rates and a quarterly travel magazine. This club accounts for
about 10 percent of the chainÑ—s room revenues. Days Inn also has other
membership programs, including its InnCredible Card Plus Club for
frequent business and leisure travelers. This club even features a
family option package. Other programs targeted to business travelers
include two Corporate Rate programs. ItÑ—s also promoting Days Inn new
Business Place hotels. Not to be outdone, Holiday Inn also has a senior
citizen club called Alumni Club and other membership programs including
Priority Club Worldwide. Both firms charge 8 percent of gross room
revenues for belonging to their chain Ñ— to cover the costs of the
reservation service and national promotion. This amount is payable
monthly. In addition, franchise members must agree to maintain their
facilities Ñ— and make repairs and improvements as required. Failure to
maintain facilities can result in losing the franchise. Periodic
inspections are conducted as part of supervising the whole chain and
helping the members operate more effectively.

Case Study #Â 10 - MurphyÑ—s Ice Land (for W2/DQ3)

Â

Eduardo Black, the manager of MurphyÑ—s Ice Land, is trying to decide
what strategies to use to increase profits. MurphyÑ—s Ice Land is an
ice-skating rink with a conventional hockey rink surface (85 feetÂ x 200
feet). It is the only indoor ice rink in a northern U.S. city of about
450,000. The cityÑ—s recreation department operates some outdoor rinks
in the winter, but they donÑ—t offer regular ice skating programs
because of weather variability.

Â

Eduardo runs a successful hockey program that is more than breaking even
Ñ— but this is about all he can expect if he only offers hockey. To try
to increase his profits, Eduardo is trying to expand and improve his
public skating program. With such a program, he could have as many as
700 people in a public session at one time, instead of limiting the use
of the ice to 12 to 24 hockey players per hour. While the receipts from
hockey can be as high as $175 an hour (plus concession sales), the
receipts from a two-hour public skating session Ñ— charging $5 per
person Ñ— could yield up to $3,500 for a two-hour period (plus higher
concession sales). The potential revenue from such large public skating
sessions could make MurphyÑ—s Ice Land a really profitable operation.
But, unfortunately, just scheduling public sessions doesnÑ—t mean that a
large number will come. In fact, only a few prime times seem likely:
Friday and Saturday evenings and Saturday and Sunday afternoons.

Â

Eduardo has included 14 public skating sessions in his ice schedule, but
so far they havenÑ—t attracted as many people as he hoped. In total,
they only generate a little more revenue than if the times were sold for
hockey use. Offsetting this extra revenue are extra costs. More staff
people are needed to handle a public skating session Ñ— guards, a ticket
seller, skate rental, and more concession help. So the net revenue from
either use is about the same. He could cancel some of the less
attractive public sessions Ñ— like the noon-time daily sessions, which
have very low attendance Ñ— and make the average attendance figures look
a lot better. But he feels that if he is going to offer public skating
he must have a reasonable selection of times. He does recognize,
however, that the different public skating sessions do seem to attract
different people and, really, different kinds of people.

Â

The Saturday and Sunday afternoon public skating sessions have been the
most successful Ñ— with an average of 200 people attending during the
winter season. Typically, this is a Ñ—kid-sittingÑ— session. More than
half of the patrons are young children who have been dropped off by
their parents for several hours, but there are also some family groups.
In general, the kids and the families have a good time Ñ— and a fairly
loyal group comes every Saturday and/or Sunday during the winter season.
In the spring and fall, however, attendance drops about in half,
depending on how nice the weather is. Eduardo schedules no public
sessions in the summer Ñ— focusing instead on hockey clinics and figure
skating.

Â

The Friday and Saturday evening public sessions are a big
disappointment. The sessions run from 8 until 10 Ñ— a time when he had
hoped to attract teenagers and young adult couples.Â  At $5 per person,
plus $1.50 for skate rental, this would be an economical date. In fact,
Eduardo has seen quite a few young couples Ñ— and some keep coming back.
But he also sees a surprising number of 8 to 14 year-olds who have been
dropped off by their parents. The younger kids tend to race around the
rink playing tag. This affects the whole atmosphere Ñ— making it less
appealing for dating couples and older patrons.

Â

Eduardo has been hoping to develop a teenage and young adult market for
a Ñ—social activityÑ— Ñ— adapting the format used by roller-skating
rinks. Their public skating sessions feature a variety of couples-only
and group games as well as individual skating to dance music. Turning
ice skating sessions into such social activities is not common, however,
although industry newsletters suggest that a few ice-rink operators have
had success with the roller-skating format. Seemingly, the ice skating
sessions are viewed as active recreation, offering exercise and/or a
sports experience.Â  Eduardo installed some soft lights to try to change
the evening atmosphere. The music was selected to encourage people to
skate to the beat and couples to skate together. Some people complained
about the Ñ—oldÑ— music; but it was Ñ—danceable,Ñ— and some skaters
really liked it. For a few sessions, Eduardo even tried to have some
couples-only skates. The couples liked it, but this format was strongly
resisted by the young boys who felt that they had paid their money and
there was no reason why they should be kicked off the ice.Â  Eduardo
also tried to attract more young people and especially couples by
bringing in a local rock radio station disk jockey to broadcast from
MurphyÑ—s Ice Land Ñ— playing music and advertising the Friday and
Saturday evening public sessions. But this had no effect on attendance
Ñ— which varies from 50 to 100 per two-hour session during the winter.

Â

Eduardo seriously considered the possibility of limiting the Friday and
Saturday evening sessions to people age 14 and over Ñ— to try to change
the environment. He knew it would take time to change peopleÑ—s
attitudes. But when he counted the customers, he realized this would be
risky. More than a quarter of his customers on an average weekend night
appear to be 13 or under. This means that he would have to make a
serious commitment to building the teenage and young-adult market. And,
so far, his efforts havenÑ—t been successful. He has already invested
over $3,000 in lighting changes and over $9,000 promoting the sessions
over the rock music radio station Ñ— with very disappointing results.Â
Although the stationÑ—s sales rep said they reached teenagers all over
town, an on-air offer for a free skating session did not get a single
response!

Â

Some days, Eduardo feels itÑ—s hopeless. Maybe he should accept that
most public ice skating sessions are a mixed bag. Or maybe he should
just sell the time to hockey groups. Still he keeps hoping that
something can be done to improve weekend evening public skating
attendance, because the upside potential is so good. And the Saturday
and Sunday afternoon sessions are pretty good money-makers.

Â

Evaluate MurphyÑ—s Ice LandÑ—s situation. What should Eduardo Black
do?Â  Why?

Case Study # 14 Ñ— MultiMedia Corral (for W3/DQ2)

Â

Josh Sullivan, manager of MultiMedia Corral, is looking for ways to
increase profits. But heÑ—s turning cautious after the poor results of
his last effort Ñ— during the previous Christmas season.Â  MultiMedia
Corral (MC) is located along a busy cross-town street about two miles
from the downtown of a metropolitan area of 1 million and near a large
university. It sells a wide variety of products used for its different
types of multimedia presentations. Its lines include high quality still,
video, and digital cameras, color scanners for use with computers, and
projection equipment Ñ— including 35-mm slide projectors, overhead
projectors, and electronic projectors that produce large-screen versions
of computer output. Most of the sales of this specialized equipment are
made to area school boards for classroom use, to industry for use in
research and sales, and to the university for use in research and
instruction.

Â

MultiMedia Corral (MC) also offers a good selection of
production-quality video media (including hard to get betacam tapes and
recordable CDs), specialized supplies (such as the acetates used with
full-color computer printers), video and audio editing equipment, and a
specialized video editing service. Instead of just duplicating videos on
a mass production basis, MC gives each video editing job individual
attention Ñ— to add an audio track or incorporate computer graphics as
requested by a customer. This service is really appreciated by local
firms that need help producing high-quality videos Ñ— for example, for
training or sales applications.

Â

To encourage the school and industrial trade, MC offers a graphics
consultation service. If a customer wants to create a video or
computerized presentation, professional advice is readily available. In
support of this free service, MC carries a full line of computer
software for multimedia presentations and graphics work.

Â

MC has four full-time store clerks and two outside sales reps. The sales
reps call on business firms, attend trade shows, make presentations for
schools, and help both present and potential customers in their use and
choice of multimedia materials. Most purchases are delivered by the
sales reps or the storeÑ—s delivery truck. Many orders come in by phone
or mail.

Â

The people who make most of the over-the-counter purchases are (1)
serious amateurs and (2) some professionals who prepare videos or
computerized presentation materials on a fee basis. MC gives price
discounts of up to 25 percent of the suggested retail price to customers
who buy more than $2,000 worth of goods per year. Most regular customers
qualify for the discount.

Â

In recent years, many amateur photo buffs have started to buy relatively
inexpensive new digital cameras to capture family pictures. Frequently,
the buyer is a computer user who wants to use the computer as a digital
darkroom Ñ— and the cameras now available make this easy. MC has not
previously offered the lower-priced and lower-quality digital models
such buyers commonly want.Â  But Josh Sullivan knew that lots of such
digital cameras were bought and felt that there ought to be a good
opportunity to expand sales during the Christmas gift-giving season.
Therefore, he planned a special pre-Christmas sale of two of the most
popular brands of digital cameras and discounted the prices to
competitive discount store levels Ñ— about $169 for one and $229 for the
other. To promote the sale, he posted large signs in the store windows
and ran ads in a Christmas gift-suggestion edition of the local
newspaper. This edition appeared each Wednesday during the four weeks
before Christmas. At these prices and with this promotion, Josh hoped to
sell at least 100 cameras. However, when the Christmas returns were in,
total sales were five cameras. Josh was extremely disappointed with
these results Ñ— especially because trade experts suggested that sales
of digital cameras in this price and quality ranges were up 200 percent
over last year Ñ— during the Christmas selling season.

Â

Evaluate what MultiMedia Corral is doing and what happened with the
special promotion.Â  What should Josh Sullivan do to increase sales and
profits?
