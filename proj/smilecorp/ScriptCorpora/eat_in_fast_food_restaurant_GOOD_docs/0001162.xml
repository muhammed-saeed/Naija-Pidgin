et Subscriptor Tribus: Houston, Texas Registered: Apr 2, 2010 Posts: 719 Posted: Tue Jan 11, 2011 11:43 am So the company is moving from 2-post racks to 4-post racks and overhead cabling (yay).

We have the 4-post racks set up and spaced about 5&quot;apart using brackets. Two brackets in front (top/bottom) and two in the back (also top/bottom). Management has now requested something to fill in that 5&quot;gap that hopefully would match the racks and make it all blend together.
*side note* The DCO is glassed in and so all of our equipment is on display to customers, vendors, as well as all of our employees from the foyer/main staircase.

Does anyone have any suggestions or know of products for this purpose?

I&apos;ve checked with Chatsworth as well as a few other websites but can&apos;t find anything resembling what I need. Thanks in advance.

APC sells blanks for within racks. I don&apos;t think they have stuff to fit between racks, which is what I read the OP is asking for.

 Must include dispensers with little acrylic trowels. Need a plastic-bag roll dispenser on the tape robot. But - It&apos;s a room with some serious thermal potential. Popcorn is a bad idea, as would be anything chocolate or otherwise melty Jolly Ranchers would be perfect. Tests would be needed to determine melting point of Gummi Bears.

Hmm.... good point. Perhaps only pre-popped popcorn, which may have insulating value.

APC sells blanks for within racks. I don&apos;t think they have stuff to fit between racks, which is what I read the OP is asking for. 

APC whitepapers talk about blanking plates as well as between rack spacers.

I THINK this is the type of thing being discussed:

 http://www.cdw.com/shop/products/defaul ... dc=2038572 

I would think APC would sell one that is a standard (or at least APC standard) rack&apos;s height or half height spacers.

Tragically, that part is 6&quot;and is to be used before setting up your additional racks, to aid in spacing. If you&apos;ve already got racks that are an imprecise distance apart, but somewhere near 5&quot;, this won&apos;t do it.

Those are pretty nice. We&apos;ve got that or something almost exactly like that installed in all of our new IDFs. I don&apos;t particularly care for the way the cabling vendor used 7&apos; and longer cables, but that&apos;s life.

Absolute worst case, you could have a local machine shop fabricate up something custom (powdercoated aluminum?) to fit the space you have. A small-quantity order will probably cost a bit more than something off-the-shelf, but given the kind of markups I&apos;ve often seen on networking hardware, maybe not as bad as you&apos;d fear.

I think that we will be running the cables inside the racks and not between them.

-The cable management you moved to the top. 
What cable management? One of the first things i did when starting the job was to go back over all of the 2post racks and attempt to secure the cables into bundles with velcro.

-rack blanking plates for data center cooling management.
We will be using those inside the racks between servers and stuff but I&apos;m looking for something similar to side panels to go between the rack enclosures themselves.

-Can they not jus fix that problem in the first place? 
The brackets are also there to allow room for the poles holding up the overhead cable ladder-run thingies. Cable runways. Ladder racks. Whatever.

-Tell them they need to get all the same racks, then have someone do some nice logo on it like this: http://www.ornl.gov/ornlhome/image_gallery/Jaguar1.jpg 
-I&apos;d cut some plexiglass that fits the opening and then dump massive amounts of one kind of candy and/or popcorn into each slot. It&apos;d look like a fantastic techy candy store at a mall.
I&apos;ll pass that along to them and see what they say. 

-I THINK this is the type of thing being discussed: http://www.cdw.com/shop/products/defaul ... dc=2038572 
I can&apos;t quite tell from the picture but those seem to be 65$ spacers that would do the same job our 16 pieces for 20$ brackets are doing. Either that or they are similar to the cable carriers for 2post racks.

-Panduit makes these 4.9&quot;vertical cable managers, they come in a couple different heights.
Those are rather nice but I think we&apos;re not going to be running cables in between the racks. That might change as we&apos;re also just now coming to the conclusion that spending 2200$ on angled patch panels may not be a good idea and will probably end up shipping them to main site and going with switches instead. The word&quot;experiment&quot;keeps getting tossed around when it comes to discussion about the work that I&apos;ve been doing.

-Who made the&quot;brackets&quot;that are spacing your new racks apart? Do they have any related products that would fit the bill?
Can&apos;t remember the name that was on the box at the moment, I&apos;ll see if I can upload pictures of the&quot;Model Facility&quot;that we&apos;re supposed to be recreating. They want everything to match the way it&apos;s done in our main headquarters and so they ordered some aluminum brackets about 2&apos; in length that we had our shop guys chop into 6&quot;lengths. We then screwed these pieces to the racks so that they are all 5&quot;apart.

I did. As per my supervisor&apos;s instructions.

Or rather,&quot;Here&apos;s the stuff, here&apos;s what we want it to look like. Make it so.&quot;

Overhead Map Layout
 Spoiler: show 

Looking down the row from above the ladder rack in the&quot;pod&quot;
 Spoiler: show 

Front view of the row. Note the&quot;side panels&quot;or w&apos;e they are between the racks. (they are supposed to get back to me on how they did that but I and my boss would prefer something that didn&apos;t look so... jury-rigged)
 Spoiler: show 

Brackets between the racks, keeping them spaced at 5&quot;. I requested that we not run cables between the racks and my supervisor agrees (looks like shit imo). However, there are several levels of management above him and if they say to do it, and we can&apos;t convince them otherwise, we&apos;ll have to do it. 
 Spoiler: show 


So yeah, I&apos;m hoping to find those rack space covers/side panels so that it looks professional as it&apos;s pretty much my main project. They ordered a bunch of random stuff according to what was done back at the HQ. It arrived and I&apos;m the one that then assembles it to get everything looking as perfect as possible. I managed to convince them after demonstrating how the angle patch panels look awful when placed next to a switch so we will either be moving back to flat patch panels or using switches instead. Having switches would then reduce our overhead cabling to 3-4 trunk lines running to the MDF for every 3 racks or so as opposed to 48 cables for every rack. However, I&apos;m the lowest rung on the ladder trying my best to do what I&apos;m told and yet persuade the upper rungs not to waste money on useless shit simply because it&apos;s what HQ did. 

[edit] I&apos;ll see if I can snap a few quick pictures of the work in progress tomorrow.[/edit]

I don&apos;t think that&apos;s worst-case at all. With the kind of markup that exists on rack accessories, you may even come out ahead. If I understand your situation correctly this should be a very simple part for a local sheet metal shop to fabricate. Powdercoated or just painted steel would be the right material for the job.

Have someone with a mechanical design background take a look at it and give you some advice.

This.

This is nothing for a fab shop to shear some steel and drill some holes. You would probably want something in the ~20-24ga range and having a few beads rolled into them will help make them rigid.

The powdercoating could turn to be expensive though, especially on something that large with that much surface area (takes massive room in the oven or under the IR lamps, compared to something like a engine block). In general, powdercoating small batches is rather expensive.

But definitely check into a local fab or sheet shop, they will likely have contacts to a local powedercoater if they don&apos;t do it in house themselves.

et Subscriptor Tribus: Houston, Texas Registered: Apr 2, 2010 Posts: 719 Posted: Wed Jan 12, 2011 6:27 pm Apparently we can&apos;t hang the runways from the ceiling due to the dropped ceiling or something to that effect.

Also, the whole project seems to be a clusterfuck due to management saying, do it like we did at HQ. Which is why we have 60+ angled patch panels purchased at ~$400 each as opposed to flat patch panels which cost ~$125. 

Angled patch panels compared to Flat patch panels
 Spoiler: show 

-First plan was to have a row of 12 racks with middle two racks designated as network racks.
-Then we looked into having just one rack as the network rack for the row with (13) 48-port patch panels and (12) 48-port switches (Panel, switch, panel, switch, etc.). Each rack on the row would then have 48 network cables running across the runway and dropping into the network rack. However, this presents a single point of failure unless we get some fancy power strips that we can plug into two different whips for redundancy.
-Other talk is going through about having 3 switches covering every 3 racks. Racks 1-3 would have 3 switches on rack 2; Racks 4-6 would have 3 switches on rack 5, etc. However, this would then eliminate the need for patch panels, runways, poles, and the 50-odd boxes of network cabling we purchased.

I&apos;ll check with the supervisor and see if we can get some quotes. I worked with my dad and his steel business for a bit so I know a few places around town that can fabricate something, bend it, and should be able to powdercoat it as well.

I agree that the angled patch panels are nice when they&apos;re placed next to each other and have to be completely filled out. However, management is still trying to decide how they want the core racks set up. Some want angled panel/switch/angled panel/switch/etc. (which takes fucking forever to get the cables cut to proper length and clean-looking); some want flat panel/switch/flat panel/switch/etc. (which is easier to cable and looks better imo); others want to have all patch panels on top and switches on bottom (fine by me but I&apos;d prefer to have panels in the back and switches on front if we have to run the cables along the sides anyway).

*did I forget to mention that we&apos;re having to return 60 boxes of network cable because they&apos;re the wrong shade of blue (light blue which is what we currently have in the MDF instead of dark blue) according to the aforementioned management?* 

Pretty soon, I&apos;ll have to sit and wait for the unfucking to begin so we can proceed with the project as I&apos;m starting to run out of things to do in the meantime.

It&apos;s one of the main branch locations for the company. The proposed migration will be setting up the first 24 racks for all of the servers. Once those are out of the way and the 2-post racks are removed, we will then have room for the third row of another 12 racks to install the MDF stuff on. The talk of appearance is partly because we teach on-site software classes to our clients and they pass by the glassed datacentre on their way up the stairs.
