NNS080930-12. Several U.S. Ships Join Mission to Monitor Faina&gt;From Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Central Command/5th Fleet Public Affairs

MANAMA, Bahrain (NNS) -- Several U.S. ships are now operating in the
vicinity of Motor Vessel Faina, the Belize-flagged cargo ship, which was
captured Sept. 25 and is anchored off the coast of Somalia near the
harbor city of Hobyo.
The U.S. 5th Fleet continues to actively monitor the situation.&quot;We will maintain a vigilant watch over the ship and remain on station
while negotiations take place,&quot;said Rear Adm. Kendall Card, task force
commander leading the efforts to prevent the weapons aboard M/V Faina
from being offloaded from the ship.&quot;Our goal is to ensure the safety of the crew, to not allow off-loading
of dangerous cargo and to make certain Faina can return to legitimate
shipping.&quot;This incident highlights the complexity of the situation in the region.
MV Faina is owned and operated by&quot;Kaalybe Shipping Ukraine&quot;and is
carrying a cargo of T-72 tanks and related equipment. Its crew is
comprised of citizens from Ukraine, Russia and Latvia. There is no
indication that the ship had a security team aboard.

NNS080930-10. Chief of Naval Operations Releases Voting Message

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SW) Rebekah Blowers, Chief
of Naval Operations Public Affairs

WASHINGTON (NNS) -- The Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) discussed the
importance of voting in a podcast released Sept. 30.&quot;For our Sailors and our families, get to the polls and vote. If you
can&apos;t get there, make sure that you&apos;re working with your voting
assistance officers to ensure that you can have an absentee ballot and
be able to vote that way,&quot;Adm. Gary Roughead, CNO, said.

CNO reminded Sailors and their families that it is their Constitutional
right as American citizens to vote for the candidate they would like to
be their commander in chief.&quot;Our role is to support and defend the Constitution of the United States
against all enemies foreign and domestic and to abide and obey the
orders of the commander in chief, regardless of who that commander in
chief may be. We have to keep that in mind. That&apos;s what the American
people expect of us, and that&apos;s the code by which we live,&quot;Roughead said.

CNO encouraged Sailors and their families to make sure they are
registered to vote, especially if they are using an absentee ballot. Go
to www.fvap.org for registration, absentee ballots and information about
voting.

NNS080930-14. Sea Services&apos; Religious Diversity Reflection of Society&gt;From Chief of Chaplains Public Affairs

WASHINGTON (NNS) -- Like the nation, the Navy is extremely diverse. The
term diversity encompasses not only the categories of race, age, gender
and national origin, but also religion.

Religion helps people understand their places in the world and how their
military duties are part of their larger perspectives on life.&quot;Many of us find a great deal of compatibility between our religious
beliefs and the Navy&apos;s core values of honor courage and commitment,&quot;said Rear Adm. Alan T. Baker, chief of chaplains.&quot;The majority of
Sailors and Department of Navy civilians embrace religion in their
efforts to be healthy people and good citizens.&quot;This September, Muslims around the world observed Ramadan, a sacred
month of fasting in which they make a special effort to be true to
themselves and act unselfishly. They contemplated their faith, spend
less time in worrying about every day life and take special care to give
charitably to the poor.

On Sept. 29 Jews celebrated Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. They
observe Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, 10 days later. On this, the
most solemn day of the Jewish year, they ask forgiveness for broken
promises to God.&quot;Spiritual celebrations play a profound role. Celebrations such as
Ramadan and Rosh Hashanah exemplify the richness of our religious
expression.&quot;said Baker.&quot;They give us an opportunity to re-examine who
we have become and what we have done with our lives.&quot;Many Sailors and Marines identify with established religions and
religious faith expressions, yet a growing number of young people see
spirituality differently. The most recent Religious Faith Code data
released in June reveals more than 75 percent of Sailors and Marines
list some religious preference. Navy personnel identify themselves with
more than 109 different faith groups in the Religious Faith Code Report.

They draw from multiple traditions to form their own spiritual
expressions. Many of them have a concept of a higher power and witness
its influence on their lives yet do not identify with traditional faith
groups. They see religion or spirituality as something they draw on as
needed, to help them through difficult moments or to mark significant
achievements.&quot;Our diversity of religious beliefs requires more than a mere awareness
of a person&apos;s spiritualitywe need an environment that respects and
accommodates religious expression,&quot;said Baker.&quot;Navy chaplains and
religious program specialists are uniquely positioned to help commanding
officers meet the spiritual needs of Sailors. They are trained in
accommodation, sensitive to all religious expressions and are the
command experts in communicating with religious organizations and faith
communities.&quot;Currently, more than 800 active component Navy chaplains represent more
than 90 faith groups.

NNS080930-05. Peruvian Sub BAP Arica Completes Successful U.S. Deployment

By Lt. Kevin A. Beatley, Commander Submarine Force Assistant
Diesel-Electric Submarine Initiative Program Manager

NORFOLK (NNS) -- The Peruvian Submarine BAP Arica (SS-36) recently
completed a successful deployment to the U.S. East Coast to participate
in various submarine training exercises and events while supporting the
U.S. Navy Diesel-Electric Submarine Initiative (DESI).

BAP Arica was in the United States to extend Peru&apos;s focus on
partner-nation interaction and training and operated in the area
throughout the spring and summer. Her 142-day deployment was the seventh
consecutive Peruvian submarine deployment in support of DESI, making
Peru the longest participant in the program to date and demonstrating
the capabilities of their modern submarine force.

Arica&apos;s deployment was highlighted by participation in the USS Theodore
Roosevelt (CVN-71) Carrier Strike Group&apos;s Composite Training Unit
Exercise (COMPTUEX) and Joint Task Force Exercise (JTFEX) along with
other foreign vessels. She proved to be a formidable adversary and
brought realism to the anti-submarine warfare (ASW) training events
allowing all units to gain experience operating against a quiet platform.

BAP Arica also participated as opposition force (OPFOR) in the USS Iwo
Jima (LHD-7) Expeditionary Strike Group&apos;s COMPTUEX where she was crucial
in completing theater ASW training objectives. When not training with an
entire CSG or ESG, Arica flawlessly conducted trials at the Atlantic
Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) as well as provided a target
platform for the ASW Helicopter Squadrons based out of Mayport, Florida.

In port, the crew of Arica enjoyed the hospitality of Mayport Naval
Station and Kings Bay Submarine Base where the crew rested and completed
minor maintenance for their successful underway operations. They honed
their tactical skills during the port visit to Kings Bay when the crew
had the opportunity to utilize the training facilities at the Trident
Training Facility. Throughout their stay in the United States, the crew
was able to foster friendly relationships with U.S. personnel,
furthering the success of this bilateral program and ensuring successful
future joint operations between the two navies.

Arica departed Mayport in route to Callao, Peru, Aug. 11 and has
completed a port visit to U.S. Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,
making her the first submarine to visit Guantanamo Bay in more than 15
years.

NNS080930-16. Mercy Skipper Posts Final Weblog Entry

By Bill Doughty, Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet Public Affairs

ABOARD USNS MERCY (NNS) -- The commanding officer of USNS Mercy (T-AH
19) brought the ship&apos;s log into the 21st century with his Skipper&apos;s
Scrivenings Weblog, which wrapped up Sept. 28 at the conclusion of
Pacific Partnership 2008.

Capt. Bob Wiley&apos;s blog, which began in May, featured updates of the
Navy&apos;s humanitarian civic assistance mission as Mercy visited the
Philippines, Vietnam, Timor Leste, Papua New Guinea and Micronesia.
Military service members, non-governmental organizations and other
volunteers built schools and roads, provided medical and dental care,
offered veterinary services and made friends.&quot;It has been such a privilege to be able to take a ship built for war
and to use it for such a tremendous instrument of peace,&quot;said Wiley in
his final blog posting of Skipper&apos;s Scrivenings.

Wiley&apos;s postings throughout the summer offered a behind-the-scenes look
at life aboard Mercy, from promotions on the bridge to surgeries in the
operating room, as well as a philosopher&apos;s insight into the reasons for
the mission.&quot;It used to be said America was protected from the world&apos;s ills and
troubles by the vastness of two oceans,&quot;Wiley wrote.&quot;This is no longer
the case. With today&apos;s modern transportation and communication systems,
the oceans no longer separate from the rest of the world, if anything
they join us together! The places that used to be &apos;way over there&apos; are
getting closer to us every day. The neighborhood is shrinking - and like
all good neighbors, we must trust and depend on each other.&quot;Readers posted comments on Wiley&apos;s blog. Many came from grateful
parents, former Mercy shipmates or recipients of Pacific Partnership
services.

On Sept. 1&quot;Nenginin&quot;of Chuuk, Federated States of Micronesia, wrote a
comment.&quot;Even after your departure today, we are still amazed when we think back
to what you and everyone on the PP08 team did for the people of Chuuk,&quot;said Nenginin.&quot;The sight of the beautiful Mercy in the Chuuk Lagoon
will forever live in our hearts.&quot;Other postings came from Africa, Australia and from throughout North
America.&quot;Captain Bob, we just wanted to thank you for having a blog so we can
keep track of where you are and what you are doing,&quot;wrote&quot;Jan and
Jack&quot;on June 17.&quot;Our daughter is aboard your ship, and it gives us
great joy to know where she is and the great work she is a part of.&quot;Highlights of Wiley&apos;s blog were the dozens of photos and heartfelt
stories he shared about patients whose lives were transformed and saved
by Pacific Partnership.

In his wrap-up entry Wiley, a career mariner with the Military Sealift
Command, thanked those who supported his blog, and talked about
measuring the success of Pacific Partnership 2008.&quot;It&apos;s not simply about numbers,&quot;he wrote.&quot;First and foremost, this
mission was about diplomacy. It was about building relationships with
the people who we share this immense span of ocean we call the Pacific.
As a mariner, I have spent most of the last 32 years sailing these
waters. I have come to know these people as if they were regular
neighbors. And I know it&apos;s the relationships between neighbors that will
build the foundation for a good neighborhood.&quot;The Navy&apos;s humanitarian/civic assistance and disaster relief missions,
part of the Maritime Strategy, demonstrates the need to build
cooperation in a world joined, not separated, by oceans.

NNS080930-03. Kauffman Sailors Help Clinic in Guatemala

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class J.T. Bolestridge, Destroyer
Squadron 40 Public Affairs

PUERTO BARRIOS, Guatemala (NNS) -- Sailors from USS Kauffman (FFG 59),
Helicopter Anti-submarine Squadron Light (HSL) 42 Detachment Seven and
Destroyer Squadron (DESRON) 40 completed a community relations (COMREL)
project Sep. 26 at the Entre Rios Health Center in Puerto Barrios,
Guatemala.

During the day long outreach project, DESRON 40 Chaplain Lt. Joe Molina
and Kauffman&apos;s Navy Counselor 1st Class (SW/SCW) James O&apos;Brien led 25
volunteers in the cleaning and painting of the interior and entrance of
the health center, a 1,500 square-foot facility which provides care to
over 14,000 Guatemalans living in the rural area of Puerto Barrios.

Giving to those less fortunate and sharing in the culture of host
nations fits directly in with the Partnership of Americas 2008 (POA 08)
mission of strengthening regional partnerships.&quot;COMRELs are important because they provide us a chance to show the
people around the world that we really do care about them,&quot;said
Operations Specialist 2nd Class Brandon Bloomberg.&quot;It gives us a better
understanding of how people in other nations live their lives.&quot;Yeoman 2nd Class Reid Lundie volunteered for the project in Puerto
Barrios and said his hands-on efforts directly supported theater
security cooperation goals.&quot;We&apos;re here to continue to strengthen our partnerships with Central
America,&quot;said Lundie.&quot;Being out in the community and helping others
that need our help directly contributes to that partnership.&quot;In addition to the work the volunteers accomplished at the clinic, U.S.
Sailors also brought Project Handclasp donations of first aid and
hygiene products to the clinic. The health center nurse and
administrator, Gloria Diaz, said she was impressed with the work of the
U.S. Sailors and appreciative of the donations.&quot;This is my first experience working with US military assistance. You
are a great, hard working team and your help to us is very timely,&quot;said
Diaz.&quot;These hygiene and first aid donations will go a long way in
assisting the community that we love.&quot;Project Handclasp is an official Chief of Naval Operations&apos; program,
which coordinates transportation and delivery of donated humanitarian,
educational and goodwill material. Through the cooperation of numerous
donors, Project Handclasp has been able to ship approximately 1.5
million pounds of charitable materials overseas annually for the past
several years. Kate Thomas, the Puerto Barrios health center physician,
said the donated goods will be a great benefit to the clinic.&quot;What a great help to the community! This provides much needed help and
fills the gap in funding and assistance from our government due to lack
of resources,&quot;said Thomas.&quot;I appreciate your initiative and all the
hard work in making this possible.&quot;USS Kauffman, with HSL-42 Detachment 7 embarked, and USS Farragut are
assigned to Destroyer Squadron 40 and are deployed in support of POA 08
operations which are being held from April to October throughout South
America, Central America, and the Caribbean. POA 08, sponsored by U.S.
Southern Command and implemented by U.S. Naval Forces Southern Command
(NAVSO)/U.S. 4th Fleet, emphasizes interoperability and cooperation
between U.S. and partner nation&apos;s maritime forces through a variety of
exercises and events.

NNS080930-13. Submarine Missouri Reaches First Major Milestone

By Chief Mass Communication Specialist (SW/AW) Dean Lohmeyer, Commander
Submarine Force Public Affairs

NORTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. (NNS) -- The Virginia-class attack submarine USS
Missouri (SSN 780) reached her first major milestone Sept. 27, during
her keel authentication ceremony held at the General Dynamics Electric
Boat facility in North Kingstown.

Caesar S. DeSanto Sr. welded the initials of Rebecca W. Gates onto a
plate of steel to symbolize the authentication of the keel. Gates, the
wife of Secretary of Defense, Robert M. Gates, is the sponsor for
Missouri, the seventh Virginia-class submarine to join the fleet.

U.S. Rep. Ike Skelton, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee,
was the principal speaker for the ceremony.&quot;All Missourians can take pride that a namesake to the &apos;Mighty Mo&apos; will
soon be joining the fleet, this time in the silent service,&quot;said
Skelton, in a reference to the World War II-era battleship USS Missouri
(BB 63).

Skelton thanked Gates for accepting the role of sponsor for the fifth
ship to bear the name USS Missouri.&quot;Being a sponsor is not a one- or two-ceremony job,&quot;added Skelton.&quot;This is your ship&quot;- he spoke of Missouri&apos;s initial manning crew, who
were standing in formation next to the stage -&quot;These are your Sailors.
A sponsor may stay as involved as she wishes with her ship, and I hope
that you do.&quot;Skelton, who has represented Missouri&apos;s 4th Congressional District since
1977, pointed out that many of the Sailors that will haul down
Missouri&apos;s commissioning pennant when the submarine is decommissioned
more than three decades from now won&apos;t be born for another five to 10 years.&quot;Our submarine force is built upon a strong legacy of selecting and
training the best people, building and maintaining the best ships, and
equipping those ships with the latest technology and most advanced
equipment,&quot;said Commander Submarine Force Vice Adm. John Donnelly.&quot;Today, Missouri will complete a significant milestone toward adding to
that legacy. She will join her sister ships of the Virginia class to
provide a huge leap forward in capabilities to accomplish new missions
in this new century.&quot;Chairman of the USS Missouri Commissioning Committee Sam Bushman
attended the ceremony.&quot;I think it&apos;s wonderful,&quot;said Bushman, a small business owner from
Missouri&apos;s capital of Jefferson City.&quot;We had ships named Missouri in
the Navy during the 19th and 20th centuries, and it&apos;s nice to have a new
Missouri joining the fleet again in the 21st century.&quot;Cmdr. Dale F. Green, officer in charge of Pre-Commissioning Unit
Missouri, was happy to see the ship reach this first of three major
milestones. The other two milestones are christening and commissioning
ceremonies.&quot;We consider it to be an honor to be the able to continue the great
history the name USS Missouri brings to the fleet,&quot;said Green.&quot;We try
to fold a lot of USS Missouri history into what we do on the ship, using
one of the guiding principles of the chiefs mess  heritage  in our
everyday activities.&quot;While most keel authentication ceremonies are attended by only a few
crew members, Green brought his entire crew to Rhode Island for this
ceremony.&quot;We&apos;ve tried to make this a very big deal for the crew, which is why our
entire crew was here today,&quot;said Green.&quot;We wanted them to understand
that this was a very big deal. It&apos;s important for the first crew to be
molded into the team that&apos;s building the ship.&quot;The other two members of the triad building Missouri are General
Dynamics Electric Boat, Groton, Conn., and Northrop-Grumman
Shipbuilding, Newport News, Va., who have a teaming agreement to share
construction of the first 10 of a planned 30 Virginia-class submarines.&quot;Between the three of us, we will form what the ship is going to be,
from the steel to the people,&quot;added Green.&quot;This is really a shipyard
thing today, but it was important for me to get the crew involved, to
get them invested in it. To a man, everyone was excited about being a
part of the ceremony.&quot;The first ship to bear the name USS Missouri was a combination
steam/sail vessel commissioned in 1842, only 21 years after the state
was admitted to the union. The second Missouri was a side-wheel steamer
that saw service for the Confederate Navy on the Mississippi River
during the Civil War. The third Missouri (BB 11), a battleship
commissioned in 1903, participated in President Theodore Roosevelt&apos;s
Great White Fleet that made an around-the-world tour displaying U.S.
naval power Dec. 16, 1907 to Feb. 22, 1909.

The most recent and perhaps most famous ship to bear the name Missouri
was an Iowa-class battleship (BB 63). The ship saw nearly continuous
combat action from her arrival in the Pacific theater in 1944 to hosting
the Japanese surrender ceremony in Tokyo Bay that ended World War II
Sept. 2, 1945. The ship later saw service in the Korean War before being
decommissioned in 1955. She returned to active naval service in 1986 and
fired some of the first strikes of the first Persian Gulf War. She was
decommissioned again in 1992 and is now a floating museum in Pearl Harbor.

The submarine Missouri is expected to join the fleet during a
commissioning ceremony in the summer of 2010.

NNS080930-15. Combined Task Force 53 Maintains Supply Lines

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Matt Snodgrass, Commander,
U.S. Naval Forces Central Command/Commander, U.S. 5th Fleet Public Affairs

MANAMA, Bahrain (NNS) -- Combined Task Force 53 (CTF-53) provides
operational logistical support for the U.S. 5th Fleet and coalition
forces both ashore and afloat, a mission that is essential for ensuring
security and stability in the region.

CTF-53 coordinates replenishment-at-sea efforts and delivers passengers,
mail, cargo, ammunition, provisions and fuel throughout the 5th Fleet
area of operations (AOO) via air, land and sea modes, helping to ensure
Sailors aboard ships have what they need to complete their missions.&quot;By handling the logistics in the 5th Fleet area of operation, CTF-53
allows the warfighter to rest assured that the logistics and sealift
support needed to execute will be available anytime, anywhere,&quot;said
Capt. Steve Kelley who is responsible for all CTF-53 assets.

CTF-53 was established in 1992 to perform operational logistical
coordination and given tactical control over all assigned logistics
forces. In 2005, CTF-53 combined with Military Sealift Command Central
to provide oversight for more than 50 strategic sealift ships in the 5th
Fleet AOO.&quot;Combining the two commands made the mission of supplying the 5th Fleet
ships more efficient and enabled them to do their job better,&quot;said Kelley.
To transport the cargo and personnel that the 5th Fleet needs, CTF-53
utilizes various aircraft to conduct their mission.&quot;We have MH-60 Knight Hawk helicopters, MH-53E Sea Dragon helicopters
and various cargo aircraft, such as C-130, C-40, C-12 and C-2,&quot;said
Lt.j.g. Andrew Haley.&quot;Each aircraft performs specific tasks that enable
us to get personnel, equipment and supplies where they need to be.&quot;During the course of any given week, CTF-53 moves 407,000 pounds of
cargo, 47,000 lbs. of mail and 730 passengers in support of Maritime
Security Operations (MSO) as well as Operation Iraqi Freedom and
Operation Enduring Freedom.&quot;CTF-53 plays a vital role in supporting Maritime Security Operations as
well as Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom,&quot;said
Lt. Kristen Christensen, a force protection officer for CTF-53.&quot;Keeping 5th Fleet ships supplied allows them to remain at sea and
provide invaluable support for coalition forces operating on the ground
in Iraq and Afghanistan.&quot;Sailors serving at sea rely on steady supplies in order to effectively
conduct their missions. CTF-53 helps ensure those serving at sea have
the food, water, fuel, armament and essential supplies that keep their
mission readiness at its peak.

MSO help develop security in the maritime environment. From security
arises stability that results in global economic prosperity. MSO
complement the counterterrorism and security efforts of regional nations
and seek to disrupt violent extremists&apos; use of the maritime environment

NNS080930-02. Rescued Climber&apos;s Family Thanks Whidbey SAR Crew

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Tucker M. Yates, Fleet Public
Affairs Center, Det. Northwest

OAK HARBOR, Wash. (NNS) -- The family of a young climber showed their
appreciation to the Naval Air Station (NAS) Whidbey Island Search and
Rescue (SAR) crew who performed the rescue at Hangar 1 on NAS Whidbey
Island Sept. 26.

Jake Patterson was climbing with his friend Jeff Robinson on Mount
Deception in the northeast Olympic Mountains July 4 when he received
serious injuries falling off a 100-foot ridge. Ground rescue wasn&apos;t an
option due to the rugged terrain, so, initially, a U.S. Coast Guard
helicopter from Coast Guard Air Station Port Angeles attempted the
rescue, but was unable to maneuver into position.&quot;That rescue that day involved the Coast Guard trying to get in multiple
times in the daylight and couldn&apos;t do it. Then, it got dark; so now it&apos;s
really hard. They called us and said they couldn&apos;t get in there because
they couldn&apos;t do it with night vision goggles (NVGs),&quot;said Capt. Gerral
David, NAS Whidbey Island commanding officer.&quot;So, we have this crew go in at night with one side of the aircraft
using NVGs, the other using lights,&quot;continued David.&quot;They took the
helicopter so far in the only way out was straight back.&quot;The crew who performed the rescue included Lt. Cmdr. Werner
Rauchenstein, Lt. Patrick Smith, Chief Hospital Corpsman (AW/FMF/PJ/NAC)
Greg Highfill, Aviation Warfare Systems Operator 1st Class (AW/NAC) Chad
Lewis, and Aviation Warfare Systems Operator 2nd Class (AW/NAC) Chris
Wedding. Highfill was lowered to the victim and detached from the
aircraft to evaluate and give medical assistance before being hauled
back up to the MH-60S Knighthawk with Patterson. Patterson was then
transported to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle.

Patterson&apos;s father, Nate, a retired Navy captain and surgeon, pinned an
air medal on each of the crew members during an awards ceremony.
Patterson&apos;s family also presented them with a picture of Jake and Jeff
in their climbing regalia.&quot;If anything, I&apos;ve learned it&apos;s not going to work without the person who
changes the oil, or cleans the windshield  every single one of you
here, from the bottom of my heart for my family and the Robinsons, thank
you. It doesn&apos;t sound like much, but from the bottom of my heart, thank
you,&quot;said Nate.&quot;They put their lives at risk to save my son, somebody they didn&apos;t even
know. How do you thank someone for that? I can never be grateful
enough,&quot;said Selene Patterson, Jake&apos;s mother.

SAR crews do not have the opportunity to get feedback from more of the
rescues they conduct. They were very appreciative of the visit and glad
to see Jake was doing well.&quot;Personally I feel Jake&apos;s presence, his ability to be here, far exceeded
receiving the award,&quot;said Rauchenstein.&quot;Saving lives sounds really
good and being face-to-face with the person you&apos;ve had a direct impact
on is pretty cool.&quot;For more news from Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, visit

NNS080930-08. USS Ford Returns Home to Everett

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Scott Dagendesh, Fleet Public
Affairs Center, Det. Northwest

EVERETT, Wash. (NNS) -- USS Ford (FFG 54) returned from a five-month
deployment to her homeport at Naval Station Everett Sept. 28.

While deployed to the eastern Pacific, Ford, along with USS Jarrett (FFG
33) and USS Tortuga (LSD 46) participated in Combined Afloat Readiness
and Training (CARAT), a series of exercises intended to bring about
stronger international relations with many Southeastern Asian nations.&quot;[We] were able to visit Thailand, the Philippines, Brunei, Singapore,
Malaysia, Indonesia and Japan,&quot;said Ens. Anthony Smith.&quot;While we were
in these countries, we participated in bilateral naval exercises, both
in port and underway, which focused on interoperability between us and
them, as well as between themselves.&quot;Sailors received training for a variety of situations including
anti-piracy, disaster relief, visit, board, search, and seizure tactics,
multi-ship tactics, and anti-submarine operations.&quot;This was a very successful deployment,&quot;said Ford&apos;s Command Master
Chief (SW/AW) Donald Eddleman.&quot;We did about 30 [community relations]
projects which included everything from handing out soccer balls and
books to barbeque events. Our crew did something each day and promoted
good relations with the people of the host nations. Each Sailor was an
outstanding ambassador for the United States and the Navy.&quot;&quot;While we were in port, we had a wide variety of activities for the
Sailors,&quot;said Commanding Officer, Cmdr. John Wilshusen.&quot;We make an
effort to get involved with multiple community relations-type projects.
About 40 to 50 of my crew members were involved at any given time
working with an orphanage, schools, hospitals, cleaning up parks or
distributing toys which had been donated. The Sailors had a good time
doing all those things and it&apos;s fun to watch.&quot;Sailors aboard Ford encountered various challenges while at sea.&quot;We worked with six different navies in a span of approximately three
and-a-half months, said Wilshusen.&quot;Each navy had different
capabilities, different language barriers and so on. It was a great
challenge, but the crew overcame. Now the Sailors are able to enjoy a
much needed rest.&quot;Ford is the 48th ship of the Oliver Hazard Perry class frigates. The
ship was named after Gunner&apos;s Mate 2nd Class Patrick Osborne Ford, who
served in Vietnam as a patrol boat gunner, and received the Navy Cross.

NNS080930-09. Navy Professional Reading Program&quot;2.0&quot;Previewed Aboard
PCU Stockdale

By Lt. j.g. Jeffrey White, Pre-Commissioning Unit Stockdale Public Affairs

BATH, Maine (NNS) -- A week after returning from its initial sea trials,
Pre-Commissioning Unit (PCU) Stockdale&apos;s (DDG 106) crew received the
updated version of the Navy Professional Reading Program (NPRP) book
collection Sept. 25.

While NPRP will officially roll out version&quot;2.0&quot;in October, Stockdale
was selected to receive an advanced preview, bringing the program to one
of the Navy&apos;s newest ships.

First introduced to the fleet in October 2006 aboard the Navy&apos;s oldest
ship, USS Constitution, NPRP has reached thousands of Sailors and
officers in the fleet and ashore, encouraging a lifelong habit of
reading and learning.

The second version of the program changes five books, all selected by
the Chief of Naval Operations, within the collection. These updates to
the program reflect the changing world and growing challenges the United
States faces.

Professor John Jackson, the NPRP program manager, based at the Naval War
College in Newport, R.I., presented the updated collection to
prospective Commanding Officer, Cmdr. Fred Kacher. Dr. Jim Stockdale,
Vice Adm. James B. Stockdale&apos;s oldest son, also attended the ceremony.&quot;Today, we have the honor to be the first ship to receive this newest
edition of a collection of books that celebrate the values and history
of the greatest Navy of the world,&quot;said Kacher.&quot;Admiral Stockdale&apos;s study of philosophy, political systems and world
events  all topics touched on in this collection  better enabled him
to resist and outsmart his captors and most importantly lead the other
POWs during his seven-and-a-half-year imprisonment.&quot;One of the Navy&apos;s most decorated officers, Stockdale was awarded the
Medal of Honor and four Silver Stars for his heroic leadership and
resistance as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. Stockdale relied on the
principles he learned as a student of classic literature for strength
and endurance during the toughest periods of his captivity in Vietnam.

These teachings, along with his fearless leadership and unwavering
courage, allowed Stockdale and many American prisoners of war to return
home safely in 1973. During following assignments and ultimately as
president of the Naval War College, Stockdale was able to expound on
these teachings and continue his successful literary career as a scholar
and orator.&quot;Two Souls Indivisible,&quot;one of the new additions to NPRP, is the story
of two prisoners of war in Vietnam, one a white southern naval aviator
and the other a black Air Force officer, held at the same prisoner of
war camp, where Stockdale was the senior officer. In a letter read to
the crew during the NPRP presentation, that southern naval aviator,
Porter Halyburton, described how Stockdale inspired them throughout
their ordeal.&quot;Our purpose this morning was two fold: to present the newest additions
to the Navy Professional Reading Program and also to recognize the
unique bond that links Admiral Stockdale&apos;s namesake ship to the oldest
war college in the world,&quot;said Jackson.&quot;The subjects discussed in
these books, heritage, leadership, war fighting and critical thinking
are interwoven into the curricula of the Naval War College.&quot;With this collection of books now aboard Stockdale, the crew has a
reference library that aligns with six areas of importance for the naval
professional: leadership, naval and military heritage, joint and
combined warfare, regional and cultural awareness, critical thinking,
and management and strategic planning.&quot;I look forward to reading &apos;Two Souls Indivisible,&apos;&quot;said Ship&apos;s
Serviceman Seaman Gerson Pimentel.&quot;It is an inspiring story that will
give me an interesting perspective from some great Navy heroes and
hopefully help me in my career.&quot;For more information about the Navy Professional Reading Program, visit
www.navyreading.navy.mil.

PCU Stockdale is under construction at Bath Iron Works, will be
commissioned in the spring of 2009 and homeported in San Diego.

in the Arabian Gulf and Resourcing the Maritime Strategy.&quot;We must also continue the fight in the global struggle against violent

fill critical individual augmentee (IA) billets,&quot;Curtis added.

Guest speakers at the symposium included Vice Adm. Bernard McCullough,
Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Integration of Capabilities and
Resources (N8); Rear Adm. Nevin Carr, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the
Navy, International Programs Director, Navy International Program
Office; Rear Adm. Philip Greene Jr., Commander, Joint Task Force, Horn
of Africa; Rear Adm. Charles Martoglio, Director for Operations, J3,
U.S. Pacific Command; and Rear Adm. Scott Swift, prospective Commander,
Carrier Group 9.&quot;I appreciate all of your hard work and dedication that you provide to
the waterfront every day. Continue doing amazing things for the surface
Navy and getting back to basics,&quot;said Curtis during his opening remarks.

NNS080923-12. USS De Wert Intercepts 3.6 Metric Tons of Cocaine&gt;From USS De Wert Public Affairs

USS DE WERT, At Sea (NNS) -- While on patrol in the Eastern Pacific
Ocean, units assigned to the U.S. Navy&apos;s 4th Fleet and the U.S. Coast
Guard intercepted a fishing vessel carrying over three metric tons of
cocaine Sept. 20.

The combined team of USS De Wert (FFG 45), with embarked helicopter
Anti-Submarine Squadron Light 46 Detachment 1, and U.S. Coast Guard Law
Enforcement Detachment (LEDET) 101 intercepted the fishing vessel in a
nighttime interdiction, capturing seven suspected narcotics smugglers
and the large cargo of cocaine with an estimated import value of $96
million.

While De Wert was coming alongside the fishing vessel experienced a
mechanical problem and LEDET 101 and De Wert&apos;s Rescue and Assistance
Team were deployed to render assistance and to ensure the safety of the
vessel&apos;s crew. Subsequent to the rendering of assistance, a search of
the vessel revealed 145 bales of cocaine. The narcotics were seized
under the authority of the Coast Guard LEDET.

This seizure comes just a week after Sailors from USS McInerney (FFG 8)
and LEDET 404, in conjunction with Patrol Squadron 26, intercepted a
self-propelled semi submersible in the Eastern Pacific Ocean carrying
over seven metric tons of cocaine.

The coordinated actions of the U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, and Joint
Interagency Task Force-South (JIATF-S) were instrumental to the
successful interdiction of narcotics.

De Wert, homeported in Mayport, Fla., is deployed in Latin America under
the operational control of U.S. Naval Forces Southern Command/ U.S. 4th
Fleet, conducting counter illicit trafficking operations in support of
JIATF-South, U.S. law enforcement and participating nations drug control
policy.

De Wert is also supporting the U.S. Maritime Strategy by conducting
theater security cooperation events, such as community relation projects
Project Handclasp distributions, in the Caribbean and Latin America.

NNS080923-03. MCPON, MCPOCG Open Global Maritime Senior Enlisted Symposium

By Senior Chief Mass Communication Specialist (SW/AW) Bill Houlihan,
MCPON Public Affairs

HONOLULU (NNS) -- Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy (MCPON)
(SW/FMF) Joe R. Campa Jr. and Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast
Guard (MCPOCG) Charles&quot;Skip&quot;Bowen opened the second Global Maritime
Senior Enlisted Symposium Sept. 22 at the Waikiki Hyatt Regency in Honolulu.

Senior enlisted leaders from 40 nations are in attendance. Topics of
discussion over the course of the symposium will include multinational
interoperability, interpersonal relations between international partners
and nations, with a significant focus on enlisted development.&quot;As the senior enlisted leaders of our respective services, we help our
organizations to succeed through deckplate leadership,&quot;said Bowen.&quot;There is no better place to start building a better tomorrow than here.&quot;Campa and Bowen attended the first Senior Enlisted Symposium last year
in New Zealand said this year&apos;s will be the next step in strengthening
relationships. In his opening remarks, Campa said the key to the
symposium&apos;s success will be the level of conversation between all the
leaders.&quot;In the U.S. Navy and the United States Coast Guard every chief in the
mess has a voice,&quot;said Campa.&quot;I view this symposium much the same way.
Like a chief&apos;s mess, candor is valued and each point of view carries
equal weight. All of you have a voice as we create a global community of
senior enlisted leaders.&quot;The international attendees will spend much of the week in small-group
seminars discussing challenges and opportunities common to specific
regions. Many of the seminars and panel discussions will be moderated by
professors on loan for the event from the United States Naval War
College in Newport, R.I.

Campa said the next three days have great potential to positively affect
the level of cooperation between countries, and between the men and
women who serve each of the services represented here.&quot;What we have here as a great opportunity to establish friendships
grounded in trust, common goals and shared responsibilities. As we learn
from one another this week I believe we take a step in developing the
citizens who serve our nations at sea.&quot;Bowen made specific mention of the momentum built by Warrant Officer of
the New Zealand Navy Neil Roberts as it was his initiative to hold the
first symposium last November in Auckland. Bowen said he hoped this
year&apos;s conference would build on the foundation Roberts laid last winter.&quot;It has been said that, &apos;all men of the sea are brothers.&apos; I believe
those words to be true,&quot;said Bowen.&quot;I also believe that the
cross-pollinated experiences and connections made this week will pay
huge dividends for future peaceful and beneficial interactions between
our services and countries.&quot;On Sept. 23, attendees will hear remarks from Chief of Naval Operations,
Adm. Gary Roughead and United States Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Thad Allen.

NNS080923-15. Mercy Returns Home from Pacific Partnership&gt;From U.S. 3rd Fleet Public Affairs

SAN DIEGO (NNS) -- Military Sealift Command hospital ship, USNS Mercy
(T-AH 19), returns to San Diego Sept. 25 after completing Pacific
Partnership, a four-month humanitarian/civic assistance (HCA) and
theater security cooperation mission, conducted with countries from the
Western Pacific and Southeast Asia.

Throughout the 2008 Pacific Partnership mission, Mercy served as an
enabling platform for military and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)
to coordinate and carry out HCA efforts in the Republic of the
Philippines, Vietnam, the Federated States of Micronesia, Timor-Leste
and Papua New Guinea. As part of the Maritime Strategy, the
relationships built and sustained with multinational partners in the
Asia-Pacific region through exercises and professional and military
exchanges help in humanitarian efforts and preserve peace and stability
in the region.

During this year&apos;s mission, more than 90,000 patients were treated by
the medical teams in various locations throughout the Western Pacific,
including more than 1,300 surgery patients and more than 14,000 dental
patients, who received dental care and treatment.
Community outreach and improvement included 26 engineering projects
ranging from the construction of a waste-water treatment facility in the
Philippines to the construction of a community center in Papua New
Guinea. Many NGOs participated throughout the Pacific Partnership 2008
mission, including the Aloha Medical Mission, Project Hope, Operation
Smile, The University of California San Diego Pre-Dental Society,
International Relief Teams and others already operating, and working
solely within, the countries Mercy visited.

Medical and engineering professionals from the partner and host nations
of Australia, Canada, Chile, India, Indonesia, Japan, New Zealand,
Republic of Korea, Portugal, Singapore, Republic of the Philippines,
Vietnam, Timor-Leste, Papua New Guinea and the Federated States of
Micronesia served on the Pacific Partnership team.

Mercy&apos;s crew included personnel from public health/preventive medicine;

NNS080923-17. Navy Rolls Out Littoral Combat Ship Anti-Submarine Warfare
Mission Package

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SW/AW) Brian Gaines, Fleet
Public Affairs Center San Diego

SAN DIEGO (NNS) -- A ceremony to mark the rollout of the anti-submarine
warfare (ASW) mission module for the littoral combat ship (LCS) was held
Sept. 19 at Naval Base Point Loma.

The Program Executive Office for Littoral and Mine Warfare, Naval Sea
Systems Command, Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Space and Naval Warfare
Command (SPAWAR) and Space and Naval Warfare Systems, San Diego, hosted
the event.

According to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research,
Development, and Acquisitions, Anne Sandel, this is the third mission
package to be released for use with the LCS class of ships. The other
two packages are the mine and surface warfare mission modules. The LCS
can be configured to deploy with any one of the three interchangeable
mission modules typically within 96 hours depending on the nature of the
mission.&quot;LCS is a revolutionary, cutting-edge weapons system needed to fill
critical, urgent warfighting requirement gaps that exist today,&quot;said
Rear Adm. Mike Shatynski, vice commander, Naval Surface Forces.&quot;LCS was
created to deliver improved warfighting readiness and capacity to
today&apos;s fleet.&quot;The new mission module package offers new technologies, such as a new
unmanned surface vehicle (USV), the vertical takeoff unmanned aerial
vehicle (VTUAV), a new dipping sonar and towed array sonar devices.&quot;The use of unmanned technologies is advantageous in bringing the fight
to the enemy,&quot;said Capt. Mike Good, program executive officer for
littoral combat and mine warfare.&quot;This will lessen the cost of
warfighting by keeping the ship and her crew out of harm&apos;s way.&quot;According to Shatynski, and even with the newest in cutting-edge
technology, many consider the Sailor to be the most important part of
the new module package.&quot;This is a great accomplishment,&quot;added Shatynski.&quot;But it still takes Sailor know-how to launch the equipment, to analyze
the data and to employ the weapons. No machine can duplicate the crew&apos;s
depth of knowledge.&quot;The crowd of approximately 150 was treated to a demonstration of the USV
following the brief ceremony. The vehicle ran a predetermined course in
San Diego Bay showing off some of its capabilities.

LCS is a new class of warship with versatile fighting capabilities. It
is capable of open sea operation, but was designed for coastal missions.
The LCS mission modules were designed to compliment the new warship and
asymmetrical warfare threats, such as submarines and mines.

NNS080923-04. Kearsarge Medical Team Brings Hope to Haiti

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Brandon Shelander

CAZALE, Haiti (NNS) -- Medical specialists from USS Kearsarge (LHD 3)
set up a medical civic action project (MEDCAP) Sept. 22 in the
flood-ravaged mountain town of Cazale, as part of humanitarian
assistance/disaster relief operations.

Members from the Navy, Air Force, U.S. Public Health Service and
Canadian armed forces arrived in the area via a CH-53E helicopter from
Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 464. The MEDCAP team gathered their
portable supplies of medicine and marched down the mountain to the
riverside town of Cazale, braving a sheer mountain trail slick with
recent rains.&quot;Getting in here was a bit of a challenge,&quot;said Senior Master Sgt.
Cupriano Zarate, commenting on the trail still slick from recent rains.

The team set up in the Centre Sante de la Grace du Bon Samaritan, a
small medical clinic run by sisters, Licia Betor and Lori Moise, who
first came to the area 10 years ago from the United States as missionaries.&quot;I think it&apos;s great that they&apos;re here,&quot;said Betor about the MEDCAP
team&apos;s arrival,&quot;It&apos;s great for people to see other countries come to
help and to see the support. It&apos;s great for the people&apos;s morale.&quot;In the wake of Hurricane Ike, many parts of Haiti remain cut off from
vital supply routes due to massive flood damage to roads and bridges.
Cazale has no access to supplies after the bridge into town was destroyed.&quot;Fortunately we always keep things well stocked, so we at least have
enough supplies to last a couple of weeks,&quot;said Betor.&quot;It&apos;s good that
we can provide an established place for the MEDCAP to set up and work.&quot;Throughout the day, the MEDCAP team provided pediatric, general and
dermatological care to the Cazale residents, as well as de-worming
treatments.&quot;We&apos;re doing the best we can,&quot;said Zarate,&quot;We just want to see as many
people as possible.&quot;In addition to medical personnel, Kearsarge also donated food supplies
to be distributed.&quot;We&apos;re working with the local officials to distribute the donated food.
We&apos;ve come up with a color code system - red, orange and green.&quot;said
Moise, a registered nurse and medical specialist.&quot;Red is for people
who&apos;ve totally lost their homes; orange is for those whose home was
badly damaged; and green is given to who have been able to remain living
in their homes.&quot;Moise herself qualifies for a red tag. Her home was completely destroyed
by the flood waters and mud slides brought in by Ike. What she could
save, she&apos;s stacked in the yard of the health center. Her few pieces of
battered furniture are covered in mud stains, and her antique butterfly
sewing machine sits in the corner of the yard collecting dust. But
through it all, she said she&apos;s still optimistic about the future and
enjoys the time Kearsarge&apos;s team has spent helping in the region.&quot;Thank you so, so, so much because there are people all over Haiti just
like me who are doing the best they can. We were maxed out to the limit
before this flood, and we just need help. We just need help,&quot;said Moise.

NNS080923-08. Carter Hall Makes Port Call in Greece

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Katrina Parker, Iwo Jima
Expeditionary Strike Group Public Affairs

RHODES, Greece (NNS) -- Sailors and Marines aboard the amphibious dock
landing ship USS Carter Hall (LSD 50) had the opportunity to explore a
new culture during a port visit in Rhodes, Greece, Sept. 18-22.

Carter Hall&apos;s Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) department organized
a tour of the island for crew members.&quot;The tours offered by MWR give Sailors and Marines the chance to really
see what the country has to offer,&quot;said Lt.j.g. Arlene DeCindio, a
Carter Hall MWR representative.&quot;People can see the highlights of the
country and have a good time without spending a lot of money.&quot;Store Keeper 2nd Class (SW) Danielle Leal, a tour participant, credits
the sightseeing experience to MWR, which she said is one of the best
programs implemented in the Navy.&quot;It gives Sailors and Marines the opportunity to experience something
creative, interesting and fun as well as improves the morale in any
command.&quot;One of the first stops was the site of Kamiros, one of three original
cities of the island, where crew members viewed ancient ruins and
picturesque views of the nearby hills and mountains. Some of the other
sights included the village of Embona, where crew members ate authentic
Greek food, followed by a trip to a winery at Emery. Lastly, the tour
bus crossed the island to visit Lindos, a historic village preserved to
retain its traditional color and charm.

Mariana Kalhoun, a tour guide from a local travel agency, believes
exploring Rhodes lets people experience many different elements of Greek
culture.&quot;European culture is based on Roman culture, which was derived from
Greece,&quot;Kalhoun said.&quot;I think it&apos;s important for people to have a real
solid basis to know how their modern civilization came about.&quot;Leal said it was rewarding to experience a country with such a rich
culture and time-honored traditions.&quot;I can honestly say that Rhodes was one of my favorite port visits since
I&apos;ve been in the Navy,&quot;Leal said.&quot;I strongly recommend touring the
island to anyone wanting to enjoy such a fascinating and beautiful place.&quot;This was Carter Hall&apos;s second port visit during the ship&apos;s deployment as
part of the Iwo Jima Expeditionary Strike Group (ESG) to the Navy&apos;s 5th
and 6th Fleet area of responsibilities in support of maritime security
operations. The Iwo Jima ESG consists of Carter Hall; the amphibious
assault ship USS Iwo Jima (LHD 7); the transport dock ship USS San
Antonio (LPD 17); the guided-missile cruiser USS Vella Gulf (CG 72); the
guided-missile destroyer USS Ramage (DDG 61); all homeported at Norfolk,
Va.; the guided-missile destroyer USS Roosevelt (DDG 80), homeported at
Mayport, Fla.; and the fast attack submarine USS Hartford (SSN 768),
homeported at Groton, Conn.

NNS080923-21.&quot;Conversation with the Country&quot;and a New Maritime
Strategy Presented in North Carolina

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Todd Stafford, Public Affairs
Center Norfolk

DURHAM, N.C. (NNS) -- Raleigh/Durham, N.C. hosted the sixth and final
fiscal year 2008&quot;Conversation with the Country&quot;at the Durham Marriott
Convention Center Sept. 18.

More than 180 local business and community leaders attended the event
and joined in the discussion about the new Maritime Strategy and how
U.S. seapower directly benefits the people and economy of North Carolina.

The new strategy called,&quot;A Cooperative Strategy for the 21st Century
Seapower,&quot;is the first plan signed by all the sea services and
emphasizes trust among nations through collective maritime security
Raleigh/Durham is one of many areas of the country that will see great
benefits from the new strategy. The North Carolina seaports offer the
closest, most cost-efficient route to one of the fastest growing cargo
markets in the United States. In North Carolina, more than 20 percent of
all manufacturing workers depend on exports for their jobs.

Gen. James T. Conway, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, gave the
keynote luncheon address. Conway explained that the new Maritime
Strategy solidifies the partnerships between the services.&quot;If you were to ask me what&apos;s different about it, one it includes the
Coast Guard and the Navy, secondly it clears up maybe some
inconsistencies in the past about forward presence and force
projection,&quot;Conway said.&quot;This Maritime Strategy is very definitively
in the corner of forward presence. As Marines we very strongly believe
in that.&quot;Using the sea allows the deployment of the right forces and equipment to
the places they are needed since the world is 70 percent water. With the
presence of seapower, the world&apos;s trade is also secured since 90 percent
of U.S. commerce relies on sea transportation.

The strategy recognizes the economic links of the global system and how
any disruption due to regional crises overseas  manmade or natural 
can adversely impact the quality of life for citizens in the United States.

Specifically discussed during the Durham meeting was the importance of
stability for the Wilmington and Morehead City ports because of commerce
that flows from these ports throughout North Carolina and the Southeast
region.&quot;This strategy is essential to synchronizing, integrating where
appropriate, and optimizing the efforts that your Navy, your Marine
Corp, and your Coast Guard provide, day in and day out,&quot;said Rear Adm.
Fred Rosa, 5th Coast Guard District.&quot;Conversations with the Country&quot;is a series of outreach discussions
around the nation designed to communicate the new maritime strategy and
create awareness with the American people. Meetings during the current
fiscal year were held in Houston; Portland, Ore.; Denver; Los Angeles;
Miami; and Raleigh/Durham, N.C.&quot;[Regarding] our &apos;Conversations with the Country&apos; events, this is the
sixth for the year, the final one for the fiscal year. I believe they
have been enormously successful. We have connected directly with several
thousands citizens across the spectrum of business, community and civil
leadership as well as just concerned citizens,&quot;said Rear Adm. Dan
Cloyd, associate director of the Assessments Division on the staff of
the Chief of Naval Operations.&quot;It&apos;s important that they can talk with their family members about what
the maritime forces, the Navy, Marines, and Coast Guard, team do to
support our nation and our way of life,&quot;he said.

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class (SW) Brian Goodwin, Iwo Jima
Expeditionary Strike Group Public Affairs

MARMARIS, Turkey (NNS) -- The amphibious transport dock ship USS San
Antonio (LPD 17) hosted a reception for distinguished guests during a
scheduled port visit in Marmaris, Turkey Sept. 20.

The visitors from Marmaris included Turkish military and government
representatives, and the U.S. Ambassador to Turkey, Ross Wilson.&quot;We are very honored to have San Antonio&apos;s Sailors visit Marmaris for a
port visit,&quot;said Wilson.&quot;It was wonderful to celebrate this occasion
aboard a brand new Navy ship on her first deployment with these fine men
and women. I&apos;m glad to know that Marmaris, Turkey has given these
Sailors a chance to get a little rest and relaxation.&quot;This was San Antonio&apos;s first overseas reception and the crew wanted to
showcase the ship at her finest.&quot;I&apos;m extremely proud of my Sailors for getting this ship prepared for
her maiden deployment,&quot;said Cmdr. Kurt Kastner, San Antonio&apos;s
commanding officer.&quot;I viewed this reception as a wonderful opportunity
to prove what a ready and capable warship San Antonio is.&quot;Kastner also said the reception was a way to showcase the ship and
strengthen bonds with allies overseas.&quot;One of the Navy&apos;s missions in the 6th Fleet area of operations is to
build regional partnerships while in support of maritime security
operations,&quot;continued Kastner.

San Antonio&apos;s Sailors and Marines enjoyed the reception and welcomed the
chance to interact with the local distinguished visitors.&quot;This is one of those rare events that you read and hear about,&quot;said
Yeoman 2nd Class Lucien Gauthier.&quot;This event was awesome.&quot;San Antonio is deployed as part of the Iwo Jima Expeditionary Strike
Group (ESG), which also consists of the amphibious assault ship USS Iwo
Jima (LHD 7); the dock-landing ship USS Carter Hall (LSD 50); the
guided-missile cruiser USS Vella Gulf (CG 72); the guided-missile
destroyer USS Ramage (DDG 61); all homeported at Norfolk; the
guided-missile destroyer USS Roosevelt (DDG 80), homeported at Mayport,
Fla.; and the fast attack submarine USS Hartford (SSN 768), homeported
at Groton, Conn.

NNS080923-24. Members of Navy JAG Corps Prestigious Awarded U.S.
Attorney&apos;s Award

By Jen Zeldis, Office of the Judge Advocate General Public Affairs

NEW HAVEN, Conn. (NNS) -- Five hours of diligent leg work by one
military attorney provided critical evidence needed to convict a former
Navy signalman charged with transmitting classified information to
unauthorized sources.

Lt. Cmdr. Marc Brewen&apos;s quick thinking and vital knowledge of the
operational Navy provided essential support at the 11th hour in a
federal criminal investigation that spanned four years and two continents.

The U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut awarded Brewen, a
litigation attorney in the office of the Judge Advocate General, the
U.S. Attorney&apos;s Award on Sept. 12. Fellow Navy Judge Advocates Capt.
Michael Quinn, Cmdr. Shannon Kopplin, and several NCIS and FBI agents
critical to the investigation of the case against Hassan Abujihaad were
also honored.

In the beginning of 2008, with the trial imminent, the Acting United
States Attorney for the District of Connecticut, Nora Dennehy, requested
Navy assistance with the criminal case. In addition to Quinn and
Kopplin, Brewen was assigned to help.&quot;I was assigned to work through a lot of the classified information,&quot;said Brewen.&quot;AUSAs [Assistant United States Attorney] Bill Nardini and
Stephen Reynolds would tell me what or who they were looking for and I
would work with other Codes and Navy personnel to find information or
potential witnesses for the pending trial. Captain Quinn and Commander
Kopplin were instrumental in these endeavors.&quot;The biggest challenge came via a phone call on a Friday night with a
deadline of the following Monday morning. Nardini and Reynolds had
evidence that Abujihaad improperly released classified ship&apos;s movements,
including a hand drawing of the battle group&apos;s formation for a transit
through a Middle Eastern straight.

However, the judge had ruled that the evidence, standing alone, was
inadmissible in court. The AUSAs needed someone or something to
corroborate that this was the battle group&apos;s transit formation in the
spring of 2001, that the formation was not standard operating procedure,
and that the formation essentially was unique to this particular transit.

Since the transit occurred seven years prior, the AUSAs had no idea who
could help them with this problem. Brewen, with the help of Lt. Breier
Scheetz, started cold calling the 2001 battle group ship&apos;s commanding
officers and executive officers who were still in the Navy.&quot;Just by luck, we found the CO [commanding officer] of a ship that had
served as the lead ship during the battle group&apos;s transit practice. This
was within three hours of the AUSA&apos;s request for help. The former CO was
still in the Navy and promoted to captain,&quot;said Brewen.

Through a series of phone calls, Brewen linked the AUSAs with this
captain that night; giving them the weekend to work with this potential
witness in preparation for the start of trial the following Monday.

The CO was able to confirm that the signalmen on his ship had knowledge
of the formation prior to transit and had first hand knowledge of the
transit plans. In fact, the former CO stated that because the formation
was unique, it required constant communication between the ships. The
signalman played a big part in the transit maneuvers and Abujihaad&apos;s
ship, on which Abujihaad served as a signalman, was the ship directly
behind the former CO&apos;s in the formation practices. The former CO was
able to describe exactly how and why a signalman would possess detailed
knowledge of the formation. The CO was a great help to the AUSAs as they
planned and modified their trial strategy.

Brewen also found another member of the battle group&apos;s command group
that Friday night who had planned the transit&apos;s formation. This officer,
now an admiral in the Navy, was able to confirm this was a very unique
transit and designed for security purposes.

Quinn, Kopplin, and Brewen located witnesses, and reviewed,
declassified, and provided many documents to the AUSAs in the months
leading up to trial.

Brewen knew that the JAG Corps had been a huge help because Nardini
called him within hours after the conviction was announced in federal
court to express his thanks.

During the Sept. 12 awards ceremony, Dennehy recognized those who
assisted her office in a select number of high profile criminal
prosecutions and civil cases completed during the year. The ceremony
honored approximately one hundred federal and state law enforcement
officers, including three Navy judge advocates. It was held in the
Shubert Theater in New Haven.&quot;It is with great pleasure that we in the United States Attorney&apos;s
office in the District of Connecticut once again recognize our partners
in law enforcement for the outstanding work that they have done over the
course of the past year. We are grateful for the contributions you make,
honored to work alongside you, and pleased to be able to highlight your
accomplishments as you help to ensure the safety and security of the
citizens of this District,&quot;said Dennehy.

Quinn and Kopplin were presented with certificates though they were
unable to be present at the ceremony.

NNS080923-22. NSW Integrates Hydrotherapy into Physical Fitness Program

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Robyn Gerstenslager, Naval
Special Warfare Group 4 Public Affairs

NORFOLK (NNS) -- The highly-specialized human performance initiative
(HPI) in place at Naval Special Warfare Group (NSWG) 4 recently added a
hydrotherapy pool to its inventory of equipment used to prolong a
special boat operator&apos;s career.

HPI is an ongoing series of assessments, exercises, nutritional
guidelines and therapies used by Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen
(SWCC) and SEALs across the NSWG 4 claimancy. The program is modeled
after similar programs used by professional sports organizations, such
as the National Football League. Its primary goal is to prevent or heal
the damage done to a SWCC or SEALs&apos; body simply because of the nature of
his daily duties, thereby increasing career longevity.

The pool, which is manufactured by HydroWorx, is the only one of its
kind in use by a Naval Special Warfare (NSW) command. It is 15 feet long
by seven feet wide, and is four feet, six inches deep. It holds
approximately 2,000 gallons of water and has two high-powered water jets
that push water over a built-in treadmill to provide different degrees
of resistance.

The most significant benefit of having the pool available to the SWCC is
that it allows them to begin certain rehabilitation exercises long
before they would be able to on solid ground. Hydrotherapy resistance
training also increases strength and range of motion in joints and muscles.&quot;At this depth, the body is bearing only 25 percent of its weight,&quot;said
Mike Strock, the HPI program manager for NSWG 4.&quot;It allows us to train
the boat operators in a low impact environment, accelerating the
rehabilitation time; they can start these rehab exercises weeks before
they can do rehab exercises on land.&quot;SWCC and support staff who are recovering from surgery or have lower
back issues have been taking full advantage of the pool since it opened
nearly a month ago.

Strock has been conducting hydrotherapy with five to 10 personnel daily.

Rehab exercises taught in the pool include running on the treadmill
using the water jets for resistance, or&quot;weight-lifting&quot;using small
buoyant dumbbells under water to improve range of motion and strength in
the shoulders and arms.

A video camera mounted within the pool wall allows the physical
therapist to closely watch personnel on a nearby TV screen, allowing
them to analyze and correct improper movements.&quot;The TV screen is a valuable tool,&quot;said Strock.&quot;It gives us and the
guys valuable feedback on their running form and they can make the
corrections themselves by watching the screen.&quot;Specially designed massage hoses can be attached to the thermal water
jets to direct water flow for a deep tissue massage. The pool
temperature can also be dropped to 50 degrees and used for cryotherapy,
which decreases inflammation  similar to icing an injury.

Cmdr. John Mahoney, the physical therapist for NSWG 4, is extremely
pleased to have the pool available for his patients.&quot;Hydrotherapy is the preferred way of initiating strength training and
range of motion exercises on somebody who&apos;s recovering from a surgery or
an acute injury because of the buoyancy of the water,&quot;said Mahoney.&quot;It is also a huge psychological plus for our guys; to get them back in
the fight that much sooner,&quot;Mahoney added.&quot;Rehabilitation is all about
movement, and the earlier you get someone moving, the faster the
rehabilitation goes.&quot;Chief Warrant Officer Robert Galvez, of Special Boat Team 20, recently
started hydrotherapy with Strock after a lower back injury and has
already changed his way of thinking about physical therapy.&quot;It helps that this is available to us, I will definitely keep coming
back,&quot;said Galvez.&quot;I always had the mindset to just take some motrin
and push on  this pool is going to become a regular routine for me though.&quot;According to Strock the pool is open to anyone within NSW, and they
should coordinate with their command&apos;s HPI program manager to schedule a
hydrotherapy session.

NNS080923-20. NAVFAC Team Deploys to Haiti to Assess Hurricane Damage&gt;From Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast Public Affairs

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (NNS) -- A team of four Naval Facilities Engineering
Command (NAVFAC) Civil Engineer Corps (CEC) officers mobilized last week
to Haiti to assess the effects of several hurricanes that damaged the
country&apos;s key infrastructure this summer.

The CEC team, headed by Cmdr. Kevin Roye, NAVFAC Southeast Lead for the
South Atlantic Integrated Product Team, will support U.S. Southern
Command to provide damage assessment and engineering surveys of the
country. The team consists of two CEC officers from NAVFAC Southeast,
Jacksonville, Fla.; one from NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic, Norfolk, and one from
NAVFAC Southwest, San Diego.&quot;Our team is always ready and on standby to take emergency measures when
necessary,&quot;said NAVFAC Southeast Commanding Officer Capt. Doug Morton.&quot;The NAVFAC team is experienced in dealing with hurricane damage, and
will provide excellent assistance while they are in Haiti.&quot;As the team compiles reports of the damage, they will forward the
information back to NAVFAC Atlantic for further review and plan development.&quot;Going into a hurricane damaged area is not new to NAVFAC,&quot;said NAVFAC
Southeast Operations Officer Capt. Darius Banaji.&quot;We train for this.
This team will go in and assess damages so that Haiti will have a good
estimation of where they stand and what will need to be done to get them
back to some kind of normalcy.&quot;During response to Hurricane Gustav, NAVFAC Southeast deployed
Contingency Engineering Response Teams (CERTs) to New Orleans to provide
damage assessment capabilities with great success. NAVFAC Midwest,
NAVFAC Northwest, NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic and NAVFAC Southwest also had
CERTs on stand by and prepared to respond with a 48-hour notice to
provide support for Hurricanes Gustav and Ike.

In recent years, NAVFAC has deployed CERTs, comprised of structural,
electrical, and mechanical engineers, architects, roofing specialists,
community planners and construction contract specialists, to offer
professional engineering and contracting support to installations
affected by disasters such as hurricanes. Such support could include
restoration of basic installation functions such as opening roadways,
sanitation, water, electricity and communications to meet an
installation&apos;s mission readiness.

NAVFAC teams were rapidly deployed to Navy installations along the Gulf
Coast in 2005 in response to damage caused by Hurricane Katrina and in
2004 to Pensacola, Fla., in response to Hurricane Ivan. Since this time,
NAVFAC has established the Contingency Engineering business line and is
developing a more robust and structured contingency response capability
throughout the command.

NNS080923-16. Seabees Construct School in Moroni

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SCW/SW/AW) Ronald Gutridge,
Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 4 Det. HOA Public Affairs

MORONI, Grande Comore (NNS) -- A Seabee detachment from Naval
Construction Battalion (NMCB)4 is building a new schoolhouse for the
Hamramba School in the Comoros Island town of Moroni as part of the
unit&apos;s six-month deployment to the Horn of Africa (HOA).

The project consists of the construction of two individual buildings,
each will have two classrooms, a storage area and an office space. A
separate bathroom facility is also being constructed.

Due to the limited space on the school property, the Seabees were unable
to use heavy construction equipment. They completed the excavation for
all three buildings by hand, which required the removal of massive
amounts of lava rock. Once the excavation was complete, the steel
reinforced concrete foundations were handmixed and placed using buckets
and wheelbarrows.&quot;This project is different from any other of its kind,&quot;says Builder 1st
Class (SCW) Adam Beardsley, NMCB 4&apos;s Det. Comoros Project Supervisor.&quot;Since the earth we are working with is 90% lava rock, and with the
limited space, the challenges are unlimited, however it will provide my
crew with the knowledge and experience to execute future projects of
this nature.&quot;With the foundations complete, the Seabees of Detachment Comoros will
work on completing the bathroom facility and preparing the other two
buildings for the placement of the floors and walls. The project is
scheduled to be completed in July of 2009.

When the Seabees are not working on the project, they spend time
volunteering within the local community. on Monday and Thursday
evenings, Construction Electrician 3rd Class (SCW) Joshua Cruz and
Construction Mechanic 3rd Class Matthew Bosch participate in an English
discussion group at one of the local schools, teaching English to the
local community members.

The Comoros Islands consist of a group of seven islands in the
Mozambique Channel, about two-thirds of the way between northern
Madagascar and northern Mozambique. The Seabees will provide students
age six through sixteen with new updated facilities more conducive to
learning.

NMCB 4 is based out of Naval Base Ventura County, Calif. NMCB 4
Detachment Horn of Africa is deployed in support of Combined Joint Task
Force-Horn of Africa and is completing missions in various countries in
Eastern Africa.

OAK HARBOR, Wash. (NNS) -- Naval Air Station (NAS) Whidbey Island held a
Hispanic heritage celebration at the base chapel Sept. 18.

The Center for Naval Aviation Technical Training Unit (CNATTU) Whidbey
Island organized the event. Guest speakers for the celebration included
Lt. Cmdr. Henry Rendon, Patrol and Reconnaissance Wing 10 administrative
officer, and Chief Storekeeper (AW/SW) Manuel Vidaurri, a CNATTU instructor.&quot;I stood up here just thinking about the people in this room and how
it&apos;s a reflection of a lot of things, if you look around at each other,
you&apos;ll see people with different colored skin, different kinds of names
on their nametapes, it&apos;s an awesome thing,&quot;said Cmdr. Curtis
Schmidtlein, NAS Whidbey Island chaplain.&quot;Something I love about the Navy is we&apos;re all Sailors, even though we
have different names and sometimes different accents, we&apos;re all Sailors.
When we cooperate together there&apos;s a great, great amount of growth and
strength in being different and the same together. I celebrate the Navy
for the opportunity I&apos;ve had around many great Hispanics because they&apos;ve
enriched my life and made me a better person.&quot;Rendon spoke of the obstacles faced in his early life coming from
Colombia to America and his schooling in America with English as a
second language. Upon completion of high school, he enlisted in the Navy
as an aviation machinist&apos;s mate, which afforded him the opportunity to
work in aviation and, upon completion of his enlistment, to earn his
degree and be commissioned in the Navy as an aviator.&quot;The main message I want to convey to you today is that my story is not
extraordinary, and there are many who have had to overcome greater
obstacles than myself,&quot;said Rendon.&quot;However, I feel that nothing was
handed to me, nor did I expect any handouts. What got me where I am
today is hard work, and never losing sight of my goals. As a Hispanic,
it makes me incredibly proud to be standing up here today representing
you in our diverse Navy.&quot;Traditional Hispanic fare was featured as well as displays showing 39
Hispanic Medal of Honor recipients and their accomplishments.&quot;As you look around at different people from different places, they have
richness, they have things that are wonderful, that aren&apos;t like me, that
I could learn and feel and get to know and incorporate into my life,&quot;said Schmidtlein.&quot;We need to do that, we need to care for each other
and share with each other who we are and where we come from because we
never know who it is that we talk to who&apos;s going to make a change in our
life.&quot;For more news from Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, visit

NNS080923-13. VP-1 Sailors Commemorate POW/MIA Day

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Tucker M. Yates, Fleet Public
Affairs Center, Det. Northwest

OAK HARBOR, Wash. (NNS) -- Patrol Squadron (VP) 1 hosted a ceremony to
commemorate Prisoners of War/Missing in Action (POW/MIA) Recognition Day
with former members of VP-17 in Hangar 6 on Naval Air Station (NAS)
Whidbey Island Sept. 19.

National POW/MIA Recognition Day honors the courage of those who were
held as prisoners of war in foreign conflicts and to ensure those who
remain missing in action are never forgotten.&quot;Today our nation pauses to commemorate our comrades who cannot be with
us for they are prisoners of war or are declared missing in action,&quot;said Command Master Chief (AW/SW) James Reynolds, VP-1&quot;Screaming
Eagles.&quot;&quot;So, on this third Friday in September, let us remember well
the sacrifices our brothers and sisters have made.&quot;Eight former members of the VP-17&quot;White Lightnings,&quot;which was
disestablished in 1995, attended the event as part of their base tour.&quot;It&apos;s a great opportunity to honor those who have gone before us in
similar situations back in the 60s; it&apos;s fantastic, I appreciate you
being here,&quot;said Cmdr. Chris Corgnati, VP-1 commanding officer.&quot;It&apos;s important to take the time out of the day to remember those that
have gone before us who paid that price and it&apos;s a great opportunity to
reflect on those in all past conflicts as well as what&apos;s going on right
now. Everybody in this room knows somebody who&apos;s out on the front lines
today, so keep them in your thoughts and prayers.&quot;After the ceremony, the White Lightnings received a static display tour
of a P-3C Orion. Some of the members have not been to NAS Whidbey Island
in nearly 40 years.&quot;This is something more than I ever expected,&quot;said Jim Whitmus, a VP-17
Sailor in 1970.&quot;It&apos;s great being here seeing the old base again. The
last time I was here was in 1975 for Naval Reserve schooling. I haven&apos;t
seen it all yet, but it looks like there&apos;s been a lot of changes; it&apos;s
really neat.&quot;&quot;I&apos;ve never been treated this great, I think all of us to the person
would say this has really been an experience,&quot;added Sherman Tifft, a
VP-17 Sailor in 1968.

NNS080923-07. Pearl Harbor Honors National POW/MIA Recognition Day

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class John Ciccarelli Jr., Fleet
Public Affairs Center Detachment Hawaii

PEARL HARBOR (NNS) -- Naval Station Pearl Harbor commemorated Prisoner
of War/Missing in Action (POW/MIA) veterans during a recognition day
ceremony at the base memorial chapel Sept. 19.

More than 100 Sailors packed the chapel for the event and to hear one of
the longest-held Vietnam War POW, retired Capt. Gerald Coffee, speak
about his experience during captivity.&quot;It&apos;s important to commemorate POW/MIA day because these individual
lives leave a legacy to us, just as we are inspired when we visit any
historic military area where these people lost their lives,&quot;he said.

In early 1966, Coffee was shot down while flying a combat mission over
North Vietnam. For the next seven years, he was held captive by enemy
forces in various prisons in Hanoi. He was repatriated with the first
group of American POWs February 12, 1973.

Coffee shared his message of the challenges of being a POW and the
essentials of honoring them.&quot;Today is a day to remember those individuals who served time in
captivity, who are still missing and to let them and their families know
that we have not forgotten about the sacrifices they made for this
country,&quot;he added.

For Fireman Joshua Lancaster, assigned to Naval Station Pearl Harbor, it
was his first time meeting a POW.&quot;Meeting a POW made me feel proud to be an American,&quot;he said.&quot;It is
very important to honor these military members and to let everybody know
that there are still individuals out there missing.&quot;Capt. Richard W. Kitchens, commanding officer of Naval Station Pearl
Harbor, was impressed with the turn out from all of the junior Sailors.&quot;It&apos;s an inspiration to be able to listen and to understand, especially
for the junior Sailors, that this POW spent more time in a prisoner camp
than some individuals have been in the Navy,&quot;said Kitchens.

Each year, on the third Friday in September, observances of National
POW/MIA Recognition Day are held across the country on military
installations, ships, state capitols, schools and veterans facilities.

According to a proclamation by President George. W. Bush, National
POW/MIA Recognition Day is held to underscore the country&apos;s commitment
and pledge to those who are still missing in action and to their
families that America will not rest until they have achieved the fullest
possible accounting for every member of its armed forces missing in the
line of duty.

NNS080923-09. Pacific Fleet Commander Addresses Global Maritime Senior
Enlisted Symposium

By Senior Chief Mass Communication Specialist (SW/AW) Bill Houlihan,
Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy Public Affairs

HONOLULU (NNS) -- The commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet addressed
senior enlisted leaders from around the world Sept. 22 at the Global
Maritime Senior Enlisted Symposium, acknowledging that their presence is
being felt on the deckplates of each of their services.

The three-day symposium, hosted by Master Chief Petty Officer of the
Navy (MCPON) (SW/FMF) Joe R. Campa Jr. and Master Chief Petty Officer of
the Coast Guard (MCPOCG) Charles&quot;Skip&quot;Bowen, is being attended by
senior enlisted leaders from more than 40 nations from six continents.

Adm. Robert F. Willard addressed the group during a lunchtime seminar
and emphasized the importance of a traditional brand of leadership.

He said that until recently he&apos;d seen the U.S Navy&apos;s chief petty
officers drift away from their roles as deckplate leaders.&quot;We departed from that for a time,&quot;said Willard.&quot;And our senior
leaders became more locked to the desk and spent less time on the
deckplates. We saw this manifested in our enlisted force&apos;s attitude and
conduct. We also saw it in the competency of our junior officers who
relied on our chiefs to teach, not through e-mail, but alongside them.&quot;The topic of deckplate leadership came up near the end of Willard&apos;s
remarks during a question- and-answer period. Master Chief Petty Officer
of the Argentine Navy, MCPON Pedro Bonansea, asked the Pacific Fleet
commander what he felt should be the primary takeaway from the symposium.

Willard used the answer to express his hope that the senior enlisted
leaders take advantage of this unique opportunity to exchange ideas on
how to best develop men and women serving at sea.&quot;The techniques and processes that enable the hands-on leadership senior
enlisted leaders are so famous for would be a valuable exchange among
yourselves,&quot;said Willard. He added that he understands the delicate
balance many try to strike between leveraging technology and traditional
leadership techniques.&quot;I&apos;d imagine that if you polled every table you&apos;d
hear different ideas to strike that balance.&quot;Willard, who has commanded the Pacific Fleet since May 2007, has visited
nearly 30 Pacific Rim nations and has emphasized the importance of
interoperability and coordination efforts in both military operations
and humanitarian assistance. He said the keys to success across the
region lie with the abilities of the enlisted force and those who lead them.

He referenced last year&apos;s symposium in New Zealand and said the momentum
gained during the past 12 months is obvious by the numbers attending the
seminar this week in Honolulu.&quot;I&apos;ve never been in a room with as many senior enlisted leaders from so
many countries. You number more than forty, and that&apos;s most impressive.
For all of you who made the choice to attend, thank you and I hope it&apos;s
worth the opportunity.&quot;The senior enlisted symposium will conclude Sept. 24, following three
days of small-group seminars and further presentations from the U.S.
Navy Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Gary Roughead and the U.S. Coast
Guard Commandant, Adm. Thad Allen.

NNS080923-06. Columbia Sailors Carry On Tradition Of Community Service

By Lt. Chris G. Neeley, Navy Office of Community Outreach Public Affairs

COLUMBIA, S.C. (NNS) -- More than 23 Sailors from across the Midlands
volunteered to help build Habitat for Humanity homes as part of their
community service activities during this week&apos;s Columbia Navy Week.&quot;When I was in the Navy during Vietnam we spent some time building
swings and slides for children of orphanages in Indonesia. It&apos;s
wonderful to see today&apos;s generation of Sailors carrying on that
tradition by volunteering their time to help build new homes for those
who live in this community,&quot;said Dan Chambers, construction foreman and
a former boatswain&apos;s mate.

Sailors from Navy Operational Support Center Columbia (NOSC), University
of South Carolina Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC), Navy
Individual Augmentee Combat Training Command (NIACT), Navy Recruiting
District Raleigh (NRD Raleigh) and Navy Office of Community Outreach
provided more than 92 man-hours to the Habitat for Humanity construction
project.

Sailors participating cleared debris and leftover scrap materials from
the initial foundation work. They also shoveled fill dirt onto the
foundations of four homes. The work the Sailors performed will allow
future volunteers to begin flooring the homes in the next two weeks.
Each home is built with volunteers from churches, corporate sponsors,
charitable organizations, individuals and groups like the Navy Sailors
from Columbia.

According to a Habitat for Humanity spokesperson the average cost of
construction for a home like the ones the Sailors worked on will cost
approximately $55,000.&quot;Volunteers like these Sailors are the key to our success here at
Habitat for Humanity. We cannot move forward with the construction of
these homes without all the physical labor these Sailors [provide]. It
was an honor working with them today,&quot;said Chambers.

Habitat for Humanity and the Midlands were not the only beneficiaries of
the Sailors&apos; work.&quot;The work we did today was extremely rewarding. I believe it&apos;s important
that we show the folks in our community that we care and that we want to
continue giving something back. This is a great deed for our city and
country,&quot;said Boatswain&apos;s Mate 2nd Class Mark Cain.

Columbia Navy Week is conducted in cooperation with the Navy Office of
Community Outreach, NRD Raleigh, NIACT, University of South Carolina
NROTC and NOSC Columbia.

NNS080923-02. VP-47 Sailors Help Fix Up &apos;Mighty Mo&apos;

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class (AW) Eric J. Cutright, Fleet
Public Affairs Center Detachment Hawaii

FORD ISLAND, Hawaii (NNS) -- Sailors assigned to Patrol Squadron (VP)
47,&quot;The Golden Swordsmen&quot;, on Marine Corps Base Hawaii, Kaneohe Bay
volunteered their time to refurbish and perform repairs on the
battleship USS Missouri Memorial on Naval Station Pearl Harbor, Sept. 19.

Approximately 30 Sailors from the squadron got involved and showed they
were committed to service in their community and to preserving naval
history.&quot;We don&apos;t get a whole lot of chances to do volunteer work like this, but
when the command is out there doing it together, it feels really good,&quot;said Aviation Electrician&apos;s Mate 3rd Class Austin Amaro.

The volunteer work for the ship included running electrical wires
through the ship&apos;s bulkheads, painting guard rails on the pier and
helping out with general tasks in the Victory Store warehouse, where
Missouri memorabilia is kept.

Les Lancaster, the memorial&apos;s director of operations, said the ship
itself only keeps 16 staff members to conduct all of Missouri&apos;s
maintenance, so the Sailor&apos;s work was much appreciated.&quot;If we did not have the volunteers with the staff that we have, we would
not be able to open up other spaces for tourists to visit,&quot;said
Lancaster.&quot;We want to open as many spaces as possible, so that people
can come and see the ship as it was, and the more we do, the better it
is for our visitors.&quot;The Sailors got involved in the project after one of their own, Aviation
Electronics Technician 2nd Class (AW/NAC) Christopher Hirn, got in touch
with Lancaster and asked if the ship could use any extra help.&quot;Les said he had some projects, and I brought it up to my master chief
about seeing if we could get over here as a squadron,&quot;said Hirn.&quot;Since
we&apos;re aviators I thought it would be nice to come over and see the
&apos;black-shoe side&apos;, or the other side of the Navy.&quot;For more news from Commander, Navy Region Hawaii, visit

NNS081001-20. Chief of Naval Operations Sends Birthday Message to Fleet

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SW) Rebekah Blowers, Chief
of Naval Operations Public Affairs

WASHINGTON (NNS) -- The Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) sent a video
message to the fleet in honor of the Navy&apos;s birthday.&quot;This year our Navy celebrates our 233rd birthday. Two hundred and
thirty-three years of great service to our nation. As we observe this
day, I thank all of our Sailors and civilians for their service, and I
thank our Navy families for all of their support,&quot;Adm. Gary Roughead,
CNO, said.

Since the Navy&apos;s inception in 1775, CNO said the values that the Navy
holds were built upon by the capability and versatility of Sailors. The
Navy today is conducting the maritime strategy, operates across the full
spectrum of warfare and is known as much for its compassion as for its
capability.&quot;We return peace and stability after conflict, and in the wake of
devastating disasters, our Navy team brings food, shelter and medical
care for those in need. Sailors, civilians and our families who support
us are making the world a better place,&quot;Roughead said.

CNO emphasized his pride in the selfless commitment of the Navy team
that is continuing the legacy of those who have gone before and will
serve as an inspiration for years to come.

NNS081001-10. Navy Announces Updates to Physical Readiness Program

By Chief Mass Communication Specialist (SW) Maria Yager, Navy Personnel
Command Public Affairs

MILLINGTON, Tenn. (NNS) -- A NAVADMIN released Sept. 29 emphasized the
Navy&apos;s exceptional progress in attaining a culture of fitness and
announces several policy revisions to strengthen the Navy Physical
Readiness Program (PRP).&quot;Navy Physical Fitness Assessment (PFA) failures have decreased more
than 50 percent over the past four years. We&apos;re really seeing a change
in culture and change in lifestyle. Better fitness ultimately leads to
better quality of life, better performance and better readiness,&quot;said
Rear Adm. Daniel P. Holloway, director, Manpower, Personnel, Training
and Education, N13.

In recent years, the Navy has made significant strides in helping
Sailors achieve a culture of fitness. The addition of elliptical and
stationary bike options for the cardio portion of the PFA was welcomed
by many Sailors. A General Military Training (GMT) program on NKO in
2008 provides Sailors greater insight for physical training and
preparing for the PFA. Most recently, an official PT uniform was adopted
around the fleet.&quot;Since 2005, the Navy has made significant strides to support and
encourage physical fitness,&quot;said Holloway, citing the addition of new
testing options, which include the elliptical and stationary bike.&quot;The
majority of Navy personnel performs the PFA semi-annually and can easily
meet or exceed the minimum physical fitness standards. I challenge each
of you to continue the excellent progress we&apos;ve made to improve Navy&apos;s
overall physical fitness for the improved health and readiness of the
force.&quot;The new NAVADMIN builds on the Navy&apos;s culture of fitness and supports
the rigors of shipboard life, global missions and individual augmentees,
according to Holloway. The changes announced in NAVADMIN 277/08 include:

Effective Oct. 1, 2008, unless the most recent PFA was passed, Sailors
who have failed two PFAs in the past three years shall not be assigned
to overseas, pre-commissioning, instructor duty, special programs
billets, or Global War on Terror (GWOT) Support Assignments (GSA).
Special programs billets include recruit division commander, recruiting
duty, joint duty and Washington D.C. staff.

Additionally, individuals who have not passed the current PFA and have
failed three times in four years, will not be allowed a short term
extension for the purpose of passing the PFA.

Software upgrades to the Physical Readiness Information Management
System (PRIMS) will allow commands to enter all waivers, including
current progress and readiness waivers. Commands are required to enter
all PFA waivers into PRIMS. Current waivers must be entered no later
than Dec. 15, 2008.

This upgrade will allow the Navy to track the progress of Sailors who
need administrative separation processing due to multiple PFA failures.

Effective Oct. 1, 2009 the Navy will discontinue waivers for progress.
The present requirement for processing for administrative separations
(ADSEP) for three PFA failures within a four-year period remains.

NNS081001-21. Navy Christens Littoral Combat Ship Independence&gt;From the Department of Defense

MOBILE, Ala. (NNS) -- The Navy will christen littoral combat ship (LCS)
Independence at 10:00 a.m. on Oct. 4, during a ceremony at Austal USA
Shipyard, Mobile, Ala.

The name Independence recognizes the cornerstone of our nation&apos;s
foundation that so many Americans have sacrificed to ensure. Five
previous ships have also had that name. The first Independence was a
10-gun sloop that served during the War of Independence. The second
Independence, the first ship of the line in the Navy, was launched in
1814 as a 74-gun ship, but later refitted to a 54-gun frigate. The third
Independence served with the Naval Overseas Transportation Service
following the end of World War I. The fourth Independence (CVL 22), a
small aircraft carrier commissioned in 1943, earned eight battle stars
during World War II. The fifth Independence (CV 62) was an aircraft
carrier commissioned in 1959 and decommissioned in 1998.

U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., will deliver the principal address at
the ceremony. Doreen Scott, wife of the former Master Chief Petty
Officer of the Navy Terry Scott, will serve as ship&apos;s sponsor. The
ceremony will be highlighted by Scott breaking a bottle of champagne
across the bow to formally christen the ship, which is a time-honored
Navy tradition.

Independence is one of two LCS seaframes being produced. LCS 1, Freedom,
completed its acceptance trials and was delivered to the Navy on Sept.
18, 2008. Freedom is scheduled for commissioning on Nov. 8, 2008.

The LCS is an innovative combatant designed to operate quickly in
shallow water environments to counter challenging threats in coastal
regions, specifically mines, submarines and fast surface craft. It is
capable of speeds in excess of 40 knots and can operate in water less
than 20 feet deep.

Independence will address a critical capabilities gap in the littorals.
It will serve to enhance maritime security and it is capable of
performing the core capabilities that define the Navy. It will deter
hostility in troubled waters, maintain a forward presence, and it is
capable of projecting power and maintaining sea control.

Under the current shipbuilding plan, the Navy is programmed to purchase
55 Littoral Combat Ships. These 55 ships will improve the Navy&apos;s
capacity to respond to more globally distributed threats and will help
the Navy reach its ultimate fleet goal of at least 313 ships.

The advanced design of Independence will allow it to launch and recover
manned and unmanned vehicles. It will support interchangeable mission
packages, allowing the ship to be reconfigured for antisubmarine
warfare, mine warfare, or surface warfare missions on an as-needed basis.

The LCS will be able to swap out mission packages pierside in a matter
of a day, adapting as the tactical situation demands. These ships will
also feature advanced networking capability to share tactical
information with other Navy aircraft, ships, submarines and joint units.

Independence will be manned by one of two rotational crews, blue and
gold, similar to the rotational crews assigned to Trident submarines.
The crews will be augmented by one of three mission package crews during
focused mission assignments. The prospective commanding officer of the
Blue crew is Cmdr. Curt A. Renshaw, who was born in Louisville, Ky., and
raised in nearby New Albany, Ind. The prospective commanding officer of
the Gold crew is Cmdr. Michael B. Riley, a native of Phoenix, Ariz.

In May 2004, the Department of Defense awarded both Lockheed Martin and
General Dynamics separate contract options for final-system design with
options for detail design and construction of up to two LCS ships. The
future USS Independence (LCS 2) is the General Dynamics&apos; lead hull in
that ship design.

In October 2005, the Department of Navy awarded General Dynamics - Bath
Iron Works, a contract for detail design and construction of their first
LCS. General Dynamics - Bath Iron Works teammates include Austal USA of
Mobile, Ala. and General Dynamics  AIS of Pittsfield, Mass. A keel
laying ceremony was held Jan. 19, 2006, at Austal USA Shipyard in
Mobile, Ala., where the ships is being built.

NNS081001-17.&quot;Las Primera&quot;Latina to Command a Navy Ship Honored at Gala

By Lt. Cmdr. Elizabeth Zimmermann, Navy Diversity Directorate

WASHINGTON (NNS) -- The commanding officer of USS Curts (FFG 38) will be
honored Oct. 2 at MANA&apos;s 19th Annual Las Primeras Awards Gala for being
the first (la primera) Hispanic female to command a ship in the U.S. Navy.

Cmdr. Yvette Gonzalez Davids won the military category award for 2008,
joining five other Latinas who are being recognized for achieving&quot;firsts&quot;in their respective fields, and making significant
contributions to the nation.&quot;It is a pleasure to once again honor amazing Latinas who inspire and
demonstrate the ability and strength of the Hispanic community,&quot;said
MANA President and CEO, Alma Morales Riojas.&quot;Las Primeras show that
dreams can become reality and that adult and young Latinas do have role
models who look and sound like them.&quot;Riojas was especially pleased to have a Latina servicewoman in the list
of honorees.&quot;The history of Latinas in service to our country dates back to the
Civil War. Even so there is little written about these courageous women
who are willing to put their life on the line for America,&quot;she said.&quot;This is why having a Primera category for the military is so important
and why we are so proud to honor Commander Davids achievements.
Commander Davids has demonstrated that with the right education and
training everything is possible.&quot;Davids agreed with the need for role models, recounting hers as
invaluable in shaping her life, especially her parents.&quot;It&apos;s important for our own personal and professional growth to be able
to look around and find models of excellence. The greatest mentors of my
life have been my parents, who challenged me to rise above
mediocrityand with the expectation that all things are possible,&quot;said
Davids.&quot;In the Navy, I&apos;ve been blessed to work with incredible leaders who have
inspired me by their action, integrity and character. Each has left me
with the understanding that with privilege comes responsibility, so I am
proud to be receiving this MANA recognition  in the full awareness of
my responsibility to mentor those that follow.&quot;Being a Latina has also influenced her perspectives.&quot;It shaped my development and has influenced my perspective and my core
beliefs,&quot;Davids said. She said time and experience has helped her to
appreciate not only her own background, but also to value the Nation&apos;s
diversity, saying she was thankful to be&quot;from a country that is
accepting of all backgrounds.&quot;Davids encourages other young women and men to consider the Navy as a
place to reach for their dreams.&quot;The United States Navy provided mea purposeful existence where
integrity, mutual respect and professionalism thrive. Where
opportunities abound and where the very appreciation for the diversity
in its Sailors allowed me and so many others like me to excel.&quot;Working with MANA and participating in the Las Primeras Awards Gala is
one way in which the Navy is working to spread the idea of reaching for
dreams  through education.

MANA promotes educational leadership programs for Latinas and mentors
young Latinas ages 11-18. These goals are in line with the Navy
Diversity Directorate&apos;s K-10 Outreach Programs that seek to encourage
youth to pursue science, technology, engineering and math (STEM)
education, while raising Navy awareness.

MANA, a national latina organization, is a nonprofit, advocacy
organization headquartered in Washington. With chapters across the
country, it is the oldest national Latina membership organization in the
United States. MANA, whose mission is to empower Latinas through
leadership development, community service, and advocacy, envisions a
national community of informed Latina activists working to improve the
quality of life for all Hispanics.

The other women receiving awards at the 2008 Gala include Martha
Tijerina, host of En San Antonio; Juliet V. Garcia, Ph.D., president,
University of Texas at Brownville; Gloria Molina, Los Angeles County
Board of Supervisors; Irma Garcia, Director of Athletics, St. Francis
College, NCAA Division I; and Sonya E. Medina, Deputy Assistant to the
President for Domestic Policy and Director of Special Projects for the
First Lady, The White House.

NNS081001-13. U.S Navy Ships Arrive in Scotland for Joint Warrior

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Joseph R. Wax, Commander
Destroyer Squadron 24 Public Affairs

FASLANE, Scotland (NNS) -- A group of U.S. Navy ships led by Commander,
Destroyer Squadron (COMDESRON) 24 arrived in Faslane, Scotland Oct. 1 to
participate in the Joint Warrior Course, a multinational exercise held
in the waters off the Scottish coast.

USS Mitscher (DDG 57), USS Hawes (FFG 53), USS Doyle (FFG 39), USS
Klakring (FFG 42), and USNS Leroy Grumman(T-AO 195) will take part in
the coalition course, which is run by the Joint Tactical Exercise
Planning Staff (JTEPS) in the United Kingdom.&quot;The purpose of the exercise is to improve interoperability with our
allies,&quot;said Lt. Cmdr. Michael Violette, COMDESRON 24 operations officer.&quot;During this scenario-driven event, we will bring all the capabilities
of the coalition together to accomplish the mission.&quot;Capt. John Kersh, commander, COMDESRON 24, and his staff will embark
aboard HMS Ark Royal for the exercise to fully integrate into a joint
maritime operating environment.&quot;Together, we are advancing the art and state of training in the
maritime domain,&quot;said Kersh.&quot;We are teaming with our allied partners
to execute the Navy&apos;s Maritime Strategy.&quot;According to Violette, one of the main benefits of Joint Warrior is that
it provides U.S. ships a unique opportunity to operate under NATO rules
of engagement (ROE) while conducting realistic training. Joint Warrior
also serves as a certifying event for ships preparing to operate with
coalition partners during future deployments.&quot;Our ships are also getting their independent deployer certification out
of this event,&quot;said Violette.&quot;This will allow our ships to be
versatile coalition assets.&quot;The two-week Joint Warrior exercise is scheduled to begin Oct. 6 off the
coast of Scotland, where the participating navies will practice joint
maritime operations in a controlled environment.

NNS081001-16. Naval Education and Training Command Receives Ethics Award

By Ed Barker, Naval Education and Training Command Public Affairs

PENSACOLA, Fla. (NNS) -- The U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE)
announced NETC as a 2008 Ethics Awards Program recipient Sept. 18. The
award recognizes outstanding achievement in managing the command&apos;s
ethics program.&quot;Award recipients were selected based on a variety of achievements
including effectively administering each element of the overall ethics
program,&quot;said Robert Cusick, director of OGE.&quot;We also looked at how each agency implemented model practices that
advanced the program beyond mere compliance with the ethics laws and
regulations  we were looking for those who went the extra mile for an
outstanding program.&quot;Cusick noted some of the model practices exhibited at NETC included
exhibiting leadership involvement in the ethics program, conducting
self-assessments and developing comprehensive written procedures to
ensure consistent program administration and fostering effective
succession planning.&quot;The ethics program award reflects the importance OGE places on
commitment and diligence in implementing the ethics program,&quot;added
Cusick. Out of the entire U.S. government, only a handful of agencies
are recognized each year. Winning this award is a significant
accomplishment.&quot;Dale Christopher, associate director for Program Reviews at OGE,
commented that during their visit, top-down interest in the program was
readily apparent.&quot;During OGE&apos;s review, Rear Adm. Jones, the NETC commander, made time to
meet with the OGE review team to discuss the scope of the review,&quot;said
Christopher.&quot;He underscored the importance of agency leadership in
implementing an effective ethics program, and that was a key factor.&quot;&quot;NETC&apos;s ethics program provides in-person verbal initial ethics
orientation to all new employees, provides guidance on post-government
restrictions to all personnel that are retiring or leaving government
service, and provides annual training to many other employees, not just
those employees covered under the ethics training regulation,&quot;commented
Carol Lynch, NETC assistant counsel.&quot;Our program ranges from counseling the commander, managing and
reviewing financial disclosure forms to routinely providing in-person
training to NETC staff and subordinate command personnel to enhance
their knowledge of the Federal ethics laws and regulations. It&apos;s
gratifying to see the close and hard work of the NETC Judge Advocate
General, Office of General Counsel and Inspector General receive
recognition for a superior ethics program.&quot;For more news from Naval Education and Training Command, visit

NNS081001-07. NAVFAC Attends HESTEC Expo in South Texas

Special Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast Public Affairs

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (NNS) -- Naval Facilities Engineering Command
(NAVFAC) attended the Hispanic Engineering, Science and Technology
(HESTEC) Career Fair and Community Day at the University of Texas - Pan
American campus Sept. 26 and 27 in Edinburg, Texas, to educate and
mentor engineering students on potential career opportunities.

Members of the NAVFAC Southeast recruitment team attended two days of

NNS081001-14. USS Mitscher Sailors Think &apos;Green&apos;

By Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Patrick Grieco, Commander
Destroyer Squadron 24 Public Affairs

USS MITSCHER, At Sea (NNS) -- The guided-missile destroyer USS Mitscher
(DDG 57) is thinking &apos;green&apos; this October as the ship makes its transit
across the Atlantic Ocean to participate in the multinational exercise
Joint Warrior.

Sailors aboard Mitscher are exploring ways to conserve resources and
contribute to a cleaner planet.&quot;One of the biggest pursuits in the Navy is the use of electric drive
systems,&quot;said Lt. Robert Laird, Mitscher&apos;s chief engineer.&quot;Right now
on Mitscher we have gas turbine propulsion and gas turbine generators.&quot;Laird said it can be difficult to balance the load between generating
ship power and generating propulsion. But Laird said ships could
potentially conserve energy by utilizing new technology to work
alongside gas turbine engines.&quot;The electric drive would allow us to use smaller gas turbines than we
have now,&quot;said Laird.&quot;This would help save energy and resources.&quot;Energy and resource management aren&apos;t the only environmental initiatives
in today&apos;s greener Navy. Mitscher Sailors are pursing innovative ways to
recycle resources that reach the end of their useful life cycle.

Mitscher&apos;s Supply Officer, Lt. Dan Vetsch, said the ship&apos;s engineering
department received new filters recently and decided to recycle the old
aluminum filter casings.&quot;Instead of just disposing them, we chose to take the casings to the
aluminum recycling plant,&quot;said Vetsch.&quot;With the money we received from
recycling the casings, we raised nearly 3,000 dollars for MWR (morale,
welfare, and recreation) that went back to benefit the crew.&quot;Laird said involvement by deckplate Sailors is key to success with
environmental stewardship.&quot;I would ask Sailors to speak up if they see something that can be done
more efficiently,&quot;said Laird.&quot;They are the ones who directly work with
the ship&apos;s equipment every day and they&apos;re the ones who will shape the
greener Navy of tomorrow.&quot;Vetsch said he also believes Sailors play a significant role in
conserving resources and protecting the environment.&quot;Just as Sailors must be vigilant in the global war on terrorism, they
should also be sure to protect this green planet that humanity calls
home,&quot;said Vetsch.

Led by Destroyer Squadron 24, Mitscher, USS Hawes (FFG 53), USS Doyle
(FFG 39), USS Klakring (FFG 42), and USNS Leroy Grumman (T-AO 195) are
underway in the Atlantic Ocean in preparation for exercise Joint Warrior.

NNS081001-12. DSU Tests New Submarine Rescue System with Chilean Submarine

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SW) Alexia M. Riveracorrea,
Fleet Public Affairs Center, Pacific

SAN DIEGO (NNS) -- The Navy&apos;s Deep Submergence Unit tested a new system
known as the submarine rescue diving and recompression system (SRDRS)
with the Chilean submarine CS Simpson (SS-21) Sept. 17-18.

The SRDS is designed to be rapidly deployed to any location in the world
via air or ground and can be installed on military or commercial vessels
when a call for assistance is received. It will replace the deactivated
deep submergence rescue vehicle (DSRV) system as the Navy&apos;s premier
submarine rescue capability.&quot;The SRDRS is the U.S. Navy&apos;s 21st century submarine rescue system and
represents state-of-the-art technology for submarine rescue systems,&quot;said Lt. Rich Ray, the former engineering officer of the rescue
submarine Mystic (DSRV 1).

According to Ray, the SRDRS is designed to be mobilized, installed on a
transport vehicle, transported to a site and mated to a distressed
submarine to begin rescues within a maximum of 72 hours.

During the exercise, and with operators inside, the pressurized rescue
module (PRM) was remotely controlled via a topside control console
aboard fleet ocean tug USNS Navajo (T-ATF 169), which carried the SRDRS
for this evolution.&quot;It was an awesome experience to work with the Chilean Navy,&quot;said DSU
Machinist&apos;s Mate 2nd Class (SS) Chris Huffstetler.&quot;I believe it is
beneficial to work with foreign navies in case something really
happenswe can provide immediate support.&quot;The SRDRS concept of operations has been developed to support rescue of
up to 155 personnel from a pressurized disabled submarine. The PRM
accommodates 16 rescued personnel per trip and requires two operators
and a diving medical technician.&quot;The operation was a phenomenal success thanks to the cooperation of the
entire crew,&quot;said Cmdr. Larry R. Lintz, deputy commander for submarine
escape at Commander, Submarine Development Squadron 5.&quot;Now we can
officially say, the SRDRS is the Navy&apos;s official submarine rescue system.&quot;For more news from the U.S. Navy&apos;s submarine force, visit,

NNS081001-19. NAVAIR Completes Swiss Aircraft Buy&gt;From Naval Air Systems Command Public Affairs

PATUXENT RIVER, Md. (NNS) -- Naval Air Systems Command&apos;s (NAVAIR)
Support and Commercial Derivative Aircraft Support Office Adversary Team
recently completed a six year program to buy and refurbish 44 retired
Swiss Air Force F-5 Freedom Fighters. These F-5N aircraft enable the
Navy to fly in a dedicated adversary role until at least Fiscal Year 2015.&quot;The success of the F-5E Replacement Program could not have happened
without our international and industry partners, the Swiss government
and Northrop Grumman. This reverse Foreign Military Sales program began
in 2000 when the Navy needed a replacement for its fleet of F-5E Tiger
II adversary aircraft,&quot;said Capt. James Wallace, Support and Commercial
Derivative Aircraft program manager (PMA207).&quot;The Swiss are long-time operators of the F-5 and had surplus aircraft
available. An agreement between the U.S. and Swiss governments was
signed and the Swiss initially supplied 32 former Swiss Air Force
single-seat F-5Es to us under the F-5E Replacement Program, a program
valued at $50 million.&quot;The Swiss aircraft were manufactured with Improved Handling Quality
systems. Their physical differences include a sharper nose, different
wing leading edge roots and automatic flaps, giving an increased
capability compared to the U.S. F-5Es.&quot;The Swiss aircraft had very few flight hours and were in great shape,&quot;said Lt. Cmdr. Jason Goff, the Adversary and Commercial Air Services
Deputy program manager.&quot;One F-5 was delivered to Northrop Grumman&apos;s
plant in St. Augustine, Fla., every month to start the refurbishment
process.&quot;We basically take one of our old F-5E&apos;s and a Swiss plane and at the end
of the refurbishment; we have a new plane  the F-5N. The refurbishment
process takes up to five months to complete. It just made sense to
refurbish the aircraft at Northrop Grumman&apos;s plant since they designed
and built the jets in the first place. They already do all our depot
work and they own all the drawings.&quot;&quot;In 2004, the Navy wanted to establish an Adversary training base in Key
West, Fla. The Navy Reserve came up with the funding to buy 12 extra
jets,&quot;said Jay Bolles, the Integrated Program Team lead for Adversary
Aircraft in PMA-207.&quot;We bought the extra aircraft from the Swiss, now
totaling 44 aircraft, and put them through the refurbishment line with
the Reserve funding and we were still able to stay within the original
schedule.&quot;Each Swiss F-5E is airlifted from RUAG&apos;s plant at Emmen, Switzerland, to
St. Augustine, Fla., in a U.S. Navy C-130T. The Swiss F-5&apos;s are
disassembled and stowed in a purpose-built frame designed and
manufactured by Northrop Grumman. One of two frames was permanently at
Emmen, and the other was always in transit.

By Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Charles Oki, Fleet Public
Affairs Center Det., Japan

YOKOSUKA, Japan (NNS) -- Members of the Yokosuka Navy community
participated in the fourth annual Relay for Life on the track at Ikego
Naval Housing Facility Sept. 27.

The annual event helps raise money and awareness for cancer research,
with all proceeds going to the American Cancer Society, a nonprofit
organization.

A total of eight teams ran or walked in the fight against cancer.
Participants included active duty, family members and several cancer
survivors. A group from Afloat Training Group Western Pacific teamed up
with instructors from Center for Naval Engineering for the event.&quot;It&apos;s a great event and it&apos;s a great cause,&quot;Chief Damage Controlman
(SW) Matt Plato from Yokosuka&apos;s Center for Naval Engineering.&quot;We&apos;re
doing it on behalf of a former instructor that was part of CNE, who
passed away July 7 of cancer.&quot;According to Holly Varner, the coordinator of this year&apos;s relay, the
event lasts 12 hours with families and teams keeping at least one person
on the track at all times throughout the night.&quot;The relay for life is a fundraiser that is done over the whole world to
raise money for the American Cancer Society in the interest of research
and development for a cure and awareness for everybody,&quot;said Varner.&quot;I love the way tonight is going of course we always want more people to
come out to make it more fun and to get more involved but it looks as if
everyone is enjoying themselves and they&apos;re all here for the right
reasons.&quot;The American Cancer Society Relay for Life began as the City of Destiny
Classic 24-hour Run against Cancer, and was started by Dr. Gordy Klatt
in Tacoma, Wash., when he ran more than 83 miles in 24 hours and raised
$27,000. The relay has since become a worldwide event that has raised
millions of dollars.&quot;It&apos;s a great cause, were doing it for a cure, were doing it for the
people who have passed and the people who are fighting and I hope it
gets bigger every year,&quot;said Plato.

NNS081001-01. Racers Drift to Coronado Speed Fest as Part of Navy Week

By Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Jose Lopez Jr. Fleet Public
Affairs Center Pacific

SAN DIEGO (NNS) -- The U.S. Navy kicked off the 11th annual Coronado
Speed Festival as part of fleet week festivities in San Diego Sept. 26.&quot;It gives us a chance to bring the public out to see the hardware we
possess,&quot;said Lt. Duane Close, a pilot with Strike Fighter Squadron
(VFA) 154,&quot;Black Knights,&quot;who spoke to guests about his F-18 Hornet at
the military vehicle display.&quot;Not only do they get to watch racing, but
they get to see we have families and are like everyone else.&quot;Drivers with vintage race cars hit the 1.7-mile course set up on the
base&apos;s flight line. The event featured open-wheel midget cars with loud
engines, vintage cars with a long history of racing, and this year&apos;s new
additions: rear-wheel drive drifting racers and vintage stock cars.&quot;It&apos;s a lot of fun out there on this track; we get plenty of room to
play around,&quot;said Tom Brecht, a veteran on the flight line and driver
of No. 35, a 1968 BMW 2002 that at one time was a Trans-Am race car for
Hyde Park Motors BMW.&quot;The races here at Coronado are all memorable.
It&apos;s a tight fun track, one of the reasons why we love to come back.&quot;Various car clubs also displayed vehicles including exotic vehicles like
the Lotus Elise and vintage cars like a lime-green 1967 Ford Mustang
Fastback.&quot;There are a lot of vehicles on display,&quot;said Aviation Structural
Mechanic 2nd Class (AW/SW) James Durham of Fleet Logistics Support 30,
who missed last year&apos;s event due to deployment.&quot;It&apos;s a big car show,
and it gives me the chance to experience some of the vintage cars. It&apos;s
very exciting.&quot;Aside from the static displays, visitors also had the opportunity to see
a pair of F-16 Fighting Falcon&quot;adversary&quot;planes from Naval Strike Air
Warfare Center Naval Air Station Fallon performed a fly-over. The
amphibious assault ship USS Tarawa (LHA-1) also offered a tour of the
ship to the thousands in attendance.&quot;When we open the doors like this, we get the opportunity to not only
meet other active duty personnel,&quot;said Lt. j.g. Ben Showman of VFA 154,&quot;we get the opportunity to interact with retired people as well. They
get to see planes they normally don&apos;t have access to, and we get to
interact with fans of naval aviation.&quot;Fleet weeks honor the men and women of the Navy, Coast Guard and Marine
Corps and gives the public a chance to get to know more about service
personnel, equipment and programs.

NNS081001-06. NCIS Crime Reduction Program Kicks Off in October

By Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class (SW/AW) Kristen Allen, Naval
Criminal Investigative Service Public Affairs

WASHINGTON (NNS) -- The Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) is
kicking off its new Crime Reduction Program (CRP) Oct. 1.

The program will provide education and awareness on a variety of crimes
throughout the year as identified by current trends, crime report
statistics, and the needs of the Department of the Navy (DoN).

The first program theme that will be highlighted from October through
December is:&quot;Break the Silence, Break the Cycle: End Domestic Abuse.&quot;Supervisory Special Agent Diane Nelson of the NCIS Criminal
Investigations Directorate said this campaign is vital for military
service members, their families, and the communities in which they live.&quot;Domestic violence impacts Sailors, Marines, those with whom they work,
operational readiness, and military morale and welfare,&quot;said Diane.&quot;Operational stress can lead to domestic violence. Education is
paramount in helping our Sailors and Marines identify their stressors
and ways to cope with them before they escalate into criminal behavior.&quot;The CRP is a new initiative in which NCIS will work in conjunction with
the Judge Advocate General (JAG), public affairs, Family Advocacy
Program (FAP), Chaplain Corps, and other Navy commands to proactively
fight crime within the military community.

NCIS, as the lead law enforcement organization for the DON, will
spearhead the partnership from headquarters with assistance from the
Fleet and Family Support Center (FFSC), Navy Family Ombudsman Program,
and other Navy and Marine Corps entities.

NCIS Headquarters will direct the campaign and provide information and
marketing materials to each NCIS Field Office. Local NCIS and FFSC
representatives will then work together to ensure that the crime
reduction message and training get out to their respective installations.

Along with education to prevent domestic violence, Diane said this
campaign is also about helping victims or potential victims understand
what resources are available to them and that they are not alone.

Special Agent Carrie Nelson, CRP coordinator, said it&apos;s important for
all service members and their families to realize that domestic
violence, public or private, is everyone&apos;s problem.&quot;It&apos;s not just something you read about or see in the movies, it happens
in your community and maybe even your own home,&quot;added Carrie.&quot;If you
have seen, heard about or felt the effects of domestic violence, it is
your responsibility as a member of the military community to take
action. By keeping quiet, you are telling the abuser that their vicious
behavior is ok.&quot;Carrie pointed out that anyone can be a victim or an abuser, regardless
of age, sex, race, culture, religion, education, employment or marital
status.&quot;The only common thread is the relationship between the abuser and the
abused, where the abuser uses a set of behaviors to control another
person,&quot;said Carrie.&quot;Whether the abuse is a one-time attack or
prolonged aggression, domestic violence can have lasting effects, and it
can transform the home from a place of safety and love to one of danger
and fear.&quot;She also said it&apos;s important for everyone to realize that domestic abuse
is not only physical.&quot;It&apos;s not just black eyes and broken bones,&quot;said Carrie.&quot;It can also
be verbal abuse, attempts to belittle and shatter your self-esteem. It
can be threats and intimidation. It can be zero control over your
finances, making you completely dependent upon your abuser.&quot;The program also encourages victims and witnesses to report abuse.&quot;Don&apos;t tell yourself it can&apos;t get any worse,&quot;said Carrie.&quot;Department
of Defense statistics report that 33 percent of female homicide victims
are killed by an intimate partner. While you may be afraid to report
domestic violence because of career problems or the possibility of the
abuse getting worse, the Department of the Navy has resources to help you.&quot;Carrie said that the earlier domestic violence is reported, the higher
the chances of successful treatment and the continuation of a normal
military career.

Some of the resources available to victims, abusers and witnesses
include the Family Advocacy Program at your local FFSC, the FFSC Web
site www.nffsp.org, and the National Domestic Violence Hotline
1-800-799-SAFE (7233).

Carrie stressed that domestic violence is not just wrong, it&apos;s also a
crime. Sometimes if a service member is convicted of a domestic violence
assault, even a misdemeanor, they can no longer deploy, which impacts
unit morale and readiness. She said domestic violence can be prevented

employ&quot;said Anne Davis, CNIC Executive Director.&quot;CNIC, working closely
with the Naval Safety Center and the Marine Corps, sensed this need and
responded quickly to make this happen.&quot;Under the contract&apos;s&quot;statement of objectives,&quot;Cape Fox is tasked to
provide a readily accessible source of robust training programs to
include, but not limited to, basic and advanced instruction in
motorcycle safety, off-road vehicle safety, and water-craft safety at

NNS081001-04. Seabee Construction Teams in Iraq Transfer Authority

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Kenneth W. Robinson, Naval
Mobile Construction Battalion 27 Public Affairs

AL ASAD, Iraq (NNS) -- Naval Mobile Construction Battalion (NMCB) 27,
homeported in Brunswick, Maine, received command authority for Seabee
construction activities in Western Iraq from NMCB 17, homeported at Fort
Carson, Colo., during a transfer of authority ceremony Sept. 20.

The official party included Capt. James Schroeder, commander 1st Naval
Construction Regiment; Capt. Susanne Openshaw, commanding officer NMCB
17; and Cmdr. James Robbins, commanding officer NMCB 27.

Schroeder began the ceremony by commending NMCB 17 on its performance in
al-Anbar province and charged NMCB 27 to continue the high level of
professional services that NMCB 17 had provided in support of
Multi-National Forces West.&quot;I have watched NMCB 17 as they rolled through their mobilization, and I
have marveled at the great accomplishments that they have achieved while
they have been deployed,&quot;said Schroeder.&quot;All throughout the theater,
NMCB 17 has done a great job of supporting the transition of
Multi-National Forces the Marines and Sailors throughout the area of
operation. They have done a great job and have a lot to be proud of.&quot;Openshaw delivered the turn-over remarks on behalf of NMCB 17.&quot;It&apos;s obvious to me the pride that you, [NMCB 17] have of what you have
accomplished,&quot;said Openshaw.

She went on to mention the numerous projects NMCB 17 completed to
include: The Baghdadi Bridge, Haditha boat ramp, culvert capping and
water-well drilling projects.&quot;These are the projects most mentioned, but by no means were these all
of them. We completed nearly 100 projects just in al-Anbar province,&quot;Openshaw said.

Command Master Chief Robert Griseto retired the NMCB 17 colors.

Robbins waited for his Command Master Chief, Richard Heiland, to hoist
the NMCB 27 colors before addressing both battalions.&quot;NMCB 17 has left their mark in Iraq and Afghanistan, and now challenges
NMCB 27 to pick up the tools and weapons and continue the Seabee
traditions in country,&quot;said Robbins.&quot;To the men and women of NMCB 27,
now is your time. You are the men and women that will write the next
chapter in the Seabee legend. I am lucky and honored to have an
opportunity to lead such a great battalion, and I have every confidence
that we will be successful with our mission.&quot;After addressing the battalions, Robbins reported to Schroeder,&quot;Commodore, NMCB 27 is standing by for tasking Ooh Rah 27!&quot;For more news from Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 27, visit

NNS081001-03. Navy Band Northwest Visits Salem, Shares Music Expertise

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Chantel M. Clayton, Fleet
Public Affairs Center, Det. Northwest

SALEM, Ore. (NNS) -- Musicians from Navy Band Northwest visited local
high school and college music students in Salem Sept. 22-24.

During their two-day visit, musicians shared their musical expertise and
Navy experiences with students from McNary High School, West Salem High
School and Corban College&quot;The purpose of Navy Band Northwest coming to Salem was to further an
outreach that we have begun in the Northwest region,&quot;said Lt.j.g.
Patrick Sweeten, director, Navy Band Northwest.&quot;We want to get more involved with Navy recruiting and music education.
There is a program called &apos;Musicians for Recruiting,&apos; and we are here to
support those initiatives as well as to help further the message that
the Navy is here; we are in force, and we are hiring.&quot;Musicians had the opportunity to teach music clinics or master classes.&quot;I guest-conducted McNary High School&apos;s top two bands, a wind ensemble
and concert band, while a dozen of my guys sat in their various sections
with the students,&quot;said Sweeten.&quot;We helped to further their education,
motivate them and communicate a little musicianship from a
professional&apos;s point of view.&quot;Brian Griffiths, director of bands and adjunct faculty member at Corban
College, was excited to have Navy Band Northwest on campus.&quot;We are really pleased that these musicians have been really helpful and
enthusiastic about coming alongside our students at both the college
level and local high schools, providing master classes and sitting in,
talking with them about a bigger picture of what musical life can be
like whether it is in the Navy or not,&quot;said Griffiths.&quot;This band is
evidently full of very knowledgeable musicians and really good people
with great people skills. It&apos;s really been a delight to have them around.&quot;Griffiths hopes the band can continue to provide music education to
Salem music students in the future.&quot;We are really pleased that they came here,&quot;said Griffiths.&quot;We hope
that this is going to be an ongoing tradition that allows us to partner
with Navy Band Northwest both here at Corban College and the local high
schools to make this a reoccurring event which includes more people,
more high schools, more students and is able to create a bigger musical
and educational impact on the community.&quot;For more news from Commander, Navy Region Northwest, visit

NNS081001-02. Columbia Navy Week Ends On A High Note At Okra Strut

By Lt. Chris G. Neeley, Navy Office of Community Outreach Public Affairs

COLUMBIA, SC (NNS) -- The first ever Columbia Navy Week ended on a high
note with the Four Star Edition Band headlining the Okra Strut&apos;s finale
act before 24,000 people.&quot;It was great to play before such an exciting crowd. All week long we
have enjoyed spending time with folks across the Midlands area and
playing at the different high schools that participated in Columbia Navy
Week. What a great week for this communitywhat a great week for the
Navy,&quot;said Musician 1st Class Robert Marquis.

Columbia Navy Week was officially kicked off at the half-time of the
University of South Carolina football game against Wofford College when
60 Sailors from across the Midlands marched in a special military
appreciation ceremony before a stadium crowd of more than 76,000 and a
national pay-per-view audience.

Local area Sailors also participated in a variety of outreach efforts
including a special church service at Columbia First Baptist Church,&quot;Caps for Kids&quot;at Palmetto Health Children&apos;s Hospital, Salvation Army
Soup Kitchen, Habitat for Humanity, proclamation ceremonies with
Governor Mark Sanford and Columbia Mayor Bob Coble, a resolution with
the Lexington County Council, seven high school and three historically
black colleges events, the 10K Dam Run and culminating in the Irmo Okra
Strut parade and festival.

The Navy&apos;s ambassador for the week, Rear Adm. Bill Goodwin, Commander,
Naval Air Force Atlantic, joined Sailors from across the Midlands in
many of the community outreach events as part of Columbia Navy Week.&quot;It was an honor for me to come back to Columbia to participate in Navy
Week. This city has a long and proud history of supporting the military
and our Navy,&quot;said Goodwin.&quot;I believe every Sailor who participated in
Columbia Navy Week now has a personal story of someone they met that
spoke kind words of support or showed an act of kindness to our men and
women in uniform. That to me is the sign that our outreach efforts
worked and were effective.&quot;This Navy Week is one of 22 Navy weeks planned across America in 2008.
Navy weeks are designed to show Americans the investment they have made
in their Navy and increase awareness in cities that do not have a
significant Navy presence.

NNS080924-16. Sailors Paying Bills Even in Lean Times

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (AW) LaTunya Howard, Navy
Personnel Command Public Affairs

MILLINGTON, Tenn. (NNS) -- Navy Personnel Command released the results
of the 2008 Navy Financial Health Quick Poll, Sept. 24.

The poll was directed by the Secretary of the Navy and administered by
Navy Personnel Research, Studies and Technology online, May 13-27. Data
was compiled from 3,761 Navy personnel who responded.

The objective of the Quick Poll was to measure the level of financial
stress recent economic changes e.g., increased gas prices, insurance
rates and higher housing cost are having on Sailors Navywide. The areas
of focus included overall financial comfort, living expenses, and how
Permanent Change of Station moves impact Sailors financially.

Eleven percent of enlisted personnel describe their financial condition
as&quot;keeping my head above water&quot;or&quot;in over my head.&quot;This is slightly
lower than the 15 percent responding in 2006 Quality of Life Survey. The
top financial problems for Sailors this past year related to housing
costs, increased utilities expenses, insurance costs, property taxes,
mortgage or rent.

Of those polled, 22 percent of enlisted and 43 percent of officers are
home owners, most of whom have fixed-rate loans. A small percentage of
Sailors have adjustable or interest-only loans.

The Quick Poll also inquired about a Sailor&apos;s ability to save.
Sixty-four percent of enlisted and 82 percent of officers who
participated in the poll report contributing to some type of savings
account. Fifty-seven percent of enlisted personnel and 58 percent of
officers polled contribute to the Thrift Savings Program.

Most Sailors agreed that they are able to pay the bills and meet their
financial obligations.

Financial health is important in the Navy because poor finances can
impact readiness.

Financial problems can contribute to loss of security clearance, loss of
job assignment, inability to pass overseas screening or other special
duty screenings, increase in alcohol consumption, increase in domestic
violence, increase in stress causing negative affects on health and
could result in an unaccompanied tour.

The top four solutions Sailors recommended to combat financial stress
were; subsidize transportation cost, stabilize work schedule for second
job, offer spouse employment opportunities and make childcare readily
available and more affordable.

Sailors experiencing financial stress should consult their chain of
command or contact the Fleet and Family Service Center.

Navy Personnel Command&apos;s Web site offers tips promoting financial fitness.

The Navy regularly surveys Sailors and their families. Some of the
initiatives the Navy and DoD have taken that were influenced by the
results of past surveys:

* Largest pay increase in the past 10 years
* Raising the housing allowance to 100 percent coverage
* Design changes in shipboard berthing compartments
* Increased funding for needed parts and supplies
* Expanded career sea pay to include junior officers and junior enlisted
* Changes in detailing to focus on Sailors&apos; career needs and desires
* Determining the correct level of SRBs and continuation pay in various
communities/ratings, and
* Increased information on career development in the Navy provided to
Sailors, career counselors, supervisors, and families

NNS080924-15. CNO, USCG Commandant Address Global Maritime Senior
Enlisted Symposium

By Senior Chief Mass Communication Specialist (SW/AW) Bill Houlihan,
Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy Public Affairs

HONOLULU (NNS) -- The second day of the Global Maritime Senior Enlisted
Symposium, Sept. 23, featured remarks from Chief of Naval Operations
Adm. Gary Roughead and Commandant of the United States Coast Guard Adm.
Thad Allen.

The symposium, hosted by Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy
(MCPON)(SW/FMF) Joe R. Campa Jr. and Master Chief Petty Officer of the
Coast Guard (MCPOCG) Charles&quot;Skip&quot;Bowen, brought senior enlisted
leaders from more than 40 nations to Honolulu for three days of
interaction and discussion.

In separate, prerecorded messages to the attendees, the CNO and
Commandant both stressed the critical role chief petty officers and
senior enlisted leaders play in developing enlisted Sailors and junior
officers.

Roughead discussed the International Seapower Symposium held last
October in Newport, R.I. and said the Senior Enlisted Symposium will
have the same kind of long-term effect.&quot;That was the largest collection of maritime leaders in the history of
the world. Your efforts and discussions here will add greatly to that,&quot;said Roughead.&quot;I believe it&apos;s your perspective, your views, and
understanding of your Sailors that will allow us to build better
relationships and seize the opportunities ahead of us.&quot;Roughead, Gen. James T. Conway, Commandant of the Marine Corps; and
Allen unveiled&quot;A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower&quot;in
Newport last year. During his remarks to the senior enlisted leaders in
Honolulu, Roughead referenced that document.&quot;As we issued our strategy we added capabilities that will be
increasingly important in the future. One is maritime security. How do
we come together with maritime forces of other countries to develop
protocols that will allow all of us to have a greater understanding of
what is moving on above and below the oceans.&quot;Allen&apos;s remarks were similar as he stressed that the success of the
Cooperative Strategy will hinge greatly on the efforts made by enlisted
leadership on the deckplate.&quot;We developed a maritime strategy that focuses on working together and
with our global partners. Senior enlisted people play a huge role in
that. In the Coast Guard our senior enlisted are invested with
extraordinary responsibilities and it takes a strong core of chief to
create a base from which officers can gain support.&quot;The Global Maritime Senior Enlisted Symposium was first held last year
in November in Auckland, New Zealand. This year&apos;s event concluded
Wednesday with small group seminars and lectures regarding junior
enlisted development and senior enlisted professional education.

NNS080924-02. USS Nassau Concludes Hurricane Ike Disaster Response Efforts&gt;From U.S. Fleet Forces Command

GALVESTON, Texas (NNS) -- USS Nassau (LHA 4) weighed anchor Sept. 23 to
return to her homeport in Norfolk, Va., after a week of supporting
local, state and federal civil authorities in Galveston&apos;s recovery
effort in the wake of Hurricane Ike.

Nassau&apos;s Sailors and Marines accomplished a variety of disaster relief
tasks set out by local officials. They distributed 16,440 meals
ready-to-eat; 13,835 cases of water; 25,285 bags of ice; took part in
emergency debris removal, clearing 1,075 cubic yards of debris;
delivered medical aid for 12 minor medical cases; and assisted in
bringing critical infrastructure, such as the Port of Galveston and
Scholes International Airport, back on line.&quot;Our Sailors and Marines were able to come to the aid of their fellow
Americans,&quot;said Capt. Bob Lineberry, commander, Amphibious Squadron 6.&quot;Disaster relief and humanitarian assistance is a capability that we
take around the world, and it was just as important to help our own
citizens. We will sail away from here proud of our accomplishments.&quot;Amphibious assault ships like Nassau have unique capabilities and can
provide a variety of assets that can support recovery efforts following
natural disasters. Nassau brought two MH-60S Knighthawk search and
rescue helicopters from the&quot;Dragon Whales&quot;of Helicopter Combat Support
Squadron 28, Detachment 4; Tactical Air Control Squadron 21; four
landing craft utilities from Assault Craft Unit 2; Beachmaster Unit 2;
Amphibious Construction Battalion 2 (Seabees); and Fleet Surgical Team 2
to Galveston.

The ship also deployed Galveston Assistance Team  Overhaul Recovery
(GATOR) which is a team of more than 300 Sailors from the ship who
volunteered to provide additional manpower ashore.

U.S. Fleet Forces directed Nassau Sept. 17 to proceed to Galveston
following Hurricane Ike&apos;s landfall. U.S. Fleet Forces is the maritime
component command of U.S. Northern Command, Department of Defense&apos;s lead
supporting the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

The ship was already underway conducting routine training operations off
the coast of Virginia when called upon to prepare for possible disaster
relief efforts for Hurricane Ike.

Nassau&apos;s mission is to embark, deploy and land a Marine landing force by
helicopter, attack aircraft or amphibious vehicle. This multipurpose
ship has a highly trained crew and ready capabilities to perform many
types of missions, including humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.

NNS080924-13. NMCB 4 Hospital Corpsman Saves Life in Romania&gt;From Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 4 Public Affairs

SINOE, Romania (NNS) -- A corpsman assigned to Naval Mobile Construction
Battalion (NMCB) 4 helped save the life of a Romanian national in Sinoe
Sept. 11 by performing lifesaving CPR.

In the morning hours, a local Romanian civilian worker was performing
maintenance on an air conditioning unit on the Romanian Seabee camp. The
civilian worker was electrocuted with a 320-volt current that passed
through his chest causing his heart to stop and breathing to cease. The
patient fell to the floor unconscious.

Hospital Corpsman 2nd Class Joshua Vanderley was the first responder and
within seconds he began to perform CPR. He performed chest compressions
while an Army physician intubated the patient and began ventilations.
Vanderley and the Army physician worked nonstop on the patient for more
than 15 minutes performing chest compressions, ventilations and shocking
the patient using an automated external defibrillator until they were
able to get the patient&apos;s heart beating again.&quot;It was a team effort from the doctor, Army medics and me working as a
team to help save this man&apos;s life,&quot;Vanderley said.

The patient&apos;s family and friends thanked the group for their heroic efforts.&quot;I believe that my years of training instinctively took over and I just
did my job,&quot;he said Vanderlay.

The patient was transported via ambulance to a local hospital in Romania
and is recovering from the accident.

painted rooms in two schools while Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Europe
(CNE) brass quintet performed in Libreville Sept. 15-16 during their
11-day Africa Sports Diplomacy Tour to West and Central Africa.

Soccer players painted four rooms at the Prytanee School Sept. 15, a
military boarding school, as well as one room at the Martin Luther King
School Sept. 16.

In his speech during the ceremony, Eric Honore Diboh, director of the
school, thanked the U.S. Navy for their efforts at the school.&quot;This will take care of the children of the poor families here,&quot;said Diboh.

The CNE band brass quintet also performed for the children, with ages
ranging from three to 12, leading the children in marches around their
schools.

In addition, the team delivered Project Handclasp donations - including
school supplies, soccer balls, stuffed animals, hygiene items and
medical supplies  to the Martin Luther King School during a ceremony.

Project Handclasp is an official U.S. Navy program that coordinates the
transportation and delivery of humanitarian, educational and goodwill
material donated by charity organizations, corporations and private
citizens in the United States for distribution to recipients in foreign
countries.&quot;I&apos;m really happy to be doing this; growing up in a third-world country,
no one ever came to paint my schools or donate school supplies,&quot;said
Hospitalman Andre Huggins, a member of the soccer team originally from
Jamaica.&quot;I feel fortunate to be able to do this for these kids. I&apos;ve
been in the Navy a year and a half and this is what I wanted to do for
people.&quot;The 37-person diplomacy team will spend 11 days touring three West
African nations  Cape Verde, Cameroon and Gabon  as an addition to the
Africa Partnership Station (APS) initiative. Their goals will be to
build understanding and develop goodwill between the U.S. and its
emerging partners through sports, music and community relations projects.

The tour, from Sept. 818, provided the opportunity for soccer players
to interact with their counterparts and build a foundation of trust
through continuous presence and cultural awareness.

The APS initiative began in 2007 with USS Fort McHenry and HSV2 Swift.
It is a U.S. Naval Forces Europe led endeavor focused on enhancing
cooperative partnerships with regional maritime services in order to
achieve common international goals such as stability and security.

NNS080924-17. Seabees Answer the Call for Local Romanian Clinic

By Construction Electrician 2nd Class (SCW) Neal Walker, Naval Mobile
Construction Battalion 4 Public Affairs

SINOE, Romania (NNS) -- Naval Mobile Construction Battalion (NMCB) 4
walked through a dilapidated medical clinic in Sinoe to gather
measurements, digital pictures, and schematic ideas Sept. 11 in advance
of major repairs.

Seabees repaired and renovated the health care facility, including
providing indoor plumbing.

Originally a home built during the 1940&apos;s, the structure had transformed
over the years from a home, to a post office, and into its present-day
form of a clinic. Throughout the facility, stone heaters were the only
means of warmth for doctor and patients during the harsh Romanian
winters, the electrical system was outdated, and power had since been
shut off to the building for more then 10 years. With no power, the
clinic&apos;s doctor had only been able to work twice a week during daylight
hours.&quot;The biggest concern I have is for the electrical system,&quot;said Builder
1st Class (SCW) Patrick Posey.&quot;It needs to be updated, and safety
features need to be installed. All of this will enable the doctor to use
all of his medical equipment.&quot;Sinoe&apos;s clinic had succumb to disrepair due to lack of public funding,
and without that particular help, Gheorghe Grameni, mayor of Sinoe, was
concerned that medical care for the local people would soon be
nonexistent. Grameni welcomed the Seabees&apos; help and volunteered his own
workers in the town hall to help clean up the site and shut off
utilities. Grameni also invited the Seabees to his home for dinner.

Once the Seabees finish the project, scheduled for completion Oct. 10,
Grameni hopes the clinic&apos;s renovations will give Sinoe&apos;s people 24-hour
emergency care. The capability will be a key health care improvement
since the nearest medical facility outside of Sinoe is over an hour and
a half away by car, and most people still use horse-drawn carriages.&quot;This is a very important project for the people of Sinoe with
long-lasting effects. They will be able to gain so much when the project
is completed. Most importantly, in the near future residents can seek
immediate care at all hours of the day or night,&quot;said Lt. Anthony
Haverly, NMCB4&apos;s officer in charge.

NNS080924-14. USS Curts Departs Palau

By Lt.j.g. Bryan Boggs, USS Curts Public Affairs

KOROR, Palau (NNS) -- USS Curts (FFG 38) departed Koror Sept. 20 after a
scheduled six-day port visit during her return homeward after a Western
Pacific and Persian Gulf deployment with the Abraham Lincoln Carrier
Strike Group.

While in port, crew members offered ship tours to local school children
as part of a community relations (COMREL) project. The children were
enthusiastic and curious about life aboard a naval vessel.&quot;Usually our COMRELs involve painting or some physical labor. This was
different; we just interacted with the kids and had a lot of fun getting
to know them,&quot;Dumpit said, adding,&quot;It was nice change of pace,&quot;said
Storekeeper 3rd Class (SW) Clifford Dumpit.

Later, a U.S. Navy Seabee battalion stationed on Palau paired up with
the Curts crew and aided in the distribution of more than 850 pounds of
hygienic material and toys as part of Project Handclasp. The material
was distributed to the local hospital and to local schools where it was
graciously received, said Cmdr. Yvette Davids, Curts&apos; commanding officer.&quot;Building a relationship with the community through COMREL tours and
Project Handclasp made a lasting impression on Curts&apos; Sailors,&quot;Davids
said.&quot;It is with great hopes that these small contributions share in
expressing the crew&apos;s profound thanks in Palau&apos;s warm welcome to Curts&apos;
crew throughout the visit.

The crew spent the rest of their time exploring the Palau&apos;s famous Rock
Islands, kayaking, scuba diving, snorkeling, swimming with stingless
jelly fish, and hiking.

The Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group is on a scheduled deployment in
the U.S. 7th Fleet area of responsibility. Operating in the Western
Pacific and Indian Ocean, the U.S. 7th Fleet is the largest of the
forward-deployed U.S. fleets covering 52 million square miles, with
approximately 60-70 ships, 200-300 aircraft and 40,000 Sailors and
Marines assigned at any given time.

NNS080924-05. Sailors, Seabees Help After Ike Devastates Flight Museum

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Riza Caparros

GALVESTON, Texas (NNS) -- Sailors from USS Nassau (LHA 4) based out of
Norfolk, Va., and Seabee Amphibious Construction Battalion 2 (ACB 2),
based out of Little Creek, Va., had the opportunity to help the
Galveston community after Hurricane Ike devastated the area in
mid-September.

The ship sent more than 50 Sailors to the Lone Star Flight Museum that
was severely damaged after the storm surged nearly 10 feet of water
above the floor.&quot;The only thing that you can tell what it was before the storm hit are
the airplanes,&quot;said Larry Gregory, president, Lone Star Flight Museum.&quot;Everything else was destroyed - the displays, the gift shop, all the
relics of different time periods, the museum maintenance shop. It is
really overwhelming.&quot;One Nassau Sailor at the museum described the feeling of the Galveston
community as comparable to the feeling he felt after 9/11.&quot;The country came together, everyone, no matter who you are, what you
do, what uniform you wear,&quot;said Damage Controlman 3rd Class (SW/AW)
Courtney Stratton.&quot;We&apos;re all here for the same reason  to help the
people of Galveston get back on their feet.&quot;Retired Lt. Cmdr. James Kline, former E2-Hawkeye Navy pilot and
long-time flight museum volunteer said the damage hit home in more ways
than one.&quot;It was devastating to see the damage. Everything in that museum was a
part of our heritage and many were part of our naval aviation heritage.&quot;&quot;It feels so personal,&quot;he added.

Kline also described the pride he felt being a part of the Navy and
seeing his fellow service members helping at the museum.&quot;I feel a wonderful sense of pride seeing the Sailors and Seabees
helping us to bring back the museum to what it once was,&quot;continued Kline.

Tom Gregory, retired Marine Corps pilot, chief pilot and 16-year
volunteer at the flight museum told the public to be patient.&quot;It will take time, but we will rebuild and continue to show the
historic side of aviation to the public again.&quot;Operations Specialist 3rd Class, Jodyann Miller, said she will never
forget the feeling she has with helping to restore the museum.&quot;I am so proud to be a part of this effort today,&quot;said Miller.&quot;Hopefully after all the cleaning is done, they can restore the museum
to be even better than it once was before the storm.&quot;&quot;I also feel good to be able to help my fellow Americans. That is a
great feeling.&quot;For more news from USS Nassau, visit www.navy.mil/local/lha4.

NNS080924-04. Abe Sailor Reunites with Family While Deployed

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Arianne Anderson, USS Abraham
Lincoln Public Affairs

LAEM CHABANG, Thailand (NNS) -- One USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72) Sailor
reunited with his family Sept. 15 during the ship&apos;s recent port call to
Thailand.

Information Systems Technician 2nd Class (SW/AW) Norrandt Sutakul of
Lincoln&apos;s Combat Systems Department, born in Bangkok, was able to visit
with his uncle, Commander in Chief, Royal Thai Fleet Adm. Prawit
Srisukwatana.

Sutakul was given a tour of a local Royal Thai Naval Base, Viharna Sien
(a Buddhist museum) and enjoyed dinner, karaoke and old-fashioned family
time.&quot;I was really surprised to get the call that he wanted to see me,&quot;Sutakul said.&quot;I&apos;m very happy and excited. I haven&apos;t seen him in eight
years.&quot;Sutakul moved to the United States when he was six years old, but during
his early childhood he spent a lot of time with his uncle and his cousin.&quot;He has a daughter my age, so we spent a lot of time playing at his
house,&quot;Sutakul said.&quot;But, since moving to the United States, this is
only the second time I&apos;ve seen him. It&apos;s a very special experience.&quot;Sutakul joined the Navy when his grandfather passed away.&quot;He was a commander in the Royal Thai Navy, and I wanted to join in
honor of him,&quot;he said.

Srisukwatana said the visit was a great experience as well.&quot;It&apos;s a great feeling,&quot;Srisukwatana said.&quot;I&apos;m very proud of (Sutakul).
I love the U.S. Navy. Every time a U.S. Navy ship comes to Thailand, I
feel thankful. Thailand and America have very good relations.&quot;Srisukwatana said the U.S. Navy has made the Royal Thai Navy better.&quot;The largest exercise in our area is between the U.S. and the Royal Thai
Navy, the Cobra Gold exercise,&quot;he said.&quot;We take what we learn from the
U.S. and apply it to our navy to make it better.&quot;Sutakul said he loves Thailand, but he&apos;s proud to be a United States Sailor.&quot;[Thailand is] a great place to visit and have fun,&quot;he said.&quot;I&apos;ve kept
my roots, but I&apos;m happy where I&apos;m at.&quot;Sutakul, who recently re-enlisted and plans to apply for the limited
duty officer program, is currently deployed with Lincoln in the U.S. 7th
Fleet area of responsibility. Operating in the Western Pacific and
Indian Ocean, the U.S. 7th Fleet is the largest of the forward-deployed
U.S. fleets covering 52 million square miles, with approximately 60-70
ships, 200-300 aircraft and 40,000 Sailors and Marines assigned at any
given time.

NNS080924-03. Columbia Mayor Makes City&apos;s First Navy Week Official

By Lt. Chris G. Neeley, Navy Office of Community Outreach Public Affairs

COLUMBIA, S.C. (NNS) -- The Mayor of Columbia, S.C,. made the city&apos;s
first Navy Week official Sept. 23 during a proclamation ceremony at City
Hall with citizens and Sailors in attendance.&quot;The city of Columbia has always been a strong military town with a more
than 170-year relationship with the Navy,&quot;said Mayor Bob Coble.&quot;We are
pleased today to honor the Navy and all those who have served in it.&quot;More than 25 Sailors from across the Midlands attended the ceremony. The
Sailors represented several area commands, including the University of
South Carolina Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps, Navy Individual
Augmentee Combat Training Command, Navy Recruiting District Raleigh and
Navy Operational Support Center Columbia.

Receiving the proclamation on behalf of the Navy was Cmdr. Joseph Klein,
commanding officer, Navy Recruiting District (NRD) Raleigh.&quot;Long before there was Fort Jackson in Columbia there was the U.S.
Navy&apos;s USS Columbia...a small frigate that served as the city&apos;s first
namesake ship,&quot;said Klein.&quot;Now, 172 years after the launching of the Columbia, the Navy is still
here, and we&apos;re stronger and better than ever. I want to thank the
citizens of Columbia who have supported the Navy for so long. We are
especially grateful to all those citizens from the Midlands who have
either served, serving, or had a love one serve in our Navy going back
to its founding, many of whom gave the ultimate sacrifice.&quot;Columbia Navy Week kicked off Sept. 21 with a military appreciation
ceremony in front of more than 76,000 fans and a national pay-per-view
audience at the University of South Carolina football game against
Wofford College.

Columbia Navy Week is one of 22 Navy weeks planned across America in
2008. Navy weeks are designed to show Americans the investment they have
made in their Navy and increase awareness in cities that do not have a
significant Navy presence.

NNS081002-05. Navy Announces Updates to IA/GSA Assignment Policies

By Chief Mass Communication Specialist (SW) Maria Yager

MILLINGTON, Tenn (NNS) -- The Navy announced updates Sept. 29 to the
Individual Augmentee Manpower Management (IAMM) and Global War on
Terrorism (GWOT) Support Assignment (GSA) programs, the two programs
used for manning the Navy&apos;s joint manning doctrine requirements for GWOT.&quot;Our efforts are focused on meeting our operational and GWOT support
requirements, while providing our Sailors and their families the support
they deserve,&quot;said Vice Adm. Mark Ferguson, III, Chief of Naval
Personnel, in the NAVADMIN.&quot;Our goal remains to move the majority of GWOT assignments into normal
PCS rotation window, increase predictability and stability for our
Sailors and their families, and improve manning stability at the unit
level,&quot;added Ferguson.

The NAVADMIN 276/08 provides updates on follow-on detailing, IA
advancement rates, suitability screening, enlisted and junior officer
IA/GSA assignments, and it also discusses the impact of Status of Forces
Agreements on GSA Sailors whose families wish to remain overseas.

Advancement data show that IA/GSA Sailors have a higher overall average
advancement rate than Sailors who have not served an IA/GSA. In the most
recent chief petty officer selection board, IA/GSA Sailors had a higher
than average selection rates to chief. Selection boards are directed to
give favorable consideration to those candidates displaying superior
performance while serving in direct support of GWOT.

The NAVADMIN lists detailing guarantees for junior officers in pay
grades 0-1 to 0-3 who complete an IA or GSA tour from shore slates.
Guarantees include choice of fleet concentration area or homeport upon
completion of a GSA/IA tour, and slating credit, which ranks an officer
who has completed an IA/GSA above peers with similar qualifications and
fitness reports.

The NAVADMIN discusses options for Sailors who wish for their families
to remain overseas while serving on the GSA. In those instances where a
Sailor is disadvantaged by GSA, and the overseas commander agrees to
host dependents while the Sailor is on the IA, IAMM may be allowed in
lieu of GSA orders. Requests for IAMM vice GSA orders from overseas
Sailors must be made to detailers during the orders negotiation process,
and must be positively endorsed by the command indicating sponsorship
for the entire IA tour.

Sailors interested in serving an IA or GSA should review NAVADMIN 276/08
in its entirety. The NAVADMIN can be found under messages at
www.npc.navy.mil.

Additional guidance is also available in NAVADMINs 002/08 Individual
Augmentee Manpower Management Business Rules and 003/08 GSA Detailing
Business Rules.

NNS081002-15. New Submarine Rescue Asset Joins Fleet&gt;From Team Submarine Public Affairs

WASHINGTON (NNS) -- The Submarine Rescue Diving and Recompression
System&apos;s (SRDRS) Rescue Capable System (RCS) replaced the Deep
Submergence Rescue Vehicle Mystic (DSRV-1) as the U.S. Navy&apos;s
deep-submergence submarine rescue asset on Sept. 30. Mystic and the DSRV
program began deactivation on Oct. 1.

SRDRS is a rapidly deployable rescue asset that can be delivered by air
or ground, installed on pre-screened military or commercial vessels of
opportunity (VOO) via a ship interface template, and mated to a
distressed submarine within a 72-hour time to first rescue period.

Mystic is a small rescue submarine capable of deploying via air or
ground to a port where it is mated to a specially-configured submarine
which serves as the host platform for the voyage to the disabled submarine.&quot;Mystic has served the United States and the international submarine
community admirably for the last 31 years,&quot;said Steve Schulze,
executive director, Undersea Warfare, Naval Sea Systems Command.&quot;Mystic brought new capabilities to the fleet when she entered service
in 1977; now SRDRS builds upon those innovations, delivering even
greater capabilities to the international submarine community.&quot;SRDRS is a three-phased acquisition program that will deliver advanced
submarine rescue and treatment assets to the fleet. The first phase of
the program was the Atmospheric Dive System 2000 (ADS2000) which was
delivered to the Navy in 2006. ADS2000 is a manned, one-atmosphere dive
suit capable of inspecting disabled submarines and clearing debris from
escape hatches. The RCS constitutes SRDRS&apos; second phase.

SRDRS-RCS consists of Falcon, the tethered, remotely-operated
Pressurized Rescue Module (PRM), its launch and recovery system, and its
support equipment; all of which are controlled from a VOO.

The final phase of the SRDRS program is the Submarine Decompression
System (SDS), scheduled for delivery in late 2012. SDS will allow
rescued submariners to remain under pressure during the transfer from
the PRM to hyperbaric treatment chambers aboard the VOO.

Unlike Mystic, which could only be transported to the disabled submarine
via modified submarines, SRDRS is a&quot;fly-away&quot;system that can quickly
and easily be mobilized via large military or civilian transport
aircraft and installed aboard a variety of VOOs within hours of
notification of a submarine in distress.

Falcon can conduct rescue operations to a depth of 2,000 feet, can mate
to a disabled submarine at a list and trim of up to 45 degrees, and can
transfer up to 16 personnel at a time. Mystic required its own power
source  necessitating a two-hour battery charge between cycles. Because
SRDRS-RCS receives its power from a VOO via an umbilical, it can operate
around the clock without pause.&quot;SRDRS has been a tremendously successful program to date,&quot;said Rear
Adm. William Hilarides, program executive officer for submarines.&quot;We
took this platform and exercised it in some difficult conditions on the
world stage and it performed up to our very high expectations.&quot;SRDRS underwent a unique test and operational evaluation during the
international submarine rescue exercise Bold Monarch in May-June 2008.
During Bold Monarch, SRDRS demonstrated its ability to mate and transfer
personnel from three participating submarines, one each from Norway, the
Netherlands, and Poland. Personnel from the United Kingdom, Australia,
Canada, Russia, Pakistan, India, Norway, Italy, Israel, Sweden, Spain,
Singapore, the Netherlands, France, and China spent time aboard SRDRS.
More recently, SRDRS demonstrated its capabilities during an exercise
with the Chilean submarine CS Simpson (SS-21) Sept. 17-18.&quot;From a testing and certification standpoint, SRDRS has delivered on all
of its initial expectations,&quot;said Capt. Gary Dunlap, program manager
for Advanced Undersea Systems.&quot;This system provides not only the U.S.
Navy, but all navies, with a flexible, capable, and  most importantly 
rapidly deployable rescue asset.&quot;SRDRS will be based out of San Diego, and operated by the Navy&apos;s Deep
Submergence Unit.

NNS081002-17. George Washington Heads to Sea for First Time as a Part of
the FDNF

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Carlos Gomez, USS George
Washington Public Affairs

USS GEORGE WASHINGTON, At Sea (NNS) -- USS George Washington (CVN 73)
headed out to sea from Yokosuka, Japan, Oct. 1, for the first time as
the Navy&apos;s only permanently forward deployed aircraft carrier to conduct
training and to participate in exercises with regional naval partners.

The Nimitz-class aircraft carrier arrived at Yokosuka Sept. 25, after
replacing USS Kitty Hawk (CV 63), which has returned to the United
States for decommissioning after spending the last 10 years
forward-deployed to Japan.&quot;The hospitality of our new neighbors in Yokosuka is phenomenal. We were
home for only five days, but experienced a month&apos;s worth of welcome!&quot;said George Washington&apos;s Commanding Officer, Capt. J. R. Haley.&quot;Now we are at sea doing what we trained to do. As the Forward Deployed
Naval Force&apos;s (FDNF) carrier, we work with our regional partners in our
primary mission - maritime security and stability.&quot;This underway is significant because it is George Washington&apos;s first
operational experience in the region, and its first operations with
regional naval partners.&quot;We obviously want to put our best foot forward while working for the
first time with regional navies,&quot;said George Washington&apos;s Operations
Officer, Cmdr. Anthony Calandra.&quot;GW brings a substantial upgrade to the
support of our regional alliances, and we begin building our operational
reputation today.&quot;For more news from Commander, U.S. 7th Fleet, visit

NNS081002-10. Stennis Puts New Growlers to the Test

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SW) Elliott J. Fabrizio, USS
John C. Stennis Public Affairs

USS JOHN C. STENNIS, At Sea (NNS) -- The EA-18G Growler and the
advantages it brings are being tested for the first time in an
integrated operational environment aboard USS John C. Stennis (CVN 74)
by Air Test and Evaluation Squadron (VX) 9 as part of Operation
Evaluation (OPEVAL).

The Growler is an electronic attack aircraft, using the same airframe as
the F/A-18F Super Hornet. It&apos;s scheduled to replace the EA-6B Prowler in
spring 2009 and continue the electronic attack mission in carrier strike
groups.&quot;This carrier test is part of a large test matrix that we have for the
airplane. Basically, it&apos;s the final exam for the aircraft,&quot;said VX-9
Electronic Warfare Branch Head Cmdr. Al Bradford.

Squadron pilots will fly during night carrier operations for the first
time as they test the Growler&apos;s overall practical operability on the
flight deck.&quot;During the tests, VX-9 will evaluate how the aircraft and its
electronic attack components hold up during carrier landings,&quot;said Mike
Dobelman, Boeing field service representative.

Stennis&apos; flight deck crew is providing feedback as they work with the
new aircraft to help VX-9 evaluate handling the Growler.

One concern the squadron is seeking feedback on is the difficulty of
identifying similar aircraft.

Air Department Mini Boss Brice Lund noted that the jamming pods located
on the wings of the Growler is one way to prevent miss-identification
from arising during flight deck operations.

However, using the same airframe as the F/A-18F gives the Growler many
advantages over its predecessor.
Growlers fly with a two-man crew where the Prowler needs a crew of four.&quot;The Growler crew is able to do the same mission with half as many
people because the airplane has a lot of automated features that the
Prowler does not,&quot;said Bradford.&quot;Navigation, communications and the
entire crew-vehicle interface is much more automated.&quot;Replacing the aging Prowlers will also cut down on the amount of
maintenance squadron Sailors must perform.
Changing the engine on an EA-6B Prowler requires about two days of work.
Changing the engine on the EA-18G Growler only takes about two to three
hours.
Growlers also reduce the work load on the flight deck.&quot;The Prowlers can&apos;t start on their own,&quot;said Aircraft Handling Officer
Lt. Eric Harrington.&quot;They need to get assisted power, so that means
more ground support up here. Having the Growlers up here does away with
that, because now they can start on their own. That&apos;ll minimize the
amount of equipment and personnel that have to support that aircraft.&quot;Having the Super Hornet&apos;s airframe not only makes improvements in
operability, but adds new tactical elements, such as self-defense to the
electronic attack mission.

While not intended for strike operations, the Growler can fire advanced
medium-range, air-to-air missiles to defend itself.

Performing carrier landings on Stennis gives VX-9 a better sense of the
Growler&apos;s tactical capacities and functionality as they conduct OPEVAL.

Testing new aircraft in an operational environment ensures that the Navy
has access to the most technically advanced and operationally ready
military assets to carry out America&apos;s Maritime Strategy.

NNS081002-12. One-Half Million &apos;Tax Free&apos; SRB Dollars Go to &apos;Stay Navy&apos;
Peleliu Sailors

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class (SW) Sarah Bitter, USS
Peleliu Public Affairs

USS PELELIU, At Sea (NNS) -- Approximately $500,000 in Selective
Re-enlistment Bonuses (SRBs) has been paid out to Sailors aboard USS
Peleliu (LHA 5) who have decided to&quot;Stay Navy&quot;during the past four months.

The group of 33 Sailors took advantage of the fact that the ship was
operating in the tax-free zone of the U.S. 5th Fleet&apos;s area of operation
from June 13 until Sept. 23 when making their decision to re-enlist.

Senior Chief Navy Career Counselor (SW/AW) Rita Carman, Peleliu&apos;s senior
career counselor, explained SRBs are a market-based incentive allowing
enlisted community managers to strategically adjust award levels as
retention needs change.&quot;This program is one of the Navy&apos;s best career incentives,&quot;said Carman.&quot;The SRB program enhances the Navy&apos;s ability to size, shape and
stabilize the force by using a monetary incentive to encourage Sailors
with critical skills and valuable experience to &apos;Stay Navy&apos;.&quot;Prior to receiving an SRB, Sailors must meet certain pre-qualifications
such as required job certification and certain job-specific training
that make them essential to the Navy&apos;s mission.

Peleliu Command Master Chief (SW/SS) Brent Williams noted it is
important that the Navy use the SRB program to keep quality Sailors in
uniform.&quot;It allows us to retain the much needed talent that it takes to keep the
Navy operating,&quot;said Williams.&quot;Not to have the SRB or any incentives
for that matter, would allow the civilian sector to take more Sailors
than they do now. The bonuses allow us to ensure that we maintain the
qualified and much needed personnel; I wish we could give more bonuses
to more rates across the board.&quot;Sailors who made the decision to re-enlist said the SRB incentives made
their choice very easy.&quot;It feels awesome,&quot;said Intelligence Specialist 2nd Class Martin Lopez,
who received a $45,000 tax-free SRB.&quot;It&apos;s very comforting to know my
financial worries are now gone. I plan to pay off bills, put some into
TSP [Thrift Savings Plan], and save the rest for some business
investments.&quot;Peleliu is the flag ship of the Peleliu Expeditionary Strike Group
(PELESG) and the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit which is conducting
operations in the U.S. 7th Fleet area of responsibility. The PELESG
departed San Diego May 4 on a scheduled deployment.

NNS081002-14. Peleliu Sailor and Marines Celebrate Hispanic Heritage
Month &apos;Fiesta Style&apos;

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Corwin Colbert and Mass
Communication Specialist Seaman (SW) Michelle Rhonehouse, USS Peleliu
Public Affairs

USS PELELIU, At sea (NNS) -- Hundreds of Sailors and Marines aboard the
amphibious assault ship USS Peleliu (LHA 5) took a break from normal
operations and observed Hispanic Heritage Month with a&quot;Fiesta Style&quot;celebration Sept. 26 in the ship&apos;s hangar bay.

Hispanic Heritage month runs from Sept. 15 through Oct. 15 and is a time
for individuals to recognize the contributions of Hispanic Americans.
Peleliu&apos;s celebration included a piñata, authentic food, and traditional
dances. The event was also planned to coincide with a&quot;Steel Beach&quot;picnic to allow maximum participation by the crew.&quot;Hispanic is not just a racial identification,&quot;said Chief Navy Career
Counselor (SW/SCW) Carlos Lemas who was the guest speaker for the event.&quot;Hispanic is more of a regional identification like saying &apos;North
American&apos;.&quot;Lemas spoke about the many contributions of Hispanic Americans and their
proud tradition of serving in the U.S. Navy in every conflict since the
American Revolution. He recognized the service of more than 63,000
Hispanic Sailors and civilians who comprise approximately 11 percentof
the Navy&apos;s active, reserve and civilian forces.&quot;Hispanic Heritage Month is not only a period to recognize the Hispanic
Americans for their heritage and culture, but it is also to celebrate
the contributions of the many Hispanic Americans who have served and
continue to serve our country proudly,&quot;said Lemas.

Sailors who attended the event said that they really enjoyed the dancing
demonstrations.&quot;The Salsa was my favorite dance to watch because it&apos;s what we do back
home,&quot;said Aviation Boatswain&apos;s Mate (Fuels) (AW) Rafael Zelaya, who
was born in El Salvador and works in Peleliu&apos;s air department.&quot;All the
performers stuck to the traditional dances and did so with pride and
respect. They made me want to go out there and dance with them. It was
like being at home again.&quot;Hispanic Heritage Month was established in 1988 by President Ronald
Reagan, expanding the heritage week established in 1968. Forty-three men
of Hispanic origin have earned the Medal of Honor, including 21 who
sacrificed their lives. Latinos are the largest single ethnic group, in
proportion to the number who served, to earn this prestigious award.

Peleliu is the flag ship of the Peleliu Expeditionary Strike Group
(PELESG) and the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit which is currently
conducting operations in the U.S. 7th Fleet area of responsibility. The
PELESG departed San Diego May 4 on a scheduled deployment.

NNS081002-09. Navy Confirms Sunken Submarine is Grunion

By Mass Communications Specialist 1st Class (SW) Cynthia Clark,
COMSUBPAC Public Affairs

PEARL HARBOR (NNS) -- Commander, Submarine Forces Pacific Fleet
(COMSUBPAC), Rear Adm. Douglas McAneny announced today that a sunken
vessel off the coast of the Aleutian Islands is in fact the World War II
submarine USS Grunion (SS 216).&quot;I am honored to announce that, with records and information provided by
the Abele family and assistance from the Naval Historical Center, USS
Grunion has been located,&quot;said McAneny.&quot;We are very grateful to the
family of Grunion&apos;s Commanding Officer Lt. Cmdr. Mannert L. Abele for
providing the underwater video footage and pictures that allowed us to
make this determination. We also appreciate the efforts of the USS Cod
Submarine Memorial for their assistance in this matter. We hope this
announcement will help to give closure to the families of the 70 crewmen
of Grunion.&quot;The submarine Grunion arrived at Pearl Harbor on June 20, 1942. The
vessel completed pre-patrol training before departing on its first war
patrol June 30. Grunion&apos;s commanding officer, Lt. Cmdr. Abele, was
ordered to proceed to the Aleutian Islands and patrol westward from Attu
on routes between the Aleutians and the Japanese Empire. On July 10,
Grunion was reassigned to the area north of Kiska. Over the next 20
days, the submarine reported firing on an enemy destroyer, sinking three
destroyer-type vessels, and attacking unidentified enemy ships near Kiska.

Grunion&apos;s last transmission was received on July 30, 1942. The submarine
reported heavy antisubmarine activity at the entrance to Kiska, and that
it had 10 torpedoes remaining forward. On the same day, Grunion was
directed to return to Dutch Harbor Naval Operating Base. There was no
contact or sighting of the submarine after July 30, and on August 16,
Grunion was reported lost.

Abele was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for heroism. A destroyer,
USS Mannert L. Abele (DD 733), was commissioned in his honor, and was
later lost in action off Okinawa in 1945. Japanese anti-submarine attack
data recorded no attack in the Aleutian area at the time of Grunion&apos;s
disappearance, so the submarine&apos;s fate remained an unsolved mystery for
more than 60 years.

After discovering information on the internet in 2002 that helped
pinpoint USS Grunion&apos;s possible location, the sons of Grunion&apos;s
commanding officer, Bruce, Brad, and John Abele, began working on a plan
to find the submarine. In August 2006, a team of side scan sonar experts
hired by the brothers located a target near Kiska almost a mile below
the ocean&apos;s surface. A second expedition in August 2007 using a high
definition camera on a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) yielded video
footage and high resolution photos of the wreckage of a U.S. fleet
submarine.&quot;This discovery has come about through a stream of seemingly improbable
events; it&apos;s like we won the lottery 10 times in a row,&quot;said Bruce
Abele, eldest son of Grunion&apos;s commanding officer.&quot;It is so dramatic to
see the underwater photo and be certain it was in fact Grunion; not only
is this announcement important for the families of the crew members,
it&apos;s also important for the Navy and the country.&quot;The Abele brothers then contacted the USS Cod Submarine Memorial for
assistance in identifying the wreckage. The vessel is lying at a depth
of about 3,200 feet. Very cold water and lack of significant currents
has preserved much of the wreckage.

Dr. John Fakan, director of the USS Cod Submarine Memorial, remarked
about the importance of having an unmodified example in USS Cod, a
fellow Gato-class submarine, in identifying the wreckage of USS Grunion.&quot;USS Grunion and USS Cod shared the same blueprints,&quot;he said.&quot;It is
very gratifying for me and my crew to help with the identification of
the submarine.&quot;With the information provided by the Abele family and the USS Cod
Submarine Memorial, COMSUBPAC and the Naval Historical Center examined
the evidence and historical records and determined that the submarine
found at the reported position could only be USS Grunion.&quot;The synergy of our group working together with the Navy for the common
cause has been a wonderful group effort,&quot;Bruce Abele said.&quot;The
teamwork combined with everyone&apos;s compassion and wisdom has resulted in
our success.&quot;According to Bruce&apos;s brother John Abele, those responsible for
contributing to this discovery included historians and engineers from
the United States, Australia, Israel and Japan. Of particular note was
the involvement of Japanese naval architect Yutaka Iwasaki, who provided
information critical to pinpointing the location of the submarine.

Bruce and John&apos;s brother, retired Lt. Brad Abele, who recently passed
away, also played a significant role in the find. As his brother John
explained,&quot;Brad&apos;s experience as a Naval aviator helped a great deal by
helping us to plot the strategy for the discovery.&quot;Unfortunately, the cause of Grunion&apos;s sinking remains a mystery. No
matter what the cause, the end result was the loss of all hands. As the
Naval Historical Center noted,&quot;no amount of analysis or speculation
will change or alter the fact that families lost fathers, husbands,
uncles and brothers the Navy and the nation will always be grateful for
their service and their sacrifice.&quot;Former Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet Admiral Chester
Nimitz once said,&quot;When I assumed command of the Pacific Fleet on 31
December 1941 our submarines were already operating against the enemy,
the only units of the Fleet that could come to grips with the Japanese
for months to come. It was to the Submarine Force that I looked to carry
the load until our great industrial activity could produce the weapons
we so sorely needed to carry the war to the enemy. It is to the
everlasting honor and glory of our submarine personnel that they never
failed us in our days of great peril.&quot;By the end of World War II, submarines had made more than 1,600 war
patrols. Pacific Fleet submarines like Grunion accounted for more than
half of all enemy shipping sunk during the war. The cost of this success
was heavy: 52 U.S. Pacific Fleet submarines were lost, and more than
3,500 submariners remain on&quot;eternal patrol.&quot;A representative of the submarine force will speak on behalf of the U.S.
Navy at a memorial service in Cleveland, Ohio, Oct. 11. The service,
hosted by the USS Cod Memorial, will honor the 70 crewmembers killed
when USS Grunion was sunk near the Aleutian Islands on or about July 30,
1942.&quot;To provide ourselves and the families this closure, it&apos;s icing on the
cake,&quot;said John Abele.&quot;The memorial service is a symbolic event; we&apos;ve
discovered family we didn&apos;t know we had. Not only is this an honor for
all of us, it increases the feeling of community we&apos;ve been able to
achieve.&quot;For more news from Commander, Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet, visit

NNS081002-11. USS Russell Returns from Western Pacific Deployment

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Michael A. Lantron,
Commander, Navy Region Hawaii Public Affairs

PEARL HARBOR (NNS) -- Sailors aboard the Arleigh Burke-class
guided-missile destroyer USS Russell (DDG 59) returned to their homeport
of Naval Station (NAVSTA) Pearl Harbor Oct. 1 following a six-month
deployment to the Western Pacific in support of the global war on terrorism.&quot;It&apos;s been a long deployment so it feels great to be home,&quot;said
Boatswain&apos;s Mate Seaman Ryan Cook.&quot;I&apos;ve been waiting five months to
finally meet my daughter [for the first time] and it&apos;s an amazing feeling.&quot;Cook added that he was proud of his other shipmates and was glad to be a
member of Russell&apos;s crew for the deployment.&quot;We have a great crew here,&quot;said Cook.&quot;We all worked long days and
nights during the deployment to make sure the job was done.&quot;The U.S. Pacific Fleet Band and hula dancers performed while friends and
family held &apos;welcome home&apos; signs and waved to the Sailors as the ship
came alongside the pier.&quot;I&apos;m so excited that I&apos;m at a loss for words,&quot;said a wife of a Russell
Sailor.&quot;It&apos;s great to finally see them come home.&quot;After the ship moored and the brow was in place, Sailors rushed down the
brow to embrace loved ones on the pier and enjoy well-deserved liberty.&quot;It&apos;s great to see all of the family and friends on the pier waiting for
us on such a beautiful day,&quot;said Cmdr. Jeff Weston, Russell&apos;s
commanding officer.&quot;It makes coming home that much more special.&quot;Weston also added his thanks to the Sailors for a mission accomplished.&quot;The crew performed spectacularly,&quot;said Weston.&quot;We spent very little
time in port and they all did amazing work out there. Every mission we
were tasked with we performed flawlessly and it&apos;s a credit to them.&quot;Russell and her crew departed Pearl Harbor on March 24 as part of the
USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72) Carrier Strike Group. Supporting Maritime
Security Operations in the 5th Fleet area of operations, Russell helped
develop security in the maritime environment and promoted stability and
global prosperity.

During the deployment, Russell interacted with coalition forces, offered
humanitarian assistance to a stranded boat with 70 Somalis onboard,
participated in joint exercises, and pulled into six ports, where its
crew contributed to the host nation in community relations projects.

Russell is 505 feet in length, 66 feet wide and has a maximum speed of
30 plus knots. The primary mission of Russell is to destroy enemy
aircraft, missiles, submarines, surface ships, and land targets. Russell
is normally assigned to a carrier strike group and brings significant
capabilities to the battle force, carrying the latest technology in all
areas of modern warfare.

NNS081002-04. NMCB 4 Provides Assistance to Camp Moreell Upgrades

By Construction Electrician 3rd Class Rostislav Fridhaim

CAMP MOREELL, Kuwait (NNS) -- During its deployment to the Naval Forces
Central Command (NAVCENT) area of responsibility, Naval Mobile
Construction Battalion (NMCB) 4 is divided in 13 different detachments
all with a specific mission.

One Detachment, Camp Moreell, is responsible for performing camp
maintenance, ensuring the proper functioning of its facilities and
overseeing the welfare of the various incoming troops which are moving
to and from the NAVCENT theater of operations.

Camp Moreell is located on an Air Force Base in Kuwait and is serving as
the main Seabee ground base and assembly point for all the Seabees who
are deploying across the entire Southwest Asia area of responsibility.
This is first place personnel will see before they are dispersed to
their different destinations and the last before they return to their
home and families.

Personnel find a welcoming, hospitable environment, which Det Moreell&apos;s
crew provides. In addition, the Seabees provide support to the Army
Logistics Support Area and the Air Force Air Base. The Seabees at Camp
Moreell are enhancing safety measures and recently began refurbishing
the MWR facility to improve quality of life, adding internet and phone
capabilities and providing a place for troops to relax after hours.

Det Camp Moreell is taking a lot of pride in their work, and it has
shown around the camp. NMCB 27 is currently at Camp Moreell waiting to
deploy to their final site.&quot;I have enjoyed my stay in this camp. The living conditions are great
and there is a significant improvement in all the aspects of quality of
life since I was here in 2005,&quot;Builder 1st Class Timothy Davidson of
NMCB 27 said.&quot;I believe so far we are doing an outstanding job, and expect that when
we go to do our turn-over with NMCB 11 we will turn over this camp in
better condition than we got it in, because we are continuously trying
to improve on what we have,&quot;Chief Utilitiesman (SCW) Lonnie Cosper said.

NNS081002-03. AFRICOM Commander Visits NMCB 4

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SCW/SW/AW) Ronald Gutridge,
Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 4 Det Horn of Africa Public Affairs

CAMP LEMONIER, Djibouti (NNS) -- Gen. William&quot;Kip&quot;Ward, commander,
United States Africa Command (AFRICOM), visited Naval Mobile
Construction Battalion (NMCB) 4 camp and project sites in Djibouti and
discussed the future of AFRICOM Sept. 23.

Ward spoke with Seabees from junior enlisted to senior leadership and
witnessed firsthand NMCB 4&apos;s ability to support his vision of greater
security and development. Touring the command&apos;s central tool room,
material liaison office and Alfa Company yard, Ward saw the tools,
equipment and supplies that the Seabees utilize to perform their
day-to-day operations.&quot;I was proud to have the opportunity to explain to the general how Alfa
Company operates,&quot;said Equipment Operator Constructionman Apprentice
Corinne Kuhn, Alfa Company collateral equipment manager.&quot;To show that
there is a lot more to it than just operating the equipment and
vehicles, and to demonstrate how all the different aspects of training
fall into place.&quot;Later that day, Ward observed NMCB 4 hard at work upgrading the Nagad
village&apos;s water system. Led by Project Leader Utilities Technician 3rd
Class Daniel Hardison, a crew of six Seabees is currently working to
upgrade the present system to supply cleaner, safer water by
constructing a concrete foundation for a new water distribution system,
rerouting existing water lines, and installing a separate water trough
for the village animals.&quot;I was very honored to describe to General Ward the construction aspect
of our project and how it will significantly reduce the chance of
sickness and disease,&quot;said Hardison.&quot;He was impressed by our concern
for the well-being of the villagers and our efforts to improve their lives.&quot;Ward expressed to the Seabees how important the humanitarian work being
done was, and what a positive effect it is making on the African nation.&quot;As we do our part to help bring about greater security, as that part
supports greater development, [it in turn supports] greater institutions
of government that bring to their people those things that satisfy their
basic needs,&quot;said Ward.&quot;You are at the forefront of that in all that
you do.&quot;NMCB 4 Detachment Horn of Africa is currently on a six-month deployment
supporting Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa and is completing
missions in various countries in Eastern Africa.

NNS081003-02. Carl Vinson Sailors Enriched by IA Deployment Aboard Mercy

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Kristan Robertson, USS Carl
Vinson Public Affairs

NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (NNS) -- Two Sailors from USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70)
returned Sept. 26 from a 150-day individual augmentee (IA) assignment on
board USNS Mercy (T-AH 19) as part of Pacific Partnership 2008.

Seaman Andrew Kipfer of 2nd Division Deck department and Seaman Michael
Pryor of 1st Division Deck department, deployed with Mercy May 1, to
support its mission of providing aid and relief to foreign countries.

The goal was to help strengthen relations in Southeast Asia and Oceania
by making port visits to Nha Trang, Vietnam; Chuuck, Micronesia; Port
Moresby, Papua New Guinea; Cotabato, Philippines; and the Southeast
Asian country of East Timor, among others.&quot;It was a good experience,&quot;said Pryor.&quot;There are a lot of people in
those regions that need help, because they don&apos;t always have the
facilities or money to get treated.&quot;Surgeries ranging from separating webbed fingers to tumor removal as
well as general medical care were offered to those in need.

Medical personnel from Canada, New Zealand, Singapore, Japan, Chile,
Australia and the Republic of Korea, joined the U.S. military on this
mission of compassion.

Kipfer said he also received stitches from a Japanese medic after
accidentally cutting himself in the scullery on board.&quot;With everyone coming together for the same mission and helping others
out, I feel like it&apos;s a great way to help gain allies,&quot;said Kipfer.&quot;What better way to do that?&quot;Pryor and Kipfer were sent as food service attendants (FSA), but they
didn&apos;t stop there. They also helped out at the patient clinics by taking
vital signs and organizing the crowds of people that came for treatment.

With long 15-hour workdays and the deployment coming to an end, both
Kipfer and Pryor are relieved to be back at work here on Carl Vinson,
where they will work toward the ship&apos;s Complete Crew Move Aboard goal.
They both, however, agree they are glad to have had the experience
firsthand to understand what our Navy is doing for others.&quot;One team, one fight doesn&apos;t just apply to the Navy,&quot;said Pryor.&quot;It
applies to everybody and other countries, and I got to see that for myself.&quot;For more news from USS Carl Vinson, visit www.navy.mil/local/cvn70/.

NNS081003-03. NAVSEA&apos;s Top Management Attention Program Solves Ship
Maintenance Issues&gt;From Naval Sea Systems Command Public Affairs

BILOXI, Miss. (NNS) -- Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) engineers
explained a program for addressing the fleet&apos;s most critical maintenance
problems Sept. 24 at the Marine Machinery Association annual meeting in
Biloxi.

Doyle R. Kitchin, director of NAVSEA&apos;s Fleet Readiness Engineering
Office, discussed the Navy&apos;s Top Management Attention (TMA) Program at
the conference, themed&quot;Reducing Shipbuilding Costs.&quot;The program focuses on logistics, human performance, equipment and tools
for solving ship maintenance and technical issues to improve fleet
material readiness and operational availability,&quot;said Kitchin.

Established in 1996, TMA is managed by the U.S. Fleet Forces Command
Fleet Maintenance Office in Norfolk, and administered by NAVSEA in
Washington, D.C.

The TMA team addresses problems only when they can&apos;t be resolved at a
lower level. Following the Fleet Material Readiness Improvement Process,
the team identifies and prioritizes problems, then analyzes to determine
the problem&apos;s root cause in order to identify the best solution,
followed by implementing the solution and tracking results. Once the TMA
team identifies a solution, action is taken by the appropriate
organization responsible for implementation and tracking.

He also described the different TMA&quot;umbrella&quot;programs tasked with
exploring, testing and implementing solutions and cited several success
stories. Successes include TMA&apos;s Shipboard Energy Conservation Program,
which calls for the installation of stern flaps, designed to reduce drag
and fuel consumption. This initiative is expected to deliver annual cost
avoidance of approximately $700,000 per ship each year for amphibious
assault ships and dock landing ships.

Kitchin also discussed initiatives being tracked by the Navy&apos;s Reduction
of Cumbersome Work Practices Task Force, including a coatings program
which uses new highly durable, fast-drying, high-build paints. The new
coatings last longer than previous paints and can be applied in one coat
rather than the three coats needed for the other paints, resulting in
substantial time and labor savings.&quot;In fleet maintenance terms, TMA is like the appellate court,&quot;explained
Kitchin,&quot;These are issues that directly impact our ability to perform
mission essential tasks. They require the expertise, authority and
coordination of those at the top to address them properly and quickly.
In some cases, the solution involves altering or replacing a
long-standing process. Only top Navy leaders can mandate that sort of
change.&quot;For more news from Naval Sea Systems Command, visit

NNS081003-04. New Shipboard Insulation Expected to Save Time and Money&gt;From Naval Sea Systems Command Public Affairs

WASHINGTON (NNS) -- Naval Sea Systems Command&apos;s (NAVSEA&apos;s) Engineering
for Reduced Maintenance (ERM) team outlined Sept. 29 a new thermal
barrier materials initiative designed to reduce maintenance expenses,
improve shipboard quality of life and reduce shipboard weight.

ERM is part of NAVSEA&apos;s Naval Systems Engineering Directorate team which
seeks to streamline costly and time-consuming maintenance procedures in
the fleet.

Thermal barriers, the insulation on high temperature pipes and
equipment, protect Sailors from serious burns and keep heat from
dissipating, improving operational efficiency. Current insulation,
commonly called&quot;lagging,&quot;consists of up to six inches of a heavy,
mortar-like, calcium silicate compound encased in fiberglass cloth. The
brittle material damages easily, especially in high traffic spaces, and
creates dust and other debris as it deteriorates. Replacing the
insulation is messy and labor-intensive.

One of the new materials, said Vernon Parrish, Program Coordinator for
NAVSEA&apos;s Engineering for Reduced Maintenance (ERM) Program, is high
temperature densified polyimides, pre-formed rigid foam installed in a
two-piece,&quot;clam shell&quot;sections and encased in fiberglass cloth.&quot;The polyimides are easy to install, create no dust and last more than
twice as long as current materials,&quot;said Parrish.

The new insulation, he added, was tested, installed and evaluated by the
Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division Ship Systems
Engineering Station, a NAVSEA field activity.

Citing data gathered after the June installation of high temperature
polyimides on the guided missile destroyer USS Mahan (DDG-72), Parrish
projected annual maintenance savings of $5,000 per ship over 10 years.
Installing the new materials throughout the fleet could save $1.3
million over 10 years.

The thermal barrier initiative is one of several programs overseen by
ERM. The program explores ways to reduce shipboard material and
equipment breakdowns by introducing commercially available products and
technologies to the fleet or by re-engineering existing components for
greater durability and efficiency.&quot;We see this initiative as a real success story,&quot;Parrish added, noting
that fleetwide installation of the new materials is expected to start in
fiscal year 2009.&quot;Anytime we can significantly reduce the tedious,
time-consuming tasks Sailors have to perform, we know we are helping
them focus on the main task at hand.&quot;For more news from Naval Sea Systems Command, visit

NNS081003-01. Inaugural Civil Affairs Military Operation Exercise
Launched in San Diego

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class (SW) Daniel Barker, Fleet
Public Affairs Center, Pacific

SAN DIEGO (NNS) -- Personnel from Maritime Civil Affairs Squadron (MCAS)
1 conducted their first training exercise Sept. 30-Oct. 1 aboard Naval
Amphibious Base Coronado and in the surrounding San Diego area.

The exercise was designed to develop the capability to deploy a Civil
Military Operations Center (CMOC).

A CMOC is an organization primarily made up of civil affairs personnel
to plan and facilitate the coordination of civil-military operations
involving U.S. military assets and host nation personnel and
institutions in order to achieve unity of effort in support to the joint
force commander.&quot;Being a new command, this exercise is the first opportunity for the
staff element and the command element to work together,&quot;said Cmdr. Alan
Marblestone, commanding officer of MCAS-1.&quot;We will work with
nongovernmental organizations, United Nations representatives and
multinational partners; and this training enables us to use our military
for a positive benefit, to interact with the host nation.&quot;Marblestone said civil affairs commands give the Navy the ability to
coordinate efforts between organizations.

For this training exercise, the Sailors enacted a role-playing scenario
in which they set up a tent campsite to be a mobile command center in
Kenya, and had some Sailors acting as members of nongovernmental
organizations or UN representatives.&quot;We&apos;ve been working on this since April,&quot;said Marblestone.&quot;It&apos;s a very
important element that we bring to the Navy. For the West Coast this is
our first CMOC exercise, and to be part of this is really a privilege.&quot;According to their mission guidelines, the Maritime Civil Affairs Team
(MCAT) is the basic tactical unit used to conduct civil affairs
operations and consists of five C&apos;s: OIC , coxswains, constructionmen,
communications and corpsmen. Missions include aid in times of natural or
man-made disasters and regional engagement activities intended to build
support for the U.S. government.&quot;The exercise is designed to train our staff and personnel to pack up
their gear and go out wherever they are ordered to go and conduct a CMOC
operation, a coordinating center between NGOs and other civilians with
military to provide humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and other
kinds of civil affairs functions,&quot;said Chief Hospital Corpsman (FMF)
Kevin C. Avila, team chief of MCAT 101.&quot;This physical training is more
than what just sitting in a classroom could do.&quot;MCAS-1 is based in Imperial Beach, Calif., and is part of Navy
Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC), a global force provider of adaptive
force packages of expeditionary capabilities to joint war fighting
commanders.

NNS081003-11. Carter Hall Readies for Fall PFA

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (AW/SW) Flordeliz Valerio,
Iwo Jima Expeditionary Strike Group Public Affairs

USS CARTER HALL, At Sea (NNS) -- As the fall Physical Fitness Assessment
(PFA) approaches, the chain of command aboard the amphibious dock
landing ship USS Carter Hall (LSD 50) is providing a means for their
Sailors and Marines to achieve their physical fitness goals while deployed.

Carter Hall incorporated command physical training (PT) into the ship&apos;s
daily schedule. This allows Sailors and Marines to break away from their
normal working hours to exercise, with the goal of improving the entire
command&apos;s physical readiness.&quot;As service members, staying healthy and ready makes us better assets
while we perform our jobs,&quot;said Carter Hall&apos;s Command Master Chief Don
Ouellette.

Physical readiness training is a complete conditioning program. It is
designed to reduce excess body fat; develop and maintain flexibility;
and improve cardiovascular and respiratory endurance, muscular strength,
and the stamina needed to perform routine and emergency tasks.&quot;The primary goal of this program is to help the ship&apos;s crew keep up
with the Navy&apos;s physical standards as well as become better fit and
healthier,&quot;said Ensign Richard Escamilla, Carter Hall&apos;s command fitness
leader (CFL).

To help Sailors remain enthusiastic about PT, Carter Hall purchased new
exercise machines and strategically placed them throughout the ship so
they would be more convenient for the Sailors and Marines to use.&quot;We bought new treadmills, elliptical trainers, stationary bikes and
punching bags, and made them available in various areas of the ship to
help the crew get fit,&quot;said Ouellette.&quot;Hopefully, this will encourage
the crew to keep up and succeed with their fitness goals.&quot;Pull up bars, dip bars and sit-up stations have also been installed on
weather decks, adding to the variety of exercises the crew can perform.

Quartermaster 2nd Class (SW) Angela Everett, navigation department CFL,
feels the command PT program gives Sailors and Marines the flexibility
to exercise more frequently, which promotes a healthier lifestyle for
everyone on board.&quot;With the mission areas that we are in, we must be physically fit and
mentally ready,&quot;said Everett.&quot;With the command PT program combined
with good eating habits, the crew can perform their jobs to the utmost
of their abilities.&quot;CFLs aboard Carter Hall track individual progress, giving assessments of
each Sailor&apos;s or Marine&apos;s areas of improvement in order to attain a
satisfactory score for the fall PFA and achieve an overall healthy
lifestyle.

Carter Hall is deployed as part of the Iwo Jima Expeditionary Strike
Group supporting maritime security operations (MSO) in the U.S. Navy&apos;s
5th Fleet area of operations. MSOs help develop security in the maritime
environment. From security arises stability that results in global
economic prosperity. MSO complements the counterterrorism and security
efforts of regional nations and seek to disrupt violent extremists&apos; use
of the maritime environment as a venue for attack or to transport
personnel, weapons or other material.

NNS081003-10. Chief of Chaplains visits Naval Base Guam

By Oyaol Ngirairikl, U.S. Naval Forces Marianas Public Affairs

SANTA RITA, GUAM (NNS) -- During a three-day visit to Guam, the Chief of
Navy Chaplains talked to local chaplains and religious specialists about
a plan to better support the fleet, family and Sailors.

As Chief of Navy Chaplains, Rear Adm. Robert F. Burt oversees more than
850 active duty and 250 reserve component chaplains world wide.

Burt toured U.S. Naval Base Guam, visiting commands such as Commander
Submarine Squadron (COMSUBRON) 15, Sept. 25. Burt said he was impressed
with the dedication of all Sailors on Guam who live and serve the nation&quot;at the tip of the spear.&quot;&quot;The Sailors that serve on Guam are serving at the forefront of our
nation&apos;s defense,&quot;he said.&quot;And the community here has been wonderfully
supportive of the Sailors, and the chaplains and religious specialists
are doing a wonderful job I think of also working with our Sailors.&quot;Burt noted that chaplains provide four duties, which help fulfill the
Navy&apos;s Strategic Plan for Religious Ministries, which aims to help
chaplain&apos;s better support mission readiness:&quot;First, fulfill the religious ministry needs of those served by striving
to understand and articulate the current and future needs of the
individuals and communities served.&quot;Second, create a healthy active duty and reserve CHC community by
understanding the full range of current and future manpower issues.&quot;Third, measure and report performance in a transparent manner by
developing meaningful measures and metrics; and lst communicate CHC
value to all stakeholders by clearly and thoughtfully communicating its
value in a manner meaningful to each of the communities it serves.&quot;The plan is one of the steps that the chaplains corps is taking to help
meet the changing needs of Sailors, Marines and Coastguardsmen.&quot;Our vision is to have mission-ready Sailors, Marines, Coastguardsmen
and their families demonstrating spiritual, moral and ethical maturity,
supported by innovative delivery of religious ministry and compassionate
pastoral care,&quot;Burt said.

Vinson Public Affairs

NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (NNS) -- While USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) Sailors focus
on buffering the yarded aircraft carrier back into shape, the crew has
still managed to find a moment to support the Hampton Roads community
with its 2008/2009 school partnership program.&quot;Gold Eagle&quot;Sailors have had the opportunity to keep in tune with the
school&apos;s needs, as this makes the third year in a row crewmembers have
participated in the program with two Newport News Middle schools, and
the second year with a Virginia Beach Elementary school.&quot;It has been a privilege to work with the Vinson crew during the past
couple of years,&quot;said Dr. Victor Guisao, Gildersleeve Middle School&apos;s
8th Grade assistant principal.&quot;We look forward to strengthen our
partnership even more this year and enhancing the &apos;kiddies&apos; knowledge
about the Navy&apos;s mission and lifestyle.&quot;Crew members visited Gildersleeve and Hines Middle schools in September
when the school partnership kicked-off, and the Sailors are on schedule
to pick up from last year&apos;s program with Diamond Springs Elementary
School at the end of October.&quot;The objective of this program is to develop a positive relationship
with the local community and to help students better understand Navy
life,&quot;said Lt. Cmdr. Glenda Jennings Harrison, Carl Vinson&apos;s principal
assistant chaplain.&quot;We are providing a positive image in talking to the
children about our experiences and serving as role models as we
emphasize volunteerism and after-school tutoring programs in support of
the CNO&apos;s diversity message. In light of the crew&apos;s involvement with
CCMA and many other activities planned, so far we have had a positive
amount of support from our Sailors.&quot;More than 12 Sailors have showed their motivation in the two-week time
span of jolting the program into gear, and quite a few have demonstrated
interest in continuing their volunteerism for upcoming events.&quot;I enjoyed helping the children and talking with them not only about my
experiences, but their own,&quot;said Ship&apos;s Serviceman 3rd Class Tawana
Wright from Vinson&apos;s Supply department.&quot;I would definitely like to come
back in October to see how the children have progressed since the last
time we visited. The attendees have really showed a passion in informing
Hampton Roads&apos; citizens that Sailors will still take time to help the
future of America.&quot;For more news from USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70), visit

NNS081003-05. Carl Vinson Shows Support During Newport News Angel Food
Distribution

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SW) Maja A. Dyson, USS Carl
Vinson Public Affairs

NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (NNS) -- USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) Sailors gathered
Sept. 27, at Mercy and Truth Ministries in Newport News, to assist the
local church community in their Angel Food distribution.

Sailors, 13 in all, helped the church allocate about 223 units of food
to citizens in need.

Angel Food Distribution is a non-denominational organization formed in
1994, to provide grocery relief and financial support to communities
throughout the United States. The program has grown to serve thousands
of families every month across 17 states, including Virginia.&quot;When our church began taking part in the Angel Food Distribution
program we started off with issuing 13 units,&quot;said Mercy and Truth
Ministries Pastor Eric Miller.&quot;Now we have worked our way up to 223
units each month since we started back in January 2008.&quot;Each unit is a box of groceries sold for $30 in a quantity that can fit
in a medium-sized box and designed to feed a family of four.&quot;The great thing about this program is it&apos;s a beautiful way to reach out
to the community, and anyone with $30 can participate,&quot;agreed Miller
and his wife, Johniene, the senior coordinator for the church&apos;s Angel
Food distribution program.&quot;We are able to feed the natural part of man
while feeding the spiritual part as well and address the day-to-day
needs of a family by easing their load in providing fresh produce at a
cost-effective price.&quot;This is the second month Sailors volunteered at the church.&quot;This is my first time coming out to this event, but myself and the
Sailors here are pleased to know we could make a difference in the
community,&quot;said Senior Chief Aviation Boatswain&apos;s Mate Equipment
(AW/SW) Kemmy Frazier, V-2 division maintenance leading chief petty
officer.&quot;Angel Food distribution is a great program that could provide
anyone with assistance who is need of some extra food for the month.&quot;&quot;This is an awesome community relations project our Sailors participated
in,&quot;said Lt. j.g. (Chaplain) Marlin Williams, Religious Ministries
department&apos;s divisional officer.&quot;It&apos;s a great opportunity for our
Sailors to not only assist the local community during this economically
challenging time, but to also educate our own on different ways to
receive food assistance.&quot;For more news from USS Carl Vinson, visit www.navy.mil/local/cvn70/.

NNS081003-06. Injured Veterans Attend National Summer Sport Clinic

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class (SW) Jon Husman

Fleet Public Affairs Center, Pacific

SAN DIEGO (NNS) -- More than 50 wounded veterans from around the country
participated in the first National Summer Sports Clinic held in San
Diego, Sept. 28 through Oct. 3.

The National Summer Sports Clinic is hosted by the Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA) San Diego Healthcare System and is comprised of
five events: track and field, cycling, sailing, adaptive surfing and
kayaking.

According to Ben Brown, Navy veteran participant, programs like the
Summer Sports Clinic have helped many veterans with injuries heal and
gain confidence to pursue their ambitions.&quot;I think the National Summer Sports Clinic is an excellent tool to
educate and show the veterans the possibilities and the vast amount of
sports that we can get into and participate in,&quot;said Brown.&quot;It&apos;s
great. It opens up all kinds of doors and gets you active again.&quot;The event is open to newly injured veterans who have spinal cord
injuries, traumatic brain injuries, certain neurological conditions,
amputations, other mobility impairments, or post-traumatic stress disorder.&quot;For me personally it&apos;s so rewarding because I chose the path as a young
man that didn&apos;t involve the services,&quot;said Van Curaza, a clinic
volunteer surf instructor.&quot;To be able to give back to the guys that
have giving so much sacrifice and for the people out there that are
making the sacrifices, it&apos;s really rewarding for me to be able to help
someone surf and overcome and find new goals in their life. It&apos;s priceless.&quot;The VA is a recognized leader in rehabilitation, with therapeutic
programs available at VA health care facilities across the nation.&quot;The Summer Sports Clinic is unique from the other national programs,&quot;said David Tostenrude, cycling venue coordinator.&quot;We&apos;re really focused
on not only getting the veterans active but providing them with the
education to be able to continue these activities at home.&quot;According to Tostenrude, the sports clinic is the fifth national
rehabilitation event offered by the VA to promote the healing of body,
mind and spirit. VA&apos;s other rehabilitation events are the National
Disabled Veterans Winter Sports Clinic, the National Veteran Wheelchair
Games, and the National Veteran Creative Arts Festival.

NNS081001-20. Chief of Naval Operations Sends Birthday Message to Fleet

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SW) Rebekah Blowers, Chief
of Naval Operations Public Affairs


WASHINGTON (NNS) -- The Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) sent a video
message to the fleet in honor of the Navy&apos;s birthday.&quot;This year our Navy celebrates our 233rd birthday. Two hundred and
thirty-three years of great service to our nation. As we observe this
day, I thank all of our Sailors and civilians for their service, and I
thank our Navy families for all of their support,&quot;Adm. Gary Roughead,
CNO, said.

Since the Navy&apos;s inception in 1775, CNO said the values that the Navy
holds were built upon by the capability and versatility of Sailors. The
Navy today is conducting the maritime strategy, operates across the full
spectrum of warfare and is known as much for its compassion as for its
capability.&quot;We return peace and stability after conflict, and in the wake of
devastating disasters, our Navy team brings food, shelter and medical
care for those in need. Sailors, civilians and our families who support
us are making the world a better place,&quot;Roughead said.

CNO emphasized his pride in the selfless commitment of the Navy team
that is continuing the legacy of those who have gone before and will
serve as an inspiration for years to come.

NNS081004-18. Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group Arrives in Cape
Town, South Africa

By Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class (AW/SW) Monique K. Hilley

USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT (NNS) -- Ships from the Theodore Roosevelt
Carrier Strike Group (TR CSG), assigned to U.S. Naval Forces
Europe-Africa, have arrived in Cape Town, South Africa, as part of an
on-going effort to reinforce relationships, increase interoperability
and address maritime issues.

The aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN 71) anchored off the
coast of Cape Town, South Africa, Oct. 4. The cruiser USS Monterey (CG
61) is pier side in Cape Town after arriving Oct. 3.

The TR CSG ships are scheduled to host formal visits, regional security
cooperative activities, military-to-military exchanges, and participate
in a variety of community relations activities. Senior officers from the
ships will also conduct office calls with South African government and
military leaders to discuss maritime safety and security.&quot;The South African government has invited us to visit Cape Town, and we
are grateful for the opportunity,&quot;said Rear Adm. Frank Pandolfe,
commander of the Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group.&quot;We look
forward to strengthening the relationship with the South African Navy.&quot;During the port visit, crewmembers will have the chance to enjoy the
culture and beauty of Cape Town, participate in a wide variety of
community relations projects and tour some of the surrounding areas. In
total, more than 4,600 Sailors will visit Cape Town.&quot;We appreciate the opportunity to be here in Cape Town as
representatives of the American people,&quot;said Capt. Ladd Wheeler,
commanding officer of USS Theodore Roosevelt.&quot;Getting the chance to
learn about and interact with different militaries and cultures is an
invaluable experience for our Sailors.&quot;The TR visit to Cape Town marks the first time a carrier has visited
South Africa in more than 40 years. The last carrier to visit South
Africa was USS Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1967.

Sailors aboard TR are looking forward to the new experiences they will
get to enjoy during visit to Cape Town.&quot;I&apos;m really excited to be able to get off the boat and see things I
haven&apos;t seen before and eat something exotic,&quot;said Aviation Boatswain&apos;s
Mate (Equipment) Airman Cherry Ravnell, a member of the V-2 division of
TR&apos;s air department.

Other Sailors are highly anticipating the opportunities they will have
to interact with a different culture and increase their knowledge about
another part of the world.&quot;I&apos;m very fortunate for the opportunity to see different cultures,
including the way they live and their customs and traditions. This is my
third cruise, but this is definitely something new. It adds another
piece to my puzzle of the world, and I&apos;m glad that I&apos;ve been blessed
with the chance to experience it,&quot;said Culinary Specialist Second Class
John Davis, one of the many chefs that make up S-2 division of TR&apos;s
supply department.

The Sailors of Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group who are currently
visiting Cape Town are grateful for the once-in-a-lifetime experience
they are getting during this historic port visit in Cape Town, South
Africa.

NNS081005-03. Partner Nations Working as Partners in Health Care

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Gina Wollman, Continuing
Promise 2008 Public Affairs

LOS CALDERAS, Dominican Republic (NNS) -- Medical personnel embarked
aboard USS Kearsarge (LHD 3) worked alongside Dominican Republic Armed
Forces Oct. 4 to provide a variety medical services to the community of
Los Calderas as part of the humanitarian/civic assistance mission
Continuing Promise (CP) 2008.

CP 2008 is a collaborative effort between the United States and partner
militaries, nongovernmental organizations (NGO) and partner-nation
support organizations to build strong partnerships that can be called
upon in the event of a regional situation requiring cooperative solutions.

Local residents were offered various types of medical exams and
treatment from both Kearsarge and host nation medical teams. Specialists
were also available to aid patients who required additional care.&quot;We have six specialists on staff today,&quot;said Air Force Maj. Judy
Martell.&quot;The host nation provided us with a pediatrician, a
gynecologist and an orthopedic doctor, and from the Kearsarge we have an
optometrist, dermatologist and a nephrologist.&quot;Medical personnel from the Dominican Republic and its Armed Forces said
they felt privileged to be working alongside the joint medical staff
from Kearsarge.
Dr. Emilton Lopes, a private practice doctor from Los Calderas, said it
was very interesting to see so many people come together for the same cause.&quot;The people here love to see others come in to help,&quot;he said.&quot;It shows
them that they are cared for, and when the locals see us working
together, it shows a great brotherhood.&quot;Linda Hall Rothery from Project Hope was equally excited and very
appreciative for all of the help they received from the host nation.&quot;They have been extremely informative and helpful to us,&quot;she said.&quot;You
can tell they have the knowledge and desire to help their people; I am
so grateful for the opportunity to work with them.&quot;After the first day of medical care, more than 415 patients were seen
and more than 650 prescriptions were filled.&quot;The cooperation and the partnership that we have experienced today
working with the host nation was remarkable,&quot;said Lt. Cmdr. Kathaleen
Sikes.&quot;The more we work together as a team, the more patients we can
see and more people are helped. That is the whole reason for this mission.&quot;Medical Personnel currently embarked aboard Kearsarge for CP 2008
include personnel from all the services and Armed Forces medical
personnel from Brazil, Canada, France and The Netherlands as well as
NGOs Project HOPE and International Aid.

When Kearsarge departs the Dominican Republic, they will move forward
with the Continuing Promise mission to Trinidad and Tobago.

Kearsarge&apos;s mission exemplifies the United States maritime strategy
which emphasizes deploying forces to build confidence and trust among
nations through collective maritime security efforts that focus on
common threats and mutual interest.

USS Kearsarge is under the operational control of U.S. 4th Fleet.

U.S. 4th Fleet&apos;s mission is to direct United States naval forces
operating in the Caribbean, and Central and South American regions and
interact with partner nation navies to shape maritime environment.

The Continuing Promise Caribbean Phase is the second of two HCA
deployments to the Southern Command area of focus for 2008. The first
Continuing Promise deployment was conducted by USS Boxer (LHD 4) in the
Pacific.

NNS081006-07. U.S. Navy Charters Kite-Powered Cargo Ship&gt;From Military Sealift Command Public Affairs

NEWPORT, Wales (NNS) -- For the first time, the U.S. Navy&apos;s Military
Sealift Command (MSC) has chartered a kite-assisted, fuel-saving cargo
ship to carry military equipment.

MV Beluga SkySails departed Newport, Wales, Oct. 5 after the first of
three European port calls to load U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force cargo
before the ship&apos;s month-long voyage to the United States.

The 400-foot Beluga SkySails is the world&apos;s first cargo ship to use a
sky sail  a giant, computer-controlled kite that can rise 100 yards
into the air and uses wind power to help propel the ship during long
ocean transits. Though MSC frequently charters commercial ships to meet
mission requirements, this is the first time the command has chartered
such a ship.

The ship operating company estimates that the sky sail can reduce fuel
costs 20-30 percent, or roughly $1,600 per day.

Though Beluga SkySails&apos; wind power was not a factor in awarding the
contract, the ship operating company was likely&quot;able to capitalize on
fuel savings to make its offer more competitive,&quot;said MSC contracting
officer Kenneth Allen.&quot;MSC values innovation that leads to cost savings,&quot;said Navy Capt. Nick
Holman, commander of Sealift Logistics Command Europe, MSC&apos;s area
command for Europe and Africa.&quot;We are proud to be collaborating with
innovators in the commercial maritime world to provide our customers
with efficient and quality service.&quot;MSC operates approximately 110 noncombatant, civilian-crewed ships that
replenish U.S. Navy ships, conduct specialized missions, strategically
preposition combat cargo at sea around the world and move military cargo
and supplies used by deployed U.S. forces and coalition partners.

NNS081004-02. Sailors in Guam Checking Out New Uniforms

By Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class (SW) Jeffery Tilghman
Williams, U.S. Naval Forces Marianas Public Affairs

SANTA RITA, Guam (NNS) -- People around U.S. Naval Base Guam (NBG) have
noticed that Sailors are switching to the Navy&apos;s new uniform that took
effect July 31.

Service uniform sales began July 31, at Navy Exchange uniform shops in
Great Lakes and California, and aren&apos;t scheduled to arrive in Guam until
April 2010. But that fact hasn&apos;t stopped Sailors here from taking the
initiative to order them or piece them together themselves.&quot;I think the new uniforms are great! I definitely prefer them over the
working whites and the working blues, because they are comfortable and
easy to manage,&quot;said Yeoman 2nd Class Daniel Trierwiler.

The new look is also more functional according to some.&quot;This is the most comfortable uniform I have. The fit is great, and it&apos;s
functional,&quot;said Operation Specialist 1st Class (SW) Abraham Haradji,
who has been wearing the new uniform since its launch date.

Sailors have up to 22 months to purchase the new uniform, depending on
their duty station location. The mandatory wear date for all E1-E6
personnel is July 2010. Clothing replacement allowances for fiscal years
2008 and 2009 were increased to cover the purchasing of two sets of new
uniforms by July 2010.

The service uniform will be available for purchase via Navy Exchange
uniform centers as follows:

 October 2008, Northwest and Hawaii

 January 2009, Gulf region and Millington, Tenn

 April 2009, Naval District Washington

 July 2009, Tidewater

 Oct 2009, Southeast

 Jan 2010, Northeast

Kearsarge Sailors will work with embarked Air Force civil engineers and
Navy Seabees to construct a new playground for the community&apos;s
elementary school.&quot;The residents gave us a warm reception when we landed outside the town
this morning,&quot;said Aviation Electrician&apos;s Mate 1st Class Daniel Horn.&quot;When local children gathered around us with parents and fellow
neighbors cheering our arrival, I felt good about being part of this.&quot;The ship&apos;s COMREL team was welcomed into the homes of some of the
residents and invited to play a friendly game soccer with the children
while awaiting transportation to the project site.&quot;The great part about being involved with COMRELs is getting out and
meeting the people,&quot;said Information Systems Technician 1st Class Randy
Lambert, who became a big hit with the local children when he shared the
candy from his lunch.&quot;We may be out here to dig a few holes and hammer
a few nails, but we also need to show these folks America cares about them.&quot;Sailors were able to walk around the local town near the school and get
a feel for the people who lived there. One local woman even treated them
to cold drinks and cookies as a thank you for coming to the community.&quot;The townspeople were very accommodating,&quot;said Information Systems
Technician 2nd Class Lakisha Johnson.&quot;I felt at home; this is a
wonderful town, and I am proud to be of service to their community.&quot;Kearsarge&apos;s CP mission is to conduct civil-military operations including
humanitarian and civic assistance as well as veterinary, medical, dental
and civil engineering support to six partner nations and to send a
strong message of U.S. compassion, support and commitment to Central and
South America and the Caribbean.

USS Kearsarge is under the operational control of U.S. 4th Fleet. U.S.
4th Fleet&apos;s mission is to direct United States naval forces operating in
the Caribbean and Central and South American regions and interact with

NNS081006-06. Sasebo Runs to Break Silence, Cycle of Violence

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SW) Joshua J. Wahl, Fleet
Public Affairs Center Det. Sasebo, Japans

SASEBO, Japan (NNS) -- More than 100 runners gathered at Fleet
Activities Sasebo (CFAS) Oct. 3, for a 3k/5k run sponsored by the Fleet
and Family Support Center (FFSC) in an effort to raise awareness about
domestic violence.

The run marked Domestic Violence Awareness Month and combined efforts of
the FFSC and the Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) center in their&quot;Break the Silence, Break the Cycle&quot;campaign recognizing the harmful
effects of domestic violence.

Sailors and family members from Task Force 76, CFAS and a several Japan
Ground Self Defense Force participants toed the starting line for the event.&quot;It is great to see so many people come out and support breaking the
silence from this crime that has remained hidden for so many years,&quot;said Capt. Francis X. Martin, Commander, Fleet Activities Sasebo.&quot;It
really shows the kind of community we have here in Sasebo.&quot;Tamaya Carter, FFSC domestic violence coordinator and official starter
for the race, delivered the opening address.&quot;Despite what many people believe, domestic violence is not an abuser&apos;s
loss of control over his or her behavior, but a choice made by the
abuser to take control over their victim,&quot;said Carter.&quot;We want
everybody to know what this abuse involves and how to recognize it, so
we can protect victims from further harm.&quot;After the final runners crossed the finish line, participants enjoyed
healthy snacks.&quot;I did the run because I knew it would be fun and because it was a good
cause,&quot;said Personnel Specialist 2nd Class Luther Bellase from New
York.&quot;It was great that the FFSC could hold this run. I hope with
everybody coming out here today we can really do some good to diffuse
problems before they get worse.&quot;For more news from Commander Fleet Activities Sasebo, visit

NNS081006-04. TACRON 22 Supports Iwo Jima ESG Amphibious Operations

By Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Chad R. Erdmann, Iwo Jima
Expeditionary Strike Group Public Affairs

USS IWO JIMA, At Sea (NNS) -- A detachment of air traffic controllers,
operation specialists and six officers from Tactical Air Control
Squadron (TACRON) 22 are embarked aboard the multipurpose amphibious
assault ship USS Iwo Jima (LHD 7) as part of the Iwo Jima Expeditionary
Strike Group (ESG).

The squadron, based out of Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek, Virginia
Beach, Va., sent a detachment of 27 personnel to support air operations
for the ESG and embarked 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit (26 MEU). The
detachment, which joined the ESG in August, coordinates all air
operations in support of amphibious forces within the ESG.&quot;We provide real-time information on the status of Iwo Jima ESG and 26
MEU aircraft on our ships and compile it to one master air plan,&quot;said
Air Traffic Controller 1st Class Garrison Nelson, assistant leading
petty officer.&quot;We ensure that all the aircraft are where they need to be when they
need to be there, to include ensuring all passengers, mail and cargo are
correctly delivered throughout the strike group.&quot;The TACRON&apos;s tactical air control center (TACC) provides centralized
control, coordination and integration of amphibious air operations and
training while their planning cell integrates ESG air operations with
both fleet and theater commanders. The detachment controls a range of
air support to conduct missions in support of Maritime Security
Operations (MSO).&quot;We support a number of missions -- from surface surveillance and escort
missions to dedicated search and rescue missions,&quot;said Cmdr. Steven
Francis, executive officer for TACRON 22.&quot;Our air support provides a
very flexible range of capabilities to the on-scene commander.&quot;The TACRON detachment has a Marine Integration Team (MIT) as well, which
is used to supplement the Marine&apos;s expeditionary air traffic control team.&quot;The MIT may have to take over an airfield or even build a temporary
airfield for helicopters and C-130&apos;s to land and takeoff,&quot;said Chief
Air Traffic Controller Jamey McFarland, TACC leading chief petty
officer.&quot;It is essential for the Marines to have an airborne logistics
area.&quot;TACRON also assumes the duties of search and rescue (SAR) coordinator.
They ensure synchronized efforts within the ESG, the medical department,
as well as with outside agencies such as international search-and-rescue
coordination centers, foreign airfields and embassies.&quot;TACRON&apos;s role in SAR missions range from coordinating air support to
actually controlling the aircraft conducting the search and rescue
missions,&quot;said Francis.&quot;Our detachment consists of personnel from a
variety of aviation and maritime experience who provide the diversity of
expertise needed to accomplish the complex air planning, coordination
and control means necessary for amphibious air operations.&quot;The TACRON 22 detachment is deployed as part of the Iwo Jima
Expeditionary Strike Group supporting MSO in the U.S. Navy&apos;s 5th Fleet
area of operations. MSO help develop security in the maritime
environment. From security arises stability that results in global
economic prosperity. MSO complements the counterterrorism and security
efforts of regional nations and seek to disrupt violent extremists&apos; use
of the maritime environment as a venue for attack or to transport
personnel, weapons or other material.

During the RAS, a master chief, senior chief and two chiefs assumed deck
watches on the bridge. The four senior enlisted leaders acted as officer
of the deck (OOD), junior officer of the deck (JOOD), conning officer
and junior officer of the deck under instruction for the major shipboard
evolution.&quot;For the first time in a long time, we had an all-enlisted watch crew,&quot;said Master Chief Quartermaster (SW/AW) Brian Schlicht, OOD.&quot;Traditionally, the deck watches are stood by junior officers - ensigns
and lieutenants junior grade.&quot;The watch team, or&quot;Team 789&quot;in reference to their pay grades, not only
led the ship for the underway replenishment but just as important, they
also led their Sailors.&quot;With the junior personnel, especially those on the bridge and those who
know the chiefs are working up there, they see that we&apos;re giving back,&quot;said Chief Quartermaster (SW) Jerrod Morgan, JOOD.&quot;We&apos;re standing the watches that most people think are unique to
officers only. We interact with the Sailors that are on watch and show
them the different side of not just standing their watch station, but
how it all comes together. It shows them we&apos;re part of the ship and
we&apos;re keeping enlisted traditions alive.&quot;With the high level of hands-on experience, the enlisted watch team
brought a different perspective to the evolution, said Schlicht.&quot;To take a ship [like USS Iwo Jima], with more than 1,000 Sailors and
another 1,300 Marines, and have an enlisted section running the show --
it shows our Sailors that the sky&apos;s the limit,&quot;said Commanding Officer,
Capt. Robert P. Irelan.&quot;That particular section chose to be the best,
and they are the best. I would trust them in combat. I would trust them
in an [underway replenishment], and I would trust them in amphibious
operations because they&apos;ve certainly earned my respect and confidence.&quot;Iwo Jima is deployed as part of the Iwo Jima Expeditionary Strike Group
supporting maritime security operations (MSO) in the U.S. Navy&apos;s 5th
Fleet area of operations. MSO help develop security in the maritime
environment. From security arises stability that results in global
economic prosperity. MSO complements the counterterrorism and security
efforts of regional nations and seek to disrupt violent extremists&apos; use
of the maritime environment as a venue for attack or to transport
personnel, weapons or other material.

NNS081005-04. San Antonio&apos;s Advanced Engineering Mission Readiness
Effectiveness, Efficiency

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class (SW) Brian Goodwin, Iwo Jima
Expeditionary Strike Group Public Affairs

USS SAN ANTONIO, At Sea (NNS) -- New technologies and network-based
processes are having a significant impact on USS San Antonio (LPD
17)during their first deployment as part of the USS Iwo Jima
Expeditionary Strike Group.

San Antonio engineering department&apos;s new systems are improving
efficiency and ensuring mission readiness. One of those new systems is
the Engineering Control System (ECS).&quot;The Engineering Control System is a computer-based system that provides
remote monitoring and control of the propulsion, fuel, electrical,
auxiliary, damage control and ballast systems,&quot;said Cmdr. Kurt Kastner,
San Antonio&apos;s commanding officer.

For the engineers aboard San Antonio, managing the engineering spaces
and workload is less tasking with ECS.&quot;We can have the same amount of work as all the other ships in the
fleet, but we can have less manual labor due to our engineering systems
running on remote,&quot;said Chief Warrant Officer William Rivera, San
Antonio&apos;s main propulsion officer.

ECS has also made a positive impact on engineering watch standing in the
Central Control Station.&quot;In Central Control, our watch standers can manage our water, propulsion
and five diesel generators through computers networked through the Ship
Wide Area Network, or SWAN,&quot;added Rivera.

SWAN is the first computer-run network to be the backbone of vital ship
components, such as engineering, navigation and steering.

The increased efficiency also benefits other shipboard departments. Most
departments rely on the engineering department&apos;s capabilities and
services, in one way or another, to complete their missions that support
Maritime Security Operations (MSO).&quot;The combat systems department requires Engineering&apos;s electrical
division to provide 400 Hz and electrical power to radars and missiles,&quot;said Engineman 1st Class (SW/AW) James Moss.&quot;The operations department
cannot maneuver without the immediate response and talents of the main
propulsion division providing engine plant integrity, and the auxiliary
control department provides cooling systems to vital electrical systems.&quot;San Antonio&apos;s engineers are proving to be an essential asset on the
ship&apos;s maiden deployment and have set high standards for themselves.&quot;Our engineers show great dedication and professionalism,&quot;said Hull
Maintenance Technician 1st Class (SW) Marcus White.&quot;I am looking
forward to a continued successful deployment that will set the benchmark
high for all LPD-17-class ships to follow.&quot;San Antonio is deployed to the U.S. 5th Fleet area of operations to
conduct Maritime Security Operations (MSO). MSO help develop security in
the maritime environment. From security arises stability that results in
global economic prosperity. MSO complements the counterterrorism and
security efforts of regional nations and seek to disrupt violent
extremists&apos; use of the maritime environment as a venue for attack or to
transport personnel, weapons or other material.

By Ensign Emily S. Castro, USS Boone Public Affairs Officer

MAYPORT, Fla. (NNS) -- USS Boone (FFG 28) and embarked units returned
home Oct 5 after six months deployed to the Eastern Pacific Ocean and
the Caribbean Sea.

Boone and Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron Light (HSL) 42 Detachment 2
(Det 2) of Mayport, and U.S. Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment
(LEDET) 406 of Miami, returned home to family and friends after
conducting counter-illicit trafficking operations in the U.S. Southern
Command (SOUTHCOM) area of focus, which encompasses the Caribbean,
Central and South America, and surrounding waters.

During the deployment, Boone transited through the Panama Canal four
times, intercepted 3.6 tons of illegal drugs, and rescued 50 migrants
while investigating a suspicious vessel. Boone provided the migrants
with medical care, showers, shelter, and food before returning them
safely to shore.

Boone&apos;s Commanding Officer Cmdr. Newman J. Evans, III commented that
Boone Sailors have made a difference in the SOUTHCOM area of
responsibility and said,&quot;Everyone performed superbly over the past six
months, and I am very proud of each and every Sailor on Boone.&quot;Boone took short patrol breaks in ports that allowed the crew to
experience the culture of Central and South American countries. In
Panama, Sailors had the opportunity to fish, tour native villages, surf,
and dive. Sailors also participated in a Community Relations (COMREL)
project at the Pu Malambo Orphanage in Arraijan, Panama. Boone visited
the orphanage, which shelters children infected with the AIDS Virus, and
participated in the orphanage&apos;s 118th Birthday&quot;Malambado&quot;celebration.

Boone also visited Cartagena, Colombia, and Sailors participated in
tours of old Spanish forts, uninhabited islands, and Colombian naval
vessels. Boone&apos;s Chief Petty Officer&apos;s Mess gave Project Handclasp
materials to a local orphanage. The materials included toys as well as
health and comfort items. Through Project Handclasp, a worldwide
humanitarian and goodwill program, the Navy collects donations from
various private-sector organizations and companies, and delivers them to
people in need. Also while in Colombia, Sailors participated in a
basketball game against the crew form the Colombian Navy submarine ARC
Pijao (S-28).

Boone conducted numerous training events during their deployment
including an Expendable Mobile Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Training
Target (EMATT) exercise to increase antisubmarine warfare proficiency
and improve ship and helicopter interaction. Immediately following the
EMATT, Boone&apos;s boatswain&apos;s mates, gunner&apos;s mates, and search and rescue
(SAR) swimmers conducted a successful recovery of the air-dropped
Recoverable Exercise Torpedo (REXTORP).

Boone also pulled into Puerto Quetzal, Guatemala, where Sailors had the
opportunity to tour ancient Mayan ruins and participate in volleyball,
soccer, and basketball games against Sailors from the Guatemalan Navy.

After returning to Panama several times, Boone made their final liberty
stop in Cozumel, Mexico, where the crew enjoyed the tropical climate and
clear water.

During the deployment, Boone was under operational control of U.S. Naval
Forces Southern Command (NAVSO)/U.S. 4th Fleet conducting
counter-illicit trafficking operations for Joint Interagency Task
Force-South in the SOUTHCOM area of focus. Once the ship returned to
Mayport, U.S. 2nd Fleet took over operational control.

NAVSO, the Naval Component Command of SOUTHCOM, directs U.S. Naval
Forces operating in the Caribbean, Central and South American regions
and interacts with partner nation navies within the maritime
environment. Various operations include counter-illicit trafficking,
theater security cooperation, humanitarian assistance and disaster
relief, military-to-military interaction and bilateral and multinational
training.

Anti-Submarine Squadron Light (HSL) 44 Detachment 8 returned home Oct. 5
after six-month counter-illicit trafficking deployment in the Eastern
Pacific Ocean.

The highlight of the deployment came on Sept. 13, when the crew and
embarked U.S. Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment (LEDET) 404
captured a Self Propelled Semi-Submersible (SPSS) vessel containing
seven tons of cocaine and four suspected illicit-traffickers. Throughout
their deployment, McInerney intercepted 22 tons of cocaine.

McInerney left Mayport April 4 en route to the U.S. Southern Command
area of focus, which encompasses the Caribbean, Central and South
America, and surrounding waters.

McInerney made its first port visit at the island of Roatan, Honduras.
While in Honduras, crew members conducted a community relations project
that brought fresh water to over 30 homes in La Colonia, Honduras.
Sailors also donated two pallets of Project Handclasp materials to a
local clinic. Through Project Handclasp, a worldwide humanitarian and
goodwill program, the U.S. Navy collects donations from various
private-sector organizations and companies and delivers them to people
in need.

While in Central and South America, McInerney made stops in Vasco Nunez
de Balboa, Panama; Manta, Ecuador; Salaverry, Peru; Golfito, Costa Rica;
and Ocho Rios, Jamaica.

The ship&apos;s last port visit was in Cartagena, Colombia. In preparation
for the stop, McInerney assembled an entire bridge watch team of Spanish
speakers who navigated the ship into Cartagena giving commands only in
Spanish.&quot;This was McInerney&apos;s final tribute to all the amazing people we met
throughout Central and South America over the past six months and also a
demonstration of our commitment to strong maritime ties with allies in
the region,&quot;said Commanding Officer, Cmdr. C. K. Wheeler.

In addition to the community project in Honduras, McInerney&apos;s crew
dedicated their liberty time to two other projects. While in Salaverry,
Peru, McInerney painted two large dormitory buildings for a local
orphanage, which serve as home and school for over 45 children.
McInerney Sailors also gave their time, working in conjunction with
Colombian Navy Sailors to paint and rehabilitate a local school in
Cartagena, Colombia, and donated much needed school supplies to the
school that teaches over 220 students daily.

McInerney Sailors achieved success on all levels, as a unit and
individually. During the deployment, 78 Sailors earned their Enlisted
Surface Warfare Specialists (ESWS) pins.

While deployed, McInerney was under operational control of U.S. Naval
Forces Southern Command (NAVSO) and U.S. 4th Fleet conducting counter
illicit trafficking operations for Joint Interagency Task Force-South in
the SOUTHCOM area of focus. Once the ship returned to Mayport, U.S. 2nd
Fleet took over operational control.

NNS081004-17. NMCB 7 Seabees Deploy to Support Operations Iraqi and
Enduring Freedom

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SCW) Michael B. Lavender,
Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 7 Public Affairs

AL ANBAR PROVINCE, Iraq (NNS) -- Seabees assigned to Naval Mobile
Construction Battalion (NMCB) 7 deployed Sept. 28 to U.S. Forces Central
Command to carry out construction operations in support of Operations
Enduring and Iraqi Freedom.

The battalion will be deployed to various locations throughout the
Middle East, including Iraq and Afghanistan.&quot;We will provide contingency construction to our supported commands
within our assigned areas of responsibilities,&quot;said Lt. Aaron Allison,
NMCB 7&apos;s assistant operations officer.&quot;Our primary goal is to support
the warfighter in this theater of operations with quality and timely
construction.&quot;The battalion will have seven detachment sites, each tailored and
equipped with the personnel needed to do the jobs correctly.&quot;We deal with projects of various levels of intensity and detail,&quot;explained Allison.&quot;Some of our projects include quality of life
improvements for military personnel of all U.S. branches while other
projects focus on the identified base requirements supporting coalition
forces.&quot;NMCB 7 will conduct construction operations with several projects per
detachment site, most of which will be completed prior to their return home.&quot;We are striving to complete all our projects safely and efficiently to
uphold our status as the premier engineering force among the U.S. armed
forces,&quot;said Allison.&quot;We also want to uphold the &apos;Magnificent&apos;
reputation of NMCB 7&apos;s history as a hard-charging and professional
Seabee battalion.&quot;The Seabees are expecting to work closely with coalition forces while
deployed, bringing improvements to both established bases and forward
operations bases as needed.&quot;This is a true test of our abilities as far as task tailoring project
requirements, the mobilization of personnel and equipment assets to
various job sites, and operations throughout an extensive geographical
area,&quot;said Allison.&quot;Essentially, our battalion is spread across two
combat theaters: Iraq and Afghanistan. All operations face difficulties
at times, but our extensive training executed during a demanding
homeport cycle and field training exercise has proven our readiness to
face future challenges this deployment, and to overcome them both safely
and successfully.&quot;NMCB 7 has prepared for the U.S. CENTCOM deployment since the beginning
of their homeport nine months prior.&quot;There was an ample amount of training to prepare us for this
deployment,&quot;said Construction Electrician 3rd Class (SCW) Steve
Lockman, a NMCB 7 Seabee.&quot;I know that our convoy security elements did
a lot of training throughout homeport and just prior to leaving.
Additionally, everyone in the command got the training they needed to
complete their specific mission. There was a lot of in-rate training on
top of the tactical training to help prepare us for the demands of a
project site.&quot;For more news from Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 7 visit

NNS081004-15. USS La Jolla returns from Western Pacific

By Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Cynthia Clark, Submarine
Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet Public Affairs

PEARL HARBOR (NNS) -- USS La Jolla (SSN 762) returned to Naval Station
Pearl Harbor from a six-month Western Pacific deployment, Friday, Oct. 3.&quot;We left with a lot of very high expectations and every member of the
crew was really looking forward to getting out and getting involved with
some other navies,&quot;said Cmdr. Doug Sampson, USS La Jolla commanding
officer.&quot;One of our many goals was to become experts at submarine
operations and we did that.&quot;Since departing Pearl Harbor on April 3, USS La Jolla conducted many
exercises with foreign navies and performed tasking from the Commander,
Seventh Fleet operational commander. La Jolla also visited Guam, Sasebo
and Yokosuka, Japan and Singapore.&quot;We had a great time and we made some great friends,&quot;said Sampson.&quot;We
were all very sad to leave.&quot;Of course no man does it alone, and Sampson is quick to recognize the
outstanding professionalism and work ethic of his crew.&quot;We were able to keep a 27-year-old submarine at sea and on schedule
while maintaining perfect working order, which is really a testament to
the guys that work onboard,&quot;Sampson said.

Commissioned in 1981, USS La Jolla is 360-feet long and displaces 6,900
tons. The submarine can be armed with both Mark-48 ADCAP anti-submarine
torpedoes and Tomahawk guided cruise missiles.

NNS081004-12. Naval Base Kitsap Hosts Domestic Violence Vigil

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (NAC) Jason Beckjord, Fleet
Public Affairs Center, Det. Northwest

SILVERDALE, Wash. (NNS) -- Sailors, family members and local community
members gathered to mark the beginning of October with a Silent Witness
Walk and Candlelight Vigil at Naval Base Kitsap&apos;s (NBK) Jackson Park
Sept. 30.

The Navy has designated the month of October as Domestic Violence
Awareness Month.

After a 45-minute walk around military housing in Jackson Park,
participants gathered at the chapel for a vigil around a traveling
memorial of silhouettes honoring victims of domestic violence who have
been killed by their abusers in the Kitsap County community. On each
silhouette, there was a name, age and a story of a person killed during
a domestic dispute.&quot;It&apos;s good to be aware of domestic violence because people often think
it&apos;s not going to happen to them,&quot;said Master-at-Arms 3rd Class Amanda
Edwards, NBK Security.&quot;Being informed about the warning signs, as well
as some of the horror stories, of what has happened to victims here in
the Northwest is important.&quot;The candlelight vigil began with an introduction by NBK Commanding
Officer, Capt. Mark Olson, who spoke of the Navy&apos;s involvement both past
and present in preventing, educating and stopping domestic violence.&quot;In the 1980s, the Navy realized the need for improved family support,
better family service programs and the subsequent realization that
family matters like domestic violence had to be brought out of the
darkness and fully addressed,&quot;said Olson.&quot;This walk and this vigil are
pure indicators that we here at NBK are aware of the standard to our
family life. We are educating our family members, all ranks, and we have
top-notch professional counseling available to our families.&quot;Capt T.J. Dargan, Navy Region Northwest staff, also spoke, providing
statistics as well as his insight into the nature of domestic violence
as it pertains to the military community.&quot;There are some cultural issues and risk factors for domestic violence
associated with military families,&quot;said Dargan.&quot;Among Navy recruits,
54 percent of our female Sailors and 40 percent of our male Sailors
witnessed parental domestic violence prior to enlistment. Deployment
reunification also creates a unique stress on families in the military.
Deployments require the partner left at home to assume new roles, upon
reunification there may be issues related to this role reversal. Long
separations can also foster distrust between the family and uncertainty
about the future.&quot;Lt. Cmdr. Katherine Schneirla, alongside songwriter and musician
Caroline Pierce, sang&quot;Try to Say Goodbye&quot;and&quot;Into the Garden,&quot;which
were written by Pierce about her family&apos;s experience with domestic violence.

One by one, the silhouettes were brought to the front of the chapel, and
their stories were read aloud.&quot;The issues that I help people work through are very profound and
intense, but it&apos;s very rewarding because I think that our treatment
programs really make a difference,&quot;said Kathy Selves, Family Advocacy
Program counselor at NBK.&quot;I see the men and women who come out of our
program making much better choices and feeling better about their lives
and their relationships.&quot;For more news from Naval Base Kitsap, visit www.navy.mil/local/kitsap/.

NNS081004-11. NAS Whidbey Island Opens Skate Park

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Tucker M. Yates, Fleet Public
Affairs Center, Det. Northwest

OAK HARBOR, Wash. (NNS) -- Naval Air Station (NAS) Whidbey Island held a
ribbon-cutting ceremony for the grand opening of&quot;The Grind&quot;Skate Park
Sept. 26.

The event marked the conclusion of a project which began in January and
cost approximately $100,000. The Liberty Northwest Single Sailor Center
on NAS Whidbey Island initiated the project.&quot;Our job at this base is to support the fleet, fighter and family,&quot;said
Cmdr. Matt Miller, NAS Whidbey Island executive officer.&quot;We support the
fleet by keeping the tower open, paving the runways and making sure that
stuff works so we can get our folks ready to deploy.&quot;This is about the fighter, those single Sailors out there and
supporting the families. This is a great opportunity to do that, and we
want to do these things to make sure you have a good time while
stationed here.&quot;Professional skateboarder Chad Knight inaugurated the park with a
performance and gave out autographed posters to those in attendance.
There were also raffle tickets for t-shirts, hats, a skate deck and
other gear donated for the occasion. Knight also presented two
skateboards to the winners of a best trick competition and ugliest board
competition.&quot;I really like this set up with the prefabricated ramps, and I actually
prefer this over the concrete parks because it&apos;s not as slippery or
painful to fall on,&quot;said Knight, who has been skateboarding for 21
years and professionally for 12.&quot;It&apos;s cool that the Single Sailor
Center actually made this happen and got this done. A lot of people try
to get these things going and they never come to be.&quot;The park includes a mini half-pipe, a quarter pipe, grind boxes, a
street ledge, stairs, a pyramid, banks, a table and other obstacles to
test a skateboarder&apos;s mettle.&quot;This is all part of installation initiative to increase recreational
opportunities for single Sailors and even family members,&quot;said Sherry
Yates, Morale, Welfare and Recreation Liberty Program manager.&quot;For
single Sailors it gives them a great opportunity to get out in the fresh
air and get some exercise.&quot;Knight, who recently returned from teaching a skateboard camp for three
weeks on U.S. military installations in Japan, is impressed with how
much the military does to support its people and provide them with off
duty activities.&quot;I can&apos;t imagine the traditional people who have been in the military
for years trying to figure out what to get for these guys all of a
sudden thinking, &apos;let&apos;s get them a skateboard park,&apos;&quot;said Knight.&quot;The
chains of command are obviously listening to their people&apos;s suggestions
and what they want. I think it&apos;s awesome that they&apos;ve done this because
I know this stuff isn&apos;t cheap, and it&apos;s not an easy task to get these
things built. It shows a lot on their part that there&apos;s a skate park
sitting there right now.&quot;For more news from Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, visit

NNS081004-05. NMFC/JTWC Sailors Attend NASCAR Race and Give Back to
Community

By Lt. j.g. Casey Hughes, Naval Maritime Forecast Center/Joint Typhoon
Warning Center Public Affairs

FONTANA, Calif. (NNS) -- Sailors from the Naval Maritime Forecast
Center/Joint Typhoon Warning Center (NMFC/JTWC) in Pearl Harbor attended
the NASCAR Nationwide Series Camping World RV Service 300 at Auto Club
Speedway in Fontana, Calif. August 30 and also helped a family in need
turn a house into a home.

NMFC/JTWC was selected to attend the race by the Navy Motorsports Team
for the 2008 Fleet Honoree Program. The Fleet Honoree Program was
initially developed by the Navy Recruiting Command and is now
facilitated by the Navy motorsports marketing team to honor a command,
ship, squadron or base with a NASCAR Nationwide Series race experience.

The NMFC/JTWC Sailors, along with 32 other applicants, were selected out
of more than 90 applicants for the program.

NMFC/JTWC sent seven of their top-performing Sailors to the race: Lt.
Greg Ray, Lt. j.g. Casey Hughes, Senior Chief Aerographer&apos;s Mate David
Martinez, Aerographer&apos;s Mate 2nd Class Chris Lay, Aerographer&apos;s Mate 2nd
Class Christina Leighty, Information Systems Technician 2nd Class Kawika
Lee Lum-Perreira, and Aerographer&apos;s Mate 3rd Class James Taylor Jr.

NMFC&apos;s selected Sailors watched the race from the pits and got a
behind-the-scenes look at NASCAR. As part of that behind-the-scenes
look, they visited the No. 88 Accelerate Your Life Chevy Monte Carlo
team&apos;s garage and met the driver of the car, Brad Keselowski. Keselowski
told the Sailors how it is an honor to drive for the Navy and gave each
Sailor his personal No. 88 Accelerate Your Life Chevy Monte Carlo team
coin.

The Sailors also met with NASCAR legend Tim Brewer in his on-the-scene
ESPN studio where he does live technical analysis during the race.

As part of the race experience, two Sailors, Leighty and Taylor, were
chosen to be honorary pit crew members. They wore official No. 88
Accelerate Your Life Chevy Monte Carlo team jerseys during the race and
assisted with pit crew duties.&quot;This has been one of the coolest things I have experienced since being
in the Navy and I am so thankful for this opportunity,&quot;said Taylor.

However, this wasn&apos;t just a great opportunity for the NMFC members, but
also for a local family in Redlands, Calif.; where the Sailors
volunteered their time with Habitat for Humanity to help build a home
for a hard-working mother of three. They spent Friday afternoon
installing side panels on the family&apos;s new home.&quot;I am happy to know that the house will go to a well-deserving family,&quot;said Ray.

NMFC/JTWC supports the Navy&apos;s fleet with maritime forecasts and Optimum
Track Ship Routing services to ships afloat in the Pacific and Indian

NNS081004-04. Navy Infrastructure Analysts Improve Readiness, Response
to Hurricanes

By John Joyce, Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Public Affairs

DAHLGREN, Va. (NNS) -- Navy analysts and engineers set a record by
providing infrastructure analysis support to assist U.S. Northern
Command (NORTHCOM) operations in response to two hurricanes and a
tropical storm in September.&quot;We provided predictive and infrastructure analysis to NORTHCOM for Ike,
Hannah and Gustav,&quot;said Kathrina Urann, Naval Surface Warfare Center
(NSWC) Dahlgren Defense Critical Infrastructure Program (DCIP) Project
Manager on Oct. 1.&quot;Mission assurance division personnel identified DoD
bases, assets and supporting infrastructure potentially affected by the
hurricanes.&quot;The DCIP team  40 NSWC Dahlgren employees, including a full-time
liaison and four analysts who deployed to NORTHCOM headquarters
throughout the month  helped ensure DoD assets were available to
support hurricane relief efforts.&quot;DoD was better able to prepare for and respond to a series of natural
hazards threatening the United States homeland as a result of the timely
and accurate data and analysis provided by our Defense Critical
Infrastructure Program Crisis Support Team,&quot;said John Lysher, NSWC
Dahlgren Asymmetric Defense Systems Department dead.

In addition to DoD resources, the team analyzed commercial
infrastructure that included electric power, telecommunications, water
supplies, transportation, oil and natural gas.&quot;This information was used by NORTHCOM action officers to brief senior
DoD leadership,&quot;said Urann.&quot;We provided infrastructure and impact
analysis for base support installations tasked with pre-positioning
supplies for hurricane relief and information on identified
infrastructure outage areas.&quot;&quot;The support of this team was essential to ensuring DoD leadership had
the best information from which to base their crisis decisions,&quot;Lysher
added.

Military responders also relied on geospatial systems  TRITON and the
Homeland DefenseMission Assurance Portal (HD-MAP)  developed by NSWC
Dahlgren to monitor hurricane relief efforts and identify DoD assets
affected by the hurricanes.

The responders used the geospatial systems in their efforts to identify
commercial infrastructure assets potentially affected by the hurricanes.

TRITON is a web portal developed and hosted by NSWC Dahlgren
Laboratory&apos;s Mission Assurance Division that integrates and visualizes
data from many sources on a geographic map. In order to facilitate
interagency collaboration, NORTHCOM uses TRITON as its external
unclassified common operational picture.

HD-MAP is the Office of Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland
Defense and America&apos;s Security Affairs (OASD-HD&amp;ASA) classified
geospatial portal providing access to Defense Critical Infrastructure
Program data and analysis.

DoD commands and agencies employing TRITON and HD-MAP include NORTHCOM;
OASD-HD&amp;ASA; Joint Task ForceGlobal Network Operations, Defense
Information Systems Agency, the Joint Staff National Military Command
Center and the National Guard Bureau.

The mission assurance division also collaborated with the Department of
Homeland Security&apos;s National Infrastructure Coordination Center in
September to share products and information in support of hurricane
disaster response and relief efforts.

NNS081004-03. Navy SEALs Sponsor High School Water Polo Tournament

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Michael Lindsey, Naval
Special Warfare Recruiting Directorate Public Affairs

CORONADO, Calif. (NNS) -- The U.S. Navy SEALs sponsored the 2008
America&apos;s Finest City Men&apos;s High School Water Polo Invitational, at
Coronado High School, Coronado, Calif., Sept. 27.

The tournament consisted of 32 participating teams from all over
California. The final eight competed at the Brian Bent Memorial Aquatics
Complex pool at Coronado High School, where the Navy SEALs presented the&quot;Fire in the Gut&quot;award to the most motivated player.&quot;The &apos;Fire in the Gut&apos; award is an award that we give out in SEAL
training not necessarily to the best person, but to the one who displays
the most tenacity and has that &apos;no-quit&apos; attitude,&quot;said Special
Operator 1st Class (SEAL) David Goggins.

The Navy&quot;Leap Frogs&quot;performed a team parachute demonstration, and
several Navy SEALs - former water polo players themselves - were
present at the event answering questions about SEAL training to
inquisitive high schoolers and their parents.

Historically, water polo players have enjoyed a higher success rate at
Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) training than other candidates.
In fact, there are at least 11 known water polo players from Coronado
High School, who have attended the basic SEAL training course. All of
them successfully made it through the BUD/S program.

Water polo is a team water sport, described as a combination of
swimming, soccer, basketball, ice hockey, rugby and wrestling. Each team
consists of six field players and one goalkeeper.&quot;These athletes were some of the best I&apos;ve ever seen. They were in
excellent condition and mental and physical shape,&quot;said Goggins.&quot;They
were focused on what they had to do.&quot;&quot;The Naval Special Warfare community is always actively engaging young
athletes who have a physical and mental predisposition to succeed in
SEAL training,&quot;said Lt. Cmdr. (SEAL) Andy Schreiner, operations officer
for the Naval Special Warfare Recruiting Directorate.&quot;San Diego is our
home, and we are thrilled to support this competition right here in our
community.&quot;Passing the physical screening test (PST) to become a SEAL means
minimums of a 500-yard swim in 13 minutes; 42 push-ups in two minutes;
50 sit-ups in two minutes; 6 pull-ups; and 1.5-mile run in 12 minutes,
30 seconds. Those who can complete the PST with more competitive scores
typically have a higher success rate in SEAL training.

NNS081004-14. Famous Helicopter Pilot Speaks to Naval Aviators

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class John P. Curtis

Fleet Public Affairs Center, Pacific

SAN DIEGO (NNS) -- The Naval Helicopter Association (NHA) invited
Charles&quot;Chuck&quot;P. Aaron, an aerobatic helicopter pilot, to speak with
Navy helicopter pilots and crew members on Naval Air Station North
Island, Oct. 3.

Aaron has accumulated more than 18,000 hours of flight time during his
30 years of flying helicopters and currently works for the Red Bull
Corp. He is the only civilian pilot licensed by the Federal Aviation
Administration in North America to perform helicopter aerobatics.

During his speech Aaron explained to Navy pilots why he does the air shows.&quot;My purpose and motive for doing aerobatic air shows is to demonstrate
to the kids to think outside the box,&quot;Aaron said.&quot;I thought outside
the box by making this helicopter do what I wanted it to do and
hopefully advancing aviation. I want kids to think the same thing and
come up with their own dreams to do when they get older.&quot;According to Aaron, he performs his various stunts using one of his two
identical modified Eurocopter/Messerschmitt Boelkow Blohm&apos;s BO-105 CBS
helicopters.&quot;The reason why he can fly and do the aerobatics he does is because he
has a really sound knowledge of the [helicopter] systems,&quot;said Lt. j.g.
Chris Yenias, a pilot assigned to Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron
Light (HSL) 43. Having that knowledge is why he can fly that helicopter
like a sports car while the rest of us fly it like Cadillacs.&quot;Approximately 40 helicopter pilots from more than five different
commands took the opportunity to meet Aaron.&quot;It was pretty cool just to hear the stories,&quot;Yenias said.&quot;It just
doesn&apos;t seem like anything he ever did he thought was impossible.&quot;Capt. Donald Williamson, Commander, Helicopter Maritime Strike Wing,
U.S. Pacific Fleet and NHA President said that he invited Aaron for this
event as part of an effort by the NHA to hold more events than just the
annual symposium.

Aaron is in the San Diego area to perform at the 2008 Marine Corps Air
Station (MCAS) Miramar Air Show Oct. 3-5.

NNS081007-08. 100th Anniversary of the Great White Fleet Commemorated in
New York

By Lt. Lesley Lykins, Navy Office of Information, East

NEW YORK (NNS) -- The U.S. Navy commemorated the 100th anniversary of
the Great White Fleet in New York Oct. 7 at Grand Central Terminal with
the opening of an exhibit that will run through the 2008 Columbus
Celebration ending Oct. 17.

The exhibit - which includes eight-foot models of battleships,
artifacts, memorabilia from Sailors aboard the ships and photo displays
that tell the story of an American naval mission - highlights aid
provided by ships of the Great White Fleet to Italy in 1908 following a
devastating earthquake.&quot;This is a great opportunity not only to recognize the accomplishments
of the Great White Fleet but to also highlight our continuing Navy and
Marine Corps mission to help keep international waterways safe and to
reach out to those in need,&quot;said Rear Adm. Terence McKnight, commander,
Expeditionary Strike Group 2.

In 1907, then-President Theodore Roosevelt sent 16 battleships with the
hulls painted white to circumnavigate the globe on a goodwill mission
and display of American naval power. The ships were later known as the
Great White Fleet.

When a devastating earthquake followed by a tidal wave hit Sicily and
Southern Italy in late 1908, leaving an estimated 200,000 dead, ships
from the fleet rushed to provide essential humanitarian aid and services.

The exhibit demonstrates the clear parallels between the Great White
Fleet, sent on its deployment by Roosevelt, and today&apos;s Maritime
Strategy emphasizing increased global partnerships to promote peace and
prosperity worldwide.&quot;Just as four ships from the Great White Fleet provided humanitarian
assistance following an earthquake in Sicily [one] hundred years ago,
our amphibious ships continue that important mission today,&quot;said McKnight.&quot;USS Nassau (LHA 4)returned recently from relief efforts following
Hurricane Ike, and USS Kearsarge (LHD 3) spent a great deal of time
rendering aid to Haiti following tropical storms and hurricanes that
affected that nation.&quot;&quot;I have the great honor and privilege to inaugurate this very special
exhibit in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of one of the world&apos;s
worst natural disasters and the humanitarian assistance rendered by the
Great White Fleet of the United State Navy,&quot;said Richard Greco, former
assistant secretary of the Navy.&quot;Together the Department of the Navy
and the Columbus Citizens Foundation, along with many corporate and
governmental sponsors, have all co-sponsored this exhibit because we
believe it is a story that needs to be told.&quot;This is a story that cannot be forgotten, a story of unspeakable loss
of life and misery but a story of great charity and love by one nation
to another nation in a time of need.&quot;The 2008 Columbus Celebration in New York will feature the U.S. Navy
while remembering the Great White Fleet and the aid provided to Italy.
It is the largest celebration of Italian and Italian-American culture in
the world. The Columbus Celebration is organized by the Columbus
Citizens Foundation, which raises scholarship funds for students of
Italian descent.&quot;The significance of the rescue efforts in Italy is important because it
shows the close relationship between the United States and Italy which
continues today,&quot;said Lawrence Auriana, chairman of the board of
governors of the Columbus Citizens Foundation.

Noreen Kirk, from Connecticut, and her 2-year-old son stopped by the
exhibit at Grand Central Terminal.&quot;I didn&apos;t know about the Great White Fleet, but this is very
informative,&quot;said Kirk.&quot;We had been here a few days ago and saw the announcement that this
exhibit would be opening,&quot;said Debbie Friedman, a native of Manhattan
visiting the exhibit with her husband.&quot;This is very impressive, and it
describes a part of history that is not very well recognized today.&quot;The amphibious assault ship Nassau will visit New York for the Columbus
Celebration with Sailors participating in the New York City Columbus Day
parade. The ship will be open for public visitation Oct. 13.

NNS081007-12. TR Completes South African Port Visit

By Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class (AW/SW) Monique K. Hilley,
USS Theodore Roosevelt Public Affairs

USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT, At Sea (NNS) -- USS Theodore Roosevelt (TR) (CVN
71) pulled anchor as it departed Cape Town, South Africa Oct. 7, after
its three-day port visit to the area.

This port visit was a historic event as it marked the first time a U.S.
aircraft carrier has visited South Africa in 41 years. The last time a
carrier visited Cape Town was USS Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1967.

Crew members were provided many opportunities to experience the culture
and environment of South Africa. TR&apos;s Morale, Welfare, and Recreation
(MWR) organized several tours for the crew including wine tours, an
African safari, a tour of Cape Point and hiking Table Mountain.&quot;A total of 800 Sailors took MWR tours on Monday, Oct. 6, and we have
gotten nothing but rave reviews from everyone that went on the trips,&quot;said Chief Aviation Electrician&apos;s Mate (AW) Bryan Neal, TR&apos;s MWR fun
chief.&quot;At the end of the day, we were able to accommodate Sailors by
giving them the opportunity to see the country.&quot;TR was anchored in the harbor of Table Bay with the dramatic Table
Mountain as its backdrop. Table Mountain is considered one of the most
recognizable and most visited sites in the region. MWR provided bus
rides and tickets to the crew so they could ride the cableway up the
mountain and enjoy a 360-degree view of the city.&quot;The view was breathtaking, and I was totally surprised at how close we
were able to get to the edge of the mountain,&quot;said Lt. j.g. James
Knepp.&quot;It was one of the most enjoyable experiences I had in port.&quot;One of MWR&apos;s tours was the Bushman Experience which offered Sailors a
chance to visit an ostrich farm as well as the opportunity to visit a
local village where tours were provided by a local Bushman who
demonstrated their way of life.&quot;It was crazy to see how other parts of the world live,&quot;said
Storekeeper Seaman Lacy Frye.&quot;My favorite part was definitely sitting
on an ostrich. That is something you do not get to do back home.&quot;Crew members also got the chance to dine on some very unique cuisine
while on liberty in Cape Town including warthog, gazelle, crocodile and
caribou steaks.&quot;We were honored to be able to experience the amazing culture of South
Africa. This visit to Cape Town was a rare opportunity for our Sailors,
one that I know will remain long in the memories of every member of the
crew,&quot;said Capt. Ladd Wheeler, TR&apos;s commanding officer.

NNS081007-11. Navy Personnel Command Marks Decade of Service from
America&apos;s Heartland

By Chief Mass Communication Specialist (SW) Maria Yager, Navy Personnel
Command Public Affairs

MILLINGTON, Tenn. (NNS) -- A U.S. senator praised members of the Navy
team during an anniversary ceremony Oct. 3 marking Navy Personnel
Command (NPC), Navy Recruiting Command (NRC) and NSA Mid-South&apos;s (NSA)
10 years of service excellence to the fleet from its current location
near Memphis.&quot;I&apos;m here today to join you in celebrating a 10-year anniversary.
Tennessee became the heart of the Navy. Shelby county and Tennessee and
the Mid-South gained great new neighbors and increased prosperity.
Thanks to the men and women for their service -- active and Reserve,
civilian and contractor,&quot;said U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander.

Guest speaker Vice Adm. J.C. Harvey, director, Navy Staff was a former
Chief of Naval Personnel responsible for both NPC and NRC. Harvey spoke
of the important role Sailors from Millington serve in support of the
nation&apos;s Maritime Strategy.&quot;Sailors at the end of the day are the ones who forge relationships and
partnerships. Sailors will make this strategy a reality. This new
strategy relies on capable young men and women who are empowered and
entrusted with a higher level of responsibility and authority. We must
recruit and then we must retain the very best young men and women in
this nation to meet these new challenges. I share this with you because
none of these would be possible without the work that is done here in
Millington. Our Navy could not operate without you,&quot;said Harvey.

Millington is often referred to as the&quot;engine room&quot;of the Navy because
it supplies the manpower to enable the fleet. NRC has recruited more
than 600,000 Sailors in the past 10 years. NPC has written orders for
more than 330,000 Sailors, including orders for Sailors supporting the
war on terrorism.

As the Navy&apos;s manpower manager, NPC assigns Sailors to job vacancies,
serving as the human resources department for the Navy. NPC&apos;s workforce
is involved with Sailors every day throughout each Sailor&apos;s career and
lifetime. The command furnishes the full spectrum of programs and services.

Promotion and selection boards are conducted 50 weeks out of the year in
Millington. These boards include promotions for officers and chiefs,
selection boards for test pilots and Seaman-to-Admiral applicants,
limited duty officer/chief warrant officer in-service procurement and
even NASA astronaut screening. The largest is the active-duty E-7 board
with more than 20,000 eligible candidates.

NPC also drafts the policies that impact Navy careers.

NPC was established Oct. 1, 1998. The Navy&apos;s recruiting headquarters
relocated to NSA from Washington in 1999. The move followed a Base
Closure and Realignment Committee recommendation, which relocated
several functions of the Bureau of Naval Personnel from Washington to
Millington. Before becoming the Navy&apos;s human resource engine room, NSA
was formerly home to an air station and aviation training schools.&quot;NPC touches the life of each and every Sailor serving in the Navy.
Regardless of what our specific job is, we&apos;re all here to support our
Sailors in the fleet,&quot;said Rear Adm. Sonny Masso, commander, NPC.

NNS081007-07. Farragut Completes POA 08, Returns Home

By Lt. Jacob Steele, Destroyer Squadron 40 Public Affairs

MAYPORT, Fla. (NNS) -- USS Farragut (DDG-99) returned to her homeport at
Naval Station Mayport Oct. 5 after a six-month deployment with Destroyer
Squadron (DESRON) 40 in support of Partnership of the Americas 2008 (POA
08).

Farragut departed Mayport April 7 on the first leg of their route to
circumnavigate South America.

In Rio, Farragut participated with DESRON 40 ship USS Kauffman (FFG-59)
and embarked Helicopter Anti-submarine Squadron Light (HSL) 42,
Detachment 7 as well as USS George Washington (CVN-73) in the Atlantic
phase of the multinational UNITAS exercise.

Other important components of the Partnership of the Americas engagement
were the theater security cooperation (TSC) missions, which Farragut
conducted in each one of the 13 ports she visited during the deployment.
TSC missions feature subject-matter-expert exchanges, distinguished
visitor tours, receptions and sporting events which promote goodwill and
esprit de corps between the U.S. Navy and partner nation navies.

Some of the acts of goodwill in which Farragut Sailors participated were
the community relations (COMREL) projects which were a part of every TSC
mission. During COMRELs, Farragut Sailors helped paint and rebuild
schools, orphanages and elders&apos; residences in 13 cities throughout the
Caribbean and Central and South America.

In conjunction with the COMREL projects, Farragut distributed donated
goods from Project Handclasp, an official U.S. Navy program which
coordinates delivery of humanitarian, educational and goodwill material,
to all 13 cities visited.

Upon completion of UNITAS Atlantic phase, Farragut conducted TSC visits
in Montevideo, Uruguay, and Ushuaia, Argentina, before transiting the
Straits of Magellan and entering the Pacific Ocean.&quot;The inland passages near the Straits of Magellan are some of the most
beautiful and dangerous waters in the world,&quot;said Farragut Commanding
Officer, Cmdr. Scott Dugan.&quot;We are privileged to have sailed there and
faced the challenges the climate, seas and weather the narrow passages
provided for us. Few sailors in the world have gone there, and to do so
for such a worthwhile purpose made it only better.&quot;Farragut then participated in the submarine warfare exercises&quot;EJAS
Norte&quot;(Spanish for Anti-Submarine Warfare Exercise North) with the
Chilean navy and Silent Forces Exercise with Peru before pulling into
port in Lima, to prepare for UNITAS Pacific phase. UNITAS Pacific
included the navies of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Chile.

The ship also participated in TSC events in Cartagena, Colombia, and
then moved to Colon, Panama, to participate in the largest multinational
joint exercise in this hemisphere, PANAMAX, which focuses on bringing
many nations together to practice defending the Panama Canal, a vital
and vulnerable passage for commercial and military ships from all over
the world. More than 20 nations and 35 ships participated this year.

After successfully completing PANAMAX, Farragut returned to conducting
TSC missions in the Caribbean, spreading goodwill to Curacao, Trinidad
and Tobago, St. Lucia and Martinique.

Most recently, Farragut conducted 14 days of counter-illicit trafficking
operations in the Caribbean in support of Joint Interagency Task Force
South. On Oct. 1, Farragut intercepted a vessel with an initial tally of
three metric tons of cocaine aboard.&quot;Interdictions such as Farragut&apos;s, which discourage cartels from
shipping illicit drugs, encourage legal trade between nations, and
perhaps most importantly, keep drugs off of American streets, are key to
our safety as a nation and to regional stability and our ongoing
cooperation with partner nations,&quot;said Capt. Rudy Laco, DESRON 40
commodore.&quot;As Farragut returns home to friends and family, her Sailors can look
back on a deployment full of achievement, success, faith and goodwill
towards all of our southern neighbors,&quot;said Dugan.&quot;Interoperability,
cooperation and partnership cannot be surged. Farragut can be proud that
she has made enormous steps for the United States towards just those
goals and towards ensuring stability throughout the region for years to
come.&quot;During the deployment, Farragut was under operational control of U.S.
Naval Forces Southern Command (NAVSO)/U.S. 4th Fleet conducting TSC
missions, and counter-illicit trafficking operations in the U.S.
Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) area of focus, which encompasses the
Caribbean, Central and South America, and surrounding waters. Once
Farragut returned to Mayport, U.S. 2nd Fleet took over operational control.

NAVSO, the naval component command of SOUTHCOM, directs U.S. Naval
Forces operating in the Caribbean, Central and South American regions
and interacts with partner nation navies within the maritime
environment. Various operations include counter-illicit trafficking,
theater security cooperation, humanitarian assistance and disaster
relief, military-to-military interaction and bilateral and multinational
training.

Fourth Fleet is the numbered fleet assigned to NAVSO, exercising
operational control of assigned forces in the SOUTHCOM area of focus.

NNS081007-04. Navy&apos;s Personnel Head Challenges NPS Grads to Put
World-Class Education to Work

By Barbara Honegger, Naval Postgraduate School Public Affairs

MONTEREY, Calif. (NNS) -- More than 300 U.S. and international officers
and Department of Defense (DoD) civilians received degrees from the
Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) at the summer 2008 graduation ceremonies
in King Hall Sept. 26.

Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Manpower and Reserve Affairs Anita
Blair called on the graduates to use their world-class education to
advance the Navy and the nation.

U.S. military officers earned degrees ranging from doctorates to masters
in business administration. More than 200 military officers received
degrees, including 136 from the Navy, 27 from the Marine Corps, 29 from
the Air Force, 12 from the Army, three from the Navy Reserves, two from
the Army Reserves, 120 DoD civilians and 18 international officers; 78
officers also earned their Naval Command and Staff diploma in Joint
Professional Military Education, Phase I, from the Naval War College,
which has a satellite campus at NPS.&quot;If there were a U.S. News and World Report list of the top hard-working
schools, the Naval Postgraduate School would be right up there,&quot;said
Blair, whom NPS President Daniel Oliver introduced as&quot;a strong champion
of graduate education and a long-time friend of the Naval Postgraduate
School.&quot;&quot;The faculty and staff have done their part to provide you with a
unique, world-class opportunity in research and education to enable you
to fulfill your role. The rest is up to you.&quot;Blair lauded NPS as a sterling example of education.&quot;We train to replicate, but we educate to innovate,&quot;said Blair.&quot;Here
at the Naval Postgraduate School, you&apos;ve learned not only the &apos;how&apos; of
what can be done, but what should be done, and why.&quot;We&apos;re fighting an information age war with an industrial age management
system, especially in the area of information technology,&quot;said Blair.&quot;I sincerely support the Naval Postgraduate School in its efforts to
realize the revolutionary vision of bringing the best the information
age has to offer to the Department of Defense.&quot;&quot;You should be justly proud of what you&apos;ve accomplished here,&quot;Oliver
rallied the grads,&quot;and we look forward to calling you alumni.&quot;Following the ceremony, the new alumni received congratulations from
fellow students, family and friends at a reception in the Barbara McNitt
Ballroom.

Meteorology and physical oceanography graduate Lt. Cmdr. Erick Edwards
recommended NPS highly to fellow officers.&quot;Every [meteorology] officer comes to NPS at some time in their naval
career, and now that I&apos;ve been here I can say it&apos;s a really great career
milestone,&quot;said Edwards.&quot;It&apos;s a very, very thorough program, a great opportunity
and a great all-around tour.&quot;Lt. Dietmar Teufel, who received his master&apos;s in computer science, added
an international perspective.&quot;At NPS, you gain a deep insight into the culture of the U.S., as well
as of the many other nations who send their officers here,&quot;said Teufel.&quot;And this is now more important than ever, because the higher in rank
you go, and especially if you serve in NATO or with coalition forces,
you have to work with the militaries from many nations.&quot;For more new from Naval Postgraduate School, visit www.navy.mil/local/nps/.

the streets around Naval Base San Diego Oct. 4 for the Main Street Clean-up.

During the semi-annual NBSD event, volunteers from naval units around
the San Diego-area enhanced the appearance of the surrounding community.&quot;We had a great turnout,&quot;said Master at Arms 1st Class (SW/SCW) Juan
Skewes, NBSD Main Street Clean-up coordinator.&quot;People from all over the
waterfront came out to show their pride in their community.&quot;NBSD Commanding Officer Rear Adm. (Sel.) Dixon Smith and San Diego City
Councilmember Ben Hueso praised the efforts of the volunteers.&quot;This Main Street Clean-up demonstrates our commitment to our neighbors
and our environment,&quot;said Smith.&quot;The pride demonstrated through this
clean-up effort is contagious. NBSD Sailors are making difference both
globally and locally.&quot;Hueso, whose city council district includes the base, its surrounding
neighborhoods and the international border area, said he appreciates the
example the Navy sets.&quot;I applaud the service men and women and San Diegans who took part in
this great community clean-up effort,&quot;said Hueso.&quot;Naval Base San Diego
has demonstrated once again leadership in the community. They are a
valued member of the national defense establishment and the City of San

NNS081007-09. Navy ERP Goes Live at NAVSUP&gt;From Navy Supply Systems Command Office of Corporate Communications

MECHANICSBURG, Pa. (NNS) -- Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) kicked
off conversion of its financial system of record to the Navy Enterprise
Resource Planning (Navy ERP) system Oct. 1.

Navy ERP is an integrated business management system that modernizes and
standardizes Navy business operations, provides unprecedented management
visibility across the enterprise and increases effectiveness and efficiency.

NAVSUP is the second major acquisition command to implement the
financial backbone of the Navy ERP system, joining the Naval Air Systems
Command (NAVAIR), which has conducted its business operations using the
new system since last fall. The major acquisition commands are the
largest business concerns in the Navy, and when fully implemented across
the systems commands, Navy ERP will be the sole financial system
managing more than half of the Navy&apos;s total obligations.&quot;This transition is a milestone for NAVSUP and showcases the exceptional
efforts of our workforce in managing the transition from legacy systems
and learning to operate ERP. Navy ERP is the system to take us into the
future as we re-tool the supply system,&quot;said Rear Adm. Alan S.
Thompson, NAVSUP commander.

NAVSUP is implementing Navy ERP Release 1.0, which provides
functionality in financial operations, program management and workforce
management with a more integrated capability than the legacy systems
previously used. The conversion to the modernized system is another
major step toward the transformation of business affairs in one updated,
standardized, interconnected system that provides financial
transparency, asset visibility and effectiveness and efficiency to the
Navy&apos;s efforts to support its warfighters.&quot;ERP Release 1.0 significantly enhances our capabilities in the areas of
resource and project management. For the first time, we will have
visibility across the Navy of all labor and non-labor costs associated
with major products and services, such as supply chain management, or of
contracting by warfare enterprise and major weapons systems,&quot;explained
Karen Meloy, Navy ERP program manager for NAVSUP.&quot;As we become experts with Navy ERP 1.0, we will have much to look
forward to with ERP 1.1, which is projected to go-live in about 18
months,&quot;Thompson noted. ERP 1.1 will replace the majority of our
wholesale and retail supply applications with a single, integrated
supply chain solution.&quot;Our NAVSUP team has been an integral part in making ERP 1.0 a success,
and I&apos;m confident their persistence and hard work will go a long way as
we move forward toward ERP 1.1,&quot;Thompson added.

NAVSUP&apos;s primary mission is to provide U.S. naval forces with quality
supplies and services. With headquarters in Mechanicsburg, Pa., and
employing a diverse, worldwide workforce of more than 25,500 military
and civilian personnel, NAVSUP oversees logistics programs in the areas
of supply operations, conventional ordnance, contracting, resale, fuel,
transportation and security assistance. In addition, NAVSUP is
responsible for quality of life issues for our naval forces, including
food service, postal services, Navy Exchanges and movement of household
goods.

NNS081007-02. Starbase-Atlantis Celebrates 200th Class Graduation

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class John Ciccarelli Jr., Fleet
Public Affairs Detachment Hawaii

PEARL HARBOR (NNS) -- The Pearl Harbor-based Starbase-Atlantis program
celebrated its 200th class graduation Oct. 2, at the Naval Submarine
Training Center (NSTC) on Naval Station Pearl Harbor.

Starbase-Atlantis is a Department of Defense program which is designed
to provide education to the local school communities to help them
develop positive self-esteem, goal-setting skills and to encourage
teamwork through hands-on activities.

Since the opening of the NSTC in 2002, more than 10,000 students have
attended the Starbase-Atlantis program.

The graduation class was made up of students from Pearl Harbor
Elementary&apos;s 5th grade, who attended a one-day-a-week class for five
weeks designed to increase interest in and knowledge of science,
technology, engineering and math.

Corrie Heck, chief communication officer for Hawaii Governor Linda
Lingle, addressed the class about the contribution of the state&apos;s youth
to the future.&quot;I am excited for what the students of this class represent,&quot;she said.&quot;They represent our future, and these students are the ones who will
change the world we live in and know.&quot;These classes can help teach students not only about the hands-on
experience, but it also can teach teamwork and to come up with solutions
to problems,&quot;said Heck.

Retired Vice Adm. Robert Kihune served as guest speaker.&quot;One day these fifth graders will be running this country, so we need to
start early by giving them the chance to learn about these well desired
jobs in the United States Navy today,&quot;Kihune said.

Kihune started the program in Pensacola in 1994. Since then the program
has grown to 60 locations within the United States, including 13 sites
on Navy installations.

Following the graduation ceremony, the students participated in a model
rocket launch they built as part of the program.

Joseph Barrett, program director, said that due NSTC&apos;s success with the
program, Hawaii&apos;s Air National Guard is planning to open a location at
their armory for local residents in Hilo on Hawaii.

NNS081007-06. NAVFAC Southeast Awards $100 Million Contract for Projects
in South Carolina, Georgia&gt;From Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast Public Affairs

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (NNS) -- Naval Facilities Engineering Command
(NAVFAC) Southeast awarded a $100 million multiple award design build
construction contract (MACC) Oct. 1 to five contractors for building
type projects at Naval, Marine Corps and Air Force installations in
South Carolina and Georgia.

The contractors include Team Construction LLC, of Jacksonville, N.C.;
Sloan and Associates, Inc., of Valdosta, Ga., Spec Pro Environmental
Services LLC, of Oak Ridge, Tenn., HCR/Cape JV LLC a joint venture, of
Suwanee, Ga., and J2 Engineering, Inc. a joint venture, of Tampa, Fla.

The type of work that will be performed will be general building
projects (new construction, renovation, alteration, demolition, or
repair work) of industrial facilities; airfield, aircraft hangar,
aircraft traffic control facilities; infrastructure; administrative
facilities; training facilities; dormitories; and community support
facilities.&quot;The largest benefit the MACC gives us is design-build capability,&quot;said
Lt. Cmdr. Ron Jenkins, resident in charge of construction Beaufort.&quot;Having the MACC in place may save us as much as two to three months
from project conception to award.&quot;The MACC will allow installations the chance to submit proposals for
contracts that meet the minimum requirement of $100,000 to the maximum
contract amount of $6 million for a single project as long as the
project is located on an installation in South Carolina or Georgia. This
will provide a faster and more efficient construction process for the
affected installations.&quot;If we have an emergent requirement that arises we can now execute with
the MACC,&quot;said Jenkins.&quot;It will definitely improve the timelines to
get a project underway.&quot;The first project (task order) was awarded to Team Construction LLC in
the amount of $6.3 million to design and construct a structural fire
station at Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, S.C.

The existing fire station was built in the 1950s and is outdated. The
new facility will be relocated outside the flight line area, will serve
the entire base and will provide for improved response time to a
majority of the calls with its new location outside a secured area.

Future projects under this MACC will be awarded as a task order. The
MACC contract will be in effect for five years or $100 million,
whichever comes first.

Fleet Public Affairs Center San Diego

MIRAMAR, Calif. (NNS) -- Military members, their families, local
residents, and aviation enthusiasts packed the grandstands Oct. 4 at the
annual Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Miramar Air Show in&quot;A Salute to
Marine Corps Aviation.&quot;This year&apos;s spectacle showcased the latest in U.S. military avionics and
focused on the men and women who make Marine aviation what it is today.
Aircraft from past U.S. conflicts also took to the skies, including a
P-51 Mustang and an AT-6 Texan. The show included a performance by the
Blue Angels.&quot;The Blues are a big favorite with San Diego,&quot;said Col. Christopher
O&apos;Connor, commanding officer of MCAS Miramar.&quot;They&apos;re the highlight of
this year&apos;s show, and we&apos;re certainly glad to have them be a part of it.&quot;The air show offered events that catered to all ages, including a flag
drop by parachuting Soldiers from the U.S. Army&apos;s Golden Knights,
in-flight gymnastics by Oracle Challenger stuntman Sean Tucker,
explosive demonstrations by the Marine Air-Ground Task Force. With
tents, booths and hundreds of aircraft from the past and present lining
the assembly area, there was something for everyone to enjoy.&quot;It&apos;s great to be a part of something so special,&quot;said Machinist&apos;s Mate
1st Class (SW/AW) Chad Bear of Naval Recruiting Depot San Diego.&quot;These
types of events really help to promote military awareness.&quot;Spectators were captivated by an historic flight that combined nostalgic
patriotism with modern day technology when an F/A-18 Super Hornet flew
alongside a WWII-era F4U Corsair Bearcat in the Legacy Flight.&quot;It&apos;s great for civilians to get the chance to interact with the
military,&quot;said Marine Corps Staff Sgt. Kevin Music, in town from Camp
Pendleton while taking part in San Diego Fleet Week.&quot;Some of these kids
will be the future of the military, so it&apos;s a very positive experience
for them.&quot;For more news from Navy Region Southwest, visit www.navy.mil/local/cnrsw/.

NNS081007-05. First Supply Corps Junior Officer Training Symposium Held

By Tim Christmann and Debbie Dortch, Navy Supply Systems Command Public
Affairs

NORFOLK (NNS) -- The first Supply Corps Junior Officer Training
Symposium (JOTS) was held at the Fleet Industrial Supply Center at Naval
Station Norfolk Oct. 3.

JOTS provided a venue for junior supply corps officers -- ensigns to
lieutenant commanders -- the opportunity to discuss current career
development issues and challenges.&quot;I think it&apos;s important for all of us to stay informed of our career
options, regardless of what point you are in your career,&quot;said Rear
Adm. Alan S. Thompson, commander, Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP)
and chief of the supply corps.&quot;It&apos;s easy to say that in order to have a successful career you have to
have sustained superior performance, operational tours, graduate
education and all of the other things people frequently speak of when
discussing careers. What you really need is a plan. Six months into a
tour, you should sit down with pen and paper and look at where you&apos;ve
been and where you would like to be in the next five, ten years. You
should seek out four, five officers who are not too senior to you and
share your plan with them. Listen to their opinions; act accordingly.
Develop a relationship with these officers. It&apos;s important to have good
mentors to help guide your career,&quot;Thompson emphasized.

More than 150 military personnel attended the initial session, which was
hosted by the local Supply Corps Association. The event covered a
variety of career-related topics, including supply corps internships,
diversity, the individual augmentation (IA)/Global War on Terrorism
Support Assignment (GSA) process, and career progression guidance.

The event included a senior officer panel discussion that included Rear
Adm. Kenneth Deutsch, deputy chief of staff, Capabilities and Resource
Integration; Rear Adm. Richard O&apos;Hanlon, deputy chief of staff,
Operational Readiness and Training, U.S. Fleet Forces Command; Capt.
Robert Oldani, deputy commander and chief of staff, Naval Surface Force
Atlantic; and Capt. Thomas Barge II, director for Maintenance and
Material Readiness, Commander, Submarine Forces. The panelists provided
a senior leadership perspective on community values, competencies and
capabilities.&quot;It was a diverse presentation that offered a lot. The panel discussions
were very informative. A lot of useful information was made available to
us,&quot;said Lt. Telecia Huffin-Dewitt, assigned to Commander, Navy Region
Mid-Atlantic.&quot;I found the symposium to be very informative. I&apos;m very glad I had the
opportunity to attend. Now I have a much clearer understanding of where
I stand career-wise, and what I need to do to get there,&quot;said Ensign
Dwann Washington, USS Mesa Verde (LPD 19).&quot;Take responsibility for your career. If you want to be successful, you
have to work at it,&quot;Thompson added.

A second symposium is scheduled to occur in San Diego Oct. 24.

NAVSUP&apos;s primary mission is to provide U.S. naval forces with quality
supplies and services. With headquarters in Mechanicsburg, Pa., and
employing a diverse, worldwide workforce of more than 25,500 military

NNS081008-01. Navy Helps Build&quot;Green&quot;Training Facility For Air Force
at Naval Air Station Pensacola&gt;From Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast Public Affairs

PENSACOLA,Fla. (NNS) -- Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC)
Southeast, in partnership with the U.S. Air Force Education and Training
Command, and NTF, L.L.C., broke ground Oct. 2 for a new training
instruction facility aboard Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola.

NAVFAC is working closely with the U.S. Air Force to design and
construct the training instruction facility at NAS Pensacola to meet
their operational needs. The groundbreaking signifies the official start
of construction for NTF, L.L.C., a joint venture of Opus South and
Whitesell-Green of Pensacola, Fla., who was awarded the $46 million
contract in March 2008 for design and construction of a multi-aircraft
hangar and navigator training school classrooms.&quot;As we turn dirt today, we look forward to meeting the challenges ahead
and celebrate a new era in military aviation training,&quot;said U.S. Air
Force Maj. Gen. Gregory A. Feest, commander 19th Air Force.&quot;The
facilities that are built on this site will train our next generation of
aviators.&quot;The project is being built to accommodate the relocation of the Air
Force&apos;s Combat Systems Officer Training School from Randolph Air Force
Base, Texas, to meet the requirements of a Base Realignment and Closure
2005 decision. The Airmen will be relocating to NAS Pensacola from
Randolph Air Force Base beginning in October 2009.

The facility design is well underway and will include a 100,000
square-foot (approximate) hurricane-protected, multi-aircraft training
hangar. The hangar will include approximately 75,000 square-feet of
hangar floor space, 6,000 square-feet for a fuel-cell maintenance bay,
roughly 19,000 square-feet for general aircraft maintenance space, as
well as training and briefing areas. Also included is a 52,000
square-foot (approximate) single-story applied instructional facility
that will include space for classrooms and six flight simulators. The
facilities will be located at the main airfield.

In keeping with NAVFAC&apos;s green program, each of these facilities will
feature high-efficiency mechanical and electrical systems and will
incorporate other&quot;green&quot;design features to achieve a certification
from the U.S. Navy that is equivalent to a U.S. Green Building Council&apos;s
Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver rating.

The new training instruction facility is scheduled to be completed by
November 2009.

NNS081008-04. Pacific Fleet Commander Reflects on Navy Birthday, Service

By Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Luke J. Perry, Commander,
U.S. Pacific Fleet Public Affairs

PEARL HARBOR (NNS) -- In his latest edition of the&quot;Rat-Pac Report&quot;podcast, posted Oct. 8, Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet, Adm. Robert F.
Willard discussed the 233rd birthday of the United States Navy.&quot;Our Navy birthday is a time to reflect on the traditions that have made
our Navy as great as it truly is. And many of those traditions are
things that occasionally we need to review, we need to adhere to,&quot;said
Willard.

A theme of this year&apos;s birthday is the Navy&apos;s commitment to humanitarian
assistance and disaster relief as seen by Pacific Partnership.&quot;We&apos;ve embarked now on a new tradition for our Navy that is having a
great impact on countries in need and putting, I think, a face on our
Navy that is not just U.S., but rather incorporates non-government
organizations and foreign militaries,&quot;said Willard.&quot;Our uniformed
personnel are being recognized as helpers in the region, not just warriors.&quot;Pacific Partnership 2008 was a humanitarian civic assistance mission
designed to build relationships with partner nations in Southeast Asia.
During the six-month mission, more than 100,000 medical and dental
patients were seen, nearly 1,400 surgeries conducted, almost 7,000
animals treated and 25 major engineering projects completed.&quot;We have a new mission. We have a great many traditions,&quot;said Willard.&quot;We&apos;ll try and capture both of those themes in our Navy birthday balls
that occur throughout the year and around the world. Happy birthday, Navy.&quot;The latest podcast is available for download on the Pacific Fleet Web
site, www.cpf.navy.mil. A new&quot;Rat-Pac Report&quot;is scheduled to appear on
the site every Wednesday.

In addition to his weekly podcast, Willard writes a blog that highlights
his travels throughout the Pacific Fleet area of operation and discusses
top issues in the Pacific Fleet today. A link to the blog can also be
found on the Pacific Fleet Web site.

War II by laying a wreath Oct. 6 at the USS Arizona Memorial.&quot;Through this exchange with the City of Honolulu, Nagaoka City sincerely
wishes we together can pledge to peace and a continued friendship with
Honolulu while deepening mutual understanding  mahalo,&quot;Mayor Tamio
Mori said.

As the birthplace of Fleet Adm. Isoroku Yamamoto, Nagaoka City has a
distinct place in history. Yamamoto was a graduate of the Imperial
Japanese Naval Academy, a student of the U.S. Naval War College and of
Harvard University, and the architect of the attack on Pearl Harbor.

During the ceremony, Mori noted Yamamoto&apos;s opposition to the attack on
Pearl Harbor and his desire for peace.&quot;Admiral Yamamoto opposed the war against the United States to the last
minute,&quot;Mori said.&quot;However, as the commander-in-chief of the Combined
Fleet, he unwillingly agreed to start the war and attack Pearl Harbor to
meet the government&apos;s requirement.&quot;Yamamoto has been quoted as saying the attack on the United States was a
blunder, awakening a&quot;sleeping giant.&quot;By the war&apos;s end, both nations were saddened by the loss of many
countrymen. Mori referred to an air raid on Nagaoka City, Aug. 1, 1945,
when more than 1,000 Japanese perished.&quot;Regardless of victory or defeat, the war caused large damage and
sadness to each country,&quot;Mori said.

Bill Wesley, executive director of plans and policy, represented U.S.
Pacific Fleet during the event.&quot;All in attendance were deeply moved and truly impressed with the honor
and respect we demonstrated to those who lost their lives during the
attack on Pearl Harbor,&quot;Wesley said.

Wesley expounded on the continued sharing and support between the United
States and Japan, which has led to years of peace and prosperity.&quot;Mayor Mori and I discussed how well Japan and the United States have
moved forward in the interim period since the war,&quot;Wesley said.&quot;The
Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force and our U.S. Pacific Fleet forces
train together and support each other to ensure peace and maritime
security within the Asia-Pacific Rim.&quot;We conduct exercises and share information to assure our friends,
allies and partner nations that we will continue to work together in the
future to avoid the mistakes made that led to the untoward actions in
World War II,&quot;said Wesley.

NNS081008-03. Submarine First U.S. Participant in International Fleet Review

By Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Bobbie G. Attaway, Commander,
U.S. Naval Forces Korea Public Affairs

PUSAN, Republic of Korea (NNS) -- The city of Pusan hosts this year&apos;s
International Fleet Review 2008, commemorating the 60th anniversary of
the foundation of the Korean government and its armed forces Oct. 5-10.

The week-long event will feature 50 ships from 13 navies worldwide under
the motto&quot;All in One to the Sea, to the World.&quot;The first U.S. vessel
to participate in the festivities was the USS Buffalo (SSN 715), a Los
Angeles-class fast-attack submarine.

The 130 member crew of the submarine participated in the event in
conjunction with a routine port visit. The submarine hosted six
distinguished visitor tours for Korean sailors and officers.

The chief&apos;s mess and the wardroom had socialized events with their
Korean counterparts and even played a friendly game of soccer. Korean
sailors also escorted 35 U.S. Sailors through Nampo-dong Market, which
is Pusan&apos;s largest traditional market.&quot;The host submarine was great, they made us feel welcome and at home.
They really supported us,&quot;said Master Chief Ashley McGee, Chief of the
Boat.&quot;I was impressed.&quot;The Buffalo was commissioned on Nov. 5, 1983 in Norfolk and was
transferred to the Pacific Fleet Submarine Force in 1984. In 2007, it
was relocated from Naval Station Pearl Harbor to its current homeport at
Naval Base Guam.

NNS081008-02. USS De Wert Completes Counter-Drug Deployment; Returns to
Mayport&gt;From USS De Wert Public Affairs

MAYPORT, Fla. (NNS) -- USS De Wert (FFG 45) returned to Naval Station
Mayport Oct. 6 after a five-month counter-illicit deployment to the
Eastern Pacific with Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron Light (HSL) 46
Detachment 1 and Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachments (LEDET) 101 and
103.

De Wert succeeded in intercepting 8.1 metric tons of cocaine with an
estimated wholesale value of $180 million.

On July 11, De Wert, LEDET 103, HSL-46 Det. 1, and Colombian Navy ship
Buenaventura worked together to successfully intercept two go-fast
vessels, each carrying more than a ton of cocaine. De Wert recovered
several bales that one of the suspect vessels tried to jettison, and the
bales were later confirmed to be narcotics. On Sept. 20, De Wert, HSL-46
Det 1, and LEDET 101 intercepted a fishing vessel carrying more than
three metric tons of cocaine.

De Wert departed Mayport May 23 and stopped in Roatan, Honduras, for a
brief port visit, where De Wert Sailors enjoyed snorkeling and diving,
shopping and relaxing on the beach in Roatan&apos;s West Bay. Sailors also
participated in a community relations (COMREL) project where they
painted a portion of a public hospital and hosted ship tours for local
elementary school children.

Other port visits included Salaverry, Peru; Vasco Nunez de Balboa (VNB),
Panama; and Curacao, Netherlands Antilles. The port visits provided the
Sailors with liberty and a chance to experience the culture of the host
nations. The Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) team set up numerous
trips including tours of local temples in Salaverry, a white-water
rafting trip in VNB, and a beach trip and driving tour of the city in
Curacao.

In addition to the COMREL project in Roatan, De Wert Sailors volunteered
to repaint the wall of Severina Hernandez Elementary School in VNB in
August.&quot;My experience at the COMREL was gratifying and fulfilling,&quot;said
Aviation Warfare Systems Operator 2nd Class (AW/SW) Julius Jones.&quot;Everyone, students and teachers alike, jumped at the opportunity to
help unload supplies when we arrived and made us feel immediately welcome.&quot;De Wert also participated in Project Handclasp, donating four pallets
containing more than 1,000 lbs. of donated goods to a local hospital and
several local clinics in Roatan and two pallets containing more than 500
lbs. of donated goods to the school children of Severina Hernandez
Elementary School in VNB. Project Handclasp is a U.S. Navy program which
coordinates the transportation and delivery of hygienic and educational
material to needy recipients throughout the world.

During the deployment, De Wert was under operational control of U.S.
Naval Forces Southern Command (NAVSO)/U.S. 4th Fleet conducting
counter-illicit trafficking operations for Joint Interagency Task
Force-South in the Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) area of focus. Once the
ship returned to Mayport, U.S. 2nd Fleet took over operational control

NAVSO, the naval component command of SOUTHCOM, directs U.S. Naval
Forces operating in the Caribbean, Central and South American regions
and interacts with partner nation navies within the maritime
environment. Various operations include counter-illicit trafficking,
theater security cooperation, humanitarian assistance and disaster
relief, military-to-military interaction and bilateral and multinational
training.

Fourth Fleet is the numbered fleet assigned to NAVSO, exercising
operational control of assigned forces in the SOUTHCOM area of focus.

NNS081009-01. MCPON Sends Birthday Message To Fleet&gt;From the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy

WASHINGTON (NNS) -- On the occasion of the U.S. Navy&apos;s 233rd Birthday,
the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy Joe R. Campa Jr. sends the
following message to the fleet.&quot;My fellow Sailors, just as we do every year to celebrate our Navy&apos;s
birthday, on Oct. 13 we will pause to reflect on the sacrifices made by
our forefathers and by Sailors who have built the foundation upon which
we serve.

We will talk of men with names like Jones, Black, Brashear and Nimitz.
We will recall great battles and bow our heads in memory of shipmates
lost aboard ships like Arizona, Forrestal and Cole. Our birthday is a
time to honor all who have contributed to the traditions and history of
our great Navy.

But it is also a day to recognize the service of a generation of Sailor
unlike any other.

It&apos;s not just the naval heroes we read about in history books who have
shaped our heritage. All of you are doing that every day on the
deckplate. Aboard USS Ross, there&apos;s a fireman recruit who works down in
Main Engine Room Number 1. GSMFR Rehnquist Wright&apos;s been in the Navy
just over a year. He&apos;s from Macon, Georgia, and along with him and his
shipmates aboard Ross, we celebrate our culture, the attitude and the
enduring spirit of the United States Sailor. It&apos;s a spirit that was born
at sea and cannot be replicated.

On our birthday we celebrate who we are and what we do with Sailors like
him, working and thriving on the deckplates of our Navy. Fireman Wright
may not be the most seasoned engineer on board, but he has the attitude
and the swagger that has come to define us as Sailors. Ask his shipmates
aboard Ross and they&apos;ll tell you the pride he takes in finding a way to
get the job done.

Fireman Wright is living a Sailor&apos;s ethos of ship, shipmate, self
because that is who we are. That&apos;s what we hold ourselves to and it
defines us, as it has for 233 years. Because of Sailors like him, and
like you, I don&apos;t see that ethos ever-changing.

It is up to every one of us to keep that attitude and culture alive. We
will preserve those traditions that are unique to the Navy, and we must
never lose sight of who we truly are. Every one of you shoulders the
responsibility of sustaining our heritage and moving our service
forward. I have confidence that you will because of the pride and honor
associated with being a United States Sailor.&quot;For more news from Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy, visit

NNS081008-10. Supreme Court Hears Navy Sonar Case&gt;From the Department of the Navy

WASHINGTON (NNS) -- The Supreme Court heard oral argument Oct. 8
regarding the Navy&apos;s use of active sonar during major training exercises
in Southern California.&quot;This case is important to our Navy and our nation&apos;s security. I
appreciate the Supreme Court&apos;s willingness to take the case and afford
us the opportunity to be heard this morning,&quot;stated the Secretary of
the Navy, Donald C. Winter.

The U.S. Solicitor General, Gregory G. Garre, opened his argument before
the nine Supreme Court justices, stating that the Navy&apos;s training is
vitally important to Navy strike groups deployed around the world and to
our national security.

On behalf of the Navy and Department of Commerce, the U.S. Solicitor
General, in his merits brief, challenged the restrictions imposed by the
lower courts. The Navy&apos;s position is that the lower court&apos;s decision is
legally erroneous and conflicts with the judgment of Congress, the
President and the nation&apos;s top naval officers. The preliminary
injunction prevents Navy strike groups from conducting realistic
training with mid-frequency active (MFA) sonar off the coast of Southern
California.

The U.S. District Court in Los Angeles handed down its original ruling
in August 2007 and, in January 2008, imposed burdensome training
restrictions that the Navy determined would unacceptably put the Navy&apos;s
ability to deploy trained strike groups at risk. These included a
requirement to shut down sonar altogether when marine mammals are within
2,200 yards of any sonar source and to reduce sonar power by 75 percent
when the Navy detects significant surface ducting conditions, whether or
not a marine mammal is present. Surface ducting conditions are
characterized by a mixed layer of constant water temperature extending
at least 100 feet below the surface.

The 2,200-yard shutdown zone is 11 times greater than the existing
shutdown distance that the Navy developed in consultation with the
National Marine Fisheries Service.

The requirement to reduce sonar power by 75 percent during significant
surface ducting conditions, whether or not a marine mammal is present,
will prevent Navy strike groups from conducting training to detect
submarines in the same conditions in which submarines seek to hide.

The district court ruling was affirmed by the Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals Feb. 29. The Supreme Court agreed to review the case June 23,
which led to the oral argument.

The Navy strives to reduce the environmental impacts of its training and
to promote environmental stewardship while effectively conducting
operations that are essential to national security. During
anti-submarine warfare active sonar training, the Navy implements dozens
of different measures to protect marine mammals established by the Navy
in cooperation with National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA). Beyond environmental compliance, the Navy also is
a world leader in marine mammal research. The Navy recently invested $25
million toward several research goals. For example, the Navy is
researching the distribution and abundance of protected marine species
and their habitats and is working to improve the understanding of the
effects of sound on marine mammals.

The Navy must conduct realistic anti-submarine warfare training by using
active sonar at sea to prepare sonar operators for combat. The acoustic
complexity of the ocean environment, particularly in shallow water areas
where the Navy hunts for quiet diesel submarines, makes real-world
training a necessity. Even the best simulators cannot effectively
emulate the underwater environment. When Navy men and women go into
harm&apos;s way, they need to be trained and ready.

While the case remains in the Supreme Court pending decision, the Navy
and the Department of Commerce continue to prepare an environmental
impact statement (EIS) that will analyze training with mid-frequency
active sonar as part of a more comprehensive study of training in the
Southern California operating area to ensure continued compliance with
environmental regulations in that area. The EIS is expected to be
completed in December.

Adm. Gary Roughead, Chief of Naval Operations, had this to say in
reflection of the day&apos;s events,&quot;I appreciate the work the Department of
Justice has done in moving this vital issue forward, and I am pleased
the Supreme Court heard the case today. A well-trained Navy is key to
defending our security and prosperity.&quot;All briefs are available at: http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/oct08.shtml#winter For more news from around the fleet, visit www.navy.mil.

NNS081009-10. Lincoln Strike Group Returns to San Diego, Air Wing Departs

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SW/AW) James Seward, Fleet
Public Affairs Center, Pacific

SAN DIEGO (NNS) -- The Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group pulled into
San Diego Oct. 8, after a seven-month deployment supporting maritime
security operations in 5th and 7th Fleet areas of operation.

Sailors and aircraft from Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 2 disembarked the
strike group&apos;s flag ship USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72). The ship will get
underway Oct. 9 to return to her homeport of Everett, Wash.&quot;There is no greater feeling in the world than coming back home safe and
sound after a long and challenging deployment,&quot;said Senior Chief
Aviation Structural Mechanic (AW/SW) Woody Behrends, of Helicopter
Anti-Submarine Squadron (HS) 2.&quot;In that regard, we have the best job in
the world.&quot;During its deployment, Abraham Lincoln worked alongside coalition
partners in the 5th Fleet area of responsibility. The strike group,
along with CVW 2 successfully flew more than 7,100 sorties and completed
more than 22,000 flying hours, supporting coalition ground forces.&quot;Getting everybody back safely after such a strenuous mission half way
around the world is a great accomplishment,&quot;said Cmdr. Terrance Hoeft,
commanding officer of HS-2.&quot;All of our hard work had led up to this
moment, and it really puts everything into perspective.&quot;In addition to their port visit to San Diego, Abraham Lincoln will host
a change-of-command ceremony Oct. 9, when Rear Adm. Scott H. Swift will
relieve Rear Adm. Scott R. Van Buskirk as commander, Carrier Strike
Group 9, before departing San Diego for Everett.

NNS081009-07. NAVFAC ESC Invests in Energy Savings, Conservation

By Darrell Waller, Naval Facilities Engineering Command Public Affairs

PORT HUENEME, CALIF. (NNS) -- The Naval Facilities Engineering Command&apos;s
Engineering Service Center (NAVFAC ESC) awarded a $250 million contract
Sept. 4 to three private firms to support the Advance Metering
Infrastructure Program (AMI) at facilities worldwide.

The AMI Program allows the Navy and Marine Corps to monitor and control
daily energy usage at military installations, ensuring cost-efficient
allocation of energy resources, including water, gas, steam, electricity
and other commodities. The solution is an AMI network that provides
two-way communication from the advanced meter (solid-state, IP enabled,
open standards) to a meter data management center.&quot;This program is part of the Navy&apos;s ongoing commitment to achieving the
energy efficiency goals specified by Presidential Executive Orders, the
Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act
of 2007,&quot;said Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center Commanding
Officer, Capt. Gregory J. Zielinski.&quot;Those strategic directives and
policies are crucial to bringing the nation closer to the desired goal
of total energy independence. More importantly, they mean better
utilization of our existing energy resources and translate to huge
benefits and cost savings for our warfighters and taxpayers.&quot;American Systems, Chantilly, Va.; Square D, Palatine, Ill.; and Weston
Solutions, San Antonio, Texas, will share the $250 million award, one of
the highest ever for a military energy management project. Each of the
three selected contractors will design, test, procure, install and
maintain numerous advanced metering solutions at naval shore facilities
globally through September 2013. Funding is concurrent through that date.

The Engineering Service Center is responsible for managing, through
NAVFAC, the Navy&apos;s AMI Program for the Commander, Naval Installations
Command.

NNS081009-06. Bonhomme Richard on Course for Successful INSURV

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Drew Williams and Mass
Communication Specialist 3rd Class(SW/AW) Jeffrey Gabriel, USS Bonhomme
Richard Public Affairs

SAN DIEGO (NNS) -- The crew of the amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme
Richard (LHD 6) is working diligently in preparation for its Board of
Inspection and Survey (INSURV) inspection, less than a month away.

A team of INSURV inspectors will spend a week aboard Bonhomme Richard
starting Nov. 3 to conduct the in-depth inspection of the ship, required
every five years.

The Board of Inspection and Survey was established by Congress to ensure
that U.S. Navy ships are properly equipped for prompt, reliable,
sustained mission readiness at sea. They inspect Navy ships and material
and report their findings directly to Congress.&quot;[INSURV members] validate that we are keeping this ship maintained, so
we can take a fully-operational warship to sea and carry out our
mission,&quot;said Cmdr. Michael R. Dickson, Bonhomme Richard operations
officer and INSURV coordinator.&quot;We are less than 30 days till INSURV and right on schedule,&quot;Dickson
continued.&quot;We&apos;ve been working to make certain that all compartments,
all spaces and all pieces of equipment match a check-list for their
operational guidance.&quot;Bonhomme Richard began planning for INSURV in February, while carrying
out its operational commitments, including participation in this
summer&apos;s Rim of the Pacific exercise.

All around the ship, Bonhomme Richard Sailors are making great strides
to ensure their ship is in the best condition ever. Machinist&apos;s Mate 1st
Class (SW/AW) Brent Richardson explained the hard work and dedication
the crew is putting in toward INSURV will pay off come November.&quot;Engineering has been working very aggressive six-on and six-off
schedules to match the work that needs completion, such as correcting
deficiencies with the steam-driven fire-flushing pumps,&quot;said
Richardson, a native of Wichita, Kan.&quot;We have also received lots of
training to keep Sailors both knowledgeable and motivated. We are
confident that our equipment will perform to its highest potential
during evaluation, spotlighting all of our hard work.&quot;Boatswain&apos;s Mate 2nd Class(SW) Emerson Harris noted the deck department
is also putting in long hours, preserving the ship and training personnel.&quot;It is important that we train our team for INSURV,&quot;said Harris, a
native of Rocky Mountain, N.C.&quot;Preparing and qualifying personnel will definitely ensure a smooth
inspection process. Even though we&apos;re putting in long hours, we have
made good use of our time and expect nothing less than success.&quot;Bonhomme Richard&apos;s Commanding Officer, Capt. Neil Parrott praised the
crew for their hard work and dedication in preparing for INSURV.&quot;I am extremely proud of everyone&apos;s efforts getting Bonhomme Richard
ready for this critical five-year inspection,&quot;he said.&quot;There&apos;s no
doubt in my mind that we are thoroughly prepared to put the ship through
its paces on inspection day. The opening line on every post-INSURV
report states &apos;The ship was/was not well prepared for this inspection.&apos;
I know we will show as being prepared. We&apos;ll certainly have some issues,
but I believe our advance preparation and hard work will get us through
this comprehensive inspection with favorable marks.&quot;For more news from USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD 6), visit

NNS081009-03. FASOTRAGRULANT Disestablishes, Celebrates Nearly 60 Years
of Training Excellence

By Kaylee LaRocque, Naval Air Station Jacksonville Public Affairs

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (NNS) -- Fleet Aviation Specialized Operational
Training Group, Atlantic Fleet, (FASOTRAGRULANT) Detachment Jacksonville
(Jax) was disestablished Oct. 1 and merged with the Center for Naval
Aviation Technical Training Unit (CNATTU).&quot;In 2002, there was an issue called the Revolution in Training where the
Navy started looking at programs to see where they could cut, merge and
consolidate training courses.&quot;At that time, the chief of naval operations mandated the consolidation
of training so if any training throughout the Navy was duplicated or
similar in structure, those training sites would be consolidated,&quot;explained Lt. Karensa Salazar, FASOTRUGRULANT officer-in-charge.&quot;That&apos;s what happened with us. The Naval Education Training Center had
some of the same programs we had through CNATTU. We both offer
maintenance training courses. The exception is that we also offered the
Undersea Warfare (USW) and Electronic Warfare (EW) training classes 
but those will continue to be taught through our new command,&quot;continued
Salazar.&quot;This has been a long process, and it&apos;s finally come to a
resolution.&quot;For the 38 military and civilian staff members, the changes will be
minimal.&quot;Most of our staff members keep their same office spaces. Our USW
division is moving to another building and should be up and running by
Oct. 15 when they get their computers online. The aviation maintenance
administration management division will remain in their same spaces.
Ultimately, the goal was for this to be a transparent shift, and I think
it&apos;s been pretty successful,&quot;Salazar said.

For the students, all the course numbers will remain the same; however,
the way they sign up for classes has changed as quota control will now
be handled through CNATTU.&quot;In the past, our staff has been extremely flexible in offering courses
because the goal of FASOTRAGRULANT was to provide training to everyone
whenever they needed it. Students will still be able to get the training
they need; however, quota control will be more structured,&quot;Salazar
emphasized.

Nearly 3,000 students have passed through the doors of FASOTRAGRULANT
Det Jax each year. Although most come from Naval Air Station Jax
squadrons, the detachment trains anyone in the Air Force Atlantic
domain. Occasionally, students also come from foreign military branches
after going through a thorough screening process.&quot;FASOTRAGRULANT is one of those places that many people don&apos;t seem to
know about, but what is offered here affects everyone. The courses
offered here are a huge part of readiness for operational squadrons,&quot;continued Salazar.&quot;Squadrons are training to maintain readiness and be
successful in the operational world. Most everyone comes through here at
some point in their career.&quot;Whether it&apos;s part of the initial training pipeline for those new to the
fleet or as part of refresher training, this is the place to learn
everything there is to know about the current technologies on how to
maintain Navy aircraft.

FASOTRAGRULANT Det Jax was established in 1949 as part of Fleet Airborne
Electronics Training Unit, Atlantic headquartered in Norfolk. Other
detachments were located in Norfolk; Brunswick, Maine; and Cherry Point,
N.C. Its name officially changed in 1972 to better describe the mission
of the command which included familiarization, indoctrination and
refresher training in the specialized operational and tactical
employment of weapons systems and equipment as well as conducting
survival, evasion, resistance and escape (SERE) training and other
specialized training.

NNS081009-08. Seabees Turn Landfill into Soccer Field in Romania

By Engineering Aide 3rd Class (SCW) Drew Huskey, Naval Mobile
Construction Battalion 4 Public Affairs

MIHAIL KOGLNICEANU, Romania (NNS) -- Seabees from Naval Mobile
Construction Battalion (NMCB) 4 recently broke ground at a local dump
site to begin construction of a new soccer field for the local community.

Located in the same town as the Mihail Kogalniceanu Air Base that
supports Joint Task ForceEast exercises, the completed soccer field
will further enable the relationship between U.S. forces and local
Romanian people expected to flourish through the spirit of sports.

Valer Losif Muresan, mayor of Mihail Koglniceanu, identified this
project for the U.S. forces as a gesture of goodwill to aide in the
beautification of the Romanian town. When complete, the site that once
was a local dumping area will re-emerge as an artificial turf soccer
field and serve as a focal point for the community.

The Seabees were more than willing to help with the construction of a
horizontal pitch. Since the site for the soccer field is positioned on
the side of a hill, the Seabee crew is now in the process of cutting
down roughly seven feet of hillside to level the playing field. Once the
site is leveled out and compacted, it will then be finished off with an
artificial playing surface.&quot;It&apos;s an equipment operator&apos;s paradise,&quot;said Equipment Operator 2nd
Class Jacob Stahl.&quot;Every day I get to play in the dirt with a lot of
different equipment, and one day this will be a great site for local
kids to play at every day.&quot;NMCB 4&apos;s goal is to create a beautiful new soccer field for everyone to
use and enjoy, inevitably helping the local community and leaving a
positive impact on the ongoing partnership between Romania and the
United States. The project is scheduled for completion in December
before the holidays.

NMCB 4 is deployed in support of Joint Task Force-East conducting
humanitarian and exercise-related construction in Romania.

NNS081009-05. Sailors Bring Toys, Smiles to Children at Belpasso Orphanage

By Mass Communication Specialist Whitfield Palmer, Fleet Public Affairs
Center, Det. Sigonella

SIGONELLA, Sicily (NNS) -- Sailors from the Explosive Ordnance Disposal
Mobile Unit (EODMU) 8 at Naval Air Station in Sigonella, Sicily, toys
and clothes to children at the Giovanni Sapa Orphanage in Belpasso,
Sicily, Oct. 3.

The multi-organization effort pulled together the fundraising resources
of the Red Cross, Sigonella Animal Welfare Society, and the Navy Marine
Corps Relief Society, according to Explosive Ordnance Disposal 1st Class
Kenneth C. Cummings.

The Giovanni Sapa Orphanage provides shelter for orphaned children as
well as parenting assistance to single mothers.&quot;The Sailors participating today are not just doing this for an
evaluation bullet,&quot;said Cummings.&quot;It&apos;s all about paying it forward and
making a difference in the lives of these kids and ultimately the
community at large.&quot;&quot;It&apos;s awesome to see the reaction from these kids in need,&quot;says
Explosive Ordnance Disposal 1st Class Demetrius O&apos;Halloran.

NNS081009-04. Elementary Students Learn Fire, Earthquake Safety in Yokosuka

By Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Kari R. Bergman, Fleet Public
Affairs Center Det., Japan

YOKOSUKA, Japan (NNS) -- Students from The Sullivans Elementary School
aboard Commander, Fleet Activities Yokosuka (CFAY) learned fire safety
and earthquake survival techniques Oct. 7, during Fire Prevention Month
activities held at Commander, U.S. Naval Forces, Japan (CNFJ) Regional
Fire Department.&quot;We give this training to the students at the elementary school every
October,&quot;said Yuko Hasegawa, chief fire inspector at the CNFJ Regional
Fire Department.&quot;The new thing this year is the earthquake simulator,
used to show the students what an actual earthquake feels like.&quot;The realistic hands-on approach was a hit with the students and their
teachers.&quot;I think that the earthquake simulator is a great addition, because
instead of just doing duck-and-cover drills in the classrooms, the kids
get hands-on training so that they will know what to do during an actual
earthquake,&quot;said Michael Applegate, a fourth grade teacher.

The regional fire department has a handful of events scheduled
throughout October, including fire extinguisher training and a
smoke-filled house scenario.&quot;We also have a smoke house, which is made up like a home that allows
the children to learn how to safely put out a kitchen fire,&quot;Hasegawa
said.&quot;They also learn how to safely escape from a second floor room if
they are stuck and if a door is hot and there is no window to escape
from; they learn how to seal the door and then signal to the
firefighters where they are located.&quot;Hasegawa noted many children have never experienced real emergencies and
might not be able to respond appropriately without the training.&quot;We are giving this fire and earthquake training to the children so that
if they ever find themselves in that type of situation, they will know
how to handle it and not panic,&quot;said Hasegawa.&quot;Also, adding the
earthquake simulator really helps with the children, because Japan is an
earthquake-prone area, and a lot of the children might have never felt
an earthquake before living here.&quot;For more news from Commander Fleet Activities Yokosuka, visit

NNS081008-09. Navy Region Hawaii Commemorates Domestic Violence
Awareness Month

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Michael A. Lantron,
Commander, Navy Region Hawaii Public Affairs

PEARL HARBOR (NNS) -- Navy Region Hawaii Fleet and Family Service Center
(FFSC) held a ceremony to commemorate Domestic Violence Awareness Month
Oct. 6

During the ceremony, Capt. Donald Hodge, chief of staff for Commander,
Navy Region Hawaii and Commander, Naval Surface Group Middle Pacific,
signed a Domestic Violence Awareness Month proclamation to call upon all
Navy personnel and their families to increase their awareness and
participation in efforts to prevent domestic abuse.&quot;It&apos;s important because it helps us figure out how to prevent domestic
violence from happening,&quot;said Hodge.&quot;Our attempt has been to bring it
in to focus to show how hurtful it is for domestic violence to happen
and what the impact is to the children of those homes.&quot;Hodge, who also received a Hawaii Senate Certificate of Commendation
commending Navy Region Hawaii on observing October as Domestic Violence
Awareness Month, noted the importance of others in preventing domestic
violence.&quot;The focus must be to prevent the violence from happening in the first
place by recognizing what might be the problems in the home,&quot;said
Hodge.&quot;If someone sees domestic violence happening anywhere, don&apos;t just
let it go, do something about it,&quot;he added.

More than 1.5 million women are raped or physically assaulted by their
current or former spouse and Domestic Violence Awareness Month helps
bring this to the forefront.&quot;The importance is to bring it to peoples&apos; minds,&quot;said Chet Adessa,
Family Advocacy Prevention and Education Specialist for Navy Region
Hawaii FFSC.&quot;Throughout the year, we forget about it [domestic
violence], but this month pulls people together and reminds us that we
all need to take part in this and recommit ourselves to preventing
domestic violence.&quot;Adessa also discussed the importance of other people in the community
taking a stance to help prevent domestic violence and help others who
are affected by it.&quot;If someone sees a person hurting or notice bruises that aren&apos;t normal,
they should reach out to them and offer help,&quot;said Adessa.&quot;For a
victim of domestic violence, knowing that someone does care and there is
a way out of their situation is one of the biggest things.&quot;Domestic Violence Awareness Month was first commemorated in 1987.
Federal, state and local organizations and agencies join forces to
promote public awareness of the problem and prevention of domestic
violence and its harmful effects on our families and shift focus on
preventing domestic violence.

NNS081010-11. SECNAV Sends Birthday Message to Fleet&gt;From the Secretary of the Navy

WASHINGTON (NNS) -- The Secretary of the Navy, Donald C. Winter released
the following birthday message to the fleet in anticipation of the
Navy&apos;s 233rd birthday.&quot;On 13 October 1775, the Continental Congress voted on a resolution to
commission a swift sailing vessel with a crew of 80 men and ten carriage
guns to embark on a three-month cruise intercepting transports carrying
munitions and supplies to British troops in America. The resolution also
called for a second vessel to be outfitted for the same purpose. The
resolution passed, and the U.S. Navy was born.

Today, 233 years later, the original Navy fleet of two ships has evolved
into the most powerful Navy in the world. The one constant across the
years has been the Sailors who have made our Navy great. In my time as
Secretary, I have come to appreciate more than ever what distinguishes
our Navy from others around the world - the professionalism, training
and quality of our Sailors. The standard of excellence of our Sailors is
truly what put our Navy head and shoulders above the rest.

The quality of our people was already a notable characteristic of the
U.S. Navy 100 years ago when President Theodore Roosevelt sent sixteen
battleships, with their hulls painted white, on a voyage around the
world. The Great White Fleet, as it is known, traveled to six
continents, making 20 port calls over a period of 14 months. The cruise
was both an announcement that America was now a global naval power and
displayed an unprecedented initiative in diplomatic outreach and engagement.

Today we continue to build on the legacy of the Great White Fleet by
working with partners to deter aggressors and prevent war, securing the
world&apos;s waterways for commerce, providing aid where needed to victims of
natural disasters, and supporting wartime missions in Iraq and
Afghanistan. As always, you are the key factor - the Sailors who operate
our ships, submarines, and aircraft, who engage with other nations and
who come to the rescue of those in need from Haiti to Galveston to Beirut.

As we look to the future, the U.S. Navy remains an essential element of
national power. Let us celebrate our many achievements and rededicate
ourselves to the great and worthy cause of service in the United States
Navy. On this 233rd birthday of the United States Navy, take pride in
knowing that your service and sacrifice honors our great heritage and
continues to provide the freedom and strength of our great Nation.

Thank you for your service, and may God bless you, your families, and
our nation.&quot;For more news from around the fleet, visit www.navy.mil.

NNS081010-19. Project to Save $32 Million in Energy Costs

By Cathy Heimer, Naval Air Station Oceana Public Affairs

VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (NNS) -- The Energy Saving Performance Contract
(ESPC) was completed at Naval Air Station (NAS) Oceana Dam Neck Annex
and officially opened with a ribbon-cutting ceremony Oct. 9 after 22
months of construction.

A partnership between the Navy, Trane and the Hampton Roads Sanitation
District (HRSD), ESPC will save the Department of the Navy nearly $32
million over the 17-year life of the contract. The new system, which is
funded entirely through operational savings, includes upgrades to 36
buildings at Dam Neck with new geothermal water source heat pumps. The
updated equipment replaces the old, inefficient central steam plant,
which required above-ground pipes across the base to deliver heat.

The project involved more than 25 subcontractors and 130,000-man hours
of work and was accomplished with zero safety incidents and no time lost
from the job.&quot;This is a win-win-win relationship for HRSD, Trane and especially the
Sailors on the base,&quot;said NAS Oceana Executive Officer Capt. Mark Rich
during the ribbon-cutting ceremony.

Rich noted how the new system will provide better reliability and better
performance of the heating and cooling systems across Dam Neck. By
removing all above-ground steam lines which previously crisscrossed Dam
Neck, Rich said, the base looks nicer.

Dam Neck&apos;s older buildings also challenged the previous system.&quot;Summer is tough on the Sailors because the age of the buildings is
significant. Sailors bear a lot of the burden when they spend the nights
with no AC and have to go back to work the next day,&quot;said Rich.&quot;We&apos;re
exceptionally happy to have this, and we&apos;re looking forward to enjoying
the benefits of it.&quot;Capt. John Edwards, executive officer for Naval Engineering Facilities
Command, Mid-Atlantic noted the dedication&apos;s timing coincided with
October being Energy Awareness Month. NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic manages the
energy savings programs at naval facilities in the Mid-Atlantic region.

Edwards, who also serves the chairman of the Regional Energy Management
Council in Hampton Roads, said the ESPC at Dam Neck is&quot;one of the major
components&quot;of projects under consideration to revitalize the energy-use
strategy within the Mid-Atlantic Region.

This Energy Savings Performance Contract is also in place at NAS Oceana
and Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek. Edwards said with the new Dam
Neck ESPC, the Navy is saving more than $5 million each year in Hampton
Roads by having the newer, more energy efficient equipment installed.

Edwards explained future projects will also focus on awareness, use of
renewable resources such as&quot;green resources,&quot;working on demand
reduction to change the users&apos; behavior and improved communication with
the various commands by providing more information to commanding and
executive officers about what&apos;s taking place at their commands.&quot;This is a great project. It&apos;s done a lot for the Navy, a lot for NAS
Oceana. It really shows an outstanding partnership, when we have shared
interests between the Navy and a great partner like Trane and a great
municipality working with all the cities like HRSD,&quot;said Edwards.

The HRSD representative, John J. Dano, was also very enthusiastic about
the partnership between the three groups.&quot;HRSD is very excited about partnering with the Navy and Trane on this
energy savings project. This project coincides with HRSD&apos;s goals to
minimize our environmental impact,&quot;said Dano.

For many years, HRSD has maintained a pipe buried deep underground Dam
Neck to pump water from their treatment facility offshore. Construction
of the Dam Neck project came at the same time HRSD was also upgrading
their nearby Atlantic Treatment Plant.&quot;HRSD strives to be a good neighbor, and we have many facilities that
are in close proximity to Navy installations. We are proud to partner
with the Navy and Trane on the Dam Neck project, and we hope to partner
again on future projects,&quot;Dano concluded.

Following the ribbon-cutting, Howard Turner from Virginia Trane
conducted a tour of the facility which contains a section of the 10
miles of large, blue pipes and the heat exchangers. In the past, the
water was cooled for the air conditioning by&quot;chillers,&quot;positioned
outside of each building. Turner said due to the continuous maintenance
needed, the previous cooling equipment was hard to keep working.

The new system is a self-contained unit, which is entirely
computer-controlled and adjustable through the Internet.

Turner explained an important component of the performance contract.&quot;The Navy, with the money that it&apos;s saving, pays Trane to measure the
savings every year. If we don&apos;t make the savings for you, we write you a
check. It&apos;s truly a guarantee  we save you money or we write a check 
and we don&apos;t like to write checks.&quot;For more news from Naval Air Station Oceana, visit

NNS081009-11. Navy Accepts Delivery of Destroyer Stockdale

By Program Executive Officer Ships Public Affairs

BATH, Maine (NNS) -- The Navy accepted delivery of the guided-missile
destroyer Stockdale from General Dynamics Bath Iron Works during a
ceremony in Bath, Maine, Sept. 30.

Designated DDG 106, the new destroyer honors Medal of Honor recipient
Vice Adm. James Bond Stockdale (1923-2005), the legendary leader of
American prisoners of war (POWs) during the Vietnam War.

Stockdale is the 56th Arleigh Burke-class destroyer. The ship will be
able to conduct a variety of operations, from peacetime presence and
crisis management to sea control and power projection. Stockdale will be
capable of fighting air, surface and subsurface battles simultaneously
and contains a myriad of offensive and defensive weapons designed to
support maritime warfare. The ship can operate independently or as part
of carrier strike groups, surface action groups, amphibious ready groups
and underway replenishment groups. The ship&apos;s combat system centers
around the Aegis combat system and the SPY-lD(V), multi-function phased
array radar.

Cmdr. Frederick W. Kacher, of Oakton, Va., is the prospective commanding
officer of the ship and will lead the crew of 276 officers and enlisted
personnel. The 9,200-ton Stockdale is being built by Bath Iron Works, a
General Dynamics Company.

The ship is 509 feet in length, has a waterline beam of 59 feet and a
navigational draft of 31 feet. Four gas turbine engines will power the
ship to speeds in excess of 30 knots.

Stockdale was the highest-ranking naval officer ever held as a POW in
North Vietnam. His plane was shot down Sept. 9, 1965, while flying
combat missions over North Vietnam. Stockdale spent more than seven
years in captivity at prisons in North Vietnam, including time at the
infamous&quot;Hanoi Hilton.&quot;Four of those years were spent in solitary
confinement.

While imprisoned, Stockdale is credited with organizing a set of rules
to govern the behavior of fellow POWs and for helping to develop a code
for prisoners to communicate with each other that included tapping on
cell walls. In recognition of his leadership and sacrifice he was
awarded the Medal of Honor in 1976.

NNS081010-16. Specialists Armed to Help Shipmates Face Financial Challenges

By Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Heather Hines, Commander Navy
Region Southwest Public Affairs

SAN DIEGO (NNS) -- Commander, Navy Region Southwest Fleet and Family
Support Center (FFSC) sponsored a seminar Oct. 2 in hopes of providing
additional resources and expanding the knowledge of command financial
specialist (CFS).

As the nation continues to experience various events that could have a
negative impact on individual financial standings, approximately 60 San
Diego-based CFSs attended the session which featured guest speaker Dan
Iannicola, Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Office of Financial
Education at the Treasury Department and Jeff Toney of Troops Against
Predatory Scams (TAP$).

Some consumers, according to Iannicola, are confused about why they may
pay a different rate for the same item another person may purchase. Just
like making a purchase at a fast food restaurant, most consumers feel
they should pay the same price as the customer in line ahead of him.
With credit, that is not always true.&quot;When you get to the counter and say, &apos;I&apos;ll have what he had,&apos; and the
cashier tells you $10 and (the previous customer) paid $5, most people
feel that is not right. With credit, we can do that. Is it
discrimination? Yes, but it&apos;s a legalized way of basing things on your
credit standings,&quot;he said.

Iannicola added that consumers need to be especially mindful of not only
credit scores but of the long-term effects of making purchases using
credit cards.&quot;The problem is all debt is not the same. If you charge a $14 pizza on
credit card, over a 4-year period you have paid upwards of $90 for that
pie,&quot;Iannicola said.

A bad credit score can even affect employment.&quot;If you are in really bad debt you may even run the risk of employers
not offering you a job because of what bad decision you may have made in
the past, said Iannicola.&quot;The training armed CFSs with new tools and arguments to encourage
Sailors to live within their means, control their budgets and avoid
credit card debt.&quot;I hope that the command financial specialists will return to their
commands and pass the word to their shipmates that good financial health
is just as important as their physical readiness,&quot;Carl Weiscopt,
director FFSC, said about the event, supported by the Joint Task Force
on Financial Health.&quot;Whether it is improving their credit scores, learning how to save more
for purchases and retirement, getting the best deal on a used car,
finding out about other resources to stretch their budget or discussing
how to better manage their money (spending plan), the CFS and [Navy
Region Southwest] FFSC financial educators are here to assist them.&quot;The session, held in direct support of Joint Task Force on Financial
Health, also covered topics relating to predatory lending and the
looming housing market.

Weiscopt added that with enough planning, Sailors will be able to
prevent adverse actions.&quot;They also need to discuss their financial issues with the chain of
command early so leadership can engage and assist them with the issues
before they become major challenges.&quot;The Joint Task Force on Financial Health (Southwest) is a group of
military leaders and civilian financial experts tasked by Commander,
Navy Region Southwest to find ways to improve the financial health of
Sailors, Marines and their dependents.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (NNS) -- Naval Facilities Engineering Command
(NAVFAC) Southeast met with the Clay County Leadership Class of 2008 on
board Naval Air Station (NAS) Jacksonville Oct. 7.

A diverse group of community leaders meets each year to learn about the
military&apos;s mission in the Jacksonville area. Installation leaders
discuss current and future plans affecting North Florida residents. The
group heard presentations from leadership at Patrol Squadron(VP) 30,
NAVFAC Southeast, NAS Jacksonville and the Marines Blount Island Command.

Capt. Mark W. Jackson, NAVFAC Southeast executive officer, provided a
brief overview describing what NAVFAC does locally as well as globally
-- where they came from, who they do business with and what they bring
to the local community as far as economic growth.&quot;We are a largely civilian command,&quot;said Jackson.&quot;Over 500 of our
1,700 employees live in the Jacksonville area.&quot;NAVFAC Southeast may appear to be small in size, but they did more than
$2.4 billion in business volume during fiscal year 2008. In looking at
the local area (Jacksonville, Mayport, and Kings Bay) they contribute
roughly $482 million to the community through salaries, utilities,
construction and service contracts. The construction projects alone
bring in several hundred job opportunities to the local community.&quot;We are mostly comprised of professional engineers, architects and
program managers,&quot;said Jackson.&quot;We have hired over 600 employees
during the past two years, and we are still hiring. We want to hire the
best of the best.&quot;NAVFAC Southeast plans, designs and manages construction for the Navy.

NNS081010-13. Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group Completes
Multinational Exercise

By Lt. j.g. Michael P. Quisao, USS Theodore Roosevelt Public Affairs

USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT, At Sea (NNS) -- Ships from the Theodore
Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group (TR CSG), assigned to Commander U.S. 6th
Fleet, participated in a one-day theater security cooperation (TSC)
exercise with units from the South African and French navies while
underway in the Indian Ocean Oct. 9.

The Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN 71) (TR)
and the guided-missile cruiser USS Monterey (CG 61) operated with three
South African ships and one French Navy ship in a variety of tactical
exercises aimed at increasing coordination and interoperability.

The TSC exercise consisted of tactical communications, coordinated
shiphandling maneuvers and an aerial photo shoot of the ships in
formation, highlighting the growing interaction between the U.S. and
South African navies.&quot;It was a pleasure working with the South African Navy during this
seamanship exercise. Their skills were superb,&quot;said Rear Adm. Frank
Pandolfe, commander, Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group.&quot;This
exercise demonstrates our shared desire for security and stability in
the region and is an important step toward strengthening the
capabilities needed to achieve those goals.&quot;TR and Monterey were joined by the South African Navy frigate SAS
Isandlwana (F146), oiler SAS Drakensburg (A301), patrol boat SAS Isaac
Dyobia (P1565), and the French Navy frigate FN Floreal (F730) for the
multinational exercise.

This exercise follows TR&apos;s historic port visit to Cape Town, marking the
first carrier visit to South Africa in more than 40 years. During the
port visit, TR and Monterey (CG 61) hosted thousands of visitors,
participated in multiple regional security cooperation activities and
completed community relations activities.

TRCSG is conducting operations in the U.S. 6th Fleet area of
responsibility.

NNS081010-02. Seabees Strengthen Bond, Upgrade Water System in Djibouti

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SCW/SW/AW) Ronald Gutridge,
Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 4 Det HOA Public Affairs





NAGAD, Djibouti (NNS) -- A crew of six Seabees attached to Naval Mobile
Construction Battalion (NMCB) 4, based out of Naval Base Ventura County,
Calif., completed construction on a new water distribution system for
Nagad Village Sept. 27.

The project upgraded the village&apos;s existing system and will supply
cleaner and safer water as well as a separate water access point for the
village animals.

The project replaced the existing system which consisted of multiple
faucets which the villagers used by connecting hoses to them and then
running the hoses to their homes. The system leaked severely, which
produced puddles of water and mud, thus creating a breeding ground for
mosquitoes. Mosquitoes carry malaria, a vector-borne infectious disease
that is widespread in Africa. It kills between one and three million
people each year, mostly young children. The puddles also attracted
local goats, donkeys and camels which further contaminates the area.

The Seabees completed construction of a new concrete foundation and then
installed piping for 26 new faucets, eliminating the problems caused by
the leaks. They also installed two new 75-gallon water troughs for the
village animals so they will no longer drink from the same water system
used by village residents.&quot;The upgrades we completed will have a tremendous impact on the whole
community.&quot;said Construction Electrician Constructionman Apprentice
Douglas Sager.&quot;Knowing that [the Seabees] improved the quality of life
of so many people and receiving the many thanks from the locals makes
this project well worth the time and effort.&quot;For the residents of Nagad and the Seabees, this water distribution
system represents more than just clean water to drink. It strengthens
the bond between the United States and Djibouti.

NMCB 4 Detachment Horn of Africa is currently on a six-month deployment
supporting Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa and is completing
missions in various countries in Eastern Africa.

NNS081010-09. Peleliu Sailors Earn Quals, Haul Up Coveted ESWS Pennant

By Chief Mass Communication Specialist (SW/AW) Donnie Ryan, USS Peleliu
Public Affairs

USS PELELIU, At Sea (NNS) -- Quartermasters hauled up the Silver
Enlisted Surface Warfare Specialist (ESWS) Pennant high above USS
Peleliu (LHA 5) during a special ceremony Oct. 1.

The ESWS pennant joins the Silver Enlisted Aviation Warfare Specialist
(EAWS) Pennant and Gold Surface Warfare Officer (SWO) Pennant already
flying above Peleliu.

In order to fly the pennant, all Sailors E-5 and above who have been
aboard for at least 18 months must be ESWS qualified. This is often
challenging for an amphibious assault ship with a crew of more than
1,000 Sailors.

According to Senior Chief Crytoplogic Technician (Collection) (SW/AW)
Loren Rucker, Peleliu&apos;s ESWS coordinator, one of the first tasks of the
current deployment was to find out the warfare qualification status of
every enlisted Sailor in paygrades E-5 and above currently on board in
order to qualify for the pennant.&quot;Since deployment started, we have had 31 Sailors re-qualify and 117
Sailors received their initial qualification after holding 30 final
boards,&quot;said Rucker.

The ESWS qualification process involves learning all areas of the ship,
from how the ship receives supplies to explaining the components of a
steam cycle. Sailors must pass a written test and an oral board made up
of senior ESWS-qualified Sailors from each department on the ship. Final
approval must be received from the Sailors&apos; individual chains of command
in order to be designated as an enlisted surface warfare specialist.&quot;Earning your ESWS pin is a milestone in your career,&quot;added Rucker.&quot;It
is something that you wear with pride. It is also something that sets
you apart from your peers.&quot;Capt. Jon M. Padfield, commander, Amphibious Squadron 3, presented the
pennant to Peleliu&apos;s Commanding Officer, Capt. Marcus A. Hitchcock,
during the ceremony held on the ship&apos;s flight deck.

Sailors who earned their ESWS pin on the current deployment said that
there was a lot of hard work and extra study time involved in the process.&quot;I was fortunate enough to have a good chain of command that would let
me take time during my working hours to get my pin,&quot;said Information
Systems Technician 2nd Class (SW) Brandon McMurtrie, who was pinned
during the ceremony.&quot;I also put plenty of my off time into studying and
doing the walk-throughs.&quot;Peleliu is the flagship of the Peleliu Expeditionary Strike Group
(PELESG) and the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit which is conducting
operations in the U.S. 7th Fleet area of responsibility. The PELESG
departed San Diego May 4 on a scheduled deployment.

NNS081010-04. Elmo and Friends Help Make Deployments Easier for Navy Juniors

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class (SW) Kenneth R. Hendrix,
Fleet Public Affairs Center Atlantic

VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (NNS) -- Approximately 1,400 children and parents
attended three showings of The Sesame Street Experience for Military
Families at Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek Gator Theater Oct. 4.

The 25-minute, high-energy feature is part of a partnership with the
United Service Organization (USO) and&quot;Sesame Street&quot;National
Non-profit, the Sesame Street Workshop designed to help military
families around the country deal with the deployment of relatives.

According to Josh Bourqe, the show&apos;s performance director, Elmo and
friends entertained the children and service members while teaching
different ways to deal with the difficulties of saying &apos;good-bye&apos; to mom
or dad when they deploy.&quot;The show is part of our Talk, Listen and Connect series which started
in April,&quot;Bourqe said.&quot;The series provides resources and emotional
support as military families cope with the various stages of deployment:
pre-deployment, deployment and homecoming -- and the many challenges and
questions these stages present for young children.&quot;The Sesame Street Experience for Military Families brings the &apos;Talk,
Listen, Connect&apos; DVD and materials to life, directly to the families who
face the challenges of military life each day,&quot;Bourqe said.

As the crowds made their way through the doors and to their seats in the
theater, they were given outreach material created to inform and support
military families with young children who are experiencing the effects
of deployments or a parent who has suffered a combat-related injury.

Once everyone took their seats, the show kicked off with Elmo talking
the crowd.&quot;Do you ever miss your mommy or your daddy? Because Elmo feels the same
way when his daddy goes away.&quot;Children&apos;s faces sparkled with excitement throughout the performance as
the Muppets told recipes for turning frowns upside down.&quot;There&apos;s a lot of things you can do like reading books, drawing
pictures, writing letters, singing songs and dancing to feel better,&quot;Elmo said.

Elmo was followed by the rest of the&quot;Elmo and Friends&quot;crew. Cookie
Monster performed his classic hit&quot;C is for Cookie,&quot;while Rosita taught
the kids how to say&quot;happy&quot;and&quot;sad&quot;in Spanish. Grover got the crowd
going with his hip-hop dance moves, and all of the Muppets took turns
coming down off the stage to meet and greet children and offer
high-fives and hugs.&quot;We want to make the show as interactive with children as possible so
they get the whole experience,&quot;Bourqe said.&quot;It&apos;s fun and really
exciting for the characters as well. They love seeing the smiles and
laughter on children&apos;s faces and giving them hugs.&quot;Sarah McShane, whose husband, Culinary Specialist 1st Class Kevin
McShane is deployed on board USS Carter Hall (LSD 50), said she owns the
DVD already, and it was a nice treat to see the show live.&quot;My daughter watches the DVD all the time,&quot;McShane said.&quot;I think that
it helps ease the pain of when someone&apos;s loved one goes away on
deployment. Because it&apos;s coming from Elmo and Rosita, [it&apos;s] someone
they can relate to and understand. It makes it easier for them to
understand that their mom or dad will be coming back soon.&quot;The best thing of all is when my husband comes back, it&apos;s easier for
him to reconnect with his daughter,&quot;McShane said.

NNS081010-18. Iwo Jima ESG Sailors Take Advantage of NKO&apos;s Language Courses

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class (SW) Michael Starkey, Iwo
Jima Expeditionary Strike Group Public Affairs

USS IWO JIMA, At Sea (NNS) -- Sailors attached to the Iwo Jima
Expeditionary Strike Group (ESG) are taking advantage of the free,
online foreign language training materials available for active duty
Sailors, Reservists and Navy civilians recently announced by the Chief
of Naval Personnel.

Critical Language by Transparent Language is available for download
through Navy Knowledge Online (NKO) and offers a variety of languages
including Spanish, modern standard Arabic, Iraqi Arabic, Pashto, Persian
Farsi, Dari, Chinese-Mandarin, French and many others. Sailors are
encouraged to utilize this opportunity for personal and professional
development.&quot;I encourage our Sailors to take full advantage of the free language
courses offered through NKO,&quot;said Capt. Brian Smith, commander, Iwo
Jima ESG.&quot;Proficiency in additional languages widens the range of
people you can communicate with, opens doors of new opportunity and
contributes to personal development.&quot;Not only will learning a new language personally enhance Sailors, it may
also assist them in their Navy careers. Some Sailors in the Iwo Jima ESG
are already planning to take advantage of the language courses to help
prepare them for striking into the Cryptologic Technician Interpretative
(CTI) rating.&quot;I absolutely plan on taking advantage of the language courses offered
through NKO,&quot;said Personnel Specialist Seaman Ruth Pennock, a Sailor
assigned to the multi-purpose amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima (LHD
7).&quot;The great educational benefits offered by the Navy were of primary
consideration in my decision to enlist in the Navy.&quot;&quot;Starting a language course now will prepare me for striking into the
CTI rating by continuing to develop the basic skills and techniques
integral to successfully learning any new language,&quot;continued Pennock.&quot;My interest in the CTI rating is merely a natural outgrowth of my love
of languages, and it is my fervent wish that this love will translate
over to my naval career.&quot;Learning a new language proves beneficial to the Navy as well as
individual Sailors.&quot;My commitment to learning new languages is what I consider a win-win
situation for both myself and the U.S. Navy,&quot;said Pennock.&quot;I enjoy the
learning process, especially when it not only enhances my naval career
but provides the Navy with useful skills in its ongoing mission.&quot;The language courses offered are compatible with both Macintosh and
Windows computers and can be transferred to personal MP3 players.

The Iwo Jima Expeditionary Strike Group is deployed to the U.S. 5th
Fleet area of operations to conduct Maritime Security Operations (MSO).
MSOs help develop security in the maritime environment. From security
arises stability that results in global economic prosperity. MSO
complements the counterterrorism and security efforts of regional
nations and seek to disrupt violent extremists&apos; use of the maritime
environment as a venue for attack or to transport personnel, weapons or
other material.

NNS081010-03. School of Health Sciences Partners with Elementary School
to Make a Difference in Lives of Youth

By Chief Hospital Corpsman Charles Brett, Naval School of Health
Sciences Portsmouth Public Affairs

PORTSMOUTH, Va. (NNS) -- The Naval School of Health Sciences (NSHS),
Portsmouth, officially&quot;adopted&quot;Parkview Elementary School in
Portsmouth, during a ceremony held at the school Oct. 2.

Members of the NSHS staff will volunteer their time in events and
programs throughout the school year as part of the Navy&apos;s Partners in
Education program.

These efforts will include after-school tutoring, assisting faculty with
classroom activities, serving as positive role models for students and
volunteering in a pen pal writing program with students.&quot;Education is vital to success, and today&apos;s students should dream big
and realize that with quality education, those dreams can come true,&quot;said Capt. Susan Herron, NSHS commanding officer.

Herron signed&quot;adoption papers&quot;during the ceremony and presented a
plaque to Principal Gwendolyn Watkins to commemorate the event. She also
presented command coins to Vice Principal Cherly Wilson, Parent Teacher
Association President Deloris Haywood and Music Teacher Chris Morton.&quot;[The Navy surgeon general] refers to youth as the future of the
country,&quot;said Rear Adm. Richard Vinci, commander, Navy Medicine Support
Command.&quot;This latest volunteer program is just one of many examples of
how our people are supporting the Navy surgeon general&apos;s emphasis on
getting our military and civilian Navy medicine personnel out into the
local community in an effort to positively impact local youth.&quot;Vice Adm. Adam M. Robinson Jr., the Navy surgeon general, encourages
youth to succeed.&quot;Ever since I took office a year ago, I have travelled frequently across
America talking to and meeting young men and women who have the spirit
and drive to succeed. I tell these men and women, the future generation
who will occupy the boardrooms and wardrooms of this nation and our
military, about the importance of staying focused, staying busy and
leveraging the myriad of opportunities that lie ahead.&quot;NSHS volunteers have participated in local school volunteer projects in
the past, but the ceremony marked the first time NSHS Portsmouth has
adopted an entire school as the command&apos;s primary community service
project.&quot;The Naval School of Health Sciences has a long and storied history with
the City of Portsmouth and its public schools,&quot;Herron said.&quot;This city
has been our neighbor, friend and supporter. As a good neighbor, it is
time for us to give back to our community.&quot;Hospital Corpsman 1st Class Jessica Woodland, the NSHS Partners in
Education committee chairperson and an NSHS instructor who will
volunteer at the school, said she was excited about participating in the
program.&quot;It is an honor to be part of this collaboration between Parkview
Elementary and the Naval School of Health Sciences.&quot;The 15 NSHS volunteers began their work with Parkview Elementary before
the beginning of the school year. The volunteers donated $750 dollars
worth of backpacks and school supplies purchased with money raised
during local fundraisers and donation drives. NSHS staff spent three
weeks in August helping school faculty with classroom preparation,
library organization and other activities to ensure the school was able
to open without delay.

NNS081010-15. VS-32&quot;Maulers&quot;Disestablished

By Clark Pierce, Naval Air Station Jacksonville Public Affairs

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (NNS) -- Sailors, family members, retirees and
friends of VS-32 turned out to bid farewell to the command during its
disestablishment ceremony in Hangar 117 at NAS Jacksonville (NAS
Jax)Sept. 25.&quot;This is an event that brings us closer the end of our S-3 community.
The Maulers have always been one of the best-led and best-managed sea
control squadrons in the fleet,&quot;said Capt. Jim Paulsen, commander,
Carrier Air Wing 1 who was the guest speaker for the event.&quot;The S-3 sunset plan is part of the Navy&apos;s goal to streamline logistics
and squadron support. The idea was that our mission can be assumed by
other communities,&quot;stated VS-32 Commanding Officer Cmdr. Doug
Carpenter.&quot;But the legacy of our community and what this squadron has
accomplished will live on.&quot;He told the audience, including a dozen former VS-32 skippers, that the
Maulers will be remembered for their years of battle readiness and
safety in the S-3 community. The squadron earned 10 Commander, Naval Air
Force Atlantic (COMNAVAIRLANT) Battle&quot;E&quot;awards; six Capt. Arnold J.
Isbell trophies for excellence in anti-submarine warfare (ASW); six Adm.
Jimmy Thach awards for meritorious achievement by an ASW squadron; and
15 Chief of Naval Operations Safety&quot;S&quot;awards. The squadron also
received two Lockheed-Martin Golden Wrench awards for maintenance
excellence; a COMNAVAIRLANT Silver Anchor award for retention; and the
Arleigh Burke award for the most improved squadron.&quot;I can safely say that this squadron has sprinted to the finish line,
thanks to the hard work and professionalism of a long list of
distinguished Sailors that wear the Mauler patch with pride. At the top
of that list is a man who I believe is a hurricane of energy and
professionalism  my Command Master Chief, Adrian Andrews. When
[Andrews] made landfall at VS-32 in 2007, he immediately set a course to
unify the chiefs&apos; mess, reinvigorate the career development process and
provide a role model for positive leadership. It has been my honor to
serve with Master Chief Andrews,&quot;said Carpenter.

As part of the ceremony, Paulsen presented Carpenter with the
Meritorious Service Medal for his unmatched personal initiative and
intense commitment to excellence that sustained high-tempo combat
support operations during the squadron&apos;s sunset cruise.

Carpenter, in turn, presented the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement
Medal to AE1(AW/SW) Robert Barber Jr., who is also VS-32&apos;s Sailor of the
Year. His leadership for plane captains and troubleshooters in the line
division led to the completion of 308 sorties and 520 mishap-free flight
hours.

The Maulers completed their sunset cruise and the final carrier
deployment for the S-3 Viking in December 2007. As a component of
Carrier Air Wing 1, the squadron supported ground forces in Afghanistan
and Iraq by conducting maritime security operations. During the
deployment, Mauler aviators flew 960 sorties totaling more than 2,200
flight hours. The squadron was at sea for 180 days, with only 13 days in
port.

The ceremony concluded as Carpenter read his orders and relinquished his
command to close another chapter of the S-3 aviation family album. The
Navy&apos;s only remaining S-3 squadron, the VS-22&quot;Checkmates,&quot;is slated
for decommissioning at NAS Jax in January.

NNS081010-10. Naval Base San Diego Thanks National City for Support

By Walter T. Ham IV, Naval Base San Diego Public Affairs

SAN DIEGO (NNS) -- Naval Base San Diego (NBSD) commanding officer
thanked the people of National City, Calif., Oct. 8 for their support of
the base and the Sailors who serve there.

Rear Adm. (Sel.) Dixon R. Smith was the guest speaker at the National
City&apos;s 52nd Annual Salute to the Navy luncheon at the Martin Luther King
Jr. Community Center.&quot;I&apos;ve had the privilege of working with National City on a variety of
issues during my three years here,&quot;said Smith.&quot;We have worked together
closely, and it is my belief that our relationship has bettered both our
communities.&quot;Smith talked about the important role NBSD-based Sailors are playing
both locally and globally.

He singled out the volunteer work of Chief Master-at-Arms (SW) Ahmed
Wiggins and Electronics Technician 2nd Class Nichole Helmen from
Maritime Expeditionary Security Group 1 and Chief Information Systems
Technician Robert Halsey from the Center for Information Dominance
Learning Site. Smith also mentioned NBSD&apos;s recent Main Street clean-up
that took place in National City and the Barrio Logan section of San Diego.&quot;This clean-up was my seventh, and I have watched the number of
volunteers expand exponentially over the past three years,&quot;said Smith.&quot;Along with the annual Operation Clean Sweep of San Diego Bay, which has
included Pepper Park in past years, your Sailors and Navy family members
have demonstrated their pride in the local community.&quot;Naval Base San Diego&apos;s primary customers are always the fleet, the
fighter and the family, and that is why Navy towns like National City
are so important,&quot;said Smith.&quot;National City, along with the other
local communities, serves as a critical hub not only for maintaining,
training and launching our naval forces. But it is also as a place  a
community  where when our Sailors are home from deployment, they can
relax, get involved, and most importantly, raise families.&quot;Naval Base San Diego is home to 53 ships, 35,000 Sailors and civilian
employees and 120 tenant commands. The base supports the majority of the
Pacific Fleet&apos;s surface combatants, all of the Navy&apos;s west coast
amphibious ships and a number of U.S. Coast Guard and Military Sealift
Command vessels.

NNS081010-06. Local Fishermen Honor Wounded Warriors

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Riza Caparros, Fleet Public
Affairs Center Atlantic

VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (NNS) -- The Hampton Roads United Services
Organization (USO) teamed up with a local organization of several dozen
fishermen known as&quot;Heroes on the Bay&quot;, to host roughly 70 wounded
warriors to a day on the bay, Oct. 4, at Cove Marina, Naval Amphibious
Base Little Creek.

The wounded warriors, who traveled from commands as far away as Fort Dix
in New Jersey and Fort Lee in Petersburg, Va., spent the day deep sea
fishing and sailing around the bay.

They traveled to Hampton Roads as part of the Wounded Warriors Project,
an organization which assists those who have been severely injured
during the conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and other locations around the
world.

Carlos Rosario, Heroes on the Bay team and committee member, said the
group wanted to thank the veterans for their service, as well as give
them a day out on the water to enjoy themselves.&quot;The purpose of the event is to serve our wounded warriors, give them a
day out and a respite from the medical units or whatever environment
they are in,&quot;said Rosario.

Rosario also praised the volunteers who helped organize the event and
make it come together.&quot;The volunteers were fantastic,&quot;Rosario commented.&quot;Everyone just wanted to help after hearing what it was about. They gave
up their day off eagerly, just to give a little something to our military.&quot;One of the participating fisherman, Mark Powell, who volunteered his
boat for the event, described the pride he felt for participating in the
day&apos;s event.&quot;This turned out to be such a nice day, for us fishermen and the
troops,&quot;he said.&quot;We had a great turnout on both sides, and it feels
really good to see the smiles on everybody&apos;s face.&quot;Lance Cpl. Bronson Bell, with Camp Lejuene&apos;s 3rd Battalion, 6th Marines,
was one of the wounded warriors present at the event.&quot;These people gave up their personal time to do something special for
us,&quot;said Bell.&quot;You don&apos;t always see that type of gratitude, and it is
really nice to get away from all the medical issues I have back home.&quot;I used to deep-sea fish back home, so this is a real treat for me,&quot;Bell added.

The USO of Hampton Roads serves the largest concentration of military
personnel in the world offering morale-boosting programs, family
outreach and information and referral services to more than 250,000
military members and their families each year.

By Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Tristan Miller, Fleet Public
Affairs Center Atlantic

NORFOLK (NNS) -- More than 150 Sailors representing more than 25
commands throughout the Hampton Roads area came out to support the
athletes of the Special Olympics at Naval Station Norfolk Oct. 4.&quot;I am so happy the Sailors come out and volunteer and help out. It makes
me so very happy,&quot;said Special Olympian Margaret Hatch.

The Special Olympics is an international nonprofit organization
dedicated to empowering individuals with intellectual disabilities to
become physically fit, productive and respected members of society
through sports training and competition, according to the organization&apos;s
official Web site.&quot;I think it&apos;s about compassion,&quot;said Capt. Kelly Johnson, executive
officer of Naval Station Norfolk.&quot;The volunteers do it for all the
right reasons, to spend time and help those who may not get this kind of
interaction regularly. It&apos;s a great thing.&quot;While the various games of soccer, bowling and volleyball took place,
Sailors refereed events, served food and drinks and handed out awards.&quot;As Sailors it&apos;s instilled in us to give back to the community,&quot;said
Chief Quartermaster (SW/AW) Cindy Ragland, a volunteer from USS Mesa
Verde (LPD 19).&quot;I love to see Sailors volunteering, It&apos;s a great thing
to do, and what better event to participate in than the Special Olympics?&quot;The Special Olympics serve almost 2.5 million intellectually and
physically-challenged individuals through a variety of programs in more
than 180 countries.

USS BONHOMME RICHARD, At Sea (NNS) -- USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD 6)
welcomed members of Pacific Region 12 United States Sea Cadet Corps
Unit, Oct. 5 and offered insight into Navy life at sea.

The cadets are aboard Bonhomme Richard for hands-on training and to
experience life aboard a U.S. naval vessel.&quot;We want to [get exposed] to Navy life and talk to the professionals who
do it every day,&quot;said Sea Cadet Lt. Cmdr. Dave Burden, Pacific Region
12 senior director.&quot;Being aboard Bonhomme Richard gives the cadets a
chance to experience life on a naval vessel and at the same time the
opportunity to ask questions about the Navy.&quot;Our mission as volunteers with this organization is to give each cadet
as much knowledge about what they can do with their lives,&quot;said Burden,&quot;ultimately helping them in the future.&quot;The cadets began with a meet-and-greet with Bonhomme Richard&apos;s
commanding officer (CO), the command master chief, and Sailors from
various departments.&quot;Meeting the CO was...inspirational,&quot;said Sea Cadet Petty Officer 2nd
Class Adrian Diaz, a native to Sunnyvale, Calif.&quot;He cares about his
Sailors a lot.&quot;While aboard, cadets toured engineering, operations, supply, and weapons
spaces and also participated in a damage control demonstration.&quot;I really like the damage control equipment and knowing the importance
of it,&quot;said Sea Cadet Petty Officer 1st Class Renee Jaquith, a native
of Richmond, Calif.&quot;It&apos;s interesting to know that the safety of the
crew and ship highly depends on not only the Sailors but the equipment
as well.&quot;Cadets also participated in a line-handling evolution during an underway
replenishment.&quot;I feel very fortunate to have the chance to actually perform a
real-life duty of a boatswain&apos;s mate,&quot;said Diaz.&quot;This experience gave
me further insight into deck seamanship.&quot;Bonhomme Richard Sailors met with the Sea Cadets to share their experiences.&quot;There is a huge difference from what you read about in the newspaper or
what you see on the television about life on a Navy ship,&quot;said Ship&apos;s
Serviceman 1st Class (SW/AW) Reynaldo Osteria.&quot;You really have to
experience things yourself and come to your own conclusion.&quot;I just wanted to express to the cadets my experiences in the Navy and
to be an optimistic role model and represent each Sailor in a positive
way.&quot;&quot;From just talking to the crew you get a different insight into the Navy
than you would get from talking to a recruiter,&quot;said Jaquith.&quot;This
experience will definitely play a role in helping me to decide what
field I want to get into in the future. The experience, so far, has been
great.&quot;Bonhomme Richard is en route to San Francisco to take part in the city&apos;s
27th annual Fleet Week Oct 11-14.

NNS081010-17. Dale Earnhardt Jr. Returns to Rev Up His RTC Divisions

By Scott A. Thornbloom, Naval Service Training Command Public Affairs

GREAT LAKES (NNS) -- Like a race car owner checking on the performance
of his car, Dale Earnhardt Jr. returned to Recruit Training Command
(RTC) Oct. 7 to see how his recruits were running and performing.

The popular NASCAR Sprint Cup driver and owner stopped at RTC to visit
with his two sponsored&quot;Dale Jr.&quot;divisions 383 and 388.&quot;When I was here last time, you guys were all scared to death,&quot;said
Earnhardt, who visited the recruits just before they started training in
late August.

More than 150 recruits from both divisions lined up in formation to
receive a special&quot;Dale Jr. Division&quot;Navy cap, an autographed picture
and had a photo taken with the driver. They later serenaded him with a
cadence that was tweaked for Earnhardt, incorporating his No. 83 car.&quot;You better get out of our way now. Before we drive right over you. It&apos;s
just the quickest. Whoo! Hottest. Hey! The Navy&apos;s 83,&quot;chanted the
recruits, led by Seaman Recruit Deborah White, of Greenbelt, Md.
Earnhardt said it has been interesting to see the recruits train at
Naval Station Great Lakes and RTC.&quot;The way that they are organized and structure their day, it&apos;s pretty
impressive,&quot;Earnhardt said.&quot;When you walk out of here, you realize
what a powerful machine the military is.&quot;Earnhardt was also shown Division 383&apos;s division flag, designed by the
recruits. The flag has a checkered flag on one side and a skull wearing
a Dale Jr. ball cap on the other side along with an anchor and the
Navy&apos;s core values  honor, courage and commitment - painted on it.&quot;The division designed it for you and voted to send it to you when they
graduate in two weeks,&quot;Senior Chief Information Technician (SW/AW)
Nancy Smogoleski, recruit division commander of Division 383 told Earnhardt.

As part of a partnership between Earnhardt and the Navy, the two Dale
Jr. Divisions are part of the Navy&apos;s first national celebrity-endorsed
recruiting program. The concept was green-flagged at the NASCAR
Nationwide Series race at Lowe&apos;s Motor Speedway in Charlotte, N.C., May
24. Earnhardt drove the No. 83 Navy Dale Jr. Division Chevrolet Monte
Carlo SS to a fourth-place finish.

The first 10 members of the diverse group of men and women were sworn in
at the Charlotte race by the Chief of Naval Personnel, Vice Adm. Mark E.
Ferguson, III, and Earnhardt. Since then, the No. 83 car has been on
display at the USS Midway Ceremonial Drill Hall at RTC, where RTC
divisions graduate from boot camp. It will remain there until
Earnhardt&apos;s divisions graduate Oct. 17.

Along with the No.83 Dale Jr. Division Chevrolet, Earnhardt, also owns
the Navy Accelerate Your Life No. 88 Nationwide Series Chevy Monte Carlo
SS driven by Brad Keselowski.&quot;I commend you for the commitment you&apos;ve made and for sticking with it.
And I applaud the Navy for the training and instruction they have given
to you. You are totally different people from when I met you the first
time,&quot;Earnhardt told his recruits.

NNS081011-04. NSWC Crane Dedicates Test Range to Combat IEDs&gt;From Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Public Affairs

Crane, Ind. (NNS) -- Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane, a field
activity of Naval Sea Systems Command, dedicated Zubowski Flats, a new
realistic ground antenna test range to combat the threat from improvised
explosive devices (IEDs), Oct. 3 in Crane, Ind.&quot;The breakthroughs that will happen here in this facility are certain to
save lives. Marines serving in Iraq and Afghanistan will be able to
anticipate and avoid deadly threats lurking on the road ahead. Crane&apos;s
work to jam IED signals and create better armor is astonishing in its
depth and breadth (and) is something all Hoosiers should be proud of,&quot;said Sen. Evan Bayh&apos;s representative Sandi Stewart.

The range is named in honor of Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Scott Zubowski
from North Manchester, Ind., the first Hoosier Marine killed in Iraq by
an IED. Zubowski was killed during his second tour of duty when a
roadside bomb exploded during combat operations near Fallujah in Iraq&apos;s
Al Anbar province Nov. 12, 2005.&quot;NSWC Crane&apos;s main focus is to harness the power of technology for the
warfighter, and this is what Zubowski Flats will do  explore new
technologies to combat and defeat the threat posed by IEDs,&quot;said John
Zody who attended on behalf of Rep. Baron Hill during the dedication.

NSWC Crane Technical Director Duane Embree said the project had some of
the best leading it.&quot;In the last two and a half years, Jeff Snow and a team of technical
experts have pulled together nearly 200 of Crane&apos;s best and continue to
lead a team of national experts to provide solutions that have
significantly lowered the number of deaths by roadside bombs.&quot;For more news from Naval Sea Systems Command, visit

NNS081012-10. Laser Technology Improves Radar Maintenance, Saves Time,
Money for Surface Forces&gt;From Naval Surface Warfare Center Port Hueneme Public Affairs

PORT HUENEME, Calif. (NNS) -- Engineers from Naval Surface Warfare
Center (NSWC) Port Hueneme, a field activity of Naval Sea Systems
Command (NAVSEA), will install the first maintenance system utilizing
laser technology to improve AN/SPY-1D(V) radar maintenance on board USS
Sterett (DDG 104) the week of Oct. 13.

Radar measurements are taken periodically, ensuring alignment
specifications and operational capabilities are maintained. Previously,
measurements were taken during a four-day period for all four ship
arrays. With this new laser technology, the effort can be accomplished
in two days, with fewer personnel.

The technique uses a spherically-mounted retro reflector or&quot;laser ball&quot;to accurately measure the array and replaces the time consuming and
tedious optical measurement method previously used.&quot;I knew laser technology had been used, but I wasn&apos;t sure how it might
fit in the alignment world,&quot;said Michael Poland, NSWC Port Hueneme
combat systems alignment team leader.&quot;However, after talking with
subject matter experts and seeing a demo, I saw a real possibility for
this application.&quot;The Navy expects to save more than $400,000 every year for at least the
next four years by a reduction in time and labor associated with radar
maintenance.&quot;This technology improves fleet readiness while saving the Navy hundreds
of thousands of dollars,&quot;said Poland.&quot;It is definitely better, faster
and more cost-effective.&quot;NAVSEA is committed to fiscal responsibility and streamlining
maintenance and modernization processes, enabling us to maintain our
current readiness at a lower cost.

NNS081011-09. Training Center Aimed at Providing More Emergency Services
to Sailors Opens

By Mass Communication Specialist Christal A. Ferris, Commander Navy
Region Southwest Public Affairs

Naval Base Coronado (NNS) -- Commander, Navy Installations Command
(CNIC) opened the doors to the new Shore Force Training Center (SFTC)
with a ribbon-cutting ceremony at Naval Air Station North Island Oct. 9.

The overall mission of the SFTC is to train Navy installation personnel
in the proper actions during catastrophic emergencies and other shore
installation situations, while integrating those actions with the rest
of the Navy. The new facility will provide a training opportunity for
personnel assigned ashore to learn how to shelter Navy personnel and
their families, how to protect Navy property and how to work alongside
local city and state officials during natural disasters and other
possible crises, such as wild fires and hurricanes.

Commander, Naval Installations Command, Vice Adm. Bob Conway said the
center is a culmination of years of work to integrate efforts across the
shore facilities and to enhance the sea-shore interface.&quot;What we&apos;ve done here is taken situational awareness to a new level,&quot;Conway said.&quot;In almost real time, everybody is alerted. Since 9/11,
this is very important to all of us. If there&apos;s something happening at
one base, other commanders are aware of it.&quot;Conway said he hopes civilian authorities will be able to train
alongside Navy personnel in the future.&quot;This center is only in its infancy stages,&quot;he said.&quot;Once some of the
civilian agencies come and see the opportunities here my sense is they
will want to train.&quot;The center is the only one of its kind in the Navy and is designed to
support training throughout the worldwide Navy shore structure using
state of the art technology and coordinated communications protocols. It
provides an emergency management curriculum that will include classroom
instruction, an information library, individual and unit-level
distributed learning, self-paced interactive computer-based scenarios
and Navywide all-hazards exercise events.

NNS081012-05. Continuing Promise Medical Team Hard at Work in Dominican
Republic

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class William S. Parker

BAYAGUANA, Dominican Republic (NNS) -- The joint-military, multinational
medical team currently embarked aboard USS Kearsarge (LHD 3) is working
with host nation medical personnel to treat residents in remote areas of
the country in support of the humanitarian/civic assistance mission
Continuing Promise (CP) 2008.

The multinational team from Kearsarge, which includes personnel from the
United States, Canada, Brazil, France and the Netherlands, worked with
the Dominicans to administer general, eye and dental examinations to
local patients in need.

The host nation personnel include firefighters, National Guard, Army
dentists, Army nurses and an Army optometrist to assist in the mission.&quot;I feel lucky to be a part of the partnership going on here between us
and the Dominican Republic,&quot;said Canadian Air Force Capt. Jolene Cook,
a physician currently attached to the Kearsarge.&quot;It was an excellent
opportunity for us to interact, and it&apos;s making the operation run a lot
more smoothly.&quot;The Dominican locals assisted the medical team with processing,
translation and medical expertise. Participants said the combined
efforts have led to an overall success so far in the operation in
Bayaguana.&quot;It&apos;s fabulous to be working with the host nation to solve a common
problem, to reduce health disparities within the country,&quot;said U.S.
Public Health Service Capt. Jose Belardo.&quot;We are going to do everything
we can for the people of Bayaguana, from performing general medical
exams to improving hygiene.&quot;Kearsarge&apos;s mission during CP 2008 is to conduct joint civil-military
operations including humanitarian and civic assistance, as well as
providing veterinary, medical, dental and civil engineering support to
six partner nations and to send a strong message of compassion, support
and commitment to Central and South America and the Caribbean.

The four-month deployment has included stops in Nicaragua and Colombia.
Once it departs the Dominican Republic, Kearsarge will round out its
mission with stops in Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana.

Kearsarge is under the operational control of U.S. 4th Fleet. U.S. 4th
Fleet&apos;s mission is to direct United States naval forces operating in the
Caribbean and Central and South American regions and interact with
partner nation navies to shape the maritime environment.

The Continuing Promise Caribbean Phase is the second of two HCA
deployments to the Southern Command area of focus for 2008. The first
Continuing Promise deployment was conducted by USS Boxer (LHD 4) in the
Pacific.

NNS081013-06. Bonhomme Richard, Pinckney Arrive for San Francisco Fleet Week

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class (SW/AW) Jeffery J. Gabriel
Jr., USS Bonhomme Richard Public Affairs

SAN FRANCISCO (NNS) -- More than 1,500 Sailors and Marines aboard the
amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD 6) and the guided
missile destroyer USS Pinckney (DDG 91) arrived in San Francisco Oct. 12
for the city&apos;s annual Fleet Week celebration.

Fleet Week San Francisco, held since 1981, is an opportunity for the
public to meet their Navy and Marine Corps team. It also allows the Navy
and Marine Corps to showcase their personnel, equipment, technology and
capabilities while highlighting the history they have with San Francisco.

During the three-day visit, Bonhomme Richard and Pinckney will host
public ship visits and participate in various community events. This
year&apos;s Fleet Week coincides with both the Navy&apos;s 233rd birthday as well
as the 100th anniversary of the Great White Fleet.

Although San Francisco&apos;s Fleet Week has been an ongoing tradition for 27
years, for some Sailors it is their first visit to the area.&quot;I&apos;m excited to meet civilians that appreciate what we do on a daily
basis,&quot;said Aviation Boatswain&apos;s Mate (Fuels) Airman Kendra Kinzler,
native of Atwater, Minn.&quot;It will be a thrill to be in such a scenic
area with people showing their gratitude towards Sailors.&quot;&quot;I can&apos;t wait to see the Golden Gate Bridge because it&apos;s an opportunity
of a lifetime,&quot;said Airman Alicia Rice, a native of St. Louis.&quot;I&apos;ve
seen it in movies, but now I will have the chance to gaze at it only
yards away.&quot;Also participating in Fleet Week San Francisco is the U.S. Coast Guard
Cutter Bertholf (WMSL-750).

NNS081011-02. USS Kentucky Sailor to Receive Professional Excellence Award

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (NAC) Jason Beckjord, Fleet
Public Affairs Center, Det. Northwest

SILVERDALE, Wash. (NNS) -- A USS Kentucky (SSBN 737) (Blue) Sailor was
recently selected to receive the Charles A. Lockwood Award for Submarine
Professional Excellence Oct. 23.

Sonar Technician (Submarines) 1st Class (SS) Matthew Hendl will receive
the award which is presented annually by the Naval Submarine League to
an officer, a chief petty officer and a petty officer. It recognizes
individuals for achievement, contribution and specific action or
consistent performance, which best exemplifies the traditional spirit
embodied in the submarine force.&quot;Petty Officer Hendl is a model Sailor. The [Master Chief Petty Officer
of the Navy] has put out guidance for first class petty officers, and he
embodies those expectations on a daily basis,&quot;said Kentucky&apos;s Chief of
the Boat, Senior Chief Electrician&apos;s Mate (SS) William Mast.&quot;He leads
by example, and as a Navy leader, it&apos;s not about giving the Sailor what
they want, it&apos;s about giving them what they need.&quot;Hendl -- who is Kentucky Blue&apos;s command career counselor as well as a
sonar supervisor and command fitness leader -- works to embody the idea
that you should treat others as you would be treated.&quot;Part of my job is customer service as command career counselor, so
there is a lot of interaction with everyone in my command. I am not
going to ask somebody to do something that I can&apos;t do myself.&quot;Hendl continues to follow the lead of one of his first mentors.&quot;When I was a junior Sailor, I was chipping, grinding and painting
topside, and I was told to continue to work until the job is done,&quot;he
said.&quot;Well, it&apos;s kind of hard when no one is there with you, but my
[supervisor] was right there with me, chipping and grinding, and I
respected him so much for that, that it made me work harder.&quot;Hendl will fly to Virginia with his wife to attend the 26th annual
Submarine League Symposium in McLean, Va., where he will be presented
with the award and given the opportunity to meet shipmates old and new.&quot;You look back, and 12 years goes by really quick, your time in the Navy
can fly by, it feels like I just came out of boot camp,&quot;said Hendl.&quot;You look down your shoulder and before you know it you are wearing the
next chevron. You see yourself continuing forward, and there are people
following you. To get selected for this award is an honor and an
accomplishment, but at the same time, I don&apos;t know what I won the award
for. All of my tasks, duties and jobs that I do for Kentucky, it&apos;s not
me who is doing them, it&apos;s the crew. Without them I couldn&apos;t do my job.&quot;It&apos;s the Sailor who makes the leader, and it&apos;s everyone on board
Kentucky that is making me successful and therefore able to accept this
award.&quot;For more news from the submarine force, visit www.navy.mil/local/subpac/.

NNS081013-03. Boxer&apos;s Blue, Green Medical Team Preps for Deployment

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Matthew Jackson, USS Boxer
Public Affairs

USS BOXER, At Sea (NNS) -- USS Boxer&apos;s (LHD 4) Medical Department, Fleet
Surgical Team (FST) 5 and the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU)
tested their emergency medical response skills Oct. 9 during a shipboard
mass casualty drill.

The drill simulated Marine casualties flown to Boxer from combat ashore.
The Marines were received in flight deck triage, and their wounds were
diagnosed prior to being taken below to the ship&apos;s intensive care unit.

Hospital corpsmen from the different commands make up the mass casualty
response team, which charted the victims&apos; vital signs and dressed their
wounds through the process with help from Marine stretcher bearers.&quot;This drill was successful for us to begin critical training,&quot;said
Boxer&apos;s Hospital Corpsman 1st Class (SW/AW) Jennifer Gabbard.&quot;It&apos;s
important to our mission readiness that our Marine stretcher-bearers and
new Sailors are properly trained to meet this responsibility.&quot;The mass casualty drill was conducted during the Boxer Expeditionary
Strike Group (BOXESG) Integration, which is an exercise designed to
integrate the different command elements of the strike group prior to
deploying.

The drill allowed Sailors and Marines to identify their roles and
responsibilities as well as get a feel for the coordination and
logistics involved.&quot;Our goal was to work on integration between Boxer Medical, FST 5 and
the 13th MEU,&quot;said Senior Chief Hospital Corpsman (SW/AW) Stephen
Richardson.&quot;Once the Marines are ashore, it&apos;s important for them to
know what our capabilities and procedures are so we can work better
together.&quot;According to Richardson, utilizing the extensive medical capabilities of
Boxer provided the teams a prime training environment.&quot;Boxer is the best medical platform to use,&quot;he said.&quot;Other than
hospital ships, we have the broadest medical capabilities afloat. FST 5
and Boxer&apos;s medical staff are capable of performing surgery, X-rays,
laboratory work, and we have blood bank capabilities.&quot;FST 5 nurses and surgeons worked with the 13th MEU medical staff in
direct care of the casualties and assessed patient triage procedures.

Richardson said support staff from different services and different
disciplines offered a wide range of experiences to pull from but also
created challenges.&quot;Our biggest challenge is ensuring everyone understands, without a
doubt, what their job is,&quot;said Richardson.&quot;Everyone, from the
inexperienced hospital corpsman to the FST 5 officer in charge, has an
integral role.&quot;Past experiences help us overcome that challenge, and we use that
experience during training drills. We&apos;re all about teamwork because we
deal with people&apos;s health and lives.&quot;The combination of different elements working together during the drill
is key in preparing Sailors and Marines to integrate their capabilities
for Boxer&apos;s upcoming deployment.&quot;Mass casualty drills are a great lesson in &apos;training like we fight&apos;, so
that our reactions to medical emergencies become second nature to us,&quot;added Gabbard.&quot;We want to be prepared in every circumstance.&quot;BOXESG is scheduled for more training exercises this fall prior to a
Western Pacific deployment scheduled for early next year.

BOXESG is comprised of Amphibious Squadron 5, the 13th MEU, Boxer, USS
New Orleans (LPD 18), USS Comstock (LSD 45), USS Chung Hoon (DDG 93),
USCGC Boutwell (WHEC 719), USS Milius (DDG 69), USS Lake Champlain (CG
57), Naval Beach Group 1, Assault Craft Unit 5, Assault Craft Unit 1,
Beach Master Unit 1, FST 5, Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron (REIN)
163, Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 21, and Fixed Wing Marine Attack
Squadron 214.

NNS081013-08. Momsen, Shoup Return Home to Naval Station Everett after
MSO Deployment

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Scott Dagendesh, Fleet Pubic
Affairs Center, Det. Northwest

EVERETT, Wash. (NNS) -- USS Momsen (DDG 92) and USS Shoup (DDG 86)
returned to Naval Station Everett Oct. 12 after a seven-month deployment
to the Western Pacific and Arabian Sea.

The Arleigh Burke-class destroyers were deployed as part of the USS
Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72) Carrier Strike Group.

Throughout the deployment, Momsen participated in a variety of
humanitarian relief work, exercise duties and support of Operation
Enduring Freedom and maritime security operations.&quot;This deployment provided Momsen Sailors a unique opportunity to
demonstrate the skills they&apos;ve been sharpening during the arduous
nine-month training cycle preceding the deployment,&quot;said Commanding
Officer Cmdr. Michael Sparks.&quot;This is Momsen&apos;s first strike group
deployment, so my crew became technical experts in multi-ship operations.&quot;While supporting the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group, Momsen
provided critical humanitarian assistance for two foreign vessels -- a
stranded cargo vessel with engine problems and a former hijacked
merchant vessel requiring food, water and medical attention.

The ship also trained with other countries&apos; maritime forces in
procedures ranging from shipboard damage control to security operations.&quot;Momsen joined with coalition elements from Kenya, Pakistan, Canada,
England, Singapore and Seychelles to sustain maritime security
operations in the Third, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Fleets,&quot;Sparks said.

However, on a sunny Pacific Northwest October morning, the deployment
came to an end as hundreds of family members and friends greeted ships
as they pulled alongside the pier. Some held signs to help their Sailors
find them through the masses.&quot;It was so exciting to see my husband return to me after all these
months, even though I had to wait seven months, including this
particular morning, which was really chilly,&quot;said Jenna Glaston.&quot;My sister and I are waiting for our little brother to step off the ship
so we can take him home and celebrate,&quot;said Louis Massey, family member
of a Shoup Sailor.

Local Everett businesses and organizations were also pierside welcoming
the Sailors home and offering their services. Everett Mayor Ray
Stephanson gave a proclamation from Governor Christine Gregoire
welcoming back the ships.&quot;It&apos;s great to have them back; it&apos;s like having a family reunion because
these are our friends and our neighbors,&quot;said Stephanson.&quot;I can&apos;t believe we were gone that long,&quot;said Machinist&apos;s Mate Fireman
Lloyd Thomas.&quot;That was my first deployment, so within a few months it
started to seem as though it would last forever. Now, we&apos;re back and
it&apos;s time to play catch up; it&apos;s good to be back home to hang out with
my friends.&quot;For more news from the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group, visit

NNS081013-07. Second Fleet Commander Lauds Nassau&apos;s Hurricane Relief Efforts

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Shane Arrington, USS Nassau
Public Affairs

NEW YORK (NNS) -- Amid the celebration in Manhattan of the 100th
anniversary of the Great White Fleet, the commander of the U.S. 2nd
Fleet visited USS Nassau (LHA 4) Oct. 11 to recognize 12 Sailors for

NNS081012-07. Continuing Promise Brings New Vision to Twin Brothers

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Gina Wollman, Continuing
Promise 2008 Public Affairs

USS KEARSARGE (NNS) -- Twin brothers from Santo Domingo, Dominican
Republic are finally able to see clearly after receiving surgery Oct. 10
aboard USS Kearsarge (LHD 3) during the humanitarian/civic assistance
mission Continuing Promise (CP) 2008.

Thanks to medical personnel, currently embarked aboard Kearsarge,
Ariagner Wagner Munos Carmareia and Wagner Arian Munos Carmareia, who
have suffered since birth from Strabismus, a condition where the eyes do
not properly align with one another, successfully received the
life-changing surgery while the ship was anchored off the coast here.

The twins&apos; mother, Joselyn Altagracia Carmarena Vargas said growing up
with Strabismus was very hard for the boys.&quot;School was especially difficult for them,&quot;said Joselyn.&quot;Not only did
they have to deal with the physical difficulties of otherwise simple
tasks, such as reading and using the computer, but in school the other
children would tease them because of their eyes, and that made it hard
for them to concentrate and learn.&quot;When news came that the twins would be receiving the surgery to correct
their vision, the family felt a huge weight lifted off their shoulders.&quot;We were so excited to find out the problem was going to be fixed,&quot;said
Joselyn.&quot;Knowing they will be able to see more clearly and that they
will fit in with the other children at school is very comforting to us.&quot;Though Strabismus is a common eye problem, the corrective surgery for
the condition still runs many risks such as excessive bleeding,
infection, inflammation, slipped muscles or even permanent loss of
sight. However, the boys&apos; surgeries went well.&quot;Everything went wonderful; there were no complications,&quot;said Cmdr.
Brian Alexander, an Ophthalmologist embarked aboard Kearsarge for the CP
2008 mission.&quot;The morning after the surgery, their eyes were exactly
where I wanted them to be. They were still a little red, but that will
fade in about two weeks.&quot;With a minimal recovery time, the boys will be back to regular
activities in no time at all.&quot;The healing time for a procedure like this is not very long,&quot;said
Anesthesiologist Enrique Abreu, a Project HOPE volunteer embarked aboard
the Kearsarge.&quot;The twins will not have to miss any school, and with the
exception of a couple days, they will be able to read or play outside
with no problems.&quot;Many doctors took part in helping the twins during the operation, but
Alexander, who was responsible for performing the surgery, might have
gotten more out if it than the boys themselves.&quot;It gives me great satisfaction to be able to have helped these boys in
a way no one else could,&quot;said Alexander.&quot;The smiles on the faces of
the twins and their mother were one of the biggest rewards I could have
received.&quot;Joselyn and the twins stayed aboard Kearsarge the night of the surgery
and departed the following morning after post-operation exams.&quot;The boys have been dealing with this problem since they were born,&quot;she
said.&quot;This blessing has been a long time coming, and our family is very
grateful for everything that is being done for us.&quot;CP 2008 is a collaborative effort between the United States and partner
militaries, non-governmental organizations (NGO) and partner-nation
support organizations to build strong partnerships that can be called
upon in the event of a regional situation requiring cooperative solutions.

When Kearsarge departs from the Dominican Republic it will move forward
with the Continuing Promise mission to Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana.

Kearsarge is currently under the operational control of U.S. 4th Fleet.
U.S. 4th Fleet&apos;s mission is to direct United States naval forces
operating in the Caribbean and Central and South American region and
interact with partner nation navies to shape maritime environment.

Kearsarge&apos;s mission exemplifies the United States maritime strategy
which emphasizes deploying forces to build confidence and trust among
nations through collective maritime security efforts that focus on
common threats and mutual interest.

The Continuing Promise Caribbean Phase is the second of two HCA
deployments to the Southern Command area of focus for 2008. The first
Continuing Promise deployment was conducted by USS Boxer (LHD 4) in the
Pacific.

NNS081011-10. Beach Master Unit Supports Carter Hall&apos;s Amphibious Operations

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Katrina Parker, Iwo Jima
Expeditionary Strike Group Public Affairs

USS CARTER HALL, At Sea (NNS) -- A detachment from Beach Master Unit 2
(BMU-2) is deployed aboard the amphibious dock landing ship USS Carter
Hall (LSD 50) supporting operations of the Iwo Jima Expeditionary Strike
Group (ESG).

The unit, based out of Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek, Virginia
Beach, Va., deployed 16 personnel from BMU-2, which includes two Seabees
from Amphibious Construction Battalion (ACB) 2, to support amphibious
operations aboard Carter Hall.

BMU-2 consists of naval beach party teams (BPTs) which provide beach and
surf zone salvage and assist with the landing and movement of troops,
equipment and supplies. They also assist in the evacuation of
casualties, prisoners-of-war and non-combatants.

While deployed to the beach, BMU-2 is tasked with controlling boat
traffic in surf zones, controlling the beaching and retracting of the
landing craft utilities (LCU), and directing the efficient flow of
personnel and material over the beach. They also establish visual and
radio communications with the ship.&quot;We are here to support the LCU beach operations ashore,&quot;said Chief
Warrant Officer Frank Sabella, the beach party team commander.&quot;We
ensure the safe and efficient landing of the LCUs. When they hit the
beach, we are there to make sure that nothing goes wrong and to correct
any problems that may arise.&quot;Since 1949, BMU-2 has been involved in major amphibious exercises and
operations in Lebanon, Cuba, Grenada, Desert Storm, Kosovo and
Afghanistan. They work closely with the embarked 26th Marine
Expeditionary Unit&apos;s (MEU) Landing Force Support Party (LFSP) during
beach operations.&quot;During MEU operations we are here to assist them in any way we can,&quot;said Quartermaster 3rd Class (SW) David-Paul Thompson, the primary
communicator for Carter Hall&apos;s BMU-2 detachment.&quot;We help the Marines
get to shore or use the LCU in whatever capacity they need to use it for.&quot;The BMU-2 detachment consists of a variety of enlisted rates including
quartermasters, boatswain&apos;s mates, operations specialists, construction
mechanics and undesignated seamen. When the detachment is not conducting
beach operations, they fill their time with on-the-job training and
attaining qualifications.&quot;A lot of team members are taking college courses and getting qualified
in enlisted surface warfare specialist (ESWS),&quot;Sabella said.&quot;We
integrate into the normal ship operations, like standing watch and
working alongside the different departments to assist with day-to-day
evolutions.&quot;&quot;Carter Hall has taken very good care of us,&quot;Thompson said.&quot;We are
welcomed throughout the ship and given everything we need to accomplish
our mission on board.&quot;Carter Hall is deployed to the U.S. 5th Fleet area of operations to
conduct Maritime Security Operations (MSO). MSO help develop security in
the maritime environment. From security arises stability that results in
global economic prosperity. MSO complements the counterterrorism and
security efforts of regional nations and seek to disrupt violent
extremists&apos; use of the maritime environment as a venue for attack or to
transport personnel, weapons or other material.

Peleliu Public Affairs

SYDNEY, Australia (NNS) -- Sailors and Marines from the amphibious
assault ship USS Peleliu (LHA 5), along with Sailors from the
guided-missile destroyer USS Halsey (DDG 97), lent a hand to a local
ambulance service Oct. 11 as part of a community relations (COMREL)
project during their scheduled port visit to Sydney.

The group worked at St. John&apos;s Volunteer Ambulance Station where they
cleaned ambulances, organized the garage and fixed ambulance radios and
other equipment. The ambulance station is an organization run mostly by
volunteers in the Australian community and provides charitable and
humanitarian services to individuals, groups and organizations.

Workers at St. John expressed their appreciation for the U.S. volunteers
and what they do for the Sydney community.&quot;St. John&apos;s Ambulance thanks the U.S. Navy for their continued support
by helping keep our building, equipment and vehicles in order to enable
our volunteers to put all their time and effort into providing first aid
and medical care to the local community,&quot;said John Wakefield, property
and fleet service officer.

A Marine aboard Peleliu described how he enjoyed helping the Australian
community.&quot;It feels good helping the community,&quot;said Lance Cpl. Eric Hirwa.&quot;This
is my first time to Sydney, and I am here because I like helping people
and being involved. The community does a lot for me, and I feel it is
time to give something back to it.&quot;Peleliu is the flagship of the Peleliu Expeditionary Strike Group and
the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit which is currently conducting
operations in the U.S. 7th Fleet area of responsibility.

NNS081011-06. Submarine Sailors Spruce up Singaporean Center&gt;From USS Bremerton Public Affairs

SINGAPORE (NNS) -- Sailors from USS Bremerton (SSN 698) participated in
a community relations (COMREL) project Oct. 3 at the Archdiocesan
Commission for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant People (ACMI)
Training Centre in Singapore.

Bremerton volunteers spent their time at the training center cleaning up
rubbish, gardening and trimming overgrown foliage.&quot;I would like to thank the crew of USS Bremerton for their time in
helping us maintain our facilities. We rely heavily on support from all
ships from the United States to keep our upkeep costs low in order to
spend what money we have on training life skills, job placement, legal
advice and providing room and board to the immigrants who come to
Singapore,&quot;said Fabian Patrick, facility manager of the ACMI Training
Centre.

The volunteers removed more than 200 pounds of overgrown foliage,
landscaped and completed numerous small repair jobs during the five-hour
project.&quot;It is a privilege to work with Mr. Patrick here at ACMI, knowing that
my hard work, and the work of my shipmates will enable immigrants here
in Singapore to get a head start in their new life,&quot;said Electronics
Technician 2nd Class (SS) Joseph Pillen on of the 12 volunteers.

Sailors like Pillen say community service is a way to return the
hospitality that has been extended to them during port visits.

USS Bremerton, homeported in Pearl Harbor Hawaii, spent a total of seven
days in Singapore while on a Western Pacific Deployment.&quot;This visit underscores the importance of developing and maintaining our
relationship with Singapore. It also gave our crew a great opportunity
to give back to the Singapore community who have graciously hosted us
over the past week, and we have been very happy to be here,&quot;said Cmdr.
Howard C. Warner III, commanding officer.

NNS081013-04. Benfold Underway After Port Visit to Hong Kong

By Ensign Jordan Adler, USS Benfold Public Affairs

USS BENFOLD, At Sea (NNS) -- The guided-missile destroyer USS Benfold
(DDG 65) departed Hong Kong Oct. 9 following a scheduled four-day port
visit.

Cmdr. Thomas Disy, Benfold&apos;s commanding officer, explained Hong Kong is
a top Navy port visit and is important in strengthening the relationship
between the United States and China.&quot;You can&apos;t quite call yourself a Pacific Fleet Sailor until you have
anchored in Hong Kong Harbor,&quot;said Disy.&quot;I am very pleased our crew
had this opportunity.&quot;During the visit, Sailors met local citizens, experienced Chinese
customs and traditions and enjoyed recreational activities. Many tours
were offered through local Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR)
services that included coverage of the city, historic sites and
viewpoints, such as Hong Kong&apos;s famous Victoria&apos;s Peak. Shopping, dining
and relaxing were top priorities for some of the crew.

A number of Sailors also volunteered for a community relations project.
Benfold Sailors assisted the Nesbitt Center and played sports with
approximately 30 students. The crew also provided hygiene and toiletry
supplies provided by Project Handclasp.&quot;We went to have fun with the students, but at the end of the day we
gained a lot of satisfaction knowing that we had made a difference in
their lives,&quot;said Benfold Command Master Chief (SW) Mark Swab.

In another community relations project, Sailors were hosted by
ex-patriots living in Hong Kong as part of a home hospitality program.&quot;The hospitality was incredible, and it was cool to see how they
[ex-patriots] live their lives in a foreign place and kept their
American ties,&quot;said Ensign Francis Sweeney who organized the home
hospitality program for Benfold Sailors.

Benfold is part of the Peleliu Expeditionary Strike Group which is
currently conducting operations in the U.S. 7th Fleet area of
responsibility.

The U.S. 7th Fleet is the largest of the forward-deployed U.S. fleets,

NNS081012-08. Navy, Air Force Engineers Upgrade Socorro Sanchez School

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Maddelin Angebrand,
Continuing Promise 2008 Public Affairs

SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (NNS) -- Navy Seabees attached to
Construction Battalion Mobile Unit (CBMU) 202 and civil engineers from
the Air Force&apos;s 5th Civil Engineer Squadron&apos;s Prime Base Emergency
Engineer Force, both embarked aboard USS Kearsarge (LHD 3), are making
improvements to the Socorro Sanchez School here as part of the
humanitarian/civic assistance mission Continuing Promise (CP) 2008.

The existing school, which services 600 students, kindergarten through
fourth grade, is in need of more storage space, new book shelves and a
cafeteria.&quot;We want to provide a serving area for the school and also upgrade some
of the electrical outlets,&quot;said Chief Equipment Operator Jerry Greer,
on-site project leader.&quot;They also have a problem with wood ants, so we
are replacing wood shelving with metal. This will also save some of the
books that were being damaged by the pests.&quot;The school&apos;s existing electrical back-up system has been depending on
six car batteries for power and was in desperate need of an upgrade.&quot;We&apos;re trying to change out a lot of the receptacles that aren&apos;t
working, and we&apos;re also replacing the battery back-up system they were
using for a computer power supply,&quot;said Airman 1st Class Nicholas
Varner, Air Force electrical systems journeyman.&quot;Now, when the
commercial power goes out, they&apos;ll have a more reliable system compared
to what they currently depend on.&quot;The project not only requires skilled engineers, but also a team effort
from Sailors and Airman working side-by-side to complete the project
within the two-week timeline.&quot;Working with the Air Force is a great opportunity; it&apos;s a learning
experience seeing how they do things compared to us,&quot;said Greer.&quot;That&apos;s something that makes us a strong team - working together to get
the job done.&quot;When Kearsarge departs the Dominican Republic, they will move forward
with the Continuing Promise mission to Trinidad and Tobago.

Kearsarge&apos;s mission exemplifies the United States maritime strategy
which emphasizes deploying forces to build confidence and trust among
nations through collective maritime security efforts that focus on
common threats and mutual interest.

USS Kearsarge is under the operational control of U.S. 4th Fleet. U.S.
4th Fleet&apos;s mission is to direct United States naval forces operating in
the Caribbean, and Central and South American regions and interact with
partner nation navies to shape maritime environment.

NNS081013-02. Whidbey Firefighters Visit with Youth, Kick Off Fire
Prevention Week

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Tucker M. Yates, Fleet Public
Affairs Center, Det. Northwest

OAK HARBOR, Wash. (NNS) -- Navy Region Northwest Fire and Emergency
Services firefighters visited locations in the Naval Air Station (NAS)
Whidbey Island community Oct. 6 to promote fire safety and awareness for
Fire Prevention Week.

Fire Prevention Week runs Oct. 5-11.&quot;Every year the NFPA (National Fire Protection Association) goes through
their numbers and decides what the campaign is going to be based on
those numbers and the current needs. This year the NFPA&apos;s message was
stopping home fires,&quot;said Alan Sprouse, fire inspector for Navy Region
Northwest Fire and Emergency Services on NAS Whidbey Island.&quot;In 2006,
there were roughly 21,000 injuries due to home fires nationally. So,
we&apos;re trying to shrink that number.&quot;Families received information and training on how to better fireproof
their homes and what to do in preparation should a fire break out in the
home. Kitchen and electrical safety, proper use of smoke alarms and home
evacuation were included.&quot;This is for everybody, anywhere, in the home, in the workplace. It
teaches people how to use fire extinguishers and what to look for to
prevent fires,&quot;said Wayne Barlage, fire captain for the NAS Whidbey
Island Seaplane Base Fire Station.&quot;We also have aids for children to
give them experience and let them see what they can do to save
themselves if there&apos;s a fire in their house.&quot;A major focus of the day&apos;s event was educating youth during visits to
the NAS Whidbey Island Child Development and Youth Centers.&quot;We&apos;re really trying to get to that younger demographic to teach them
early. We&apos;re trying to change the hearts and minds of the little ones,&quot;said Sprouse.

At these venues,&quot;Pluggie&quot;the fire hydrant and&quot;Sparky&quot;the fire dog
taught the students what to do should they find flammable objects, such
as lighters and matches; to stop, drop, and roll should their clothing
catch fire; and how to move low in a smoke-filled room. Older children
and young adults also received training on how to use fire extinguishers
to put out pan fires.&quot;It is so important that our youth be educated on fire safety before an
emergency situation [occurs]. Children are often frightened during a
real emergency, as we all are. Knowing what to do and who responds to
their needs is vital,&quot;said Cynthia Fletcher, youth programs director
for the NAS Whidbey Island Youth Center.&quot;Children and youth learn more from active hands-on experiences. The
presentation to the teens was very appropriate to their age and
motivated them to learn while having fun. Often teens do not pay
attention to safety presentations, but the fire department has done a
good job of letting them experience &apos;real life&apos; scenarios,&quot;noted Fletcher.

Sprouse added the event went very well.&quot;I&apos;m thankful for all the support we received in getting our message out
there to all hands through multiple medias. I&apos;m looking forward to next
year and am hoping to make it bigger and better,&quot;said Sprouse, a
nine-year veteran of these events.

NNS081011-05. Kitsap Hosts Domestic Violence Training

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (NAC) Jason Beckjord, Fleet
Public Affairs Center, Det. Northwest

Silverdale, Wash. (NNS) -- Naval Base Kitsap (NBK) Keyport Fleet and
Family Support Center (FFSC) staff and more than 20 command family
advocacy representatives (CFAR) from NBK shared a meal and spent a few
hours training to be better advocates for their Sailors and families Oct. 8.&quot;The breakfast was fun,&quot;said Kathy Selves, NBK Family Advocacy and
Prevention counselor (FAP).&quot;This was a great way for us to appreciate
more what the command representatives do and to give them some more
training.&quot;After the meal, a presentation was given concerning the Navy&apos;s adoption
of a new program for substantiating cases of domestic violence, as well
as standardizing the data collected by individual FFSCs.&quot;The way we look at it now, our definition of physical abuse might not
be the same as the Marines or the Army,&quot;said Britt Feldman, FAP
counselor supervisor.&quot;This new program is set up so that the data will
be consistent for all services. There was a Navy report that said that
the way that the domestic violence Case Review Committee (CRC) is set up
now provides a lot of flexibility as to whether or not a case gets
substantiated. A case that is substantiated here might not be somewhere
else.&quot;The new program, which was developed, designed, and fine-tuned for 10
years by the Air Force, utilizes Incident Determination Committees (IDC)
of five people, as well as standardized clinical algorithms to properly
identify and respond to cases of domestic violence.&quot;I refer people to FFSC for domestic violence, OB-GYN issues, depression
and deployment-support programs,&quot;said Lt. Jayme Glick, a social worker
at Naval Hospital Bremerton.&quot;In this new program there will be more
people involved in decision-making processes, and it sounds like we will
have a larger role. I think that this will be positive in the long run.&quot;&quot;The difference in utilizing an IDC is that there will be more
consistency,&quot;said Feldman.&quot;The IDC program has 92 percent consistency
across the board. This way, people in Washington D.C., can look across
the board to see how many incidents of domestic violence we actually have.&quot;For more news from Naval Base Kitsap, visit www.navy.mil/local/kitsap/.

NNS081011-11. Wasp Celebrates Ship&apos;s Diversity During Hispanic-American
Heritage Month

By Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Edward L. Kobobel III USS Wasp
(LHD 1) Public Affairs

PORTSMOUTH, Va. (NNS) -- Sailors attached to the multi-purpose
amphibious assault ship USS Wasp (LHD 1) gathered to celebrate
Hispanic-American Heritage Month Oct. 8 on the ship&apos;s living barge mess
decks.

The crew listened to several perspectives on Hispanic-American
contributions to both the United States and the Navy. The event
concluded with a cake-cutting ceremony.&quot;It&apos;s important to take pride in our heritage and to set the example for
future Hispanic-Americans who are serving in the military,&quot;said Wasp
Chaplain Department LPO Religious Program Specialist 1st Class Perla
Garcia.&quot;By having celebrations like this, we&apos;re making sure that our
customs and cultures stay alive and are not forgotten.&quot;Wasp Commanding Officer Capt. Daniel H. Fillion pointed out that
celebrations such as these don&apos;t occur often in the civilian sector;
however, they are an important part of Navy culture.&quot;We celebrate things like Hispanic-American Heritage Month in the Navy
because it&apos;s important, and it&apos;s what we do,&quot;said Fillion.&quot;We&apos;re all
blue and gold here, but Team Wasp is comprised of so many ethnicities
and so many segments of society. The spirit and intensity of our men and
women who are proud of their Hispanic heritage only serve to make us
stronger.&quot;The Hispanic-American Heritage Month began in 1968 as Hispanic Heritage
week and was later extended to one month in 1988 by President Ronald
Reagan. The celebration date was chosen because of its proximity to
seven Latin American countries&apos; anniversary dates of independence.

Garcia noted that while cultural customs and traditions can be a
personal matter, it&apos;s important to observe and pass on your heritage.&quot;We have such a limited amount of time with our families that it&apos;s
important to remind each other of who we are,&quot;she said.&quot;You need to
know where you&apos;re from before you can know where you&apos;re going.&quot;For more news from USS Wasp (LHD 1), visit www.navy.mil/local/lhd1/.

NNS081012-09. USS Lake Erie Arrives in Kailua-Kona for Ironman Support

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Eric J. Cutright

KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii (NNS) -- The Ticonderoga-class guided missile
cruiser USS Lake Erie (CG 70) arrived in Kona Bay outside Kailua-Kona in
support of the 30th Ironman World Championship triathlon Oct. 10.

Lake Erie is scheduled to serve as a backdrop for the swim portion of
the triathlon and to provide support at transition stations during the
race Oct. 11, in commemoration of 30 years of the Navy&apos;s participation
in the Ironman event.&quot;The Ironman organization and all of its athletes hold dear core values
that we really identify with in the Navy: striving for excellence,
personal fitness, and commitment. Come [race day] you&apos;re going to look
out at that horizon and just past the turn-around of the swim course,
you&apos;ll see a very impressive sight: the pride of the Pacific Fleet, USS
Lake Erie,&quot;said Capt. Duncan Smith, spokesperson for Navy Special
Warfare Command.

Lt. Christa Almonte, the operations officer aboard Lake Erie, arrived in
Kailua-Kona Oct. 10 to present a plaque to the Ironman organization on
behalf of the officers and crew of the Lake Erie during a special dinner
event held at King Kamehameha Hotel.&quot;It was a great honor for us to be chosen. We&apos;re basically here to
represent the Navy&apos;s portion in this race and the Navy&apos;s history in the
beginning and throughout the years of this race,&quot;said Almonte.&quot;It&apos;s
our appreciation to Ironman for what they do.&quot;Crewmembers are scheduled to arrive via rigid hull inflatable boats
(RHIB) on race day to volunteer with assisting athletes during their
first transition from the swim phase to the bicycling phase of the event.&quot;We have several people volunteering throughout the transition stages to
assist the athletes as they come out of the water and start their ride,&quot;said Almonte.&quot;We&apos;ve come here basically to pay tribute to the start of
this race and egg the athletes on as they swim past our ship.&quot;On Oct. 11, 1,800 athletes, including six Sailors, will compete in the
event which includes 2.4 miles of swimming, 112 miles of biking and a
26.2-mile marathon run through tough ocean currents and challenging
lava-covered terrain.

The Ironman World Championship was first held in Kailua-Kona on the&quot;Big&quot;Island of Hawaii in 1978.

NNS081015-04. Dominican Doctors Conduct Surgeries Aboard Kearsarge

By Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Joshua A. Nuzzo, Continuing
Promise Public Affairs

USS KEARSARGE (NNS) -- Doctors from the Dominican Republic were invited
aboard USS Kearsarge (LHD 3) Oct. 12-13 and given the opportunity work
with the Continuing Promise (CP) 2008 medical staff during several
surgeries.

Eliecer Cruz Alvarez, Dominican Republic National Police general surgeon
and Heliodoro Andres Salas Cablera, Dominican Republic Navy
anesthesiologist, are the first Dominican doctors invited to come aboard
a U.S. Navy ship to perform operations during the CP 2008
humanitarian/civic assistance mission.&quot;I feel very good about working with the Kearsarge; it is a very
enchanting experience,&quot;said Alvarez.&quot;The ship is very impressive, and
the people that work on board are very special.&quot;The Dominican doctors assisted with five hernia operations and got the
opportunity to work with a Brazilian Navy surgeon, a volunteer surgeon
from the non-governmental organization Project Hope and U.S. Navy
doctors, nurses and hospital corpsmen.&quot;This was a great opportunity for me and my country,&quot;said Cablera.&quot;We
had problems with needing the proper equipment and finances that the
Continuing Promise mission has helped to solve.&quot;Alvarez, who assisted the CP 2008 medical team with patient screening,
echoed Cablera sentiments.&quot;It&apos;s good to have all the great nations come together and help the
Dominican Republic, said Alvarez.&quot;The surgical team aboard has a great
capacity for being able to help the people of the Dominican Republic,
and I would like to thank everyone who has participated in helping my
country.&quot;Not only did the patients who came aboard for these operations receive
the help they needed, but the doctors were also able to exchange
valuable professional information.&quot;The Dominican doctors were very receptive to ideas and expressed
gratitude toward everyone they worked with,&quot;said Enrique Abreu, an
anesthesiologist with Project Hope.&quot;The Dominicans were exposed to lots
of technology that they do not have access to and were interested in
bringing it to the Dominican Republic.&quot;Alvarez and Cablera were selected by the Dominican Republic Secretary of
State to assist and help organize all the events that have taken place
in the Dominican Republic for CP 2008.

After the Dominican Republic, Kearsarge will continue with the mission
in Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana.

CP is a collaborative effort between the United States and partner
militaries, non-governmental organizations and partner-nation support
organizations to build strong partnerships that can be called upon in
the event of a regional situation requiring cooperative solutions.

Kearsarge&apos;s mission is to conduct civil-military operations including
humanitarian and civic assistance as well as veterinary, medical, dental
and civil engineering support to six partner nations and to send a
strong message of United States compassion, support and commitment to
Central and South America and the Caribbean.

Kearsarge is currently under the operational control of U.S. 4th Fleet.
U.S. 4th Fleet&apos;s mission is to direct United States naval forces
operating in the Caribbean and Central and South American region and
interact with partner nation navies to shape the maritime environment.

Kearsarge&apos;s mission exemplifies the United States&apos; maritime strategy
which emphasizes deploying forces to build confidence and trust among
nations through collective maritime security efforts that focus on
common threats and mutual interests.

The CP Caribbean Phase is the second of two HCA deployments to the
Southern Command area of focus for 2008. The first CP deployment was
conducted by USS Boxer (LHD 4) in the Pacific.

NNS081015-02. Leaders, Community Celebrate Great White Fleet Aboard Nassau

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Riza Caparros, Fleet Public
Affairs Center Atlantic

NEW YORK (NNS) -- The amphibious transport ship USS Nassau (LHA-4)
visited New York City and took part in Navy Birthday, Columbus Day and
Great White Fleet festivities Oct. 12, which commemorated the 100th
anniversary of President Theodore Roosevelt&apos;s Great White Fleet.

During a reception on board, Donald C. Winter, Secretary of the Navy
(SECNAV), spoke about the history of the Great White Fleet and how
Roosevelt&apos;s vision of a strong Navy is still recognized and utilized today.&quot;Our Navy was built on great traditions,&quot;said Winter,&quot;including
humanitarian aid and building relations between our Navy and partnering
navies to work together toward a common goal of maritime security.&quot;When discussing the Great White Fleet&apos;s influence on today&apos;s Navy,
Winter said America is a respected world power, with a strong Navy
leading the way, and&quot;now one hundred years later, the future of the
United States as a great nation continues to depend on our continued
maritime superiority.&quot;CMDCM(AW/SW) Stanley Kopiczak, Nassau&apos;s command master chief, spoke
about the event and what it means to recognize the anniversary of the
Great White Fleet.&quot;I think the crew should be proud to have the event take place on our
ship,&quot;said Kopiczak.&quot;We remember the Great White Fleet and the
humanitarian relief aid they provided to Italy. We just returned from
providing humanitarian aid to our own country; we should be proud to
carry on the vision of Theodore Roosevelt.&quot;Louise Tallarini, president of Columbus Citizens Foundation, a nonprofit
organization recognizing Italian-Americans and their achievements,
addressed the crowd during the shipboard reception. He referenced the
Great White Fleet&apos;s humanitarian relief to Italy after an earthquake
devastated the city of Messina.&quot;We support our military, and we thank you,&quot;said Tallarini.

NNS081015-01. USS Abraham Lincoln Returns Home After Successful
Deployment to 5th, 7th Fleets

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Brandon C. Wilson and Mass
Communication Specialist 3rd Class Geoffrey Lewis

EVERETT, Wash. (NNS) -- USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72) returns to its
homeport of Everett, Wash., Oct. 12 after a successful seven-month
deployment supporting Operations Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Iraqi
Freedom (OIF) and maritime security and coalition operations in the U.S.
5th Fleet Area of Responsibility (AOR).

While supporting OEF and OIF from the Persian Gulf and North Arabian
Sea, Lincoln and embarked Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 2 flew approximately
7,100 sorties -- including 2,307 combat sorties, providing more than
22,000 flight hours -- and dropped 255,963 pounds of ordnance.&quot;We traveled over 60,000 miles, 2.3 times around the world,&quot;said USS
Abraham Lincoln&apos;s (CVN 72) Commanding Officer Capt. Patrick Hall.&quot;We
flew over 7,000 sorties -- 26,000 hours total -- and supported Sailors,
soldiers, airmen and Marines on the ground in both Afghanistan and Iraq.&quot;Hall said that with all the miles traveled and missions flown, Lincoln&apos;s
crew always had safety in mind.&quot;The good thing is that all the Sailors who left on deployment with us
are coming back off deployment,&quot;he said.

Lincoln also re-enlisted more than 180 Sailors, collectively equaling
more than 700 years of new service to the Navy. Other individual
achievements include 749 Sailors completing 20 different college classes.

Along with five months of combat operations, Lincoln hosted Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen and dignitaries and military
officials from Cambodia, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, France, Bahrain
and Pakistan. Lincoln&apos;s embarked distinguished visitors totaled more
than 230 from 20 different countries.

During deployment, Lincoln conducted two burials at sea for 40 veterans
and family members.

After successfully completing operations in the U.S. 5th Fleet AOR where
Sailors enjoyed port visits in the Persian Gulf region, Lincoln sailed
to the U.S. 7th Fleet AOR and participated in 16 community relations
projects with 400 volunteers, contributing more than 2,000 hours to
communities in Singapore and Thailand.

The total distance steamed during deployment was 58,370 miles, or
approximately 2.3 times around the world. Electrical power generated
during deployment totaled 52,000 megawatt hours, enough to power the
entire downtown Seattle network for roughly two weeks. Fresh water
produced totaled 58,240 gallons, enough to support more than 1 million
showers for crew personnel.

With the deployment completed, Lincoln and its crew will enjoy some time
off before heading out to sea again for an upcoming sustainment period.

Hall said the returning Sailors have earned some well-deserved time off
from the 214 days at sea.&quot;It&apos;s tremendous coming home to all the friends and families, they&apos;re
all so excited and looking forward to going home and relaxing&quot;he said.

NNS081014-09. Multitude of Reagan Sailors Re-enlist, Earn Multiple
Benefits on Navy Birthday

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Aaron Holt, USS Ronald Reagan
Public Affairs

USS RONALD REAGAN (NNS) -- More than 70 Sailors assigned to the USS
Ronald Reagan (CVN 76) and Carrier Air Wcng (CVW) 14 gathered on the
flight deck of the Nimitz-Class aircraft carrier Oct. 13 to reaffirm
their oath of enlistment during a mass re-enlistment ceremony.

Approximately $2.4 million in Selective Re-enlistment Bonus&apos; (SRB) were
awarded to re-enlisting Sailors. The benefits are not taxable, as the
ship is currently operating in the 5th Fleet area of operations, and
combat zone tax exclusion applies. Sailors also received other perks,
such as special liberty, 30 days of duty exemption and head-of-the-line
privileges.

But for many Ronald Reagan Sailors, the biggest reward was the chance to
continue to serve their country at sea.&quot;I feel that being in the Navy is fun, and it&apos;s the right thing to do
right now with everything that&apos;s going on in the world,&quot;said
Information Systems Technician 2nd Class Steve Song.&quot;When you enjoy
something, you want to do it for a long time.&quot;Capt. Thomas Lalor, commander CVW-14, said the timing and the
circumstances of the ceremony made it particularly special. Hours after
taking the oath, the Sailors were back at work, helping launch CVW-14
aircraft into Afghanistan.&quot;Being there on the same day as the Navy&apos;s birthday and while on the
front lines defending our country&apos;s freedom made it a very special
occasion,&quot;said Lalor.

The Ronald Reagan Carrier Strike Group is deployed to the U.S. 5th fleet
area of operations in support of regional security. Operations are
focused on reassuring regional partners of the United States&apos; commitment
to security, which promotes stability and global prosperity.

NNS081014-03. U.S. Navy Staff Embarks HMS Ark Royal for Multinational
Exercise

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Stephen Tate, Destroyer
Squadron 24 Public Affairs

HMS ARK ROYAL, At Sea (NNS) -- The staff assigned to Commander,
Destroyer Squadron (COMDESRON) 24, embarked aboard the HMS Ark Royal
(R07) Oct. 6-17 to serve as the task group command and control element
during the multinational exercise Joint Warrior.

Joint Warrior is a multi-platform course led by the Joint Tactical
Exercise Planning Staff (JTEPS) in the United Kingdom. The biannual
exercise brings together Navy, Marine, Army and Air Force units from
various allied and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries
to practice interoperability and joint rules of engagement in a
controlled environment.&quot;Joint Warrior allows the U.S and allied navies to explore real-world
challenges on a strategic, operational, and tactical level,&quot;said Capt.
John Kersh, commander of Destroyer Squadron 24.&quot;We also have the unique
opportunity to work side-by-side with our British counterparts aboard a
Royal Navy aircraft carrier. At the end of the day, we&apos;ll all be much
further along in integrated training.&quot;According to Sailors assigned to COMDESRON 24, the opportunity to work
aboard a Royal Navy ship has been an overwhelmingly positive experience.&quot;It&apos;s been great thus far,&quot;said Operations Specialist 1st Class (SW)
Jason Perez.&quot;You learn about how another navy operates and how you can
speak a common operating language to work efficiently with our allies.&quot;One of the challenges for any embarked staff is to integrate their
operations into the daily battle rhythm of their host ship. COMDESRON 24
staff members quickly formed a cohesive team with the officers and crew
of Ark Royal.&quot;It has been a pretty seamless adjustment for the staff,&quot;said Lt. Cmdr.
Rodney Ferioli, the staff intelligence officer for COMDESRON 24.&quot;Our
operations are very tied together, and we have built solid relationships
with our British counterparts.&quot;Sailors from both navies agree that an exercise like Joint Warrior is
all about building partnerships.&quot;This is all about working better with our allies,&quot;said Perez.&quot;Our
joint operations will result in better teamwork when we have to operate
in a real-world environment.&quot;COMDESRON 24 is currently embarked aboard HMS Ark Royal and underway off
the coast of Scotland in support of Joint Warrior. The participating
multi-national force brings together 33 ships and military units from
eight nations: the United Kingdom, United States, France, Netherlands,
Germany, Sweden, Denmark and New Zealand.

NNS081015-03. Naval Station Crews Assist City of Rota After Violent Storm

By Lt. Mike Morley, Naval Station Rota Public Affairs

ROTA, Spain (NNS) -- Naval Station Rota emergency responders assisted
the local community after a massive thunderstorm pounded the area with
more than 10 inches of rain and winds of more than 92 mph Oct. 11,
downing trees and flooding intersections.

While the base only sustained minor damage, including sporadic power
outages, emergency crews quickly realized that the more significant
damage occurred in the local community outside the gate.&quot;We received a call from the City of Rota on Saturday morning,
requesting assistance with areas that had flooded,&quot;said Rob Paulette,
Naval Station Rota&apos;s Emergency Management director.&quot;There were several
flooded intersections and streets, homes with flooded basements and
parking garages underneath apartment buildings. We immediately focused
our efforts on dewatering.&quot;The base sent 21 people from the fire department and public works, along
with two pumper trucks and two fire engines, to assist in dewatering
efforts. Working for about 30 hours throughout Saturday and Sunday, the
crews dewatered more than 120,000 gallons of water from the basements
and garages of American and Spanish residents.&quot;The damage was unbelievable. In the homes, there was three feet of
standing water, and in the garages, there was about 10 feet. The cars
were completely submerged,&quot;said the Military Division Officer for
Rota&apos;s Public Works branch, Lt. j.g. Mike Hightower.&quot;We provided two
generator pumps and a pump truck, along with Seabees to run them. We
were dewatering six basements and yards, then moved the truck and pumped
out the parking garage underneath an apartment.&quot;Five vehicles belonging to Americans stationed at Rota were completely
flooded during the storm, with more than a dozen other residents
reporting damage to furniture, clothing and appliances in basements.

No estimate of damages to Spanish-owned property was available.

NNS081014-10. Sailors in Iraq Celebrate Navy&apos;s Birthday with Fellow
Service Members

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SCW) Michael B. Lavender,
Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 7 Public Affairs

AR RAMADI, Iraq (NNS) -- Sailors currently serving in units supporting
coalition forces in Iraq celebrated the Navy&apos;s 233rd birthday Oct. 13
with members of the Army, Air Force and Marine Corps, all wearing
uniforms saying&quot;U.S. Navy.&quot;&quot;This was the first time I&apos;ve seen this ceremony,&quot;said Hospital
Corpsman Jonathan Weston, a field corpsman assigned to 2nd Battalion,
11th Marines.&quot;I&apos;ve been in for two-and-a-half years, and this has
definitely been a memorable experience especially for those of us who&apos;ve
never seen or attended a Navy birthday party.&quot;It&apos;s nice to see all the different service[s wearing] uniforms that say
&apos;U.S. Navy.&apos; To me, it&apos;s a unique experience that I&apos;ll never forget.&quot;Sailors here are assigned to either Task Force Ramadi or Navy, Army or
U.S. Marine Corps units. All of them support coalition forces in some way.

Sailors&apos; roles in these units range from providing medical and religious
support to providing public affairs support.&quot;We&apos;re away from the fleet,&quot;said Weston.&quot;In the fleet, these
ceremonies are larger and probably far grander. It&apos;s the fact that we&apos;re
here in Iraq, alongside fellow Sailors from Army, Navy and Marine Corps
units, that makes this so special. I think this small ceremony means
just as much as any larger celebration in the fleet.&quot;To commemorate this occasion, a ceremony was held that included a
narration of the history of the U.S. Navy.&quot;On this 233rd birthday of the United States Navy, you should take
unique pride in knowing that your service and your sacrifice continue to
do honor to a great nation,&quot;said Navy Capt. Stephen Schrader, Task
Force Ramadi&apos;s director of quality assurance to the Sailors from various
commands.&quot;Two hundred thirty-three years of excellence, honor and
service to this world is certainly an amazing accomplishment. America,
our friends and allies around the world respect and appreciate your
commitment.&quot;The conclusion to the ceremony, following tradition, was the cutting of
the cake with the guest of honor and the oldest and youngest Sailors
sharing the first slice.&quot;This ceremony was very inspiring to me,&quot;said Equipment Operator 2nd
Class Adam Faber, a Seabee assigned to NMCB 7&apos;s Alpha Company.&quot;I&apos;ve
been in for a few years now, and this was the first Navy birthday
celebration I&apos;ve been to. It was a great ceremony and enforced the
traditions the Navy was founded upon.&quot;For more news from around the fleet, visit www.navy.mil.

NNS081014-02. Seabees Refurbish Local Facilities, Strengthen Pacific
Partnership

By Oyaol Ngirairikl, U.S. Naval Forces Marianas Public Affairs

SANTA RITA, Guam (NNS) -- Residents of Weno island of Chuuk State,
Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), have a cleaner and safer hospital
and elementary school thanks to Seabees and other construction personnel
attached to Pacific Partnership 2008.

On Sept. 10, island residents celebrated the newly renovated facilities
with ribbon-cutting ceremonies, and invited Rear Adm. Bill French,
commander of U.S. Naval Forces Marianas (COMNAVMAR) to participate in
the festivities.&quot;The people of the FSM are grateful to Rear Adm. French and Ambassador
Miriam Hughes who worked hard  to include the FSM in Pacific
Partnership 2008,&quot;said FSM Vice President Alik Alik.&quot;We note with
appreciation the hard work and dedication given to the projects  to
help improve the quality of life for the people of Chuuk.&quot;Seabees from Naval Mobile Construction Battalion (NMCB) 133 and more
than 15 volunteers from the Naval hospital ship USNS Mercy (T-AH 19)
renovated the Chuuk State Hospital at Weno Island. The renovations to
the hospital, which cost more than $80,000, will benefit patients from
the various islands that make up Chuuk State.

Renovations to the hospital included repairing, painting and preserving
several different facilities at the hospital including the female,
pediatric and emergency rooms. It also involved the construction of
intensive care units and family consultation rooms in the female wards.

The Seabees and volunteers also installed and repaired several lighting
systems around the hospital.

At Mwan Elementary School in Fefen, classrooms were refurbished, the
roof repaired and offices were renovated.

During the 10-day visit in the Federated States of Micronesia, the
Pacific Partnership 2008 mission also provided humanitarian civic
assistance in the form of medical, dental and engineering civic action
programs.

Though humanitarian assistance and engineering projects were the goal of
Pacific Partnership, the partnership between the crew of Mercy and the
people of Micronesia was at the heart of the mission.

Lt. Amy Yoon was officer in charge of the projects. During the
ribbon-cutting ceremony at Mwan Elementary School, she thanked the
residents, many of whom assisted with the projects, some because they
were asked and others who volunteered on their own.&quot;That is something that we&apos;d like to acknowledge because there are very
few projects where we see the local residents outnumber our own Seabee
crew. That was something that was amazing to me,&quot;Yoon told Weno
residents.&quot;We hope that you will use this school to educate your
children who we know have great potential and your staff who have shown
that they cared, on a daily basis showing their support.&quot;French said the actions that Yoon acknowledged are indicative of a
strong partnership between the United States and the Federated States of
Micronesia.&quot;It&apos;s a bond unlike anywhere else,&quot;French said.&quot;It&apos;s an opportunity
for us to work together on the same objective and the same focus.&quot;For more news from U.S. Naval Forces, Marianas, visit

NNS081014-07. Sailors, Marines Honored by New York City Foundation

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Riza Caparros, Fleet Public
Affairs Center Atlantic

NEW YORK (NNS) -- Sailors and Marines were recognized by the Columbus
Citizens Foundation during a gala dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel
Oct. 11 as part of its annual Columbus Day celebration.

The service members -- four in all -- were recognized by the non-profit
organization for various reasons, but all four award recipients recently
returned from tours in Iraq or Afghanistan.

Religious Program Specialist 2nd Class(SW) Desire Nana was one of the
two Sailors recognized during the gala for his services in Iraq when he
deployed as part of a religious ministry team providing vital spiritual
services to service members stationed at Camp Al Asad.&quot;I&apos;m very proud and thankful to serve my country,&quot;said Nana, who is
currently assigned to USS Nassau.&quot;I feel like I&apos;m doing something good,
and it pushes me to do more for my Navy. Tonight made me really feel
proud for serving in the Navy and really proud to serve my country.&quot;Also attending the black-tie event was retired Adm. Edmund P.
Giambastiani Jr., who will serve as the Columbus Celebration 2008 parade
marshall. He commented how the Sailors and Marines receiving the awards
represent the fighting spirit of the Great White Fleet and today&apos;s Navy.&quot;This night is about those who operate and provide the services of the
Navy  who provide the humanitarian assistance, who provide deterrence,
who are out there on watch around the world every day doing what this
country needs to protect it,&quot;said Giambastiani.&quot;In my 41 years in the
Navy, I still see today what I learned when I first came in - that the
Navy is about the Sailors and their dedication to serve in it.&quot;The annual Columbus Day celebration observes the culture and traditions
of Italy, both abroad and in the United States. The celebration includes
exhibitions in Grand Central Terminal, a wreath laying at Columbus
Circle, the Columbus Day Solemn Mass at St. Patrick&apos;s Cathedral and
culminates with the Columbus Day Parade on New York City&apos;s Fifth Avenue.

NNS081014-11. Oakland Navy League Hosts BBQ for Bonhomme Richard, Pinckney

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Mark Patterson II, USS
Bonhomme Richard Public Affairs

SAN FRANCISCO (NNS) -- The Oakland Navy League, with help from the San
Francisco Police Department and the Oakland Athletics hosted a pierside
barbecue for the Sailors and Marines of USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD 6) and
USS Pinckney (DDG 91) Oct. 12.

The eighth annual event, held each year during Fleet Week, provided
Sailors and Marines of Bonhomme Richard the chance to relax and enjoy a
hearty meal before setting off on liberty.

According to Joe Lozano, president of the Oakland Navy League Council,
the event is their way of showing appreciation to the men and women
serving in today&apos;s military.&quot;I think it is important for us to show our support to these men and
women who are giving the people of the United States our safety and our
security,&quot;said Lozano.&quot;I want them to feel at home. This is our little
way of saying thank you for what they do for us.

Aside from the free food, Sailors and Marines were also given Oakland
A&apos;s memorabilia.&quot;This entire event from the time they come through the entry gate is
free,&quot;said Lozano&quot;They don&apos;t have to spend a dime. In eight years we
have not had one problem. It&apos;s been great.&quot;Cryptologic Technician Collections 2nd Class Adam Crismond said this
event was one he will never forget.&quot;I definitely enjoyed this event,&quot;said Crismond.&quot;I enjoyed the fact
that the city of San Francisco and its people would embrace the Navy and
provide us with some great raffle opportunities and free food. It was a
great experience.&quot;Bonhomme Richard and Pinckney are in San Francisco for Fleet Week 2008.
More than 1,500 Sailors, Marines and Coast Guardsmen are taking part in
the celebration of the sea services, which is an opportunity to showcase
military personnel, equipment, technology and capabilities.

NNS081014-04. Top Military Officer Meets Recruiters During LA Trip

By Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class David McKee, Navy Recruiting
District Los Angeles Public Affairs

LOS ANGELES (NNS) -- The Chairman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff met with
300 local recruiters representing all five branches of the military on
the University of Southern California Campus in Los Angeles Sept. 22.

Adm. Michael Mullen, a Fernando Valley, Calif., native, told the
audience he understands the importance of recruiting America&apos;s best and
brightest young men and women and appreciates their dedication during a
time when two wars are having a definite impact on recruiting.&quot;This is an area where your avocation to recruit young people into the
military is as vital as any part of our profession. At least from where
I&apos;ve been in the last several years, the recruiting side of the business
has gone very, very well,&quot;Mullen said.

After he spoke to the audience, he took questions from members who asked
about recruiting issues, deployment duration, operational tempo and the
shape of the future&apos;s military.

His five-day visit to Los Angeles included attending a Dodgers Game
during which he threw out the first pitch, visiting the facility for the
Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System and returning to
his alma mater, Notre Dame High School, where he talked to students
about his career in the Navy that began 44 years ago when he was 17.

The trip was also a chance to engage in discussions about the wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq and the state of the military in an interview with
the Public Broadcasting Service. At one point in the interview, he
echoed statements he made to the recruiters the day before when he
complimented not only recruiters for the work they do but praised the
whole American military serving today.&quot;We&apos;ve got the best military,&quot;Mullen said.&quot;I&apos;ve been doing this for
40-plus years It&apos;s the best military I&apos;ve ever been associated with --
2.2 million active and Reserve and Guard from all services, and they are
absolutely spectacular.&quot;The meeting with recruiters ended with Mullen presenting his challenge
coin to all members of the audience.

Mullen was sworn in as the 17th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Oct. 1, 2007. He serves as the principal military advisor to the
President, the Secretary of Defense, the National Security Council, and
the Homeland Security Council.

NNS081016-27. Pacific Fleet Commander Addresses Motorcycle Safety

By Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Luke J. Perry, Commander,
U.S. Pacific Fleet Public Affairs

PEARL HARBOR (NNS) -- In his latest edition of the&quot;Rat-Pac Report&quot;podcast and blog, posted Oct. 15, Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet joined
Pacific Fleet Master Chief in discussing motorcycle safety and the
responsibilities of those who ride such vehicles.&quot;The Fleet Master Chief and I had a recent discussion regarding
motorcycles and the impact that they&apos;re having on our Navy,&quot;said Adm.
Robert F. Willard.&quot;We recently experienced four Sailor deaths in two
weeks due to motorcycle accidents. This has been a particularly bad year
for motorcycles and motorcycle safety.&quot;According to Navy Safety Center, personal motor vehicles (PMV) accidents
resulted in 111 deaths in FY2008. Of that 111, 58 occurred on
motorcycles and 51 were on sport bikes. Sport bikes differ from standard
motorcycles in that many weigh less than 450 pounds, come with engines
600cc and higher, are tuned for racing and are highly maneuverable.&quot;We are still not doing our part as Sailors in ensuring we are adhering
to the rules and regulations governing this extremely important safety
matter,&quot;said Fleet Master Chief Tom Howard.&quot;If you own a motorcycle of
any sort, it is your responsibility to have the proper personal
equipment (PPE) and the proper training to operate that bike. Whether
you ride the bike on base or off, PPE and training are required.&quot;Riders are required to take a Motorcycle Safety Foundation safety course
in order to ride on or off base. Additionally, the Navy and Marine Corps
have teamed with the foundation and developed a course tailored
specifically for sport bikes. The goal is to reduce the risk of injury
and death.&quot;This is something that we must contain, and you have to help one
another do it,&quot;said Willard.&quot;I need every Sailor that operates a
motorcycle and every Sailor that knows a Sailor that operates a
motorcycle, to support one another to ensure that we&apos;re adhering to all
of the training.&quot;The Basic Rider Course (BRC) is a three day course required for all
military service members riding a motorcycle on or off base. Military
Sport-bike Rider Course (MSRC) is a one-day course designed specifically
for all sport bike riders.

For more information on these courses contact your local safety office
or visit http://www.safetycenter.navy.mil. The latest podcast and blog are available for download on the Pacific
Fleet Web site, www.cpf.navy.mil.

A new&quot;Rat-Pac Report&quot;is scheduled to appear on the site weekly.

A former resident of Yokosuka Naval Base posted his thoughts on
Willard&apos;s blog.&quot;Let me encourage all young Sailors, Airmen and Marines - if you must
buy a motorcycle, begin with a starter motorcycle. They usually have a
250 cc engine and are easy handling and forgiving when you make the
mistakes that are typical of new and inexperienced riders.&quot;For more news from Pacific Fleet, visit www.navy.mil/local/cpf/.

NNS081016-28. MCPON Visits, Speaks with Sailors in Guam

By Jesse Leon Guerrero, U.S. Naval Forces Marianas Public Affairs

SANTA RITA, GUAM (NNS) -- The Navy&apos;s senior enlisted Sailor spent
several days on Guam, beginning Oct. 3, during which time he focused on
getting to know the Sailors on the island and making sure they know what
he expects of each of them.

During the visit Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy (SW/FMF) Joe
Campa, Jr., (MCPON) emphasized the importance of Sailors taking care of
one another and the challenges of being a wartime Navy.

Campa said he held wants the enlisted community to understand what is
expected of them, especially as they continue to advance and gain new
responsibilities.&quot;Good leadership is going to get us through this tough time, and we&apos;re
seeing it work,&quot;said Campa.&quot;We&apos;re seeing Sailors do phenomenal things.&quot;MCPON started his tour at Camp Covington on U.S. Naval Base Guam, where
he had breakfast with Naval Mobile Construction Battalion (NMCB) 133.

Constructionman Zechariah Brice, of NMCB-133, appreciated getting to
talk to Campa about their construction projects, deployment schedule and
other Seabee activities.&quot;I never met him before so it was interesting to meet him,&quot;said Brice.

Machinery Repairman 3rd Class (SW) Jerrell Boswell, the 2007 Sailor of
the Year for USS Frank Cable (AS 40), said it was an honor to meet Campa
after the MCPON toured through the submarine tender&apos;s machine shop.

Boswell added it was also inspiring because Campa had previously served
as the command master chief aboard Frank Cable.&quot;It just lets me know that someone from this platform can go above and
beyond and do great things,&quot;said Boswell.

Standing atop Frank Cable&apos;s starboard deck, Campa thanked the crew and
their families for the sacrifices they make daily.&quot;It&apos;s the resources and things that we do out here in this part of the
world that&apos;s critical,&quot;said Campa.&quot;As we look out for each other at
sea, we have to be just as committed to each other when we&apos;re at shore.&quot;For more news from U.S. Naval Forces, Marianas, visit

NNS081016-18. EODMU-1 Deploys in Support of Joint, Combined Operations

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SW/AW) Brian Gaines, Fleet
Public Affairs Center, Pacific

SAN DIEGO (NNS) -- Members of Explosive Ordnance Disposal Mobile Unit
(EODMU) 1 deployed Oct. 14 to the Middle East to provide command and
control of EOD&apos;s efforts to counter-improvised explosive devices.

Navy EOD deployed platoons in support of Operations Iraqi Freedom and
Enduring Freedom since 2001 and has been deployed mobile units as
command and control elements since 2006. This is the fifth Navy EOD
battalion deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.&quot;Although security has vastly improved, IEDs [improvised explosive
devices] are still a tangible threat in the Northern Iraq area of
responsibility,&quot;said Cmdr. Eric Wirstrom, commanding officer, EODMU 1.&quot;I am very confident in the abilities of the Sailors, Soldiers and
Airmen deploying today.&quot;EODMU 1&apos;s headquarters element will be based in Tikrit, Iraq, in direct
support of the U.S Army&apos;s 25th Infantry Division. It will be provide
command and control for 36 Army, Air Force and Navy EOD teams in area of
operations in Northern Iraq.&quot;We are excited to deploy. Our job is to support the team on the ground
in defeating the device and the network,&quot;said Lt. Cmdr. William
Richardson, EODMU 1 executive officer.&quot;We also want to bring our men
and women home safely.&quot;EODMU 1 technicians are deployed throughout U.S. Central Command and are
regularly called upon to render safe conventional ordnance, IEDs,
landmines and weapons of mass destruction. EOD technicians also conduct
force protection diving operations and underwater countermeasures.

For families, deployment brings its share of anxieties and hope.&quot;I know he is fighting for our freedom and the freedom of the Iraqi
people,&quot;said Denise Pinard, wife of Electronics Technician 1st Class
(SW) Russell Pinard.&quot;That&apos;s what keeps me going.&quot;Pinard added that her husband will stay connected to his family through
phone calls, e-mails and the United Through Reading program.

EODMU 1 is homeported at Naval Base Coronado and is part of the Navy
Expeditionary Combat Command. U.S. Navy EOD is considered by some as the
world&apos;s premier combat force for countering IEDs, weapons of mass
destruction and other types of weaponry. Navy EOD technicians are often
the&quot;first in,&quot;enabling access for further combat operations in every
environment, on the ground, in the air and under the sea.

NNS081016-26. Wasp Wins Second Straight &apos;Good Neighbor&apos; Award for
Efforts at Home and Abroad

By Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Johnny Michael, USS Wasp
Public Affairs

PORTSMOUTH, Va. (NNS) -- The USS Wasp (LHD 1) Community Relations
Program was recognized for the second year in a row as one of the best
in the region when Commander Navy Region Mid-Atlantic announced its 2008
Community Service of the Year awards Sept. 30.

The Navy Community Service Awards Program recognizes sea and shore
commands in three group sizes  fewer than 200 personnel, 200 to 499
personnel, and 500 and above  in each of the five flagship areas.

Wasp was announced as the winner in the&quot;Sea Large&quot;category of the
Project Good Neighbor competition, earning that distinction for the
second consecutive year. An estimated 575 Wasp volunteers provided more
than 4,800 man-hours during the past year as Wasp tackled goodwill
projects in its homeport area of Hampton Roads and in various locations
across the globe.

Wasp Commanding Officer, Capt. Daniel H. Fillion, noted the wide-ranging
nature of the projects and the exuberance of his crew in supporting
those events.&quot;The strong commitment and zeal of Team Wasp in volunteering for
substantial and truly meaningful command-sponsored community service
projects both locally and internationally continue to dynamically impact
communities worldwide,&quot;said Fillion.&quot;This continues to reinforce the
values that make a difference in the lives of others as well as the
lives of our Sailors and Marines who take great pride in their volunteer
community service.&quot;The Wasp community relations program is managed by the ship&apos;s chaplain&apos;s
department, and Cmdr. Bruce Boyle was Wasp&apos;s group chaplain during the
award period. Boyle expressed delight at the accomplishment but noted
that he expected nothing less from Team Wasp.&quot;The crew of the Wasp is not only dedicated to the job of protecting our
country, but they are committed to the helping of people worldwide,&quot;said Boyle.&quot;All of our Sailors truly go above and beyond themselves in
everything they do. It&apos;s so refreshing to see young people volunteer
their time to people in need.&quot;Lt. Cmdr. Dean Hoelz, Wasp&apos;s current chaplain, echoed Boyle&apos;s sentiment
and added his regard for the spirit of charity found in Wasp Sailors.&quot;This award reflects the generosity of the ship&apos;s crew,&quot;said Hoelz.&quot;Our Sailors give 24/7. We think of them just giving here at work, but
there is so much more. Just look at how many activities these Sailors
participate in, from the community relations events to their local youth
sports to their own religious or civic organizations.&quot;Locally, Wasp had a notable impact on many projects in need of manpower,
including the Hampton Roads Hospice House.&quot;I cannot express my gratitude for what these Sailors have done,&quot;said
Hospice House Community Relations Coordinator Jessica Plank.&quot;They all
seem very interested in what we do, and many have expressed interest in
doing more.&quot;As the ship traveled away from its homeport, it continued to find worthy
projects, including Habitat for Humanity in Jacksonville, Fla., where
the ship made a port call in February.

Cryptologic Technician (Collection) 1st Class Jill Violini participated
in the event and noted that in addition to the personal satisfaction she
receives during such endeavors, the Navy itself also benefits.&quot;The opportunity to volunteer in general is always a good thing,&quot;said
Violini.&quot;But being able to volunteer in the name of the Navy  to put
our service branch out there with a positive spin  makes it all the
more worthwhile.&quot;While participating in an exercise in Panama, Sailors aboard Wasp
volunteered to rehab a youth center in Colon and collected and donated
6,000 pounds of textbooks to the Panamanian Minister of Education&apos;s&quot;English for Life&quot;program.

The books from Wasp were spread out to as many schools and students as
possible, explained Miguel Barrios, a staff member of the Ministry of
Education, who expressed his gratitude for the Wasp&apos;s assistance.

Other projects Wasp Sailors have participated in include the Norfolk and
Portsmouth offices of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals (SPCA), the Virginia Beach Samaritan House, the Union Mission in
Norfolk, Hodges Manor Elementary School in Portsmouth, Mack Benn, Jr.
Elementary School in Suffolk, the Food Bank of Southeastern Virginia,
the Live United Community Clean-up following the devastation caused by
tornadoes in Suffolk, Clean the Bay Day, the Children Harbor Child Care
Center and the more than 100,000 work hours Wasp Sailors committed to
the disaster relief effort in Nicaragua in the wake of Hurricane Felix.

NNS081016-16. Bonhomme Richard Sailors Serve Up Good Will at San
Francisco Ronald McDonald House

By Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class (SW/AW) Ryan Tabios, USS
Bonhomme Richard Public Affairs

SAN FRANCISCO (NNS) -- Sailors from the amphibious assault ship USS
Bonhomme Richard (LHD 6) took part in a community relations (COMRELS)
project at the San Francisco Ronald McDonald House Oct. 13, during San
Francisco Fleet Week 2008.

During their time at the Ronald McDonald House, Bonhomme Richard&apos;s
volunteers prepared spaghetti and served the children and their
families&apos; dinner.&quot;Taking the time to give back promotes a positive relationship between
the community and the Navy,&quot;said Yeoman 1st Class (AW) Jennifer Perry.&quot;COMRELs also help maintain a positive image of Sailors. San Francisco
has been great to Sailors and this is our way of saying thank you.&quot;The Ronald McDonald House is a non-profit organization that provides a
home away from home for families of seriously ill children receiving
treatment at nearby hospitals.&quot;We are so grateful that the Sailors are able to do this for the
families. We have been waiting and talking about it for awhile,&quot;said
Jackie Okamura, Ronald McDonald House business manager.&quot;We have
different organizations prepare home-cooked meals for about three
quarters of the month and we are really appreciative.&quot;Some of the families are at the hospital all day long and may come back
with not-so-great news,&quot;said Okamura.&quot;They are completely drained and
coming back to a home-cooked meal after a rough day brightens up their
day even if for a moment.&quot;After dinner the Sailors served ice cream, cleaned-up and enjoyed a
movie with the residents of the house.&quot;Getting involved in the community gives me a good feeling inside,&quot;said
Intelligence Specialist 1st Class (SW/AW) Franklin Cheromiah.&quot;Being
able to make a difference in the lives of families is all the worth while.&quot;The Ronald McDonald House showed their appreciation to the Sailors by
presenting them with a banner signed by the residents.&quot;We are totally indebted for you all to taking your time to do this for
us and sharing your stories,&quot;said Angela West, resident manager.&quot;We
are thankful and appreciative for what you do every day.&quot;For more news from USS Bonhomme Richard, visit www.navy.mil/local/lhd6/.

NNS081016-11. Rushmore Completes ASW Tests on Nanoose Range

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Damien E. Horvath, Fleet
Public Affairs Center Pacific

USS RUSHMORE, British Columbia (NNS) -- USS Rushmore (LSD 47) completed
10 days of intense torpedo firing exercises and developmental surface
ship torpedo defense experimentation at the Canadian Forces Maritime
Experimental and Test Ranges (CFMETR) on Oct. 10.

CFMETR, commonly referred to as the Nanoose Firing Range, presented an
opportunity for Rushmore Sailors, in conjunction with representatives
and from the Program Executive Officer, Submarine&apos;s (PEO SUB) Undersea
Defensive Warfare Systems Office, Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC),
Office of Naval Research (ONR), and research teams from John Hopkins and
Penn State Universities, to actively test both new and developing
technologies, as well as maintain and sharpen skills on current weapons
and defense systems.

Rushmore entered the 56 square-mile Nanoose Range to serve as the main
test platform for sea trials and to provide existing personnel,
communication capabilities, and technological support to conduct a
series of coordinated exercises with temporarily-installed test
equipment and research teams located on the flight deck, and the Range
Operations Center (ROC) located on Winchelsea Island overlooking the range.&quot;The ROC serves as the epicenter, or main hub for all of the data
collected from the exercises being conducted on the range,&quot;said Range
Officer, Canadian Armed Forces, Lt. Ralph Burgess.&quot;In this particular
series of exercises, we receive all the unrefined numbers, be it from
Rushmore or any other smaller boats or aircraft contributing to
operations, and store it both electronically and sometimes in hard
copies for further analysis by the appropriate individuals or research
teams.&quot;During range testing, Rushmore acted as a target ship in a simulated
hostile environment, receiving numerous incoming threats from various
types of torpedoes ranging from one-at-a-time to multiple shot
evolutions. The ship and the research teams aboard then deployed
existing torpedo countermeasure technology like the SLQ-25C (NIXIE) as
well some developing surface ship torpedo defense technologies like
prototype anti-torpedo torpedoes fired from the flight deck of Rushmore.

Many different components must work in unison to ensure safe and
successful exercises. A multitude of aircraft and smaller vessels play
an integral part in range operations including the CP-140 Aurora
Maritime Surveillance aircraft and the Canadian Armed Forces CH-124 Sea
King.

After a particular exercise is complete, it is the responsibility of
Navy divers to recover the buoyant test torpedoes. Working from Torpedo
Weapons Retriever (TWR) small boats, the diver harnesses the floating
torpedo, and the TWR crew uses a winch to pull it from the water and
secure it to specially designed rollers for transportation to shore or
one of the range&apos;s two 187-foot Yard Tender Torpedo (YTT) boats that
have on-board underwater torpedo launch systems that fire the majority
of the test torpedoes.&quot;I have had the pleasure of working with some of the finest Sailors the
Navy has to offer on my TWR,&quot;said TWR small craft operator Mike Allen.&quot;There have been some very testing times out here, unpredictable weather
and sometimes unpredictable range schedules, but everyone does their
part to accomplish the desired end result.&quot;In addition to recovery by TWR, the range also possesses the capability
to recover test torpedoes by helicopter and various underwater retrieval
methods.&quot;Rushmore crew has done well in demonstrating the ship&apos;s capabilities to
conduct anti-submarine warfare testing and to support the scientists and
engineers,&quot;said Rushmore Commanding Officer, Cmdr. Calvin Slocumb.&quot;The opportunities I have had to command Rushmore on deployment,
participate in the Great White Fleet, and now to support future
developments to improve amphibious ships&apos; survivability against a
subsurface threat underscores the importance of training the crew and
maintaining a warship ready for tasking. It&apos;s an honor to serve on the
ship selected to take part in this important operation.&quot;Canadian Forces have operated a torpedo test range on the west coast of
Canada since 1954, but in 1965 under an international agreement between
Canada and the United States the Nanoose Range was officially
established. Since then, Nanoose Range has played host to a wide variety
of American and allied forces surface ships and submarines conducting
high-tech and fast-paced exercises and experimentation for practical
application in today&apos;s ever-changing global maritime environment.

NNS081016-07. British Training Officers Tour Great Lakes

By Scott A. Thornbloom, Naval Service Training Command Public Affairs

GREAT LAKES (NNS) -- Flag officers from the British Navy reviewed U.S.
Navy training at Naval Station Great Lakes Oct. 2-3.

Commodores Campbell S. Christie and Steve Kirby spent two days touring
Training Support Center (TSC)&quot;A&quot;and&quot;C&quot;schools and observing the
training of recruits at the U.S. Navy&apos;s only boot camp, Recruit Training
Command (RTC).&quot;We&apos;ve been extremely well hosted. We&apos;ve met some very good friends that
are part of the coalition that are fighting terrorism around the world.
We are very similar, and we&apos;re very different,&quot;said Christie, the
assistant chief of staff (training), Fleet Command (U.K.).&quot;But the heart of the matter is the core values (U.S.) Sailors and
(U.K.) sailors are developing, and the training teams developing them,
are identical. The spirit of that coalition is also very strong.&quot;Christie and Kirby also visited the Center for Naval Engineering
Learning site and the Center for Surface Combat Systems at TSC. They
toured various training sites on RTC, including the combat training
pool, USS Indianapolis and Freedom Hall, where recruits train for their
physical fitness assessment.

Christie said he noticed many similarities in the attitude, enthusiasm
and training of U.S. Sailors compared to British recruits.&quot;There&apos;s vibrancy in the young recruits that we have in our country just
as there is here. They want to join and serve their country, and we can
see that in the recruits and students we have seen here at Great Lakes,&quot;Christie said.&quot;We can also see similarities in the spirit -- in the eyes -- of the
trainers, (instructors, facilitators and recruit division commanders)
because it&apos;s a real honor and a privilege to train people who want to
serve their country.&quot;Both commodores agreed that it was vital to see what would work or
wouldn&apos;t work from the training curriculum at TSC and RTC, such as
Battle Stations 21 the grueling 12-hour shipboard final assessment on
board RTC&apos;s Arleigh Burke-class destroyer simulator, USS Trayer (BST 21).&quot;Not everything is directly relatable, but we can both share the best
practices,&quot;said Christie, who was also afforded an opportunity to be
the reviewing officer (RO) at an RTC graduation for more than 925 new
U.S. Sailors.&quot;I was the [reviewing officer] for United Kingdom&apos;s Navy boot camp about
three weeks ago. I was the RO for the United Kingdom&apos;s Royal Marine
Commandos last Friday, and therefore, it is a fantastic privilege to be
here and be RO at the U.S. Navy boot camp.&quot;The commanding officer of RTC, Capt. John W. Peterson, called the visit
by the U.K. commodores and their staffs a huge benefit.&quot;The key benefit you get is the opportunity to exchange ideas and
perspectives on how we both do entry-level training, recruiting and
advance-level training,&quot;Peterson said.

During his speech to the graduating recruits, Christie saluted them for
volunteering to serve their country.&quot;There are future chiefs, officers and maybe even one or two admirals
here today, and you will set great goals for your future careers.
Someday maybe you&apos;ll have the opportunity to work with allied navies,
like Her Majesty&apos;s Royal Navy,&quot;Christie said.&quot;So from the oldest navy to the biggest, &apos;congratulations.&apos;&quot;For more news from Naval Service Training Command, visit

NNS081016-10. San Antonio Deck Department Puts New Assets To Work on
Deployment

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class (SW) Brian Goodwin, Iwo Jima
Expeditionary Strike Group Public Affairs

USS SAN ANTONIO, At Sea (NNS) -- While deployed in support of maritime
security operations (MSO), the amphibious transport dock ship USS San
Antonio&apos;s (LPD 17) Deck Department uses new technology and assets that
impacts daily shipboard operations.

One of these features is San Antonio&apos;s complement of three -- rather
than two -- ridged-hull inflatable boats (RHIB) at their disposal.&quot;Having three small boats makes amphibious assault vehicle (AAV)
operations and visit, board, search and seizure (VBSS) operations that
much easier to accomplish our missions,&quot;explained Cmdr. Kurt Kastner,
San Antonio&apos;s commanding officer.

Maritime security operations in the 5th area of responsibility places a
demand on small boat operations.&quot;MSO has been pushing the Navy to come up with faster and more efficient
ways of deploying our RHIBs for AAV operations and VBSS teams,&quot;said
Senior Chief Boatswain&apos;s Mate (SW/AW) Yvonne Dunn.&quot;Having more boats at
our disposal for these missions makes San Antonio more versatile than
older LPDs that only have two RHIBs.&quot;Deploying RHIBs in the water has become more efficient due to the
articulating knuckle boom crane.&quot;The articulating knuckle boom crane is the first of its kind aboard an
LPD class,&quot;said Boatswain&apos;s Mate 1st Class (SW) Mark Brandt.&quot;It runs
with hydraulics, has a reach of 69 feet, rotates 270 degrees and can
lift 22,000 pounds.&quot;&quot;This crane is more valuable than older gravity davits because the only
way to raise or lower the boats then was to manually pull or lower them
into the water,&quot;added Dunn.

The articulating knuckle boom crane&apos;s use is not limited to just raising
and lowering RHIBs.&quot;We&apos;re capable of using our crane for loading and unloading supplies
from the pier when moored and raising or lowering the brow on the
portside for transiting on and off the ship,&quot;said Dunn.

According to the ship&apos;s leadership, modern technology is no substitute
for San Antonio&apos;s Deck Department&apos;s greatest asset, its Sailors.
Comprised of a collection of boatswain&apos;s mates and deck seamen, deck
department Sailors tend to a variety of shipboard operations and watches.&quot;We stand bridge watches, steer the ship and stand lookout to find
approaching vessels,&quot;said Chief Warrant Officer Shawn Stacey, San
Antonio&apos;s Bos&apos;n.&quot;Once these vessels are spotted and identified, deck
department mans the crane and boat davits to deploy our RHIBs.&quot;Training is the key to keep deck department Sailors&apos; skills sharp.&quot;We spend countless hours training on anything from basic seamanship, to
running cranes, davits, boats, fueling and cargo stations,&quot;said Brandt.&quot;We expect a lot out of our personnel, but they can see why we train as
hard as we do, because of how dangerous an environment it can be in deck
department.&quot;&quot;We are able to complete every mission and task that is thrown our way,&quot;added Boatswain&apos;s Mate 2nd Class (SW/AW) Charles Stillinger.&quot;With the
superb leadership and guidance from our upper chain of command, as well
as the drive and determination from our junior sailors, we can succeed
in any given situation with utmost pride and professionalism.&quot;San Antonio is deployed to the U.S. 5th Fleet area of operations as part
of the Iwo Jima Expeditionary Strike Group to conduct MSO. MSO help
develop security in the maritime environment. From security arises
stability that results in global economic prosperity. MSO complements
the counterterrorism and security efforts of regional nations and seek
to disrupt violent extremists&apos; use of the maritime environment as a
venue for attack or to transport personnel, weapons or other material.

NNS081016-19. Makin Island Pre-Commissioning Crew Completes Critical
Safety Training

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Justin Webb,
Pre-Commissioning Unit Makin Island Public Affairs

PASCAGOULA, Miss. (NNS) -- Pre-Commissioning Unit (PCU) Makin Island&apos;s
(LHD 8) Safety Department concluded two days of mandatory safety
training Oct. 2, which boosted the readiness of the shipboard safety
program and the safety petty officers who implement it.

Instructors from Safety Programs Afloat (San Diego) provided training to
Pascagoula-based Sailors to ensure Makin Island&apos;s divisional safety
petty officers have the required safety technician 9571 Navy Enlisted
Classification (NEC) for those positions. The training also provided
supervisory personnel with the basic knowledge and skills required to
perform their duties and responsibilities in accordance with Operational
Naval Instruction (OPNAVINST) 5100.19.&quot;This is an extremely informative class for safety supervisors,&quot;said
course instructor Chief Electrician&apos;s Mate (SW) Elmer Deinla.&quot;The
course is a mandatory training for assigned divisional safety petty
officers. Fifty percent of the total divisional safety petty officers
must have attended this two-day formal classroom training.&quot;Makin Island&apos;s Safety Department strives to not only reach Safety
Programs Afloat&apos;s requirements for qualifications but to exceed them.&quot;Makin Island&apos;s goal is for 100 percent of both primary and alternate
divisional safety petty officers to attend this course,&quot;said Safety
Department Representative, Electrician&apos;s Mate 1st Class (SW) Patrick David.&quot;Since this is a rare function to have these two safety instructors, EMC
Deinla and Mr. Rick Lewis, fly to a somewhat non-military location to
teach this course, we encouraged all E-5 and above at the PCU to take
advantage of this opportunity. Thanks to Makin Island Sailors utilizing
this rare opportunity, we&apos;re actually attaining more than 100 percent of
our command requirement.&quot;The course also focused on the facilitation, implementation and
maintenance of an effective divisional safety program. The course
identified how safety petty officers support the command safety officer
in the mission of maintaining an effective shipboard safety program.&quot;When I was first enrolled in this class, I thought it was nothing more
than another training that needed to be completed,&quot;said Yeoman 3rd
Class Thomas Jones.&quot;After a matter of minutes I realized the severity
of the training. All the causes of mishaps and injuries are infinite,
but knowing how to prevent them from occurring or reoccurring is a great
feeling.&quot;Sailors who complete the training and meet the other requirements to
receive the safety technician NEC not only help ensure Makin Island will
be one of the safest ships in the fleet, they are also giving themselves
more options for future military assignments and civilian employment.&quot;With this NEC, challenging and rewarding billets working for Navy
Occupation and Safety and Health (NAVOSH) and the Navy Safety Center
become great options for Sailors who are rotating out of sea duty,&quot;added David.&quot;Also, employment opportunities for Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA) and NAVOSH may be available after their
Navy careers.&quot;Sailors, in their nine to 12-month negotiating window for orders, who
would like to be considered for the pre-commissioning command, can
contact their rating detailer and request to be released to the
pre-commissioning detailer for assignment to Makin Island.

NNS081016-09. Beach Clean-Up Helps Environment, Strengthens Partnerships

By Oyaol Ngirairikl, U.S. Naval Forces Marianas Public Affairs

SANTA RITA, Guam (NNS) -- Armed with plastic bags, protective gloves and
a determination to keep Guam&apos;s beaches clean, Sailors from Maritime
Expeditionary Security Squadron (MSRON) 7 picked up cigarette butts,
cans and other trash Oct. 4.&quot;We&apos;re here to support the community and help make Guam a better,
cleaner place for everyone,&quot;said Master-at-Arms 3rd Class (EXW) Michael
Steffon.

MSRON 7 Sailors were among the thousands of volunteers participating in
the Government of Guam&apos;s Na&apos; La Bonita clean-up coordinated by Guam&apos;s
Department of Parks and Recreation and the Hagatna Restoration and
Redevelopment Authority. Na&apos; La Bonita efforts focused on the island&apos;s
capital of Hagatna. Complimenting that effort, the Guam Hotel and
Restaurant Association held, in partnership with the Japan Guam Travel
Association and Tourism Education Council, their bi-annual Keep Guam
Clean event.

According to Master-at-Arms 2nd Class (EXW) James Wisneski the few hours
he and fellow Sailors put into the clean-up has a wider impact on
Sailors and on relationships with Pacific nations.&quot;The Navy is big on leadership,&quot;Wisneski said.&quot;The Master Chief Petty
Officer of the Navy was here and he talked to Sailors about leading from
the deck plates. That responsibility extends beyond your specific duty
station  it&apos;s about improving yourself, the Navy and the community.&quot;Wisneski noted when Sailors take up the mantle of leadership by
volunteering at community projects, they&apos;re strengthening the bonds
between the Navy and the local and regional community, which supports
the nation&apos;s U.S. Maritime Strategy.&quot;The strategy calls for humanitarian effort and for working with
allies,&quot;he said.&quot;Projects like this helps open doors. Our allies and
even potential allies will see, hear or read about what we&apos;re doing on
Guam  how we&apos;re more than just a military presence but a true neighbor
that cares They&apos;ll be more inclined to work with us.&quot;Master-at-Arms 2nd Class (EXW/AW) Janice Benally noted that volunteering
at various community events is something the command encourages.&quot;It helps you become a more well-rounded person and a better Sailor,&quot;Benally said.&quot;Plus, it&apos;s just a really nice feeling when you get to
know people and impact their lives in a positive way.&quot;MSRON 7 has participated in not only community events but continues to
strengthen ties with its sister village of Sinajana and sister school of
C.L. Taitano Elementary School. As well as, set aside several hours a
week to help out at the USO located at Royal Orchid Hotel in Tumon.&quot;Volunteering is an opportunity to see what the world outside of your
normal routine is like. You get to see what other people are thinking,
doing and talking about,&quot;Benally said.&quot;You learn a lot about other
people and yourself when you volunteer.&quot;For more news from U.S. Naval Forces, Marianas, visit

NNS081016-23. Kearsarge Sailors Get in Touch with Their Roots in
Dominican Republic

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Jilleanne Buda, Continuing
Promise 2008 Public Affairs

SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (NNS) -- Service members from USS
Kearsarge (LHD 3) had the opportunity to visit with family and friends
during the humanitarian/civic assistance mission Continuing Promise (CP)
2008, Oct. 3-17 in the Dominican Republic.

Marine Pfc. Kelvin Espinal and Boatswain&apos;s Mate Seaman Albert Castillo
have spent the last few days serving the two countries they call home.&quot;This is my country,&quot;said Dominican-born Castillo.&quot;Helping them now makes this my best time in the Navy.&quot;Castillo, who joined the Navy in 2005, has a dual citizenship in both
countries. His father, Bazillio Castillo lives in the Dominican Republic
where he works for the local government.&quot;I&apos;m very happy to see my son serving,&quot;said Bazillio.&quot;It makes me very proud. I would like to see him continue in the service.&quot;In contrast, Espinal is a first generation American.&quot;It&apos;s exciting for me,&quot;said Espinal.&quot;It&apos;s really great to get back to
my roots and equally wonderful to do my part in helping the U.S. make
friends and allies here.&quot;Espinal&apos;s father lives in Miami, but traveled to the Dominican to see
his son.&quot;We need more people like my son,&quot;said Espinal.&quot;The service helps
people grow up, get educations and become professionals.&quot;Castillo and Espinal will spend a few days with their families before
returning to the Kearsarge to carry out the CP 2008 mission in Trinidad
and Tobago and Guyana.

CP is a collaborative effort between the United States and partner
militaries, non-governmental organizations and partner-nation support
organizations to build strong partnerships that can be called upon in
the event of a regional situation requiring cooperative solutions.

Kearsarge&apos;s mission is to conduct civil-military operations including
humanitarian and civic assistance, as well as veterinary, medical,
dental and civil engineering support to six partner nations and to send
a strong message of United States compassion, support and commitment to
Central and South America and the Caribbean.

Kearsarge is currently under the operational control of U.S. 4th Fleet.
U.S. 4th Fleet&apos;s mission is to direct United States naval forces
operating in the Caribbean and Central and South American region and
interact with partner nation navies to shape maritime environment.

Kearsarge&apos;s mission exemplifies the United States maritime strategy
which emphasizes deploying forces to build confidence and trust among
nations through collective maritime security efforts that focus on
common threats and mutual interests.

The CP Caribbean Phase is the second of two HCA deployments to the
Southern Command area of focus for 2008. The first CP deployment was
conducted by USS Boxer (LHD 4) in the Pacific.

NNS081016-21. Sailors Graduate from New Career Counselor Course Curriculum

By Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class (AW) Crystal M. Mullen, Fleet
Public Affairs Center, Pacific

SAN DIEGO (NNS) -- The first group of students graduated from the new
Career Counselor Course curriculum Oct. 3 at the Fleet Training Center,
Naval Base San Diego.

Sailors from various commands enrolled in the four-week course which
teaches the responsibilities of being a command career counselor (CCC).&quot;I learned how to be an effective counselor in this course,&quot;said Yeoman
2nd Class John N. Nguyen, Naval Auxiliary Landing Field (NALF) San
Clemente Island.&quot;I also learned about all the programs that I will need
to know as a career counselor.&quot;This was the first time the new curriculum was taught in San Diego.&quot;I thought the material was very informative and presented very well
even though this is the first time it has been used. I wasn&apos;t
disappointed with the materials provided,&quot;said Hospital Corpsman 1st
Class (FMF) Terrence A. Harris, 3rd Medical Battalion Okinawa.&quot;I really
enjoyed the personal counseling skills course. It was thorough and in
depth, and the role plays included in the course helped out with the
learning.&quot;&quot;We were taught how to resource and network as much as possible so that
the Sailor can benefit as much as possible,&quot;said Machinist&apos;s Mate 1st
Class (SS/SW) Leonard Anderson, USS Greenville (SSN 772).&quot;Don&apos;t ever be afraid to ask for help; this is all going to be very new
to you,&quot;said Master Chief Navy Counselor (SW/AW) Laura L. Paquian,
Naval Surface Forces career counselor, in a pre-graduation speech to the
class.&quot;One of the biggest things we have as counselors is the know-how
to network with each other.&quot;A part of being a Navy career counselor is being able to assist Sailors
on a daily basis with various issues they may have.&quot;Career counseling is the only job in the Navy that I know of where you
get instant gratification,&quot;said Paquian.&quot;A job where you walk away
from your day, every single day of the week and feel like you
accomplished something.&quot;Sailors who intend to convert to the Navy Counselor (NC) rating or are
working as CCCs are required to attend the career counselor course.&quot;Talk to somebody before you get into this field so you will know what
to expect,&quot;said Chief Navy Counselor (SW) Russel G. Scott, director,
Career Counselor Course San Diego.&quot;There are Sailors who want to get
into the career counselor field without any idea of what it is they&apos;re
going to be doing, and some of them are just not suited to be command
career counselors. So make sure you know what you&apos;re getting into before
you do it.&quot;Sailors who wish to convert to NC or receive the 9588 NEC should contact
their CCC or log into the Catalog of Navy Training Courses (CANTRAC),
Volume II.

NNS081016-14.&quot;Gold Eagle&quot;Sailors Take Ride for Motorcycle Safety

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Kristan Robertson, USS Carl
Vinson Public Affairs

HAMPTON, Va. (NNS) -- Several Sailors assigned to USS Carl Vinson
(CVN-70) participated in the Fall Inter-Service Motorcycle Safety Ride
Oct. 3, for a day of riding, camaraderie, and safety instruction at Fort
Monroe in Hampton, Va.

Approximately 350 military service members, government contractors and
civilians gathered at the event to enjoy purring engines and glistening
chrome, while brushing-up on defensive riding techniques that could
potentially save lives.&quot;Today, we have here a lot of seasoned riders and a lot of new riders,&quot;said Gen. Abraham Turner, deputy commander for operations, strategic
plans/policy and training at Fort Monroe.&quot;It&apos;s so important to mind
your &apos;Ps and Qs&apos; while riding, because a lot of things can and will
happen, so you must always be conscious of what&apos;s going on around you to
help save lives on the road.&quot;All riders met at the starting point next to the post bowling center,
after going through a safety check conducted by representatives of the
Motorcycle Safety Foundation. The long trail of military and civilian
bikers then departed for a 100-mile ride to Franklin, Va., with the
Hampton Police Department escorting them.&quot;We chose to ride to Franklin because it is a warm community, and the
people here understand the sacrifice of what you all do for the country
every day,&quot;said Turner.&quot;We&apos;re riding together today as a group, and I
am taking every opportunity I get to show off our Soldiers, Sailors,
Airmen and Marines.&quot;The event&apos;s safety topics included proper protective equipment and
acceptable clothing for riding, motorcycle rules and regulations and
requirements for military personnel.

After a motorcycle training exercise and lunch in Franklin, the group
departed for Fort Monroe, where hundreds of dollars in raffle prizes and
Harley Davidson products were given to the service members. Awards for
the best motorcycles in sport, cruiser and touring categories were also
presented.&quot;I encourage all Carl Vinson Sailors to ride together, stay safe and get
involved in [motorcycle] clubs or rides like the one today,&quot;said Chief
Aviation Ordnanceman Royce Cormier.&quot;These events are about getting
together with other riders and enjoying the sport responsibly. The biker
community is like a family, and we help one another out while keeping
each other safe.&quot;For more news from USS Carl Vinson, visit www.navy.mil/local/cvn70/.

NNS081016-13. Yokosuka Hosts Clear Vision 5K, Promotes Fitness, Right Spirit

By Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Kari R. Bergman, Fleet Public
Affairs Center, Japan

YOKOSUKA, Japan (NNS) -- Approximately 400 runners from commands aboard
Commander, Fleet Activities Yokosuka participated in the Clear Vision 5K
on Oct. 10, which helped promote physical fitness and the right spirit
among Sailors and participants.

The Clear Vision campaign&apos;s mission is to deglamorize alcohol and
educate Sailors and civilians stationed in Yokosuka about alternatives
to drinking. The campaign, a follow on to last year&apos;s successful None
for the Road campaign, started in early February and will run through
Thanksgiving.&quot;I think that this run promotes good health and fitness and also reminds
the younger Sailors of their responsibilities and also to be safe if
they do decide to drink,&quot;said Construction Mechanic 1st Class Malcom
Marcewicz, a participant in the 5K.

The Clear Vision committee, made up of Yokosuka Sailors and civilian
volunteers, plans to post flyers around base, pass out pamphlets to
every command and have booths set up during basewide events to inform
Sailors and civilians about non-alcoholic alternatives.&quot;We have been doing different events all year, and this run was just
another way for us to get the word out and make people aware that there
are other alternatives,&quot;said Personnel Specialist 1st Class George
Smythe, chairman for the Clear Vision campaign.&quot;We want to get Sailors
away from thinking that you have to drink alcohol in order to have a
good time.&quot;Clear Vision is another tool where Sailors help Sailors and the local
Navy community put its best foot forward.&quot;In Japan, we have to be very conscious of our environment because of
course we are ambassadors here and we represent the Navy and our
country,&quot;Smythe said.&quot;We want to be on our best behavior at all times,
so Clear Vision is one aspect of us promoting that awareness here in
Yokosuka.&quot;For more news from Commander Fleet Activities Yokosuka, visit

NNS081016-20. 2008 All-Military Wilderness Challenge Tests Service Teams

By Mark O. Piggott, Naval Weapons Station Yorktown Public Affairs

NEW RIVER, West Va. (NNS) -- U.S. Coast Guard team&quot;Duckie Fuzz and the
Masters of Rubber&quot;from Boston, Mass., won the Mid-Atlantic Region,
Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) Department&apos;s 8th annual
all-military Wilderness Challenge, Oct. 3-4.

More than 55 military teams of active duty, retirees and ROTC units
competed in six grueling events in the heart of the Appalachian
Mountains and on the New and the Gauley Rivers in West Virginia.&quot;We are extremely excited about the popularity of the challenge and glad
this event brings out teams that are excited to earn bragging rights for
the title,&quot;said Mike Bond, event coordinator.&quot;It is not an easy
competition, and only the strong survive.&quot;The challenge contains a series of six outdoor adventure races in a team
format designed to bring camaraderie, competition and team spirit
between all five branches of the armed services.

Teams participating in the challenge compete in an 8K mountain run, a
14-mile mountain bike race, a 14-mile forced hike through the mountains,
a 13-mile whitewater raft race on the Gauley River, a half-mile swim in
the swift moving waters of the Gauley River and a 7-mile kayak race on
the New River.&quot;The Wilderness Challenge gives us an opportunity to bring all five
services together for a &apos;joint operation,&apos;&quot;said Capt. Bette Bolivar,
commanding officer, Naval Weapons Station Yorktown and team leader for&quot;Team Yorktown.&quot;&quot;Even though we&apos;re out here, amongst friends, there is
still an edge of competitiveness.&quot;For some teams, working together in these physical events was second
nature to them. Marine Maj. Jason Gaddy of Team&quot;Combat Train&quot;from Camp
Lejeune, N.C., says Marines rely on this type of teamwork whenever they
deploy.&quot;This works right in the Marine Corps hands,&quot;Gaddy said.&quot;We form in
fire teams of four, that&apos;s how we fight, that&apos;s how we train, so this
works right up our alley.&quot;For others, the Wilderness Challenge was a last chance at being with
friends and teammates. Marine Cpl. Aaron Foster from Naval Medical
Center Portsmouth (NMCP) is a&quot;wounded warrior,&quot;wounded in combat in
Iraq. He is one of two Wounded Warriors on the NMCP team. Foster is
competing in a physical event like the Wilderness Challenge for the
first time since he was wounded.&quot;We&apos;ve got a good team, and we&apos;re out here to bring more attention to
the &apos;wounded warriors&apos; issue,&quot;Foster said.&quot;There&apos;s a lot of us
(wounded warriors) who are not as physically able as me and &apos;Doc&apos; to
compete in an event like this, and we just want to put some more
emphasis on them.&quot;The Wilderness Challenge is hosted by Class VI-Mountain River Whitewater
Rafting. For co-owner Dave Arnold, it is as exciting to watch for him as
it is for the service members to compete.&quot;This is a great event for these teams who come here to challenge
themselves and score a win for their teams and their branches of
service,&quot;Arnold said.&quot;The camaraderie, team spirit and energy of this
weekend are exciting to watch.&quot;For more news from Naval Weapons Station Yorktown, visit

NNS081016-12. USS Gonzalez Gives Families, Friends Look at Life Underway

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class(SW) Cory Rose, Fleet Public
Affairs Center Atlantic

USS GONZALEZ, At Sea (NNS) -- The guided-missile destroyer USS Gonzalez
(DDG 66) hosted a Tiger cruise for 37 family members and friends
Gonzalez left Naval Station Norfolk Oct. 1.

Tiger cruises give family and friends of Sailors aboard Navy ships an
understanding of what ship life is like for officers and enlisted
Sailors during an underway period.&quot;I think that it is great to get the chance to see how our son lives and
what he does on a day-to-day basis,&quot;said Barbara Alvey, mother of
Information Technician 2nd Class(SW) Elan Alvey.

The crew held demonstrations for the tigers, including a damage control
drill and 50 caliber machine gun shoot.&quot;I was extremely impressed with the demonstrations that were put on for
us,&quot;said April Hess, mother of Electronic Warfare Officer Ensign Monika
Hess.

Spending time on a Navy ship and learning how things work during an
underway period helps those not in the military understand what the Navy
is all about.&quot;The Navy is not just about the ships, but it is about the crew aboard
those ships and their commitment to their country and the mission at
hand,&quot;said Robert Robinette, college roommate of Gonzalez&apos; Commanding
Officer Cmdr. Brian Fort.

The cruise ended Oct. 3 in Moorehead City, N.C., the site of the 22nd
annual Seafood Festival, and Sailors aboard Gonzalez were the guests of
honor.

NNS081016-08. Navy Athletes Display Core Values at Ironman World
Championship

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Paul D. Honnick, Fleet Public
Affairs Detachment Hawaii

KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii (NNS) -- Athletes from the Navy athletic team and
Naval Special Warfare completed the 30th Ford Ironman World Championship
triathlon held annually in Kailua-Kona on the&quot;Big&quot;Island of Hawaii
Oct. 11.

The athletes say they drew upon the strength, determination and
commitment they have learned while serving the nation to compete among
the world&apos;s most elite athletes. The triathlon included swimming 2.4
miles through rough ocean currents, biking 112 miles and running a 26.2
miles over challenging volcanic rock-covered terrain.&quot;Six Navy athletes took serving their country one step further by
pushing themselves to their physical limits in a world-class test of
human endurance,&quot;said Capt. Duncan Smith of Naval Special Warfare
Command.&quot;Navy is proud to celebrate our 30th year of participation in
Ironman. Athletes of this caliber and the Ironman organization at large
share many of the core values we hold dear in the Navy: pursuit of
excellence, personal fitness and unwavering commitment.&quot;Representing the Navy in the triathlon were Cmdr. Kristin Barnes,
officer in charge of Afloat Planning System, Pacific and a native of
Vermillion, Ohio; Cmdr. Keith Davids, a native of Miami and commanding
officer of SEAL Team 1; Lt. Cmdr. Damon Dixon, a native of San Francisco
and executive officer of the Naval Oceanography Special Warfare Center;
Lt. Cmdr. John Marinovich, a native of Davis, Calif., and combat systems
officer for littoral combat ship USS Independence (LCS 2); Lt. Jeff
Tomazewski, a native of Pittsburgh and aviation maintenance duty officer
assigned to the Naval Post Graduate School; and Special Warfare Operator
1st Class (SEAL) David Goggins, assigned to Naval Special Warfare Center.

For the Navy athletes, it wasn&apos;t about finishing first or last but
finishing with pride and distinction.&quot;I&apos;m here to represent the Navy, and I&apos;m here to have fun,&quot;said Barnes.&quot;I think what you need to do is evaluate what your definition of winning
is - is my definition of winning coming across the finish line first or
is my definition of winning being able to represent the Navy in a manner
that displays the core values?&quot;As if 140 miles wasn&apos;t enough of a challenge, Goggins and Davids arrived
at the starting line by parachuting to Kailua Bay from a C-130 aircraft.&quot;It&apos;s already a long day; why not add another event,&quot;said Davids.&quot;I&apos;m
sure it&apos;s not ideal, but it also adds another dimension and another
level of excitement to the race.&quot;At 7:00 a.m., the athletes entered the water and the race began.

Each athlete found different ways of keeping themselves motivated during
the race.&quot;Later in the race, your body starts breaking down, and physically and
mentally your body wants to shut down, but you&apos;ve got to find ways to
kind of push through and just keep moving forward,&quot;said Tomazewski.

Marinovich was the first Navy athlete to cross the finish line with a
swim time of 55:17, a bike time of 5:27:52, a run time of 3:37:06 and an
overall time of 10:10:31.

Tomazewski followed closely behind Marinovich with a swim time of
1:20:04, a bike time of 5:24:55, a run time of 3:29:09 and an overall
time of 10:23:13.

In a show of patriotism, waving the American flag as he crossed the
finish line, was Dixon with a swim time of 58:33, a bike time of
5:22:42, a run time of 4:00:13 and an overall time of 10:27:32.

The crowd erupted and the sound of &apos;Anchors Aweigh&apos; filled the air as
Navy SEALs Goggins and Davids crossed the finish line together and
embraced one another with an overall time of 10:24:00. Goggins finished
with a swim time of 1:18:32, a bike time of 6:04:55, a run time of
3:45:41 and Davids with a swim time of 1:04:40, a bike time of 5:45:18
and a run time of 4:23:23 respectively.

Barnes crossed the finish line with a swim time of 1:18:50, a bike time
of 6:01:23, a run time of 4:18:21 and an overall time of 11:47:01.&quot;It&apos;s pretty hard to smile right now; I&apos;m done,&quot;said Barnes as she
walked off displaying the Hawaiian hand gesture for&quot;hang loose.&quot;&quot;It&apos;s an honor,&quot;said Davids.&quot;The energy on the island and to have the
opportunity to race with these world-class athletes and certainly
represent the world&apos;s greatest Navy is tremendous.&quot;&quot;I owe it to all the folks who have ever done anything for me; the guys
that have worked overtime to fix my airplanes, the guys in admin that
have worked overtime to make sure that my pay is correct, my skippers
that have worked overtime to make sure that I have the guidance and the
leadership training that I need,&quot;said Barnes.

NNS081016-25. USS Indianapolis Survivor Returns to Pearl Harbor After
More than 60 Years

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Michael A. Lantron,
Commander, Navy Region Hawaii Public Affairs

PEARL HARBOR (NNS) -- A survivor of the attack of the Portland-class
cruiser USS Indianapolis (CA-35), returned to Pearl Harbor Sept. 26 for
the first time since 1945 when the ship was en route to San Diego after
the attack.

During his visit, former Seaman 1st Class George E. Laws toured the USS
Utah Memorial and the USS Arizona Memorial while talking about his
memories about the fateful evening onboard Indianapolis July 30, 1945.

Laws, who currently resides in Traverse City, Mich., was only 19 at the
time and described his ordeal as if it happened yesterday.&quot;I just relieved the helmsman in aft steering and opened a book when the
first torpedo hit. The can I was sitting on and I jumped up and right
back down from the vibration,&quot;said Laws.&quot;I was about to call to see
what happened when the second torpedo hit. A yeoman I was with went to
find out what happened, but once he left, I never saw him again.&quot;Determined to find out the reason of the massive jolt, Laws moved up the
ladder wells looking for an answer.&quot;I went past the crew quarters and the mess decks to a hatch near the
machine shop, turned the corner and saw fire and smoke and knew I had to
get out of there,&quot;said Laws.&quot;I hollered down to the others in aft
steering and told them &apos;get out of there, the ship&apos;s sinking!&apos; The ship
was listing, and an officer told us to abandon ship and stay away from
the screw guard and the screw because it&apos;s still turning.&quot;After abandoning ship, the young Sailor from Springfield, Ill., watched
as the ship sank in just 12 minutes.&quot;I can&apos;t remember how much oil I swallowed once I hit the water, but I
was sicker than the dickens. I watched as the ship kept going away from
me and listed further until it lay on its side, turned up bow first,&quot;said Laws.&quot;Watching the ship go down felt like it was in slow motion,
and I said to myself, &apos;Oh my God, there goes my home.&quot;As Laws and his fellow shipmates treaded the water of the Philippine
Sea, they also worried about lurked below.&quot;We had no trouble [until] the morning when schools of sharks came.
People said to splash the water and make a lot of noise and they&apos;ll go
away, but they didn&apos;t. If a guy swam away, it was the last you saw of
him,&quot;said Laws.&quot;People kept saying don&apos;t drink the water, so I never
did. I was only given a piece of Spam three quarters of an inch thick.
All I tasted was salt, so I spit it right out.&quot;Laws survived on the high seas for five days and was finally rescued and
brought aboard the Crosley-class high-speed transport USS Bassett
(APD-73). He was very dehydrated and hungry and soon lost consciousness.&quot;I probably survived because I was covered in oil head to toe, and the
sharks just could not smell me. When they picked me up, I passed out,&quot;said Laws.&quot;Once I woke up, I had clean clothes on and not a drop of oil
on me. They brought me and 157 others to Leyte Gulf, and eventually I
made it back to the mainland.&quot;Laws&apos; daughter, Carolyn Rodden visited Pearl Harbor with her father.&quot;Being the daughter of a USS Indianapolis survivor has, and always will
be, an honor. When I go to the reunions and listen to the remaining
survivors speak about their experience, it is incredible to know how
much my father went through just to stay alive,&quot;said Rodden.&quot;I can
only imagine how terrifying the experience was for him and all of the
rest of the survivors. I am very proud of him. He is a true &apos;survivor.&apos;&quot;As he visited the Pearl Harbor attractions with his daughter, Laws was
reminded of those who lost their lives aboard Arizona, Utah and
Indianapolis.&quot;It was an amazing experience to be here,&quot;said Laws.&quot;I am so sorry for
all those who lost their lives in these attacks.&quot;&quot;The experience of seeing Pearl with my father was incredible,&quot;added
Rodden.&quot;Since it was the first time he had been back in over 60 years,
I believe it brought back the memories of all that happened even more
clearly than he remembered before we arrived. For me, it was like seeing
it through his eyes for the first time.&quot;Indianapolis was attacked following the successful mission to Tinian
Island, carrying parts and the uranium projectile for the atomic bomb&quot;Little Boy&quot;which would later be dropped on Hiroshima. The ship arrived
in Tinian July 26, 1945.

After delivering her top secret cargo to Tinian, the Indianapolis was
sent to Guam where a number of the crew who had completed their tours of
duty were replaced by other Sailors.

Leaving Guam July 28, 1945, she began sailing toward Leyte when she was
attacked by the Japanese submarine I-58, which was undetected due to the
lack of effective submarine imaging equipment on Indianapolis.

Laws is one of only 317 survivors of the July 30, 1945 Japanese attack
on Indianapolis.

To this day, the attack is known as the worst single loss of life at sea
in the history of the U.S. Navy. Approximately 300 of the 1,196-man crew
died in the attack. Of the 880 who were left at the mercy of the sea,
563 Sailors perished from a combination of exposure, dehydration, and
shark attacks.

NNS081016-24. Successful Mini-Camp at Little Creek Signals a Brighter
Future for All-Navy Boxing

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (AW) Kristopher Wilson, Fleet
Public Affairs Center Atlantic

VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (NNS) -- Aspiring Navy pugilists converged at
Rockwell Hall Gym on Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek for their chance
to qualify for the All-Navy Boxing Team Oct. 11-12.

The mini-camp and tryouts offered amateur fighters the opportunity to
show their mettle in the ring to All-Navy team members and coaches. Up
for grabs were a limited number of invitations to attend the All-Navy
Boxing Training Camp at Naval Base Ventura County in Port Hueneme,
Calif., Dec. 1-Feb. 1, for the chance to compete for a spot on the 2009
All-Navy team.

According to All-Navy Boxing coach and Naval Base Ventura County MWR
Athletic Director Kevin Ludwig, the camp far exceeded anyone&apos;s
expectations as 52 interested Sailors answered the bell, ready to don
gloves and hit the mat.&quot;We held this mini-camp here last year and we didn&apos;t have half as many
people come to try out,&quot;said Ludwig.&quot;This is more than we could have
ever hoped for.&quot;After watching more than six hours worth of three-minute sparring
rounds, Ludwig and his staff of volunteer coaches cut the field of
hopefuls in half, inviting 27 back for the next day&apos;s session and final
cuts.

For most participants, the camp was a chance to see how they stood
against other Navy fighters as well as an opportunity to earn valuable
USA Boxing-sanctioned training time. For others, it was the shot at a
dream - the first step toward making the All-Navy team.

Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Ronald Dallatorre, assigned to
the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72), traveled nearly 3,000
miles from Everett, Wash., for his shot.&quot;I missed the first camp in San Diego because we were still on
deployment at the time,&quot;said Dallatorre.&quot;Fortunately, my chain of command has been really supportive of me, and
they worked hard to get me down here for this one.&quot;Dallatorre, a three-year amateur boxing veteran, fought jet lag, mental
fatigue and fierce competition in the ring, but he made the most of his
opportunity. He was one of only 18 Sailors to earn an invitation to the
All-Navy Boxing Training Camp in December.

Once there, he will compete with other selectees from the Virginia Beach
and San Diego camps for a chance to earn one of eight potential spots on
the All-Navy team. Those who make the team will then compete in the
Armed Forces Championships at Fort Huachuca, Ariz., Feb. 2-9.

Despite his success at the mini-camp, Dallatorre knows that he still
faces a formidable uphill battle.&quot;I&apos;m in pretty good shape right now,&quot;said Dallatorre,&quot;but I know that
if I want to make the team at camp, I&apos;m going to have to work a lot
harder between now and then.&quot;Dallatorre said that in order to get to where he needs to be, he hopes
to drop 20 pounds and put five more fights under his belt by the time
camp rolls around.

For Electrician&apos;s Mate 2nd Class Jessie Owens, a USS Dwight D.
Eisenhower (CVN 69) Sailor and one of the few female All-Navy Team
veterans, the camp was simply the next step toward a much bigger dream.&quot;I&apos;ve been boxing for four years now, and this will be my second year on
the All-Navy team,&quot;said Owens.&quot;Of course I want to win Armed Forces
(Championships), but my biggest goal is to make the Olympic team.&quot;The 2012 Summer Olympics, which will be held in London, England, could
become the first Olympic Games to feature women&apos;s boxing as a recognized
event, although inclusion in the Games has yet to be finalized by the
International Olympic Committee.

Owens, who will turn 30 next year, is only allowed to box as an amateur
until the age of 34, which puts her right at the far edge of the age
window to chase down her Olympic dream.&quot;Making the first ever women&apos;s Olympic boxing team would definitely be a
great way to go out,&quot;admitted Owens.

Ludwig acknowledged that while he&apos;s glad to see fighters come up with
Olympic dreams, he&apos;s even happier to see the resurgence of interest in
Navy boxing.&quot;Navy boxing has been struggling for a while,&quot;Ludwig said,&quot;and that&apos;s
why we&apos;re here, to get the word out.&quot;Ludwig claimed that despite nearly a decade of disappointments at the
Armed Forces Championships (one medal last year) and a severely limited
All-Navy Sports budget, the boxing program has turned a corner. Ludwig
cited the increased participation at the mini-camps as telltale signs of
Navy Boxing&apos;s Rocky-esque comeback.&quot;Boxing and the Navy go hand in hand; they always have,&quot;Ludwig said.&quot;Even though we&apos;ve kind of gotten away from that tradition over the
years, I think we&apos;re on our way back. This camp proves that.&quot;For more news from Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek visit

NNS081016-15. Country Music Singer Visits Norfolk NEX, Honors Sailors

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class (SW) David Wyscaver, Fleet
Public Affairs Center Atlantic

NORFOLK (NNS) -- A popular country music singer visited the Naval
Exchange (NEX) on Naval Station Norfolk Oct. 13 where he signed
autographs for service members and their families.&quot;I think it is really important to take the time out to show how much we
truly appreciate our service members and all the sacrifices they make on
a daily basis for our great country,&quot;said country singer John Michael
Montgomery.

Throughout the afternoon, Montgomery showed his appreciation to military
members by chatting, posing for photos and signing autographs.&quot;It was very exciting to see one of the greatest country singers of all
time,&quot;said Julie McCormick, military spouse.&quot;I&apos;ve been a fan of his
for years, and to be able to finally meet him was great.&quot;The country artist expressed what the military means to him and how he
enjoys giving back to those who serve.&quot;I&apos;ve had family members who&apos;ve served in the military, and I grew up
holding them in a very high regard,&quot;said Montgomery.&quot;My &apos;Letters From
Home&apos; song really helped me to connect with service members, and I got
the chance to visit a lot of places and perform for them around the world.

Montgomery&apos;s 16-year musical career includes 13 albums totaling more
than 10 million sold; 15 No. 1 singles with hits including,&quot;I Swear,&quot;&quot;I Love The Way You Love Me,&quot;and&quot;Life&apos;s a Dance;&quot;and numerous
industry and fan-voted awards.

VA PRESUMPTIVE POW DISEASES UPDATE 01: The Department of Veterans
Affairs presumes that specific disabilities diagnosed in certain
veterans were caused by their military service. If one of these
conditions is diagnosed in a former POW, VA presumes that the
circumstances of his/her service caused the condition, and disability
compensation can be awarded. This includes DIC education and CHAMPVA for
spouses of veterans rated 100% or surviving spouses late-veterans that
died from discussed medical problems. Disabilities may be presumed under
the circumstances described and for the conditions listed as follows:

(1) Imprisoned for any length of time, and disability at least 10
percent disabling:
 psychosis
 any of the anxiety states
 dysthymic disorder
 organic residuals of frostbite
 post-traumatic osteoarthritis
 heart disease or hypertensive vascular disease and their complications
 stroke and its residuals

(2) Imprisoned for at least 30 days, and disability at least 10 percent
disabling:
 avitaminosis
 beriberi
 chronic dysentery
 helminthiasis
 malnutrition (including optic atrophy)
 pellagra
 any other nutritional deficiency
 irritable bowel syndrome
 peptic ulcer disease
 peripheral neuropathy
 cirrhosis of the liver

VETERAN LEGISLATION 2008: After months of delay, the Senate passed an
omnibus veterans benefits bill on 16 SEP that includes bigger benefits
for veterans and their families, expanded home loans and a variety of
other programs. The bill, S.3023, had passed the Senate Veterans
Affairs Committee in June but lingered in limbo because of disputes over
dozens of details. With congressional leaders aiming to end this
legislative session of Congress soon, passage of the Senate bill was
essential for any hope of passing a compromise bill in conjunction with
the House this year. The Senate passed the bill by voice vote and with
no debate. Sens. Daniel Akaka (D-HI), chairman of the veterans
committee, and Richard Burr of North Carolina, the committees ranking
Republican, said the bill passed by the Senate includes a host of
compromises and includes the following provisions:

- It would order VA to simplify what it tells veterans when it denies
benefits claims or asks for more information.Notification letters to
veterans about the status of their claims have become increasingly long,
complex and difficult to understand, Akaka said. These notification
letters must be simplified. They should use plain and ordinary language
rather than bureaucratic jargon. Veterans should not be subjected to
confusing information as they seek benefits.
- It would temporarily extend an increase in veterans home loans
through the end of 2011. The temporary measure allows loans of up to
$730,000, but it is due to expire at the end of 2008. Akaka said
extending the loan limits for several more years would enable more
veterans to utilize their VA benefit to purchase more costly homes.
- It would apply the maximum loan limit to home refinancing, and let
homeowners refinance with a veterans loan if they have 5% equity in
their homes instead of the current 10% requirement.
- It would require more federal help for service members who have
problems with employment and re-employment rights. Under the bill, the
Labor Department would investigate more complaints and federal agencies
would provide more assistance. The bill calls for mandatory training for
federal human resources workers in the Uniformed Services Employment and
Reemployment Rights Act. Burr said every employer should obey the law,
but the federal government has a particular responsibility to be a model
employer. The federal government should make sure that not a single
returning service member is denied proper reinstatement to a federal
job, Burr said. Unfortunately, this is not happening yet.
- It would grant spouses of severely injured disabled veterans up to 20
years after the veterans are discharged to use education benefits, twice
the time currently allowed.
- It would prevent the Department of Veterans Affairs from making
changes in its disability rating schedule without first notifying
Congress. Burr said the current ratings system is riddled with outdated
criteria that do not track with modern medicine, especially in the
areas of combat stress and traumatic brain injuries. VA has been working
on several studies that could lead to an overhaul, but many veterans and
lawmakers remain concerned that a change could result in lower benefits.
Burr said the bill would make sure these studies do not get put on a
shelf to collect dust by requiring a report to Congress on the findings
and what action is planned by VA.

TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY UPDATE 04: The Dept. of Veterans Affairs
announced changes to its schedule for rating disabilities for Traumatic
Brain Injury (TBI), the&quot;signature wound&quot;of Iraq and Afghanistan.A VA
press release noted,&quot;Traumatic brain injuries result in immediate
effects such as loss or alteration of consciousness, amnesia and
sometimes neurological impairments.&quot;In some cases&quot;prolonged or even
permanent problems with a wide range of impairment in such areas as
physical, mental and emotional/behavioral functioning may occur.&quot;People
with TBI may experience headache, sleep difficulties, decreased memory
and attention, slower thinking, irritability, and depression. 22,000
veterans presently are being compensated for TBI, including 5,800 Iraq
and Afghanistan veterans. Those already receiving compensation for TBI
injuries can be reevaluated under the new rating schedule criteria. The
VA stressed, however, that veterans with the&quot;most severe&quot;forms of TBI
would not receive much, if any, extra compensation because the current
rating schedule provides adequate compensation in such cases. The rating
schedule change mainly has the potential to affect those with mild or
relatively moderate TBI who may have been assigned low or modest ratings
in the past. Under the new rules, TBI ratings will be based on the
degree of&quot;cognitive impairment&quot;and other&quot;residuals&quot;of TBI. These may
include mild to severe loss of memory, attention, concentration,
judgment, motor activity, visual spatial orientation, ability to
communicate and other functions. The rating schedule goes into effect in
late October. Because of the complexity of each individual evaluation,
it&apos;s not possible to assert that a particular person or particular
condition would receive a particular rating increase. [Source: MOAA Leg

COLA 2009 UPDATE 04: The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) of the U.S.
Department of Labor reported 16 SEP that the Consumer Price Index for
All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) decreased 0.4% in August, before seasonal
adjustment. The August level of 219.086 (1982-84=100) was 5.4% higher
than in August 2007. The Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and
Clerical Workers(CPI-W) decreased 0.5 percent in August, prior to
seasonal adjustment. The August level of 215.247 (1982-84=100) was
5.9%higher than in August 2007. Using seasonally adjusted data the BLS
found that energy prices were down 3.2% from July and food prices were
up 0.6%. Energy prices continue to have the most effect on the CPI. If
the September CPI-W remains unchanged from the August CPI-W, the
December COLA would be 5.9%. This would be the highest COLA since the
early 1980s. SEP 08 CPI data are scheduled to be released on 16 OCT at
0830 EST and can be viewed at www.bls.gov/cpi. [Source: MOAA News
Exchange 24 Sep 08++]


COMBAT VETERAN HEALTH CARE UPDATE 03: The Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA) utilizes the Department of Defense (DOD) Combat Zones
listing of designated hostile fire or imminent danger pay areas in
establishing whether or not veterans are eligible for this category of
health care. Although DOD Hostile Fire or Imminent Danger pay existed
prior to 11 NOV 98, only proof of such pay after 11 NOV 98, is
acceptable. The table provided at http://www.va.gov/healtheligibility/Library/pubs/CombatOperations should
assist in the determination of combat veteran eligibility. The following
definitions are applicable in determining combat veteran status:

a.) Combat Veteran. A combat veteran is a veteran who served on active
duty in a theater of combat operations during a period of war after the
Persian Gulf War or in combat against a hostile force during a period of
hostilities after November 11, 1998.
b.) Combat Zones. Combat zones are designated by an Executive Order from
the President as areas in which the United States (U.S.) Armed Forces
are engaging or have engaged in combat. An area usually becomes a combat
zone and ceases to be a combat zone on the dates the President
designates by Executive Order.
c.) Minimum Active Duty Service Requirement. The minimum active duty
service requirement is the shorter of the following two periods: (1) The
full period for which they were enlisted, called or ordered to active
duty, or (2) Twenty-four months of continuous active duty. NOTE: There
remain categories of veterans who are expressly excluded by statute from
the minimum active duty service requirement; e.g., veterans who were
discharged or released from active duty for a disability incurred or
aggravated in line of duty, those discharged or released from active
duty under an early out or hardship discharge, etc.
d.) Hostilities. Hostilities refers to conflict in which the members of
the Armed Forces are subjected to danger comparable to the danger to
which members of the Armed Forces have been subjected in a theater of
combat operations during a period of war. To determine whether a period
of hostilities is within the scope of this special authority, VA relies
upon the same citation and criterion used to determine eligibility for
VA Readjustment Counseling Service contained in 38 U.S.C., Section
1712A(a)(2)(B), as it applies to veterans in service after November 11,
1998. More specifically, criteria used to determine whether a veterans
service meets the qualifications required by statute include:

(1) Receipt of an expeditionary medal or other DOD authorized combat
related medal. Note: A certificate of award, or presentation of a
medal, in and of itself, will not suffice for VA health care eligibility
verification purposes without the submission of supporting documentation
(such as DD 214, Proof of Receipt of Hostile Fire or Imminent Danger
Pay, proof of exemption of Federal tax status for Hostile Fire or
Imminent Danger Pay after November 11, 1998), other military service
records or orders indicating combat service.
(2) Service in a location designated by an Executive Order as a combat zone;
(3) Receipt of DOD Hostile Fire or Imminent Danger pay or combat pay tax
exemption for serving in the area subject to hostilities; or
(4) Other factors as may be defined in policy and regulation by the
Secretary of Veterans Affairs.
e.) Hostilities or Imminent Danger Pay. Hostile fire pay is defined as
pay to anyone exposed to hostile fire or mine explosion, while imminent
danger pay is paid to anyone on duty outside the United States area who
is subject to physical harm or imminent danger due to wartime
conditions, terrorism, civil insurrection, or civil war.
f.) Medals. Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal, Armed
Forces Expeditionary Medal; Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal
(does not include Global War on Terrorism Medal); Kosovo Campaign Medal;
Southwest Asia Campaign Medal; and other DOD-authorized combat related
medals.

SBP PAID UP PROVISION UPDATE 06: As of this month, SBP payments ended
for retirees who are at least age 70 and have paid 30 years (360
cumulative months) of SBP premiums. This affects 137,000 retirees, who
will see their retired pay go up in the November checks. The net
increase in the check won&apos;t be quite as much as the premium, because
retired pay is taxable, whereas the SBP premiums were deducted before
taxes. In December, DFAS will display an&quot;SBP Counter&quot;on a retiree&apos;s
Retiree Account Statement. It will show the total months of SBP premiums
paid to date, so individuals can better project when their premiums will
end. [Source: MOAA Leg Up 10 Oct 08++]


ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY UPDATE 04: Army Secretary Peter Geren
recently signed a new media policy for Arlington National Cemetery that
calls for the creation of an oversight board to include representatives
from the cemetery, the Army and the media. Media coverage of funerals
at Arlington became an issue in April, when the Washington Post ran a
column about how the media was kept so far away from the funeral of a
Marine killed in Iraq that reporters could not hear the service. Under
the new policy, family members will have three options for media
coverage of their loved-ones&apos; funerals: No coverage, visual coverage,
or visual coverage and limited audio coverage. [Source: NAUS Weekly

110TH CONGRESS SCHEDULE UPDATE 01: The House stands adjourned until 11
a.m. on Saturday, 3 JAN 09. The Senate remains open but only plans to
conduct pro forma sessions until the General Election is completed.
During a pro forma session, the Senate is called to order for literally
about 30 seconds, but no business is conducted. The Senate Majority
Leader called the pro forma sessions to prevent the President from using
his Constitutional authority to appoint people to his administration
when Congress is adjourned. They are scheduled to reconvene for normal
business on Nov. 17. Indications are that legislators - election
winners and losers alike - may be called back to work in mid-November.
Starting in January, we&apos;ll have to get new bills introduced on our key
issues and work to get our legislators to renew their cosponsorships.

YMCA MEMBERSHIPS: The Department of Defense announced 1 OCT that
families of deployed members of the National Guard and Reserve, active
duty service members on independent duty and their families, and active
duty service members and their families assigned to selected bases would
be eligible for fully funded family memberships at participating YMCAs
in their local community. The new program, which is effective
immediately, was unveiled in a signing ceremony presided by Under
Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness David S.C. Chu. Also
signing the document was Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve
Affairs Thomas F. Hall and the Executive Director of the Armed Services
YMCA, retired Navy Rear Adm. Frank Gallo. The YMCA memberships for
Guard and Reserve families will be available while the service member is
deployed for a minimum of six months. The deploying service member will
also be eligible for three months pre- and post-deployment membership to
help promote family participation. Active duty families assigned to
independent duty stations, such as recruiting and ROTC assignments and
not currently receiving support from the service component will also be
eligible for memberships at participating YMCAs. Single service members
are eligible for fitness center memberships up to $50 a month. Active
duty families at selected bases will also be eligible for YMCA
memberships as part of a pilot program.

 Memberships will be issued on a first come, first served basis with
300 to 450 family memberships available per joint base location. The
selected bases are: Lackland AFB/Randolph AFB/Ft. Sam Houston TX;
Langley AFB, Va.; McCord AFB/Ft. Lewis, Wash.; Ft. Carson CO; Pearl
Harbor/Hickam AFB HI; Naval Weapons Station, Charleston S.C.; McGuire
AFB/Ft. Dix/ Lakehurst Naval Air Engineering Station, N.J.; Anacostia
NAS /Bolling AFB, Washington, D.C.; Ft. Myer/Henderson Hall, Va.;
Elmendorf AFB/Ft. Richardson, Alaska; and Andrews AFB/Naval Air Facility
D.C., Md. Additionally, 32 hours a month of gratis respite child care
will be available for families of deployed National Guard and Reserve
and geographically dispersed active duty service members in 10 states
with YMCA child care programs preapproved by DoD. Respite Child Care
is currently available at participating YMCAs in Indiana, Maryland,
Montana, North Carolina, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee,
Virginia and Washington. DoD is working with the Armed Services YMCA on
ways to expand the number of YMCA child care programs eligible to offer
respite care in order to meet this critical need. Participating YMCAs
have agreed to cap their monthly fees and waive all joining fees so
there is no cost for service members and their families for membership.
Some classes may have fees associated with them and if so, the service
member will be responsible for those costs. Signing up for the program
requires a YMCA/DoD eligibility form, a copy of deployment orders and
military ID. The YMCA/DoD eligibility form is available at http://www.miltaryonesource.com/. A completed eligibility form, a copy
of deployment orders (where applicable) and the military ID are all that
are needed for the local YMCA to process memberships. [Source: DoD News

TUBERCULOSIS: Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease. Many years
ago, this disease was referred to as&quot;consumption&quot;because without
effective treatment, these patients often would waste away. Today, of
course, tuberculosis usually can be treated successfully with
antibiotics. Like the common cold, it spreads through the air. Only
people who are sick with TB in their lungs are infectious. (Active TB).
When infectious people cough, sneeze, talk or spit, they propel TB
germs, known as bacilli, into the air. A person needs only to inhale a
small number of these to be infected. Left untreated, each person with
active TB disease will infect on average between 10 and 15 people every
year. But people infected with TB bacilli will not necessarily become
sick with the disease. It is also possible to have the TB bacilli in
your system, but it is under the control of your immune system and is
not currently active so you are not infectious (Latent TB). The immune
system&quot;walls off&quot;the TB bacilli which, protected by a thick waxy coat,
can lie dormant for years. When someone&apos;s immune system is weakened, the
chances of becoming sick are greater. Statistically:
- Someone in the world is newly infected with TB bacilli every second.
- Overall, one-third of the world&apos;s population is currently infected
with the TB bacillus.
- 5-10% of people who are infected with TB bacilli (but who are not
infected with HIV) become sick or infectious at sometime during their
life. People with HIV and TB infection are much more likely to develop TB.

 Most challenging for health officials are new forms of multi-drug
resistant tuberculosis and complicated cases in which the patient has
other conditions, including diabetes and HIV/AIDS. First and foremost,
people have to have health-seeking behavior. If you think that you, or
someone you know, may be infected, seek treatment as soon as possible.
People infected with tuberculosis disease may experience any of the
following signs and symptoms:
- Cough for more than 2 weeks
- Nausea / weakness / fatigue
- Rapid weight loss
- Fever and/or night sweats
- Chest pain
- Hemoptysis - the coughing up of blood. The blood may appear as pinkish
froth, mucus with a bloody streak or clot, or pure blood. Hemoptysis may
be the result of forceful coughing or a sign of a serious respiratory
illness.

If you are experiencing any of the above signs and symptoms of
tuberculosis, see your doctor immediately.
Ask your doctor or nurse if you have other questions about latent TB
infection or TB disease. For more information on the signs and symptoms
of TB refer to http://www.cdc.gov/features/tbawareness/. [Source: CDC website www.cdc.gov Oct 08++]


TUBERCULOSIS UPDATE 01: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major public health
concern in the Philippines. According to the World Health Organization
(WHO), the Philippines has the ninth highest number of tuberculosis
cases in the world and the second highest in southeast Asia. Globally,
there were more than nine million new cases and about 1.7 million deaths
from the disease in 2006; the WHO estimates there are more than 14
million people living with TB, which kills 75 Filipinos each day,
according to the Department of Health. TB ranked sixth amongst the 10
leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Philippines. [Source: ACS

MEDICARE PART D UPDATE 27: The official numbers have not yet been
released, but it appears that well over one million low-income people
with Medicare will be randomly reassigned to a new Part D drug plan for
2009 because their current plan will no longer qualify for a full
premium subsidy. An analysis revealed that, nationwide, there will be a
total of 308 [prescription drug plans] qualified to serve low-income
Medicare beneficiaries in 2009, almost 200 fewer than in 2008. These
almost-200 plans covered approximately 1.3 million individuals who will
now need to be reassigned. That number is up from 1.2 million
individuals who CMS reassigned in 2008 and 250,000 individuals in 2007.
In New York State alone, over a quarter million low-income people, most
of whom used to receive stable, comprehensive drug coverage under
Medicaid, are enrolled in plans with premiums that are rising above the
benchmark used to calculate the premium subsidy. Over 150,000 are in
five plans that were assigned new low-income enrollees for the first
time in 2008, but will be losing them to competing plans at the end of
the year. About one-third of these people are getting bumped from one
plan to another for the second time. That means that, in New York alone,
for the second year in a row, tens of thousands of low-income people
with Medicare will find themselves in a new plan, with a new list of
excluded or restricted drugs. Anyone who managed to receive prior
authorization for their medicines when they started a new plan last
January will have to go through the same bureaucratic nightmare with the
new company this January.

 This years plan is not required to transfer records to next years
plan and next years plan is not required to look at the medication
history of its new enrollees. This is nuts. The lives being dealt around
to insurance companies like cards at a poker table include the most
vulnerable people who receive Medicare. They are more likely to have a
mental illness or a cognitive impairment, such as dementia. They are
more likely to be widowed and live alone, without the benefit of a
caregiver who could help them choose a plan that covers their drugs. An
appeals system that regularly frustrates experienced advocates,
including trained lawyers, is an insurmountable challenge for people who
will learn at the pharmacy counter in January that their diabetes or
blood pressure medicine is not covered under the new plan.

 There are some simple short-term solutions that the next
administration can enact to lessen this problem (the Bush administration
has already refused to take these steps):

- The benchmark used to determine the maximum premium subsidy should be
calculated on the basis of the real cost of providing prescription drug
coverage.
- The excess subsidies that Medicare private health plans use to buy
down their drug premiums should not be used to depress the maximum
premium subsidy.
- If the benchmark were calculated based on the real cost, it would
raise the subsidy level, increase the number of full-subsidy plans and
reduce the number of low-income people facing reassignment.
- People should be reassigned to the plan that covers the highest
number of their drugs with the fewest restrictions.
- Computer-savvy consumers can use Medicare.gov to pick the plan that
best suits their needs. Low-income people with Medicare who have
difficulty navigating the plan selection process deserve the same care
and attention when the government picks their plan for them.

These are helpful solutions, but they are band-aids at best. Instability
is built into the privatized structure of Part D. Low-income people with
Medicare need the same choice that all people with Medicare deservea
stable, affordable drug benefit under Original Medicare. [Source:

MOBILIZED RESERVE 7 OCT 08: The Army, Air Force and Marine Corps
announced the current number of reservists on active duty as of 7 OCT 08
in support of the partial mobilization. The net collective result is
6,299 more reservists mobilized than last reported in the Bulletin for

MEDICARE PREMIUMS 2009 UPDATE 04: Medicare has announced that the JAN
09 Part B premiums and annual deductible ($135) will remain at the
current 2008 rates. This one-time relief from annual premium increases
was possible because of an accounting change that shifted a piece of the
Medicare budget from Part B (doctor visits) to Part A (hospital
treatment). However, income thresholds for imposing higher, means-tested
premiums will rise about 3.7% (from $82,000 to $85,000 for an
individual). That will ease the impact of the continuing phase-in of
means-tested premium increases for certain higher-income
Medicare-eligibles. Individuals with adjusted gross incomes above
$85,000 ($170,000 for a married couple) will still see a Part B premium
increase in 2009. Also, the Part A (hospital care) annual deductible
will be $1,068, an increase of $44. That covers beneficiaries costs for
the first 60 days of a Medicare-covered hospital stay, with patients
facing daily co-pays beyond that point. Following are the Part B 2009
premiums showing income thresholds for individuals&amp;couples, Part B
Monthly Premium to be paid, and Beneficiary Share of total Part B Cost:


- Under $85,000 Under $170,000 $96.40 25%

VA HEALTH CARE FUNDING UPDATE 16: The chairs of the House and Senate
Veterans Affairs committees have introduced legislation, to be taken up
next year, to ensure timelier and fully funded budgets for the VA health
care system. Proponents say passage of the Veterans Health Care Budget
Reform Act (H.R. 6939 and S. 3527) also might lead to a gradual
reopening of VA health care to thousands of priority group 8 veterans.
These are veterans with no service-connected ailments and, by government
standards, adequate income. Priority group 8 enrollments were stopped in
2003. The thrust of the VA health budget reform bill, however, is to
approve VA health care funds a year in advance and end a disturbing
pattern by Congress of passing VA budgets months after the budget year
begins 1 OCT. These two- and three-month delays have forced VA hospitals
and clinics to operate with funds frozen at previous year levels,
creating supply and staff shortages, hiring freezes, and delays in
equipment purchases. The health care budget reform bill would put the VA
health care budget under an advance appropriation schedule. If it were
in effect this year, Congress would be passing a VA health budget now to
take effect OCT 09. Part 2 of the package would improve the level of VA
health care funding by requiring the department to use a new actuarial
model that quite accurately can project the per capita cost of providing
health care to the VAs enrolled-patient population. The GAO would be
tasked with verifying the accuracy of VA health care cost projections
each year. Therefore, if the VA proposed a health budget short of
requirements, the White House would feel the political heat and would
have to explain both to Congress and to veterans why health services
were being targeted for reductions.

 This legislation is an innovation from the Partnership for Veterans
Health Care Budget Reform (PVHCBR), a group of eight veteran-service
organizations: AMVETS, the Blinded Veterans Association, Disabled
American Veterans, Jewish War Veterans, the Military Order of the Purple
Heart, Paralyzed Veterans of America, the American Legion, VFW, and
Vietnam Veterans of America. In introducing their plan as a bill, Rep.
Bob Filner (D-CA) chair of the House committee, called it a historic
new approach to guarantee that our veterans have access to
comprehensive, quality health care. Sen. Daniel Akaka (D-HI), Senate
committee chair, said it would end VA budgets that are untimely and
unpredictable. A bipartisan group of cosponsors came forward in both
chambers. Joining Akaka were Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME), Tim Johnson
(D-SD), Mary Landrieu (D-LA), Russ Feingold (D-WI), Ted Stevens (R-AK),
Lisa Murkowski (R-AR), and John Thune (R-SD). Cosponsors with Filner in
the House were Reps. Walter Jones (R-NC), Michael Michaud (D-ME), and
Phil Hare (D-IL). The veterans group partnership choose a new path
toward VA health care budget reform after Congress declined year after
year to back a law that would mandate full funding of the VA health care
system for every veteran needing care. Lawmakers argued it would limit
congressional prerogatives. It also would expand VA entitlements in
violation of the pay-as-you-go budget rule that the cost of any new
entitlement be offset by a cut in another entitlement account or by
raising taxes.

 One proponent of VA budgeting reform is Bob Perrault, who served as
director of three VA medical centers before retiring from the Veterans
Health Administration in 2004 as its top business officer. Perrault says
that in every year he can remember as the director of those medical
centers, congressional delays in passing a VA health care budget
resulted in disruptive shortages and inefficient spending patterns.
Wed stopped buying equipment. Wed stopped doing maintenance just to
try to maintain [staff] as long as we could, Perrault says. Patient
waiting lists would grow, and dedicated staff got blamed for management
lapses, when the real culprit was Congress. Until VA health budgets are
reformed, even veterans advocates say it isnt practical to swing open
the doors of VA health care again to priority group 8 veterans. If that
happens, says Peter Dickinson, a consultant to Disabled American
Veterans and former staff member on the House Veterans Affairs
Committee, we could be in danger of returning to the days of 03 and
04, when more than 300,000 veterans waited six months or longer to
get an appointment. Ironically, this year, a day before the new fiscal
year began, Congress passed and the president signed into law the
Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance and Continuing Appropriations
Act (H.R. 2638). It raised VA spending to $94.35 billion in fiscal 2009
NDAA, an increase of $6.75 billion or 7.7%. Two-thirds of that increase,
$4.1 billion, is for health care. This won praise from veteran service
organizations. Proponents say passage of the Veterans Health Care Budget
Reform Act next year could make legislative performances  like this one
on behalf of veterans  the rule rather than the exception. [Source:

TRICARE UNIFORM FORMULARY UPDATE 26: On 17 SEP the Beneficiary
Advisory Panel (BAP) met to provide comments to the Department of
Defense (DoD) Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committees (P&amp;T Committee)
recommendations on formulary status, pre-authorizations, and the
effective date for a drugs change from formulary to non-formulary
status. Moving a drug to non-formulary status means it will still be
available to beneficiaries, but usually at a higher price. It may also
require medication authorization. Current and new drugs were reviewed.
The BAP&apos;s recommendations were:
 Self-monitoring blood glucose system test strips (SMBGS): SMBGS
recommended for the Uniform Formulary were: Accu-chek Aviva, Precision
Xtra, Freestyle Lite, and the Ascensia Contour. All others were
designated as non-formulary. Under this recommendation, beneficiaries
who currently use designated non-formulary SMBGS will be given a free
formulary SMBGS meter of their choice. All of the BAP members felt the
implementation time of 120-days was inadequate and voted against it.
 Overactive Bladder Drugs: Oxybutynin patch (Oxytrol) was designated to
move from non-formulary to formulary status. Two drugs were designated
to be moved to the non-formulary status: tolterodine IR (Detrol) and
trospium IR (Sanctura) following a 90-day implementation period.
 Newly Approved Drugs: Two drugs, Desvenlafaxine (Pristiq) used to
treat depression and Nisoldipine geomatrix (Sular geomatrix) for the
treatment of hypertension, were designated as non-formulary with a
60-day implementation period. These medications were only recently
introduced, so relatively few beneficiaries are taking them.
The recommendations will be submitted to the Assistant Secretary of
Defense (Health Affairs) for final decision.
DoD will notify all beneficiaries currently taking the medications being
moved to the third tier so they and their doctors can consider
alternative medications available at the lower copay. Information on
alternative medications can be found via www.tricareformularysearch.org.
A doctor who believes it is important for a patient to take the
third-tier medication can provide&quot;medical necessity&quot;justification to
Tricare. If approved, the patient will continue receiving the medication
at the lower copay. For a complete list of formulary medications, go to: http://www.tricareformularysearch.org/dod/medicationcenter/default.aspx. For additional information on this or other BAP meetings, refer to http://www.tricare.mil/pharmacy/bap/. [Source: NMFA Government&amp;You

CONTINUING RESOLUTION: None of the 12 annual appropriations bills have
been enacted into law this year so Congress has provided a Continuing
Resolution (CR) for the President to sign. A CR is a type of
appropriations legislation used by the United States Congress to fund
government agencies if a formal appropriations bill has not been signed
into law by the end of the Congressional fiscal year. The legislation
takes the form of a joint resolution, and provides funding for existing
federal programs at current or reduced levels. The national government&apos;s
budget calendar runs from 1 OCT thru 30 SEP of each year. Each federal
department, agency and program is authorized to spend congressionally
specified amounts of money. That money cannot be spent, however, unless
it is explicitly appropriated for a given purpose. For example, an
agency might be authorized to spend $2 billion on a program, but it does
not actually have that money to spend until it is appropriated for that
program. Each year, the Congress must pass and the President must sign
12 separate appropriations bills by 1 OCT to fund all of the national
government&apos;s departments, agencies and programs for the following year.
If the Congress and President fail to pass all of the appropriations
bills, there will be some agencies and programs that do not have the
money appropriated to them that they are authorized to spend. In other
words, there will be no money to spend on some legally established
programs and national government functions. In most instances, the
Congress and the President will agree to a Continuing Resolution which
temporarily funds the programs and agencies for which appropriations
bills have not been passed. A CR must be passed by both houses of
Congress and signed by the President. Generally, a CR funds agencies or
programs for a month or two at the same funding level as the previous
year. The main purpose of a CR is to keep the government running long
enough for the Congress and President to work out an agreement on all 12
appropriations



 bills. [Source: EANGUS Minuteman Update 25 Sep 08++]


CT VET PROPERTY TAX: Governor M. Jodi Rell announced 30 SEP that she
has directed the Connecticut Department of Veterans Affairs and the
Office of Policy and Management to help ensure disabled
service-connected veterans receive their annual property tax abatement
benefits. Governor Rell was notified today by the United States
Department of Veterans Affairs (USVA) of a change the federal government
made in the procedure when it comes to disabled veterans filing the
proper tax abatement paperwork with their tax assessors office. Upon
receiving this background today from the USVA on the change in the
filing procedure, Governor Rell immediately notified town assessors and
their respective mayors and first selectmen. She said the state
Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) and the Office of Policy and
Management will work closely with the USVA and local tax assessors to
ensure that disabled service-connected veterans receive their required
annual tax abatement documentation and have time to file it with their
local municipality. Governor Rell will also be contacting the USVA to
protest the short notice given to disabled veterans and tax assessors
regarding how the federal government verifies veteran disability ratings
for local tax purposes.

 In a change to past procedure, disabled service-connected veterans
must now individually request a letter from the USVA verifying their
service-connected disability which in turn must be submitted to their
local tax assessor. Previously, the USVA automatically issued VA Form
20-5455, Statement from Benefit Payment Records, annually to all
eligible disabled veterans. Effective 1 JUL 08, the USVA converted to a
new payment records system which will no longer allow the traditional VA
Form 20-5455 to be issued. Disabled Connecticut veterans must now
request a disability verification letter from the USVAs Regional Office
in Newington by emailing their name and claim number to pctc.vbahar@... or by faxing a signed request to (860) 665-7654.
Disabled veterans who do not have convenient access to email or a fax
machine may also provide their name and claim number through the
Connecticut DVA Veteran Information Line at 1-866-928-8387. Disabled
veterans may also visit one of the Connecticut Department of Veterans
Affairs (CTDVA) district offices in Bridgeport, Newington, Norwich,
Rocky Hill or West Haven for assistance. CTDVA staff will be able to
submit requests for disability verification letters to the USVA on
behalf of disabled veterans.

 Governor Rell and the Office of Policy Management (OPM) are
notifying each local tax assessor of this change in USVA procedure and
documentation and asking that tax assessors allow disabled veterans
additional time to submit their disability verification letters this
year. Most municipalities require documentation for tax abatement
purposed to be submitted by 1 OCT. OPM will also help field questions
from local assessors and resolve issues on behalf of disabled
veterans. In this tough economy, we must all work together to ensure
our veterans obtain all the financial benefits they have so richly
earned, said Governor Rell. Working with our Federal partners,
hopefully we can develop a more streamlined system that reduces the
annual documentation requirements for disabled veterans, the USVA and
our local tax assessors. [Source: Norwalk Plus magazine article 30 Sep

VA CLAIMS BACKLOG UPDATE 19: Lawmakers have high expectations that
they can reduce the backlog and processing time for veterans benefits
claims through a combination of new procedures, including two pilot
projects. The Veterans Benefits Improvement Act of 2008, which passed
Congress on Saturday and is being prepared for submission to the White
House for President Bushs signature, pushes the Department of Veterans
Affairs to use electronic filing and processing of claims to try to
improve the speed of claims decisions, reduce the disparity in decisions
involving similar issues and cut the number of claims decisions that end
up being overturned. The bill also creates a new authority to provide a
temporary disability rating for some veterans who have severe and
multiple disabilities that are not fully healed. Stabilized and
unstabilized disabilities that have an impact on employment could be
considered in assigning the temporary rating that would be used to
provide disability compensation during the first year after leaving the
military.

 One of the pilot projects ordered by the compromise bill requires
special, expedited treatment for disability claims where the veteran had
the help of a veterans service officer to prepare the paperwork. This
one-year test would be carried out in at least 10 regional offices. A
second pilot project, to run over three years in at least four regional
offices, would have processors and veterans use a checklist when
submitting claims in an effort to bring more organization and uniformity
to the claims process. The bill also gives VA one year to develop a
program using information technology to process claims that would allow
veterans to file applications and to track the progress of their claim
online. Several provisions in the bill were drawn from a claims
modernization bill sponsored by Rep. John Hall (D-NY) and Sen. Hillary
Clinton (D-NY) that attempts to improve training for VA workers who are
processing claims and to change how employees are evaluated. Hall said
processing a first-time claim by a disabled veteran can take 180 days
and even longer if a veteran appeals the initial decision. The long
processing time is part of the reason there is a backlog of about
400,000 claims awaiting a decision by VA.

 Over the last two years, members of the House and Senate veterans
affairs committees have tried to push VA to process claims more quickly
while also complaining about the rate of mistakes in claims and evidence
that similar claims are decided differently between VA regional offices.
In the report accompanying the benefits bill, the two committees say
they want a process that is perceived as fair by veterans, but realize
it is unreasonable to expect states to have exactly the same average
compensation or percentage of veterans receiving compensation. The bill
requires a report  due one year from now  that looks at variances in
benefits between regional offices and between veterans of different
states to determine whether the differences are justified. [Source:

PURPLE HEART: Congressman Bob Filner announced on 7 OCT that the Purple
Heart will be presented posthumously to all prisoners-of-war who die in
captivity. The revised policy allows retroactive award of the Purple
Heart to qualifying prisoners-of-war since 7 DEC 41. Posthumous award
will be made to the deceased service member&apos;s representative, as
designated by the secretary of the military department concerned, upon
application to that military department. The legislation that makes
this possible is Filners bill, Honor Our Fallen Prisoners of War Act,
passed by Congress in 2006. The Department of Defense announced its
complete implementation 6 OCT. The law now presumes that the death of
all service members who die in captivity was the result of enemy action
or the result of wounds incurred in action with the enemy during capture
and imprisonment, said Congressman Filner. Before passage of my bill,
prisoners of war who died during imprisonment of wounds inflicted by an
instrument of war were eligible for posthumous Purple Heart recognition,
but those who died of starvation, disease, abuse, freezing or other
causes during captivity were not. There should be no false distinction
indicating more courage or more sacrifice by some prisoners of war
over others, said Filner. The Honor Our Fallen Prisoners of War Act had
over 200 co-sponsors and broad bi-partisan support in Congress. In
addition, many major Veteran Service Organizations supported the bill,
including the American Legion, the Military Order of the Purple Heart,
and the American Ex-Prisoners of War. The Senate bill was introduced by
Senator Barbara Boxer. The inspiration for my bill came from
Wilbert Shorty Estabrook, who was imprisoned for more than three years
during the Korean War, and Rick and Brenda Tavares. Brendas uncle,
Corporal Melvin Morgan, died in Korea of starvation and beatings in 1950
at the age of 20, said Filner. Each military department will publish

TRS UPDATE 10: Eligible families of activated National Guard and
Reserve members will continue to save up to $300 in annual deductibles
now that a Tricare demonstration program is a permanent benefit.
Eligible family members of Guard and Reserve personnel activated for
more than 30 days under federal orders in support of a contingency
operation are made eligible for Tricare Standard and Tricare Extra,
which have annual deductibles. While they may be eligible to enroll
into Tricare Prime or Tricare Prime Remote for Active Duty Family
Members, which have no deductibles, many may choose to stay with Tricare
Standard or Extra. Introduced as one of the first Tricare healthcare
enhancements after Sept. 11, 2001 to assist the increasing number of
National Guard and Reserve service members activated to support the
Global War on Terrorism, the benefit waiving annual deductibles has been
a demonstration project for over seven years. The demonstration has
worked well and the benefit is not changing, said the Deputy Director
of TRICARE Management Activity, Maj. Gen. Elder Granger. We simply want
to make sure our Guard and Reserve families know this is a permanent
benefit now that final federal regulation has been published.

 Guard or Reserve families often meet annual deductibles
under their commercial plans before they get activated. Waiving the
Tricare Standard and Extra deductibles means eligible families will not
have to pay additional deductibles under Tricare. The annual deductible
for Standard and Extra is $300 for families. The published regulation
also contains provisions that make it easier for Reserve and Guard
members to continue to see their family physicians by potentially
increasing the amount that can be paid to out-of-network health care
providers. Since eligibility for Tricare benefits is determined by the
services, to ensure family members are eligible for the Tricare Reserve
Family Benefit, activated Reserve and Guard members should visit their
local military ID card issuing facility and update their information in
the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS). [Source:

CA VET LEGISLATION: Secretary Johnson on 30 SEP 08 praised Governor
Schwarzenegger for recognizing the needs of today&apos;s veterans by signing
the following legislation that acknowledges their many contributions to
our nation:

- SB 1675 by Senator Dave Cox (R-Fair Oaks) provides that a Resolution
of Issuance approved by the Veterans Debenture Finance Committee may
give the Department of Veterans Affairs the discretion to structure the
terms and conditions of any issuance of Revenue Bonds for the CalVet

- AB 3083 by the Assembly Committee on Veterans Affairs requires the
Department of Health Care Services (DHCS), in conjunction with the
Department of Mental Health (DMH), to seek all available federal funding
for mental health services for veterans. The bill also extends mental
health services provided by the Adult and Older Adult Mental Health

MEDICARE FRAUD UPDATE 10: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services announced 6 OCT it is ramping up efforts to detect fraud that
costs the agency millions in fake billing for home health services and
durable medical equipment never delivered. CMS officials said the agency
is launching a national recovery audit contractor program that will
track businesses whose billing for Medicare services trends higher. CMS
also is taking additional steps in specific states where fraud is the
most rampant.&quot;Because Medicare pays for medical services and items
without looking behind every claim, the potential for waste, fraud and
abuse is high,&quot;CMS Acting Administrator Kerry Weems said in a
statement.&quot;By enhancing our oversight efforts we can better ensure that
Medicare dollars are being used to pay for equipment or services that
beneficiaries actually received while protecting them and the Medicare
trust fund from unscrupulous providers and suppliers.&quot;Durable medical
equipment suppliers, who provide such equipment as oxygen supplies or
power wheelchairs, have faced increasing heat as lawmakers search for
areas of Medicare&apos;s budget to trim and Senate Republicans make fighting
Medicare fraud their major healthcare focus.

 CMS estimates that $1 billion of the $10 billion it made in payments
for durable medical equipment from APR 06 to MAR 07 were improper, in
part due to fraud, according to a recent Government Accountability
Office report. Both the GAO and the Health and Human Services inspector
general have urged CMS to beef up its fraud detection efforts on the
equipment industry. Durable medical equipment suppliers, represented by
the American Association of Homecare, agree with CMS&apos; announcement
Monday, a spokesman said. During a three-year demonstration program in
six states, the recovery audit contractors that CMS now plans to use
nationwide recovered $900 million in overpayments. The agency also plans
to verify with beneficiaries delivery of home health services or durable
medical equipment for which Medicare was billed and keep an even closer
eye on durable medical equipment suppliers in Florida, California,
Texas, Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina and New York as well as home
health agencies in Florida. In those states, equipment suppliers&apos; claims
will be scrutinized more closely, and CMS will make unannounced visits
to ensure the companies are in business. [Source: Congress Daily Anna

NDAA 2009 UPDATE 07: Defense spending and authorization measures have
been cleared by Congress and are on their way to the President for
signature. Last week, Senate leaders were looking at a list of 300-plus
amendments when the FY2009 Defense Authorization Bill (S. 3001) came to
the floor for action. A flap over pork barrel spending forced Senate
leaders to drop almost all amendments to the FY 2009 Defense
Authorization Bill in order to get it passed. The measure was pushed
through the Senate by unanimous consent on 27 SEP. The bill authorizes
$531.4 billion in base Defense Department spending, along with an
additional $68.6 billion in emergency war spending, and:

 Authorizes a 3.9% across-the-board pay raise for military personnel;
 Authorizes fiscal 2009 active-duty end strengths for the Army and
Marine Corps of 532,400 and 194,000, respectively, an increase of 7,000
soldiers and 5,000 Marines from 2008 authorized levels;
 Authorizes an increase of 2,110 full-time support soldiers for the
Army National Guard above the Administrations request;
 Authorizes $124.8 billion for military personnel costs in fiscal 2009,
including costs of pay, allowances, bonuses, death benefits, and
permanent change of station moves;
 Requires payment of previously authorized bonuses to the survivors of
members who die on active duty and to individuals who are retired or
separated for combat-related disabilities;
 Authorizes new accession and retention bonuses for psychologists and
other mental health professionals;
 Authorizes $25 billion for the Defense Health Program, which includes
the $1.2 billion necessary to prohibit any increase in TRICARE fees in 2009;
 Prohibits for 1 year the increase of any premium, deductible, and
copayment under TRICARE;
 Increases the cap on benefits under the Extended Health Care Option
program for all qualified families from $2,500 per month to an annual
cap of $36,000;
 Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to establish programs, including
tuition assistance, to assist spouses of active-duty service members in
obtaining education and training required for a degree, credential, or
professional licensure in order to expand their employment and portable
career opportunities;
 Authorizes pilot programs to evaluate the need for more flexibility in
military career progression that would allow service members to leave
active service for up to three years, retain health care coverage, and
return with the same grade and years of service;
 Requires the Secretary of Defense to establish a task force on suicide
prevention;
 Provides $55 million in Department of Defense (DOD) supplemental
impact aid for schools;
 Requires the Secretaries of Defense and the Veterans Affairs to
continue the operations of the Senior Oversight Committee to oversee
implementation of Wounded Warrior initiatives and requires that they

well as a center of excellence in prevention, diagnosis, mitigation,
treatment, and rehabilitation of hearing loss and auditory system injuries;
 Fully funds Army and Marine Corps readiness and depot maintenance
programs to ensure that forces preparing to deploy are trained and their
equipment is ready;
 Supports the Presidents budget request for the Armys Future Combat
Systems and recommends provisions to improve program management and

VETERAN SPOUSE FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT: In SEP 08 President Bush issued an
order granting federal agencies the authority to bypass competitive
hiring regulations to appoint spouses of military service members to
civilian government jobs.&quot;It shall be the policy of the United States
to provide for the appropriately expedited recruitment and selection of
spouses of members of the armed forces for appointment to positions in
the competitive service,&quot;Bush&apos;s executive order stated. The order
allows agency heads to make noncompetitive appointments to the following
groups of people:
- Spouses of military service members who are on active duty under
orders that authorize a permanent change of station move assuming the
spouse is moving, too.
- Spouses of totally disabled retired or separated members of the armed
forces.
- Widows or widowers (who have not remarried) of service members killed
on active duty.

The order follows Bush&apos;s proposal in his State of the Union address in
January that Congress work to expand benefits for military families.&quot;Our military families ... endure sleepless nights and the daily
struggle of providing for children while a loved one is serving far from
home,&quot;Bush said.&quot;We have a responsibility to provide for them. So I
ask you to join me in expanding their access to child care, creating new
hiring preferences for military spouses across the federal government,
and allowing our troops to transfer their unused education benefits to
their spouses or children.&quot;[Source: GOVExec.com Tom Shoop article 29

VA FRAUD UPDATE 13: A Pittsburgh woman pleaded guilty 29 AUG to
stealing her dead mother&apos;s VA benefits for more than two years. Laurie
Davin withdrew more than $38,000 from her mother&apos;s bank account from FEB
05 to OCT 07 She pleaded guilty to theft of government property before
U.S. District Judge David S. Cercone. According to the prosecution, Ms.
Davin&apos;s mother, Helen Lang, was receiving the dependency payments on
behalf of her husband. But Ms. Lang died on 3 FRB 05, and the payments
should have stopped. Under what is known as the&quot;Death Match&quot;project,
investigators with Veterans Affairs inspector general&apos;s office found
that money was still being deposited to Ms. Lang&apos;s account. When
confronted, Ms. Davin told investigators that she was having financial
problems and that her mother had lived with her for 10 years and
contributed toward household expenses. The woman also said she was
trying to sell her home, support her daughter in college and was working
two jobs at the time. She also had recently for filed bankruptcy. Ms.
Davin had power of attorney over her mother&apos;s account and used an ATM
card to make 144 withdrawals before she stopped. Judge Cercone set
sentencing for 15 DEC 08. [Source: Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Paula Reed

VA FRAUD UPDATE 14: Three Lowell MA residents residing in the same
household are facing federal charges that they bilked disabled vets
living at the Edith Nourse Rogers Memorial Veterans Hospital in Bedford
MA out of thousands of dollars through identity fraud. Wilfredo
Hernandez, 41, has been indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit
fraud, identity fraud and access-device fraud, as have his 60-year-old
mother, Gladys Hernandez, and his 27-year-old girlfriend, Jessica
Rivera. The Hernandezes were both released on a $10,000 unsecured bond
29 SEP after their initial appearance in federal court. Rivera will
appear before the court 9 OCT. Federal investigators allege that
Wilfredo Hernandez, who worked at the Edith Nourse Rogers Memorial
Veterans Hospital in Bedford as a custodian for about 20 years, and
Rivera, a nurse&apos;s assistant for about seven years, stole credit-card
information, bank-account numbers and blank checks from a handful of
veterans. They then shared the stolen information with Gladys Hernandez
before using it to pay bills and purchase goods online and by telephone,
the indictment says. They also allegedly made out the stolen checks to
other family members, who would then hand over that amount in cash.

 The trio&apos;s indictment lists four veterans who were allegedly
targeted. They are permanent residents of the hospital&quot;due to the
extensive nature of their disabilities,&quot;the indictment says. The trio
initiated the fraud in AUG 07, when they used one veteran&apos;s information
to apply for a credit card with Capital One, the indictment says. There
appears to have been no further activity until 5 OCT 07, when Wilfredo
Hernandez allegedly accessed the Sovereign Bank account of a second
veteran to initiate a $350 payment toward his cell-phone bill. That
veteran&apos;s bank accounts were then targeted six more times over the next
two months for another $2,430. Federal officials say the trio used that
money as cash or applied it toward cell-phone and cable bills. A third
veteran&apos;s credit card was also used in NOV/DEC 07 to purchase $1,758.96
worth of products from cable shopping channels QVC and Home Shopping
Network, the indictment says. The trio allegedly targeted the Ocean
Bank account of the fourth veteran once, in PCT 07, attempting to
initiate an electronic payment of $4,947 to the CMD Wholesale clothing
company. The thefts were uncovered in JAN 08, when relatives of the
veterans reported the unusual bank activity to the hospital, the
indictment says. The case was then investigated by officials from the
Veterans Administration and U.S. Secret Service. If they are convicted,
the Hernandezes and Rivera face up to 15 years in prison, along with
three years of supervised release and a $250,000 fine. [Source: Lowell

ALS UPDATE 05: On 23 SEP 08 the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
announced that all veterans with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
would become presumptively compensable for the illness. This would
apply to all veterans with 90 days or more of continuously active
service in the military regardless of when or where they served. VA will
provide disability pay, lifetime health care and death benefits. The
10-year cost for death and disability benefits is projected at
$505,839,000, said Tom Pamperin, the deputy director of the compensation
and pension service at the Veterans Affairs Department. That figure does
not include health care costs. VA Secretary Peake based his decision
primarily on a NOV 06 report by the National Academy of Sciences&apos;
Institute of Medicine (IOM) on the association between active-duty
service and ALS. The report, titled Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in
Veterans: Review of the Scientific Literature, analyzed numerous
previous studies on the issue and concluded, there is limited and
suggestive evidence of an association between military service and later
development of ALS. Studies indicate veterans are twice as likely to
develop ALS as people with no history of military service.&quot;This is a
disease that progresses rapidly, once it is diagnosed. There simply
isn&apos;t time to develop the evidence needed to support compensation claims
before many veterans become seriously ill. My decision will make those
claims much easier to process, and for them and their families to
receive the compensation they have earned through their service to our
nation.&quot;ALS, also called Lou Gehrig&apos;s disease, is a neuromuscular disease
that affects about 20,000 to 30,000 people of all races and ethnicities
in the United States, is often relentlessly progressive, and is almost
always fatal. It causes degeneration of nerve cells in the brain and
spinal cord that leads to muscle weakness, muscle atrophy, and
spontaneous muscle activity. Currently, the cause of ALS is unknown,
and there is no effective treatment. The new interim final regulation
applies to all applications for benefits received by VA on or after 23
SEP 08, or that are pending before VA, the United States Court of
Appeals for Veterans Claims or the United States Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit on that date. VA will work to identify and contact
veterans with ALS, including those whose claims for ALS were previously
denied, through direct mailings and other outreach programs. The
government expects 416 new cases among veterans in 2009, and a total of
about 700 a year qualifying for the benefits. In some cases their
survivors will quality for death benefits. The death and disability
benefits alone are expected to cost about $23 million in 2009. For more

TOMB OF THE UNKNOWNS UPDATE 01: U.S. Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI),
Chairman of the Veterans&apos; Affairs Committee, reacted today to a joint
report from the Departments of the Army and Veterans Affairs on
alternatives to replacing the Tomb Monument at the Tomb of the Unknowns
at Arlington National Cemetery. The report was required under the
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, due to an
amendment co-sponsored by Akaka and Senator Jim Webb (D-VA). Among
other findings, the report which is available at http://veterans.senate.gov/public/media/unknown_soldier_letter.pdf outlines several possible means of repairing and preserving, rather than
replacing, the now-weathered monument at the tomb. Akaka said,&quot;Many of
our most treasured American symbols, from the Liberty Bell to the
original Star-Spangled Banner, are physically worn and weathered by
time. This does not diminish their value or significance. I am pleased
that the Departments of Army and Veterans Affairs have determined a
number ways to repair this national treasure, rather than replacing it
with a replica. I urge them to pursue the best means of preserving the
Tomb for future generations Americans&quot;. The Tomb of the Unknowns,
located at Arlington National Cemetery, is a monument to honor those
servicemembers who do not return from battle. It stands as a tangible
tribute to their service, as well as a place for their families and
others to contemplate their absence. The Tomb Monument sits above the
tombs for the unknowns from World War I, World War II, and the Korean
Conflict. Over time, the Tomb Monument has aged to show signs of
natural wear, including developing a number of cracks. [Source: Sen.

ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY UPDATE 03: Arlington National Cemetery, the
final resting place for more than 340,000 soldiers, presidents and other
distinguished Americans, has moved a step closer to adding thousands of
grave sites. On 16 SEP Arlingtoin County officials approved a 4.3-acre
land swap with the federal government that will allow the cemetery to
add as many as 3,440 burial sites. The move is part of expansion plans
set forth more than four decades ago that military officials say will
allow burials to continue until 2060. After that, plans are less clear.
The 4.3-acre portion will convert Navy Annex land west of the Pentagon
to grave sites. Arlington County&apos;s Southgate Road would have divided the
new cemetery space. The county will swap land that includes the road
for a comparable piece of the annex that the county can use for a
potential history complex and for redevelopment along Columbia Pike. The
exchange is scheduled for 2011, although that timeline could change,
federal and local officials said.

 George W. Dodge, president of the Arlington Historical Society said,&quot;It&apos;s not just a cemetery now; it&apos;s a shrine. It&apos;s a shrine to valor and
the sacrifices American men and women have made. Given the space
constraints, there are only a finite number of days or years it can stay
open . . . so acreage becomes an issue. You can trace the history of
this country through all the interments there. It&apos;s like a walk through
history. If it&apos;s cut off at some point, you&apos;re going to lose that.&quot;Soldiers from the Revolutionary War to the Iraq war have been buried on
the 624-acre grounds, including William Russell, a colonel from the
Virginia regiment who was present during the winter at Valley Forge.
Presidents William H. Taft and John F. Kennedy are there, as are North
Pole explorers Robert Peary and Matthew Henson. Dirt dug from graves
today is moved nearby to help prepare future sites. Officials estimate
that each acre can accommodate 600 to 800 graves. In other expansion
plans, the cemetery is building a wall along Route 110 that will hold
6,500 niches for cremated remains. A third project will add sites near
Fort Myer. And what happens a half-century from now, when the land runs
out?&quot;It&apos;s hard to say,&quot;said Kaitlin Horst, a cemetery official.&quot;I
don&apos;t know that that&apos;s been discussed at this point. We&apos;re working on
the three we have now, and I guess we&apos;ll cross that bridge when we get
to it.&quot;[Source: Washington Post Michael Laris article 18 Sep 08 +]


FILIPINO VET INEQUITIES UPDATE 10: In a compromise that could end a
contentious debate over whether the U.S. still owes a debt to Filipinos
who served alongside American troops in World War II, the House Veterans
Affairs Committee approved a plan 17 SEP for a one-time payment to
surviving veterans instead of an annual pension. But if veterans were to
take the payments spelled out in HR 6897  $15,000 for U.S. citizens and
$9,000 for noncitizens  they would waive the right to ever receive
another pension for their World War II service if the federal government
were to someday pass a more generous bill. About 18,000 Filipinos would
qualify for payments under the bill, according to estimates prepared by
the Congressional Budget Office. Disagreement over the pensions and how
to pay for them has been the chief cause of deadlock on veterans
benefits legislation. The Senate passed a benefits bill, S 1315, that
included the Filipino pensions, but there was no final vote on the
Houses bill, HR 760, because of complaints about a plan to grant
special pensions to Filipino Scouts and other veterans who worked with
the U.S. in World War II  $3,600 a year for single veterans and $4,500
for married veterans. Some lawmakers and veterans groups said the $221
million annual cost would be better spent on immediate needs for U.S.
veterans and their families, especially Iraq and Afghanistan combat
veterans.

 Rep. Bob Filner (D-CA), the House Veterans Affairs Committee
chairman and one of the staunchest advocates for providing pensions for
Filipino veterans, is the chief sponsor of the compromise bill. Rep.
Steve Buyer of Indiana, the committees ranking Republican, opposed the
initial pension bill and is the sponsor of the amendment calling for
veterans who accept the one-time payment to waive the right to receive
future benefits for the same period of service. Filner said he is not
happy about the one-time payment, which would be provided only if money
is available. A lump-sum payment is a more practical way to pay the
benefit, he said, but added: It is clearly not the most just or
equitable, and for that I am disappointed. Buyer still is not
completely on board, expressing concern that providing payments to
Filipinos could lead French, Italian and other nationalities who helped
in World War II to also seek benefits from the U.S. Committee aides, who
asked not to be identified, said House leaders have indicated support
for the compromise, allowing the House to vote on an issue that has
delayed work on other veterans legislation. Whether the one-time
payment becomes law will depend on what happens in the Senate, where
Sen. Daniel Akaka, the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee chairman, has
placed a high priority on providing pensions to Filipinos who helped the
U.S. military. Aides to Akaka said the senator has not endorsed the new
House proposal. [Source: ArmyTimes Rick Maze article 18 Sep 08++]

VFW FINANCIAL OFFICER INDICTED: The former chief financial officer of
the New Mexico state branch of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) is
accused of using a debit card to steal more than $120,000 from the
organization. Joe Salas has been indicted by a grand jury on 652 counts
of embezzlement and fraud. Authorities allege that Salas, who had been
the organizations financial officer since 1997, had a debit card issued
in his name from the VFWs account and used it for personal expenses.
Tires, gasoline, airline tickets, jewelry and other items were
purchased. Salas daughter, Claudine Sanchez, was indicted on 15
theft-related counts. Authorities allege she received VFW checks from
her father for personal expenses. After learning of the allegations, a
national VFW board banned Salas from being a member anywhere in the
country for the rest of his life. The VFW was forced to close its state
headquarters in Albuquerque because of the stolen funds. The
headquarters is now in Ruidoso and there is no office in Albuquerque.
The organization also hasnt been able to issue as many youth

GI BILL UPDATE 29: In the remaining 3½ months of the Bush
administration, the nominee to head the Veterans Benefits
Administration knows he cannot put much of a dent in the backlog of
benefits claims, nor significantly reduce the time it takes for claims
to be processed. But retired Rear Adm. Patrick Dunne, nominated to be
VAs undersecretary of benefits, said 17 SEP he will concentrate on
setting the stage so things work more smoothly for the next
administration. Getting VA ready to pay Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits when
that program takes effect on 1 AUG 09, is a top priority, Dunne said.
Continuing to prepare for a future paperless claims system and
completing a review of disability ratings issues so the next
administration could reform benefits are two other things hed like to
get done in the remaining months of the Bush presidency. Dunne,
currently VAs acting benefits director, appears to have strong support
among members of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. But
congressional aides, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said
getting a full Senate vote on the nomination could be difficult because
of concerns among some senators about veterans issues not directly
related to Dunne. The aides would not name the senators. Sen. Daniel
Akaka (D-HI), veterans committee chairman, strongly endorsed Dunne.
The committees ranking Republican member, Sen. Richard Burr of North
Carolina, also endorsed Dunne, saying the nominee could help set in
motion changes at VA to help veterans in the future.

 Dunne said harnessing technology to help process claims and
allowing veterans to file electronic claims and to send e-mail to claims
processors are keys to a faster, more accurate system. But he said
technology is not a cure-all. I intend to ensure that every Veterans
Benefits Administration employee has the requisite training to be
effective in his or her job, Dunne said. Technology is not the magic
wand that will deliver benefits rapidly and accurately. Rather, we need
a well-trained work force that can effectively use those tools. The
issue of harnessing technology is creating a controversy over
implementation of the Post-9/11 GI Bill because VA is turning to an
outside contractor to develop a software program to process claims, make
tuition payments directly to colleges and universities, and make
payments for living expenses and book allowances. Dunne said VA does not
have a payment system configured to handle such benefits, which is why
it is turning to the private sector for help, adding that VA is
preparing backup plans in case the contractor is not ready by 1 AUG.
Akaka said outsourcing benefits on a permanent basis would be
ill-advised and hopes VA plans to cancel the contract as soon as it
can. But Burr said he is comfortable with using outside companies to
process claims; he said his own experience in helping constituents
showed that government payment systems are far from error-free. [Source:

GI BILL UPDATE 30: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announced
today that it will rely upon its own workforce to set up the information
technology programs needed to implement the educational benefits of the
new Post-9/11 GI Bill. The Department&apos;s announcement came after VA
officials did not receive enough proposals from qualified private-sector
contractors to create an information technology program that implements
the new benefit. At no time did VA consider contracting out
responsibility for actually administering this educational assistance.&quot;Many private contractors were apparently reluctant to offer proposals
because of external misconceptions as to the scope of the work involved.
While it is unfortunate that we will not have the technical expertise
from the private sector available to assist us in developing the
information technology solution, the VA can and will deliver the
benefits program on time,&quot;said Secretary of Veterans Affairs Dr. James
B. Peake. Patrick W. Dunne, the Under Secretary for Benefits said,&quot;The
Post-9/11 GI Bill is unusually complex, with payments being tailored to
tuition costs and going to both students and educational institutions.
Some benefits are determined by a school&apos;s zip code, and others by
in-state rates for tuition.&quot;Dunne said the Department would have been
remiss if it had failed to assess the ability of the private sector to
assist VA to set up the technology aspects of the program&apos;s
implementation. The Post-9/11 GI Bill will provide educational
assistance to veterans, military members, reservists and National Guard
members who have served since Sept. 11, 2001. By law, the new benefits
are scheduled to start on Aug. 1, 2009. [VA News Release 10 Oct 08++]


DOD DISABILITY EVALUATION SYSTEM UPDATE 11: In JAN 08 Congress
ordered the Pentagon to drop its disability ratings rules and strictly
follow the VAs criteria in assigning ratings to injured and wounded
service members. In March, the Army said it would comply. All the other
services were to follow suit. The change in law was among the most
significant changes to emerge in the wake of 2007s Walter Reed
scandal. Veterans groups hailed the change, having complained for years
that the military had shortchanged wounded combat veterans on their
disability ratings and compensation. But seven months later, the Army
still isnt living up to its promise, at least not when it comes to
assessing troops suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. The VA
ratings schedule says PTSD sufferers should receive a minimum 50%
disability rating from the rating agency and then be reassessed within
six months to determine if the initial evaluation should be changed for
the longer term. But a number of soldiers suffering from PTSD have been
given disability ratings of just 10%, and then separated from service
without the required follow-up assessment. Worse, the Pentagon seems to
be gearing up for a broader policy change that would take this approach
to PTSD across all the armed services, according to veterans advocates.

 This should hardly come as a surprise  it is just the latest in a
string of unconscionable decisions coming from the office of Pentagon
personnel chief David Chu. This is the same executive who sought to cut
combat pay for troops in the war zones and once proposed shunting off
the Defense Departments obligations for military retirees onto the VA.
Over the past three years, he has advocated doubling and tripling some
of the health care fees paid by many military retirees. And just a few
weeks ago, Chu narrowed the definition of combat related to reduce the
number of disabled troops who might benefit under another provision of
the 2008 Defense Authorization Act, which says some disabled troops do
not have to return any severance pay they receive from the military
before they can draw disability payments from VA. Chus definition of
combat related is significantly narrower than the one already in use to
determine eligibility for a separate program for disabled retirees
called Combat Related Special Compensation.

 Lawmakers had assumed defense officials would use the definition
already in place and were stunned to find a new and narrower
interpretation. Indeed, Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., already has drafted an
amendment to the pending 2009 defense authorization bill directing the
Pentagon to use the more generous definition of combat related for both
programs. A similar retroactive correction is needed to force the
Pentagon to live up to its legal responsibilities regarding the
assignment of disability ratings for all medical conditions  including
PTSD. A central theme coming out of the Walter Reed hearings was the
need to get the Defense Department and VA to share a single government
standard in assessing disabilities. Congress intent was to make the VA
standard apply across the board. The Pentagon needs to comply with that
direction. [Source: ArmyTimes Editorial 17 Sep 08++]


SOCIAL SECURITY FUND DEPLETION UPDATE 07: Our Social Security system,
enacted in 1935, has certainly withstood the test of time. Having paid
benefits to over 100 million retired and disabled workers and their
families, Social Security has indisputably had a positive impact on our
society. Its also indisputable, however, that the system has required
occasional adjustments to continue functioning well. The last time was
in 1983, following a period of slow economic growth and very high
inflation that had drained the trust fund. Without the 1983 legislation,
timely benefit payments could not have been made starting in JUL 83. The
law was changed in April, and just in time. According to Social
Securitys 2008 trustees report, released in March, the program wont
face a 1983-type crisis for many years, but the programs cash flow is
projected to move into the red in 2017, the first of several critical
dates cited by the trustees. While reasonable people can debate the
significance of 2017 or even 2041 (the projected date of trust fund
exhaustion), the underlying financial picture is not in dispute. Social
Security needs a course correction to continue fulfilling its mission.

 Some people believe that concerns about Social Securitys financial
soundness are entirely attributable to the baby boomers, who began
claiming Social Security retirement benefits just this year, with
millions more to come over the next two decades. But the baby boomers
are only part of the problem  and a temporary part. Long after all the
baby boomers have departed, Social Securitys income will cover only
about three-fourths of its cost. This permanent imbalance is partly
attributable to increasing longevity. As beneficiaries live longer,
their total expected benefits increases. Without action, Social
Securitys income wont keep pace with these ever-increasing benefit
obligations. Social Securitys retirement age is part of the problem.
While Social Securitys financial soundness could be restored in many
different ways, the American Academy of Actuaries (AAA) believe that any
solution package should include increases in the retirement age. The
Social Security Amendments of 1983 raised the normal retirement age from
65 to 67 over three decades. But its frozen at 67 for all workers born
after 1959. We shouldnt stop there. Holding the retirement age constant
is a certain prescription for future financial problems. Raising it to
reflect increasing longevity would contribute to solving those problems.
The AAA believes that a financially sound Social Security system must
accommodate future increases in longevity. The most direct way to do
that would be to extend the currently scheduled increases min Social
Securitys retirement age. The time to enact this change is now.

 Public policymakers sometimes wait until the last minute to take
necessary action. But in the case of Social Security, waiting will limit
the available options  and tend to force solutions that emphasize
sudden changes that are more likely to involve tax increases. The last
two times Congress made significant changes to Social Security, in 1977
and 1983, the legislation included near-term and long-term provisions
involving both tax increases and reductions in the growth of benefits.
Regardless of the kinds of changes ultimately enacted into law, the
sooner policymakers act, the more options they will have. Tax increases
could be phased in more gradually, and reductions in benefit growth
could be spread across a much larger population of beneficiaries, making
individual reductions relatively smaller and less painful. Enacting
legislation sooner would also allow individuals sufficient time to
modify their own financial planning  adjusting to changes in Social
Security. The AAA points out that delay will only make the changes
ultimately needed to restore Social Securitys financial soundness less
attractive, more painful and more precipitous. Timely action can make
the solutions more acceptable to all concerned. The Academy is committed
to continuing its thought leadership in this area and stands ready to
assist policymakers in their efforts to return the Social Security
program to long term financial soundness. For more information, contact

CREDIT CARD LATE FEES: If you think that using your credit card is
costing you more lately, youre probably right. The credit card late
fees that credit card companies charge when you pay your bill past the
due date nearly tripled between 1994 and 2004, according to Money
magazine. During those same years, credit card company revenues declined
due to competition and financial markets that favored consumers, which
forced many companies to lower their interest rates. To compensate,
credit card companies found creative ways to increase other charges.
Among the worst are credit card late fees, because in addition to the
charge itself:
 You could end up with a punitive increase in your interest rate.
 You could receive a demerit on your credit report that may affect your
other accounts.

Many companies now use a tiered penalty system that is based on your
monthly balance, so the more you owe, the bigger the late fee if your
credit card payment is late. In 1994, the average credit card late fee
was $12.55. By 2004, the average credit card late fee had risen to
$32.65. And on top of that, your credit card company may exact further
punishment by jacking up your interest rate as high as 41%. Sometimes
hidden in the fine print of your credit-card agreement is a feature
called&quot;universal default,&quot;which allows your credit card company to
raise your interest rate even if you pay your bill on time. Heres how
universal default works: if you are late with a payment to any creditor,
other creditors whose agreements with you include a universal default
clause can increase your interest rate even if your record with them is
perfect. Meanwhile, the credit card companies have made it harder for
you to avoid making late payments by steadily reducing the length of
traditional grace periods. In 1994, the average grace period for credit
card bills was 27 days. By 2004, that figure had shrunk to 20 days.

CREDIT CARD LATE FEES UPDATE 01: Credit card companies may be
advertise lower interest rates to lure new customers, but over the past
decade credit card fees have nearly tripled. These six tips can help you
save money on your credit cards by avoiding credit card late fees.
1. Pay your bills twice monthly - With grace periods shrinking,
scheduling two bill-paying sessions every month can help you stay ahead
of the game. Also, request a due date that is easy to remember and works
well with when you get paid and the due dates on your other bills
2. Automate your payment - An automatic payment will help you avoid
credit card late fees by making sure your payments are always on time.
Be sure to designate a monthly amount that will cover your minimum
payment and pay down a part of the principal. If you only pay the
minimum payment each month, you will never get rid of the debt.
3. Pay by Phone - If you usually send your credit-card company a check
by mail, consider paying by phone if your due date is getting close.
Although some credit-card companies charge a fee for payments made by
phone, typically $15 or less, thats usually cheaper than paying the
credit card late fee.
4. Talk to Your Credit-Card Company - If youre charged a credit card
late fee by your credit card company, but you usually pay on time, call
and complain. Many credit companies will waive credit card late fees at
least once for customers with good payment records.
5. Read the Fine Print - Checking out all of the conditions and
restrictions associated with your card will help you avoid credit card
late fees. In particular, find out if your credit card is subject to&quot;universal default&quot;. If it is, consider switching to a card that doesnt
have a universal default clause as part of its agreement.
6. Add Up the Cost and Resolve to Be Debt-Free - Sometimes when people
get in a cycle of late payments, they stop thinking about the extra
cost. If you often pay credit card late fees, add up how much those fees
cost you in a year. You may be surprised at how much money you could put
into savings if you weren&apos;t giving it away to credit card and other
finance companies for late fees. The best way to avoid credit card late
fees and other credit card charges is to pay off your balance every
month, and to make sure the payment is on time. That may be easier said
than done, but living debt-free is a worthwhile goal you can achieve
with careful planning, patience, and consistent effort.

VA CLOTHING ALLOWANCE: In accordance with PL 110-111Veterans, who
because of a service-connected disability, wear or use a prosthetic or
orthopedic appliance (including a wheelchair) which tends to wear out or
tear clothing, and veterans, who because of a service-connected skin
condition use a medication that causes irreparable damage to outer
garments, are eligible for payment of an annual clothing allowance. The
allowance as of 1 DEC 07 for 2008 was $677 per year. It is recommended
that you mark your calendar and apply for your 2009 allowance by 1 JUN
09 to allow ample time for VA to process it and avoid missing the 1 AUG
cutoff date. To qualify for annual payment, eligibility must be
established as of 1 AUG of the year for which payment is claimed.
1. Qualifying appliances would include an artificial limb, rigid
extremity brace, rigid spinal or cervical brace, wheelchair, crutches or
other appliance prescribed for the claimants service-connected
disability. Soft and flexible devices, such as an elastic stocking are
not included.
2. Qualifying medications would include any medication, prescribed by a
physician for a service-connected skin condition, which causes permanent
stains or otherwise damages the veterans clothing.

If you have previously submitted a claim for disability compensation,
send your application on VA FORM
21-8678 May 03 to the Prosthetic and Sensory Aids Service (121), at your
local VA Medical Center. If you have not made application for disability
compensation, send the form to the VA regional office nearest your home.
The form can be downloaded from www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/21-8678.pdf,
you can ask VA to send you one, or you can pick one up at your VA
clinic. If your support device wasn&apos;t issued by VA, you will need to get
your VA doctor to do a certification for you that the support is
necessary for you. [Source: VFW Post 11447&amp;www.va.gov Sep 08++]

HAVE YOU HEARD: A farmer&apos;s three daughters leave one night for dates
with their new boyfriends, one an Airman, the other a Soldier, and the
third a Sailor. The girls all bring their dates home that night, and
the next morning, the farmer wakes up bright and early at 05:30 to cook
breakfast and meet the boys his daughters have brought home.

- The Marine comes down at 5:45, clean, pressed, and spit-shined, eats
two eggs, an apple, and a glass of milk, says,&quot;Thank you for breakfast,
sir&quot;, and leaves.
- The Airman comes down looking fairly squared-away at 06:30, eats three
eggs, two slices of bacon, two pieces of toast, and has a glass of
orange juice. He says,&quot;Thanks for the chow&quot;and walks out the front
door.
- At 10:00, the farmer gets tired of sitting inside, so heads to the
back yard to do some chores, when the Sailor comes dashing out of the
house, dress white top stained, neckerchief missing, one shoe in one
hand and a scorched old cup of coffee in the other, and yells&quot;Later!&quot;on his way out of the yard and down the street.
His daughters come down a short time later, and he asks them all for
accounts of their evenings. The girl who&apos;d been out with the Airman
says,&quot;He was a perfect gentleman. He bought me dinner and a couple of
drinks, gave me a hundred dollars to buy myself something nice, and
retired at 22:00 to the spare bedroom to sleep&quot;. The girl who&apos;d been
out with the Soldier said,&quot;He was a nice guy, we each paid for our own
meals, and he tried to sneak a kiss off me. He was sort of drunk, so I
let him sleep in my bed, while I took the floor, but, he did give me
fifty dollars to buy myself something nice&quot;. The third daughter,
looking ragged and worn down, talking about her date with the Sailor,
says,&quot;That asshole! He came over last night smelling like booze, and
finished a bottle of whiskey he&apos;d brought with him. He passed out on my
bed last night after repeatedly trying to get my pants off, and this
morning he borrowed a hundred bucks &apos;til payday.&quot;VETERAN LEGISLATION STATUS 13 OCT 08: Refer to the Bulletins House&amp;Senate attachments for or a listing of Congressional bills of interest
to the veteran community that have been introduced in the 110th
Congress. Support of these bills through cosponsorship by other
legislators is critical if they are ever going to move through the
legislative process for a floor vote to become law. A good indication
on that likelihood is the number of cosponsors who have signed onto the
bill. A cosponsor is a member of Congress who has joined one or more
other members in his/her chamber (i.e. House or Senate) to sponsor a
bill or amendment. The member who introduces the bill is considered the
sponsor. Members subsequently signing on are called cosponsors. Any
number of members may cosponsor a bill in the House or Senate. At http://thomas.loc.gov you can also review a copy of each bills content,
determine its current status, the committee it has been assigned to, and
if your legislator is a sponsor or cosponsor of it. To determine what
bills, amendments your representative has sponsored, cosponsored, or
dropped sponsorship on refer to http://thomas.loc.gov/bss/d110/sponlst.html. The key to increasing
cosponsorship on veteran related bills and subsequent passage into law
is letting our representatives know of veterans feelings on issues. At
the end of some listed bills is a web link that can be used to do that.
You can also reach his/her Washington via the Capital Operator direct at
 (866) 272-6622, (800) 828-0498, or (866) 340-9281 to express your
views. Otherwise, you can locate on http://thomas.loc.gov who your
representative is and his/her phone number, mailing address, or
email/website to communicate with a message or letter of your own
making. Refer to http://www.thecapitol.net/FAQ/cong_schedule.html for
future times that you can access your representatives on their home
turf. [Source: RAO Bulletin Attachment 13 Oct 08++]

Editors Note: This is provided for anyone considering replacing their
computer and/or avoiding the problems I have encountered up to this
time. It is also an update on the RAOs ability to continue publishing
the Bulletin:

 As noted in my 1 OCT message there was no 1 OCT Bulletin due to my
HP computers failure. I took it to Best Buy to determine the problem
and they sent it to HP promising to have the problem identified and the
estimated cost for repair back to me in 3-4 days. After 7 days of me
calling them I was told the motherboard in my $2000 laptop was bad and
it would cost $872 to repair it. Also, my one year manufacturers
warranty was no good because I took it in for repair one year and one
day after I purchased it and regardless the manufacturers warranty was
only good in the country in which I purchased it (i.e. Philippines). I
declined the repair and requested they expedite the return of the
computer. This took another 5 days vice the 2 days they said. I was
able to establish they had not sent it to the HP manufacture but instead
sent it to one of their Best Buy local shops which had a HP
representative in it. Thus, they refunded $45 of the $85 I paid to have
it evaluated. I received about 500 messages from subscribers with
recommendations on how to proceed.

- Most advised not replacing my XP system with VISTA. I decided VISTA
is inevitable and continuing to avoid it will only lead to problems in
the future. I had XP installed in my last VISTA computer and although I
was eventually operational it lead to many problems. Plus I was not
able to burn a recovery CD because of the bastardized XP installation on
top of VISTA.
- Many relayed various methods of obtaining my lost files. My external
hard drive had most of my Word files but none of the 9000 Outlook files
nor my Eudora address book data. These are buried somewhere in my hard
drive.
- Many offered some form of reimbursement for my cost in restoring
things. I appreciate the offers but it is the RAO/Bulletins policy not
to accept donations.
- Many suggested I use a Desktop vice a Laptop because of the heat
problems that, in my opinion, caused the failure. That is not realistic
because I travel between the U.S. and the R.P and need the capability of
putting out the Bulletin from either location. Also, I find there does
not seem to be a heating problem in my new HP laptop with has double the
RAM and greater processing speed.
- About 50 of the messages advised against dealing with Best Buy for
various reasons. These I took to heart and switched to Circuit City.

After some consternation I decided to buy a new HP Pavilion dv1000us 4GB
RAM 15.4 screen unit with a 3 year warranty for $1285. This is a very
nice computer. Since I was not provided with MS CDs when I purchased my
last computer I also bought a special military edition of MS 2007 Office
Standard with Word/Excel/PowerPoint/Outlook for $79 at the March AFB BX
to install vice the $300 Best Buy/Circuit City wanted. This is good for
downloads to 3 computers and is still in stock if anybody wants to pick
one up. I had Circuit City transfer my old hard drive data to the new
computer. That night I discovered the new computers hard drive was
defective. The next day they replaced it with another new computer and
downloaded everything into it. I took it back a second time and they
were able to locate and download 8000 of my 9000 missing outlook files.
 I then decided to install the Norton 360 Version 2.0 Upgrade/PC
Jumpstart Service online. Big mistake. For $139 I allowed them to take
control of my computer online and they did the installation along with
cleaning up whatever was in my hard drive that was making VISTA so slow
for Word use. After they were done Word under VISTA was almost as fast
as under XP. However, in the process they deleted all my Eudora email
addee files with the add/delete/COA changes I had installed over the
last 2 weeks. When I called them back I went through 4 layers of
technicians who were unable to restore this data. However, in the
process they took my hard drive back to what was in my data base after
they installed Norton but before they cleaned things up. This resulted
in a 3-4 seconds delay after typing something in before I could shift my
cursor to another line item or function. Because of the weekend and
Canadas Thanksgiving holiday (Nortons location) on the 13th, I had to
wait for a callback from a 5th level tech to proceed with locating the
missing data and resolve the VISTA speed issue. Murphy took over with
the brush fire in Riverside CA which burned my TWC servers fiber optic
lines and keep me offline for another 3 days. Upon attempting to
reactivate neither my modem nor my wireless would operate. This led to
15 hours of telephone troubleshooting by Norton (Canada), HP
(Philippines), and the states which included one conference call.
Finally on the afternoon of the 16th I was able to return online and
proceed with putting out this Bulletin. Fortunately I was able to put it
together before Norton got involved. [10/14/08]

NNS081017-04. SECNAV Speaks on Marine Terminal, Encroachment

By Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Christal A. Ferris, Navy
Region Southwest Public Affairs

SAN DIEGO (NNS) -- Secretary of the Navy Donald C. Winter addressed the
Fleet Week Foundation, the San Diego Military Advisory Council, and
community leaders including San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders, and Coronado
Mayor Tom Smisek in San Diego during the Fleet Week Foundation&apos;s annual
breakfast Oct. 15.

Winter discussed key national defense issues, both overseas and within
the United States, including the prominent role played by San Diego
bases and the associated military support capacity in the area. In
particular, he raised concerns over a wide range of encroachment issues
and the extent to which the Navy Department is less able to be flexible
than in the past regarding land use issues.

In trying to reach a balance between domestic pressures and Navy and
Marine Corps requirements to train, the Secretary talked about the
culture of national service.&quot;It&apos;s difficult because in many cases it comes from a domain of
sacrifice and commitment and giving to our nation, to a situation of
interests that are more self-serving and more focused on what&apos;s of
interest to individuals as opposed what&apos;s giving to our nation at large.&quot;&quot;Contention over land use has become increasingly important,&quot;he said.&quot;I try to remind people that through the BRAC (Base Realignment and
Closure) process we have worked to try to limit our number of bases
across the United States,&quot;noted Winter. He further explained that with
fewer facilities nationwide the Navy Department must guard the existing
ability to train and prepare for military operations.

Winter particularly noted his concern surrounding the proposed
redevelopment of the Tenth Avenue Marine Terminal, a San Diego facility
that routinely handles both military and military-related hardware under
secure conditions.&quot;While this is not directly a Navy-owned facility, it is very clearly in
direct support of Navy and other military operations here on the West
Coast,&quot;he said.&quot;Not only does it support our direct shipments
overseas, but it also supports our defense industry partners in San
Diego. We do a lot of ship building and ship repair activities here. We
need to be able to offload and unload heavy items from ships.&quot;&quot;It&apos;s beyond me why at this time with all the economic crises that exist
here why put at risk an industry that represents a little over 25
percent of the economy of San Diego County. Personal objectives and
interests associated with those who have other agendas...are at odds
with what the macro-economic interests of the region as well as the
interests of the Navy and Marine Corps in our interest in providing for
the national defense,&quot;he stated.

According to Winter, the terminal is vital to West Coast Navy and Marine
Corps operations as more than 50 percent of military support from the
West Coast to the Middle East alone passes through the terminal.

He also cited Marine Corps Air Station Miramar as an example of a base
subject to recent encroachment pressures.&quot;We need to maintain the operations at Miramar as a Marine Corps Air
Station, as a major training and operations area to be able to sustain
the activities here,&quot;Winter said.

Further magnifying the importance of San Diego as the principal fleet
concentration center for the West Coast, Winter reaffirmed the Navy&apos;s
long-term commitment to the movement of more naval assets to San Diego
including a third carrier, littoral combat ships and other forces.

Winter also extolled the natural attributes of the harbor, proximity of
at-sea and ashore training ranges, an ideal environment to conduct
marine maintenance and the strong support of the local community as
reasons why the military infrastructure in the San Diego region is so
important.

Turning his attention to personnel issues, Winter spoke about the Navy&apos;s
role in Iraq and Afghanistan and the new Global Support Assignment (GSA)
detailing system.&quot;GSA detailing is intended to try and regularize the process so we&apos;re
not taking Sailors out of sequence, which affects their families and
their commands. It enables us to structure the support of the Navy
families,&quot;he added.

The Navy has been supporting OIF through the individual augmentee
assignment, but Winter highlighted the shift to the GSA process and
other related process changes.

While the Navy&apos;s role in OIF is a top priority, Winter reminded the
group that service members and their families remain number one on the
list.&quot;It&apos;s important to remind our men and women in uniform that they are
appreciated,&quot;he said.&quot;Being able to provide a comfortable living
arrangement for families is absolutely critical.&quot;The Navy currently has
more than 60,000 Sailors deployed around the world.

After his address at the Fleet Week breakfast, Winter visited the
littoral combat ship training center in San Diego, engaged Marines
involved in firefighting efforts at Camp Pendleton and wrapped up the
single day visit at Naval Medical Center San Diego&apos;s facilities for
wounded military personnel and their families.

NNS081017-15. CNO Participates in Seapower Symposium in Italy

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SW) Rebekah Blowers, Chief
of Naval Operations Public Affairs

VENICE, Italy (NNS) -- The Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) participated
in the 7th Regional Seapower Symposium for the Mediterranean and Black
Sea Countries Oct. 15-17 in Venice.

The symposium&apos;s theme of&quot;Navies Promoting Dialogue&amp;Cooperation in a
Comprehensive Perspective,&quot;is similar to the maritime strategy with its
emphasis on the importance of enhancing cooperation and building
partnerships with maritime partners.&quot;The main issues that we discuss when we come together at the Regional
Seapower Symposium, as well as other symposia such as this, is to look
at ways for increased cooperation and also to be able to share
information,&quot;said Adm. Gary Roughead, the U.S. Navy&apos;s CNO.

Roughead said the symposium allows maritime chiefs to discuss ways
navies and maritime organizations of the world can work more closely
together and share information that makes that cooperation more effective.&quot;The safety and security on the world&apos;s oceans allow for the prosperity
of all of our countries. By working together, there is great benefit to
our citizens, wherever we may live,&quot;the CNO said.

Roughead interacted with leaders from nearly 40 countries in the region
including members of NATO and other world and regional agencies. He
stressed that capacity is what gives navies the ability to be forward,
the ability to respond rapidly with credible combat power.&quot;I think it is important ... that military leaders are able to come
together to talk about things and have opportunities for discussion. The
hospitality of the Italian Navy has created an atmosphere that makes it
very easy for the discussions to take place and for the conversations to
take place. The tone or the atmosphere of the conference is one that is
very positive and very cooperative,&quot;said Roughead.

During his remarks to the international maritime leaders, CNO discussed
several examples of the cooperation among all the countries, including
their participation in joint training exercises at sea and information
and personnel exchanges. He said whether it is maritime security
operations, information sharing or combat operations, he strives to
ensure the Navy&apos;s systems can work in concert with those of our friends,
partners and allies.

NNS081017-02. Pilots Provide Mentorship, Inspiration to Tuskegee Youth

By Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class (SW/AW) Chris Fahey, Naval
Air Forces Public Affairs

TUSKEGEE, Ala. (NNS) -- A group of Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force
pilots spoke to more than 400 8th-12th graders from Booker T. Washington
High School and Tuskegee Middle School in Tuskegee, Ala., Oct. 9, on the
benefits of careers as military aviators.

The visit was part of naval aviation&apos;s outreach efforts to support
recruiting in diverse communities.&quot;About 10 percent of my senior class may come to me and ask questions
about what&apos;s out there in the military,&quot;said Booker T. Washington
Principal Mason McDade Jr.,&quot;but because they have such limited
[information], they don&apos;t really know anything.&quot;Traveling from school to school, the pilots shared personal stories of
achievement and emphasized the value of setting and reaching goals.&quot;The assembly was amazing,&quot;said Booker T. Washington senior Steven
Gaillard, president of the student government association.&quot;Until today,
I wouldn&apos;t say the military was something I wanted to be a part of. I
don&apos;t like the idea of violence and guns, and that&apos;s what I always
thought of when I&apos;d think about the military. Today, I saw something
different  It definitely made me re-think my options.&quot;According to Macon County Public School System Superintendent Dr.
Gwendolyn T. Moore, students would benefit from more first-hand
mentoring by active-duty military members.&quot;Inside these halls are the future leaders of America,&quot;said Moore.&quot;The
talent is there; they just need to be shown all available options so
each student can live up to their potential.&quot;Approximately 50 percent of all Booker T. Washington graduates will be
unable to attend college due to financial or academic hardships, said
McDade.&quot;The Navy could be an outstanding opportunity for some of these
students,&quot;said McDade.&quot;The careers, education, training and leadership
skills learned through military service could place these students on a
road to success.&quot;For more news from Commander, Naval Air Forces, visit

NNS081017-14. U.S., Italian Ties Strengthened Aboard Submarine During
Great White Fleet Festivities

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Riza Caparros, Fleet Public
Affairs Center Atlantic

NEW YORK (NNS) -- The commander of the U.S. 2nd Fleet visited the
Italian submarine ITS Salvatore Todaro (S 526) Oct. 11 while the U212A
class submarine was in New York City as part of Columbus Day celebrations.

During his visit, Vice Adm. Mel Williams Jr., met with Vice Adm.
Guiseppe Lertora, Commander and Chief of the Italian Fleet; and Todaro
Commanding Officer, Lt. Cmdr. Mauro Penebianco. He also toured the
vessel&apos;s combat information center, fuel cell room, diesel engine room
and propeller motor engine room where he interacted with the crew of the
vessel.&quot;Touring the Todaro was a great experience,&quot;said Williams,&quot;and it is
always a pleasure to work with our key allies. Together we help to make
our navies more ready to face anti-submarine contingencies and
strengthen our anti-submarine warfare capabilities.&quot;Todaro is deployed from its homeport of Taranto, Italy, and has visited
several U.S. ports including Mayport, Fla., Norfolk and Groton, Conn.
New York City is the submarine&apos;s last stop before leaving the United
States. An Italian submarine had not crossed the Atlantic Ocean since
World War II.&quot;We had a great experience working with the United States Navy, said
Lertora.&quot;The training at sea was most helpful to my Sailors, and they
have enjoyed this friendly exchange.&quot;&quot;We are really proud and grateful to the U.S. Navy,&quot;added Lertora.

Both Williams and Lertora spoke of the significance of the Italian and
U.S. navies working together.&quot;Regardless of the language difference, I can see in the eyes of the
Sailors of both nations, they are dedicated to serving their nation,
they are dedicated to serving with coalition forces,&quot;said Williams.&quot;It&apos;s a distinct honor to be here today as we celebrate our Navy&apos;s Great
White Fleet as well as celebrating the contributions of Christopher
Columbus.&quot;Together we highlight the friendship between our nations,&quot;Williams
continued.&quot;It is very important to foster these relations,&quot;said Lertora,&quot;shoulder-to-shoulder for our maritime security.&quot;The 100th anniversary of Theodore Roosevelt&apos;s Great White Fleet,
honoring the tradition of cooperation with other nations, coincides with
the 2008 Columbus Celebration in New York.

NNS081017-13. &apos;Gold Eagle&apos; Sailor Awarded for Money-Saving Program

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Kristan Robertson, USS Carl
Vinson Public Affairs

NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (NNS) -- A USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) Sailor was
recently selected for the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Monthly Gold
Disc Award for his work on a circuit card repair program that saved the
Navy thousands of dollars.

Electronics Technician (ET) 3rd Class (SW) Harry Moody of the combat
systems CS-9 division was selected in August for the award, which
included a letter of commendation (LOC) and $500.

The program Moody created took around two weeks to complete but is
efficient enough to save the government thousands of dollars for each
circuit of a SA-2112s, a type of communication patching system for ships
that is also known informally as a&quot;Coke machine.&quot;Circuit cards can
come from a number of types of large and expensive shipboard equipment,
ranging from radar devices to communication equipment.&quot;It&apos;s a good feeling to have won the award, because I have the
satisfaction of knowing I&apos;m helping other shipmates around the fleet,&quot;said Moody.&quot;The program is now being used by people worldwide to test
their equipment and save tons of money.&quot;Moody&apos;s diagnostic program works by reading the&quot;signatures&quot;on
different components of the circuit cards and indicating which ones need
to be repaired or replaced.&quot;It was a lot of pressure, and I had to make sure I gave the right
signatures in the program,&quot;said Moody.&quot;A minimum of three cards have
to be successfully tested before you are even considered for the award.&quot;Moody successfully created the program with help of contractors that
work with shipboard communications in support of Space and Naval Warfare
Systems (SPAWAR) at St. Julien&apos;s Creek Annex in Portsmouth, Va.

Currently, Moody serves as an ET link maintenance technician aboard the&quot;Gold Eagle&quot;and is also a qualified 2M technician. He is also playing a
pivotal role on board in ensuring that all shipboard J-dial telephone
lines will be fully operational by December.&quot;Moody is an extremely hard worker and a valuable asset to the
division,&quot;said Chief Electronics Technician (SW/AW) Ray Hamburg.&quot;His
background with component level testing is saving the Navy thousands and
thousands of dollars. He really took a step out of his comfort zone to
create the circuit card program, and it definitely paid off.&quot;Carl Vinson is undergoing its scheduled refueling complex overhaul
(RCOH) at Northrop Grumman Newport News shipyard. The RCOH is an
extensive yard period that all Nimitz-class aircraft carriers go through
near the mid-point of their 50-year life cycle.

During RCOH Carl Vinson&apos;s nuclear fuel will be replenished and the
ship&apos;s services and infrastructure will be upgraded to make her the most
state-of-the-art aircraft carrier in the fleet and prepare for another
25 years or more of service.

NNS081016-34. Boxer Expeditionary Strike Group Completes First Stage of
Work Ups

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Jeff Hopkins, USS Boxer
Public Affairs

USS BOXER, At Sea (NNS) -- The ships and units of Boxer Expeditionary
Strike Group (BOXESG) completed their Expeditionary Strike Group
Integration (ESGINT) exercise off the coast of Southern California Oct. 16.

ESGINT was the first of three pre-deployment exercises for the strike
group in preparation for a deployment scheduled for early next year. The
exercise focused on strengthening the cooperation between the ships of
BOXESG and the Marines of the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit.&quot;This was the crawl stage in our preparations for deployment,&quot;said
Capt. Peter K. Dallman, BOXESG commander.&quot;Our goal was to work
[towards] certification at our next at-sea period which is our Composite
Training Unit Exercise, a period in which the Navy side of our group is
graded on a series of capabilities and then certified as ready to deploy.&quot;Throughout ESGINT, Boxer Sailors and more than 900 Marines from the 13th
MEU worked side-by-side through training exercises ranging from the
launch and recovery of aircraft and a simulated beach assault to
emergency response damage control exercises and mass casualty drills.

The exercise also provided the opportunity to test Boxer&apos;s coordination
and defense systems via a strait transit exercise, during which Boxer
coordinated with other BOXESG ships to steam in formation simulating
transiting through a narrow body of water such as the Strait of Hormuz.

ESGINT was not without its difficulties, Dallman said. Integration
through training was one of the biggest challenges during the exercise.&quot;The greatest challenge to BOXESG during this period was that it&apos;s the
first time we&apos;ve come together to operate in a composite warfare command
construct,&quot;Dallman said.&quot;And we are trying to defend ourselves at sea
from air, surface, and sub-surface attack while simultaneously learning
the intricacies of executing the Navy/Marine Corps team&apos;s missions.&quot;According to Col. David W. Coffman, commanding officer for the 13th MEU,
ESGINT was one of the first steps toward streamlining the joint
capabilities of Boxer Sailors and 13th MEU Marines for the upcoming
deployment.&quot;This exercise was the first step for Boxer Sailors and 13th MEU Marines
to get to know each other and work together,&quot;said Coffman.&quot;We have a
range of missions that we have to be able to execute coming off
amphibious shipping, so for the next three months, as we do these at-sea
periods, we&apos;ll be preparing and then certified to go to sea aboard the
BOXESG as a sea-based Marine Air/Ground Task Force (MAGTF) and deliver
mission capability to combatant commanders.&quot;Coffman highlighted the unique dimensions the 13th MEU brings to ESGINT.&quot;When we speak of the blue/green team, it&apos;s the embodiment of the naval
character of the Marine Corps. You aren&apos;t a Marine if you can&apos;t get
aboard ship, work with its Sailors, and then leave the ship for your
mission.&quot;Marine aviation and ground assets linked together under the control of
the common commander provide unique capability to the mission,&quot;Coffman
said.&quot;Our MAGTF combines air, ground, and logistic capability all
linked and working on a common coordinated mission.&quot;&quot;The Navy/Marine Corps team provides forward-deployed expeditionary
forces that are the most ready when the nation is least ready,&quot;Coffman
said.

Coffman added that in addition to testing and improving the capability
of shipboard and 13th MEU operational systems, the ESGINT mission also
mentally prepared the Marines for deployment by exposing them to the
culture of life at sea.&quot;For many of our Marines, this was their first time aboard a Navy ship,&quot;said Coffman.&quot;We&apos;re just taking the first steps toward making seagoing
Marines out of them. Many of the Marines serving don&apos;t get the
opportunity and privilege to serve aboard amphibious ships and get back
to the Navy/Marine Corps business we made famous during World War II and
since.&quot;Command sergeant major for the 13th MEU, Command Sgt. Maj. Enrique X.
Hines, echoed Coffman&apos;s assessment, and noted the exercise encourages
teamwork and respect between Marines and Sailors.&quot;ESGINT prepares Marines for deployment by integrating the Sailors and
Marines,&quot;said Hines.&quot;We gain a definite respect for one another. Some
Sailors have no idea what Marines do when they leave the ship, and
Marines get an appreciation of what it takes to run a vessel of this
size. And what I think the Marines will walk away with is a definite
sense of respect for our Navy brothers, and vice versa.&quot;Dallman said the exercise was a prime example of the capabilities of the
Navy/Marine Corps team, and that through the cooperation of BOXESG and
the 13th MEU, the strike group will be fully ready for deployment in the
new year.&quot;The Navy and Marine Corps team is an enormously capable and powerful
tool that&apos;s manifested in BOXESG and the 13th MEU working together at
sea to then go influence events ashore in a combined effort,&quot;said
Dallman.&quot;Across the board, [the strike group] has incredible
capabilities, and we&apos;ve tested many of them during this exercise. By the
time we deploy, we&apos;ll certainly be ready to accomplish our mission
together.&quot;BOXESG is scheduled for more training exercises this fall prior to a
deployment scheduled for early next year.

BOXESG is comprised of Amphibious Squadron 5, the 13th MEU, Boxer, USS
New Orleans (LPD 18), USS Comstock (LSD 45), USS Chung Hoon (DDG 93),
USCGC Boutwell (WHEC 719), USS Milius (DDG 69), USS Lake Champlain (CG
57), Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 21, Naval Beach Group 1, Assault
Craft Unit 5, Assault Craft Unit 1, Beach Master Unit 1, Fleet Surgical
Team 5.

The 13th MEU is comprised of Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 163
(Reinforced), Combat Logistics Battalion 13 and Battalion Landing Team 1/1.

NNS081017-07. NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic Officer Honored at the White House

By Robin Willis, Naval Facilities Engineering Command Mid-Atlantic
Public Affairs

NORFOLK (NNS) -- The President welcomed select Hispanic business and
community leaders from across the nation - including a naval officer -
to the White House for an invitation-only reception Oct. 9 in
celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month.

Lt. Leticia Soto, of Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC)
Mid-Atlantic, was honored at the White House reception as the recent
selectee of the 2008 Latina Style Distinguished Service Award for the
Navy. The award, recognizing her outstanding military service as
assistant public works officer for Naval Station Norfolk was presented
Sept. 5 at the Latina Style Magazine 5th Annual National Latina
Symposium in Washington.&quot;As one of six children born to immigrants from Mexico, I know well the
meaning of sacrifice,&quot;said Soto.&quot;I grew up watching my father work
16-hour days to give us the best he could. My father worked in the steel
mills of northwest Indiana to provide the American dream of an
economically stable life and higher education for our family.&quot;Soto offered these words as the keynote speaker at the Norfolk Hispanic
Heritage Celebration at Naval Station Norfolk Oct. 15 when she
highlighted its theme of&quot;Hispanic Americans&apos; commitment to service.&quot;&quot;I am proud of my heritage, and I believe that the faith and values my
parents instilled in me make me the Mexican-American I am today,&quot;she
said.&quot;It is this solid family foundation that gives many Hispanics the
drive and dedication to achieve their &apos;American dream.&apos; When I enlisted
in the Navy at 17, my family had some doubts, but I now have their
support and their blessings on my Navy career.&quot;Soto leaves for Iraq next month for a six-month individual augmentee
assignment.

Born and raised in Indiana, Soto began her career as a U.S. Navy Seabee
in the construction electrician rate. Accepted for an officer
commissioning program, she attended Purdue University and earned a
bachelor&apos;s degree in electrical engineering. She later attended the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and earned a master&apos;s degree in
systems engineering. She is a California engineer in training and is
preparing for her professional engineer license exam in the fall of
2008. Soto is also a member of the Society of Hispanic Professional
Engineers and the Society of American Military Engineers.

NNS081017-06. Sub Base Sailors Join Community to Serve Wounded Warrior

By Lena Blanch, Naval Submarine Base New London Public Affairs

WATERFORD, Conn. (NNS) -- Dozens of volunteers from Naval Submarine Base
New London and the Navy community of Southeastern Connecticut joined
organizers from Rebuilding Together Litchfield County in a Heroes at
Home project aimed at aiding an Army veteran Oct. 9.

Chris Strickland was serving as a U.S. Army Calvary Scout when his
Humvee struck a roadside bomb in Ramadi, Iraq, July 2006. Severely
injured, Strickland suffered a traumatic brain injury, vision impairment
and numerous shattered bones. He would ultimately lose his right arm
below the elbow.

Leaving active duty, Strickland returned to Connecticut where he lives
in Waterford with his wife, Mandy, and his soon-to-be year-old son,
Bradley. He works in Mystic for NAPA Auto Parts.

Often after a day at work on his feet, Strickland has to resort to a
wheelchair at home because the pain is so great from his injuries. The
wheelchair makes it difficult to navigate the 1950&apos;s-era ranch house and
help his wife care for their son.

So, when Strickland learned about Rebuilding Together, a national
nonprofit organization that rehabilitates houses for low-income
homeowners, particularly the elderly and those with disabilities, and
their new initiative with Sears and Kmart called Heroes at Home, he
called for help.

Heroes at Home not only answered Strickland&apos;s call, but with the goal of
improving the lives of U.S service members, veterans and families in
need by making necessary repairs, improvements and modifications to
their homes, they had members from Rebuilding Together at his house
within a week taking pictures and planning renovations.

Noting the close proximity of the Strickland home to Naval Submarine
Base New London, Rebuilding Together reached out to the Navy community
for assistance and was overwhelmed by the response.&quot;This project could not have been completed without the Navy,&quot;said
Peter Barhydt of Rebuilding Together Litchfield County.&quot;Navy Sailors,
Navy veterans, and Navy friends were the untiring manpower behind all
the work. Their heart, spirit and can-do was amazing.&quot;Sub Base Command Master Chief Ray Powell helped lead and organize the
squadron of Sailor volunteers.&quot;Sometimes a birthday can be more special in the giving, and as we
approached the Navy birthday this year, what a unique way to mark 233
years of service and excellence  helping give a local war hero a much
needed home makeover,&quot;said Powell.&quot;And, Team New London members were
happy to help. We had waterfront Sailors and members of wardrooms and
[chief petty officers] messes. We even had veterans and retirees like
retired HTC [Chief Hull Technician] Darin Parke.&quot;&quot;It&apos;s simply a matter of caring, of looking out for our fellow service
members and their families,&quot;explained Sub Base Commanding Officer Capt.
Mark Ginda who spent two days fully engaged in a number of projects at
the Strickland house.&quot;The Navy&apos;s on the ground, on the front lines, in
this global war on terrorism. We have individual augmentees from the
base in Iraq, shoulder-to-shoulder with Marine and Army counterparts.
Many facing the same dangers and challenges Chris faced. We&apos;re all in
this together.&quot;Strickland, whose step-father is a retired Navy Sailor, echoed the
sentiment.&quot;No matter what branch of the service,&quot;he noted.&quot;We are all family.&quot;Volunteering Sailors tackled a wide range of projects at the Strickland
house. The bathroom was remodeled to make it wheelchair accessible. The
basement was cleaned and painted and had a soft, spongy flooring
installed so that if Strickland falls while maneuvering down there he
would not injure himself on hard concrete. The screened in porch was
replaced, and entry steps were raised and modified to allow easier

extensive undertaking.

U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney of Connecticut joined Connecticut Commissioner of
Veterans Affairs, Dr. Linda Schwartz for the renovated house&apos;s&quot;unveiling,&quot;late Saturday morning.&quot;This is a special district I have,&quot;reflected Courtney.&quot;Volunteer
warriors coming to the aid of a wounded warrior. Our success as a nation
is really measured by how we treat our veterans.&quot;Throughout the project, Strickland remained the humble hero.&quot;I honestly never thought I deserved anything like this; I was just
doing my job like anyone else,&quot;said Strickland.

NNS081017-09. Boxer Sailors Train to Expand ESG Capability via Refueling
Evolution

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SW/AW) Jon Rasmussen, USS
Boxer (LHD 4) Public Affairs

USS BOXER, At Sea (NNS) -- USS Boxer&apos;s (LHD 4) Deck Department Sailors
carried out a rare evolution Oct. 15, as USS Chung-Hoon (DDG 93) pulled
alongside Boxer to receive fuel in an underway replenishment (UNREP) as
part of Boxer Expeditionary Strike Group&apos;s (BOXESG) integration exercise.

The UNREP provided a training opportunity for Sailors on both ships, but
was the first time most of Boxer&apos;s Deck Department Sailors have been on
the delivery side of a refueling rig.

Typically, the job of refueling ships in an ESG falls to a Military
Sealift Command supply ship, but having that capability within the
strike group extends the range and capabilities of the strike group as a
whole.&quot;Sometimes, the smaller ships in our ESG need fuel when an oiler isn&apos;t
in the area. When that happens, Boxer has the capability to send fuel
from the flight deck refueling station, allowing that ship to carry on
with its mission,&quot;said Senior Chief Boatswain&apos;s Mate (SW/AW/SCW)
Deondra Quarles, Boxer&apos;s deck department leading chief petty Officer.&quot;The last time we sent this rig was back in May of 2007, so this was a
really good experience for all the Sailors who have never seen it.&quot;Lacking real-world training opportunities, Boxer&apos;s deck department
coordinated with Naval Base San Diego to produce realistic training at
the pier for their Sailors. The training utilized two barges moored
side-by-side to simulate a ship receiving the refueling rig.&quot;In addition to being a good hands-on opportunity for a lot of our
Sailors to see an evolution like this in action, it was a chance for us
to make sure none of the rig components were kinked or tangled,&quot;explained Quarles.

Another link in the chain of success according to several members of the
deck department&apos;s senior leadership was Boatswain&apos;s Mate 1st Class
(SW/AW) Nicholas Broders who was the rig captain for the evolution. As
rig captain, Broders was in charge of directing the teams of Sailors
handling the lines, directing the winch operator who controls the fuel
rig and acting as the first line of safety for everyone on the refueling
station.&quot;This is great training because it&apos;s a rig we don&apos;t typically fly very
often, just being on the delivery side of an UNREP is good for
training,&quot;said Broders.&quot;Experienced or not, there always has to be
people who step up to meet the challenge, and everyone who was out there
on the rig with me definitely did step up, and that&apos;s why we were
successful.&quot;With some realistic training and successful real-world replenishment
under their belts, Broders and the rest of his department are confident
that they will be ready to answer the call if any of the BOXESG ships
need to top off to carry out their mission.

BOXESG is scheduled for more training exercises this fall prior to a
deployment scheduled for early next year.

BOXESG is comprised of Amphibious Squadron 5, the 13th Marine
Expeditionary Unit (MEU), USS Boxer (LHD 4), USS New Orleans (LPD 18),
USS Comstock (LSD 45), USS Chung-Hoon (DDG 93), USCGC Boutwell (WHEC
719), USS Milius (DDG 69), USS Lake Champlain (CG 57), Helicopter Sea
Combat Squadron 21, Naval Beach Group 1, Assault Craft Unit 5, Assault
Craft Unit 1, Beach Master Unit 1 and Fleet Surgical Team 5.

The 13th MEU is comprised of Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 163
(Reinforced), Combat Logistics Battalion 13 and Battalion Landing Team 1/1.

NNS081016-30. New UH-1Y Huey Takes Flight During Boxer ESG Exercise

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class (SW) Daniel Barker, USS Boxer
Public Affairs

USS BOXER, At Sea (NNS) -- Marine Medium Helicopter (HMM) Squadron 163
(Reinforced), embarked aboard USS Boxer (LHD 4), is among the first
squadrons to operate the new Bell UH-1Y&quot;Huey&quot;helicopter, which was
tested as part of the Boxer Expeditionary Strike Group (BOXESG)
integration exercise Oct. 7-16.

The most modern tactical utility helicopter available, the Huey is the
latest version of one of the Marine Corps&apos; most durable and versatile
helicopters, with many improvements on the previous UH-1N.&quot;This &apos;Yankee&apos; version of the classic UH-1 &apos;November&apos; is making the Huey
applicable to today&apos;s war,&quot;said Marine Capt. Tara Russell, an HMM 163
(Rein.)&quot;Evil Eyes&quot;pilot.&quot;Everything has been improved, from the lift
capability and flying time to situational awareness systems like a glass
cockpit with a moving map display.&quot;Boxer is the first ship to have the new helicopter aboard as part of its
rotary wing aircraft augmentation for deployment. With a new composite
four bladed rotor system, two powerful T700-GE 401C engines and
decreased maintenance requirements, it provides BOXESG a more advanced
ability to provide humanitarian aid or to take the fight to the enemy
wherever needed.&quot;With the resources to carry both personnel and a full arsenal of
weapons we have an expanded capability to support groups on the ground
and participate in a greater range of missions,&quot;said Marine Capt. Brian
Hensarling, an&quot;Evil Eyes&quot;pilot.

Upgraded features also include increased survivability from enemy attack
with a laser warning receiver, radar warning receiver,&quot;smart&quot;countermeasure dispenser and a missile warning device.

Improved safety systems include energy-absorbing landing gear, self
sealing fuel systems and a fuel vapor inerting system.&quot;The upgrades that are among the most beneficial for the crew and
passengers are the energy attenuating seats that reduce the effects of
G-forces in the event of a crash,&quot;said Russell.&quot;Before this, the
passengers just had to sit on the deck.&quot;The new Huey also features greater operational flexibility due to 50
percent increased range, faster maximum speed, a stronger airframe
design, advanced electronic warfare self protection and 125 percent
greater payload than the previous UH-1N.

The BOXESG is scheduled for more training exercises this fall prior to a
deployment scheduled for early next year.

BOXESG is comprised of Amphibious Squadron 5, the 13th Marine
Expeditionary Unit (MEU), Boxer, USS New Orleans (LPD 18), USS Comstock
(LSD 45), USS Chung-Hoon (DDG 93), USCGC Boutwell (WHEC 719), USS Milius
(DDG 69), USS Lake Champlain (CG 57), Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 21,
Naval Beach Group 1, Assault Craft Unit 5, Assault Craft Unit 1, Beach
Master Unit 1 and Fleet Surgical Team 5.

The 13th MEU is comprised of HMM 163 (Rein.), Combat Logistics Battalion
13 and Battalion Landing Team 1/1.

NNS081017-03. Health Services Helps Prep for Cert, Keeps CVN 70 Crew
Safe, Healthy

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Kristan Robertson, USS Carl
Vinson Public Affairs

NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (NNS) -- USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) Health Services team
is assisting engineering department this October in readying the
collection, holding and transfer (CHT) system for its Oct. 20
certification on board.

Because the CHT tanks hold waste products like waste oil, sewage and
aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) discharge and toxic gases, the threats
associated with an unsatisfactory system are avoided at all costs by
Carl Vinson personnel. Health services plays an integral role in keeping
Sailors safe and the systems up to standards by thoroughly screening
each Sailor for health problems and by conducting in-depth screenings of
the system&apos;s components.&quot;All system workers are assessed for any health problems before they are
assigned any CHT-related work, because we don&apos;t want any pre-existing
conditions to interfere with the work that must be performed,&quot;said
Senior Chief Hospital Corpsman (AW/SW) Sonia Edwards.&quot;If an illness or
other health problem prevents them from doing their work, it doesn&apos;t
only affect them, but the whole ship by potentially putting us behind
our production goals. We need healthy Sailors to meet our goals.&quot;To fully prepare for the upcoming certification, a preliminary
inspection has been scheduled for Oct. 9. Health services and
engineering are teaming up to ensure that the system not only meets
health standards for the crew, but exceeds them.&quot;We&apos;re conducting checks on everything from leaks in the system and
other components to personal protective equipment (PPE), health warning
plaques and ensuring that all training and records are up-to-date and
completely accurate,&quot;said Hospital Corpsman 1st Class (AW/SW) Jose
Belen.&quot;Crew members working with these systems won&apos;t have to worry,
because we&apos;re doing our part in eliminating risks and making sure they
remain safe at work.&quot;Now that the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier&apos;s Refueling Complex Overhaul
(RCOH) is entering its final phases, major shipboard systems like CHT
are returning to service in preparation for the&quot;Gold Eagle&apos;s&quot;imminent
return to sea. Carl Vinson Sailors shipwide have been working
around-the-clock to ensure the ship will be delivered to the fleet in
optimal condition for at-sea operations in defense of our nation and its
interests.&quot;The whole system has been re-vamped, we&apos;re keeping everybody safe, and
we&apos;re getting ready to head back out to the water soon,&quot;said Edwards.&quot;Medical readiness has to be at its optimal peak to help fulfill the
mission, and that&apos;s where it&apos;s going to be.&quot;For more news from USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70), visit

Pedro Campa, of Mira Loma, Calif.&quot;I had people pay for my meal and
coffee; it makes me feel proud to serve my country.&quot;&quot;I had a friend from the area show me around the city and visit some of
the local sites like Chinatown and Pier 39,&quot;added Aviation Electronics
Technician 3rd Class Samantha Hunter, a native of Midwest City, Okla.&quot;I
really like how nice and clean the city is and how beautiful the
architecture is. The people were also very supportive of Sailors.&quot;During the three-day port visit, Bonhomme Richard conducted ship tours
for the public. More than 4,000 visitors got a chance to visit the ship.&quot;My son enjoyed [the tour] very much as well as I,&quot;said Mauro Quilici.&quot;He is still talking about it, and says someday he will join the armed
forces in order to protect our country.&quot;Bonhomme Richard hosted tours for local Boy Scout troops, Navy Junior
Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) students from Silver Creek High
School in San Jose, Calif., and Marine JROTC students from Sacramento.&quot;Thanks for giving the students a first-hand look at what the Navy is
all about,&quot;said retired Master Chief Avionics Technician Willie Howell.&quot;I have been retired for about ten years now and I just want to say
&apos;thanks&apos; to all the Sailors for keeping us safe every day.&quot;&quot;We&apos;re grateful to the city of San Francisco for really rolling out the
red carpet for us during fleet week,&quot;said Bonhomme Richard&apos;s Commanding
Officer, Capt. Neil Parrott.&quot;Everyone we met, from those who visited
our ship to those we met out on liberty, were so appreciative of all of
us who serve. Likewise, we appreciated the opportunity for the public to
visit our ship and get to know this great crew, so they can see
first-hand the best the Navy has to offer.&quot;For more news from USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD 6), visit

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class (SW/AW) Jeffery J. Gabriel
Jr., USS Bonhomme Richard Public Affairs

SAN FRANCISCO (NNS) -- Sailors aboard USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD 6)
visited children at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)
Medical Center Oct. 13 during San Francisco Fleet Week.

During the community relations project (COMREL), Sailors visited
children of varying ages with physical disabilities and medical conditions.&quot;The COMREL was a great success for both the Sailors and the children we
visited,&quot;said Lt. Michael Foskett, command chaplain.&quot;The general
effect that we wanted to express was that Sailors care so much about
their fellow Americans that we are willing to spend their free time
helping them.&quot;Kevin C. Urda, volunteer and community service liaison for Child Life
Department said having the Sailors made a difference.&quot;Just seeing the smile that the Sailors brought to the faces of the
children, as well as their parents, made such an impact on the staff,&quot;said Urda.&quot;It also lets people know that Sailors are more than just
military heroes but also people who exemplify good character and moral.&quot;Sailors handed out autographed photos of Bonhomme Richard, played with
the children and talked to them about their hobbies and aspirations.&quot;The kids were pretty excited about having Sailors in uniform coming to
see them,&quot;said Foskett.&quot;They were also excited about the pictures of
the Bonhomme Richard.&quot;Aviation Boatswain&apos;s Mate (Fuels) Airman Darra Brown volunteered for the
event.&quot;I really wanted the children to know someone was thinking about them
and the staff to feel the support of our nation&apos;s military forces,&quot;said
Brown, a native of Oakland, Calif.&quot;A smile and a clean uniform actually
played a big part in that happening, especially when you throw in the
jokes and hugs.&quot;For more news from USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD 6), visit

NNS081016-32. Nassau Sailors Represent Fleet in Columbus Day Parade

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Riza Caparros, Fleet Public
Affairs Center Atlantic

NEW YORK (NNS) -- Sailors from the amphibious assault ship USS Nassau
(LHA 4) participated in the annual Columbus Day parade in New York City,

100th anniversary of President Theodore Roosevelt&apos;s Great White Fleet.

Aviation Boatswain&apos;s Mate 3rd Class (AW) Michelle Hernandez, one of the
45 Nassau Sailors marching in the parade, carried the ensign for the ship.&quot;I&apos;ve lived in New York for almost 10 years,&quot;said Hernandez.&quot;I&apos;m so
proud to march in front of my fellow New Yorkers as a United States Sailor.&quot;Sailors from Italian submarine ITS Salvatore Todaro (S 526) also marched
in the parade, demonstrating the strong alliance between the partnering
navies.&quot;We work very good together with our United States Navy friends,&quot;said
Vice Adm. Guiseppe Lertora, commander and chief of the Italian Fleet.&quot;Not only on the operational side, but also with the training and
maritime security. My fleet works shoulder-to-shoulder with the U.S.
fleet. We are very grateful for what America did with the Great White
Fleet for our country, so thank you to your Navy.&quot;Nassau&apos;s Command Master Chief (AW/SW) Stanley Kopiczak said he was very
proud to see the ship represented during the parade.&quot;My crew had a very challenging year,&quot;said Kopiczak.&quot;Being deployed
for most of the year and soon after coming home, we deployed again to
help the city of Galveston, Texas, after Hurricane Ike hit. My crew
worked hard, and I am so proud to see them marching in today&apos;s parade
representing our ship and our Navy.&quot;Italian-American New Yorker John Aramanno, a spectator at the parade,
said,&quot;I got chills as the Navy Sailors marched by, thinking about where
they&apos;ve been, where they might be going, and to see them here today,
marching and representing our country. It made me feel very proud, and
it makes me feel honored to be a citizen of this country.&quot;Aramanno also spoke about the Great White Fleet, and how grateful he and
his ancestors are for the Navy and all they had done for their native
country.&quot;The Navy is going above and beyond for us and it seems there are no
limits of what they are willing to do, for us and for our allies and our
friends across the world.&quot;Columbus Day honors the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Americas
in 1492. The day also celebrates Italian-American culture. New York City
has marked the day with a parade since 1929.

NNS081016-33. Gitmo Celebrates the Hispanic-American Culture

By Army Spc. Megan Burnham, Joint Task Force Guantanamo Public Affairs

GUANTANAMO BAY, Cuba (NNS) -- It was an evening of culture, dining and
dancing, Oct. 4, as U.S. Naval Station Guantanamo Bay&apos;s
Hispanic-American Heritage Association (HAHA) hosted its annual dinner
dance at the Windjammer Ballroom as part of National Hispanic American
Heritage Month.&quot;Hispanic Heritage Month is the period to recognize the contributions of
Hispanic-Americans to the U.S. and to celebrate Hispanic heritage and
culture,&quot;said Lydia Alvarez, HAHA vice president.

The celebration was first established in 1968, but only lasted for one
week. However, President Ronald Reagan expanded the observation to cover
a 31-day period, Sept. 15 to Oct. 15.

The month-long celebration begins on the anniversary of independence of
five Latin-American countries from Spain: Costa Rica, El Salvador,
Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua.

To celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month Gitmo-style, HAHA has been busy
hosting other events, to include a Latin Food Fiesta at the former U.S.
Naval Station Guantanamo Bay Commander Navy Capt. Mark M. Leary&apos;s house
and a silent auction that also included salsa dance lessons and taste
testing different Hispanic foods. An event called Kitchen Vacation was
also held that provided a family breakfast from Panama, lunch from
Puerto Rico, and dinner from Colombia.&quot;It&apos;s great that we get to share our culture with the entire community,&quot;said Doraima Alvarez, HAHA secretary.&quot;We hold a big part in the
American community as well, and they learn about our historical figures
that make us proud to be Hispanics.&quot;As guests arrived and handed in their tickets, their first sight of the
ballroom was a display table that included cultural clothing native to
Panama, Puerto Rico and Columbia, as well as arts and crafts, postcards
and biographical information on historical Latin-American figures.

During the social hour of the event, hors d&apos;oeuvres were offered that
gave guests insight on the type of foods made from different Hispanic
countries - potato cakes from Ecuador, an empanada recipe from Puerto
Rico and corn fritters from Panama.

A highlight of the evening was the speech given by guest speaker Army
Lt. Col. Doris J. Acevedo-Selpa, director for manpower, personnel and
administration at Joint Task Force Guantanamo.&quot;I value the opportunity to reaffirm the pride in our heritage which
contributes to the self-esteem of all Hispanic-Americans in Gitmo and
share with non-Hispanic Americans so that they have a better
understanding of our contributions to the nation,&quot;said Acevedo-Selpa,&quot;as well as to educate on diversity which is understanding and valuing
every person&apos;s different skills, talent and experience.&quot;The dancing followed a meal of mojito chicken, congri rice and black
beans and yuca. The first dance to be performed was the Cumbia, a
Colombian-style dance. Next was the Congo from Panama and the Bomba y
Plena from Puerto Rico. The final performance was a medley of dances, to
include the Bachata, the Reggaetón, the Merengue and Salsa.&quot;Some dancers had been practicing as far as two months back,&quot;said Lydia
Alvarez.&quot;Other dancers only practiced for two weeks.&quot;Door prizes were given throughout the night.&quot;We encourage everyone to join us at HAHA next year,&quot;said Lydia
Alvarez.&quot;We are planning to start again in February 2009 for another
successful Hispanic American Heritage Month.&quot;For more news from Joint Task Force Guantanamo, visit

NNS081017-05. Nation Honors Historic Tuskegee Pilot Training Field

By Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class (SW/AW) Chris Fahey, Naval
Air Forces Public Affairs

TUSKEGEE, Ala. (NNS) -- Thousands of veterans, active-duty and Reserve
military members, Navy pilots and state and federal officials visited
Tuskegee, Ala., Oct. 10 to celebrate the historic significance of the
birthplace of America&apos;s first black aviators - The Tuskegee Airmen&apos;s
Moton Field.

Moton Field served as grounds for the Tuskegee Airmen&apos;s primary flight
training throughout the 1940&apos;s and continued this function for decades
after the U.S. military&apos;s desegregation in the late 40&apos;s. It continues
to serve as a training venue for America&apos;s aviators as they learn to fly
above this historic setting.

According to Alabama Gov. Bob Riley, nearly 1,000 black aviators
completed the flight course at Tuskegee University and the U.S. Air
Corps Base between 1941-45. These men became the&quot;famed, courageous&quot;Soldiers known as the Tuskegee Airmen.

Taking an appropriate center stage at the event were many of America&apos;s
original Tuskegee Airmen who were the first to train and fight out of
Moton Field in 1941. These men recounted stories of discrimination,
sacrifice, person battles against prejudicial government policies and
lives dedicated to pursuing careers in aviation.&quot;I spent nine months in Germany at a POW camp when I was shot down while
providing strafing fire for troops on the ground,&quot;said retired Army Lt.
Col. Alexander Jefferson, an original Tuskegee Airmen and one of five
known Tuskegee prisoners of war.&quot;The funny thing is, I was received and
treated better there than by my fellow Americans back home. I&apos;m telling
you, it was a different time.&quot;The airmen&apos;s stories also emphasized the need for today&apos;s armed services
to attract the most talented recruits, of all ethnic backgrounds.&quot;High school is too late,&quot;said Jefferson.&quot;We need the talent in the
service, and these individuals should be provided with awareness and the
incentive of what they could achieve in the military. There must be a
national understanding of this importance.&quot;According to Air Force Major Gen. Harold Mitchell, the military&apos;s most
valuable asset is its people, and the services should not disregard any
sources of talent simply because of the color of their skin.&quot;We can&apos;t afford as a nation to place barriers between us and our
workforce,&quot;said Mitchell.&quot;For us to reach our full potential, policy
makers need to make diversity a real issue and follow through with
proper execution. We&apos;ve come a long way; we&apos;ve made progress. The
challenge is ensuring we always keep pushing toward bettering our nation
and diversifying our service.&quot;For more news from Commander, Naval Air Forces, visit

NNS081016-35. Thousands Line Up For Boot Camp Challenge

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Leticia Fritzsche, Naval
Reserve Fleet Public Affairs Center San Diego

SAN DIEGO (NNS) -- More than 3,500 contestants volunteered to experience
what Marine Corps recruits must endure during the 7th annual Boot Camp
Challenge on Oct. 4 at historic Marine Corps Recruit Depot (MCRD) San
Diego.

Treacherous terrain featuring a three-mile obstacle run followed by
tunnel crawls, fox jumps, and cargo-netting were the order of the day.&quot;It was not what I expected; keeping the momentum going over the logs
and doing push-ups after running,&quot;said Ens. Arthur Lewis Cepf of USS
Pinckney (DDG-91), a first-time contender in the elite division of the
Boot Camp Challenge.&quot;Although I didn&apos;t train for this event, the most
challenging was saying aye-aye, sir, and yes, sir, every time they
yelled at me.&quot;Drill instructors got up close and personal, spewing out words of
encouragement while participants continued to muddle through the course.&quot;We have earned our place amongst Marines, and we expect nothing less of
you,&quot;said Master Sgt. Tracy Reddish, drill instructor at MCRD.

Drill instructors showed no mercy as they reminded their newly-acquired
recruits that even when they have given up on themselves, they must
uphold the highest respect for the instructors on the course.

Following the event, finishers were treated to music, food, and a
complimentary message.

Present was Brig. Gen. Angela Salinas, commanding general at MCRD, who
ordered drill instructors to&quot;unleash a little fury&quot;as a way to
motivate challengers. Salinas provided a&quot;no cap race,&quot;which allowed an
unlimited number of civilians to take part in the event.

Over 40 volunteers from Veterans Village of San Diego and many San
Diegan competitors dedicated their time passed out T-shirts and offered
positive support throughout the course.&quot;I feel a sense of pride knowing that the proceeds from this event will
go to enhance the quality of life for Navy and Marine Corps service
members and their families,&quot;said Kelley Sitar, event director and
civilian Marine contractor at MCRD.

Boot Camp Challenge is part of the ongoing Fleet Week series of
activities throughout San Diego that honor service members and their
families.

NNS081020-06. CNO Speaks at DDG 108 Christening

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SW) Rebekah Blowers, Chief
of Naval Operations Public Affairs

BATH, Maine (NNS) -- The Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) spoke at the
christening ceremony for the Arleigh-Burke class destroyer, USS Wayne E.
Meyer (DDG 108) on Oct. 18.

Adm. Gary Roughead, CNO, highlighted that this ship is named after the
man who is known as the father of Aegis, a highly advanced integrated
combat system that is used on all U.S. Navy Arleigh-Burke class
destroyers and Ticonderoga class cruisers. Roughead was the first
officer to have commanded both classes of Aegis-capable ships.&quot;Admiral Meyer delivered a great leap in defense technology, one that
has given us the flexibility to adjust to emerging threats over several
decades, and as we have seen recently, it will be able to adjust to
emerging threats for decades to come,&quot;Roughead said.&quot;To me the fact
that one officer had the vision, the drive, and the passion to ensure
that the Navy has the best fleet in the world, is exactly the point when
it comes to naming this ship.&quot;Roughead also said he couldn&apos;t be more pleased to have Anna Mae Meyer,
Adm. Meyer&apos;s wife, as the ship&apos;s sponsor. He said she has been an equal
and a partner in Wayne&apos;s endeavors.&quot;She&apos;s worked with the engineers; she&apos;s worked with the military; she&apos;s
worked with our civil servants to help bring the AEGIS weapons program
to life. Her energy, her drive and her intellect will be the spirit of
this ship,&quot;Roughead said.

CNO said that like Adm. Meyer, every Sailor has the unique opportunity
to make incredible contributions to fields that will benefit the Navy.
He also thanked the Bath Iron Works shipbuilders for all the hard work,
innovation and dedication they put in to making the ship complete.&quot;You are going to provide, as this ship is christened and launched, a
capability and the capacity we need to protect our interests; to provide
the security that is vital to our prosperity; to prevent conflict; and
when necessary, and as has always been the case in the United States
Navy, to win in war,&quot;the CNO said.

NNS081018-12. USS Kearsarge Reaches Mid-deployment of Continuing Promise
Mission

By Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Emmitt J. Hawks, Continuing
Promise 2008 Public Affairs

USS KEARSARGE (NNS) -- USS Kearsarge (LHD 3), reached the mid-point of
its deployment supporting the humanitarian/civic assistance (HCA)
mission Continuing Promise (CP) 2008 while in the Dominican Republic.

Kearsarge&apos;s mission during CP 08 is to conduct joint civil-military
operations including humanitarian and civic assistance, as well as
veterinary, medical, dental and civil engineering support to six partner
nations and to send a strong message of compassion, support and
commitment to Central and South America and the Caribbean.

Departing Norfolk, Va., Aug. 6, the ship has since completed HCA
missions in Nicaragua and Colombia and is currently conducting HCA
operations in the Dominican Republic.&quot;This has been an excellent deployment so far,&quot;said CP 08 Mission
Commander, Capt. Fernandez&quot;Frank&quot;Ponds.&quot;We&apos;ve been able to assist and
partner with many of our friends in region. It has been a great display
of friendship and cooperation, and we&apos;ll continue to foster those
valuable relationships in the countries to come.&quot;One month into the HCA mission, Kearsarge was called upon to assist with
humanitarian assistance/disaster relief (HADR) operations in Haiti after
the country was struck by four tropical storm systems in less than a month.

Kearsarge&apos;s capabilities include rapid movement of personnel and cargo
by helicopter and landing craft, making it an ideal platform to support
humanitarian relief missions on short notice.&quot;The Haiti disaster relief effort really demonstrated the incredible and
unique capabilities of the USS Kearsarge, and its ability to provide
heavy-lift support.&quot;said Maj. Thomas DeFazio, officer in charge of CP
08 engineers.

Marine and Navy helicopters embarked aboard Kearsarge flew more than 100
missions, and landing craft units transported more than 30 loads of
supplies. These operations led to the timely delivery of more than 3.3
million pounds of food, water and other relief supplies.

Crew members from the embarked Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron (HSC) 28,
Detachment 5 and Marine Heavy Helicopter (HMH) Squadron 464 are proud of
the support they have been able to offer the CP 2008 mission and
especially to the citizens of Haiti during such a devastating time.&quot;During this endeavor, we have best been utilized for our ability to
provide medevac, [very important personnel] transport and small landing
zone (LZ) access,&quot;said Chief Aviation Electronics Technician Marsh
Weber, search and rescue chief of HSC-28, Det. 5.

Weber said the detachment&apos;s single most memorable and challenging moment
during the disaster relief efforts was when the&quot;Voodoo Knights&quot;of
HSC-28 were called upon to deliver food and water to an isolated Haitian
orphanage that had no vehicle access and no landing zone.&quot;Due to the nimble nature of the MH-60S and the skill-set derived
through search and rescue training, our crews were the only CP asset
able to hover low over the scene and hoist down the essential items to
the hurricane victims,&quot;said Weber.&quot;We all felt proud that we could
help some of the most critically challenged when their situation looked
grim.&quot;Weber said his team, like the rest of the CP 08 team, looks forward to
the rest of the mission and is ready to face any oncoming challenges,
both planned and unplanned.&quot;I could not have been more proud of the Kearsarge crew and all of the
embarked units,&quot;said Commanding Officer Capt. Walter Towns.&quot;No one
hesitated to answer the call when one of our neighbors needed assistance.&quot;Kearsarge departed Haiti Sept. 26 heading toward the Dominican Republic
to continue its HCA mission.
To date, the Continuing Promise 2008 medical and dental team of more
than 150 military medical professionals and non-governmental
organizations, have worked alongside partner nation officials to treat
more than 30,000 primary care patients, dispense more than 57,000
prescriptions, provide veterinary care to nearly 4,000 animals and
conduct more than 100,000 medical, dental and optometric services.

Additionally, medical personnel performed more than 70 surgeries on
board the ship during the mission. One of the more recent surgeries
involved two 8-year-old twin boys who received eye surgery to correct
strabismus, a condition where the eyes do not properly align with one
another.&quot;The boys have been dealing with this problem since they were born,&quot;said Joselyn Altagracia Carmarena Vargas, the twins&apos; mother.&quot;This
blessing has been a long time coming, and our family is very grateful
for everything that is being done for us.&quot;For most of the doctors on the Continuing Promise team, the smiles, hugs
and handshakes have made this mission worthwhile.&quot;It gives me great satisfaction to be able to have helped these boys in
a way no one else could,&quot;said Cmdr. Brian Alexander, an ophthalmologist
embarked aboard Kearsarge for the CP 08 mission.&quot;The smiles on the
faces of the twins and their mother were one of the biggest rewards I
could have received.&quot;Navy Seabees attached to Construction Battalion Maintenance Unit (CBMU)
202 and civil engineers from the Air Force&apos;s 5th Civil Engineer
Squadron&apos;s Prime Base Emergency Engineer Force, both embarked aboard
Kearsarge, have completed 15 construction and renovation projects during
the mission and expect to complete at least seven more in the remaining
countries.&quot;The projects thus far have been very successful,&quot;said DeFazio.&quot;There
have been many highlights, to include the renovations at the Municipal
Park in Puerto Cabezas [Nicaragua] where kids swarmed the playground at
the closing ceremony to the construction of a modified seahut into an
L-shaped school at Los Alpes [Colombia] which was dedicated as Escuela
Kearsarge.&quot;When Kearsarge departs the Dominican Republic, they will move forward
with the Continuing Promise mission to Trinidad and Tobago.

Kearsarge&apos;s mission exemplifies the United States Maritime Strategy
which emphasizes deploying forces to build confidence and trust among
nations through collective maritime security efforts that focus on
common threats and mutual interest.

USS Kearsarge is under the operational control of U.S. 4th Fleet. U.S.
4th Fleet&apos;s mission is to direct United States naval forces operating in
the Caribbean and Central and South American regions and interact with
partner nation navies to shape maritime environment.

The Continuing Promise Caribbean Phase is the second of two HCA
deployments to the Southern Command area of focus for 2008. The first
Continuing Promise deployment was conducted by USS Boxer (LHD 4) in the
Pacific.

Embarked units and organizations aboard Kearsarge for CP include
Commander, Amphibious Squadron 8, Fleet Surgical Team 4; U.S. Public
Health Service; Navy Construction Battalion Maintenance Unit 202; Air
Force Civil Engineering Squadron 5&apos;s Prime Base Engineer Emergency
Force; contingents of medical personnel from the armed forces of the
Canada, The Netherlands, France and Brazil; Navy Assault Craft Unit 2;
Naval Beach Group 2; nongovernmental organizations International Aide,
Operation Smile and Project Hope; U.S. Navy Maritime Civil Affairs
Squadron 2; Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron (HSC) 28; and Marine Heavy
Helicopter Squadron (HMH) 464.

NNS081020-05. CNO Receives Award for Distinguished Service to America

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SW) Rebekah Blowers, Chief
of Naval Operations Public Affairs

WAYNE, Pa. (NNS) -- The Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), Adm. Gary
Roughead, received the Bob Hope Five-Star Award for Distinguished
Service to the United States of America from his high school alma mater,
Valley Forge Military Academy and College (VFMAC) on Oct. 19.

CNO is the 25th recipient of the Bob Hope Five-Star Award and was chosen

built the foundation of his character.&quot;Thank you again for this incredible honor and for your wonderful
hospitality. I will never forget [this], and I applaud and thank you for
everything you are doing to carry forth the traditions of this wonderful
institution that we all love so much,&quot;Roughead said.

Bob Hope was the award&apos;s first recipient in 1975. VFMAC said he inspired
the selection criteria for the award: someone who possesses strength of
character, unmatched leadership ability, and an unwavering love for and
devotion to our great nation. The 24th Bob Hope Five-Star Award
recipient was Mr. H. Ross Perot in 2004.

NNS081018-11. Combined Task Force 158 Changes Command&gt;From Combined Maritime Forces Public Affairs

NORTH ARABIAN GULF (NNS) -- A Royal Australian Navy commodore relieved a
U.S. Navy admiral as the commander of Combined Task Force (CTF) 158
during a ceremony held at the Khawr Al Amaya Oil Terminal (KAAOT) Oct. 17.

Royal Australian Navy Commodore Bruce Kafer relieved Rear Adm. Kendall
Card during the ceremony that ended the U.S. Navy&apos;s successful
three-month command of CTF 158. Command of the task force typically
rotates between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States.&quot;Well done to all of our coalition partners: our friends from the United
Kingdom, Australia, Singapore and Iraq,&quot;said Card.&quot;Through our
combined work and presence here in the North Arabian Gulf, we have been
successful in meeting the primary mission of defense of the oil
platforms, along with producing considerable enhancements in the
infrastructure and vastly moving forward the transition of the mission
to the Iraq navy and marines.&quot;The primary mission of CTF-158 is to conduct Maritime Security
Operations (MSO) around KAAOT and the Al Basrah Oil Terminal (ABOT) in
support of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1790 in the North Arabian Gulf.

The U.N. Security Council resolution charges the multinational force
with the responsibility and authority to maintain security and stability
in Iraq territorial waters and supports the Iraq government&apos;s request
for security support.

Kafer says the job will be tough, but his team can handle the task.&quot;I appreciate that this mission is a significant challenge,&quot;said Kafer.&quot;However, I am fortunate and privileged to lead a capable and
experienced team, so I am confident that we will meet all challenges
directly and professionally.&quot;CTF 158 operates jointly with Iraqi navy sailors and marines, trained by
members of the Navy transition team based in nearby Umm Qasr.

MSO help set the conditions for security, which promotes stability and
prosperity in the North Arabian Gulf. These operations protect Iraq&apos;s
sea-based infrastructure, which provides the Iraqi people the
opportunity for self-determination. MSO complement the counterterrorism
and security efforts of regional nations and seek to disrupt violent
extremists&apos; use of the maritime environment as a venue for attack or to
transport personnel, weapons or other material.

NNS081020-04. NAS Whidbey Island Kicks Off Energy Week, Focuses on
Ambitious Goal

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Tucker M. Yates, Fleet Public
Affairs Center, Det. Northwest

OAK HARBOR, Wash. (NNS) -- Naval Air Station (NAS) Whidbey Island
highlighted Energy Conservation Awareness Week 2008 with a cake-cutting
ceremony held at the Navy Whidbey Recycle center, Oct. 14.

Other events were hosted Oct. 14-17 on the base to promote education and
awareness of energy conservation and recycling, as well as informing
attendees of continual energy saving integrations the base is implementing.&quot;Energy costs this base a lot of money, millions of dollars, and that&apos;s
a cost we have to bear, but we do everything we can to conserve that
energy,&quot;said Cmdr. Matt Miller, NAS Whidbey Island executive officer.&quot;Unless you&apos;ve been living in a cave, you know energy is a big issue
nationally, and it&apos;s a big issue locally for us.&quot;The base&apos;s energy conservation goal as of 2003 was a 30-percent increase
in energy efficiency by 2015.&quot;We&apos;re on track to do that, but that&apos;s a pretty ambitious goal, and it&apos;s
going to require our efforts and financial efforts to meet that goal,&quot;said Miller.&quot;We have some exciting projects for the future that I think
are really neat, like solar projects, lighting projects, and even some
geothermal projects going on that are going to save us money in the long
run.&quot;The most recently completed of these projects is the installation of
infrared heating systems to replace the existing steam systems in
hangars 6, 8, and 10 last winter.&quot;As our energy projects are installed and used for a whole year, we
start to see their benefits. This year we will see the benefit of those
(infrared heating) energy projects,&quot;said Jeff Hrovat, NAS Whidbey
Island resource efficiency manager.

NAS Whidbey Island currently has already achieved a 23-percent increase
in efficiency from 2003.&quot;We have until 2015 to get our 30 percent, and we will be greater than a
30 percent savings by that time. We&apos;ll be able to save that energy.
We&apos;re looking really great to meet our goals,&quot;said Hrovat.

Also included in the week&apos;s festivities were a five-kilometer fun
run/walk at the NAS Whidbey Island Gym and Fitness Center, hybrid and
alternative fuel vehicle displays at the Navy Exchange, and an energy
information display at the Commissary.

NAS Whidbey Island has been recognized for their continual conservation
efforts through the Secretary of the Navy Fiscal Year 2007 Energy Award
Platinum Level of Achievement and the 2007 1st Place Government Agency
National Keep America Beautiful Award for Navy Whidbey Recycle.

NNS081018-14. Navy Engineers Test New Runway Repair System

By Darrell Waller, Naval Facilities Engineering Command Engineering
Service Center Public Affairs

PORT HUENEME, Calif. (NNS) -- The Naval Facilities Engineering Command&apos;s
Engineering Service Center (NAVFAC ESC) has successfully tested the
Foam-Injection System for Airfield Damage Repair (ADR), a revolutionary
new method to rapidly repair damaged runways.

The system was demonstrated at the August 2008 Critical Runway
Assessment and Repair (CRATR) Joint Capabilities Technology
Demonstration (JCTD) at Tyndall Air Force Base, Fla. Testing was made
more difficult due to wet field conditions following hurricane activity,
but the system easily overcame those hurdles.&quot;This new airfield repair system incorporates a two-part, high expansion
polyurethane foam to compact sub-grade soil in bomb craters,&quot;said
NAVFAC ESC Commanding Officer, Capt. Gregory J. Zielinski.&quot;Combined
with a fast-setting concrete cap, this system eliminates the difficult
and time consuming process of compacting soils in thin layers inside
craters. This means airfields can be quickly repaired and returned to
service, ensuring continuous air support for our warfighters.&quot;The crater repair test was plagued by the presence of sub-grade soil,
which included overly saturated sand and organic material. Standing
water created swamp-like conditions, adding an element of realism to the
scenario.

The foam injection system was tested on two such craters. After both
craters were capped with a fast-setting concrete, foam was injected into
the backfill of each crater. As foam was injected into the craters,
large quantities of water were forced out of the backfill through vent
holes drilled into the concrete cap.

After injection was completed, the craters were immediately trafficked
with a C-17 load cart. At the conclusion of load cart testing, the first
crater had sustained 1800 passes with only a crack, and the second
sustained 590 passes before failure. This far exceeds the required
expedient repair threshold of 100 passes and the objective of 200 passes.

Based on lessons learned from this testing, the performance
specifications for the expandable foam and the injection system are
being revised as well as the documentation for tactics, techniques and
procedures. The system will now be added to the Seabee&apos;s table of
allowance (TOA), purchased and delivered to the field.

five ships to the fleet Oct. 7  13 through its underwater ship
husbandry division (UWSH).

NAVSEA&apos;s UWSH program provides cost effective repair solutions when
dry-docks are either infeasible or impractical, enabling ships to return
to the fleet sooner by using Navy divers to make underwater repairs.
Returning ships to the fleet sooner increases current readiness
providing an agile, adaptable and surge-ready force.&quot;U.S. Navy divers executing UWSH repair operations -- and Navy divers in
general-- accomplish extraordinary feats,&quot;said Bill Reid, director of
NAVSEA&apos;s UWSH program.&quot;Divers conduct repairs that run the gamut from
simple cofferdam installations to complex underwater welding repairs.
They are highly dedicated men and women who put in long hours in an
arduous environment to sustain the fleet at home, on deployment, on
holidays and weekends without complaint.&quot;Last fiscal year, NAVSEA&apos;s UWSH repaired 103 ships. This provided a
combined 448 days to the fleet as these ships were able to return to sea
and to deployments. These efforts saved the Navy more than $64 million
compared to placing the ships in dry dock.

Currently two submarines, one cruiser and one destroyer are being
repaired by NAVSEA UWSH personnel.

When UWSH isn&apos;t returning ships to the fleet, they&apos;re developing new
techniques, procedures and equipment to perform ship repairs while
waterborne.

NNS081019-02. French Medics Commit to Continuing Promise

By Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Ernest Scott, Continuing Promise
2008 Public Affairs

USS KEARSARGE (NNS) -- During outreach efforts to the Dominican
Republic, France joined Continuing Promise (CP) 2008, the
humanitarian/civic assistance mission to build strong ties to countries
in the Caribbean, Oct. 3-16.

Currently embarked aboard USS Kearsarge (LHD 3) for the CP 2008 mission,
French medical personnel have been eager to offer their assistance.&quot;We&apos;ve participated in similar missions but nothing of this scale,&quot;said
French Navy Cmdr. Bruno Rosier.&quot;The amount of sick and injured people
who are receiving care is amazing. They need our help, and together we
are making sure they get it.&quot;In the Dominican Republic alone, Kearsarge established four medical
sites that provided basic medical care as well as dental and optometric
aid to many rural areas.&quot;In some places, we provided care that the citizens otherwise would not
have received,&quot;said Master Chief Virginia Coste, a nurse in the French
Navy.&quot;Whether they received medial treatment or just education, we made
a difference, and they know they have our support.&quot;Each morning we arrive at the clinic and see the vast number of people
waiting,&quot;said Coste.&quot;The way they welcome us seems to break down all
barriers between us. We have so many nations together under one roof,
yet no one thinks of the diversity, just the mission.&quot;The Continuing Promise mission has included medical personnel from
Brazil, the Netherlands and Canada as well.

Kearsarge is supporting the Caribbean phase of CP, a joint effort among
the United States, partner nations and non-governmental organizations to
provide humanitarian assistance to South American countries.

Kearsarge is under the operational control of U.S. 4th Fleet. U.S. 4th
Fleet&apos;s mission is to direct United States naval forces operating in the
Caribbean and Central and South American regions and interact with
partner nation navies to shape the maritime environment.

The Continuing Promise Caribbean Phase is the second of two HCA
deployments to the Southern Command area of focus for 2008. The first CP
deployment was conducted by USS Boxer (LHD 4) in the Pacific.

NNS081019-05. USS Mason Embarks Georgian Coast Guard Officers

By Ensign William Bickel, USS Mason Public Affairs

BATUMI, Georgia (NNS) -- The Arleigh Burke-Class guided missile
destroyer USS Mason (DDG 87) hosted two Georgian Coast Guard officers
for training Oct. 15.

While embarked, the Georgian officers observed and participated in
operations across multiple warfare areas and formed personal and
professional bonds with Mason&apos;s crew.

The comprehensive training lasted nearly seven days, and the Coast
Guardsmen participated in events ranging from familiarization flights
aboard Mason&apos;s embarked SH-60B helicopters to training drills with
Mason&apos;s visit, board, search and seizure (VBSS) team.&quot;On Mason, we have received very good training and practical experience
in many different areas. This is important not only for the Georgian
Coast Guard but for all of Georgia,&quot;said Capt. Mamuka Dumbadze,
Republic of Georgia.

VBSS training proved extremely valuable for both guests and hosts.&quot;Training with the Georgians presented additional tactics from a
different perspective. We will be able to integrate their techniques to
augment our own. Maritime security tactics evolve constantly, and cross
training is essential,&quot;said Lt. j. g. Jonathan Hulecki, Mason&apos;s fire
control officer and lead VBSS member.

When not training or observing, both Georgians interacted closely with
crew members, sharing stories and traditions of Georgia&apos;s military.&quot;It was fascinating to hear the similarities between both military
services. It&apos;s vital in today&apos;s society to continue building
international relations such as this,&quot;said Ensign Ben Butler, Mason&apos;s
repair division officer.&quot;It was a pleasure hosting the two officers for a week. These types of
interactions between our two services can only improve our relationship
with Georgia,&quot;said Cmdr. Robert E. Clark, Mason&apos;s commanding officer.

Republic of Georgia 2nd Lt. Temur Bokhau echoed the sentiments.&quot;I am grateful to the U.S. Navy,&quot;said Bokhau.&quot;This has been a great
honor for us -- a great honor to be on board USS Mason. We would like to
thank the commanding officer and the entire crew for being so friendly
to us and receiving us on board.&quot;USS Mason is part of the Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group and is
underway on a regularly scheduled deployment.

NNS081019-03. Kearsarge Team Cares for More Than 16K in Dominican Republic

By Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Amy Kirk, Continuing Promise
2008 Public Affairs

USS KEARSARGE (NNS) -- Local government and military officials hosted a
ceremony at 27 Febrero Naval Base Oct. 16 to commemorate the completion
of USS Kearsarge&apos;s (LHD 3) Continuing Promise (CP) 2008 operations in
the Dominican Republic.

CP is a collaborative effort between the United States and partner
militaries, non-governmental organizations (NGO) and partner-nation
support organizations to build strong relationships that can be called
upon in the event of a regional situation requiring cooperative solutions.

During the 14-day operation in Dominican Republic, embarked NGOs and
military units worked side-by-side with partner-nation military and
civilian professionals to provide medical, dental, optometry and
veterinary care along with construction, renovation and small-scale
civil engineering projects.

Medical specialists from Kearsarge, Fleet Surgical Team (FST) 4, the
U.S. Public Health Service, Canada, Brazil, France and Project Hope
worked together with Dominican medical professionals to conduct nearly
750 dental exams and procedures, more than 2,100 optometry exams, 35
surgeries aboard Kearsarge, provide more than 16,000 patients primary
medical care and filled more than 31,600 prescriptions at several sites
in the area.

In addition to treatment, teams also conducted subject matter expert
exchange workshops on personal hygiene, sexual education and first aid.&quot;In some places, we provided care that the citizens otherwise would not
have received,&quot;said French Navy Master Chief Virginia Coste, a nurse
embarked aboard Kearsarge for the Dominican Republic CP 2008 mission.&quot;Whether they received medial treatment or just education, we made a
difference, and they know they have our support.&quot;Engineers assigned to Navy Construction Battalion Maintenance Unit 202
and Air Force Civil Engineering Squadron 5´s Prime Base Engineer
Emergency Force completed projects at four sites. The work included the
construction of a modified facility to house four new classrooms,
expanding a local elementary school in Sabana Grande, and the rehab of a
medical clinic in Bonao.&quot;This mission has been extremely challenging and rewarding,&quot;said Air
Force Maj. Thomas Defazio, officer in charge of the CP 2008 engineering
projects.&quot;The logistics of moving personnel, materials and equipment
ashore and accomplishing significant construction projects is amazing.
It has been a total team effort with everyone flexing to meet others
needs.&quot;Kearsarge Sailors also participated at various volunteer community
relations projects at the engineering sites, offering extra hands to
help with landscaping, construction, painting and building playgrounds.

The Kearsarge CP mission now sails toward Curacao, Netherlands Antilles,
for a brief port visit. Then to Trinidad and Tobago where similar
medical, veterinary, dental and engineering support will be provided.

NNS081018-16. Peleliu Sailors, Marines Fall Short Against Royal
Australian Navy Soccer Team

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class (SW/AW) Matthew Hepburn, USS
Peleliu Public Affairs

SYDNEY, Australia (NNS) -- Sailors and Marines from USS Peleliu (LHA 5)
and the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) put up a tough fight on the
soccer field Oct. 13 at Randwick Army Base but fell short of a victory
in a tournament against Sailors from the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

Blue skies and a light breeze set the scene for three soccer teams from
Peleliu, the embarked 15th MEU and the RAN, who took part in the
friendly round-robin tournament that was part of military sporting
competitions scheduled during a port visit to Sydney, Australia.&quot;It was a great experience to be able to play against a group of people
from the opposite side of the world,&quot;said Aviation Boatswain&apos;s Mate
(Handling) 3rd Class David Flores-Ramirez.&quot;Not many people are able to
say they&apos;ve been to Australia and played soccer against the Aussies, who
are great people.&quot;The competition began with Peleliu Sailors facing off against the RAN
team in the first game of the day. After two 15-minute periods, the RAN
team defeated Peleliu to take the first victory of the tournament. RAN
then faced the Marines from the 15th MEU and despite the best efforts of
the Devil Dogs, the RAN advanced by winning a second victory.

Sailors from Peleliu then played the 15th MEU in the losers&apos; bracket to
see who would get to face the RAN team for the championship match. Both
teams fought hard, and after a tie at the end of regulation time, the
team&apos;s goal keepers were put to the test in an overtime shootout.

Goals and saves were matched almost one for one, but the Sailors from
Peleliu pulled through with the last kick and emerged victorious to play
in the championship against the RAN. Their lucky streak would not hold
out, as the RAN team defeated the Peleliu Sailors 1-0 in the final match
of the day.&quot;It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience,&quot;added Flores-Ramirez, who is
assigned to Peleliu&apos;s air department.&quot;It was fun to just kick the ball
around and joke with the Aussies.&quot;Sailors from the RAN said they also enjoyed the opportunity to place
against the Americans.&quot;I was really looking forward to this,&quot;said Able Seaman Henry Tan from
the RAN.&quot;It was a great opportunity to socialize with you Americans,
and we were looking forward to seeing how well you do on the soccer field.&quot;Peleliu is the flagship of the Peleliu Expeditionary Strike Group
(PELESG) and the 15th MEU which is currently conducting operations in
the U.S. 7th Fleet area of responsibility. The PELESG left San Diego May
4 for a scheduled deployment.

The U.S. 7th Fleet is the largest of the forward-deployed U.S. fleets,
with approximately 60-70 ships, 200-300 aircraft and 40,000 Sailors and
Marines assigned at any given time.

NNS081020-03. Peleliu, Halsey Underway Following Sydney Port Visit&gt;From Peleliu Expeditionary Strike Group Public Affairs

SYDNEY, Australia (NNS) -- The amphibious assault ship USS Peleliu (LHA
5) and the guided-missile destroyer USS Halsey (DDG 97) departed Sydney,
Australia, Oct. 14 following a scheduled four-day port visit.

During the visit, more than 1,500 Sailors and 1,300 Marines met with
local citizens, experienced Australian customs and traditions and
enjoyed the many recreational activities offered in Sydney.&quot;The United States Navy has been coming to this wonderful country for
100 years, and we are honored to have such a strong ally and such a
steadfast friend in Australia,&quot;said Peleliu Commanding Officer, Capt.
Marcus A. Hitchcock.

Sailors and Marines took part in a variety of community relations
(COMREL) projects and sporting events in the local area during the port
visit.

One COMREL project had Sailors and Marines from Peleliu working
side-by-side with Halsey Sailors at the St. John Volunteer Ambulance
Station. The group of volunteers helped clean ambulances, organize a
garage as well as fix emergency radios and other equipment.&quot;Australians have showed us a lot of hospitality over the years, and by
doing this we can try to leave a lasting impact not only by taking part
in the culture, but by giving something back to the community,&quot;said Lt.
Demetric Felton, a chaplain aboard Peleliu who organized the ambulance
station project.&quot;We are all human beings, and we are here to support and take care of
one another,&quot;said Felton, a native of Tifton, Ga.

Sailors who took part in the COMREL said they enjoyed the opportunity to
help others during the port visit.&quot;This is my first COMREL, and it is great to help others,&quot;said Gas
Turbine System Technician (Mechanical) 2nd Class (SW) James Oliver, a
Sailor aboard Halsey.&quot;It feels good to help out the community.&quot;&quot;I would like to let the Australian locals know that we are supporting
them, and I like giving the Navy a positive image,&quot;added Oliver, a
native of Greenville, S.C.

In another COMREL project, more than 80 Sailors and Marines were paired
with local families in the Sydney area as part of the&quot;Home Hospitality&quot;program. This unique opportunity allowed Sailors to tour the city,
attend movies and concerts and enjoy traditional meals at restaurants
and in the homes of sponsor families.&quot;They took us to the Olympic stadium and out to the beaches and showed
us all around,&quot;said Yeoman Seaman Bobby L. Franklin, a Sailor aboard
Peleliu who took part in the program.&quot;They cooked us the best meal I&apos;ve
ever tried. They treated us like family.&quot;&quot;I would recommend this to other Sailors because it actually gives you a
chance to meet someone that lives here and can show you areas that
otherwise you wouldn&apos;t know about,&quot;added Franklin, a native of Lyons,
Ga.&quot;I ended up spending all three days with the family.&quot;Peleliu is the flagship of the Peleliu Expeditionary Strike Group
(PELESG) and the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit which is currently
conducting operations in the U.S. 7th Fleet area of responsibility. The
PELESG left San Diego May 4 for a scheduled deployment.

The U.S. 7th Fleet is the largest of the forward-deployed U.S. fleets,

NNS081020-01. USS San Francisco Undocks With New Bow&gt;From Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility Public
Affairs

PUGET SOUND, Wash. (NNS) -- USS San Francisco (SSN 711) returned to the
water Oct. 10 after successfully undocking at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard
and Intermediate Maintenance Facility (PSNS&amp;IMF), a field activity of
Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA).

The dry-docking resulted from the submarine&apos;s Jan. 8, 2005, collision
with an undersea mountain. The challenging, one-of-a-kind project
involved PSNS&amp;IMF cutting more than one million pounds of ex-USS
Honolulu (SSN 718) forward ballast tanks/sonar sphere and attaching it
to USS San Francisco. The engineering and production teams proceeded to
manipulate the mammoth structure with orchestrated precision. In some
areas, the bow of this massive structure was moved to within 1/16 of an
inch of the original structure.

San Francisco returned to Apra Harbor, Guam, under her own power where a
Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard-led team of engineers and production
personnel began the task of assessing the damage, dismantling the
wreckage, designing and installing structural and mechanical repairs to
prepare her for return to the U.S. mainland. This temporary repair was
followed by an unprecedented 5,600-nautical mile open ocean submarine
surface transit to PSNS&amp;IMF.

The submarine entered dry dock at PSNS&amp;IMF Dec. 5, 2006, to begin the
restoration period. In the early stages, the temporary bow of the San
Francisco was disassembled in place and the steel recycled. Later, PSNS&amp;IMF was authorized to define and execute the complete availability to
restore the rest of the ship&apos;s systems and bow restoration.

During the process, Cmdr. John Lund, superintendent of the project,
expressed his pride in the restoration work.&quot;We continue to press forward through tough circumstances and overcome
those obstacles,&quot;said Lund.&quot;That says a lot about the team effort
involved in this project.&quot;PSNS&amp;IMF is one of four public shipyards that play a major role in
maintaining America&apos;s fleet and providing wartime surge capability to
keep the nation&apos;s ships ready for combat. For NAVSEA, serving customers
in the fleet is the top priority.

NNS081018-17. Applicants Sought for FY09 Law Education Program

By Ed Barker, Naval Education and Training Command Public Affairs

PENSACOLA, Fla. (NNS) -- Naval Education and Training Command is
encouraging eligible naval officers to apply for the fiscal year 09 Law
Education Program and announced that deadline for package submission is
Dec. 1.

The program affords selected Department of the Navy officers the
opportunity to earn Bachelor of Laws or Juris Doctor degrees and serve
the Navy and Marine Corps as career in the judge advocate general
(JAG)Corps.&quot;This is a great program for anyone who has the desire to go to law
school and become a JAG,&quot;said Lt. Cmdr. Jennie Goldsmith, the JAG
accessions detailer at the Navy Personnel Command in Millington, Tenn.&quot;One of the things that makes this program great is the Navy completely
funds the program, and the student remains on active duty and continues
to draw a military paycheck while attending law school earning a
professional degree. Once they&apos;ve completed their degree, they&apos;ll get to
serve in a challenging career field.&quot;The Navy typically selects seven officers to attend law school each
year. Candidates must be serving on active duty as a commissioned
officer in pay grades O-1 to O-3 and have at least two -- and no more
than six -- years of active duty service as of their law school class
convening date.

Time-in-service requirements, which include time served in enlisted or
officer status, are statutory and will not be waived for this program.
Candidates must already hold a baccalaureate degree from an accredited
institution and be able to complete 20 years of active service as a
commissioned officer prior to their 62nd birthday.

Selected officers must begin law school prior to their six-year
anniversary date, and students have up to 36 months to complete their
degree program. Selectees will be required to obligate for additional
service at two full years for each year (or partial year) they are
enrolled in the program, in addition to any other obligation that they
may have previously incurred.

Upon graduation and admission to the practice of law, which in most
jurisdictions includes passing the bar exam, Navy and Marine Corps
officers will be designated as judge advocates. Upon completion of the
Basic Lawyer Course at the Naval Justice School, they are certified as
qualified and competent to perform duties as trial and defense counsel
of general courts-martial. They will then be detailed to one of several
large naval legal service or region legal service offices where they
will be exposed to the many legal areas found in today&apos;s Navy,
including: criminal, international, administrative and tort law; legal
assistance; maritime law and environmental law.

Lt. Cmdr. Shane Cooper, of Newport, R.I., was selected for LEP in 1999
and was accepted at Cornell University Law School, graduating in 2003.
He is presently assigned as the JAG for Submarine Groups 9 and 10,
located at Naval Base Kitsap, Bangor, Wash. Cooper feels LEP offered him
a great opportunity.&quot;Thanks to the law education program, I was able to receive a
fully-funded Juris Doctor degree from Cornell University,&quot;Cooper said.&quot;And for the entire time I was in the program, not only did I receive
full-time salary but was also able to accrue time-in-service. Being
married with three children, I could never have attended such a great
law school as a civilian and still been able to support my family. My
family and I have always felt truly blessed that we were able to take
advantage of the opportunity offered by LEP.&quot;Cooper says the program presents a win-win situation for both the Navy
and the individual.&quot;For the Navy, they get a yearly influx of a small number of line
officers who are career-minded to enter the JAG corps and will certainly
be in the JAG corps for a number of years,&quot;Cooper said.&quot;I think having
LEP graduates as part of the JAG corps adds a certain skill set that
enhances JAG&apos;s reputation within the line components that we serve. As a
former submariner, I had instant credibility for my position as the
SUBGRU JAG.&quot;Eligible participants who desire to apply for the FY09 program must
submit a letter request and application package via their commanding
officer to: Commanding Officer, Naval Education and Training
Professional Development and Technology Center (NETPDTC), Code N2A2,
6490 Saufley Field Road, Pensacola, FL, 32509-5204. Letters must include
the applicant&apos;s current work mailing and e-mail addresses and contact
numbers.

In addition, all applicants must ensure official college transcripts
from each school attended are forwarded to NETPDTC. Law School Admission
Test (LSAT) scores must be received prior to the FY-09 selection board
convening in Feb. 09 but may be submitted by separate correspondence.

For specific guidance on the law education program and application
requirements, see SECNAVINST 1520.7F and NAVADMIN 135/08.

NNS081020-07. New Media Activity Activation Announced&gt;From the Department of Defense

WASHINGTON (NNS) -- The Department of Defense announced Oct. 20 the
activation of the Defense Media Activity (DMA).

Borne out of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission&apos;s 2005
conclusions, the DMA places internal information programs -- the Army
Broadcasting Service, Soldiers Radio/TV, the Soldiers Media Center, the
Naval Media Center, the Air Force News Agency, Marine Corps internal
information assets and the Army/Air Force Hometown News Service with the
American Forces Information Service -- into one activity which will be
located at Ft. Meade, Md., in 2011.&quot;This transformational change in public affairs will improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of DoD&apos;s internal communications
capabilities while continuing to provide unparalleled support for those
who serve our nation,&quot;said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of
Defense for Public Affairs Robert T. Hastings.&quot;Ensuring the continued free flow of timely and accurate news and
information to our military personnel is the primary mission of DMA. I
think it is one of the most exciting things to happen to DoD Public
Affairs in a long time. It&apos;s our opportunity to change the way we
deliver news and information to our internal audience,&quot;said Hastings.

DMA will work under the direction of the Assistant Secretary of Defense
for Public Affairs.

NNS081018-21. PRT: Work Outs During Work Ups

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Olivia Giger, USS George
Washington Public Affairs

USS GEORGE WASHINGTON, At Sea (NNS) -- With the physical readiness test
(PRT) around the corner, some Sailors admit they have begun to exercise
a bit more frequently.

Explosive Ordnance Disposal 2nd Class (DV/FPJ) Sean Conley has been in
the Navy four years and as a qualified dive specialist knows a thing or
two about taking care of his body. He offers shipmates some advice on
how to prepare for the PRT season.&quot;We&apos;re all expected to be able to serve and protect our country,&quot;said
Conley.&quot;And we all need to have a minimum physical readiness. Whether
you work in an office job or on the flight deck, anyone can be called
upon to fight for our freedom.&quot;Simply put, being healthy makes a person more productive.

Conley recommended that people who are unsure of their physical
readiness do a mock PRT by themselves as a self evaluation.&quot;This way you are in a stress-free environment and can assess your
strengths and weaknesses,&quot;Conley said.

The mile-and-a-half run portion of the PRT is a simple test of
cardiovascular health and endurance. Anything that gets you breathing
and your heart rate up will help in this area. Conley recommends biking
and rowing as alternatives to running.&quot;Circuits are also a good cardiovascular workout. Get your heart going,
and take the intensity up. Then bring it down, and get it back up
again,&quot;said Conley.&quot;This keeps your heart working instead of leaving
it at a plateau.&quot;Push-ups are a simple endurance workout for your muscles, according to
Conley.&quot;What I recommend to guys that need to improve on push-ups is to get
used to that burning feeling in their muscles by doing as many push-ups
as they can and then adding two or three at the end,&quot;Conley said.

Another way to improve would be to break your push-ups into sets. If
your limit is 50 push-ups, break it into 15 or 20, and then do several
sets. This way, when your work out is finished, you&apos;ve doubled the
amount of push-ups you usually do and gotten your muscles accustomed to
the burning sensation.

Conley advised that when practicing sit-ups, one should use the required
technique when taking the PRT.&quot;There&apos;s a certain technique they want to see. Make sure that when you
train for it, you do it exactly that way,&quot;Conley said.&quot;We refer to
this as muscle memory.&quot;The more your body gets used to the burn, the more it adapts to that
feeling, letting it endure more sit-ups.

Conley added that before a workout, muscles need to be primed by
stretching them out. After a workout, part of their recovery should
include another stretch.

When getting yourself in better shape for anything, whether a PRT or
dive test, diet and exercise should go hand in hand.&quot;You can do one, but you won&apos;t get anywhere without having the other,&quot;said Conley

To have a balanced body, it&apos;s essential to monitor the things that are
going into that body. Processed foods will only harm a body&apos;s balance.&quot;Instead of eating two humongous meals a day, try to break those meals
up into four or five small meals,&quot;Conley said.&quot;When the stomach is
full of food, it causes your blood sugar to spike and then crash. Then
you feel tired and sluggish.&quot;The same goes for the body&apos;s metabolism. The goal is to keep a constant
metabolism throughout the day. Eating several small meals will keep
energy levels steady and metabolism stable.&quot;Above all else, don&apos;t think of getting in shape as something that you
need to do to stay in the Navy, or out of trouble,&quot;Conley said.&quot;Think
of it as something for yourself  to make you feel better about yourself.&quot;He added that finding joy in working out is the secret to any successful
fitness routine.

The George Washington Carrier Strike Group is currently back at sea
training in the Pacific Ocean after recently participating in the
International Fleet Review in Busan, Republic of Korea.

NNS081018-20. U.S. Fleet Forces Director Receives 2008 Presidential
Distinguished Rank Award

By Mass Communications Specialist 1st Class (SW/AW) Jerry Foltz, U.S.
Fleet Forces Public Affairs Office

NORFOLK, Va. (NNS) -- U.S. Fleet Forces Command&apos;s (USFF) Executive
Director and Chief of Staff was selected as one of four Department of
the Navy recipients for the 2008 Presidential Distinguished Rank Award
Sept. 30.

Adopted in 2003, the Presidential Distinguished Rank Award recognizes
senior executives (SES) within the federal government who displayed
exceptional performance as leaders, consistently achieved outstanding
results, and demonstrated commitment to excellence in public service.&quot;This award also recognizes the great military and civilian bosses who
provided me the encouragement, vision and opportunity to lead and follow
my passion for service,&quot;said award recipient Mark Honecker.&quot;Being
recognized for my leadership and accomplishments motivates me to do more
for the folks who count on me for the same leadership, mentorship and
opportunity that I received.&quot;&quot;There are almost 200,000 civilians that have chosen to serve as part of
the Navy&apos;s total force,&quot;said Honecker.&quot;While not in uniform, they make
huge contributions to the readiness of the Navy.&quot;Honecker began his naval affiliation as a financial management intern in
1985 with the Office of the Navy Comptroller. Now as USFF&apos;s Executive
Director and Chief of Staff, Honecker leads a staff of more than 900
people responsible for the training, readiness and operations of 165,000
military and civilian personnel and is responsible for a yearly
operating budget of $ 25 billion.

Nominated by Adm. Jonathan W. Greenert, commander USFF and Adm. Gary R.
Roughead, the Chief of Naval Operations, Honecker was chosen through a
rigorous selection process and evaluated by a board of private citizens
before being approved by President George W. Bush.&quot;This well-deserved award is a testament to the professionalism and
dedication of Mr. Honecker as well as recognition of the superb support
and hard work of the USFF staff,&quot;said Greenert.

In addition, Honecker has been recognized with the 1999 and 2000
Department of the Navy e-Gov Awards, the 2003 Department of the Navy
Superior Civilian Service Award, the 2004 Presidential Meritorious Rank
Award, and the SES Performance Awards from 1998 through 2007.

Honecker will be presented with a signed certificate from Bush and a
distinctive lapel pin in a ceremony at the White House later this month.&quot;While it will be a thrill to be able to go to the White House and get a
picture with the President, hearing from others that I am making a
difference is the real honor and reward,&quot;said Honecker.

NNS081018-19. Fleet Readiness Center Southwest Earns Shingo Award
Recognition

By Jim Markle, Fleet Readiness Center Southwest Public Affairs

NAVAL AIR STATION NORTH ISLAND, CA (NNS) -- The Fleet Readiness Center
Southwest (FRCSW) E-2/C-2 Production Line received a 2008 Shingo Silver
Medallion Award for Operational Excellence, during the 4th Annual Pubic
Sector Shingo Prize Award Ceremony held in Washington, Oct. 9.

FRCSW, located on Naval Air Station (NAS) North Island, Calif., is the
Navy&apos;s premier West Coast aviation maintenance, repair and overhaul
facility specializing in Navy and Marine Corps aircraft and related systems.

The Shingo prize recognizes organizations that exemplify world-class
performance in&quot;lean&quot;manufacturing procedures and business operations.
A&quot;lean&quot;business practice identifies waste (time, material, etc.) in a
production process in an effort to create remedies that increase
efficiencies and reduce time. There are three award levels: The Shingo
Prize, Silver Medallion and Bronze Medallion.

The Shingo Prize Board honored FRCSW with the prestigious award for
employing naval aviation&apos;s AIRSpeed continuous process improvement (CPI)
principles on the E-2C Hawkeye airborne early warning and C-2A Greyhound
transport aircraft repair, production and maintenance lines.

Only four public sector organizations across the U.S. received Silver
Medallions, and three of those were FRCs. FRCSW was joined by fellow
2008 Silver Medallion recipients: Fleet Readiness Center East at Marine
Corps Air Station Cherry Point, N.C.; Fleet Readiness Center Southeast
at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Fla., and the Red River Army Depot,
Texarkana, Texas.

Rear Adm. Paul A. Grosklags, commander, Fleet Readiness Centers, was
introduced at the award ceremony as a guest speaker, and noted that the
greatest thing his organizations get out of CPI, is customer satisfaction.&quot;Our customers consistently tell me that the quality of work and direct
support they&apos;re receiving is better than they&apos;ve ever seen in their
careers,&quot;said Grosklags.&quot;We are providing the &apos;best value&apos; as a DoD
organization, which is a vast improvement over 15 years ago.&quot;FRCSW was approved for the Silver Medallion after an examination of the
E-2/C-2 aircraft repair, production and maintenance lines. Examination
criteria focused on customer satisfaction and profitability; quality,
cost and delivery; lean core operations; and leadership and empowerment
enablers.

The process began when examiners reviewed the command&apos;s application
which highlighted the E-2/C-2 program&apos;s&quot;lean&quot;journey; which began
three years ago, when the line began implementing AIRSpeed continuous
process improvement tenets.

AIRSpeed analysis revealed that the primary driver for poor execution
was a lack of material, accounting for 80 percent of the organization&apos;s
barriers. A&quot;war room&quot;was created to coordinate, catalogue and track
E-2/C-2 operations. As production was monitored, the timing for parts
became evident, and a synchronized initiative with suppliers increased
the accuracy of bill of materials, restructured bill of work and
developed a coordinated supply forecasting process.

The production line was transformed, removing non-value material and
equipment, creating in a single-piece-flow cell-based work environment
with workload synchronized to demand. The line was reduced from 11 to 8
work cells.

As a result, E-2C aircraft turn-around time was reduced from 250 to 180
production days, and C-2A aircraft work dropped from 390 to 330 days.

Created in 1988 and sponsored by Utah State University, the prize is
named after the late Dr. Shigeo Shingo, a Japanese industrial engineer
who was instrumental in creating the Toyota production manufacturing
system. For 20 years The Shingo Prize has educated, assessed and
recognized operational excellence in outstanding companies. The prize
also serves as a roadmap for organizations around the world to
transition more confidently to a better future state based on trusted
lean principles.

NNS081019-01. Senior Sailors Shape Up with New Fitness Program

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Coleman Thompson, Fleet
Public Affairs Center Atlantic

NORFOLK (NNS) -- The Senior Health Assessment Program Enterprise (SHAPE)
facility for Naval Station Norfolk opened its doors officially at the
Joint Forces Staff College in Norfolk, Va., Oct. 10.

SHAPE presents a unique approach to physical fitness. By taking a look
at each individual&apos;s health and physical ability to calculate their
physical age, as opposed to their chronological age, the program is able
to create a customized exercise regimen to give the best results while
not stressing the body beyond its capabilities. In addition to the
personal exercise regimen, the program includes lectures on fitness and
general health improvement strategies and group exercise sessions.&quot;We want this program to improve the quality of life through fitness, so
the people who have a longstanding career with the Navy can continue to
do so without the setback of injuries,&quot;said Brad Roberts, a SHAPE
fitness specialist.

The program targets those Sailors who are 40 years and older with the
hope it will not only keep them in shape but also allow them to
disseminate the information they&apos;ve learned about personal fitness to
the junior Sailors in their commands.&quot;I&apos;m used to being in shape, but I&apos;ve noticed as I&apos;ve gotten older that
it&apos;s not so easy to do,&quot;said Capt. Vincent Bowhers of Joint Forces
Staff College.&quot;I&apos;m hoping to use the program to get myself back into
the outstanding [physical readiness test] category.&quot;The program&apos;s origins come from a partnership between the Navy and
Indiana University&apos;s School of Health, Physical Education and
Recreation, with the program being spearheaded by six fitness
professionals. The program is also being implemented at Washington Navy
Yard, Naval Station San Diego and Naval Station Pearl Harbor.

NNS081018-18. Navy SEALs Take First in 24-Hour Mountain Bike Race Series

By Mass Communication Specialist Petty Officer 3rd Class (SW) Mike
Leporati, Fleet Public Affairs Center Pacific

MOAB, Utah (NNS) -- A team of four San Diego-based Navy SEALs clinched
first place in the Men&apos;s Sport category of the Granny Gear Race Series
mountain bike competition, concluded in the Moab desert, Oct. 11-12.

Their team, The Flyin&apos; Frogs, traveled the country competing in
high-endurance mountain bike races.

The team consists of Lt. (SEAL) Eric Skalski, training officer for SEAL
Team 1; Senior Chief Special Warfare Operator (SEAL) Hans Garcia,
attached to Navy Recruiting Directorate; and Chief Special Warfare
Operators (SEAL) Mike Everett and Ted D. Bair, attached to Advanced
Training Command.

The team entered the final leg of the race series,&quot;24 Hours of Moab,&quot;200 points ahead of their competition and simply needed to maintain
their lead, explained Skalski, team captain.&quot;This is a pretty challenging course,&quot;said Skalski.&quot;What we&apos;re going to do is send out our fastest man, Mike [Everett], to
establish a lead.&quot;Everett was the first rider for the team, but he suffered a setback.&quot;I was going down a foot-and-a-half to two-foot ledge as soon as the
front tire came in touch with the ground, the right side of the bars
came off; they just snapped like a twig,&quot;said Everett.&quot;I had all the
weight on my tire, and that&apos;s how it bent.&quot;With a bent front wheel and broken handlebars, Everett had to carry his
bike back to the starting line, setting the team back an hour and eight
minutes.&quot;We had to recalculate where we&apos;re at and what we&apos;re going to do to
still assure a good finish in the series,&quot;said Skalski.

Despite the setback, the team managed to improve their standing with
each lap of the course and moved from 84th place to 35th by the end of
the race. After more than 25 hours, the team completed 15 laps on the
approximately 15-mile track.&quot;It was a game of catch-up for 24 hours, but we did a pretty good job,&quot;said Garcia.&quot;Everyone out here is in really good spirits, and there&apos;s a
good atmosphere despite all the sand storms last night; it was awesome.&quot;According to race officials, the racers were met with adverse conditions
like sand storms during the day and cold weather at night, which created
difficult track conditions and had potential to pose a health risk for
the riders.&quot;The cool thing about this race is everyone suffers the same,&quot;said
Everett.&quot;For a few of us, we&apos;ve suffered this way before; not that it
makes it any easier, but mentally I think we have a little edge on the
competition in that respect.&quot;After the race, the Flyin&apos; Frogs claimed their first-place trophy for
the men&apos;s sport division. Pros train hard for these races and take home
large cash prizes, explained Everett, but with deployments it&apos;s hard to
ride more than once a week. This race was Bair&apos;s first time riding in
seven months.

Amateur riders were able to ride alongside professional racers Chris
Eatough, Josh Tostado and Roan Exelby, who competed in the men&apos;s solo
category. Tostado claimed first place in that division.

The Granny Gear Series runs annual races throughout the country from
April through October. The series was founded in 1992 by Granny Gear
president Laird Knight to highlight the sportsmanship of mountain bike
racing.

NNS081019-04. USS Gonzalez Crew Members Honored at Seafood Festival

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class (SW) Cory Rose, Fleet Public
Affairs Center Atlantic

MOOREHEAD CITY, N.C. (NNS) -- Sailors aboard the guided-missile
destroyer USS Gonzalez (DDG 66) arrived in Moorehead City, N.C., to be
the guests of honor at the 22nd Annual Seafood Festival Oct. 3-5.

The North Carolina Seafood Festival is a not-for-profit organization of
Carteret county citizens and businesses, in conjunction with the town of
Moorehead City, N.C. The festival recognizes the importance of seafood
to eastern North Carolina.

To kick off the seafood festival, Cmdr. Brian Fort, commanding officer
of USS Gonzalez, and several other crew members were invited to attend
the opening ceremonies dinner.&quot;The opening ceremonies were a great opportunity to meet the range of
local folks responsible for the festival, and it really gave me a sense
of the community aspect of the festival,&quot;said Fort.

At the festival there were a number of vendors and artisans offering
their handmade goods for sale.&quot;The festival was a great opportunity to build community relations with
Moorehead City,&quot;said Operations Specialist 1st Class (SW) Matthew
Henderson.&quot;Sailors were afforded many different variations of North
Carolina seafood and the purchase of local arts and crafts.&quot;The seafood festival gave Gonzalez Sailors their first opportunity in
almost two years to visit an American port.

NNS081018-13. Naval Base Point Loma Sailors Volunteer to Assist Local
Military Veterans

By Chief Damage Controlman(SW) Darryl Manning, Naval Base Point Loma
Public Affairs

SAN DIEGO (NNS) -- Sailors from Naval Base Point Loma volunteered their
time to assist in painting, maintenance and other repair efforts needed
at the Don Diego VFW Post 7420 Oct. 16-17.

The Sailors efforts helped more than 750 local military veterans. The
Don Diego post serves veterans from WWII through the present with low
cost meals and social events. More than 80 percent of their members are
low income seniors.

The post owns its own building but has had difficulty addressing much
needed repairs and preservation. More than 20 Sailors from Naval Base
Point Loma answered the call and spent two days in repair and
preservation efforts.&quot;It is an honor assisting our local community, especially when a
veterans&apos; group is involved,&quot;said Boatswain&apos;s Mate 1st Class(SW) Eric
Schultz.&quot;It was a fantastic opportunity to both help out and get to
meet our local military veterans.

NNS081020-11. USS Mustin Pulls into Vietnam for Port Visit

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (AW) Robert S. Cole, Fleet
Public Affairs Det., Japan

DA NANG, Vietnam (NNS) -- The Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile
destroyer USS Mustin (DDG 89) and its crew arrived in Da Nang Oct. 18
for a scheduled port visit.

While in port, the ship&apos;s crew of approximately 300 Sailors will
participate in several community relations projects to include
conducting yard work and painting a fence that surrounds the Nguyen Dinh
Chieu School for disabled children. Mustin Sailors will also play a
volleyball game against their counterparts from the Vietnam People&apos;s
Navy and challenge a local soccer team at San Chi Lang Stadium. As part
of Project Handclasp, Sailors will hand out toys and books as well.&quot;This visit emphasizes the growing cooperation between the United States
and Vietnam,&quot;said Mustin Commanding Officer, Cmdr. James Jones.&quot;It
gives the crew a great opportunity to experience the wonderful culture
of Vietnam and Da Nang in particular.&quot;&quot;Community relations projects are important in providing an opportunity
for us to work with our Vietnamese neighbors to achieve a common goal
while simultaneously giving us an opportunity to thank our hosts for
their gracious hospitality. It is also incredibly rewarding to make a
positive impact on the lives of others,&quot;Added Jones.

Mustin is one of seven Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers
assigned to Destroyer Squadron 15 and is permanently forward-deployed to
Yokosuka, Japan. U.S. 7th Fleet is the largest of the forward-deployed
U.S. fleets, with approximately 60-70 ships, 200-300 aircraft and 40,000
Sailors and Marines assigned at any given time.

NNS081021-10. Dominican Republic Joins Global Maritime Info Sharing System

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Alan Gragg, U.S. Naval Forces
Southern Command/ U.S. 4th Fleet Public Affairs

SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (NNS) -- U.S. Navy and Dominican
Republic officials met Oct. 17 to launch the Dominican Republic&apos;s
involvement in the Maritime Safety and Security Information System (MSSIS).

Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Southern Command (NAVSO)/ U.S. 4th Fleet
Rear Adm. Joseph D. Kernan joined Dominican Republic representatives in
a ceremony to mark the beginning of this cooperative endeavor with
Dominican Republic.&quot;The sharing of Automatic Identification System (AIS) data is
fundamental for mutual Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) among our
regional partners,&quot;said Kernan, discussing the importance of the
Dominican Republic joining MSSIS.&quot;This is a critical first step in
successfully achieving the ability for partners in the region to share
information about maritime traffic, and it will dramatically improve the
collective safety and security of our maritime environment.&quot;MSSIS is an international system, developed by the U.S. Department of
Transportation (DOT) in partnership with NATO and the U.S. Navy to
provide a way for global partners to share AIS information. There are
currently 52 nations participating in MSSIS, which collects and displays
AIS data from multiple mobile and stationary platforms for real-time MDA
to multiple users through a web-based, password-protected system.&quot;Due to the shear quantity of unclassified maritime data already
available, Maritime Domain Awareness is beyond the capability of any one
nation to collect or process,&quot;said Kernan.&quot;Achieving collective
Maritime Domain Awareness in the Western Hemisphere requires a global
approach and regional teamwork. Through our collaborative efforts we can
achieve a much better understanding of the maritime environment and more
effectively enhance the safety and security of our waters.&quot;NAVSO/4th Fleet is approaching Collaborative Maritime Domain Awareness
in three phases; obtaining data, which requires multinational sharing;
using existing and emerging technologies to collaboratively analyze the
data; and establishing the Inter-American Naval Telecommunications
Network (IANTN) aboard partner nation vessels, so ships can use a
classified network to add Intel.&quot;MSSIS is also a cost-effective way for countries to improve their
awareness at sea,&quot;said Cmdr. Dave Wirth, IANTN Director and NAVSO/4th
Fleet Communications Department Head.&quot;An AIS antenna and receiver costs
less than $4,000 including the computer with Internet.&quot;Collaborative Maritime Domain Awareness directly supports the U.S.
Maritime Strategy by promoting collective maritime security and is also
aligned with the U.S. State Department&apos;s Global Maritime Partnership
Initiative.

As the Navy component commander for U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM),
NAVSO oversees maritime operations throughout Latin America, including
exercises and deployments, counter illicit trafficking support, and
theater security cooperation events.

U.S. 4th Fleet is the numbered fleet assigned to NAVSO exercising
operational control of U.S. Navy units temporally operating in the
SOUTHCOM area of focus, which encompasses the Caribbean, Central and
South America, and surrounding waters.

NNS081021-09. NAVSTA Rota Fire Department Opens Advanced Training Center

By Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class (SW) Paul Cage, Naval Station
Rota Public Affairs

ROTA, Spain (NNS) -- Naval Station (NAVSTA) Rota fire department opened
a state-of-the-art fire training center Oct. 17.

The new $450,000 training site was funded by Navy Region Europe and will
be used by NAVSTA Rota firefighters along with personnel from within the
theater. NAVSTA Rota is the only Navy base in Europe to have such a
structure.&quot;This is a great facility here,&quot;said Capt. Bill Mosk, NAVSTA Rota
commanding officer.&quot;We won&apos;t have to send people...to other
installations and or CONUS to get training, and firefighters can keep up
their proficiencies, their qualifications and certifications here.&quot;The cement and metal framed facility is two stories tall with an attack
and roof access and also has a flat roof to perform all types of ladder
and rescue operations. The inside has a small room that will double as a
kitchen for firefighters to use in learning to fight grease fires.&quot;When it comes to training we want to do it as realistically as
possible,&quot;said Mark Brusoe, from NAVSTA Rota Fire Department.&quot;The
facility replaces a mobile structure and increases the square footage of
the burn area by 1,000 square feet.&quot;Mosk says this facility is a win-win situation for Navy Region Europe
and the Navy.&quot;As an enduring base, this really fits into the plans of Region Europe
consolidating resources. We can provide the training right here,&quot;said
Mosk.&quot;To bring in folks from all around the region to [use] this
training facility and use it as a central site for firefighters from all
[is] not only great for Rota but for the whole region.&quot;For more news from Naval Station Rota, Spain, visit

NNS081020-10. Masters Degrees Available Through Washington DC Intern Program

By Alison Dickson-Kozloski, Chief of Naval Personnel Public Affairs

WASHINGTON (NNS) -- Applications for the FY-09 Navy Washington, D.C.
Intern Program are being accepted through Dec. 12 as announced in
NAVADMIN 291/08.

This program, which runs from August 2009 through June 2010, offers an
opportunity for up to six officers to receive a fully-funded Masters of
Arts degree in organizational management from The George Washington
University (GWU) while also serving on senior Washington, D.C. area staffs.

The program fosters a unique learning opportunity according to Lt. Cmdr.
Brian Dreschler, who is currently enrolled in Navy Washington Intern
Program.&quot;The fellowship is a great opportunity, not only for the curriculum in
organizational management that is highly applicable to leadership in the
Navy, but also for the cohort format where we learn from the civilians
in the class. There are only 12 of us and we represent society well -
from the military, State Department, nonprofit organizations,&quot;said
Dreschler.

The intern program is designed for officers who have demonstrated
superior performance, upward career mobility, and command potential.
Participants will attend full-time evening classes at GWU and complete
two-five month internships to expand upon their course work.&quot;The internship/curriculum combination is a phenomenal learning
opportunity,&quot;Dreschler explained.&quot;For the first six months, I am at
the Joint Staff, Deputy Directorate for Special Operations (DDSO). Then,
for the last six months, I will be at National Counter Terrorism Center.
Although, the learning curve is steep, I am really getting the big picture.&quot;Other internship opportunities include serving on senior Washington DC
area staffs such as Office of the Secretary of Defense, Joint Chiefs of
Staff, Office of the Secretary of the Navy and other government agencies
such as Department of State and Department of Homeland Security.

Eligibility is limited to active duty 0-4 and 0-5 unrestricted line
officers who have demonstrated superior performance and command
potential. Each prospective participant must be eligible for a 12month
(minimum) tour of shore duty and have completed JPME phase I. Officers
who have previously finished an in-residence Department of Defense
funded master&apos;s degree are not eligible.

NNS081021-08. Maryland Elementary School Students Support Halsey Sailors
During Deployment

By Lt. j.g. Kendra Crabbe, USS Halsey Public Affairs

USS HALSEY, At sea (NNS) -- As USS Halsey (DDG 97) enters the sixth
month of a scheduled deployment, the officers and crew have benefited
from the generosity of more than 100 students who attend class at the
North Salisbury Elementary School in Salisbury, Md.

A dozen large boxes filled with letters, granola bars, nuts, trail mix,
candy, cereal, gum, and drink mixes were delivered to Halsey during a
replenishment-at-sea earlier this month. The message from the students
was clear:&quot;Thank you for your service.&quot;Sailors assembled on the mess decks where they were given hand-decorated
bags of treats and personal letters from a child who attends the school.

According to Halsey Sailors, several letters included questions such as,&quot;How do you make water?&quot;and&quot;Where does your food come from?&quot;In
addition to confirming shipboard health and hygiene standards, Halsey
Sailors happily responded with letters of thanks.

Sailor&apos;s responses, along with a DVD showing them opening the school&apos;s
packages, will be sent back to the students.&quot;The student letters and care packages brought smiles to everyone&apos;s
face; their graciousness is inspiring,&quot;said Boatswain&apos;s Mate 2nd Class
(SW) Kristoffer Metcalf, who rallied his peers to distribute the gifts.

Cmdr. Robert Beauchamp, Halsey&apos;s commanding officer, said that reading
the letters written by the students was a heart-warming moment for the
entire crew.&quot;We are professionals in the Navy; our duties require us to deploy away
from our families for significant periods of time, and that separation
from our families is not easy,&quot;said Beauchamp.&quot;As each crew member read their own personalize letter, they were
touched by the comments, questions, and good wishes,&quot;added Beauchamp.&quot;We are proud to serve our nation; however, these children&apos;s comments
reaffirm our commitment to our families, our Navy and our country.&quot;Halsey is part of the USS Peleliu Expeditionary Strike Group which
departed San Diego May 4 on a scheduled deployment and is currently
conducting operations in the U.S. 7th Fleet area of responsibility.

NNS081020-08. Sailors Stand Watch Over Vietnam Moving Wall

By Dani Pacheco, Naval Weapons Station Public Affairs

CHARLESTON, S.C. (NNS) -- Sailors, Airmen and Marines worked together to
stand watch over the Vietnam Moving Wall Memorial as it visited the
North Charleston Coliseum Oct. 16 through Oct. 20.

Twelve Sailors assigned to Naval Weapons Station Charleston, 48 Sailors
and 10 Marines from the various supported commands on station, as well
as, 41 Airmen assigned to Charleston Air Force Base volunteered their
personal off duty time to guard the memorial night and day for four days.&quot;The history that is being showcased here and what the wall represents
are so important. All of the veterans deserve respect, so I am proud to
be here to help out,&quot;said Information Systems Technician Seaman Recruit
Danielle Sikich, a military volunteer assigned to Space and Naval
Warfare (SPAWAR) Systems Center Atlantic.&quot;The Moving Wall&quot;is the half-size replica of the Washington, D.C.
Vietnam Veterans Memorial and has been touring the country for more than
20 years. Displayed upon the wall are the names of more than 58,000
veterans who gave their lives for their country during the Vietnam War.&quot;I am in awe of how many names are displayed here. It&apos;s overwhelming,&quot;said Sikich.

The volunteers are responsible for security, helping visitors find
names, providing a military presence for the memorial&apos;s many visitors,
and many times, simply providing a listening ear to a visiting veteran.&quot;This experience has been very interesting. I am especially enjoying all
of the interaction I get to have with the veterans. They tell some
really good stories,&quot;said Cryptologic Technician 2nd Class Joshua
Jordan, a military volunteer assigned to SPAWAR Atlantic.

NNS081022-02. Continuing Promise Team Has Eyes on Curacao

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Gina Wollman, Continuing
Promise 2008 Public Affairs

WILLEMSTAD, Netherlands Antilles (NNS) -- Medical personnel from USS
Kearsarge (LHD 3) conducted a two-day optometry clinic in Willemstad
Oct. 20-21 in support of the humanitarian/civic assistance mission
Continuing Promise (CP) 2008.

A scheduled liberty port, the CP 2008 team was proud to offer their
services to the community after spending a few days of relaxing on the
island.&quot;It is great to have the opportunity to interact and treat the locals;
after having liberty here and experiencing where they come from it makes
it even more rewarding to help them,&quot;said Lt. Megan Rieman, an
optometrist embarked aboard Kearsarge.

Despite the rainy weather, locals arrived to receive free eye exams and
eye glasses. Host-nation medical personnel were grateful to the CP 2008
team for their assistance.&quot;We have a really good health care system on the island. Almost everyone
is insured, but some of the insurance plans do not cover eye glasses,&quot;said Assistant Medical Director of Saint Elizabeth Hospital Raiza
Gonenli-Pardo.&quot;That is the reason, when we were asked what we needed
help with, we immediately said optometry; you being here today is
helping very much.&quot;Country officials were also excited that the Kearsarge was willing to
lend a hand in the community.&quot;We are delighted that the skipper and the crew of Kearsarge were
willing and able to be here to help. I know this was supposed to be a
rest stop for everyone, and the fact that there are still people willing
to help is wonderful,&quot;said Chief of Mission/Consul General Timothy Dunn
at the U.S. Consulate, Netherlands Antilles and Aruba.&quot;It is important to have a ship as big and beautiful as Kearsarge to
come in and help the community, it not only improves the image of the
Navy but it also improves the health and welfare of our towns.&quot;When Kearsarge departs from Curacao, it will move forward with the
Continuing Promise mission to Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana.

The mission of CP is to conduct civil-military operations including
humanitarian and civic assistance as well as veterinary, medical, dental
and civil engineering support to six partner nations and to send a
strong message of U.S. compassion, support and commitment to Central and
South America and the Caribbean.

Kearsarge&apos;s mission exemplifies the United States maritime strategy
which emphasizes deploying forces to build confidence and trust among
nations through collective maritime security efforts that focus on
common threats and mutual interest.

Kearsarge is currently under the operational control of U.S. 4th Fleet.
U.S. 4th Fleet&apos;s mission is to direct United States naval forces
operating in the Caribbean, and Central and South American region and
interact with partner nation navies to shape the maritime environment.

The Continuing Promise Caribbean phase is the second of two HCA
deployments to the Southern Command area of focus for 2008. The first
Continuing Promise deployment was conducted by USS Boxer (LHD 4) in the
Pacific.

NNS081022-03. Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center Receives Unit&apos;s First
F/A-18F Super Hornet

By Chief Mass Communication Specialist (SW/AW) Jeffrey Wells, Naval
Strike and Air Warfare Center Public Affairs

FALLON, Nev (NNS) -- The commander of Naval Strike and Air Warfare
Center (NSAWC) landed the unit&apos;s first F/A-18F Super Hornet at it&apos;s new
home at Naval Air Station (NAS) Fallon, Nev. Oct. 21.

Rear Admiral Mark T. Emerson took custody of the two-seat Super Hornet
from the&quot;Flying Eagles&quot;of Strike Fighter Squadron 122 (VFA 122) at NAS
Lemoore, Calif., and flew the aircraft back to its new home.

NSAWC currently has 23 A-D series F/A-18s, but this is the unit&apos;s first
F-series Super Hornet. In addition to a training center, NSAWC is
responsible for tactics and weapons development for the fleet.&quot;This Super Hornet acquisition brings our flight line into the 21st
century and facilitates the advanced tactics development efforts by
NSAWC staff,&quot;said Emerson.

NSAWC has also received two E-2C Hawkeye&apos;s and transitioned from their
SH-60F Seahawks to the MH-60S helicopters. The addition of these
aircraft to the flight line required the maintenance department to make
some adjustments.&quot;The whole process took about eight months, and there were a lot of
obstacles that had to be overcome. We had to ensure our folks were
properly trained to repair the different types of equipment associated
with the F/A-18F. This consisted of attending &apos;difference&apos; training held
at NAS Lemoore or NAS Oceana,&quot;said
Lt. Cmdr. Scot Husa, NSAWC maintenance officer.&quot;Additionally, we had to obtain the many different tools and special
test equipment required for supporting this platform.&quot;The F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, which made their maiden voyage aboard USS
Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72) in July 2002, may look similar to the smaller
A-D Hornets, but have been fitted with new mission computers,
fiber-optic networks, targeting pods, joint helmet-mounted cueing
systems and next-generation sidewinder air-to-air missiles.

The Super Hornet&apos;s two F414-GE-400 engines are larger and provide 22,000
of thrust, with afterburner giving the aircraft a maximum speed in
excess of Mach 1.8.&quot;NSAWC performs a significant amount of tactics development and
evaluation in order to support the fleet. Having the Super Hornet
increases the accuracy and credibility of NSAWC&apos;s tactics and
implementations of tactics and development into the fleet,&quot;said Lt.
Cmdr. Don Bowker, NSAWC assistant operations officer.

In the coming months NSAWC is scheduled to receive a total of six
F/A-18F&apos;s from various squadrons.

NNS081021-16. Avian Radar Research Aids in Aviation Safety

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Tucker M. Yates, Fleet Public
Affairs Center, Det. Northwest

OAK HARBOR, Wash. (NNS) -- A field exercise Sept. 26-28 on Naval Air
Station (NAS) Whidbey Island&apos;s Ault Field tested the operability of
avian radars.

The three-phase Integration Validation of Avian Radar (IVAR) project,
tests the field&apos;s two radars, both modified Furuno 2255 marine radars,
in their ability to detect birds and determine their habits to increase
airfield safety and decrease the probability of a bird- aircraft strike
hazard.&quot;We&apos;re here to validate that these radars can be used to see birds,&quot;said Siddartha Majumdar, manager of Connectivity and Technical Services
for the Center of Excellence for Airport Technology at the University of
Illinois.&quot;The radar itself is just marine radar someone would buy for
their boat, so, we have to prove it can be used for this.&quot;The two radars use an array and a parabolic antenna to generate wide and
narrow beams, respectively. The data received is transmitted to displays
at which point, the radar team watching the displays, calls out targets
to be confirmed by visual teams strategically located throughout the
airfield. The data is then sent to the Space and Naval Warfare Systems
San Diego for verification and compilation.&quot;We put this data together and submit it and we keep going with the
project; we have another year of this. At the end, a final report will
say what we found, were we able to validate these radar can track birds
and how well it can track at different distances with different bird
sizes,&quot;said Matt Klope, of the NAS Whidbey Island IVAR team.&quot;When we
prove this works, we look at how you incorporate into a naval air
station and how would they use it to make that airport safer for our
pilots. That&apos;s the bottom line.&quot;Upon completion of the validation, the radar can be used to prevent
aircraft mishaps in multiple ways, mainly through near-miss data
accumulation and environment modification. When a near-miss event
occurs, the data will be saved by the radar for later observation and
analysis. When enough data is accumulated, it will help determine
patterns of bird behavior in certain areas of the airfield. Once this is
determined, the environment in the area will be modified to be less
appealing for birds to gather.&quot;A near-miss is as good as a strike, in our opinion, for managing the
environment. If you can have four, five or 600 of those points and use
that whole data set to manage your airfield and flight planning, you&apos;re
in much better shape with more data,&quot;said Klope.&quot;We&apos;re getting it;
this radar can track these events really well.&quot;The radar can also be used in conjunction with an alarm polygon system
to provide an advisory to air traffic controllers and pilots when a bird
is in an area hazardous to aircraft and allow them to modify flight
paths and times accordingly if possible.

NAS Whidbey Island is one of multiple military installations on which
these projects are being conducted. Others include NAS Patuxent River,
Md., Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, and Marine Corps Air Station
Cherry Point, N.C.

NNS081022-05. Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces Command Addresses Current Events

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class(AW) Martine Cuaron, Fleet
Public Affairs Center Atlantic

NORFOLK (NNS) -- Adm. Jonathan Greenert, commander, U.S. Fleet Forces
Command (USFF) recorded a podcast Oct. 17 to discuss current events and
the recent Great White Fleet celebration in New York City.

When speaking about the economy, Greenert said in the short term, the
state of the economy should not significantly impact the fleet&apos;s ability
to operate.&quot;We will continue to provide the security for our nation and security
for the world&apos;s economy,&quot;said Greenert.&quot;In accordance with our
cooperative strategy for the 21st century, our ships will continue to
steam, our aircraft will continue to fly, and our submarines will
continue to dive and surface.&quot;Greenert followed with concerns for Sailors and their families during
the present national economic instability.&quot;We all need to keep an eye on the effect (the state of our economy has)
on our Sailors and their families,&quot;he said.&quot;Some folks are already
feeling the pinch, and I would say to those that feel the pinch, they
should seek financial assistance if it&apos;s needed.&quot;He suggested turning to such resources as the Fleet and Family Support
Centers where professionals are available to help address valid concerns
about financial and other issues.

When asked about the upcoming presidential election, Greenert said,&quot;The
Navy was created to defend the nation, and it&apos;s not a political
instrument; however, we are citizens and we should do our part as
citizens and my advice to all is get out and vote.&quot;Greenert discussed his recent trip to New York where he visited USS
Nassau (LHA 4) during the 100th anniversary of the Great White Fleet
celebration.&quot;The Nassau represented our Navy in a great way,&quot;he said.&quot;New York
welcomed Nassau with open arms and all those who supported the Great
White Fleet celebration.&quot;The Great White Fleet deployed 100 years ago by direction of President
Theodore Roosevelt. During the deployment, Messina, Italy was devastated
by an earthquake and a subsequent tidal wave, and elements of the Great
White Fleet rendered aid to the country.&quot;The Great White Fleet helped shape the mission of today&apos;s Navy,&quot;Greenert added.

In closing, Greenert recognized the Navy&apos;s 233rd birthday which was Oct.
13 and asked Sailors to remember the heritage and traditions the Navy is
built on.

The podcast, a recorded audio program posted to the USFF Web site, is
used as a platform to speak to the fleet and is available for download
to personal computers or mobile devices.

NNS081021-19. Integrated Antiterrorism Exercise Conducted in Norfolk

By Mass Communication Specialist Seaman (SW) Shanika L. Futrell, Fleet
Public Affairs Center Atlantic

NORFOLK (NNS) -- Commander Navy Installations Command (CNIC), in
coordination with Naval Station (NAVSTA) Norfolk, took part in Citadel
Protect &apos;08, an antiterrorism (AT) ashore/afloat exercise, Oct. 15-16.&quot;We are protecting capital assets,&quot;said Capt. Kelly Johnson, NAVSTA
Norfolk executive officer.&quot;Training and getting our Navy ready for a
realistic situation by performing various exercises definitely ties into
the CNO&apos;s vision.&quot;The exercise&apos;s concept of operations gave the training team a chance to
eliminate the ashore/afloat team by achieving unity within the
operational environment.&quot;This exercise is designed to look at the gaps that exist and try to
eliminate them,&quot;said Steve Murley, CNIC trainer.

The exercise only focused on the first step to a threat. Units
participating were guided-missile destroyers USS Gonzalez (DDG 66) and
USS Bulkeley (DDG 84), and NAVSTA Norfolk installation security from the
Sewells Point Police precinct.

The objective of the exercise was to assess AT Navy Mission Essential
Tasks (NMETS), and a broad spectrum of primary capabilities such as
force integration and safety, and to introduce the position of the
antiterrorism tactical watch officer (ATTWO).

The ATTWO is the eyes and the voice which actively tells other posts
what to do and how to react to a situation through different methods of
communication.&quot;The ships and everyone who is involved have Blackberry phones, force
protection radios or beepers, [providing] the ATTWO and others involved
a direct line of communication so that we can together fight the battle
for antiterrorism,&quot;said Lt.j.g. Shane Jester, Sewells Point Police
precinct ATTWO.&quot;Although we are only doing the first stage, there will be more training
to follow in the future. We have to take the process one step at a time
so the Navy does not leave any gaps that will make us vulnerable.&quot;This exercise was the first of its type, led by CNIC, held on Naval
Station (NAVSTA) Norfolk.&quot;These exercises have been held overseas in Bahrain, but this is the
first formalized integration between the waterfront and shore
installation working together here at NAVSTA,&quot;said Cmdr. Rick
Cheeseman, commanding officer of USS Bulkeley.

NNS081021-12. Vandegrift Hosts Community Leaders for a Day at Sea&gt;From Naval Surface Forces Public Affairs

SAN DIEGO (NNS) -- Business and government leaders from Southern
California spent a day at sea aboard the guided missile frigate USS
Vandegrift (FFG 48) Oct. 7 as part of the Naval Surface Forces Leaders
to Sea (LTS) program.

U.S. Naval Surface Forces&apos; leadership implemented the program more than
10 years ago to educate community leaders on what the Navy does to
protect national interests. In that time, hundreds of influential
community members have embarked ships to gain insight into the daily
operations of Sailors at sea.

The five Vandegrift LTS participants were flown aboard the ship via
SH-60 Seahawk from Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 21 to the ship, which
was conducting training in the Southern California operating area. Once
aboard, the group was greeted by Vandegrift&apos;s Commanding Officer, Cmdr.
Dean Rawls, who provided an overview of surface force operations during
a question- and-answer session. After discussing the role and mission of
both the Navy and the ship, the group embarked on an exciting and
memorable tour.&quot;The Leaders to Sea Program provides us with a wonderful opportunity to
share a day in the Navy with the program participants,&quot;said Rawls.&quot;Not
only are they provided a first-hand look at daily operations at sea, but
it also allows the participants to see the level of commitment and
motivation of the Sailors serving in our Navy.&quot;A tour of ship spaces included the main engine room control station,
galley, bridge and weapons systems, which provided a glimpse of
Vandegrift&apos;s inner workings and the vital role the crew plays in the
ship&apos;s operation and readiness.&quot;I had a fantastic time,&quot;said Rebecca Kelley, director of community
relations for San Diego County District 4.&quot;The crew was amazing and
welcoming. The officers and Sailors knew their jobs and responsibilities
to a &apos;T&apos;. It was a very positive experience.&quot;Guests interacted with the commanding officer and officers during lunch
in the wardroom where they had a chance to provide feedback and ask
additional questions before concluding their day at sea with a flight to
Naval Air Station North Island.&quot;It was fantastic,&quot;said Jeff Davi, commissioner and director for the
California Department of Real Estate.&quot;I did not expect to have such an
experience. The morale on the ship was great.&quot;Vandegrift is attached to Destroyer Squadron 1 and is homeported in San
Diego.

NNS081022-04. COMFISCS Plans to Implement BRAC at FRC Southwest&gt;From Debra Bingham, Defense Supply Center Richmond Public Affairs

SAN DIEGO (NNS) -- Base Closure and Realignment transition team members
from Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and Commander, Fleet and Industrial
Supply Centers (COMFISCS) held a kick-off meeting at Naval Air Station
North Island in San Diego Oct. 15-16.

The team is preparing to implement 2005 Base Closure and Realignment law
that consolidates and realigns supply, storage, and distribution
functions at service-run maintenance depots, industrial sites and
shipyards from the services to DLA.

COMFISCS will transfer more than 100 positions from its FISC San Diego
Fleet Readiness Center Southwest site to DLA&apos;s Defense Supply Center
Richmond Feb. 15, 2009. Similar transfers have already occurred at three
Air Force air logistics centers and at two Navy maintenance depots.

The transition team focused on identifying issues and actions to take
place during the next few months, with the goal of maintaining the
current level of support. The team uses an&quot;as is, where is&quot;approach,
which means no changes are made to any functional systems or processes.

Much of the planning revolves around addressing administrative issues,
such as human resources, facilities and equipment, information
technology, finance and workload transfer.

Cmdr. Bill Darney, DSCR&apos;s transition director for FRCSW, said the
kick-off was a means of establishing a plan of action and milestones for
the team. The plan includes helping the workforce adjust to change and
addressing their concerns, such as making sure that pay and entitlements
are right.

Cmdr. Jim Goudreau, site director of FISC San Diego FRCSW, will command
DLA North Island when it is activated. Goudreau took part in planning
for the first two Navy FRC transfers at Cherry Point, N.C., in August
and at Jacksonville, Fla., in October. His experience was crucial in
bringing all of the decision makers and responsible parties together in
the same room at the same time to plan the FISC San Diego FRCSW site
transition.

Capt. Karl Rau, commanding officer of FISC Jacksonville and co-lead of
the Navy-DLA BRAC planning team, and Capt. Glenn Robillard, commanding
officer of FISC San Diego, also participated in the kick-off.&quot;We are special. I know you&apos;ve done two (Navy activations) already, but
please look for how we are unique, especially in the contractual
relationships. If you have to err on any side, please err on the side of

NNS081021-11. SURFOR Hosts Retired Flag Officer Conference

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SW/AW) Elena Velazquez,
Commander, Naval Surface Force Public Affairs

SAN DIEGO (NNS) -- Naval Surface Forces (SURFOR) hosted a Retired Flag
Officer Conference for 18 retired flag officers at Naval Amphibious Base
Coronado Oct. 9.

SURFOR organized the conference in order to provide the retired
admirals, who are all active members of their communities and regularly
provide information to opinion leaders, on current Surface Navy
initiatives to improve warfighting readiness, and its role in the
Maritime Strategy. Attendees also discussed strategic communications and
the importance of maintaining open channels so that the retired
community can serve as a bridge between uniformed and civilian leadership.

Vice Adm. D.C. Curtis, opening the conference, said,&quot;The briefs that
you will see today clearly demonstrate warfighting readiness is our top
priority. I value your open dialogue and frank discussion as it is
important to us all that we maintain our ties to the past which ensures
we don&apos;t forget hard won lessons.&quot;During the day-long event, SURFOR staff members provided briefs on
surface operations, the state of the Surface Warfare Enterprise, surface
community updates, class squadrons, and littoral combat ships.&quot;I believe the retired admirals that are here, including myself, are
called upon to help with the mission of the Navy and the more knowledge
you have the better outcome of the mission,&quot;said retired Rear Adm. Russ
Gorman.&quot;I like the information I&apos;ve received. And as to the questions I
had, SURFOR&apos;s staff has answered them and answered them well.&quot;For more news from Commander, Naval Surface Force, visit

NNS081021-21. Iwo Jima Cooks Up Unique Project to Showcase Crew&apos;s Diversity

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class (SW) Michael Starkey, Iwo
Jima Expeditionary Strike Group Public Affairs

USS IWO JIMA, At Sea (NNS) -- The multipurpose amphibious assault ship
USS Iwo Jima&apos;s (LHD 7) Air Department recently hosted a cruise project
to collect and share recipes from the ship&apos;s Sailors to generate a cookbook.

The collection of recipes will demonstrate a range of different cultures
and ethnicities that comprise Iwo Jima&apos;s crew.&quot;This project will be a collection of recipes from around the ship,
representing as many of our Sailors and their diverse cultures as
possible,&quot;said Lt. Dave Wegmueller, Iwo Jima&apos;s mini boss.&quot;Iwo Jima has
Sailors from at least 43 different countries, not to mention the
numerous different American regions, and this project will be a great
way to celebrate the variety of backgrounds represented on board.&quot;A Web page was set up to gather recipes from the Sailors.&quot;It was really easy to submit the recipes,&quot;said Aviation Boatswain&apos;s
Mate (Handling) Airman Jennifer Grimes.&quot;All you do is go to the Web
site and log on using the provided login and password. Then click &apos;Add a
New Recipe&apos; and fill in the info the site asks for such as your name,
ingredients and cooking directions. It is a very user-friendly Web site.&quot;The site also asks submitters to identify the origin or ethnicity of
each recipe.

Wegmueller plans to have the finished product available for sale by
January. Sailors are encouraged to e-mail spouses and family members for
recipes and photos to contribute.&quot;This will be a rewarding project with tangible results,&quot;said
Wegmueller.&quot;People will be able to experience food from all over the
world and in addition, recognize those who are contributing. This
project will also make a great gift, representative of the service of
those on board.&quot;Some Sailors have already contributed numerous recipes to showcase their
background.&quot;I contributed two recipes from my family, who are all from Baltimore,&quot;said Grimes.&quot;I contributed my mother&apos;s crab cake recipe which is very
common in the state of Maryland. I also contributed her pistachio cake
recipe. Of course, I recommend that every Sailor contributes to the
cookbook. The more recipes we have, the more eclectic the book will be
and what better way to show how diverse this ship really is.&quot;Iwo Jima is deployed to the U.S. 5th Fleet Area of Operations to conduct
maritime security operations (MSO). MSO help develop security in the
maritime environment. From security arises stability that results in
global economic prosperity. MSO complements the counterterrorism and
security efforts of regional nations and seeks to disrupt violent
extremists&apos; use of the maritime environment as a venue for attack or to
transport personnel, weapons or other material.

NNS081022-01. Sailors Take Part in 32nd Annual Yokosuka Mikoshi Parade

By Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Kari R. Bergman, Fleet Public
Affairs Center Japan

YOKOSUKA, Japan (NNS) -- More than 80 Sailors and their family members
volunteered to carry a heavy traditional Japanese shrine, called a&quot;Mikoshi, through the City of Yokosuka and onto Commander, Fleet
Activities Yokosuka (CFAY) during the 32nd Annual Yokosuka Mikoshi
Parade Oct. 19.

A mikoshi is a portable wooden Shinto shrine hand-carried during
Matsuri, or Japanese festival, believed to bring good luck and fortune
in the coming year.&quot;I have been in Japan for about a week now, and I decided to volunteer
for this parade because I figured it would be a nice way to learn about
the Japanese culture and community,&quot;said Gas Turbine System Technical
Mechanical Seaman Darryl Ellis, a volunteer in the parade.

For other volunteers, participating in the Mikoshi festival was their
way to show appreciation for their Japanese neighbors.&quot;I am getting ready to transfer out of Japan, so I thought that by
participating in the parade, it would be a nice thing for me to give
back to the community for all they have given me while I have been
here,&quot;said Machinist&apos;s Mate 1st Class (SW) Shanika Gaines.&quot;I feel that if more people show up and participate in events like
these, it shows the community that we are here and we do want to help
give back to the community and be a part of it,&quot;added Gaines.

The opportunity to carry the Mikoshi helped personnel around the base
get to know a little bit more about the people of their host nation.&quot;I think that more Sailors, especially the junior Sailors, should come
out and participate in events like,&quot;Ellis said.&quot;We are in a foreign
country, and we should get more in touch with the community, so that we
are more comfortable around them (Japanese) and they are more
comfortable around us.&quot;After carrying the Mikoshi through the streets of Yokosuka, CFAY opened
its gates to Japanese neighbors and friends, as the Mikoshi parade ended
with food and more festivities.

interactive program,&quot;said Jocelyn Fernandes, development director of
Holy Family Catholic Academy.&quot;We are encouraging them to use their
increased awareness of energy conservation in school and share their
knowledge at home with their families.&quot;Now in its second year, the Navy Region Hawaii&apos;s Energy Conservation
School Outreach Program, executed by NAVFAC Hawaii&apos;s Energy Team,
recently returned to various local area schools near Pearl Harbor to
help educate children on the importance of saving energy.&quot;The Navy Energy Conservation School Outreach Program has far reaching
effects,&quot;said Muilenburg.&quot;The program educates our youth on the
importance of conserving precious resources while positively impacting
local schools, Navy families and the local community in Hawaii.&quot;The program targets schools with a high concentration of Navy military
family members. This year, organizers launched the program Aug. 26 at
Holy Family Catholic Academy. During three presentations, approximately
475 students in kindergarten through 8th grade learned the importance of
energy conservation and the impact of energy waste.

The outreach program encourages students to participate in the drawing
contest to demonstrate what they have learned about energy conservation.
Winners were chosen from each participating grade at each school. The
winning entries will either be printed in a calendar or as posters. Both
the calendars and posters will be distributed throughout Navy Region
Hawaii and placed on public display at the Pearl Harbor Navy Exchange.

This is the first year the outreach program has reached out to private
as well as public schools. Overall, this year&apos;s program will reach
approximately 2,100 students.

By Chief Mass Communication Specialist (SW) Maria Yager, Navy Personnel
Command Public Affairs

MILLINGTON, Tenn. (NNS) -- A team of Sailors from the mid-South earned
top honors during the Tennessee State Open Rifle Championships Oct. 16 -
19 near Memphis, Tenn.

The Navy won the service rifle state championship in the team
competition. Team members were Cmdr. Steve Maronick, assigned to Navy
Personnel Command (NPC); Lt. Jeff Roney of NPC; Aviation Ordnanceman 1st
Class Steve Urban, assigned to the Individual Ready Reserve at Joint
Reserve Base Fort Worth, Texas; and retired Lt. Cmdr. Mike Salach.&quot;The NRA (National Rifle Association) allows retirees to participate in
the matches they sponsor, and it does not differentiate between the
Reserves and the active component, so we were able to have a pretty
diverse team,&quot;said Roney.

Several Sailors went on to place in the individual competition as well.

Roney, who is also a member of the U.S. Navy Marksmanship Team, took the
Excellence in Competition title Oct. 19 followed by Maronick, who took
second.

The Navy had three competitors place in the top five in the National
Rifle Association regional match, held in conjunction with the state
championships. Urban placed second, followed by Salach, who took third
place, and Roney in fourth.

Among the other Navy competitors were a father and daughter -- Fire
Controlman 1st Class (SW/AW)Bethany Ross, of NPC and her father retired
Senior Chief Aviation Electronics Technician (AW/AW) Jonathan Ross.&quot;This was the second time we shot together competitively. He taught me
everything I know,&quot;said FC1 Ross.&quot;The last two days of the competition were the best days I&apos;ve ever had
shooting. I even beat my father on the last day,&quot;added the younger Ross.

The matches, hosted by the Memphis Sport Shooting Association and
sponsored by the National Rifle Association were the last event of the
season for the Mid-South shooters.

The next big event will be the Navy-sponsored United States Fleet Forces
Command and All-Navy Rifle and Pistol Championships in 2009 at Naval Air
Station Oceana&apos;s Dam Neck Annex.

NNS081023-08. Navy Recognizes Outstanding Energy Programs&gt;From Naval Facilities Engineering Command Headquarters Public Affairs

WASHINGTON (NNS) -- The Department of the Navy (DoN) recognized six Navy
and Marine Corps organizations Oct. 22 that have made notable progress
toward DoN and federal goals to reduce energy and water consumption at
its annual Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) Awards ceremony at the U.S.
Navy Memorial in Washington.&quot;Energy challenges are everywhere. That&apos;s why the Department of the Navy
has a multi-layered approach to energy efficiency, energy security and
energy independence,&quot;said B.J. Penn, assistant secretary of the Navy
for Installations and Environment and guest speaker.&quot;I&apos;m personally excited about the opportunities ahead for embracing
energy and water efficiencyand increased use of renewable energy, and
making it mainstream in our operations,&quot;he remarked.

The six commands awarded the SECNAV 2008 Energy and Water Management
Award for innovative energy management, successful use of energy,
superior awareness and energy conservation principles during FY 2007
included:

Naval Base Ventura County (Pt. Mugu, Calif.)  Navy Large Shore
Category. Naval Base Ventura County achieved a 14 percent reduction from
their fiscal year (FY) 2003 energy baseline. Their projects included
HVAC and control system upgrades, daylighting, hangar and warehouse
lighting upgrades, and compressor replacements. They also made numerous
improvements in water efficiency through water reclamation, smart
landscaping, reduced irrigation, xeriscaping and the installation of
low-flow spray nozzles at galleys. They implemented $13 million in
energy and water efficiency measures that save $1.7 million per year in
utility cost.

Naval Base Point Loma (San Diego)  Navy Small Shore Category. Naval
Base Point Loma has achieved a 25 percent reduction from their FY 2003
baseline. The base combined a strong energy awareness program with
projects such as installing a 57.8 kilowatt photovoltaic system and
replacing a 20-year-old boiler with microturbines and smaller high
efficiency boilers. A focus on locating and repairing water leaks is
saving more than 20 million gallons of water. A $1 million investment in
energy and water initiatives is saving nearly $500,000 annually in
utility costs.

Naval Sea Systems Command&apos;s (NAVSEA) Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and
Intermediate Maintenance Facility (Bremerton, Wash.) - Industrial
Category. NAVSEA Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance
Facility achieved a 13 percent reduction from their FY 2003 baseline.
Their projects included installing rapid access cargo doors and
replacing single pass water-cooled chillers that support waterfront
temporary services. They performed upgrades to exterior lighting,
lighting in temporary offices and in the berthing barges that house
ship&apos;s force when a ship is in overhaul. A project to convert
steam-driven forge hammers to compressed air will significantly reduce
the energy required to maintain the temperature of the hammers when not
in use. Air movers that exhaust welding smoke from ships in overhaul
will be converted from compressed air to electric in most applications.
A total investment of nearly $9 million in energy and water-saving
initiatives is reducing utility cost by $1.7 million per year.

Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC) 29 Palms (29 Palms,
Calif.) - Marine Corps Category. MCAGCC 29 Palms has achieved a 22
percent reduction from their FY 2003 baseline. The combat center
supported a well rounded program including a capital investment of $5
million for energy improvements. Focus was on converting several
buildings from evaporative cooling to chilled water systems with full
Energy Management and Control System (EMCS) packages and extending EMCS
to additional buildings. Other projects included upgrading 15 inoperable
solar water heating systems, installing lighting and photocell controls
and upgrading the EMCS controls for a large chiller. The combined
utility cost savings from these initiatives is more than $1 million
annually.

USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD 6) - Large Ship Category. Bonhomme Richard
saved more than 37,446 barrels of fuel in FY 2007 compared to the LHD 1
class average fuel usage. The $3.6 million in fuel savings is attributed
to a strong command commitment to energy conservation and senior
leadership participation in NAVSEA&apos;s energy conservation seminars and
workshops. As an example of command commitment, the commanding officer
and executive officer conducted weekly tours through all engineering
spaces aboard, assessing methods to improve energy usage. The presence
of senior leadership on the deck plates motivated junior personnel to
participate in energy awareness and aggressive fuel management practices.

USS Nitze (DDG 94) - Small Ship Category. Nitze saved more than 20,500
barrels of fuel in FY 2007 compared to the DDG 51 class average fuel
usage, a savings of nearly $2 million. A strong commitment from senior
leadership was key to their success, demonstrated by extensive all hands
attendance at energy conservation training classes and strict adherence
to implementing energy efficiency checklists. While underway, Nitze
operates in Fuel Efficient Pitch Mode and consistently exhibits 10
percent fuel savings on average. Nitze routinely monitors equipment to
ensure that redundant ship&apos;s systems are left off until they are needed.

The Department of the Navy Energy Program is on target to achieve the
federal goals of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and Executive Order 13423
for efficient use of energy and water resources and the increased use of
renewable energy sources. The program avoids millions of dollars in
annual commodity costs through innovation, investment in energy
efficient technologies and increased community awareness and participation.

To achieve its current success, DoN has relied on a comprehensive energy
program, with centralized resources and program management operating in
partnership with regional and installation level resources and
implementation. As a result of energy program initiatives worldwide, DoN
is avoiding $400 million annually in energy costs, adjusted for
inflation, compared to expenditures in 1985.

NNS081023-18. Navy Commissions Submarine New Hampshire&gt;From the Department of Defense

WASHINGTON (NNS) -- The Navy&apos;s newest attack submarine New Hampshire
(SSN 778) will be commissioned Oct. 25 during a 10 a.m., ceremony at the
Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine.

U.S. Sen. Judd Gregg will deliver the ceremony&apos;s principal address. The
ship&apos;s sponsor, Cheryl McGuinness of Portsmouth, N.H., is the widow of
Lt. Cmdr. Thomas McGuinness, a veteran Navy pilot and co-pilot of
American Airlines Flight 11 which was flown into the North Tower of the
World Trade Center by terrorists Sept. 11, 2001. The ceremony will be
highlighted by a time-honored Navy tradition when McGuinness gives the
order to&quot;man our ship and bring her to life!&quot;The fifth submarine of the Virginia-class, New Hampshire was delivered
eight months early thanks to the Navy&apos;s on-going cost-reduction
initiatives. This will mark the first time since 1996 that the Navy has
commissioned two submarines of the same class in the same year. USS
North Carolina (SSN 777) was commissioned in May.

Through their unique capabilities of stealth and endurance,
Virginia-class submarines directly enable the Maritime Strategy core
capabilities of forward presence, deterrence, sea control, power
projection and maritime security. Equally adept at operating in the
world&apos;s shallow littoral regions and deep waters, New Hampshire will
significantly contribute to the mission areas of anti-submarine warfare;
anti-surface warfare; special operations forces; strike; intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance; irregular warfare; and mine warfare.

Cmdr. Mike Stevens, a native of Tacoma, Wash., will become the ship&apos;s
first commanding officer, leading a crew of approximately 134 officers
and enlisted personnel.

The 7,800-ton New Hampshire was built under a unique teaming arrangement
between General Dynamics Electric Boat and Northrop Grumman
Shipbuilding. New Hampshire is 337 feet in length, has a beam of 34 feet
and can operate at depths greater than 800 feet and at speeds exceeding
25 knots submerged. New Hampshire is also designed with a reactor plant
which will not require refueling during the planned life of the ship,
reducing lifecycle costs while increasing operational availability.

Awareness

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class (SW) Cory Rose, Fleet Public
Affairs Center Atlantic

MOREHEAD CITY, N.C. (NNS) -- Sailors aboard the guided-missile destroyer
USS Gonzalez (DDG 66) volunteered for community relations projects in
and around Morehead City, N.C. Oct. 5.

The projects consisted of visiting a nursing home, picking up trash on a
nearby beach, working with the North Carolina Coastal Federation (NCCF)
and giving tours of Gonzalez to the community.&quot;Whether it is visiting a nursing home, offering a kind word, or lending
a helping hand, the key is to be able to give some of myself to a noble
cause,&quot;said Storekeeper 1st Class (SW) Alhaji Kabba.

Gonzalez Sailors also volunteered their time to help pick up trash at a
local beach.&quot;I am at the beach any chance I get,&quot;said Sonar Technician 2nd Class
Melissa Manley.&quot;So what better way to enjoy the beach and help the
environment at the same time by picking up trash.&quot;Volunteers also helped the NCCF by weeding and mulching a rain garden
used to help reduce polluted storm water run-off from getting into local
waterways.&quot;No matter how big or small the job may be,&quot;said Gas Turbine Systems
Mechanic 3rd Class Chelsea Dodson.&quot;I am extremely proud to be part of
something that can help better the world that we live in.&quot;The crew of Gonzalez also offered the community a chance to see the
inside of a U.S. Navy ship.&quot;Giving tours to nearly 2,000 civilians that have never been on a ship
before can help in a variety of ways,&quot;said Intelligence Specialist 1st
Class (SW) George Holden.&quot;It gives them a more unique perspective on
Navy life and the ships that defend them every day.&quot;Whether in port for a couple days or just one day, giving back to the
community can make a difference.&quot;Any time a family member or Sailor volunteers to do something special
for the community, such as participate in a beach clean-up or make a
visit to a local nursing home, I am overwhelmed,&quot;said Cmdr. Brian Fort,
commanding officer of USS Gonzalez.&quot;I am very glad that we had the
opportunity to put some Sailor power into the community.&quot;For more news from Commander, Naval Surface Force, visit

NNS081023-15. Chief Learning Officer Touts Education as Key to Success
in Navy, War

By Terry Welch, Naval Education and Training Public Affairs

ST. LOUIS, Mo. (NNS) -- The commander of Naval Education and Training
Command (NETC), addressed the St. Louis Naval Academy Alumni
Association&apos;s annual Founder&apos;s Day Dinner Oct. 18 and explained that the
education of service members is the key to winning the war on terrorism.

Rear Adm. Gary Jones explained that the Navy uses everything from
one-on-one mentoring to high tech simulators to prepare Sailors for the
rigors of service at sea and, increasingly, on the ground in Iraq and
Afghanistan. Once they are trained to perform their military duties, the
Navy supports Sailors&apos; personal educations as well, by providing
programs and funding to help them reach their educational goals.&quot;Not only are we getting Sailors better prepared to serve and fight,
we&apos;re also encouraging them to take the steps toward education which
makes them better critical thinkers,&quot;Jones said.&quot;Education, after all,
is not only good for our Sailors, it&apos;s good for our Navy. A Sailor
trained in higher thought can better respond to unique situations, and
it&apos;s also good for our nation.&quot;As Sailors, Soldiers, Airmen and Marines are finding themselves
frequently working shoulder-to-shoulder in this new military era, Jones
added, their training has become more integrated.&quot;If we&apos;re going to fight together, it only makes sense that whenever
possible we should be training together from day one,&quot;Jones said.

Jones also reminded the association members they could still play a role
in the future of the Navy by speaking about their own naval experiences
with people they think would make good Sailors.&quot;Less [than] thirty percent of America&apos;s youth meet the moral, academic,
medical and legal qualifications that would allow them to join the Navy.
Recruiters and the advertising campaigns they use to arouse interest in
the service can only do so much, especially with a generation of
Americans which has grown skeptical about advertising in general,&quot;Jones
said.&quot;What these young men and women need to hear are stories  your
stories  about what the Navy has done for you and what it does for our
country.&quot;For more news from Naval Education and Training Command, visit https://www.netc.navy.mil/. -USN-

NNS081023-17. Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Celebrates 90 Years.

By Seaman Apprentice Aaron Hubner, Defense Media Activity -Anacostia

DAHLGREN, Va. (NNS) -- Service members and civilians stationed at Naval
Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren held a ceremony to celebrate the base&apos;s
90th anniversary Oct. 18.

Attendees enjoyed a variety of activities including a live band, games
for children and a car show. However, the history tent, where veterans
of Dahlgren retold personal accounts of their life on the base, was one
of the most memorable attractions of the day.

Dahlgren opened in 1918 as U.S. Navy Proving Ground but was renamed in
1940 to U.S. Naval Weapons Laboratory to reflect its research efforts
during that time. In 1990, the name was changed to Naval Surface Warfare
Center, and now the base is officially part of Naval Support Activity
South Potomac.&quot;I think it&apos;s important to recognize it because we&apos;ve played a very big
part in history, especially in the Navy&apos;s history and our warfighting
capability,&quot;said Capt. Katie Hamft, commanding officer, Naval Support
Activity South Potomac.

Edward Jones, who used to live in Dahlgren and still lives nearby, says
he enjoyed seeing old friends.&quot;I&apos;ve run into people I haven&apos;t seen in 45 years. People I grew up with.
It&apos;s wonderful.&quot;Capt. Sheila Patterson, commander, Naval Surface Weapons Command,
Dahlgren Division, says the base has a proud heritage of supporting the
Navy.&quot;We have tested just about every gun that has been and is currently on a
Navy ship. We&apos;ve continued to for 40 years to support and be a major
part of providing combat and weapons systems to the United States Navy.&quot;During the 1950s, the U.S. Navy produced the first Fleet Ballistic
Missile System. Later, Dahlgren pioneered the development of fire
control and targeting software for missile-borne strategic nuclear
weapons on U.S. Navy submarines. Unknown to the residents of Dahlgren at
the time, scientists working here played a big part in testing
components of atomic bomb. In the 1970&apos;s, Dahlgren provided
comprehensive development and support for the Tomahawk Weapon System.

What began as a gun-test facility has since evolved and expanded to
include numerous scientific and response-force missions serving all
branches of the United States Armed Forces.

NNS081023-06. Sailors in Greece Get&quot;Moneywise&quot;By Paul Farley, Naval Support Activity Souda Bay Public Affairs

SOUDA BAY, Greece (NNS) -- Sailors and civilian employees from Naval
Station (NSA) Souda Bay were the first in Europe visited by a financial
journalist and best-selling author Oct. 20, as part of the&quot;Moneywise&quot;tour sponsored by the Department of Defense as a financial education
initiative.

Kelvin Boston, the host of the award-winning PBS financial series&quot;Moneywise,&quot;is joined on the tour by Young America&apos;s Financial Coach,
Peter Bielagus, author of&quot;Getting Loaded: Get Ready. Get Set. Get Rich.&quot;During the presentations, Boston and Bielagus discussed a variety of
topics that included the importance of knowing individual credit
ratings, the need for savings and investments, and several key elements
to developing a personal financial plan.

When asked, Boston explained what he considered to be the most important
message that he could relay to today&apos;s Sailors.&quot;I think that right now, given that we are trying to deal with probably
one of the most uncertain economies since the Depression that it is
important for Sailors to understand that it is a time for them to be
concerned but not to panic.&quot;They should also keep in mind, that even through this recessionary
period that there are going to be great opportunities to invest in
publicly traded companies, their Thrift Savings Plan, great
opportunities for them to buy a home back in the States that they can
afford, and great opportunities to go back to school and get an education.&quot;The tour events in Europe are open to all service members, civilian
employees and their families and also includes a book give-away and a
book-signing session.

The current&quot;Moneywise&quot;tour is part of a Department of Defense (DoD)
financial readiness campaign. DoD believes the financial well-being of
military members and their families is critical to their quality of life
and is equally critical to the personal readiness required to execute
the military mission.

The tour is scheduled to visit five more installations in Europe
including NSA Naples, Italy; Naval Air Station Sigonella, Sicily; Naval
Station Rota, Spain; Aviano Air Base Aviano, Italy; and Army
Installation Camp Ederle in Vicenza, Italy.

NNS081023-07. Sub Crew Gives Guests Glimpse of Life on Patrol, Underway

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Chantel M. Clayton, Fleet
Public Affairs Center, Det. Northwest

BANGOR, Wash. (NNS) -- Sailors aboard the ballistic missile submarine
USS Maine (SSBN 741) (Blue) had the opportunity to share their
experiences of submarine life with family members during their return to
homeport Oct. 21.

During the final five hours underway during their routine patrol,
approximately 35 family members had the chance to briefly experience
what life is like on a submarine.&quot;It&apos;s a big thrill for them, primarily because so few people have an
insight to what we do on board subs on a daily basis,&quot;said Lt. Cmdr.
Robert Thomas, Maine Blue&apos;s executive officer.&quot;It reminds the crew of
this submarine&apos;s huge significance to their country and also to their
families.&quot;Thomas also said that it was an opportunity for the family members to
see how hard their Sailors work and understand what sacrifices are involved.&quot;When family members have a chance to come down and see what Sailors do
and how they maintain a billion-dollar warship at sea, they understand
how we can keep a ship at sea for a long period of time.&quot;Family members also toured the ship for a better understanding of how
submariners live while underway.&quot;They were able to explore and see some of the spaces on the ship and
see some of the different systems we have here,&quot;continued Thomas.&quot;They
were able to see the control room, look through the periscopes and see
where the crew lives and eats.&quot;Maine offered a look into how the crew operates on a daily basis.&quot;Everything here is very organized, and everyone seems to know their job
very well,&quot;said Charlotte Kelly, mother of Machinist&apos;s Mate 2nd Class
(SS) Levi Kelly.&quot;What I liked the most is seeing my son and being able
to see the environment they live in. It&apos;s always been mysterious. It&apos;s
always hard to describe, and I was glad to finally be able to see it.&quot;For one crew member, this marks the end of one career and the start of
another.&quot;This is my last patrol,&quot;said Chief Electrician&apos;s Mate (SS) Gerald
Herman.&quot;I retire in a few months, and my wife retired from the Navy in
April, and we are about to start a new life. This is the last time I was
able to be underway on board, and I wanted to be able to share this
experience with her.&quot;The ship&apos;s crew hopes to have more family members share this experience
in the future.&quot;We try to do this once a patrol; most of it is dependent on the weather
and our schedule,&quot;said Thomas.&quot;We try to set it up ahead of time so
the family members have time to travel from wherever they are coming
from. Sometimes our schedule changes so frequently that we aren&apos;t able
to do something like this. It is always a great opportunity to have
family members come on board, and we hope to do this again.&quot;For more news from Naval Base Kitsap, visit www.navy.mil/local/kitsap/.

NNS081023-13. Carter Hall&apos;s Combined Religious Ministry Team Cares for Crew

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Katrina Parker, Iwo Jima
Expeditionary Strike Group Public Affairs

USS CARTER HALL, At Sea (NNS) -- A religious ministry team (RMT), which
includes a Canadian chaplain, offers services that impact readiness and
provide a positive influence on the morale and emotional well-being of
the Sailors and Marines aboard the amphibious dock landing ship USS
Carter Hall (LSD 50).

To meet the religious needs of Carter Hall&apos;s Sailors and Marines, the
RMT of Religious Program Specialist 2nd Class Verricchia Eatmon and
Capt. Rory MacDonald, Canadian Forces Army chaplain, offer various
elements including services, sacraments, rites and ceremonies, outreach
programs, pastoral care and counseling, spiritual growth and religious
education.&quot;When spiritual needs are met, it helps bring out the overall character
of the person, which can enable them to do their job in a more positive
and professional manner,&quot;said Eatmon.&quot;Being fulfilled religiously can
help crew members take their minds [off] the stress of their day-to-day
activities and put them in a more comfortable environment.&quot;MacDonald, a member of Naval Station Norfolk&apos;s Operational Ministry
Department&apos;s officer exchange program, which takes chaplains from other
countries and deploys them to serve with U.S. military chaplains, said
that holding religious services aboard can help create a sense of
normalcy for the crew members, despite being out to sea for weeks at a time.&quot;On Sundays we have a routine that is done much across the world,
especially during special times of the year, like Christmas or Easter,
where we can connect with these events although we&apos;re not at home,&quot;MacDonald said.&quot;We may celebrate it in a different way, but hopefully
they are equally as meaningful with just the simple things we have on
the ship and because we have each other.&quot;Informal services are also offered by RMT, to include an&quot;open-door&quot;policy where Sailors and Marines can honestly express issues that are
important to them, whether it is joyous occasions or asking for support
through a difficult time.&quot;Some matters may be beyond a simple solution and require prayer or
support,&quot;MacDonald said.&quot;We are here to give the crew someone to turn
to and provide support away from home.&quot;Integration with crew members is key, and MacDonald said it is important
to take an active interest in the ship&apos;s evolutions and to support
people&apos;s roles through these events.&quot;It is a way to get to know each member,&quot;MacDonald said.&quot;The idea is
to blend in with the activities and environment and come to know these
people and be a support to them.&quot;RMT interaction with the crew can create a command climate of trust,
open communication and mutual support, which affects the overall
readiness of the ship.&quot;It is the simple things we can do that make all the difference,&quot;MacDonald said.&quot;It may be another boring day for some, but it might be
a trying day for others. Just by visiting each member on the ship, we
hope to provide a bit of cheer or support. If there is something small
that is positive or meaningful for someone, I hope that&apos;s the reason why
we&apos;re around.&quot;Carter Hall is deployed to the U.S. 5th Fleet Area of Operations as part
of the Iwo Jima Expeditionary Strike Group to conduct maritime security
operations (MSO). MSO help develop security in the maritime environment.
From security arises stability that results in global economic
prosperity. MSO complements the counterterrorism and security efforts of
regional nations and seeks to disrupt violent extremists&apos; use of the
maritime environment as a venue for attack or to transport personnel,
weapons or other material.

NNS081023-16. Crew May do Triple Take When it Sees Brothers on Bush

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Micah Blechner,
Pre-Commissioning Unit George H.W. Bush Public Affairs

NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (NNS) -- The crew of Pre-Commissioning Unit (PCU)
George H.W. Bush welcomed aboard the third brother from the same family
to serve on the Navy&apos;s newest aircraft carrier.&quot;Hoffman and Hoffman. That sounds like a law firm,&quot;said PCU Bush
Command Master Chief (AW/NAC) Jon D. Port upon meeting the first two
brothers, the Hoffman twins, in August 2006.

Twin Machinist&apos;s Mates 2nd Class Randall G. and Scott K. Hoffman
recently welcomed their older brother, Machinist&apos;s Mate 3rd Class
Richard A. Hoffman.

Randall and Scott, natives of Jaspar, Ind., have been stationed aboard
PCU Bush for two years and currently work in reactor mechanical division
No. 2 plant aboard the ship, which is under construction at the Northrop
Grumman Newport News Shipyard.

They were two of the first crew members to be stationed on PCU Bush.
Scott explained that the most significant change during the past two
years has been the arrival of more than 1,500 additional ship-board
personnel.

One of the most significant additions to the crew occurred when PCU Bush
welcomed the third, and final, Hoffman brother aboard. Richard checked
aboard Sept. 14.&quot;I am excited to be here,&quot;Richard said.&quot;It will definitely be a good
experience being on the same ship together.&quot;Richard is the oldest of the three Hoffman brothers but came into the
Navy last.&quot;My brothers&apos; recruiter tried to get me to join when they signed up,&quot;Richard said.&quot;I told them that I wanted to join, but that I wanted to
finish my associates degree first.&quot;Richard is going through a 10-week training program designed to help
familiarize new machinist&apos;s mates.&quot;I came to the Bush straight from a year and three months of school in
Charleston, S.C.,&quot;Richard said.&quot;The equipment we learn to operate down
in Charleston is much different than the equipment on an aircraft
carrier. The training I am doing right now is essential for me to know
how to do my job on this ship.&quot;Richard explained he is looking forward to completing his training
program and beginning his work; however, he does not think he will be
working directly with either of his brothers.&quot;Our family, our mother specifically, loves that we are all on the same
ship,&quot;Randall said.&quot;Our father was making bets with the rest of the family about the whole
thing,&quot;Scott said.&quot;It was our little running joke, &apos;Why even check to
see where you are going to be stationed? You know you are going to the
Bush. All three of you are going to end up on the same ship.&apos;&quot;&quot;My mother came up with the punchline,&quot;Richard said.&quot;Since we are all
in one place they only have one place to go when it comes to visiting.
They are going to save a lot of money when it comes to it.&quot;For more news from Pre-Commissioning Unit George H.W. Bush (CVN 77),

NNS081023-10. Navy Enlistment Helps Sailor Reunite With Family After 12
Years&gt;From Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 4 Charlie Company Public Affairs

CAMP ARIFJAN, Kuwait (NNS) -- A constructionman from Naval Mobile
Construction Battalion (NMCB) 4 drove to the front gate at Camp Arifjan,
Kuwait Sept. 7 to do something he hadn&apos;t done in 12 years -- see his
parents.

Constructionman Ashrak Ellaboudy on deployment with NMCB 4 to Camp
Arifjan Kuwait was reunited with his family after years of separation
that began at the age of 12.

Ellaboudy took advantage of an opportunity to study abroad and attended
high school in London. After completing high school, he moved to Egypt
where he attended college, earning a degree in electrical engineering.
When he graduated, he left for the United States and began traveling,
starting a life of his own.&quot;Our schedules have just never worked out,&quot;Ellaboudy said. He has
exchanged phone calls and pictures, but hasn&apos;t been able to travel to
see his family.

Once NMCB 4 arrived in Kuwait, Ellaboudy wondered if he would be able to
see his family. After he found out what paperwork he had to fill out he
started work immediately and forwarded the paperwork up the chain of
command.&quot;[My chief] really helped me out, making sure that everything was taken
care of and done properly,&quot;said Ellaboudy.&quot;He even drove me to the
front gate to meet my parents.&quot;Once we got there, it was funny because after we exchanged greetings, we
both remarked how we all had aged,&quot;said Ellaboudy.

Ellaboudy and his family spent the next hour-and-a-half talking.&quot;Sitting there my parents mostly talked to themselves, and I was able to
answer questions and just listen to what was going on,&quot;said Ellaboudy.

Ellaboudy&apos;s mother and father, Fater and Sayd, thanked the command.&quot;We appreciate what the command did for us and thank you for granting
our son&apos;s request.&quot;Ellaboudy has plans to try and visit his family after deployment.

NNS081023-12. Oak Harbor Hospital Offers Reflection, Relief During
Remembrance Walk

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Tucker M. Yates, Fleet Public
Affairs Center, Det. Northwest

OAK HARBOR, Wash. (NNS) -- Naval Hospital Oak Harbor (NHOH) hosted a
remembrance walk along Seaview Trail on Naval Air Station Whidbey Island
Oct. 18, in support of National Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month.

The walk was held in conjunction with the NHOH Resolve Through Sharing
(RTS) Perinatal Bereavement Program to honor the short lives of those
who were taken during pregnancy, birth or in the first days of life.&quot;We&apos;re here for the families who have experienced either pregnancy
losses or infant losses. This is our way to support the families and let
them publicly acknowledge and remember their lost loved one,&quot;said Cmdr.
Rebecca Kiser, NHOH director of Public Health Services.

The day afforded the opportunity for support of the bereaved by friends
and family as well as members of the RTS program. The event opened with
snacks and participants sharing their story and how it affected them.
This was followed by the walk of remembrance and reflection down Seaview
Trail to the Cliffside RV Park beach to throw lavender flowers in the
water in memorial.&quot;It&apos;s just letting them know that we care, and we&apos;re here to support
them,&quot;continued Kiser.&quot;Even if their loss occurred some time ago we&apos;re
still here for them; we still remember them, and want them to know they
can continue to remember their child, and it&apos;s OK.

Kiser also said that the event is an opportunity for the families to
network.&quot;It&apos;s an opportunity to get together with other families who have
experienced the same type of thing so they can network and support each
other as well.&quot;One Navy participant said that, for those who have lost a child, the
experience was difficult at times, but they were glad to have NHOH
provide a venue to cherish the memory of their child.&quot;I think it&apos;s an awesome display of what&apos;s good about the Navy Hospital
here on Whidbey (Island),&quot;said one participant.&quot;When you are
reassigned and go to a new hospital, you lose a little of that personal
sense of people looking out for you and things like this bring that
back. It&apos;s a great thing that they&apos;re doing, and we appreciate it.&quot;For more news from Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, visit

NNS081024-09. Carl Vinson Team Saves Navy $3.5 Million

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class (SW) Candice Villarreal, USS
Carl Vinson Public Affairs

NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (NNS) -- In its effort to get USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70)
out of the shipyards on time and under budget, the level of effort (LOE)
team aboard has saved the Navy about $3.5 million.

The deck department LOE team, created to utilize ship&apos;s force for
various shipboard jobs in place of civilian contractors, spent about
6,500 man-hours to help successfully complete more than 500 production
jobs on board throughout the ship&apos;s refueling complex overhaul (RCOH).&quot;We used to finish all of the spaces on our own, but now we oversee
touch-up work like welding, wiring stud grinding and sanding jobs --
things like that,&quot;said Seaman (SW) Chris Payton.&quot;Basically our goal is
to make sure the work in the ship&apos;s spaces is done properly and safely
and that the level of quality stays high.&quot;Senior Chief Boatswain&apos;s Mate (SW/AW) Edward Marrero said the
department, as a whole, is motivated and set to meet or exceed any goals
that the chain of command has laid out for the crew.

The two-man LOE team is one of five teams in deck department, all
working feverishly to get the aircraft carrier back to pristine
operational condition before the crew gets the vessel underway for sea
trials in March.&quot;We are using our own Sailors to get as much done as possible,&quot;said
Payton.&quot;We can do the work. This is our ship, and we&apos;re the ones that
are going to be taking it back out to sea.&quot;USS Carl Vinson is currently undergoing its scheduled refueling complex
overhaul (RCOH) at Northrop Grumman Newport News shipyard. The RCOH is
an extensive yard period that all Nimitz-class aircraft carriers go
through near the mid-point of their 50-year life cycle.

During RCOH Carl Vinson&apos;s nuclear fuel will be replenished and the
ship&apos;s services and infrastructure will be upgraded to make her the most
state-of-the-art aircraft carrier in the fleet and prepare for another
25 years or more of service.

NNS081024-11. Unique Partnership Aims to Increase Motorcycle Safety

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (NAC) Jason Beckjord, Fleet
Public Affairs Center, Det. Northwest

Silverdale, Wash. (NNS) -- The Commander, Navy Region Northwest Safety
office has implemented a program to better educate, train, and prevent
motorcycle accidents and fatalities by partnering with motorcycle
dealerships around the Puget Sound.

In fiscal year 2008, the Department of the Navy lost 58 Sailors and
Marines to motorcycle accidents.&quot;The impetus of this whole process was a result of Commander, Navy
Installations Command (CNIC) standing up the regions to do sport bike
training,&quot;said Patrick Bolton, CNRNW Safety and Occupational Health
Program Director.&quot;Of the 58 fatalities this past year, 45 happened
while riding sport bikes.&quot;CNRNW currently offers three motorcycle safety courses: the Basic Rider
Course (BRC), Experienced Rider Course (ERC), and the Motorcycle Sports
Bike Rider Course (MSRC). All of these courses are run by Navy
instructors and are to be taken in accordance with OPNAVINST 5100.12 CH
1, requiring each driver of a motorcycle or moped to complete a Naval
Safety Center-approved motorcycle safety course to ride on a Navy
installation.

Marlon Gomez, a safety specialist with CNRNW, said that the key to
making this happen was speaking with the motorcycle dealerships
throughout the Puget Sound.&quot;They will put our stands, cards, and flyers out with all of the course
information, the OPNAV instruction, and contact info for class sign-up,&quot;said Gomez.&quot;Once a Sailor or Marine has been identified, they will pass
along all of this information. They will place this information at their
service counter, parts counter, sales counter and finance department.&quot;Gomez also said that a safety specialist will travel around to some of
the dealerships on a monthly basis to evaluate the program and replenish
the supplies.&quot;This will have a positive effect on riders in the Puget Sound,&quot;said
Tom Bruno, Brother&apos;s Powersports staff, in Bremerton, Wash.&quot;We see
military and their dependents in here on a daily basis; they are a large
part of our business.&quot;Safety is the most important factor when it comes to riding a
motorcycle. Having the information readily available here, as well as on
base, will save lives.&quot;Bolton went on to say that this is a very positive step in ensuring
motorcycle safety within the community.&quot;It&apos;s hard to get to the fleet Sailor on the ship, submarine, or
squadron, but if you can go to the initial point of contact for the
purchase of that motorcycle,&quot;continued Bolton,&quot;then before they buy
the bike they know that they have to come and take required the safety
courses to save lives.&quot;One USS John C. Stennis (CVN 74) Sailor thinks this program will help a
lot more Sailors and Marines realize what the dangers are and will get
more riders into the safety classes.&quot;I don&apos;t ride a motorcycle now, but I plan on it,&quot;said Aviation
Boatswain&apos;s Mate Airman Terrance Weaver.&quot;Maybe they will think twice
about riding a motorcycle, which will definitely save some lives in the
military.&quot;I have a friend who broke seven ribs and lost half his finger in a
motorcycle accident, so I would tell people to honestly think twice
before going out and getting one. Make sure that it is what you really
want, and invest in those classes; the time is worth your life.&quot;For more news from Navy Region Northwest, visit www.navy.mil/local/cnrnw/.

NNS081024-04. Navy Commands&apos; Harbor Survey Aids in Maritime Security Ops&gt;From Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command Public Affairs

STENNIS SPACE CENTER, Miss. (NNS) -- The Naval Oceanography Mine Warfare
Center (NOMWC) and the Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO), in
conjunction with the Navy Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC), completed
a harbor survey of the Hampton Roads area.

The survey, which started Sept. 10, included marking the location of
underwater objects and potential hazards to ship traffic through data
collection, analysis and processing.

The information will support port security and a rapid, effective
response to maritime contingencies. A similar survey was conducted in
Groton, Conn. NAVOCEANO personnel are now processing the data for charts
and other navigation products.&quot;The Navy oceanography community has always been charged with keeping
the fleet safe, and this project affirms that role,&quot;said Capt. Bob
Kiser, commanding officer the Naval Oceanography Operations Command
(NOOC), NOMWC&apos;s higher echelon command.

Military and civilian personnel with NMOWC and NAVOCEANO, augmented with
military personnel from NECC, conducted the surveys.

NOMWC, NAVOCEANO and NOOC are based at Stennis Space Center, Miss. NECC
is based at Little Creek, Va. NOOC and NAVOCEANO are fourth echelon
commands under the Stennis-based Naval Meteorology and Oceanography
Command (NMOC). NMOC forecasts atmospheric and ocean conditions,
maintains the Navy&apos;s atomic clock and measures the positions and
movement of celestial bodies worldwide for U.S. Navy operations.

NNS081024-06. Seabees, Bulgarian Engineers Form Partnership, Renovate
School&gt;From NMCB 4 Public Affairs

KOTEL, Bulgaria (NNS) -- Seabees from Naval Mobile Construction
Battalion (NMCB) 4, Detachment Romania and five Bulgarian engineers
wrapped up a joint effort of renovations at a local kindergarten school
here Oct. 16.&quot;It has been a great honor to work with the Americans,&quot;said Bulgarian
Senior Sergeant Krasimir Simeonov.&quot;They take a great deal of pride in
their work.&quot;Work on the school included patching plaster, repainting needed areas,
installing ceramic floor tile in 12 bathrooms, replacing sinks and
linoleum flooring in four kitchens, and refinishing the exterior window
and door trim of the classrooms.

The Seabee crew established a special bond with the Bulgarian engineers
during the project, and though they may not speak the same native
language, they learned a great deal from each other said Builder 3rd
Class (SCW) Mario Molina.&quot;I really learned a lot from them about their construction methods too.
It was the key to completing the project,&quot;said Molina, the crew leader.

New friendships have been formed while improving the quality of life for
the students at the school said Builder 3rd Class Nicholas Babcock, one
of the three Seabees involved in the project.

The school building is also a local historical site which made the
team&apos;s efforts and craftsmanship a significant contribution to aid in
the preservation of Kotel&apos;s past, said one participant.

Missions like these have given NMCB 4 the chance to work with a wide
range of counterparts at different locations around the country further
strengthening partnerships with Black Sea nations.

NNS081024-05. Senior Submarine Officer Mentors Future Officers

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Xander Gamble, Commander,
Submarine Force Public Affairs

NORFOLK (NNS) -- The commander of Submarine Group 2 spoke with Reserve
Officer Training Corps (ROTC) students from Old Dominion University,
Norfolk State University and Hampton University on Old Dominion&apos;s campus
Oct. 9.

Rear Adm. Bruce Grooms discussed the career opportunities and provided
leadership advice.&quot;It was very motivating for nuclear power,&quot;said Midshipman 2nd class
Lisa Brodsky, of Colorado Springs, Colo.&quot;It was [also] cool that he
went through all the platforms. As midshipmen, we aren&apos;t thinking that
far into our possible futures. We are concerned with &apos;what do I want to
do as an ensign,&apos;&quot;she said.

On leadership, he focused on enlisted submariners.&quot;They are smart; they are savvy, and they can read you like a book,&quot;he
said.&quot;They know when you are genuine, and they can tell when you are
hiding something. They want leaders; they want to follow you.&quot;He also stressed the importance of always striving to learn more and not
limiting oneself.&quot;If you asked me when I was young if I ever thought I would be an
admiral, I would have said, &apos;Who, me?&apos; People often don&apos;t do things, not
so much because they are opposed to it, but more often because they just
don&apos;t know about it.&quot;In discussing the submarine force, Grooms began by asking a midshipman
in the audience what he knew about submarines. The midshipman responded,&quot;they drive underwater.&quot;This apparently sounded familiar to Grooms, which became clear as he
further discussed how he became part of the submarine force.&quot;Admiral [Hyman} Rickover sent letters out saying &apos;I want you,&apos;&quot;said
Grooms.&quot;I got one of these letters, and when I went for an interview,
he said &apos;I&apos;ve got you.&apos; And at that point, all I knew about submarines
is &apos;they drive underwater.&apos;&quot;Moving on to address the Navy&apos;s nuclear program, Grooms said,&quot;it
doesn&apos;t matter if you are an engineering major or not.&quot;What matters is your motivation and habits. Sure it&apos;s challenging. But
if you are motivated to make it through and maintain good study habits
and don&apos;t give up, you can make it.&quot;He continued, however,&quot;it&apos;s not like college. In college, they hand you
a 20-chapter book and say &apos;good luck.&apos; We give you a small book which we
want you to know very well, and we are here to help you learn it.&quot;After the brief, the midshipmen and officer candidates asked a number of
questions, with the economy and perceived reduction of force structure
being of concern among the students.&quot;I may lose sleep at night for a lot of reasons, but not my job,&quot;Grooms
said in response.&quot;It is a great time to be in the military. We take
care of our people, both inside and out.&quot;Give yourselves as many opportunities to choose as you can so that your
future can be as bright as you want,&quot;Grooms concluded.

Students say they were energized by Grooms&apos; address.

Officer Candidate Brandon Zoss, of Lufkin, Texas, had previously served
on the Los Angeles-class attack submarine USS Scranton (SSN 756) as a
nuclear machinist&apos;s mate 1st class. He received qualifications for both
submarine warfare and Navy diver.&quot;Since I already knew about the submarine force,&quot;said Zoss,&quot;I was very
interested in the questions [Rear Adm. Grooms] was able to answer about
the direction the submarine force is heading.&quot;For more news from Commander, Submarine Force, visit

NNS081024-13. Hangar Upgrades Bring NAF El Centro Facilities into 21st
Century

By Lee H. Saunders, Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest
Public Affairs

SAN DIEGO (NNS) -- An $18 million Naval Facilities Engineering Command
(NAVFAC) Southwest construction project to bring hangars at Naval Air
Facility (NAF) El Centro into the 21st century began construction Oct. 17.&quot;The impact of this project will help make the technological leap from
the existing hangars to the modern day facility unequaled on the West
Coast,&quot;said Howard Sweatte, NAVFAC Southwest project manager for the
NAF El Centro hangar project.&quot;The new hangars are targeting the new joint strike fighter among other
aircraft. This project brings hangar support into the 21st century at
NAF El Centro.&quot;Primary contractor T.B. Penick&amp;Sons, Inc. of San Diego began
demolition of three hangars in early September.&quot;The contractor will demo three, single-bay hangars and replace them
with two, double-bay hangers,&quot;said Melinda Russell, NAVFAC Southwest
construction manager for the NAF El Centro hangar project.&quot;The final
result is one additional hangar bay for the base. This will impact the
overall mission of NAF El Centro, by enabling an additional [detachment]
to execute training here.&quot;The two new hangars covering more than 65,000 square feet follow a
modular design that will accommodate the housing of two separate
squadron detachments (DETs) in each hangar for a total of four DETs. The
hangar bays are pre-engineered buildings (PEBs).&quot;This facility is one of the first on the West Coast to use the
translucent roll-up doors,&quot;said Sweatte.&quot;The doors are light weight
and cut down on maintenance from the sliding type that are difficult to
open with dirt that gets in the tracks. The roll-up doors provides day
lighting without the harsh direct sun. They are designed to withstand
160 mph winds.&quot;The project will also include a reflective roof that minimizes solar
heat gain. Sections of the exterior walls include strategically placed
translucent panels that diffuse direct sun. The well insulated hangars
will feature many sustainable elements.&quot;I can&apos;t tell you how excited I am about this project,&quot;said Russell.&quot;Last year, I made the decision to leave active duty and make the
transition to the civilian side of NAVFAC. When I was an ensign
stationed in Guam, I was able to watch another civil engineer corps
officer build a hangar. I have wanted that experience ever since.&quot;I feel incredibly blessed to be a part of this project and really have
a positive impact on our nation&apos;s war fighter.&quot;The project is scheduled for completion in spring 2010.

NNS081024-03. CNIC, NCIS Celebrate Diversity, Hispanic American Heritage
Month

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Joshua Bruns, Commander, Navy
Installations Command Public Affairs

WASHINGTON (NNS) -- Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC) and
Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) hosted a Hispanic American
Heritage Month celebration at the Washington Navy Yard recently, marking
the first joint event for the two commands.

Director of NCIS, Thomas A. Betro, highlighted the importance of
diversity and the Hispanic community.&quot;Mexico is the only country that has more Hispanics than the United
States,&quot;Betro said.&quot;Fifteen percent of the United States, our U.S.
population, is Hispanic.&quot;NCIS Special Agent Frank Hernandez discussed the definition of diversity
before introducing the ceremony&apos;s keynote speaker, Frank R. Jimenez,
general counsel of the Navy.&quot;Through our differences and through our diversity, comes strength,&quot;Jimenez said.&quot;We Hispanics come [from]many countries; our cultural
heritage varies; we are comprised of more than one race, and we fully
populate the entire political spectrum.&quot;&quot;But the one thing that the vast majority of Latinos in this country
have in common, is that we or family members just a generation or two
removed from us, came here purposely from another country to taste
freedom, to taste promise, achievement, to gain a future, and that&apos;s
exactly what the vast majority of us have found here.&quot;Jimenez shared the story of his family&apos;s journey from Cuba to Puerto
Rico and from there to the United States where they settled in Miami. He
spoke of watching his father work two full-time jobs for more than two
decades to support his children going through college and law school.&quot;That is not too unlike the stories of other Latinos who came from
places where they didn&apos;t have such opportunities and made the absolute
most of their opportunities here,&quot;Jimenez said.

Jimenez went on to speak of the promising future of the Hispanic
community and the need for further awareness.&quot;The list of elected Cabinet and other high-ranking positions to which
Hispanics have climbed, is now longer than the list of positions that we
have yet to reach,&quot;Jimenez said.&quot;I have faith, faith in the
benevolence of the American people and in the fundamental animating
principles of this nation.&quot;What makes us all American is a commitment to freedom that is
unparalleled among the countries of this world. So on this day, in
celebration of this month, let&apos;s all rejoice in the wonderful
contributions of Latinos and the glorious future they enjoy in this
country.&quot;Spanning from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15, 2008&apos;s theme for Hispanic American
Heritage Month is&quot;Getting involved: our families, our community, our
nation.&quot;During the joint celebration, CNIC Executive Director, Anne R. Davis,
reinforced the importance of that theme.&quot;Families play an incredibly big role in who you become. The goals you
set for yourself and the way you live your life are very much dependent
on the life you have with your family, and that support is a catalyst to
success.&quot;The strength of a country and the strength of our Navy family is a
function of the diversity and the support that it gives to our folks
wearing uniforms. Strong families build strong communities, and it
strengthens our nation as a whole.&quot;Tony Cox, NCIS deputy assistant director for the perfective operations
department, outlined the history of the event.&quot;Celebrated for just one week, it wasn&apos;t until 1989 that the recognition
evolved into a month-long celebration,&quot;he said.&quot;President Ronald Reagan called it an honor well-deserved and further
expanded the celebration in 1988 by authorizing a congressional request
that National American Hispanic Heritage Week be turned into Hispanic
American Heritage Month.&quot;For more news from Navy Installations Command, visit

NNS081024-10. Roosevelt Sailors Earn Citizenship, Gain Opportunities

By Ensign Michele Rollins and Ensign Kyle Miller, USS Roosevelt Public
Affairs

USS ROOSEVELT, At Sea (NNS) -- Prior to their deployment to support
Maritime Security Operations in the Middle East, Sailors from the
guided-missile destroyer USS Roosevelt (DDG 80) became United States
citizens.

Culinary Specialist 2nd Class Juan Otero; Gas Turbine System Technician
(Mechanical) 2nd Class Petrina Coleman; and Electrician&apos;s Mates Firemen
Sudesh Banskota and Ousman Nyassi all became citizens in the months
prior to Roosevelt&apos;s deployment with the Iwo Jima Expeditionary Strike
Group (ESG). To gain citizenship, each Sailor had to be a legal resident
in America for five years and then pass a test consisting of 10
questions and reading and writing in English.

The oath of citizenship ceremonies completed a long process for each of
these Sailors. Their newly acquired citizenship opened new opportunities
for each Sailor to pursue.

Otero, a native of Mexico, moved to Brooklyn, N.Y., with his family at
the age of four. Upon enlisting in the U.S. Navy, Otero had limited
options on choosing specialty ratings and could not apply for officer
programs due to his citizenship status. He recited the oath of
citizenship July 8. Now, as a U.S. citizen, he is exploring converting
to a different rate and is contemplating applying to the
Seaman-to-Admiral program as he continues his Navy career.&quot;I feel like I can accomplish my goals and my dreams now,&quot;said Otero.&quot;My citizenship has definitely opened up opportunities to me. I can now
switch rates, get a clearance, and the one thing I have been wanting to
do is put in a Seaman-to-Admiral package to become a pilot. That is my
goal and dream, to fly.&quot;Coleman, a native of Jamaica, came to the U.S. in 1988 with her mother
and sister. She became a citizen in a small ceremony in Tampa, Fla.,
Aug. 21, just 7 days prior to Roosevelt&apos;s departure for deployment.
Although she missed the deadline for voting in the upcoming presidential
election, Coleman is excited by the future opportunities she has to
exercise her rights as an American citizen.&quot;I felt excited, like I was finally able to accomplish my dreams,&quot;said
Coleman.&quot;It was one of my life-long goals to get citizenship.&quot;Banskota, a native of Nepal, learned about the Navy&apos;s citizenship
assistance program when he reported to Great Lakes for recruit training.
He completed his paperwork in Jacksonville, Fla., upon reporting to
Roosevelt and gained citizenship July 8. He looks forward to striking
into the mass communication specialist rating, a rate that was not
previously available to him due to citizenship restrictions.&quot;One can become American by birth or by the process of naturalization,
but one can only become a citizen when an individual is preserving and
perfecting the American ideals, celebrating diversity, keeping faith in
liberty, democracy and freedom of expression, and ultimately always be
welcoming to immigrants who have worked so hard to make this nation
uniquely American,&quot;said Banskota.&quot;As an American it was my goal to
become a citizen.&quot;Nyassi, originally from Gambia, Africa, moved to New York in 2003,
leaving behind his family in search of new opportunities. He joined the
Navy in 2006 and became a citizen June 17. Now that he is a citizen,
Nyassi may be able to bring his brother to the United States.&quot;I feel like this is the beginning of a new era for me,&quot;said Nyassi.

The ship&apos;s leadership says each Sailor has been a valuable part of the
Roosevelt team.

Roosevelt is deployed to the U.S. 5th Fleet Area of Operations to
conduct Maritime Security Operations (MSO). MSO help develop security in
the maritime environment. From security arises stability that results in
global economic prosperity. MSO complements the counterterrorism and
security efforts of regional nations and seeks to disrupt violent
extremists&apos; use of the maritime environment as a venue for attack or to
transport personnel, weapons or other material.

NNS081024-12. Dale Jr. Divisions Cross Finish Line at Great Lakes

By Scott A. Thornbloom, Naval Service Training Command Public Affairs Office

NAVAL STATION GREAT LAKES, Ill. (NNS) -- The USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70)
Air department has prepared for a three-day test launch of the ship&apos;s
third and fourth catapults, slated to begin on board Oct. 24.

The graduation of Divisions 383 and 388 also marked the successful
completion of a sponsorship program with popular NASCAR Sprint Cup
driver and owner, Dale Earnhardt Jr.&quot;It&apos;s amazing to know we&apos;re finally finished with boot camp and moving
on toward our careers,&quot;said Airman Heather Martinez, 18, from Thornton,
Colo.
Martinez, the recruit chief petty officer for Division 388 and U.S. Navy
League Award recipient, said there was added emphasis and pressure to do
well because 388 and 383 were sponsored by Earnhardt.&quot;There was a lot of pressure being the Dale Jr. Division because we
wanted to make him proud for sponsoring us.&quot;Martinez, who traveled to Naval Air Station Pensacola, Fla., to attend
Aviation Boatswain&apos;s Mate (Handling)&quot;A&quot;School after graduating from
boot camp, said the focus and concentration of both divisions to make
Earnhardt proud, was the key that led to their induction into RTC&apos;s Hall
of Fame. The pressure to make it into the Hall of Fame was greater after
Division 388&apos;s Recruit Division Commander (RDC), Senior Chief Navy
Counselor (SW) Chris Mandeville, guaranteed to Earnhardt that both
divisions would be Hall of Fame divisions in August.&quot;Yes there was some added stress but not a whole lot,&quot;said Senior Chief
Information Systems Technician (SW/AW) Nancy Smogoleski, RDC for
Division 383.&quot;When you have a division that has a sponsor, you want to
ensure that you represent your sponsor well. When Senior Chief
Mandeville said we would be Hall of Fame, we needed to ensure we
followed through.&quot;Like a NASCAR driver picking up points each week in the Race for the
Cup, each Dale Jr. Division collected the necessary points during their
training weeks at boot camp to be named a Hall of Fame Division. Each
division received enough to carry flags in military knowledge, physical
fitness, battle efficiency, academics and military drill.&quot;It was a little different because of the publicity and the
meet-and-greets with Dale Junior, but other than that not a whole lot in
the way we trained them,&quot;Smogoleski said.&quot;We still treated the recruits like any other recruit. We knew we had to
represent Dale Junior and wanted to ensure that the recruits performed
and they did.&quot;The two Dale Jr. Divisions were part of the Navy&apos;s first-ever national
celebrity-endorsed recruiting program. The concept was green-flagged
this summer at the NASCAR Nationwide Series race at Lowe&apos;s Motor
Speedway in Charlotte, N.C., May 24. Earnhardt drove the No. 83 Navy
Dale Jr. Division Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS to a fourth-place finish. The
first 10 members of the diverse group of men and women were sworn in at
the Charlotte race by the Chief of Naval Personnel, Vice Admiral Mark E.
Ferguson, III, and Earnhardt. Since then, the No. 83 car has been on
display at the USS Midway Ceremonial Drill Hall at RTC.

Along with the No.83, Dale Jr. Division Chevrolet, Earnhardt also owns
the Navy Accelerate Your Life No. 88 Nationwide Series Chevy Monte Carlo
SS driven by Brad Keselowski.&quot;I commend you for the commitment you&apos;ve made and for sticking with it.
And I applaud the Navy for the training and instruction they have given
to you. You are totally different people from when I met you the first
time,&quot;Earnhardt told his recruits during a visit the week before their
graduation.

Earnhardt was unable to attend the graduation due to his racing
schedule. He finished second in the TUMS QuikPak 500 at the Martinsville
Speedway in Martinsville, Va., Oct. 19. Currently, with four races to go
this season, he is ninth in the Sprint Cup Race for the Cup.&quot;Being a Dale Junior fan and having a Dale Junior division meant a lot
to us to be able to represent him. He strives to be number one in
racing, and that is what we strive for here. We teach the recruits to
strive for excellence and to give a 100 percent so when they go to the
fleet they&apos;ll continue to strive for that excellence.

I think it meant a lot to them (recruits) to be able to represent Dale
and to be number one in boot camp,&quot;Smogoleski said.

NNS081024-07. &apos;Gold Eagle&apos; Sailors Scare Up Support in Newport News

By Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Ashley Van Dien, USS Carl Vinson
Public Affairs

NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (NNS) -- Sailors assigned to the Nimitz-class aircraft
carrier USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) participated in a community relations
(COMREL) haunted-house project Oct. 17 at the Newmarket shopping center
in Newport News, Va.

The seven Sailor volunteers, outfitted in Halloween costumes and makeup,
aimed to scare the crowds of people exploring the festive haunted house
throughout the evening. Their ghoulish efforts are part of Carl Vinson&apos;s
partnership with the Peninsula Chamber of Commerce, better known as the
Jaycees.&quot;This is the first year that Carl Vinson has participated in this kind
of event with the Jaycees,&quot;said Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class
(SW) Maja Dyson, community relations coordinator for the command.&quot;I
think all of our Sailors had a good time volunteering, and they were
doing it for a good cause.&quot;The Jaycees, a non-profit organization, focuses on leadership training
through various community projects

The&quot;Gold Eagle&quot;crew received the Project Good Neighbor Flagship Award
for Large Commands Afloat for the last two consecutive years as
recognition for their outstanding contributions to the local community.&quot;After working through long hours and high production levels on the
ship, I think it is wonderful that our Sailors still found time to
volunteer during their liberty hours,&quot;said Dyson.&quot;We have a motivated
crew and some pretty thoughtful Sailors who are always willing to help
out whenever they can.&quot;Although this event provided a unique, seasonal opportunity, Carl Vinson
Sailors participate in numerous COMREL projects in the local communities
year-round.

Of the proceeds earned at the haunted house, 60 percent will benefit
Camp Virginia Jaycee, a campground for the mentally disabled, while the
remaining 40 percent will be used for the organization&apos;s Thanksgiving
and Christmas food donation program.

Carl Vinson is undergoing its RCOH at Northrop Grumman Newport News
shipyard. The RCOH is an extensive yard period that all Nimitz-class
aircraft carriers go through near the mid-point of their 50-year life
cycle.

During RCOH Carl Vinson&apos;s nuclear fuel will be replenished and the
ship&apos;s services and infrastructure will be upgraded to make her the most
state-of-the-art aircraft carrier in the fleet and prepare for another
25 years or more of service.

NNS081026-01. USS New Hampshire Joins Fleet

By Lt. Jennifer Zeldis, Fleet Public Affairs Center Atlantic

KITTERY, Maine (NNS) -- USS New Hampshire (SSN 778), the Navy&apos;s newest
nuclear-powered attack submarine and the fifth of the Virginia-class,
was brought to life Oct. 25 during a commissioning ceremony at
Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.

Cheryl McGuinness served as the ship&apos;s sponsor, and gave the order to
man the ship.&quot;Officers and crew of the USS New Hampshire, come aboard our ship, and
bring her to life,&quot;she said.

McGuinness is the widow of Lt. Cmdr. Thomas McGuinness, a veteran Navy
pilot and a co-pilot on American Airlines Flight 11 that was flown into
the North Tower of the World Trade Center by terrorists Sept. 11, 2001.&quot;These Sailors are standing up for our country, standing up for freedom
and standing up for our protection.&quot;said McGuiness.&quot;It should be comforting to know that their diligence allows all of us
to truly rest knowing that they are keeping watch and that they are
listening for anything that could threaten freedom.&quot;More than 3,500 guests, including the crew&apos;s family and friends,
submarine veterans and Portsmouth shipyard workers, attended the
ceremony welcoming the submarine as the fourth naval vessel to be named
New Hampshire. Approximately 1,000 additional residents of Portsmouth
watched the ceremony on closed circuit television in Portsmouth&apos;s
Prescott Park, across the Piscataqua River, within sight of the ceremony
at PNS.

Sen. Judd Gregg (R-NH) served as the principal speaker during the
ceremony. He praised the men of USS New Hampshire, the shipyard workers,
and paid special tribute to the family members.&quot;Remember, there are families behind all these men serving on this
ship,&quot;Gregg told the audience.&quot;Those families sacrifice too. They have
their Sailors away for months on end. Their courage, energy, vitality
and vigor allow them to go on with their lives so that those Sailors can
do their job of defending our nation.&quot;In addition to all the dignitaries present was a special group of school
children. Students from Garrison Elementary School in Dover, N.H.,
started a letter-writing campaign in 2004, requesting the submarine bear
the name of their state.

New Hampshire arrived at PNS Oct. 19 and was warmly greeted by the
community. The crew was treated to many events, including a lobster bake
and several receptions in the local area. Several crewmembers also
received tickets to watch the National Football League&apos;s New England
Patriots take on the St. Louis Rams Oct. 26.&quot;To have the ship&apos;s motto the same as the state&apos;s motto of &apos;Life Free Or
Die&apos; is especially fitting,&quot;said Cmdr. Michael Stevens, USS New
Hampshire commanding officer.&quot;The New Hampshire and her crew will forge a new legacy that will be
coupled together with the stories and achievements of many great New
Hampshire notables who helped shape the history of the nation and this
great state,&quot;said Adm. Kirkland Donald, director of Naval Reactors.

This is the first time in 12 years that two submarines of the same class
have been commissioned in the same year. USS North Carolina (SSN 777)
was commissioned in May.

Cost-reduction initiatives resulted in USS New Hampshire being delivered
eight months early and $54 million under budget. Some say this is just
one of the reasons why the Virginia class of submarines is becoming a
benchmark for future classes of naval ships.

Through their unique capabilities of stealth and endurance,
Virginia-class submarines directly enable the Maritime Strategy core
capabilities of forward presence, deterrence, sea control, power
projection and maritime security. Equally adept at operating in the
world&apos;s shallow littoral regions and deep waters, New Hampshire will
significantly contribute to the mission areas of anti-submarine warfare;
anti-surface warfare; special operations forces; strike; intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance; irregular warfare; and mine warfare.

NNS081024-15. DOE Awards Navy, Marine Corps for Conservation Initiatives&gt;From Naval Facilities Engineering Command Headquarters Public Affairs

WASHINGTON (NNS) -- After completing a major water reclamation project,
Marine Corps Air Station Miramar (MCAS), Calif., is saving 97 million
gallons of water, translating to a cost savings of $860,000 per year.
This earned the honor of a Presidential Leadership Award for federal
energy and water management awarded Oct. 23 at the Eisenhower Executive
Office Building in Washington.

The Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) Presidential Awards were
established under Executive Order 13123, requiring federal agencies to
improve energy efficiency and management. Under this mandate, the awards
are presented to agency energy management teams for large-scale,
comprehensive organizational efforts showing excellence in the use of
the energy efficiency and management tools.

In 2007, MCAS Miramar tapped into the City of San Diego&apos;s reclaimed
water line running parallel to Miramar&apos;s northern property boundary to
provide reclaimed water for a majority of the MCAS golf course. The
project was a win-win for both the Marine Corps and local government as
it saved more than 97 million gallons of potable water usage and
$860,000 in fiscal year (FY) 2007. As a result of this reclaimed water
project, MCAS Miramar is 15 percent below FY 2006 usage and is currently
tracking 12 percent below the new water baseline set in 2007.&quot;Energy challenges are everywhere. That&apos;s why the Department of the Navy
has a multi-layered approach to energy efficiency, energy security and
energy independence,&quot;said B.J. Penn, assistant secretary of the Navy
for Installations and Environment.&quot;Like MCAS Miramar, we must continually look for opportunities ahead for
embracing energy and water efficiency, increasing the use of renewable
energy, and making it mainstream in all our operations,&quot;he noted.

The Department of Energy (DoE) Federal Energy Management Program Awards
were also presented Oct. 22. DoE recognized six Navy and Marine Corps
commands and individuals for their significant contributions to the
efficient use of energy and water resources in FY 2007 at its 2008
Federal Energy and Water Management Program Awards ceremony in
Washington. The Department of the Navy awardees were honored for their
innovative energy reduction projects that combined are saving more than
$7 million annually.

The DoE Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) works to reduce the
cost and environmental impact of the federal government by advancing
energy efficiency and water conservation, promoting the use of
distributed and renewable energy and improving utility management
decisions at federal sites. Each year FEMP awards federal agencies for
their outstanding work in achieving energy and water efficiencies.

This year&apos;s Navy and Marine Corps winners of the FEMP awards are:

Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division - Carderock Division
collectively achieved a 10.1 percent reduction in energy consumption
versus the fiscal year (FY) 2003 baseline at its three largest
energy-consuming sites, West Bethesda, Philadelphia and Memphis. The
Carderock Division invested $5.1 million in projects that will return
$1.2 million annually in savings. Projects executed include replacing
and repairing cooling towers, installing energy efficient lighting and
heating systems and expanding direct digital controls to allow for more
efficient management of heating and air conditioning in individual rooms.

Naval Facilities Engineering Command Tiger Team - The Naval Facilities
Engineering Command, Washington, D.C.&apos;s Utilities and Energy Cost Saver
Tiger Team, consisting of energy experts from throughout the Department
of the Navy, visits Navy and Marine Corps installations, conducting
energy audits and recommending low-cost and no-cost energy and water
saving opportunities that result in true utility cost avoidance. Since
2005, the Tiger Team has identified almost $10 million in savings
opportunities. In FY 2007 alone installations implemented tiger team
recommendations that totaled $3.5 million and 162,973 million British
thermal units (MBtu) in savings.

Naval Base Ventura County, Point Mugu, Calif. - Naval Base Ventura
County reduced energy use nearly 8 percent from the previous year and
14.5 percent below its FY 2003 baseline. FY 2007 initiatives encompassed
upgrades to warehouse and hangar lighting and to heating, ventilation
and air conditioning (HVAC), plus photovoltaic, daylighting and water
conservation projects. Total investment of $5.4 million in projects and
installation-funded initiatives will return more than $780,000 annually.

Bernard Lindsey, Navy Region Southwest, Utilities and Energy Program
Manager - Bernard Lindsey, utilities and energy program manager for Navy
Region Southwest (NRSW) is in all respects a leader in the Navy Energy
Program and an influential voice in helping to set Navy energy policies.
He and his team of energy management professionals from 10 major
installations in California and Nevada manage an annual utility budget
of $101 million. Under his direction NRSW reduced energy use by more
than 16 percent from the FY 2003 baseline, saving 376,000 MBtu in
energy, conserving 380 million gallons of water and reducing the
region&apos;s utility costs by 9 percent.

Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, Calif. - Camp Pendleton used funding
from the Energy Conservation Investment Program (ECIP) to design and
construct two solar thermal Photovoltaic (PV) arrays at two pools, each
with a 500,000 gallon capacity, that provide daily training of Marine
Corps personnel. This innovative approach to harvesting solar energy
significantly increases the renewable generation capability on Camp
Pendleton while reducing operational costs. An investment of $1.1
million in these solar thermal PV systems will save an estimated
$101,600 in electricity and natural gas costs annually.

Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, San Diego, was the sixth FEMP winner.

The Department of the Navy Energy Program is on target to achieve the
federal goals for efficient use of energy and water resources and the
increased use of renewable energy sources. The program avoids millions
of dollars in annual commodity costs through innovation, investment in
energy-efficient technologies and increased community awareness and
participation.

NNS081024-21. U.S Navy Ships Team with Allied Partners During Joint Warrior

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Joseph R. Wax, Destroyer
Squadron 24 Public Affairs

HMS ARK ROYAL, At sea (NNS) -- Ships led by the commander of Destroyer
Squadron (DESRON) 24 learned a little more about interoperability while
participating in the Joint Warrior Course, a multinational exercise held
off the coast of Scotland, in October.

The exercise allows NATO and coalition navies to explore complex,
real-world scenarios while operating in a multi-platform environment.

For U.S. and British ships involved in the exercise, Joint Warrior was a
unique opportunity to work together with allied partners while providing
each other with key services and logistical support.&quot;If we take anything away from this exercise it is that we are stronger
by working together and leveraging the strengths each one of us has,&quot;said Lt. Cmdr. Gil Ayan, the DESRON 24 material officer.&quot;One of the
great ways to create a bond is at the personal level.&quot;One specific example of how the ships teamed together involved a Sailor
from the guided-missile frigate USS Doyle (FFG 39).

Fireman Ben Stamps, a member of Doyle&apos;s engineering department, was
transported by helicopter to HMS Ark Royal (RO7) to undergo dental work
that his ship couldn&apos;t perform while at sea.&quot;I had a lot of swelling and sharp aching pain,&quot;said Stamps.&quot;Ark Royal
was out operating with us, and they volunteered to help me out.&quot;Stamps said his situation shows how the two navies operate as one team
while working in a joint environment.&quot;They (Royal Navy) have taken me in as one of their own and set me up
with everything I needed,&quot;said Stamps.&quot;They did an excellent job.&quot;In addition to supporting each other with services, the two navies
worked together to solve many logistical issues. Everything from parts
to people were transferred between the U.S. and Royal Navy ships to
accomplish the mission.

The fleet replenishment oiler USNS Leroy Grumman (T-AO 195), which
accompanied the other ships assigned to DESRON 24 to Scotland for Joint
Warrior, spent the entire exercise conducting underway replenishments
with ships of both navies, showcasing the interoperability between
allied maritime forces.&quot;Complex and robust units -- air, surface and under-sea forces -- were
operating together during Joint Warrior,&quot;said Ayan.&quot;It speaks to how
well our coalition nations work together. We have more things in common
than things that are different. If we deploy together as a multinational
force in the future, we&apos;ll be ready because of exercises like this.&quot;Joint Warrior is a multinational exercise designed and run by the United
Kingdom&apos;s Joint Tactical Exercise Planning Staff (JTEPS). Taking part in
Joint Warrior with DESRON 24 were USNS Leroy Grumman (T-AO 195); the
guided-missile frigates USS Doyle (FFG 39), USS Hawes (FFG 53) and USS
Klakring (FFG 42); and the guided-missile destroyer USS Mitscher (DDG 57).

NNS081024-17. Deadline Approaching for Commands to Review Post
Deployment Health Assessments

By Sharon Anderson, Chief of Naval Personnel Public Affairs

WASHINGTON (NNS) -- All commands have until October 31 to complete a
one-time screening of medical records to check if their Sailors have
competed Deployment Health Assessments (DHA) and reassessments as
required by NAVADMIN 207/08. DHAs are required for Sailors who have been
on IA assignment in the USCENTCOM AOR since October 2001.

DHA is mandated by the Department of Defense to screen Sailors prior to
deployment, to identify health concerns after deployment, and to
facilitate appropriate care. The DHA process is designed to identify
stress injuries and other health concerns that require further
assessment or treatment.&quot;DHA process is key to tracking Sailor&apos;s concerns and issues so we
provide the appropriate health care and support,&quot;said Capt. Lori
Laraway Navy Operational Stress Control Coordinator.

Screening is required for all Sailors who either deploy for more than 30
days ashore OCONUS; are members of a deploying unit or deployed
individually on the ground to the CENTCOM AOR; or any time the Commander
exercising operational control specifically determines that personnel
under his command were exposed to a potentially adverse physical or
mental health threat (e.g., a deployed ship conducts operations that
exposed Sailors to contaminants, disease, or traumatic events).

Sailors who rotationally deploy with ships/squadrons afloat are
specifically excluded from the DHA requirement unless they served more
than 30 days with boots on the ground.

DHA consists of:
 Pre-Deployment Health Assessment (PRE-DHA, DD form 2795), conducted
within 60 days prior to deployment.
 Post-Deployment Health Assessment (POST-DHA, DD form 2796), conducted
within 30 days before or after return to home station.
 Post-Deployment Health Re-Assessment (PDHRA, DD 2900), conducted
between 90 and 180 days after return to home station. The PDHRA can be
done in conjunction with the periodic health assessment if time frames
coincide.

Sailors access and complete DHA forms electronically at https://www-nmcphc.med.navy.mil/edha. Command may obtain a pass phrase
for its Sailors by contacting the EDHA help desk at (757) 953-0717/DSN
377 or email: edha@... .

Reserve Sailors can complete the Post Deployment Health Re-Assessment by
contacting the PDHRA call center for a health care provider review:
1-888-PDHRA-99.

To track the DHA process command leaders and medical personnel use the
Medical Readiness Reporting System (MRRS). Commanders can validate
completion of DHAs by individual or larger aggregations using
appropriate UIC&apos;s to produce a MRRS compliance report. Requests for
access or assistance with MRRS can be made by contacting PSC Douglass C.
Davenport, OPNAV N16, by email at mrrspo@... .

Complete guidance and procedures for DHAs is in NAVADMIN 207/08 at
www.npc.navy.mil.

NNS081027-05. NMCRS Provides Relief With Quick Assist Loans

By Mass Communication Specialist Second Class (AW) Peter D. Blair, Naval
Submarine Base New London Public Affairs

GROTON, Conn. (NNS) -- The Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society (NMCRS)
recently announced policy updates to one of its short-term loan
programs, known as the quick assist loan (QAL).

Service members are now eligible for two QALs in their careers.&quot;Everyone has had an emergency situation when they needed a small amount
of funds immediately and didn&apos;t have it. The quick assist loan was
designed specifically for this type of situation,&quot;said Michele
Bilodeau, director of the NMCRS Groton Office at Naval Submarine Base
New London.

Available in Groton since an initial trial period in 2007 and available
society-wide since January 2008, the QAL program was developed as an
efficient and effective lending tool. The aim is to assist Sailors and
Marines with short term, emergent needs such as family emergencies;
housing, utility, food, clothing, medical and dental expenses; or
vehicle and transportation expenses.

The QAL current limit is $300 and is available to any Sailor or Marine
on active duty with no outstanding loans from the society. The loan is
repayable in monthly payments for up to 10 months.&quot;The society is offering this interest-free loan as an alternative to
payday or online loans which are expensive and place service members&apos;
personal information at risk,&quot;Bilodeau said.

To obtain a QAL, service members must visit one of the society&apos;s
full-service centers, such as Groton; emergency offices and shipboard
offices do not offer QALs. Service members should bring a copy of their
Leave and Earning Statement (LES) and their identification card to
apply. They may also expedite the process by filling out an application
available online at www.nmcrs.org.

While the new policy limits QALs, Bilodeau highlighted that the NMCRS&apos;
many other loan products and services remain available to not only
active-duty service members but also to spouses, reservists and retirees.&quot;I encourage all patrons we serve who are in need of assistance to come
to the NMCRS,&quot;said Bilodeau.&quot;We&apos;ll determine which type of assistance
the society offers that would best serve them and also look to assist
with financial counseling.&quot;As of Oct. 1, the NMCRS Groton office has supplied area service members
with 445 quick assist loans totaling more than $129,000.

NNS081027-03. Wounded Warrior Working with Fellow Warfighters in
Civilian Service

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Charley G. Abrams, Naval
Support Activity Philadelphia

PHILADELPHIA. Pa. (NNS) -- Retired Marine Sgt. Jason M. Simms received
the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal during a ceremony held Oct.
21 at the historic Bourse Building, Center City Philadelphia for his&quot;superior performance&quot;in helping fellow Marines at Wounded Warriors
Battalion East.

Wounded Warriors Battalion East, based at Camp Lejeune, N.C., houses
Marines injured in Afghanistan and Iraq, and provides both support and
assistance to them and their families until they return to duty or are
medically discharged and successfully reintegrated into civilian life.

Jason M. Simms, a former sergeant and Swarthmore, Pa., resident, was
injured July 2004 when his light armored vehicle hit an improvised
explosive device while on patrol in Fallujah, Iraq. After his recovery,
he was hired in May 2008 as part of an initiative spearheaded by two
Navy Human Resources Service Center Northeast (HRSC-NE) employees who
sought and found a way to assist Marine veterans recovering from severe
injuries. They aimed to provide the support and resources wounded
warriors need to build federal careers while also positively impacting
an agency&apos;s ability to meet its equal employment opportunity (EEO) and
diversity goals.

Lt.Col. Steven Kelly, Navy Inventory Control Point Director, Energy&amp;Product Support, presented the award to Simms and explained that for two
and a half years, Simms counseled more than 100 Marines at the Wounded
Warriors Battalion. Simms helped them with&quot;their medical issues, their
benefits and helped them deal with the [Veterans Administration] on a
daily basis. He was &apos;human resources,&apos; and that&apos;s the award we are
giving him today,&quot;Kelly explained.

Patricia D&apos;Amico, director, Human Resources Service Center - Northeast
(HRSC-NE) explained in her opening remarks that Simms has already
demonstrated the commitment and responsibility needed in the civilian HR
community and that his&quot;&apos;can do&apos;, responsive attitude, commitment to
getting a task done, and his professional demeanor are exactly the
qualities we seek in our HR assistants and specialists.&quot;&quot;We are delighted that he chose to join the civilian HR community,&quot;she
added.

Joseph Cavicchio and Kathleen M. York who have extensive human resources
experience devised and implemented a plan to assist Marines in creating
effective resumes, helped guide them through the federal job application
process, and contacted managers from various Department of the Navy
commands and activities to market the wounded Marine&apos;s qualifications
and solicit hiring consideration.

Cavicchio, himself a Marine veteran, found a means to this goal by
finding and working with the Wounded Warriors Battalion East program. He
envisioned a&quot;win-win&quot;opportunity for both the wounded Marines and
HRSC-NE-serviced commands and activities and soon recruited York, who
helped bring his ideas to life.

He said he is quick to point out to hiring officials that this
initiative is not just a&quot;feel good&quot;program. Cavicchio said that hiring
Marines is a&quot;good business practice, since Marines are well trained by
the armed services with valuable skills and abilities, vastly
experienced, self-disciplined and adaptable to changing work
environments, tested leaders that are accountable for their actions and
loyal employees who understand the significance of &apos;placing nation above
self.&apos;&quot;For more news from the fleet, visit www.navy.mil.

NNS081024-14. Hispanic Engineering Conference Highlights Navy Opportunities

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Andrew Bliss, Chief of Naval
Personnel - Diversity Directorate Public Affairs

HOUSTON (NNS) -- Navy technical opportunities were highlighted
throughout the Hispanic Engineer National Achievement Awards Conference
(HENAAC) Oct. 9-12.

HENAAC honors outstanding Hispanic American science, technology,
engineering, and math (STEM) professionals. This year, several of the
honorees were Navy members. The event also provides mentors for youth
seeking options in the STEM arena.

During the conference&apos;s College Bowl IX program, college freshmen,
sophomores and juniors participated in team-based competition to sharpen
leadership skills and win scholarships. Two all-Navy teams and a joint
service team were among those who competed.&quot;It&apos;s good to see the interaction between civilian and military
engineers,&quot;said Midshipman 1st Class Robert Harris III, U.S. Naval
Academy.&quot;Participating in the College Bowl was a great experience.&quot;&quot;It helps because it builds team-based skills and spirit, and listening
to others&apos; ideas, we come together to achieve the final solution,&quot;said
Dorimar Morales, University of Puerto Rico student, another College Bowl
participant.

High school students also participated in learning opportunities during
their own event &quot;Viva Technology.&quot;More than 300 students, many of
whom are in Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) programs, took
part in hands-on activities, led by Navy units and other organizations.&quot;Not only are they having fun with the exercises, they appear to be
getting the point that not only are there technological careers
available, there&apos;s a need for professionals, especially in the
military&quot;, said Nick Quinonez, who manages HENAAC&apos;s educational programs.&quot;We hope some of these students become a source pool for technology
awareness in the military one day.&quot;Mid-way through the conference, the Department of Defense (DoD)
sponsored a luncheon celebrating the accomplishments of Hispanic cadets
and midshipmen in military academies and ROTC programs. The awardees
were young men and women who have distinguished themselves in a STEM
education path while dedicating themselves to a life of military service
and representing their institutions with dignity and pride.&quot;I really dedicate myself to academics, but I don&apos;t lose sight that I&apos;m
still in the military&quot;, said Harris, who was an award recipient.&quot;I have
a passion for engineering, and I enjoy what I do.&quot;Other midshipmen receiving recognition were ROTC Marine Corps-option
Midshipman 2nd Class Dominic Chiaverotti, and ROTC Navy-option
Midshipman 3rd Class Nicholas Larounis.

Following the DoD awards luncheon was the Career and Graduate School
fair. This event allowed college students and professionals to interact
with potential employers including the Navy.&quot;There&apos;s a national war on talent for young people, particularly in
science, technology, engineering, and math&quot;, said Vice Adm. Kevin McCoy,
Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command, who spoke at the HENAAC awards
show.&quot;We have tremendous opportunities for the young folks of America
who have those technical skills.&quot;HENAAC wrapped up with its 20th anniversary awards show. Twenty awardees
took the stage, highlighted as outstanding individuals who are top in
their fields in industry, government and the military.

Rear Adm. Patrick Brady, deputy director, Submarine Warfare division and
Commander, Naval Undersea Warfare Center, was selected as one of only
two individuals noted for executive excellence -- along with Thaddeus
Arroyo, chief information officer, AT&amp;T.&quot;I&apos;m very proud of the efforts of the Navy in increasing the science,
technology, engineering and math graduates as well as expanding
diversity. I feel it&apos;s a national imperative to develop these STEM
graduates, not only for the Navy, but for our nation as a whole,&quot;said
Brady.

HENAAC also honors individuals as&quot;luminaries,&quot;recognizing each for his
or her contributions to the Hispanic technical community as a leader and
role model. The Navy had two Luminaries selected in 2008, Capt. Peter
Clarke, director for Personnel, Policy and Training, Naval Nuclear
Propulsion Program; and Ensign Marissa Hobbs, fire control officer, USS
John S. McCain (DDG 56).

Participating in HENAAC is part of an ongoing initiative to develop
collaborative relationships with affinity groups that promote STEM
education among youth. It also contributes to the Navy&apos;s overall culture
of mentoring, providing additional opportunities for professional and
personal growth for Sailors and civilians.&quot;We want our workforce in the Navy to resemble the make-up of America,&quot;said McCoy.&quot;Coming to events like this really feature what these
professionals can bring to us and is a win-win situation.&quot;For more news from Chief of Naval Personnel - Diversity Directorate,

NNS081027-02. Bikers Have Fun, Stay Safe During Motorcycle Round-Up

By Mike Antoine, Naval Staion Ingleside Public Affairs

CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (NNS) -- Nearly 100 motorcyclists serving aboard
Naval Station Ingleside and Naval Air Station Corpus Christi (NASCC)
gathered for a motorcycle safety roundup Oct. 17.

Sponsored by Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA), the event helped
promote professionalism in motorcycling by providing a positive
experience for all, encouraging safe riding strategies and offering
mentors to young or inexperienced riders.&quot;Motorcycle safety is such a hot topic at all levels of the Navy,&quot;said
Chief Aviation Warfare (AW) Paul Hercl, of the CNATRA Safety Office, who
coordinated the event with Cmdr. John Minners, CNATRA assistant chief of
staff for safety.&quot;This has been an &apos;historic&apos; year for vehicular mishaps in the Navy and
Marine Corps,&quot;Hercl continued.&quot;The motorcycle safety round-up was a
positive step in helping achieve Rear Admiral Mark Guadagnini&apos;s goal of
zero motorcycle-related fatalities or serious incidents.&quot;Around 9:30 a.m., motorcyclists from Naval Station Ingleside, Naval Air
Station Corpus Christi and Naval Air Training Command began their
50-mile bike trek in waves. Their route took them through Portland,
Ingleside and Aransas Pass, where they boarded the ferry to Port
Aransas, south on the beach road and back to NAS Corpus Christi.

The riders rested their bikes and bodies at Sunfish Beach, enjoying
barbecue prepared by NASCC Morale, Welfare and Recreation and receiving
additional safety training.

Cmdr. Cary Johnson, of Fleet Industrial Support Center Jacksonville,
Ingleside Detachment, thought the ride was a positive experience.&quot;I believe in motorcycle safety. It actually makes riding more fun.&quot;&quot;The entire event was exceptional,&quot;Hercl continued.&quot;No one got hurt;
no major issues arose, and everyone got some good training.&quot;For more news from Naval Station Ingleside, visit www.navy.mil/local/nsi/

NNS081025-04. FFSC Program Offers Sailor-Focused Programs&gt;From Naval Base San Diego Fleet&amp;Family Support Center Public Affairs

SAN DIEGO (NNS) -- Naval Base San Diego Fleet&amp;Family Support Center
Fleet Liaison Orientation Program informs military leadership of FFSC
benefits and services.

Fleet&amp;Family Support Centers (FFSC) provide military leadership
opportunities to learn about support programs and services available to
Sailors and the chance to assist family members at the center.

The Fleet Liaison Orientation Program (FLO) was established 20 years ago
by Commander, Naval Surface Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet to keep leaders
abreast of current programs available. Today the program has grown into
a full-day orientation with 26 different representatives presenting
information about services and facilities geared toward enriching a
Sailor&apos;s Navy career, family life and off-duty leisure time.

Additionally a waterfront liaison representative is sent to work at the
center on a rotating basis to further enhance awareness of what the
center has to offer.&quot;Because the readiness of Sailors and their families depends on the
knowledge of enlisted leadership, FLO is an invaluable program,&quot;said
Bill Colford, FLO&apos;s technology support manager at Naval Base San Diego.

The programs give leadership an opportunity to talk with FFSC about
obstacles they may face at their command.&quot;Often FFSC will change services to fit the needs of the Sailors and
their families,&quot;said Colford.

For Chief Gas Turbine System Technician (Mechanical) Joey Talob, Naval
Base San Diego Southwest Regional Maintenance Center, the one-day class
was helpful.&quot;I learned far beyond what I had expected. I have already sent two of my
Sailors to participate in the programs I learned about. As the fleet
liaison for my command, I highly recommend this course to all the chiefs
I know.&quot;This&quot;highly recommended course&quot;has now been opened up to first class
petty officers as well. Upon completion of the course, attendees receive
positive documentation of completion (Page 13) for entry in their
service record.

But, there&apos;s more to the program than this one-day class. Throughout the
year, fleet and tenant commands rotate sending representatives to work
at the center. This is an opportunity for leadership to increase their
knowledge by assisting service members and their families.&quot;When I volunteered to be the fleet liaison waterfront representative at
FFSC, I had no idea what was in store for me,&quot;said Chief Fire
Controlman (SS) Christopher J. Moore, USS Bunker Hill (CG-52).&quot;After being greeted by warm welcomes from the FFSC staff, I quickly
realized how much the center can do for my command. I, along with my
fellow chief&apos;s mess have big plans on becoming fully engaged with what
FFSC has to offer our Sailors,&quot;said Moore.

NNS081025-07. Students Who Helped Name the Navy&apos;s Newest Sub Tour
State&apos;s Namesake

By Chief Mass Communication Specialist Dean Lohmeyer, Commander,
Submarine Force Public Affairs

KITTERY, Maine (NNS) -- Several former students of Garrison Elementary
School in Dover, N.H., toured the Virginia-class attack submarine USS
New Hampshire (SSN 778) at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (PNS) Oct. 22,
almost five years after their letter-writing campaign resulted in the
submarine being named after their home state.

The students from Susan Schlapak&apos;s 3rd grade class and several students
from the school&apos;s 6th grade class began an aggressive letter-writing
campaign in January 2004 in an effort to have one of the Navy&apos;s new
Virginia-class sub named New Hampshire.

For months, their campaign inundated members of Congress, senators, the
New Hampshire governor&apos;s office and the office of the Secretary of the
Navy. Their tenacity paid off in August 2004 when Secretary of the Navy
Donald Winter announced in a ceremony held at PNS that the fifth
Virginia-class submarine, SSN 778, would be named USS New Hampshire.

Today, those students are 8th graders and high school juniors who are
proud of their accomplishment.&quot;I first saw [the sub] when it came up the (Piscataqua) River,&quot;said
Cameron Palczynski, a junior at St. Thomas Aquinas High School in Dover.&quot;It&apos;s unbelievable seeing it here now because we had a part in naming
it. It leaves you speechless.&quot;Cameron and many of his fellow students weren&apos;t sure if their project
would be successful.&quot;When I ponder it now, I really didn&apos;t think we had a chance of getting
the sub named New Hampshire,&quot;he said.&quot;But then we wrote a lot of
letters to people like (Congressional Representative) Jeb Bradley and
(Senator) John Sununu, and they helped us get it done.&quot;Several students were excited to take the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
to tour a submarine.&quot;I think it&apos;s really cool,&quot;said Hillary Jorgensen, a junior at Dover
High School.&quot;I didn&apos;t think I&apos;d ever be able to tour a sub in my life.&quot;Mattison Cellucci, also a junior at Dover High School, was just as
surprised as Hillary in how the sub looked from the inside.&quot;It&apos;s not what I expected it to look like in there,&quot;she said.&quot;I
thought it would be more spacious, but it&apos;s really tight.&quot;Mattison and Hillary both were happy to see the result of their
efforts  a submarine named USS New Hampshire.&quot;We&apos;re proud and really excited because we can see the proof of our
efforts,&quot;said Mattison, who will attend the submarine&apos;s commissioning
ceremony Oct. 25.&quot;Not a whole lot of people will have a chance to see the ship
commissioned, but we&apos;ll also know that we had a part in naming it.&quot;&quot;I was kind of surprised they took us seriously in a way because we were
only 6th graders,&quot;said Hillary.&quot;So it&apos;s kind of exciting.&quot;Schlapak clearly remembers the day she and her students learned the
submarine would be named after their state.&quot;We were shocked. We jumped up and started screaming and hugging each
other,&quot;she said.&quot;It was a very exciting moment. Knowing we are now a
part of history is the best part.&quot;Dustin Gray, principal Garrison Elementary School, believes the
experience is a nice honor for the students and school alike.&quot;This is something the students have been looking forward to for five
years, and it will be embedded in their minds for a long time to come,&quot;he said.

New Hampshire will be commissioned during a ceremony Oct. 25 at
Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. The boat is the fifth submarine in the
Virginia class, the first major U.S. Navy combatant vessel class
designed with the post-Cold War security environment in mind.

NNS081027-01.&quot;Viva Technology&quot;Conference Introduces Youth to
Techno-Savvy Navy&gt;From Navy Diversity Directorate Public Affairs

HOUSTON (NNS) -- The Navy partnered with organizers of the Hispanic
Engineering National Achievement Award Conference (HENAAC) during their
20th anniversary event held mid-October to provide high school youth a
glimpse of the opportunities available through naval service.

The hundreds of high school youth who attended&quot;Viva Technology,&quot;co-sponsored by the Department of Defense and considered by some as one
of HENAAC&apos;s signature events, learned about the importance of education
in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). They gained
mentorship and learned about career opportunities in the Navy as well as
in many other organizations.&quot;There&apos;s a national war on talent for young people, particularly in
science, technology, engineering, and math,&quot;said Vice Adm. Kevin McCoy,
commander, Naval Sea Systems Command, who spoke at the HENAAC awards
gala.&quot;We have tremendous opportunities for the young folks of America
who have those technical skills.&quot;&quot;Viva Technology&quot;brought together more than 300 high school students
from the Houston area to participate in hands-on, interactive activities
and learning experiences. It gave the Navy, an opportunity to showcase
some of the exciting options available in STEM-related career paths 
both Sailor and civilian.&quot;Not only are they having fun with the exercises, they appear to be
getting the point that not only are there technological careers
available, there&apos;s a need for professionals, especially in the
military,&quot;said Nick Quinonez, manager for all educational programs for
HENAAC.&quot;We hope some of these students become a source pool for
technology awareness in the military one day.&quot;The students, from grades 9-11, participated in challenges like circuit
board exercises, and they visited a mobile museum discovery center.&quot;We must continue to plant the seeds of curiosity in our youngest
students to get them excited about science, technology, engineering and
math and strengthen our efforts to foster the development of current and
future scientists and engineers&quot;, said Rear Adm. Patrick Brady, a HENAAC
award winner for Executive Excellence.&quot;Education is the key to
long-term success, not only for our students but for our nation.&quot;Most of the students were also in Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps
(JROTC) programs at their schools. All had mentors from college ROTC
programs who helped guide the participants through their exercises.

Some of the mentors say they enjoyed the experience as much as the high
schoolers.&quot;It&apos;s interesting to see how students tackle the challenge,&quot;said
Midshipman 4th Class Kathleen Wellman, JROTC mentor and ROTC student.&quot;This experience allows me to also have a leadership position.&quot;HENAAC&apos;s Viva Technology Program is designed to engage inner-city and
rural K-12 students, teachers and parents in the applications of
technology. The program aims to stimulate interest and academic
achievement in math, science and engineering, thereby laying the
foundation for students to select and succeed in college and university
degree programs leading to careers in science, engineering and technology.

Collaborations that encourage STEM learning among youth are part of the
Navy&apos;s Diversity Outreach Program. Other ongoing initiatives include
Black Family Technology  Salute to Moms and a collaboration with
Purdue&apos;s Minority Engineering Program.

These initiatives help to encourage pursuit of education while raising
positive awareness among communities often under represented in
technology and scientific career paths.

NNS081026-04. NAVFAC, Vendors Share Energy Efficiency Info At Fair

By Oyaol Ngirairikl, U.S. Naval Forces Marians Public Affairs

SANTA RITA, Guam (NNS) -- Kicking off Navy-Marine Corps Energy Awareness
Week, U.S. Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Marianas held
an Energy Fair Oct. 18-19.

Residents from all over Guam took the opportunity to stop by and learn
about recycling, reducing electricity and saving on power bills and
about various appliances and products that could help conserve energy at
home or in their cars.&quot;We&apos;re really glad to have had all these wonderful vendors participating
in our fair,&quot;said Kevin Evans, NAVFAC Marianas energy manager.&quot;We had
a lot of people who were able to come out and get some education, which
is the first key to conservation.&quot;Energy Awareness Week, Oct. 18-24, focuses on reducing reliance on oil
and increasing efforts to use renewable energy resources  both of which
help decrease the amount of carbon released into the environment. During
the two-day fair, Lite, the Navy&apos;s energy awareness mascot, made several
appearances, much to the delight of children.&quot;It&apos;s great to get the kids involved in these events because they&apos;re the
next generation of community leaders  and what they learn from us they
can expand and grow so that energy efficiency becomes an integral part
of their daily lives,&quot;Evans said.

Thomas Quichocho, one of the vendors, said he was glad to have an
opportunity to participate. His company offered solar-powered water
heating appliances and products to help reduce carbon emission in cars
while improving mileage.&quot;There are so many ways we can help the environment, and using products
that helps conserve energy is a great way to do it because fossil fuels
give off carbon and other gasses that are harmful to our environment,&quot;he said.&quot;And it&apos;s just great to join events like this because I&apos;m
getting a chance to come out, and even if I don&apos;t sell products, I&apos;m
helping to educate our community.&quot;Paul Tobiason, president of the Recycling Association of Guam and a fair
participant noted that education is vital.&quot;Having recycling programs and products that promote energy conservation
is great, but these are nothing if we lack the mindset to use these
programs and products,&quot;he said.&quot;As an island community, we&apos;ve come a
long way, but we&apos;re not quite there yet in terms of ensuring that
everyone throws their aluminum cans in the bin for cans and the paper in
the bins for paper so they can be easily recycled. But we&apos;re getting
there, and that&apos;s because we&apos;re continuing to educate.&quot;For more news from U.S. Naval Forces, Marianas, visit

NNS081026-02. Navy Raises Environmental Awareness Among Guam Youth

By Jesse Leon Guerrero, U.S. Naval Forces Marianas Public Affairs

SANTA RITA, Guam (NNS) -- The U.S. Navy helped students at two Guam high
schools understand sea life and the importance of coral reef protection
as part of the International Year of the Reef 2008 campaign Oct. 1.

Naval Facilities Engineering Command Marianas presented 250&quot;International Year of the Reef 2008&quot;posters to students of George
Washington High School (GWHS) and John F. Kennedy High School at the
GWHS campus in Mangilao.

The posters, which were reprinted and sent to Guam from NAVFAC Pacific,
depict multiple food chains as they cross and connect between marine life.

Ashley Martinez, a 12th grade student and president of the GWHS Marine
Mania club, said the poster is interesting because viewers can draw
conclusions about what affects the ocean.&quot;Say you eat all of one animal, that would affect its predators or the
things that it eats,&quot;she said.

The posters help raise awareness of important environmental issues
during what is now the International Year of the Reef, said Mark Defley,
a NAVFAC Marianas national resources specialist who delivered the
posters that afternoon. International Year of the Reef is a global
project that aims to preserve coral reefs. The Government of Guam joined
that effort when Lt. Gov. Mike Cruz signed a proclamation declaring 2008
to be Guam Year of the Reef.

Surrounded by science students from both schools, Defley discussed the
threats facing coral and how the poster can help them understand life
underwater.&quot;We&apos;re very lucky because very few people and very few students in the
United States can actually see most of these things, even though they
might have the poster,&quot;said Defley.&quot;But here on Guam, they are Guam
creatures.&quot;Defley said the Navy is sharing its resources with the local community
to raise awareness of the issues.&quot;What we want to do is draw attention to that and empower the public and
the people of Guam to take some positive steps to do something good for
our coral reefs that we depend on,&quot;he said.

NNS081025-11. Blue Ridge Has Banner Year by Winning Ney, Promoting
Deserving Sailors

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Peter D. Lawlor, USS Blue
Ridge Public Affairs

YOKOSUKA, Japan (NNS) -- USS Blue Ridge (LCC-19) food services division
capped off one year&apos;s worth of focus and dedication with the addition of
six new chiefs to the culinary specialist rating aboard the Ney
award-winning flagship.

The goals were established when Master Chief Culinary Specialist (SW/AW)
Paul Marshall, leading culinary specialist for Blue Ridge, checked
aboard in May 2007.&quot;Our goals were set high,&quot;said Marshall, who cooked up the team&apos;s
award-winning recipe for success.&quot;Our primary goal was to win the Ney
award. To do so, we developed a training program that not only
emphasized the art of perfecting our rate but also highlighted key
points on how to take an exam.&quot;&quot;Once our goals were established we focused one at a time on the
mission, studying and making sure all objectives were met in preparation
for the Ney,&quot;said Chief Culinary Specialist (SW) Felipe Tubera. He
added that the chain of command was adamant about helping their junior
Sailors advance to the next pay grade by teaching in-rate knowledge book
smarts as well as offering hands on know-how.&quot;When our troops shine, we shine&quot;Tubera&apos;s statement could not have been more correct for the 2008 fiscal
year. The food services division was indeed shining like a star or two
on the tip of a gold-fouled anchor.

First the announcement came Feb. 6 that Blue Ridge was the 2008 Captain
Edward F. Ney award winner (best large afloat platform in the fleet). In
March, Marshall was promoted to master chief and in May, David Jones,
Joselyn Sabas and Micheal Morgan were all promoted to senior chief
culinary specialists.&quot;The promotions kept coming&quot;said Senior Chief Culinary Specialist
(SW/AW) Joselyn Sabas.&quot;Five of nine second class petty officers were
promoted to first class. Six of nine seamen were advanced to third
class, and one third class was promoted to second class.&quot;Sabas said the icing on the cake for the food services division in 2008
was the five first class petty officers who were promoted to chief.&quot;This is a true testament of hard work and dedication to the mission,&quot;said Senior Chief Culinary Specialist (SW/AW) Micheal Morgan.&quot;Hard
work, a can-do spirit and a high level of energy projected daily helped
us to provide a higher level of service to our crew.&quot;Morgan believes the team&apos;s strategic ingredients to bring praise to the
department through earning the Ney and promotions for his crew through
intensive advancement exam preparation culminated and resulted in better
service for the ship&apos;s crew.&quot;Promotions are something you can never get enough of,&quot;said Morgan.&quot;It
is the best morale booster around and higher morale equals higher
productivity and better service. Higher productivity and better service
create happier crews who can in turn perform their jobs better. It all
leads to a higher level of readiness across the board.&quot;Blue Ridge is commanded by Capt. Thom W. Burke and serves under
Commander, Expeditionary Strike Group 7/Task Force 76, the Navy&apos;s only
forward-deployed amphibious force. Blue Ridge is the flagship for
Commander, U.S. 7th Fleet. Task Force 76 is headquartered at White Beach
Naval Facility, Okinawa, Japan, with an operating detachment in Sasebo,
Japan.

NNS081025-08. Naval Special Warfare Hosts Skin Cancer Screening

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SW/AW) Dominique Lasco,
Naval Special Warfare Public Affairs

CORONADO, Calif. (NNS) -- Navy doctors examined dozens of Sailors for
symptoms of skin cancer Oct. 23 at Naval Special Warfare Logistics
Support Unit 1.

Doctors and assistants from the Naval Medical Center San Diego
Dermatology Department conducted the skin cancer screening clinic, which
has become an annual preventive medicine event at Naval Special Warfare.&quot;There are approximately 1.3 million cases of non-melanoma skin cancer
per year in the U.S and approximately 63,000 cases of melanoma,&quot;said
Lt. Paul Nystrom, LOGSU-1 dive medical officer and coordinator of the
event.&quot;This [statistic] is higher in states closer to the equator,
including California.&quot;Sailors who spend much of their time outdoor have increased risk for
skin cancer.&quot;The amount of sun exposure that the special warfare community gets
because of their training requirements makes skin cancer more probable,&quot;said Lt. Cmdr. Stephen Mannino, resident dermatologist at NMCSD.

According to the dermatologist at the screening, skin cancer is easy to
detect in the beginning stages by looking for abnormalities on the skin.
The most common sign is a mole that changes in appearance or is
irregularly shaped. Red, scaly, bumpy patches of skin or sores that
don&apos;t heal are also signs that one might have a form of skin cancer.&quot;There are three major types of skin cancer,&quot;said Mannino.&quot;We screen
for any pre-cancerous lesions first, then the two most common types of
skin cancer: basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.&quot;According to Mannino, these two types of skin cancer are 95 percent
curable with early detection and treatment. However, Mannino speculated
that in America there would be more than one million of these cases
diagnosed this year.

Malignant melanoma, however, has the potential to be deadly. According
to the American Cancer Society, it accounts for 4 percent of cases, but
79 percent of skin cancer deaths.

The screenings performed are simple. Doctors check areas of the skin
that are most exposed to the sun such as the back, chest, neck, arms and
legs. Any spots a patient may have a concern with were examined more
closely with magnifying loops and dermatascopes.&quot;It&apos;s something I think everyone should do at least once a year,&quot;said
Yeoman 1st Class Jorge Vargas.&quot;You never know what you have until you
get it checked out.&quot;Skin cancer awareness has increased. More than 70 special warfare
Sailors made appointments for the screening with many more on the
waiting list. According to Nystrom, there have been only a few cases
needing follow up.&quot;I&apos;ve referred maybe five to 10 patients to dermatology (department) in
the past couple years for suspicious-looking moles,&quot;said Nystrom.

For more information about skin cancer symptoms and prevention, contact
the medical clinic or dermatology department at a local medical center.

NNS081027-04. Chaplains, Civilian Clergy Hone Crisis-Action Skills

By Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Crystal Habbershon, Fleet Public
Affairs Center, Det. Northwest

BREMERTON, Wash. (NNS) -- Military chaplains and civilian clergy
attended a crisis awareness seminar at the Jackson Park Community Center
aboard Naval Base Kitsap Oct. 22, learning how to better assist those in
need.&quot;This course helps us clergy give the tools needed to not only deal with
a crisis but also to cope with a crisis situation,&quot;said Cmdr. Ronald
Sturgis who led the seminar.&quot;We hold seminars like this because it is
not a matter of if a crisis occurs but when it will occur. If we are
prepared then it makes it easier to help in the time of need.&quot;The seminar provided tools needed for chaplains to aid those in need to
the best of their abilities, whether during a personal or a national crisis.&quot;The goal with helping during a crisis is not for me to help you,&quot;said
Lt. Cmdr. Ed Carroll, from Naval Station Everett.&quot;The goal is for me to
give you the tools and encouragement to help yourself.&quot;Chaplains learned the different parts of a crisis, such as accepting the
event, appraisal of the event, resources available and coping methods.
They also learned how to best determine the measures needed to help with
a crisis and sometimes try to avoid one.&quot;Crisis is everywhere,&quot;said Sturgis.&quot;They are situational, and the
severity of the crisis depends solely on the person&apos;s perception of the
event at hand. What you may consider to be a slight misfortune may be a
life-altering crisis to another person.&quot;The seminar was open to all civilian and military chaplains and clergy
from the area who wished to learn new tools to help cope.&quot;Our relationship as clergy is different from a professional counselor,&quot;said Pastor Elizabeth Engel.&quot;We have more mobility and access to the
people and families affected by crisis; along with that, we also offer a
spiritual view, which is oftentimes comforting during a time of need.&quot;For more news from Naval Base Kitsap, visit www.navy.mil/local/kitsap/.

NNS081025-06. Future Sailors Get a Glimpse of Navy Life on Frank Cable

By Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Jacob Sippel, USS Frank Cable
Public Affairs

APRA HARBOR, Guam (NNS) -- Navy Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps
(NJROTC) students from Father Duenas Memorial High School paid a visit
to USS Frank Cable (AS 40) Oct. 24 to show the future Sailors what
happens inside the skin of a United States Navy vessel.

Approximately 79 students from Father Duenas Memorial High School
gathered on the pier outside Frank Cable in anticipation of an exciting day.

NJROTC instructor, retired Master Chief Val H. Separa, said this was a
perfect time to show these students a little bit about shipboard life.&quot;The kids hear me talking all the time about what Sailors do on a daily
basis. Whether it be work related or just talking in the Sailor
language; they don&apos;t get to truly experience the atmosphere until coming
on board a ship,&quot;said Separa.&quot;Now they will have a much better
understanding of what Sailors can do.&quot;During the tour, students went around the ship to different&quot;stations&quot;where subject matter experts waited and explained details about their
jobs. Visited stations included dental, medical, ship&apos;s store, the
bridge, post office and the mess decks.

Though some of the students have already been on a ship, for most this
was a first-time experience.&quot;The ship was a lot bigger than I anticipated,&quot;said cadet Mark
Pangilinan.&quot;I was surprised of how family-oriented everybody was. It
seemed everyone got along with each other, and that made a good
impression on me.&quot;At the end of the tour, the students gathered on the mess decks for
refreshments. When asked by Lt. Sherri Garrett, a chaplain on board, if
they had fun during the tour, the students responded with a resounding&quot;yes&quot;. Then Garrett asked the cadets questions pertaining to USS Frank
Cable and basic Navy knowledge.

Shortly after, USS Frank Cable Commanding Officer, Captain Pat Scanlon,
expressed his appreciation to the cadets.&quot;I hope everyone enjoyed the tour,&quot;said Scanlon.&quot;We appreciate what
you do, and hopefully this gets you interested in the military. It is a
great opportunity that is very rewarding.&quot;NJROTC&apos;s mission is to instill in students in United States secondary
educational institutions the values of citizenship, service to the
United States, personal responsibility and a sense of accomplishment.

As Commander, U.S. 7th Fleet&apos;s only operational submarine tender, Frank
Cable readily deploys to ports throughout the Western Pacific to provide
services to both submarines and surface ships in the Seventh Fleet area
of responsibility.

NNS081025-05. Chief of Navy Reserve Lauds Sailor&apos;s Service in Iraq
During Hometown Visit

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Pat Migliaccio, Navy
Operational Support Center Milwaukee

MILWAUKEE (NNS) -- The Chief of Navy Reserve visited drilling Reservists
at Navy Operational Support Center (NOSC) Milwaukee Oct. 18, recognizing
their service in Iraq, encouraging them to participate in a warrior
transition program and stressing active-Reserve integration.

Vice Adm. Dirk Debbink, a Wisconsin native, covered a wide range of
topics during a visit to his home state, to include the present and
future mission of the Navy. During the visit, he described his vision
for the Navy Reserve.&quot;Support to the fleet, ready and fully integrated,&quot;he said.

During his visit, the admiral asked if there was anyone who had recently
returned from deployment. When Electrician&apos;s Mate 2nd Class Douglass
Kapus of Milwaukee explained he just returned from Camp Bucca, Iraq,
Debbink handed him a Chief of Navy Reserve coin and saluted him.

To the Reservists in attendance, Debbink stressed the importance of
supporting Sailors and their families, especially those returning home
from deployment. He strongly encouraged participation in the Returning
Warrior Workshop (RWW), a program designed to help Sailors adjust back
to civilian life after serving in a war zone.&quot;We need to help out our Sailors in this transition.&quot;said Debbink.&quot;RWW
gives you a chance to reintegrate because given your wartime
experiences, there&apos;s no way you can be who you were before you left for
deployment.&quot;Since his appointment as the Chief of Navy Reserve, Debbink has visited
with Sailors and their families around the country to learn what&apos;s
important to them because he feels he works for them.

Debbink began his Navy Reserve career in 1983 at NOSC Milwaukee.&quot;It&apos;s been fun spending time with you&quot;said Debbink as he scanned the
crowd one final time.&quot;Maybe you too can someday come back to Milwaukee
and do this. Thank you for the privilege of being your Chief of Navy
Reserve knowing you&apos;ll do anything we ask of you.&quot;For more news from around the fleet, visit www.navy.mil.

NNS081025-02. USS Shiloh Strengthens Relations During Visit to Cebu&gt;From USS Shiloh Public Affairs

CEBU, Republic of the Philippines (NNS) -- Sailors from USS Shiloh (CG
67) departed Cebu, Republic of the Philippines Oct. 23 following a
scheduled four-day port visit.

While in port, the ship&apos;s approximately 360 crew members participated in
friendship-building and goodwill-generating activities such as community
relations (COMREL) projects, ship tours, sports competitions and other
cultural exchanges.

During the ship&apos;s visit to Cebu, Commanding Officer, Capt. Alan J.

Crew members from Shiloh visited both Camp Lapu Lapu National High
School and Elementary School. The ship&apos;s volunteers were warmly welcomed
at the high school where they presented donations of school books for
the students. A select group of students performed a traditional
Filipino dance for the crew after the school conducted a patriotic
flag-raising ceremony at the start of the school day. After presenting
the school books to the children, the Shiloh volunteers headed across
the street to the elementary school to join AFP soldiers in painting the
school&apos;s performance stage, as well as several of the school&apos;s other
buildings.&quot;I am proud of our Sailors&apos; volunteer spirit and admire their sincere
desire to help others,&quot;said Senior Chief Electronics Technician (SW/AW)
Mark Sadowski, Shiloh COMREL organizer.&quot;Through their efforts, the
Filipinos who attend Camp Lapu Lapu School gained a favorable impression
of America and its positive role in the region.&quot;After the painting was complete, the Shiloh volunteers headed to the 8th
Annual AFP Central Command (CENTCOM) Sports Festival to attend the
opening ceremony conducted by the Commanding General, Lt. Gen. Pedro I.
Inserto, Philippine Air Force. Following the ceremony, the Shiloh
basketball team played a friendly game against their Filipino partners
from the AFP. The Shiloh team emerged victorious and after the
basketball game, CENTCOM hosted a picnic for all participants and
spectators.

Shiloh is underway on a scheduled deployment in the 7th Fleet area or

NNS081026-03. Pets in Guam May Now Spend Less Time in Quarantine

By Robert Clark, U.S. Naval Forces Marianas Public Affairs

SANTA RITA, Guam (NNS) -- A new law allows pet owners arriving in Guam
to bring their dog or cat home from quarantine weeks, or possibly
months, earlier than previously possible.

Brenda Mader moved to Guam in August after her husband was assigned to
U.S. Naval Hospital Guam (NHG). The attorney of 22 years did some
research, and she learned of an update to a quarantine law allowing pets
to rejoin their owners after as little as five days in enforced quarantine.

The Maders recently had their two cats -- and Bengal and a Tabby --
brought over from Washington. They were able to take their feline
friends home after just a short time in guarantine.

Under the old law, animals would spend months in quarantine while tests
were done to check for rabies resistance.

Public Law 29-112, which was signed by Gov. Felix Camacho in August and
which took effect Oct. 1, shortens the amount of time pets are required
to spend in enforced quarantine, provided they meet vaccination
standards and other basic requirements. This is good news for pet
owners, who must pay for pets held in quarantine.

Mader said that having more time with pets at home and not in quarantine
can make all the difference.&quot;Moving so far away from one&apos;s home is difficult to begin with, and
military families do it all the time,&quot;she said.&quot;One of the things that
makes home &apos;home,&apos; no matter where you go, is your cat purring on your
lap, or your dog waiting for you at your front door, wherever that front
door might be.&quot;Previous rules were&quot;overly cumbersome to individuals visiting or
relocating to Guam,&quot;and pet owners could sometimes be&quot;needlessly
confused by antiquated standards and confusing language,&quot;according to
the new law. The intent of the law is&quot;to enhance efficiency and reduce
confusion in animal quarantine regulation and still maintain a
&apos;rabies-free&apos; designation through stringent veterinary standards.&quot;Mader agreed.&quot;Bringing your beloved pets home early, without an extensive
quarantine,&quot;she said,&quot;makes sense and provides a little more comfort
to the military families who sacrifice so much, year after year.&quot;For more news from U.S. Naval Forces, Marianas, visit

NNS081025-01. Blue Ridge Observes Hispanic Heritage, Diversity

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Josh Cassatt, USS Blue Ridge
Public Affairs

YOKOSUKA, Japan (NNS) -- USS Blue Ridge (LCC 19) observed Hispanic
Heritage Month with a ceremony held on the ship&apos;s mess decks Oct. 22
which emphasized the Navy&apos;s mission accomplishment relies on the wide
spectrum of cultures represented.&quot;Ceremonies like this are a big part of showing respect to different
cultures and they are great way to recognize diversity,&quot;said Capt. Thom
Burke, Blue Ridge&apos;s commanding officer.&quot;The Navy needs everybody
helping out, and we could not do it without everybody.&quot;Burke&apos;s sentiment was shared by Capt. Frederick Pfirrmann, 7th Fleet
chief of staff, who called on Sailors to be mindful of other cultures
and think about why diversity is so important in today&apos;s Navy.&quot;It is very important to celebrate our individual and mutual heritage as
Sailors,&quot;Pfirrmann said.&quot;Diversity is our nation&apos;s and our Navy&apos;s
greatest strength, and each and every one of you is part of that strength.&quot;The celebration included Salsa, Meringue and Bachata dancing by Blue
Ridge Sailors, authentic Hispanic cuisine, special presentations about
famous Hispanic-Americans who served in the armed forces and a guest
speaker of Hispanic descent, Lt. Cmdr. Jose Sanchez, who spoke about his
background and accomplishments in the Navy.&quot;My mother used to say &apos;don&apos;t forget where you came from or where you&apos;ve
been&apos;,&quot;Sanchez said.&quot;Hispanic people share a strong family identity,
and that fits in perfectly with the sense of community in the Navy. We
like sharing our culture with others in the Navy, and celebrating a
different culture every month allows us to do that.&quot;Blue Ridge is commanded by Capt. Thom W. Burke and serves under
Commander, Expeditionary Strike Group 7/Task Force 76, the Navy&apos;s only
forward-deployed amphibious force. Blue Ridge is the flagship for
Commander, U.S. 7th Fleet. Task Force 76 is headquartered at White Beach
Naval Facility, Okinawa, Japan, with an operating detachment in Sasebo,

NNS081024-22. Naples Air Cleared by Public Health Center&gt;From Commander, Navy Region Europe Public Affairs

NAPLES, Italy (NNS) -- The Navy and Marine Corps Public Health Center
(NMCPHC) confirmed there was no significant link between exposure to the
environment in Naples, Italy and severe asthma.

NMCPHC studied asthma as part of the Naples Public Health Evaluation
during a period from October 2006 and June 2008 because of the exposure
military members and their families experienced due to smoke from
illicit trash burning.

The asthma study posed two major questions: Does the frequency and
severity of asthma symptoms worsen for those living in Naples and are
personnel here more susceptible to asthma?

The study examined the housing records and medical visits of U.S.
residents who have been seen by a physician for asthma. Each medical
visit was assigned a severity score ranging from mild-intermittent to
severe. The scores were then averaged to obtain monthly asthma severity;
those averages were compared over time.

NMCPHC&apos;s study used different statistical models to investigate possible
relationships between arriving in Naples before and after widespread
trash burning reportedly began in May 2007 and changes in asthma
severity. The different models did not show any significant association
or trends.

The NMCPHC said it will continue collecting and analyzing medical visit
data for the next six months; an update is expected in June 2009. U.S.
Naval Hospital Naples will continue to provide current residents with
health information on preventing and reducing the severity of upper
respiratory system illness.

The Naples Public Health Evaluation is assessing overall quality of tap
water, soil and soil gas that may impact U.S. personnel and their
families living in the Naples and Caserta Provinces of the Campania Region.

When all elements of the evaluation have been compiled and reviewed a
final report will be completed and a plan of action defined and
implemented to safeguard the health of U.S. personnel and their
families. Until that time, if any health concerns arise, officials will
take action to mitigate those risks.

NNS081024-20. RIVRON 1 Ready to Deploy to Iraq

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class(SCW) Paul D. Williams, Navy
Expeditionary Combat Command Public Affairs

NORFOLK (NNS) -- Riverine Squadron (RIVRON) 1 has completed training for
deployment and is set to deploy in November in support of Operation
Iraqi Freedom (OIF) for the second time in 36 months.

In February 2007, RIVRON 1 was the first riverine squadron to be
commissioned and deploy since the Vietnam era when Navy swift boats
patrolled inland waterways. RIVRON 1 will be the first riverine squadron
to deploy for a second time as part of OIF.

Since their return from Iraq last September, RIVRON 1 Sailors have spent
a lot of time preparing for the upcoming deployment.&quot;It&apos;s a never ending process to refine ourselves,&quot;said Cmdr. Gary
Leigh, the squadron&apos;s commanding officer.&quot;The training cycle starts 30
days after we get home and runs right up to the point we leave for our
next deployment.&quot;During homeport training RIVRON 1 sent detachments to Camp Lejeune,
N.C., to train with the Marine Corps to enhance combat skills. The
squadron also deployed detachments to Fort A.P. Hill and Fort Pickett,
Va., to train riverine Sailors to protect and monitor rivers from attack
or insurgent activities. The training also allowed Sailors to refine
techniques and procedures to secure rivers or small bodies of water from
illegal transportation of weapons, people or materials.

For the upcoming deployment, RIVRON 1 Sailors are not just relying on
their extensive training to successfully complete the mission but also
on their experience. According to Leigh, the squadron&apos;s retention rate
is more than 90 percent. This means nine out of 10 sailors in RIVRON 1
will be deploying to Iraq for the second time.&quot;For the Sailors going back, there is no hesitation; they&apos;re locked on
and motivated to go,&quot;said Leigh.&quot;We are ready to go and start the mission that we were trained to do,&quot;said Engineman 1st Class (EXW/SW) Philip Marshall, one of the Sailors
deploying again.

Protecting and operating in the world&apos;s 113 major river systems can be
an essential part of succeeding in the global war on terrorism. The U.S.
Navy riverine force operating in this brown-water environment proved to
be successful in the past and will continue to be relevant in today&apos;s
unpredictable battlefield.

NNS081024-19. Neptune Response 2009 Increases Contingency Readiness in
Europe

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SW/AW) Marc Rockwell-Pate
Commander, Navy Region Europe Public Affairs

NAPLES, Italy (NNS) -- Commander, Navy Region Europe (CNRE) hosted its
annual training exercise Neptune Response 2009 (NR09) Oct. 22-24 at
Naval Support Activity (NSA) Naples, Italy.

Three of CNRE&apos;s four enduring bases took part in the exercise to enhance
their capabilities to respond and recover from catastrophic incidents.
Naval Station (NS) Rota, Spain, Naval Air Station (NAS) Sigonella,
Sicily, and NSA Souda Bay, Crete, participated in NR09, which was
designed to be as realistic as possible.

Though the operational portion of the exercise was at different
installations around Europe, CNRE staff members provided direction,
intelligence and support at Europe&apos;s Regional Operation Center (ROC) in
Naples.

Raymond Chesney, CNRE&apos;s regional emergency manager, said this exercise
is one of the most effective scenario-based training evolutions in the Navy.&quot;It&apos;s something we don&apos;t test every day,&quot;said Chesney.&quot;But, it is
important to do these tests to understand what short falls we might have
out there. The most important part of this exercise is that we use it to
continue to build and strengthen operational relationships and base
communication in order to be fully prepared for a real-life incident.&quot;Chesney added that NR09 tests each base&apos;s command-and-control element
and how they would communicate up the chain of command. Working through
these types of scenarios helps CNRE get the proper operational and
administrative support from U.S. Europe Command and CNIC for these types
of events.

The exercise consisted of numerous simulated improvised explosive device
(IED) and chemical, biological and radiological (CBR) scenarios. These
scenarios were conducted by non-state actors whose terrorist attacks
were both water and land based.&quot;This drill was very realistic,&quot;said Aviation Boatswain&apos;s Mate
(handling) (AW) Julian Molinar during an interview in Rota.&quot;The drill
planners were using flares and smoke grenades to simulate explosions and
different color gasses in the air. You can&apos;t get any closer to the real
thing.&quot;Molinar, a fire-team crew chief at NS Rota, added the drill opened his
eyes to the importance of good communication skills because his team and
other response teams were working directly with Spanish forces during
the exercise.

The new Shore Force Training Center (SFTC) at Naval Base Coronado (NBC)
Coronado, Calif., also took part in the exercise, marking the first time
SFTC has participated in an exercise. During a phone interview Capt.
B.J. Keepers, who directed the SFTC during the exercise, he said the
facility provided&quot;state-side&quot;support for CNRE&apos;s staff during this
training session.&quot;During this exercise we acted as CNIC&apos;s [Commander, Naval Installations
Command] Installation Support Center, which is actually located in
Washington D.C.,&quot;said Keepers, who works as a department head at CNIC.&quot;Our job here [at CNIC] is to provide administrative support by
providing manning, training and equipment for shore installations. The
training center opened on Oct. 9, and this exercise gave us the perfect
opportunity to continue to provide CNIC&apos;s culture of training and
readiness to the fleet.&quot;NAS Sigonella&apos;s fire chief, who helped coordinate scenarios at
Sigonella, agreed the exercise was an important training opportunity for
everyone involved.&quot;I think it was a great learning experience for all fire emergency
services folks,&quot;said Jim LaConte during an interview with the Sigonella
public affairs office.&quot;There were a lot of coordination issues that we
identified that are going to help us do our job better in the future. I
think we need to do more of these types of exercises.&quot;For more news from Commander, Navy Region Europe, visit

NNS081024-16. Carl Vinson Readies for Cat 3, 4 Tests

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Kristan Robertson, USS Carl
Vinson Public Affairs

NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (NNS) -- The USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) Air Department
has prepared for a three-day test launch of the ship&apos;s third and fourth
catapults, slated to begin on board Oct. 24.

The tests come three years after the aircraft carrier&apos;s original systems
were removed for an extensive overhaul and reinstallment during the
initial stages of the ship&apos;s refueling complex overhaul (RCOH).

Now that the catapult systems have been fully refurbished, rebuilt and
installed, the department&apos;s V-2 division is making final preparations
for the upcoming&quot;no load&quot;launches.&quot;We tested all of the hydraulic and electrical components and have
verified that the system is ready to go,&quot;said Aviation Boatswain&apos;s Mate
(Equipment) 1st Class (AW) Andrew Mudd.&quot;We went through everything,
checked for steam and hydraulic leaks, and we&apos;re ready to run the tests.&quot;Catapult systems, essential for the launch and recovery of embarked
aircraft during at-sea operations, rely heavily on large quantities of
high-pressure steam. Now that enough steam has built up on board, the
V-2 division is&quot;ready to engage,&quot;according to Chief Aviation
Boatswain&apos;s Mate (Equipment) Chris Hinson.

During the tests, a team from Naval Air Warfare Center in Lakehurst,
N.J., will be present to observe and assist Carl Vinson personnel. About
20 launches will be conducted on the catapult systems to ensure they are
operating properly. Catapults one and two were successfully tested
earlier this year.

The tests mark a significant milestone for the&quot;Gold Eagle&quot;crew,
signaling the rapidly-approaching return of the ship to the fleet, where
it will rejoin the American forces in support of maritime security
operations.

Mudd said a successful test will allow the division to focus on its next
milestone: ensuring the ship&apos;s jet blast deflector (JBD) system
functions properly before the ship becomes fully operational and goes
back out to sea.&quot;When we finish up these last two catapult tests, we are going to be
very close to having our equipment fully mission-ready,&quot;said Mudd.&quot;We&apos;re working hard to make sure everything is in excellent condition
and functioning properly so we can get underway.&quot;USS Carl Vinson is currently undergoing its scheduled refueling complex
overhaul (RCOH) at Northrop Grumman Newport News shipyard. The RCOH is
an extensive yard period that all Nimitz-class aircraft carriers go
through near the mid-point of their 50-year life cycle.

During RCOH Carl Vinson&apos;s nuclear fuel will be replenished and the
ship&apos;s services and infrastructure will be upgraded to make her the most
state-of-the-art aircraft carrier in the fleet and prepare for another
25 years or more of service.

NNS081028-07. Assault Craft Unit 4 Enables Maritime Strategy&apos;s Power
Projection Capability

By Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Chad R. Erdmann, Iwo Jima
Expeditionary Strike Group Public Affairs

USS IWO JIMA, At Sea (NNS) -- A detachment of Sailors and Landing Craft
Air Cushion (LCAC) from Assault Craft Unit (ACU) 4 embarked aboard the
multi-purpose amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima (LHD 7) to support
amphibious operations for the Iwo Jima Expeditionary Strike Group (ESG).

The unit based out of Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek, Virginia
Beach, Va., deployed three LCACs, 15 craft crew members, 14 support
personnel and an officer in charge to Iwo Jima for deployment to the 5th
and 6th Fleet Areas of Responsibility.

While on deployment, ACU 4&apos;s primary function is to maintain the LCACs
at 100 percent mission readiness in order to support the ESG as well as
the embarked 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU).

LCACs give the 26th MEU the flexibility to rapidly deploy troops,
vehicular assets and equipment from ship to shore.&quot;We provide the ESG with a means of moving any and all equipment and
personnel needed, aboard or ashore, in a timely manner,&quot;said Chief
Quarter Master Jerrod Morgan, navigator, LCAC 86.&quot;We are able to
conduct patrol missions or move 70 tons of vehicles, equipment or
personnel at speeds up to 50 knots.&quot;ACU 4 has a long history of providing support for a variety of missions.
For the past 10 years, ACU 4 has been involved in major amphibious
exercises and operations in the Arabian Gulf in support of Operations
Desert Shield and Desert Storm.

It also supported humanitarian aid missions in Operation Provide Comfort
in Haiti, in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic after Hurricane
George devastated the area, as well as supported transporting supplies
during Hurricane Katrina relief efforts.

ACU 4 works closely with the embarked 26th MEU in support of beach
operations.&quot;We provide the support that is needed,&quot;said Chief Machinist&apos;s Mate
Michael Waranis, craftmaster, LCAC 87.&quot;We have the ability to provide
rapid transport of any cargo in the Marine Corps inventory with little
regard to terrain.&quot;The ACU 4 detachment consists of a variety of enlisted rates including
quartermasters, boatswain&apos;s mates, operations specialists, gas turbine
system technicians, enginemen and machinist mates. There are also
distinct duties that go along with being assigned to an ACU.

Craftmasters are responsible for ensuring their craft are ready for
operation and the execution of each mission.

Engineers maintain and operate the engineering plant; navigators plot
courses, oversee mission planning and control radio communications while
the loadmasters oversee loading the LCACs and ensure an even weight
distribution on the deck.

During periods when ACU 4 is not conducting amphibious operations, the
detachment dedicates most of its time to performing maintenance on the
unit&apos;s craft.&quot;The craft are fairly maintenance intensive,&quot;said Waranis.&quot;This is due
to the high salt and sand environments we operate in.&quot;&quot;USS Iwo Jima has supported us in every aspect, from berthing, to watch
and warfare qualifications, and craft repair,&quot;concluded Morgan.&quot;They
have helped to ensure that we have the support necessary to complete and
support every mission.&quot;The Iwo Jima ESG is deployed to the U.S. 5th Fleet Area of Operations to
conduct Maritime Security Operations (MSO). MSO help develop security in
the maritime environment. From security arises stability that results in
global economic prosperity. MSO complement the counterterrorism and
security efforts of regional nations and seek to disrupt violent
extremists&apos; use of the maritime environment as a venue for attack or to
transport personnel, weapons or other material.

NNS081028-11. Stennis Bomb Builders Certified to Support Maritime
Security Efforts

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SW) Elliott J. Fabrizio

USS JOHN C. STENNIS, At sea (NNS) -- Weapons department bomb assembly
division (G-3) aboard USS John C. Stennis (CVN 74) earned their Mine
Readiness Certification Oct. 22.

Naval Air Forces Weapons Safety and Training Team inspected Stennis to
ensure their proficiency and accuracy assembling Quickstrike MK-62 mines
while at sea.&quot;During the turn-around training cycle, one of the integral components
of COMPTUEX is our ability to build aircraft-laid mines,&quot;said Stennis
Bomb Assembly Officer Lt. Jason Parmley.&quot;It prepares us and the air
wing to deny any potential foe the ability to use a strategic waterway
or a harbor.&quot;G-3&apos;s aviation ordnancemen practice mine building on a regular basis;
however, five minemen from Mobile Mine Assembly Unit 1&apos;s (MOMAU1)
Carrier Contingency Team provided G-3 with training to further prepare
them for inspection.&quot;They do it every day, while we do it only as required,&quot;said Parmley.&quot;They came out and showed us some nuances and some of the ways they have
learned over the years to expedite building these mines.&quot;&quot;The Stennis Sailors in G-3 have excellent knowledge on how to build a
mine, so we just taught them little tricks we&apos;ve learned, because we do
it all the time,&quot;said Carrier Contingency Team Leader Chief Mineman
(SW) David Epton.

With the help of MOMAU1, Stennis passed the inspection with speed and
accuracy that ranked at the top of the fleet, said Parmley.&quot;We&apos;ve had numerous accolades, including being the fastest and the best
in the fleet, and we hold our guys accountable to it,&quot;said Aviation
Ordnanceman 1st Class (SW) Justin Duran.

After their gear is set up and inspected, G-3&apos;s aviation ordnancemen can
assemble one Quickstrike mine every five minutes, said Parmley. This
enables the ship to store its mines as kits and still be capable of
quickly providing the air wing with mines as needed in an operational
situation.&quot;If we had all these items already built up aboard the ship, they would
occupy an inordinate amount of space,&quot;said Parmley.&quot;It makes a lot
more sense to have these components broken down, and then we can store
them and maximize the space we have on the ship.&quot;With their certification, Stennis is ready to build and use mines to
safeguard waterways and to limit the mobility of enemy ships.

NNS081028-09. New Simulator Provides Realistic Training, Improves Readiness&gt;From Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron 4 Public Affairs

NORTH ISLAND, Calif. (NNS) -- Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron (HSM)
41, the&quot;Seahawks,&quot;unveiled its newest MH-60R flight simulator  the
Tactical Operational Flight Trainer (TOFT) III  at Naval Air Station
(NAS) North Island Oct. 6.

According to HSM-41&apos;s Training Officer Lt. Nate Velcio, the Seahawk&apos;s
student load will increase&quot;tremendously&quot;as the Navy fully transitions
from the SH-60B to the MH-60R.

TOFT III will augment HSM-41&apos;s two other TOFT trainers and enhance the
training capability of NAS North Island&apos;s only MH-60R training squadron.

In addition, TOFT III provides a more robust training vehicle than
versions I and II thanks to upgrades that enhance the simulator&apos;s
communications, navigation, forward looking infrared, radar, weapons and
mission planning systems.&quot;The upgrades are considerable,&quot;said HSM-41&apos;s Training Devices Officer
Lt. Steve Hacker.&quot;They now allow [students] to train to the actual
software and hardware load of the aircraft they will be flying in the
fleet.&quot;TOFT III is the first Seahawk trainer that has the capability to operate
in a&quot;distributed mission&quot; meaning the simulator can&quot;talk&quot;with
simulators in other locations. During combat operations, many different
airframes within the strike group work together to complete the same
mission. This enhanced communication feature allows HSM-41 students to
speak with other flight students training in different types of airframes.&quot;The way the distributed mission function works,&quot;said Hacker,&quot;is the
simulator will be able to link up with other aircraft or surface ship
trainers. It will provide realistic training with the folks we will
actually deploy with  eventually; full-scale exercises will be
performed over distributed networks.&quot;TOFT IV is scheduled for delivery to HSM-70 in Jacksonville, Fla., later
this year.

NNS081028-10. Bataan&apos;s Team Helps Sailors Save Money, Avoid Debt

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SW/AW) Pedro A. Rodriguez,
USS Bataan Public Affairs

NORFOLK (NNS) -- In these tough financial times, the multipurpose
amphibious assault ship USS Bataan (LHD 5) command financial specialists
(CFS) are helping Sailors stay in good financial health.

Aboard Bataan, the CFSs dedicate their time to help Sailors stay out of
trouble with creditors and plan their budgets for a sound financial future.&quot;Our purpose is to educate Sailors and keep them from making bad
financial decisions,&quot;said Chief Aviation Machinist&apos;s Mate (AW/SW) Erick
Medrano, CFS Coordinator.

The latest version of the United States Navy Personal Financial
Management Education, Training and Counseling Program (PFM) is the
OPNAVINST 1740.5B, used since May 7, 2007. It was modified from
OPNAVINST 1740.5A to assign responsibilities for the implementation of
specific requirements that establish a systematic approach to address
PFM issues for Sailors, their families and the Navy.&quot;Before this instruction came out, the Navy was already helping Sailors
with their financial planning,&quot;said Medrano.&quot;When the top leadership
saw the results, they decided to implement the PFM program.&quot;The ship has approximately 15 CFS members who lend their time to counsel
and advise their shipmates on financial matters.&quot;We give personnel all the information and tools available so they can
help themselves create and control their budget,&quot;said Operations
Specialist 1st Class (SW) Amiri Sanders, operations department CFS
representative.

CFSs advise not only Sailors with financial problems but also Sailors
who want to make good decisions when it comes time to make a big
purchase or investment.&quot;The main thing we tell everybody is to live within their means,&quot;said
Sanders.&quot;We tell them not to buy things they may not be able to afford
and take notes of all the transactions they make during the day so they
have an idea on how much money they spent and how much money they have
left in their pocket.&quot;CFSs also present orientations on occasion. These orientations are
intended to educate Sailors about how to have a better understanding on
how to handle their finances.

NNS081028-14. Theodore Roosevelt, Father of Great White Fleet, Remembered

By Chief Mass Communication Specialist (SW/AW) Eric Durie, Navy Office
of Information, East

OYSTER BAY, N.Y. (NNS) -- Residents of Oyster Bay, N.Y., and
representatives of the U.S. Navy gathered in Youngs Memorial Cemetery
Oct. 27 to celebrate what would have been President Theodore Roosevelt&apos;s
150th birthday.

This year marks the 100th anniversary of the Great White Fleet, an
initiative credited to the late President. More than a century ago,
Roosevelt sent 16 battleships with the hulls painted white to
circumnavigate the globe on a goodwill mission and display of American
naval power. The ships were later known as the Great White Fleet.

When a devastating earthquake followed by a tidal wave hit Sicily and
Southern Italy in late 1908, leaving an estimated 200,000 dead, ships
from the fleet rushed to provide essential humanitarian aid and services.

U.S. Navy ships are currently retracing the course of the original Great
White Fleet.

On the former President&apos;s birthday celebrants gathered where both
Roosevelt and his wife, Edith Kermit Carow Roosevelt, are buried. The
cemetery is located less than two miles from the couple&apos;s Sagamore Hill
home on the coast of Long Island.

For the past 90 years, Roosevelt&apos;s grave has been the site of a memorial
service dedicated to remembering the life of the 26th President of the
United States.&quot;This ceremony,&quot;said John E. Hammond, chairman of the Town of Oyster
Bay Historical Commission,&quot;was once attended by kings and queens and
presidents.&quot;Although President George Bush was not able to attend, his office did
send a wreath which was presented by Cmdr. Greg Erickson, commanding
officer, Navy Operational Support Center, Amityville, N.Y. and Cmdr.
Greg Zacharski, executive officer, Navy Recruiting District New York.&quot;It is a great honor for the U.S. Navy to be here representing the
President,&quot;said Erickson after laying the presidential wreath before
Roosevelt&apos;s grave.&quot;Theodore Roosevelt taught us that a strong Navy is
not just a force for war but a force for peace, commerce and diplomacy.&quot;Also in attendance at the wreath-laying were Roosevelt&apos;s great-grandson,
Tweed Roosevelt, and the Honorable Angelo Delligatti, councilman of
Oyster Bay.

Delligatti spoke of Roosevelt&apos;s impact on public servants of the future.&quot;Theodore Roosevelt is an inspiration to anyone who has ever served in
public office, and I am honored to be here.&quot;Following a series of short speeches honoring Roosevelt, students from
Oyster Bay&apos;s Theodore Roosevelt Elementary School sang&quot;America the
Beautiful.&quot;Afterward, Navy Band Northeast played Taps.

The ceremony concluded as the 60 elementary school students in
attendance each laid a rose at the foot of Roosevelt&apos;s grave.

The wreath-laying was followed by a birthday celebration at Roosevelt&apos;s
Sagamore Hill home.

NNS081028-13. NAVFAC Employee Receives National Acquisition Award

By Don Rochon, Naval Facilities Engineering Command Pacific Public Affairs

WASHINGTON (NNS) -- A contracting officer for the Naval Facilities
Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Marianas received the General Services
Administration&apos;s (GSA) prestigious 2008 Ida Ustad Award for Excellence
in Acquisition in a ceremony at the Washington Navy Yard Oct. 27.

Eugene Diaz received the $5,000 award. The annual award is sponsored by
the GSA and recognizes an individual government employee whose actions
demonstrate or embody the concept of a contract specialist as business
leader-advisor and have a major impact on improving the acquisition
process.&quot;This comes as a surprise, but it is truly an honor to receive this
recognition,&quot;said Diaz, who joined NAVFAC Marianas as an intern in
2002.&quot;More so, it&apos;s an honor to have been surrounded by such a
professional acquisition workforce in the different assignments that I
supported. I extend this recognition to all of them.&quot;Diaz is an acquisition professional working for NAVFAC Marianas in Guam.
While forward-deployed to the Philippines, he served as the
administrative contracting officer (ACO) providing oversight of the
operations support contract for Joint Special Operations Task
ForcePhilippines (JSOTF-P). This major contract, an annual value of
approximately $30 million, encompasses 15 functional areas, ranging from
air operations; morale, welfare, and recreation (MWR); facilities
management; utilities; and galley services.

Bob Griffin, NAVFAC assistant commander for acquisition, praised Diaz
for his commitment to NAVFAC and his dedication to the principles
embodied in the award.&quot;His oversight and attention to detail are directly responsible for this
award. He truly embodies excellence in acquisition for NAVFAC.&quot;As the ACO, Diaz was the on-site agent for NAVFAC and served as an
advisor to the JSOTF-P, ensuring the contractor understood the command&apos;s
multi-service requirements.

Diaz was the liaison between the different military services in Hawaii
and the Philippines involved in the contract. He was the driving force
in facilitating communications between all stakeholders and in resolving
any contract interpretation issues. In addition, he was the main
influence in promoting the best practices of NAVFAC operations support
contracting to this remote and challenging location.

Diaz joined NAVFAC Marianas after graduating from the University of Guam
with a degree in accounting. He was selected as the NAVFAC Marianas
Employee of the Year in 2005 and in 2007 was assigned to temporary duty
with the Marine Corps at Quantico, Va., to support the high-profile Mine
Resistant Ambush Protected Systems program.

NNS081028-12. Navy League Recognizes Supply Officers&apos; Contributions to
Fleet Readiness

By Tim Christmann, Naval Supply Systems Command Public Affairs

SAN DIEGO (NNS) -- Five officers received the 2007 Vice Adm. Robert F.
Batchelder Navy League Award during the Supply Corps Junior Officer
Training symposium (JOTS) in San Diego Oct. 24.

The award recognizes supply corps officers who have made significant
contributions to the supply readiness of the Navy&apos;s operating forces.

The award recipients were: Lt. Carl Koch, USS George Washington (CVN
73); Lt. Shawn Morgheim, Commander, Pacific Fleet; Lt. James O&apos;Leary,
USS Hue City (CG 66); Lt. Shannon Walker, Logistics Support Group 2; and
Lt. Christopher Koprivec, Navy Cargo Handling Battalion 1.&quot;It is a great opportunity to congratulate these fine officers,&quot;said
Vice Adm. D. C. Curtis, commander, Naval Surface Forces.&quot;What [these
officers] do every day is well appreciated.&quot;The award ceremony occurred in conjunction with JOTS, which provides a
venue for Junior Supply Corps officers (O-1 to O-4) to discuss current
career development issues and challenges in a peer setting.&quot;This [symposium] provides you with a chance to think about how you can
be a more effective leader,&quot;said Rear Adm. Alan S. Thompson, commander,
Naval Supply Systems Command and Chief of Supply Corps.&quot;We should all
continuously be working to improve our leadership skills.&quot;The JOTS event covered a variety of career-related topics, including

NNS081028-01. Seabees in Kuwait Support Army While Strengthening Skills&gt;From Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 4, Alfa Company Public Affairs

CAMP ARIFJAN, Kuwait (NNS) -- A team of five equipment operators from
Naval Mobile Construction Battalion (NMCB) 4 completed placing a
foundation Oct. 22 for a building, but they&apos;re building a skill set
which will last a lifetime.

Since Sept. 22, personnel from NMCB 4&apos;s Alfa Company have been placing a
foundation that is the half the size of an Olympic-size swimming pool.
Of the five Seabees tasked with the project, four are experiencing their
first deployment; however, the quality of work completed doesn&apos;t
indicate that most of the Sailors were in high school only one year ago.&quot;The work we&apos;re doing right now will last for years,&quot;said Equipment
Operator 2nd Class Michael Ivey, project crew leader,&quot;but we&apos;re gaining
experience and knowledge that will last a lifetime.&quot;The crew has been working with material indigenous to Kuwait and has the
consistency of sand. Getch, normally excavated from the ground, is a
mixture of sand and clay.&quot;It&apos;s not easy to work with, and it&apos;s not forgiving, but because of our
teamwork, we find that we&apos;re doing things few have done before,&quot;said
Constructionman Shane Nance.

To get the consistency they need, the crew mixes the getch with water
and then spreads it on the ground where it is rolled flat and compacted.
The end product is a hard, stable surface on top of the sand that can
support the weight of structures and vehicles.

These pads will be used as a surface on which the transient Army truck
companies of Camp Arifjan will place office buildings. As more
transportation units move in and out of Kuwait, the need for quality
construction is on the rise. The project only required a month to
complete, but the end product will last much longer.&quot;When I was in A-School we had to pass a test, but here our product has
to pass the test of time,&quot;Constructionman Joseph Gibson said.

Coworkers, family members and friends showed their support for their
teams while strengthening their cooperative relationships.&quot;We work with all these guys daily - 24/7, on a professional level,&quot;said CFAS sports coordinator, Master-at-Arms 2nd Class Cody R. Abernathy
of Duncan, Okla.&quot;This event gives us all a chance to kick-back, relax
and get to know each other on a more personal level. We are proud to
show our support in any way we can.&quot;A home-run derby was held to showcase the power of the top sluggers as
they launched the softballs over the fence.&quot;Once you step out on the field, it makes you feel like a kid again, and

buffet enjoyed by the teams and their families as they basked in the
sunny afternoon and festive atmosphere.&quot;It&apos;s great to see such a positive turn out and to bring people of both
countries together like this,&quot;said Wada Kaoru from the CFAS Japanese

NNS081028-05. Sailors, Marines Spruce up Youth Facility, Lift Spirits

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SW) Peter Lewis, U.S. Naval
Forces Marianas Public Affairs

SANTA RITA, Guam (NNS) -- Visiting Sailors and Marines from Combat
Logistics Battalion (CLB) 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) Special
Operations Capable (SOC), currently attached to USS Pearl Harbor (LSD
52), helped spruce up Sanctuary Inc., a local nonprofit community youth
outreach program Oct. 15.&quot;Having the military support us like this really takes some weight off
our shoulders,&quot;said Dawn Cruz, residential supervisor at Sanctuary Inc.&quot;The program does not receive funding for upkeep and maintenance. All of
our time and money is spent helping the kids, so the buildings and
property may get neglected.&quot;It&apos;s a great relief for the military to help us in this area, and it
really solidifies the bond between the military and local civilians.&quot;Sailors and Marines helped with beautification efforts including
painting and general maintenance.&quot;Having a nice, clean place to stay makes the kids feel more safe and at
home,&quot;said Dolores Greenawalt, Sanctuary&apos;s projects coordinator.&quot;Having nice surroundings allows the children to feel comfortable enough
to accept the help they find here. The military&apos;s efforts here are
really helping to save lives.&quot;Sanctuary Inc. provides a variety of services for at-risk youths. The
nonprofit organization is celebrating 37 years of service to the
community. The program has a long history of cooperation with several
commands around Guam as well as with visiting ships and commands.&quot;I enjoy helping people and giving back to the places that I visit,&quot;said Lt. Sunny Mitchell, unit chaplain CLB 15th MEU (SOC).&quot;It is an
honor to serve a community program that serves others. I am thankful I
can be a part of a process to help others get on their feet.&quot;Religious Programs Specialist 2nd Class (FMF) Alexander Ryan Hoffman
also participated in the community relations project.&quot;It&apos;s important to let civilians know that we will always be there to
help them. It feels good to help people who need help and to represent
the Navy and America while doing it. If we can bring one person from a
negative environment to a positive environment, then our efforts have
been worthwhile,&quot;said Hoffman.

NNS081028-04. Guam Sailors Take Part in Youth Anti-Drug Efforts

By Robert Clark, U.S. Naval Forces Marianas Public Affairs

SANTA RITA, Guam (NNS) -- Drug awareness activities took place at the
Guam Premier Outlets Oct. 23-31 in advance of Red Ribbon Week, and
during the events Sailors helped reinforce positive alternatives to
drugs and alcohol.

Red Ribbon Week is an awareness campaign geared toward educating youth,
parents, teachers and organizations about the dangers of alcohol,
tobacco, drugs and violence. Campaign partners include the Drug
Enforcement Administration, Guam Chamber of Commerce, Island Girl Power,
Guam Customs and Sanctuary Inc.

Sailors from Detachment Civic Action Team Guam and Mobile Mine Assembly
Unit 8 and community partners from Talofofo Elementary School, were
present at the Tamuning shopping center Oct. 18 to relate an important
message about drugs and alcohol: Guam&apos;s children have better things to do.&quot;A lot of times students get involved with drugs when there&apos;s something
missing in their life,&quot;said Chief Equipment Operator (SCW) Richard
Zylla. Navy and other coalition partners aim to teach students that&quot;there&apos;s other positive things out there that they can do; they don&apos;t
have to get involved in drugs.&quot;Fifth-grader Lance Camacho agreed. The student council president at
Talofofo Elementary urged his peers to stay drug-free&quot;so they could be
more healthy and stay out of trouble and be good in school.&quot;When asked what young students should do when confronted with drugs or
alcohol, Camacho didn&apos;t need any time to think it over.&quot;Stay away from it!&quot;he said.

Zylla underscored the importance of cooperative anti-drug efforts
between the Navy and the local community. When it comes to keeping
children away from drugs and other substances, it&apos;s all about working
together.&quot;It&apos;s a partnership,&quot;Zylla said.&quot;This is a great way for the military
to get involved in the community. They&apos;re our brothers and sisters here
in Guam and it shows that we care.&quot;For more news from U.S. Naval Forces, Marianas, visit

NNS081028-03. San Antonio Sailors, Marines Honor Beirut Bombing Victims

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class (SW) Brian Goodwin, Iwo Jima
Expeditionary Public Affairs Center

USS SAN ANTONIO, At Sea (NNS) -- Marines and Sailors gathered on the
flight deck of the amphibious transport dock ship USS San Antonio (LPD
17) Oct. 23 to honor their comrades killed during the Beirut bombing 25
years ago.

On Oct. 23, 1983, two truck bombs struck buildings housing U.S. military
forces in Beirut, Lebanon, killing 241 Marines, Sailors and Soldiers.&quot;The Beirut bombing was an event that has stuck with me since I was 16
years old,&quot;said Marine Lt. Col. John Giltz, Combat Logistics Battalion
26 commanding officer.&quot;The weight, tragedy and inspiration have been
with me for 25 years now, and to be a part of today&apos;s ceremony and
remember those who went before us is a moment I&apos;ll never forget.&quot;Giltz addressed his Marines during the ceremony.&quot;We are not invulnerable,&quot;said Giltz.&quot;You are all just like them --
young, full of life, had goals and aspirations. Their lives were taken
in an instant, and so we dedicate ourselves to training and remember
what it is to be a Marine.&quot;San Antonio&apos;s commanding officer, Cmdr. Kurt Kastner, stated the
importance of the event.&quot;Our first duty is to remember,&quot;said Kastner.&quot;That is the motto and
mission of Beirut&apos;s Veteran Association, established in 1992. The second
is to perpetuate the memory of those 241 Sailors, Soldiers and Marines
that gave their lives for their country.&quot;Kastner&apos;s words touched his Sailors.&quot;The speeches made about the Beirut bombing were very motivational in
not letting me forget why we are out here and what we are doing,&quot;said
Hospital Corpsman 2nd Class (SW) Joseph Nayock.

Several of the junior Marines were responsible for putting the ceremony
together.&quot;The Marines that lost their lives in that tragedy were all part of an
amphibious unit, and I thought it would be good for us to honor their
service on an amphibious ship,&quot;said Cpl. Christopher Hrbek.&quot;We as
Marines and Sailors hold a lot of tradition in what we stand for, and to
carry on those traditions is to remember those who have made sacrifices.&quot;Senior leadership was proud of how the junior Marines set up the ceremony.&quot;Many of these types of events are usually handled by staff, COs or
officers, but today it was all corporals and sergeants, the backbone of
leadership,&quot;said Gunnery Sgt. Benjamin McKinney.&quot;It was a very
touching ceremony, and I was moved on how the non-commissioned officers
did it today.&quot;San Antonio is deployed to the U.S. 5th Fleet Area of Operations to
conduct Maritime Security Operations (MSO). MSO help develop security in
the maritime environment. From security arises stability that results in
global economic prosperity. MSO complement the counterterrorism and
security efforts of regional nations and seek to disrupt violent
extremists&apos; use of the maritime environment as a venue for attack or to
transport personnel, weapons or other material.

NNS081028-02. Navy Medicine Info Systems Center Relocates to San Antonio

By Larry Coffey, Navy Medicine Support Command Public Affairs

SAN ANTONIO, Texas (NNS) -- The Navy Medicine Information Systems
Support Activity (NAVMISSA) held a ribbon-cutting ceremony Oct. 21 to
celebrate the command&apos;s arrival in San Antonio.

Navy Medicine&apos;s IM/IT center was reorganized from the Naval Medical
Information Management Center in Bethesda, Md., to NAVMISSA Sept. 1 and
continues steps to become fully operational in San Antonio.

Rear Adm. Richard Vinci, commander, Navy Medicine Support Command
(NMSC), served as guest speaker and spoke about the NAVMISSA team
accomplishments and future changes. NMSC is NAVMISSA&apos;s parent command.&quot;Capt. [Tina] Ortiz (NAVMISSA commanding officer) has led a talented,
hard-working team of what I affectionately call &apos;electronic brainiacs,&apos;&quot;Vinci said.&quot;The team is aligning NAVMISSA with the DoD Military Health
System and TMA (Tricare Management Activity). Their hard work will
ultimately pay off with superior information systems products and
services across Navy medicine.&quot;Providing information systems products and services to Navy medicine is
NAVMISSA&apos;s mission. NAVMISSA also protects Navy medicine networks
through an effective information assurance program that ensures customer
privacy, Ortiz said.

NAVMISSA is projected to employ 149 people when the command is fully
operational in San Antonio in April 2009 and the Bethesda detachment is
closed. The majority of the staff is expected to be hired from the San
Antonio area.

Ortiz said there are several benefits to the San Antonio relocation.
Relocating to San Antonio places NAVMISSA geographically close to its
Army and Air Force service partners but still allows it to remain a
separate command. Economic benefits include the ability to attract and
retain the right work force while realizing significant cost-of-living
reductions when compared to the Washington area.

There will also be benefits to Navy medicine, said Patricia Craddock,
the NMSC M-5 deputy chief of staff who is responsible for NAVMISSA.&quot;As NAVMISSA transitions to San Antonio, they will rebuild the
organization using a new organization map that will be more agile and
capable of responding to the customer&apos;s needs,&quot;Craddock said.&quot;The new
organizational structure will offer stronger program management, which
will match the requirements of a system based on the phase of its
lifecycle  development and deployment, sustainment or retirement, for
instance.&quot;For more news from Navy Medicine Support Command, visit

NNS081029-11. U.S. Forces Participate in SAREX 08

By Chief Mass Communication Specialist (SW) Ray Mooney, Fleet Public
Affairs Center Pacific

HONG KONG (NNS) -- Search and Rescue Exercise (SAREX) 2008  an
international humanitarian exercise involving forces from the U.S., Hong
Kong and the People&apos;s Republic of China - began Oct. 27.

Search and rescue (SAR) units from U.S. Coast Guard District 14 in
Honolulu and the Alaska Air National Guard (ANG) 210th and 212th Rescue
Squadrons in Anchorage will work with SAR teams from Hong Kong&apos;s
Government Flying Service (GFS) as part of the exercise.

As a work-up to the scheduled humanitarian Search and Rescue Exercise
(SAREX) 2008 the Coast Guard and Air National Guard teams spent a week
prior to the exercise getting to know their hosts.&quot;These guys have invited us out on everything that they do,&quot;said Lt.
Col. Tim O&apos;Brien, commander of the 210th Rescue Squadron.&quot;They&apos;ve taken
us out on familiarization flights on their helicopters. We&apos;ve landed on
islands here in Hong Kong. Today our (rescue swimmers) got a chance to
go down the hoist and into the water, and a couple of our guys have even
had the chance to go on actual rescue missions. So they&apos;ve just been
fabulous hosts.&quot;The mission of the Hong Kong GFS is comparable to the SAR mission
practiced by the U.S. Coast Guard and, to some degree, the Air National
Guard, according to ANG 2nd Lt. John Romspert, combat rescue officer.&quot;The GFS is really similar to the Coast Guard,&quot;Romspert said.&quot;The
rescue swimmer and helicopter operations that the Coast Guard does,
they&apos;re very similar in all the roles and missions. We&apos;re similar in
that we do work out of helicopters, but we also have a lot of different
mission sets that they don&apos;t do.&quot;The chance to work with other organizations that perform the same
mission makes everyone better, according to ANG Master Sgt. Peter
Alexakis, aircraft maintenance supervisor.&quot;We have a specific mission that we do for the Air Force and for the
state of Alaska,&quot;said Alexakis.&quot;In doing that, in sharing our mission
with others, if we can learn how to make a better mousetrap, we will.&quot;&quot;Sitting here with these guys has been fabulous,&quot;said O&apos;Brien.&quot;Sitting
here and trading pilot talk, if you will. How do they do water
operations? How do they land on ships? How do we land on ships? What do
they do for operational risk management? How is ours different?&quot;How do they talk a helicopter onto a survivor on a boat? They call it
patter. We call it cockpit communications or crew coordination,&quot;O&apos;Brien
added.&quot;It&apos;s tiny little terminology differences, but it&apos;s amazing how
similar our operations are.&quot;While the U.S. has participated in the Hong Kong SAREX in previous
years, this is the first time a week-long work-up has been built into
the program, according to O&apos;Brien.&quot;Really where the learning takes place is here, it&apos;s in the classroom,&quot;O&apos;Brien said.&quot;If we were to just come in, get a briefing, and then go
out and execute, none of this interoperability piece, none of the
trading of stories, none of that would have happened. So I think this
extra week was well worth it.&quot;The SAR personnel at GFS also recognize the tremendous value in working
with other units.&quot;We don&apos;t want to be the frog at the bottom of the well, looking up at
our small piece of sky and thinking all is well,&quot;said Bowie Fung,
acting senior pilot for the Helicopter Search and Rescue at GFS.&quot;We
want to look outside to other operators, see how they do it. That&apos;s the
main reason we want to operate with you guys. We want to learn, we
always want to improve.&quot;&quot;Everybody gets high value out of working like this because there&apos;s not
a patent on good ideas,&quot;said Romspert.&quot;They do some things different
than we do, and it&apos;s almost like taking a look at your organization from
the outside and seeing how you can improve and what you can do better.&quot;For more news from U.S. Pacific Fleet, visit www.navy.mil/local/cpf/.

NNS081029-15. Continuing Promise Mission Rebuilds Hope in Trinidad and
Tobago

By Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Ernest Scott, Continuing Promise
2008 Public Affairs

PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad and Tobago (NNS) -- Navy Seabee Construction
Battalion Maintenance Unit (CBMU) 202 and the Prime Base Emergency
Engineer Force from the Air Force&apos;s 5th Civil Engineer Squadron have
partnered with service members from Trinidad and Tobago to renovate a
local hostel that provides shelter for women in need Oct. 25-Nov. 7.

The U.S. team embarked USS Kearsarge (LHD 3) is part of the
humanitarian/civic assistance (HCA) mission Continuing Promise (CP) 2008.

St. Jude&apos;s School for Girls provides education for local children and
housing for women in need. St. Jude supports individuals until they are
ready to support themselves. In 2004, a collapsed roof forced St. Jude
to close its Mount Carmel Hostel which housed 38 women.

According to Sister Katrina Charles, manager of St. Jude&apos;s School for
Girls, a lack of funding for repairs caused the hostel to remain closed.
With the assistance of the CP 2008 engineering team and local military
volunteers, repairs are underway, and the hostel will soon reopen.&quot;This is the first time I&apos;ve seen any military do something like this,&quot;said Charles.&quot;We don&apos;t have the money to make the repairs, and without
this help they may not have been made.&quot;The Mount Carmel Hostel has reached out to local women for more than 70
years, providing refuge and hope. The engineers are working hard to
ensure the building can once again be used to provide support and
comfort to those in need.&quot;In addition to the roof, we&apos;ve made repairs to many vandalized areas,&quot;said Chief Equipment Operator Jerry Greer of CMBU 202&quot;We hope to clean
this place up and return it to working order.&quot;Kearsarge Sailors, along with local military service members, are
providing assistance to the engineering team by replacing ceiling tiles,
painting the interior, replacing electrical wiring and installing new
plumbing and new doors.

For Charles, the hostel&apos;s reopening couldn&apos;t come soon enough.&quot;This area is crying out for help. We provide hope, and the hostel
provides the help they need.&quot;Engineers plan to complete all repairs by Nov. 7 in time for a
ribbon-cutting and a closing ceremony for the CP 2008 mission in the
country.

Kearsarge is supporting the Caribbean phase of CP, a joint effort among
the United States, partner nations and non-governmental organizations to
provide humanitarian assistance to South American countries and to build
meaningful, lasting partnerships.

CP provides support by conducting medical, dental and engineering
assistance programs ashore in response to host nation requests and
requirements. The deployment&apos;s goal is to improve health, prolong life,
promote training and enhance prosperity in the region.

The CP Caribbean Phase is the second of two HCA deployments to the
Southern Command area of focus for 2008. The first CP deployment was
conducted by USS Boxer (LHD 4) in the Pacific.

NNS081029-14. Navy Formalizes Support Constructs for All IA Sailors,
Families&gt;From U.S. Fleet Forces Public Affairs

NORFOLK (NNS) -- Individual Augmentee (IA) Continuum leaders announced a
policy update Oct. 17 to identify individual augmentee (IA) Sailor
parent commands and to establish Navywide support for all IA Sailors and
their families, ensuring the same fervor and vigilance that
traditionally deploying Sailors and families receive.

In addition to identifying parent commands, the new policy, in NAVADMIN
293/08 (IA Gram 08-03), identifies specific minimum-levels of support
parent commands are required to provide all three types of IA Sailors
and their families in preparation for, during and after an IA deployment.&quot;With approximately 13,000 Sailors on IA orders, one of Navy
leadership&apos;s top priorities is supporting the mission and communicating
every facet of the IA process with families. Site visits where we talk
to people who have been there or who are going, give us great feedback
to make sure we have a good measure on this IA program,&quot;said Adm.
Jonathan Greenert, commander, U.S. Fleet Forces Command.

Individual Augmentee Manpower Management Assignment Sailors (IAMM) are
Sailors who are traditional IAs completing their tour in a temporarily
assigned duty status and who will return to their previous commands at
the completion of their IA tours. Commands deploying IAMM Sailors will
maintain traditional command responsibilities for IA Sailor and family
support.

Sailors serving on a Global War on Terrorism Support Assignment (GSA)
will also receive traditional family support from their detaching
command while on an IA tour; however, Expeditionary Combat Readiness
Center (ECRC) will provide all administrative Sailor support. This
administrative support will include but is not limited to: exam ordering
and exam administration; deployment pay, housing, medical and legal
support; personnel accounting of Sailors during a disaster; and
continuous reach back support for emergent deployment issues. The Navy
is currently filling approximately 60 percent of the GWOT assignments
through this GSA process.

Mobilized Reserve Sailors not mobilized as part of an established
commissioned Reserve component unit, will receive command and family
support from their assigned Navy Operational Support Centers. They will
receive IA administrative support from ECRC.

The IA Sailor and family support set forth in this new policy includes
but is not limited to: pre-deployment Sailor screening; family support
via ombudsmen or family readiness groups; periodic contact with IA
Sailors while deployed; periodic contact with families while IA Sailors
are deployed; and the inclusion of families in accounting and evacuation
orders during disaster response efforts.

With more than 27,000 Sailors executing one of the types of IA orders in
2008, ensuring clear, consistent support throughout the deployment
process is a top priority for Navy leaders.&quot;Our mission is to ensure a streamlined, standardized oversight of IA
support programs Navywide. This challenge includes supporting the
organization, training and equipping these IAs, supporting their
families, providing a predicable and consistent accession process and
integrating the IA process into the respective career paths of all of
our IAs,&quot;Greenert added.

The success of this new policy is also heavily dependent on the efforts
of the command IA coordinator (CIAC). As mandated in IA Gram 08-02,
every active command must designate a CIAC. These CIACs will work
closely with command ombudsmen to ensure commands provide the adequate
levels of support identified in IA Gram 08-03, as well as to ensure a
smooth hand-off of support responsibilities when a family moves from one
region to another.

With IA Gram 08-03 identifying who holds parent-command responsibilities
for IAs and their families, future IA Grams will clarify what those
responsibilities include.

Additional IA Sailor and family support will continue to come from Navy
Fleet and Family Support Centers, regional commanders and ECRC. To view
IA Gram 08-03 in its entirety, visit http://www.cffc.navy.mil/augmentees/. For more news from U.S. Fleet Forces Command, visit

NNS081029-18. USS Shiloh Arrives in Hong Kong for SAREX 2008

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class (SW/AW) David L. Smart, Fleet
Public Affairs Center Pacific

HONG KONG (NNS) -- The forward-deployed guided-missile cruiser USS
Shiloh (CG 67) arrived in Hong Kong Oct. 26 for a port visit and to
participate in Hong Kong Search and Rescue Exercise (SAREX) 2008.

The SAREX is an annual exercise in search and rescue techniques designed
to share information and innovations between U.S. forces and Hong Kong&apos;s
Government Flying Service (GFS). The People&apos;s Republic of China will
also participate with the GFS in a separate part of SAREX.&quot;Shiloh is happy to be in Hong Kong to promote interoperability between
U.S. search and rescue forces and those of the Hong Kong Government
Flying Service,&quot;said Lt. Cmdr. Richard M. Meyer, Shiloh&apos;s executive
officer.&quot;The events included in the SAR (search and rescue) exercise are a great
opportunity to improve cooperation between forces in the Hong Kong
Search and Rescue Region. They also allow for the rare opportunity for
our Sailors and Airmen to conduct live SAR operations.&quot;Along with Shiloh, which is forward-deployed to Yokosuka, Japan, other
U.S. forces participating include aircraft and personnel from U.S. Coast
Guard District 14 in Honolulu and the Alaska Air National Guard&apos;s 210th
and 212th Rescue Squadrons (RQS) from Anchorage, Alaska.

As Shiloh approached Hong Kong, some early training exercises were
available. A HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopter from the 210th RQS had an
opportunity to perform deck landing qualifications aboard the Shiloh.&quot;We coordinated with USS Shiloh to go out and practice some deck
landings, and for a couple of our crewmen it was qualifications on the
decks, so it was a new opportunity for us. We&apos;re a land-based unit, an
Air Force unit, landing on a Navy ship,&quot;said Lt. Col. Tim O&apos;Brien,
commander of the 210th RQS.&quot;I think it went really well. The Navy was
great, they had everything ready for us when we got there. As a matter
of fact, we finished all our training and it went really smoothly.&quot;&quot;I was greatly impressed with their knowledge of our flight operations,&quot;said Lt. Cmdr. Daniel E. Fillion, Helicopter Anti-Submarine Light (HSL)
51 air detachment officer in charge.&quot;They made a risky operation go
smoothly and safely.&quot;The SAREX allows for a rare mutual operability between services. It is
not often that we are able to have other services&apos; helicopters land on
our flight deck,&quot;Fillion added.&quot;Today, we were not only able to have
an Air Force HH-60 land on Shiloh&apos;s flight deck, but two pilots earned
their deck landing qualifications.&quot;The Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department (HK CAD) will host a SAR seminar
Oct. 28 in downtown Hong Kong, followed by the SAREX Oct. 29-30. The
SAREX will feature both long-range and short-range SAR events. The HK
CAD has invited personnel from Brunei, Indonesia, Macau, Malaysia,
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam to observe the exercise.

The People&apos;s Republic of China will be represented in the short-range
SAR exercise by People&apos;s Liberation Army (PLA) units from the PLA Hong
Kong Garrison.

NNS081029-07. New Tool Keeps Military-Mailed Ballots on Track&gt;From Fleet and Industrial Supply Center Sigonella-Naples Public Affairs

SIGONELLA, Italy (NNS) -- Absentee voters in the Naples, Italy, area can
track their ballots in the mail through a new Web-based tool launched by
the U.S. Military Postal Service.

Naples-area U.S. military post offices began providing voters with the
ballot tracking card last week, and customers are already able to see
their ballots move through the stateside postal system.

Fleet and Industrial Supply Center Sigonella-Naples Chief Postal Clerk
(SW/AW) Bill Struck, who oversees postal operations from the Fleet Mail
Center at Capodichino, explained that voters mailing ballots in person
at any of the four Naples-area military post offices are offered the
tracking card after the window clerk places a bar-coded sticker on a ballot.

For voters who drop their ballots in a mailbox, the bar-coded sticker is
still applied by Naples postal clerks, and the tracking cards are then
hand addressed and mailed back to the voter.

The Web site address is provided on the tracking card.&quot;The site is remarkably easy to navigate, and initial feedback from
customers has been very positive,&quot;Struck said.

Bar-coding is nothing new to the postal system, said Senior Chief Postal
Clerk (SW/AW) Edgardo Rodriguez, the Naples area postal officer. Post
offices&quot;have used them for years both to track and to improve the speed
at which mail is sorted and routed, but this new ballot tracking system
is a first,&quot;he said.

Naples-area military post offices were already tightly controlling the
handling, marking and piece-counting of election materials to ensure an
airtight system remained in place for the entire voting season.

The new ballot-tracking tool extends that same level of confidence to
the final stateside post office destinations, postal officials said and,
to date, no errors with scanning stateside have been reported.

FISC Sigonella provides logistics, business and support services to
fleet, shore and industrial commands of the Navy, Coast Guard, Military
Sealift Command and other Joint and Allied Forces in Europe, Africa and
Southwest Asia.

The newest of seven supply centers under Commander, Fleet and Industrial
Supply Centers, FISC Sigonella delivers combat capability through
logistics by teaming with regional partners and customers to provide
supply chain management, contracting and transportation services,
technical and customer support, hazardous materials management,
consolidated mail services and worldwide movement of personal property.

NNS081029-19. Peleliu Sailors Hone Skills During Damage Control Olympics

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class (SW) Sarah Bitter, USS
Peleliu Public Affairs

USS PELELIU, At Sea (NNS) -- The amphibious assault ship USS Peleliu
(LHA 5) held the Damage Control (DC) Olympics Oct. 22.

Events included pipe-patching drills, relays, operating fire pumps and
setting up desmoking fans. A total of 10 teams and 63 Sailors from
various departments throughout the ship participated in the event.

Teams represented each of Peleliu&apos;s seven repair lockers, the repair
division and the&quot;Flying Squad.&quot;Peleliu&apos;s junior officers also formed a
team for the competition.&quot;We do this in a fun competitive atmosphere while revealing the
knowledge level of damage control, so our Sailors are able to hone their
skills for a real casualty,&quot;said Capt. David Schnell, Peleliu&apos;s
executive officer.&quot;This competitive, timed event is a fun way to see
who really knows their stuff.&quot;Peleliu&apos;s damage control training team designed the DC Olympics
competition to teach damage control techniques and help prepare the ship
for any emergency situation. Winning teams were awarded medals as well
as special liberty chits.&quot;This drill helps prepare us for the certification we are having in
February, said Lt. j.g. Jason Datinguinoo, Peleliu&apos;s assistant damage
control officer.&quot;It gives everyone a better hands-on experience being
able to use their gear. It also provides valuable experience that can
potentially save lives on board.&quot;The olympics offered Sailors an opportunity to show off their damage
control skills.&quot;I am excited because we are the best locker on the ship,&quot;said Aviation
Machinist&apos;s Mate 3rd Class Steven Gonzalez, assigned to repair locker 1H
which won the competition.&quot;I like being able to demonstrate my DC
skills, and I am excited to receive a 72-hour special liberty after
deployment is over.&quot;Peleliu is the flagship of the Peleliu Expeditionary Strike Group
(PELESG) and the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit which is conducting
operations in the U.S. 3rd Fleet area of responsibility. The PELESG left
San Diego on May 4 for a scheduled deployment.

NNS081029-03. Patrol Squadron Celebrates 30 Years of Mishap-Free Flying

By Lt. j.g. Frank Verducci, VP-9 Public Affairs

ALI AB, Iraq (NNS) -- Patrol Squadron 9 (VP-9) executed a major safety
milestone for maritime patrol aviation Oct. 26 when Combat Aircrew 11
safely completed an eight-hour mission in support of Operation Iraqi
Freedom surpassing 30 years and 180,000 hours of mishap-free flying.&gt;From Cold War anti-submarine warfare in the 1970s out of Adak, Alaska, to
present-day expeditionary missions during an Iraqi summer desert deployment,
this accomplishment uniquely attests to the squadron&apos;s past and present
leadership and keen focus in all matters concerning aviation safety in any
environment.

Cmdr. Curtis K. Phillips, commanding officer, Patrol Squadron 9, praised
the squadron for its professionalism and dedication to this daily effort.&quot;Our concern for safety is a constant companion. This milestone
represents the efforts of VP-9 aviators and maintenance professionals
spanning the last thirty years.&quot;This mission was flown by a junior aircrew, a testament to the
standardization and leadership, at the lowest levels, that is required
to safely and effectively operate an aging airframe while bridging the
gap to the P-8 Poseidon. We are proud to have the opportunity to reflect
on this squadron&apos;s legacy of safety.&quot;Patrol Squadron 9 is finishing up a seven-month deployment to the Middle
East in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and will return to their home
base of Marine Corps Base Hawaii.

NNS081029-09. Seabees, Ethiopian Partners Dedicate Refurbished School

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SCW/SW/AW) Ronald Gutridge,
Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 4 Det HOA Public Affairs

ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (NNS) -- Navy Seabees of Naval Mobile Construction
Battalion (NMCB) 4, based out of Naval Base Ventura County, Calif.,
attended the dedication ceremony of the Abadir Primary School in Addis
Ababa Oct. 16.

With the support of the U.S. Agency for International Development
(USAID), the U.S. Embassy and the 489th Civil Affairs Team, a crew of 11
Seabees from NMCB 4 started a the school refurbishing project in early
August after the project was turned over to them by NMCB 74, based out
of Gulfport, Miss.&quot;We want all Ethiopian students to learn in an environment that helps
them be the best students they can be,&quot;said Nancy Estes, USAID-Ethiopia
program office chief.&quot;We are proud to work together -- with the U.S. military, the leadership
of the Ministry of Education and the staff and students of the Abadir
School -- to help these children succeed in their studies and to support
the hard work of Abadir teachers and staff.&quot;The Seabees upgraded all of the facilities at the Abadir Primary School
including repairing the roofs on the classroom and administration
buildings. New electrical wiring and light fixtures were installed. New
tile and plumbing fixtures were installed in the bathroom facility and
the outdoor wash station, improving the sanitary conditions for both the
students and staff. New paint was applied to the interior of the
facilities and a colorful marble chip was applied to the exterior.&quot;Working on this project is a very extraordinary and vital part of our
(NMCB 4) mission.&quot;said Utilitiesman 2nd Class Jordan Gulvas, project
crew leader.&quot;We are not only improving a place for the children to
learn and grow, we are also continuing to be accepted by the local
community. Without this, I don&apos;t think this project would be possible.&quot;The project was completed Oct. 10 with the installation of new
chalkboards and refurbished school furniture provided by USAID. As the
school progresses, the Ethiopian partners are committed to maintaining
the school, while the U.S. Embassy will continue to support the growth
of the library with more books and related material. Approximately 300
students will benefit from this particular project that included a total
of 1,681 man days on the project and cost of $180,000.

NMCB 4 Air Detachment is on a six-month deployment supporting Combined
Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa and is completing missions in various

NNS081029-13. Medical Professionals Build on Maritime Strategy Core
Capability

Special Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet Public Affairs

PEARL HARBOR (NNS) -- More than 100 military and civilian healthcare
professionals and planners from across the Pacific Fleet gathered for
the 14th biennial Pacific Fleet/Marine Forces Medical Symposium in Pearl
Harbor Oct. 22-24 to discuss the future of humanitarian and civic
assistance (HCA) missions.

The theme of this year&apos;s symposium was&quot;Humanitarian Civic Assistance
Into the 21st Century.&quot;As the sixth pillar of the Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century
Seapower, humanitarian assistance builds on&quot;relationships forged in
times of calm&quot;and mitigates&quot;human suffering as the vanguard of
interagency and multinational efforts, both in a deliberate, proactive
fashion and in response to crises.&quot;The three-day conference combined a unique blend of military and
civilian speakers and breakout sessions, challenging the participants to
recognize the increasingly complex inter-relationships of military,
economic, healthcare, infrastructure, political and diplomatic policies
relevant to security issues throughout the Pacific region.

Rear Adm. Joseph Mulloy, the U.S. Pacific Fleet deputy chief of staff
for plans, policies and requirements, welcomed the participants to the
symposium and kicked off the discussion of HCA missions.

Mulloy compared past humanitarian assistance and disaster relief
missions, which often had to ramp up quickly, with today&apos;s missions such
as Pacific Partnership that involve longer, more detailed planning for
sustained success.&quot;Missions like Pacific Partnership make us better prepared, enhance our
Navy/Marine Corps team and make us a better Navy,&quot;he said.&quot;Pacific
Partnership represents the best of our military planning capability.&quot;Mulloy spoke of the medical community&apos;s role in HCA missions, focusing
much of his remarks on the recent Pacific Partnership missions aboard
USNS Mercy (T-AH 19) in 2008 and USS Peleliu (LHA 5) in 2007 that helped
build collaborative relationships in Southeast Asia and Oceania by
providing engineering, civic, medical and dental assistance.

To these missions,&quot;you bring resources, you bring heart and you bring
respect,&quot;he said.&quot;Pacific Partnership personifies planning,
compassion, respect and understanding for the local populations.&quot;Mulloy challenged those in attendance to ask the hard questions
throughout the symposium about past missions and to look toward
continuously improving future missions.

Capt. Scott Flinn, medical commander for Pacific Partnership 2007
(PP07), followed Mulloy, reviewing the lessons learned and best
practices from that mission, thus preparing for panel discussions about
experiences and strategies. Flinn concluded that PP07 met the mission of
a&quot;by, with, through&quot;operation highlighted by Mulloy in his opening
remarks.&quot;What that means is that we were there &apos;by&apos; invitation of the host
nation, working &apos;with&apos; them side-by-side, &apos;through&apos; their help and
assistance,&quot;Flinn said.

Echoing Flinn, Capt. James Rice, medical commander for the 148-day PP08
deployment, emphasized that the HCA missions are&quot;not about us.&quot;But
instead,&quot;we are there to support our host nations, our partners.&quot;Rice stressed that the U.S. focus must be on furthering host-nation
capabilities to move forward with skills, equipment and expertise to
further treat their own people. However, the Mercy medical commander
also cited specific examples of how treating individuals affected entire
villages.&quot;This mission and the spirit of Pacific Partnership changed people&apos;s
lives,&quot;he said.&quot;We have a picture of a woman with a smile on her face
after receiving a pair of glasses. That picture really captures the
meaning of Pacific Partnership.&quot;Flinn closed his presentation with a poem by Maya Angelou that he said
highlights the essence Navy/Marine Corps HCA missions:&quot;People will
forget what you said. People will forget what you did. But people will
never forget how you made them feel.&quot;Capt. Gail Hathway, U.S. Pacific Fleet deputy fleet surgeon and
coordinator of the symposium, said that attendees took advantage of the
lessons learned, best practices and challenges set forth by the opening
speakers. And, for the remainder of the event, the participants actively
contributed to panel discussions, breakout sessions and
social-networking events.&quot;It was time we sat down to talk about how to work better and smarter on
HCA missions,&quot;she said.&quot;We invited Army, Air Force and many others who
have done HCAs but do them differently. We shared the best of the best.&quot;Hathway reiterated that the time to plan for HCA missions is now as the
days of pick-up operations are gone.&quot;We are planning sooner, engaging with partners sooner and putting
together a planning cycle that isn&apos;t rushed,&quot;she said.&quot;The time to
exchange business cards is now, not during an emergency.&quot;For more news from Pacific Fleet, visit www.navy.mil/local/cpf/.

NNS081029-16. NSWC Crane Employee Earns Recognition Support to Joint
Spec Ops Forces&gt;From Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division Public Affairs

CRANE, Ind. (NNS) -- Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division
customer advocate was recognized Sept. 15 for his work as a program
manager for the Special Operations Peculiar Modifications (SOPMOD) Program.

Lucius&quot;Gus&quot;Taylor, a retired U.S. Army Special Forces lieutenant
colonel, received a personal memo of thanks from Lt. Gen. Robert Wagner,
commanding general of the U.S. Army Special Operations Command at Fort
Bragg, N.C.

The recognition was for Taylor&apos;s eight years of SOPMOD program
management, including his work with modernizing SOPMOD Block II
accessories for the needs of Army Special Operations Forces.

During his time with SOPMOD, Taylor initiated the Special Operations
Forces Fielding and Training Team (SOF FTT) to assist in fielding more
than 80,000 SOPMOD Block II items. Taylor also had a hand in leading the
teams that developed and fielded the Special Purpose Receiver (SPR), the
77-grain ammunition for the SPR, the AN/PSQ-18A Grenade Launcher Site,
and a new-technology sound suppressor.

Wagner said Taylor demonstrated a unique ability to weave through the
complicated acquisition process and field equipment in the shortest time
possible.&quot;Your efforts have had a direct impact on the increased lethality and
survivability of Army Special Operations Forces (ARSOF) Soldiers,&quot;he
said, adding that Taylor&apos;s professionalism was a credit to NSWC Crane.

Taylor began work at NSWC Crane in 1999 and took over management of the
SOPMOD program. He remained in that position until late 2008, when he
was selected as the NSWC Crane customer advocate for U.S. Special
Operations Command (USSOCOM).&quot;The SOPMOD program team at Crane put a huge amount of day and night
aiming systems into the hands of Army Special Forces, Army Rangers, Navy
SEALS, Air Force Special Tactics Units and Marine Corps Special
Operations Units for use in combat in the War on Terrorism,&quot;said
Taylor.&quot;We fielded a combination of a high volume of traditional
systems as well as some historic new capabilities.&quot;Taylor said one of the first systems fielded at NSWC Crane was rushed
into the field in September 2001, right after the 9/11 attacks.&quot;This system was the Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) with its highly
accurate ammunition, day and night aiming sights, and flash and sound
suppressor,&quot;he said.&quot;The SPR was the first small, light, sniper rifle
to be issued in large numbers to U.S. Special Forces that was
specifically designed for day and night combat as a system.

Other projects he worked on while with SOPMOD included the capabilities
to find and fire on the enemy on totally dark nights and to see, aim,
and shoot through sand-storms. He said many of these systems now are
much smaller, lighter and more effective than earlier systems.&quot;This stream of high-technology gear to our special operators in combat
continues to this day, with NSWC Crane delivering thousands of systems
per month and ensuring that our special operations forces truly &apos;own the
night&apos; in Iraq, Afghanistan and wherever else the enemy hides,&quot;said Taylor.

Taylor passed along his deepest thanks and appreciation to members of
the SOPMOD team, thanking his former Deputy Program Managers Barry
Gatewood, Bobby Just and Paul Miller for their roles in the last eight
years of SOPMOD program success.&quot;I did not get this three-star memo for my work alone. This recognition
would never have come without the selfless effort and strong work ethic
of all of the members of the SOPMOD Program Team, as well as those who
support them here at NSWC Crane,&quot;Taylor concluded.

NNS081029-10. Medal of Honor Recipients Honored at San Clemente Park

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SW/AW) Dominique M. Lasco,
Naval Special Warfare Public Affairs

SAN CLEMENTE, Calif. (NNS) -- Officials from the city of San Clemente,
Calif., honored three deceased Medal of Honor recipients during a
rededication ceremony Oct. 25 at Park Semper Fi Marine Monument.

The ceremony paid tribute to two Navy SEALs, Lt. Michael Murphy and
Master-at-Arms 2nd Class (SEAL) Michael Monsoor, and Marine Cpl. Jason
Dunham. All three were posthumously awarded the nation&apos;s highest
military honor for courageous actions in combat in Iraq or Afghanistan.
The ceremony marked the first time in the park&apos;s three-year history that
both Sailors and Marines were honored together.&quot;It&apos;s so important to honor those who have received the Medal of Honor,&quot;said Wayne Eggleston, executive director of the Heritage of San Clemente
Foundation and city council member.&quot;They have really given their lives
for the United States of America and our freedoms.&quot;San Clemente is located near Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton and is
within an hour&apos;s drive of major Navy bases in San Diego. The city
originally dedicated the park to Marines of past, present and future but
honored all members of the sea services.

Navy SEALs from San Diego and Marines from Camp Pendleton joined the
city in honoring their fallen comrades. Other guests included Monsoor&apos;s
mother, sister and sister-in-law.

The intimate ceremony began with music from the Marine Corps Band.
Friends or fellow service members remembered each recipient, describing
their amazing qualities.

Sara Monsoor spoke highly of the ceremony and was proud to know that
other services recognize and remember her brother.&quot;I think that it is wonderful that they want to add him to this park
with the Marines,&quot;said Sara.&quot;With all the different branches, it&apos;s
nice to see that there is still recognition. It helps to know that
people still talk and remember them.&quot;According to Eggleston, Park Semper Fi honors veterans and active duty
military members annually around Veterans Day and is visited by more
than 8,000 people each year. Sara hoped that the men like her brother
who sacrificed themselves for their comrades and country would influence
their fellow citizens.&quot;My hope,&quot;said Sara&quot;is that when people come here, these plaques
inspire them to find out their stories and really inspire them to live
their lives like these men did.&quot;For more news from Naval Special Warfare, visit www.navy.mil/local/nsw/.

NNS081029-05. JTF GTMO Focuses on Quality of Life, Impact on Mission in Cuba

By Army Staff Sgt. Emily Russell, Joint Task Force Guantanamo Public Affairs

GUANTANAMO BAY, Cuba (NNS) -- The commander of Joint Task Force (JTF)
Guantanamo (GTMO) has kept an eye on all aspects of the JTF, from
quality of life for the troopers working in the detention camps to the
quality of service provided to all JTF troopers.&quot;My priorities are executing the mission,&quot;said Rear Adm. David M.
Thomas Jr.&quot;I identified three focus areas when I got here.&quot;Thomas listed the areas of focus as: trooper and JTF staff quality of
service, strategic communication and security.

The mission remains the same for JTF Guantanamo  safe, humane, legal,
transparent care and custody of detained enemy combatants.

But in order to continue the mission with high standards and maintain
the morale of the troopers in a challenging environment, Thomas takes a
closer look at what really holds the mission together  people, process
and planning.&quot;Everyone has a right to a work environment conducive to high morale and
high productivity,&quot;said Thomas.&quot;While everyone has the right to that,
everyone  from me down to the most junior [trooper]  also has the
responsibility to bring to the attention of their chain of command any
bad behavior or inappropriate work environment.&quot;In addition to enforcing a safe and comfortable office climate and
culture, Thomas looks at the physical aspects of where troopers work and
assesses what measures must be taken to continually improve.&quot;As I got [around] the JTF, I was seeing a need for processes that
aren&apos;t inherent to an established JTF,&quot;said Thomas.

Thomas explained that a joint task force is not typically a long-term
sustained organization. In the case of JTF Guantanamo  nearing its
seventh year of existence  infrastructure, sustainment, phased
maintenance and repair processes are key to keeping the JTF running
smoothly.

The Joint Detention Group (JDG) and JTF engineers have created plans for
routine care of the JTF &apos;physical plant.&apos; This includes the sea huts and
buildings throughout the JTF area.

In addition there is a focus to maintain comfortable housing for troopers.&quot;We&apos;re updating the [regulations] on housing to make sure it accurately
reflects reality so everybody understands the importance of personal
privacy and the need to express oneself,&quot;said Thomas.&quot;Housing is a big
concern  constant improvement is what we&apos;re about.&quot;Aside from the quality of life and services, Thomas has scrutinized the
processes of the JTF day-to-day work environment.&quot;Some folks are here for four months  some are here for a year,&quot;said
Thomas.&quot;We have a high turnover so there is no &apos;corporate knowledge.&apos;
What you know about your job is what your successor managed to infuse in
a short turnover period. So, there&apos;s a lot of myth and folk lore People
think they understand why things are they way they are,  but in fact,
there have been seven years since the first group of [troopers] turned
up here.&quot;Thomas&apos; point emphasizes the need for being methodical, and the
importance for standard operating procedures.&quot;In certain areas we&apos;re great at that,&quot;said Thomas.&quot;The JDG detainee operations SOP [standard operating procedures] is
awesome. It&apos;s maintained  easy to update. When it&apos;s updated the changes
are approved at the right level, and then it&apos;s trained to the guard
force. They&apos;ve got a magnificent process that is exactly perfect.&quot;Over time, some of the processes that take place at the JTF are subject
to break down without proper documentation. By being diligent and
documenting every process that supports the mission, troopers can ensure
continued success.

Thomas explained that communication has become a key element in the
collaboration to streamline command and control practices and that the
aspects of working together have been exercised and proved successful.

In only four months aboard, Thomas has identified changes that will
positively impact the JTF for future rotations of troopers. With a push
for personal responsibility and a sense of ownership among those who
live and work here, troopers can take pride in not only their work but
their surroundings.&quot;I am so proud of the folks at GTMO. There is no other missionas
scrutinized as we are,&quot;said Thomas.&quot;We don&apos;t take ethical and moral
shortcuts [here], and I think the American people would be proud if they
really understood what goes on here.&quot;For more news from Joint Task Force Guantanamo, visit

NNS081029-17. &apos;El Paso Navy Blitz&apos; Highlights Navy Opportunities on Campus

By Mass Communications Specialists 1st Class Kimberly R. Stephens, Navy
Recruiting District Phoenix Public Affairs

EL PASO, Texas (NNS) -- Navy Recruiting District (NRD) Phoenix organized
a pilot program in conjunction with the Navy College Tour named the &apos;El
Paso Navy Blitz&apos; Oct. 14  18, at the University of Texas El Paso (UTEP)
campus to create awareness of educational and career opportunities in
the Navy.&quot;We are delighted you came out to share your opportunities with us,&quot;said Howard Daidistel, UTEP dean of students.

Rear Adm. Patrick H. Brady, deputy director, Submarine Warfare Division,
along with other Navy officers spoke at a faculty advisory luncheon held
at UTEP, Oct. 15, 2008. The luncheon was held to brief college and high
school educators about the educational opportunities the Navy has to
offer students.&quot;This year is the 100th anniversary of the Theodore Roosevelt&apos;s Great
White Fleet,&quot;said Brady.&quot;Today we build on that legacy. Compared to
those days we [the Navy] have progressed through diversity and technology.&quot;Brady also explained that today&apos;s Navy must reflect our country.&quot;We look forward to continuing building a relationship with UTEP,&quot;he said.

Brady along with NRD Phoenix chief petty officers, officers and local
reserve officers talked about the Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps
scholarships (NROTC), medical programs, nuclear programs and many others.&quot;The educational opportunities will streamline the students&apos; career for
success based on what they learn in the Navy,&quot;said Brady.

When Sailors get out of the Navy they are often more marketable in the
civilian sector.&quot;Employers often hire prior military before they hire just an average
civilian out of college,&quot;said Brady.
Not only did the admiral speak to local educators, but he and junior
officers also talked to approximately 50 students from the College of
Engineering about opportunities the Navy offers.

One of the biggest concerns from students was about the difficulty of
Officer Candidate Schools (OCS).&quot;Is it as tough as it looks in some of the movies?&quot;a concerned student
asked.&quot;OCS is like anything else. At the time you will think it is really
tough, and you might wonder what you got yourself in to, but afterward
you and your new friends will have so many funny stories to share and
memories made together,&quot;said Lt. William Wohead, Civil Engineer Corps
accessions officer, Naval Facilities Engineering Command San Diego.&quot;OCS
trains you how to be a leader among leaders.&quot;NRD Phoenix Executive Officer, Cmdr. Darryl Toppin added,&quot;OCS does
teach you how to work as a team. However, it also teaches you how to be
a leader within a team environment. Ask anyone who has been on a ship.
It takes a team to accomplish the mission.&quot;The junior officers also spoke to the students of their decision to join
the Navy and how it has affected their lives.

Outside the UTEP auditorium was the Navy College Tour on its third
consecutive year visiting the campus. The college tour is a national
touring event that visits the top Hispanic universities in the United
States.

Students were given free t-shirts, notebooks, pens, pencils and other
Navy giveaways. The free event was also catered.&quot;It is neat that the Navy would come out here and talk to us,&quot;said
William Holley, UTEP sophomore.

During the week recruiters also visited local area high schools.&quot;Everything you do now will affect the rest of your life,&quot;said Senior
Chief Damage Controlman (SW) Robert Rosales, Navy Recruiting District
Phoenix Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC) coordinator,&quot;There
is no such thing as luck, you make your own luck.&quot;Rosales also explained to the students that&quot;the guy you see with all
the money took steps to get there and you must do the same.&quot;Colleges know that NROTC students are serious, know their grades will be
monitored and the student will be in physical shape, said Rosales.&quot;You are not commissioned as an officer until after graduation,&quot;said
Rosales.&quot;You are not obligated until after your freshman year. You
still don&apos;t have to accept the commission upon graduation, but at that
point you will be obligated to pay the money back.&quot;The students also learned about some of the other programs such as
medical, dental as well as NROTC scholarships.

The El Paso Navy Blitz was wrapped up with a community relations project
at the Child Crisis Center of El Paso.

The crisis center has been in the area for 28 years. The mission is to
prevent child abuse, provide emergency shelter, and provide supportive
services as well as family preservation and reunification.&quot;Our primary service is to work with child protective services,&quot;said Al
Velarde, executive director of the center.&quot;There are marginal cases
where you can preserve the family. We take care of the children while
the parents work with child protective services.

Velarde went on to explain,&quot;We are really proud of our outreach and
success with the military. When you [the military] come here especially
in uniform, the children know the difference between a military member
and an average visitor. You are like role models to them.&quot;Sailors put brick around the children&apos;s&apos; basketball court area, painted
rooms and put shelves on the wall.&quot;Volunteering makes me feel good,&quot;said Navy Counselor 1st Class (SW)
Abraham Gomez, El Paso recruiter for NRD Phoenix.&quot;If I would have known
about this place before I would have volunteered sooner. I am coming back!&quot;Creating Navy awareness in a mostly Army town was what this event was
all about. The local community does not see ships or Sailors everyday,
so this event brought the sea service to a land-locked area of the
United States.

NNS081029-08. PCU Bush Recognized with Community Service Honors

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Michael Tackitt,
Pre-Commissioning Unit George H.W. Bush Public Affairs

NEWPORT NEWS, Va (NNS) -- Pre-Commissioning Unit George H.W. Bush (CVN
77) was selected as one of the winners of the 2008 Commander, Navy
Region Mid-Atlantic (CNRMA) Community Service Awards for volunteer
efforts in the Newport News community.

CNRMA selected PCU Bush as its Personal Excellence Partnership Flagship
in the large ships category for the crew&apos;s work in 2007 for the&quot;Adopt-A-School&quot;program. As part of the program, Sailors worked as
mentors and role models for students at Newsome Park Elementary School
in Newport News.

This is the first time the ship has received any type of award for its
community service projects.&quot;This is very important because we&apos;re making a difference in students&apos;
lives and even in the Sailors&apos; lives for being able to give back to the
community,&quot;said Chief Religious Program Specialist (AW/SW) Eddie B.
Williams, PCU Bush Command Religious Ministries Department.&quot;We realize that a mind is a terrible thing to waste and we want to be
good role models and mentors to students who don&apos;t have both parents in
their lives.&quot;The Sailors who volunteered for the project spent nearly an entire year
working with the students and becoming part of their school-day
experiences from start to finish. Some days, as the children got off the
bus, they were greeted by Sailors as they entered the school.

On other days, the volunteers visited during recess and lunchtime, and
helped out with the school&apos;s food program which provided relief for
needy families. Some Sailors became involved in the classroom curriculum
and assisted teachers.&quot;We had at least one or two Sailors who consistently went to the
classroom and created a camaraderie with the students or worked as
teachers&apos; aides, pretty much helping the teachers with their work
assignments,&quot;Williams explained.&quot;That had a good impact because (the
teachers&apos;) feedback said they really wanted the Sailors to return.&quot;&quot;It&apos;s great. You get to interact with the kids and see little people
with their own different individualities,&quot;said Aviation Ordnanceman 1st
Class (AW) James E. Walton, one of the Adopt-A-School volunteers who
adopted a kindergarten class.&quot;It makes me feel great I was a part of it.&quot;Crew members from PCU Bush also regularly participated in community
service projects throughout Newport News and Norfolk. Sailors worked in
soup kitchens, fed the homeless, worked with Habitat for Humanity and
the Salvation Army as well as the United Service Organization.&quot;God blesses us to be a blessing to others,&quot;Williams said.&quot;So people
who are good in math or English or just a high achiever, they can pass
on some learning tips and share their words of wisdom with other people.
We are not just to hold on to our blessings, but we are called to help
one another.&quot;PCU Bush, as well as the rest of the winners of the 2008 CNRMA Community
Service of the Year Awards, will go on to represent the Mid-Atlantic
Region in the Navywide competition.

The aircraft carrier is under construction at Northrop Grumman Newport
News Shipyard.

NNS081030-08. SECNAV Names New Zumwalt-Class Destroyer USS Michael Monsoor&gt;From the Department of Defense

WASHINGTON (NNS) -- Secretary of the Navy, Donald C. Winter announced
Oct. 29 at a Navy SEAL Warrior Fund Benefit Gala at the Waldorf-Astoria
Hotel in New York City, the name of the newest Zumwalt-class Destroyer
will be USS Michael Monsoor.

Designated as DDG 1001, the name honors Petty Officer 2nd Class Michael
Monsoor, a Navy SEAL who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for
his heroic actions in Ramadi, Iraq, Sept. 29, 2006.

Winter discussed the qualities, values and dedication to duty that Navy
SEALs exemplify, including the extraordinary acts of Michael Monsoor.&quot;Tonight I would like to single out one of those heroes from the
community of Navy SEALs,&quot;Winter said.&quot;Those who served with Michael
Monsoor will remember him always as a consummate professional who faced
terrorist enemies with aplomb and stoicism.&quot;&quot;The full extent of Michael&apos;s courage, gallantry and selfless heroism
were revealed on the 29th of September, in Ramadi. When his team was
surprised by an enemy grenade, Michael could have escaped and saved
himself,&quot;Winter said.&quot;But he chose a different path, a path of honor
that embodies the way of a Navy SEAL. For having chosen that path, Petty
Officer Michael Monsoor joined the ranks of those who have earned our
nation&apos;s highest distinction, the Medal of Honor.&quot;Winter concluded that Michael Monsoor&apos;s heroism and self sacrifice for
his teammates and his nation epitomize the Navy&apos;s core values and will
forever provide prideful admiration for our Sailors.&quot;Michael Monsoor&apos;s name will now be linked with one of our nation&apos;s most
visible examples of military power, a U.S. Navy warship,&quot;Winter said.&quot;His legacy will inspire the hearts of future Sailors who serve on the
ship that bears his name.&quot;The USS Michael Monsoor will be a multi-mission surface combatant
tailored for advanced land attack and littoral dominance. The ship&apos;s
mission is to provide credible, independent forward presence and
deterrence and to operate as an integral part of naval, joint or
combined maritime forces.

The USS Michael Monsoor will be the second Zumwalt-class destroyer. The
ship will be 600 feet in length, have a beam of 80.7 feet and displace
approximately 15,000 tons. Michael Monsoor will have a crew size of 148
officers and Sailors; it will make speed in excess of 30 knots.

NNS081029-20. Navy&apos;s Shoreline Project is Largest in Chesapeake Bay
Watershed

By Gary R. Wagner, Naval Support Activity South Potomac Public Affairs

INDIAN HEAD, Md. (NNS) -- The Navy has embarked on the largest shoreline
stabilization project in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The multi-year
effort will not only protect critical military infrastructure but will
also improve water quality and establish habitat to support aquatic
wildlife.

The remains of an asphalt road follow the edge of a crumbling bluff
towering 30 feet above the river&apos;s edge below. Pieces of concrete
building slabs are all that&apos;s left of former technical facilities that
had to be vacated and demolished because of the encroaching shoreline.

The Naval Support Facility (NSF) in Indian Head, Md., situated on a long
peninsula bounded by the Potomac River and the pristine Mattawoman Creek
watershed, was losing about one-and-a-half feet of real estate per year
along stretches of the base&apos;s 17 miles of waterfront.

But, thanks to emergency congressional funding and with the support of
local and regional conservation groups, the Navy has embarked on the
largest shoreline stabilization project in the Chesapeake Bay watershed.&quot;The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure, and the shoreline
restoration at Indian Head is one of many projects in which DoD is
investing to revitalize the bay,&quot;emphasizes Donald Schregardus,
environmental deputy assistant Secretary of the Navy.&quot;The project also
represents a significant long-term investment in the Indian Head
facility and community.&quot;At the average annual erosion rate of 1.5 feet per year, approximately
12,000 cubic yards of sediment per year was entering the surrounding
waterways. NSF Indian Head developed a shoreline management plan in 2002
that surveyed shoreline erosion along the installation&apos;s waterfront. The
plan prioritized areas that needed immediate attention and recommended
actions to manage shoreline erosion to protect existing infrastructure
at the base, improve water quality and enhance terrestrial and aquatic
wildlife habitat.

After Hurricane Isabel further exacerbated shoreline erosion on the
base, the Navy received $5.2 million in hurricane relief funding. The
money was used to fund the design, permitting and construction of the
initial phase of the shoreline stabilization project. Additional phases
are planned and dependent on funding through fiscal year 2010.

With the support of the Southern Maryland Resource Conservation and
Development Board and the Charles Soil Conservation District, work began
in November 2007 with the construction of a series of breakwaters and
sills along approximately 3,500 feet of the eastern shore of the Potomac
River. These stabilization efforts will greatly reduce or eliminate
impacts of wave action on the shoreline. As a result, approximately
2,900 feet of shoreline will naturally stabilize.

In addition, extensive erosion along a 600-foot section of the
stabilized shoreline required bank grading to stabilize the slope and
protect two office buildings within 35 feet of the top of the shoreline.

Behind the breakwaters and sills, an area of nearly 11 acres was
backfilled to create more than an acre of intertidal vegetated wetland
habitat and 9.5 acres of wetland habitat suitable for scrub-shrub,
riparian floodplain forest and upland trees and shrubs.&quot;This project uses state-of-the-art design to minimize the facility&apos;s
impact on the environment,&quot;Schregardus points out.&quot;It is also an
example of fiscal stewardship. The Navy has been able to achieve more
while reducing its costs through partnerships with the National Aquarium
in Baltimore, the Southern Maryland Resource Conservation and
Development Board, and the Charles Soil Conservation District.&quot;The National Aquarium in Baltimore, through a partnership with NSF
Indian Head, mobilized volunteers for two field planting events to
complete the first phase of the shoreline project. For the first event
in July 2008, more than 40 participants spent two days to place 10,000
wetland plants along approximately 1,700 feet of Potomac River
shoreline. Plantings occurred in the intertidal wetland zone created by
placing sediment behind the sills and breakwater that have been
constructed in the initial phase of the shoreline restoration project.

In a second field planting event that spanned four days this month, more
than 70 volunteers from communities throughout Maryland and Virginia
labored to plant native wetland grasses, shrubs and trees.

David Nemerson, conservation biologist for the National Aquarium who
directed the four-day project, estimated that volunteers logged a total
of nearly 1,000 hours of labor.&quot;We typically work on three or four projects a year of this size and
scope,&quot;he explained.&quot;But we tend to do more in Chesapeake Bay proper,&quot;as opposed to freshwater tributaries like the Potomac, he added.

Altogether, between the two field events, the volunteers placed 15,000
wetland plants in the intertidal zone of the shoreline as well as 1,400
trees and shrubs in a riparian floodplain zone.

The riparian floodplain zone extends from the mean high water line to
the toe of the existing slope of the shoreline. This area, once
revegetated, will increase protection of the toe of the existing slope,
enhance wildlife habitat and improve water quality.

Most of the volunteers, who spent one or more days working on the
shoreline and camping overnight in nearby Smallwood State Park, hailed
from distant communities throughout Maryland and Virginia.

Jeanette Bitzel from Westminster, Md., in Carroll County has worked on
conservation projects for two years with the Maryland Conservation
Corps, as a volunteer with AmeriCorps.

AmeriCorps is a program of the Corporation for National and Community
Service, an independent federal agency whose mission is to foster civic
engagement through service and volunteering. Each year, AmeriCorps
offers opportunities for adults to serve through a network of
partnerships with local and national nonprofit groups to address
critical needs in communities across America, to include tutoring
disadvantaged youth, building affordable housing, cleaning parks and
streams, or helping communities respond to disaster.

Bitzel, who also recently worked with a volunteer project at Assateague
Island National Seashore, was impressed by&quot;the horrible amount of
erosion the river was causing&quot;along the Naval Support Facility Indian
Head shoreline.&quot;What this project is doing is to help build up the shoreline to
function as a healthy ecosystem,&quot;she said.

Nemerson quipped that the volunteers experienced&quot;instant gratification&quot;for their labor.&quot;During one day of the field event a flock of blue
birds swooped down to perch on trees (planted by the volunteers) that
had only been in the ground 30 minutes.&quot;&quot;On behalf of the Navy, I thank the volunteers for their hard work and
congratulate them on a job well done,&quot;said Schregardus.&quot;This project
restores the natural functioning of the shoreline, and the work
performed over these past five days provides a long-term solution to
shoreline erosion, expands aquatic habitat, improves water quality, and
protects important Navy assets.&quot;With the completion of the second round of plantings, approximately
3,500 feet of shoreline has been revegetated in the initial phase of the
shoreline stabilization project.

In the broadest perspective, said Schregardus,&quot;This project is good for
the Chesapeake Bay, the surrounding environment, the Indian Head
community and the economy.&quot;For more news from Naval Support Activity South Potomac, visit

NNS081030-06. U.S., Asia-Pacific Service Members Exchange Ideas at
International SAR Seminar

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class (SW/AW) David L. Smart, Fleet
Public Affairs Center Pacific

HONG KONG (NNS) -- Representatives from the U.S. Navy, Air Force and
Coast Guard interacted with their counterparts from the Asia-Pacific
region during a search and rescue (SAR) seminar sponsored by the
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Oct. 28-29 at Hong
Kong&apos;s International Finance Centre.

The seminar, which preceded the start of Hong Kong Search and Rescue
Exercise (SAREX) 2008, was designed to bring together members of the SAR
community from the United States and Asian-Pacific nations for an
exchange of procedures and ideas.&quot;This seminar is important as it serves to strengthen participants&apos;
awareness of their responsibilities in SAR and provide a platform for
delegates to exchange knowledge and experience in the latest
developments in SAR equipment, techniques and procedures,&quot;said Norman
Lo, director general of civil aviation with the Hong Kong Civil Aviation
Department.

U.S. personnel in attendance included representatives from the
forward-deployed guided missile cruiser USS Shiloh (CG 67), based in
Yokosuka, Japan; Navy Patrol Squadron (VP) 16 from Jacksonville, Fla.;
Commander Task Force (CTF) 72 from Misawa, Japan; U.S. Coast Guard
District 14&apos;s Joint Rescue Coordination Center in Honolulu; and the
Alaska Air National Guard&apos;s 210th and 212th Rescue Squadrons (RQS) from
Anchorage, Alaska.&quot;This is a great opportunity for us,&quot;said Lt. Scott Regnerus, Shiloh&apos;s
operations officer.&quot;We&apos;re always happy to come to Hong Kong. It&apos;s a
wonderful place to visit. This is one of the things we&apos;re out there
doing, so to come and train with the nations of Asia and to practice
with the countries that we might have to work with in emergency
situations is well worth the trip. We&apos;re very happy to be here, very
happy to participate.&quot;Coast Guard Cmdr. Mike McCraw, incident management branch chief for
District 14&apos;s Joint Rescue Coordination Center, emphasized the common
mission of all SAR forces.&quot;The biggest thing is that we&apos;re all on the same wavelength of thought,&quot;said McCraw, who briefed attendees during the first day of the seminar.&quot;We all have a passion for making search and rescue better; we all have
a passion for coordinating efforts together.&quot;To me, search and rescue is the one unifying humanitarian mission that
we all have. We all want to be humanitarians; we all like the benefits
of rescue.&quot;Also presenting during the seminar were Lt. Cmdr. Nomer Oytas and Lt.
Randy Reed from CTF 72, who detailed the SAR capabilities of the P-3C
Orion, and Lt. Col. Tim O&apos;Brien, commander of the 210th RQS, who gave a
presentation on the Alaska Air National Guard&apos;s SAR roles and
responsibilities.&quot;Today, more than ever, the role of disaster response agencies has grown
even more critical,&quot;said Andrew Tiede, a representative of the ICAO
regional office of air traffic management.&quot;The success of the larger
scale search-and-rescue operations will always require the decisive
assistance and collaboration of the international community.&quot;Added Regnerus:&quot;It&apos;s good to see how other nations work. It&apos;s good to
interact with the agencies and militaries of other nations in the region
and it builds rapport, trust and good relationships.&quot;In addition to the U.S., the seminar was attended by SAR representatives
from Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, People&apos;s Republic of China,
Republic of Korea, Macau, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, Sri Lanka,
Thailand and Vietnam.

Hong Kong SAREX 2008, a joint exercise involving SAR assets from the
U.S., Hong Kong and the People&apos;s Republic of China, began immediately
following the seminar and runs through Oct. 30. The SAREX consists of
both short-range and long-range segments.

NNS081030-07. EODMU 11 Platoon Returns After Improving Safety in Iraq

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Tucker M. Yates, Fleet Public
Affairs Center, Det. Northwest

OAK HARBOR, Wash. (NNS) -- A platoon from Explosive Ordnance Disposal
Mobile Unit (EODMU) 11 returned to Naval Air Station (NAS) Whidbey
Island Oct. 28 after a six-month deployment to Iraq.

Platoon 11-2-2 was deployed in support of the U.S. Army 4th Brigade 10th
Mountain Division in Tallil, Iraq, as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom.&quot;We provided all the explosive ordnance disposal support they needed --
anything from unexploded ordnance, to caches, to enemy remnants of war,
to IEDs (improvised explosive devices) -- you name it, we were the ones
they called,&quot;said Lt. Scott Ray, Platoon 11-2-2 officer in charge.

Families and friends of the members of the platoon gathered at the NAS
Whidbey Island Air terminal to give them a warm welcome home.&quot;We&apos;re taking bad stuff off the streets and making sure the children of
tomorrow can live safer,&quot;said Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technician
2nd Class (DV/NPJ) Ray Curtis.

The platoon disposed of a total 108 explosives, a major feat according
to Ray.&quot;The most significant accomplishment for this platoon was the over
100,000 pounds net explosive weight that was taken care of; that&apos;s a
large number, and thousands of pieces of ordnance that will never
endanger coalition forces,&quot;said Ray.

Cmdr. Joseph Diguardo, EODMU-11 commanding officer, is proud of the
efforts the unit&apos;s members put forth in support of Operations Iraqi and
Enduring Freedom.&quot;They set the standard across the board in all of the Department of
Defense for professionalism and for EOD capability as well as
leadership,&quot;said Diguardo.

Diguardo added that EOD Sailors lead the way in convoys and are first
responders in almost any casualty.&quot;They don&apos;t cope with it; they destroy it, and I couldn&apos;t be more
honored to be associated with them and get a chance to work with them,&quot;said Diguardo.

This return marks the first deployment to Iraq in the last two years
that EODMU 11 has made without a casualty or fallen comrade.&quot;It&apos;s a sigh of relief for the psyche of the command. Breaking that
really tragic cycle we&apos;ve had is a huge step to helping us close the
door, but certainly never forget, and move forward from what we&apos;ve been
through in the past two years,&quot;said Diguardo.

EODMU 11 is part of the Navy Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC). NECC
includes 40,000 Sailors across the force which enable each of the six
core competencies of the maritime strategy. Currently, NECC forces are
deployed around the globe, supporting real-world missions, exercises and
theater security cooperation activities.

NNS081030-02. Essex Completes Amphibious Exercises in the Republic of
the Philippines

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class David Didier, Fleet Public
Affairs Center Pacific, Det. Sasebo

SUBIC BAY, Republic of the Philippines (NNS) -- The forward-deployed
amphibious assault ship USS Essex (LHD 2) arrived in Subic Bay, Republic
of the Philippines, after completing this year&apos;s Talon Vision (TV) and
Amphibious Landing Exercises (PHIBLEX) Oct. 27.

The exercises involved two weeks of ground, air and naval integration
training with the Armed Forces of the Philippines. The exercises are
designed to improve interoperability, increase readiness and continue to
improve professional relationships between the United States and the
Republic of the Philippines.&quot;Essex Sailors did an outstanding job supporting the Marines as well as
the Philippine Armed Forces during both exercises, further improving our
interoperability with our partner nation,&quot;said Capt. Brent Canady,
Essex&apos; commanding officer.&quot;Now that the exercises are complete we look
forward to a much deserved port visit in Subic Bay which provides an
opportunity to perform some community relations projects as well as
enrich our cultural understanding of each other.&quot;Essex arrived in Subic Bay to backload Marines assigned to the 31st
Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), who conducted ground-force training
during PHIBLEX and TV.

The Marines of the 31st MEU conducted an intensive series of training
exercises with their Filipino counterparts to improve their collective
warfighting capabilities. Training scenarios included live arms fire,
small unit tactics, and boat-raid training exercises.

With the operational phase of the exercises behind them, Sailors now
look to accomplish a great deal in terms of humanitarian assistance and
intercultural relations.

Sailors assigned to Essex are scheduled to participate in two community
relations projects in Olongapo City during the port visit. Both projects
involve minor repair work, painting, English lessons and a variety of
interactive friendship building activities.&quot;We are not just here in a military capacity,&quot;said Religious Program
Specialist 2nd Class Michael Brewer, of Hanford, Calif.&quot;We want to

NNS081030-03. Essex Welcomes Republic of the Philippines Contingent on Board

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Greg Johnson, USS Essex
Public Affairs

USS ESSEX, At Sea (NNS) -- U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines, Kristie
A. Kenney, and Philippine Marine Corps Deputy Commandant, Brig. Gen.
Natalio Ecarma, visited the forward-deployed amphibious assault ship USS
Essex (LHD 2) Oct. 26.

The visit came on the eve of a scheduled three-day port visit to Subic
Bay, Republic of the Philippines, and gave Kenney an opportunity to
directly express her appreciation for Essex Sailors&apos; hard work and effort.&quot;I know the Essex has had a lot of great tours and a lot of great
deployments,&quot;said Kenney.&quot;You were off the coast of Burma, waiting to
give assistance there; you&apos;ve been in the Philippines before doing our
annual exercises, and everywhere you go you really say to all of us that
&apos;America is great; America is strong, and America is compassionate.&apos; I
want to thank all of you for the great work you are doing, and I&apos;m
really proud to represent each and every one of you.&quot;During the visit, Kenney and Ecarma were treated to lunch with Essex,
Amphibious Squadron 11 and 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit leadership,
followed by an all-hands call with Kenney, during which she took the
time to personally greet many Essex Sailors.

Afterward, Kenney was given a brief tour of Essex&apos;s state-of-the-art
medical facility, which has four fully equipped operating rooms and an
ability to expand to a 600-bed hospital with a 14-bed intensive care
unit and 46-bed in-patient medical ward, the largest at sea with the
exception of hospital ships.

Essex&apos;s Commanding Officer, Capt. Brent Canady, said he hopes Kenney&apos;s
support will serve as inspiration, as Essex&apos; Sailors prepare to engage
in two community relations projects during their visit in Subic Bay.&quot;It&apos;s good for the Sailors to know that what they&apos;re doing is
appreciated,&quot;said Canady.&quot;We have the capability and the will to make
a big difference in many people&apos;s lives, and our humanitarian efforts in
the Philippines are a big part of our mission.&quot;While in Subic Bay, more than 90 Essex Sailors will spend their liberty
time participating in community relations projects at the Social
Development Center for Girls and the New Cabalan Elementary School in
Olongapo City. Projects will include minor repair work, English lessons
and personal interaction with the children.

Kenney said she appreciates the military efforts of Essex&apos;s Sailors, but
is especially thankful for their humanitarian work.&quot;You also make a difference by getting a chance to save people&apos;s lives,&quot;said Kenney.&quot;Whether you&apos;re saving their lives by building the schools
that they can go to school in, whether you&apos;re doing medical work, or
whether you&apos;re somebody on the ship whose job is helping to get the
planes on and off, helping to get the helicopters loaded or feeding the
folks who do all that work, you change people&apos;s lives.&quot;Essex is the only forward-deployed U.S. amphibious assault ship and
serves Task Force 76, the Navy&apos;s only forward-deployed amphibious force.
Task Force 76 is headquartered at White Beach Naval Facility, Okinawa,
Japan, with an operating detachment in Sasebo, Japan.

NNS081030-05. USS Robert G. Bradley Preps for AFRICOM Deployment

By Ensign Joshua Cowart, USS Robert G. Bradley Public Affairs

MAYPORT, Fla. (NNS) -- As the end of October approaches, the
guided-missile frigate USS Robert G. Bradley (FFG 49) is bustling with
final pre-deployment preparations, as the crew prepares for what will
be, perhaps, the most unique deployment of their naval careers.

Bradley will depart its homeport of Mayport near the end of November for
a routinely scheduled deployment to Africa Command (AFRICOM). On
deployment, Bradley will conduct theater security cooperation missions
to help African nations improve their security capacity. The crew will
also train forces, of the many African nations they visit, in visit,
board, search and seizure (VBSS) operations. VBSS teams are tasked with
boarding and securing suspect vessels, conducting searches, obtaining
intelligence and detaining persons of interest. Bradley&apos;s VBSS teams
will help train security forces and naval boarding teams in this vital
warfare area, thus allowing African countries to deter piracy in their
waters.

In addition to training, service members will participate in community
relations opportunities. Bradley Sailors will help strengthen the bonds
of friendship and trust between the United States and the many nations
of Africa by helping communities and showing African citizens that
Americans take great interest in and care about their welfare.

Cmdr. Clint Carroll, Bradley&apos;s commanding officer, recently spoke of the
ship&apos;s upcoming mission, what it would entail and how it will be
accomplished, during a commanding officer&apos;s call. Taking the time to
answer the many questions concerning ports of call, liberty and contact
with family, Carroll also reminded Sailors that the mission is vital. He
explained how the crew will set the tone for relations between the
United States and others. He reminded Sailors that the opinion of the
world will be directly affected by Bradley&apos;s actions while on this
deployment, calling on each individual Sailor to give their best.

The Sailors of Bradley are ready. Following an extremely successful
pre-deployment training cycle, crew members await the opportunity to put
to the test all of the skills that they have spent the year honing.

NNS081030-04. New Governance Structure for Next Generation Enterprise
Network Created

By Eddie Riley, Next Generation Enterprise Network Public Affairs

WASHINGTON (NNS) -- The Secretary of the Navy created a new assistant
chief of naval operations (ACNO) position Oct. 15 to ensure the Next
Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN) will be more reliable, secure and
responsive to the Department of Navy (DoN) work force.

The new directorate, the NGEN System Program Office (SPO), will
coordinate continued service for existing shore and garrison networks,
support consolidation of legacy networks and direct the transition to
NGEN while providing implementation oversight to enable enhanced
capabilities within the future Naval Network Environment (NNE).

NGEN is the DoN&apos;s first step in building the integrated naval networks
that will make up the NNE and is the follow-on to the Navy Marine Corps
Intranet (NMCI) when the current contract ends Sept. 30, 2010.&quot;The SPO reflects the Department of the Navy&apos;s commitment to the success
of the NGEN,&quot;said Rear Adm. David G. Simpson, director of Navy Networks
in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations for Communication
Networks (OPNAV N6). Simpson has been named interim NGEN SPO director.
The NGEN SPO will be led by a two-star admiral as director, who will
report to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) as ACNO and to the
Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC). A Marine colonel will serve as the
deputy director. Marine Corps Col. David M. Hagopian, has been named the
deputy director.&quot;It is an enterprise-wide approach for an enterprise-wide network,&quot;Simpson said.

The NGEN SPO, a first-of-its-kind organization in the DoN, was approved
by the CNO and CMC. It brings together the DoN&apos;s governance areas for
NGEN  policy, resources and requirements, acquisition, and fleet
readiness, support and operations  under a single command. The new
level of coordination at the NGEN SPO will ensure that stakeholders are
included in the design and implementation process and help facilitate a
smooth transition to NGEN from NMCI with no loss of services to end users.

The SPO will include all of the functions of the existing NGEN, NMCI and
OCONUS Navy Enterprise Network (ONE-NET) program offices and will reside
within the Navy staff, leveraging the institutional support of both CNO
and Headquarters Marine Corps staffs.

In the new governance structure, three key divisions have been
established to direct NGEN design, acquisition and implementation
activities: (1) acquisition, (2) operations, (3) programming, planning
and policy. The acquisition head reports to the Office of the Assistant
Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition (ASN
RDA) on all acquisition decisions and to the SPO director for day-to-day
and synchronization issues. The operations and programming, planning and
policy division heads reports to the SPO director, coordinating with
other commands and offices as needed.

The NGEN SPO is expected to be operational by the end of the year and
will exist through the transition to NGEN, at which time it will be
re-evaluated by the DoN.

NGEN is currently in the pre-decisional phase, with a requirements
document approved earlier this year by the CNO and CMC. A system
specification, currently under development, will further define the
required system functions and performance parameters. The acquisition
approach, currently under draft, will be based on a notional
segmentation concept that breaks existing network functions into groups
and separates services into those that may be run by the DoN and others
that could be outsourced. Under the current NMCI contract, network
services are provided by one prime contractor.

The DoN has held two industry days to get feedback from the information
technology community on the NGEN initiative and expects to hold at least
two more. The requests for proposals are expected to be released in the
spring.

NNS081030-01. Seabee Detachment Provides Critical Medical Education

By Steelworker 3rd Class (SCW) Siamac Moghaddam, Naval Mobile
Construction Battalion 4 Public Affairs

SAO TOME (NNS) -- Members of Naval Mobile Construction Battalion(NMCB) 4
set up a joint multinational medical seminar on the small island-nation
of Sao Tome and Principe Oct. 16.

The request came from the commandant of the local Coast Guard.

The medical training was arranged by Chief Hospital Corpsman Julio Ortiz
in an effort to improve medical care in the local military and to share
modern life-saving medical techniques with the military forces of Sao
Tome and Principe.

The one-day training seminar included morning and afternoon sessions
covering various topics. During the morning training, participants
learned how to properly apply effective tourniquets and pressure
dressings combined with the use of pressure points.&quot;Here in Sao Tome, we do not get the quality training the medics and
Seabees provided to us, so the training was especially valuable to us
here at the Coast Guard,&quot;Coast Guardsman 3rd Class Carla Luciao said.

Topics including IV Therapy, treatment of shock and the ABCs of CPR were
covered in the afternoon, along with a lab and practical application.
Each attending member of the Sao Tome and Principe Coast Guard had the
opportunity to practice CPR and rescue breathing on a dummy.&quot;With the Coast Guard conducting lot of maritime operations, the
training they received today in cardio- pulmonary resuscitation will
greatly improve their ability to save lives,&quot;Ortiz said.

The training sessions will continue with a new group of Coast Guardsmen
receiving first aid education each week.

NNS081029-23. PCU George H.W. Bush Sailors Fall With Golden Knights

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Lawrence M. Shannon, PCU
George H.W. Bush Public Affairs

MAXTON, N.C. (NNS) -- Being selected as Pre-Commissioning Unit (PCU)
George H.W. Bush&apos;s (CVN 77) Junior Sailor of the Year (JSOY) and Blue
Jacket of the Year afforded two Sailors the opportunity to jump at more
than 14,500 feet with the U.S. Army&apos;s elite parachute team, Golden
Knights, Oct. 14.

In recognition for their outstanding performance, Postal Clerk 1st Class
(SW) Leigh Vaughn and Hospital Corpsman 3rd Class Tyler Cook found
themselves standing at the edge of doorway of a plane, with the wind
whipping them in the face, about to take a step they would never forget.

The Sailors spent the first part of the morning getting tandem jump
instructions about what to do before, during and after the jump from
their instructor, Sgt. 1st Class Billy Vansoelen, who has been with the
Golden Knights for 14 years.&quot;I think that&apos;s very cool that the Bush is bringing some of the troops
out to show them a good time and jump with the world famous United
States Army Parachute Team,&quot;Vansoelen said.

After the classroom instruction, the Sailors got into their jump suits
and harnesses and headed out toward the plane. Once the plane reached
altitude, it was time to jump. Each had a qualified Golden Knight tandem
jumper strapped to their back to take them on the ride of his and her life.&quot;I was more excited than anything else,&quot;Cook said.&quot;As soon as we hit
the ground I wanted to go back up and do it again. I thought it was one
of the coolest things I&apos;ve ever done. There&apos;s nothing like falling and
having the ground come at you at 150 plus miles per hour.&quot;&quot;I was nervous about the initial jump and maybe the parachute not
opening,&quot;Vaughn said,&quot;but the Golden Knights made it a good experience.&quot;It was PCU Bush Command Master Chief, CMDCM (AW/NAC) Jon D. Port, who
put the plan into action for them. Port had the opportunity to jump with
the Golden Knights in August after meeting them at the rededication
ceremony of the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum. After his
jump, the Golden Knights extended the invitation for Port to bring his
JSOY and BJOY to Fort Bragg for the jump.&quot;What&apos;s more important for a command master chief to do than to take his
Sailors of the year, Sailors of the quarter or Sailor of the week, and
take the time to recognize that Sailor and show them something special,&quot;Port said.&quot;I was thrilled,&quot;Port said about seeing his Sailors jump.&quot;I got as
much of a thrill watching each of them land for the first time because I
know how they felt.&quot;&quot;The most memorable part of it for me was watching the plane leave, the
parachute opening up and the view,&quot;Vaughn said.

After the jump, the Sailors received a certificate and a DVD of their
jump from their tandem instructors and then headed to Fort Bragg to tour
the Golden Knights&apos; headquarters building. While there, they had the
opportunity to see their extensive trophy case and display case that
includes memorabilia and photos from when the namesake of their ship,
former President George H.W. Bush jumped with them.

DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME UPDATE 01: The prominent English builder and
outdoorsman William Willett conceived Daylight Savings Time in 1905
during a pre-breakfast ride, when he observed with dismay how many
Londoners slept through a large part of a summer day. An avid golfer, he
also disliked cutting short his round at dusk. His solution was to
advance the clock during the summer months, a proposal he published two
years later. He lobbied unsuccessfully for the proposal until his death
in 1915. Germany, its World War I allies, and their occupied zones were
the first European nations to use Willett&apos;s invention, starting 30 APR
16. Britain, most of its allies, and many European neutrals soon
followed suit. Russia and a few other countries waited until the next
year. In 1918, the United States came to the same realization and
enacted a law to both preserve daylight and provide standard time for
the nation.. It was an unpopular law, and in 1919 was repealed over
President Wilson&apos;s veto. However, some localities liked the DST concept
and continued it. During WWII, the nation, for the years of 1942 - 1945
went under DST year around, which was called&quot;War Time&quot;. Since then, the
world has seen many enactments, adjustments, and repeals. In 1966, 1972,
and 1986, Congress passed various laws concerning the issues of time and
daylight savings.

 Most of the United States begins Daylight Saving Time at 2:00 a.m.
on the second Sunday in March and reverts to standard time on the first
Sunday in November. In the U.S., each time zone switches at a different
time. This began in 2007. The 2007 U.S. change was part of the Energy
Policy Act of 2005; previously, from 1987 through 2006, the start and
end dates were the first Sunday in April and the last Sunday in October,
and Congress retains the right to go back to the previous dates once an
energy-consumption study is done. In the U.S., 2:00 a.m. was originally
chosen as the changeover time because it was practical and minimized
disruption. Most people were at home and this was the time when the
fewest trains were running. It is late enough to minimally affect bars
and restaurants, and it prevents the day from switching to yesterday,
which would be confusing. It is early enough that the entire continental
U.S. switches by daybreak, and the changeover occurs before most early
shift workers and early churchgoers are affected. For the U.S. and its
territories, Daylight Saving Time is NOT observed in Hawaii, American
Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of
Northern Mariana Islands, and Arizona. The Navajo Nation participates in
the Daylight Saving Time policy, even in Arizona, due to its large size
and location in three states. To keep track just remember Spring (i.e.
MAR) forward&amp;Fall (i.e NOV) back. [Source: [Source: EANGUS Minuteman

VOTES COUNT: Almost 125 million people voted in the 2004 presidential
election. In case your wondering if your vote really counts here&apos;s a
smattering of close elections:

o In 1972, Dorothy Wilson was re-elected as a Nevada justice of peace by
the flip of a coin.
o Campaigning for a seat on the Massachusetts Governor&apos;s Council on the
day of the primary election in 1988, Herbert Connolly lost track of time
- and got to his polling place too late to vote. The polls had closed
just minutes before. When the ballots were counted later that night,
he&apos;d lost by one vote.
o In 2000, the Presidential election was decided by 537 votes, between
George Bush and Al Gore.
o In 2002, in a Congressional race in the 7th District of Colorado, only
121 votes separated the top two candidates, Bob Beauprez and Mike Feeney.
o In 2004, the Washington state governor&apos;s race came down to 133
important voters who favored Christine Gregoire over Dino Rossi.
o In 2006, Connecticut&apos;s 2nd Congressional District was decided by only
83 votes, giving Joe Courtney the seat over Rob Simmons.

LTC CATCH 22: The phenomenon of middle-class, middle-aged Americans
stretched to their emotional and financial limits caring for sick
spouses or parents is one that&apos;s already widespread and likely to get
worse, experts say. Once private insurance benefits end, the only option
for most Americans is Medicaid, which requires that recipients have less
than $5,000 in assets. This means that couples are elders must exhaust
most of their remaining assets to qualify. In the case of couples one
option is divorce. Some statistics that support a worsening situation are:

o U.S. Census figures project that the number of Americans 65 or over
will double by 2030, and that two-thirds of today&apos;s 65-year-olds will
require some period of long-term care later in their lives.
o According to one recent study, the number of geriatricians has
actually declined in recent years, to about 7,750: that translates to
one for every 4,254 older Americans.
o It&apos;s projected that the country will face a shortage of more than
800,000 nurses by 2020.
o According to U.S. government surveys, in 2004, there were 2.5 million
Americans living in either nursing homes or assisted living facilities.
The average cost of a private room in a nursing home, according to a
recent MetLife study: $75,000 per year.
o The AARP notes that two-thirds of older Americans who needed
long-term care now rely completely on unpaid help -- in most cases, family.

Carol Raphael, president of the Visiting Nurse Service of New York, who
joined other experts at a recent media briefing in New York City on
eldercare said,&quot;The trouble is, caregivers just feel utterly unprepared
for their role. Many of the family caregivers VNS staffers encounter
feel left out of crucial decisions concerning their loved one&apos;s care.
They are often on the border -- they aren&apos;t even included in thinking
about how care will be provided.&quot;Another big challenge -- caregivers
are often confronted with an array of doctors, procedures, paperwork and
facilities, with no one to help pull it all together. In the current
system, there&apos;s no one accountable. Raphael said,&quot;That&apos;s why it can
cost you $125 an hour [for a geriatric care manager], because you&apos;re
trying to fill that hole.&quot;Too often, chronically ill patients and their
families simply lurch from one crisis to the next, with no continuity of
care to make sure that once patients leave the hospital; they aren&apos;t
getting readmitted a few weeks later. AARP president Jennie Chin Hansen,
who has 40 years of experience as a nurse said,&quot;Care has to be
coordinated and supported. We have to be preventing things from
happening because there are things that we know cause you to go to the
hospital again: taking the wrong medications while you&apos;re back home, for
example.&quot;Chin and other experts focused especially on the crucial 30
days after a hospital discharge. Close monitoring and follow-up during
that month can greatly reduce unnecessary suffering and cost, they said.

 Across America, much of the in-home care that is provided is
carried out by home health care aides, who are often woefully
under-trained, the experts said.&quot;They are the glue that is holding the
home health care system together,&quot;said Raphael. But, she added, she is
shocked that in most states we have very minimum training requirements
for these para-professional workers who are handling very complex
cases.&quot;In New York State, for example, home health care workers are
required to undergo 120 hours of training before getting certification.
That might sound OK, until you realize that finger-nail technicians in
California need to have 350 hours of training to be certified to work in
a salon..&quot;The pay scale [for home health aides] is also relatively low,
and they don&apos;t have health care benefits, on top of that,&quot;Chin added.
Wage issues are keeping the number of geriatricians at an all-time low,
as well. Geriatricians are crucial, the experts said, because they look
not at a particular disease or body site, but at the older person as a
whole. However, a recent U.S. Institute of Medicine report found that
geriatricians remain the lowest paid medical specialty of all. Boosting
the number of geriatricians, nurses and well-trained home health care
aides will be a top priority in easing the eldercare&quot;squeeze,&quot;the
experts agreed.

 The same can be said for recent moves by government and medical
institutions to cut down on red tape and better coordinate care,
especially between the hospital and home. In the meantime, aging
Americans should plan wisely, especially since resources vary widely
state by state. One good resource: The National Association of Area
Agencies on Aging (www.n4a.org), found in every state, can give details
on what&apos;s available to you locally. It also pays to think about how you
will pay for long-term care, since Medicaid only kicks in after personal
finances are exhausted -- something Raphael labeled a policy of
pauperization. In the end, it will be middle-income Americans who feel
the squeeze most, according to journalist Gail Sheehy, who is currently
writing a book about her care-giving spouse experience.&quot;For people who
are very wealthy, if the family cares about the loved one, they&apos;ll be
able to provide this care. And the poor finally get a break, because
they can get on Medicaid,&quot;she said.&quot;But it&apos;s the vast lower-middle to
upper-middle class that is really getting the shaft.&quot;[Source: Helath

MOBILIZED RESERVE 28 OCT 08: The Army, Air Force and Marine Corps
announced the current number of reservists on active duty as of 28 OCT
08 in support of the partial mobilization. The net collective result is
882 fewer reservists mobilized than last reported in the Bulletin for 15
OCT 08. At any given time, services may mobilize some units and
individuals while demobilizing others, making it possible for these
figures to either increase or decrease. The total number currently on
active duty in support of the partial mobilization of the Army National
Guard and Army Reserve is 95,327; Navy Reserve, 6,177; Air National
Guard and Air Force Reserve, 10,606; Marine Corps Reserve, 7,197; and
the Coast Guard Reserve, 758. This brings the total National Guard and

VA NURSING UPDATE 01: Nurses are the largest group of health care
providers employed by the Veterans Affairs Department, but its medical
centers face significant hurdles in recruiting and retaining them,
according to a new report. The Government Accountability Office (GAO)
recommended that VA implement a new staffing system and assess the
barriers to alternative work schedules to improve the situation.
According to VA nursing officials, retention problems stem from nurses
spending too much time performing non-nursing duties such as
housekeeping and clerical tasks, GAO said. Also, while the department&apos;s
medical centers were authorized in 2004 to offer RNs alternative work
schedules, such as three 12-hour shifts within a week to be considered
full-time for pay and benefits purposes, few nurse executives reported
offering such schedules. Nursing officials and RNs noted that retention
problems also result from relying on supplemental staffing strategies,
such as overtime, and insufficient professional development opportunities.

 Maintaining the nurse workforce at VA is critical to the care of
the veteran population since studies have shown that a shortage of
nurses, especially when combined with a greater workload, can adversely
affect patients and the care they receive. For example, hospitals with
fewer nurses have demonstrated higher rates of problems such as urinary
tract infections and pneumonia, the report said.&quot;Conversely, an
increase in RN staffing has been associated with a reduction in adverse
patient care events and with better quality outcomes such as fewer
infections,&quot;GAO noted. Additionally, the agency found that VA did not
have an adequate staffing plan for nurses, largely because a patient
classification system the medical centers used to determine staffing
included outdated and inaccurate data. As a result, nurse managers do
not rely on that data to help set nurse staffing levels, but on
information from a variety of sources, including historical data or
workforce data from other hospitals. While VA said it intends to develop
a new nurse staffing system, GAO noted that the department has not
developed a detailed action plan that includes a timetable for building,
testing and implementing such a system.

 Meanwhile, VA nurse executives also identified limitations on the
department&apos;s ability to hire new nurses. For example, VA-imposed hiring
freezes and delays discourage potential candidates from seeking
employment or following through on applications at its medical centers.
Although VA has taken steps to address some of the factors that
contribute to hiring delays, GAO found,&quot;it is too early to determine
the extent to which these steps have been effective in reducing hiring
delays.&quot;GAO recommended that VA develop a specific plan that includes a
timetable for developing a process that provides nurse staffing
estimates that accurately account for the severity of patients&apos;
illnesses, the current nursing tasks performed in inpatient units and
the level of nursing support available. GAO also recommended that the
department assess the obstacles to alternative and flexible work
schedules for nurses and explore ways to overcome those barriers. VA
agreed with GAO&apos;s findings and recommendations, noting that it plans to
develop a new nurse staffing system. The Office of Nursing Service also
plans to create a special task force to identify options for expanding
alternative and flexible work schedules. [Source: GovExec.com newsletter

VA BLUE WATER CLAIMS UPDATE 04: The American Legions Veteran Affairs
and Rehabilitation (VA&amp;R) Commission tracks and provides Bulletins on
Blue Water Claims They have had a longstanding position (resolution)
supporting the premise that shipboard service in Vietnam&apos;s territorial
waters constitutes service in the Republic of Vietnam for the purpose of
presumption of exposure to herbicides (Agent Orange) during the Vietnam
War. Following is a summary of legal actions to date in efforts by the
American Legion and the National Veterans Legal Services Program (NVLSP)
to get the VA to accept Agent Orange related claims from&quot;Blue Water&quot;Navy veterans:

o August 16, 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans
Claims (CAVC) held in Haas v. Nicholson (now Haas v. Peake) that Vietnam
veterans who served in the waters off Vietnam (&quot;Blue Water&quot;Navy
veterans) are entitled to disability benefits for diseases related to
exposure to Agent Orange.
o May 12, 2008, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) appealed the
CAVC&apos;s decision to United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
o May 8, 2008, the Federal Circuit issued a decision reversing the
decision of the CAVC in Haas v. Peake.
o June 23, 2008, the attorneys for Mr. Haas, the National Veterans Legal
Services Program (NVLSP), filed a Combined Petition for Panel Rehearing
or Rehearing En Banc.
o June 30, 2008, The American Legion, Military Order of the Purple
Heart, and United Spinal Association filed an Amici Curiae Brief in
support of Mr. Haas&apos; petition for rehearing.
o September 12, 2008 VA filed its opposition to the petition for rehearing.
o October 9, 2008, the Federal Circuit denied the petition for rehearing.
o October 17, 2008, Mr. Haas&apos; attorneys filed a Petition for a Writ of
Certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court asking the Court to overturn the
Federal Circuit&apos;s decision in Haas that denied Agent Orange-related VA
benefits to Blue Water Vietnam Veterans.
o November 21, 2008 due date for VA&apos;s response to the petition. The
Supreme Court only grants certiorari in about one percent of cases and,
even if they agree to hear the case, there is no guarantee that Mr. Haas
would win on the merits.

SSA DISABILITY CLAIMS UPDATE 01: Despite hiring new judges with an
additional $150 million in funding, the Social Security Administration&apos;s
massive backlog of years-old disability claims has not been appreciably
reduced over the last year, although the agency has processed most cases
that have been in the pipeline the longest. A person claiming disability
benefits must prove to the Social Security Administration (SSA) that she
or he is unable to perform any degree of work in order to begin
receiving Social Security Disability Insurance. Initial applications are
often denied, leading to an appeal to an administrative law judge (ALJ)
for reconsideration. More than 760,000 cases were pending review from an
ALJ at the end of September. This is 14,000 more cases than were pending
in SEP 07, and shows that growth in the backlog had slowed
significantly. Previously, SSA had added about 70,000 cases to its
backlog annually. According to agency data, the average wait for a
decision in SEP 08 was 509 days. This is slightly longer than the
average wait one year ago. During fiscal year 2008, SSA hired 190 new
ALJs, opened a National Hearing Center (NHC), and eliminated virtually
the entire backlog of over 135,000 cases that had been waiting over 900
days for a hearing decision. SSA notes that the hiring of new ALJs was
critical, but it will take a number of months before they become fully
productive. The NHC will give SSA the capability of conducting video
hearings in cities with the worst backlogs. The agency is also working
with the Government Services Administration to establish new hearing
offices. [Source: Medicare Watch 28 Oct 08++]

PROSTATE CANCER UPDATE 07: A large government study of whether Vitamin
E and selenium protect men against prostate cancer has been suspended,
federal health officials announced 29 OCT 08, after an independent
analysis determined that the nutrients did not reduce the risk for the
common malignancy. The $119 million study, involving more than 35,000
men, also found hints that the nutrients might increase the risk for
prostate cancer and diabetes, although officials stressed that those
findings may be a coincidence. Nevertheless, the study&apos;s organizers had
begun notifying participants to stop taking the pills they were
receiving, and offered to tell them whether they were taking the
nutrients or placebos. All the participants will continue to have their
health monitored for about three years. The announcement marks the
latest in a series of disappointing findings about the potential health
benefits of vitamins and other nutritional supplements, which earlier
studies had indicated could have a host of advantages. One theory was
that antioxidants could mop up damaging free radicals, which are a
natural byproduct of cellular processes in the body. But subsequent
studies testing antioxidants and other nutritional supplements have not
confirmed the benefits, and several have even been alarming. For
example, beta carotene increased, rather than decreased, the risk of
lung cancer among smokers, and Vitamin E -- also touted as helping to
prevent heart disease -- appeared to boost the overall risk.

 The new study was funded by the National Institutes of Health after
earlier studies indicated the nutrients may protect against prostate
cancer, the most common cancer in men after skin cancer. Men age 50 and
older received one or both of the nutrients or placebos at 400 sites in
the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada. An independent panel of
experts monitoring the study discovered, after men had been taking the
supplements for about five years, that there was no benefit but that
there were suggestions of possible harm, prompting officials to stop the
project.&quot;The important message for consumers is that taking
supplements, whether antioxidants or others, is not necessarily
beneficial and could be harmful,&quot;said Eric Klein of the Cleveland
Clinic, a study coordinator.&quot;You should not be taking them unless there
is a rigorous scientific study that shows a benefit. Andrew Shao of the
Council for Responsible Nutrition, an industry group, said in a
statement that the findings did not&quot;discount the value of taking
vitamin E and selenium for other general benefits.&quot;[Source: Washington

SSA COMPASSIONATE ALLOWANCES: Social Security has an obligation to
provide benefits quickly to applicants whose medical conditions are so
serious that their conditions obviously meet disability standards.
Compassionate allowances are a way of quickly identifying diseases and
other medical conditions that invariably qualify under the Listing of
Impairments based on minimal objective medical information. The
Compassionate allowances initiative will allow Social Security to
quickly target the most obviously disabled individuals for allowances
based on objective medical information that they can obtain quickly.
Commissioner Astrue has held two Compassionate Allowance public outreach
hearings. The first was on rare diseases and the second was on cancers.
A third hearing on brain injuries is planned for 18 NOV 08. The initial
list of Compassionate Allowance conditions was developed as a result of
information received at public outreach hearings, public comment on an
Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, comments received from the Social
Security and Disability Determination Service communities, and the
counsel of medical and scientific experts. Also, SSA considered which
conditions are most likely to meet their current definition of
disability. For additional info on how the allowances are processed
refer to https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/lnx/0423022000 !opendocument. The
list of 25 rare diseases and 25 cancers which follows have been selected

MEDICARE PART D UPDATE 29: The Centers for Medicare&amp;Medicaid
Services (CMS) will no longer reimburse hospitals for ten categories of
preventable medical errors that result in serious risk of injury to
patients. CMS prohibits hospitals to charge people with Medicare for the
additional costs associated with treating these conditions. Hospitals
will now assume the costs of procedures associated with&quot;never events,&quot;so called because they should never occur. While Medicare will save $21
million as a result of the new policy, the primary purpose of the rule
is to improve quality of care for people with Medicare by creating
greater incentives for doctors and hospitals to avoid preventable
errors. The expectation is that if these errors affect hospitals&apos;
overall budgets, doctors and hospitals will take more aggressive
measures to prevent these errors. The ten categories of&quot;never events&quot;Medicare no longer covers include remedial treatments related to foreign
objects retained by patients after surgery; transfusion of incompatible
blood; falls and traumas during a hospital stay; manifestations of poor
glycemic controls; catheter-associated urinary tract infections;
surgical site infection following a coronary artery bypass graft or
orthopedic surgery; and deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism.

MEDICARE PART D UPDATE 30: Recent reports indicate that some of the
major national Medicare private health plans are going to pay
independent agents $500-plus per year over five years--$2,500 in
total--for every new enrollee they sign up for their&quot;Medicare
Advantage&quot;plans. The new totals are at least double the top commissions
typically paid over the last couple of years--a period when people with
Medicare were regularly victimized by predatory agents looking to make a
quick buck. Older adults and people with disabilities were bullied or
tricked into Medicare private health plans that no longer allowed them
to see their doctors or that stuck them with high out-of-pocket costs
when they fell ill. These new commissions are an attempt by some of the
major plans to undermine efforts by the Centers for Medicare&amp;Medicaid
Services (CMS) to restrain commissions and in particular to eliminate
incentives for agents to&quot;churn&quot;--move customers from plan to plan just
to earn commissions. Many agents believe that these higher commissions
actually increase incentives to churn.
 CMS should not allow Medicare Advantage plans to pay these
commissions. The agency has broad authority, under the Medicare
Improvements for Patients and Providers Act, to establish commission
guidelines that create&quot;incentives for agents and brokers to enroll
individuals in the Medicare Advantage plan that is intended to best meet
their health care needs.&quot;Asclepios contends:
- There should be no incentive to move someone from one Medicare
Advantage plan to another just to earn a higher commission.
- There should be no incentive to move someone from a Medigap
supplemental plan to a Medicare Advantage plan just to earn a higher
commission.

With those twin goals in mind, CMS should establish a cap on commissions
consistent with existing requirements to pay level commissions over 5
years, starting with the 2009 plan year. The cap should be set at a
level that approximates current renewal rates for Medicare Advantage
enrollments made in 2007 and 2008. And it should approximate Medigap
renewal rates for a healthy 66-year-old, the low-cost consumer that
Medicare Advantage plans target for enrollment. With those parameters,
commissions would be capped at well under half the rates Medicare
Advantage plans are now proposing to pay. Remember, Medicare Advantage
plans are paying these commissions out of subsidies they receive from
taxpayers. It is outrageous that any of these subsidies, which are
supposed to pay for the health care of older adults and people with
disabilities, are diverted to pay commissions to enroll people with
Medicare in plans that cost taxpayers more money--$150 billion over the
next ten years--than it costs to provide care under Original Medicare.
Unfortunately, there is zero chance that the current administration will
ban Medicare private health plans from paying commissions, just as it
has opposed any effort by Congress to reduce the excessive subsidies
these plans receive. For that, more comprehensive solution, we will have
to wait until after the election. [Source: Asclepios Weekly Medicare

VA MEANS TEST: By law VA is required to verify the self-reported gross
household income (veteran, spouse and dependents, if any) of certain
nonservice-connected or noncompensable 0% service-connected veterans to
confirm the accuracy of their Eligibility for VA health care, Copay
status, and Enrollment priority group assignment. VA verifies veterans&apos;
gross household income (spouse and dependents, if any) provided by the
veteran on the financial assessment (means test). This financial
information is verified by matching financial records maintained by the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Social Security Administration
(SSA). If the result of the income match reveals that the veteran&apos;s
gross household income is higher than the established VA national means
test threshold, the veteran will be contacted via mail to help resolve
the income discrepancy. These contacts from VA gives the veteran and
spouse the opportunity to dispute income as reported by IRS and SSA
and/or reduce the total gross household income by providing proof of
allowable deductible expenses

 VA requires most veterans not receiving VA disability compensation
or pension payments to provide information on their annual gross
household income and net worth to determine whether they are below the
annually-adjusted VA national means test threshold (income threshold),
in order to qualify for exemption from outpatient, inpatient and
medication copays. The financial assessment includes all gross household
income and net worth, including Social Security, retirement pay,
unemployment insurance, interest and dividends, workers&apos; compensation,
black lung benefits and any other gross household income. Also
considered are assets such as the market value of property that is NOT
the primary residence, stocks, bonds, notes, individual retirement
accounts, bank deposits, savings accounts and cash. VA also compares
veterans&apos; financial assessments with geographically based income
thresholds. If the veteran&apos;s income is above the VA national means test
threshold and below the geographic means test (GMT) thresholds where the
veteran lives, they are eligible for an 80% reduction in inpatient
co-pay rates. For more information about geographically based income
thresholds, go to the GMT eligibility page.

 The veteran (and spouse if applicable) will be provided an
opportunity to review the discrepancy between their reported income and
the IRS and SSA data. If there is an error or other explanation for the
discrepancy this information is provided by the veteran to VA for
review. If we have not received a response from the veteran with 45
days, we will attempt to independently verify the total gross household
income. This process entails us contacting all employers and financial
institutions that reported income to the Internal Revenue Service and
Social Security Administration. If no response is received from the
veteran within 75 days, VA considers that due process requirements have
been met and action is initiated to make appropriate eligibility, copay
and enrollment status changes. Veterans subject to this process are
individually notified by mail and provided with all related information.
 At the end of the income verification process, if it is determined that
the veteran&apos;s gross household income is higher than the VA national
means test income threshold:

- The veteran&apos;s priority group assignment will be changed.
- The veteran will be required to pay health care and medication copayments.
- VA health care facilities that provided care to the veteran will be
notified to bill the veteran for services provided for their
nonservice-connected conditions during the period covered by the income
assessment.
- The veteran will be provided with due process/appeal rights

If the veteran is financially unable to pay the assessed copay charges,
there are three options available:

1. Request a Waiver of Debt for the past debts you owe. A Waiver of
Debt can be granted when there has been a significant change in income
and the veteran has experienced significant expenses for medical care
for the veteran or other family members, funeral arrangements or veteran
educational expenses. A Waiver of Debt excuses all existing bills, but
does not prevent future charges. A waiver must be requested in writing
and by completing VA Form 5655, Financial Status Report. The request
must specify each copayment for which a waiver is being requested. There
is no limit on the amount that the veteran can request to be waived. The
veteran must request a waiver in writing within 180 days from the date
on the bill. To request a waiver, and for more information, contact the
Revenue Coordinator at the VA health care facility where the veteran
receives their care.

2. Request a Hardship Determination to prevent future billing. A
Hardship Determination is an exemption from copay for a determined
period of time. If a veteran&apos;s current year income is substantially
reduced from the prior year, a veteran may request a Hardship
Determination. Hardship Determination must be requested in writing. To
request a Hardship Determination, contact the Enrollment Coordinator at
the VA Medical Center where the veteran receives their care.

3. Request an Offer in Compromise. An Offer in Compromise is an offer
for past debts only and acceptance of a partial payment in settlement
and full satisfaction of the debt at the time the offer is made. VA will
consider both the current and anticipated future income in making these
determinations. Most Offers in Compromise that are accepted must be for
a lump sum payment payable in full 30 days from the date of acceptance
of the offer.
Offers in Compromise must be requested in writing and by completing VA
Form 5655, Financial Status Report. There is no limit on the amount that
the veteran can request for the Offer in Compromise. To request an Offer
in Compromise, contact the Revenue Office at the VA Medical Center where
the veteran receives their care.

FLU SHOTS UPDATE 02: Experts are making their annual plea for people
50-plus and other at-risk groups to get their shots. Public health
officials say a new vaccine from five different manufacturers has been
shipped to clinics and doctors&apos; offices around the country. There should
be enough to go around. According to Julie Gerberding, M.D., director of
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), between 143
million and 146 million doses are available, ruling out any shortage
like the one that occurred in 2004, when the vaccine supply was cut in
half. Influenza--the fancy word for the flu--is an infectious
respiratory disease, caused by a virus which can be really dangerous to
at-risk groups, including the older people, infants and people with
chronic diseases. Flu and bacterial pneumonia--a common complication of
flu--each year send 200,000 people to hospitals in the United States and
cause on average 36,000 deaths. Immunizations usually help individuals
avoid the flu, but public health officials are concerned that this
season, people may be reluctant to be inoculated. That&apos;s because last
year&apos;s circulating virus strains did not match up with the vaccine, so
more people came down with the flu. Vaccine formulations are determined
each year by scientists who look at the dominant strains in the Southern
Hemisphere. In February they recommend the three viruses that are most
likely to strike the United States in the next flu season.

 Usually one or two strains are used from the previous year&apos;s
vaccine. But this year&apos;s formulation is&quot;unprecedented,&quot;says Anthony S.
Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases (NIAID), because the vaccine has been manufactured
with three new strains. In 16 of the last 19 years, the vaccine has been
a good match with prevailing viruses, says Joe Bresee, M.D., head of the
CDC&apos;s flu prevention effort. Normally, a shot works for 70 to 90% of
those immunized, he says, but last year only 44% were protected. The
vaccine has come under scrutiny from various sources. In fact, some
doctors don&apos;t think it prevents disease in the older population. They
point to a study published in the British medical journal the Lancet on
2 AUG, which found that the vaccine didn&apos;t lower the risk of pneumonia.
Researchers at the Group Health Center for Health Studies in Seattle
found that older people who are the most likely to get a flu shot are
generally healthy and the least likely to get pneumonia, while those too
weak or frail to get to the doctor&apos;s office for a vaccination are the
most vulnerable. Factoring in the variations in health status, the
vaccine appeared to make little difference in pneumonia risk. The
findings were based on a review of thousands of medical charts of older
members of a Seattle HMO.

 A new CDC report shows that in 2006, 72% of those older than 65
were vaccinated, but only 42% of individuals ages 50 to 64 and 35% of
18- to 49-year-olds were immunized. Just 42% of health workers got the
shots. And a new consumer survey commissioned by the National Foundation
for Infectious Diseases (NFID) shows that four in 10 patients say
they&apos;ve never even talked with their doctors about being vaccinated.
What&apos;s likely to get more people to roll up their sleeves is a
longer-lasting vaccine that confers immunity from year to year.&quot;I think
that&apos;s the ultimate endgame and endpoint, but we&apos;re not there yet,
obviously,&quot;says Fauci. Currently, NIAID is spending about $94 million
on developing vaccines for different types of flu, up from just $3.6
million in 2000, before the 9/11 attacks, the anthrax scare and worries
about avian flu.&quot;People may question whether the vaccine is effective,&quot;adds the CDC&apos;s Bresee,&quot;but they need to remember it&apos;s still the best
protection we have year in and year out.&quot;You do not need a doctor&apos;s
prescription to obtain a flu shot. Three types of vaccines are available
with various means to access them:
o Traditional flu shot consisting of a&quot;killed&quot;virus for healthy people
older than six months.
o Nose spray consisting of a weakened live virus for healthy people ages
2 to 49 years (but not pregnant women).
o A one-time vaccination against bacterial pneumonia, a common
complication of flu, for those 65 and older and nursing home residents.
o Flu shots generally cost between $15 and $30, but check hospitals,
senior centers, pharmacies (i.e. Rite Aid, CVC, etc.) and public clinics
in your community for free or low-cost shots.
o Some polling places are offering flu shots on Election Day through the
Vote and Vax program.
o Medicare pays for the total cost of flu and pneumonia vaccinations,
and so do many private health plans.

Pneumococcal disease (such as meningitis) and other bacterial infections
can follow flu and cause secondary infections that worsen flu symptoms
and increase the risk of flu-related death. For example, it&apos;s believed
that bacterial infections caused almost half of the deaths of young
soldiers during the 1918 worldwide flu pandemic, according to background
information in an Emory University news release. Keith P. Klugman,
professor of global health at Emory&apos;s Rollins School of Public Health,
created a predictive model to estimate the public health and economic
effect current influenza vaccination practices would have on children
younger than two years old during a flu pandemic. The model showed that
current PCV vaccination practices lower costs in a typical flu season by
$1.4 billion and would cut costs by $7 billion in a pandemic. It also
predicted that PCV vaccination would prevent 1.24 million cases of
pneumonia and 357,000 pneumococcal-related deaths in a pandemic.

RC DISABILITY CLAIMS: The head of the Reserve Officers Association
said he hopes a study ordered by Congress will explain the big
discrepancies in veterans&apos; disability benefits awarded to active and
reserve component (RC) forces. Retired Marine Lt. Gen. Dennis McCarthy,
ROA&apos;s executive director, said 22 OCT that there may be good reasons why
National Guard and reserve members are more likely to have their
veterans&apos; claims denied and to receive lower disability ratings -- but
those reasons are not immediately clear, and the Department of Veterans
Affairs does not have a good explanation.&quot;We really need to keep on
them until this study is done,&quot;McCarthy said, noting that veterans must
have confidence that the disability system is fair. Retired Rear Adm.
Patrick Dunne, VA&apos;s undersecretary for benefits, met with McCarthy to
discuss the discrepancies in disability compensation, which were first
reported earlier this month by Military Times. The report, based on
information obtained by Veterans for Common Sense, showed that 45%t of
active-duty veterans of operations in Afghanistan and Iraq had filed
disability claims, compared with 23% of Guard and reserve members who
deployed to the war zones. Just 4% of claims by active-duty veterans
were denied by VA, while 11% of claims from Guard and reserve members
were denied.

 Dunne did not dispute the report, McCarthy said, and said VA is
trying to determine why there is such a big difference. Dunne suggested
that one possible explanation might be that active-duty veterans
accumulate more service-connected disabilities over a career than Guard
and reserve members. McCarthy said Dunne tried to assure ROA that there
is no outright discrimination against Guard or reserve members.&quot;That
they are going to do a study is a good sign,&quot;McCarthy said.&quot;This is a
difficult time for VA and they have a lot of big issues facing them.&quot;The demographic study of disability claims promised by Dunne was ordered
by Congress, and VA is looking for a private company to study the
differences between active and reserve veterans by age, locations where
claims are filed and where veterans live to determine why there are
differences and whether some people are being treated unfairly. The
study will take more than a year to complete. [Source: ArmyTimes Rick

VA RETRO PAY PROJECT UPDATE 15: A Pentagon financing office said 23
OCT it has begun a review of a veterans&apos; claims program that a House
lawmaker says has made payment errors reaching millions of dollars. Tom
LaRock, spokesman for the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS),
said the office&apos;s director, Teresa McKay,&quot;has expressed her commitment
to ensure that the veterans receive the benefits they are due. If
mistakes were made, we will take appropriate steps to correct them.&quot;On
22 OCT, Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) wrote McKay, saying his office had
calculated that nearly 2,000 severely disabled veterans were wrongly
denied payments under a program that extends retroactive benefits for
retired veterans whose disabilities were linked to combat or military
service. He said there were also inaccuracies -- both overpayments and
underpayments -- for an additional 2,500 veterans who received benefits
in excess of $2,500. Kucinich said the total cost of the errors in the
VA Retro program was about $20 million. On 23 OCT, he revised that
figure to about $12 million but said the number of affected veterans was
unchanged. He urged McKay to recalculate all claims made under the
program. Kucinich blamed the errors on a weakening of quality control
checks prompted by a rush to shrink a backlog of unprocessed claims.
LaRock said his office started a review of the program after the House
Oversight subcommittee on domestic policy that Kucinich chairs held
hearings on the issue last July. He said they have reprocessed about 10%
of the 133,000 claims originally considered eligible for the program and
hoped to complete the review by early spring next year. [Source:

PNEUMONIA: Pneumonia is an infection of one or both lungs which is
usually caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. Prior to the discovery of
antibiotics, one-third of all people who developed pneumonia
subsequently died from the infection. Currently, over 3 million people
develop pneumonia each year in the United States. Over a half a million
of these people are admitted to a hospital for treatment. Although most
of these people recover, approximately 5% will die from pneumonia.
Pneumonia is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. Some
cases of pneumonia are contracted by breathing in small droplets that
contain the organisms that can cause pneumonia. These droplets get into
the air when a person infected with these germs coughs or sneezes. In
other cases, pneumonia is caused when bacteria or viruses that are
normally present in the mouth, throat, or nose inadvertently enter the
lung. During sleep, it is quite common for people to aspirate secretions
from the mouth, throat, or nose. Normally, the body&apos;s reflex response
(coughing back up the secretions) and immune system will prevent the
aspirated organisms from causing pneumonia. However, if a person is in a
weakened condition from another illness, a severe pneumonia can develop.
People with recent viral infections, lung disease, heart disease, and
swallowing problems, as well as alcoholics, drug users, and those who
have suffered a stroke or seizure are at higher risk for developing
pneumonia than the general population. Once organisms enter the lungs,
they usually settle in the air sacs of the lung where they rapidly grow
in number. This area of the lung then becomes filled with fluid and pus
as the body attempts to fight off the infection.
What are pneumonia symptoms and signs?

 Most people who develop pneumonia initially have symptoms of a cold
which are then followed by a high fever (sometimes as high as 104
degrees Fahrenheit), shaking chills, and a cough with sputum production.
The sputum is usually discolored and sometimes bloody. People with
pneumonia may become short of breath. The only pain fibers in the lung
are on the surface of the lung, in the area known as the pleura. Chest
pain may develop if the outer pleural aspects of the lung are involved.
This pain is usually sharp and worsens when taking a deep breath, known
as pleuritic pain. In other cases of pneumonia, there can be a slow
onset of symptoms. A worsening cough, headaches, and muscle aches may be
the only symptoms. In some people with pneumonia, coughing is not a
major symptom because the infection is located in areas of the lung away
from the larger airways. At times, the individual&apos;s skin color may
change and become dusky or purplish (a condition known as&quot;cyanosis&quot;)
due to their blood being poorly oxygenated. Children and babies who
develop pneumonia often do not have any specific signs of a chest
infection but develop a fever, appear quite ill, and can become
lethargic. Elderly people may also have few symptoms with pneumonia.

 Two vaccines are available to prevent pneumococcal disease; the
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7; Prevnar) and the pneumococcal
polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23; Pneumovax). The pneumococcal conjugate
vaccine is part of the routine infant immunization schedule in the U.S.
and is recommended for all children less than 2 years of age and
children 2-4 years of age who have certain medical conditions. The
pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is recommended for adults at
increased risk for developing pneumococcal pneumonia including the
elderly, people who have diabetes, chronic heart, lung, or kidney
disease, those with alcoholism, cigarette smokers, and in those people
who have had their spleen removed. VA will provide the PPV23 shot to
vets 65and older upon request if approved by their VA physician.
Antibiotics often used in the treatment of this type of pneumonia
include penicillin, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (Augmentin,
Augmentin XR), and macrolide antibiotics including erythromycin,
azithromycin (Zithromax, Zmax), and clarithromycin (Biaxin). Penicillin
was formerly the antibiotic of choice in treating this infection. With
the advent and widespread use of broader-spectrum antibiotics,
significant drug resistance has developed. Penicillin may still be
effective in treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia, but it should only be
used after cultures of the bacteria confirm their sensitivity to this
antibiotic. [Source: http://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia/article.htm Oct 08++]


PNEUMONIA UPDATE 01: For the first time, an influential government
panel is recommending a vaccination specifically for smokers. The panel
decided 22 OCT 08 that adult smokers under 65 should get pneumococcal
vaccine. The shot already recommended for anyone 65 or older protects
against bacteria that cause pneumonia, meningitis and other illnesses.
Federal officials usually adopt recommendations made by the panel, the
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The vote means more than
31 million adult smokers probably will soon be called on to get the
shot. Studies have shown that smokers are about four times more likely
than nonsmokers to suffer pneumococcal disease. Also, the more
cigarettes someone smokes each day, the higher the odds they&apos;ll develop
the illnesses. Why smokers are more susceptible is not known for sure,
but some scientists believe it has to do with smoking-caused damage that
allows the bacteria to more easily attach to the lungs and windpipe,
said Dr. Pekka Nuorti, a medical epidemiologist with the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. Pneumococcal infections are considered
the top killer among vaccine-preventable diseases. It&apos;s a common
complication of influenza, especially in the elderly, and is considered
responsible for many of the 36,000 annual deaths attributed to flu.

 The committee voted 11 to 3 to pass the recommendation, with one
member abstaining. The panel also added a call for smoking cessation
counseling. Some members said it might be more cost effective to
recommend the vaccine for smokers who were at least age 40, because
pneumococcal disease is relatively uncommon in younger smokers. Others
at the meeting made the same argument. Dr. James Turner, who oversees
student health programs at the University of Virginia, said about one in
five college students smoke but he has never seen a case of serious
pneumococcal disease in a student body. The shot is less than perfect.
First licensed in 1983, it is designed to protect against 23 strains of
pneumococcal bacteria. But it hasn&apos;t proved very effective against
pneumonia, and hasn&apos;t been very effective in warding off other
pneumococcal illnesses in people with weakened immune systems and people
age 80 or older. It&apos;s to be given to smokers as a one-time dose with no
booster, but its protection drops off after five to 10 years. Made by
Merck&amp;Co., it&apos;s sold under the trade name Pneumovax and costs about
$30 a dose. A different vaccine Wyeth&apos;s Prevnar, which came on the
market in 2000 is recommended for children under age 2, and for kids 2
to 5 with certain chronic conditions or who are at higher risk for
illness. That vaccine costs about $84 per dose. Prevnar protects against
seven strains of bacteria that were the most common causes of
pneumococcal diseases at the time the vaccine was developed. But lately,
those strains have stopped being important causes of illness. Experts
have become concerned about dozens of other strains, including some that
have flourished and become resistant to antibiotics. Wyeth has been
developing a new vaccine. It is expected to present study data on it at
a scientific meeting later this month, and to apply for government
licensing approval early next year. [Source: AP Mike Stobbe article 22

PATIENT PRIVACY RULES: The U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) enforces the Federal privacy regulations commonly known
as the HIPAA Privacy Rule (HIPAA). HIPAA requires most doctors, nurses,
pharmacies, hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care providers to
protect the privacy of your health information. Here is a list of common
questions about HIPAA and when health care providers may discuss or
share your health information with your family members, friends, or
others involved in your care or payment for care.

1. If I do not object, can my health care provider share or discuss my
health information with my family, friends, or others involved in my
care or payment for my care?
Yes. As long as you do not object, your health care provider is allowed
to share or discuss your health information with your family, friends,
or others involved in your care or payment for your care. Your provider
may ask your permission, may tell you he or she plans to discuss the
information and give you an opportunity to object, or may decide, using
his or her professional judgment, that you do not object. In any of
these cases, your health care provider may discuss only the information
that the person involved needs to know about your care or payment for
your care. Here are some examples:
- An emergency room doctor may discuss your treatment in front of your
friend when you ask that your friend come into the treatment room.
- Your hospital may discuss your bill with your daughter who is with you
at the hospital and has questions about the charges.
- Your doctor may talk to your sister who is driving you home from the
hospital about your keeping your foot raised during the ride home.
- Your doctor may discuss the drugs you need to take with your health
aide who has come with you to your appointment.
- Your nurse may tell you that she is going to tell your brother how you
are doing, and then she may discuss your health status with your brother
if you did not say that she should not. BUT:
- Your nurse may not discuss your condition with your brother if you
tell her not to.

2. If I am unconscious or not around, can my health care provider still
share or discuss my health information with my family, friends, or
others involved in my care or payment for my care?
Yes. If you are not around or cannot give permission, your health care
provider may share or discuss your health information with family,
friends, or others involved in your care or payment for your care if he
or she believes, in his or her professional judgment that it is in your
best interest. When someone other than a friend or family member is
asking about you, your health care provider must be reasonably sure that
you asked the person to be involved in your care or payment for your
care. Your health care provider may share your information face to face,
over the phone, or in writing, but may only share the information that
the family member, friend, or other person needs to know about your care
or payment for your care. Here are some examples:
o A surgeon who did emergency surgery on you may tell your spouse about
your condition, either in person or by phone, while you are unconscious.
o A pharmacist may give your prescription to a friend you send to pick
it up.
o A doctor may discuss your drugs with your caregiver who calls your
doctor with a question about the right dosage. BUT:
o A nurse may not tell your friend about a past medical problem that is
unrelated to your current condition.

3. Do I have to give my health care provider written permission to
share or discuss my health information with my family members, friends,
or others involved in my care or payment for my care? HIPAA does not
require that you give your health care provider written permission.
However, your provider may prefer or require that you give written
permission. You may want to ask about your provider&apos;s requirements.

4. If my family or friends call my health care provider to ask about my
condition, will they have to give my provider proof of who they are?
HIPAA does not require proof of identity in these cases. However, your
health care provider may have his or her own rules for verifying who is
on the phone. You may want to ask about your provider&apos;s rules.

5. Can I have another person pick up my prescription drugs, medical
supplies, or X-rays?
Yes. HIPAA allows health care providers (such as pharmacists) to give
prescription drugs, medical supplies, X-rays, and other health care
items to a family member, friend, or other person you send to pick them up.

6. Can my health care provider discuss my health information with an
interpreter?
Yes. HIPAA allows your health care provider to share your health
information with an interpreter who works for the provider to help
communicate with you or your family, friends, or others involved in your
care. If the interpreter is someone who does not work for your health
care provider, HIPAA also allows your provider to discuss your health
information with the interpreter so long as you do not object.

7. How can I help make sure my health care providers share my health
information with my family, friends, or others involved in my care or
payment for my care when I want them to?
Print a copy of this document and discuss it with your health care
provider at your next appointment. You may also want to share this
information with your family members, friends, or others involved in
your care or payment for your care.

8. Where can I get more information about HIPAA?
The HHS Office for Civil Rights Web site at http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/hipaa/ has a variety of resources to help you
understand HIPAA.

TFL APPOINTMENTS: With Tricare for Life (TFL) you can manage your
own health care. There are no special rules for accessing certain types
of care such as urgent, routine, specialty or preventive care. While
you&apos;ll never require referrals for any type of care, some services may
require prior authorization. A prior authorization is a review of the
requested health care service to determine if it is medically necessary
at the requested level of care. You will not require prior authorization
from Tricare unless the covered services have been exhausted under
Medicare. If needed contact your Tricare for Life contractor for more
information.
 Make your appointment with your Medicare provider. Depending on
the type of care you need, there may be slight differences in how
Tricare for Life works.

- For Medicare and Tricare-covered services, Medicare pays first and TFL
pays your remaining coinsurance for Tricare-covered services.
- For services covered by Tricare but not by Medicare, such as care
received overseas, TFL pays first and Medicare pays nothing. You must
pay the Tricare fiscal year deductible and cost shares.
- For services covered by Medicare but not by Tricare, such as
chiropractic services, Medicare pays first and TFL pays nothing. You
must pay the Medicare deductible and coinsurance.
- For services not covered by Medicare or Tricare, such as cosmetic
surgery, Medicare and Tricare pay nothing and you must pay the entire
bill.

VA HOME LOAN UPDATE 14: Veterans with conventional home loans now
have new options for refinancing to a Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA) guaranteed home loan. These new options are available as a result
of the Veterans&apos; Benefits Improvement Act of 2008, which the President
signed into law on 10 OCT 08.&quot;These changes will allow VA to assist a
substantial number of veterans with subprime mortgages refinance into a
safer, more affordable, VA guaranteed loan,&quot;said Secretary of Veterans
Affairs Dr. James B. Peake.&quot;Veterans in financial distress due to high
rate subprime mortgages are potentially the greatest beneficiaries.&quot;VA
has never guaranteed subprime loans. However, as a result of the new law
VA can now help many more veterans who currently have subprime loans.
The new law makes changes to VA&apos;s home loan refinancing program.
Veterans who wish to refinance their subprime or conventional mortgage
may now do so for up to 100% of the value of the property. These types
of loans were previously limited to 90% of the value. Additionally,
Congress raised VA&apos;s maximum loan amount for these types of refinancing
loans. Previously, these refinancing loans were capped at $144,000. With
the new legislation, such loans may be made up to $729,750 depending on
where the property is located.

 Increasing the loan-to-value ratio and raising the maximum loan
amount will allow more qualified veterans to refinance through VA,
allowing for savings on interest costs or even potentially avoiding
foreclosure. Originally set to expire at the end of this month, VA&apos;s
authority to guaranty Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs) and Hybrid ARMs
was also extended under this new law through 30 SEP 12. Unlike
conventional ARMs and hybrid ARMs, VA limits interest rate increases on
these loans from year to year, as well as over the life of the loans.
Since 1944, when home loan guaranties were offered with the original GI
Bill, VA has guaranteed more than 18 million home loans worth over $911
billion. This year, about 180,000 veterans, active duty servicemembers,
and survivors received loans valued at about $36 billion. For more
information, or to obtain help from a VA Loan Specialist, veterans may
call VA at 1-877-827-3702 or visit www.homeloans.va.gov. [Source: VA
News Release 24 Oct 08++]


DIABETES UPDATE 01: Americans with diabetes nearly doubled their
spending on drugs for the disease in just six years, with the bill last
year climbing to an eye-popping $12.5 billion. Newer, more costly drugs
are driving the increase, said researchers, despite a lack of strong
evidence for the new drugs&apos; greater benefits and safety. And there are
more people being treated for diabetes. The new study follows updated
treatment advice for Type 2 diabetes, issued last week. In those
recommendations, an expert panel told doctors to use older, cheaper
drugs first. And a second study, also out on 27 OCT 08, adds to evidence
that metformin -- an inexpensive generic used reliably for decades --
may prevent deaths from heart disease while the newer, more expensive
Avandia didn&apos;t show that benefit.&quot;We need to pay attention to this,&quot;said Dr. David Nathan, diabetes chief at Boston&apos;s Massachusetts General
Hospital, who wrote an editorial but wasn&apos;t involved in the new studies.&quot;If you can achieve the same glucose control at lower cost and lower
side effects, that&apos;s what you want to do.&quot;The studies, appearing in the 27 OCT 08 Archives of Internal
Medicine, were both funded by federal grants. In one, researchers from
University of Chicago and Stanford University looked at which pills and
insulin doctors&apos; prescribed and total medication costs. Diabetes drug
spending rose from $6.7 billion in 2001 to $12.5 billion in 2007, a
period when costs dropped for metformin. More patients got multiple
prescriptions as new classes of drugs came on the market. And more
patients with diabetes were seeing doctors, increasing from 14 million
patients in 2000 to 19 million in 2007.&quot;There&apos;s been a remarkable
change in diabetes treatments and remarkable increases in the cost of
treatments over the past several years,&quot;said study co-author Dr. Caleb
Alexander, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Chicago.&quot;We were surprised by the magnitude of the changes and the rapid
increase in the cost of diabetes care.&quot;Nearly 24 million Americans, 8%
of the population, have Type 2 diabetes, which can lead to kidney
failure, blindness and heart disease. Current guidelines say doctors
should prescribe metformin (about $30 a month) to lower blood sugar in
newly diagnosed patients and urge them to eat healthy food and get more
exercise. Other drugs can be added later, on top of metformin, to help
patients who don&apos;t meet blood sugar goals. The updated guidelines don&apos;t
include Avandia, which costs about $225 a month.

 In the other study, Johns Hopkins University researchers analyzed
findings from 40 published trials of diabetes pills that measured heart
risks. Compared to other diabetes drugs or placebo, metformin was linked
to a lower risk of death from heart problems. The findings hint that
Avandia has a possible increased risk for heart disease death, but that
increase wasn&apos;t statistically significant, meaning it could have been
the result of chance. Few of the studies lasted longer than six months.
The researchers cited a&quot;critical need&quot;for long-term studies of
diabetes pills and heart risks. Last year, the Food and Drug
Administration issued a safety alert on Avandia, made by British-based
GlaxoSmithKline PLC, after another pooled analysis of studies found a
risk of heart attacks. And in July of this year, FDA advisers said the

VA MOBIL COUNSELING CENTERS: The first of a fleet of 50 new mobile
counseling centers for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Vet
Center program was put into service 22 OCT with the remainder scheduled
to be activated over the next three months. Each vehicle will be
assigned to one of VA&apos;s existing Vet Centers, enabling the center to
improve access to counseling by bringing services closer to veterans.
The 38-foot motor coaches, which have spaces for confidential
counseling, will carry Vet Center counselors and outreach workers to
events and activities to reach veterans in broad geographic areas,
supplementing VA&apos;s 232 current Vet Centers, which are scheduled to
increase to 271 facilities by the end of 2009. Vet Centers, operated by
VA&apos;s Readjustment Counseling Service, provide non-medical readjustment
counseling in easily accessible, consumer-oriented facilities,
addressing the social and economic dimensions of post-war needs. This
includes psychological counseling for traumatic military-related
experiences and family counseling when needed for the veteran&apos;s
readjustment. The team leader at each Vet Center will develop an
outreach plan for use of the vehicle within that region, not being
limited to the traditional catchment area of a particular Vet Center.
These vehicles will be used to provide outreach and direct readjustment
counseling at active-duty, reserve and National Guard activities,
including post-deployment health reassessments for returning combat
service members. The vehicles will also be used to visit events
typically staffed by local Vet Center staff, including homeless&quot;stand
downs,&quot;veteran community events, county fairs, and unit reunions at
sites ranging from Native American reservations to colleges. While most
of their use will be in Vet Centers&apos; delivery of readjustment counseling
services, the local manager may arrange with VA hospitals or clinics in
the region to provide occasional support for health promotion activities
such as health screenings. The normal counseling layout can be converted
to support emergency medical missions, such as hurricanes and other
natural disasters. The 50 vehicles are being manufactured for VA by
Farber Specialty Vehicles of Columbus OH. Home bases of planned vet
center vehicles will be:

Alabama - Birmingham
Arizona - Chinle&amp;Prescott
Arkansas - Fayetteville
California - Corona, Fresno, Santa Cruz, and Eureka
Colorado - Colorado Springs

MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS UPDATE 01: Researchers at the University of
Cambridge in London said 23 OCT they have found that a drug originally
developed to treat leukemia can halt and even reverse the debilitating
effects of multiple sclerosis (MS). In trials, alemtuzumab reduced the
number of attacks in sufferers and also helped them recover lost
functions, apparently allowing damaged brain tissue to repair so that
individuals were less disabled than at the start of the study.&quot;The
ability of an MS drug to promote brain repair is unprecedented,&quot;said Dr
Alasdair Coles, a lecturer at Cambridge university&apos;s department of
clinical neurosciences, who coordinated many aspects of the study.&quot;We
are witnessing a drug which, if given early enough, might effectively
stop the advancement of the disease and also restore lost function by
promoting repair of the damaged brain tissue.&quot;The MS Society, Britain&apos;s
largest support charity for those affected by the condition, said it was
delighted at the trial&apos;s results, which must be followed up with more
research before the drug can be licensed.&quot;This is the first drug that
has shown the potential to halt and even reverse the debilitating
effects of MS and this news will rightly bring hope to people living
with the condition day in, day out,&quot;said head of research Lee Dunster.

 MS is an auto-immune disease that affects millions of people
worldwide, including almost 100,000 in Britain and 400,000 in the United
States. It is caused by the body&apos;s immune system attacking nerve fibres
in the central nervous system, and can lead to loss of sight and
mobility, depression, fatigue and cognitive problems. There is no cure,
and few effective treatments. In the trial, 334 patients diagnosed with
early-stage relapsing-remitting MS who had not previously been treated
were given alemtuzumab or interferon beta-1a, one of the most effective
licensed therapies for similar MS cases. After three years, alemtuzumab
was found to reduce the number of attacks the patients suffered by 74%
over the other treatment, and reduce the risk of sustained accumulation
of disability by 71% over interferon beta-1a. Many individuals who took
alemtuzumab also recovered some of their lost functions, becoming less
disabled by the end, while the disabilities of the other patients
worsened, the study in the New England Journal of Medicine said.
Alastair Compston, professor of neurology and head of the clinical
neurosciences department at Cambridge, said alemtuzumab was the&quot;most
promising&quot;experimental drug for the treatment of MS. He expressed hope
that further trials&quot;will confirm that it can both stabilise and allow
some recovery of what had previously been assumed to be irreversible
disabilities&quot;. Alemtuzumab was developed in Cambridge and has been
licensed for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. [Source:

ID CARD EXPIRATION DATE: Before Tricare For Life (TFL) was enacted in
2001, the military ID card expiration date indicated when you dropped
off the Tricare Prime or Standard rolls upon turning age 65. Card
holders age 65 and older with TFL will continue to see the expiration
date on the back of their card in the medical block, under&quot;EXP DATE&quot;.
The processes used for issuing military ID cards do not allow for an&quot;indefinite&quot;or blank input in the expiration block. At present costs
for changing the systems are prohibitive. So a date will continue to be
printed for the foreseeable future as DoD hashes out the options. DoD
Tricare Management Activity is aware of the issue and has passed the
word to all contracted health providers and military treatment
facilities. These agencies have been told to not pay as much attention
to the ID card as to their online information in the Defense Enrollment
Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS). DEERS has your most current
eligibility information. Of course, as with most large organizations
like the health service community, someone will not get the news and
occasionally deny a retiree health service based on the expired ID card
date. If this should happen to you, ask the service provider to perform
an interactive DEERS query rather than rely on the ID card information.
And have your Medicare Part A and B card ready. [Source: MOAA News

SALUTING the FLAG UPDATE 03: The 2009 NDAA clarified actions to be
taken during the playing of the National Anthem. It authorizes
individuals in uniform to give the military salute at the first note of
the anthem and maintain that position until the last note. Members of
the Armed Forces and veterans who are present but not in uniform may
render the military salute in the manner provided for individuals in
uniform; and all other persons present should face the flag and stand at
attention with their right hand over the heart, and men not in uniform,
if applicable, should remove their headdress with their right hand and
hold it at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart.

 On 29 JAN 08, President Bush signed a law amending federal code to
allow a veteran to salute the U.S. flag while not in uniform in certain,
but not all, situations. The amended federal code addresses actions for
a viewer of the U.S. flag during its hoisting, lowering or passing. In
these instances, the law allows a veteran in civilian attire to salute
the flag. All other persons present should face the flag, or if
applicable, remove their headdress with their right hand and hold it at
the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart. Citizens of other
countries present should stand at attention. All such conduct toward the
flag in a moving column should be rendered at the moment the flag
passes. However, another section of federal code that specifically
relates to actions of those reciting the Pledge of Allegiance was not
amended. In this case, a veteran in civilian attire is not specifically
authorized to render a hand salute during the Pledge. In any case, a
veteran in civilian clothes is authorized to place their right hand over
their heart as has been tradition. [Source: NCOA Leg Actions 22 Oct 08++]


VA FRAUD UPDATE 13: An Arlington County man has pleaded guilty to
swindling the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Department for more
than $60,000 over a four-year period, federal court documents said.
Willie Brian Williams pleaded guilty 17 OCT after a Veterans Affairs
investigator learned late last year that Williams had been employed
between APR 00 and OCT 04 while still collecting $61,190 in unemployment
benefits from the department, court documents said. During those four
years, Williams earned about $185,000 as an employee of Sterling,
Va.-based ABBTECH Staffing Services, court records said. While employed
by the temporary staffing firm, Williams worked as a&quot;help desk manager&quot;at Lockheed Martin Federal Systems in Springfield. According to court
records, Williams reportedly told investigators he intentionally did not
report the income to Veterans Affairs in order to keep his unemployment
benefits. In a JUN 05 handwritten letter, Williams continued the ruse,
telling Veterans Affairs officials he had&quot;not worked in a very long
time.&quot;He faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

BACK PAY INTEREST: Black World War II soldiers wrongly convicted of
murder and inciting a riot at Fort Lawton, Wash., are entitled to
receive back pay with interest after having their paychecks cut as
punishment in 1945. Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., announced that
President Bush had signed a bill 14 OCT that would award back pay plus
interest to any service member who was owed back pay due to a correction
of military records. The bill came after Jack Hamann wrote a book called&quot;On American Soil&quot;detailing the killing of an Italian prisoner of war
by a white American soldier because the Italian had been flirting with
American women on post. Italian prisoners of war were allowed to roam
freely at the time. The American soldier tried to cover up the murder --
the Italian was hung from a tree -- by starting a fight between other
Italian POWs and black American soldiers who were in a barracks adjacent
to where the prisoners were being held. In a quick trial, three black
soldiers were convicted of murder and 40 were convicted of rioting. Many
were sent to prison, and most were dishonorably discharged. Hamann&apos;s
book showed the men were innocent and that the evidence against them was
flimsy at best.&quot;Justice has prevailed, but more than that, the dignity,
courage and honor lived by Samuel Snow, Booker Townsell and other
African-American soldiers throughout a half century of racial injustice
will write a new chapter in American history that children will learn
about for generations to come,&quot;McDermott said.&quot;While no amount of money can ever repay the lost opportunities
endured by these African-American soldiers, they would be the first to
say it was never about money; it was always about equal protection under
the law for everyone in America.&quot;The new bill allows the secretary of
defense to pay interest on back pay, which had previously been illegal.
Samuel Snow of Leesburg FL was among the 28 black soldiers falsely
convicted. Snow, a teenager at the time, served almost 12 months in a
military prison and then was dishonorably discharged from the Army. Snow
died last July at age 83 only hours after receiving an honorable
discharge and an Army apology during a ceremony in Seattle. Snow always
said that he had nothing to do with the riot. Last year, the Army
overturned Snow&apos;s conviction and he was sent a check for $725. But the
amount was not adjusted for inflation. That led Nelson to take up Snow&apos;s
cause and pressure the Army to include the interest. He joined U.S. Rep.
Jim McDermott, D-Seattle, to place legislation in a military
appropriations bill that awards back pay plus interest to veterans who
have had their convictions overturned. Now that the bill has been signed
into law Snow&apos;s family has received another check for $28,305 which is
the $725 compounded over 60 years at 6% interest. [Source: ArmyTimes

VETERANS DAY: World War I - known at the time as&quot;The Great War&quot;-
officially ended when the Treaty of Versailles was signed on 28 JUN 19 ,
in the Palace of Versailles outside the town of Versailles , France.
However, fighting ceased seven months earlier when an armistice or
temporary cessation of hostilities, between the Allied nations and
Germany went into effect on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the
eleventh month. For that reason, 11 NOV 18, is generally regarded as the
end of&quot;the war to end all wars.&quot;In November 1919, President Wilson
proclaimed 11 NOV as the first commemoration of Armistice Day.

 The original concept for the celebration was for a day observed
with parades and public meetings and a brief suspension of business
beginning at 11 a.m. Congress officially recognized the end of World
War I when it passed a concurrent resolution on 4 JUN 26, with these words:
Whereas the 11th of November 1918, marked the cessation of the most
destructive, sanguinary, and far reaching war in human annals and the
resumption by the people of the United States of peaceful relations with
other nations, which we hope may never again be severed, and
Whereas it is fitting that the recurring anniversary of this date should
be commemorated with thanksgiving and prayer and exercises designed to
perpetuate peace through good will and mutual understanding between
nations; and
Whereas the legislatures of twenty-seven of our States have already
declared November 11 to be a legal holiday: Therefore be it Resolved by
the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), that the President
of the United States is requested to issue a proclamation calling upon
the officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government
buildings on November 11 and inviting the people of the United States to
observe the day in schools and churches, or other suitable places, with
appropriate ceremonies of friendly relations with all other peoples.

 An Act approved 13 MAY 38, made the 11NOV of each year a legal
holiday - - a day to be dedicated to the cause of world peace and to be
thereafter celebrated and known as&quot;Armistice Day.&quot;This was primarily a
day set aside to honor veterans of World War I, but in 1954, the 83rd
Congress, at the urging of the veterans service organizations, amended
the Act of 1938 by striking out the word&quot;Armistice&quot;and inserting in
its place the word&quot;Veterans.&quot;With the approval of this legislation
(Public Law 380) on 1 JUN 54, November 11th became a day to honor
American veterans of all wars. Later that same year, on 8 OCT President
Eisenhower issued the first&quot;Veterans Day Proclamation&quot;which stated:&quot;In order to insure proper and widespread observance of this
anniversary, all veterans, all veterans&apos; organizations, and the entire
citizenry will wish to join hands in the common purpose. Toward this
end, I am designating the Administrator of Veterans&apos; Affairs as Chairman
of a Veterans Day National Committee, which shall include such other
persons as the Chairman may select, and which will coordinate at the
national level necessary planning for the observance. I am also
requesting the heads of all departments and agencies of the Executive
branch of the Government to assist the National Committee in every way
possible.&quot;In 1958, the White House advised VA&apos;s General Counsel that the 1954
designation of the VA Administrator as Chairman of the Veterans Day
National Committee applied to all subsequent VA Administrators. Since
MAR 89 when VA was elevated to a cabinet level department, the Secretary
of Veterans Affairs has served as the committee&apos;s chairman. The
Uniforms Holiday Bill (Public Law 90-363)) was signed on 28 JUN 68, and
was intended to insure three-day weekends for Federal employees by
celebrating four national holidays on Mondays: Washington&apos;s Birthday,
Memorial Day, Veterans Day, and Columbus Day. It was thought that these
extended weekends would encourage travel, recreational and cultural
activities and stimulate greater industrial and commercial production.
Many states did not agree with this decision and continued to celebrate
the holidays on their original dates.

 The first Veterans Day under the new law was observed with much
confusion on 25 OCT 71. It was apparent that the commemoration of this
day was a matter of historic and patriotic significance to a great
number of our citizens, and so on 20 SEP 75 President Ford signed Public
Law 94-97 which returned the annual observance of Veterans Day to its
original date of 11 NOV, beginning in 1978. This action supported the
desires of the overwhelming majority of state legislatures, all major
veterans service organizations and the American people. Veterans Day
continues to be observed on 11 NOV, regardless of what day of the week
on which it falls. The restoration of the observance to 11 NOV not only
preserves the historical significance of the date, but helps focus
attention on the important purpose of Veterans Day: A celebration to
honor America&apos;s veterans for their patriotism, love of country, and
willingness to serve and sacrifice for the common good. [Source: http://www1.va.gov/opa/vetsday/ NOV 05]


CRDP UPDATE 43: Section 642 of the 2008 National Defense Authorization
Act expanded the eligibility requirements for the Concurrent Retirement
Disability Payment (CRDP), beginning on 1 OCT. Retirees who were rated
by the VA as individually unemployable (IU) and are receiving VA
disability compensation as a result of IU status, are eligible to
receive full concurrent receipt of both their VA compensation and
retired pay. This section of the 2008 NDAA is retroactive to 1 JAN 05.
The Defense Accounting and Finance Center (DFAS) will begin paying
approximately 40,000 veterans their fully restored retired pay beginning
3 NOV. The November payday reflects their October entitlement.
Eligible retirees will see their fully restored retired pay reflected on
their Retired Account Statements which will be available on myPay. The
law also provided for a retroactive payment back to January 2005, if
applicable. DFAS is beginning payment of these retroactive payments.
Cases that are less complicated, such as straight CRDP and certain
blended cases, will be paid first as these are capable of being
automatically computed. Approximately 20,000 cases fall in this
category. Retirees should begin seeing this one-time payment in
November. The more complicated cases, for example garnishments and
former spouse payments, require more in-depth adjudication. DFAS
workers will compute these cases as quickly as possible while ensuring
accurate payments, said officials. The goal is to have all retroactive
payments under this section of the law completed by MAR 09. Retirees can
log on to the DFAS Web site under&quot;Retired Pay&quot;at http://www.dfas.mil/retiredpay.html to find out more information on
Section 642 such as viewing frequently asked questions, eligibility
criteria, and the current adjudication status. [Source: NAUS weekly

NEBRASKA VET CEMETERY UPDATE 01: Ground was broken 17 OCT southeast of
Alliance for the first Nebraska Veterans Cemetery. The property,
consisting of 20 acres, was donated by the City of Alliance and was once
farmland until 1942 when it was converted to the Alliance Army Air Field
to train paratroopers for World War II. The U.S. Department of Veterans
Affairs will provide $2.9 million for the first phase of construction on
a 12-acre area. It will include more than 2,500 burial sites, roadways,
walking paths and an entry monument. When complete, the cemetery is
expected to accommodate 8,500 burial sites. The VA has committed
approximately $5 million for the project. The site will be open to
veterans, their spouses and dependent children. The legislation to
create the Nebraska State Veterans Cemetery was passed during the 2006
legislative session, 10 years after the High Plains Cemetery Task Force
formed to spearhead the project. The project will involve two phases.
Phase 1A will consist of 2,549 burial sites, roadways, entry monument,
memorial walk, fencing and landscaping. Phase 1B will include an
administrative and maintenance building, committal shelter with plaza,
an avenue of flags and scattering garden. [Source: Star-Herald Reporter

GULF WAR SYNDROME UPDATE 04: A new study concludes that informal
communication among British veterans of the first Iraq war may have
shaped the vets&apos; characterization of Gulf War Syndrome. After the
bullets stopped flying, the rumors took off among British veterans of
the 1991 Gulf War. Early accounts of physical and emotional reactions to
wartime experiences spread from one person to another through networks
of veterans. Within a few years, these former soldiers had decided among
themselves that many of them suffered from the controversial illness
known as Gulf War Syndrome, Simon Wessely of King&apos;s College London and
his colleagues analyzed extensive written accounts provided in 1996,
five years after the Gulf War, by 1,100 British Gulf War vets
participating in a larger survey of veterans&apos; health. Vets described
their wartime experiences and related what had happened in the conflict
to their later health and illness. The research team doesn&apos;t regard
rumor as necessarily untrue or misleading. Rumor proved to be critical
among the British Gulf War vets because it counteracted a lack of
communication from military and government authorities regarding
possible wartime health risks, Wessely says. Scared and confused vets
turned to their own social grapevine for answers, Wessely&apos;s group
reports in an upcoming Social Science&amp;Medicine. Out of their shared
stories and explanations grew a collective conviction that Gulf War
Syndrome existed as a unitary illness with elusive causes.&quot;The nature of Gulf War Syndrome in the years after the conflict
was keenly shaped by these early rumors, which entangled specific ideas
about the illness with feelings of betrayal, distrust and ambiguity,&quot;said Wessely. Symptoms attributed to Gulf War Syndrome include joint and
muscle pain, bouts of depression or violent behavior and cancers of
various types. Some researchers regard the condition as a psychological
disorder related to the stress of combat. Others, as well as many vets,
contend that it&apos;s a physical disorder caused by exposure to toxic
substances shortly before or during the war. By 2001, an estimated 15%
to 20% of those who served in the Gulf War believed that they suffered
from Gulf War Syndrome. Current medical consensus holds that Gulf War
veterans indeed display unusually high rates of various health problems,
but that these conditions don&apos;t constitute a discrete illness or
syndrome, Wessely says. Research on this issue remains contentious. In a
commentary slated to be published with the new study, Thomas Shriver of
Oklahoma State University in Stillwater and Sherry Cable of the
University of Tennessee in Knoxville say that Wessely&apos;s team appears to
regard veterans&apos; symptoms as purely psychological and perhaps partly
invented out of rumor.&quot;The authors come perilously close to blaming the
victims,&quot;the two sociologists contend. U.S. Gulf War vets used rumors
early after their return to define collective grievances and develop a
plan to press authorities for medical treatment and compensation,
Shriver and Cable say. But, Wessely responds,&quot;Far from blaming vets, we
are shifting the spotlight to the role of governments in allowing an
information vacuum to develop regarding potential health risks, which
allowed rumors to spread and gain currency after the war.&quot;Military authorities in the United States and England have learned
a hard lesson from that experience, he says. Consider that the anthrax
vaccine was administered to U.S. and British soldiers entering the Gulf
War, but that the vaccine was given under a code name. Rumors about the
vaccine spread quickly, including one that soldiers were being injected
with an experimental AIDS vaccine. Before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, U.S
and British soldiers were told upfront that they were receiving the
anthrax vaccine. The new study confirms that rumors about health risks,
especially from vaccinations and pills, spread rapidly among troops just
before, during and after the war. About 90% of the survey participants
listed one or more personal problems, including anger, depression,
forgetfulness, lumps, rashes, seizures, post-traumatic stress disorder,
brain lesions, incontinence and self-enforced isolation. More than
one-third of vets worried about unknown pollutants that had somehow
entered their bodies. Concern focused on exposure to depleted uranium
used during the war by U.S. and British forces, tablets and vaccinations
provided to protect against Iraqi biological and chemical warfare and
smoke from oil fires set by Iraqi forces as they retreated from Kuwait.
About two-thirds of vets said that they did not, at the time of the
survey, suffer from any full-blown illness but still felt susceptible to
developing Gulf War Syndrome. Most participants also cited a lack of
confidence in their leaders, from commanders of military units to
government officials. Frustration over military secrecy and over not
knowing whom to trust was common. After the war, rumors reaffirmed the
social bond among returning vets and helped them to shape a bewildering
array of physical and psychological symptoms into the common burden of
Gulf War Syndrome, the scientists propose. [Source: Science News Bruce

VA CREDIBILITY: The chairman of the House Veterans&apos; Affairs Committee
says he completely understands why many veterans have lost confidence in
the Department of Veterans Affairs.&quot;I am sure there are good people
working there who are trying very hard and have the best of intentions,
but they are bunglers,&quot;said Rep. Bob Filner (D-CA).&quot;You lose
confidence in these people by watching them.&quot;Filner, a frequent critic
of VA, cited two examples: the department&apos;s abandoned plans to use a
private contractor to help launch the new GI Bill benefits program next
year, and VA&apos;s order 16 OCT to its 57 regional offices to stop shredding
documents after veterans&apos; claims materials were found in piles of paper
waiting to be destroyed.&quot;This is an insult to veterans,&quot;Filner said.
Last week&apos;s announcement that VA would implement the Post-9/11 GI Bill
by next August using in-house resources came after department officials
spent weeks telling lawmakers they could meet that deadline only with
outside help, Filner said.&quot;After arguing for months and months that
they could only do this with a contractor, you have to be concerned
about whether VA can do it,&quot;he said.&quot;This is so important, and people
are betting on it. VA better get this done.&quot;The 16 OCT announcement
that VA had ordered a system wide freeze on destroying documents came
after auditors discovered claims and potentially irreplaceable paperwork
tagged for shredding at four regional offices. Shredding is suspended
until new paper management procedures are in place. Filner said veterans
have long complained about claims getting lost in VA bureaucracy.&quot;You
are supposed to have a sense they may be slow, but at least they will
eventually do the right thing,&quot;he said. Now, he said, the possibility
that records vital to approving a claim might be destroyed fuels
complaints that VA is trying to prevent claims from being awarded at
all. [Source: AirForceTimes Rick Maze article 20 Oct 08++]


TRICARE/MEDICARE COMBINED BENEFIT: Officials want to ensure that
Tricare beneficiaries who receive a Social Security disability check
receive the Tricare coverage to which they are entitled. In general,
most beneficiaries become eligible for Medicare at age 65. However,
many beneficiaries under age 65 also qualify for Medicare and there is
one critical fact they need to know.&quot;Most Tricare beneficiaries who are
eligible for premium-free Medicare Part A are required under federal law
to enroll in Medicare Part B to keep Tricare benefits. Medicare Part A
covers inpatient care in hospitals and skilled nursing facilities. It
also covers hospice and some home health care. Medicare Part B is
medical insurance. It helps cover outpatient and physician services as
well as some physical and occupational therapies and home health care.
The Medicare Part B monthly premium is currently $96.40 and will remain
the same for 2009. Individual premiums could be higher, based on income.

 When Medicare coverage is effective, it becomes the primary
insurance, while Tricare becomes the secondary. Beneficiaries who take
appropriate steps to maintain their Tricare eligibility will often have
no out-of-pocket expenses for health care services covered by Medicare
and Tricare. Generally, beneficiaries who receive social security
disability benefits begin receiving Medicare benefits after two years
and they may choose between options such as Tricare Prime or Tricare for
Life. Most will need to have Medicare Part B, although there are some
exceptions. Whatever they choose, it cannot be emphasized enough that
beneficiaries need to look carefully at their options before making
decisions that could result in a loss of Tricare coverage. Factors
beneficiaries must take into consideration before making a decision when
it comes to Medicare and Tricare include:
- Whether their spouse is on active duty;
- If they are disabled due to injuries while serving on active duty;
- If they have other health insurance; or
- If they are enrolled in the uniformed services family health plan or
Tricare Reserve Select.

Other factors may also apply, but help is available to understand the
complexities of this benefit. Detailed information on how Medicare and
TRICARE work together for eligible beneficiaries under 65 is available
through the TRICARE Web site at http://www.tricare.mil/medicare , where

VA CLAIM SHREDDING: Veterans Affairs officials have ordered a halt to
all document shredding after a routine check found unprocessed benefits
applications tossed into disposal piles at four regional offices. In a
conference call with veterans groups 16 OCT, VA officials said the
department&apos;s inspector general found five unprocessed documents waiting
to be shredded in the Detroit regional office. Three more were found in
the St. Louis office, two more in Waco, Texas. Officials said more were
found in a Florida regional office but could not specify how many.
Leaders at the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the U.S. called the
revelation a&quot;disgraceful management failure&quot;and called for better
enforcement of the department&apos;s own paperwork safeguards. VFW national
commander Glen Gardner said in a statement,&quot;With almost 850,000 VA
claims in the backlog, the question that begs to be asked and answered
is how many veterans had their disability and compensation claims
disappear down a paper shredder.&quot;The department has 56 regional offices
handling benefits claims for disability pay, pensions, tuition
assistance, home loans and other financial issues. The VA would not
specify what types of documents were found in the shred piles.

 In a statement Secretary of Veterans Affairs James Peake
acknowledged the misplaced paperwork could have affected some veterans&apos;
eligibility for the financial aid.&quot;It is unacceptable that documents
important to a veteran&apos;s claim for benefits should be misplaced or
destroyed,&quot;he said. VA undersecretary for benefits Patrick Dunne
ordered the regional offices to suspend all document shredding as of 16
OCT until a broader investigation into the problem is completed. While
the inspector general investigation continued, the VA&apos;s separate inquiry
found nearly 500 documents improperly placed in shredder bins in about
two-thirds of the agency&apos;s 57 benefits offices. Peake promised any
employees found improperly disposing of documents would be held
accountable and said regional directors will now have to certify that no
original copies of key documents are being destroyed in their offices.
Under department rules, original copies of military discharge orders,
marriage and death certificates, and other essential paperwork are
returned to veterans or families after benefits processors can verify
them. Duplicate copies of those papers are destroyed after the claims
are processed to protect veterans&apos; privacy.

 A House committee overseeing the Department of Veterans Affairs
will hold hearings next month to question VA leaders about documents
improperly marked for shredding at agency offices around the nation.
Rep. Bob Filner, (D-CA) chairman of the House Committee on Veterans
Affairs, said he was outraged by revelations that papers crucial to
deciding veteran disability and pension claims were being destroyed by
VA workers.&quot;These guys remind me of the Keystone Kops,&quot;Filner said.&quot;This completely shatters confidence in the whole VA system. These
documents are matters of life and death for some of these veterans.&quot;Rep. C.W. Bill Young, (R-FL) is not on the committee but supports having
hearings and suggested the problem might be widespread. Some VA
employees could face legal problems, he said. Filner said he will hold
the hearings the week of Nov. 17, when a lame-duck session of Congress
is expected to convene to consider an economic stimulus package. Among
those he will call to testify are VA Secretary James Peake and
investigators for the agency&apos;s independent watchdog, the inspector
general. Rick Weidman, director of government relations for the Vietnam
Veterans of America, said his group has complained to the VA for years
about mishandling of documents at the regional offices.&quot;I wish we could
say we&apos;re surprised by this, but the only real surprise is that they
admitted it,&quot;he said.&quot;We told (Dunne&apos;s) predecessors about this, but
nothing has really happened.&quot;We can keep holding hearings and filing
lawsuits, but I don&apos;t know what it&apos;s going to take to get them to obey
the law.&quot;[Source: Stars and Stripes Leo Shane article 10 Oct 08++]


FILIPINO VET INEQUITIES UPDATE 11: U.S. Senator Daniel K. Akaka
(D-HI), Chairman of the Veterans&apos; Affairs Committee, responded 20 OCT to
comments made by the Committee&apos;s Ranking Minority Member, Senator
Richard Burr (R-NC) regarding provisions in S. 1315 that would provide
equity to Filipino veterans who served under U.S. command during WWII.
The American Coalition for Filipino Veterans (ACFV) posted a video of
Senator Burr&apos;s comments on YouTube www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNNWTtvQi2Q
in which Burr expresses his willingness to negotiate a limited pension
for Filipino World War II veterans. According to ACFV, Burr&apos;s comments
came in response to a question from 91-year-old WWII veteran Celestina
Almeda, who travelled to attend the public event at Davidson College in
North Carolina on October 9. Akaka responded directly to Burr by letter,
stating:&quot;I am eager to work with you and hear what level of pension and
compensation you would be willing to support. The veterans waiting for
passage of the equity provisions in S. 1315 are not someone else&apos;s
veterans - they are our veterans. I am willing to negotiate the extent
of those benefits with you if you are prepared to recognize them as U.S.
veterans.&quot;Akaka encouraged immediate discussions in hopes of reaching
an agreement before the Senate reconvenes as expected following the
November elections. S. 1315 is the Veterans&apos; Benefits Enhancement Act of
2007, an omnibus veterans&apos; benefits bill that includes provisions
providing recognition and benefits for Filipino veterans of World War II
who served under U.S. military command. S. 1315 passed the Senate by a
vote of 96-1, and an amended version later passed the House. Chairman
Akaka&apos;s motion for a conference between the House and Senate on a final
version of the bill was then objected to by Senator Burr. [Source: Sen.

COLA 2009 UPDATE 05: The 2009 cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for
military retired pay will be the highest seen in over 15 years at 5.8%.
 The increase, which goes into effect on 1 DEC 08, also applies to SBP
annuities, Social Security checks, and VA disability and survivor
benefits. Retirees will see the increase in their JAN 09 checks. The
annual Cost-of-Living-Adjustment is not in any way related to the annual
military pay raise for active duty and reserve servicemembers which this
year was 3.9%. All retirees who retired before 1 JAN 08 will receive the
5.8% Cost-of-Living-Adjustment. Retirees who first became members of the
uniformed services on or after 1 AUG 86 and elected to receive a Career
Status Bonus at 15 years, and retired on or before 1 JASN 08, will
receive an increase of only 4.8%. Retirees who first became a member of
the uniformed services on or after Sept. 8, 1980, and retired in 2008
will receive a Partial COLA on a prorated basis as follows:
o Jan. 1, 2008, and March 31, 2008, will receive 5.0%
o April 1 - June 30, 2008 will receive 3.8%
o July 1 - Sept. 30, 2008 will receive 1.2%
o Those who retired after Oct. 1, 2008, will see no COLA this year.

This is the third year in the last four that the retiree COLA has been
higher than the pay raise for currently serving troops. The two are
never the same because they are based on different things and have
different purposes. Military pay raises are based on private sector pay
growth, as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics&apos; Employment Cost
Index (ECI). Their intent is to ensure military pay is kept reasonably
comparable to private sector pay, to allow the services to compete
successfully for manpower over time. Retired pay COLAs, on the other
hand, are cost-of-living adjustments that track to inflation, as
measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Their purpose is to ensure
that whatever purchasing power a member&apos;s retired pay represented on the
date he or she left service isn&apos;t eroded by inflation over time. Over
time, the two tend to even out. During the 1970s, COLAs were higher in 5
years and pay raises won out for the other five. In the &apos;80s, pay raises
beat COLAs (6 - 4); in the &apos;90s, it was 50-50 split (5 - 5). The first
half of this decade, pay raises were higher, but with COLAs higher for
three of the last 4 years, the pendulum seems to be swinging the other
way again. [Source: MOAA Leg Up 17 Oct&amp;Military Report 20 Oct 08++]


SSA COLA 2009 UPDATE 01: Social Security Announces 5.8 Percent Benefit
Increase for 2009 Monthly Social Security and Supplemental Security
Income benefits for more than 55 million Americans will increase 5.8% in
2009, the Social Security Administration announced. The 5.8 percent
increase is the largest since 1982. Social Security and Supplemental
Security Income benefits increase automatically each year based on the
rise in the Bureau of Labor Statistics&apos; Consumer Price Index for Urban
Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), from the third quarter of the
prior year to the corresponding period of the current year. This year&apos;s
increase in the CPI-W was 5.8%. The Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA)
will begin with benefits that over 50 million Social Security
beneficiaries receive in JAN 09. Increased payments to more than 7
million Supplemental Security Income beneficiaries will begin on 31 DEC.
Some other changes that take effect in January of each year are based on
the increase in average wages. Based on that increase, the maximum
amount of earnings subject to the Social Security tax (taxable maximum)
will increase to $106,800 from $102,000. Of the estimated 164 million
workers who will pay Social Security taxes in 2009, about 11 million
will pay higher taxes as a result of the increase in the taxable
maximum. Information about Medicare changes for 2009 can be found at
www.medicare.gov. [Source: SSDA Press Release 16 Oct 08++]


VA PRESUMPTIVE GULF WAR VET DISEASES UPDATE 01: The Department of
Veterans Affairs presumes that specific disabilities diagnosed in
certain veterans were caused by their military service. If one of these
conditions is diagnosed in Vietnam Vet, VA presumes that the
circumstances of his/her service (i.e. exposure to Agent Orange) caused
the condition, and disability compensation can be awarded. This includes
DIC education and CHAMPVA for spouses of veterans rated 100% or
surviving spouses late-veterans that died from discussed medical
problems. The following disabilities may be presumed for those who
served in the Southwest Asia Theater of Operations during the Gulf War
with condition at least 10% disabling by 12/31/11. Included are
medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illnesses defined by a
cluster of signs or symptoms that have existed for six months or more,
such as:
o chronic fatigue syndrome
o fibromyalgia
o irritable bowel syndrome
o amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
o any diagnosed or undiagnosed illness that the Secretary of Veterans
Affairs determines warrants a presumption of service connection

Signs or symptoms of an undiagnosed illness include: fatigue, skin
symptoms, headaches, muscle pain, joint pain, neurological symptoms,
respiratory symptoms, sleep disturbance, GI symptoms, cardiovascular
symptoms, weight loss, and menstrual disorders. [Source: County of

HAVE YOU HEARD: On some bases the Air Force is on one side of the field
and civilian aircraft use the other side of the field, with the control
tower in the middle. One day the tower received a call from an aircraft
asking, &apos;What time is it?&apos;

The tower responded, &apos;Who is calling?&apos;
The aircraft replied, &apos;What difference does it make?&apos;
The tower replied, &apos;It makes a lot of difference........
If it is an American Airlines flight, it is 3 o&apos;clock.
If it is an Air Force plane, it is 1500 hours.
If it is a Navy aircraft, it is 6 bells.
If it is an Army aircraft, the big hand is on the 12 and the little hand
is on the 3.
If it is a Marine Corps aircraft, it&apos;s Thursday afternoon and 120

VETERAN LEGISLATION STATUS 29 OCT 08: Refer to the Bulletin&apos;s House&amp;Senate attachments for or a listing of Congressional bills of interest
to the veteran community that have been introduced in the 110th
Congress. Support of these bills through cosponsorship by other
legislators is critical if they are ever going to move through the
legislative process for a floor vote to become law. A good indication
on that likelihood is the number of cosponsors who have signed onto the
bill. A cosponsor is a member of Congress who has joined one or more
other members in his/her chamber (i.e. House or Senate) to sponsor a
bill or amendment. The member who introduces the bill is considered the
sponsor. Members subsequently signing on are called cosponsors. Any
number of members may cosponsor a bill in the House or Senate. At http://thomas.loc.gov you can also review a copy of each bill&apos;s content,
determine its current status, the committee it has been assigned to, and
if your legislator is a sponsor or cosponsor of it. To determine what
bills, amendments your representative has sponsored, cosponsored, or
dropped sponsorship on refer to http://thomas.loc.gov/bss/d110/sponlst.html. The key to increasing
cosponsorship on veteran related bills and subsequent passage into law
is letting our representatives know of veteran&apos;s feelings on issues. At
the end of some listed bills is a web link that can be used to do that.
You can also reach his/her Washington via the Capital Operator direct at
(866) 272-6622, (800) 828-0498, or (866) 340-9281 to express your
views. Otherwise, you can locate on http://thomas.loc.gov who your
representative is and his/her phone number, mailing address, or
email/website to communicate with a message or letter of your own
making. Refer to http://www.thecapitol.net/FAQ/cong_schedule.html for
future times that you can access your representatives on their home
turf. [Source: RAO Bulletin Attachment 13 Oct 08++]

NNS081031-09. Women&apos;s Symposium Encourages Networking, Mentoring

By Mass Communications Specialist 2nd Class Erin Kerby, The Waterline

ARLINGTON, Va. (NNS) -- Seeking to strengthen networking and mentorship
opportunities, more than 200 female cadets, midshipmen and active-duty
and retired officers met at the Academy Women&apos;s 5th annual leadership
symposium, Oct. 17-19 at the Women in Military Service for America Memorial.

Susan Feland, founder and president, established the AcademyWomen
organization more than five years ago to provide a means for women to
discuss issues relevant to female service members.&quot;The idea is to get people to talk about things that they have done or
things that they have seen,&quot;Feland said.&quot;There are obviously a
significant number of women in the military, but the frustrating part
for me was that none of us were talking, and we all seemed to have to
reinvent the wheel every time there was an issue.&quot;The theme of this year&apos;s symposium was&quot;Stories of our Sisters.&quot;Retired Rear Adm. Marsha&quot;Marty&quot;Evans, who delivered the keynote
address, became a high-level leader in the nonprofit world serving as
both the chief executive officer of the Girl Scouts and the American Red
Cross after her successful Navy career.

During her address,&quot;Leadership without Easy Answers,&quot;Evans spoke of
the importance of gathering together in groups and sharing stories.
Evans told the women to tend to their relationships and nurture their
network of support.

With the goal of professionally and personally strengthening the women
of the military, mentorship is one of the key focuses of not only the
AcademyWomen&apos;s mission but the Navy&apos;s mission as well.&quot;Mentoring is paramount in the Navy and greatly affects our ability to
accomplish the mission,&quot;said Rear Adm. Wendi Carpenter, commander of
the Navy Warfare Development Command.&quot;It is how we develop our future
leaders, allowing and encouraging each individual to develop to his or
her maximum potential. It enables the whole force and future leaders to
maximize their readiness and impact.&quot;Carpenter was a guest speaker at the symposium on the&quot;Superwoman
Complex&quot;panel, along with Rear Adm. Ann DeBaets Gilbride, associate
director of Naval Intelligence. The panel discussed the many roles women
assume, especially in the military, and ways to ease anxiety.

Both Carpenter and Gilbride are supporters of the mission of the
AcademyWomen.&quot;Outside of the normal workplace, it offers another source of
networking, mentoring and general information to provide growth
opportunities,&quot;said Carpenter.

The AcademyWomen organization has assisted the Navy&apos;s Office of Women&apos;s
Policy in the development of the NavyWomen eMentor Leadership Program, a
subset of its own program.&quot;It is a brand new program,&quot;said Stefanie Goebel, director of the
AcademyWomen eMentor Leadership Program.&quot;We are building the eMentor
Leadership program, and it will have different groups, one of those
groups being the Navy women.&quot;Participating women are matched through a state-of-the-art mentoring
website.&quot;Online mentoring allows mentor pairs to create a relationship that is
very flexible in duration, intensity and purpose,&quot;said Lt. Hope Brill
who works for the Navy&apos;s Office of Women&apos;s Policy.&quot;The benefits to mentors and mentees will contribute to increased
professional and personal satisfaction of our Navy service members,&quot;said Brill,&quot;which is an important aspect of developing our future leaders.

With the growth of the AcademyWomen organization and its eMentoring
programs, as well as a number of other professional development and
mentoring groups with direct ties to the Navy, the women of the Navy
today, yesterday and tomorrow have the tools available to have a
successful career and network with those who have already achieved success.&quot;Every single person should value the opportunity to be a mentor,&quot;said
Carpenter.&quot;It is a part of your own development as a leader. Get a
mentor; be a mentor, and devote all the energy necessary in both of
those roles.&quot;AcademyWomen is a nonprofit organization devoted to the professional and
personal cultivation of military women officers, officer candidates and
veterans.

NNS081031-11. USS San Antonio Stays Connected to Namesake City, Heritage

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class (SW) Brian Goodwin, Iwo Jima
Expeditionary Strike Group Public Affairs

USS SAN ANTONIO, At Sea (NNS) -- The amphibious transport dock ship USS
San Antonio (LPD 17) shares more than just the name of Texas city
throughout the ship, there are constant reminders and mannerisms that
allude to the rich history of the city of San Antonio.

San Antonio&apos;s historical roots are the foundation for the city that is
rapidly moving forward into the 21st century, much like the
technologically advanced LPD, which builds on accomplishments of prior
LPDs and steams towards the future.&quot;USS San Antonio is the most high-tech, advanced amphibious ship ever
built,&quot;said former Secretary of the Navy John H. Dalton at the ship&apos;s
announcement ceremony in 1996.&quot;It is an honor to name such an important
new combat ship after San Antonio, the site of the battle of the Alamo.&quot;&quot;The battle of the Alamo inspires persistence, determination, and
ultimate victory,&quot;stated Cmdr. Kurt Kastner, San Antonio&apos;s commanding
officer.&quot;LPD 17 carries these qualities within her wherever she sails.&quot;San Antonio&apos;s motto,&quot;Never Retreat, Never Surrender&quot;comes from the
speech made by Lt. Col. William Barret Travis in 1836 at the battle of
the Alamo.&quot;I am besieged by a thousand or more of the Mexicans under [General]
Santa Anna,&quot;said Travis.&quot;I have sustained a continual bombardment and
cannonade for 24 hours and have not lost a man. I shall never surrender
or retreat!&quot;San Antonio&apos;s mess deck&quot;King Ranch Café&quot;borrows its name from the
cattle grounds in San Antonio, Texas, where cattle were herded and
raised for food.&quot;The names on the backs of the chairs in the mess decks are the names of
the people who fought in the battle of the Alamo,&quot;stated Kastner.

The San Antonio-area Navy League extended an open invitation to USS San
Antonio to attend two annual festivals in the city, the Battle of the
Alamo Remembrance and navy week.&quot;During the month of April, the city remembers the Battle of the Alamo
and the fight the citizens of the city put up to defend the border
between the newly forming United States and Mexico,&quot;said Lt. j.g.
Kathleen Friel, the ship&apos;s navigator.&quot;Later in the year during the
month of November, San Antonio celebrates navy week.

The festivals give Sailors the opportunity to attend dinner receptions,
parades and the Alamo remembrances.&quot;The city of San Antonio also boasts several military installations.&quot;The city of San Antonio has a rich history of military members in all
branches and is affectionately called &apos;military city USA&apos; because of the
five military bases located within its limits,&quot;added Kastner.

To further their relationship with the city, USS San Antonio has
recently started an adopt-a-school partnership with a local elementary
school.&quot;USS San Antonio was looking for a partnership program with a school in
San Antonio, Texas, and Dorie Miller Elementary School was selected,&quot;said Kastner.

Continued ties to the city of San Antonio will assure that future
Sailors and Marines who serve aboard LPD 17 remember and honor the
ship&apos;s proud heritage.

San Antonio is deployed to the U.S. 5th Fleet area of operations to
conduct maritime security operations (MSO). MSO helps develop security
in the maritime environment. From security arises stability that results
in global economic prosperity. MSO complements the counterterrorism and
security efforts of regional nations and seek to disrupt violent
extremists&apos; use of the maritime environment as a venue for attack or to
transport personnel, weapons or other material.

NNS081031-02. Nitze Wins Energy Conservation Award

By Ensign Chris Flores, USS Nitze Public Affairs

USS NITZE (NNS) -- Improvements in the efficient operation of the ship
earned the USS Nitze (DDG 94) the prestigious Secretary of the Navy
Energy Conservation Award for 2008 in the Small Afloat category.

Utilizing technological advances and incorporating proactive energy
conservation policies, Nitze saved 20,500 barrels of fuel in 2007,
saving the Navy nearly $2 million that fiscal year.&quot;Increasing fuel costs around the world have made fuel savings more
important to the Navy than it has been before,&quot;said Cmdr. Kenneth S.
Long, Nitze&apos;s commanding officer.&quot;The money saved from fuel savings
allows for greater efficiency in supporting additional naval operations.&quot;Nitze often operates in&quot;fuel efficient mode,&quot;which saves an average of
10 percent on fuel, but Nitze&apos;s leadership has extended energy
conservation beyond fuel efficient mode. When planning the ship&apos;s daily
and long-range operations, every effort is made to maximize the use of
trail shaft to minimize fuel consumption.

When in ports with shore power, the ship goes to single generator
operations and receives hotel services conserving ship&apos;s energy. In
port, the ship goes to an economical plant alignment by maintaining air
conditioning boundaries, conducting single reefer operations and
operating a single fire pump, which reduces power demand up to 400 amps.

Key Nitze crew members have received energy conservation training,
including the main propulsion assistant, engineer officers of the watch
(EOOW) and the chief engineer. After attending energy conservation
(ENCON) seminars, they have incorporated several best practices into the
ship&apos;s program.

For example, Nitze has identified opportunities for split plant
operations in traditional&quot;full plant&quot;situations. Now, all officers of
the deck and EOOWs have been trained to use the most efficient line-up
whenever possible.

The ship also implements fuel conservation awareness by conducting
monthly training. Fuel curves are posted in the central control station
and bridge to measure, analyze and predict performance. All hands are
reminded to maintain A/C boundaries, turn off lights in unmanned spaces,
and turn off electrical or electronics equipment not in use.

The engineer&apos;s night orders contain energy conservation articles to
highlight the criteria to conserve energy.

Through Nitze&apos;s advancements in crew training, technology and
incorporation of energy conservation best practices, maximum efficiency
is being achieved at multiple levels while minimizing fuel consumption.
Nitze is now authorized to fly the Secretary of the Navy&apos;s Energy
Conservation Flag while in port.

The ship is part of the Theodore Roosevelt Strike Group.

NNS081031-16. Seabees Aid in Rescue of U.S. Ambassador

By Steelworker 3rd Class Siamac Moghaddam, Det. Sao Tome Public Affairs

SAO TOME, Africa Partnership Station (NNS) -- In one of the worst
downpours in recent Sao Tomean history, Seabees from Naval Mobile
Construction Battalion (NMCB) 4 answered the State Department&apos;s call for
help Oct. 25, rescuing several personnel including the U.S. ambassador
to Gabon and Sao Tome.

That day, the tiny island nation of Sao Tome and Principe was suddenly
hit by a major tropical storm. The storm closed Route Nacional 1, the
sole road connecting the capital city of Sao Tome with the southern half
of the country, due to a heavy mudslide.

At the time, Ambassador Eunice Reddick, her staff, and the mayor of the
city of Angolares were returning from a lunch reception on the southern
end of the island of Sao Tome. On the way back to their hotel, the
ambassador&apos;s party encountered a mudslide that completely covered the
road, closing the only passage north and stranding the personnel for
more than five hours. As the rain continued to come down, they realized
conditions were worsening and were trapped by 30 meters of waist-high
mud, limiting their movement.&quot;The heavily mountainous terrain at that location, and the continuing
rain, gave indications a further mudslide was imminent,&quot;Reddick stated
in an e-mail.

After evaluating the situation, the defense attaché contacted the Seabee
team. After explaining the situation, Steelworker 1st Class (SCW) Eugene
Burston, Construction Mechanic 2nd Class (SCW/FMF) Wade Pendley,
Equipment Operator 2nd Class (SCW) Kenneth Hoffman and Constructionman
Donald Guffey volunteered to help.

The Seabees loaded up in two half-ton pick-ups and traveled
approximately 30 kilometers at night down a winding mountain jungle road
in the middle of a tropical storm with limited visibility.&quot;When we got the request, it wasn&apos;t even a question. We just packed up
and headed south,&quot;Burston said. Just north of the U.S. embassy
entourage&apos;s position, the Seabees discovered a mudslide 50 yards wide
and 9 feet high covered with waist-high mud and downed trees.

After assessing the situation, the Seabees ran a chain from their truck
and walked across the mud field with only the aide of flashlights to
provide a chain hold for people to cross.&quot;The Seabees personally came to our aid and escorted, and carried, us
across the mud field. Approximately 50 civilians were able to cross to
safety,&quot;wrote Reddick in an e-mail.&quot;The Seabees traversed the mud fields several times through the tropical
storm that evening to ensure the safety of all persons on either side of
the mud slide. All the while, they disregarded their personal safety to
ensure the safety of myself and my entourage in spite of a worsening
storm and the real threat of another mudslide.&quot;&quot;The Seabees risked their lives to save the ambassador, her team and Sao
Tomeans stranded behind the mudslide,&quot;Air Force Lt. Col. Rene Dechaine,
the Embassy&apos;s defense attaché said.&quot;We were all waiting for another
mudslide to come. Everyone was extremely lucky that they showed up.
Because of them nobody died or was injured.&quot;When it comes to disaster relief, Seabees consider themselves
second-to-none. From Hurricane Katrina to the Pakistani earthquake,
Seabees have been at the front lines providing humanitarian assistance
and support to those in need. NMCB 4 is deployed to Sao Tome and
Principe in support of African Partnership Station.

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SW) Elizabeth Vlahos,
Defense Media Activity - Anacostia

WASHINGTON (NNS) -- Representatives, one from each of the U.S. Armed
Forces and one from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, were honored
at the Spirit of Hope Awards Ceremony at the Pentagon Auditorium Oct. 28.&quot;In presenting these awards, we are in essence saying &apos;thank you&apos; to Bob
Hope for leading the way,&quot;said Mr. Harvey Barnum, Deputy Assistant
Secretary of the Navy for Reserve Affairs and Medal of Honor recipient,
in his opening remarks on the legacy of the award.&quot;Bob Hope set the bar
high when it comes to those honored values of duty, honor, courage,
loyalty, integrity and selfless dedication.&quot;The Spirit of Hope award, established in 1997 by the Bob Hope Family
Foundation, recognizes one individual or organization from each branch
of the armed forces and the Office of the Secretary of Defense who not
only captures the values and integrity of the service but who also
exemplifies the patriotism and dedication to the armed forces
characteristic of the late comedian.

Chief Aviation Support Equipment Technician Giovanni Balingit, from
Fleet Readiness Center Southwest, was the Navy&apos;s nominee.&quot;It&apos;s a really great honor for me to receive this award and represent
the Navy and [my command],&quot;said Balingit.&quot;I would like to thank the
Sailors and families of Fleet Readiness Center who have helped me out
during our weekly community service and making a difference in the
community.&quot;Balingit&apos;s list of accomplishments includes his management of many
quality-of-life programs, to include voting assistance, U.S.
naturalization, volunteer income tax assistance and personal finance
management.

In 2007, Balingit revamped the command DAPA program with a highly
effective anti-drug use and deglamorization campaign, effecting a record
67 percent incident reduction rate. In addition to coordinating a
plethora of volunteer efforts and community service projects, he
counseled many Sailors in matters of career advancement, attaining
citizenship and policy compliance.

The awardees from the other branches were Michael Peterson, for the
Army; Cynthia Martinez, for the Marine Corps; the crew of USCGC Alert,
for the Coast Guard; the late Nicholas G. Grand, for the Air Force,
accepted by his son, George; and Walter K. White, for the Office of the
Secretary of Defense.

Attendees believed the event was a fitting celebration of Hopes&apos; legacy
and the spirit of the award.&quot;I feel so blessed to be able to be here today to celebrate these men
and women in uniform,&quot;said Miranda Hope, granddaughter of the legendary
comedian.&quot;I know that if my grandfather were here right now, he would
be honored to see [them] and all that they&apos;re accomplishing for our nation.&quot;I think of his legacyWhen he was alive, he was so much larger than
life. Even though he has passed on, it&apos;s an honor for me to be able to
continue that tradition. At the core of our family is service,
patriotism, and this country, and to be able to be here today to
represent him and our family is a great honor.&quot;For more news from around the fleet, visit www.navy.mil.

NNS081031-14. Navy Inspires Youth About Engineering Programs

By Staff Sgt. Benjamin Rodriguez, Chief of Naval Personnel - Diversity
Directorate

LAS VEGAS (NNS) -- The Navy joined with the Society of Mexican American
Engineers and Scientists (MAES) to host a&quot;Science Extravaganza&quot;for
students of William E. Orr Middle School Oct. 23.

The event was held at the University of Nevada Las Vegas as part of
MAES&apos; annual conference. More than 150 students attended the event,
designed to encourage young minds to consider the fields of science and
engineering.&quot;It&apos;s cool because some of them like to blow up stuff, and some of them
like to go under water,&quot;said 11-year-old Omar Garcia  of course he
said he was most interested in the&quot;blowing up stuff.&quot;When asked if he
ever thought about joining the Navy when he was older, with the
innocence of childhood he responded,&quot;No, because my mom would worry a lot.&quot;On the other hand, 11-year-old Zarabi Inzunza, when learning about the
Navy and all the&quot;cool&quot;and cold places (like the Antarctica) that
Sailors get to see, said,&quot;When I get older, I&apos;m going to join the Navy!&quot;Throughout the event, the students were offered a number of activities,
including a campus tour, workshops and panel discussions. Some thought
one of the highlights of the day was the nuclear submarine
question-and-answer session with several officers from the ballistic
missile submarine USS Nevada (SSBN-73), including Commanding Officer
Cmdr. Mark Behning.

What started out as a presentation on submarine technology quickly
turned into a high tide of questions about submarine lifestyle. Students
were eager to learn of the different living conditions, travel
opportunities and work experiences the Navy had to offer in the field of
engineering.

They asked the crew members,&quot;Can you see animals in the water? Is there
training for people who stay under water for 72 days? How fast does a
submarine go?&quot;When learning about the living arrangements, the students wanted to know
how many showers there were for more than 200 Sailors.&quot;Four,&quot;replied Behning.&quot;Well, five, but one is mine.&quot;Later in the day, Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy (MCPON) Joe
Campa Jr., spoke to the students about the significance of his cultural
background as a Hispanic and how it shaped his life and his career in
the Navy. He encouraged the youth to pursue science, technology,
engineering and math education as an investment in their future.&quot;We need young Americans that pursue technical degrees whether they
serve the military or not.&quot;We need that,&quot;said Campa,&quot;because it
strengthens who we are as Americans.&quot;MAES participant Teresa Specht, who is an electrical engineering student
at the University of New Mexico, believes that diversity can improve
effectiveness of an organization. She also pushes engineering and
science because of the opportunities she sees to improve the lives of
minorities.&quot;Hispanics come from different backgrounds and have different needs
which could highlight new ways of doing things,&quot;she said.

The science extravaganza provided a chance for the Navy to submerge
middle school students into submarine conversation in hopes of sparking
an interest in the Navy, while emphasizing on the importance of
diversity and higher education.

It was part of an ongoing collaboration with MAES to help bring
awareness of the Navy to the Hispanic engineering community and to
assist them in their efforts to encourage youth to embrace STEM education.

NNS081031-10. Moneywise Seminar Comes to Naples

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (AW) Chris Henry, Fleet
Public Affairs Center Det. Europe

NAPLES, Italy (NNS) -- A financial coach and author as well as the host
of Public Broadcast System&apos;s television show&quot;Moneywise&quot;offered a
financial seminar,&quot;Moneywise in the Military&quot;to service members and
their families and government civilians at the Naval Support Activity,
Capodichino base Oct. 24.

Coach and author Peter Bielagus along with show how Kelvin Boston spoke
to more than 100 attendees.

Bielagus addressed several topics including the significance of strong
personal finances and the importance understanding your credit score.&quot;Banks, mortgage and rental companies use your credit score to determine
what your interest rate on a mortgage or loan will be and also to
determine what to charge for auto insurance,&quot;said Bielagus.

Boston assured the audience that many people can make money in a
recessionary period and there are millionaires in the military.&quot;Reducing your debts will increase your net income, and then you can
start saving and building personal wealth,&quot;said Boston.&quot;Take advantage
of your military benefits; utilize your command financial specialists
and the Thrift Savings Plan. These benefits can help you become more
financially successful.&quot;Boston and Bielagus both encouraged the audience to start saving now for
their futures.&quot;I learned about how effective the Thrift Savings Plan can be and how
easy it is to enroll,&quot;said Engineman 1st Class (SW) Brian Lawrenz.&quot;After today I&apos;m going to check my credit report and find out my score.&quot;The financial seminar is part of the Department of Defense&apos;s financial
education initiative which is program designed to help service members
their families build wealth through reducing debt and establishing
savings goals.

NNS081031-15. Naval Academy Honored at Women of Color Conference

By Chief Mass Communication Specialist (SW) Misty Trent, U.S. Naval
Academy Public Affairs

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (NNS) -- Naval Academy personnel were among 22 Navy
representatives honored at the 13th annual Women of Color Science,
Technology, Engineering and Math Conference in Dallas Oct. 23-25.

The conference and awards ceremony recognized achievement in the fields
of science and technology.

The Naval Academy awardees, Lt. Anne Gibbon, Professor Maria Schroeder
and Miriam Stanicic, were recognized at the 2008 Women of Color Awards,
celebrating achievement in the fields of science and technology. Other
Navy awardees included Senior Military Assistant to the Secretary of the
Navy Rear Adm. Michelle Howard; Chief of Naval Operations&apos; (CNO) Special
Assistant for Diversity Capt. Yolanda Reagans; and Capt. Cynthia Macri,
M.D., Vice President for Recruitment and Diversity at the Uniformed
Services University of the Health Sciences.&quot;This event was filled with driven, positive, educated, goal-oriented,
and very accomplished women from all different walks of life,&quot;said
Midshipman 1st Class Meagan LaBossiere, who was among the group of eight
Naval Academy delegates who attended the conference.&quot;Seeing so many
successful women of all shades and colors come together in such a manner
truly inspired me.&quot;Deputy Commander, United States Transportation Command Vice Adm. Ann
Rondeau served as the awarding official for the Navy honorees.
Approximately 4,000 guests attended the conference and awards ceremony,
which was sponsored by Career Communications Group (CCG), a
minority-owned talent management company that provides diversity and
leadership solutions to individuals and organizations with a focus on
promoting minority achievement in STEM fields.&quot;The National Women of Color Science, Technology, Engineering, and
Mathematics Conference awards are designed to recognize the
accomplishments of women of color in STEM fields, whose contributions
often go unrecognized,&quot;explained Miller J. Roberts III, Corporate
Communications Manager for CCG.&quot;Award honorees were chosen for
leadership, innovation and outstanding work in STEM fields.&quot;The CNO&apos;s Diversity Policy states,&quot;Diversity has made our nation and
Navy stronger. To derive the most from that diversity, every individual,
military or civilian, must be encouraged and enabled to reach his or her
full potential. They must be inspired and empowered to attain the most
senior levels of leadership. That empowerment today is unleashed by
involved, thoughtful, proactive and enlightened leaders.&quot;To that end, in July CNO Adm. Gary Roughead said,&quot;Clearly for the Navy
and the type of warfare that I think we&apos;re going to be in the future,
the need for the nation to take seriously a foundation in science,
technology, engineering, and those matters, I think is very important.&quot;&quot;As the next generations face the choice to continue service or to find
another corporation at which to use their talents, the challenge faced
by the Navy to retain those standouts is critical,&quot;said Gibbon.&quot;The
missions facing our sea service are varied and all are extremely
challenging. Our success in meeting each of the missions is based upon
the sustained performance of great teams, and each of those great Navy
teams must be led by the best leaders.&quot;The Women of Color STEM Conference offered women in both industry and
academia the opportunity for lectures and roundtable discussions about
the opportunities and challenges of working in the hard sciences. At the
conference, Navy attendees joined guests from industry, academia and
community organizations and took advantage of the opportunity to network
and learn.&quot;A reoccurring theme that I kept hearing all weekend was &apos;inclusion
engagement,&apos; better known to the United States Naval Academy as
&apos;diversity outreach,&apos;&quot;said LaBossiere, who serves as the president of
the Naval Academy chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers.&quot;These top corporations have whole-heartedly bought into both the
advantages and benefits of diversity, which lead to profit maximization
and efficiency within their respective corporations. Similarly, the U.S.
Navy has also recognized the need to move in the same direction with
respect to diversity in the military.&quot;For more news from U.S. Naval Academy, visit www.navy.mil/local/usna/.

NNS081031-08. Vinson Sailors Continue Partnership with Institute of
Government

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Kristan Robertson, USS Carl
Vinson Public Affairs

ATHENS, Ga. (NNS) -- Crew members assigned to USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70)
accompanied the ship&apos;s executive officer and command master chief Oct.
23-24, to learn more of the life and legacy of the aircraft carrier&apos;s
late namesake, Carl Vinson, in Athens, Ga.

Each year, Carl Vinson Sailors visit the Carl Vinson Institute of
Government located at the University of Georgia (UGA) and the former
Georgia congressman&apos;s hometown of Milledgeville.

During their visit,&quot;Gold Eagle&quot;Sailors met with leadership figures
from the institute, while also taking the opportunity to meet with the
UGA gymnastics team and football coach.&quot;We were able to explore each other&apos;s service to the country while
delving into topics of history and leadership, and it proved to be a
great opportunity for our Sailors to interact with academic and athletic
leaders of such a large university,&quot;said Capt. Steve Koehler, Vinson&apos;s
executive officer.

While in Milledgeville, the Sailors conversed with the mayor and city
manager, while hearing actual stories from an acquaintance of Carl
Vinson. Afterward, they received a police escort to the Georgia Military
College where Vinson was once a student. From there, they ventured to
his two former homes and paid their respects at his final resting place.&quot;It&apos;s nice to meet people and hear stories about the person our ship is
named after,&quot;said Chief Navy Counselor (AW/SW) Jeffrey Sabia.&quot;You have
to do something extraordinary to have your name given to a ship, and
after learning about Carl Vinson, you really begin to understand how
extraordinary he was.&quot;Known as&quot;the father of the two-coast Navy,&quot;Vinson urged Congress to
build more ships when many felt it wasn&apos;t a priority. His perseverance
and dedication to building a stronger fleet continues to benefit America
and its Sailors around the world every day.&quot;Carl Vinson was an advocate for the Navy and its mission,&quot;said Sabia.&quot;He was a true patriot.&quot;USS Carl Vinson is currently undergoing its scheduled refueling complex
overhaul (RCOH) at Northrop Grumman Newport News shipyard. The RCOH is
an extensive yard period that all Nimitz-class aircraft carriers go
through near the mid-point of their 50-year life cycle.

During RCOH Carl Vinson&apos;s nuclear fuel will be replenished and the
ship&apos;s services and infrastructure will be upgraded to make her the most
state-of-the-art aircraft carrier in the fleet and prepare for another
25 years or more of service.

NNS081031-13. NAVSTA GTMO Sailors Get Career Management Advice

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Kimberly Williams, Naval
Station Guantanamo Bay Public Affairs

GUANTANAMO BAY, Cuba (NNS) -- Sailors from Naval Station (NAVSTA), Naval
Expeditionary Guard Battalion (NEGB), Joint Task Force (JTF) and other
tenant commands on Guantanamo Bay (GTMO)took advantage of the Career
Management Symposium (CMS) Oct. 22 - 24 at NAVSTA Bulkeley Hall.

Detailers and career management officials from Naval Personnel Command&apos;s
Center for Career Development (CCD) of Millington, Tenn., traveled to
GTMO to discuss subjects like billeting options and career management.&quot;In this symposium, Sailors learn things like what a chiefs selection
board looks at. I like to use this example because every junior Sailor
is on a similar track  they are trying to make chief or officer, so the
things they learn in the selection board briefing can help them to make
better informed decisions when selecting billets throughout their
career,&quot;said Senior Chief Aviation Electronics Technician (AW/SW)
Patrick Hosterman, AT lead detailer.&quot;I will let people select their orders and not try to force anything on
them. I give them the information they need to be successful in making
informed decisions for their careers, but ultimately its the Sailor&apos;s
decision [where he or she goes],&quot;said Hosterman.&quot;The most important thing I want Sailors to remember is that planning
for the future is very important in your career and in the detailing
process. Look at career-enhancing jobs vice location. It will make for a
better career.&quot;Sailors of all pay grades attended briefings and one-on-one detailing
sessions that outlined the benefits of advancement and a long-term
career in the Navy.
The symposium was organized by the GTMO command career counseling team.&quot;It&apos;s important to have symposiums like this one because it helps bring
big picture career into perspective,&quot;said Master-at-Arms 2nd Class
Desiree Rivers, assistant NAVSTA command career counselor.&quot;Sailors get
to see detailers face-to-face that they usually only talk to over the
phone and receive communication from them that is consistent to what we
[career counselors] have been telling them.&quot;Other topics covered during the week-long event included an officer
career management brief, enlisted community selection board brief, chief
petty officer leadership brief and a community brief for the medical corps.

NNS081031-12. Moneywise Speakers Tell Sailors to Save Now

By Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Jonathan Idle, Naval Air Station
Sigonella Public Affairs

SIGONELLA, Sicily (NNS) -- The host of the Public Broadcast System&apos;s&quot;Moneywise&quot;series, and a, Young America&apos;s financial coach and author,
spoke to service members and their families as part of&quot;Moneywise in the
Military&quot;tour at Naval Air Station Sigonella Oct. 27.

Kelvin Boston and Peter Bielagus&apos; visit to Sigonella was facilitated by
the Fleet&amp;Family Support Center as part of a European tour which
includes stops at installations in Souda Bay, Crete; Rota, Spain;
Naples, Aviano and Vicenza, all in Italy.

Bielagus began the seminar by explaining the importance of a paying off
credit card debt and dispelling rumors on the topic.&quot;One way to get your credit score up is to pay off credit card debt,&quot;Bielagus said.&quot;The faster you can pay it off, the faster your score
will go up. There is a rumor going around, and I hear this all the time,
&apos;Peter, in order to raise your credit score you actually have to have
some credit card debt.&apos; That is not true. I don&apos;t know where that rumor
came from.&quot;Bielagus explained that putting off financial planning and not building
your savings now is just a cycle which will continue to perpetuate itself.&quot;I need you to remember this one thing,&quot;he said.&quot;Start before you need
to start.&quot;He broke down budgeting into a three-step process.&quot;Tell me what you want,&quot;Bielagus said.&quot;Tell me what you don&apos;t want.
Tell me where your money is going. Then you&apos;re in a perfect position to
do your budget.&quot;After Bielagus spoke, Boston took center stage to discuss how each
person can become a millionaire while serving in the military.&quot;We&apos;ve been all around the world,&quot;Boston said.&quot;In every installation
we&apos;ve visited, in every ship we&apos;ve been on, at every base we&apos;ve visited
we&apos;ve found men and women serving their country who&apos;re now millionaires.&quot;Boston discussed how fear is driving the financial crisis back home
deeper into the hole.&quot;We have some fundamental economic issues back home that we have to deal
with, but what&apos;s compounding the problem is fear,&quot;he said.&quot;Fear in our
financial markets. Fear in our business markets. So, as a country we all
have to take this journey from financial fear to financial freedom.&quot;Boston explained to the audience that finances are not something you can
avoid.&quot;You may decide not manage your credit effectively. That&apos;s OK, but it
will follow you the rest of your life,&quot;Boston said.&quot;You may decide not
to own your own home or condominium or put a little money aside in a
thrift saving plan, but you will regret it for the rest of your life.
You may decide not to get your education while you&apos;re here in the
military or make sure your spouse gets their education, but that too you
will regret for the rest of your life. You may not decide to play the
wealth building game, but the game will still play you.&quot;For more news from Naval Air Station Sigonella, visit

NNS081031-07. Carl Vinson Combat Systems Begins Wave Guide Testing

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class (SW) Candice Villarreal, USS
Carl Vinson Public Affairs

NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (NNS) -- The USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) Combat Systems
Department is conducting its first wave guide tests in more than three
years, as the ship prepares to enter the final phases of its Refueling
Complex Overhaul (RCOH) at Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding.

The AN/SPS-43 and AN/SPS-67 wave guides, last operational in early 2005,
allow the safe, mission-essential transmission of radio frequency (RF)
signals throughout the ship.&quot;All of our radar equipment transmits radio frequency (RF) signals,
which, without wave guides, could potentially be harmful,&quot;said
Electronics Technician 3rd Class Jermaine Gordon.&quot;These guides are
conduits that ensure the safety of our crew, so they&apos;re very important
to us.&quot;The Nimitz-class aircraft carrier utilizes RF signals for numerous radar
functions on board, including air search, fire control, weathering,
navigation, communications and air traffic control applications at sea.&quot;This kind of testing will prove to be absolutely mission-critical when
we get underway,&quot;said Electronics Technician 1st Class (SW) Bradley
Stewart.&quot;Without the radars, we can&apos;t navigate or fly planes, and we can&apos;t
defend our ship from enemy threats. These tests are the backbone for
ensuring that all of our systems get back on line properly before we
head back out to sea.&quot;While the division is hard at work conducting cooling flushes and acid
washes to clean out the system in preparation for sea trials, some of
the fleet&apos;s newest Sailors are getting extensive hands-on, in-rate
training for the very first time.

According to Stewart, the entire combat systems team is committed to
ensuring that each Sailor in the division acquires the skills he or she
will need when the aircraft carrier returns to operational status in
support of America&apos;s maritime strategy.&quot;Right now we&apos;re maintaining and testing our equipment for the first
time since I&apos;ve been on board, so it&apos;s a big milestone for me,&quot;said
Gordon.&quot;I am actually putting my hands on the equipment now and seeing
it all get closer to becoming operational again every day. It&apos;s
fulfilling to be able to do what I signed up for, and I think we&apos;re all
excited about the fact that we&apos;re going to be out on the water soon.&quot;USS Carl Vinson is currently undergoing its scheduled refueling complex
overhaul (RCOH) at Northrop Grumman Newport News shipyard. The RCOH is
an extensive yard period that all Nimitz-class aircraft carriers go
through near the mid-point of their 50-year life cycle.

During RCOH Carl Vinson&apos;s nuclear fuel will be replenished and the
ship&apos;s services and infrastructure will be upgraded to make her the most
state-of-the-art aircraft carrier in the fleet and prepare for another
25 years or more of service.

NNS081031-05. PCU George H.W. Bush Sailors Chosen for STA-21

By Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Joel S. Kolodziejczak,
Pre-Commissioning Unit George H.W. Bush Public Affairs

NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (NNS) -- The Seaman to Admiral-21 (STA 21) program
results are out, and two Pre-Commissioning Unit (PCU) George H.W. Bush
(CVN 77) Sailors are trading in their enlisted stripes for officer khakis.

PCU Bush&apos;s Electronics Technician 2nd Class Jennifer E. Swanson and
Machinist&apos;s Mate 2nd Class Jacob T. Bush are two of 210 Sailors selected
Navywide for the STA-21 Commissioning Program, which allows enlisted
Sailors to become commissioned officers after completing a baccalaureate
degree. During this time, Sailors continue to receive their regular pay.&quot;Since I was seven and living in Atlanta, I wanted to be a pilot,&quot;Swanson said.&quot;I remember watching the planes at the airport and knew I
wanted to fly. I guess you could say I now have the chance to live my
dream.&quot;Swanson&apos;s studies start with a three-month refresher course to
reacclimate her to a school environment, followed by three months at the
Naval Science Institute as well as a three-year college program to
finish her degree in electrical engineering.&quot;The day I graduate I will be commissioned as a United States naval
officer,&quot;Swanson said. She begins flight training after graduation.&quot;I
feel that being an officer will put me in a position to make Sailor&apos;s
lives better and raise the standard of living.&quot;Bush joined the military three-and-a-half years ago with the goal of
making something of his life.&quot;I went to college but wasn&apos;t on the path I wanted to be, so I joined
the Navy to give me a better shot at reaching my goals,&quot;Bush said.&quot;I
have been selected as a core officer which will allow me to work just
about anywhere in the Navy.&quot;Bush said he had the full support of the command as well as his family.
His father obtained the rank of chief radiomen in seven years, and Bush
used to joke that he would make chief petty officer faster.

Bush said he had many interviews and believed his ability to make a good
impression during them went a long way toward being selected for STA-21.&quot;I had to write a one-page paper which told who I was, why I wanted to
be an officer as well as my strengths and weaknesses,&quot;Bush said.

The two Sailors will begin their training in February 2009 to become
naval officers.

The aircraft carrier is under construction at Northrop Grumman Newport
News Shipyard, Newport News, Va.

NNS081031-09. Women&apos;s Symposium Encourages Networking, Mentoring

By Mass Communications Specialist 2nd Class Erin Kerby, The Waterline

ARLINGTON, Va. (NNS) -- Seeking to strengthen networking and mentorship
opportunities, more than 200 female cadets, midshipmen and active-duty
and retired officers met at the Academy Women&apos;s 5th annual leadership
symposium, Oct. 17-19 at the Women in Military Service for America Memorial.

Susan Feland, founder and president, established the AcademyWomen
organization more than five years ago to provide a means for women to
discuss issues relevant to female service members.&quot;The idea is to get people to talk about things that they have done or
things that they have seen,&quot;Feland said.&quot;There are obviously a
significant number of women in the military, but the frustrating part
for me was that none of us were talking, and we all seemed to have to
reinvent the wheel every time there was an issue.&quot;The theme of this year&apos;s symposium was&quot;Stories of our Sisters.&quot;Retired Rear Adm. Marsha&quot;Marty&quot;Evans, who delivered the keynote
address, became a high-level leader in the nonprofit world serving as
both the chief executive officer of the Girl Scouts and the American Red
Cross after her successful Navy career.

During her address,&quot;Leadership without Easy Answers,&quot;Evans spoke of
the importance of gathering together in groups and sharing stories.
Evans told the women to tend to their relationships and nurture their
network of support.

With the goal of professionally and personally strengthening the women
of the military, mentorship is one of the key focuses of not only the
AcademyWomen&apos;s mission but the Navy&apos;s mission as well.&quot;Mentoring is paramount in the Navy and greatly affects our ability to
accomplish the mission,&quot;said Rear Adm. Wendi Carpenter, commander of
the Navy Warfare Development Command.&quot;It is how we develop our future
leaders, allowing and encouraging each individual to develop to his or
her maximum potential. It enables the whole force and future leaders to
maximize their readiness and impact.&quot;Carpenter was a guest speaker at the symposium on the&quot;Superwoman
Complex&quot;panel, along with Rear Adm. Ann DeBaets Gilbride, associate
director of Naval Intelligence. The panel discussed the many roles women
assume, especially in the military, and ways to ease anxiety.

Both Carpenter and Gilbride are supporters of the mission of the
AcademyWomen.&quot;Outside of the normal workplace, it offers another source of
networking, mentoring and general information to provide growth
opportunities,&quot;said Carpenter.

The AcademyWomen organization has assisted the Navy&apos;s Office of Women&apos;s
Policy in the development of the NavyWomen eMentor Leadership Program, a
subset of its own program.&quot;It is a brand new program,&quot;said Stefanie Goebel, director of the
AcademyWomen eMentor Leadership Program.&quot;We are building the eMentor
Leadership program, and it will have different groups, one of those
groups being the Navy women.&quot;Participating women are matched through a state-of-the-art mentoring
website.&quot;Online mentoring allows mentor pairs to create a relationship that is
very flexible in duration, intensity and purpose,&quot;said Lt. Hope Brill
who works for the Navy&apos;s Office of Women&apos;s Policy.&quot;The benefits to mentors and mentees will contribute to increased
professional and personal satisfaction of our Navy service members,&quot;said Brill,&quot;which is an important aspect of developing our future leaders.

With the growth of the AcademyWomen organization and its eMentoring
programs, as well as a number of other professional development and
mentoring groups with direct ties to the Navy, the women of the Navy
today, yesterday and tomorrow have the tools available to have a
successful career and network with those who have already achieved success.&quot;Every single person should value the opportunity to be a mentor,&quot;said
Carpenter.&quot;It is a part of your own development as a leader. Get a
mentor; be a mentor, and devote all the energy necessary in both of
those roles.&quot;AcademyWomen is a nonprofit organization devoted to the professional and
personal cultivation of military women officers, officer candidates and
veterans.

NNS081031-11. USS San Antonio Stays Connected to Namesake City, Heritage

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class (SW) Brian Goodwin, Iwo Jima
Expeditionary Strike Group Public Affairs

USS SAN ANTONIO, At Sea (NNS) -- The amphibious transport dock ship USS
San Antonio (LPD 17) shares more than just the name of Texas city
throughout the ship, there are constant reminders and mannerisms that
allude to the rich history of the city of San Antonio.

San Antonio&apos;s historical roots are the foundation for the city that is
rapidly moving forward into the 21st century, much like the
technologically advanced LPD, which builds on accomplishments of prior
LPDs and steams towards the future.&quot;USS San Antonio is the most high-tech, advanced amphibious ship ever
built,&quot;said former Secretary of the Navy John H. Dalton at the ship&apos;s
announcement ceremony in 1996.&quot;It is an honor to name such an important
new combat ship after San Antonio, the site of the battle of the Alamo.&quot;&quot;The battle of the Alamo inspires persistence, determination, and
ultimate victory,&quot;stated Cmdr. Kurt Kastner, San Antonio&apos;s commanding
officer.&quot;LPD 17 carries these qualities within her wherever she sails.&quot;San Antonio&apos;s motto,&quot;Never Retreat, Never Surrender&quot;comes from the
speech made by Lt. Col. William Barret Travis in 1836 at the battle of
the Alamo.&quot;I am besieged by a thousand or more of the Mexicans under [General]
Santa Anna,&quot;said Travis.&quot;I have sustained a continual bombardment and
cannonade for 24 hours and have not lost a man. I shall never surrender
or retreat!&quot;San Antonio&apos;s mess deck&quot;King Ranch Café&quot;borrows its name from the
cattle grounds in San Antonio, Texas, where cattle were herded and
raised for food.&quot;The names on the backs of the chairs in the mess decks are the names of
the people who fought in the battle of the Alamo,&quot;stated Kastner.

The San Antonio-area Navy League extended an open invitation to USS San
Antonio to attend two annual festivals in the city, the Battle of the
Alamo Remembrance and navy week.&quot;During the month of April, the city remembers the Battle of the Alamo
and the fight the citizens of the city put up to defend the border
between the newly forming United States and Mexico,&quot;said Lt. j.g.
Kathleen Friel, the ship&apos;s navigator.&quot;Later in the year during the
month of November, San Antonio celebrates navy week.

The festivals give Sailors the opportunity to attend dinner receptions,
parades and the Alamo remembrances.&quot;The city of San Antonio also boasts several military installations.&quot;The city of San Antonio has a rich history of military members in all
branches and is affectionately called &apos;military city USA&apos; because of the
five military bases located within its limits,&quot;added Kastner.

To further their relationship with the city, USS San Antonio has
recently started an adopt-a-school partnership with a local elementary
school.&quot;USS San Antonio was looking for a partnership program with a school in
San Antonio, Texas, and Dorie Miller Elementary School was selected,&quot;said Kastner.

Continued ties to the city of San Antonio will assure that future
Sailors and Marines who serve aboard LPD 17 remember and honor the
ship&apos;s proud heritage.

San Antonio is deployed to the U.S. 5th Fleet area of operations to
conduct maritime security operations (MSO). MSO helps develop security
in the maritime environment. From security arises stability that results
in global economic prosperity. MSO complements the counterterrorism and
security efforts of regional nations and seek to disrupt violent
extremists&apos; use of the maritime environment as a venue for attack or to
transport personnel, weapons or other material.

NNS081031-02. Nitze Wins Energy Conservation Award

By Ensign Chris Flores, USS Nitze Public Affairs

USS NITZE (NNS) -- Improvements in the efficient operation of the ship
earned the USS Nitze (DDG 94) the prestigious Secretary of the Navy
Energy Conservation Award for 2008 in the Small Afloat category.

Utilizing technological advances and incorporating proactive energy
conservation policies, Nitze saved 20,500 barrels of fuel in 2007,
saving the Navy nearly $2 million that fiscal year.&quot;Increasing fuel costs around the world have made fuel savings more
important to the Navy than it has been before,&quot;said Cmdr. Kenneth S.
Long, Nitze&apos;s commanding officer.&quot;The money saved from fuel savings
allows for greater efficiency in supporting additional naval operations.&quot;Nitze often operates in&quot;fuel efficient mode,&quot;which saves an average of
10 percent on fuel, but Nitze&apos;s leadership has extended energy
conservation beyond fuel efficient mode. When planning the ship&apos;s daily
and long-range operations, every effort is made to maximize the use of
trail shaft to minimize fuel consumption.

When in ports with shore power, the ship goes to single generator
operations and receives hotel services conserving ship&apos;s energy. In
port, the ship goes to an economical plant alignment by maintaining air
conditioning boundaries, conducting single reefer operations and
operating a single fire pump, which reduces power demand up to 400 amps.

Key Nitze crew members have received energy conservation training,
including the main propulsion assistant, engineer officers of the watch
(EOOW) and the chief engineer. After attending energy conservation
(ENCON) seminars, they have incorporated several best practices into the
ship&apos;s program.

For example, Nitze has identified opportunities for split plant
operations in traditional&quot;full plant&quot;situations. Now, all officers of
the deck and EOOWs have been trained to use the most efficient line-up
whenever possible.

The ship also implements fuel conservation awareness by conducting
monthly training. Fuel curves are posted in the central control station
and bridge to measure, analyze and predict performance. All hands are
reminded to maintain A/C boundaries, turn off lights in unmanned spaces,
and turn off electrical or electronics equipment not in use.

The engineer&apos;s night orders contain energy conservation articles to
highlight the criteria to conserve energy.

Through Nitze&apos;s advancements in crew training, technology and
incorporation of energy conservation best practices, maximum efficiency
is being achieved at multiple levels while minimizing fuel consumption.
Nitze is now authorized to fly the Secretary of the Navy&apos;s Energy
Conservation Flag while in port.

The ship is part of the Theodore Roosevelt Strike Group.

NNS081031-16. Seabees Aid in Rescue of U.S. Ambassador

By Steelworker 3rd Class Siamac Moghaddam, Det. Sao Tome Public Affairs

SAO TOME, Africa Partnership Station (NNS) -- In one of the worst
downpours in recent Sao Tomean history, Seabees from Naval Mobile
Construction Battalion (NMCB) 4 answered the State Department&apos;s call for
help Oct. 25, rescuing several personnel including the U.S. ambassador
to Gabon and Sao Tome.

That day, the tiny island nation of Sao Tome and Principe was suddenly
hit by a major tropical storm. The storm closed Route Nacional 1, the
sole road connecting the capital city of Sao Tome with the southern half
of the country, due to a heavy mudslide.

At the time, Ambassador Eunice Reddick, her staff, and the mayor of the
city of Angolares were returning from a lunch reception on the southern
end of the island of Sao Tome. On the way back to their hotel, the
ambassador&apos;s party encountered a mudslide that completely covered the
road, closing the only passage north and stranding the personnel for
more than five hours. As the rain continued to come down, they realized
conditions were worsening and were trapped by 30 meters of waist-high
mud, limiting their movement.&quot;The heavily mountainous terrain at that location, and the continuing
rain, gave indications a further mudslide was imminent,&quot;Reddick stated
in an e-mail.

After evaluating the situation, the defense attaché contacted the Seabee
team. After explaining the situation, Steelworker 1st Class (SCW) Eugene
Burston, Construction Mechanic 2nd Class (SCW/FMF) Wade Pendley,
Equipment Operator 2nd Class (SCW) Kenneth Hoffman and Constructionman
Donald Guffey volunteered to help.

The Seabees loaded up in two half-ton pick-ups and traveled
approximately 30 kilometers at night down a winding mountain jungle road
in the middle of a tropical storm with limited visibility.&quot;When we got the request, it wasn&apos;t even a question. We just packed up
and headed south,&quot;Burston said. Just north of the U.S. embassy
entourage&apos;s position, the Seabees discovered a mudslide 50 yards wide
and 9 feet high covered with waist-high mud and downed trees.

After assessing the situation, the Seabees ran a chain from their truck
and walked across the mud field with only the aide of flashlights to
provide a chain hold for people to cross.&quot;The Seabees personally came to our aid and escorted, and carried, us
across the mud field. Approximately 50 civilians were able to cross to
safety,&quot;wrote Reddick in an e-mail.&quot;The Seabees traversed the mud fields several times through the tropical
storm that evening to ensure the safety of all persons on either side of
the mud slide. All the while, they disregarded their personal safety to
ensure the safety of myself and my entourage in spite of a worsening
storm and the real threat of another mudslide.&quot;&quot;The Seabees risked their lives to save the ambassador, her team and Sao
Tomeans stranded behind the mudslide,&quot;Air Force Lt. Col. Rene Dechaine,
the Embassy&apos;s defense attaché said.&quot;We were all waiting for another
mudslide to come. Everyone was extremely lucky that they showed up.
Because of them nobody died or was injured.&quot;When it comes to disaster relief, Seabees consider themselves
second-to-none. From Hurricane Katrina to the Pakistani earthquake,
Seabees have been at the front lines providing humanitarian assistance
and support to those in need. NMCB 4 is deployed to Sao Tome and
Principe in support of African Partnership Station.

NNS081031-03. Bob Hope&apos;s Spirit Lives On Through Awards Program

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SW) Elizabeth Vlahos,
Defense Media Activity - Anacostia

WASHINGTON (NNS) -- Representatives, one from each of the U.S. Armed
Forces and one from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, were honored
at the Spirit of Hope Awards Ceremony at the Pentagon Auditorium Oct. 28.&quot;In presenting these awards, we are in essence saying &apos;thank you&apos; to Bob
Hope for leading the way,&quot;said Mr. Harvey Barnum, Deputy Assistant
Secretary of the Navy for Reserve Affairs and Medal of Honor recipient,
in his opening remarks on the legacy of the award.&quot;Bob Hope set the bar
high when it comes to those honored values of duty, honor, courage,
loyalty, integrity and selfless dedication.&quot;The Spirit of Hope award, established in 1997 by the Bob Hope Family
Foundation, recognizes one individual or organization from each branch
of the armed forces and the Office of the Secretary of Defense who not
only captures the values and integrity of the service but who also
exemplifies the patriotism and dedication to the armed forces
characteristic of the late comedian.

Chief Aviation Support Equipment Technician Giovanni Balingit, from
Fleet Readiness Center Southwest, was the Navy&apos;s nominee.&quot;It&apos;s a really great honor for me to receive this award and represent
the Navy and [my command],&quot;said Balingit.&quot;I would like to thank the
Sailors and families of Fleet Readiness Center who have helped me out
during our weekly community service and making a difference in the
community.&quot;Balingit&apos;s list of accomplishments includes his management of many
quality-of-life programs, to include voting assistance, U.S.
naturalization, volunteer income tax assistance and personal finance
management.

In 2007, Balingit revamped the command DAPA program with a highly
effective anti-drug use and deglamorization campaign, effecting a record
67 percent incident reduction rate. In addition to coordinating a
plethora of volunteer efforts and community service projects, he
counseled many Sailors in matters of career advancement, attaining
citizenship and policy compliance.

The awardees from the other branches were Michael Peterson, for the
Army; Cynthia Martinez, for the Marine Corps; the crew of USCGC Alert,
for the Coast Guard; the late Nicholas G. Grand, for the Air Force,
accepted by his son, George; and Walter K. White, for the Office of the
Secretary of Defense.

Attendees believed the event was a fitting celebration of Hopes&apos; legacy
and the spirit of the award.&quot;I feel so blessed to be able to be here today to celebrate these men
and women in uniform,&quot;said Miranda Hope, granddaughter of the legendary
comedian.&quot;I know that if my grandfather were here right now, he would
be honored to see [them] and all that they&apos;re accomplishing for our nation.&quot;I think of his legacyWhen he was alive, he was so much larger than
life. Even though he has passed on, it&apos;s an honor for me to be able to
continue that tradition. At the core of our family is service,
patriotism, and this country, and to be able to be here today to
represent him and our family is a great honor.&quot;For more news from around the fleet, visit www.navy.mil.

NNS081031-14. Navy Inspires Youth About Engineering Programs

By Staff Sgt. Benjamin Rodriguez, Chief of Naval Personnel - Diversity
Directorate

LAS VEGAS (NNS) -- The Navy joined with the Society of Mexican American
Engineers and Scientists (MAES) to host a&quot;Science Extravaganza&quot;for
students of William E. Orr Middle School Oct. 23.

The event was held at the University of Nevada Las Vegas as part of
MAES&apos; annual conference. More than 150 students attended the event,
designed to encourage young minds to consider the fields of science and
engineering.&quot;It&apos;s cool because some of them like to blow up stuff, and some of them
like to go under water,&quot;said 11-year-old Omar Garcia  of course he
said he was most interested in the&quot;blowing up stuff.&quot;When asked if he
ever thought about joining the Navy when he was older, with the
innocence of childhood he responded,&quot;No, because my mom would worry a lot.&quot;On the other hand, 11-year-old Zarabi Inzunza, when learning about the
Navy and all the&quot;cool&quot;and cold places (like the Antarctica) that
Sailors get to see, said,&quot;When I get older, I&apos;m going to join the Navy!&quot;Throughout the event, the students were offered a number of activities,
including a campus tour, workshops and panel discussions. Some thought
one of the highlights of the day was the nuclear submarine
question-and-answer session with several officers from the ballistic
missile submarine USS Nevada (SSBN-73), including Commanding Officer
Cmdr. Mark Behning.

What started out as a presentation on submarine technology quickly
turned into a high tide of questions about submarine lifestyle. Students
were eager to learn of the different living conditions, travel
opportunities and work experiences the Navy had to offer in the field of
engineering.

They asked the crew members,&quot;Can you see animals in the water? Is there
training for people who stay under water for 72 days? How fast does a
submarine go?&quot;When learning about the living arrangements, the students wanted to know
how many showers there were for more than 200 Sailors.&quot;Four,&quot;replied Behning.&quot;Well, five, but one is mine.&quot;Later in the day, Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy (MCPON) Joe
Campa Jr., spoke to the students about the significance of his cultural
background as a Hispanic and how it shaped his life and his career in
the Navy. He encouraged the youth to pursue science, technology,
engineering and math education as an investment in their future.&quot;We need young Americans that pursue technical degrees whether they
serve the military or not.&quot;We need that,&quot;said Campa,&quot;because it
strengthens who we are as Americans.&quot;MAES participant Teresa Specht, who is an electrical engineering student
at the University of New Mexico, believes that diversity can improve
effectiveness of an organization. She also pushes engineering and
science because of the opportunities she sees to improve the lives of
minorities.&quot;Hispanics come from different backgrounds and have different needs
which could highlight new ways of doing things,&quot;she said.

The science extravaganza provided a chance for the Navy to submerge
middle school students into submarine conversation in hopes of sparking
an interest in the Navy, while emphasizing on the importance of
diversity and higher education.

It was part of an ongoing collaboration with MAES to help bring
awareness of the Navy to the Hispanic engineering community and to
assist them in their efforts to encourage youth to embrace STEM education.

NNS081031-10. Moneywise Seminar Comes to Naples

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (AW) Chris Henry, Fleet
Public Affairs Center Det. Europe

NAPLES, Italy (NNS) -- A financial coach and author as well as the host
of Public Broadcast System&apos;s television show&quot;Moneywise&quot;offered a
financial seminar,&quot;Moneywise in the Military&quot;to service members and
their families and government civilians at the Naval Support Activity,
Capodichino base Oct. 24.

Coach and author Peter Bielagus along with show how Kelvin Boston spoke
to more than 100 attendees.

Bielagus addressed several topics including the significance of strong
personal finances and the importance understanding your credit score.&quot;Banks, mortgage and rental companies use your credit score to determine
what your interest rate on a mortgage or loan will be and also to
determine what to charge for auto insurance,&quot;said Bielagus.

Boston assured the audience that many people can make money in a
recessionary period and there are millionaires in the military.&quot;Reducing your debts will increase your net income, and then you can
start saving and building personal wealth,&quot;said Boston.&quot;Take advantage
of your military benefits; utilize your command financial specialists
and the Thrift Savings Plan. These benefits can help you become more
financially successful.&quot;Boston and Bielagus both encouraged the audience to start saving now for
their futures.&quot;I learned about how effective the Thrift Savings Plan can be and how
easy it is to enroll,&quot;said Engineman 1st Class (SW) Brian Lawrenz.&quot;After today I&apos;m going to check my credit report and find out my score.&quot;The financial seminar is part of the Department of Defense&apos;s financial
education initiative which is program designed to help service members
their families build wealth through reducing debt and establishing
savings goals.

NNS081031-15. Naval Academy Honored at Women of Color Conference

By Chief Mass Communication Specialist (SW) Misty Trent, U.S. Naval
Academy Public Affairs

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (NNS) -- Naval Academy personnel were among 22 Navy
representatives honored at the 13th annual Women of Color Science,
Technology, Engineering and Math Conference in Dallas Oct. 23-25.

The conference and awards ceremony recognized achievement in the fields
of science and technology.

The Naval Academy awardees, Lt. Anne Gibbon, Professor Maria Schroeder
and Miriam Stanicic, were recognized at the 2008 Women of Color Awards,
celebrating achievement in the fields of science and technology. Other
Navy awardees included Senior Military Assistant to the Secretary of the
Navy Rear Adm. Michelle Howard; Chief of Naval Operations&apos; (CNO) Special
Assistant for Diversity Capt. Yolanda Reagans; and Capt. Cynthia Macri,
M.D., Vice President for Recruitment and Diversity at the Uniformed
Services University of the Health Sciences.&quot;This event was filled with driven, positive, educated, goal-oriented,
and very accomplished women from all different walks of life,&quot;said
Midshipman 1st Class Meagan LaBossiere, who was among the group of eight
Naval Academy delegates who attended the conference.&quot;Seeing so many
successful women of all shades and colors come together in such a manner
truly inspired me.&quot;Deputy Commander, United States Transportation Command Vice Adm. Ann
Rondeau served as the awarding official for the Navy honorees.
Approximately 4,000 guests attended the conference and awards ceremony,
which was sponsored by Career Communications Group (CCG), a
minority-owned talent management company that provides diversity and
leadership solutions to individuals and organizations with a focus on
promoting minority achievement in STEM fields.&quot;The National Women of Color Science, Technology, Engineering, and
Mathematics Conference awards are designed to recognize the
accomplishments of women of color in STEM fields, whose contributions
often go unrecognized,&quot;explained Miller J. Roberts III, Corporate
Communications Manager for CCG.&quot;Award honorees were chosen for
leadership, innovation and outstanding work in STEM fields.&quot;The CNO&apos;s Diversity Policy states,&quot;Diversity has made our nation and
Navy stronger. To derive the most from that diversity, every individual,
military or civilian, must be encouraged and enabled to reach his or her
full potential. They must be inspired and empowered to attain the most
senior levels of leadership. That empowerment today is unleashed by
involved, thoughtful, proactive and enlightened leaders.&quot;To that end, in July CNO Adm. Gary Roughead said,&quot;Clearly for the Navy
and the type of warfare that I think we&apos;re going to be in the future,
the need for the nation to take seriously a foundation in science,
technology, engineering, and those matters, I think is very important.&quot;&quot;As the next generations face the choice to continue service or to find
another corporation at which to use their talents, the challenge faced
by the Navy to retain those standouts is critical,&quot;said Gibbon.&quot;The
missions facing our sea service are varied and all are extremely
challenging. Our success in meeting each of the missions is based upon
the sustained performance of great teams, and each of those great Navy
teams must be led by the best leaders.&quot;The Women of Color STEM Conference offered women in both industry and
academia the opportunity for lectures and roundtable discussions about
the opportunities and challenges of working in the hard sciences. At the
conference, Navy attendees joined guests from industry, academia and
community organizations and took advantage of the opportunity to network
and learn.&quot;A reoccurring theme that I kept hearing all weekend was &apos;inclusion
engagement,&apos; better known to the United States Naval Academy as
&apos;diversity outreach,&apos;&quot;said LaBossiere, who serves as the president of
the Naval Academy chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers.&quot;These top corporations have whole-heartedly bought into both the
advantages and benefits of diversity, which lead to profit maximization
and efficiency within their respective corporations. Similarly, the U.S.
Navy has also recognized the need to move in the same direction with
respect to diversity in the military.&quot;For more news from U.S. Naval Academy, visit www.navy.mil/local/usna/.

NNS081031-08. Vinson Sailors Continue Partnership with Institute of
Government

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Kristan Robertson, USS Carl
Vinson Public Affairs

ATHENS, Ga. (NNS) -- Crew members assigned to USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70)
accompanied the ship&apos;s executive officer and command master chief Oct.
23-24, to learn more of the life and legacy of the aircraft carrier&apos;s
late namesake, Carl Vinson, in Athens, Ga.

Each year, Carl Vinson Sailors visit the Carl Vinson Institute of
Government located at the University of Georgia (UGA) and the former
Georgia congressman&apos;s hometown of Milledgeville.

During their visit,&quot;Gold Eagle&quot;Sailors met with leadership figures
from the institute, while also taking the opportunity to meet with the
UGA gymnastics team and football coach.&quot;We were able to explore each other&apos;s service to the country while
delving into topics of history and leadership, and it proved to be a
great opportunity for our Sailors to interact with academic and athletic
leaders of such a large university,&quot;said Capt. Steve Koehler, Vinson&apos;s
executive officer.

While in Milledgeville, the Sailors conversed with the mayor and city
manager, while hearing actual stories from an acquaintance of Carl
Vinson. Afterward, they received a police escort to the Georgia Military
College where Vinson was once a student. From there, they ventured to
his two former homes and paid their respects at his final resting place.&quot;It&apos;s nice to meet people and hear stories about the person our ship is
named after,&quot;said Chief Navy Counselor (AW/SW) Jeffrey Sabia.&quot;You have
to do something extraordinary to have your name given to a ship, and
after learning about Carl Vinson, you really begin to understand how
extraordinary he was.&quot;Known as&quot;the father of the two-coast Navy,&quot;Vinson urged Congress to
build more ships when many felt it wasn&apos;t a priority. His perseverance
and dedication to building a stronger fleet continues to benefit America
and its Sailors around the world every day.&quot;Carl Vinson was an advocate for the Navy and its mission,&quot;said Sabia.&quot;He was a true patriot.&quot;USS Carl Vinson is currently undergoing its scheduled refueling complex
overhaul (RCOH) at Northrop Grumman Newport News shipyard. The RCOH is
an extensive yard period that all Nimitz-class aircraft carriers go
through near the mid-point of their 50-year life cycle.

During RCOH Carl Vinson&apos;s nuclear fuel will be replenished and the
ship&apos;s services and infrastructure will be upgraded to make her the most
state-of-the-art aircraft carrier in the fleet and prepare for another
25 years or more of service.

NNS081031-13. NAVSTA GTMO Sailors Get Career Management Advice

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Kimberly Williams, Naval
Station Guantanamo Bay Public Affairs

GUANTANAMO BAY, Cuba (NNS) -- Sailors from Naval Station (NAVSTA), Naval
Expeditionary Guard Battalion (NEGB), Joint Task Force (JTF) and other
tenant commands on Guantanamo Bay (GTMO)took advantage of the Career
Management Symposium (CMS) Oct. 22 - 24 at NAVSTA Bulkeley Hall.

Detailers and career management officials from Naval Personnel Command&apos;s
Center for Career Development (CCD) of Millington, Tenn., traveled to
GTMO to discuss subjects like billeting options and career management.&quot;In this symposium, Sailors learn things like what a chiefs selection
board looks at. I like to use this example because every junior Sailor
is on a similar track  they are trying to make chief or officer, so the
things they learn in the selection board briefing can help them to make
better informed decisions when selecting billets throughout their
career,&quot;said Senior Chief Aviation Electronics Technician (AW/SW)
Patrick Hosterman, AT lead detailer.&quot;I will let people select their orders and not try to force anything on
them. I give them the information they need to be successful in making
informed decisions for their careers, but ultimately its the Sailor&apos;s
decision [where he or she goes],&quot;said Hosterman.&quot;The most important thing I want Sailors to remember is that planning
for the future is very important in your career and in the detailing
process. Look at career-enhancing jobs vice location. It will make for a
better career.&quot;Sailors of all pay grades attended briefings and one-on-one detailing
sessions that outlined the benefits of advancement and a long-term
career in the Navy.
The symposium was organized by the GTMO command career counseling team.&quot;It&apos;s important to have symposiums like this one because it helps bring
big picture career into perspective,&quot;said Master-at-Arms 2nd Class
Desiree Rivers, assistant NAVSTA command career counselor.&quot;Sailors get
to see detailers face-to-face that they usually only talk to over the
phone and receive communication from them that is consistent to what we
[career counselors] have been telling them.&quot;Other topics covered during the week-long event included an officer
career management brief, enlisted community selection board brief, chief
petty officer leadership brief and a community brief for the medical corps.

NNS081031-12. Moneywise Speakers Tell Sailors to Save Now

By Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Jonathan Idle, Naval Air Station
Sigonella Public Affairs

SIGONELLA, Sicily (NNS) -- The host of the Public Broadcast System&apos;s&quot;Moneywise&quot;series, and a, Young America&apos;s financial coach and author,
spoke to service members and their families as part of&quot;Moneywise in the
Military&quot;tour at Naval Air Station Sigonella Oct. 27.

Kelvin Boston and Peter Bielagus&apos; visit to Sigonella was facilitated by
the Fleet&amp;Family Support Center as part of a European tour which
includes stops at installations in Souda Bay, Crete; Rota, Spain;
Naples, Aviano and Vicenza, all in Italy.

Bielagus began the seminar by explaining the importance of a paying off
credit card debt and dispelling rumors on the topic.&quot;One way to get your credit score up is to pay off credit card debt,&quot;Bielagus said.&quot;The faster you can pay it off, the faster your score
will go up. There is a rumor going around, and I hear this all the time,
&apos;Peter, in order to raise your credit score you actually have to have
some credit card debt.&apos; That is not true. I don&apos;t know where that rumor
came from.&quot;Bielagus explained that putting off financial planning and not building
your savings now is just a cycle which will continue to perpetuate itself.&quot;I need you to remember this one thing,&quot;he said.&quot;Start before you need
to start.&quot;He broke down budgeting into a three-step process.&quot;Tell me what you want,&quot;Bielagus said.&quot;Tell me what you don&apos;t want.
Tell me where your money is going. Then you&apos;re in a perfect position to
do your budget.&quot;After Bielagus spoke, Boston took center stage to discuss how each
person can become a millionaire while serving in the military.&quot;We&apos;ve been all around the world,&quot;Boston said.&quot;In every installation
we&apos;ve visited, in every ship we&apos;ve been on, at every base we&apos;ve visited
we&apos;ve found men and women serving their country who&apos;re now millionaires.&quot;Boston discussed how fear is driving the financial crisis back home
deeper into the hole.&quot;We have some fundamental economic issues back home that we have to deal
with, but what&apos;s compounding the problem is fear,&quot;he said.&quot;Fear in our
financial markets. Fear in our business markets. So, as a country we all
have to take this journey from financial fear to financial freedom.&quot;Boston explained to the audience that finances are not something you can
avoid.&quot;You may decide not manage your credit effectively. That&apos;s OK, but it
will follow you the rest of your life,&quot;Boston said.&quot;You may decide not
to own your own home or condominium or put a little money aside in a
thrift saving plan, but you will regret it for the rest of your life.
You may decide not to get your education while you&apos;re here in the
military or make sure your spouse gets their education, but that too you
will regret for the rest of your life. You may not decide to play the
wealth building game, but the game will still play you.&quot;For more news from Naval Air Station Sigonella, visit

NNS081031-07. Carl Vinson Combat Systems Begins Wave Guide Testing

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class (SW) Candice Villarreal, USS
Carl Vinson Public Affairs

NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (NNS) -- The USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) Combat Systems
Department is conducting its first wave guide tests in more than three
years, as the ship prepares to enter the final phases of its Refueling
Complex Overhaul (RCOH) at Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding.

The AN/SPS-43 and AN/SPS-67 wave guides, last operational in early 2005,
allow the safe, mission-essential transmission of radio frequency (RF)
signals throughout the ship.&quot;All of our radar equipment transmits radio frequency (RF) signals,
which, without wave guides, could potentially be harmful,&quot;said
Electronics Technician 3rd Class Jermaine Gordon.&quot;These guides are
conduits that ensure the safety of our crew, so they&apos;re very important
to us.&quot;The Nimitz-class aircraft carrier utilizes RF signals for numerous radar
functions on board, including air search, fire control, weathering,
navigation, communications and air traffic control applications at sea.&quot;This kind of testing will prove to be absolutely mission-critical when
we get underway,&quot;said Electronics Technician 1st Class (SW) Bradley
Stewart.&quot;Without the radars, we can&apos;t navigate or fly planes, and we can&apos;t
defend our ship from enemy threats. These tests are the backbone for
ensuring that all of our systems get back on line properly before we
head back out to sea.&quot;While the division is hard at work conducting cooling flushes and acid
washes to clean out the system in preparation for sea trials, some of
the fleet&apos;s newest Sailors are getting extensive hands-on, in-rate
training for the very first time.

According to Stewart, the entire combat systems team is committed to
ensuring that each Sailor in the division acquires the skills he or she
will need when the aircraft carrier returns to operational status in
support of America&apos;s maritime strategy.&quot;Right now we&apos;re maintaining and testing our equipment for the first
time since I&apos;ve been on board, so it&apos;s a big milestone for me,&quot;said
Gordon.&quot;I am actually putting my hands on the equipment now and seeing
it all get closer to becoming operational again every day. It&apos;s
fulfilling to be able to do what I signed up for, and I think we&apos;re all
excited about the fact that we&apos;re going to be out on the water soon.&quot;USS Carl Vinson is currently undergoing its scheduled refueling complex
overhaul (RCOH) at Northrop Grumman Newport News shipyard. The RCOH is
an extensive yard period that all Nimitz-class aircraft carriers go
through near the mid-point of their 50-year life cycle.

During RCOH Carl Vinson&apos;s nuclear fuel will be replenished and the
ship&apos;s services and infrastructure will be upgraded to make her the most
state-of-the-art aircraft carrier in the fleet and prepare for another
25 years or more of service.

NNS081031-05. PCU George H.W. Bush Sailors Chosen for STA-21

By Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Joel S. Kolodziejczak,
Pre-Commissioning Unit George H.W. Bush Public Affairs

NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (NNS) -- The Seaman to Admiral-21 (STA 21) program
results are out, and two Pre-Commissioning Unit (PCU) George H.W. Bush
(CVN 77) Sailors are trading in their enlisted stripes for officer khakis.

PCU Bush&apos;s Electronics Technician 2nd Class Jennifer E. Swanson and
Machinist&apos;s Mate 2nd Class Jacob T. Bush are two of 210 Sailors selected
Navywide for the STA-21 Commissioning Program, which allows enlisted
Sailors to become commissioned officers after completing a baccalaureate
degree. During this time, Sailors continue to receive their regular pay.&quot;Since I was seven and living in Atlanta, I wanted to be a pilot,&quot;Swanson said.&quot;I remember watching the planes at the airport and knew I
wanted to fly. I guess you could say I now have the chance to live my
dream.&quot;Swanson&apos;s studies start with a three-month refresher course to
reacclimate her to a school environment, followed by three months at the
Naval Science Institute as well as a three-year college program to
finish her degree in electrical engineering.&quot;The day I graduate I will be commissioned as a United States naval
officer,&quot;Swanson said. She begins flight training after graduation.&quot;I
feel that being an officer will put me in a position to make Sailor&apos;s
lives better and raise the standard of living.&quot;Bush joined the military three-and-a-half years ago with the goal of
making something of his life.&quot;I went to college but wasn&apos;t on the path I wanted to be, so I joined
the Navy to give me a better shot at reaching my goals,&quot;Bush said.&quot;I
have been selected as a core officer which will allow me to work just
about anywhere in the Navy.&quot;Bush said he had the full support of the command as well as his family.
His father obtained the rank of chief radiomen in seven years, and Bush
used to joke that he would make chief petty officer faster.

Bush said he had many interviews and believed his ability to make a good
impression during them went a long way toward being selected for STA-21.&quot;I had to write a one-page paper which told who I was, why I wanted to
be an officer as well as my strengths and weaknesses,&quot;Bush said.

The two Sailors will begin their training in February 2009 to become
naval officers.

The aircraft carrier is under construction at Northrop Grumman Newport
News Shipyard, Newport News, Va.

NNS081102-10. Vice Adm. Stockdale Honored at Naval Academy&gt;From U.S. Naval Academy Public Affairs

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (NNS) -- The U.S. Naval Academy dedicated a bronze statue
of former Vietnam prisoner of war and Medal of Honor recipient Vice Adm.
James B. Stockdale, Oct. 31, with the Secretary of the Navy, the
Honorable David C. Winter as keynote speaker.&quot;It would be difficult to imagine a better example of leadership,
courage and moral excellence than the example set by Vice Adm. James
Stockdale,&quot;said Winter.

Stockdale, a native of Abingdon, Ill., graduated from the Naval Academy
in 1947. On Sept. 9, 1965, Stockdale was the commanding officer of
Carrier Air Group Commander 16 (CAG-16). He catapulted from the deck of
USS Oriskany (CV/CVA-34) for a strike mission over North Vietnam. While
returning from the target area, Stockdale&apos;s A-4 Skyhawk was hit by
anti-aircraft fire. He ejected, breaking a bone in his back, and upon
landing in a small village, he badly dislocated his knee. His injuries
went untreated and eventually left him with a fused knee joint and a
very distinctive gait.

Stockdale was held in the infamous&quot;Hanoi Hilton,&quot;where he spent seven
years as the highest ranking naval officer and leader of American
resistance against North Vietnamese attempts to use prisoners for
propaganda purposes. Despite being kept in solitary confinement for four
years, in leg irons for two years, physically tortured more than 15
times, denied medical care, and malnourished, Stockdale organized a
system of communication and developed a cohesive set of rules governing
prisoner behavior.&quot;Admiral Stockdale was a great leader who built others up and never put
them down,&quot;said Ross Perot, a friend of Stockdale and a Class of 1953
Naval Academy graduate who donated the statue.

Stockdale was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Gerald Ford in
1976. A highly decorated naval officer, he wore 26 personal combat
decorations, including two Distinguished Flying Crosses, three
Distinguished Service Medals, two Purple Hearts, and four Silver Star
medals in addition to the Medal of Honor.&quot;Nobody wins the Medal of Honor. They earn it. He earned it the hard
way,&quot;said Perot, who selected Stockdale as his running mate during the
1992 presidential campaign.&quot;He earned the Medal of Honor for his
leadership by example and setting high standards for all the others who
served with him in prison.&quot;Stockdale retired from the Navy in 1978 after serving as the president
of the Naval War College. In 1979, the Secretary of the Navy established
the Vice Admiral Stockdale Award for Inspirational Leadership, presented
annually in both the Pacific and Atlantic fleets.

In 1998, the Secretary of the Navy authorized the founding of the Center
for the Study of Professional Military Ethics at the U.S. Naval Academy,
later renamed the Vice Admiral James B. Stockdale Center for Ethical
Leadership, with a mission&quot;to promote and enhance the ethical
development of current and future military leaders through education,
research and reflection.&quot;Stockdale, a member of the Navy&apos;s Carrier Hall of Fame, was the only
vice admiral in the history of the Navy to wear both aviator wings and
the Medal of Honor. In 2001, he was awarded the Naval Academy Alumni
Association Distinguished Graduate Award.&quot;If Admiral Stockdale were here with us today, I believe that it would
give him immense pride in seeing this gathering, and knowing that this
statue will play a role in guiding and inspiring future leaders in the
Navy and Marine Corps,&quot;said Winter.

Stockdale passed away in July 2005 and was laid to rest at the Naval
Academy Cemetery. Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm.
William Crowe and then Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Mike Mullen
delivered the eulogies. In May of this year, USS Stockdale (DDG 106) was
christened in his honor.

The U.S. 6th Fleet-led BSPC, scheduled to occur Nov. 10-16, is an annual
event to strengthen ongoing partnerships and increase interoperability
with Black Sea nations. A self-contained headquarters for the fleet and
task force commander, USS Mount Whitney (LCC/JCC 20) serves as the BSPC
underway training platform.

Sixty-five representatives from Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Estonia, Georgia,
Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Ukraine and the United
States will participate in the BSPC evolution this year. The at-sea
period includes workshops for helicopter control operations, junior
officer and noncommissioned officer development, interoperability
discussions, and an oil spill scenario. Additional topics to be covered
during the cruise are humanitarian assistance; maritime domain
awareness; navigation; rules of engagement; law of the sea; piracy;
counter narcotics; visit, board, search and seizure; and customs

NNS081103-04. San Antonio Sailor Promoted, Recognized for IA Service

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class (SW) Brian Goodwin, Iwo Jima
Expeditionary Strike Group Public Affairs

USS SAN ANTONIO, At Sea (NNS) -- A USS San Antonio (LPD 17) earned an
Army Achievement Medal and a promotion under the Combat Meritorious
Advancement Program (CMAP) to petty officer first class for his
performance while deployed to Afghanistan as an individual augmentee (IA).

Ship&apos;s Servicemen 1st Class (SW) Aaron Reid volunteered to fill an IA
billet assigned to Afghanistan Regional Security Integration Command 
West (ARSIC-W).&quot;I felt as if I needed a change,&quot;said Reid.&quot;I was approached by Chief
Storekeeper Edgar Feagins who told me the ship needed to provide an SH2
or SK2 for an IA assignment to Afghanistan. Being the only SH2 in the
command at the time, I volunteered to have my name submitted.&quot;Reid was required to complete preliminary training and multiple
screenings prior to his augmentation.&quot;Going IA requires you to do a lot of Navy E-Learning courses,&quot;stated
Reid.&quot;I also had to get a secret clearance and obtain medical approval
before leaving the ship.&quot;Fort Riley, Kansas, was the next stop in his preparation for IA.&quot;I was sent to Ft. Riley to receive embedded team training and some
combat training,&quot;stated Reid.&quot;We started our training with combat life
savers. This class went beyond basic first aid. You learned how to save
lives and how to give an IV to an injured solider.&quot;Reid&apos;s training with weapons caught the eye of his instructors.&quot;I learned pretty quick how to break down and reassemble an M240B
machine gun, M2 .50 cal, MK19 grenade launcher, and then my personal
weapons -- the M9 and M4,&quot;explained Reid.&quot;My instructors asked what I
did for the Navy. I immediately responded &apos;I wash clothes, cut hair and
sell candy bars,&apos; and we all laughed about it afterwards.&quot;Reid made an immediate impact upon his arrival to ARSIC-W.&quot;I stepped up and took charge of the section and became the department
leading petty officer,&quot;said Reid.&quot;I was in charge of making the sure
the mail, food and cargos were brought from Heret airport to Camp Stone,
as well as re-supplying our down-range teams.&quot;Within three weeks, Reid had earned his M923 5-ton cargo and M931
tractor-trailer licenses.&quot;I was soon taking supplies to our down-range Soldiers so that they
could complete their missions in supporting the Afghan Army and Police,&quot;said Reid.

Reid earned the Army Achievement Medal when he recovered a downed
up-armored Humvee that was believed to be unrecoverable in a mountainous
area.

Word of Reid&apos;s performance reached back to his command.&quot;He participated in over 150 combat missions, driving more than 6,000
miles in the ARSIC-W region and re-supplying over $5 million dollars in
material to ten foreign operating bases,&quot;said Cmdr. Kurt Kastner, San
Antonio&apos;s commanding officer.&quot;He even demonstrated calm leadership
under fire on at least two occasions, extracting wounded service members
from vehicles during convoy operations.&quot;Reid&apos;s performance earned him eligibility for the Navy&apos;s Combat
Meritorious Advancement Program (CMAP). The purpose of CMAP is to
advance Sailors in pay grades of E1-E5 as recognition of uncommon valor
and extraordinary deeds demonstrated while engaged in, or in direct
support of, combat operations.&quot;Petty Officer Reid took charge and went above and beyond,&quot;added Ship&apos;s
Serviceman 1st Class (SW) Cory Wallace, San Antonio&apos;s supply three
division leading petty officer.&quot;He demonstrated to the Army and the
Navy that his potential was unlimited.&quot;Reid commented on his IA assignment experience.&quot;IA billets need to be embraced and not overlooked,&quot;said Reid.&quot;If you
stay positive and work hard, it will help you become a leader and a
better person.&quot;San Antonio is deployed to the U.S. 5th Fleet Area of Operations to
conduct Maritime Security Operations (MSO). MSO helps develop security
in the maritime environment. From security arises stability that results
in global economic prosperity. MSO complements the counterterrorism and
security efforts of regional nations and seek to disrupt violent
extremists&apos; use of the maritime environment as a venue for attack or to
transport personnel, weapons or other material.

NNS081102-02. Safety Course Designed to Decrease Motorcycle Fatalities

By Patrick Gordon, U.S. Naval Academy Public Affairs

WASHINGTON (NNS) -- A motorcycle safety course held Oct. 21 in
Washington is part of a robust effort throughout the Department of the
Navy (DoN) to combat the increase in motorcycle-related accidents and
fatalities.

The DoN concern for military deaths in motorcycle accidents has been
shared by national media. A front page headline on CNN.com that same
month read,&quot;Motorcycles deadlier for Marines than Iraq combat.&quot;On Oct. 21, a group of active duty service members gathered at Naval
Support Facility Anacostia in Washington, with motorcycles, helmets and
a focus on staying safe and staying alive.&quot;I think it&apos;s great that the Navy&apos;s taking a big stand on teaching
people how to ride safe,&quot;said Machinist&apos;s Mate 1st Class (SS) Andrew
Wilkes, who attended the course.&quot;It should be good, especially with the
advanced classes, to get some of the people who are more experienced out
to hone their skills and become safer riders.&quot;According to the Naval Safety Center, nearly 60 DoN personnel died in
motorcycle accidents in fiscal year 2008, including 33 Sailors and 25
Marines. That number is up 49 percent from 2007. By comparison, a total
of 44 Sailors and 63 Marines died in Operation Enduring Freedom in the
past seven years, according to the Defense Manpower Data Center.

Just between Memorial Day and Labor Day, 50 military service members
died in motorcycle accidents alone. According to the Motorcycle Safety
Foundation, 94 percent of all motorcycle fatalities for the Navy
involved sport bikes. In an effort to save lives, the Basic Rider Course
(BRC), Experienced Rider Course, and Military Sport Bike Rider Course
are now required courses for all military and Department of Defense
motorcycle and sport bike riders.

At the BRC course at Anacostia, students learned the basics of how to
control a motorcycle, breaking and swerving techniques, and defensive
driving skills. Students spent part of the BRC learning in a classroom
before taking to the street, where instructors taught the students how
to operate their motorcycles safely in a controlled environment.&quot;It&apos;s fun to watch these guys actually learn something and be surprised
that they didn&apos;t know everything,&quot;said Vanessa Jones, a BRC instructor
with the Motorcycle Safety Foundation.

It is hoped that with proper training and increased awareness,
motorcyclists throughout the military can make the roads safer for
themselves and others. The courses are available at no cost throughout
the fleet, and are required for all authorized military riders on and
off base, and all DoD civilian riders who ride their motorcycles on base
or on duty.

More information about motorcycle safety programs and regulations is
available at the Naval Safety Center&apos;s Web site at http://www.safetycenter.navy.mil/ashore/motorvehicle/motorcycle/. For specific information about motorcycle safety courses in their areas,
Sailors can contact their commands&apos; safety office.

NNS081103-03. Iwo Jima ESG Sailors Take Advantage of Tax-Free Benefits

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class (SW) Michael Starkey, Iwo
Jima Expeditionary Strike Group Public Affairs

USS IWO JIMA, At Sea (NNS) -- Sailors with the Iwo Jima Expeditionary
Strike Group (ESG) have received more than $1 million in tax-free
selected re-enlistment bonuses (SRB) while deployed to the Navy&apos;s 5th
Fleet Area of Operations.

While deployed to a combat zone, the tax-free incentive on all pay is
just one of the benefits military personnel receive. Many Sailors in the
Iwo Jima ESG have already taken advantage of the tax-free opportunity.&quot;Our [Iwo Jima] total tax-free SRB so far is $420,757.65,&quot;said Chief
Navy Career Counselor (SW/AW) Mark D. Marshall, from the multi-purpose
amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima (LHD 7).&quot;More than 56 Sailors
re-enlisted tax-free so far, with an expectancy of 30 more while in the
tax-free zone.&quot;&quot;Re-enlisting while in a tax-free zone allows our Sailors to monetarily
take advantage of an opportunity that otherwise wouldn&apos;t exist if the
ship was not operating in a tax-free zone,&quot;continued Marshall.&quot;In and
of itself, the SRB program is a great incentive used to encourage
Sailors with critical skills and experience to &apos;stay Navy&apos;. In many
cases, a tax-free SRB is the determining factor in whether or not the
Sailor makes the Navy their &apos;employer of choice.&apos;&quot;Sailors can take advantage of re-enlisting early in order to start their
bonus in the tax-free zone.&quot;I chose to re-enlist for six years in the tax-free zone,&quot;said Aviation
Ordnanceman 2nd Class Timothy Dudley who is assigned to the security
division aboard Iwo Jima.&quot;I re-enlisted three months early to take
advantage of the benefits. I will receive half of my SRB upfront
tax-free and the other half as annual installments that are tax-free also.&quot;Choosing to re-enlist early can have its disadvantages, but often the
advantages will outweigh the disadvantages.&quot;I would definitely recommend re-enlisting tax-free as long as you&apos;re
within five to six months of the end of your enlistment,&quot;said
Information Systems Technician 2nd Class (SW) Christopher Farr.&quot;The
further you are from the end of your enlistment, the smaller the bonus.
Even though I lost $1,500 re-enlisting early, because it was tax-free, I
made more than I would have waiting until the last day and then
re-enlisting.&quot;Tax-free benefits is just one of various reasons Sailors choose to
continue their naval careers.&quot;I enjoy being in the Navy, and I like my job,&quot;said Dudley.&quot;I am
married and have a daughter on the way. With the uncertainty of the
economy, the Navy is the best way I can provide for them.&quot;The Iwo Jima ESG is deployed to the U.S. 5th Fleet Area of Operations to

NNS081102-08. BOXESG Readies for Deployment with Anti-Terrorism Exercise

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Jeff Hopkins, USS Boxer
Public Affairs

SAN DIEGO (NNS) -- USS Boxer (LHD 4), in conjunction with the ships of
Boxer Expeditionary Strike Group (BOXESG), participated in a two-day
force protection exercise (FPE) at Naval Base San Diego Oct. 27-28.

The FPE is one of several qualifications BOXESG must complete to become
certified for its upcoming deployment.

Conducted by Commander, U.S. 3rd Fleet, the FPE brings ships of BOXESG
together at one pier to simulate a foreign port visit. Each ship in
BOXESG maintains a ship&apos;s self-defense force (SSDF) to augment its
security force. The SSDF consists of volunteers from the ship&apos;s crew who
receive training in anti-terrorism and force protection measures and act
as the ship&apos;s ready defense team. Throughout the course of the exercise,
personnel acting as intruders attempted to penetrate the strike group&apos;s
defenses, testing the SSDF&apos;s readiness and ability to effectively defend
the ships against attack.&quot;The FPE is a test of the ESG&apos;s ability to construct a force protection
plan, execute it following programmed protection responses and
effectively implement the appropriate levels of force protection
conditions, from ...the lowest level of security, all the way to [the
highest],&quot;said Lt.j.g. Mike Rutland, Boxer&apos;s force protection officer.&quot;It is one of many requirements necessary to qualify the ESG for
deployment, and it&apos;s one of the most important preparations we undertake
as it tests our capability to stay safe in foreign territory.&quot;According to Rutland, the FPE also provides an opportunity to test
communication among the ships of BOXESG in an emergency situation.&quot;Anything can happen to Boxer or the other ships in the group,&quot;Rutland
said.&quot;If there&apos;s an attack on the USS Lake Champlain (CG 57), Boxer
should know about it not only for informational purposes but to let
other watchstanders know to keep an eye out for potential threats or
diversionary tactics. It allows us to keep not only ourselves safe but
also our fellow strike group shipmates.&quot;Throughout each day of the exercise, the BOXESG ships&apos; intercom systems
blared with reports of suspicious packages, potentially hostile small
boats approaching the ESG&apos;s ships to conduct surveillance, and
unauthorized people attempting to gain access to the ships with fake
identification. Thanks to basic and advanced security reaction force
training -- which includes anti-terrorism measures, vehicle and bag
inspection training and weapons qualification -- members of Boxer&apos;s SSDF
said they felt they were properly prepared to take on threats to their ship.&quot;We&apos;ve had a lot of training, both through classes and SSDF-specific
training, and I feel we&apos;re more than adequately prepared to protect our
ship,&quot;said Aviation Mechanic 1st Class (AW) Dominick Jordan, a member
of Boxer&apos;s SSDF.

During the exercise, the ships on the pier were receiving a large load
of supplies which added difficulty to the FPE.&quot;The additional activity on the pier certainly makes it harder on the
SSDF to discern threats, but it also adds a very real element to the
exercise, in that this scenario is one they&apos;ll likely encounter in a
real-world situation,&quot;Master-at-Arms 1st Class (SW) Jorge Schulz said.&quot;With all of the distractions going on with resupplying the ships and
maintenance, an intruder may try penetrating the ESG&apos;s defenses
unnoticed. This allows our Sailors to acclimate themselves to the busy
environment of a real port and effectually makes them a more prepared
security force.&quot;BOXESG is scheduled for more training exercises this fall to prepare for
its upcoming deployment.

BOXESG is comprised of Amphibious Squadron 5, the 13th Marine
Expeditionary Unit (MEU), USS Boxer (LHD 4), USS New Orleans (LPD 18),
USS Comstock (LSD 45), USS Chung Hoon (DDG 93), USCGC Boutwell (WHEC
719), USS Milius (DDG 69), USS Lake Champlain (CG 57), Helicopter Sea
Combat Squadron 21, Naval Beach Group 1, Assault Craft Unit 5 and 1,
Beach Master Unit 1 and Fleet Surgical Team 5.

The 13th MEU is comprised of Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 163
(Reinforced), Combat Logistics Battalion 13 and Battalion Landing Team 1/1.

NNS081101-02. Carter Hall Serves as Afloat Staging Base in Gulf

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Katrina Parker, Iwo Jima
Expeditionary Strike Group Public Affairs

USS CARTER HALL, At Sea (NNS) -- The amphibious dock landing ship USS
Carter Hall (LSD 50) is currently serving as an afloat forward staging
base (AFSB) in the North Arabian Gulf (NAG) as part of Combined Task
Force (CTF) 158.

AFSBs serve as landing platforms for both helicopters and small boats,
which allow coalition forces to conduct interaction patrols with dhows.&quot;The services that Carter Hall is providing are critical to coalition
efforts in Iraq,&quot;said Cmdr. Jeffrey Sinclair, Carter Hall&apos;s commanding
officer.&quot;Right now, we are not only contributing to the security of the
oil platforms and supporting the other warships in the area, but most
importantly, we are serving as a training platform for Iraqi Sailors and
Marines.&quot;Members of the Naval Transition Team (NaTT), based in Umm Qasr, Iraq,
and Maritime Expeditionary Security Squadron detachment embark Carter
Hall to help train Iraqi Sailors and Marines.

The NaTT consists of members from the U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard and
Royal Navy. They train, equip and mentor Iraqi mariners to eventually
assume the duties of the coalition to protect their sea-based
infrastructures.

Royal Navy Lt. John Bettles, the NaTT&apos;s operations officer serving
aboard Carter Hall, said working alongside Iraqis on a day-to-day basis
gives them additional knowledge on the customs and ways to overcome
language barriers.&quot;The personal interaction is extremely important,&quot;he said.&quot;We have the
opportunity to absorb cultural training that we may not have experienced
in a more structured training environment.&quot;The Maritime Expeditionary Security Squadron detachment serving aboard
Carter Hall also plays an important mission in the North Arabian Gulf.
Their mission is to protect the coalition and Iraqi boarding teams
during interaction patrols. The detachment is comprised of three
different units: Maritime Expeditionary Boat Detachment (MEBD) 211 and
411, deployed from Portsmouth, Va.; and U.S. Coast Guard Port Security
Unit (PSU) 309, deployed from Port Clinton, Ohio.

Lt. j.g. Nathaniel Holmes, the VBSS detachment&apos;s officer in charge, said
Carter Hall is a key player in achieving mission success.&quot;Carter Hall has played a vital role in helping conduct Maritime
Security Operations (MSO) in the North Arabian Gulf,&quot;he said.&quot;They
have adjusted to the extremely busy boat schedule, simultaneously
operating boats from the well deck and crane while conducting flight
operations.&quot;U.S. and coalition forces provide assistance to the Iraqi Navy defending
Iraq&apos;s major oil platforms. These terminals are significant sources of
Iraqi government revenue and contribute to approximately 80 percent of
Iraq&apos;s gross domestic product.

Sinclair said Carter Hall&apos;s Sailors are ready to perform any mission,
day or night.&quot;Carter Hall&apos;s success in simultaneously carrying out these varied
missions is only possible through the combined effects of the crew&apos;s
hard work and the ship&apos;s versatility,&quot;said Sinclair.&quot;As an amphibious
ship, Carter Hall has a well deck, a boat deck, a flight deck that is
capable of landing any helicopter. We also have a robust medical and
dental suite. These assets make the Carter Hall perfectly suited to
provide food, water, maintenance, communications, medical/dental care or
anything else that is required, night or day, by the other warships,
small boats or the oil platforms themselves.&quot;Carter Hall is deployed to the U.S. 5th Fleet Area of Operations to
conduct Maritime Security Operations (MSO). MSO help develop security in
the maritime environment. From security arises stability that results in
global economic prosperity. MSO complement the counterterrorism and
security efforts of regional nations and seek to disrupt violent
extremists&apos; use of the maritime environment as a venue for attack or to
transport personnel, weapons or other material.

Carter Hall is part of the Iwo Jima Strike Group.

NNS081102-06. Moneywise Tour Wraps Up, Experts Urge Sailors to Use Navy
Benefits

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SW/AW) Marc Rockwell-Pate,
Commander Navy Region Europe Public Affairs

NAPLES, Italy (NNS) -- The host of the award-winning PBS financial
series&quot;Moneywise&quot;and author of&quot;Who&apos;s Afraid to be a Millionaire,&quot;wrapped up a 14-day free financial advisory tour in the European region
that visited six military bases Oct. 18-31

As part of the Department of Defense&apos;s (DoD) financial education
initiative and readiness campaign, Kelvin Boston, along with Young
American Financial Coach Peter Bielagus, author of&quot;Getting Loaded: Get
Ready. Get Set. Get Rich,&quot;toured military bases to advise service
members on how to protect themselves from identification theft and
improve their credit scores.

Through the use of PowerPoint slides, video clips and personal
experiences, Boston and Bielagus reached more than 1,500 Sailors,
military employees and their family members throughout the European region.&quot;I have tremendous respect for all our U.S. military members,&quot;said
Boston during an interview in Rota, Spain.&quot;The least I can do to show
my appreciation is offer some guidance and advise to them in the area of
my expertise, money. If I can open one Sailor&apos;s or family&apos;s eyes and
show them an efficient and better way to manage their money, then I feel
I have done my job.&quot;While on the road, the team visited a variety of installations in
Europe, including; Army installation Camp Ederle in Vicenza, Italy;
Aviano Air Base, Aviano, Italy; Naval Support Activity, Naples, Italy;
Naval Station, Rota, Spain; Naval Air Station Sigonella, Italy and Naval
Support Activity Souda Bay, Greece.

During the tour, Boston and Bielagus emphasized the importance of
financial awareness and the financial tools Sailors have readily
available, including; command financial specialists (CFS), military
benefits and investing in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP).&quot;These benefits can help you become more financially successful,&quot;said
Boston.

Personnel Specialist 1st Class (SW) Alfredo Perez, a CFS in Rota, said
the information he received was educational and easy to understand.&quot;The presentations really opened my eyes,&quot;said Perez.&quot;I learned that
everyone here has the ability to save money regardless of what is going
on in their lives right now. I know now that every little bit helps, and
I can use that frame of mind and perspective to guide the Sailors under
me and better do my job as the command CFS.&quot;The Moneywise events also emphasized to Sailors the importance of
monitoring credit-card expenditures and the value of saving through
programs like TSP.&quot;I learned a lot about my credit report and score,&quot;said Engineman First
Class (SW) Brian Lawrenz during an interview at NSA Naples.&quot;I also
learned how effective the Thrift Savings Plan can be and how easy it is
to enroll.&quot;Boston added that although the U.S economy is in a lull, military
members can still use the current financial situation to their advantage.&quot;Be concerned about the financial problems back home but do not panic,&quot;said Boston.&quot;The market is very low. Use this time as an opportunity to
improve your credit, pay off debts and save money. The more financially
fit you are when you return back to the U.S., the better you can serve
your country and become financially stable.&quot;The Moneywise tour is part of the DoD&apos;s initiative to promote financial
readiness education. The programs are designed to help service members
and their immediate families build wealth through reducing debt and
establishing savings goals. Financial readiness is considered an
integral part of overall readiness personnel need to accomplish the DoD
mission.

For more information about the DoD&apos;s financial readiness campaign and
financial education initiative, contact a command financial specialist.

NNS081102-05. Sailors Have Resources to Boost Professional, Personal
Development

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Eddie Harrison, Fleet Public
Affairs Center Det. Europe

VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (NNS) -- The Center for Personal and Professional
Development (CPPD) offers educational services worldwide and continues
with the goal to strengthen leadership and expand educational services
within the Navy.

While in the Navy, Sailors have many opportunities to excel, to increase
not only their professional skills but also some basic skills for a
balanced personal life.

These opportunities are, in part, provided by CPPD. The command was
established in 2002 to support the Chief-of-Naval-Operations-directed&quot;Revolution in Training&quot;and to focus on the continuous personal
development of Sailors throughout their careers by providing education
and training that builds personal, professional and leadership skills.&quot;As you go through your career, we have material to make you the best
possible Sailor out in the fleet,&quot;said Capt. John Picker, commanding
officer for CPPD.&quot;We want the best leaders possible, and it all begins
with character development and foundation.&quot;The CPPD offers various programs to include leadership, alcohol
awareness, instructor training and training for new Navy career counselors.

One of the many programs offered is the Voluntary Education (VOLED)
program. The VOLED provides Sailors with the ability to earn a college
degree through the assistance of the Navy College Office. The VOLED
program is supported by approximately 52 Navy colleges worldwide and 30
schools who have agreed to partner with the Navy.&quot;The Navy College gives you the advantage to use your military credits
and allows you to complete that degree in a shorter amount of time,&quot;said Director of the Navy&apos;s Volunteer Education Program, Mary Redd-
Clary.&quot;Any course you take, whether it&apos;s one class or more, no one can
take it away from you. You&apos;ve got it forever.&quot;Earning a degree while in the Navy can help in the advancement of a
Sailor&apos;s Navy career. When Sailors earn an associates degree, they are
credited two points for advancement. When a bachelor&apos;s degree is earned,
they are credited four points toward the advancement test.

CPPD also offers the Navy College Program for Afloat College Education.
This program is for students who want to continue their educations while
at sea. Another program is the United Services Military Apprenticeship
Program, aimed to provide Sailors the opportunity to learn the civilian
equivalency of their Navy jobs while on active duty.&quot;All of these programs have a common purpose geared towards
development,&quot;said Picker.&quot;We don&apos;t make Sailors, we make them better.&quot;For more news from Center for Personal and Professional Development,

NNS081102-07. Essex Departs Subic Bay

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Greg Johnson, USS Essex
Public Affairs

SOUTH CHINA SEA (NNS) -- The forward-deployed amphibious assault ship
USS Essex (LHD 2) departed Subic Bay, Republic of the Philippines, Oct.
30 after completing this year&apos;s Amphibious Landing Exercises (PHIBLEX)
and Talon Vision (TV).

The three-day port visit was an opportunity for Sailors to experience
Filipino culture, backload Marines of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit
(MEU) and conduct two community friendship projects.&quot;I&apos;m extremely grateful for our gracious hosts,&quot;said Capt. Brent
Canady, commanding officer of Essex.&quot;The crew always enjoys giving
something back to the local community during our port visits. Through
our coordination with the great citizens of the Philippines and the
nongovernment organizations, we were able to do just that by providing a
small amount of support for the needs of both the New Cabalan Elementary
School and the Social Development Center for Girls.&quot;Nearly 100 Sailors visited the New Cabalan Elementary School and the
Social Development Center for Girls in Olongapo City to participate in
the projects. Sailors helped paint the school&apos;s production stage, handed
out backpacks and other school supplies and spent the rest of the day
interacting with the children.&quot;These kind of humanitarian projects are very important for two
reasons,&quot;said Lt. Jason Rochester, a chaplain aboard Essex.&quot;First, it
shows the host nation that we care about them and that we want to help
support them. It also gives our Sailors an opportunity to give back and
to realize that there are many people out there who are not as fortunate.&quot;Those who volunteered at the social development center painted and
constructed new bed frames for the girls.&quot;I had a great time,&quot;said Hospital Corpsman 2nd Class (SW/AW) James
Hubbs.&quot;The kids seemed to have a great time also. It&apos;s really good to
get out here and do something like this and hopefully let people realize
that we&apos;re trying to do some good.&quot;The visit also included the backload of more than 1,200 31st MEU Marines
and 31 aircraft, including AH-1Z Super Cobra, UH-1N Huey, CH-46E Sea
Knight, CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopters and AV-8B Harrier jet aircraft.
In addition, Marines also backloaded 71 pieces of rolling stock, 252
containers of break-bulk and over 100 ship pallets.&quot;It really takes a lot of work to get everything back on board,&quot;said
Marine Gunnery Sgt. Jose Alvarez, ESSEX&apos;s welldeck combat cargo
assistant.&quot;Being able to coordinate the movement of so much equipment
is quite an accomplishment for these guys.&quot;The visit also gave Sailors a chance to rest and relax while enjoying
the local culture. Essex&apos;s Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR)
department offered various tours, including everything from a jungle
survival training excursion to a fun-filled day with indigenous sea life
at a local water park.&quot;We really try to design our tours to get our Sailors acquainted with
the culture of the various places we visit,&quot;said Mick Hultz, Essex&apos;s
afloat recreation coordinator.&quot;The Philippines has such a unique
experience to offer, and it&apos;s encouraging to see so many Sailors eager
to get out and see the country.&quot;According to Marine Lance Corporal Estle Reed, an MWR tour guide for the
Mall of Asia tour, seeing the Subic Bay area was a culturally enriching
experience.&quot;It was a really good time,&quot;said Reed.&quot;I got a chance to learn about
some of the history and the architecture of the Philippines, and it was
absolutely amazing. I would definitely look forward to coming back.&quot;Essex is the only forward-deployed amphibious assault ship and serves
Task Force 76, the Navy&apos;s only forward-deployed amphibious force. Task
Force 76 is headquartered at White Beach Naval Facility Okinawa, Japan,
with an operating detachment in Sasebo, Japan.

NNS081102-13. Truman Sailors Gain Insight on Personal Health, Safety,
Financial Matters

By Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Daron Street

USS HARRY S TRUMAN (NNS) -- USS Harry S. Truman&apos;s (CVN 75) safety
department hosted a health and safety fair Sept. 29 at the Callahan
Fitness Center on Norfolk Naval Shipyard base.

The event provided an opportunity for Sailors to receive information
about programs available to them through the Navy and the surrounding
community to provide both physical and professional help.

Cmdr. Pat LaCore, Truman&apos;s safety officer, explained this fair was one
way to give Sailors insight about their options for everything from
Morale, Welfare and Recreation to the commissary and more.&quot;We&apos;re just trying to give the Sailors a means of acquiring this
information all in one place,&quot;LaCore said.&quot;If the Sailors are
interested in something but they don&apos;t really have the time to go and
research a particular business or program, then we&apos;re bringing these
things to them so they can gather a lot of safety and health information
at once.&quot;&quot;Today is a day that we set aside so everyone from the ship can come by
and receive information on everything from motorcycle safety to personal
hygiene,&quot;Damage Controlman 2nd Class Alex Daniels said.&quot;Sometimes
people get so caught up with everything that&apos;s going on in their
everyday lives that they may become complacent.&quot;These are things that if you don&apos;t take time out to know about them you
may miss out on programs available that would be beneficial to them.&quot;Sailors were offered information from various organizations such as the
Red Cross, Navy Federal Credit Union, Fleet and Family Support Center
and other Navy and community groups.

A representative from www.turbotap.org, which helps Sailors with
retirement benefits and the transition to the civilian world after the
Navy, offered Sailors information about the defense department program.
The Virginia Department of Transportation provided Sailors information
on hurricanes, hurricane evacuation routes and procedures to evacuate
Hampton Roads.&quot;We hope the Sailors absorb some of this information for their benefit,&quot;LaCore said.&quot;A lot of these Navy-based and community programs aren&apos;t
being used to their full capacity, and we just hope that the Sailors
take advantage of the things that are there to help them.&quot;For more news from USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75), visit

NNS081103-05. Bataan Sailors Achieving a Culture of Fitness

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SW/AW) Jeremy L. Grisham,
USS Bataan Public Affairs

NORFOLK (NNS) -- The crew aboard the multipurpose amphibious assault
ship USS Bataan (LHD5) finished out the month of October by completing
their fall 2008 Physical Fitness Assessment (PFA).

Nearly 1,000 Sailors from Bataan demonstrated their physical readiness
at the Naval Station Norfolk parade field and gym.

In recent years, the addition of the elliptical machine and stationary
bike have given Sailors additional options to complete the cardio
portion of the PFA, as well as the standard run on a track or treadmill,
or the swim.&quot;I use the elliptical machine for my cardio portion,&quot;said Boatswain&apos;s
Mate Seaman Kimberly Usry.&quot;It&apos;s the machine I use daily when I work
out, so it just made me feel a little more comfortable using it.&quot;With the Navy&apos;s emphasis on a culture of fitness and Sailors being
provided a larger range of choices in completing their PFA, the failure
rate has dropped and has caught the eye of Navy leadership.&quot;Navy PFA failures have decreased more than 50 percent over the past
four years. We&apos;re really seeing a change in culture and change in
lifestyle,&quot;said Rear Adm. Daniel P. Holloway, director, Manpower,
Personnel, Training and Education, N13.&quot;Better fitness ultimately leads
to better quality of life, better performance and better readiness.&quot;Bataan&apos;s fail rate for the spring 2008 PFA was 1 percent, compared to
the Navy&apos;s average of 2.3 percent. The numbers haven&apos;t been calculated,
but the trend is expected to continue.&quot;Bataan Sailors have very high standards, not only in their physical
fitness, but on a professional level,&quot;said Bataan&apos;s Command Master
Chief Storekeeper (SW/AW) James N. Stuart II.&quot;I wouldn&apos;t expect
anything less from our Sailors.&quot;Bataan is the fifth ship of the Navy&apos;s Wasp-class ships. She was
commissioned Sept. 20, 1997, and is the second U.S. Navy warship to bear
the name. CVL-29 was an Independence-class light aircraft carrier that
was commissioned in November 1943. After serving in both World War II
and the Korean conflict, CVL-29 was decommissioned in 1954.

By Walter T. Ham IV, Naval Base San Diego Public Affairs

SAN DIEGO (NNS) -- The Kiwanis International Club honored Naval Base San
Diego&apos;s (NBSD) Sailor of the Quarter at their luncheon in downtown San
Diego Oct. 28.

NBSD Command Career Counselor NCCS(SW/AW) Robert D. Calloway, from
Atlanta, introduced Sailor of the Quarter Master-at-Arms 2nd Class
Garrett A. Vargas, who was then recognized by the Kiwanis Club.&quot;It is a very humbling experience to be recognized for my work and
achievements,&quot;said Vargas, a San Diego native,&quot;But most of all, it
makes me proud to know that my hometown and country supports what we
service members do.&quot;NBSD Commanding Officer Capt. Ricky L. Williamson said organizations
like Kiwanis International help the Navy better support the fleet, the
fighter and the family.&quot;I applaud the Kiwanis for what they do for our community, our base and
our Sailors,&quot;said Williamson.&quot;Petty Officer Vargas and Senior Chief
Calloway are outstanding representatives for Naval Base San Diego
because they personify the hard work done here daily. The Kiwanis have
my heartfelt thanks for taking the time to welcome and honor these great
Americans.&quot;Supporting 49 ships, more than 120 tenant commands and more than 35,000
service members and civilian employees, NBSD is home to the majority of
the Pacific Fleet&apos;s surface combatants, all of the Navy&apos;s west coast
amphibious ships and a variety of Coast Guard and Military Sealift
Command vessels.

NNS081103-01. USS Harry S. Truman Sends Sailors to All-Navy Boxing Camp

By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SW) Heather Weaver, USS
Harry S. Truman Public Affairs

USS HARRY S. TRUMAN (NNS) -- Sailors from USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75)
will attend the All-Navy Boxing Training Camp in December after fighting
their way to the top 18 of more than 50 competitors at Naval Amphibious
Base Little Creek&apos;s boxing mini-camp.

Those selected include: Aviation Ordnanceman 3rd Class Robert Flournoy,
Yeoman Seaman Brandon Tucker and Store Keeper Seaman (SW) Anthony Aguilar.

Once they arrive at the camp in December, the Sailors will compete for
one of eight potential spots on the All-Navy team. Those who make the
team will then compete in the Armed Forces Championships at Fort
Huachuca, Ariz., in February.

Flournoy, who is part of Truman&apos;s weapons department, said he went to
the camp with a goal of performing to his best ability. He said now his
goal is to continue progressing toward a professional career.&quot;I went in there and learned right away that I had to relax and use
everything I knew I had,&quot;Flournoy said.&quot;I did everything I could, and
they just kept asking me to come back.&quot;Tucker said he went to the camp with few expectations but knew he was
meant to be there the moment he stepped into the ring.&quot;I kept myself cool, stayed in the middle of the ring and controlled the
pace of the fights,&quot;Tucker said.&quot;We all performed in rare form for the
entire camp. Flournoy almost knocked someone out the first day.&quot;If they are chosen as All-Navy team representatives, the Sailors will go
on to compete in nationals after the Armed Forces Championships.

All-Navy Boxing coach Kevin Ludwig said in a previous interview that the
camp is just the first step in bringing Navy boxing back to the forefront.&quot;Navy boxing has been struggling for a while,&quot;Ludwig said,&quot;and that&apos;s
why we&apos;re here, to get the word out.&quot;He said boxing is a Navy tradition, and although it has recently
faltered, it is on a rise back to the top.&quot;Boxing and the Navy go hand-in-hand; they always have,&quot;Ludwig said.&quot;Even though, we&apos;ve kind of gotten away from that tradition over the
years, I think we&apos;re on our way back. This camp proves that.&quot;Flournoy said Truman&apos;s Sailors will have an advantage in the climb to
the top because they will have each other for support and encouragement.&quot;It makes it so much better to have people from the ship in this with
me,&quot;Flournoy said.&quot;Tucker and Aguilar and I all trained together
before, and I can be comfortable and be myself around them. We will push
each other and be honest with each other. We always do, and we always
are. We all train together, and we will go that extra mile together.&quot;As the Sailors head to the first leg of the All-Navy Camp in December,
their one request is that Sailors aboard Truman continue to support them.&quot;Anyone who was here with us on cruise knows how hard we worked to get
to this point,&quot;Tucker said.&quot;They watched us, rooted for us, cheered
for us  we need everyone to continue that trend and we will go out
there and represent [Truman] the best way we can.&quot;For more news from USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75), visit

NNS081102-12. Peleliu Returns from Deployment with Friends, Family on Board&gt;From USS Peleliu Public Affairs

PEARL HARBOR (NNS) -- Sailors and Marines aboard USS Peleliu (LHA 5)
welcomed more than 250 friends and family members for a&quot;tiger cruise&quot;as the ship departed Naval Station Pearl Harbor Oct. 29, following a
four-day port visit.

The term &apos;tigers&apos; is used to describe the guests of crew members who
take part in these types of orientation cruises throughout the fleet.

A total of 266 tigers joined the crew of Peleliu for the final leg of
its 2008 deployment as the ship begins the more than 2,000-mile final
trek toward its homeport of San Diego. Removing their official Peleliu
command ball caps and standing at attention, tigers joined the Sailors
and Marines to render honors to the USS Arizona Memorial as the ship
pulled out of Pearl Harbor.

Tigers, Sailors and Marines who gathered on the flight deck also got a
history lesson as a Sailor who works at the Arizona Memorial narrated
the history and pointed out landmarks of the naval base that played such
a key role in World War II.&quot;It&apos;s pretty hard to describe, but it&apos;s an honor for all of us to be
here, and it&apos;s pretty amazing to be a part of this history,&quot;said Seaman
Shawn Armstrong from Naval Station Pearl Harbor&apos;s Arizona Memorial
Detachment who narrated the history of Pearl Harbor for the tigers and
crew as ship departed.&quot;Being able to narrate the history of this harbor
during the transit is an honor for me, and I&apos;m happy I was asked to do it.&quot;During the transit back to homeport, the tigers eat, sleep and join
Peleliu Sailors and Marines from the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit
(MEU) in experiencing life at sea aboard the amphibious assault ship.

According to Lt. Cmdr. Steve Audelo, Peleliu&apos;s tiger cruise coordinator,
the highlights of the tiger cruise are the damage control Olympics,
weapons demonstrations and flight operations. Numerous tours of
different parts of the ship will also be available to tigers of all ages.&quot;My favorite part is seeing the excitement from a tiger when they
experience something for the first time,&quot;said Audelo.&quot;A tiger cruise is a rare opportunity for family and friends to see
firsthand operations aboard a naval warship,&quot;added Audelo.&quot;It is often
hard to fully describe what exactly it is we do on board Peleliu, and
there is no better experience than actually being here.&quot;Tigers said they are enjoying the opportunity to see what their friends
and family members do on a daily basis.&quot;I feel like I&apos;m really experiencing the Navy,&quot;said Taylor Prell, the
father of Aviation Electronics Technician 2nd Class (AW) Jordan Prell
who is assigned to Peleliu&apos;s aircraft intermediate maintenance
department. Prell brought two tigers aboard for the return trip, his
father and grandfather, Fred Torres.

Peleliu is the flagship of the Peleliu Expeditionary Strike Group
(PELESG) which left San Diego May 4 for a scheduled deployment.

NNS081102-11. USS Kidd First Destroyer to Employ Improved Gun System

By Ensign Alexis F. Steele, USS Kidd Public Affairs

PACIFIC OCEAN (NNS) -- USS Kidd (DDG 100) conducted the first firing of
the Mark 38 (Model 2) 25mm Machine Gun System (MGS) from a guided
missile destroyer Oct. 9 during multi-ship live firing exercises off the
coast of Southern California.

Coordinated by Destroyer Squadron (DESRON) 21, the exercise employed
ships and their embarked helicopters to simulate an escalating surface
threat environment requiring the use of main gun systems as well as
minor-caliber defenses.

Following strafing runs by MH-60Rs helicopters from Helicopter Maritime
Strike Squadron (HSM) 71, Kidd and USS Preble (DDG 88) engaged ex-tug
YFRT-520 with their five-inch gun systems and small arms fire before
Kidd fired the Mark 38, achieving numerous hits at extended ranges.&quot;The Mark 38 Mod. 2 performed beyond expectations. Video from the
optical sights indicated that the 25mm rounds were consistently on
target at ranges beyond the capability of manually-aimed minor caliber
weapons,&quot;said Capt. Kerry Gilpin, commander, DESRON 21.

The Mark 38 Mod 2 is already installed on many guided missile cruisers,
providing several tactical advantages over its predecessor. Compared
with the manually trained and aimed model 1, the model 2 provides a
stabilized, optically sighted minor caliber gun system that improves hit
potential against all threats, particularly small and fast maneuvering
targets. It also adds a double ammunition feed system, enabling the
operator to switch between two different ammunition types at will.

The dedicated sensor package includes a day-use electro-optical
magnified camera, forward-looking infrared camera and eyesafe laser
rangefinder. These sights help to ensure 360-degree coverage for surface
contact identification, night vision and periscope detection.

Cmdr. Chuck Good, Kidd&apos;s commanding officer, is impressed with the
initial performance, ease of use and low maintenance requirements thus far.&quot;We like it. Seeing how effective it was during the firing exercise
boosted the crew&apos;s confidence in the lethality of our defensive
systems,&quot;said Good.&quot;We feel a lot better preparing to deploy knowing
that we now have a solid close-in anti-surface defense.&quot;USS Kidd is currently participating in a Composite Training Unit
Exercise with the John C. Stennis Carrier Strike Group in preparation
for her maiden deployment.

NNS081102-09. Peleliu&apos;s Master Helmsmen Keep Ship on Course

By Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class (SW) Jason Thompson, USS
Peleliu Public Affairs

USS PELELIU, At sea (NNS) -- Seamen aboard USS Peleliu (LHA 5) are
trusted with great responsibility when the ship is involved in
restricted maneuvering evolutions such as anchoring, conducting an
emergency breakaway during a replenishment at sea, or when pulling in
and out of a port like Pearl Harbor Oct. 29.

Among the crew of more than 1,000 Sailors, Seaman Jacob Delgadillo,
Seaman Tony Nguyen, and Seaman Jesse Adams are the only qualified master
helmsmen aboard Peleliu. The three are entrusted to drive the Iron
Nickel any time the black ball-diamond-ball day shapes go up the yard
arm, including during Peleliu&apos;s departure from Pearl Harbor.&quot;We&apos;re on the helm for sea-and-anchor details, and we&apos;re entrusted to do
port and starboard twists,&quot;said Delgadillo.&quot;We&apos;re up there for
underway replenishments when we have to maintain 180 feet of distance
between us and the other ship. Sometimes that means steering in
half-degrees.&quot;According to Delgadillo, becoming a master helmsman starts with the
basics. Deck seamen and quartermasters traditionally man the wheel and
start with basic helmsman training and standing about 20 hours of watch
under instruction. Then, if a Sailor shows promise or an aptitude for
the helm, the other master helmsmen begin to train him.&quot;We also drive during general quarters,&quot;said Nguyen.&quot;We know that the
conning officers and helm safety officers trust us because we take what
we do a little more seriously.&quot;According to Nguyen, master helmsmen are not simply selected because
they&apos;re good at their jobs. He said that it takes a strong sense of
focus and a calm approach when havoc breaks loose in order to be a
master helmsman.&quot;If something happens, it&apos;s important to tune everything out,&quot;said
Nguyen.&quot;It&apos;s just you and the helm. Start breathing deep and focus, and
everything gets slow.&quot;Delgadillo also said it takes a lot of inner strength to take the helm
under stressful conditions.&quot;I believe that when everything gets crazy and everything gets really
fast and everyone is yelling, it&apos;s important to find the one voice you
need to listen to, the one set of orders, and go from there,&quot;said
Delgadillo.

Peleliu&apos;s three master helmsmen can be easily identified by their bright
yellow hats, but they say it&apos;s not about getting recognition.&quot;You get some recognition, but it&apos;s about holding yourself to a higher
standard,&quot;said Nguyen.&quot;When you hold yourself to a higher standard so
do the people around you.&quot;Peleliu is the flagship of the Peleliu Expeditionary Strike Group
(PELESG) which left San Diego May 4 on a scheduled deployment.

NNS081102-04. Locals Catch Unique Opportunity to Ride Waves at Point Magu

By Jeana Diacono, Naval Base Ventura County Public Affairs

NAVAL BASE VENTURA COUNTY POINT MUGU, Calif. (NNS) -- The first surf
competition at Naval Base Ventura County (NBVC) Point Mugu, which was
open to the public, kicked off Oct. 25.

USS Tarawa LHA 1 Senior Chief Postal Clerk Jeffrey Easson has the
historic honor of being the first military men&apos;s winner in the inaugural
Point Mugu surf contest at NBVC.

Some say the event can be called nothing less then a huge success,
partly due to the fact that this was the first time the surfing beach at
Point Mugu was open to the public. Approximately 1,200 visitors watched
as 131 participants came out to test these rare waves.&quot;This event truly resonated with the public and had a significant
image-enhancing effect,&quot;said Capt. Brad Conners, NBVC commanding
officer.&quot;The Navy needs to take every opportunity to create favorable
conditions for the local community to connect to the base and to take
personal pride in the base&apos;s mission, people and their contribution to
national security. Surfing, like other open events we do on base, is one
proven way to do this.&quot;The Point Mugu beach faces more in a south direction rather then a west
direction which gives it that special, one-of-a-kind wave. This unique
wave breaks differently and a lot larger then most waves along the coast.&quot;I felt pretty good out there, and the conditions were phenomenal,&quot;said
Easson.&quot;I have surfed quite a few waves in California, and there really
isn&apos;t a place that breaks like Point Mugu. We were truly lucky to get a
great south swell to coincide with the event.&quot;Other contestants felt the same.&quot;This is just one of the best spots on the California coast, and the
fact that the military let us in here is pretty special because most
people have to have a friend to get in here,&quot;said Charles McMahon,
participant in the men&apos;s open.&quot;It is one of the best beach breaks in
California, so I think everyone wants to be here.&quot;The crowd had plenty to cheer for with 12 heats for the men&apos;s open
alone. Each heat was set up with six competitors limited to 15 minutes
per heat. The competition started off with the largest division
competing first which was the men&apos;s open, followed by the junior boys
(under 17), body board, women&apos;s open and military men&apos;s. The start and
finish of each heat was signaled by the blow of an air horn. In order to
tell the participants apart, they took turns wearing different colored
rash guards.

Easson was stationed at Port Hueneme 1996-1999 with Naval Mobile
Construction Battalion 40 and surfed the area.&quot;When I wasn&apos;t on deployment I was surfing Point Mugu as much as
possible and even being a regular foot [surfing with my left foot
forward] it was by far my favorite wave,&quot;said Easson.

Despite having surfed at Point Mugu before, Easson was still a little
nervous.&quot;I guess it is positive nervousness, and once the horn sounds to start
the heat you are pretty much focused on catching waves,&quot;said Easson.&quot;I
think it is the five minutes prior to your heat starting that can be the
most nerve-racking. The waves were pretty much how I remember them --
Hollow and powerful. Definitely not a beginner&apos;s wave and you have to
paddle into the waves early or you&apos;re pretty much guaranteed to be
pitched over the falls.&quot;Feeling the same nervousness was the third place military winner,
Construction Electrician 1st Class Terence Juergens of Underwater
Construction Team 2 Port Hueneme. As a long-time surfer of Point Mugu he
thought the contest would be a lot of fun.&quot;It is definitely butterflies in your stomach because it is a
competition,&quot;noted Juergens.&quot;When a good wave comes your way and you
are able to perform, it is a great feeling. You only have a few minutes
to catch a certain amount of waves, and you get a little bit of nerves.
It&apos;s still a lot of fun, but you definitely get a little nervous.&quot;All starts were &apos;beach starts&apos; which means the competitors started on
the beach instead of the other option of &apos;water starts&apos; where the surfer
paddles to the surf zone and begins there. The finals were 20 minutes,
and each surfer had a maximum 10 waves with judges scoring their top two
waves.

The top three winners for each division received a trophy and a
sponsored prize. The men&apos;s open received a $500 cash prize; the military
men&apos;s received a high-tech custom surfboard from Proctor Surfboards
valued at $850, while other winners received gift certificates ranging
from $250 to $50, skateboards and backpacks. All participants received a
special edition event t-shirt and a free lunch.&quot;I am pretty excited to be the inaugural military winner,&quot;Easson said.&quot;My entry was pretty spur-of-the-moment, but I&apos;m glad I made the drive
north to be a part of the event. I&apos;m just still happy I can compete
considering I&apos;m getting a little older, go figure.&quot;The 2009 Point Mugu Surf Contest is scheduled for Aug. 22 and should
draw an even larger crowd.&quot;The fact that the [commanding officer] of the base was totally on board
and 100 percent supportive was great,&quot;said Easson.&quot;The positive
community relations between Oxnard/Port Hueneme/Ventura generated from
this event was significant, and with the announcement of next year&apos;s
contest on Aug. 22 which is smack dab in the middle of the south swell
surf season it just gets better.&quot;I&apos;m sure the contest is going to be a bigger event next year and, since
I will be going to shore duty in San Diego early next year I should be
around to participate.&quot;For more news from Naval Base Ventura County, visit

NNS081102-03. Bush&apos;s Bridge Team Coming Together with Historic Qualification

By Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Nicholas Hall, Pre-Commissioning
Unit George H.W. Bush

NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (NNS) -- The engineering department auxiliaries
officer aboard Pre-Commissioning Unit (PCU) George H.W. Bush (CVN 77)
qualified as the aircraft carrier&apos;s first underway officer of the deck
(OOD) Sept. 29.&quot;It feels great,&quot;Lt. Cmdr. William Smith said.&quot;Qualifying as an OOD
underway is a significant accomplishment, and any officer would be proud
to wear a George H.W. Bush OOD ball cap.&quot;The OOD training process was put together by PCU Bush&apos;s navigator, Cmdr.
Mike Walls, while the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier is under
construction at Northrop Grumman Newport News Shipyard.

For both Walls and Smith, a fully qualified bridge team is crucial to
the success of PCU Bush.&quot;The OOD manages the bridge watchstanders to ensure that the ship is
navigated safely and to ensure that we are completing our assigned
mission,&quot;Smith said.&quot;The importance of qualifying is to support the ship&apos;s watch bill at
sea. Strong bridge teams are critical on any ship, in particular a ship
that is brand new, going to sea for the first time,&quot;Smith added.

Walls chose four candidates with previous OOD experience to help start
the training.&quot;We had to jump-start our program, so we chose people who were already
OOD qualified on other Nimitz-class aircraft carriers,&quot;Walls said.

In order to train the candidates, Walls relied on help from other
carriers on the waterfront and used ship&apos;s bridge simulators, both at
Naval Station Norfolk and at Fort Eustis as well as on-the-job training
using smaller boats such as the U.S. Naval Academy&apos;s yard patrol craft.&quot;The small boats allowed us to bring the rest of the bridge team into
the equation. That&apos;s not possible with the simulator,&quot;Walls explained.

Despite the training plan, getting signatures on the qualification sheet
(to reflect the different areas of the training plan were completed) was
more difficult for Smith than on an already commissioned, operational
aircraft carrier.&quot;For a PCU, this was a challenge. Several watch standers went underway
on operational CVN&apos;s to gain experience and get signatures. Executing
the training plan set forth by the navigation department prepared me to
re-qualify as a CVN OOD,&quot;Smith said.

NNS081101-06. Navy Leader Participates in AISES Conference

By Chief Mass Communication Specialist Brian Brannon

Fleet Public Affairs Center, Pacific

ANAHEIM, Calif. (NNS) -- The commander of U.S. Navy submarines in the
Mediterranean spoke about leadership principles at the Conference of the
American Indian Science&amp;Engineering Society Oct. 30 at the Anaheim
Convention Center.

Addressing a group of more than 50 engineers, educators, business people
and students, Capt. Jeffrey Trussler, commander of Task Force 69/369,
shared perspectives on leadership gathered during a career that has
included command of the fleet ballistic missile submarine USS Maryland
(SSBN 738).&quot;If there&apos;s one thing I&apos;ve learned in my 24 years of service, it&apos;s that
the success of an organization is based on its people,&quot;he said.

Trussler listed eight principles to inspire and motivate others to
succeed. He noted that while the Navy is first and foremost a military
organization, in some respects it is similar to a large corporation,
albeit one that has been in business for 230 years and employs 700,000
active and Reserve Sailors, civilians and contractors.&quot;I&apos;m from a company that&apos;s been around a long time and has some
established practices,&quot;he said.&quot;It&apos;s set up to make you succeed.&quot;The first principle Trussler introduced is especially applicable to
military commanders.&quot;You have to play the hand you&apos;re dealt,&quot;he said, explaining that it&apos;s
up to a leader to find out how to get the most from his or her team.

Other essentials of leadership Trussler discussed included taking care
of your people, holding yourself and your team accountable, building
teamwork, learning from good leaders, knowing the difference between
leadership and management, understanding where to apply your energies,
and letting people learn from their mistakes.

Shaun Tsabetsaye, an engineer from the Zuni Pueblo tribe, said he found
many of Trussler&apos;s ideas applicable to his own career with computer
component manufacturer Intel.&quot;His model about accountability is very applicable because the
technicians on the floor are responsible for the quality of our
products,&quot;he said.

Trussler, who is part Cherokee, was also selected by AISES to receive
its 2008 Executive Excellence Award.

AISES Corporate Advisory Council Chairman Laurence Brown, a member of
the Luiseño tribe, said Trussler&apos;s career can serve as inspiration for
future Native American engineers.&quot;Having Capt. Trussler being here as a role model and being recognized
for what he&apos;s doing is a great opportunity for students to see how they
can succeed,&quot;Brown said.

NNS081101-05. MSFSC Dedicates New Headquarters

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class (SW) David Wyscaver, Fleet
Public Affairs Center Atlantic

NORFOLK, Va. (NNS) -- Military Sealift Fleet Support Command held a
ceremony at Naval Station Norfolk Oct. 30 to dedicate the opening of the
command&apos;s new headquarters.&quot;The dedication ceremony today marks not only the opening of MSFSC&apos;s new
headquarters but also the culmination of [Military Sealift Command&apos;s]
five-year-long global transformation into a new, more efficient, more
effective and responsive organization in the support of national
defense,&quot;said Jack Taylor, MSFSC director.

In January 2003, MSC, parent command of MSFSC, embarked on a major
effort to streamline MSC into a 21st-century organization. The change
empowered MSFSC to crew, train, equip and maintain more than 40 civil
service-crewed U.S. Navy ships that are supply lines to underway carrier
and expeditionary strike groups. MSFSC ships also provide the fleet with
towing capability, rescue and salvage services, and serve as floating
medical facilities.

The over-arching goal of the reorganization was to better align MSC and
its afloat logistics and defense transportation services with the
organizations they serve, including U.S. Fleet Forces Command, U.S.
Transportation Command and the rest of the Department of Defense.

The MSFSC ceremony included the unveiling of a monument honoring
merchant mariners and their service to the nation.&quot;It is those people who hoist the colors, stand the watches and deliver
the goods we should remember we are obliged to serve as we occupy these
buildings,&quot;said Rear Adm. Robert D. Reilly Jr., MSC commander,
reflecting the etching on the marble monument.&quot;That is why we have
chosen to grace this location with a commemorative marker: to remind us
of our mission, to recognize those who have served and those who
continue to serve MSC and our Navy.&quot;For more news from Fleet Public Affairs Center Atlantic, visit

NNS081101-04. National Naval Medical Center Conducts Mass Casualty Drill

By Sarah Fortney, National Naval Medical Center Public Affairs

BETHESDA, Md. (NNS) -- Bethesda Hospital&apos;s Emergency Preparedness
Partnership hosted a training exercise Oct. 30 designed to test the
regional disaster response program as well as enhance communication and
relationships between federal, state, local and military officials.&quot;Several incidents throughout Presidential Inauguration Week, ranging
from severe weather conditions to improvised explosive device
detonations, preceded a catastrophic terrorist attack at Bethesda&apos;s
National Naval Medical Center (NNMC).&quot;Fortunately, this scenario did not actually occur; however, it was part
of the fourth annual Collaborative Multi-Agency Exercise (CMAX).

Because participants in the drill  more than 1,000 individuals from
more than a dozen agencies  would work together in the event of such an
emergency, it is important to exchange business cards beforehand, so to
speak, Christopher Gillette, command emergency manager explained.&quot;It&apos;s important to conduct such a drill because it provides an
opportunity to work with all of our counterparts,&quot;said Gillette.&quot;It&apos;s
about standardization. The more we plan, the more can prepare the
readiness.&quot;In chilling temperatures, rescue workers and agency officials worked
together in the aftermath of a simulated attack throughout the morning.

Not only did the drill test the partnership&apos;s relationship between
multiple agencies, it also evaluated available resources, assessment of
explosive devices and identification of chemical agents, Gillette noted.

During the drill, which took six months of preparation, workers were
informed that a chemical agent had been detected after the simulated
explosion, Gillette said. The exercise tested their ability to determine
whether they were prepared to transport&quot;dirty&quot;victims following
decontamination.

After the&quot;victims&quot;were treated, they were taken via ambulance and
helicopter to Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC), Suburban Hospital
and Andrews Air Force Base&apos;s Malcolm Grow Medical Center.

Volunteers donned torn clothes, powdered their faces and covered
themselves in fake blood, abrasions and other disfigurations. On the
sidewalk, the volunteers began screaming for help and crying in pain
after hearing the sound of a simulated explosion.

Julie Zelman, a nurse, was one of the convincing role players serving as
injured. Aside from suffering a large laceration in her forearm, not
being able to walk and having symptoms of resulting illness, she said,
her character was conscious and alert, unlike several others lying
beside her.

Zelman believes the drill allows people to gain confidence that, in the
event of an emergency, they will be taken care of.&quot;I think it&apos;s a great experience,&quot;she said.

Also participating in the drill were firefighters and rescue workers
from NNMC and WRAMC fire departments, Fort Meade Fire and Emergency
Services, Montgomery County Fire and Rescue Service and Hazardous
Response Team/Units and the National Institutes of Health Fire
Department and Hazardous Response Team/Units.

Within the first 30 minutes of the exercise, responders had evaluated
the scene and began assessing patients, Gillette said. The drilled
flowed in a timely manner as responders worked quickly and efficiently.

After nearly 90 minutes, all of the simulated victims had been
decontaminated and were being triaged for transportation to other
hospitals, NNMC Fire Department Chief Patrick Fleming said.

NNMC&apos;s fire department could not take on such a task single-handedly,
Fleming said. Workers joined forces today to work as a team, just as
they would, had it not been a drill.&quot;In every drill, you learn something, you improve,&quot;he said.

In addition to the events taking place outside the hospital, there were
more than 2,500 hospital staff and personnel participating in internal
training, Gillette said.

NNS081101-03. CVN 70 Supply Earns COMNEXCOM Excellence Award

By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Kristan Robertson and Mass
Communication Specialist Seaman Ashley Van Dien, USS Carl Vinson Public
Affairs

NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (NNS) -- The supply department&apos;s S-3 division aboard
USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) received the Pacific Fleet&apos;s annual Ship&apos;s
Store Retail and Service Excellence Award Oct. 15 for exceptional
performance on board during fiscal year 2008.

The award, presented by Commander, Navy Exchange Service Command,
recognized outstanding professionalism and significant contributions
made by S-3 personnel in improving the quality of life for&quot;Gold Eagle&quot;crew members.&quot;The S-3 division is just like a grocery or corner store for our
Sailors,&quot;said Ship&apos;s Serviceman 2nd Class (SW) Latoya Petgrave, record
keeper for S-3.&quot;We order products, store them, process inventory, keep
records and then distribute the products into vending machines and the
ship&apos;s store, where the crew can find whatever they need.&quot;A carrier on cruise can average about $7-10 million in sales with
maximum personnel and squadrons on board, said Senior Chief Ship&apos;s
Serviceman (AW/SW) Jeffrey Davidson. Vinson, while not yet fully manned
and still in its Refueling Complex Overhaul (RCOH) shipyard period,
brought in a remarkable $1.2 million without being deployed.

The division&apos;s barber shop, laundry service and ship&apos;s store personnel
played a pivotal role in earning the award by simultaneously surpassing
four other aircraft carriers in profits earned. A total of about
$240,000 in profits earned was donated to the ship&apos;s Morale, Welfare and
Recreation (MWR) division, providing funding for events and activities
geared specifically toward building morale and camaraderie amongst the
crew.

Favorable ratings and remarks on random customer surveys and outstanding
performance during inspections contributed greatly to the division&apos;s
achievement. Carl Vinson crew members had previously won the award in
2004 and are looking forward to competing for the title of&quot;Best of the
Best,&quot;pending the results of a last inspection slated to be held in
January.&quot;During an inspection, someone said he had never seen any ship like this
-- in an RCOH environment -- provide services while maintaining such
high optimism levels,&quot;said Davidson.&quot;Just to have been nominated was
amazing, but winning the award is just excellent. Everyone in supply and
our division helped us get to this point. As a group, it&apos;s a wonderful
family to be a part of.&quot;USS Carl Vinson is currently undergoing its scheduled refueling complex
overhaul (RCOH) at Northrop Grumman Newport News shipyard. The RCOH is
an extensive yard period that all Nimitz-class aircraft carriers go
through near the mid-point of their 50-year life cycle.

During RCOH Carl Vinson&apos;s nuclear fuel will be replenished and the
ship&apos;s services and infrastructure will be upgraded to make her the most
state-of-the-art aircraft carrier in the fleet and prepare for another
25 years or more of service.
