 JOTS Looks Back on Portable Restrooms at First NJ Federal Stimulus Project in Edison, NJ 
 Wednesday, February 1st, 2012

The Edison Station project, which  added nearly 500 additional parking spaces at the Edison Station on the Northeast Corridor, along with new lighting and sidewalks, was helped along by two of Johnny On The Spot’s standard units, as well as a Porta-Water system.

 JOTS Lends Helping Hand to U.S. Army Soldier&amp;Family with Portable Restroom Rental 
 Wednesday, February 1st, 2012 
JOHNNY ON THE SPOT LENDS HELPING HAND TO INJURED U.S ARMY SOLDIER&amp;FAMILY

JOTS Donates Portable Restrooms While Sgt. Minard’s Home Is Renovated

OLD BRIDGE, N.J. (August 26, 2009) --- Johnny On The Spot, New Jersey’s most reputable portable sanitation provider since 1970, takes pride in not only providing the finest service available, but  also giving back to those in need. And this could not have been more evident when Mary Monahan, a volunteer for the project sponsored by Homes for Our Troops (a non-profit organization that rebuilds homes for permanently disabled soldiers returning from war), contacted Johnny On The Spot to lend a helping hand in the reconstruction of a national hero’s home.

U.S. Army Sgt. Michael Minard of Union Beach, N.J., returned home in October of 2007 from his third deployment in Iraq. With eight years of service to his country, Sgt. Minard was in the 4th ID 1/8th Infantry Unit based out of Fort Carson, Colo. His final tour put him with the 1/2 SCR Stryker Brigade, a tour that would end in tragedy for Minard and his counterparts. It was during this third and final tour that Sgt. Minard’s Stryker armored vehicle  detonated an improvised explosive device in the Sadr City section of Baghdad. The explosion resulted in the loss of Sgt. Minard’s legs and left the rest of his Brigade severely wounded.

Since this tragic incident, Sgt. Minard was fitted for prosthetic legs. With these new prosthetic legs, he has had to overcome a multitude of serious life adjustments, the hardest of which being to learn how to walk again. With his mobility compromised vastly, his home in Union Beach was in need of numerous improvements in order to increase accessibility and comfortability. This is where Johnny on the Spot came in, donating two portable restrooms for the duration of Sgt. Minard’s home reconstruction project for him, his wife Linda and two young children.
This request was fulfilled without hesitation by Johnny On The Spot President Jesse Thompson. “It’s great to be able to help out where we can, especially for our troops serving to protect our country and freedom,” said Thompson. “Giving back is part of what we do at Johnny On The Spot, and I’m thrilled to have the opportunity to contribute to this great cause. We at JOTS wish Sgt. Minard and his family the best in their new home.” Those wishing to contribute to Sgt. Minard’s recovery are encouraged to visit www.sgtminard.com.

 Outdoor Events Need a Porta Potty 
 Monday, November 28th, 2011 
If you have ever been to any sort of event outdoors and had to use the restroom then you&apos;ve undoubtedly used a porta potty . These convenient and portable toilets have been around for decades allowing us the relief we need when bushes and bottles just won&apos;t do. They are highly affordable to rent for any occasion and are at staple at craft shows, fairgrounds and fireworks shows around the nation.

Porta Potty Superior Design

These portable restrooms may seem somewhat futuristic but are designed using an ancient restroom as their model. Outhouses are not much different than porta potties, but are far more unsanitary. Both were able to be moved in a way, and they were really nothing more than a seat built over a hole.

The porta potty chooses to use more modern inventions in an effort to provide a more comfortable and sanitized environment for you to do your business. They are equipped with toilet paper and while they may not often be equipped with sinks more and more are using sanitizer dispensers in their place. They give you the privacy you need to relieve yourself when you are in even the most crowded of areas.

An American Icon

Their shape and colors have become somewhat iconic around the world, and just about everyone knows what they are. The porta potty has evolved quite a bit since it was first introduced and it will continue to do so as more technology becomes available in the form of portable sanitation.

These units are highly affordable and the most practical way to provide restrooms for large numbers of people. They can be rented for any event and are an easy solution to stop people from parading through your home during parties and large gatherings, including weddings, receptions, and anniversaries. While they are most commonly rented in large numbers for large gatherings they can be reserved one at a time for personal use as well.

Construction Sites to Family Reunions

The porta potty is a staple on construction sites where standard bathrooms simply aren&apos;t in existence yet. They allow workers to do their business when needed without having to leave the site. Home day cares and summer camps may also rent a couple of these units to allow the children and chaperons a place to go without having to run all through the home. They are especially ideal if you only have one restroom in your home and prevent lines from forming.

Portable toilets are a sanitary way to provide relief for all those who need it and can be used in any type of weather. They are available year round and there are often a variety of different models for your use as well. Take a look around and see what your options are the next time you are planning an event, big or small. You can schedule the delivery and pickup when you make your reservation so you won&apos;t have to wait around for it to be picked up when you are done with them. Delivery fees are often included in the rental price of the units as well.

 Learn About Porta Potty Maintenance for Your Next Event and Other Important Factors 
 Friday, November 4th, 2011 
At one time or another you have probably used or at least seen a porta potty . These are usually small enclosures that house a portable toilet. They provide bathroom services in places where there is no plumbing or sewage services to serve as additional bathrooms for oversized crowds. This can be for construction sites, concerts, weddings, parties, fairs, or most any type event, large or small. If you are considering renting one or a group of these units there are several considerations that can help you avoid surprises and headaches.

How Often Does Maintenance Need to Occur?

Depending on the length of your rental, for instance. a single evening versus several days or weeks, there are varying degrees of maintenance that will need to be performed. A company representative will be able to tell you how many units you will need based on your expected crowd, length of time of the event, special amenities that event-goers may need, types food and drink services at the event, age and other crowd demographics, and so on. This information is important for estimating the number of units you will need, the cost, placement, and the frequency of maintenance that will be required.

Ask the representative or salesperson how often the units will be serviced, when the cleaning will take place, and what is involved. Request a list of cleaning agents that the company will use. You want to be sure that each porta potty is sanitized with products that kill viruses, bacteria and fungi. Neglected units will become a health hazard and the odor can drive event-goers away. Ask if hand sanitizer, toilet paper, and paper towels are provided on delivery and restocked during routine maintenance. Ask if they have a 24-hour, seven days a week service number with a live person available for assistance to answer your questions.

Placement of Porta Potty Units

Be sure to discuss the location for placement of the porta potty units. Once they are delivered you will not be able to move them yourself and this can also go against your contract. You want the units far enough away from guests so that odors do not interfere with your function or the serving of any food and beverages. You also want the units close enough to be convenient for people to visit. Make sure you estimate how many people could be standing in lines and make allowance for this space.

Porta Potty Inspection

Upon delivery of your units inspect them for any damage as well as cleanliness. As with most rental agreements for other items and vehicles, you will be liable for any damage to the porta potty units while they are on your premises. Check that each unit&apos;s door is functioning properly and can be locked, the unit is clean, the soap or hand sanitizer dispenser is stocked and working and the paper is easily accessible. Maintenance should not need to occur before the event even begins. Note any damages and refuse delivery of any non-functioning units. There is no reason to start off on the wrong foot with out of order equipment. This can cause backed up lines at other units, reflects poorly on your event, and makes you look bad. Make sure you have a 24-hour service number for the representative and company.

 Porta Potties and the Portable Sanitation Association International (PSAI) 
 Wednesday, October 26th, 2011 
The Portable Sanitation Association International (PSAI) plays an important role in the portable sanitation industry. The not-for-profit organization has made itself known as the voice of the industry, it helps to set standards on portable sanitation, and serves as a resource to educate people about the industry. Learn about the history of the PSAI and more about its goals and overall purpose.

History of the PSAI

The PSAI has been around since 1970 when a group of portable sanitation leaders got together to help solve issues in the industry. Since that time, leaders have been able to help set standards for porta potties and portable sanitation as a whole. The organization has also been involved with setting up conventions and tradeshows for professionals in the industry, which will be explained in detail a little further down.

Why Use Porta Potties?

The PSAI has outlined not only uses for porta potties , but also the benefits of portable sanitation in general. According to the PSAI website, porta potties have uses at construction and other work sites, parks, government agencies, sporting events, outdoor public gatherings, disaster relief situations, and other permanent and temporary locations. Porta potties provide many benefits, according to the organization&apos;s website. On work sites, portable sanitation facilities can lend cost and time savings since workers will not have to go use a facility off-site. The company operating the work site will be able to save money on their labor expenses with the help of portable sanitation facilities on-site. Because water and sewers are not available everywhere, porta potties can be available to protect the health of all people and all living things in the environment. Portable sanitation is also environmentally friendly, according to PSAI, since porta potties use less water than a conventional permanent toilet. These are some of the reasons porta potties should be used according to the PSAI.

Membership in the PSAI

Companies selling porta potties and interested in the portable sanitation industry can become members in the PSAI. Members can be kept up-to-date with the trending products and topics in the industry, be part of a professional networking program, become certified with certain certification programs, receive special sales and marketing literature and materials, along with other benefits. Companies in the portable sanitation industry can truly benefit from a membership in the PSAI.

Programs Offered by the PSAI

The PSAI offers a convention and tradeshow once a year for members as well as non-members to attend. These conventions and tradeshows offer workshops, roundtable discussions, tournaments, and more events for professionals in the portable sanitation industry. Topics of the workshops range from how to run the business to how to manage social media and marketing campaigns. The PSAI also hosts meetings for the organization&apos;s board of directors a few times a year as well as workshops for educational and social purposes.

 Porta Potty Affordable Solutions for any Occasion 
 Monday, October 10th, 2011 
The porta potty has always been the cheap and affordable option to provide restrooms to the masses for any occasion. They are primarily found on fairgrounds and outdoor events around the country and seem to travel in packs rather than by themselves.

The only time you will ever really see a single, lone porta potty is usually around a construction site. There is a very good reason for this too; most construction companies have several different sites going on at one time and split up their restrooms among the properties. On some larger properties companies may provide two or three of these pieces to support the entire construction staff.

Clean and Durable Porta Potty Construction

A benefit to using a portable restroom system is that you don’t have to rent two separate units for males and females. Each one contains both a toilet of sorts as well as a urinal so you can take care of business in whatever fashion behooves you. Hygiene is important to keep a healthy society, and while sinks and running water often aren’t available in these smaller items each one does contain a dispenser for hand sanitizer, which is the next best thing according to medical professionals.

Movable Relief

While some people may think that these removable relief stations are smelly and gross that is very clearly not the case. Porta potties are a very clean and sanitary option to provide restrooms for large crowds of people. They are made only of non-porous materials, which means that harmful bacteria cannot be absorbed and harvested. They can be cleaned and sanitized in minutes to maintain ultimate cleanliness. There are several different pipe-like vents in every stall to help the odors caused by urination and defecation to be released into the atmosphere instead of being trapped inside.

Remarkable Capacity

Each waste receptacle is able to hold a remarkable amount of waste, and contains a chemical in most cases to help eliminate odors that may be left. These porta potty units are normally secured to the ground when they are delivered to prevent them from tipping due to heavy winds, natural disasters, and rowdy teenagers.

If you are looking for a convenient and affordable way to provide bathroom relief to a large group of people but have a budget smaller than what you would like it to be then renting a block of porta potties is definitely your best option. There are many different porta potty companies that provide this service in every state, just do a little research and see what you can come up with.

Most porta potty companies are more than willing to work out some kind of deal when you reserve a certain number of units which can lower your cost and save you some money. This surplus can then be used to upgrade to a different model with a flushing toilet and sink or to rent out separate hand washing stations. These can be freestanding and located outside of the stall themselves allowing for faster turnaround while keeping conditions sanitary and hygienic at all times.

 Porta Potties for Going Green 
 Monday, September 26th, 2011 
The green movement is one that is definitely here to stay. Everything from cars to homes to household products has been transformed to be more environmentally friendly. Porta potties are no different. Not only are porta potties already environmentally friendly, but there are many ways from their use to their maintenance where improvements have been made that make them a green product. Porta potties can also be implemented at parties and events where there is a theme of going green.

Porta Potties in Themselves are Green

The great thing about porta potties is that they are already considered environmentally friendly. Unlike permanent, indoor restrooms, porta potties use less water. Conventional toilets use a significantly greater amount of clean water per use. Using less water makes porta potties as a product environmentally friendly.

Environmentally Friendly Cleaning Products for Porta Potties

Everything down to the cleaning products for porta potties should be environmentally friendly. There are chemicals for actually cleaning the facilities and there are chemicals inside the facility, such as in the holding tank. The chemicals in conventional products may not only cause harm to the environment, but to human health as well. Some key ingredients in certain cleaners can cause cancer, affect neurons and brain activity, and cause problems with reproduction, development, growth, and behavior. That is why it is important that people use environmentally friendly cleaning products, even for cleaning portable toilets. The cleaning products will usually not contain formaldehyde or alcohol and will be nontoxic. Many companies offer the services of a restroom service attendant to work during events. The restroom service attendants work to keep the porta potties clean and sanitary while the event is in progress. The attendants will use environmentally friendly cleaning products to protect everyone at the event from harmful chemicals in other cleaning products.

Porta Potties for Green Events

Many types of events that are held throughout the year have themes associated with them. The theme of “going green” is one that is becoming more and more popular. Many people who are planning events of any size may prefer to keep everything associated with the event green and environmentally friendly. Everything from the planning of the event to the event itself to the cleanup and any post-event activities can be green friendly. For example, the person(s) in charge of the event can keep the paper to a minimum. An iPad or similar device is ideal because documents with important event information can be stored and the iPad is compact enough that it can be taken anywhere. At the event, porta potties should be rented to continue with the environmental protection efforts. Less water is used or wasted with porta potties so they are an obvious choice, especially for large parties and events. For pre- and post-event messages to guests, utilize email rather than sending paper invitations and thank you cards through the mail. Communicating with guests via email is great for keeping with the going green theme.

 Porta Potty: The Essential Ingredient for a 5k Race 
 Thursday, July 21st, 2011 
5k races have proliferated throughout the United States in the last two decades. Whether it’s to commemorate a holiday, serve as a fundraiser, or simply stand as a community event, there is no doubt that the 5k has grown in popularity. The appeal of the race is the relatively short distance and wide array of potential runners who can participate; from the super fit, to the casual weekend warrior, from the very young to very old – almost anyone can do it and have a great time. But if you’re planning to organize a 5k there is one essential ingredient that must be given intense consideration: the porta potty .

The Porta Potty and the 5k Race: A Special Relationship

If you’ve ever run a race, you know exactly what this subheading refers to. But, even if you’ve never once stepped on the starting line you can appreciate the human connection between a pending nostalgic event and your bladder/bowels. There is some cosmic, intuitive bond that links this physical event with the internal physiological workings of your body. Enter the porta potty , the runner’s best friend, and an absolute “must have” for any and every 5k race.

How Many Porta Potties Do You Need For a 5K Race?

If you ask a runner, there’s never too many porta potties. But as a race coordinator, you’re working with a tangible budget, so numbers matter – too many and you are wasting money, not enough and your runners are waiting in lines and missing out on the fun of the race. Therefore, the general rule is simple: you should have one porta potty for every fifty people. (This rule applies to one day events, like a 5k. However, it an event is overnight or lasts a couple of days, then you should double the number of porta potties you have.) However, if your 5k race is predominantly geared towards women, consider 50% more porta potties than originally configured. You should also make sure that you have at least one wheelchair accessible porta potty for each cluster of regular ones, amounting to around 10% of the total number of porta potties .

Where Do You Place the Porta Potties at the 5k Race?

There are a few factors to consider when placing porta potties at the event location. Make sure there is level ground, a safe distance from the event, proper lighting (there has been increase in evening and night time 5k races), and try not to place them near monuments or residential areas. The town or city the event is taking place may have specific ordinances regarding the placement of porta potties, so make sure your reach out to the appropriate town/city official. In addition, try to keep them out of the way of automobile traffic as well as pedestrian traffic. Finally, allow enough space so that lines can form.

 Restroom Trailers from Porta Potty Companies 
 Tuesday, May 3rd, 2011 
Restroom trailers from porta potty companies are becoming more popular for many types of events. With the special accommodations offered and the feel given that is similar to a permanent restroom, there is little argument that guests enjoy using restroom trailers at events.

What Types of Events are Restroom Trailers from Porta Potty Companies Useful?

Restroom trailers are used for every type of event imaginable. Sporting events, marathons, fundraisers, benefits, black tie affairs, parties, weddings, carnivals, fairs, and construction sites all can benefit from having restroom trailers on-site.

Why Choose Restroom Trailers from a Porta Potty Company?

 Porta potty companies specialize in providing a comfortable restroom experience for clients. Restroom trailers are just another way for companies to serve clients and everyone who will be using the rentals. Restroom trailers are larger than traditional porta potties and provide a more comfortable experience for guests. The trailers offer guests a restroom experience that is very similar to that of permanent restroom locations, allowing the guests to have a more enjoyable experience overall. Every aspect of an event should be enjoyable, right down to the seemingly smaller aspects, such as taking care of business.

Types of Restroom Trailers Offered by Porta Potty Companies

There are a many different types of restroom trailers available to rent from porta potty companies. The restroom trailers are usually different based on the features inside. Some have many or all of the following features: hardwood floors, laminated walls, vanity spaces, heating, air conditioning, running water, skylight, hand soap, hand towels, running water, and stereo systems. Some events may call for a more basic restroom trailer with fewer special features, while more upscale events may need all of the bells and whistles offered in the trailer by the porta potty provider. The type of restroom trailer chosen should align with the atmosphere of the event.

How Many Restroom Trailers are Needed for an Event?

Since restroom trailers are typically larger than standard porta potties , there may not be as many needed if someone were to choose the trailers over porta potties. They can accommodate hundreds or even close to a thousand people over a four-hour period depending on the size of the specific trailer chosen. The rental company can help provide the specific information that you will need for planning the number of restroom trailers for your next major event.

Deciding on Restroom Trailers or Porta Potties for an Event

There are instances when it would be better to have porta potties available or sometimes it would be better to have restroom trailers on site. When planning an event or gathering, work with the rental company to determine the right portable restrooms needed.

 3 Reasons Homeowners May Need a Porta Potty Rental 
 Friday, April 29th, 2011 
You may be surprised to learn about how homeowners can benefit from renting porta potties for different occasions, events, and home improvements. A porta potty can be rented for a day or for an extended period of time, depending on the needs of the homeowners. When the indoor restroom is not available or if more restrooms are needed to accommodate more people, having a porta potty on-site at your home will be convenient for everyone.

Porta Potties for Parties and Events

Many families host birthday parties, graduation parties, retirement parties, family reunions, weddings, and other types of parties and events at their own homes. For all types of events held at home, homeowners can benefit from renting porta potties for guests. Rather than everyone having to come inside just to use the restroom, they can use the porta potty that is outside. You may be preparing the food and activities for the event inside the house and do not want guests to come inside and be in the way. Porta potty rentals will keep guests outside and out of the way of the preparations. Also, you will not have to worry about people tracking in dirt from outside since they will not have to come inside.

Porta Potties for Construction and Home Renovation

Construction, remodeling, and renovating are necessary parts of owning a home. Small and large renovations are a hassle on your daily living routine. If you are renovating multiple rooms in your home you may have workers coming in to help. You probably would feel more comfortable with having porta potties outside for workers to use rather than your bathrooms.

The construction crews will need to use the restroom at some points during the work day. If they are working on the outside of your home and you are not home, you will probably not leave your home open for them. Rent a porta potty or two for the construction workers. It can be delivered when the construction process begins and then removed as soon as your home is complete.

Porta Potties for Emergency Sanitation

Emergency situations beyond your control may pop up around your home and you may need porta potties for emergency sanitation. If you have a septic tank, the septic line may back up at any time. Is the septic tank service company available to come right away to help fix the problem? What if you need an entirely new septic tank? Porta potty companies can help relieve stress for homeowners by coming to the rescue at the first sign of any home plumbing problems or issues. Porta potty companies provide temporary sanitation solutions for homeowners during major projects such as installing a new septic tank.

 Unique Uses for Porta Potties 
 Tuesday, February 8th, 2011 
Not just your Granny&apos;s porta potty! Porta potties are not just used as a traditional restroom facility anymore. You may not have suspected porta potties to be part of the training process for football players or for an entertaining (and addicting) game for your iPhone or iPod Touch. These unique uses for porta potties have people very surprised that they can be used for something other than restroom facilities. Unique specifications and amenities for porta potties can also bring any event to the next level for guests.

Porta Potties on the Field

In August 2010, the Kansas City Chiefs made headlines before the start of football season because of an interesting training drill that the players participated in. The coaching staff ordered for porta potties to be available during practice to help players with their concentration. A player would sit inside, another would open and close the door and the coach would throw the ball for the player inside to catch. The door would fly open as the ball was approaching. This football drill has been around for about 16 years!

Porta Potties on your iPhone

Porta potties are sometimes used in unique ways not traditionally seen. For example, porta potties have been spotted on your iPhone in the form of a game application. The name of the application is Potty Racers and its slogan is “Launch your Porta Potty for the stinkiest ride of your life!” It was voted as one of the most addicting games of 2010. Who knew that racing porta potties could be so much fun?

Unique Amenities for Porta Potties

The places to find porta potties do not seem to be as unique as the specifications and amenities for them. Holding a high-class, pricey event calls for fancy, luxury porta potties and restroom facilities for use by the hosts and guests. Celebrities and public figures holding popular events want the entire event to be classy and sophisticated, right down to the restroom facilities for guests. It was reported that Chelsea Clinton spent a whopping $15,000 on high-class porta potties for her wedding. Of course, these were not traditional porta potties. The ones available at the wedding had actual porcelain and flushing toilets, hand sinks, real wood floors and walls, and counters.

The National Football League (NFL) spends more than $155,000 for porta potties, just for the Superbowl games. Who would have thought that porta potties could cost that much money? Traditional porta potties as well as trailers were supplied for attendees. The cost is for only the facilities and does not include the cost of a cleaning crew to clean and maintain the restroom facilities before, during, and after the biggest game of the year.

Porta potties have been used in unique ways and serve unique purposes other than the traditional use for a temporary restroom facility. Porta potties have been seen on a football training field for players to further develop their skills and in the palm of your hand on a smart phone application. Luxury porta potties have been called to duty at high-class events and social engagement for celebrities and public figures. Lavish porta potties are even used at popular, highly anticipated sporting events such as the Superbowl. These are just a few unique uses and amenities for porta potties.
