 McDonald&apos;s has announced some &quot;more nutritionally-balanced choices&quot; on their menus.

One change will be that the near ubiquitous Happy Meal will now include apples. Sure, parents have had the option to get apples instead of French Fries for some time, but starting in September, the standard Happy Meal will come with a half-serving of apple slices and a smaller, 1.1 oz size French Fries (they used to be 2.4 oz). There will also be some new drink options, including fat-free chocolate milk and 1% low fat white milk, and they are dropping the caramel sauce for the apples.

These changes will supposedly reduce the number of calories in some Happy Meals, which can be up to 600 to 700 calories, by 20%.

I&apos;m not sure that a McDonald&apos;s tray with a cheeseburger, fries, apples, and milk is what the new MyPlate guidelines had in mind when they said to make half of your plate fruits and vegetables though.

Still, it is likely better than nothing. A lot of parents and kids eat fast food, either as an occasional treat, or more often because of convenience, so making it a little healthier is a good thing. Could they have gone even further and substituted more apples and dropped the fries all together? Sure, but then how many people would simply ask for fries?

Is this taking away your choice to give your child unhealthy food? Of course not. Remember, you are still at a fast food restaurant, so technically nothing is going to be all that healthy. Changing how they offer the healthier menu choices should make it easier to recognize that they are actually available.

For example, we recently at a McDonald&apos;s in Arkansas, while taking a break on a long drive. The kids got a Happy Meal, but for the first time that I can remember, they actually asked if I wanted apple slices and milk. It made the decision a lot easier, instead of automatically getting fries and a soda.

What do you think of the new Happy Meals?
