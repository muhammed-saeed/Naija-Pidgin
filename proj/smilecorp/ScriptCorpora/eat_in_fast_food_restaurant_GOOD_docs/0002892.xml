 Correct answer is San Bernardino California....Kroc didn&apos;t show up with his Chicago area joint until 15 years later when he boughjt out the McDonald brothers....from my personal knowledge and Wikipedia:

McDonald&apos;s founders (**** and Mac McDonald) first venture into the food business was in 1937, when they opened a hot dog stand in Arcadia, California. They opened the first McDonald&apos;s restaurant on May 15, 1940, in San Bernardino, California. Hamburgers proved to be their most popular product, so in 1948 the brothers introduced their&quot;Speedee Service System,&quot;a streamlined assembly line for hamburgers that allowed them to produce burgers quickly and inexpensively. Their cheap burgers were very successful, and in 1953 they began to franchise McDonald&apos;s restaurants. Entrepreneur Ray Kroc visited the first restaurant in 1953, and sensing its potential, he convinced the brothers to put him in charge of franchising. He later purchased the brothers&apos;interest in the company, and oversaw its worldwide expansion.

McDonald&apos;s Corporation (NYSE: MCD) is the world&apos;s largest chain of fast-food restaurants, selling variations on meals comprising hamburgers, french fries and carbonated drinks. While some branches of the restaurant also sell a limited range of vegetarian food and more healthy offerings like fruit and milk, the company is associated with its high-calorie, standardised menu and commitment to fast service.

The business was founded in 1940 with a restaurant opened by siblings **** and Mac McDonald. It was their introduction of the&quot;Speedee Service System&quot;in 1948 that established the principles of the fast-food restaurant. However, the company today dates its&quot;founding&quot;to the opening of CEO Ray Kroc&apos;s first franchised restaurant, the company&apos;s ninth, in 1955. He opened his first McDonald&apos;s in Des Plaines, Illinois in April 1955.

As the first and largest fast food chain, McDonalds has become a focal point in public debate about rising obesity rates, corporate ethics and consumer responsibility. This is discussed in more detail in the section of this article entitled Criticisms

 McDonald&apos;s founders (**** and Mac McDonald) first venture into the food business was in 1937, when they opened a hot dog stand in Arcadia, California (which they coincidentally purchased from another MacDonald, Erin Elizabeth).

 The first McDonald&apos;s was built in 1937 by the McDonald brothers (**** and Mac) Richard and Maurice McDonald . It is stated that
the Airdrome in Arcadia, California was the very first. Others claim that it all began in the 1940&apos;s with the McDonald&apos;s barbecue restaurant in San Bernardino, California. According to some research I did however, the first of the two brothers was the original but was took over by the company Kroc who opened the one in San Bernardino.
