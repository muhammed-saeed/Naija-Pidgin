 ★★★★★ Demisiada Comida (too much food) 
 Susan C. 5 Chacho&apos;s 
 
Pro: Everything on the menu is fantastic
Con: The portions are huge and you want to eat it all (bad for dieters)

I love this place--we moved out of the Galleria area, but every time I go that way, Chacho&apos;s is a must. It has a warehouse atmosphere except in the bar area. Order at the counter and wait at your table for your number to be called. Free iced tea refills. Everyting is Ala Carte, but the prices are so low it makes it great. You can feed a family of 4 very well for $25 or less.

The only dissapointment I&apos;ve ever had is that you can&apos;t order the Torta early in the AM because they are making pancakes and have to bake the bread--yep, everything is made on site.

This is probably the first place I have eaten at that you cant order the way you would at any other place. What I mean is youget alot of food for what you pay for.Also the margaritas are excellent too.

 ★★★★★ So MUCH FUN!! 
 M.C. D. | Insider Expert
| Rank: 6,926 5 Chacho&apos;s 
 
I could go on and on about this place, but I&apos;ll start by saying: you HAVE to go here at least once!! Whether you want Mexican takeout or a long happy hour filled with jumbo margaritas and ends self-serve salsas (a doen varieties) this place is awesome. The menu is huge, the prices can&apos;t be beat, and it&apos;s open 24 hours (and usually packed! Although ordering never takes more than a few minutes). It&apos;s cafeteria-style, so it&apos;s good for a casual date. However, make sure you check your order when you get it, because often enough, the kitchen gets so busy they will mess up your order in one way or another. It&apos;s always fixed quickly and hassle free, but do check to avoid disappointment, especially when ordering takeout. That said, this is one of Houston&apos;s best places.

PROS: cheap, dELICIOUS food, salsa bar, open 24 hours
CONS: check your order when you get it, parking

 ★★★★☆ Cheap Mexican Food, Great Taste

The food here is very inexpensive. If you like nachos, bring 4-5 friends to try and conquer their King Kong nachos, that cost less than $20. The worst thing about this place is there are no free drink refils, and no free tortilla chips

I love going here after the club. It is usually packed, but you don&apos;t have to wait long for your food. The food is great, it has so much flavor. They offer a wide variety of meals and even breakfast, lunch, or dinner. After 2:00 in the morning, this is the best place to go to grab a bite to eat.

 ★★☆☆☆ Chachos is filthy and food quaility is poor. 
by Ivan769 at Citysearch 2 Chacho&apos;s 
 September 08, 2010 
I have been eating at Chachos since they opened. The food was always good, great marjaritos and nice atmosphere. I have noticed a decline in the cleanleness of the estabishment and that it is falling apart.
the serice and food quailty has declined and they still do not have a bartender that is proficent in making drinks.
Both bath rooms are disgusting and filthy. The owners have gotten lazy in management and seem to leave it running on autopilot.
We usually get the king kong nachos, gorditos and occasionally breakfast. We no longer patrionize Chachos it is just too dirty


 ★★★★☆ Great 
by scorpio698 at Citysearch 4 Chacho&apos;s

Best fajitas in town and cheaper than anywhere! Great queso too.

Pros: Good price

Cons: None


 ★★★★★ Dirty nasty yuck!!! 
by CSMobileUser at Citysearch 5 Chacho&apos;s 
 May 11, 2010 
so dirty and nasty. made me sick to even look at the place. couldn&apos;t stay to eat or drink.


 ★★★★☆ Best Tortillas and Breakfast Tacos 
by AnaTHouston at Citysearch 4 Chacho&apos;s 
 March 15, 2010 
Hands down, this is restaurant-quality home-made Tex Mex that is better than any sit-down restuarant in town. When Chacho&apos;s first opened, I gained some weight no thanks to them.

I dream of their buttery, fluffy eggs inside a folded inside their fresh, lightly sweet tortillas. They are so good, you don&apos;t need to order cheese, which is extra. They must use cream in their eggs...I wish I knew their recipe. The juicy chorizo, tender barbacoa, and the thick-cut bacon are the best tacos. Breakfast tacos are priced lower if purchased Monday though Friday before 10:00 AM.

I like to order the Chicken Combination Platter which is not displayed on the drive-thru window menu. It&apos;s about $8, but it is enough for two people. The prices are more than Taco Bell&apos;s but less than a regular Mexican restaurant&apos;s.

Sometimes, the drive through experience is a hit or miss. The customer service at the drive thru is a little thuggish, but I don&apos;t mind as long as they are not the chefs. Be prepared to wait in the drive thru too.

Pros: Fresh Tex-Mex; Price

Cons: Thuggish counter help at drive thru


 ★★★★★ Best muchies ever! 
by foodguru16 at Citysearch 5 Chacho&apos;s 
 February 23, 2009 
I will admit that I&apos;ve never been to this establishment before midnight. If you are hungry around that time, there is nothing better.


 ★★★☆☆ A nice place for a quick bite 
by RNolan108 at Citysearch 3 Chacho&apos;s 
 December 11, 2008 
A nice place but the waitress a little slow. I will return because this is near my home. Its a good place to get out of traffic.


 ★☆☆☆☆ below standard customer service,Very poor hygiene,conflict with menu card price,overrated !!! 
by paldi27 at Citysearch 1 Chacho&apos;s 
 December 04, 2008 
I&apos;m amazed this place is still running its &quot;FOOD&quot; business, the way they treat their customers. The only time I went, the cashier got my order wrong,they had meat in the food despite of veggie order ! When I tried to correct him, he very impolitely told me&quot;pay the bill get the food&amp;get out from the line !!!! &quot;

If you get the chance to look at the backside of kitchen,u will realize that what the hell are you eating !!!

I don&apos;t understand how come these restaurant gets so much rating ??

Pros: location

Cons: CUSTOMER SERVICE,HYGIENE,YOU WILL BE TREATED AS ANIMAL


 ★☆☆☆☆ Worst customer service&amp;very overrated

Manager behaves like a highwayman !! Cashiers are extremely terrible !!!! I ordered taco&amp;I got mexican Salaad. When I asked them politely to change&amp;check in the receipt....the cashier said &quot; you are drunk ....!!!??? &quot; excuse me ....I said I am a teetotaler ....please behave sir ...!!! he said come in a line again and order another food....when I asked that can you please call your manager ??? he said ....&quot;this place is owned by me !!!!!!!!! &quot;

I left the place&amp;he started laughing !!! I was so shocked that I actually thougt ...where the hell I am ??




 ★☆☆☆☆ Disappointed...horrible customer service ! 
by houstontravelmaniac at Citysearch 1 Chacho&apos;s 
 December 03, 2008 
visited chacho&apos;s restaurant in Houston yeasterdayI had been frequent visitor at your restaurant in last year,I would say probably atleast twice a month ! but yesterday&apos;s event was so much appaling that I decided not to visit chacho&apos;s ever ! We ordered a some food thare,the cashier took the order&amp;we had a receipt. I later on found that the prices were charged more than I read in Menu card. I went to same cashier (manager refused to reveal his name -that was surprising).He completely ignored me&amp;my wife. My wife asked 7 times with word &quot;EXCUSE ME&quot; ! We felt that we have been abused because of race or country ?? I don&apos;t know !! Finally manager came&amp;solved the problem.He said that they recently changed the menu ! this was not enough,the cashier even mocked at us ...he was laughing on backside...he came back after we left ordering place..! Today when I called restaurant the attending manager at present dis not answer properly ! To tell you the truth,this was first horrible event in this country after I landed 2 years back !

Pros: good value for food

Cons: terrible customer service....way below standards


 ★☆☆☆☆ I will never go there again 
by BigJim01 at Citysearch 1 Chacho&apos;s 
 October 04, 2008 
I decided to start my day by picking up tacos for myself and my coworkers. After odering 15 tacos I waited for 30 minutes for them and then when I got to the office there were only 12 tacos. The barbacoa was so greasey that it dripped out of the bag and stained my carpet in the car. The taco sauces were runny and everything was just nasty. This was my last trip to Chacho&apos;s.

Pros: Open 24 hours

Cons: Slow servive, greasy food


 ★★★☆☆ Disappointed 
by toka1111 at Citysearch 3 Chacho&apos;s 
 September 02, 2008 
When my husband and I lived in west Houston in the past five or six years we used to go to Chacho&apos;s at least 2-3 times a month. Their food was great, super fresh and tasted delicious; their pico de galla is unbelievable, as well as their fajita nachos. Their margaritas on the rocks are absolutely the best I ever tried - and that comes from the margarita freak. But then we moved to Spring and eating at Chacho&apos;s started to feel like a very rare treat - until today. We happened to be in that part of town and stopped at Chacho&apos;s for lunch. First we were told that the restaurant had just changed their policy and the bar is now open only at night. Bye-bye, our chance to enjoy ritas on the rocks... Frozen versions were &quot;drinkable&quot; but totally nothing special. The cashier got sort of attitude-nal when we asked about the change of policy. Her demand &quot;Your right hand!&quot; when I put my left hand out to get a wristband sounded plain rude (and was ridiculous too). The food was still good though. The major setback was the dirt. Their bathroom (at least ladies&apos;) was always sort of small and dingy but it looks like these days they just stopped maintaining it at all. Paper towels on the wet floor and the only soap dispenser broken, literally smashed off the wall. After lunch we went to the closest theater for a movie and the first thing I did was to rush to the bathroom to wash my hands.
I feel sort of sad and almost cheated. This place used to be so good...


 ★☆☆☆☆ WORST DRIVE THRU SERVICE AND WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE IN TOWN.. 
by PatCR at Citysearch 1 Chacho&apos;s 
 August 30, 2008 
I start this review with one great true fact about Chacho&apos;s; the food is good! the drinks and salsa bar are great..however when you go so often as I used to do, you cannot help but noticing the filthyness and grimm around this place. They just don&apos;t care anymore.... One big truth about Chacho&apos;s nowdays (Aug 2008) is that the place is DIRTY AND UNHEALTHY...I guess because they are open 24 hrs, but shouldn&apos;t be that the main reason to clean?

Another thing that has gone sideways is the window service, the drive thru....first the PA system is awful, you cannot understand nor hear the person taking your order..or are they just mechanically assuming what your order will be? thus they get the wrong order 90 pct of the time! such as if you say &quot;taco&quot; they assume is a taco plate and nothing more! The staff is not friendly, they are not accomodating to special orders, since they make sure you KNOW they are upset if you make a special request.... This has happened to me so often that despite to my liking of the food, I stopped going there.

I had to suffer thru more than five wrong orders, during consecutive visits and experienced the staff&apos;s rage that came after I requested they fix my order, while I witnessed how a family was mistreated because they were not being clear placing their order! and after seeing how the cashier just walked away when he or she just had it!! I promissed myself not to be a subject of bad service, unhealthy surroundings with maybe unsanitary food preparation areas, and UNFRIENDLY CUSTOMER SERVICE!! I promissed myself never go back. and I stopped going to Chacho&apos;s!

After all, it is MY MONEY I am paying with!!!

Pros: good food, great salsa bar

Cons: awful customer service, dirty bathrooms and dining room


 ★★☆☆☆ Watch out for the 7.5% inflation surcharge! 
by mcol at Citysearch 2 Chacho&apos;s 
 August 18, 2008 
We went on Saturday night. We all took a menu to look over and noticed different prices on the menus. We ordered expecting to be charged the price of the lesser--typically what is done. Price charged was the higher, then, they added a 7.5% inflation surcharge on top of that! The staff said the owner didn&apos;t want to increase prices....well, he just did by doing that, without warning you!
Staff was friendly and helpful. Restaurant was dirty. Food was good. Ordering was very slow.
Won&apos;t go back.

Pros: food is good

Cons: inflation surcharge is absurd


 ★☆☆☆☆ Will not return for average food and bad service! 
by asjkagn at Citysearch 1 Chacho&apos;s 
 April 13, 2008 
These jerks bussed my $5 drink when I went to get my food and would not replace it even after busboy admitted doing so!! They even implied I was lying because so many people complain about that. If so many people complain, then maybe there is some truth to it. Screw Chacho&apos;s and that pimple boy cashier!


 ★★★★★ Drive in quick! 
by AYCooper at Citysearch 5 Chacho&apos;s 
 March 19, 2008 
I love their steakhouse beef fajitas especially as breakfast taco. The meat is so tender. Their creamy cilantro sauce is to die for! I put it on everything. Drive thru for breakfast very quicky. I go twice a week at least!

Pros: steakhhouse fajitas

Cons: drive thru machine needs updating- sometimes have to repeat requests


 ★★★★★ Chachos has the best nachos in town and margaritas!!!!!!!! 
by andra2007 at Citysearch 5 Chacho&apos;s 
 October 02, 2007 
Recently went to san antonio and was referred by my sister and brother n law that chachos had the best nachos in town. I didn&apos;t believe it until I saw the long wait and how many orders were called out . That night I believe over 200 people ordered nachos including myself. Man.... that line was big. Did I say that also my plate was a serving for five for only $9. Maybe I am going overboard but I gotta say its GOOOOOOOOOD!

Pros: great food, great people, great service, awesome price, good living

Cons: long wait, loud music, not family oriented, 20&apos;s and over joint


 ★★★★★ i love it 
by ghettofabuloustx at Citysearch 5 Chacho&apos;s 
 July 05, 2007 
i love chacho&apos;s! it is the late night spot after the clubs close! so expect it to be pretty crowded on the weekends. always good food and drinks!

Pros: cheap eats, 24 hour service

Cons: atmosphere, gets crowded quickly on weekend nights


 ★★★★★ Great quick Mexican food! 
by faresamari at Citysearch 5 Chacho&apos;s 
 May 26, 2007 
The food here is great, the service is great, the margaritas are great, this place is just... great! The menu is large but once you know what you want it comes out hot. There is a bar for sauce and other condiments for chips and the food. On days the weather is good they open a garage type door which is nice. Free wireless internet is a plus. I have been to many Mexican places in the Houston area and by far this is the best. I would and do recommend this place to everyone!

Pros: Great prices, good drinks and late hours.

Cons: Menu can be confusing.


 ★★★★★ Best nachos in town

It&apos;s been a while since i&apos;ve been to chacho&apos;s, but they have the absolute best nachos in town! i first went to here after a night of clubbing and fell in love with the nachos. it&apos;s a great place to hang out with friends and just chill and enjoy the food. i&apos;m definately overdue for a visit.


 ★★★★★ My favorite fast food restaurant!

 October 30, 2006 
This is the place to be! Great food for the value. The ambiance is perfect to kick off a night in town. Even if you get hungry after a nightclub you can stop by and grab one of their amazing quesadillas and call it a night. - I love this place. Open at all times and the food is very FRESH!

Pros: Great Margaritas!

Cons: Too crowded at times!


 ★★★☆☆ Decent 
by sara_m83 at Citysearch 3 Chacho&apos;s 
 September 12, 2006 
The food was decent, a bit unmemorable. What we do remember was sitting by the kitchen and looking at a storage cart sitting right next to our table with about 20 gallons of lard...that was enough to put you off in the middle of your meal.


 ★★★★☆ Not like it used to be 6 years ago 
by shervinj at Citysearch 4 Chacho&apos;s 
 July 09, 2006 
6 years ago Chachos was great. Pretty okay food for the price (huge portions), great drinks and a place you could bring your family to if you wanted to before the late hours. 6 years later it seems like a thug fest after 7pm arrives. The crowd is loud and rowdy and it no longer feels as safe as it did a few years ago. Now if we want food from here we only go through the drive though.

Pros: Nachos, portion sizes, margaritas

Cons: Safety, sometimes the place is dirty, wayyyyy to loud


 ★★★★☆ great drinks 
by malams at Citysearch 4 Chacho&apos;s 
 April 01, 2006 
this is the spot if you love margaritas like i do. the food is okay but the best is the chicken fajita nachos with queso sauce. mostly its over crowded and hard to find a seat on any night. maybe they could add other locations in the near future, maybe on 610 east.

Pros: margaritas

Cons: limited seating


 ★★★★★ I love this place!

This place is a staple for me! The food is good AND cheap! The margaritas are tasty and there&apos;s always a fun vibe in this quirky little restaurant! Go have some enciladas NOW!

Pros: good eats, cheap, margaritas


 ★★☆☆☆ Not what it used to be 
by k_stafford at Citysearch 2 Chacho&apos;s 
 January 22, 2006 
We used to go to Chacho&apos;s all the time, before it became so hugely popular. After having several bad experiences on weekend evenings with the deafening roar of the crowds of REALLY drunk people, we hadn&apos;t been there for a year or so, and went recently on a quiet weekday evening for an early dinner. The staff messed up our orders in several ways and were rude about it, including leaving the toppings off my husband&apos;s tacos (pineapple and pork tacos without the pineapple are kind of pointless). The food was still good and the margaritas cheap, but I think we won&apos;t go back again for a long while.

Pros: cheap, tasty

Cons: loud, rude, disorganized


 ★★★★★ yum!

chacos has the absolute best fajita burritos! they are soooo good. and make sure to order the 1/2 size unless u havent eaten in 2 days! alot of clubbers hang out here so its always packed at night.


 ★☆☆☆☆ I can&apos;t believe this place still stands 
by jcargle2002 at Citysearch 1 Chacho&apos;s 
 December 11, 2005 
I&apos;m amazed this place is still in business, the way they treat their customers. The only time I went, the cashier got my order wrong. When I tried to correct her, she very impolitely told me she did NOT get my order wrong and started to pick a fight. Then the manager rushed over and told me the cashier was not a stupid person (I never said she was) and had her armed thugs throw me out, without either giving me my food or reversing my credit card. They basically stole from me. I felt like Adam Sandler in Anger Management. I DID NOTHING WRONG!!! I was trying to ADD to my order!!! You know, buy more food, give them more money? And all they cared about was proving how &quot;right&quot; they were.

Their food might be ok. I wouldn&apos;t know. I was never given the opportunity to try it.

Cons: service

Cons: some long lines


 ★★★★★ Gluttony at it&apos;s best 
by cdarling20 at Citysearch 5 Chacho&apos;s 
 September 19, 2005 
Im sorry but the snack size portions are too much for me to eat lol. You will get full off of 5 bucks seriously. They do not skinp and everything is fresh which kind of makes you wonder why other joints around town jack up their prices for mediocre eats. Hmmmm!!!! ANyway chachos is great but I must warn if you want a quiet dining experience don&apos;t go there especially on the weekend after 1:00 the club crowd dominates this place. They go there b4 the club to drink cheap and after the club to eat, and look good in the parking lot. But if you are into the social crowd of Houston be my guest.

Pros: tasty, cheap, large portions

Cons: crowded, cant hold convo


 ★★★★★ cheap, good eats

chachos is great! i went there for the first time last week, and the food is truly authentic! we had the steak and chicken soft tacos and the meat was so tender and flavorful; the tortillas, fresh. the portions were sizeable for the price. the menu is so extensive, reaching all diet-types. the staff was so helpful and friendly. i went to the bar to pick up my drink and 3 different people asked if they could help me. i also ordered the watermelon drink, and it was freshly made, unlike those other places, where the fruit drinks are pre-made in a pitcher. the patrons looked like they have been coming back for years; their own little neighborhood hangout.

Pros: prices, food, atmosphere


 ★★★★★ what a place!

Chacho&apos;s is a great place to see how Houston is truly a melting pot! The food is great&amp;affordable. The JUMBO sized top shelf margaritas are a wonderful treat! And my 17 month old son loves this place!

Pros: great food, great prices, great margaritas

I really like Chacho&apos;s, their food is fantastic. If you are really hungry, then order their regular size. It&apos;s great. Some of my favorite choices are their fajita quesadillas, and the shredded beef taco salad. Their burritos are also great. Service is ok here, if they make a mistake, then they fix it, and no problem. The workers are friendly, and their margaritas are awesome, and huge!


 ★★☆☆☆ Its a wrap (literally)

This place is going down, service is boo boo for real....too crowded..staff does not comprehend orders nor offer apologies for making mistakes..yeah yeah the food is good but NOT THAT GOOD...hopefully Chachos will step their &quot;Customer Service&quot; Game up..if not, that will be their downfall..

Pros: food, drinks

Cons: , parking, too crowded

Chachosis is great! The food is Very good, the Margaritas are wonderful, and the price is right. Cool place to hang out. I give it a 10!

Chacho&apos;s has been a favorite of mine for a few years now. The food is always good, the prices always cheap. The salsa bar is incredible. The mango pico de gallo is simple but delicious. Only down side is the fact that you have to wait in a seperate bar line to get margaritas.

Pros: Inexpensive

Cons: Bar Line, Crowded

Chachos has become our favorite after hours spot for food or even a run by for a HUGE burrito that could feed a family of four. We love this place!


 ★★★★★ DEFINITELY WORTH IT!

The great thing about this place is the food! Very large portions, lots of flavor. They have a &quot;salsa bar&quot;, with about 6-7 different types of salsa - you can have as much as you want. No pre-prepared food - everything is made fresh on site. You can watch them make tortillas, etc. Pretty fast service, staff is helpful. Inside seating is crowded, plus noisy from the line moving through. Mostly patio seating. Two people can split the Corn Masa Lover&apos;s Plate for under $7.

Pros: Great Food, Low Prices, Salsa Bar

Cons: No free drink refills, Crowded inside, No outside lighting

Food is great. The beef is of good quality (not fatty or gristley) which is rare in Mexican restaurants, the portions are huge and cheap. Definitely a favorite. Wish there were more locations!!!

Cons: Only one location

I had went to Cchacho&apos;s with my boyfriend, because I heard they serve great mexican food, for a cheap price, plus it has been said to have a fun hanging out type of atmosphere. So we went, and I got a 1/2 size casadilla. And for just $2 something I that could feed two, and it was really great eating. I have been going back ever since!!! I deffinetly would recomend Chacho&apos;s.

Pros: inexpensive, big proportions, good selection

Cons: not romantic, at night its crowded
