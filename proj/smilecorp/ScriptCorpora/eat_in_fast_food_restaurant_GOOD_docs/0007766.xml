 December 15, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it i miss the old one by omnamahshivaya ( 56 reviews ) since they re-opened the new building... they have pretty much HIDDEN the value menu to make sure that no one sees it ! I raised the issue with one of the whoopty-whoop opening managers who gave me a fake b.s. business grin and said&quot;it&apos;s marketing.&quot; omfg. EVIL fast food corporation ! September 19, 2010 Doesn&apos;t like it Mobile review by Mike ( 13 reviews ) Worst fast food place EVER! 1 out of 1 found this review helpful January 26, 2009 Doesn&apos;t like it Dave Thomas would be ashamed... by ERiC AiXeLsyD ( 148 reviews ) Seriously. I know I&apos;&apos;ve said these words before about McDonald&apos;s... I get that it&apos;s only fast food, it&apos;s cheap, and that I shouldn&apos;t expect much... but holy cow, is this consistently one of the slowest&quot;fast food&quot;restaurants that I&apos;ve ever been to. Of course, like an idiot, I keep going back hoping that it might someday be an actual convenience. Let me share with you my latest adventure... Sunday morning, my wife&amp;I were on our way out to my Mom&apos;s house in the &apos;Burbs... so we thought we&apos;d get a quick bite to eat. It was nearing the 11:00am mark, so I knew we were going to hit the breakfast/lunch changeover. We skipped the McDormontonald&apos;s because the drive-thru line looked like rush hour in the Liberty tubes. Thankfully, Wendy&apos;s appeared to be a ghost town. There was hardly anyone inside, and there was one car ahead of us in the drive-thru but they were all the way up at the window. As we pulled up to the speaker to place our order, I asked if they were serving... more» Seriously. I know I&apos;&apos;ve said these words before about McDonald&apos;s...

Sunday morning, my wife&amp;I were on our way out to my Mom&apos;s house in the &apos;Burbs... so we thought we&apos;d get a quick bite to eat. It was nearing the 11:00am mark, so I knew we were going to hit the breakfast/lunch changeover. We skipped the McDormontonald&apos;s because the drive-thru line looked like rush hour in the Liberty tubes. Thankfully, Wendy&apos;s appeared to be a ghost town. There was hardly anyone inside, and there was one car ahead of us in the drive-thru but they were all the way up at the window. As we pulled up to the speaker to place our order, I asked if they were serving breakfast or lunch,&amp;was informed that they were serving both. So, I ordered the breakfast chicken sandwich combo, and the wife ordered the #2 bacon panini combo. After receiving the order in what would be considered a long wait in a normal fast food environment but translated to remarkably quick at this location, I pulled into a nearby spot to inspect the goods. (Sadly, a must any more.) We discovered that my order was fine, but the wife had received a sausage panini instead of the ordered bacon panini. I checked the receipt to see if I had mis-ordered the # of the combo. Nope. The receipt clearly stated BACON in that nifty dot-matrix receipt font. My wife&apos;s not a big fan of sausage patties, and she was reluctantly leaning toward just eating it because time was of the essence. I know I like to eat what I ordered&amp;paid for, so I went inside to get what I thought would be a simple swap-out. Oh my, was I wrong. My first encounter was with the young girl at the cash register. I politely stated that we had just gone through the drive-thru and that I wanted to exchange the sausage panini that we had received for the bacon one that we ordered. I was told that breakfast was over&amp;that hey couldn&apos;t make a bacon one. After a slight pause of disbelief and bewilderment, I told her that I had just been handed the sandwich less that a minute ago through the drive-thru window... and it had been made just seconds before that. She then yelled for her manager, and I stepped aside so she could help the next customer. Now, while never working at a fast food establishment, I do understand that changeover time is changeover time... something to do with eggs on the cooking surface and kitchen setup and all sorts of things that are surely beyond my comprehension as the average fast food consumer. After a wait the manager (coincidentally the very same person who handed me the order through the drive-thru window) came over and I again explained my situation... and he looked at me. Yes. Just stared blankly at me. For an awkwardly long time. I actually started to wonder if he understood English&amp;was capable of hearing. Compelled to break the silence, I even showed him the receipt that clearly said BACON. All caps. No confusion! Again, I was met with&quot;we&apos;re serving lunch now, we can&apos;t make that&quot;. OK. I understand. I get that. The point now is what can you do for me? I asked if I could get something else as compensation, and/or get my money back. (I think I was growing visibly frustrated by this point.) I called the wife, explained to her the complexity of the situation, and she decided upon a Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger. So, I asked for one of those... and waited... and waited... While a guy who had gone in line in front of me had ordered during my exchange with the manager was waiting too. After a while he exclaimed with multiple expletives that it was a ridiculously long wait, and how it was un-f&apos;n-beleivable that a fast food restaurant with 3 people in it and a packed kitchen could go so slow. I could hardly contain my laughter as I was also driven to the limits of my patience. After what was surely sufficient time to cook&amp;assemble 20 Jr. Bacon cheeseburgers, I received that, AND my money back for the sausage panini (which was now in the trash right behind the counter). So, I guess I got a free cheeseburger, hash browns&amp;a drink. I never did get any kind of apology, or admittance that they had messed up the order. (Which bewilders me that one can read bacon off of a screen and put down sausage... but I&apos;m certainly not above making mistakes... so I can&apos;t fault anyone for that.) I just find it amazing that they weren&apos;t apologizing from the start and presenting a solution instead of waiting for me to come up with one. You&apos;d think they&apos;d have a&quot;keep the customer happy&quot;policy in place. Don&apos;t they teach you any of this when you go to school to be a manager at Wendy&apos;s? Take mom n&apos; pop shops... if they screw up an order or take too long, they&apos;d give you a discount or a free drink or a coupon for next time... and they&apos;re certainly taking more of a profit hit than a chain that would do the same thing. At any rate, don&apos;t go to Wendy&apos;s in Dormont if you&apos;re in a hurry, or if you actually want what you ordered. December 15, 2011 Likes it Mobile review by colin ( 6 reviews ) this place has just been rebuilt, the food was good, so was the service but the cleaning is a disgrace, trash over-flowing, ketchup on the floor and the guy cleaning was so old that he couldn&apos;t even see the ketchup, it was everywhere. the place is very cold, yet they still had the AC on while it was 38 deg outside. visit at your own risk. October 26, 2011 Doesn&apos;t like it Just terrible...... by sgarv81 ( 4 reviews ) My husband and I stopped by this Wendy&apos;s after work one evening and we decided to go inside and order, since the drive thru window was long. What a mistake! The dining room looked like a hurricane hit it and the employees were out of control. lol My burger was cold and covered in ketchup, in spite of the fact that I ordered it&quot;plain&quot;. I took the survey giving them a terrible score and we did receive coupons.....which we used at a different location.
