VISION STATEMENT   The company&apos;s goal is that of a multi-faceted success. Our first responsibility is to the financial well-being of the restaurant. We will meet this goal while trying to consider;  the effect of our products on the health and well being of our customers (and our staff),  th e im pa ct th at ou r bu si ne ss pr ac ti ce s an d ch oi ce s wi ll ha ve on th e environment, and  The high quality of attitude, fairness, understanding, and generosity between management, staff, customers, and vendors. Awareness of all these factors and the responsible actions that result will give our efforts a sense of purpose and meaning beyond our basic financial goals. MISSION STATEMENT &quot;Change the way, food is served” Tom Peter’s, the Management Guru states: “Any business that does not change will be dead in five years”. 2008 will go down in history as the year of change, but still retailers who prefer the old days and are, alas, losing market share. Businesses don’t change for the sake of change, businesses generally change because the consumer either asks o r forces them to change. It is not the industry that is forcing change; it is you as consumers. of 00
