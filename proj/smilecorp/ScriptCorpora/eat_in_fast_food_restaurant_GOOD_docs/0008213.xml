 Tipping 

 Tipping is not expected in the UK, in the way it is in the United States or Canada, but is much appreciated.
 It is not necessary to tip at all in taxis, but it is customary to round up to the nearest pound on metered taxi journeys, more as a convenience than a tip. On an airport journey in a booked minicab you might wish to tip two or three pounds if the driver helps with your bags. If taking a metered London taxi from Heathrow the metered charge will be so high compared to minicabs, that this really is not necessary. Some restaurants add on an &apos;optional&apos; service charge to bills, of typically 10% or 12.5%. This should always be noted in the menu. If you are unhappy with the service you can ask for it to be removed. For parties of six or more the service charge is sometimes mandatory. If a service charge has been added onto your bill, you should NOT add any further tip. In cafes, buffets and coffee shops tipping is not usual. In restaurants with waiter service where no service charge has been added, you can leave a tip of typically 10%, according to how well you have been served, perhaps as much as 15% if it has been outstanding (but outstanding service is quite rare in the UK, partly because waiters are not expecting to be rewarded for it). Your hotel may or may not also add a service charge on. You should not add any tip to your bill, but as with any country in the world you should tip the porter if he brings your luggage to your room, two or three pounds is adequate, more than five pounds if you have no change would be grossly excessive. Tipping room service is not expected; if you wish to leave a pound or two for the chambermaid you can do so but it is probably better to do this before they clean it, as if you leave it when you leave your room may be cleaned by a different member of staff. Again, this is not necessary. If you are in a pub or bar/nightclub, it is not normal to tip the barperson. If you would like to tip, then it&apos;s customary to say &quot;...and one for yourself&quot; after you&apos;ve finished your order. You are actually inviting them to have a drink on you, but, in most cases, they will thank you and take a discretionary amount (anything from 20p to £2, depending on the size of the order). Again, it is entirely optional and certainly not expected of you. 

 Etiquette 

 Avoid controversial lines of conversation if you don&apos;t know the people you&apos;re talking to that well. Religion, racism, homophobia, and criticism of government are ones to avoid, the list is not limited to these, however. Avoid the middle finger or reverse peace signal (known as the V) whilst in the UK. They are both highly insulting and could land you in serious bother if used in the wrong situation. It should go without saying, but &apos;please&apos; after you ask for something, and &apos;thank you&apos; upon receipt are two phrases you should use. People generally get offended when these are not used and may not be forthcoming the second time round. When you first meet someone, a firm handshake and verbal greeting such as &apos;Hi, I&apos;m (your name), how are you?&apos;, usually breaks the ice well and makes people amenable. A limp handshake is perceived as rude and insincere. When talking or listening to someone, eye contact is a good idea. It shows interest and sincerity in the conversation. Don&apos;t stare at people. It is considered rude and will not go unnoticed. Don&apos;t discuss the cost of your possessions, how much your holiday cost etc. In the UK, people will get a bad impression of you and not warm to you at all.
 Smoking in all indoor public places (this includes platforms at train stations) in the UK is now illegal. Do not light up unless you are outside or in a designated smoking shelter. If you do light up in a shopping mall, pub or cinema, for example, you will find yourself thrown out rather swiftly and could get yourself fined or even arrested. Avoid talking loudly on your mobile/cell phone. It is considered highly ill-mannered, especially when in a quieter public place, such as a train, bus or library, and will probably earn you a stern rebuke mid-conversation. Excessive hugging and kissing in public is not appreciated either. A peck on the cheek or lips and an embrace are fine when you are saying hello or goodbye to someone close to you. The two classic signs a person would like to be left alone are reading a newspaper or listening to music through headphones. Only interrupt if you actually know the person. In the UK, people like to be on first name terms almost immediately. However, do not take this as a sign of life-long friendship, it&apos;s just a way of breaking the ice and opening up discussion.
 If you are addressed as &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Madam&quot;, it will generally indicated you are in a formal environment and you should behave as such.
 When eating in the UK, it is usual to use cutlery (fork, knife and spoon) in order to get food from plate to mouth. There are some popular meals, however, that don&apos;t need cutlery. This group include sandwiches, fast food meals (burgers, chips, kebabs, souvlakis) and curries (a flatbread called a naan bread is used instead to scoop the meal up). If unsure, observe the people around you for cues. Belching, burping and breaking wind are considered rude during a meal. If you have to, try to do so quietly or make apology and leave the room. If it is heard, excuse yourself.
 When you enter or exit a room or building and someone is following you, it is well received for you to hold the door for them. On escalators and moving pavements, stand to the right and walk to the left, as a general rule. When getting off or on a public transport vehicle, you must allow people to disembark before you board. This is a requirement of public health&amp;safety regulations and the driver/conductor can refuse you travel on the vehicle should you not comply. When waiting in line for an ATM, stand at least 1 metre (3ft) away from someone using the ATM to afford them privacy whilst carrying out their transaction. Try to move with the flow of pedestrians when walking in a crowded area. If you need to cut across, try to wait for a reasonable gap. If you are travelling on public transport, you will be asked by the driver to give up your seat if a pregnant woman or a person with reduced mobility should board. It is a legal requirement that you comply. The best advice is to offer your seat to these people before having to be asked. Never share your personal and/or bank details with strangers. Do use the proper nationality when referring to a resident of the United Kingdom. That is, remember that the nation actually comprises the English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish. Never refer to someone from say Scotland, as &quot;English&quot; as it is liable to offend. Either use the national origin (e.g. &quot;Scottish&quot;) or use &quot;British&quot; if you&apos;re not sure, except for in Northern Ireland (where it&apos;s easier to just avoid the issue of nationality altogether). When you join a queue, make sure you join it at the back and wait your turn. The British public do not take kindly to queue jumpers and will react in a number of different ways (from tutting and shaking their heads, to manhandling you out of the queue and, possibly, out of the establishment). When dining out in a busy premises such as a cafe or larger restaurant, you may be required to stand at the front of house to be seated by a waiter/waitress. In &apos;self-service&apos; establishments (e.g. sandwich shops, coffee shops), many consider it acceptable to ask your friends or partner to occupy the table waiting for you to arrive with your food, although some consider it rude as it may be preventing those who have already got their food from finding a table. 

Most members of the British public will happily provide you with directions if you approach them politely.  Make sure you are familiar with terms like roundabouts, level crossings, traffic lights, zebra crossings, bus lanes, contra flow, and, if using any of the motorways, traffic jams.

An easy way to begin a discussion with a stranger (in a pub, queue, train, etc) is to talk about the weather. All British people have an opinion on the weather and most can tell you what the weather is due to do for the next 4/5 days. Being knowledgeable about the British weather is an essential part of living / visiting here. You will sometimes see people carrying umbrellas (brollies) on roasting hot, sunny days because they know that it will rain intensely later in the afternoon for about 45 minutes. You ignore this expert knowledge at your own risk.  Remember - in Britain, there is no such thing as bad weather: there are only the wrong clothes. Avoid this by checking the forecasts, a good website for a 5 day outlook is http://news.bbc.co.uk/weather/
