 &apos;Young Invincibles&apos; On Life With Insurance Posted by wilmer on March 26, 2010 at 02:05pm 
 As heard on NPR&apos;s All Things Considered . 

Health care reform promises to make insurance more affordable, which is good news for 19-29 year olds. That demographic tends to earn the least money and have the fewest protections, making them the most uninsured group in the nation. Youth Radio talked to five uninsured young people from across the country, so called“Young Invincibles,”asking the question“what’s the first thing you’ll do, when you get health insurance?”

 Voices Include: Molly Adams of Chicago, Il, Javier Cabral of Los Angeles, CA, Kayla Sloan of Whitesburg, KY, and Nathan Hadden of Oakland, CA.

A note of caution before sinking your teeth into the idea of expanded federally sponsored dental coverage. While more protections will be offered to those younger than 21, for everyone else, dental insurance will be available through state-by-state exchanges. This bill doesn’t mandate carrying dental insurance.

If you dozed off during the endless debate over health care reform, it&apos;s time to perk up. Members of Congress are planning to make a decision on a health reform bill this week .

So what&apos;s happening now? After political changes in January stalled Democrats&apos; efforts to overhaul our health care system, President Obama stepped in. After February&apos;s televised health care summit, Obama said it was time for Congress to stop the endless debate on health care reform and take action. Democrats are worried that if they don&apos;t pass a health reform bill soon, reform will lose momentum as members of Congress break for Easter recess.

Obama has gone on the road to push for health reform, making his first stop at Arcadia University to rally support for reform. The Democratic party&apos;s leadership is counting votes (they need 216 votes in the House and 51 in the Senate to pass reform) and trying to convince members of their party who haven&apos;t agreed to vote for reform. Obama even took Dennis Kucinich, a Democratic Congressman from Ohio, for a ride on Air Force One to persuade him to vote for the health care reform. Republicans are mounting their own campaign to get lawmakers to vote against healthcare reform. Interest groups are dropping millions on advertisements to pressure lawmakers into voting against (or for) the bill.

While this is a big moment for health care reform, what actually happens in Congress this week may not be dramatic. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has suggested that members of the House of Representatives may try to approve the bill without technically voting on it , using a legislative tactic called the&quot;self-executing rule.&quot;If Congress passes reform, the way Americans access and pay for health care could change drastically. But this isn&apos;t our country&apos;s first attempt at changing our health care system. If Democrats can&apos;t get the votes they need --or find another legislative maneuver to pass reform--it&apos;s quite possible that we&apos;ll still have the same health care system we&apos;ve been complaining about for years.

At times, the health reform debate has reminded me of the noise a refrigerator makes -- after a while, you get so used to the monotonous hum in the background you automatically tune it out. If Congress doesn&apos;t pass reform now, the health care debate won&apos;t vanish. It will just keep humming in the background.

[UPDATE: The White House has starting posting the video in chunks . Part one is up, with more to follow.]

Riveting at points, boring as all hell at others, today&apos;s Health Care summit is the kind of politics we haven&apos;t seen before. The whole health care debate has been ugly, sometimes quite literally so. While there&apos;s been a fair amount of disingenuous arguments made around that table the crazy beautiful thing that happened today is this: we got to see them sit around that table. 

Oh sure we&apos;ve had CSPAN for ages, but can you really count footage from an empty Senate chamber as a real look at democracy? And yes, the politicians gave speeches to each other. We have to be a little patient, they&apos;re politicians after all. Anyone whose ever sat in on a high school debate tournament will recognize that the kind of person who grows up to be a politician isn&apos;t really trained to listen for anything but some leverage to use against the other guy. So it will take some time before this kind of thing produces real, rational discussion, but here&apos;s to baby steps.

Here&apos;s to America coming of age.

As most of us were sitting down in front of our TVs to watch the Super Bowl last weekend, President Obama announced he would hold a televised health care reform summit on February 25. The summit is aimed at bringing Democrats and Republicans back to the table to talk about health care reform. Reform has stalled since Democrats lost a Senate seat in January. 

If you haven&apos;t been paying attention, it&apos;s worth tuning back into the health care debate. What Congress decides to do -- or not do -- about health care will have a big affect on young adults, who are more likely to be uninsured than any other age group.

Aaron Smith, a Georgetown University law student and one of the founders of Young Invincibles , the youth advocacy group that&apos;s worked to get young people involved in the health care reform debate, says it&apos;s been challenging to keep young people engaged during the long debate. Smith says he thinks young people are looking for a signal that Congress is going to move forward with reform.

Krisja Hendricks, a 28-year-old New Yorker, says she hopes members of Congress will be able to&quot;put politics aside and focus on helping people get affordable health insurance.&quot;


Hendricks, who has struggled to get health insurance after suffering chronic illnesses, has been speaking out about health care reform since Rock the Vote asked its members to submit personal stories about health care last year. In October, she spoke in support of extending dependent health insurance coverage --the length of time young adults can stay insured under their parents&apos; health plans--at a press conference held by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.

With the Senate&apos;s one o&apos;clock in the morning vote to pass their version of health care reform now history, the United States lurches forward on the path to some kind of major overhaul in health care. While the rules of the game will be changing soon, the basics look likely to stay the same in the years to come: finding health insurance is going to be just as confusing and daunting a task as ever.

To help those who are just entering into the health care market understand what they&apos;re in for, we assembled a panel of our newsroom interns and let them question former health care industry reporter Emily Beaver. In this edition of&quot; Health Care Conundrums &quot;, Sarah Hamik asks if you need a job to get insurance coverage.

 As heard on NPR&apos;s Morning Edition. 

 By Brittany Hunsaker 

My nineteenth birthday was a bittersweet occasion. That day, I officially aged out of Kentucky’s insurance program for low income youth.

As luck would have it, I developed a health problem almost immediately. Pain in my teeth spread to my head and neck. Headaches made it impossible to concentrate in my college classes. I couldn’t see well enough to drive. Going to the doctor or dentist costs more than my weekly paycheck from a fast food restaurant. I had to choose between oral surgery and textbooks that semester. Textbooks lost, but luckily I made it through that class.

When it comes to healthcare, I do have options. Just not good ones. In the rural county where I grew up, it’s not just young people who don’t have insurance. Adults, unemployed or underemployed in minimum wage jobs are also without coverage. You can get healthcare there if you’re in a dire situation…like if you’re pregnant or recovering from drug addiction. I know a few girls who got pregnant just to afford a doctor’s visit, or had another baby just to keep their health insurance.

 Ten Health Care Terms You Need to Know Posted by rpereira on August 20, 2009 at 04:41pm 

By: Emily Beaver

 Maybe you&apos;ve heard President Obama talking about reforming health care or seen TV news reports about people protesting recent town hall meetings. But if you think health care reform doesn&apos;t impact you, it&apos;s time to tune into the debate.

One goal of health care reform is making sure that everyone can get health insurance, including young people. About 30% of Americans ages 19-24 don&apos;t have insurance, and one in seven teens doesn&apos;t have insurance, says Claire Brindis, Director of the Philip R. Lee Institute for Health Policy Studies at University of California, San Francisco .

Many young people aren&apos;t covered by their parents&apos; health plans, don&apos;t get insurance at work, can&apos;t afford to buy insurance or simply don&apos;t think they&apos;ll get sick . But if you get sick or injured when you&apos;re uninsured, you might not get the medical care you need or you may go into debt because of medical bills.

This week, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that under a health reform bill in the House of Representatives, young adults could stay insured under their parents&apos; plans through age 26 .

Members of Y.I. Want Change, a coalition of youth organizations formed by the Young Invincibles health reform advocacy group, and their supporters stood with Pelosi when she made the announcement at a press conference. The reform could be an important victory for young people.

&quot;It&apos;s important because as young people graduate from college and are struggling to find jobs in this economy, they need to have coverage and this provides them with an option,&quot;said Chrissy Faessen, vice president of communications and marketing for Rock the Vote . The organization is a member of the Y.I. Want Change coalition.

Right now, about 25 states allow young people to stay on their parents&apos; plans into their 20s. But in other states, young adults get dropped from their parents&apos; private health insurance plans, usually between ages 19 and 22. At age 19, most young people no longer qualify for Medicaid, a government health insurance program that provides coverage for very low-income children and parents.

If you&apos;ve been skipping dentist visits to save some cash, you&apos;re not alone.

Recent surveys say that many Americans, even ones who have dental insurance, skipped dental care in 2009 to save money . And people who don&apos;t have dental insurance, which is usually sold separately from health insurance, are even more likely to skip dentist visits.

Young adults, in general, are less likely to have health insurance than older adults or children . Many aren&apos;t offered health or dental insurance benefits at work -- and even when they are offered dental insurance, some young people choose to skip the extra expense of dental insurance . The Affordable Health Care for America Act, the health care reform bill U.S. House of Representatives passed Saturday , requires everyone to have health insurance, but it doesn&apos;t require everyone to have dental insurance.

&quot;People are more likely to spend money on health insurance and skip over dental insurance,&quot;says Keith Mendonsa, consumer expert at eHealthInsurance, a company that lets people search for and purchase individual health and dental insurance plans.

Richard Peterson has never been injured or seriously ill. So when Peterson, a 24-year-old law student, was dropped from his parents&apos; health insurance plan in 2008, he considered not buying insurance. Peterson could have gotten health insurance through his school, George Mason University in Arlington, Virginia, but the plan would have cost him about $100 a month. His wife gets health insurance at work, but getting added to her policy also would have been expensive, Peterson says.

Peterson didn&apos;t want to risk going without health insurance, so he searched online for individual health plans and found one that cost about half as much as the policy his school offered. He found a high-deductible health insurance plan at ehealthinsurance.com , a Web site that lets individuals and families search for health insurance plans.
