 Stenting vs. Bypass: What Are the Key Differences? 
 Understand the key differences between these two treatment options for coronary artery disease (CAD). Questions of the heart aren&apos;t only for romantics and pop musicians.

One of their most common dilemmas is whether to recommend stents or bypass surgery to patients with severe coronary artery disease (CAD). 
 Peripheral Arterial Disease: What You Need to Know 
 Up to 12 million people in the U.S. are currently living with this condition. Here are the risk factors and treatments options. So you have a cramp in your leg.

 5 Symptoms Men Ignore 
 Men can prevent health risks by paying attention to changes in their body and seeing their doctor when something isn&apos;t right.

 Health by the Numbers: Cholesterol 
 High cholesterol puts you at a higher risk for serious health conditions, including heart attack and stroke. Here&apos;s a look at cholesterol by the numbers.

Plaque comprised of cholesterol and other substances builds up in the arteries and causes a condition called atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries).

In 2007, the agency reported a possible association between rosiglitazone and an increased risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack.

 Heart Healthy Fats: What You Need to Know
