Mystery Shoppers always needed.
 
 Mystery Shopping , or Secret Shopping as it is sometimes known, is well established and a very large part of the Market Research Industry. It is a service used by the top retail outlets, leading entertainment / leisure organizations and banks.
 
Whenever you visit a major fast food restaurant or well known retail chain, have you ever wondered how they manage to maintain a consistent high level of service no matter how many branches they have and regardless of where they are in the world?
It is not left to chance. They all use mystery shoppers to pose as diners or buyers to evaluate the service at ground level. Thousands of ordinary people get paid to go shopping, eat out in a restaurant or just pop out for a drink. Fees per visit vary between
companies, but are usually between about CA$18.00 and $50.00. And of course expenses are paid - yes that really does mean that your food and drink is paid for as well.
 
You would choose which assignments are most suitable for you and work for one or more mystery shopping companies on a casual basis. Generally you would be paid a set amount per visit plus travel, parking and phone expenses. You would visit bars, supermarkets, steak houses and fast food restaurants to check out the service and fill in a simple questionnaire. This information is used to improve standards. Thousands of visits take place across the country daily.
Examples of some Restaurant / Bar questions for Secret Shoppers:

 Was the exterior clean and tidy?
 Was the interior clean and tidy?
 Did the staff member who served you make eye contact?
 Were you greeted?
 Were you served in a friendly manner?
 Were you served within two minutes of entry?
 Were you offered ice with your drink, if appropriate?
 Were you offered starters, side items, desserts or coffee?
 Was your food served within 15 minutes?
 Was your table cleared within five minutes of completion?
 Was the music appropriate for the type of venue?
