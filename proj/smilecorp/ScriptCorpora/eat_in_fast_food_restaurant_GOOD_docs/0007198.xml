Delivering real-time enterprise information to on-the-go professionals

Your managers, executives, doctors and salespeople canâ€™t be tied to a desk. To be effective, they have to be on the shop floor, with an important customer, at a patientâ€™s bedside or in the retail
 aisle. With the MC50 enterprise digital assistant, they have immediate access to the most current enterprise information, using both voice and data communications on a single device. Your employees
 gain the freedom of movement to serve customers and engage in data entry according to the immediate needs of your enterprise, increasing your response to changing conditions and helping all
 employees be more successful in their jobs.

 Business challenge Solution To make the right decisions about customer interactions, inventories and workflows, your managers must be able to send and receive timely information at the point of activity. Your managers gain uninterrupted access to enterprise applications with the wireless networking capabilities of the MC50, making them more productive and supporting fast and accurate decisions. Your managers occasionally need to assume a task-worker role to eliminate bottlenecks in your operations. Using the built-in scanning and imaging features of the MC50Â­, your managers are equipped to serve customers, check on inventories, perform line-busting activities and other process-oriented
 tasks without switching devices. An enterprise digital assistant has to stand up to the same tough environments as industrial devices. Unlike consumer-grade devices, the MC50 has a durable design to increase device uptime, as well as business-focused input options in support of efficient, accurate data entry. Your managers need to be accessible by phone, wherever they are working. Integrated voice over IP (VoIP) capabilities allow your managers to use the MC50 as a total communications platform, increasing individual productivity and eliminating the costs of buying,
 deploying and maintaining mobile phones. IT departments are already stretched thin; mobile devices add another level of maintenance and management for them to support. With the Symbol Mobility Services Platform built into the MC50, the management of mobile devices and applications is automated, reducing support costs and allowing IT departments to focus on
 core tasks. 
 
Redefine mobility for enterprise-class applications

The MC50 from Motorola is first in a class of mobile
computers that combines an enhanced PDA-style form
factor with optimal performance to operate enterpriselevel
applications. This small, lightweight mobile
computer features advanced data capture options,
flexible voice and data communication and easy
wireless local area network (WLAN) synchronization.

Increase productivity and gain access to
real-time information

With data capture, voice telephony, smart battery,
device level management, wireless and security
options, on-the-go professionals are empowered
to make rapid, informed decisions. This convenient
mobile computer delivers enterprise-class functionality,
including support for e-mail, phone, scheduling/
calendar, signature capture, CRM, sales force
automation and other enterprise applications.
With the MC50 in hand, retail store managers,
merchandisers and salespeople have the necessary
tool to create and maintain a competitive advantage.

Deploy and manage mobility systems
more effectively

The MC50 enables superior manageability and rapid
integration into new or existing IT infrastructures. Its
MicrosoftÂ® Windows Mobileâ„¢ software platform
offers compatibility with Microsoft, OracleÂ®, SiebelÂ®,
SAPÂ® and IBMÂ® customer relationship management
(CRM) software for easy, fast rollouts into any
environment. Adding mobility management
software allows you to quickly deploy and manage
thousands of MC50 devices with instant visibility
and control over all the mobile computers, wireless
networks and applications from an intuitive,
Web-based interface.

Enhanced durability for frequent, extended use

The MC50 is designed to be more durable than a
consumer-grade PDA. Extra reliability is built into
every aspect of the MC50 â€” from battery contacts
to keypads to acoustics â€” to ensure it exceeds the
performance demands of daily, high-volume usage.
Managers, supervisors and sales professionals can
feel more confident using the MC50 from anywhere
at anytime, whether it is on the road, on the sales
floor or at a customer site.

MC50 Enterprise Digital Assistant (EDA): Voice-centric features and capabilities

The MC50 delivers mobile voice and data inside the four walls in a single cost-effective, easy-to-carry device—ideal for retail store managers, merchandisers and sales personnel.

Voice services:

 Voice over WLAN (VoWLAN ) 

Voice functionality:

Peer-to-peer (direct device to device calls)
1-to-1 (device to device paging)
1-to-many (walkie talkie style communications)
IP Telephony (extension of PBX desk phone functionality)

Voice modalities:

Speakerphone
Headset
Handset

Voice-specific features:

Dedicated voice buttons for ease of use and a true phone-style voice experience:

 Push-to-talk (PTT) button SEND and END buttons Volume Up/Down key 

Voice mode-related features:

 Tap-to-toggle icon enables instant re-routing of audio between handset and speakerphone modes Front receiver and microphone support handset use Back loudspeaker supports speakerphone mode Call notification by ringer (audio), LED (visual) and vibration (touch) function enables users to select the mode most suitable as the working environment situation changes. For example, when salespeople on the retail floor are with a customer, vibrate mode eliminates any perceived interruption by the customer yet allows the worker to still receive incoming calls Flexibility to choose the headset style that is most comfortable: 2.5mm standard headset jack provides support for headset mode and enables use of standard phone headsets 

Voice quality-related features:

 Mechanically and acoustically designed to deliver outstanding voice quality and functionality in all user modes. Intel®XScale™520MHz processor provides the power to support simultaneous voice communications and data capture/applications. Users can place a call to obtain needed information while scanning bar codes or entering information into a business application. SIP-based partner applications are supported, which work in conjunction with the wireless LAN to ensure quality of service (QoS) for voice calls. Acoustic Echo Cancel (AEC) eliminates the annoying echo which often occurs on consumer PDAs in speakerphone and handset modes. Smart power management through Motorola-only features ensure ample battery power for full shift talk time by reducing unnecessary broadcast traffic, allowing the device to remain in a low-power mode without missing voice calls or data messages. Fast Wi-Fi roaming via unique and patented Motorola features ensures little or no interruption during VoWLAN calls over Motorola wireless LANs. For example, pre-emptive roaming and load balancing work to ensure users roam to the next access port before connection quality erodes. 

A full selection of standard and vertical market voice and data accessories, including:

 Belts, holsters and hand straps provide convenient &quot;wearability&quot; Wide variety of cradles for charging devices and batteries Magnetic stripe reader for a wide variety of on-the-spot transactions, from executing purchases to swiping a customer loyalty card to view information to best serve the customer 

Data capture capabilities:

1D and 2D bar code scanning

Wireless networking:

Easy integration with any Wi-Fi 802.11b wireless LAN

Manageability:

Motorola&apos;s Mobility Services Platform (MSP) dramatically reduces the cost and complexity associated with the management and deployment of enterprise-wide mobility.

Recommended industries:

Manufacturing, healthcare and hospitality
