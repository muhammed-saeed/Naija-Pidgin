Comments about Folding Purse Caddy :

I had ordered the purse caddy first for myself; I liked it so well that I ordered one each for two friends, when the caddies arrived they weren&apos;t in a box with a carrying pouch like mine was, instead, they were in cellophane bags.
When I opened them I found that one was broken&amp;the other had&quot;jems&quot;missing. I was very disappointed because other merchandise that I have ordered from Miles Kimball has been excellent quality.

Comments about Folding Purse Caddy :

This purse holder is so cute with the sparkly stone purse on it.I got it for my daughter&apos;s birthday because she always seems to have a new purse. I have one and its great for hanging your purse from a table to keep it off the floor. Makes a great gift.

Comments about Folding Purse Caddy :

I have been looking for a small purse holder ever since I set my purse on the floor by my table at a local fast food restaurant and there was some kind liquid on the floor. The purse was fairly new and was stained on the bottom. This purse caddy works great and I would highly recommend it to anyone. I was leery at first, but it is a great product and holds a fairly heavy purse... It folds into a compact circle and does not take up much space in the purse.

Comments about Folding Purse Caddy :

Ladies
If you have never had a purse caddy, this one is a must. There is no need to sit your purse on the chair/floor worrying if you might lose it or if someone can take it. It is stable and stylish. Do your self a favor at least buy one caddy. If you do purchase one, it is guaranteed that you will buy more. They make great presents as well.
 
 Bottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friend
