 Download   ntroduction McDonald’s is comprised of more than 30,000 local restaurants and serves 52 million people in more than 100 countries each day [1] . The company is the largest food retailer in the world and is part of the American way of life. In order to remain competitive and an iconic American institution , McDonald’s has developed programs and strategies for motivating employees and teaching leadership. As a result, our group believes that McDonald’s presented an excellent opportunity to observe organizational behavior in action. In this observational study, we sought to discover what leadership techniques and group skills were actually practiced by McDonald’s employees. Our field study entailed visiting four different McDonald’s stores in the greater Rochester area during distinct shifts ranging from early morning to late night. During each visit, a group member made a purchase and sat at a table where one could observe the behavior of managers and employees and customer interactions, without interfering with normal operations. Due to the fact we were restricted to a small sample of McDonald’s restaurants, we could not capture the complete spirit of the corporation. However, we were able to relate our findings to leadership and organizational behavior theories and some of McDonald’s corporate values. Through a series of observations and corporate research we discovered that McDonald’s employees demonstrate quality leadership and that the organization as a whole puts significant effort into motivating and working for its employees. Corporate&amp;Work Culture When analyzing an organization’s leadership and teamwork skills, it is useful to first analyze the organization’s work culture and how this culture is maintained. The work culture of McDonald’s seems highly dependent upon the particular line manager in charge at any given point in time. One would imagine that the manager would almost always use position power and would use a telling style of leadership since the typical employee is young or inexperienced. Indeed, some managers were observed as running the operations in a machine like manner, especially during peak business periods. However, in the majority of cases the managers were relatively relaxed and sometimes were indistinguishabl e from the other employees. One manager in particular used a selling approach, which indicates a higher readiness level of her team (Daft, 2008, p. 73). She did not simply give orders, but accepted feedback and alternatives to her decisions. While it was obvious she was the manager, her team was obviously in the later stages of development and was comfortable outside of their predefined roles. ntroduction For our project we have decided to analy ze McDonald’s. We propose to look at how McDonald’s has attempted to change their image through marketing strategies over 1   the years. They have done this in a variety of ways, not just wit h their products. For example, they changed packaging on their products to become more environmentally safe. They have also created new menu it ems in the past 10 years in order to offer some “healthy” options to those wat ching their waistlines. This is an effort to appeal to customers who might have disregarded McDonald’s in the past because of traditional stereotypes. They have done this in a vari ety of ways usi ng the four P’s and are attempting to change soci ety’s perceptions. Many people today are unhappy with McDonald’s and their “unhealthy” food, and we were interested to see if the current marketing strategy that McDonald’s is using is creating a positive change for the company. History McDonald’s, now known world wide as one of the major powerhouse’s in the fast food industry, began i n San Bernardino on May 15, 1940. It originated as a bar beque restaurant under the ownership of brothers Dick and Mac McDonald, and soon evolved into a teen hangout generating 80% of it s revenues from hamburgers alone. In 1948, McDonald’s switched gears and increasingly targeted the young family market, developing its operation concepts around speed, lower prices, and higher volume. They ran under the slogan of “speedy service systems,” selling their hamburgers with fries for an astonishing 25 cents. In 1954 Ray Kroc, a previous restaurant owner, saw potential for growth in the company and capitalized on it convincing the McDonald brothers to franchise the company with his financial support. In 1963 McDonald’s introduced Ronald, a fun loving clown, to promote their restaurant as a family establishment, and he became a huge success. In fact, Ronald is now an icon symbolizing the McDonald’s firm. As the restaurant continued on its upward spiral toward success, they decided to go public for the first time in 1965 offering one hundred shares of stock for $2,2 50 dollars. In today’s market, that is equivalent to 74,360 shares worth over $1.8 2   million (www.mcdonalds.com). In effort to give help to those who are in need, McDonald’s collaborated with the Philadelphia Eagles’ Fred Hill and created the Ronald McDonald House in 1974. At the house, families of critically ill children are given a home away from home while thei r kids are treated. Today, McDonald’s is the l eading foodservice retailer with more than 30,000 locations in over 119 countries, and is a symbol of American culture. Historical Reputation McDonald’s was the fir st fast food rest aurant on the scene. There have been many imitators over the years, but it has historically been number one. Since its first opening in 1940, the business has boomed into an international craze. Historically, McDonald’s has been viewed as the pinnacle and one of the defining features of the American lifest yle. Burger, fri es, and a Coke were the traditional meal. Once it spread globally, it boomed into popularity because other countries wanted to be associated with the successful image of the “ American dream”. It was not until recently, within the l ast 15 years, that people began to question the health and safety of the fast food industry, and have been focusing on McDonald’s because it is an easy target. When a company is that large, it is a natural target for inner directed consumers, and those who wish to upset the conformist lifestyle. Reputation Today Though all this talk about “poor health” and “risk” associated with McDonald’s seems bad for the business, we set out to see if it was really hindering their success today. McDonald’s is, after all, still t he most prevalent and recognizable fast f ood establishments in the worl d. The health aspect has actually spr ead out of the United States and become a global issue. According to All Headline News, McDonald’s saw a profit loss of 14 percent last quarter. It was the biggest loss the company has had since 2002. This may seem like an indication of their dropping popularity; however it was actually not related to their 3 of 00
