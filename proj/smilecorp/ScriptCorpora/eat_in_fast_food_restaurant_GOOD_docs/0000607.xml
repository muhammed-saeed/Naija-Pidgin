No. 1 Panera Bread

 Over 1,230 locations nationwide (and in Canada) 

This bakery-cafe-based eatery wowed our judges with a comprehensive menu of healthy choices for every meal.

 Panera also won top honors for kid fare, dishing out RD-approved crowd-pleasers like squeezable organic yogurt, PB&amp;J;(with all-natural peanut butter), and grilled organic cheese on white whole-grain bread.

 We love: Delicious, nutrient-packed combos like a half–Turkey Artichoke on focaccia bread with a bowl of black bean or garden vegetable soup.
 Danger zone: Sticky buns and cheese danishes are on display at the counter.
 
 Next: No. 2 Jason’s Deli
