CASPER, Wyo. (AP) -- The Wyoming State Patrol has arrested three Wisconsin teens after a 73-mile car chase.

The patrol says the three were in a Ford Focus reported stolen in Sparta, Wis. They were pulled over for speeding on Wyoming 220 south of Casper Wednesday night.

The patrol says the car drove off while the trooper waited for backup.

Other troopers laid spikes in the car&apos;s path just north of Rawlins, forcing it to stop with flat tires.

The two passengers were arrested after a short foot chase. The driver was arrested about 12 hours later in a fast-food restaurant in Rawlins.

All face charges of possession of stolen property and being parties to a crime. The driver also faces charges of eluding, interference with a peace officer and driving while under suspension.
