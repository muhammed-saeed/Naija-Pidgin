 Fast-food restaurants outsource order-taking
 
 McClatchy Newspapers Published Tuesday, January 27, 2009 
CHARLOTTE, N.C. - That crackling voice taking your order at a fast-food drive-through might come from a lot farther away than the restaurant: Try Texas or even overseas.
San Diego-based Jack in the Box has tested outsourced drive-through order-taking since mid-2008 at seven of its 30 Charlotte, N.C.-area restaurants. Spokeswoman Kathleen Anthony declined to specify the locations, though workers at the Cotswold restaurant in Charlotte recently said it uses the system.
The technology is intended to improve speed, accuracy and service, freeing up restaurant employees to process orders, accept payment and address other needs, Anthony said. The chain has not reduced staffing as a result of the remote order-taking, and the restaurants can turn the system on and off as they wish, she said.
Still, its piqued curiosity among local customers who have encountered heavy accents with order-takers, then rounded the bend to find different people handing them food.
&quot;I had noticed it&quot;several months ago,&quot;but I just thought the person taking the order was somewhere else in the store where we couldnt see them,&quot;said Elizabeth Banks, a Charlotte teacher and mother of three who takes her 15-year-old daughter and her daughters friends to Jack in the Box for Oreo milkshakes most Friday afternoons.&quot;It never occurred to me they might be out of the country.&quot;
At one point the girls asked the order-taker,&quot;Where are you?&quot;There was a pause, Banks recalled. Then, the person on the other end said,&quot;Texas.&quot;
&quot;I really dont think thats where they were,&quot;Banks said.
The Jack in the Box test orders are routed to a Texas call center operated by Bronco Communications, a company specializing in fast food order-taking, Anthony said. Some might be routed outside the United States, she said, but she wouldnt specify where.
Companies began trying remote ordering in 2005. As with outsourcing in other industries, technological advances - namely high-speed Internet - made it possible. When customers pull up to the menu, a call center worker takes the order on a computer. The order pops up on a screen inside the restaurant.
Even where people have grown accustomed to seeing bank and computer questions directed overseas, international order-taking is rare in the realm of cheeseburger combos and large Cokes, said Sherri Daye Scott, editor of QSR Magazine, dedicated to the quick-service restaurant industry.
A greater number of restaurants, including McDonalds and Wendys franchisees, have tried centralized order-takers within the United States. None has introduced the technology nationally, in part because theyve found it difficult to prove it saves money, Scott said. The parent company of Hardees has conducted a limited test, too.
Other chains said they have not tried it and dont plan to at this point, including Burger King and Taco Bell, spokespersons for both said.
Jack in the Boxs Anthony declined to discuss the results of the Charlotte trial, noting that the company doesnt speak in depth about its tests. Though the local run is wrapping up soon, Jack in the Box will continue to try the approach in other markets&quot;here and there,&quot;Anthony said.
Customers such as Banks said the system can sound a bit distant: After all, fast-food order takers arent always the easiest to hear even when theyre around the corner, let alone around the world. But it hasnt posed any other issues, and the speakers are very polite.
Even so, she noted, it hasnt bothered her family so much that theyve stopped visiting for milkshakes.
&quot;We just kind of laugh about it when we go through there: Oh, theres a guy in Texas again,&quot;Banks said.
