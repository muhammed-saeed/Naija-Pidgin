ABOUT ASHLEY
 
 Age: 23

 Occupation/Post-Secondary program: Human Resource Management Student

 Hometown: Edmonton, Alberta 

 Hobbies: Running, yoga, event planning, anything where I could use a label maker, watching re-runs of Friends and obviously spending time with friends and family.

 Why you love hockey: Hockey has always been commonplace in my circle of friends and with my Dad. I love watching them all argue and critique the players and teams. But I guess you could say I love hockey because of Jason Arnott.

 Life Lesson: We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.
 
Favourite thing about Oil Country: The emotion and the buzz in this city is great when the Oilers play. The passion of the fans just brings everyone together on game nights and that&apos;s an incredible feeling.

 Dancing/Cheer Leading since: I cheered and danced when I was younger and missed it so much I thought this would be a great opportunity for me to get back into it.

 Highlights of your dance/cheer experience: I can honestly say the biggest highlight has been meeting amazing friends - simple as that.

 Cool fact about Ashley: The key to my heart is a #6 combo from my favourite fast food restaurant.
