Atmospherics: Marketing Straight To The Brain

One concept that I’ve always thought fascinating in the world of marketing is the concept of atmospherics. Atmospherics is the art of stimulating the five senses to psychologically influence people’s behavior(s). Put simply, it’s the guerrilla marketing strategy that involves manipulating the environment to attract/retain customers. In the many marketing courses I’ve taken, it’s a sad shame that it was only briefly mentioned in only one of my classes, Consumer Behavior. It’s a really interesting concept, as it is something that’s very observable in every day life.

For example, fast-paced and high-energy music playing in gyms and dance clubs. The fast tempo has a higher frequency which affects the brain in a way that influences people hearing the music to be a little more on edge, a little more anxious, and more tempted to move about. Contrast this with slower, elevator-type music. It’s a bit more relaxing, a bit more calming. It’s very effective, especially in shopping malls and some dine-in restaurants. The slower tempo and lower frequency of the music affect the brain in a way that gets people in the mood to just relax, enjoy the moment, and enjoy the shopping.

Faster music tends to get people to be more anxious, and likely end up spending less time in an area. And slower music tends to get people to stick around longer. The longer a customer spends in a store = more opportunities for the customer to spend money. On the other hand, some businesses prefer customers to be in and out relatively quickly, and may likely try to create an environment that is less hospitable in a sense.

One prominent example of a business abusing the hell out of this strategy is Abercombie&amp;Fitch. When walking around a mall, you happen to approach the A&amp;F store. But before you can even reach the storefront, your nose is immediately assaulted with the smell of their signature cologne/perfume/o-zone-killing-aerosol pheromones. I’m not really sure what they were aiming for, maybe trying to make their place smell like sex? HAHA I’m kidding (not really). Some people are attracted to the smell of baby prostitutes. I, on the other hand, detest the smell. It gets hard to breathe around the A&amp;F stores. I don’t know how those middle-of-the-mall island shop representatives can stand being situated so close to or in front of the A&amp;F storefront. But anyway, I digress…

Lighting is another very cool thing to toy around with. Very nice, upscale restaurants like to have low, dim lighting to create a more romantic feel. Customers tend to stay longer, enjoy their experience more, and spend more money, or come back again and again. Ever notice how many fast food restaurant chains have the most uncomfortable, ugly furnishings imaginable, not to mention the cheap, fluorescent lighting and odd-colored floors and walls? That, my friends, is no accident.“Fast food”literally means fast food; go in, buy food, eat it, leave.

Now, I’m no expert on the subject; I wish I could get acquainted with someone who is. It’s really intriguing, fascinating stuff. It almost seems so common-sense, but it’s really effective, I’d say. If someone were to start a business, like a restaurant or spa, if they can manage to effectively implement the use of atmospherics (I’d gather they most certainly need to be very effective at this, or else fail miserably), the entrepreneur can expect to be very successful.

Well, this had me thinking…it’s a very good idea to develop a brand for one’s self (I’ll talk about personal branding sometime in the future). Creating a unique, personal logo and creating a sort of unique, identifiable image for one’s self is like creating a brand. What if one were to implement atmospherics into personal branding, and take it very seriously? Like what if someone went so far as to smell like a specific scent.

People buy colognes and perfumes, and people wear them like they wear clothes. And I can sometimes smell people before I even see them and just know that that particular person is in the area (Kind of like how you know you’re getting close to the baby prostitute store before you even make it there when you walk around a mall). This is not uncommon. But imagine if people were to actually leverage that in a way professionally. Like, they can market themselves to employers effectively by taking advantage of scents, sounds, etc. Hmm……………………………
