The restaurant business is the only business I know where there are more ways to lose money than to make it.

And speaking of losing money, the two areas that consistently present the greatest challenge to profitability month after month and year after year are: controlling labor costs and reducing employee turnover. Instead of suggesting a method that will reduce labor costs 10 percent, I&apos;d like to suggest 10 different ways to lower your costs 1 percent each.

There are many books on how to control labor from a bean counter&apos;s point of view, but here are some common-sense alternatives to controlling labor from a human resource perspective. All of the ideas have been successfully used at our six Denver-area restaurants, so you can be assured they&apos;re based on application, not theory:

(1) Institute bonuses. Some employees seem to worship absenteeism. To them, Jimmy Hoffa is a role model. To reduce your no-shows, offer servers and cooks a free pay day or two movie tickets if they&apos;re not sick or tardy for a 30- or 60-day period. Reward the behavior you expect.

(2) Share the numbers. Teach of all your employees the math of controlling monthly labor costs and show them the importance of clocking in and out promptly. Then offer them a team bonus if they collectively bring labor costs in their department below a targeted percentage. Perhaps share 1 percent of the saved labor costs with the staff, incrementally based on the number of hour each employee worked during the costs-cutting period.

(3) Pair up servers in a buddy system. Covering shifts can be a considerable labor drain in terms of dollars lost and headaches generated. A buddy system can plug that drain. Have two servers agree to be each other&apos;s shift cover buddy over the next 30 days or next six months. When a servers is unable to make a scheduled shift, he telephones his shift buddy first before he telephones the manager.
 
(4) Discuss your labor goal&apos;s progress daily. Set specific monthly labor targets and break them down into the daily goal you must be managing. Highlight it every day by reviewing &quot;how we&apos;re doing&quot; laborwise at a preshift team meeting. Specifically recite the targeted clock-out times for each employee. What you reinforce is what you get.

(5) Always Answer the question &quot;What&apos;s in it for me?&quot; To get employees past a problem, involve them in the solution. At your next employee meeting have your service and kitchen staff break into groups and list 10 ways they could collectively keep labor costs down. For the best idea, offer a bounty of 1 percent of the total savings over a year.

Give them $15 cash immediately as a down payment on the reward. That technique results in a flurry of regularly generated cost saving ideas, not only for labor but also for food and beverage costs.

(6) Reward your student workers for the best grade point average. For instance, offer a bonus of 10 cents per hour for every student who maintains a GPA between 2.5 and 3.0 during that high-school or college semester. Offer a 25-cent-per-hour difference to the employee at the end of the semester and let the school and your community newspaper know about it.

While this idea may not necessarily reduce labor costs, it fosters collaboration, recruits other students, builds loyalty and reduces turnover.

(7) Reward longevity with bonuses. Michael Fuller at Chevy&apos;s Restaurants tells me that the chain rewards kitchen employees with $100 for one year of service, $200 for two years and so on. The check is accompanied with a bronze, silver, gold or platinum pin for each year of service and public recognition from the newspapers and their colleagues.

(8) Consider a deferred bonus plan for managers. How do you keep your best supervisors form leaving to work for another restaurant? Set a specific annual sales goal for your restaurant. Offer managers a 2 percent bonus in addition to their regular incentive for every year that the store&apos;s sales exceed agreed-upon targeted goals, but the 2-percent bonus is payable only after the manager has stayed with your operation for three years.

This system is sometimes jokingly referred to as &quot;silver handcuffs.&quot;

(9) Turn over applicants, not employees. The best way to control your labor costs effectively is to hire the right person to begin with. When you&apos;re checking references, be sure to ask about the absenteeism record. Use mystery applicants to inspect your hiring process and evaluate your manager&apos;s interviewing skills.

After hiring a person, make the first 30 days count. This is the crucial time frame where an employee will stay or leave. Assign a &quot;shepherd,&quot; a trainer who will help the new employee adjust in and adapt to your operation.

(10) Recognize contributions. When cooks, servers or managers periodically put in long hours or lots of doubles, acknowledge what they have done with a thank-you card or gift certificate. Don&apos;t forget their spouses or family. Send a thank-you card, flowers or a gift certificate to the people at home who emotionally support your hard-working staff. I remember a cook once saying, &quot;Nobody appreciates what I do until I don&apos;t do it.&quot;

Cost savings is a wonderful thing. It&apos;s what separates private industry from the government. I hope these ideas work for you. Until next time, remember: You are where you eat.
