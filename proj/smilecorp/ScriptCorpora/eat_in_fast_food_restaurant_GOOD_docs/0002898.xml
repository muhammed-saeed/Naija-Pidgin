How to Start a Pub Restaurant


 Are you looking for a chance to run a pub restaurant? The surge of travelers, backpackers and tourists visiting places all over the world poses one great opportunity to become an entrepreneur. We offer you valuable fundamental knowledge on this kind of business. 

Perhaps you&apos;ve noticed how lucrative the hospitality and food industries are. Amid the global economic crunch, people continue to spend for food, travel and accommodation. The reason? There is a great need to once in a while distance from the bustles of city life.

 

Those with entrepreneur mindset look at this phenomenon as a profitable venture. If you&apos;re planning to open a pub restaurant, let us help you with the basics.

Profitability of the Business

Running a pub restaurant is not just profitable, it opens doors for you to learn about different cultures and people because tourists and travelers from around the world are your primary customers. Pub or public house is a place for drinking and eating. When a pub offers lodging, it becomes an inn or hotel. Pubs are traditionally licensed to offer drinks in regions where selling and drinking of alcohol is prohibited. Today, there is little difference between pubs, bars, inns, and hotels where alcohol is served.

Positioning of the Business

A pub restaurant is frequently visited by tourists to have merry-making and to relax. You must know that this kind of business normally operates at night until early dawn. Sales are stronger at night and during the weekends. You have to position your business right where the demand is - in the city or in the countryside where tourists and travelers flock. Backpackers and travelers who are budget-conscious and wish to spend more nights in the locality are likely to resort to staying in pubs with lodging.

Putting Up the Business

After finding a strategic location, obtain the necessary business licenses/permits. Decide on the pub layout. Pubs almost always offer some form of entertainment like gaming, singing and sport. Your pub restaurant may have a smoke room (indoor smoking area) in addition to the traditional counter, beverage bar, kitchen and dining area. As a restaurant, you should put emphasis on food, which is different from the simpler bar snacks. You&apos;re bound to offer lunch, dinner and midnight meals so decide your menu carefully. Hire a competent cook if you don&apos;t want to do the cooking yourself. Common pub food includes pies, chips, nuts, hot pots, roasts, burgers and spicy dishes.

You also need to decide which equipment to purchase, depending on the layout you&apos;ve chosen. Basic wares and equipment for your pub restaurant include glass and silverware, sinks, racks, taps, beverage dispensers, cooler, freezer, ice bins, ice maker, coffee maker, dishwasher, cabinets, shelves, serving trays, kitchen and dining utensils. To serve freshly brewed beer, you need brewing equipment, of course.

The startup costs for a pub restaurant is at least $100,000. The more intricate the design, the greater is the cost.

Promoting the Business

Provide quality service, tasty food, lots of alcoholic beverage choices, affordable prices, and fine ambience for merry-making. As a public place, patrons will do the advertising leg work for you through word-of-mouth. Placing ads on magazine, newspapers, yellow pages, and Website helps.
