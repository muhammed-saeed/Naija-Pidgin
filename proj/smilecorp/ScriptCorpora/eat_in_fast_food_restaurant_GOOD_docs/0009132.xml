 How to Follow a Low Sodium Diet 

Edited by StuRat and 23 others 
 Pin It Article Edit Discuss History 
According to both the American Heart Association and the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health healthy adults should consume less than 1500 milligrams of sodium per day. Unfortunately, most individuals consume more than 3000 mg of sodium a day, resulting in over 70 percent of Americans risking an elevated potential for heart attack, stroke, and other forms of cardiovascular disease. [1] Even just one teaspoon of salt contains approximately 2000 mg of sodium, and a single item from a fast food restaurant can contain that much (for example, a KFC chicken pot pie has 2160 mg). [2] Yet, while we&apos;re consuming on average around a half ounce of salt each day, we would function fine on simply a fifth of that amount! [3] 

Since chronic excess sodium is associated with hypertension and other debilitating conditions, looking for ways to keep your sodium intake under control makes good health sense. An acute sodium overdose may cause immediate medical symptoms, such as cracked, bleeding lips, nausea, and, in extreme cases, death. [4] If you&apos;d like to reduce or even remove salt from your diet, here are some suggestions to help you in that endeavor.

 Edit Steps 
 
 1 Try it without salt - you might like it. Learn to taste your food in its natural or cooked state . Always try your food before adding salt. If you&apos;re the type who habitually salts your food, reach for the fork before you reach for the salt and relearn to appreciate the flavor of food without salt. After an initial surprise at what seems bland, this will soon fade and you&apos;ll grow to realize how easily salt masks the true and delicious flavors of food. And be prepared to take a bit of time for things to change – it will take two to three months for your senses to stop craving salt. However, the good news is that taste buds adapt very quickly and within three weeks you should be able to discern a real difference in the taste of food and begin to find the addition of salt unpleasant. [5] During the time of adjustment, rely on halving the amount of salt used and season highly with the suggested substitutes discussed below, as your new sense of flavor appreciation develops. 
 Appreciate the basics. A slice of wheat bread, even unbuttered, has a grainy taste to it, but it may also be slightly sweet. 
 2 Recommended reading. Read the food labels and visit websites to learn about the sodium content of foods you consume regularly . A little knowledge about the sodium content of the food you eat daily can go a long way to convincing you of the need to cut back on too much salt. When shopping for groceries, start the habit of reading the label to find the sodium content. A good rule of thumb is to compare the listed number of calories per serving with the number of milligrams of sodium, and to avoid products where the sodium number is greater than the calorie number. Assuming a 2500 calorie-a-day diet, this strategy should keep you within the recommended sodium range.
 Sodium comes in a range of forms and it is all salt; when reading labels, look for sodium, sodium benzoate, sodium nitrite, sodium sorbate etc. and avoid these additional sources of salt. Sea salt , rock salt and flavored salts are still salt; avoid them. Keep an eye on condiments. Soy sauce, ketchup, mustard, peanut butter, and various other things you might slather on have salt in them; read those labels, too. Many restaurants have websites with nutritional information with respect to their usual meals or products, including sodium content. One helpful general website which lists nutritional data for fresh foods, processed foods, and many fast food restaurants is http://www.nutritiondata.com . 
 

 

 Home cooking and eating 

 1 Cut back on salt in your home cooking. Cut back on salt in your home cooking . Stop adding salt to your cooking unless it is absolutely necessary. Halve the amounts that recipes suggest and keep halving. If possible, add salt near the end of the cooking process or just before eating. This way, less salt will suffice since there is less time for it to penetrate into food.
 Don&apos;t add salt to boiling water. You may wish to make an exception for cooking pasta, since a bit of salt raises the boiling point and you will generally drain most of the water. 
 2 What can you use in place of that salt? Evaluate seasonings for sodium content . Many products, such as bullion and stock cubes, bacon bits, grated parmesan or Romano cheese, and assorted &quot;seasonings&quot; are mostly salt, so avoid those, whenever possible (instead of ketchup, mustard and pickle, try lettuce, onion and tomato on your burger). For products which include a separate &quot;seasoning packet&quot;, the amount of the packet used can be reduced or it can be eliminated entirely. For example, ramen noodles , especially baked Ramen noodles, can be reasonably healthy, provided you don&apos;t use the entire contents of the seasoning packet. However, these flavorings and &quot;seasoned salt&quot; are still better than adding straight salt, even if only slightly. 3 Add non-salty seasonings in place of salt. Add non-salty seasonings in place of salt . There is a range of delicious alternatives to salt that you can add into your diet to help you move away from salt. These include:
 Herbs - fresh and dried, not stale Spices - good, fresh and in-date Lemon, lime juice - freshly squeezed is best Garlic - freshly pressed Fresh vegetables and meat - ensure that you buy the freshest and consume quickly while the flavors are still excellent; make sure to store produce well also to retain the flavors longest Vegetable salt - when trying to cut down, replacing with vegetable salt may help you to make the shift across to using less salt Oregano, lemon juice, and pepper - can do wonderful things for chicken and other meat Heat it up - chili powder , hot sauce, or salsa can all add a bit of zing Magnesium chloride and potassium chloride - these will provide a similar, but not identical, flavor, without the negative effects of sodium. They can be found in the seasoning section of your local grocery store. However, be aware that others may not be able to tolerate the taste of salt substitutes, so don&apos;t add them to dishes, but rather allow each person to add some themselves, if they wish. Also, smaller amounts are better when using these products, as using too much gives the food a chemical taste. 
 4 Avoid processed foods. Avoid processed foods . Fresh produce , meat , and freshwater fish are typically salt-free or extremely low sodium, while processed and restaurant foods, such as soups and frozen dinners, are usually quite high in sodium. If you don&apos;t have access to fresh vegetables, then sodium-free or low sodium canned vegetables are better than high sodium canned vegetables. Many frozen vegetables are low in sodium as well. Get into the habit of reading labels for sodium content. Remember, you can always add salt, if it&apos;s really needed, later. 5 Remove sodium from the surface of foods. Remove sodium from the surface of foods . For some products, the salt can be removed, such as by draining canned olives and soaking them in fresh water , or crumbling salt off the surface of pretzels or saltines. Choose &quot;salt on top&quot; products over those with salt mixed in. For example, avoid buying saltines with &quot;unsalted tops&quot;, as the salt is typically inside the crackers instead of on top, making it impossible to remove. &quot;Salt on top&quot; products also provide more salt taste per amount of sodium, so are a good choice from that perspective, as well. 6 Dilute the sodium in foods. Dilute the sodium in foods . If you do purchase high sodium products, such as soups, one method to reduce the sodium level is dilution. For example, if you prepare soup as instructed on the label, it will have a high sodium content. Instead, you can start with the canned soup as a base, then add potatoes and fresh vegetables such as celery , onions , and carrots . The result is more soup , with a lower average sodium content, and higher average vitamin content, with a lower average cost (because fresh vegetables are also typically less expensive than canned soup). For another example, say you start with ham , which is quite high in sodium. To serve that directly would result in a high sodium intake for everyone who eats it. However, if you mix ham cubes in with unsalted mashed potatoes , you can prepare a tasty dish which has a reasonable sodium level. In addition, canned vegetables that are high in sodium, such as beans, peas and corn, should be rinsed before cooking.
 Canned vegetables, beans and salads are frequently salty, using salt as a preservative. If you drain the accompanying juice and wash the beans or other canned items (if relevant), you will remove a lot of salt each time. And try fresh or frozen foods instead. Add a only small amount of the given flavoring packets, or none if possible, to your favorite macaroni and cheese or Ramen noodles. Try to mix vegetables with these types of fast preparation foods as well, to give the meal more taste and texture. 
 7 Remove the salt shaker if you can&apos;t shake the habit. Change your salting habits at the table . Don&apos;t reach for the salt shaker. When reducing, shake only once rather than going completely cold turkey and gradually wean yourself off this habit. Beware of condiments - many sauces and other toppings contain high amounts of salt.
 Take the salt shaker away. Put it in a cabinet or drawer so that using it will be a conscious act. By not using salt when cooking or eating, many people can reduce their sodium intake by 30 percent. You can replace the salt shaker with a pepper mill, rosemary, garlic powder (not garlic salt), chili powder, or other spices. Freshly ground pepper can be especially good, and can eliminate the bland taste which we are so accustomed to interpret as meaning &quot;it needs salt&quot;. The salt is still available, but if you put it in a less accessible spot (like deep inside a cupboard or in a high cabinet) it is less likely to be used. 
 8 Eat at home. Eat at home . It may be difficult or impossible to control the sodium content of foods prepared by others, whether you eat at somebody else&apos;s home or at a restaurant. Eating at home more often means that you can be assured of the sodium content of your food. 

 

 Eating out 

 1 Ask for the salt to be left off chips or fries and other fast foods. Ask for the salt to be left off chips or fries and other fast foods . Also ask the waiter about low sodium options on the menu. Just as it is often possible to have certain things left out of dishes, salt might be something else that can be left out. If you eat at restaurants that cook the meals fresh each time, you will have a better chance of this than at those restaurants where everything comes pre-prepared. And prefer the lower salt alternative, such as the baked potato over the French fries. 2 Beware the bar snacks. Avoid the foods you know are salty . Nibbles at the bar or on the table can be the saltiest things you&apos;ll experience and they&apos;re very easy to snack away on without even thinking. Be very careful when around bowls and platters of pretzels , pickles, crackers, potato chips, and French fries . They all get their moreish flavor from generous helpings of salt. 3 Watch what you drink. Watch what you drink . Many drinks are quite high in sodium, such as a small Burger King chocolate shake, with 298 mg of sodium. [6] If you&apos;re thirstier after you finish the drink, that&apos;s a sure sign of the drink&apos;s high sodium content. 

 

 Other not-so-salty solutions 

 1 Drink plenty of fresh water. Drink plenty of fresh water . Water helps the body in many ways, and may help to eliminate excess sodium. Can&apos;t stand plain water? Try adding a slice of lemon or see How to love the taste of water for lots of good ideas on improving the taste.
 Be cautious of &quot;softened&quot; water. Water softeners sometimes add a substantial amount of sodium. [7] Avoid drinking such water; instead use bottled water or a reverse osmosis filter. Ideally, also avoid cooking with &quot;softened&quot; water (although using bottled water for cooking could be quite expensive). 
 2 Try munching the strawberries on the next table instead of these salty morsels. Don&apos;t start . If you know you can&apos;t eat just one potato chip or other salty food, don&apos;t eat even the first one. Better yet, don&apos;t buy the bag of chips in the first place. You make more of your eating decisions in the grocery store than you suppose, so choose something healthier. If you do have a few of something salty and need to stop, eat a bit of something else with a neutral flavor. Drink some water or have a bite of veggies or plain crackers or bread. 3 Look for alternatives. Look for alternatives . It isn&apos;t a barren landscape when you cut down on salt. Many items are unsalted or low-salt. Chips, butter, canned broth, and canned soup are all offered in low- or no-salt versions.
 Snack on veggies. Veggies make great snacking substitutes, for example carrots and hummus in place of chips or pretzels. 
 4 Beware of high-sodium medications. Beware of high-sodium medications . Many medications contain sodium. While no prescription med should be discontinued without consulting a physician, you may want to ask your doctor if any sodium-free or low sodium alternative medications are available. 5 Share your unsalted lifestyle. Share your unsalted lifestyle . Encourage others in your life to eat less salt. Stop leaving the salt shaker on the table. Serve unsalted snacks, nuts and chips for parties. Tell people why you&apos;re reducing salt in your diet, especially emphasizing the health benefits of doing so. And don&apos;t hesitate to share low-salt recipes and snacks to help people realize that it&apos;s not a difficult or tasteless lifestyle! 6 Do something else with your salt. Do something else with your salt . There are many other wonderful things you can still use salt for and treat your body at the same time! Bath salts, body scrubs, cleaners and magic tricks are just some of the ways that you can make good use of salt around the house. Here are just a few suggestions:
 How to make your own bath salts How to create salt dough How to make a salt shaker disappear How to Make sandalwood bath salts .

 Edit Tips 
 
 These steps can and should be combined. For example, prepare baked Ramen noodles, without the spice packet, then add fresh vegetables and potatoes, then add freshly ground pepper. If it still needs salt, add a small amount of the seasoning packet. For best results, change your diet and implement these steps gradually . It may help to keep a food diary for a week. Record everything you consume, including beverages and seasonings, and find out how much sodium each item contains. Eliminate the highest sodium sources and replace them with no-sodium or low-sodium substitutes. When you buy meat to cook, check to ensure that it is not &quot;seasoned&quot; (i.e., salted), as is sometimes the case with cuts of pork and chicken sold at grocery stores. Salt acts as a preservative for foods such as beef jerky. Minimize your intake of these foods. Salt is necessary in some instances. In quick breads (banana bread, corn bread, and biscuits), for instance, some salt is necessary to help the baking powder or baking soda work. Yeast breads, while they can be made without salt, often benefit by the addition of a small amount. For older recipes, you may be able to cut down the amount somewhat without changing the outcome much. Omit or reduce added salt when cooking, especially if a dish has salt coming into it from its ingredients, such as ham, sausage, or canned foods. At the very least, taste the food before seasoning it and then salt it lightly. 




 
 
 Edit Warnings 
 
 Salt has been linked to hypertension and increased blood pressure Increased blood pressure is a cause of heart disease and premature death. [8] Too much salt can exacerbate or contribute to diabetes, cataracts, kidney disease, osteoporosis and stomach cancer. [9] Salt also increases the opportunities for swelling and water retention. [10] Some high blood pressure medications do not mix with salt substitutes; check with your health care provider or pharmacist before using! Many low sodium products contain salt substitutes, such as potassium or magnesium chloride, instead of the usual sodium chloride. Such products can have an unpleasant aftertaste. If you don&apos;t like this taste, be careful to check the ingredients list for salt substitutes on all low sodium products. Those with impaired kidney function, diabetes, heart disease and those who have had an organ transplant should avoid salt substitutes, particularly those containing potassium chloride.
