After several visits to his Taco Bell, I could not help giving them Five Stars. Great food and great service.  I had to wait for my food in some cases for 15 minutes or even little longer because they were so busy but the food was coming out Hot and tasted good.  Also, it was interesting that one of the ladies who always there helping with the orders knew most of the customers names as they were coning and leaving.

Worst taco bell eeeever. I live right by this taco bell and have gone there multiple times. This is the only location I know of that gets the order wrong more times than it gets it right. I actually am surprised when I find that they got my order right.

And yes, I still go there (hey you can&apos;t beat the location).

It&apos;s 12 AM and everything else is closed. You have your choice of Taco Bell or Jack in the Box down the street, both of which only the drive-thrus remain open. Now...which one is the lesser of two evils? Honestly, fast food never was my thing and it isn&apos;t now, but when you&apos;re starving, the value menu sadly does look more appetizing. I admit, too, that my $2 cheese quesadilla, didn&apos;t taste half bad.

However, I still refuse to put fast food on par with real restaurants.

It&apos;s a Taco Bell.

A Taco Bell that forgets that 10 seconds ago at the drive-thru window you asked for hot sauce and instead gives you no sauce.

Buyer Beware. We all know it&apos;s Taco Bell&apos;s corporate policy to intentionally &quot;forget&quot; items from your order after they charge you but this place takes it to a whole new level. They &quot;forget&quot; at least one or two items from every order and god forbid you make a special order. You will either get the wrong meat, extra condiments, lacking condiments you get the picture.  My advise is to not leave the drive thru window until you have opened every item from your order and better yet tell them why you are required to do this due to their complete incompetance. But beware if you do find a &quot;forgotten&quot; item after you insult them cuz it might have some special sauce in it when you do get it.
