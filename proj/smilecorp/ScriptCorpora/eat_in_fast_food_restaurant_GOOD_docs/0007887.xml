I always give about 20% (the math is easier...) depending on the service - but, the waiters are taxed on that and they have to give some of that 20% to the bar staff and the busboys, so they do not get all the 20%. You can argue the system all you want, it is ridiculous, but until it is changed, that&apos;s what I do.
 Report Abuse lauraallais on Mar 17, 08 at 01:52 PM 
I&apos;m pretty sure 25% is not normal. I give between 15 and 20% depending on the service.

When I&apos;m out with friends and we have to figure out the tip as a group, no one ever suggests more that 20%.

Take what the Guardian says with a grain of salt regarding the US, or the bias of the particular person quoted.

I really don&apos;t know what staff&quot;expect&quot;, but seriously doubt it is 25%. I think most might be happy if they got a consistent 15%, the traditional level in the US. I have no idea where the 20% stuff started, but I missed that memo. I do not tip 20% in the US, hardly ever (perhaps rarely in the case of really exceptional service, on a low bill). I don&apos;t personally know anyone who tips 25% (or even 20% consistently, to be honest).

That quote was really kind of bizarre about some guy who claimed you can&apos;t&quot;get away&quot;with less than 25% or something. What&apos;s he talking about, that they refuse to allow you to leave? bunch of rubbish. I never tip Starbucks staff, either.

I am not math challenged, so calculated 15% is not difficult for me, and certainly no more difficult than 20%.
 Report Abuse ekscrunchy on Mar 17, 08 at 01:54 PM 
No!!! Of course this varies between cities and types of restaurants. Here in New York City at a good restaurant 15% is considered a bare minimum. But I have rarely left 25%!!! Although come to think of it, at a cheap place where the service was exceptional in some way, I might leave $3 on a $10 check....

I find the mandatory tip, which in my city is applied almost exclusviely to parties of 6 or more with a few notable exceptions (Per Se is one example), is off-putting.
 Report Abuse hlg22 on Mar 17, 08 at 01:59 PM 
That is an interesting article. I live in a major U.S. city and also always tip 20%, unless the service is blatantly rude or completely incompetent. That&apos;s the norm, at least here.

Also re one point the article makes, if there is a service amount included on the bill (many restaurants will automatically include 18% for large parties) you do not also need to leave an additional tip on top of that, as the article suggests.

I thought it was funny that in the comments to this article people suggested that American waiters make in the neighborhood of $120,000/year due to the amount of tips they&apos;re raking in. My sister&apos;s boyfriend is a waiter at an upscale restaurant, and I assure you, that&apos;s not the case!

On my recents trips to the USA, several restaurants added automatically 22% tip to the bill. Of course, these were gourmet restaurants which were pricey enough.

So if Americans complain about the weak dollar and the high prices in Europe, do not forget that there comes nothing on top.
 Report Abuse xyz123 on Mar 17, 08 at 02:46 PM 
As far as I am concerned, the tipping amoun t for adequate service at a restaurant in the USA is 15%, always has been and as far as I am concerned always will be.....at least that was the way I was taught.

If service is poor, they get less down to and including 0.

Also the tip is supposed to be on the amount before taxes...in NYC, there is a poretty stiff 8.375% tax on meals and the tip should be based on the amount of the bill before taxes.

Many restaurants now just show you the total amount including taxes...also I despise when they put the tip on (it&apos;s always suggested ) and base the tip on the amount after taxes.

Some restaurants on their menus say they will include a service charge on large parties...in that case they get nothing additional.

Period.

22% gratuity automatically added:

I remember for sure that it was Quinones in Atlanta (I admit, it belongs to the Forbes&apos;list of the ten most expensive restaurants in USA - but it is worth it).

We were a party of six and had a eleven-course prix fixe menu with wine pairings.

You can guess what the waitress earned this evening.

Interesting...I&apos;ve never heard of it, but I haven&apos;t been to Atlanta in years. Looking at their website, though, I am surprised that a $95 prixe fixe/$175 with wine pairings menu would get them on to a&quot;top 10 most expensive&quot;list, as I can think of several places in my area alone that are in that price range or higher (and also worth it . The 22% charge is strange though, I have never seen an automatic gratuity added that was over 18%, and even then very rarely in upscale restaurants. There was so much debate when Per Se in NYC instituted one, and even theirs is&quot;only&quot;20%!

The British tourists in the article were either mean or possibly thought that the service was bad,
The norm in the UK is 10-15% unless there is a service charge.

I never heard of that place either. But then I have not been to Atlanta in ages.

But as I said above, I am aware of only one place that charges an automatic service charge on a party of less than 6 and that is, as noted above, Per Se in NYC. Sad to say but $95 for an 11-course tasting menu would be pretty usual in NY. Odd that it would be on a Forbes list like you describe..

no, it&apos;s hardly interesting news to say that the normal tip amount in a US city is 20% when the normal tip amount here in london&apos;top restaurants would come close to that. as ever, exaggeration rules.

however, this article does explain something that is lost on many europeans...the idea that american waiter&apos;s pay is low because they make plenty in tips...not the other way around. bizarrely, many europeans look at american waiters like they are making slave wages. seemingly ignorant of the fact that american waiters and bartenders typically make many more times the pay of their european cousins (who earn a&apos;living wage&apos;as the£6/hour is often described).

the automatically added tip is much more common in london than it is in the US. i don&apos;t think it&apos;s common in the US except for large parties and world class restaurants. in london it is quite common at restaurants of all levels and applies to all, regardless of party size.

Just my experience:

From a business perspective, most company controllers allow 15 -18% tips. I base my personal tipping on that plus service or lack there of. Many places now simply add 18% service fee onto the bill.

I would have agreed with all of you (25% = absurdity) until I sort of overheard a conversation among waiters at a place I frequent. I was totally shocked. I thought 20% was very generous but obviously the times they are a-changing. 25 is the new 20. Guess I&apos;ll be on the cheapskate list now.

Going out as a group can nudge the tip to 25% just based on ease of splitting the bill, rounding, and tipping on taxes.

I am have seen the automatic 18% (it always seems to be 18%) service charge added on all checks. It was in the tourist area of a couple of US major cities. The notification was in tiny print on the last page or the intro page at the bottom. And we noted the extra charge on the bill at the end, after the taxes. Yes, the charge slip still came with the blank tip line on it which we struck out with guilt.
Is there a way for the restaurant to delete this line when they print the bill? I have also seen the tip line on the charge slip when purchasing items from a restaurant store too.

I guess I count as a cheapskate too. When I moved to the US in 1975, 10% was the standard tip. Then it went up to 15%. Now it&apos;s supposed to be 18-20%? I&apos;m sorry, but it&apos;s a PERCENTAGE. I can see increasing an absolute amount, but why should a percentage increase? Count me among those who want restaurant staff paid a proper wage with no tipping - and yes, I realize that would put menu prices up, but the menu price is a myth anyway with the current system.

Something that puzzles me is that some Americans (including posters here) insist on tipping at American levels even though they know that isn&apos;t the custom of the country they&apos;re visiting. If it&apos;s not OK for visitors TO America to ignore local custom, why is OK for visitors FROM America to do so?
 Report Abuse hlg22 on Mar 17, 08 at 06:51 PM 
thursdaysd, I completely agree with you on Americans&apos;tendency to purposely overtip to U.S. standards overseas - I think a lot of people don&apos;t understand that overtipping can seem rude and obnoxious, and also inflates expectations for other American tourists coming after you who may not be able to afford to tip so highly. It is not that hard to determine what the rough tipping expectations are in a country you&apos;re visiting and tip accordingly.

A few years ago, I watched a very pushy American woman try to force a tip on a front desk employee at the Park Hyatt Tokyo (no tipping in Japan, and it&apos;s offensive to try) - very uncomfortable for all involved (and for us watching!), though the employee was very polite in refusing.
 Report Abuse nibblette on Mar 17, 08 at 07:28 PM 
I agree with thursdaysd.

I always try to study what the tipping customs are of the country I am visiting. And tip accordingly.
However, I have gone to places where&quot;no tip is expected&quot;yet I have had guides/service people drop no-so-subtle hints at getting a tip. Sometimes making a mention of how generous Americans are with their tipping (remember, this is a no tip place!).
Planning on following the usual custom, they often make me feel guilty and uncomfortable. Esp if this happens halfway or early on in the trip. I do give small tips for extraordinary service. But blatant&quot;hands-out&quot;behavior pretty much ensures they will not get a tip.

I have also had really, really bad service where even if tipping was customary, I would not have left a tip. But have had the server try to push me to give a tip by pointing out I only left exact change. And gotten dirty looks when I just nod. I can only think this is because other Americans still tip when it is not the custom and have changed the expectations for the worst.

&quot;someone occasionally giving someone extra money&quot;- that is not the situation I&apos;m talking about. I&apos;m talking about people who consistently tip at US levels in countries where tipping is not the custom. And, actually, in a non-tipping country, why would even an occasional tip be acceptable behavior? (I do understand the latter impulse, for example, I&apos;ve tried to tip Chinese taxi drivers on occasion when I&apos;ve felt they&apos;ve gone well beyond normal service - and always had the tip refused.)

This all raises and interesting point about an issue that keeps raising its head on this forum.

The current $/euro exchange rate is currently a shocker and many of you bleat on here about not coming to Europe because it is currently too expensive.

How about simply not tipping everyone including the pilot on your trip and you&apos;ll save 20% - just enough to offset the credit crunch!

BTW

I have said this before - many Italians will regard you as fools for tipping, Chinese will think you fools and refuse. The Japanese will feel patronised and refuse. (all generally)

This approach frequently appears in cultures where serving is treated as an art form and is rewarded appropriately by the employers.

thursdaysd, I thought you were talking about Europe. Maybe not. Most posts here are about England (where 15 or even 18% is routinely added on these days), Italy, and France, where 10% or more is not the least bit&quot;unexpected&quot;. Which countries in Europe are you talking about where someone leaving a 15% tip is considered absolutely prohibited by local customs? I&apos;ve eaten at a nice Paris restaurant where my Parisian hosts insisted on leaving well over 15%. This is the 21st Century please remember. I even overheard a waiter in Venice screaming at a patron for not leaving the suggested 15% tip. I honestly don&apos;t know where in Europe you are talking about today where leaving a waiter who has given outstanding service in a nice restaurant a 15% or so tip would be considered even the least bit out of line. Perhaps you&apos;re living in the last century?

At the risk of realizing that my last post made it sound like I think tipping in Europe is the SAME as in the US, not at all, but I do think that any waiter in any nice restaurant in most European countries who receives a 15% or even a rare 20% tip after giving superlative service, will NOT be shocked or insulted by receiving it, and I think you are naive if you believe he would be. That may have been true 30 years ago, but certainly not today.

Ok so we all agree, Americans are the tipping freaks of the world,, and although we all love American tips,, it doesn&apos;t mean we don&apos;t think it is nessesary. I worked at a very nice hotel restaurant for years when I was younger, loved the Americans who would tip me just to seat them near a window or make sure they got a candle on the birtday persons dessert... which I would have done for FREE anyways..
I never tip more then 15-20 % and if service is poor, I tip LESS, if service is poor, I leave either a tiny tip or no tip at all. I do not penalize servers if food is not good( they didn&apos;t cook it) and I am understanding if I see they have a full section, but lord help them if I see them lazing around, I supervised staff for too long to tip anyone anything for being a lazy ass.
In foreign countries I follow their norms, which in most Europeon countries seems to be rounding up( for a coffe etc) , or leaving about 10% for a nice meal.

What a load of rubbish! You are particularly wide of the mark on Italy and France.&quot;Service Included&quot;pretty well means what the words say.

Give an Italian or French waiter 20% and he&apos;ll probably gladly pocket the money and consider you a fool for parting with it so readily.

As for that Venetian waiter: he has probably been corrupted by Americans who spend money as if they had it to spare; I very much doubt he would scream at an Italian for leaving nothing at all. Or this Irishman.

Guess no one told the guide book writers. I&apos;m looking at a guide to London saying 10-15% unless service is included, and one to the Amalfi Coast saying service is usually included and an extra tip is not expected.

Yes, discussions with people insisting on tipping in non-tipping countries tend to occur on the Asia board, but I see no reason to over-tip in low tipping countries either. And I&apos;m still trying to figure out why the percentages should have increased in the US in the first place.
 Report Abuse gruezi on Mar 17, 08 at 10:15 PM 
Well, I&apos;ve lived in NYC and have spent the past year living in Switzerland and traveling once or twice a month all over Europe.

I continue to be baffled by the varying ideas about tipping I encounter.

When I lived in the NYC area, 20% was pretty standard unless service was bad, then 15% unless you absolutely never planned to return to that restaurant again. I guess I&apos;m not surprised to hear 25% is now a good tip.

In Europe, I think tipping really runs across nationalities. Most in Switzerland leave zero to 5% as service is included in the cost of the entree. In fact, this was put to vote in Switzerland as far as I&apos;ve been told. Well, at a good restaurant the entree can be 48chf so I guess I don&apos;t want to leave too much more as I&apos;d never be able to afford to eat out...We usually leave about 5% at a nice restaurant. Maybe just a coin at a very casual place.

In Rome and Venice, I was told by a number of service people that while Italians don&apos;t tip, it is expected that Americans do tip. Annoying&quot;policy&quot;in my opinion, and the added cost of&quot;bread&quot;(usually pretty stale and tasteless) was not to my liking either. Call me cheap, but as the dollar declines, my tips in Italy are declining too. In fact, I figure since I don&apos;t currently live in the US I shouldn&apos;t have to tip like I do.

When out in Switzerland with ex-pats from GB, they generally get annoyed if I leave any tip since they don&apos;t see it as necessary. Most Americans and those from S. Africa like to leave a little something. I don&apos;t socialize with a lot of Swiss people but they keep it at 5% or less when I do.

In Germany, it is customary to&quot;round up&quot;when paying the bill by a few Euros. Say, from a 36 Euro bill you pay 40 Euro. Also, I was told not to leave the tip on the table but to tip right as you pay, saying,&quot;stimmt so&quot;if you mean keep the change, so that the waiter can thank you right away for your tip.

In Ravenna, Italy, some Swedes I was with were horrified that I left even 5%...I spent a week with them and they never tipped anyone - waiter, bellboy, or tour guide. I felt uncomfortable tipping when they were there. I&apos;m not sure now if I should have tipped or not!

In Morocco, I was informed a few times that my tips were too low by the person I was tipping!! One man explained to me how many children he had to feed! Later when I told my driver what happened he said that my tip was very generous! At the same time, if I asked a hotel or restaurant manager for advice on tipping, I was told it was absolutely not necessary to tip anyone. At dinner at a very nice Riad in Fes, the Americans all decided to leave 10%, the British said they weren&apos;t leaving anything. In nicer restaurants in Rabat, locals told me 10% was a customary tip. I was also told from 100-200 dirham a day for a guide was a good tip. That equates to about 10 to 25 USD a day.

In Paris, I was told 10% by a number of Parisians.

Well, I&apos;d love to hear other Fodorite&apos;s experiences/thoughts since I want to do what is&quot;correct&quot;but it seems hard to really know. Just because the dollar is so weak doesn&apos;t excuse me from doing the right thing by those who are providing service.

To anyone reading this who cares to share:

In various European countries/cities do you tip and how much/what percent do you tip:

someone who helps carry your luggage?

a taxi driver?

a bistrot waiter?

a formal restaurant waiter?

a tour guide who is really good?

a concierge who has made reservations or other arrangements for you?

a bellman who gets you a cab?

a massage therapist?

a hair stylist?

Thanks for helping!

gruezi, some of my practices (restaurants only, as I rarely use the other services about which you ask)
- Ireland (home): about 10% unless there is an explicit service charge added on. I do ask if it goes to the staff.
- Britain: same as Ireland.
- France: usually in the range 0-5%.
- Budapest: about 10% where it is not specifically charged (which it often is). I am advised that outside Budapest it is normal not to tip.
- Italy: 0-5%.
- Germany: I am told that there are regional variations, but on recent visits to Berlin and Munich I rounded up to give about 10%. What do you do if the charge is€28.50? I handed over€40 and told the waiter€32.

Very occasionally I find a server clearly angling for a tip. That gets up my nose, and provokes me to reduce the amount I give. I have never had a server suggest how much I should tip. I wonder if that is because I am not taken for an American.

In many places, if the menu says service is included, I don&apos;t leave a tip....in London, some of my favorite (at least they&apos;re reasonably priced) are Japanese restaurants such as Wagamama...they add a 12% service charge to the bill..no tip....most French restaurants have service compris...no tip...as I said, NYC my tip is 15%..always has been and always will be....

Interestingly enough....the trafalgar tour companies has a message board and whenever the subject of tips comes up...many of the Australians become very agitated to say the least...they go out of their way to say in Australia they don&apos;t believe in tipping and how superior their system is...routinely it becomes very heavy and the web master has to take those discussions off the board...let them pay the waiters (or tour directors) a decent wage...tips just encourage employers to get away without paying their employees decently...that seems to be the attitude of many Australians.

Interestingly enough, talking about tips...for years Australians claim they are never told that it is customary to tip the tour director (and coach driver) on an escorted tour at the end of the tour (the fact is buried in the documents)...but Trafalgar pulled a fast one this year on its clients...

For years, the clients were told the customary tip to a tour director is the equivalent of $4 US per day and to the coach driver $2.50 per day..no matter which country the client was from, the documentation said $4/$2.50 US...many complained that since it was a European tour, the tour prices should be given in euro.

You&apos;re right, said Trafalgar, so this year they changed the&quot;recommended&quot;tip suggestion to€4/€2.50 per day....up theirs....the proper tip amount, at least to me, remains $4/$2.50 and that&apos;s what they&apos;ll get form me.

Guezi,
My experience in Europe:

1. UK&amp;Ireland: 10% unless service added, then nothing. Pub, buy a drink for bartender (money given). This is per my English BF.
2. Switzerland: nothing.
3. Italy, round up, accompanied by Italian friend.
4. France: round up, always service compris. From French friend
5. Czech: round up or nothing if service included. Otherwise 5-10%, per Czech friend.
6. Greece: round up (service included)
7. Spain: round up
8. Hungary: nothing or round up, service always included. Had a server say&quot;Is that all?&quot;when we rounded up the bill! I&apos;m sure she did not say that to the non-Americans!
9. Iceland: nothing, service included (good thing, very high prices!)

I use guides primarily for treks and adventure trips. I have never tipped the guide/driver for locally owned businesses in Italy, Ireland, or Iceland. I have for some of the other countries because the company catered to Americans and mentioned tipping. In that case because the guide is basically 24/7, $5-10/day, depending on the cost of the tour.
Tipped the guide in Spain even though tip is not expected or even mentioned because I was with a group of Americans. The Swedes in the group did not look happy. I&apos;m not sure if they contributed to the pot.

Rarely use bellhops, travel almost always with just carry-on. But for luggage storage, give 1 of whatever currency (1 pound UK, 1 euro Europe).

Don&apos;t use taxis much either but in general just round up. Did have a driver in France try to keep the change - equivalent to the actual fare! Had to ask for my change! He said he thought it was his tip! I speak French so no misunderstandings. Needless to say, he got no tip! He knew I am American so I wonder if that had something to do with it.

I think the overtipping by Americans in countries that don&apos;t have tipping or small tips do contribute to these expectations/problems.

 Report Abuse Jake1 on Mar 18, 08 at 08:22 AM 
I think the 25% is for people who have more money than sense. I&apos;m not even sure when this 20% thing started, though I&apos;ve noticed it mentioned more and more over the past few years.

In most moderate to upper crust restaurants, wait staff do quite well earnings-wise when hourly wages and tips are added together. If you&apos;ve got four people at a table spending $30 each, then a 15% tip will amount to $18 or so for just that one table--and they can certainly take care of more than one table an hour. That&apos;s not bad money for unskilled labor.

Now if you&apos;re in a burger joint or local pub where a customer might spend only $5 or $10, it&apos;s another issue. But they&apos;ll generally have more turnover so the tips can still add up.

For us, 15% is still the normal tip for average service. 20% for a great dining experience. We haven&apos;t had any waiters spit on us when we&apos;ve returned to restaurants after using these tip guidelines.

For about the millionth time on this issue, there is a difference between what is&quot;necessary&quot;and giving an occasional reward for&quot;special&quot;service. And thursdaysd, you still are ignoring the point which caused me to first comment on your comment. If you honestly think that a person leaving extra money to a server who has spent extra time explaining and translating a menu, offering suggestions to a foreigner who doesn&apos;t understand the menu and the items on it, and giving EXTRA personal service to a customer just out of kindness is JUST AS BAD as leaving no tip at all when it was expected by local custom, then your lack of understanding is much too great for us to deal with here!

The very bottom line is that tips are ALWAYS suggestions -- but often with a pretty well understood minimum amount. (And again for the millionth time, there IS a difference between&quot;service charge&quot;and&quot;tip&quot;. Even when&quot;service charge&quot;is added, that does not preclude the possibility of a&quot;tip&quot;for special service. When I feel a waiter has gone out of his way to spend more time with me than is necessary, then I reward him with a greater than&quot;what is necessary&quot;tip. I do that in the US or in any other civilized country. No, I don&apos;t automatically tip when it is not a local custom, but when I have been given extra service and have met up with a server doing MORE than his required job with me, I will not be&quot;bullied&quot;in to believing I&apos;ve committed a horrible faux pas by rewarding him slightly for his time and kindness.

NeoPatrick, you might sound more convincing if you didn&apos;t go into warrior mode on this question, if you acknowledged that there are circumstances where a lower-than-norm tip is justified, and if you actually seemed to know the norms for the places you write about. It would help readability, too, if you could leave the SHIFT key alone more of the time.

Cavil all you like -- and I see that you carefully reserve some scope for it -- but, let&apos;s focus on the reality: in nearly all cases one experiences fairly standard quality of service in European restaurants, with below standard being approximately as common as above standard. One deals with that by adjusting tips up or down within a range of reasonableness.

I don&apos;t care if you throw your money away -- it&apos;s yours. [My own preference, when giving money away, is to focus on certain charities.]

Ignoring local custom is a&quot;bad thing&quot;. Period. If locals would occasionally tip high for extra service, then fine, do so. If they wouldn&apos;t, neither should you. And if they would never tip, again, neither should you. Equally, if you&apos;re in the US, then you should tip like the locals (which seems to vary depending on whether or not you&apos;re in a major city). I fail to see the difficulty here.

&quot;In most moderate to upper crust restaurants, wait staff do quite well earnings-wise when hourly wages and tips are added together. If you&apos;ve got four people at a table spending $30 each, then a 15% tip will amount to $18 or so for just that one table--and they can certainly take care of more than one table an hour. That&apos;s not bad money for unskilled labor.&quot;

Jake1, this quote illustrates a very popular misconception. The server in your example is not earning $18/hour for one table. At an upscale restaurant, servers have to&quot;tip out&quot;everyone from the bartender, to the busboys, to the sommelier with a portion of their tips. That is often done using an assumed tip percentage - say 16.5%. So even if a table stiffs their server by leaving a 5% tip, the server still has to tip out as if they&apos;d been left 16.5%, meaning that they may have actually lost money on that table! Also, at an upscale place, a table may only turn over every 2 1/2-3 hours, so they are certainly not getting $18/hour/table, even before tipping out.

Also ira, in Washington, DC, 15% is chintzy, unless you are dissatisfied with the service. Everyone I know tips 20% here.

NeoPatrick,
I have to disagree with your sweeping assumptions about major European cities. 15% is NOT the norm. Actually the norm is just rounding up. I travel frequently to Europe and dine out with local friends at fine restaurants. Rounding is their custom, nothing more.
Over-tipping is an American
custom. Many locals do NOT like it. And it does cause pressure on other Americans (and prb other foreign tourists) because so many Americans foolishly (THEIR opinion) throw their money away.

What you consider&quot;special services&quot;(explaining and helping the diner with the menu and translating) is actually the server&apos;s job. Major tourist centers restaurants specifically hire servers who speak English, among other languages, for this reason.
I don&apos;t tip a server extra for telling me the special of the day or answer questions about dishes in the US. But I would decrease the tip if they failed to do so since they did not do part of the minimum for their job.

Here is my story about lawyers; at least in the USA under the American tort system.....

Several years ago I was called for jury duty and was sent to be a prospective juror in a civil suit...in this court jurisdiction the voir dire is conducted by the lawyers and no judge is present.

anyway, I was the first panelist called and the lawyer for the plaintiff explained to me he would be asking for a large settlement (it was clearly one of those frivolous suits the American tort system is famous for)..

I looked him in the face and said,&quot;Of course you&apos;re going to ask for a large settlement, you get 1/3 of it.&quot;He looked at me like I had said something terrible; he went outside with his colleague, came back in and told the panel they would have to disqualify the whole panel because of what I had said. And 5 minutes later, we were back in the jury room and 10 minutes later, they called the names of all the panelists who had been present in court when I had the gall to tell the truth and told us we were dismissed from jury duty, and this clown looked at me and said,&quot;It&apos;s disgusting. I hope you never need a lawyer if somebody does something to you.&quot;

Unless one really has done a survey and has statistics, I think most of these comments about what happens in the entire city are just personal impressions of what oneself does, or maybe a few people they know. There are really only a couple people I routinely dine with to even know what people do. I don&apos;t give a hoot what some anonymous person considers chintzy nor do I care if a jerky waiter gives me dirty looks for tipping 15%. I would go to different restaurants, if they did. In fact, I have never, not once, noticed any dirty looks or attitude from tipping 15% in restaurants. I also don&apos;t even understand the idea of tipping more on a bigger bill, I tip more on a smaller bill as 15% of $12 is a lot less than 15% of $50.

I do not dine in expensive restaurants, ever, so many that is to my advantage that I don&apos;t encounter all these judgmental people and am living in a different universe where people don&apos;t think you are chintzy for leaving a 15% tip.

Why would that even be, I wonder. 15% was the figure you always heard as a typical tip in the US for many decades, where and when did this 20% thing start, and why? Why do people have an idea that they should tip more in expensive restaurants than to the poor servers in cheap restaurants who really need it a lot more (I know waiters in expensive restaurants who make very good incomes with tips, more than $50K a year).

Meanwhile, Christina, I&apos;m surprised at your own disagreement that waiters in fancier restaurants should make more money than their counterparts in cheap restaurants.

Would you expect PerSe to reduce their chefs&apos;salaries as the cooks working in a diner&quot;need the money more&quot;?
Of course, the amount of the tip goes up with the same percentage in a fancier or more expensive place. And of course, the waiter in the fancier place would logically expect to earn more there than if he worked the counter at a Denny&apos;s. Would you honestly leave a $1 tip for a blue plate special in a diner, then leave the same $1 tip in a fancy restaurant after a $40 meal, because they didn&apos;t serve any more food or do any more work? I fail to understand the connection between the&quot;amount&quot;of the tip and the quality and cost of the restaurant.

All this talk about percentages. I tend to tip what ever the heck I want sometimes. I do not see why my waitress who serves me my 20 dollar lunch ( salad, entree and dessert) should only get 2 bucks.. whereas if they were fancier more expensive foods, and cost 50 bucks then she would be entitled to 10 bucks..

How is that even remotely make sence to any of you. She walks back and forth to the talbe the same amount of times.

I never leave less then 2 bucks for a coffee/ bun type deal, and I never leave more then 20 bucks for a fancy dinner, regardless of price of meal. This is calculated on the server only serving a table of two though, if one had a larger group, therefore more work, then one would tip more.

I do think those of you who claim leaving less then 20% is wrong or unacceptable are a bit odd. Its a tip, and leaving a bigger tip makes you a fool not some sort of Mother Theresa helping the poor!I guess in some circles( the shallow ones) it is prestigious to be thought of as a&quot;big tipper&quot;,, but in most circles it just makes a person look pretentious and silly.

It isn&apos;t about being judgemental, it is about norms. I agree that 15% is okay at a casual place, but it just isn&apos;t okay at a top-tier restaurant. Scream about it until you are blue in the face, but it won&apos;t make you more right.

 Why do people have an idea that they should tip more in expensive restaurants than to the poor servers in cheap restaurants who really need it a lot more (I know waiters in expensive restaurants who make very good incomes with tips, more than $50K a year). 

They have this idea for several reasons:

1) Because you expect better service. A top server at a top restaurant is (expected to be) a professional. They should be compensated appropriately - and professionals in big cities do earn more than $50k per year.
2) Because they serve fewer tables. There are two ways to make money, volume or price. Waiting tables at Applebee&apos;s is about turning the table; maybe in an hour or less. I&apos;ve eaten at Asian restaurants where they start clearing the plates as soon as they put them down. If you wait tables at Daniel, then you will be caring for those people for 2+ hours.
3) Because they&apos;tip out&apos;more people. Again, you don&apos;t have to give a cut to the somellier at Applebee&apos;s. Indeed, there usually isn&apos;t even an expeditor. All those extra people you see at an expensive restaurant need to get paid, and it comes from the waiters.

Again, you don&apos;t have to agree with it, but it is what it is. Learn to live with it may sound rude, but it is still good advice.

It certainly was helpful to me to see real percentages and amounts for various countries and situations.

I put proper tipping in the category of good manners and most times I like to fit in the&quot;norm&quot;on this so I really appreciate the feedback.

I think if most of us fit in the norm the high-tippers and the chintzy tippers will hopefully balance out each other.

One more thought... when I&apos;m on vacation having a wonderful time and feeling pretty fortunate about my life, sometimes a good tip is just my way of spreading the cheer - it&apos;s probably some&quot;American&quot;thing, but I just can&apos;t help myself On the last day of a nice stay, my husband and I usually sit over coffee at breakfast and decide who to tip and how much.

Christina,
I stand by the fact that 20% tipping in DC is average. I eat out here a lot, with lots of different people from all walks of life - including professionals, students, and blue collar folks, and for everyone, at all types of restaurants, the 20% is a given when dividing up the check. I never go to the outer burbs, though, so I&apos;m not sure what the practice is there. For good service, 15% is certainly acceptable, but it is below the norm - I would bet money on that. It&apos;s not surprising that you haven&apos;t gotten any&quot;dirty looks&quot;from servers, though, because a good server would never confront someone for leaving a small tip or even none at all. They&apos;ll suck it up and have a few less dollars than expected towards their car payment, rent, etc. Federal minimum wage for waiters/waitresses is $2.13/hour. I would not want to try to live in DC or any other expensive metropolitan area on $2.13/hour plus 15% tips.

I don&apos;t see why tipping rates should increase over time. I am quite sure that restaurants raise their prices roughly in line with the cost of living, and servers&apos;incomes should rise accordingly.

What I think even more odd is that the expected percentage is higher in upscale restaurants. A couple dine out: a $100 tab might bring a tip of $15-20; a $300 tab brings a tip of $75. Approximately the same amount of work, perhaps some difference in the server&apos;s skill -- but a difference that big? No, I say, no.
 Report Abuse NeoPatrick on Mar 19, 08 at 10:32 AM 
Padraig, to answer several of your questions.

First of all a waiter&apos;s job has changed over time. Twenty years ago, one wouldn&apos;t have expected the waiter to stand and recite a list of 6 or more evening specials many with a dozen or more ingredients and special techniques. He probably wouldn&apos;t have brought the little plate, poured the olive oil, perhaps ground some cheese and pepper and splash balsamic into it for your bread. He probably wouldn&apos;t have explained the array of desserts or brought a dessert tray and stood there for ten minutes explaining all of them.
The days of simply taking your order from the menu, then bringing your check are long gone. And today&apos;s waiter may have a host of other people to tip out of his tips -- an expeditor, a food runner, the bartender, the bus help, and others. Meanwhile, those things I just mentioned also help to explain why one would expect a waiter in a high end restaurant to make a LOT more than one saying&quot;do you want cheese on your quarter pounder?&quot;or&quot;do you want the meat loaf or the turkey?&quot;

If I&apos;m not mistaken lots of&quot;percentages&quot;increase. Here our rate of sales tax has gone from just over 3 percent not so long ago to over 6 percent today. Why? Surely things cost more, so why wouldn&apos;t that automatically take care of increased income for sales tax? Rates of real estate taxes, cost of living, and many other percentages go up as well. Assuming that things costing more will automatically take care of increased income is naive at best.

And I can&apos;t even begin to explain the logic of the waiter making more for an expensive meal than a cheap one. Of course he does. Why not?
Do you think the restaurant marks up all their wines by a set amount? Do you think that they make the same amount on a $30 bottle of wine as they do on a $300 bottle? Of course not. Using your logic, if they make $10 on a cheap bottle of wine, then they should probably just charge $10 over their cost on a $300 bottle of wine as well. Get real. That just isn&apos;t the way retail works in any shape or form.


 Report Abuse Padraig on Mar 19, 08 at 10:54 AM 
NeoPatrick, your answers don&apos;t convince me.

First, I don&apos;t expect -- or want -- a server to stand and recite today&apos;s menu; I want a written menu that I can peruse at my leisure. And that is what I generally get here in Europe. Perhaps I might be told about today&apos;s special, but I don&apos;t want a list of specials. If the menu changes every day, then it should be written down every day. The technology is readily available and cheap.

Second, I don&apos;t want any of that faffing about with bread and oil and things.

Such measures do not strike me as improvement in service. They are making a song and dance of things, and for what? To gull the customer and increase the tip potential.

Do you really think changes in rates of tax have any bearing on the issue of tip percentages? And you invite me to get real!

Finally, for somebody who bristles so readily at any misunderstanding of what you say, you last paragraph is extraordinary. I did not advocate flat-rate tipping; I questioned the justification for a greater percentage on a higher tab. 15% of $300 is a lot more than 15% of $100.

Yes, there is a different minimum wage for waiters. Our area is $2.33 per hour. This is because all of the tips are claimed for taxes and averaged out to make the pay higher.

Then, as stated before, many other people are tipped out of the waiters tip(bus people, bartenders, etc.) Also keep in mind that on a charge tip(and 90% are charges), 3% of that tip goes back to the house to pay to the charge company.

If you have had good service from a server who does a good job and seems happy doing it, tip accordingly. 18% to 20% is average. If you tip more, it will be much appreciated, and if you have bad service, tip less.

Another&quot;tip&quot;for you is if it is a restaurant you frequent often, the staff will know the&quot;good tippers&quot;and be very happy to see you--you may very well make their night, and make up for the people who don&apos;t believe in tipping at all.

Hi NP,

&gt;Twenty years ago, one wouldn&apos;t have expected the waiter to stand and recite a list of 6 or more evening specials many with a dozen or more ingredients and special techniques.

Where?

Even in Salisbury, MD 60 years ago a decent waiter did that.

From memory, without looking at notes.

They also didn&apos;t lean on the table, introduce themselves, or come around every 2 min to interrupt the conversation with&quot;everything OK?&quot;.

From the responses of the desk clerks.

&gt;why would you ever leave a maid&apos;s tip with the hotel front desk?

Why not leave it under the pillow on your bed?&lt;

Because I don&apos;t know who will find it if I leave it in the room.

In general, I trust the desk clerks at the hotels where I stay.

Thank you for your response, Ira. Not sure why a desk clerk would frown on a guest leaving a tip for the maid, but if you say so...

I just leave it under the pillow figuring that the maid will be the one to make the bed. Or, during a stay of several days, just hand it to the maid. I often stay at larger (non-European) hotels with large front desk staffs..it would never occur to me to leave a maid&apos;s tip with any of the personnel there..

To each his own..

SemiMike, I don&apos;t think they are particularly well-paid, but they probably earn a living wage for a lowish standard of living. I don&apos;t think many Europeans leave a tip for chambermaids, so if you use hotels with a dominantly European clientele, then your action will stand out a bit. And yes, there might also be a different tradition of politeness: I presume you leave a note to indicate that it is a tip and not just pocket change that you forgot to pick up that morning -- and a written note merits written response.

[I can be very casual about pocket change, and I don&apos;t think any chambermaid anywhere in Europe has presumed that cash left in the room is for her to pocket.]

zama, seriously? you never tip above $20 regardless? that is ridiculous.

as a former waitress in college, i made a whopping $2.30 an hour. After taxes, i often had paychecks of less than $5 or nothing. I certainly was not working for my hourly paycheck!

When you take a serving position, you don&apos;t do it for the paycheck, you select the restaurant for the tip potential. 18-20% is the norm. Less than 15 and I would wonder what I had done wrong. 10% would be a serious greviance.


Waiting in fancy restaurants deserve higher tip. why? first they usually have to tip out a lot of people...the sommelier, the bartender, the host, the busboys. Each usually get 10% pay out of total pot. In addition, in a fancy restaurant your meal takes a lot longer and a waiter has less tables, that means they may depnd on 2-3 tables for the entire nights wages.

If i work at denny&apos;s, I may be turning over $20 checks at $4 tip a time, but I may turn 20 some tables consistently, every 3 hrs. At Denny&apos;s...I would get to keep all my wages.

To have a max&quot;tip&quot;amount regardless of meal price is ridiculous and as a waiter, i would be very offended and wonder what major offense had I incurred.

I agree with HGL. I cover DC for work and we have many friends that work in DC. It&apos;s a HCOL city and i would tip 20% for normal service as any of my friends would. 15% is a little below normal.

Americans just rip off their waiters by paying them slave wages, so the public has to pay them since the employers apparently don&apos;t have to,, its just a dumb situation. Seems like the only ones who win are the tax guys and the restaurant owners, the waiters and the public get screwed.

bozama: Fight the power! The waiter is just another extension of the machine!

I mean, I thought I was cynical, but you seem to think the waiters are out to get you. I used to wait tables, and I never spat in anyone&apos;s food and never knew anyone else who did it. And I didn&apos;t wait tables at a fancy place, and we had a lot of customers who I would have liked to do it to. But, most waiters have the same professionalism as you will find in any worker, so why should you expect them to behave dramatically different from how they would act, were they working in an office?

I&apos;m going to say it again:

If you don&apos;t like the rules - tough. Don&apos;t go out to eat. You may not like the norms, but they are still the norms, and you should abide by them. Trying to justify it by calculating the number of trips, or degree of phoniness or whatever seems like a lot of work to save $5.

As for whether Americans rip off their waiters. Well, you would end up paying them anyway. If it wasn&apos;t through tips, it would be bundled into the price of the meal - trust me when I tell you that the restaurant biz is a low-margin, high risk business, and the owners are not eager to add additional costs. And the IRS would love nothing more than actual salaries, as tipped jobs are ripe territory for underreporting of wages.

And finally, we will agree to disagree about what is tacky and annoying about dining out. Table-side service? If I wanted that sort of fluff, I would book a cruise. Though, I do have to confess that I like a proper caesar salad (not the anchovy-free garbage often offered these days), but they can assemble it in the kitchen.

I love it when people write how tipping is wrong, it deprives the waiters, bartenders, hair dressers et al of a decent wage, and that their system is superior. Of course they are entitled to their opinions on this.

But you know something...most of these people in the service industry in the USA love this system..you know why.

It&apos;s called the underground economy...only a small fraction of the tips they receive can be traced by the Internal Revenue Service and they only pay a small fraction of the taxes they should be paying...the IRS has made attempts to get some of its due money by using techniques such as allocated tips where the owners is required on the basis of credit card tips allocate tip income but the vast majority of cash tips simply disappears into the hands and pockets of the service providers never to be reported.

And waiters, bartenders, those who bring drinks to the gambling tables, dealers (at casinos) do very well on tips thank you very much.

I may not think it&apos;s a great system but at least there is still the option....if I don&apos;t like the service, I don&apos;t tip.

And I still feel 15% is an adequate tip at a restaurant, 5 star or Denny&apos;s no matter what anybody else thinks. If the waiters doesn&apos;t like it, too bad.

Yes and no.
In US restaurants, except where service is already added (increasing in highly touristed areas), it is expected because it pays the servers&apos;salaries. Tips are expected for all but the worst service.
For many other services (hair, massage, concierge, etc), it is a reward for a job well done and as a thank you. Customary but not required as above.
For others, it can be to get better or unusual service. Example: for a maitre-d, it can be a bribe for a better table or to&quot;jump the queue&quot;.

That&apos;s the way the system is set up. And I think you are incorrect about the underground economy - any reputable restaurant will be pretty strict about the required reporting, and would notice any significant discrepancies. Plus, now many/most tips now are just left by adding them on to a credit card charge rather than in cash, so the restaurant already has a record of them.

chartley,
Yes, you&apos;re right, we need to change our entire federal wage payment system for restaurant workers in order to gain the business of overseas visitors. I will call the Department of Labor and tell them they should get right on that. LOL. When I travel I change my behavior to adapt to the norms of the location I&apos;m visiting - I don&apos;t call something nonsense just because its not exactly the way things are done at home.

I will end with a story my future BIL, the waiter, told me. He is a great waiter, very personable, and consistently makes above average tips. One night, he had an older woman, dining alone, who left him a 50 cent tip on about a $50 bill. Not only that, but she specifically called him over to tell him all the things that he had done wrong to merit this low tip. Ok, maybe, if he&apos;d provided horrible service. But her list of transgressions were things like&quot;when I asked for lemon with my water, you only brought me two slices, and you should have brought four,&quot;&quot;I don&apos;t like ice in my water&quot;(she had not mentioned this before, as ice-free water would have been brought if she had),&quot;the steak I ordered was too expensive for what it is,&quot;and&quot;your restaurant is too loud.&quot;At the end of this 10 minute lecture, she tried to hand him the 50 cents as if she was doing him a favor. He told her, very politely, that it sounded like she needed it more than he did and refused to accept it. Ask yourself - do you really begrudge that 15-20% enough to want to be that miserly old lady?

First, my response was in regards to the poster who tried to claim the increase in PERCENTAGE of tips expected was because SERVICE was better and more involved now then twenty years ago, which is bull crap. Its not.
Second I was a dining room supervisor in a nice hotel restaurant for years, and yes at one point even waited on a few tables, so please stop with the&quot;I waited tables in college so I know all about waiting tables&quot;.
Third, I have ( if anyone actaully reads previous posts rather then jumps into threads without an oar to row their boat) never said,&quot;don&apos;t tip&quot;and I have also clarified that I personally do not penalize waiters for bad food, or even slow service, IF I see their service level is at the best it can be in circumstances.
I&apos;m not about ripping off the&quot;poor waiters.&quot;

It is the American system of public subsidized wages for waiters that is stupid. No other country does this, a seperate minimum wage just for food servers,, so the public can then support the waiters ?? And don&apos;t load on about how costs are built in,, a meal is the same price in Canada as States,, I have eaten out in both countries and the only big difference is the amount some of you seem to think you need to tip. The new push I see is as much as 25 % .. that is just plain wrong.
15 % is enough ,, 20% would be for absolutely OUTSTANDING service, and 5-10% for careless or poor service. If a servier is expected to collect their&quot;livelyhood&quot;off a client, then they had better not try half assed service and expectme to just give them 15 % ,, I don&apos;t teach my kids to be lazy or stupid and the world will support them, so I wouldn&apos;t be tipping a crappy waiter more then 10% either.

I have been a&quot;maitre d&apos;&quot;in a restaurant, as well as server (most people seem to work in that industry at some time), and I think it is also a bunch of doo-doo that service is better now and more difficult. If anything, I think it&apos;s the opposite. Who knows how this idea started about the 20%, but a lot of people just swallow things people tell them -- probably some push by the restaurant industry. The idea of leaving tips on counters for cashiers, basically (like at Starbucks) is really bizarre, also, who tips them? Make as much sense to tip cashiers in super markets or drug stores.

However, there do appear to be some misunderstandings, even among Americans, about wages of serving staff. It is determined by state, there is no national min. wage of $2.13 for waiters. Some states actually do NOT allow them to be paid less than other jobs, they have the same min wage (eg, California, Alaska, and a few others). If there is an allowable minimum below the standard, the state sets it and they also set which jobs it applies to by thresholds. It is not just waiters, necessarily, but any occupation the state sets the standard for as a&quot;tipped profession&quot;.

$2.13 as min wage for a tipped profession is very low, and only occurs in a few states.

This is the table by state regarding the min wage for serving staff and some other things about this issue:

Thanks Alan. I keep trying to clarify this point because it is an extremely important one to me. I asked at my workplace yesterday and one of my coworkers said that here in California, her son did earn less than the standard minimum wage and that it IS different minimum wage than everyone else. I think that is so wrong. They should get at least the same minimum wage and tips should be supplemental.

Christina,
As the page from the DOL&apos;s website that you linked to clearly shows, there is, indeed, a federal minimum wage for waiters/tipped employees, which is $2.13/hour. States are free to set minimum wage rates above that, as they are free to provide greater protections than federal law in a number of different areas. According to the DOL page, there are only 7 states in which the minimum wage is the same for both tipped and non-tipped employees.

Hi NC,

&gt;it was news to me that their minimum wage (if no one tipped) is a separate and lower minimum wage than everyone else. $2.13/hr.

Yup. Certain labor categories are exempted from the minimum wage.

An interesting sidenote: Starbucks has been ordered to apy $100M to its workers because they were taking money from the tip pool to provide bonuses to the store management.

&gt;her son did earn less than the standard minimum wage and that it IS different minimum wage than everyone else. I think that is so wrong. They should get at least the same minimum wage and tips should be supplemental.

Why should one group of people get MW + tips, while others get only MW?

If I work as a shop clerk, shouldn&apos;t I get tips too?

Hi C,

&gt;about wages of serving staff. It is determined by state, there is no national min. wage ... for waiters.

Yes, there is.
See www.opm.gov/oca/wage/minwage.asp 

States may require higher MW and may not permit tip offsets, but they don&apos;t have to.

 
 Report Abuse ncounty on Mar 21, 08 at 01:32 PM 
Ira,

I agree with the disparity. I think everyone should earn the minimum wage and not be exposed to vulnerabilities. IF that were the case, I do agree that shop clerks and anyone else living on minimum wage should also be or not be tipped. It should depend on the excellence of service and generosity of the customer. Basically, our tipping system is grossly incomprehensible to me as it is. Why SHOULD I tip the Starbucks cashier and not the grocery store cashier? That being said, in states where waiters DO earn a normal minimum wage like everyone else, why should I tip them but not the cashier who earns the same amount of money. One could argue that the cashier may be working harder in most stores where there is very little idle time with a constant stream of customers. I do tip generously but in philosophy, I greatly prefer the method in other countries where people are paid a&quot;decent&quot;wage and there is minimal to no tipping. Tipping in many instances has gotten out of hand.....see the thread on whether one should tip the business owner of a salon where you get your hair done. Many there describe paying 150-200 for the hair service and then tipping the stylist AND the salon owner. Yikes, all I could say there was that I am glad I cut my own hair.

Please ! Please! Please ! Please !

After another 100 odd post thread- could someone explain to this thicko in the UK - Why when I dine in the US am I expected to part employ the waiting staff.

Why don&apos;t the restaurant owners meet their responsibilities and pay their staff a decent wage.

They should (like any other busines owner) have control over the business and take huge rewards when times are good. When times are bad they do not. Why expect someone who is clearly an employee of the business to effectively subcontract?

To many visitors to the US, the pricing of menus dining is a total rip off - when you add the expected tip of at least 15% - 25% to the again undisclosed local sales tax the result in nearly a 40% increase in the final bill.

In the UK - in the main what you see on the menu is what you generally pay. If the service is good you will leave a gratuity not a tip.

Seems a far clearly, fairer system for all involved. Other than of course the employer who has to take more risk (which they should of course do).
 Report Abuse xyz123 on Mar 21, 08 at 05:28 PM 
I&apos;ll try to explain...

It&apos;s not a case of fair or better or worse or whatever...

It&apos;s the way the service industry developed....like it or not....

Also most of the employees are not terribly unhappy about the system...as I noted but somebody claimed I was wrong and I am not...a lot of tipping is cash and carry and although the taxing authority, the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) over the years has made attempts to be able to develop systems to figure out who gets what...the system still relies on the honesty of the tippees to report all their tip income which I doubt extremely is done...the only argument one can possibly have is to what extent...let&apos;s get some waiters, hairdressers or anybody else who works with tips on this anonymous bulletin board and have them state how much of their cash tip income they report, as required by law, to their employers so the proper taxes can be withheld and you will get some idea...

You are not subsidizing employers who are cheap..this is the system here (I don&apos;t particularly like it either)...but then again in every walk of life, in every way things are done differently...for example, and it has nothing to do with tipping, I think it is ludicrous that London Underground charges differently depending on the length of a tube ride...it means a whole complicated system has to be used and people are slowed up exiting by having to insert their tickets or having their oyster cards read again...in NY a trip from the top of the Bronx to the tip of Coney Island, every bit as long as a trip from central London to Heathrow costs one fare...no need to do anything on exiting...clearly that is more efficient..is it better??...who knows but that&apos;s the system we have here in NY...in the USA you pay both to make and receive calls on a cell (mobile) phone...in much of the rest of the world only the caller pays...is it better?...who knows but that&apos;s the way we do it here...

Again while I don&apos;t like the system particularly, I always get a kick out of people who claim their system is better...at least here if the service stinks, you have the option of stiffing the waiter...you don&apos;t have to pay for lousy service as intimidated you might feel after reading the thread......

As I said, I try to learn the tipping customs of each country, I don&apos;t complain about it...when in Rome I try to do as Romans do....that&apos;s it...that&apos;s the way it is.

I have worked as housekeeping at a hotel before, and we didn&apos;t get paid very much at all. It was nice to find tips, just a little&quot;thank you&quot;for the service that makes their stay nice, even though they may not see us doing it. Most people don&apos;t, but I try to.

Now I work at a bookstore, with a Seattle&apos;s Best cafe. The cafe workers get tips now, but I think they get paid less than the other employees (which isn&apos;t much), and they have to declare the taxes.

I don&apos;t think any of them would lie about what they got at all. I doubt very many people would feel right doing that, you&apos;d have to be especially jaded to do so. Besides, they don&apos;t get very many tips. Any tips have to be split up between at least two people, if not three, and they usually get less than $10 a night it seems like. A lot of people don&apos;t tip, or even notice that there is a tip jar there!

caladrius..

perhaps I&apos;m not reading your post correctly...do you really think that in those places such as but not limited to Las Vegas where a bartender or waiter in a fancy place can pull in lots of money, especially cash from some of the high rollers who send chips their way, they report all their cash tips? Sure those who are supplementing their income with a few bucks from waiting, who are not in a high tax bracket anyway, will probably report all their tips because it&apos;s the right thing to do (just like when a contracter came to my house and told me he would give me a big discount if I paid in cash rather than with a check...I wonder why).....of course I was only too happy to pay with a check to make sure a record existed so the contracter would pay his fair share of taxes&lt;g&gt;

The tipping system in the USA is indeed one big example of the underground ecnomy allowing so called honest citizens to evade their fair share of taxes and don&apos;t tnhink for one second it is not a big reason why so many can make a career out of bartending or waitressing or dealing (cards at a Las Vegas casino not the other kind of dealing) or....

In some places in London yes, but not everywhere and rare outside London.

I get laughed at for tipping by my friends, they call it a&quot;London thing&quot;and it probably is.

I tend to tip if I have had good service and the tip reflects that service not a percentage of the bill.

Oh and I always tip in cash. I may pay the bill with a card but the tip is always cash so the wwaiting staff and not the restraunt get it.

different places in the world have different tipping practices and different ways of compensating workers within different industries. if you want everything exactly as it is in the UK, then stay home.

some countries like china often have entirely different pricing structures for foreigners. etc, etc.

anyway, here in the uk, we are expected to tip almost to the level of the US in restaurants...but unfortunately, we have to tip but don&apos;t get the good service. your suggestion that you throw down a ha&apos;penny if you receive good service is laughable. in the last few years, more often than not, you will have a tip added automatically to your bill. i think you&apos;re living about three decades behind the times.

as ever, travel is about seeing the positives and negatives in different systems so maybe we can look at it another way. in the US, people overall seem to accept tipping (some even enjoy rewarding good service). waiters work for their tips for the most part...connecting their rewards with the extra effort in their work. in the UK, people generally don&apos;t have a good attitude towards tipping. so now we are forced to tip as it is added automatically in many, many places and waiters do not relate their tips with extra efforts to provide good service. the worst of both worlds, i would say.

2) I now, if disappointed, go and find front of house and detail to him/her exactly what is wrong and how I did not want to make a farce in front of my hosts/guests. Clearly I don&apos;t tip and cross out all automatic tips if this is required
3) If service has been good I round up to the nearest£10 assuming a min of 5% and a max of 10% and I thank the waiter for his/her good service.

First of all, I doubt that all Americans do this. Perhaps they tip more than the local standard, but probably not at the 20% level we&apos;re used to. Some want to be generous if everything was great, and few expect to hear complaints or grumbling about OVER-tipping. Also, there&apos;s the idea of&quot;when in doubt&quot;, where if one isn&apos;t clear on the local standard it&apos;s better to tip well than to under-tip.

alan&apos;s points are good. And whether all Europeans want to believe this or not, most European waiters are NOT stupid. They actually EXPECT better tips from Americans and yes, they do appreciate them.

And I&apos;ve said it a million times, but I consider myself a rather&quot;high maintenance&quot;customer in most European restaurants. I often ask what a lot of things are or how they are prepared. I generally ask detailed help with the wine. When a waiter doesn&apos;t glare at me as if I&apos;m taking up his time, and specifically when he is overly friendly and helpful to me, I certainly like to reward him with a little extra for the way he has treated me and for taking the extra time for someone who doesn&apos;t speak the language.

Well, I&apos;m sure this post will shock and horrify Fodorite&apos;s on many levels... My family and I were in Spain this week and on the way to the Malaga airport wanted to stop at the Picasso Museum. There was a marathon of some sort going on in the city and traffic was blocked and we couldn&apos;t drive to the museum so my husband stayed with the car and my kids and I walked off to the museum.

Afterward, we needed to get something quickly to eat, meetup with my husband and rush to the airport to catch our flight home. We were starving and nothing was open for a quick meal but McDonalds. I haven&apos;t eaten there in a billion years (although I used to work there as a teenager) and I&apos;m a pretty finicky eater, but our options were limited.

We went in and placed a pretty large order of sandwiches, drinks and fries. Well, our Spanish isn&apos;t very good, but a sweet young man and womanbehind the counter cheerfully helped us and after a lot of pointing and sign-language rang us up. The servers cheerfully packed everything securely and beautifully to go so we could eat in the car. These 2 young people couldn&apos;t have been nicer and more efficient. They even remembered the straws, napkins and ketchup without our asking, which almost never happens when you get takeout...

I remember when I worked at McDonald&apos;s we weren&apos;t allow to accept tips. Well, that was a zillion years ago and I&apos;m sure the rules have changed. I handed the 2 kids who helped us a few euros as a tip and they were really tickled. Well, they deserved it, since they were so pleasant and helpful and I bet they make very little.

I know I&apos;ve broken serious tipping rules, but it was worth seeing their smiles and I hope I encouraged them to keep up their great attitudes toward helpless and hungry foreigners.

It was nice what they did though, and you know, they were probaly nice to you , because of how you acted, not because they expected a tip. Its a weird cycle,,we want to reward people, but I also am wary of teaching kids to expect immediate gratification for doing their jobs( as opposed to waiting till pay day, when they are employed in a non tip job)

Pay and working conditions continue to go up in most western countries, but I can&apos;t say service levels have improved much ,, can you?
