 How to make a Big Mac at home, via McDonald&apos;s Canada [Video] 
 July 10, 2012 | By Tiffany Hsu McDonald&apos;s Canada is extending its open-door policy with a new video, this time showing executive chef Dan Coudreaut walking through the steps to prepare a Big Mac at home. Except that the final product looks less like what&apos;s delivered through a drive-through and more like an unwieldy stuffed bagel. But more on that later. Last month, the company let consumers see how it primps its food for the camera, filming the process used to turn an uninspiring store-bought burger into the sumptuous sandwich seen in ads. In McDonald&apos;s newest video, the star is Coudreaut, the chef who last month claimed that he couldn&apos;t find “anything on the menu that&apos;s unhealthy.” PHOTOS: Fast food gets outrageous He shows up wearing a white chef&apos;s jacket but quickly ditches it, saying: “I&apos;m gonna be a little less formal and I&apos;m gonna take off my uniform and we&apos;re just gonna have some fun cooking.” Using only ingredients bought from grocery stores, he demonstrates what goes between the the heel, club and crown of a Big Mac (that&apos;s the bottom, middle and top bun portions, according to Coudreaut) Advertisement SPORTS

 Mitt Romney campaign has awkward moments in Ohio 
 May 7, 2012 | By Seema Mehta, Los Angeles Times EUCLID, Ohio - Mitt Romney&apos;s campaign events tend to be picture-perfect and planned with such attention to detail that a late start might be considered a failure. By that measure, Monday was a rare day when the campaign went off-track. A backer introduced Romney by slamming President Obama for taking credit for the killing of Osama bin Laden, comparing Obama to Ronald McDonald. And when a woman said Obama should be tried for treason, Romney didn&apos;t disagree and asked the woman to follow up her question. NEWS 
 City&apos;s Solution to Its Identity McCrisis 
 September 18, 1998 | MARTIN MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER In the battle for the public imagination, the hope here is that Ronald McDonald and his Big Macs will drop-kick Al Davis and his Oakland Raiders right through the golden arches. It&apos;s been nearly a decade since Davis burned the city for $10 million by backing out of a commitment to move the Raiders to Irwindale. And yet this memory seems to be the only one people have of this town of 1,100 residents. What about the positives, city officials and residents ask, like the new speedway? BUSINESS

 Economy Factors In 
 September 21, 1997 In the article headlined &quot;Low Budget Is Not Necessarily Best for Association&quot; (Real Estate, Sept. 7), I think the following point is missing: In a disinflationary era, there are lots of contracts and services obtained at lower cost without compromising quality. Let&apos;s take a look at the following figures to illustrate my point of view. In 1980, a barrel of oil cost $40. A gallon of regular gas, $1.50. A Big Mac, $1.99. In 1997, a barrel of oil costs $19. A gallon of gas, $1.50. ENTERTAINMENT

 The buck stops here 
 November 18, 2007 | Avital Binshtock, Special to The Times Americans may learn best about global economics when they&apos;re traveling. Our beloved dollar?

To demonstrate, here is a comparison of typical travel purchases at last week&apos;s exchange rates. The prices listed here were derived from information from a variety of experts, including tourist bureaus, hotel concierges, bartenders, taxi dispatchers, pricing websites and so on. NEWS

 McDonald&apos;s CEO Jim Skinner to retire 
 March 22, 2012 | By Emily Bryson York Big Macs aren&apos;t going anywhere, of course, nor is the Egg McMuffin. As McDonald&apos;s Corp. begins its chief executive transition, expect very little to change in the short term. But down the road, future CEO Don Thompson will have to sell more of them and in more places overseas, as Asia and international expansion loom large. The Oak Brook, Ill., company announced late Wednesday that longtime CEO Jim Skinner will retire at the end of June and that his chief operating officer, Thompson, long considered heir apparent, will take his place.

 Chew on this! Critics sink their teeth into red meat study 
 March 13, 2012 | By Eryn Brown, Los Angeles Times / for the Booster Shots blog On Monday, researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health released a study that linked red meat consumption with increased risk of early death. Probably not surprisingly, the report , which was published in the Archives of Internal Medicine along with the editorial “ Holy Cow! What&apos;s Good For You Is Good For Our Planet ” from Dr. Dean Ornish (the man who helped convince Bill Clinton to go vegan ), attracted a lot of interest.  The American Meat Institute was among the first to dispute the findings.  In a statement issued Monday, the industry group criticized the Harvard study for “relying on notoriously unreliable self-reporting about what was eaten and obtuse methods to apply statistical analysis to the data.” During an interview last week with The Times, Kaiser Permanente cancer researcher Lawrence H. Kushi - who was not involved with the Harvard study but said the work produced “important results&quot; - acknowledged that epidemiological studies of survey data aren&apos;t as rigorous as a blinded, randomized trial.

 In-N-Out vs. CaliBurger: Double-Double trouble in Shanghai 
 February 10, 2012 | By Tiffany Hsu and David Pierson, Los Angeles Times Millions of Chinese have come to love Big Macs and Whoppers. So when a California-inspired chain put up signs in Shanghai announcing the coming of the Double-Double, local burger lovers rejoiced. The same can&apos;t be said of In-N-Out. The Irvine-based company doesn&apos;t operate any stores in China. So its owners were miffed to see a red-and-yellow doppelganger called CaliBurger laying claim to its signature burger, touting &quot;Animal Style&quot; fries topped with cheese, special sauce and onions, and planning to serve thick shakes in palm-tree-print cups.

Herman Cain, chowing down at a Miami restaurant, asks, “How do you say &apos;delicious&apos; in Cuban?” Newt Gingrich uses “bilingual education” and “language of living in a ghetto” in the same sentence. And then there&apos;s Mitt Romney, son of a Mexican-born Mormon who also ran for president of the United States. Or the “United Estates,” according to Romney&apos;s mysterious alter-Tweeter, @MexicanMitt , who&apos;s muy simpatico with his staunch “supporter” Alcaraz. BUSINESS

 McDonald&apos;s unveils Chicken McBites and strong earnings 
 January 24, 2012 | By Tiffany Hsu McDonald&apos;s now has its eye on the KFC customer, launching its new Chicken McBites in the U.S. on the same day that it announced record revenue of $27 billion for 2011. The variation on popcorn chicken, featuring chicken breast and home-style seasoning, will complement the fast food giant&apos;s existing poultry menu items such as the McNuggets and McChicken sandwiches. The McBites will be available in 3-ounce snack, 5-ounce regular and 10-ounce sharable sizes through April 20. The new offering is one of the many tactics McDonald&apos;s is trying to stay ahead of what Chief Executive James A. Skinner called “significant headwinds” in the industry, including flat to slow growth, low consumer confidence and volatile commodity prices that are expected to rise as much as 5.5% in the U.S. this year. 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | Next Copyright 2012 Los Angeles Times Terms of Service | Privacy Policy
