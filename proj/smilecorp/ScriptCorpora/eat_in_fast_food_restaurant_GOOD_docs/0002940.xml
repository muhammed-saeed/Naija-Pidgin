 Happy Mail and Pink Paislee 
 
Look what arrived at my door on Monday...

 

That definately cheered up a day which was filled with the hoover, bleach and hard labour, both at work and home.

Thanks Susanne for making my day.

Here is my LO for this months In Good Company .

 SUPPLIES: Pink Paislee &apos;Butterfly Garden&apos;
Pink Paislee Wood Veneers
Pink Paislee (Mist).a.bles
Studio Calico Mists - Pony, Green Gable
Papermania Capsule Collection Flowers


 
 Yep, it&apos;s Pink Paislee this time and meant I had to use the paper which I had been scared of  saving for ages. I adored the paper but as soon as I got it home, it was just too pretty to use. I hate that half of my paper collection is like that! The good thing is that using the paper as the background requires little other embellishment so just a few flowers and butterflies and a bit of mist on the letters and we are done :)

The picture is from my graduation 13 years ago!!! imagine :s. It is the official picture and while I am not overly fond of it, the frame was decomposing a bit so I wanted to get it on a page. I cut up the frame using the oval aperture and university emblem on the LO. There isn&apos;t much journalling, just the date, place and degree as while I have plenty of stories to tell of the day, they didn&apos;t seem to fit the picture..although I may do a 6x12 page on the side for the journalling now I am talking about it....

Come and join in if you have any Pink Paislee papers you want to use up. It&apos;s a great way to really use your stash.:)

And while I am here, I am going to join in with Jennifers Scrapbooking Soiree . It&apos;s like a virtual party where everyone shares what they are up to with their scrapping and you have till the 7th August to join in. See you there?

 Euro 2012...MIN June 
 
A bit late again. And the worst part is I have had my notes sitting on the table all week :s. Still, I am in front of the computer for the first time in 4 days so here goes...

You can probably tell that the month, for me, was all about the football.  4 weeks of 22 men playing with a ball. And, for the first week, 2 games a day, every day, which coincided perfectly with my break between nights. Needless to say, all other activities were suspended for me from 5pm onwards unless they involved a pub with the football on the telly....which a few times, it did the dis advantage of living opposite the local :p 

 The decorations in the pub  
 I watched the matches on 3 channels...RTE 2, ITV and BBC, the latter being my preferred channel and the only one I forgot to photograph incidentally.  
 
 Being a Brit living in Ireland, I couldn&apos;t hang my flag out the window, so I made one out of felt that I had inherited from the bosses late Gran. 
 I made an Irish flag out of cardstock, then with the newly embellished Radio Times wallchart attached, I sewed the 2 together.  I am thinking of using it as a cover for a minibook for the tournament as I am loath to throw it out. 

 


It had pride of place on the wall by my chair for the month....the boss, while he enjoys football, doesn&apos;t have the same obsession dedication that I have for the game.

Now, before I chuck some numbers at you, I better tell you that I am including the final, even though it was played on the 1st July. It might be cheating a little but since I wanted to get the whole tournament stats in, then I guess, today, I am a cheat!

Ok, 25 games were played overall with 18 of them in the group stages. There were 16 countries involved overall.
 
 
 Spain scored the most goals.... 12 in total, with a third of them being in the final against Italy. Incidentally, that was the 2nd time in the tournament that those 2 countries met, the first being in the group stages where they drew 1-1. 
 
 
 Italy and Spain both had to go through penalty shootouts to get to the final, Spain winning 4-2 against Portugal in the semis and Italy beating England of course, like we could ever get through a tournament of any kind without having to play at penalties :(   4-2. 
 
 
 There were 3 red cards shown and 119 yellow cards. 
 
 
 6 players scored 3 goals each to get the Golden Boot...Torres, Gomez, Dzagolev, Mandazukic, Balotelli and Ronaldo. 
 
 
 France v England had the ball most in play during any one game - 76% 
 
 
 England stats were: 4 games, 2 wins, 1 draw, 1 loss, 1 penalty shootout, 5 goals scored. 

Spain have won 3 major tournaments in a row: Euro 2008, World Cup 2010, and this one. They are the first country ever to do this. Iker Casillas, who plays for Spain, is also the only player ever to have played in 100 winning international games.

I guess that will do you, before I seriously bore all you non football people. I will now send you on your merry way to Julie  who will tell you more about Month in Numbers for those of you who are new to this and want to join in.

And, I will leave you with my feet...well, my very patriotic Docs to be exact. yes, I wore them to the pub for the France v England game and it was very tempting to wave them in the air when we scored but I didn&apos;t, much to the relief of the boss lol 
 
 
 
 
 


 All stats taken from The Irish Sun.

 In Good Company? I sure am :) 
 
This month, I have remembered to join in with  In Good Company  at Susannes blog. I say &apos;remembered&apos; because, after finding out about it at Alisons blog last month, I was all up for joining in. I had a Sassfras LO all completed the day before, then completely forgot all about it! Doh!  
 
 
 So, Susanne posts a challenge every month getting you to look through your stash and use anything from a particular brand name. All in the name of using your stuff.  
 
 
 This month is October Afternoon. I don&apos;t usually focus on using a particular brand as a jumping off point but it was a great challenge and I laid out the papers before I picked the photo.  


 
 Below is a list of all the products used: 
 
Tim Holtz Kraft cardstock
Papermania capsule collection
OA Sasparilla high noon (for half the title) and stagecoach papers
OA letter stickers
Sassafras for SC butterfly stickers and paper
Fabrics and washi tape
Elles Studio tag
Distress Inks: Chipped Sapphire

The photo incidentally is another occasion of me wearing a rarely seen dress in my teenage years. It seems to be the only time I would let my picture get taken because of the stir i wished to create lol. And the jacket I am wearing? It was my Dads wedding suit jacket. I had the whole thing (I loved the flares) and am now on the search for some photo evidence of me in it. I am not sure there is one though :(

 Month In Numbers - May 
 
 
May was the month of the Scala choir.

 It just about trumps anything else I did this month including the 12 hours I spent at a friends wedding (a long time for me, I usually bail before the fun starts!), the 92 points the boss&apos;s golf team scored to claim 7th in the tournament and win us a meal for 2 in a local restaurant and the 2 random prize draws I won in a week *yay*.

The boss loves Scala and Kolacny Brothers (to give them their full title). He heard they were playing in Dublin at the beginning of the month so having a little money left over after buying my new camera, I picked up a couple of tickets. You see, the boss is not much of a concert goer, whereas I will go to see anyone, so when he tells me about a date, I will jump through hoops to get him ...and me, there.

Incase you have never heard of them, here is a taster of how great they are....

 
There are tons of videos on YouTube and they do covers of loads of popular songs, including Smells like Teen Spirit, Creep, Under the Bridge and Bittersweet Symphony to name but a few. To find out a bit more about them, you can find them here .

So, the day in numbers goes as follows:

 16.02 train to Dublin....the journey takes around 2 hours and costs €40 return. The bus costs €17 less but the journey is less comfortable, it takes half an hour more and the travel times are less frequent.

 60 seconds walk from our hotel..The Fitzsimmons...to the Olympia Theatre. Good choice by the boss and it only cost us €90 for the night, which in Dublin on a Saturday night at short notice is pretty good.

 €3.50 a pint till 8pm in The Turk so took advantage of that. They were showing the Heineken Cup final and we managed to catch the end...Leinster beat Ulster 42-16 so the locals were mighty happy.

The show started at 8pm and we were in Row M, seats 5/6 which was a pretty good view (and situated close to the bar and toilets...always a bargain in my eyes). I have always liked the Olympia...it is a beautiful building and the accoustics are brilliant in it.

The support band were a Donegal country/folk band called The Henry Girls and they were fantastic.

Then at around 9pm , the main event started and I have to say, they were everything we expected and 100 times more. I found watching the brothers fascinating, especially conducting the girls. They connected really well with the audience and an hour and a half really wasn&apos;t long enough. They sang a few well known songs as well as some original pieces. And much to the boss&apos;s delight, they also played his favourite, Yellow.
(26 September, they are the O2 in London.....I hugely recommend it)

And, that is my month. Cut off a bit short admittedly but this is probably the 5th draft I have written and thats it....my brain just can&apos;t cope anymore lol.

So, thanks for looking and do pop here to get a link to Julies Pinterest board and visit a few other participants

Oh, and I better warn you now, June will consist largely of Euro 2012 ....so if you dislike the beautiful game, sorry!!! ;) Posted by dogmatix at 11:12 AM 5 comments: Email This BlogThis! Share to Twitter Share to Facebook

 I may start crying!!! 
 I want to move on with my Cover to Cover work ... lots of notes but no physical work done.

I want to scrap but now I finally have time to do some, Jean has fled (newly christened creating gene!!!) .

I want to write my Month in Numbers post but can&apos;t seem to get the flow going. I am proud I have lots of notes to pick from though (and you can go here to find out more and get links to others while I procrastinate)

I know this is the reason why I am having brain freeze.....


 
I want to leave it till next week when I have my days off between nights so more time to organise.

I guess what I want just won&apos;t fly today if I want Jean to return....reckon she left in protest!

I think I want to cry at this point as this is such an ongoing issue!

 O, Jean just whispered to me there is a LO in the making here and if I do a little now, my reward will be a short visit of encouragement. 

See ya later :)

 RIP Robin Gibb 
 I love the Bee Gees. Their songs are ones that I go to when I need cheering up because you can&apos;t help but smile and sing along.

Such a sad day that Robin has passed. RIP :(

 Organising....!!?? 
 

Organising is something I thought I was reasonably good at. The boss begs to differ on the strength of my room. He does have a point I suppose, but at least it&apos;s an organised mess...as in I know where everything is and he doesn&apos;t have to ;)

However, recently I have noticed that I am a great list maker but a poor completer of these lists. Now, I am working on changing the completing part but I love that todays prompt is all about the list part :)

 Yep, I know I have skipped prompt 5 here but as I am currently on nights, i think some of these will be jumbled a bit depending on my sleep pattern which can be poor to say the least. I am blogging and that, for me, is an achievement in itself :) 
 
 
Now, in the interest of complete transparency, I haven&apos;t made this list yet. I only just read the prompt to be honest. But I have a few ideas of what albums I would like to have and it is just a case of getting it down on paper and starting.

Since I don&apos;t have a system at the moment, this should be relatively easy to get started. Not too much shuffling, just albums to purchase. And so far, I have ideas for albums on each of the nieces and nephews, heritage, early years (family), early years (me), our life (now), our life (since we met), wedding, me, him.

But then Shimelle got me thinking. I have several lists dotted around the house about ideas for pages. Maybe I need to use these (did I mention something about collecting this list before?) and see how they would fit into each of these lists. You see, while I like the list I have, I am not sure if it is exactly what I want. I am sure there needs to be some refining somewhere. I am sure there are some aspects of my life that I could document and not realise, so it is a good chance to look at where I am at the moment will work great in conjunction with my OLW 
 
 
All this thought process from what is effectively a bit of homework on organising.

Which, I better go and do, since I have to hunt these bits of paper down and eat something before I leave in half an hour :s

xx
