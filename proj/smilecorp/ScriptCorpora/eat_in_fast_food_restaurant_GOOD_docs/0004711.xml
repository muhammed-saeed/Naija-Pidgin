Road Food Pursuits - Minnetonka Drive In
 What a gorgeous day! Any time you can get a 70 degree day in Minnesota, you have to take advantage. After a long run this morning in beautiful conditions, I ventured over to the west side ot the Twin Cities metro to do a little shopping. Also, I sought out a place for lunch that was like taking a step back it time.
