 Healthy Lunch Foods to Lose Weight

Lunch acts as an important meal, helping to provide you with the energy and nutrients you need to get through the second half of the day. While you&apos;re traveling, working or on-the-go, you may be tempted to pick up a lunch meal in a fast-food restaurant or vending machine. Don&apos;t do it, as these are often high in calories and fats and may contribute to weight gain. Instead, pack your own lunch made with healthy ingredients that fill you up without giving you unnecessary calories and fats.
 
Salad

Salads make for a great lunch if you pair the vegetables with a lean protein source, reports the Weight-control Information Network run by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The vegetables give you fiber and vitamins, while the protein source keeps you full. The network suggests any basic salad---example ingredients include lettuce, spinach and colorful veggies like bell peppers---and grilled chicken. Stay away from creamy dressings that are often high in fats.
 
Yogurt

Yogurt forms a low-salt, low-calorie lunch foundation that&apos;s great for your heart and your waistline, according to the Mayo Clinic. The clinic suggests packing a cup of low-fat plain yogurt---defined as yogurt with a labeled fat percentage of 1 percent or less---and 1/2 cup of fresh fruit, plus a cup of raw vegetables. The vegetables fill you with bulky, low-calorie fiber. The yogurt gives you a dose of filling protein, plus bone-building calcium. And the fruit acts as a vitamin-rich dessert to satiate any sugar cravings you may have.
 
Chili

A bean-rich chili nets you lots of filling fiber and protein, without very many calories. The Louisville Metro Public Health suggestsÂ¾cup of chili paired with an ounce of baked corn chips as a festive, warm and low-calorie lunch. If you want dessert, the metro suggests a couple slices of sweet melon and a cup of yogurt. Although specific calorie ranges will vary widely depending on the exact chili recipe, the metro summarizes that it should run you less than 400 calories.
 
Sandwiches

Sandwiches are cheap and convenient to make and pack. When crafting your lunch, the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute recommends low-fat cold cuts on top of whole-grain bread. The institute states that such cold cuts can often yield 97 percent less fat than traditional lunch meats. If you want condiments, stay away from mayo. Instead, the University of Illinois Extension suggests mustard.
 
Pita Bread

If you find sandwiches too boring or traditional, you can upgrade to whole wheat pita bread, suggests Kaiser Permanente, a national health insurance company. For a healthy lunch that&apos;s low in processed carbs and fat, the insurance company recommends filling a pita pocket with egg salad--combine 3 hard boiled eggs with a couple tablespoons of low-fat or fat-free mayo--and a couple leaves of spinach or lettuce. In the end, you&apos;ll have a high-fiber, high-protein lunch that keeps you full without empty calories.
