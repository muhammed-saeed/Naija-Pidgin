so we don&apos;t have masses of alts.

One possibility is that your standings are below -2 with either his corp or faction.

If that&apos;s not it, I don&apos;t know. I&apos;d heard some of them weren&apos;t working properly, but this was several months ago.

1: They didn&apos;t force you to get a billion isks worth of crap in your head. 

No they didn&apos;t but this is why I have 75 mil skill points and 324 skills and can fly any ship and use any weapon short of a Titan but I can use the DD.

 Originally by: Theo Samaritan[/quote 

2: They didn&apos;t force you to mission for a corp with no med bays. 
Yes they did, what part about faction missions didnt you understand. Yes the very missions that you need to get your standing up to play FW are given by a NPC Corp that have no jump clone facilities, really does that make sense?

 Originally by: Theo Samaritan[/quote 
3: If this is a troll, 7/10, its believable. 

Am I up to at least 9/10

My point is I am the exact type of player they are trying to get into FW but:

1. I have to leave my corp of which I am a Director.

2. I have to have a Faction standing of .5, I have a +8.9 but while I am spending my time doing those I could have done missions for the Caldari Navy. At least they have Med Bays in the support facilities even though there are only 3 in all of Black Rise.

3. You need a standing of +8 with an NPC Corp to use their clone facilities to use a jump clone and a lot of people dont realize that not all NPC corps have Med bays.

I know its only the second day but out of about 450,000 (220000 accounts X 2.1) active characters only 9000 have signed up so far how many because of the conditions above.
 

or as a director you could have signed up your entire corp if it has the faction standing of 0.5 or higher.

Its not like their are not player run ways of getting jump clones, 0.0 outposts, do you know that if you have no standings for a faction but a corp does that the their standing can get you jump clones not your personal standings? (left corp started one and used that to get other corp mbrs thier jumpclones then returned).

Clue get one numbnuts...

CCP currently cant get .03% of their present player base to participate in FW but either I am supposed to convince 100% of my corp mates to participate or force them to join? Oh yeah that will work.

So as the only corp member of 5 years that can built Tech2 equipment, I am supposed to leave my corp, go to 0.0 with my implants through countless gate camps that can use bubbles find an outpost I can use, start up another Corp wait a few days just so I can get Jump Clones that are still in 0.0 mind you, that I should have been able to access from an NPC corp that I have been doing faction missions for the last 4 years?

Sure let me get right on that.

No.
If you&apos;ve got access to a Rorq with a vat bay, you can get a clone through that as well.
You can use your social skills to talk to data center agents and give them rat tags.
You can visit the cosmos area of the faction you want to join and run a few missions there.

Or...
You can stay on the forums and whine incessantly about your inability to understand simple concepts like these.
For someone with your, much vaunted, experience and time-in-game, you sure are a whingey bugger.
Are you sure you didn&apos;t buy your character from someone with a clue? Still have the receipt? You may want to send it back.

You know I am not saying anything different than other people have basically have been posting, that this whole FW thing was a half ass not very well thought out buggy mess(your own NPC&apos;s shoot at you for gods sake). Then when I point out another aspect namely the jump clone situation and nobody can give me a workable solution other than spending the next 2 weeks running boring missions, leaving my Corp and going into 0.0 or spending 1.7 billion ISK on a ship I don&apos;t need, rather than agreeing with me you feel the need to insult me.

I have been reading this crap for five years and just when I think it can&apos;t get any worse, I am again reminded what a immature sociopathic group play this game. If you can&apos;t come up a workable solution just say so and agree the game mechanics suck. Lower the requirements for Jump Clones or make all the NPC&apos;s that give faction missions also have Clone facilities, Simple. Having to completely change your style of game play to participate in an expansion regardless if its free or not is absurd.

I find it hard to believe that Caldari Navy has no medical facilities on their stations. Your 9.51 standing should be plenty.

Maybe wrong sequence, you need to use them in this order:

/Start
System: Abenync
- Wenda - 10 serpentis copper tag (0.0)

System: Ekuenbiron
- Beteux - 10 serpentis copper tag (0.0)

System: Muer
- Jaak - 10 Serpentis Copper tag (0.0)
- Blique - 20 Serpentis Bronze tag (1.0)
- Alliot - 20 Serpentis Silver tag (2.0)
- Mobas - 20 Serpentis Brass tag (3.0)
- Alon - 20 Serpentis Palladium tag (4.0)
- Amatin - 20 Serpentis Gold tag (4.75)
- Fims - 20 Serpentis Electrum tag (5.0)
- Hana - 20 Serpentis Crystal tag (5.0)
- Carvaire - 20 Serpentis Platinum tag (6.0)

And after 4 years I still can&apos;t belive that for a sandbox game there are so many people that wil whine about not having all of what they want delivered to them with no sacrfice on their part...

Christ for jump clones all it takes is one person in your corp to have the required standings to leave start a throw away corp (whos standings will be the corps standings), then quickly cycle your corp mbrs that want A jump clone through the throw away corp.

Tis not rocket science you know.

Sorry. I don&apos;t understand your rant. My character is new, is less than 6 months old but already has a standing of 7.77 with Caldari Navy. He runs missions, manufactures&amp;has fun. Your arguement is just full of lazy excuses for not doing. I just focused with a level 1 agent, moved to a level 2 when I could&amp;so on. I did not particulary do any grinding- most of the big increases are given to me by agent missions. I just don&apos;t see the problem-all the FM faction not enough standing whiners want something for nothing&amp;that is not going to happen.

My &quot;Focus&quot; was on manufacturing and research rather than mission running. Running multiple research agents can be just as lucrative as mission running, you just don&apos;t get the higher Corp standing when doing research missions, however they do count toward Faction Missions. Unfortunately you don&apos;t get to choose what NPC Corps you get the faction missions from and in my case they were from Rapid Assembly who I now have a 7.0 standing with but have no Clone Facilities. So now I have the skills and resources to participate in Faction Warfare but I am unwilling to risk loosing my implants and an expensive clone because podding is prevalent in FW.

It is not a case of being &quot;lazy&quot; I just took a different route and because of CCP game mechanics I am now left wanting. You state that you have been &quot;Focused&quot; on mission running for 6 months with the Caldari Navy and yet you still don&apos;t have the standings to use their Med bays? I worked just as hard as you did for over twice as long using a different toy in the sandbox but now that I have the faction standing it is useless.
 
 Epidemis Posted - 2008.06.13 16:02:00 - [ 45 ]   Originally by: Vivisacia 0.5 is not a lot at all.

I did 2 months of lvl 4 grinding and got to 9.98...

Even just a few days of missions will get you up very quickly... 
Failpost. Lvl 1 and 2 missions provides way less standing in addition to being generally way more annoying to do due to their monetary awards.

There are several corps out there, that for a small fee (5 mil approx) will let you join them, set jump clones in high sec , and leave before the next downtime. This is because they have 8.0+ standings with several empire corporations that have jump clones, and as such, you can use the corp standings to set jump clones.

for you, i would go that route. You don&apos;t need to leave your current corp for more than a day, you don&apos;t need to go to 0.0, or brave lowsec, and you can simply join, set as many JC&apos;s as you can, then leave again. This achieves your goal.

 http://www.eve-wiki.net/index.php?title=Algintal_COSMOS

its not all perfectly clear and its by no means 100% accurat information but its good enough to make it so that any nardtard could figure it out from there...all you need is those 3 websites and if you cant get your faction standings up above 6.0 with any 2 factions in a week (assuming your not a day 1 char) then your a reeree and you need to submit your current pilot into biomass...then shoot yourself. 

P.S. I dont want any crybabys telling me &quot;wah wah, i dont have money for gold tags&quot; go farm them you giant douchebag.

You can get to 0.5 in one or two days.

Do the introductory missions for that faction, then do 2 maybe 3 storylines.

or go to the State Data Centers and spend the money to buy the tags to boost your standings up almost instantly.

Or run some COSMOS missions.

Note that killing asteroid rats, mission rats, and doing non storyline missions does absolutely nothing to raise your faction standings. 

Fast (even if a bit boring) system: go to eachh starting NPC station of your race and do the 2 episody arc &quot;Keeping crime in check&quot;. the second mission is a storyline, so you will be racking up 9 storylines this way (each starting NPC corp has at least 3 starting stations, 1 agent giving that mission in each station).

In 1 station for each NPC corp you will find a second agent giving a 10 episode story arc, with a storyline at the end. doing all those missions will put you very near .5 unmodified faction standing.

So how am I supposed to hand him the tags? 

I&apos;ve been to datacenters for Gallente and Caldari, both had 6-8 agents floating in space.
When you start only the lowest level agent will talk to you, once you are done with it the
next one in line will be available to you. Just try them all out, one will respond.
Just be carefull not to take missions from datacenter agents that require tags that you can not
afford, like I did, the penalty was &quot;fun&quot; . 
 MiIitary Genius Posted - 2008.07.28 08:13:00 - [ 53 ]   I made an alt and with a few hours following instructions at:
 http://blogs.chimpswithkeyboards.com/vanhemlock/archive/2008/06/16/1958.aspx and I could have gone for either gallente or minnie factions as I had&gt;0.5 standing with both.

Note that I had 2.5mil sp&apos;s and so it might have gone a bit easier for me than someone in 900k sp&apos;s.
