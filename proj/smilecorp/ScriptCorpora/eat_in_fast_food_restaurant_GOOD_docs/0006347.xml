2nd Abduction Hurts Custody Bid
 
Dcfs Changes Its Goal To Unite Azizarab, Son
 November 01, 1999 | By Janan Hanna, Tribune Staff Writer. 
When Rahim Azizarab was convicted the first time for abducting his son, state child welfare authorities said they would stick to their goal of uniting father and son permanently.

But after his second child-abduction conviction in September, for which he was sentenced to 18 months in prison, that goal has changed. Azizarab now faces losing his parental rights.
 
Prosecutors representing the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services in a custody proceeding, asked a judge last week for a permanency hearing where they are expected to argue the child should remain in foster care.

Illinois Department of Children and Family Services spokeswoman Delores Walton said the agency had changed its &quot;return home&quot; goal.

And Azizarab said, during an interview from jail early last month, that DCFS case workers told him they would seek to terminate his parental rights.

Walton would not confirm that DCFS would seek to terminate his rights, saying such decisions will be left to DuPage Judge Elizabeth Sexton, who has been presiding over Azizarab&apos;s efforts to win custody of his son for nearly two years.

Azizarab, 41, who had been allowed to visit his son, has not seen him since Azizarab was arrested in April in Indiana, where he had fled with his son after locking two case workers in his Maywood home. They had been supervising a visit between Azizarab and his son.

&quot;DCFS is finally going after what they&apos;ve wanted all along: to take this child from his father,&quot; said Azizarab&apos;s attorney, Timothy Whelan. &quot;It&apos;s unfortunate because he (Azizarab) gave them the tools to do it. I don&apos;t think it would benefit the child.&quot;

The complicated history of the child began in February 1997, when he was born with traces of cocaine in his system. The child&apos;s plight is outlined in nearly 200 pages of DCFS case reports.

According to those reports, the boy&apos;s mother refused social services and asked that he be placed for adoption.

Another man first claimed to be the father. But Azizarab, a computer programmer who emigrated from Iran 20 years ago and who was a former boyfriend of the baby&apos;s mother, believed he was. A subsequent paternity test proved Azizarab was the father.

From the start, however, Azizarab objected to what he was asked to do in order to take his child home.

For example, DCFS case worker Linda Lentz reported that on Feb. 3, 1998, Azizarab, who was asked to meet for a second time with a psychologist, was unhappy with the request. &quot;He then agreed (to complete the evaluation) but went on to state many negative comments about our legal system. He further stated that he feels Andrew (the name DCFS gave to the child) is not being cared for and is being kept in a `dog pound.&apos; &quot;

The stage was set for an antagonistic relationship.

Meanwhile, case reports show the child&apos;s foster parents had expressed a strong desire to adopt the child, and were saddened to learn his biological father had stepped forward.

&quot;Foster parent still reports that Andrew has great difficulties in sleeping through the night from Thursdays after visits with father up until two or three days following,&quot; reads a case report of March 2, 1998.
 
But DCFS workers found no compelling evidence Azizarab wouldn&apos;t be a good father. During supervised visits, he interacted well with the boy, and a psychologist&apos;s report indicated he loved his child and wanted to raise him.

His constant outbursts in court and his disdain for the process of unification seemed to stem, according to case workers, from cultural differences.

In a March 31, 1998, memo, Lentz recounts a conversation she had with the child&apos;s guardian--a legal advocate for the child--: &quot;I explained a little of what the court-ordered evaluation indicated and that it revealed most of our concerns are culturally based in regards to Mr. Azizarab&apos;s outbursts and the way he treats his son as if he&apos;s a possession.&quot;

Still, Azizarab was angry at the slow bureaucratic process, according to the case reports. He also complained that his son was bruised, sick and taken out without a coat.

By June 1998, case workers indicated they were afraid of Azizarab because he was &quot;out of control.&quot; A male caseworker was assigned to join Lentz in working out a solution.

In July 1998, Azizarab abducted his son for the first time, fleeing with the boy from a fast-food restaurant in Glen Ellyn. The child was not harmed, and Azizarab was offered a deal from prosecutors to plead guilty to a lesser charge, but he refused. He was convicted after a jury trial, and a DuPage judge sentenced him to a term of probation.

Despite the problems, Azizarab was getting more visits with his son, and had been granted unsupervised visits for a period.

In April, he locked two DCFS case workers in his home and drove to Indiana, where he was arrested three days later.

Police in Decatur, Ind., told reporters Azizarab had reached for a loaded gun that was in plain view on the back seat of the car. During Azizarab&apos;s sentencing hearing for the first abduction case, a police officer testified that the gun was in a zipped carrying case in the console between the front passenger and driver seat. There was no mention that he had reached for it.

During his trial in Cook County court on his second arrest, the issue of the gun didn&apos;t arise, but police mentioned there was a knife between the front passenger and driver seat, and that the child was not in a car seat.

The custody case is scheduled for a status hearing Dec. 7, at which time Judge Sexton is expected to set a date to begin the permanency hearing.
