 Have You Just Been Issued With Another 

 Needless Parking Ticket? 

 

 What you read below may astonish you... 

Whatever the reason for your ticket, there is a good chance that you will be able to successfully challenge it (over 65% of appeals are successful)...One of the key reasons is that Local Authorities have to adhere to very strict guidelines when it comes to issuing tickets, however they often don&apos;t.

It could be anything from the position of road signs, how the lines are painted, the way tickets are worded, the time taken to issue the ticket, simple checks Parking Attendants must do at the beginning of each shift

 This list goes on and on..and on 

The bad news is that hundreds of invalid parking fines are issued every day because of these errors and the average motorist just pays up because they don&apos;t know how to spot them and appeal

On top of that we have found that the average Parking Attendant doesn&apos;t even know the rules and regulations when issuing tickets because most Local Authorities have outsourced parking enforcement to private companies with shareholders and fat cat bosses to please. Unfortunately they are only concerned with quantity of tickets - more tickets means more money to them..it&apos;s that simple

 The good news is that The Guide To No More Parking Tickets has addressed all of the issues you the ordinary motorist faces every day, and we&apos;ve now put the answers for you in this easy to read step by step manual.

We&apos;ve compiled answers to questions every motorist asks to but nobody can ever seem to have the answer to (apart form the council who will tell you to just pay up because you&apos;re in the wrong):

 I overstayed my Pay&amp;Display ticket by a couple of minutes..then got a ticket...what can i do?

 I thought you could stop on that yellow line for 5 minutes...can I?

 I got a ticket in the post but i don&apos;t recall a thing about the incident...what EXACTLY do i do now?

 I didn&apos;t see any signs, and parked, then got a ticket...what 3 things MUST i do first?

 I thought you could park there on a bank holiday...can I?

 I&apos;ve been told my ticket could be invalid...what are the 7 crucial points that will get it cancelled?

 The Parking Attendant said I could only load for 5 minutes..is this true? or not?

 I went to get change for the meter..then got a ticket..this isn&apos;t right..is it?

 My Pay&amp;Display ticket fell on the floor...then i got a Parking Ticket..this is wrong..isn&apos;t it?
