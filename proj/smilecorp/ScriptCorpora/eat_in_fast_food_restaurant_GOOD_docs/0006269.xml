Five Guys Burgers and Fries Coupons
 
Five Guys Burgers and Fries Coupons: Making Fast Food Delicious

It seems that as the years have continued and life has progressed something has happen to fast food – and not a good thing. It may be that many fast food chains use all frozen products, decreasing the quality of the meal. Who wants a thin, barely noticeable slice of “burger”? It’s doubtful that anyone goes into a fast food restaurant hoping the food is frozen and contains the smallest amount of meat possible. What about the fries? Don’t you think that there should be something better than pre packaged fries that (again) come frozen? Just because a restaurant is all about fast food, doesn’t mean that they should forget quality and taste. Now what about the toppings? At most fast food places, you’re limited to the toppings available to decorate your burger. The usual lettuce, tomato, pickle, and condiment can get way boring; especially when that’s all you’ve had your whole life. Five Guys Burgers and Fries recognized the poor quality and fewer options of fast food chains and decided to take a stand. Founded in 1985, this company of good change started offering the freshest meats and fries that actually start out as potatoes in each restaurant! The first time you try a Five Guys, you’ll be able to tell the difference within the first bite. A mouthful of deliciousness, the incredible flavor turns a seemingly ordinary burger into something unbelievable delectable. According to Washington Magazine, Five Guys was voted Best Bargain – providing a mouth-watering meal at a great price. But you can save and make your wallet happy, but using the Five Guys coupons and discounts located on this website.

Five Guys does not have freezers in any of their locations (only coolers) which means your burger and fries will always be fresh and never frozen. The fries at Five Guys are extraordinary and incomparable to any other fast food provider because they are made from real potatoes every day. It’s a delicious side item that can get any more real – full of flavor and originality. The Fire Guys menu is simple yet full of options at the same time. They offer four food items: Burgers, Dogs, Sandwiches, and Fries. Within the Burger category, you can get a hamburger, cheeseburger, or add bacon to either of the previous. Smaller forms of these are also offered and are listed as Little. Under Dogs and Sandwiches, a regular, cheese or bacon, bacon cheese, and veggie or grilled cheeses is available. Then Fries come in Five Guys Style and Cajun Style, regular or large. The regular is definitely enough for one person, and the large is more than enough for two. Five Guys is exceptional about their generous portions; so you know you’re getting the most for your money. Five Guys also offers a variety of toppings that come free with your order and they include: mayo, relish, onions, lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, ketchup, mustard, jalapeno peppers, green peppers, A-1 sauce, BBQ sauce, and hot sauce. So now there are tons of ways to create burger.

Interesting Facts! At Five Guys there are over 250,000 ways to order a burger. Only peanut oil is used for cooking, and there are zero artificial Trans Fats on the menu. In 2010, 200 restaurants are planned to open while online ordering is currently in the process and available in select locations. Five Guys plans to make online ordering available to all locations. Over 250 thousand burgers are sold daily, and a total of 38,409,200 pounds of potatoes were used by Five Guys in 2008. Next time you’re in the mood for a delectable burger, bursting with flavor, use the Five Guys coupons to get great savings on your next order!
