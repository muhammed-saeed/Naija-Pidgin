 This is the place where you can personalize your profile!
But, how? 
 By moving, adding and personalizing widgets. You can drag and drop to rearrange. You can edit widgets to customize them. The bottom has widgets you can add! Some widgets you can only access when you get a premium membership. Some widgets have options that are only available when you get a premium membership. 
 

 We&apos;ve split the page into zones! 
 Certain widgets can only be added to certain zones. &quot;Why,&quot; you ask? Because we want profile pages to have freedom of customization, but also to have some consistency. This way, when anyone visits a deviant, they know they can always find the art in the top left, and personal info in the top right. Don&apos;t forget, restraints can bring out the creativity in you!

&quot;You didn&apos;t miss anything, Iggy.&quot; Gazzy told him. &quot;It was really stupid and girly.&quot;

&quot;Well, I thought it was beautiful!&quot; Nudge said, pushing past the two boys to get into the warm house. &quot;All those dresses! I think I want to be a ballerina someday. I want to learn to dance like they did and be on stage and listen to such beautiful music. Wasn&apos;t the music wonderful? Oh, and I loved how the girl&apos;s hair was put up in that bun. I wa The Nutcracker Prince by ~ fang-not-fnick 5 Comments Browse Gallery

 I write fanfiction, I take pictures, I make stupid videos, I laugh, and I make others laugh.
I may be low on sanity, but I have a surplus of sarcasm that I&apos;m more than willing to share.
Sexily.
Remember the name of Saint, my friends, for one day, I will be famous. Famous for what, you ask? Well, it&apos;s a toss-up right now between brilliant author or raving lunatic, but either way, you can say you knew me before the fame.

 Reply ~ GleekMaxRide Jan 23, 2012   Hobbyist Traditional Artist want you to know that you are amazing&amp;you&apos;re my friend until my death. I f I don&apos;t get this back, I understand. But, I have a game for you, once you read this letter, you must send it to 15 people, including the person that sent it to you. If you receive at leaste 3 back, you are loved. Nobody knows how important something is until...................they lose it. Tonight, right at 12:00am, the person you like is going to realize that they love you! Then, something is going to happen to you between 1:00&amp;2:00am. Be ready for the greatest shock of your life. If you break this chain, you, you are going to have bad luck with love for a whole year. Send this to 15 people and see what happens
