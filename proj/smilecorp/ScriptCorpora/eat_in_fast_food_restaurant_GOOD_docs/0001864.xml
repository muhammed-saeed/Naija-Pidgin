Choose a diet that is low in saturated fat and cholesterol and moderate in total fat
 
 
 F ats supply energy and essential fatty acids, and 
they help absorb the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K, and carotenoids. You 
need some fat in the food you eat, but choose sensibly. Some kinds of fat, 
especially saturated fats, increase the risk for coronary heart disease by 
raising the blood cholesterol (see box 15 ). In contrast, unsaturated fats (found mainly in vegetable oils) do not increase blood cholesterol. Fat intake in the United States as a proportion of total calories is lower than it was many years ago, but most people still eat too much saturated fat. Eating lots of fat of any type can provide excess calories.

 Choose foods low in saturated fat and cholesterol 

See box 16 for 
tips on limiting the amount of saturated fat and cholesterol you get from 
your food. Taking these steps can go a long way in helping to keep your 
blood cholesterol level low.
 
 Box 15 
 KNOW THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF FATS 

 Saturated Fats 

Foods high in saturated fats tend to raise 
blood cholesterol. These foods include high-fat dairy 
products (like cheese, whole milk, cream, butter, and regular ice cream), 
fatty fresh and processed meats, the skin and fat of poultry, lard, palm 
oil, and coconut oil. Keep your intake of these foods low.

 Dietary Cholesterol 

Foods that are high in cholesterol also 
tend to raise blood cholesterol. These foods include liver and 
other organ meats, egg yolks, and dairy fats.

 Trans Fatty Acids 

Foods high in trans fatty acids tend to raise blood 
cholesterol. These foods include those high in partially 
hydrogenated vegetable oils, such as many hard margarines and shortenings. 
Foods with a high amount of these ingredients include some commercially 
fried foods and some bakery goods.

 Unsaturated Fats 

Unsaturated fats (oils) do not raise blood 
cholesterol. Unsaturated fats occur in vegetable oils, most nuts, 
olives, avocados, and fatty fish like salmon. Unsaturated oils include both monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats. Olive, canola, 
sunflower, and peanut oils are some of the oils high in monounsaturated 
fats. Vegetable oils such as soybean oil, corn oil, and cottonseed oil and many 
kinds of nuts are good sources of polyunsaturated fats. Some fish, such as 
salmon, tuna, and mackerel, contain omega-3 fatty acids that are being 
studied to determine if they offer protection against heart disease. Use 
moderate amounts of food high in unsaturated fats, taking care to avoid 
excess calories.
 

 

 Box 16 
 FOOD CHOICES LOW IN SATURATED FAT AND CHOLESTEROL AND MODERATE IN TOTAL FAT 

Get most of your calories from plant foods (grains, fruits, vegetables). If you eat foods high in saturated fat for a special occasion, return to foods that are low in saturated fat the next day.
 Fats and Oils 

 Choose vegetable oils 
rather than solid fats (meat and dairy fats, shortening).

 If you need fewer calories, decrease the amount of fat you use in cooking 
and at the table.

 Meat, Poultry, Fish, Shellfish, Eggs, Beans, and Nuts 
 Choose 2 to 3 servings of fish, shellfish, lean poultry, other lean meats, 
beans, or nuts daily. Trim fat from meat and take skin off poultry. Choose 
dry beans, peas, or lentils often.

 Limit your intake of high-fat processed meats such as bacon, sausages, 
salami, bologna, and other cold cuts. Try the lower fat varieties (check the 
Nutrition Facts Label).

 Limit your intake of liver and other organ meats. Use egg yolks and whole 
eggs in moderation. Use egg whites and egg substitutes freely when cooking 
since they contain no cholesterol and little or no fat.

 Dairy Products 

 Choose fat-free or low-fat milk, fat-free 
or low-fat yogurt, and low-fat cheese most often. Try switching from whole to fat-free or low-fat milk. This decreases the 
saturated fat and calories but keeps all other nutrients the same.

 Prepared Foods 

 Check the Nutrition Facts Label to see 
how much saturated fat and cholesterol are in a serving of 
prepared food. Choose foods lower in saturated fat and cholesterol.

 Foods at Restaurants or Other Eating Establishments 

 Choose fish or lean meats as suggested above. Limit ground meat and fatty 
processed meats, marbled steaks, and cheese.

 Limit your intake of 
foods with creamy sauces, and add little or no butter to your food.

 Choose fruits as desserts most often.
 

Following the tips in the box above will help you keep your intake of 
saturated fat at less than 10 percent of calories. They will also help you 
keep your cholesterol intake less than the Daily Value of 300 mg/day listed 
on the Nutrition Facts Label . If you want more flexibility, see box
17 , below, to find out your saturated fat limit in grams. The maximum number of 
saturated fat grams depends on the amount of calories you get daily. Use Nutrition Facts Labels to
find out how much saturated fat is in prepared foods. If you choose one food 
that is higher in saturated fat, make your other choices lower in 
saturated fat. This will help you stay under your saturated fat limit 
for the day. 


 Box 17 
 WHAT IS YOUR UPPER LIMIT ON FAT FOR THE CALORIES YOU CONSUME? 
 Total Calories per Day Saturated Fat in Grams Total Fat in Grams 1,600 18 or less 53 2,000* 20 or less 65 2,200 24 or less 73 2,500* 25 or less 80 2,800 31 or less 93 
 * Percent Daily Values on Nutrition Facts Labels are based on a 2,000 calorie 
diet. Values for 2,000 and 2,500 calories are rounded to the nearest 5 grams 
to be consistent with the Nutrition Facts Label. 
 

Different forms of the same food may be very 
different in their content of saturated fat. Box 18 provides some 
examples. Try to choose the forms of food that are lower in saturated 
fat most often.

 Keep total fat intake moderate 

Aim for a total fat intake of no 
more than 30 percent of calories, as recommended in previous editions of the
Guidelines. If you need to reduce your fat intake to achieve this level, 
do so primarily by cutting back on saturated and trans fats. Check box 17 to find out how many grams of fat you can have for the number of 
calories you need. For example, at 2,200 calories per day, your 
suggested upper limit on fat intake would be about 73 grams. If you are at a 
healthy weight and you eat little saturated fat, you&apos;ll have leeway to eat 
some plant foods that are high in unsaturated fats. To see if you need 
to lose weight, see the guideline&quot; Aim for a Healthy
Weight .&quot;

 Advice for children 

Advice in the previous sections applies 
to children who are 2 years of age or older. It does not apply to infants 
and toddlers below the age of 2 years. Beginning at age 2, children 
should get most of their calories from grain products; fruits; vegetables; 
low-fat dairy products; and beans, lean meat and poultry, fish, or nuts. Be 
careful, nuts may cause choking in 2 to 3 year olds.

 ADVICE FOR TODAY 

To reduce your intake of saturated fat and cholesterol:

 Limit use of 
solid fats, such as butter, hard margarines, lard, and partially 
hydrogenated shortenings. Use vegetable oils as a substitute.

 Choose fat-free or low-fat dairy products, cooked dry beans and peas, 
fish, and lean meats and poultry.

 Eat plenty of grain products, vegetables, and fruits daily.

 Use the Nutrition Facts Label to help choose foods lower in fat, 
saturated fat, and cholesterol.

Choose beverages and foods to moderate your intake of sugars
 
 

 S ugars are carbohydrates and a source of energy (calories). Dietary 
carbohydrates also include the complex carbohydrates starch and dietary fiber.
During digestion all carbohydrates except fiber break down into sugars. Sugars 
and starches occur naturally in many foods that also supply other nutrients. 
Examples of these foods include milk, fruits, some vegetables, breads, 
cereals, and grains.

 Sugars and tooth decay 

Foods containing sugars and starches can 
promote tooth decay. The amount of bacteria in your mouth and lack of 
exposure to fluorides also promote tooth decay. These bacteria use sugars 
and starches to produce the acid that causes tooth decay. The more often you 
eat foods that contain sugars and starches, and the longer these foods 
remain in your mouth before you brush your teeth, the greater your risk for 
tooth decay. Frequent eating or drinking sweet or starchy foods between 
meals is more likely to harm teeth than eating the same foods at meals and 
then brushing. Daily dental hygiene, including brushing with fluoride toothpaste and flossing, and adequate intake of fluorides will help 
prevent tooth decay. Follow the tips in box 1 9 for healthy teeth.
 
 
 Box
 19 
 FOR HEALTHY TEETH AND GUMS 

 Between meals, eat few foods or 
beverages containing sugars or starches. If you do eat them, brush your 
teeth afterward to reduce risk of tooth decay.

 Brush at least twice a day and floss daily. Use fluoride toothpaste.

 Ask your dentist or health care provider about the need for supplemental 
fluoride, or dental sealants, especially for children and if your drinking 
water is not fluoridated.
 
 
 Box 20 
 MAJOR SOURCES* OF ADDED SUGARS IN THE UNITED STATES 

 Soft drinks

 Cakes, cookies, pies

 Fruitades and drinks such as fruit punch and lemonade

 Dairy desserts such as ice cream

 Candy 
      * All kinds, except diet or sugar-free 
 

 Added sugars 

Added sugars are sugars and syrups added to foods in 
processing or preparation, not the naturally occurring sugars in foods 
like fruit or milk. The body cannot tell the difference between naturally 
occurring and added sugars because they are identical chemically. Foods 
containing added sugars provide calories, but may have few vitamins and 
minerals. In the United States, the number one source of added sugars is 
nondiet soft drinks (soda or pop). Sweets and candies, cakes and 
cookies, and fruit drinks and fruitades are also major sources of added 
sugars.

Intake of a lot of foods high in added sugars, like soft drinks, is of concern. Consuming excess calories from these foods may contribute to weight gain or lower consumption of more nutritious foods. Use box 20 to identify the most commonly eaten foods that are high in added sugars (unless they are labeled &quot;sugar free&quot; 
or &quot;diet&quot;). Limit your use of these beverages and foods. Drink water to 
quench your thirst, and offer it to children.

Some foods with added sugars, like chocolate milk, presweetened cereals, 
and sweetened canned fruits, also are high in vitamins and minerals. These 
foods may provide extra calories along with the nutrients and are fine 
if you need the extra calories.

The Nutrition Facts Label gives the content of sugars from all sources 
(naturally occurring sugars plus added sugars, if anysee figure 3 ). You 
can use the Nutrition Facts Label to compare the amount of total sugars 
among similar products. To find out if sugars have been added, you also 
need to look at the food label ingredient list. Use box 21 to identify names 
of some added sugars.


 
 Box 21 
 NAMES FOR ADDED SUGARS THAT APPEAR ON FOOD LABELS 

A food is likely 
to be high in sugars if one of these names appears first or second in the 
ingredient list, or if several names are listed.
 Brown sugar
Corn sweetener
Corn syrup
Dextrose
Fructose
Fruit juice 
concentrate
Glucose
High-fructose corn syrup
Honey Invert sugar
Lactose
Malt syrup
Maltose
Molasses
Raw sugar
Sucrose
Syrup
Table sugar 

 Sugar substitutes 

Sugar substitutes such as saccharin, aspartame, 
acesulfame potassium, and sucralose are extremely low in calories. Some 
people find them useful if they want a sweet taste without the calories. 
Some foods that contain sugar substitutes, however, still have calories. 
Unless you reduce the total calories you eat or increase your physical 
activity, using sugar substitutes will not cause you to lose weight.

 Sugars and other health issues 

 Behavior. Intake of sugars 
does not appear to affect children&apos;s behavior patterns or their ability to 
learn. Many scientific studies conclude that sugars do not cause 
hyperactivity in children.

 Weight control. Foods that are high in sugars but low in essential 
nutrients primarily contribute calories to the diet. When you take in extra 
calories and don&apos;t offset them by increasing your physical activity, you 
will gain weight. As you aim for a healthy weight and fitness, keep an 
eye on portion size for all foods and beverages, not only those high in 
sugars. See box 3 .

 ADVICE FOR TODAY 

 Choose sensibly to limit your intake of beverages and foods that are high 
in added sugars.

 Get most of your calories from grains (especially whole grains), fruits 
and vegetables, low-fat or non-fat dairy products, and lean meats or meat 
substitutes.

 Take care not to let soft drinks or other sweets crowd out other foods 
you need to maintain health, such as low-fat milk or other good sources of 
calcium.

 Follow the simple tips listed in box 19 to keep your teeth and gums 
healthy.

 Drink water often.

 

 
 
Choose and prepare foods with less salt
 
 

 M any people can reduce 
their chances of developing high blood pressure by consuming less salt. Several 
other steps can also help keep your blood pressure in the healthy range (see box
22 ). In the body, sodiumwhich you get mainly from saltplays an essential 
role in regulating fluids and blood pressure. Many studies in diverse 
populations have shown that a high sodium intake is associated with 
higher blood pressure.

There is no way to tell who might develop high blood pressure from eating 
too much salt. However, consuming less salt or sodium is not harmful and can 
be recommended for the healthy, normal person (see box 23 ).

At present, the firmest link between salt intake and health relates to 
blood pressure. High salt intake also increases the amount of calcium 
excreted in the urine. Eating less salt may decrease the loss of calcium from bone. Loss of too 
much calcium from bone increases the risk of osteoporosis and bone 
fractures.
 
 
 Box 22 
 STEPS THAT MAY HELP KEEP BLOOD PRESSURE IN A HEALTHY
 RANGE 

 Choose and prepare foods with less salt.

 Aim for a healthy weight: blood 
pressure increases with increases in body weight and decreases when excess weight is reduced.

 Increase physical activity: it 
helps lower blood pressure, reduce risk of other chronic diseases, 
and manage weight.

 Eat fruits and vegetables. They are naturally low in 
salt and calories. They are also rich in
potassium (see box 1 2 ), which may help decrease blood pressure.

 If you drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation. Excessive alcohol 
consumption has been associated with high blood pressure.
 
 
 Box 23 
 IS LOWERING SALT INTAKE SAFE? 

 Eating too little salt is not 
generally a concern for healthy people. If you are being treated for a chronic health problem, ask your doctor about whether it is safe for you to 
reduce your salt intake.

 Some table salt is fortified with iodine. If 
you use table salt to meet your need for iodine, a small amountabout 1/4 teaspoon of iodized saltprovides more than half the 
daily iodine allowance.

 Your body can adjust to prevent too much 
sodium loss when you exercise heavily or when it is very hot. However, if you plan to reduce your salt intake and you 
exercise vigorously, it is sensible to decrease gradually the amount of salt 
you consume.
 
 


 Salt is found mainly in processed and prepared foods 

Salt (sodium 
chloride) is the main source of sodium in foods (see box 24 ). Only small 
amounts of salt occur naturally in foods. Most of the salt you eat comes 
from foods that have salt added during food processing or during 
preparation in a restaurant or at home. Some recipes include table salt or a 
salty broth or sauce, and some cooking styles call for adding a very salty 
seasoning such as soy sauce. Not all foods with added salt taste salty. 
Some people add salt or a salty seasoning to their food at the table. Your 
preference for salt may decrease if you gradually add smaller amounts of 
salt or salty seasonings to your food over a period of time.

 Aim for a moderate sodium intake 

Most people 
consume too much salt, so moderate your salt intake. Healthy children and 
adults need to consume only small amounts of salt to meet their sodium 
needsless than 1/4 teaspoon of salt daily. The Nutrition Facts Label lists a Daily Value of 2,400 mg of sodium per day (see figure 3 ). This is 
the amount of sodium in about 1 teaspoon of salt. See box 25 for helpful hints on how 
to keep your sodium intake moderate.
 
 Box 24 
 SALT VERSUS SODIUM 

 Salt contains sodium. Sodium is a substance 
that affects blood pressure.

 The best way to cut back on sodium is to cut back on salt and salty foods 
and seasonings.

 When reading a Nutrition Facts Label, look for the sodium 
content (see figure 3 ). Foods that are low in sodium (less than 5% of the Daily Value or DV) are low in salt.
 

 
 Box 25 
 WAYS TO DECREASE YOUR SALT INTAKE
 
 At the Store 
 Choose fresh, plain frozen, or canned vegetables without added salt most
 oftenthey&apos;re
 low in salt.

 Choose fresh or frozen fish, shellfish, poultry, and meat most often. They are lower in salt than most 
 canned and processed forms.

 Read the Nutrition Facts Label (see figure 3 ) to compare the amount
 of sodium in processed foodssuch as frozen dinners, packaged mixes, cereals, cheese, breads, soups,
 salad dressings, and sauces. The amount in different types and brands often varies widely.

 Look for labels that say &quot;low-sodium.&quot; They contain 140 mg (about 5% of the Daily Value) or less of
 sodium per serving.

 Ask your grocer or supermarket to offer more low sodium foods. 
 Cooking and Eating at Home 
 If you salt foods in cooking or at the table, add small amounts. Learn to use spices and herbs,
 rather than salt, to enhance the flavor of food.

 Go easy on condiments such as soy sauce, ketchup, mustard, pickles, and olivesthey can add a
 lot of salt to your food.

 Leave the salt shaker in a cupboard. 
 Eating Out
 
 Choose plain foods like grilled or roasted entrees, baked potatoes, and salad with oil and
 vinegar. Batter-fried foods tend to be high in salt, as do combination dishes like stews or
 pasta with sauce.

 Ask to have no salt added when the food is prepared. 
 Any Time
 
 Choose fruits and vegetables often.

 Drink water freely. It is usually very low in sodium. Check the label on bottled water for
 sodium content. 
 

 ADVICE FOR TODAY 

 Choose sensibly to moderate your salt intake.

 Choose fruits and vegetables often. They contain very little
 salt unless it is added in processing.

 Read the Nutrition Facts Label to compare and help identify foods
 lower in sodiumespecially prepared foods.

 Use herbs, spices, and fruits to flavor food, and cut the amount of
 salty seasonings by half.

 If you eat restaurant foods or fast foods, choose those that are
 prepared with only moderated amounts of salt or salty flavorings.

 

 
 
If you drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation
 
 

 A lcoholic 
beverages supply calories but few nutrients. 
Alcoholic beverages are harmful 
when consumed in excess, and some people should not drink at all. Excess alcohol 
alters judgment and can lead to dependency and a great many other serious health 
problems. Taking more than one drink per day for women or two drinks per 
day for men (see box 26 ) can raise the risk for motor vehicle crashes, other 
injuries, high blood pressure, stroke, violence, suicide, and certain 
types of cancer. Even one drink per day can slightly raise the risk of 
breast cancer. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy increases risk of birth 
defects. Too much alcohol may cause social and psychological problems, 
cirrhosis of the liver, inflammation of the pancreas, and damage to the 
brain and heart. Heavy drinkers also are at risk of malnutrition because 
alcohol contains calories that may substitute for those in nutritious foods. 
If adults choose to drink alcoholic beverages, they should consume them 
only in moderation (see box 26 )and with meals to slow alcohol absorption.
 
 Box 26 
 WHAT IS DRINKING IN MODERATION? 

Moderation is defined as no more 
than one drink per day for women and no more than two drinks per day for 
men. This limit is based on differences between the sexes in both weight and 
metabolism.

 Count as a drink 
12 ounces of regular beer (150 calories)
5 ounces of wine (100 calories)
1.5 ounces of 80-proof distilled spirits (100 calories)

 
NOTE: Even moderate drinking provides extra calories. 

Drinking in moderation may lower risk for coronary heart disease, mainly 
among men over age 45 and women over age 55. However, there are other 
factors that reduce the risk of heart disease, including a healthy diet, 
physical activity, avoidance of smoking, and maintenance of a healthy 
weight.

Moderate consumption provides little, if any, health benefit for younger 
people. Risk of alcohol abuse increases when drinking starts at an early 
age. Some studies suggest that older people may become more sensitive to 
the effects of alcohol as they age.

 Who should not drink? 

Some people should not drink alcoholic beverages at all. These include:

 Children and adolescents. 

 Individuals of any age who cannot restrict 
their drinking to moderate levels. This is a special concern for 
recovering alcoholics, problem drinkers, and people whose family members 
have alcohol problems.

 Women who may become pregnant or who are pregnant. A safe level of 
alcohol intake has not been established for women at any time during 
pregnancy, including the first few weeks. Major birth defects, including 
fetal alcohol syndrome, can be caused by heavy drinking by the pregnant 
mother. Other fetal alcohol effects may occur at lower levels.

 Individuals who plan to drive, operate machinery, or take part in 
other activities that require attention, skill, or coordination. Most 
people retain some alcohol in the blood up to 2 to 3 hours after a 
single drink.

 Individuals taking prescription or over-the-counter medications that 
can interact with alcohol. Alcohol alters the effectiveness or toxicity 
of many medications, and some medications may increase blood alcohol 
levels. If you take medications, ask your health care provider for advice 
about alcohol intake, especially if you are an older adult.

 

 ADVICE FOR TODAY 

 If you choose to drink alcoholic beverages, do so 
sensibly, and in moderation.

 Limit intake to one drink per day for women or two per day for men, and 
take with meals to slow alcohol absorption.

 Avoid drinking before or when driving, or whenever it puts you or others 
at risk.
