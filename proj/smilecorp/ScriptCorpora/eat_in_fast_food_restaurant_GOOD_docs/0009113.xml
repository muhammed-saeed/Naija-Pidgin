NE. quadrant, Hwy. 610&amp;Zane Av. N., Brooklyn Park

 Type: Retail land Parcel Size: 58.7 acres

 Price: $14.6 million Owner: TCF National Bank

 Details: TCF Bank, the owner of the 58-acre property in Brooklyn Park that&apos;s has gone through a previous failed development effort, has submitted a new vision for the strategically located parcel.

The bank bought the farmland, now rechristened Six Ten Crossings, from a foreclosure auction last year. The parcel was first slated for development in 2001 by the Robert Muir Company as&quot;Park Village&quot;but those plans never came to fuitition. It has changed hands twice since.

Now the bank has a new idea for the land that includes&quot;neighborhood retail&quot;and&quot;regional retail&quot;components and is looking for a new developer to buy the parcel for a listed price of $14.6 million.

In plans submitted to the city by property manager Compendium Business Solutions of St. Louis Park, the big parcel has been roughly divided in half. The western half, bounded by Zane Av., contains the neighborhood retail section, in which a series of three multitenant buildings totaling 57,000 square feet, a free-standing drive-through restaurant, a bank and a gas station would be located.

Also in the western half is space for a sizable office or hotel building.

The eastern half of the site, which borders Oak Grove Parkway, has been laid out for three regional&quot;big box&quot;retailers, including a 180,000-square-foot building with a 918-car parking lot; a 134,000-square-foot structure with a 678-car lot; and a 50,000-square-footer with a 263-car lot.

Compendium Executive Vice President Bren Buckley indicated last month at the Brooklyn Park Planning Commission that&quot;many developers&quot;had been eyeing the site.

She also said Kwik Trip had signed a purchase agreement for the gas station parcel and that a&quot;major fast food&quot;restaurant chain has been in talks to take the drive-through spot.
