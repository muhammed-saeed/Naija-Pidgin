Fast Food Coupons Online 1
 
Everyone loves fast food.  Fast food provides a quick and easy solution to what to eat, but is becoming more expensive today.  This is especially true if you are feeding more than yourself.  One way to save some cash is to use coupons.  However, they can be difficult to find.  You just can’t go to your local paper and cut them out, fast food coupons online are the best way to find them.

Finding fast food coupons online is not always as easy as one might think.  You can enter the name of the fast food restaurant and do a search.  You will get lots of results, but the reputation of many sites may be a bit shady.  Some sites require you to fill out many surveys and then only give you a small coupon.  Some are only doing this to harvest your information which they sell to others resulting in a lot of spam e-mail.  Sometimes these sites may even infect your computer with spyware.  Many sites however will not do this.
 
One way to avoid scammers is to only go through reputable coupon sites when searching for fast food coupons online.  The problem is how do you find these reputable sites?  One way to find complaints is to run the website through a search engine.  It only takes a few seconds and you will see all the results for that site including the complaints.

The easiest and probably the best way to find fast food coupons online is to go directly to the restaurant’s website.  Once on their website you should be able to find any coupons the company is offering.  You can also sign up for their newsletter.  Once you’re on their subscribers list for their newsletter, many fast food restaurants will send coupons on a regular basis.

Be sure you read the coupon as there may be some restrictions.  You can find this information on the restaurant’s website.  For delivery places you may give them a code when you place your order.  Be sure to check the small print on each coupon to check the restrictions such as minimal purchases or expiration dates.  One bonus as far as pizza coupons, many pizza places will accept competitor’s coupons but you will have to check with each store.  You may also find this information at their website.
