 Panel tabs Benton fire officer 
 Ford as one of finalists for chief 
 Benton native and fire department veteran Bill Ford, who seems to be the popular choice among colleagues and residents alike, is a finalist for the position of fire chief -- less than eight months after former Mayor Rick Holland appeared indifferent to the district chief&apos;s desire to lead a department that has been the pawn-by-default in a series of local political chess matches for well over a year now.
 An ad hoc selection committee appointed by Mayor Dave Mattingly narrowed the pool of applicants from nine to two on Monday night. Alderman Bill Donnor, the panel&apos;s chairman, said the committee is recommending that Mattingly select either Ford or James Moore, a battalion chief at the White Hall Fire Department near Pine Bluff.
 Mattingly said following the meeting, the panel&apos;s second, that he hopes to name a full-time chief by the end of next week.
 &quot;I would like to be able to complete the background checks on the two finalists this week and conduct interviews with them next week,&quot;the mayor said.
 Donnor, who himself has a background in public safety, said he felt the committee was thorough in its review of the applicants. Donnor, who chairs the City Council&apos;s Personnel Committee, distributed applications to the selection committee
 members late last week and the panelists studied them over the weekend. He said Ford and Moore were consensus picks as the finalists.
 Meanwhile, the city&apos;s troubled Advertising and Promotion Commission put several decisions on hold Monday night with the fate of the autonomous panel the obvious focus of attention.
 Alderman Doug Stracener, one of two City Council representatives on the commission, said he believes the panel will present its request for an extension of the city&apos;s 1.5 percent&quot;hamburger tax&quot;to the council by late March or early April. The tax levied on the local hospitality industry is the commission&apos;s lifeline and is scheduled to sunset at the end of this year. It could be extended with approval from either the council, which assumed responsibility for creating the commission, or Benton voters.
 The commission wants to stage at least two town hall meetings before submitting its extension request, but dates for the meetings have not been confirmed. The panel desires a five-year tax extension so it can pursue a Saline County Fairgrounds&quot;improvement project&quot;featuring a Benton civic center facility as the centerpiece.
 One decision tabled Monday night is a $129,300 funding request from the Benton Parks Commission, which has faced some scrutiny of its own recently over various line-item expenditures in the 2011 budget for the equally autonomous panel.
 Alderman Brad Moore, who landed seats on both the A&amp;P and Parks commissions, is pushing the funding request to finance construction of a BMX (bicycle motocross) facility at Tyndall Park in the heart of the city. Moore has, over time, championed various funding efforts for improvements and additions to the city&apos;s softball facilities on behalf of the Parks Commission.
 The A&amp;P Commission did vote to extend Chairman Alan Jessup&apos;s tenure for 60 days while the issue of the panel&apos;s future plays out. Commission bylaws stipulate that a chairman may not serve more than two consecutive terms, but panelists opted to make an exception under the circumstances. Jessup, Saline County president for Bank of the Ozarks, is at the end of his second term. Commissioners cited the need for continuity when they elected Jessup to a second term. The panel was neck deep in the Central Arkansas Fairplex at Saline County project at the time and Jessup was obviously intimately acquainted with the effort, including stabs at securing some amount of government funding for the $55 million proposal.
 The meeting served as the curtain call for Jill Jones, who is resigning after spending just over three years as the A&amp;P Commission&apos;s only executive director. Her final day is Friday, and a decision on whether to address the pending vacancy is another matter that commissioners placed on the shelf.
 An appreciation reception will be held for Jones from 4 to 6 p.m. Thursday at the A&amp;P office at 205 E. South St. She&apos;s going to help direct sales efforts for a Little Rock radio group.
 Also on Monday night, the Bauxite City Council met in special session to adopt a resolution that permitted the city to apply for a $1.6 million sewer extension grant by the Tuesday deadline.
 Aldermen also addressed an issue concerning whether Brenda Hendrix or Gary Duncan should serve as Bauxite District Court clerk. Hendrix is the former city clerk-recorder. Duncan is the former mayor and current city clerk-recorder. Hendrix did not seek re-election because she intended to serve as the court clerk for Judge Curtis Rickard; however, Mayor Johnny McMahan said the issue is an extension of past political differences in the city and has effectively become another line in the sand.

 Parole not an option for Pierce until sex offender course done 
 Parole consideration for David Pierce, former longtime music minister at Benton First Baptist Church, has been deferred pending completion of a mandatory sex offender program known as RSVP.
 Pierce, 58, is serving a 10-year sentence in state prison for separate convictions of sexual indecency with a child. He was sentenced in Saline County Circuit Court in August 2009 after pleading guilty. Pierce is housed at the Arkansas Department of Correction&apos;s Ouachita River Unit at Malvern.
 Pierce appeared before the Arkansas Parole Board about two weeks ago, but the board&apos;s decision to defer apparently was a swift and simple one since Pierce has not met the requirements necessary for consideration.
 RSVP (Reduction of Sexual Victimization Program) is a treatment program for male sex offenders. It takes 90 days to complete the program&apos;s initial phase, but completion of the entire program can take from nine to 18 months, according to Department of Correction information.
 ADC officials authorized to discuss Pierce&apos;s progress in the program, or the lack thereof, were unavailable for comment Thursday afternoon.
 Rhonda Sharp, a spokesman for the Parole Board, said Pierce may again be considered for parole if and when he completes the RSVP program. Once an inmate reaches his parole eligibility date, she explained, the inmate may be considered for parole annually; however, the Parole Board is authorized to make exceptions to the one-year rule and grant so-called reconsideration hearings.
 If Pierce has to serve his entire sentence, and never achieves parole, his projected release date is Aug. 20, 2019, according to Sharp.
 Ken Casady, Saline County prosecuting attorney, said Thursday afternoon that the Parole Board&apos;s decision&quot;is a good result,&quot;but he said he understands that the Parole Board was effectively handcuffed because Pierce does not yet meet all of the requirements necessary for parole consideration.
 Sheriff Bruce Pennington also was understandably limited in his remarks about the Parole Board&apos;s decision, which, because of its stock nature, does not offer any insight into how board members may feel about paroling Pierce if and when he completes his requirements. Pennington did say, however, that persons convicted of crimes such as Pierce&apos;s should accept their punishment.
 &quot;If a person goes into court and accepts a plea agreement, that&apos;s the amount of time the person should serve,&quot;Pennington said.&quot;That is, given the nature of certain crimes. When someone accepts a plea agreement, the person knows up front what the punishment is going to be.&quot;
 Pierce was convicted of performing various sexual acts with boys participating in youth programs at First Baptist. The Louisiana native served as music minister for 29 years prior to being terminated. He was initially arrested in April 2009. He was re-arrested less than a month later by Pennington, one of several local and area officials who have been outspoken recently in opposition to Pierce&apos;s possible parole.
 Pierce is classified a Level 3 sex offender. Level 3 offenders are considered a high risk, meaning they are deemed more likely to commit repeat offenses. Level 4 is the highest classification and those offenders are considered sexually violent predators.
 He is married with three grown children and grandchildren.

 Sewer scramble: Bauxite fights 
 time to apply for $1.6M grant 
 There’s a good reason Bauxite officials are scrambling to get the ducks lined up: The city has a shot at parlaying a $30,000 investment into a $1.6 million wastewater extension grant if it can meet the application requirements by Tuesday’s deadline.
 Other than completing paperwork, the city must hold a public hearing before the City Council can vote on a proposed resolution authorizing the grant application. Mayor Johnny McMahan announced Wednesday night that the hearing will be held at 7 p.m. Monday at City Hall. The meeting will be preceded by a town hall meeting at 6, and McMahan said he’s hopeful that the council can address the proposed resolution by 7:15.
 “This is kind of a whirlwind deal,”the new mayor acknowledged Thursday morning,“but this grant application is something that could’ve easily fallen through the cracks if it had not come to our attention. Apparently the previous administration let this thing gather dust, but this is too important for the city to miss this opportunity.”
 The application would be submitted to Central Arkansas Planning and Development District Inc., the Lonoke-based agency serving six Central Arkansas counties. Former Benton Mayor Rodney Larsen is executive director of the agency.
 This would be an Arkansas Community Economic Development Program grant administered through the Arkansas Natural Resources Commission. The grant process would include a favorable recommendation from the commission and final approval from the governor’s office.
 “We would hope to have an answer on whether the grant is approved by no later than July 1, and possibly sooner,”Libby Fort, community services director with Central Arkansas Planning, said.
 The grant would fund the extension of sewer service to land that was annexed into the city along Sardis Road. The extension would service about 170 new customers, including the Saline County Landfill, according to Fort. Bauxite currently has 263 wastewater customers.
 A survey showed that 69 percent of the prospective new customers are deemed to have low to moderate incomes, a factor that Fort said would“strengthen”Bauxite’s grant application. According to Central Arkansas Planning, these grants are designed to benefit low to moderate income families, to“aid in the prevention of slum or blight”and to help cities avoid situations that could potentially pose health concerns for a community.
 “This is a very competitive grant program,”Fort said.“The commission will look at a lot of things, and the more customers and low-income customers a city has is a determining factor with these grants.”
 Another potential selling point for Bauxite, if the grant application is submitted on time, is the pledge of a $150,000 private donation that would dramatically reduce the city’s financial obligation. The donation is why the city would have to pay only $30,000 if the grant is approved, and Fort said that obligation could be met through a 20-year loan from Central Arkansas Planning.
 The donor would be Republic Services Inc., the Arizona-based solid waste collection company that is purchasing the county landfill. Republic would benefit from the wastewater extension by linking to the Bauxite system and building a pumping station at the landfill, which is off Sardis Road, County Judge Lanny Fite explained. Republic and the county hope to close the landfill deal around mid-February, Fite said.
 Under the purchase agreement, Republic will relieve the county of its landfill indebtedness, which is more than $6 million, and will pay the county $3 million over a period of years. The annual payments, which Fite said could be as much as $750,000, will enable the county to establish and maintain a recycling program.
 “This would be a win-win for Republic and the city of Bauxite,”Fite said.“Republic would benefit greatly from the wastewater extension, with the landfill, and Republic’s payment would greatly reduce the amount Bauxite would have to pay toward its matching portion of the grant.”
 McMahan said he quickly realized the potential benefits of the grant.
 “We cannot afford not to pursue this,”he said.“We’re doing everything possible to make sure we get this grant application completed on time on our end. We cannot afford to let this opportunity slip through our fingers. That small an obligation for our city versus that size grant? It doesn‘t take long to warm up to that opportunity.”
 That is especially true since the city already is burdened with a wastewater loan that has Bauxite customers paying some of the highest rates in the state. As of last fall, Bauxite residential customers were paying an average of $70 per month for water and wastewater, according to former Mayor Gary Duncan. The city built a wastewater treatment facility in 2001 but ended up having to finance the $2.2 million cost over 29 and a half years when grant applications were denied.
 Duncan tried on several occasions to coax the city of Benton into taking responsibility for Bauxite’s water and wastewater woes, but the Public Utilities Commission wasn’t buying.
 Arkansas Community Economic Development Program grants are not affiliated with any federal stimulus projects or programs through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Fort said.
 JANUARY 23 
 A&amp;P vacancy: Now or later fair query, but not most important 
 Now what?
 “Not sure,”Alan Jessup says.“We’ll have to determine our next steps.”
 A good answer -- OK, the only answer, really -- to a fair question that had to be asked, even with the knowledge that the latest dilemma facing the Benton Advertising and Promotion Commission is part of a much larger question: Will there even be a commission?
 Whether the panel decides to pursue Jill Jones’successor now or later probably could be determined with a coin flip and no one would fault the commissioners. They&apos;re waiting to find out if the moat surrounding the imperiled panel is stocked with smallmouth bass or piranha.
 Jones, the commission’s only executive director, is resigning -- a decision that Jessup, the panel’s long-serving chairman, said was unexpected.
 The timing was unexpected, true. But all things considered -- the position being the nature of the beast, as it were -- should the resignation itself come as a surprise to anyone faintly familiar with the role?
 Jones earned a reputation as a tireless worker, a devoted city partner and a skilled promoter -- even on rare occasions when extra-glossy paint and industrial-strength wax couldn’t improve the sheen. The ultimate example had to be the night of the Midsummer Massacre:“If it had been a normal election year,”Jones chirped,“we would’ve had enough votes.”
 Of course, hardly anything was normal about election-heavy 2010, and Jones and other Central Arkansas Fairplex at Saline County proponents could only watch -- partly in horror, surely -- as the county’s most ambitious sales tax proposal was reduced to ashes. Commission life has not been the same since 74 percent of county voters riddled the fairplex idea with bullet holes in the Aug. 10 special election.
 Jones will not deny that the fairplex saga extracted an emotional toll -- she gave two-plus years of her life to the project, so it’s silly for a promoter to attempt to spin that fact -- but that is not, she insisted, why she negotiated a position as a media sales manager with a Little Rock radio group.
 “I made this decision because it is the right decision for me and my family,”Jones told insidesaline.com.“I know people will draw a parallel with the fairplex project, but we put that behind us and made plans to move forward. That is not why I am leaving. Absolutely not.”
 As she said during a commission meeting in late 2010, referencing the fairplex project:&quot;We went for the gold ring and didn&apos;t get it. We can accept that and move on.&quot;
 Problem is, of course, some city officials and taxpayers have not been as adept at putting the lengthy and costly fairplex project in the rearview mirror. That’s why the ominous cloud hangs over the commission, the fate of which will be determined in the near future by either the City Council or Benton voters.
 The commission wants aldermen to approve a five-year extension of the 1.5 percent“hamburger tax,&quot;which funds the panel, so the commission can pursue a Saline County Fairgrounds improvement project that would include an overdue civic center facility for Benton. The tax, which is levied on Benton hospitality industry businesses, is scheduled to sunset at the end of this year. A few aldermen oppose a second life for the tax, a few others insist that the decision should rest with voters -- and a remaining few, well, who knows?
 This is, needless to say, a dicey proposition -- at a time, no less, when the city’s entire commission structure is becoming a point of contention. There&apos;s a song that says there’s a thin line between Saturday night and Sunday morning. Gee, how thin then is the line separating autonomy and oversight for commissions like A&amp;P, Parks and Public Utilities? It is a similar fundamental question facing the Legislature, you may have noticed, since our newly anointed state Sen. Jeremy Hutchinson, R-Little Rock, introduced proposed legislation that would give the General Assembly some degree of say-so about the operation of state commissions.
 Voters weren’t barking at shadows last year when they said a new breed of taxpayers is crawling behind the wheel -- a vigilant breed, beginning at the local government level. Do we need a show of hands from folks who may have mistakenly believed that the election-year words we heard most often -- accountability and responsibility -- had a hollow tone?
 Jones, 45, has spent slightly more than three years directing the A&amp;P Commission. She will resign effective Friday, Feb. 4 -- and effectively join the ranks of the vigilant, most of whom also intend to keep an eye on the city’s march to the immediate future because they actually care. The cradle may rock, but the vigilant bunch appears intent on making certain that the bow beneath it remains sturdy.
 “I’m excited about continuing to be involved with the city as a private citizen and volunteer,”Jones said.“I love Benton and Saline County. I am not walking away. I want to continue to try and help make a difference.”
 Jones will have a leg up in her new role; the A&amp;P Commission was not immune to the political fumes that seep into Benton’s pores. She has received rather thorough on-the-job political training during her tenure with A&amp;P Commission -- even if it isn&apos;t part of the job description. And while it is hardly an easy course of study -- witness the strategic missteps with the fairplex project -- Jones and other commissioners would be quick to acknowledge, one must suppose, that trial-and-error is indeed an acceptable, if not simply unavoidable, part of the political education process in Benton and Saline County.
 The strong may not always win, but they will survive. Local political battle lines are never drawn in indelible ink. It just seems that way at times.
 “Jill has given tirelessly of her time, experience, knowledge, passion and heart to the (A&amp;P Commission) and the city of Benton,”Jessup, Saline County president of Bank of the Ozarks, said in announcing Jones’pending resignation via e-mail late last week.
 “She has worked after hours, weekends and holidays on project after project that she has been charged with and each time has provided a positive result and impact on our community. Her spirit and genuine care for our city is something we all sincerely appreciate. I personally wish Jill the best in her new venture and appreciate all that she has done for the (commission) and our community.”
 Alderman Doug Stracener, one of two council representatives on the commission, said he favors placing the executive director decision on the shelf until the panel&apos;s fate is determined. Alderman Brad Moore, the other representative, said Jones&apos; resignation&quot;is too new to thoroughly process&quot;the panel&apos;s next step. He said, however, that he believes the commission&quot;is more effective with a qualified and energetic director at the helm.&quot;
 Here’s more of what Jones told insidesaline.com following the announcement of her pending resignation:
 “The commission is comprised primarily of business owners, with two aldermen, and they are thorough in their decision making and are looking closely at the intent, spirit and best opportunities for the future. I believe that the A&amp;P has operated in both the letter and spirit of the ordinance which created it.
 “I believe that we have been a positive for the city and its quality of life. Parks projects, arts projects, events, festivals, renovations and other entertainment has been brought to the city by the efforts of the A&amp;P. The continued growth of revenue is testimony to the continuing traffic being brought to our city’s hotels and restaurants. There are many other things that could be done, and I am certain that the A&amp;P will thoroughly research those options before moving forward.”
 In other words, now what?
 A question that, with all respect to Jones, is clearly significant for reasons other than just her forthcoming departure.
 JANUARY 24 
 Benton&apos;s budget reflects stalled 
 economy, but it could be worse 
 There’s room for everybody inside and there‘s a balanced, streamlined engine under the hood. Problem is, the transmission is stuck in neutral.
 Benton’s 2011 model general fund budget is a $10.8 million package that reflects the condition of the local economy -- stalled, because any increase in commercial growth has not been sufficient to offset the inevitable decrease in residential development.
 But, there is a glass-half-full side to this story: A status quo budget is not an altogether bad deal considering that the overall state of the economy has cities in Arkansas and elsewhere facing a plight far worse than Benton’s. City officials were not forced to make any drastic cuts in personnel or services to balance the 2011 budget, which Mayor Dave Mattingly termed“lean and mean”because it is about $100,00 lighter than last year’s $10.9 million package.
 City revenues and expenditures are projected to increase and decrease, respectively, by 2 percent this year, and the budget has a projected surplus of $82,000.
 “There is no such thing as an ideal budget scenario in this economic climate,”Alderman Jerry Ponder, Finance Committee chairman, said after aldermen voted 9-1 to adopt the new budget at Monday night‘s City Council meeting. Alderman Steve Lee was absent and any absence is recorded as a“No”vote.
 “When you look around at what some other cities are having to do with their budgets, the city of Benton is fortunate. Our situation could be significantly worse.”
 Ponder said he was generally impressed by the budget proposals submitted by city department heads, who were asked to trim considerably more fat from their proposals a year ago than they were this go-around.
 “I think our department heads understand that we want to be as fair as possible with each department in the budget process,”the budget’s chief architect said.“They realize that we just are not in a position to consider all of their wants, and even some needs.”
 Final figures for fiscal 2010 should be known by mid-February, and Ponder said December revenues could leave the city with a surplus of up to $300,000. Half of any year-end surplus is required to deposited into a“lockbox”reserve fund, then aldermen can determine a use for the remaining funds.
 The general fund budget is a three-part package that includes funding for general needs, the street department and animal control. The city’s autonomous Public Utilities, Parks and Advertising and Promotion commissions operate on separate budgets that are adopted by the respective commissions.
 HR, ACCOUNTING BACK IN ADMINISTRATION
 Employees of the city’s human resources and accounting departments will now report exclusively to the mayor instead of Terry McKinney, Benton Utilities general manager.
 Aldermen voted 8-2 to transfer the departments, which were placed under the Public Utilities Commission’s umbrella a number of years ago at the recommendation of former Mayor Rick Holland.
 Mattingly indicated during last fall’s mayoral campaign that he would pursue the departments’transfer if elected. He said, in essence, that the arrangement was dysfunctional and confusing.
 The PUC budgeted $522,000 annually to fund the two departments. Funding will now be divided equally between the PUC and the city’s general fund.
 Alderman Doug Stracener, the council’s senior member, was the only alderman present who voted against the transfer. He essentially said the PUC arrangement was not broken, and therefore did not need to be fixed, and that the transfer would place a burden on the general fund budget.
 Mattingly said he surveyed a number of first-class cities in the state and found no similar arrangement. The mayor also said he was told by Arkansas Municipal League officials that they know of no city that has forfeited administrative supervision of the HR or accounting departments.
 Karen Scott, the city’s chief financial officer, directs the accounting department. She drew praise from Stracener, who said he believes Scott is the premier municipal financial officer in the state.
 The HR department is supervised by Kathy Kirk, personnel manager.

 Public&apos;s pick? More like public 
 input in choosing new fire chief 
 The public will select Benton&apos;s new fire chief?
 Interesting concept. Truth is, however, the perception one media outlet attached to a selection process that will include input from residents is misleading. Mayor Dave Mattingly has made it clear that the forthcoming recommendation from a resident-heavy selection committee will hold considerable influence when it&apos;s time to choose the city&apos;s second full-time chief in less than a year -- but the decision ultimately is his.
 Alderman Bill Donnor will chair the five-member committee, which was announced this week by Mattingly. Donnor is chairman of the City Council&apos;s Personnel Committee, an ally of public safety personnel and one of two city officials on the selection panel. The other is Police Chief Kirk Lane. Committee members from the business community are Lib Carlisle, Jim Villines and Wade Partridge. Mattingly has asked the panel to narrow the field of applicants from nine to two.
 Mattingly and Donnor developed a professional bond when Mattingly served as chairman of the Citizens Public Safety Committee, a seven-member group that spent the better part of two years studying Benton&apos;s public safety needs. The committee reluctantly recommended a sales tax initiative to fund the needs, but the measure was defeated by voters in late 2009.
 The committee will meet at 6 p.m. Thursday in the mayor&apos;s conference room at Benton Municipal Complex. The meeting will be open for public comment both before and after the panel gathers in executive session.
 Frankly, longtime Benton firefighter Bill Ford, a district chief, has to be considered the fan favorite among nine fire chief applicants. Ford is a repeat applicant who was given only passing consideration in 2010 by former Mayor Rick Holland, who named Christopher Campbell of Tennessee as the new fire chief to succeed Ben Blankenship, who retired as chief at the close of 2009 in a swirl of controversy. Blankenship persuaded the Civil Service Commission to promote Capt. Mark Mills to assistant chief. The panel did not know at the time that Blankenship and Holland had signed off on Mills&apos; promotion to that position in 2007.
 Mills is serving his second stint as interim fire chief. He held the position before Campbell was hired in late July 2010. Mills also has a lawsuit pending against Aldermen Joe Lee Richards, a retired local law enforcement officer, and Steve Lee, a retired Benton firefighter. Mills claims that the two badgered him during the months-long Civil Service Commission controversy. Richards was typically outspoken a few times, but Lee has said on numerous occasion that he was dogged throughout the process because he was elected to protect the taxpayers&apos; interests.
 Campbell never really felt that he fit in Benton, and he decided to return home to the Memphis region after Holland was defeated last fall in his bid for a third four-year term.
 Ford, a Benton native and School Board member, openly expressed his frustration about the fire chief selection process after Holland hired Campbell.
 &quot;I probably would&apos;ve been more shocked if I had gotten&quot;the position, Ford told insidesaline.com.&quot;I never really expected it to happen. There&apos;s not much history here for hiring from within.&quot;
 The former assistant fire chief, who has been with the department more than 30 years, was one of four finalists. But, Ford learned that Holland had chosen Campbell the same way everybody else did -- via e-mail.
 &quot;I wasn&apos;t officially notified that I wasn&apos;t chosen,&quot;said Ford, who best described his no-nonsense demeanor when he said this:&quot;I’ve never tried to be politically correct about a lot things, just honest.”Ford also openly acknowledged following Campbell&apos;s hiring that&quot;there are a lot of problems&quot;in the fire department and that morale was low, particularly in the wake of the Mills controversy.
 Ford was approached about becoming fire chief in 2000 by former Mayor Lynn Moore. Ford said he appreciated being considered but that he was&quot;just too worn out&quot;at the time to entertain the thought. Ford’s father, also Bill, died in 1999 and Ford had spent considerable time as a family caretaker during his father&apos;s illness.
 Ford&apos;s father was a former Saline County justice of the peace. His mother, Betty, retired after more than 30 years with the county collector’s office.
 Ford is the only local applicant for fire chief. Here are the others:
 John Burns Jr., a Marion firefighter; Randy Ates, a Eureka Springs firefighter; Theodore Martin, a lieutenant at Watseka, Ill.; Dale Parrish, fire chief at Skiatook, Okla.; James Moore, battalion chief at White Hall near Pine Bluff; Roland Williams, chemical officer at Rogers; Turner Luttrell Jr., deputy chief at Terry, Miss.; and Conrad Harlan, assistant security director at Thibodeaux, La.
 FEBRUARY 17 
 Journey&apos;s end: Timeline leading 
 to hiring of Ford as fire chief 
 Things do have a way of working out sometimes, don&apos;t they?
 Following is a timeline of events related to the hiring Wednesday of Bill Ford as Benton fire chief:
 2000: Bill Ford, a Benton native and widely respected fire department veteran, is approached about becoming the city’s new fire chief. Ford tells Mayor Lynn Moore that he appreciates the offer but that the timing is wrong. Ford says he’s worn out and that it would not be right for him to begin such an important journey on an empty tank. Ford had devoted much of his time to caring for his father, Bill Sr., before the elder Ford succumbed to illness the year before in 1999. The mayor certainly is understanding and says he will look elsewhere to meet the city‘s public safety need.
 Fall 2009: Dave Mattingly the resident is in a position to recommend a public safety need, albeit begrudgingly following two years of study and then untold hours of soul-searching because his concern for his community was in a boxing match with his fiscally conservative nature. He is chairman of the Citizens Public Safety Committee, which decides that the most feasible way for Benton to best meet future public safety needs is to enact a sales tax. The best Mattingly can do to help ensure success is hit the local speaking circuit and better inform residents of the need for the tax. Benton voters said they did not want a sales tax.
 December 2009-Spring 2010: Public safety returns to the main stage near year‘s end, this time in the form of an often loathsome controversy that would end up sizzling for months. The issue is ignited by an abstruse fire department promotion that would strain personal relations, spawn litigation and unfairly leave fire personnel feeling like their department had been handed a dunce cap and told to sit in the corner. The controversy finally loses some of its glamour, but not even the little Dutch boy who saved Holland the country can plug prevent the fire department from leaking morale. Former Chief Ben Blankenship is retired, effective New Year’s Eve; Mayor Rick Holland is taking his sweet time finding a new chief; and Assistant Chief Mark Mills, whose promotion from captain triggered the controversy, is serving as interim chief.
 July-September 2010: Holland is finally ready to fill the six-month vacancy and name a new fire chief. Local applicant Ford, a respected department veteran and community favorite for the position, learns via e-mail, like everybody else, that Holland is hiring Christopher Campbell, a fire professional from the greater Memphis, Tenn., area. Holland’s decision leaves the community looking like its filled with bobble-head dolls; people everywhere are shaking their heads. Ford acknowledges publicly that he never felt like he was more than an afterthought with Holland, whose last big move in the twilight of his second term leaves the fire department in need of a morale transfusion. Campbell seems like a nice guy; he doesn’t seem like a fit, especially after another controversy surfaces when it is learned that Campbell will have to attend training school to become properly certified in Arkansas. The morale transfusion isn’t working too well; the fire department may be moved into intensive care.
 November-December 2010: Mattingly the resident becomes the city’s mayor-elect. Holland gathers a majority of the votes in the November general election, while Mattingly has to survive a photo finish with repeat mayoral candidate Don White in order to gain a runoff berth. Holland tries to appear guardedly optimistic heading toward his third runoff election, but in reality he looks fatigued and concerned, and the only thing preventing him from sweating profusely may be industrial strength antiperspirant. Mattingly’s camp, meantime, is genuinely optimistic, feeling their muscular platform combined with voter sentiment will overpower Holland, who is espousing familiar and hollow campaign rhetoric and is suffering from eight years of political wounds. Mattingly doesn’t just overpower Holland, he lands a knockout blow. The mayor-elect takes a sizeable lead in early voting, leaves a vapor trail at all eight precincts and ends up with 67.5 percent of the votes. Two weeks later, it’s déjàvu all over again: Campbell says he’s returning to Tennessee, Benton is again without a fire chief and Holland tells Mills to try and hold the fort again. Fire department morale becomes critically low and visitation is limited in the intensive care unit.
 Feb. 16, 2011: Mattingly the mayor is in a position to meet a public safety need. He doesn’t flinch, announcing shortly after 8 a.m. that Ford is the city’s new fire chief effective immediately. Fire department personnel start swarming a big, fresh serving of morale like it’s an all-you-can-eat buffet. And, if anyone in town disagrees with the development, it will take a rescue team to find him.

 Benton alderman, one other charged in road rage incident 
 Benton Alderman Brad Moore is one of two men charged with harassment following an alleged road rage incident Tuesday.
 The alleged disturbance began around 6 p.m. on Alcoa Road near the Alcoa Exchange shopping center and ended on Aaronfield Road, according to Benton police.
 Trevor Weith, 31, also is charged with no proof of insurance and second-degree criminal mischief.
 No injuries were reported.
 Police Chief Kirk Lane said the investigation will be forwarded to the office of Saline County Prosecuting Attorney Ken Casady since the alleged incident involved a Benton city official.
 Lt. Kevin Russell, Benton police public information officer, said authorities are withholding additional details about the alleged disturbance because of the ongoing investigation.
 Moore, 47, said he has retained legal counsel and is not at liberty to comment on the alleged incident.&quot;I will rely on our justice system to sort through the information,&quot;he told insidesaline.com.
 Moore represents Ward 4 on the City Council. He considered a 2010 mayoral bid before deciding that&quot;the timing is just not right.&quot;His father, Lynn Moore, served one term as mayor from 1999-2002.
 Brad Moore joined the council in 2005 after defeating A.C. Paxton in the November 2004 general election. Moore was unopposed in his first re-election bid and defeated former Alderman Warren Burleson in 2008 to win a third term. Moore also ran unopposed in 2010.
 Moore is a City Council representative on the city&apos;s Advertising
 and Promotion and Parks commissions. The Benton High School and Ouachita Baptist University graduate is an administrative employee at Cheyenne Industries Inc. in Little Rock.
 Moore and his wife, Lexi, have four children. Three attend Benton public schools and their daughter, Molly, is a freshman at the University of Central Arkansas at Conway, where she is on the Dean&apos;s List. The family attends Benton First Baptist Church.

 Shannon Hills gets new police chief; Kemp cites city progress 
 Bobby Hale, former head of security at the Alexander Youth Services Center, is the new Shannon Hills police chief. He succeeds Terry Mullinax, who resigned in November and is now the Pangburn police chief.
 Hale, 46, is a former Judsonia police chief and former chief of detectives in White County.
 “I am excited about this opportunity,&quot;Hale said.&quot;Shannon Hills is a rapidly growing community facing many challenges. I&apos;m humbled and honored by the confidence placed in me by the mayor and City Council.&quot;
 &quot;We&apos;re fortunate to have someone of Bobby&apos;s caliber serving our city,&quot;Shannon Hills Mayor Mike Kemp said.
 Hale also is a former director of information technology with the Mansfield School District.
 He was introduced at this week&apos;s council meeting, during which aldermen approved an interlocal agreement with the city of Alexander and Saline County for district court services. Shannon Hills and Alexander will share a court clerk, with the cities splitting the expenses and the county administering the plan.
 In his State of the City address, Kemp cited several accomplishments in the first month-plus of his term, all of which he said will not require additional city funding: Laying the groundwork for an online bill pay system for water and sewer customers; enrolling the city in the county&apos;s 911 addressing system to ensure that physical addresses are properly assigned for first responders; updating the city&apos;s Web site; and establishing e-mail addresses for city officials so they can better communicate with residents.
 Kemp also announced a plan to reimburse each of the city’s wastewater customers up to $50 in lieu of reduced rates, which he said are prohibited because of the city&apos;s bond funding obligations.
 “The city has built a substantial reserve in the wastewater fund,&quot;he said.&quot;If revenue continues at current levels, then by December of this year we should be able to provide a rebate for each customer. It is time for residents to see some real return on their investment.”
 Kemp survived a five-person mayoral field, a runoff and a vote recount to become the city&apos;s third mayor in less than two years. Former Mayor James Smith was among the candidates ousted in the general election. He defeated city Treasurer Saundra Vosburg in a special mayoral election in fall 2009 after former Mayor Larance Davis resigned from office as part of a plea agreement. Vosburg also was a mayoral candidate last fall.
 Kemp received 44 percent of the votes in the November general election and Dave Holsomback, a chiropractor and city alderman, joined Kemp in a runoff with 19 percent of the votes. Kemp, an assignment editor at Fox 16 television, won the runoff by six votes. Holsomback called for a vote recount and gained one vote.
 The City Council meets at 6:30 p.m. the second Tuesday of each month at City Hall.

 Two-thirds of Saline&apos;s growth 
 rate from Benton, Bryant boom 
 Saline is the sixth most populated of Arkansas’75 counties and its county seat, Benton, is the state’s 12th-largest city, according to fresh figures from the U.S. Census.
 The county now has 107,118 residents and Benton’s population has swelled to 30,681, according to the new numbers. Both figures are slightly higher than some pre-census estimates, although County Judge Lanny Fite said he saw an estimate of 108,000 for the county.
 Saline County’s population has grown 28.2 percent (23,589 residents) since 2000, making it among the five fastest-growing counties in the state during the past decade. Only Benton County in the northwest corner of Arkansas has grown at a more robust rate (44.3 percent) the past 10 years than any other county. Saline has grown at a rate similar to fellow Central Arkansas counties Faulkner (31.6 percent) and Lonoke (29.4 percent) and Washington County (28.8 percent) in Northwest Arkansas.
 Benton has experienced unprecedented growth since 2000, when it had 21,906 residents. That’s a 40.06 percent increase for Saline County’s largest city.
 Bryant, however, is effectively a boom town, according to the census numbers. The once sleepy city has seen its population explode in 10 years, from 9,764 in 2000 to 16,688 currently. A quick study of the numbers indicates that Bryant’s growth rate of 70.91 percent may be exceeded only by Bentonville’s rate of 78.92 percent.
 Benton and Bryant, two of Saline County’s seven municipalities, have together grown by 15,699 residents since 2000. The two cities account for 66.6 percent of the county’s population growth in the last decade.
 New census figures are not readily available for cities with populations lower than 5,000.
 As expected, growth outside the Central Arkansas region was far less dramatic. Jefferson County, in fact, experienced an 8.1 percent decrease in population. But growth around Saline County was not significant: Grant (8.4 percent), Hot Spring (8.5 percent) and Garland (9 percent) counties all paled in comparison.
 “When get into areas where it is not feasible to commute to Little Rock for work, growth does drop noticeably,”Fite said.“That is why we should think about progressing as a region since we growing as a region in Central Arkansas.”
 Fite said he is“slightly surprised”by Benton’s growth but not by Bryant’s.
 Benton Mayor Dave Mattingly said Benton’s growth is consistent with estimates he saw as far back as a year and a half ago.
 “It’s clear that our challenge now is commercial growth,”Mattingly said.“We know people will continue to move to Benton for lot reasons, like our schools and a lower crime rate and other quality of life things. Our challenge is to keep businesses wanting to come here. That is why we’re concentrating our efforts on a unified focus on economic development.
 “Rooftops are wonderful, but we cannot be expected to thrive off them.”

 A&amp;P names interim director, 
 sets town hall meeting dates 
 Stephanie Dillavou is now interim executive director of the Benton Advertising and Promotion Commission, and the panel has scheduled two town hall meetings to state its case for a tax extension necessary to breathe new life into the troubled commission.
 Commissioners took care of some unfinished business on Thursday despite the inclement weather.
 Dillavou served as administrative assistant. She will receive a 10 percent pay increase to serve as interim director. Jill Jones, the commission’s only full-time director, resigned recently after slightly more than three years in that position.
 Commissioners are not actively pursuing a new full-time director because the panel’s fate is undetermined. The 1.5 percent“hamburger tax”that funds the autonomous commission is scheduled to expire at year’s end. The commission proposed a plan to request a five-year extension of the tax, which is levied on the city’s hospitality industry businesses; however, a formal request will not be presented to the City Council until sometime in March, a commissioner has said, and it is unclear now whether the request will include a sunset clause.
 It will be up to the council to either vote to extend the tax or place the decision before voters in a special election. By all accounts, aldermen currently are evenly divided on the issue.
 The commission will hold town hall meetings at 7 p.m. Monday, Feb. 21 and March 7, at City Hall to outline the panel’s request. The commission initially said the extension would fund an improvement project at the Saline County Fairgrounds in Benton and that the project would feature a Benton community center as the centerpiece. There has been some debate among commissioners about whether to remove the fairgrounds designation from the final proposal because of lingering ill feelings toward the failed Central Arkansas Fairplex at Saline County proposal. That planned $55 million project was beaten up by county voters during a special sales tax election last summer.
 Commissioners will meet at 6 p.m. Feb. 21 to finalize the funding request, which reportedly will stipulate that 85 percent of revenue generated from a tax extension be dedicated to a capital improvement project such as a community center. The remaining 15 percent, or approximately $120,000 annually, would be used for administrative costs and promotions, one commissioner said.
 The commission revisited a $129,300 funding request from the Benton Parks Commission to help fund a BMX (bicycle motocross) facility at Tyndall Park, but no decision was made. This reportedly is a tender subject for several reasons: The request is from an equally autonomous city commission that operates under its own budget; the Parks Commission has faced some scrutiny of its own recently over various line-item expenditures in its 2011 budget; and there are unanswered questions about the operation and maintenance costs associated with a BMX facility.

 Benton council releases money for more high-tech upgrades 
 Benton’s long and winding journey toward high-tech bliss continued Monday night when the City Council appropriated up to $21,550 for computer network upgrades at five buildings.
 Aldermen wasted no time in unanimously approving a pair of ordinances authorizing the purchase and installation of network switches and fiber optic cable. Switches will be placed in City Hall, Woodall Central Fire Station and Stations 1 and 2 at a cost not to exceed $12,900. Up to $8,650 is available for cable and switches at Salt Creek Fire Station.
 Expenses will be paid from the communications system fund established in 1997.
 “This is all part of the city’s effort to help complete the computer network loop and, ultimately, make it possible for residents anywhere in town to acquire high-speed Internet service,”Alderman Jerry Ponder, chairman of the Finance Committee, said.
 Aldermen have been kept abreast for some time of the city’s technological needs, and worked through funding details in committee meetings, so no discussion was necessary prior to voting on the ordinances.
 “Everybody’s pretty up to date on where we need to go with technology,”Ponder said.“Plus, these ordinances help the city fulfill a promise that was made months ago when the Benton School District approved purchases for other computer network materials.”
 Another housekeeping chore included council authorization of a resolution permitting the city to enter into a federal funding agreement for upgrades to the flood warning gauge station on the Saline River. The agreement is with the Interior Department and the city’s obligation is $1,000.
 COUNCIL OKs APPOINTMENTS
 Dr. Don Brashears was appointed the city’s representative on the Saline County Regional Solid Waste Management Board. He succeeds Wanda Henthorne, who resigned the position last year and was rumored for a while as a possible council Ward 4 candidate.
 Restaurant owner Mark Fikes was reappointed to the Advertising and Promotion Commission. His new term expires Oct. 1, 2014 -- provided the commission is given a second life. The council will decide, probably in March, whether to extend the 1.5 percent“hamburger”tax that funds the panel or let voters make the decision in a special election. Fikes, owner of Kentucky Fried Chicken and Rib Crib, is considered a popular choice to become commission chairman if the panel survives.
 MAYOR ISSUES PROCLAMATIONS
 Mayor Dave Mattingly proclaimed this week (Feb. 11-18) as Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevent Week; Feb. 20-27 as Benton Athletic Memorial Museum Wall of Fame Week; and Feb. 21-27 as Junior Achievement Week.

 County landfill back to private ownership; Republic to run it 
 Saline County’s landfill is scheduled to become the property of Republic Disposal Inc. at the close of the business day on Tuesday.
 Final paperwork was completed around lunchtime. Republic is paying more than $7.3 million for the facility, which the county has operated the since purchasing the landfill from a private company in 1992.
 The landfill is off West Sardis Road at Bauxite. Its sale, which has generated some controversy, was approved by the Saline County Solid Waste Management District board in November 2010.
 The pending sale spawned a lawsuit filed by the landfill workers union; however, County Judge Lanny Fite re-emphasized late Monday that the county is protected from any possible financial damage from the suit through terms outlined in the sales agreement with Republic.
 One county official who asked not to be identified said a Bauxite police officer will be stationed at the landfill office when the facility changes hands late Tuesday afternoon.
 “It’s just a precautionary measure,”the official said.“No one expects anyproblems.”
 Republic officials reportedly will offer revised employment packages to landfill employees late Tuesday.
 Fite said he believes the sale serves a financial life raft for the county and is beneficial for Bauxite. Republic has agreed to spend about $1.5 million to repave a mile stretch of road leading to the landfill. The already tattered roadway will see increased traffic from heavy trucks when Republic solicits additional landfill business.
 “The county’s initial investment in the landfill was $5.26 million,”Fite said.“If we kept it and paid off the bonds, the total would be around $6.5 million. Then, we would be responsible for another $2 million to do recycling that the state is now mandating, and we would need another $1.5 million or so to make improvements and meet new environmental standards at the landfill.
 “It was just becoming way too costly for the county to continue to operate. We would’ve had to increase the fees for every waste hauler in the county by at least 30 percent and we sure didn’t want to do that.”
 The sale will permit the county to institute the state-mandated recycling program at no cost to local taxpayers, Fite said.
 Under the sales agreement, Republic will pay the county an annual fee of $450,000 the first two years and then base the yearly fees on revenues.
 Republic, headquartered in Arizona, already owns the Little Rock landfill, which is scheduled to close in 2013.
 Bauxite Mayor Johnny McMahan said he looks forward to Republic becoming a healthy community partner. In addition to paying for the roadwork, the company pledged $100,000 to help the city acquire a wastewater extension grant. It will be several months before Bauxite will know if it will receive the grant.
 Fite said the county encountered a financial hurdle with its landfill bond obligation in 1999. The county did not have enough reserve funding to meet the bond payment and considered levying a fee of about $18 on every property owner in the county. Then-Union Bank of Benton, which financed the bonds, worked out a financial agreement with the county, Fite said.
 FEBRUARY 17 
 Ford named Benton fire chief; morale, image top priorities 
 He’s a hometown guy, he’s devoted nearly 32 years to his profession, he’s synonymous with humility and a list of other admirable traits and he’s Benton’s new fire chief.
 Most of all, though, for the immediate future, Bill Ford is the consumers’choice as the salve that many people believe will help heal a significant amount of soreness.
 Ford knows it, too. That’s why the former district chief was opening the ointment jar about the same time Mayor Dave Mattingly was spreading word of Ford’s hire first thing Wednesday morning.
 “The first thing we need to work on is pulling everybody together,”Ford said.“We (fire department) have kind of been raked over the coals, taken some raps.
 “I think image is everything so I want us to start work right now on building a good image. I like transparency, too. Let’s just be up front about things. Everything works a lot easier that way.”
 The fire department also has suffered through a significant decline in morale while being slapped around for almost a year and half now. Ford, 50, is the second chief hired since former Chief Ben Blankenship, another Benton native, retired on the final day of 2009.
 Ford could have been named chief last summer. He was a community favorite for the job, and certainly had the backing of his peers. Ford is respected and admired throughout the fire department, according to numerous people both within and close to the department. But former Mayor Rick Holland gave token consideration to Ford’s application and hired Christopher Campbell, a veteran fire officer from the greater Memphis, Tenn., area. Campbell, who arrived without some state-required certifications, rolled up his fire hose and headed back across the Mississippi River about two weeks after Holland was unseated by Mattingly in the November runoff election. 
 Per his candid nature, Ford did not mince too many words in describing his feelings about being passed over by Holland. Ford knew then that the fire department had a series of problems that needed to be addressed, and his frustration over the whole selection process was compounded when Holland did not have the courtesy to notify Ford that he would not be the new chief. That didn’t surprise Ford, who said he never felt he was being given serious consideration by Holland, but Ford did not appreciate learning about Holland’s decision via e-mail along with everybody else in town.
 That’s all history now, of course, and Ford said he’s delighted to be the new chief. Well, he said that in so many words. He expressed himself with a little more flavor, saying he viewed his selection as chief“kind of like the last and best chapter of the book.”
 That’s Ford, all right. But perhaps the following comment is vintage Ford because it combines several of his signature character traits, including humility, common sense and a basic ability to understand:“I really don’t feel I am the best qualified man for the job, because I think he’s still out there somewhere,”he said.“But I do feel like I am the right man for the job right now.”
 If you have a lot of spare time, try and find someone who disagrees. There’s been no shortage of pro-Ford chatter in Benton since Mattingly’s announcement.
 “In the final analysis, I felt Mr. Ford’s knowledge of our personnel, equipment, community and issues was a determining factor in my selection,”the mayor said.
 “There’s no question in my mind that 30 years of dedicated service, as Mr. Ford worked his way up through the ranks with unwavering loyalty to our fire department and community, have earned him this opportunity to become our new fire chief.”
 Ford, the only local applicant, was chosen from a field of nine hopefuls. He and Battalion Chief James“Scott”Moore of the Pine Bluff Fire Department were chosen as finalists for the Benton position by a five-member selection committee appointed by Mattingly. The panel, chaired by Alderman Bill Donnor, met twice before recommending to the mayor that he select either Ford or Moore.
 Donnor, a former public safety officer, chairs the City Council’s Personnel Committee. He and Mattingly got to know each other well when Mattingly chaired the Citizens Public Safety Committee, a seven-member panel of community members who studied the city’s future public safety needs. The committee was the idea of Donnor and Alderman Steve Lee, a retired Benton firefighter and chairman of the council’s Health and Safety Committee.
 Other members of the selection committee appointed by Mattingly were Police Chief Kirk Lane and business community representatives Lib Carlisle, Jim Villines and Wade Partridge.
 “After reviewing their resumes and holding one-on-one interviews with both men, it was obvious to me they were both highly qualified professionals capable of leading a fire department,”Mattingly said of Ford and Moore.“During the interview process, the two applicants answered some difficult questions and convinced me of their capabilities of being effective leaders.”
 There’s not much Ford hasn’t done in more than three decades as a professional firefighter. He even served as assistant chief from 1995-2000. He then asked to be returned to the rank of district chief because he was exhausted after caring for his dying father, Bill Sr., in 1999. Before the rank reduction, Ford declined an offer from Mayor Lynn Moore to become fire chief.
 “I’m going to have to work on my transition from operations with this new job,”Ford said Wednesday,“but I’ll work that out. It’ll take a little getting used to but I’ll get there.”
 Ford said he is not currently focused on any significant financial issues that may be facing the fire department. He said he understands that the city has had to tighten its money belt. Besides, he said,“Tight budgets don’t bother me because I’m used to living on one at home. I can handle a tight budget. It‘s the loose ones that scare me.”
 The fire department employs 54 people, including office personnel, according to Ford. His salary and benefits package as chief includes a base salary of just over $65,000 per year, Ford said.
 Ford is resigning his position on the Benton School Board effective Friday. Paul Childress, board president, said Ford submitted his letter of resignation on Wednesday.
 He is not required by law to leave the School Board, but Ford said he feels it is in the interest of all parties now that he is fire chief.
 “I don’t want to put myself or anyone else in a position where someone is forced to make a decision that may be unethical, for whatever reason,”Ford said.“I don’t know that would happen, but I don’t know it wouldn’t since the city and fire department and school district work together on things.”
 Childress has called a special board meeting for 5 p.m. Monday at the Professional Development Center on River Street. He said the board will vote to accept Ford’s resignation and then will determine the process the board wants to use in filling Ford’s position.
 The board will appoint Ford’s replacement. Childress said he would like to have the position filled in March if possible. He said the board will determine Monday whether to accept or solicit applications, how many applicants may be interview by the board and other selection procedures.
 Ford’s replacement will serve until the Saline County school board election in September. Whoever is elected to Ford’s position at that time will complete Ford’s five-year term, which expires in September 2012. Ford’s appointed replacement would be eligible to seek election to the position.
 Ford and his wife, Judy, have a son, Andrew, 12, who is a sixth-grader at Benton Middle School.
 Ford&apos;s father was a former Saline County justice of the peace. His mother, Betty, retired after more than 30 years with the county collector’s office.
 Applicants for the chief position in addition to Ford and Moore were John Burns Jr., a Marion firefighter; Randy Ates, a Eureka Springs firefighter; Theodore Martin, a fire lieutenant at Watseka, Ill.; Dale Parrish, fire chief at Skiatook, Okla.; Roland Williams, chemical officer at Rogers; Turner Luttrell Jr., deputy chief at Terry, Miss.; and Conrad Harlan, assistant security director at Thibodeaux, La.

 IRS puts hold on city of Bauxite cash until issue solved on forms 
 The Internal Revenue Service on Friday placed a $13,635.28 levy on the city of Bauxite’s checking account with Malvern National Bank, leaving the cash-challenged community in danger of going“upside down”financially if an issue apparently involving a tax form is not resolved quickly, Mayor Johnny McMahan said late in the day.
 Supposedly, the IRS has put a hold on the money because the city has not submitted Form 941 for 2007. That form provides the IRS with a detailed payroll report on Social Security withholdings, according to Recorder-Treasurer Gary Duncan, who was Bauxite’s mayor from 2007-10.
 Both Duncan and former Recorder-Treasurer Brenda Hendrix told insidesaline.com that the city made a $13,635.28 payment.
 “I wrote the check; I can assure you it’s been paid,”Hendrix said.
 “The money has been remitted,”Duncan said.“They (IRS) just didn’t get the form.”
 A“simple misunderstanding”may have prevented the city from filing the Form 941 in question, Duncan said.
 “The city went to an electronic method for filing taxes sometime back,”he said.“I think maybe Mrs. Hendrix just assumed that the proper form would be sent electronically along with our payment. Those forms have to be submitted manually and maybe Mrs. Hendrix didn’t realize that.”
 McMahan said it’s difficult for him to speak to the issue yet because he did not even know there was problem until a Malvern National Bank official telephoned him Friday afternoon to inform him of the IRS levy.
 “I’m pretty much in the dark about everything right now,”McMahan said.“I spoke with Gary Duncan but that’s all I know at this point, what Gary explained to me. I hope to get a lot of questions answered Tuesday when I can speak with the IRS.”
 Government offices are closed Monday in observance of Presidents’Day.
 “I know we need to get this straightened out right away,”McMahan said.“This money takes a big bite out of our budget. We have to keep the city working, obviously, and we sure don‘t need to deal with a lot of checks bouncing all over the place.”
 The IRS levy leaves the city with a general fund bank balance of $4,812.74, according to Duncan, and the city has $10,612 worth of checks outstanding.
 “I guess if there’s any light side to any of this, it’s the note Gary left on my payroll check,”McMahan, who is paid $865 per month, said.“I came down to City Hall as soon as I could after hearing about all of this and Gary had a note on my check that said,‘You might want to hold onto this for a little while.’”
 Duncan said he doesn‘t believe the IRS issue“will end up being a big deal.”
 “I really think the government is confused,”he said.“I think everything will be OK once we send in this form the IRS says it needs.”
 Duncan said he thinks the IRS may be confusing Form 941 with Form 940, which he said concerns federal unemployment taxes. Cities are not required to file a Form 940, according to Duncan, but the city did file that form for several years.
 “If you’re asking why the city filed the form, I don’t know,”Duncan said.“Maybe someone in the city didn’t know that we didn’t have to.”
 Duncan said he spoke with an IRS employee on Dec. 30 of last year, one day before his term as mayor ended, and that he was told that the IRS would be reimbursing the city $13,635.28 for the Form 940 payments.
 “I told the lady I talked to at the IRS that I didn’t think cities had to pay 940 taxes,”Duncan said.“She looked it up and said I was right and that if we would get our money back if we would send in a Form 940X, which tells the IRS what we‘re trying to correct.
 “Well, I sent in that form and now the IRS is saying we owe this amount of money for the 941 payments. That’s why I think the government is confused.”
 McMahan said he thought he understood Duncan to say that the IRS sent the city a series of registered letters concerning a Form 941 for 2007, but Duncan and Hendrix told insidesaline.com that they don’t remember any registered letters.
 “I don’t know what letters anyone is talking about, and I told Gary the same thing,”Hendrix said.
 “The IRS told me they sent the city some registered letters, that’s all I know,”Duncan said.“I asked the person I talked to at the IRS who signed for the letters and they weren’t able to tell me that.”
 Hendrix said she and Duncan were going to meet at City Hall sometime before Tuesday and prepare a Form 941 for 2007. McMahan said Duncan did not tell him about any such meeting.
 “I guess Gary just forgot to mention that,”McMahan said.
 It’s no secret that relations have become strained between Hendrix and McMahan. Bauxite District Court proceedings have been interrupted because McMahan does not believe it is in the city’s best interest for Hendrix to serve as the district court clerk, a position she held when she was recorder-treasurer.
 District Judge Curtis Rickard has said that he wanted Hendrix to remain as clerk. McMahan has alleged that Rickard interrupted court proceedings essentially in protest, saying,“Judge Rickard knows that if he doesn’t hold court, it hurts Bauxite financially because we have such a small, tight budget to work with anyway.”
 Asked Friday about his allegedly strained relationship with Hendrix, McMahan said,“I didn’t have anything against Mrs. Hendrix, I just didn’t like the way some of her work was looking when I got to checking on things after I took office. All anyone has to do is look at the city’s legislative audits from about 2007 on and it doesn’t speak well for Mrs. Hendrix’s bookkeeping methods. In fact, it’s pretty embarrassing.”
 McMahan added,“It’s just been a series of surprises since I took office, and I had some people tell me it would be. It’s kind of like looking through an old attic; you don’t know what you’re going to find. But, I said when I campaigned for mayor that I was going to ask a lot of questions. I think everybody wants to move Bauxite forward and we will when we get all of these surprises from the past taken care of.”
 The IRS levy can extend up to 21 days, according to IRS and Malvern National Bank documents. The money could be forfeited to the IRS after that time if the issue has not resolved to the IRS’satisfaction.

 Benton A&amp;P pledges to work for center; begins pitching its plan 
 Benton Advertising and Promotion Commission pledges to devote at least 80 percent of its annual tax collections toward construction and operation of a community center facility if either the City Council or voters will agree not to dam up the revenue stream.
 Commissioners voted to make a community center project a priority during a special meeting Monday night, then went across the street to City Hall for a town hall gathering to begin pitching their plan, which, in fairness, has no real depth yet.
 All commissioners know at this point is that they need a minimum five-year extension of the 1.5 percent“hamburger”tax to realize their“dream”of a 30,000-square-foot facility that they believe can be built for between $4.4 million and $5.5 million. No other details are available for the proposed facility, including a location, an architectural rendering or a list of possible amenities.
 The sovereign commission, which began levying the tax on local hospitality industry businesses in April 2006, will not survive without a tax extension. Funding will cease at year’s end unless the City Council extends the tax it enacted or chooses to let voters make the decision in a special election. It was believed that the commission would formally place its tax extension request before the council around mid-March; however, the timeline is cloudy now because representatives of both the city and the public said they won’t make a decision until they receive a more detailed proposal.
 If the tax is extended, commissioners said construction of a community center facility could begin within 60 months, or about 10 years after the council created the commission for the purpose of delivering a community center facility to a city that now has more than 30,000 residents. The commission’s original community center plan became sidetracked when it was permitted to morph into the Central Arkansas Fairplex at Saline County project, a $55 million proposal based around the potential impact of the equine industry. Seventy-four percent of county voters rejected the idea during a special penny sales tax election last August.
 The commission, which has collected close to $3.5 million in taxpayer dollars since its creation, has been under intense public scrutiny since the fairplex election. One of its selling points now is a $1.3 million bankroll that could jump start a community center project.
 Under the current proposal, 75 percent of yearly revenues ($680,000) would be dedicated to construction of a community center facility; 5 percent ($42,500) would be used to operate and maintain the facility; and 15 percent ($127,500) would cover the commission’s administrative costs and fund promotional efforts.
 Alderman Doug Stracener, a commission representative, said the projected annual revenue is based on the panel’s current budget, which reflects $850,000 in tax collections. Projected revenue also is based on zero growth, he said, although income has increased an average of 8 percent annually over the past three years.
 So, using this funding formula, the commission could have $4.7 million available for a community center project by 2015.
 Not surprisingly, comments during the town hall meeting suggested that a community center project alone is not the only challenge facing the commission. A debate over the fundamental principles of the democratic process also is lurking, with a majority of commissioners clearly favoring a council vote instead of a special election.
 Alderman Brad Moore, who moderated the town hall meeting, tied on several occasions to counter remarks about the taxpayers’right to decide a tax issue.“Do you realize how many taxes you pay now that you didn’t vote on?”Moore, a commission representative, said, referring to such taxes as utility surcharges.
 Ed Hairston, chairman of the county Tea Party, said those taxes are the result of“fee happy government,”and Charles Mazander, a Tea Party affiliate, said“people have the final say in a democracy”and that an A&amp;P tax is not a necessity tax.
 The commission talked of making the community center the centerpiece of a fairgrounds improvement project, but the panel is abandoning that idea because of negative sentiment lingering from the fairplex project. The city owns a 20-acre tract -- the old Watts Field airport -- next to the fairgrounds off Interstate 30 in southwest Benton.
 There has been discussion of seeking an alternative community center site that affords better visibility along I-30. But, Stracener said he feels the commission would need a minimum of five acres at a cost of between $4 and $6 per square foot.
 Word has surfaced lately of a proposal that would make the community center the first of a three-phase project to benefit the city. Reportedly, the idea involves designing a community center facility that could later be expanded to include a home for the Boys&amp;Girls Club of Saline County and the Benton Senior Activity Center. There is widespread belief that the Benton School District eventually will pursue the Boys&amp;Girls Club property on Cox Street, near district facilities. The senior center on Jefferson Street has been renovated, thanks in part to a donation of nearly $50,000 from the A&amp;P Commission, but several city officials have said that the older facility will continue to need costly improvements.

 They&apos;re saying it: Reactions to hiring of Ford as new fire chief 
 Alderman Steve Lee , a retired Benton firefighter and chairman of the City Council’s Health and Safety Committee:“There’s no doubt this is an excellent choice. I hold Bill Ford in high regard. He is a very honest, truthful and intelligent person. I think we’ll see some good changes in the fire department and I think he will make Benton proud. There’s no doubt that morale will be lifted with Bill’s hiring. I don’t know a man down there at the fire department who doesn’t respect Bill. He will restore dignity and pride to that department, and he brings a lot of integrity to the table.”
 Alderman Bill Donnor , a former public safety official, chairman of the City Council’s Personnel Committee, and chairman of the five-person selection subcommittee assembled by Mayor Dave Mattingly and charged with trimming the list of fire chief applicants from nine to two:“I don’t think there’s any doubt that Bill will do great job and be well received by firefighters the residents of Benton. Bill has the respect of his peers not only here, but across the state. We were very determined as a committee that we were going to set aside any personal feelings when we reviewed the chief applicants, and we felt we presented Mayor Mattingly with the best two candidates for the job. We feel very good about the job the mayor asked us to do, and now that the selection process is over, I can say as a resident and an alderman that I think the mayor made an excellent decision that will go a long way toward healing some wounds in our city.”
 Paul Childress , a partner at Thomas Real Estate&amp;Insurance Co. Inc., a former Benton police officer, and president of the Benton School Board:“I think this is a great move by Mayor Mattingly. I have worked with Bill since 1987 in some capacity. We first worked together with the ambulance service, then I worked with him when I was a policeman and now we have served together on the School Board. Bill is a matter-of-fact person with a love for Benton and a common-sense approach to life in general. He has nothing but respect among his peers and in the community. This is a tremendous hire for the community and for the fire department. If there’s a better person for the job of fire chief in Benton, I have no idea who it would be or where he is.”
 Tony Prothro , Benton School District superintendent:“I think everybody realized that Bill was the popular choice for fire chief. Bill is a person with a lot of common sense and a conservative approach. I have very much enjoyed my relationship with Bill over the last four-plus years, and I have no doubt he will serve Benton well.”
 Police Chief Kirk Lane: &quot;I’m excited about Bill&apos;s appointment. I’m looking forward to working with him. We have some projects in the works that need his attention. He will be an asset to the fire department and the community. Bill is a good fit for the city as a whole.”

 Field halved; Benton board gets 
 closer to choosing new member 
 Peggy Butler, Brent Davis and Dr. Michael Pafford are the finalists to fill a Benton School Board vacancy created by the resignation recently of Bill Ford, the city’s new fire chief.
 The three candidates will be interviewed by the board during a special meeting at 5:30 p.m. Monday at the Ringgold Elementary School cafeteria. Paul Childress, board president, said he’s hopeful that the board can select Ford’s successor that night.
 Six people applied for the board position. The board cut the field in half during a special meeting Wednesday night.
 “All of the applicants were good,”Childress said.“It was very difficult to narrow the list to three.”
 He thought the vacancy might attract more applicants, Childress said, but added:“People know that serving on a school board is a difficult job and requires time. It’s not a decision that anyone makes without a lot of thought and consideration, I don’t think.”
 Ford was named fire chief on Feb. 16 and officially vacated his School Board position two days later. He was not required by law to leave the board, but Ford said he felt it was in the best interests of both the city and school district.
 “I don’t want to put myself or anyone else in a position where someone is forced to make a decision that may be unethical, for whatever reason,”he said.
 Ford’s successor will complete his five-year term, which expires in September 2012. The new board member will be eligible to seek election to a new five-year term during the Saline County school board election, which is the same month.
 Butler and Davis are Benton natives and Pafford specializes in internal medicine at Saline Memorial Hospital. Butler is a former teacher and librarian with the Benton School District and Davis is staff development trainer at Arkansas Children&apos;s Hospital in Benton.
 Butler was a leading opponent of the school district’s plan last year to spend more than $10 million in bond money to build a new football stadium and fieldhouse. Davis was among a group of district patrons who also weighed in on the issue but did not necessarily oppose the plan.
 George&quot;Bucky&quot;Ellis, Jim Gardner and Jonathan Woolbright also applied for the board position. Ellis is a Benton attorney and has been involved in numerous community activities over the years. Gardner is pastor at Northside Church of Christ in Benton and Woolbright is owner and general manager of Woodlast Products of Benton.

 New Benton board member, Butler, 
 is schooled in the public ed system 
 One thing Benton’s newest School Board member does not lack, obviously, is an intimate familiarity with the local public education system.
 Peggy Butler spent almost 30 years as a teacher and librarian with the school district before retiring in 1994. John, her husband of more than 51 years, was principal at Benton High School for 27 years. And, their two daughters are BHS graduates.
 It’s certainly understandable why her predecessor, Bill Ford, is among those who believe that Butler brings“valuable knowledge and insight”to her role on the board.
 Butler, 71, was selected to complete Ford’s term after board members interviewed her and two other finalists, Brent Davis and Dr. Michael Pafford, on Monday night. Ford’s term expires in September 2012, at which time Butler would be eligible to seek election to another five-year term.
 The board voted 4-2 in favor of Butler. She received support from President Paul Childress, Vice President Joe Felan and Wade Goodwin and Paul Viner, both of whom were elected to the board in September 2010. Brad Bohanan and Jeff Morrow cast“no”votes.
 “I want to thank the board for placing their trust in me,”Butler told insidesaline.com.“I will work hard to make everyone see that that trust was not misplaced. My goal is to
 make our good schools better and to be fiscally responsible in handling the patrons&apos; tax money. I hope to use my 32 years&apos; experience in the classroom to benefit all the students here in the Benton School District.”
 Childress said he is“excited”that Butler’s experience as an educator will provide the board with an additional perspective on various matters.
 “Really, any of the three finalists would’ve been a great mix on the board ,”he said.“It was not an easy decision, but I feel like we made an excellent choice.”
 Superintendent Tony Prothro said Butler“will have a real advantage with insight“while on the board.
 Ford resigned his board position on Feb. 18, two days after becoming Benton’s fire chief.
 “I wasn’t endorsing anybody,”Ford said.“I didn’t have a favorite. I knew the board would make what it felt was the right decision and I’m sure the board will not waste any time now in moving forward.”
 “Education has always been the guiding force in my life,”said Butler, who worked at Benton High, two junior high schools and Howard Perrin Elementary School.“It has allowed me to see myself and the world like I would not have under different circumstances.”
 Butler said when applying for the board vacancy that her“sincere and vibrant interest in our town’s schools”will not subside.
 “Having had the good fortune to experience public education from two sides -- as a teacher and a student -- I want to continue to contribute,”she said.“I think my unique perspective on education can be a positive addition to the board.”
 Last year, Butler was practically relentless in voicing opposition to the school district’s plan to devote more than $10 million in low-interest bond money to construction of a new football stadium and field house, a proposal championed by Bohannan and Morrow. She continually stressed the need to funnel any funding into the education arena.
 However, Butler made it a point when applying for the board vacancy of letting district officials know that she recognizes the line that separates advocacy and a spirit of cooperation.
 “…I fully appreciate the difference in being an advocate for a particular point of view and working with the board as a member,”she wrote.“…I will work with each member to help meet the goals of the school district and the needs of every child.”
 Butler spent three terms as a Saline County justice of the peace from 1977-82. She currently serves on the county Equalization Board and is a member of the Finance Committee at Benton First United Methodist Church.
 She holds an undergraduate degree from Arkansas State Teachers College (now the University of Central Arkansas) at Conway. She continued her studies at a variety of institutions, including University of Arkansas campuses at Fayetteville and Little Rock, University of Tours in France, California State University-Northridge and the University of California-Los Angeles.
 Butler taught at Camarillo (Calif.) High School from 1961-66 before returning to Arkansas and joining the Benton School District.
 One of the Butlers’daughters, Laura, lives in Benton and is a bill clerk in the Arkansas House of Representatives. Laura Butler’s son, Bishop, 9, is the Butlers’only grandchild. He is a third-grader at Caldwell Elementary School.
 The Butlers’daughter Rachel Butler Gavini, a former corporate attorney, lives in the Connecticut countryside with her husband, Bryan. He also left the corporate world and they now own and operate a wine bar called Pangaea in Putnam, Conn.
 Peggy Butler is the daughter of the late J.B. and Freda Ballard. Mr. Ballard was a well-known building contractor in the county for most of his working life. Peggy Butler’s brother, Gary Ballard, is administrator of the county’s Geographic Information Systems department and his wife, Joy, was elected county collector last fall. Peggy Butler’s sister, Jimmie Sue Sheppard, lives in Fort Worth, Texas.
 Also applying for the board position were George&quot;Bucky&quot;Ellis, a Benton attorney; Jim Gardner, pastor at Northside Church of Christ in Benton; and Jonathan Woolbright, owner and general manager of Woodlast Products of Benton. Davis is staff development trainer at Arkansas Children&apos;s Hospital in Little Rock and Pafford specializes in internal medicine at Saline Memorial Hospital.

 Mattingly thinks AAU tournament&apos;s 
 estimated impact is conservative 
 They teamed years back to provide fans with action-filled accounts of Benton and Bryant basketball and football games. Now, some 30 years after being armed with a cassette recorder and a penchant for broadcasting, Benton Mayor Dave Mattingly and longtime AAU coach and officer Ron Crawford are part of an effort to provide Saline County with a welcomed economic boost.
 The two said Monday that the Amateur Athletic Union’s Community Based League national championship basketball tournament is expected to pump at least $2.1 million into the local economy, although Mattingly said later that he feels the estimate is conservative.
 Benton will be the host city for the event, which will be held Tuesday-Saturday, July 5-9. Facilities at Bryant, Bauxite and Haskell also will be used to accommodate up to 134 boys, girls and coed teams comprised of youngsters in grades 4-7.
 Mayors Jill Dabbs of Bryant, Johnny McMahan of Bauxite and Jeff Arey of Haskell joined County Judge Lanny Fite, Benton Superintendent Tony Prothro, Benton Athletic Director Steve Quinn and numerous other officials at Monday afternoon’s news conference at the Benton Area Chamber of Commerce.
 Crawford, AAU national treasurer and recognized coach of the Arkansas Wings AAU team, said AAU officials used a 2.5 multiplier to determine the estimated economic impact for the county. Each traveling party will average 22 people, he said, including 10 players, three coaches and nine parents or guardians. Teams have to use motel accommodations in Saline County, and each person will spend an average of $175 per day while here, Crawford said.
 AAU officials expect a minimum of 100 teams to participate in the tournament. Teams throughout the nation are eligible to participate, but Crawford said he expects the field to feature teams from Arkansas and surrounding states.
 “This is obviously a great opportunity for the county,”Mattingly said,“and this illustrates how our communities can work together in a positive manner.”
 “This is the first time we have participated with several cities in one area, such as a county, for a tournament like this,”Crawford said.“We think this is the way to go.”
 He called the economic impact from youth sports events“a great secret”around the country.“But AAU has 600,000 youth members, and a quarter of a million of them participate in basketball,”Crawford said.
 Both Mattingly and Crawford said Saline County will receive“tremendous”national exposure from the event because it will be advertised and promoted nationwide.
 The CBL is comprised of teams from public elementary and middle schools, Boys&amp;Girls Clubs, parks and recreation associations, community centers, church leagues, Jewish community centers, police athletic leagues, YMCAs, the Native American Sports Council, the USA Deaf Sports Federation and independent leagues.
 “My goal with AAU basketball is that we have a 100 percent graduation rate later on, when youngsters go to colleges and universities, and that each kid gets a scholarship,”Crawford said.
 Bobby Dodd, AAU president and chief executive officer, said Saline County was selected for this tournament because of the availability of facilities and its proximity to Little Rock and Hot Springs.
 Dodd, whom Crawford later called“one of my best friends,”is AAU’s longest-serving president. He was a former youth sports leader in Memphis and engineered the AAU’s move from Indianapolis, Ind., to the Orlando, Fla., area in the late 1990s.
 Crawford, who has been involved with AAU for 32 years, helped Dodd design the AAU headquarters at the ESPN complex at Disney’s Wide World of Sports. Technically, AAU is headquartered in Lake Buena Vista.
 Dodd, incidentally, is not related to the late Bobby Dodd who coached football at Georgia Tech University.“But I get asked that question all the time,”Crawford said.
 Crawford, who now lives in Little Rock, is a former Saline County resident. He and his family lived in the Salem community for 17 years. His son, Keith, is a graduate of Benton High School and his daughter, Ronda Maxwell, is a graduate of Bryant High School.
 “My wife and I may decide to move back to Saline County at some point,”Ron Crawford said.“Our daughter and her family live in Paron and we have a 10-acre site next to them if we ever want to build there.”
 Mattingly and Crawford did local play-by-play starting in the early 1980s. Their tape-delayed broadcasts were aired on what was then KBBA-AM radio in Benton, which was owned by Winston Riddle and his son, John. The station is now KEWI and is owned by Jim Landers.
 Crawford latched onto several broadcasting gigs after that, including a two-year stint as an Arkansas color analyst when the late Paul Eels was the Voice of the Razorbacks. Crawford has spent the past 18 years as a regular guest on“Drive Time Sports,”a popular sports talk radio show that airs weekday afternoons on KABZ-FM, 103.7, in Little Rock.

 Alexander mayor&apos;s wife reportedly 
 is facing new set of drug charges 
 Genieve Mitchell, the wife of Alexander Mayor Paul Mitchell, faces new drug charges after she allegedly pocketed methamphetamine and a meth pipe outside a fast-food restaurant in Bryant, according to Fox 16 News of Little Rock.
 An acquaintance of Mrs. Mitchell reportedly telephoned the mayor&apos;s wife for assistance after the acquaintance and another adult were stopped for driving with fictitious tags. The acquaintance had an infant and wanted Mrs. Mitchell to care for the baby, police said. The acquaintance allegedly passed two bags of meth and the pipe to Mitchell, police said.
 &quot;The officers say (Mrs. Mitchell) wasn&apos;t being cooperative. She kept throwing out &apos;my husband is the mayor of Alexander&apos; almost like &apos;you can&apos;t do this to me because of who my husband is,&apos;&quot;Bryant Detective Todd Crowson is quoted as saying.
 Mrs. Mitchell&apos;s charges include felony possession of meth with intent to deliver. She is on probation for a 2007 drug charge, according to police.
 Mayor Mitchell declined to comment during a special Alexander City Council meeting on Friday night, citing the ongoing police investigation. A number of residents reportedly were supportive of the mayor, saying they expect him to separate the personal issue from his duties with the city.
 Mrs. Mitchell reportedly was arrested in February but the report does not name a date.

 Benton Mayor Mattingly delivers 
 inaugural State of the City address 
 Following is the full text of the first State of the City address from Benton Mayor Dave Mattingly. He referred to the address during the City Council meeting on Monday, the day the address was made available with the cooperation of Mattingly&apos;s office and Tina Coston, his administrative assistant. The address is presented largely unedited. Only minor changes were made to accommodate formatting: 
 Legendary UCLA basketball coach, John Wooden, said on many occasions, when asked to describe his philosophy of life,“Be true to yourself, help others, pray for guidance, and give thanks for your blessings every day.”His commitment to his chosen career and his dedication to his community were admired by all who came in contact with him. Another man that I admired greatly, my father, used to say there is no“I”in team. It always amazed me when he would make such statements because I never really understood their importance until I was old enough to recognize and appreciate what experience can do in strengthening your values.
 The recent announcement from the 2010 census that Benton now has 30,681 residents certainly represents a historic milestone. In 1833 the city was first settled by some hardy pioneers, who were a part of the formal charter creating the State of Arkansas in 1836. Our heritage is still evident today in many structures that are on the historic register, including the Old River Bridge at Saline Crossing, which was first built in 1891. I wonder if they could have imagined that 178 years later our city would turn into the urban settlement that it is today. This type of growth occurs because of good schools, a safe environment, affordable homes, a vibrant business community, outstanding health care facilities, excellent parks, and first-rate youth programs.
 All the information presented as a part of the“State of the City Address”will be made available to all citizens at www.benton.ar.gov . You may find a more detailed Police Department report at www.bentonpolice.org .

 CITY of BENTON FIRE DEPARTMENT
 At the close of 2010 the Fire Department personnel completed 12,248 hours of training and responded to 2,794 incidents. Property with an estimated value of $24.7 million was exposed to fire. Property consumed by fire was estimated at $.2 million. This leaves a net savings to the taxpayer of $23.5 million. The Benton Fire Department protects approximately 21 square miles within the city limits and provides mutual aid to all fire departments in Saline County. I am pleased to say there were no fire deaths in our city for 2010.
 Over 1,120 fire hydrants were tested in the spring and again in the fall to ensure they meet the standards of the American Water Works Association. Any deficient hydrants were reported to the Water Distribution Department for repair or replacement.
 Businesses, schools, retirement centers, nursing homes, the hospital, adult and child day care centers were inspected for hazards. Information was developed or updated for all target hazards to better protect these facilities.
 The Fire Department provided Fire Education Programs through our local daycares, public schools and community events. Through our efforts an estimated 5,000 children and adults received instruction and/or fire safety related handout materials. We also continue developing our Senior Citizens Home Safety programs. Research shows that after children, senior citizens are the next largest group to be the victims of fire and injury. By utilizing the fire department safety trailer and focused educational programs we teach by demonstration and lecture how these injuries can be mitigated.
 · In 2011 our department will continue to work with the Saline County Office of Emergency Management in the areas of Hazardous Materials response and disaster planning. We will also move forward with the operation of the Health and Safety Committee to evaluate on the job injuries and accidents to develop safer working policies and conditions for our members, as well as advancing our work with Benton Water Utilities in coordinating replacement and new construction of the water system to provide the best fire protection available within our systems capability.
 · The Fire Department continues to provide professional services to our citizens and visitors and is considered to be one of the most competent in the region; our personnel are recognized throughout the state as some of the most qualified in our field. We commit to the citizens of our City that we will continue to provide the highest level of emergency services possible with the resources allocated.
 COMMUNICATIONS
 During the past year, there have been several improvements made as it relates to Communications and Information Technology. First, the main Fiber Optic Loop connecting a majority of the main City buildings was completed. This gives the City of Benton a 2-Gigabyte Network that is redundant in the event that the fiber is damaged at any point across the loop. We also added a 16-Megabit Cable Internet Connection to the Network, which greatly sped up the many Web-based applications being used throughout the City. A Load Balancing Device was installed to the Cable Internet connection and the existing T-1 Line to balance the load, divide up the bandwidth, and limit any particular user from using all of the bandwidth. This device will also switch to the T-1 Line entirely, in the event the Cable Internet was to fail, and vice versa. Reporting Software was installed that immediately reports, via e-mail, any outages at any connection point throughout the Network, and when the connection is back in operation, it immediately sends out another e-mail stating that the connection is back online. The majority of the PCs in the City were moved to the“bentonar”domain this year. The few that remain should be moved to the domain in 2011. We replaced 3 PCs in Utilities Billing and upgraded the RAM in 7 others. A new PC and 42”LCD Monitor was added to the Waste Water Treatment Plant for the purpose of viewing the SCADA main screen. In the Administrative Department, we upgraded the RAM in 7 PCs. We also replaced 4 PCs in the Electric Department and two in the Police Department.
 Projects scheduled for 2011 are: Finishing the 8 total Wireless Access Download Points for the Police Department. We will add NAS (Networked Attached Storage) Devices at 2 locations, City Hall and Purchasing, for Backing up all Servers and for disaster recovery. Old technology Non-managed switches will be replaced with Intelligent Managed Switches at 6 different locations around the city. We will complete the connection of the Fiber Optic Network to the Animal Control Department, the Street Department, and the Parks Department and install a Malware/Spyware device and a SPAM filtering device within the network.
 At the 911 Communications Center, we once again had an increase in call volume for the year. During the year, our 911 Department received 46,105 calls for service. Of those calls, 35,438 were for the Police Department, 2,829 were for the Fire Department, 8,640 were for Med Tran Ambulance Service, and 98 were for Animal Control. In 2011, we plan to replace the three old PCs at the Communications Center and install the newest version of CAD (Computer Aided Dispatch) on these computers.
 The departmental goal in 2011 is to continue to upgrade and improve the entire City Network, 911 Communications System, and all related equipment. I am committed to keeping all of our equipment running and in good repair until it’s time for any piece to be replaced. A faster Network is more efficient and will increase productivity for all City employees. Thank you and may God richly bless you in 2011!
 COMMUNITY&amp;ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
 This report is regarding the state of the Community Development Department at the end of 2010. The mission of the Community Development Department is twofold:
 --Community Development is focused on the management of growth. 
 --Economic Development is focused on the creation of growth.
 Our goal is to establish the framework within which the public and private sector resources can be utilized to promote both community and economic development.
 Community Development Department: The Community Development Department’s main focus is to ensure the citizens of Benton that the structures which are constructed in our area meet all state, federal and local codes -- we do this by issuing permits and inspecting structures.
 In the permit area, our people have done a total of 4,220 inspections in 2010; issued permits for 226 residential structures representing a total estimated retail value of $38,373,582.00; and 4 commercial structures for a total estimated retail value of $1,537,265.00. We have responded to 87 storm water concerns, and resolved all of those concerns, written 3 warnings and issued no citations. On April 23, 2010 we went to the Caldwell Elementary School and talked to 155 students about storm water.
 Economic Development Department: The second part of the Community Development Department is economic development. Economic Development has been elevated in importance during 2010. We have focused on 10 different developmental areas:
 1. Coordinated visits with Industrial, commercial and retail prospect.
 2. Responded to RFP’s and RFI’s.
 3. Worked to obtain state and local incentives and business financing.
 4. Earmarked funds dedicated for economic development.
 5. Worked hard to ensure business and industrial retention.
 6. Continued commitment to retail development.
 7. Worked to continue our focus on leadership development.
 8. Continued to follow the Benton Strategic Plan.
 9. Focus on regionalism for Economic Development.
 10. Continued focus on updating our web site and exploring further the emphasis on digital technology.
 We have been fortunate in the City of Benton to see growth even though the rest of the country has been in a state of economic down turn in 2010. The City Clerk has issued 205 new or changed ownership privilege licenses. A few of the new businesses are: Aaron’s Sale&amp;Lease, Game X Change, La Valentina, Ernie’s Sassy Boutique, Just Leave It to Liz, Kooler Ice and Taco Bueno. We have had industrial and large commercial visits from several companies within the United States and the world who have travelled to Benton and Saline County in 2010 to look at facilities within our service area.
 Another economic indicator is our sales and use tax -- in 2010 totals $7,735.438.14 compared to 2009 totals of $7,445,023.11 shows an increase while most all of the towns around Benton are showing reductions.
 We have contacted well over 100 franchises, restaurants, convenience stores, dry goods stores, just to mention a few: Big Lots, TJ Maxx, Cracker Barrel, Paul Michaels, Hobby Lobby, Red Lobster, Purple Cow, Dollar General, Expert Tires, Fantastic Sam’s, Sam’s Wholesale Club, Cheese Burgers in Paradise, Country Kitchen and Five Guys Famous Burgers and the list goes on.
 It has been the pleasure of the Community Development Department and the people that work within its walls to serve the citizens of our great City.
 ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES
 For the fiscal year 2010, General Fund revenues are up over fiscal year 2009 approximately 7.46%, which includes an increase in grant revenues of $112,850. Expenditures in the General Fund at December 31, 2010 are up a very slight 1.07%, over December 31, 2009. The increase in expenditures is related to $130,000 in vehicles in the police department (the evidence collection vehicle and the K-9 Tahoe) and the renovation project at the Benton Senior Adult Center. All other spending in the General Fund remained flat, and even slightly decreased. General, Street, Animal Control, Parks, A&amp;P Commission, and Utilities employees were given raises in July, 2010.
 UTILITIES
 What is progress? Progress is defined as movement toward a goal, development or growth and steady improvement. We cannot wait until everything is in a state of turmoil to see progress. If we wait, there will never be a perfect time as challenges, obstacles and less than perfect conditions will always exist. With each positive step we take, our city grows stronger and stronger. Benton Utilities is dedicated to progress, driven by a goal of providing better service for every customer in our service area and to make the City of Benton more successful.
 In recent years we have made great strides in moving our Billing Department toward an easier more defined in house billing program through the use of Daffron IXP software. In 2010, we were able to move the Benton Administrative and Procurement Services into this same software. This is a more user friendly system that will allow all departments to access and use information more readily.
 In 2009, Military Road Upgrades came on our radar with the proposed utility work starting in 2010. Benton Utilities portion of this project has been completed under budget and the actual roadway work will soon begin under the direction of Mayor Mattingly. These upgrades are necessary to accommodate the growth Benton has seen in recent years.
 In the Electric Department we are working to reduce costs of both energy usage and personnel. In an effort to reduce the amount of energy the City consumes, we have been working with Central Arkansas Planning and Development District on the approval of a grant to install energy efficient lighting in City Buildings and on City Streets. Also, the Benton Public Utilities Commission and the Benton Parks Commission are working together to install timers on ball park lights at Bernard Holland Park. These timers will turn off the ball park lights when they are not in use. The plan is to continue this with our other parks, as funds become available. Reducing energy usage in the City helps reduce energy costs and will eventually result in energy savings to you, our customer.
 Also to reduce costs in the Electric Department, the Public Utility Commission evaluated the cost of having our own manpower perform the tree trimming activities in right of ways for electrical lines. After careful consideration it was determined that it was more cost efficient to outsource these tree trimming activities. Affected personnel were absorbed into vacant positions in other areas of the department.
 There were also changes in the Wellington Point Subdivision in 2010. The overhead power lines in parts of this area were very hard to access for Electric Department personnel. These lines were in a valley that line trucks could not go into and during storms were one of the first areas to go out. In the past year these overhead lines have been put underground.
 Benton Utilities and the Public Utility Commission were very proud to work with the Benton School System last year in a cost sharing program to install fiber optic in a loop around the City. This allows the school system to use the fiber network and gave the City of Benton Municipal Offices, as well as Fire and Police Departments, the use of fiber optic instead of the expensive T1 line they had been paying for.
 Water is the most abundant resource on the earth’s surface. Many substances dissolve in water and because of this it is rarely pure. Water is a very important life sustaining necessity both for drinking purposes and safety. Every spring and summer we receive numerous phone calls about the taste and smell of our water. Although this is not a life threatening problem, it is still a nuisance. In 2010 we finally found a solution. A SolarBee®was installed at the Chenault Reservoir. This piece of equipment is solar powered and will constantly turn the water. This turning keeps the blue green algae from growing and producing the bad taste and smell.
 The Benton Public Utilities Commission has been working toward making sure all of the water customers in Benton have adequate water pressure for fire flows. In 2010, a water line was run down Scott Salem Road to make the water line in that area a full loop. This water line will allow continued water pressure if a line is ruptured and allow for fire flow protection in the area.
 As we work to maintain the equipment we have in all areas of the utilities, repairs are needed. Last year one of the clearwells at the Water Plant had to be rehabbed to repair areas where leaks were occurring. These clearwells are needed to process water for every customer in Benton.
 Many of you may not know that Lake Norrell is a water source for the City of Benton water customers. This lake in northern Saline County is owned by the City and is a valuable water source in the dry months of the summer. Last year fencing and concrete barriers were installed around the top of the dam to keep four wheelers and four wheel drive vehicles off of the dam. Since this is an important water source for our customers, we did not want the dam damaged in any way.
 In order to make sure we can provide an adequate water supply to all of our customers in 2010, we dredged the area around the Saline River water intake. This was done to remove the silt and sediment that had flowed into the area as a result of the heavy rains of 2009.
 In recent years we have been working to upgrade parts of our wastewater system. We have upgraded our wastewater plant and are now working on the collections system throughout our City.
 Each year we make steady improvement in sewer lines within our great City. The Public Utilities Commission dedicates monies annually to have old deteriorated sewer lines replaced with larger lines.
 Manhole Restoration has been an ongoing battle for many years. In 2010 a decision was made by the Benton Public Utility Commission to do a cost comparison on whether it was more cost efficient to purchase a manhole restoration machine or to continue to let an outside contractor perform the work for us. After this cost comparison a determination was made that it would cost less to do the work in house with our current employees than to hire a contractor. A manhole restoration machine was then purchased and our employees were trained in its use.
 As part of the ongoing work in our wastewater departments to reduce inflow and infiltration (I&amp;I) replacement of inadequate pump stations was necessary. The Willow Street Pump Station was rehabbed and upgraded to allow this I&amp;I to be pumped directly into the Equalization Basin during period of high flow thereby reducing overflows and potential fines by ADEQ. Four other pump stations were part of this upgrading and submersible pumps were installed to make them more efficient and safer for our employees.
 The last thing that has happened this year in the wastewater department was the signing of a contract with Mannco Environmental to allow Mannco to purchase the bio solids from the wastewater treatment plant. Mannco will then use these bio solids to produce fertilizers. In the past, this product was hauled or given away to local farms in the area for land application.
 As you can see progress is occurring and we are moving toward our goal to provide the best utilities at the lowest cost possible to our customers. We are working to find another wholesale electric provider once our current contract expires and to keep our current infrastructure upgraded and in service. This is progress, and we are determined to keep the customer informed of all decisions through our monthly newsletter and beginning April 4, 2011 through our annual Stakeholders Meeting. Our system will always need upgrading, but I assure you we are dedicated to maintaining the best facilities possible for our growing city.
 ADVERTISING&amp;PROMOTION COMMISSION
 Two subjects dominated the conversation for the Advertising&amp;Promotion Commission in 2010: Saline Summer Daze and The Fairplex.
 On Memorial Day Weekend, in conjunction with the Wally Hall Tournament of Champions, the A&amp;P Commission co-sponsored Saline Summer Daze 2010, featuring American Idol winner Kris Allen. Benton was headline news all weekend, as we presented Kris Allen for his first Arkansas concert. The area south of Holland Chapel, all the way to Bernard Holland Park was home to a fantastic music festival featuring Riverbilly, Dry County, Crash Meadows and Kris Allen.
 In 2010 plans were completed for the Fairplex. In May and June, the Quorum Court voted to allow a special election on August 10, 2010 for the voters of Saline County to vote on the project. The vote was defeated by margin of 3 to 1. The Advertising and Promotion Commission is pleased that the Fairplex was brought before the people to decide. The project was carried forward as far as it could be before the election, and it was complete in every way.

 PARKS COMMISSION
 The Parks Department and Parks Commission continue to make remarkable progress to improve our current Park facilities with many completed projects in 2010 as we continue to make improvements to enhance the park experience for our citizens. 
 Owens-Mooney Park received a make-over with new trees and a stunning rock water feature. Master Gardeners also contribute to the beautification of the downtown park. A new addition to the park is the Trail of Tears commemorative marker honoring the Native American migration to the West.
 Sunset Lake continues to be improved through vegetation control and is regularly stocked by a partnership with Parks and the Arkansas Game&amp;Fish Commission.
 Ralph Bunche Park was improved with new grills and paint. It serves as the site for the Juneteenth Celebration and the Back to School Picnic.
 The past year brought new dugouts and many field improvements to baseball fields at Holland Park. Renovation and expansion will continue in 2011 to enhance facilities for the Wally Hall Tournament of Champions and the 2011 Cal Ripken 12 and under regional tournament. Our adult church softball league continues to grow with over 50 softball teams and over 25 co-ed teams in the fall.
 Tyndall Park was home to ASA District 9 district tournament, ASA State tournament for girls 6 and under, numerous other tournaments, and our 4th of July fireworks show. We expect a very successful Tournament of Champions for girls’fast pitch softball at Tyndall this year.
 The Benton City Council voted to designate the south end of the old Saline County Airport property for park use which allowed the Parks Commission to move forward with a design for a new girls’softball complex. 
 For several years Curtis McCormack has made application to Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism for 50/50 matching grants for the completion of major projects. Early in 2010 we received reimbursement of $50,000 for our 2009 grant award. In March we were awarded over $64,000 for our 2010 project. Last month we were awarded $71,995 for 2011 park projects. In slow economic times, we are proud to be recognized by the State for our continued efforts to improve parks for our citizens.
 Some of the amenities planned for the future are the new girls’softball facility, lighting at Sunset Lake, the BMX track and a dog park. We look forward to continued growth and great things to happen in Parks.
 STREETS
 During the year, there were five projects done through contracts which include: South Shady Lane, Jackman at Fairfield, South Market, Dark Forest, and 324 North Street. Also, there were three major center lane painting projects completed on Congo Road, South Street and North Market Street. There was only one major asphalt resurfacing contract, which was on Congo Road, and by year’s end we had used approximately 1700 tons of hot mix asphalt for resurfacing streets, utility cuts and potholes. There was a major concrete repair completed in Wellington Pointe.
 Other items of interest include: Eight major culvert replacements and 332 street signs were replaced.

 ANIMAL CONTROL
 · The City of Benton Animal Control has had a busy year! In 2010, we had 543 dogs picked up by our animal control officers, 99 dogs were surrendered by their owners and 156 strays were brought in by citizens. Of these 798 dogs, 347 were adopted and 160 were reclaimed by their owners. Our adoption rate has increased greatly due to the help of our local rescue groups and adopters.
 In 2010 we had 417 cats brought to our shelter of which 123 were adopted and one was reclaimed by its owner. The cat adoption rate has also increased with the help of our local rescue groups and Petfinder.com.
 The euthanasia rate decreased in 2010. The total number of cats and dogs euthanized was 595 as compared to 899 in 2009. Our goal is to see our adoption rate increase next year to avoid high euthanasia rates.
 Not including after hour calls or patrols, our animal control officers went on 1584 animal related calls in 2010.
 Overall 2010 was a busy, but productive year, and we look forward to another good year in 2011.
 MAYOR&apos;S CLOSING REMARKS
 I would like to take this opportunity to thank our 10 aldermen, City Attorney and City Clerk for their hard work and faithful service to our city. In 2010 there were 56 Ordinances and 57 Resolutions considered.
 At this time I would like to recognize our City Council Members and other elected officials:
 --Former Alderman Larry Wolfe–Animal Control Committee Chair
 --Former Alderman Greg White–Drainage Committee Chair
 --Alderman Charles Cunningham–Community Service Committee Chair
 --Alderman Joe Lee Richards 
 --Alderman Bill Donnor–Personnel Committee Chair
 --Alderman Jerry Ponder–Finance Committee Chair
 --Alderman Brad Moore–Liaison to the Parks Commission and Commissioner of the A&amp;P Commission
 --Alderman David Sparks–Street Committee Chair
 --Alderman Steve Lee–Health&amp;Safety Committee Chair
 --Alderman Doug Stracener–Economic Development Committee Chair, liaison to the Public Utilities Commission and Commissioner of the A&amp;P Commission
 --City Attorney, Brent Houston
 --City Clerk, Cindy Stracener
 The City of Benton has a dedicated work force consisting of over 200 employees, who recognize the needs of our community, and by their attitude and actions, demonstrate their commitment to making Benton an exceptional place to live. Evidence of this spirit can be seen throughout the community by the fact that we were awarded the prestigious“Volunteer Community of the Year”award for the second year in a row, presented by The Municipal League of Arkansas. In the nomination we submitted a grand total of 12,218 volunteers and 261,854 hours of service given by our community’s outstanding volunteers for 2010. Organizations, such as the Senior Adult Center, which provides activities for our older citizens, all the way to our youngest volunteers, The Mayor’s Youth Advisory Council, which is comprised of students grades 10-12, is indicative of the wide spectrum of our citizens who commit themselves to helping others.
 I consider it a privilege to be given this opportunity to lead our city in a most challenging time. At the recent Benton Chamber of Commerce Annual Banquet, the featured speaker, Dr. Fitz Hill, said it best when he said,“Each day when we get up, try to make somebody else’s life better. It’s not about you, it’s all about them.”That is our challenge in City Government, and my purpose is to set our city on a course that will have the future generations of Benton saying,“Well done, my good and faithful servants.”
