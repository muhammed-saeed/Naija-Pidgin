My back is making it nearly impossible to do anything today, including cook. Even something simple. Letting myself off the hook this one time. More motivation to get better, as fast food is yuck! (I might better prepare myself for such occurences in the future by keeping the freezer stocked with delicious premade meals.) 3 weeks ago

I felt a temptation this evening but I went to the grocery store to satisfy my cravings instead. It’s not fast food, but it’s not all that healthy either…at least what I chose tonight. 4 weeks ago

 decafaholic wrote Accidental accomplishment 
 
I never set out to quit eating fast food, but it happened because of some life transitions I was making.
1. Paying for massage therapy school took half my savings and every dime in my checking account. There was no money for eating out, so I didn’t during that 8 month period.

2. I moved out on my own (well, with roommates that is!) a year ago and again, I’m cutting costs by not eating out much. When I do eat out, it’s almost always something fresh with vegetables/wheat bread/sushi.

I discovered that after having not eaten fast food for a long time, it wasn’t appealing to me anymore. 1 month ago

I saw a fast food ad for thai chicken pizza&amp;was bummed, but then I remembered I can cook. 1 month ago

 this is just a test wrote idiot proof 
 
I made tacos last night. The only reason it wasn’t cheaper than eating out was because I insisted on only the finest quality ingredients. Still, it was put together fairly quickly&amp;easily. Tasty too. 1 month ago

I will consider this goal done when I stop thinking of fast food as an option. I only ever eat it from laziness/lack of imagination anyway, definitely not the taste. 2 months ago
