Gr 6 Up-This dictionary illustrates more than 3700 words. The full-color pictures are logically arranged into 12 thematic groupings including everyday language, people, housing, food, clothing, health, community, transportation, plants and animals, work, and recreation. Color-coded strips and icons in the margins make for easy access. The words selected constitute a practical and necessary vocabulary for anyone learning English. Exercises that enable readers to practice and review new words and phrases appear on the bottom of each page. Nouns, adjectives, prepositions, and adverbs are included in numbered lists that correspond with the pictures. The alphabetical and geographical indexes help to locate words and provide pronunciations. The graphics are particularly appealing; arranged in varying formats but never cluttered, the pictures are clear, realistic, and contemporary. A useful and practical reference tool for libraries with ESOL or remedial-reading programs.-Sylvia V. Meisner, Allen Middle School, Greensboro, NC Copyright 1999 Cahners Business Information.
