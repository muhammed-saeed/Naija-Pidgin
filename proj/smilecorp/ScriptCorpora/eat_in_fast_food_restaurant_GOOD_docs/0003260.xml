Technically, I&apos;m Orchard Park, though I live within the corporate boundaries of Hamburg. Go figure that one out.

But before I&apos;m branded as a born and raised suburbanite (which I am), let me state I am the rare suburbanite who has a respect for, and enjoys his time in, the parent city; without which none of these places would exist.

I may, in time, move into the city, if the conditions are right. I challenge them to come and draw me in...the effort alone will improve the city dramatically. bjfan82 November 18th, 2005, 02:30 PM sarg - yeah your name is actually pretty hard to spell...harder than&quot;necessity&quot;and&quot;necessarily&quot;

I really wish it wasn&apos;t so damn suburban office-park looking. then again I am certainly glad that it is being built in downtown buffalo and is bringing 1200 workers to the site. Too bad it didn&apos;t have more of an urban look to it though.. *shrug* bjfan82 November 20th, 2005, 05:45 PM ^ I just wish it had some height to it...i&apos;m not totally against the &apos;suburban style&apos;...i just want something downtown that looks like it was built in the last 50 years...the thing I particularly like about it though, is its location. It comes up close to the 190 so when driving by you get a nice glimpse at a new modern building rather than a brownfield. BuffCity November 20th, 2005, 05:49 PM my take on this site:

Looks good, it will fit in with the Adam&apos;s Mark, and other waterfront office buildings that do look suburban, but are infact urban because they are located downtown.

With New Era, HealthNow both moving downtown, and being within blocks of each other, this is fairly significant considering they are actually taking space in an empty building or building on a new lot.

My girlfiriend works for a law firm at 135 Delaware (across W. Mohawk from the Statler), and spends a fair amount of the day at the Statler. Granted it&apos;s only speculation on their part, but I suppose they&apos;d be more privy to rumors like that.

Trettel, developer of Buehl, owns the two story building adjacent to his current project. I&apos;m not sure what his plans are for it. The mustard color buildings are owned by Emulso. Sounds like they&apos;re staying put, but they&apos;d make for some interesting loft space:

But I don&apos;t have much confidence in him putting something together- maybe he&apos;s still hoping for a purchaser to take it off his hands.

Went to the Bills game in SD this past weekend. Quit watching after the half and went to the concourse and had many beers and talked to the many other Bills fans there. Quite a representation from around the country. The team failed to show up, though.

San Diego has put up a lot of taller condos recently.
I wish HaelthNow was a 15 storey building rather than what they are puttting up. Looking forward to a Christmas in Buffalo next month. Usually get downtown a few times. There are many new apartment projects and renovations. It&apos;s good to see a nice trend toward that- a true resurgence will happen when people move downtown.

Agency puts proposal for residences on hold

-------------------------------------------------------------
Concern expressed over lost open space

By SHARON LINSTEDT
News Staff Reporter
11/24/2005

A proposal for a new residential development in Buffalo&apos;s Waterfront Village has been put on hold while neighbors explore options for safe-guarding the land for community use.
The Buffalo Urban Renewal Agency on Wednesday tabled a plan to build a dozen high-end homes on the last remaining green space in the waterfront neighborhood that borders the Erie Basin Marina. Buffalo businessman Richard DiVita Sr. is seeking to become&quot;designated developer&quot;for the 2.4-acre, city-owned parcel and build two single-family, and five duplex townhouses.

Sherry Dellebovi, a representative of the Waterfront Housing Council, said residents want time to research how to preserve the open space.

&quot;These are the last acres of green left at the waterfront and we&apos;d like an opportunity to see how the community could continue to make use of it,&quot;Dellebovi said.&quot;Maybe it could be a park that everyone could enjoy. We need time to find out what&apos;s possible.&quot;

Waterfront residents have begun discussions about buying the land from the city and locating a swimming pool and community clubhouse on the site, while maintaining a portion of the parcel as open area.

Another resident, Peter Jason, called on the city to issue a formal request for proposals to see if there are other developers with plans that might be better for the neighborhood.

&quot;What&apos;s the rush here? There might be another way to go that would still put it back on the tax rolls,&quot;Jason said.

Under BURA&apos;s land valuation formula, the price tag to acquire the site is $380,000 regardless of the end use.

DiVita approached the city earlier this fall with preliminary plans for a $7 million residential development he said is the product of his own housing needs. The longtime Buffalo resident and self-described&quot;senior citizen,&quot;said he was looking to move to smaller quarters in the city, but couldn&apos;t find anything he liked that had most of the living space on the first floor.

&quot;I don&apos;t want to move out to a ranch home in the suburbs if I can avoid it, and I know there are other people my age who feel the same way,&quot;DiVita said.

He and his wife, Diane, have plans for 2,500-square-foot homes with 1,800 square-feet of space on the ground floor. The DiVitas said they have informal commitments from four other potential buyers for the homes, which will be priced at $500,000 and up.

&quot;These are not going to be high-rise buildings that will block people&apos;s views. And the construction will be very high quality. They&apos;ll meet or exceed the best of what has been built down there,&quot;DiVita said.

He noted that the city&apos;s Urban Renewal Plan allows a density of up to 90 units per acre on the waterfront land, making his 12 dwellings spread over nearly 2.5 acres comparatively&quot;sparse.&quot;

The BURA board set no timetable to revisit DiVita&apos;s Riverplace Homes proposal. Mayor Anthony M. Masiello said while he would have preferred giving DiVita designated developer status for six months, he will leave that decision to Mayor-elect Byron Brown&apos;s administration. :ohno:

Meanwhile, another Waterfront Village housing development took a big leap forward. Ellicott Development Corporation was given approval to purchase a nearby 5.4 acre parcel for $833,000 to build a $30 million, 80-unit residential project. :)

Construction will start next spring on 30 townhouses and a 13-story, 50-unit tower. The project ranks as one of the largest, privately owned housing developments ever built in Buffalo.

Ellicott principal Carl P. Paladino did run into a hurdle, however, in his plan to build a $45 million, 11-story office building on Court Street, between Franklin and Pearl streets, in downtown Buffalo. The BURA board tabled his purchase of the city-owned land for two weeks while it has the parcel reappraised.

Paladino had negotiated a price of $483,000 for the land, which is currently used as a surface parking lot, but a $1 million offer this week from Violet Realty, owner of the adjacent Main Place Mall and Liberty Building, has reopened the question of how much the land is worth. :eek: steel November 24th, 2005, 07:44 PM Main Palce Liberty is bidding up that Court street property because they have always been against Paladino&apos;s project. they are looking to kill it. Look for more parking if they win. BuffCity November 24th, 2005, 08:56 PM all the city should say is: whoever buys it has to develope it into a building and not a parking structure.

1,000,000$ for that lot seems a little much, don&apos;t get me wrong it is the center of downtown, but I think this is showing something very troubling...

There seems to be such little business moving to Buffalo that instead of these developers looking to make competitive buildings and lots to attract tenants, they are now fighting over the few remaining by getting very political. If Paladino builds his new building on Court, some people might move out of the Liberty which because nobody seems to move to Buffalo...would increase vacancy.

Personally, agree with me or not, this sucks...and the politics just shows why NOTHING is happening in Buffalo now.

btw....

What up with no agreement on Bass Pro shops still?

8.75% sales tax....THANK YOU (we can now expect more business closings) ECoastTransplant November 25th, 2005, 06:00 AM Its quite obvious that they&apos;re trying to pre-empt the competition by buying that site. I still don&apos;t think Paladino is going to build a speculative office building there- he either has tenants lined up or is just dealing to get that property in his portfolio for future development. The City needs some kind of reversion clause so that if he doesn&apos;t turn dirt in a specified time, the City gets the property back.

Norstar Development is taking its show on the road- they&apos;re planning a 65 to 75 unit condo development in downtown Albany. Its a renovation project. WIGS November 25th, 2005, 06:02 AM lol I&apos;ve dealt with high taxes in Canada my whole life.

Hopefully, by Feb or March we&apos;ll be in the city. That was the main reason we moved back, to live in a city and be able to afford it.

My Dad has always lived in the burbs...grew up in Cedargrove Heights in Cheektowaga...oh yeah, brief stint in the city with my mom after they were married, then a few years in Depew and into West Seneca.

Its my mom that disappoints me re: city living. She grew up in a very small town in PA, about 2-3 hours from Buffalo. Moved to the&quot;city&quot;when she was 18...lived all over the Elmwood area and finally moved out when my Dad got his job at Depew High School...she&apos;s missed it ever since.

WIGS, now...

In Canada you pay 15% on everything, but healthcare is included in that, and you have a much higher percentage of people per capita actually working and not on welfare VS. the USA.

Now in New York State, you pay property tax, income tax, school tax, sales tax, social security tax, medicare tax, federal tax, DMV fees, DOT fees, PLUS most of us pay for our own healthcare ontop of this...so when you defend and addition .50% to top off the sales tax of Erie County at 8.75%...you are infact saying it&apos;s okay to add to these heavy heavy taxes, and being canadian and blind of what it&apos;s like to pay NY situation taxes...I find that kinda troubling.

Here is my estimate on taxes in NYS:

Property Tax - $2000 on 100,000k house/property
School Tax - $1500 on 100,000 house/property
NYS income Tax - 4% of Gross Pay
Sales Tax - 8.75% of all purchuses (excluding food)
Medicare Tax - 2% of Gross Pay
Social Security Tax - 6% of Gross Pay
Federal income Tax - 10% of Gross Pay
DMV Fees (motor vehicles) Registration/inspection - $50/yr
DOT Fees (Highways) Tolls - AVG. $50/yr per vehicle

A person owning a ($100,000) house in Batavia, working in Buffalo making Gross (40,000$ /yr) would pay...

$14,000 year in taxes, before tax credits if any.

WHY DO WE LEAVE??? ??? ???

pretty sad, and most of you won&apos;t admit the reason as taxes...but we all know that reason we see no new shiny buildings, loads of new jobs and constant development is because of the above...HIGH TAXES. sargeantcm November 26th, 2005, 06:04 PM DMV Fees (motor vehicles) Registration/inspection - $50/yr


Try living in NH, paying even higher property taxes ($10,000/yr isn&apos;t out of the question - and now they&apos;re even starting to tax backyard views, if you can believe that), and paying possibly upwards of $400-600/yr to register your car. Oh, but they don&apos;t have an income or sales tax. Big deal. Don&apos;t forget health care costs 3x more there, and the schools spend more per child but don&apos;t perform as well.

They&apos;re starting to experience a&quot;brain drain&quot;of a different sort - the kids can&apos;t afford to move back!

Bottom line, there are far worse places to live. No matter where you are, they get you somewhere. Maybe it takes living in a&quot;no taxes&quot;state to realize that.

Now I realize our tax burden is high, but I don&apos;t think it accounts for the big picture. They also pay for more. For example, my colleague from California says he&apos;s amazed at how much more the gov&apos;t actually does here, and so paying a little more doesn&apos;t seem to phase him. Yeah, there&apos;s waste. There is everywhere. Maybe it&apos;s a little worse here. But I also just see this tax argument as another piece of the Buffalo inferiority complex - something to always come back to to make excuses. At least we have the honesty around here to call our taxes&quot;taxes&quot;, so we don&apos;t try to look pretty on some tax burden ranking like NH does.

At least we don&apos;t have property values and property taxes increasing the cost of groceries 10% on average - stores gotta pass that on somehow. WIGS November 27th, 2005, 01:53 AM WIGS, now...

BuffCity if you were living in the Niagara Region, Ontario
making $47,000 CDN/year (40k US):

your income total (provincial and federal) tax would be: 29-30%!
and yes property taxes would be around $2000/year for an equivalent valued house, there still is school taxes (choose public or catholic (parochial are not private anymore), and Ministry of Transportation of Ontario(read: DMV) fees

As for more people working, Buffalo-Niagara MSA has a lower unemployment rate than Ontario&apos;s Niagara Region (currently a low 4.5% versus 7 something %).
and our healthcare system is ok, but it still has flaws, and you still need a health care plan to pay for prescriptions, optometry visits, chiropractic and dental unless you want to pay out of pocket. yikes!

Sounds like you still live with mommy and daddy if you are worried about a $50.00 per year fee on the car. Try living down south where the personal property tax on a car can be $1,000 per year every single year. This is in addition to the annual registration fee and sales tax that you pay when you buy the car. And factor in too that in most States you pay the full sales tax on all purchases INCLUDING food. And don&apos;t forget if you live in NY you pay less in Federal Income tax because your State Income and Property taxes are fully deductible at the federal level.

Napa adds to renewal of Michigan- Genesee area
Auto parts retailer in ex-Anthone store

By SHARON LINSTEDT
News Staff Reporter
12/2/2005

A long-idle retail storefront at the corner of Michigan Avenue and Genesee Street downtown has come back to life as a Napa Auto Parts store, joining a growing list of fresh investment in that neighborhood.
&quot;It&apos;s a prime location with lots of potential customers,&quot;said Dave Jemiolo, manager of the company-owned Napa store that debuted this week.&quot;Our corporate people looked at several locations downtown and took into account the redevelopment that is happening and how everything is moving upward.&quot;

The new Napa store, the company&apos;s third Buffalo location, fills space vacated in 1993 by Anthone Furniture, which had occupied the building for 74 years. The site was briefly used as a nightclub, but has sat boarded up most of the past decade.

Jemiolo said the turn-of-the-century building&apos;s unique characteristics, including interior support pillars, required a one-of-a-kind store layout.

&quot;Napa stores are pretty much cookie cutter with everything predetermined, but this was the exact opposite. Everything had to be customized to fit into the space and around the pillars. It gives it a lot of character and a nostalgic feel,&quot;he said.

Another non-standard touch is the exterior wall mural that rises above the store on the adjoining building. Napa hired local artist Blair Rusin to come up with a 1930s scene of a bustling downtown Buffalo to give the site additional flair.

&quot;It shows Buffalo at the height of greatness, lots of activity. Hopefully that&apos;s where things are headed again,&quot;Jemiolo said. elmwood December 2nd, 2005, 03:50 PM Highly doubtful about beginning construction soon. They&apos;ll need to get approvals from the town and it is a class I environmental project- meaning full blown EIR.

Even then, it&apos;s still going to look awful compared to new Wal-Mart stores elsewhere in the country. Despite it&apos;s upscale image, Amherst doesn&apos;t have any commercial architectural regulations. Wal-Mart is getting better about adapting their designs to meet architectural regulations and the preferences of community leaders, but if nobody asks for it, they&apos;ll build a standard grey bunker. Witness the new Lowe&apos;s stores in Amherst; they&apos;re unmodified corporate prototypes.

Anyways, I don&apos;t think it really matters, I don&apos;t think. It&apos;s just a prettier facade on the same ugly capitalism-gone-awry. We can either be&quot;behind&quot;or&quot;fake&quot;. Take your choice, it&apos;s the same result in the end.

And I think you&apos;re getting a little too negative (again) when you say&quot;the rest of the country&quot;gets the prettier ones. Of all the places I&apos;ve ever been, I&apos;ve only seen stores in a handful of locations that actually conform to some form of architectural standard. No fewer around here.

I keep saying it and nobody listens. Be thankful that we are&quot;behind&quot;in retail development vs&quot;the rest of the country&quot;, if it is true. 20 years from now you&apos;ll be begging to have it back. My colleague who moved here from California is amazed by the amount of locally owned stores and restaurants we&apos;ve managed to hang onto. He said where he&apos;s from, you can&apos;t avoid the big names and big boxes no matter how hard you try.

So if we&apos;re really behind, I say good. I hope it stays that way. I&apos;d rather be steps behind as opposed to selling out to corporate America. I&apos;ll keep shopping at Valu and Vidler&apos;s, you can shop at Lowes and Walmart. Call me old fashioned, call me behind the times. But as I see it,&quot;the rest of America&quot;seems to be desparately trying to recapture things we never lost. And they&apos;ll never be able to do it. And God bless them too.

Anybody got the details on this yet?

Bridge design selected
By PATRICK LAKAMP
News Staff Reporter
12/2/2005

FORT ERIE, Ont. - A design jury Thursday recommended what it called a&quot;simple and elegant&quot;look for a companion span to the Peace Bridge.

Those on the 32-member binational jury picked - by a wide margin - a two-tower concept suggested by Swiss designer Christian Menn.

&quot;This is a simple and elegant landmark framing the Niagara River,&quot;Robert G. Shibley, co-chairman of the jury, said of the design.

Two needle-shaped towers would straddle the roadway, supporting a main span almost one-third of a mile long.

One tower would be on the western shore in Fort Erie and the other on the west side of the Black Rock Channel.

Both towers would be 568 feet above water, taller than the Washington Monument.

&quot;Even though this was the tallest of the bridges being considered, it ends up being the most open, the most transparent,&quot;said juror Lawlor F. Quinlan III, a Buffalo lawyer.&quot;It&apos;s an elegant bridge that has a wispy effect. It narrows at the top to a point where it almost disappears into the sky.

&quot;That&apos;s why I didn&apos;t think the height was too overpowering.&quot;

The Menn design can be built as a three-, four- or even five-lane bridge. But once it&apos;s built, it cannot be expanded, said juror Dominic J. Bonifacio, a Common Council member representing the Niagara District.

The jury offered no recommendation on how many lanes the bridge should carry.

Civic juror Jeff Belt, a Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy board member who has been active on the Peace Bridge issue since 1999, said his position on companion versus replacement concepts has been ambivalent over the years.

&quot;The only thing I have stressed is, if we keep the old bridge up, it shouldn&apos;t obscure the new bridge,&quot;Belt said.&quot;And the new bridge shouldn&apos;t obscure the old bridge. And this Christian Menn design is very complementary. When you look at the two bridges side by side, neither bridge obscures the other.

&quot;The lower structure arches of the old bridge are still beautiful, and they attract your attention. But the slender, tall towers of the new bridge look modern, state-of-the-art and create a great gateway. So I&apos;m very satisfied.&quot;

In the final vote, jurors voted, 22-5, for the Menn concept over a two-tower, cable-stayed concept jointly developed by Modjeski&amp;Masters of Poughkeepsie and Buckland&amp;Taylor of North Vancouver, British Columbia.

In an earlier round of voting, jurors eliminated three concepts developed by Figg Engineering Group of Tallahassee, Fla.: an arch design; a two-tower, cable-stayed concept; and a three-tower, cable-stayed design. Menn&apos;s three-tower, cable-stayed design was also eliminated.

&quot;The consensus on the three-tower [design] was that it was too busy; it obstructed the view,&quot;Shibley said.

Figg&apos;s arch design placed a distant third place to the pair of two-tower, cable-stayed designs that emerged as the finalists.

Computer simulations allowed jurors to view the bridge design alternatives from a distance, from both sides of the border, and also up close as if driving across the bridge.

Ted Ogilvie, a Fort Erie chiropractor, said that he was initially impressed by the arch design but that he changed his mind after seeing the computer simulations.&quot;I saw McDonald&apos;s arches,&quot;Ogilvie said, a reference to the fast-food restaurant&apos;s Golden Arches.&quot;Then a number of different things came up. It overpowers the old bridge. In the end, everybody saw that.&quot;

The jurors met for the last time Thursday in the Holiday Inn in Fort Erie. Among their recommendations:

The new span should not be curved.

The lines of the towers should be softened.

Traffic railings should be transparent - not like concrete barriers - to enhance the pedestrian and driving experience across the span.

Security considerations should be incorporated from the start and not compete with the simplicity and elegance of the concept.

One the subject of lanes, jurors said engineers should decide on the number based on traffic-flow projections.&quot;The number of lanes to be built is kind of a traffic engineering question,&quot;Belt said.

&quot;My own opinion is that it&apos;s not really a matter the public needs to debate a great deal, because it really is a matter of technical requirements. If we can resolve the traffic bottleneck [through] shared border management, then the number of lanes we build really becomes much less important.&quot;

Shibley said,&quot;The number of lanes is driven by traffic capacity. Traffic capacity was never our charge; therefore, the number of lanes was never our charge.&quot;

Menn&apos;s winning concept is for three lanes, Shibley said.

It could be built to accommodate up to five lanes if sidewalks are done away with, he said.

Shibley said the bridges would be 80 feet apart, but jurors did not express an opinion about which side of the existing bridge the new bridge should be built.

In the past, Menn has said he envisioned his bridge south of the Peace Bridge, closer to Lake Erie.

The group spearheading the bridge-expansion project - composed of officials from the Peace Bridge Authority, the City of Buffalo and Town of Fort Erie - will make the final decisions on the design. Members of that group have said they expect to follow the jury&apos;s advice.

The jury&apos;s recommendation won quick praise from top political figures.&quot;This is a major step, a huge victory,&quot;Mayor Anthony M. Masiello said.&quot;A Christian Menn bridge gives us the signature gateway that we all want and need.&quot;

&quot;Today, we have confirmed what we have known for a long time,&quot;Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a news release.&quot;Ever since I was first elected senator, the people of Buffalo have been clear that they want a signature bridge. And today, the design jury made it official. A lot of work went into this decision and the jury should be congratulated for their hard work.&quot;

The jury&apos;s recommendations will be included in the draft environmental-impact statement. Those recommendations are expected to carry great weight with the bridge authority. sargeantcm December 2nd, 2005, 06:09 PM ^^ Now let&apos;s just hope we live long enough to actually see the thing. Based on average life expectancy, for me, that&apos;s hopefully sometime in the next 50-60 years...

The more I think of it, I&apos;m kind of glad they&apos;re keeping the old bridge, however I would imagine the costs of rehabbing it will probably be somewhat steep. Of course, the initial costs of building the replacement would probably more than offset them. I&apos;m not a huge fan of the truss portion, but the arched part is pretty graceful.

I like the idea of having it south of the old bridge as well. That way, it&apos;s a gateway both symbolically and physically. Placed to the north, it&apos;s just more of an exitway. Jerome December 2nd, 2005, 06:32 PM Even then, it&apos;s still going to look awful compared to new Wal-Mart stores elsewhere in the country. Despite it&apos;s upscale image, Amherst doesn&apos;t have any commercial architectural regulations. Wal-Mart is getting better about adapting their designs to meet architectural regulations and the preferences of community leaders, but if nobody asks for it, they&apos;ll build a standard grey bunker. Witness the new Lowe&apos;s stores in Amherst; they&apos;re unmodified corporate prototypes.

Actually the top photo looks much more appealing for a home improvement store. The bottom photo looks just like a rip off of the faux&quot;Wright&quot;Tops in East Aurora. bjfan82 December 2nd, 2005, 07:16 PM This was in the Buffalo News a while back, the Wal Mart spokesman quoted in the article said that this was only a backup in case the new Lockport Store 5 miles away falls through. The spokesman insisted that both stores will not be built as their local trade area (i.e.Pendleton) overlaps. The Lockport Project is coming back to the Lockport Planning Board in December with a new site plan and a revised EIS.

In that same article they did say that Wal Mart wanted to build somewhere on Sheridan west of NF Blvd within the next 2-3 years.

That is not the same Walmart as I posted about. This Amherst Walmart inbetween New/Millersport and Smith/Millersport is going to happen and is not a back up to anything. They are shooting to start construction by spring. And this one has not been in the media yet, it is still supposed to be secret. Oops.

It would be stupid to build another Walmart near Sheridan/NFBlvd because there is one already 4 or 5 blocks up NF Blvd. bjfan82 December 2nd, 2005, 07:23 PM Wal-Mart is getting better about adapting their designs to meet architectural regulations and the preferences of community leaders, but if nobody asks for it, they&apos;ll build a standard grey bunker.

I think your mostly right. But I think it has more to do with city/town codes than just what you ask for. When I lived in Huntington Beach, CA there is a city code that every new building has to have a facade that fits in with the style of the community and has to have pretty little designs on it. And the new Lowes they opened had people painted on it that looked like they were real people painting it standing on ladders...along with all kinds of other little designs carved into it. NYC007 December 2nd, 2005, 10:36 PM Although I don&apos;t really want to get too involved in the debate about suburban strip-mall architecture, I do think that it&apos;s interesting to note that the Walgreens Pharmacy on Delaware Ave and North St was required to work with the Preservation Board and have their contruction plans revised and approved before they could build in the historic Allentown neighborhood. And although this type of building is still ugly, it could have been much much worse. So I do think that the city can get involved with steering the way this type of development takes place, and I think it&apos;s inevitable that there will be more of this now that Buffalo is experiencing a comeback and national chains are moving in.

IMO, we should take a lesson from our big neighbor to the North, Toronto. I was there last night for the Depeche Mode concert, and I couldn&apos;t help but notice again how little effort has been used to retain historical elements in the downtown core. It&apos;s true that Toronto has height and density that Buffalo will never have, or even come close to. But for all of its size, it&apos;s really not a very inspiring skyline. Just my opinion, so don&apos;t anyone start fighting me on this, OK? There are so many nameless faceless boring and, yes, ugly buildings (Toronto City Hall being one of the ugliest). It looks like a giant water tank or oil drum when you come up to it from behind, but at least there was some kind of&quot;design&quot;to it--even if it&apos;s not good design. So many of the other office buildings are just forgettable. And the stores and restaurants that are at the bases of these buildings are equally undistinctive, KFC, Tim Hortons, Sears, etc. I don&apos;t think this is what we want for Buffalo, so would be cautious about using Toronto as a model for growth.

PS- I didn&apos;t even start to mention the vast sea of chains (Ikea, Future Shop, The Bay, Leons, etc) that is the QEW from Niagara Falls north to Toronto. Talk about an ugly ride through suburban sprawl. God, it&apos;s just snore pie with yawn sauce!

This is true, At the time that Walgreens was built it was the most money the company had spent on any store in the companys 100 year existence. Compared to the store on Deleware and West Gerard, or on Sheridan and Millersport the thing is a masterpiece. The Deleware and North store has a Clock tower (sort of) and a brick wall surrounding the parking lot. The store on Hertel and Parkside looks okay on the street as well, It has the large sloping copper roof. It looks a hell of alot better then Kostas anyway. steel December 2nd, 2005, 11:57 PM Stock prototype Lowe&apos;s - what Amherst got

Come on Cyb.. You have got to be kidding me. The first one is bad. The second one is beyond bad! Actually its a joke! BuffaloKid290 December 3rd, 2005, 01:20 AM wow that is an ugly bridge.....its&quot;moderness&quot;really contrasts the Peace bridge&apos;s&quot;iron clad&quot;look....and IMO (in my opinion), i really dont want to say that the tallest structure in Buffalo is a freakin bridge..... :bash: sargeantcm December 3rd, 2005, 03:59 AM wow that is an ugly bridge.....its&quot;moderness&quot;really contrasts the Peace bridge&apos;s&quot;iron clad&quot;look....and IMO (in my opinion), i really dont want to say that the tallest structure in Buffalo is a freakin bridge..... :bash:

Find one of those pictures (drawings) of NYC around the time when the Brooklyn Bridge was built. At the time, it appears to have been far and away the tallest structure in the city. And it may have been a bit of an eyesore, but I think probably more awe-inspiring at the time. Heck, people thought (and still do) that the Empire State Building was an eyesore as well. I&apos;m not trying to imply Buffalo&apos;s skyline will explode like NYC&apos;s did shortly thereafter, I&apos;m just noting that there is a precedent.

I personally like the bridge - I thought cable-stays were ugly at first but now I love them. Of course the only one I&apos;ve actually seen or been on so far is the one in Delaware over the Chesapeake&amp;Delaware Canal. I think it would be a great addition, to the region, and it&apos;s not like it&apos;s going to really compete with the skyline, it&apos;s detached enough. ExWNY&apos;er December 3rd, 2005, 04:33 AM The SF streetcar plan also makes for a hella slow commute. I used to drive from the Sunset to Walnut Creek in less time (granted at 5 AM) than it took me to take the L from the Sunset (39th/Ulloa) to Montgomery.

But I did like not having to transfer, a bus first, then the subway...

Yeah, you get stuck behind those buses or street cars and it is awful. I never drive on Market. It is kind of nice now that they have the light rail to Fisherman&apos;s wharf to the new ballpark and the train runs down the middle of the Embarcadero so there is zzero interference with traffic. I work in Emeryville and have a great commute- I zip over the Bay Bridge and it&apos;s about 15 minutes. The winter rains have started and the commutes are awful now, though. I&apos;d take driving in the snow in Buffalo over driving with the morons out here in the rain.

I like the bridge. I would be pleased if it were built. But I&apos;ll believe it when I drive over it on the way to the Bass Pro store near the Adelphia communications center that is close to the amusement park near the casino. So you probably don&apos;t have to worry much. bjfan82 December 3rd, 2005, 05:54 AM is that bridge really taller than the HSBC building? sargeantcm December 3rd, 2005, 02:04 PM The towers for that design are 568 ft, HSBC is 529 ft. Granted the datum elevation is different for each, but I doubt that the sill of HSBC is 40&apos; above the lake surface. By comparison, the Corning Tower in Albany is 589&apos;. Damn. I say add 25&apos; to the towers! lol

Anybody have info on some other bridges? How tall is the Golden Gate? Brooklyn? Verrazano-Narrows? etc...

Either way, it&apos;s only half as tall as the new Millau viaduct in France!

Actually the one they are talking about on Sheridan will be 1) Asupercenter, the one on NFB is not and 2)in Tonawanda closer to Delaware Ave.

and 3) Yes it was the one on Millersport that the company referred to as a backup for the Lockport project, of course it is there perogative to build both if they wish. But no way will there be construction started in 2006 regardless of what the Company may wish. No Wal Mart gets built in this day and age without a full EIS and a anti Wal Mart lawsuit.

Just an FYI HSBC Center is 569 feet tall from the HSBC Arena side of the building and 529 feet on the upper main street side of the building, it&apos;s built somewhat into a hill, thats why the LRRT goes down hill under as you head to HSBC Arena sargeantcm December 3rd, 2005, 05:10 PM ^^ There&apos;s really a 40&apos; drop across the building? I guess it never looked that big to me. But if that&apos;s so, then HSBC would technically still be taller over the lake surface than the bridge...

I wonder if that was a consideration in the 568&apos; pier height of the bridge? Jerome December 3rd, 2005, 06:32 PM ^^ There&apos;s really a 40&apos; drop across the building?

The World Almanac used to give both heights and listed the building as 40 stories tall, now for some reason they only list the upper main street height and list the building at 38 stories. Go figure. They used to also list a buildings height with and without any beacons or antennas. Jerome December 3rd, 2005, 07:01 PM Great two page article by Mike Vogel on page H1 and H2 of tomorrows Buffalo News titled Change on the Horizon. The article goes into great detail on 16 major projects scheduled for construction or completion during 2007. They are:
1.Erie Canal harbor
2. Medical campus
3.Peace Bridge expansion
4. Bass Pro
5. Buffalo Casino
6. Outer harbor $350 million development
7. Southtowns connector
8. Federal courthouse
9. HealthNow headquarters
10. Darwin Martin House
11. Tropical rain forest at the Buffalo Zoo
12. Niagara River Greenway
13. Waterfront village development incl. 14 story condo
14 ECC downtown expansion
15. Michigan Avenue cultural/historic park
16. H.H. Richardson complex renovation/restoration.

I was really taken with the upbeat tone of the article especially this part near the end.

As patterns go, this ones pretty impressive. The confluence of deadlines and milestones in 2007 wasnt planned. It just happened. But it does parallel a recent growth in development energy that already has converted a number of downtown commercial buildings into new upscale residences, turned once-seedy sections of the city limits into vibrant entertainment districts and sown the beginnings of public access and public amenity improvements on the waterfront.

Right after the looming year of cranes and shovels, which will mark the 175th anniversary of the incorporation of the city in 1832, this city face another milestone year. 2008 is the 250th anniversary of the first settlement in what now is Buffalo..As Buffalo turns 250, it should have a pretty good idea whether its dreams will soar or splat.

Could it be that the Buffalo News finally gets it? ProudBuffalonian December 3rd, 2005, 11:55 PM What&apos;s the southtowns connecter? sargeantcm December 4th, 2005, 12:52 AM ^^One of NYSDOT&apos;s front-burner projects to address accessibility to the city and northern suburbs from the Southtowns, as well as access to vacant brownfields lands in the waterfront area. Basically, I think they&apos;re looking at a 4-lane or so arterial roadway between Rte 5 near Tifft St and then connecting to I-190 at a rebuilt interchange near Seneca St - an area which is currently, for all practical purposes, an access black hole. IMO something to improve access here is critical to waterfront development, and I believe that&apos;s the opinion of the waterfront developement corp as well.

Essentially, its one of many area projects that has been studied to death, but is finally looking like it&apos;s going to happen.

Mr Expert if it wasn&apos;t for the suburbs there would be no growth whatsoever in WNY.

Yeah, their commercial monopoly hasn&apos;t gotten that advanced yet. I would venture a guess that it&apos;ll be at least, and I say at least, 2-5 years before Walmart starts trying to subvert the real estate market. So let&apos;s hold off on that talk until then. steel December 4th, 2005, 08:01 PM Mr Expert if it wasn&apos;t for the suburbs there would be no growth whatsoever in WNY.

I don&apos;t care were in WNY the development is...city or sububurb...If it is the lame kind of development you guys are getting excited about that bores the crap out of me. Suburban Staples stores are boring...you are embarasing your city by making them seem like a big deal. There is nothing interesting about strip malls, parking lots, and where is the new Applebees going to be.

I will say it again. If there is a quality building being put up or planned in the burbs I will praise it to the heavens...But puhleeeeeeease...Talk of which Lowes design you are getting in Amherst or if Dave and Busters is upscale is Boooooooooooooooooooooooooring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

By the way there is currently NO growth in WNY only shifting population and business from one place to another. So all that supposed&quot;growth&quot;in Amherst amd Clerance is at the expense of other places in WNY. bjfan82 December 4th, 2005, 08:46 PM ^ you&apos;re right about Staples...i don&apos;t think it is a big deal if they or Costco are opening in Buffalo.

Giambra, ECC OK building downtown

By STEPHEN T. WATSON
News Staff Reporter
12/3/2005

Erie Community College would construct a new academic building and a parking ramp near its downtown City Campus under an agreement reached between Erie County Executive Joel A. Giambra and college representatives.

http://img202.imageshack.us/img202/8074/1203eccmap2qj.jpg

The buildings are the first piece of a broad educational plan that is intended to boost ECC&apos;s academic efforts while shifting programs and students to an enhanced City Campus.

Officials from the county and the college now will work on the key question of how to finance the estimated $45 million cost of the two structures, with borrowing a likely element.

&quot;We can&apos;t afford not to do it. To me, this is going to be one of the major elements of the rebirth of the central business district,&quot;said Giambra, who agreed to support the construction at a meeting with ECC trustees Raymond F. Gallagher and Nancy A. Gaglione.


Design work to begin

Cannon Design, a Grand Island architectural firm, will begin design work on the two new structures. Construction could begin next fall and be completed in fall 2008.

That construction does not include new buildings that ECC wants on its two suburban campuses. Giambra continues to oppose that work.

This week&apos;s meeting followed months of often contentious debate between county and ECC officials over the college&apos;s future direction.

ECC trustees in October approved a $119 million master plan, with the bulk of the construction directed downtown but new buildings slated for the North and South campuses.

The college needs the support of Giambra and the County Legislature for the project. So trustees set up a meeting this week with the county executive and Legislature Majority Leader Lynn M. Marinelli, who could not attend.

As outlined in the college&apos;s master plan, ECC would build a seven-story, 316,000-square-foot academic building at the site of the Great Lakes Collection Bureau building, bounded by Oak and Elm streets and North Division and South Division streets.


Site is proposed

The county would tear down the existing building, which it bought for $3.1 million in 2002.

The building may not end up being seven stories tall, said Andrew M. Eszak, county commissioner of environment and planning, so the cost may end up being less than the estimated $30 million.

The master plan called for a total of $59.8 million in new academic construction downtown, and more may be built in partnership with other academic institutions, officials said.

ECC needs new academic space downtown because it is planning to move its allied health, culinary arts and some other academic programs from its suburban campuses. The current City Campus, in the ornate Old Post Office, will become ECC&apos;s administrative headquarters.

This influx of several hundred more students, faculty and staff downtown will drive the need for more parking for the college, which currently rents spaces in several surface lots.

The parking ramp, with space for 800 cars, would be built at one of two sites: the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority bus loop, bounded by Ellicott and Oak streets and Eagle and North Division streets; or the Great Lakes Collection parking lot, bounded by Oak and Elm streets and Eagle and North Division streets.

On its ground floor, the ramp would have space for retail stores, perhaps even a student bookstore, and for a Metro Bus terminal. The college&apos;s master plan calls for a five-story structure, and Eszak said the price tag could be $15 million.

Financing for the project is uncertain. Some county legislators have questioned whether the county can afford to borrow money for new ECC projects.

Typically, a community college&apos;s host county picks up half the cost of borrowing for a project and the state Dormitory Authority finances the rest.


Creative ways to pay

But Giambra said he believes that the county or college can find creative ways to pay for the construction, including sharing the facilities with partners such as other academic institutions.

For the suburban campuses, Giambra supports spending $1 million each year on badly needed renovations, but has not committed to the new construction desired by ECC officials.

Giambra vowed to maintain county funding for ECC at its current level, $15.4 million. But he did not indicate how he would find the money to do that.

A Zagat-rated restaurant that boasts of being one of the best in Cleveland, Hyde Park is growing briskly enough that it has needed to look beyond its home market.

The company has eight steak houses in central and northeastern Ohio and plans to open two new locations a year. Hauck said the company also is exploring Buffalo, N.Y., for a new restaurant.

Two factors are helping to lure Hyde Park to Pittsburgh&apos;s North Shore: a white-collar clientele beginning to populate the Equitable building and the nearby regional headquarters of Del Monte, as well as what Hauck described as the region&apos;s lack of quality steak restaurants

Effective Dec. 1, the new RSA Solutions Inc. will focus on the analytics and relationship selling side, including mortgage and home equity programs for banks and mortgage companies, as well as the direct broker operations through its subsidiary RSA Mortgage Solutions Inc.

The automotive side of the business will be known as Fiserv Automotive Solutions Inc. and was created by merging RSA&apos;s automotive division with Fiserv LeMans of King of Prussia, Pa. Both are divisions of Fiserv Lending Solutions.

&quot;There will be a drive to grow both businesses,&quot;said Andrew Shaevel, who will continue as president and CEO of RSA Solutions.&quot;Clearly, we&apos;re looking to grow both businesses. We see this as a chance to kick back up into a strong gear.&quot;

Co-CEO Stuart Angert will now serve as president of RSA Automotive Solutions with Kevin Collins serving as CEO. Collins, who was president and CEO at Fiserv LeMans, will run the King of Prussia operation.

Employees from both groups will continue to work side by side from the Williamsville site as they have been, with 170 dedicated to automotive and 150 on the analytics side. The King of Prussia site has 150 employees working on the automotive side. Shaevel said the Amherst site will&quot;definitely&quot;see expanded employment as the business grows. donbuy December 5th, 2005, 10:20 PM The Mentholatum Company, Inc. has completed its second significant purchase in the skin-care industry in the past year.

The Orchard Park-based manufacturer announced Monday it has bought the Phisoderm brand from Chattem Inc. (NASDAQ: CHTT). The transaction, which was finalized Nov. 30, is valued at $9.6 million.

Mentholatum, will manufacture Phisoderm products at the Orchard Park facility, officials said. In the last six months Mentholatum has poured more than $1 million for capital improvements into the operation following the December 2004 acquisition of the OXY product line from GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK).

Mentholatum employs 225 workers in Orchard Park, up from 205 a year ago, and more than 1,500 worldwide. donbuy December 5th, 2005, 10:21 PM Representatives from the Seneca Nation, along with some Buffalo officials, will be gathering Thursday morning to have a&quot;ceremonial&quot;ground breaking on a third Western New York casino.

NYC007 December 6th, 2005, 04:42 PM ^^^That&apos;s tremendous news. Is the hotel going to be on the 9-acre site near the Elk Terminal Lofts, where they&apos;re demolishing the grain elevator? I&apos;m really hoping that they give up on the DL&amp;W Terminal and focus on one option. It really bothers me that they seem to be dragging their feet, and then doing only a&quot;ceremonial&quot;groundbreaking one day before they are required to break ground. Then if things work out at the other location, then the original groundbreaking ceremony will have meant nothing. IMO the South Park, 9-acre site is great because it is so deserted now, that anyting would be an improvement. You can&apos;t say that about the DL&amp;W, where other types of development could be implemented if the Cobblestone District takes off, as expected. It sort of reminds me of the South Street Seaport in NYC (lower Manhattan). bjfan82 December 6th, 2005, 04:42 PM And just a note about the new Amherst Wal-Mart...I talked to the developer today and he said it is not the&quot;back up&quot;or&quot;fall back&quot;plan for the relocating Lockport Supercenter. Both the new one on Millersport and the relocating one to Transit Rd will co-exist. So I just wanted to put the&quot;back up&quot;myth to end. Now we never have to talk about Wal-Mart again. sargeantcm December 6th, 2005, 04:47 PM I&apos;m still not sold that the casino is a good idea, but like it was mentioned, that area can&apos;t really get much worse; anything is an improvement I suppose. I drive right by that site every afternoon, so it&apos;ll be interesting to see how things progress. I think it would be better to push the casino away from DL&amp;W as well for the reason that if all this riverfront development is going to start happening, I&apos;d just assume the casino to be a&quot;safe distance&quot;away. Not exactly the greatest&quot;family&quot;environment, so to speak.

I totally respect your opinion and I share it to some extent. But just seeing how that neighborhood is going to change around it is going to be awesome. Nine acres of abandoned/boarded up buildings will be gone and a 12+ story casino hotel will be there.

And within a couple years of the casino opening (maybe even before it), if the Senecas land a deal for the DL&amp;W Terminal (for shops or restaurants), they are going to extend the metro rail along South Park another couple blocks so that the train can drop you off right at the front door to the casino!

50-year Power Authority deal nearly triples original offer

By JERRY ZREMSKI
News Washington Bureau
12/6/2005

WASHINGTON The Erie County waterfront will get $279 million over 50 years - nearly three times the original offer under a deal that local officials struck Monday with the New York Power Authority over the relicensing of the Niagara Power Project.
While the deal commits $5.5 million a year for 50 years to waterfront development efforts in the county, upwards of $65 million of that money could come as soon as 2006 to the new corporation charged with remaking Buffalo&apos;s waterfront, Erie County Executive Joel A. Giambra said.

That&apos;s because parties to the talks agreed to Giambra&apos;s proposal for the $3.5 million that is annually targeted to the waterfront corporation to go to the county first. The county will sell bonds that will bring up to $65 million to the waterfront corporation and repay the bonds with the annual settlement payments from the state.

Meanwhile, $2 million a year would be set aside for a greenway along the Niagara River and Lake Erie.

The deal also includes $4 million upfront for an Erie Canal museum and calls for the Power Authority to give up 13 acres of prime land on the outer harbor where it now stores the Niagara River ice boom.

Sources said Power Authority officials signed off on the deal Monday after Giambra and Buffalo Mayor Anthony M. Masiello agreed to it.

Asked to comment, Rep. Brian M. Higgins who had been seeking $10 million a year from the Power Authority said the package will provide a major boost to development efforts.

&quot;It gives us a fighting chance to address a problem we haven&apos;t addressed in 40 years: the redevelopment of the Buffalo waterfront,&quot;said Higgins, D-Buffalo.&quot;This is a new day. It represents a significant move forward.&quot;

Rep. Louise M. Slaughter, who helped bring the Power Authority back to the table after it made a take-it-or-leave-it $2 million-a-year offer, agreed.&quot;It sounds like a good settlement, and I&apos;m proud to be a part of it,&quot;said Slaughter, D-Fairport.&quot;It&apos;s so much more than we started with.&quot;

Sources said Gov. George E. Pataki also played a key role by getting Empire State Development Corp. to contribute $1 million a year to the package.

&quot;I&apos;m pleased that we&apos;ve reached an agreement,&quot;Pataki said.&quot;I think it helps the Western New York economy and significantly helps the waterfront development corporation.&quot;

Some $4.5 million a year will come from the Power Authority, and some of that money will come from the sale of cheap hydropower at market rates.

The huge profits from those sales, along with the Empire State Development contribution, will mean the deal won&apos;t prompt dramatic power rate increases for the Power Authority&apos;s industrial customers, sources said. Those companies employ 43,000 in the region.

Because the deal is tied to the sale of power and because electricity costs are expected to escalate dramatically over the next 50 years the deal eventually could be worth more than $279 million.

&quot;This is a win for everyone,&quot;said Assembly Majority Leader Paul Tokasz, D-Cheektowaga, who closely followed the talks between the Power Authority and the local officials.

But the biggest winner of all will be the Erie Canal Harbor Development Corp., which will manage redevelopment of Buffalo&apos;s inner and outer harbors.

Combined with the $22.3 million included in a recent federal highway bill for Buffalo-area projects, the Power Authority settlement will set real money aside for waterfront access projects and other efforts in the next few years, Higgins said.

Key to that plan is Giambra&apos;s proposal to accelerate payments to the corporation through the bond sale.&quot;This puts ready cash into the hands of the corporation,&quot;Giambra said.

Masiello agreed that the settlement should lead to relatively quick change along a waterfront that has remained largely dormant for years.&quot;There can be no more excuses that the money isn&apos;t there,&quot;Masiello said.

The money for the waterfront corporation comes on top of the Power Authority&apos;s original offer of $2 million a year for the Erie County portion of a 40-mile greenway along Lakes Ontario and Erie and the Niagara River.

Mark Zito, who helped broker a $694.2 million settlement for the seven&quot;host communities&quot;in Niagara County most affected by the power plant, said the greenway will make America&apos;s Niagara River waterfront as scenic as the one in Canada.

&quot;This is just a great thing for Western New York,&quot;Zito said.&quot;It gives us a way to focus on environmental tourism, along with giving local residents access to green space.&quot;

Masiello said the local officials were able to strike the deal because they refused to give in to the Power Authority&apos;s original offer and because politicians at every level of government pressed for a better settlement.

&quot;Brian Higgins was instrumental in keeping the issue alive,&quot;Masiello said.

Some Niagara County communities and school districts are still looking for bigger settlements. But officials said Monday&apos;s deal was a key moment in getting federal approval for a new license for the huge hydro plant, which produces 10 percent of the state&apos;s electricity. The current federal license expires Aug. 31, 2007.

&quot;It seemed from the outset that everyone could end up happy, and this deal did just that,&quot;said Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y.

This wasn&apos;t from the paper, but rather Buffalowaterfront.com. I though it looked pretty nice, and probably very realistic:
http://www.buffalowaterfront.com/images/2lg.jpg
I&apos;ve changed my mind on the Skyway, I hope it stays, and this photo shows it can fit in. That&apos;s not to say I don&apos;t think I-190 or the access/land use beneath it can&apos;t be massively improved. This particular proposal calls for a&quot;Gateway Bridge&quot;(a lift bridge or a low span?) at the mouth of the Buffalo River, essentially connecting the Erie Basin Marina to the Coast Guard Station.

Personally, I would add another bridge to connect Michigan St over the City Ship Canal to tie up another loose end as far as access is concerned...

Casino&apos;s are a double edged sword. We fought one tooth and nail here in our neck of the woods. Eventually they built it anyway and while its booming in business, the county is still fighting w/ the Pomo&apos;s over this and that. It&apos;s one of those NIMBY type of things...but look at the alternative. You have rusting old grain elevators that are an eyesore (in our case the casino became the eyesore among vineyards). If it brings life to the area, great. Leaving the grain elavators as they are...that does nothing a the city looking to rebound. The elevators are important though...that needs to be realized. bjfan82 December 7th, 2005, 12:36 AM ^ I was reading through a report today, about the Senecas putting a casino at the pier. This is not going to happen, it was just talk back in 2002. But, they wanted to have&quot;aquabuses&quot;going through the buffalo river between the grain elevators. I saw renderings of it, and honestly, it looked cool as hell. Going on a&quot;cruise&quot;down through the canyon of grain elevators was very unique idea, and would really show the history and heritage of Buffalo. BuffaloKid290 December 7th, 2005, 01:17 AM aquabuses? saweet. any renderings of the casino in downtown Buffalo? Jerome December 7th, 2005, 02:35 AM I do, I just told you its going to be 12-15 stories...the plans say&quot;12 story&quot;, but the casino below/around it say&quot;3 story&quot;...so i don&apos;t know if the casino is going to be 12 stories from the ground or 12 stories above the 3 story casino.
Ok, sorry I misunderstood. Sounds like they want the building to be higher than the HSBC Arena so that they can put a sign on it that can be seen from the rest of downtown. bjfan82 December 7th, 2005, 03:17 AM ^ yeah, that is very possibly the case BuffCity December 7th, 2005, 07:55 AM well common sense tells me that if you are going to build a casino, you want it to be an&quot;Intimidating&quot;figure. Look at NF and the Seneca Casino and Hotel there...once they built the Hotel, now the world sees this place everyday, before you had to go find it.

If the Casino does so well in Buffalo that people actually like to go there, look for the Hotel business to boom, perhaps we will see some new chains downtown.

I would like to see some renderings soon.

If Niagara Falls is any indication, the downtown hotel business will not boom. The only hotel built since the casino opened is the Seneca&apos;s. Gamblers from Orchard Park, Springville, and Clarence will not be staying overnight. DowntownBFLO December 7th, 2005, 04:22 PM I&apos;m going to have to agree. As much as I can appreciate people&apos;s optimism regarding the casino, what happened to all of the opposition?--particularly hotel opposition. Wasn&apos;t everybody here talking about how the Senecas wouldn&apos;t be building a hotel with this location? How it was going to be a&quot;stand alone&quot;casino? I recall reading somewhere that the Hyatt was going to be converted/renovated into a four star Marriot if the Senecas did not build a hotel.

Yesterday&apos;s Buffalo News article highlighted opposition of both residences of Elk Terminal who love that they live around historically significant structures, such as the grain elevators, and regretted the fact that the Senecas aren&apos;t taking public opinion into consideration prior to demolishing them. The preservationists are furious, as that particular structure isn&apos;t supposed to be touched. Granted, nothing can be done now because it&apos;s no longer U.S. territory.

I can see both sides of the issue. Sure - it&apos;s great to see new development down there. And if you factor in waterfront redevelopment(big news regarding the NYPA!!!) the cobblestone lofts, the elk terminal expansion, Bass Pro, etc...that area will be drastically changed.

But, I always saw the cobblestone district revival as consisting of old and historically significant structures being renovated into current use. The people who are so opposed to the demolition of the grain elevators/mill feel the same way.

I guess beggers can&apos;t be choosers. Or can they?
What do you guys think? bjfan82 December 7th, 2005, 04:27 PM I&apos;m more or less pleased with the fact that 9 acres of vacant boarded up buildings will be knocked down and covered by something else that is new. The Senecas were originally going to incorporate the H-O Oats building into the parking ramp, but i&apos;m glad they didn&apos;t, it would look even more horrible than it does now, not to mention a safety concern. Jerome December 7th, 2005, 04:34 PM The anti-Casino folks often say that the casino will not be a silver bullet, but I have yet a casino proponent ever say that it is. They always refer to it a a piece of the puzzle and it will be. Picture the throngs of Canadians after a Sabres/Leafs game spilling into our downtown, this gives them another reason to linger. Perhaps they will linger long enough thay some will end up staying the night, increasing hotel occupancy. Then there are the 1,000+ workers. If only 20% end up living downtown that is 200 in new demand for lofts, apartments or condos. This of course will add to the downtown population increasing the need for more retail. And so it goes, and so it grows. sargeantcm December 7th, 2005, 04:54 PM ^^ I think a consolidated downtown ECC would do more for downtown retail than the casino will.

We could then build from there without the negative aspects of the casino.

All I know is, let&apos;s start seeing some dang cranes out on the waterfront. Who cares if the weather there is brutal!

ECoastTransplant December 7th, 2005, 05:06 PM I&apos;m more or less pleased with the fact that 9 acres of vacant boarded up buildings will be knocked down and covered by something else that is new.

Covered by a new parking lot. Now there&apos;s progress. Have the Senecas said what their intentions are for this 9 acres? No. Details are expected later this week. What they publicly said is:&quot;We hope to use the DL&amp;W terminal as the casino site. If we do not, the nine acres will be used for the casino.

Ok, they haven&apos;t made it public yet, but they will. I&apos;ve already stated on here what their intentions are because I&apos;ve seen the plans they are submitting to the city today.

The last part of your statement is incorrect about what they will do with the nine acres. If they get the DL&amp;W terminal, that will be used for restaurants, retail, and/or storage warehouse. They only predict a 5-10% chance of even getting it. So they are just going ahead and building their casino/parking ramp/hotel on the 9 acre site.

I&apos;ve had to go out to the site a number of times over the last couple weeks and whatever they put there is going to be better than what is there now. It will be a good injection of life into that whole section of town. I know that in your eyes there is never a good reason to building a parking ramp, but I&apos;d rather have a 10 story parking ramp than 10 square blocks of surface lots. The only cure for building parking ramps is to get rid of the car, and that isn&apos;t ever going to happen.

But the real bad news is that they will be buying the blocks just east of the site and north and south of Fulton Avenue and knock down those buildings and put in surface lots there to&quot;act as a buffer between the casino and the &apos;projects&apos;&quot; Jerome December 7th, 2005, 06:06 PM &quot;A Buffalo casino would be a&quot;convenience casino,&quot;deriving its revenue almost entirely from local residents.

The Casino will not cause any harm because there is already plenty of gambling opportunities in the area already. Has crime gone up in NF since the Casino opened? No, it has not. The anti Casino argument is not valid because the genie is already out of the bottle. The only way to get rid of the (minor) negative casino consequences would be to close all of the Casino&apos;s on both sides of the border. Reality check says that this will never happen.

Get back to me in a couple years when you think of something.

I&apos;m not talking about gambling being good or bad. I&apos;m talking about the impact on the city&apos;s built environment.

It will bring activity, but it won&apos;t bring life to the area. Cars in and out of a ramp is activity, not life.

Went to the 3 dog night concert memorial day in NF. 10,000+ people that would not have been there if not for the casino, SSplash park reopened, would not have if not for the Casino. The Casino has given life to a dead corpse it is up to other developers not the Seneca&apos;s to take advantage of the traffic coming through town. Don&apos;t blame the Seneca&apos;s if developers like Palidino would rather land bank their property hoping for a bit payoff then actually develope the land. Don&apos;t blame the only developers that are actually developing and bringing jobs toi the area.

By SHARON LINSTEDT and JERRY ZREMSKI
News Staff Reporters
12/7/2005

Walking along the waterfront near Times Beach, Lawrence W. Quinn, the waterfront development corporation&apos;s vice president, says the funds will make possible infrastructure improvements to provide access and attract private development.

About $279 million is headed to Erie County&apos;s long-
neglected waterfront, and planners and politicians say that&apos;s just the beginning.
The hydropower settlement will likely draw huge new private investments to Buffalo&apos;s waterfront, along with more government money, they said.

&quot;This takes us from the dream stage to the reality stage,&quot;said Anthony Gioia, chairman of Erie Canal Harbor Development Corp., which is charged with remaking Buffalo inner and outer harbors.&quot;We can acquire property and make it more attractive for private developers to take over.&quot;

About $65 million of the hydropower money is likely to arrive as soon as next year, meaning work can begin quickly.

&quot;The goal is to leverage many millions more in private investment,&quot;said Lawrence W. Quinn, vice president of the waterfront development corporation.&quot;By funding access and infrastructure, we can open up miles of waterfront for development.&quot;

Quinn, managing partner of the Buffalo Sabres, said the seed money will make a languishing urban shoreline come to life with everything from new beaches to housing and marinas. In addition to millions of dollars in spin-off private investments, thousands of new jobs and millions in property tax revenues are anticipated.

In selecting funding options, the waterfront agency will steer away from projects - road and bridges - that are traditionally the responsibility of the government, Quinn said.

&quot;This money shouldn&apos;t replace existing funding sources. This is money for things that wouldn&apos;t normally be funded but should be,&quot;he said.

But Rep. Brian M. Higgins, D-Buffalo who led the charge to make the waterfront development dollars part of the State Power Authority&apos;s relicensing of the Niagara Power Project said the settlement will act as a magnet for other government money for road improvements.


Immediate impact predicted

Higgins predicted the windfall will have a nearly immediate impact.

&quot;You&apos;re going to see shovels in the ground and a lot of projects happening simultaneously,&quot;Higgins said.&quot;It will fundamentally change the look and feel of the Buffalo waterfront in the next 12 to 18 months.&quot;

Erie County Executive Joel A. Giambra, a party to the agreement along with Buffalo Mayor Anthony M. Masiello, agreed.

&quot;Waterfront development is no longer a dream; it&apos;s a reality. It is no longer about conjecture, it&apos;s about construction,&quot;he said.

Others, however, stressed that long-range planning might be an even more important result of the hydropower settlement.

&quot;What we plan on doing is vetting this through various urban planners, including some of the best in the county, if not the world,&quot;Gioia said.&quot;With their input, we will be able to prioritize what needs to be done.&quot;

Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., also stressed the importance of waterfront planning.

&quot;The first thing they need to do is to take a step back and create a grand vision,&quot;said Schumer, who suggested the creation of a corporation to oversee waterfront development.

Uniland Development Corp. and its partners have proposed a $350 million outer harbor project involving residences, entertainment and recreation areas, and green space.

Schumer, nevertheless, stressed that the waterfront development corporation should also look at alternatives to that plan to make sure that the prime land is being used in the best possible way.

But both Quinn and Higgins said they were not trying to undo the Uniland plan.

Carl Montante Jr., a Uniland executive, welcomed the promise of public seed money to attract more private developers.

&quot;Our waterfront will become a true destination for tourists and residents to the extent that both public and private funding is committed,&quot;Montante said.

The historic settlement still requires approval from the federal government, the Erie County Legislature and the Buffalo Common Council.

But local officials Tuesday rallied around the deal, which calls for $5.5 million a year for Buffalo and Erie County waterfront projects over the next 50 years.

Of that money, $3.5 million per year will be earmarked for the city waterfront, while another $2 million annually will go to the county&apos;s Greenway Fund to aid shoreline recreation and preservation efforts along Lake Erie and the Niagara River.

Preliminary plans call for the county to sell bonds backed by the future-year revenues, making at least $65 million available for development sometime next year.

The settlement also calls for a $4 million upfront payment to fund a planned outdoor interpretive park to tell the story of the Erie Canal&apos;s western terminus along the city&apos;s Inner Harbor. The living history development will be the final phase of the $46.3 million canal recreation project now under way.

In addition, the agreement also calls for the Power Authority to transfer 13 acres of outer harbor land it uses for storing the Niagara River ice boom over to the waterfront development corporation for future use.

Gov. George E. Pataki praised the settlement, saying it fits with the Power Authority&apos;s mission to spur new jobs and businesses in the region.

&quot;I congratulate all the parties who worked tirelessly to reach this settlement, which at times was contentious, but in the end is clearly productive for the people of Erie and Niagara counties,&quot;Pataki said.

Joseph J. Seymour, Power Authority chairman, said he was pleased to have concluded a&quot;well-balanced&quot;agreement that is expected to lead to renewal of the authority&apos;s license.

&quot;We have achieved an agreement with Buffalo and Erie County that will provide New York State a long-term role in helping to develop the Buffalo waterfront, enhance the environmental and recreational greenway along the Niagara River, and allow the (authority) to continue to provide low-cost hydropower to keep and create jobs in Western New York,&quot;Seymour said.


&quot;A once-in-a-lifetime&apos; chance

Sources estimated the deal&apos;s spin-off potential is so great that the final amount invested on the waterfront over the next five decades could range from three to ten times the amount of money involved in the settlement.

&quot;It jump-starts every conceivable waterfront project that has merit, and it&apos;s a list as long as my arm,&quot;said David Colligan, counsel to the Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy, which will benefit from the planned Greenway.&quot;It could change the face of Western New York.&quot;

Higgins agreed.

&quot;This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to make a big difference not only for ourselves, but for generations to come,&quot;he said.&quot;If we do this right, Buffalo will be reborn.&quot; Jerome December 7th, 2005, 07:26 PM And now they&apos;re afraid they&apos;re going to have to close again because of the casino expansion plans...
So what you are saying is they opened the Splash Park because of the Casino thus creating jobs. Now the casino wants this land (as promised) to expand and create even more jobs, and better ones at that, than the splash park created. And this is bad because ????????????? homestar December 7th, 2005, 07:33 PM But the real bad news is that they will be buying the blocks just east of the site and north and south of Fulton Avenue and knock down those buildings and put in surface lots there to&quot;act as a buffer between the casino and the &apos;projects&apos;&quot;

BJ, could you elaborate on that part?

How much additional land are they allowed to purchase? Will it be &apos;indian territory&apos;? Can they used Eminent Domain like in NF? Is there a total acreage promised to them, like in NF?

Thanks. bjfan82 December 7th, 2005, 07:45 PM I&apos;m not sure of the number of acres...i can visualize it on a map, it would be exactly one block to the east of the current 9 acres all the way to Chicago St. The new extra land they are thinking of buying in the near-mid future would be bound by Perry St and South Park Ave (N/S) and Marvin St and Chicago St (E/W). That is what they are seriously considering right now (probably about 85%-90%). No eminent domain would be used, it would be the same scenario as the 9 acres they own now - make an offer to the owner for the land. But that land would be used for surface parking lots. And try to seperate the&quot;projects&quot;from the casino. sargeantcm December 7th, 2005, 07:55 PM So what you are saying is they opened the Splash Park because of the Casino thus creating jobs.

First, I never said the park opened because of the casino. Maybe it did, I don&apos;t know. I&apos;m not the one who initially brought it up, either. I say it&apos;s bad, though, because a waterpark will attract a different crowd than the casino, and quite frankly a better one. It&apos;ll be one less family attraction on the NY side that I&apos;m sure NF Ontario will more than capitalize on. We don&apos;t need NF devolving into some seedy cesspool worse than it is now. Not to mention with Buffalo, we have more than enough casinos in the area.

These jobs they keep speaking of aren&apos;t the best thing either. It&apos;s almost like how Walmart claims they create jobs (without mentioning the strain on healthcare they create). Some great jobs those are, they&apos;ll really keep an economy on its feet.

Let&apos;s also not forget that this casino is nothing more than another black hole Albany is going to use to feed a bloated government. This place is probably more liable to spur further development in Albany than it will in Buffalo.

I don&apos;t know, at first I thought the casino was a good idea, but that&apos;s the best I ever thought of it. I think years from now we&apos;re going to look back at this and find that it was a huge mistake. Fortunately there should be enough good going around elsewhere to more than balance it out. homestar December 7th, 2005, 08:01 PM it would be exactly one block to the east of the current 9 acres all the way to Chicago St. The new extra land they are thinking of buying in the near-mid future would be bound by Perry St and South Park Ave (N/S) and Marvin St and Chicago St (E/W).

Going out to Perry an Chicago would double the land they have now. Doesn&apos;t that land include the Elk Lofts??? bjfan82 December 7th, 2005, 08:05 PM no it does not, because the Elk Lofts are north of Perry, not on the Seneca land which is south of Perry St. And the potential new land East of the casino is a little less than half the size of the 9 acres they have now. So it wouldn&apos;t be doubling it. bjfan82 December 7th, 2005, 08:16 PM For the NF casino, the Senecas are going to acquire the water park land and the pizza hut (i don&apos;t exactly know how yet) and are going to build&quot;family friendly&quot;entertainment stuff there and is going to connect directly to the hotel so that families will be able to go there and do other things than just gamble, and they can bring there kids. NYC007 December 7th, 2005, 08:20 PM Since the casino opened in the Falls, there is a brand new state-of-the-art conference center. Paladino finally started work on the art deco United Building, so there will soon be condos. Third street is being renovated or street scaped. The Holdiay Inn (I think) which was NF&apos;s largest hotel is undergoing a multi-million dollar renovation. Smokin&apos; Joe opened a&quot;Family Fun Center&quot;in the former Rainbow Mall&apos;s atrium. Municipal buildings are finally getting some money thrown their way, and some of the streets are finally getting patched up. I&apos;d say that&apos;s quite impressive progress, considering the casino hasn&apos;t even been open for two years. homestar December 7th, 2005, 08:24 PM no it does not, because the Elk Lofts are north of Perry, not on the Seneca land which is south of Perry St. And the potential new land East of the casino is a little less than half the size of the 9 acres they have now.

It would be like an arcade, or a movie theater, or a pool, or something like that. I think it would take the entire city of niagara falls and tons of private developers to make a clifton hill. And remember, casinos are enclosed and cut off from the rest of the city or street. They are going to mainly be tailoring to the people staying at the hotel and keeping them inside the whole time.

That may not be your cup of tea but just look at the crowds these places draw on the Canadian side and it would sure appear that you are in the minority. These places draw families left and right and create mega numbers of recession proof jobs. Just drive down Lundy&apos;s lane and see for yourself.
So what if they are low paying jobs, getting them in no way precludes also going after high paying, high tech jobs or banking jobs or any other jobs. More is more, growth of all kinds is needed in this area, do not fall into the either or trap. A growing region should produce a healthy number of jobs in all categories. bjfan82 December 7th, 2005, 09:12 PM ^ you are right, but I think what homestar was getting at was that those type of attractions that cheapen the city and make it Disney-like (which can be very corny at times)...but it is a balancing act, the city would love the jobs and money from them but they may not necesarrily want to become cheap and corny.

Splash was built long before the casino. Then it closed. Then it reopened when the State was getting ready to bring eminent domain proceedings against it. You know, an operating park is worth more than a vacant one!

Conference center- all taxpayer money. Third Street streetscape- state money. One hotel renovates? No proof due to the casino. 20 percent hotel occupancy rate during the winter- better than 19 percent without a casino! United Office Building- not started but supposed to go to Paladino for $1. I guess the casino workers need an expensive rental! So there has been a lot of spinoff after all! sargeantcm December 7th, 2005, 10:00 PM ^^ Yeah, I knew Splash was open back in the early 90s, that&apos;s basically the last time I went there.

Yeah. I&apos;m not gonna argue against the crowds on Clifton Hill. I&apos;m sure it&apos;s raking in money. But it&apos;s been done. NF Ontario has staked it&apos;s claim on the obnoxious. I just hope NF NY doesnt&apos; merely copy that, but stakes it&apos;s own claim on something a little more sophisticated. They would stand out more as being an alternative to Ontario instead of just more-of-the-same.

I&apos;m positive there is a big percentage of the visiting tourist population that can only handle so much of Clifton, especially those without kids (like honeymooners!)

I brought some out-of-town friends up there over the summer. They loved the Ontario parks and views of the Falls, but were horrified at the Clifton hill businesses AND the type of crowd it attracted. They wanted to leave immediately and go back to Buffalo.

(they REALLY liked Buffalo BTW. They were in shock at how it was nothing like their negative assumptions before they visited.)

I agree it must be a balancing act but as it stands now almost everyone with out of town company immediately takes them to Canada. The American side is better than pre casino but is still the ugly sister in activity and commerce to Canada. If so many tourists preferred the US side as one blogger wrote there would be a higher hotel occupancy and more development on this side of the border. Obviously the people have spoken with their pocketbooks and their feet and the Canadian side is the clear cut winner....for now at least. bjfan82 December 8th, 2005, 01:19 AM ^i&apos;m not even so much concerned with the fact that there is nothing on the American side to do except a little park.

The federal study looked at price hikes -- but not actual prices -- for 265 metropolitan areas. With a gain of 5.89 percent, Buffalo-Niagara Falls ranked no. 184. On a quarterly basis, local housing prices increased 2.45 percent, near the national average of 2.86 percent.

In upstate New York, the Albany area ranked no. 69 nationally as prices rose 15 percent in the past year. Syracuse placed no. 148 with a 1-year increase of 7.4 percent and Rochester was no. 200 as housing costs were up 5.2 percent from the 2004 third quarter.

Over a five-year period, Buffalo area home prices climbed just under 30 percent, OFHEO reported, while prices went up 68.2 percent for Albany, 37.4 percent for Syracuse, and 23.8 percent for Rochester.

Also, Buffalo now has the fourth-most affordable housing prices in the nation, according to the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Opportunities Index.

The Seneca Nation of Indians may be missing a good bet as it clears land for a Buffalo casino. Tearing down a grain mill for the sake of meeting a deadline unwisely risks losing a piece of waterfront history and a potential casino asset.

This is especially so if the nation&apos;s preferred-site deal works out, as expected, at the DL&amp;W rail terminal nearby. The landmark H-O Oats complex could become another important structure lost for vacant land or a surface parking lot. Having taken ownership of the casino project&apos;s back-up site in the Cobblestone District and made that nine-acre site sovereign territory, the Senecas have the right to determine the eventual fate of its buildings. We would urge them, though, to seek imaginative ways to incorporate historic structures into their plans, not just clear them away.

Adaptive reuse, in fact, is the heart of the Seneca&apos;s plan for an upper-floor casino in the terminal at the foot of Main Street. But the nation&apos;s casino compact with the state requires a groundbreaking by Friday and a&quot;doors-open&quot;deadline of Dec. 9, 2007. With a purchase and lease-back contract to be negotiated with the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority and the difficulty of relocating the second-floor transformers that power Metro Rail, that deal won&apos;t meet the deadline. The alternate site, diagonally across from the train terminal, will meet the requirement. The Senecas remain close-lipped about detailed planning, but their work starts with a bit of demolition at the fire-damaged, vacant and deteriorating mill building on the opposite corner of the site, at Market and Fulton streets.

The key component of the H-O Oats complex, though, is the grain elevator itself, three dozen cylindrical towers melded into a tall structure familiar to anyone who has driven the downtown stretch of the Niagara Thruway. Its iconic form, part of a nationally important collection of grain elevators surviving in Buffalo and helping to define its commercial heritage, effectively shields what could be casino parking from the upscale housing development at the neighboring Elk Terminal. It could also serve as an ideal spot for a casino sign. Thus it deserves imaginative incorporation into this project, not just automatic land-clearing demolition. Jerome December 8th, 2005, 03:36 PM It could also serve as an ideal spot for a casino sign. Thus it deserves imaginative incorporation into this project, not just automatic land-clearing demolition.

Do you really want a couple hundred foot tall billboard on a rotting old silo to be the gateway image of Buffalo as you enter on the 190? There is already such a tacky sign as you drive northbound on the 190 for another Casino please lets not have more. sargeantcm December 8th, 2005, 04:05 PM ^^ I think&quot;imaginative incorporation&quot;would include rehabbing the structure to suit some new purpose.

This city is seriously going to regret this. Albany *ucks us yet again, and this time makes our so-called leaders enjoy it. ECoastTransplant December 8th, 2005, 05:47 PM While a few on here call it GREAT NEWS, here&apos;s the take of a REAL DEVELOPER:

Casino Groundbreaking

The Seneca Nation of Indians is planning to break ground today for their Buffalo casino in the Cobblestone District.

Preservationists and casino opponents are joining forces to stop the casino, and the anticipated demolition of the 1912 H-O Oats mill and grain elevators.

Others are questioning exactly what the Senecas plan to do on the nine acres of Cobblestone District land that is now sovereign territory.

&quot;I just don&apos;t know what their plans are, and I think that in itself is the problem,&quot;said Chris Jacobs, President of Avalon Development.

About one year ago the company bought three vacant warehouses on Mississippi Street. One is being renovated into retail space and condos, the second into retail space, and the third into offices.

Jacobs is against the casino to begin with, and wonders how the facility, traffic and a potential parking garage across the street from the warehouses will affect his project.

&quot;I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s something attractive for someone who wants to buy a loft condo to have a casino at the end of the street and a big parking structure across the street,&quot;Jacobs said, adding that Avalon is committed to the restoration. bjfan82 December 8th, 2005, 06:26 PM The Rich&apos;s Coffee building right next to the Elk Lofts is going to be the next building converted into apts/lofts.

As opposed to a rat infested burned out shell of a crumbling building surrounded by empty lots and blight? Give me the Casino as a neighbor any day, at least then there will be people and traffic around so I can walk outside my condo at night with less fear of a mugging. steel December 8th, 2005, 07:16 PM As opposed to a rat infested burned out shell of a crumbling building surrounded by empty lots and blight?

You have obviously never seen the way they build casinos these days. They will make sure that all the people are inside not on the street. bjfan82 December 8th, 2005, 07:43 PM They are trying to get a an off-ramp of the I-190 built, so that the off ramp enters right into the casino at Chicago Street.

The H-O Oats warehouse was far from crumbling until it took over a dozen hits from the wrecking ball before any of the bricks gave way. I&apos;ll take a crumbling building any day over god knows what the Senecas are going to do with that site.

What I really hope doesn&apos;t happen is the Senecas demolish the H-O site and it ends up as a vacant lot when they make a breakthough in their talk and the casino ends up in the DL&amp;W terminal. sargeantcm December 8th, 2005, 07:48 PM What I really hope doesn&apos;t happen is the Senecas demolish the H-O site and it ends up as a vacant lot when they make a breakthough in their talk and the casino ends up in the DL&amp;W terminal.

You know that will happen, too. With some of this new development, the surface parking equilibrium downtown is being disturbed. Time to create some more, I say.

Either that, or Cheektowaga will win in their appeal to have the casino placed near the airport, which still remains Snyder&apos;s first choice.

They are trying to get a an off-ramp of the I-190 built, so that the off ramp enters right into the casino at Chicago Street.

As if we need more ramps in that low-visibility jersey barrier cluster*uck that already exists in that location. Just what we need. We need that as much as we need a casino for crying out loud! A casino!

How about they demolish those eff&apos;in toll booths as well. And reconstruct some of the downstate ones (Springbrook or something like that) they demolished a few years ago, so that more people actually drive on I-190! It&apos;s not so much the tolls I&apos;m against as just their locationing - they&apos;re easily bypassable by throwing traffic on local roads. Either the Thruway should compensate the city for the increased traffic loads (as state agencies do when they detour traffic onto local roads during construction) or get rid of the damn things. steel December 8th, 2005, 07:55 PM one thing you can make a good bet on is that the architecture of the Casino and parking cgarage are not going to be award winners. sargeantcm December 8th, 2005, 07:59 PM ^^ Like I said before, as long as it&apos;s not some ugly blue sore thumb monstrousity like the one in NFNY, I think we can claim a victory in principle. steel December 8th, 2005, 08:21 PM ^^ Like I said before, as long as it&apos;s not some ugly blue sore thumb monstrousity like the one in NFNY, I think we can claim a victory in principle.

You should be happy if it turns out as&quot;good&quot;as that one. Have you seen the monstrocity casinos built in Detroit?

Uhg is the only thought that comes to mind Jerome December 8th, 2005, 08:23 PM I just got the new plans in from the Senecas, just minutes ago about the casino...there will be a 12-15 story hotel and a 10 story parking ramp starting construction in TWO DAYS!
Announcement made today 100,000 sq ft casino, parking ramp, no hotel, no credibility. ECoastTransplant December 8th, 2005, 08:47 PM The Rich&apos;s Coffee building right next to the Elk Lofts is going to be the next building converted into apts/lofts.

Yepp- Paladino owns that one too....just like the H-O plans for lofts. :bash: ILuvNY December 8th, 2005, 08:57 PM If Paladino sells the Rich&apos;s building off to the Senecas, he&apos;d better hire bodyguards to keep preservationists from going Tony Soprano on him. :guns1: Jerome December 8th, 2005, 09:31 PM Plans were unveiled today for a 60,000 seat NASCAR track to be built in Ft Erie. It will be in the Stevensville area of the Town visible from the center of the Peace Bridge. Financing is already in place. Jerome December 8th, 2005, 09:37 PM According to an interview with Supervisor Demler of Wheatfield the developers have shown him proof that they have obtained $500 million in financing for the proposed Wheatfield Amusement Park. Imagine that a family friendly tourist attraction on this side of the border. ExWNY&apos;er December 8th, 2005, 09:54 PM No hotel is disappointing. Did the Senecas announce plans for a hotel when they announced the NF casino immediately? Perhaps one will come later. I don&apos;t know if they did.
Does anyone have any idea what this thing will look like. I have visions of some horrible, gaudy pre-fab structure. I know we can&apos;t expect an architectural gem, but I hope they do something somewhat tasteful. I won&apos;t hold out hope. Jerome December 8th, 2005, 10:00 PM No hotel is disappointing. Did the Senecas announce plans for a hotel when they announced the NF casino immediately?
Yes, they announced plans for three hotels with a total of 2,000 rooms. As of October 2005 the plan is still to build 2 more hotels. This was reported in the Niagara Sunday Newspaper along with a rendering of all 3 hotels plus the indoor recreation/theater component. It will go on the Splash Park site bjfan82 December 8th, 2005, 10:10 PM Announcement made today 100,000 sq ft casino, parking ramp, no hotel, no credibility. I&apos;m not sure if you&apos;re telling me that I have no credibility or if the Senecas have no credibility...but i was there in crowd today standing five feet infront of Snyder and Maseillo and Brown as they were speaking and I heard the same thing as you. That doesn&apos;t conflict with what I posted before. Their earlier plans originally said 140,000 sq ft casino, 120,000 sq ft ramp. Obviously now, they are looking at a 12 story hotel, 10 story ramp, 3 story casino below. The Senecas are not like every other company that announces every thing to the public, they try to keep things fairly secret. Just because they didn&apos;t mention a hotel doesn&apos;t mean there isn&apos;t going to be one. They did the exact same thing with the NFNY casino/hotel...they occassionally hinted at a hotel then a while later they said ok we&apos;re building it. They will release info piece by piece. Jerome December 8th, 2005, 10:15 PM From what the Seneca&apos;s are now saying, no designs have yet been made. They said that they were going to bid it out and not have an actual design until spring. So apparently all that you saw was a concept and not actual plans. I am not saying this as a put down. It seems that the Seneca&apos;s themselves do not know what they are going to do. Seems like they are scrambling. For NF NY that have followed their original plan that was unveiled in a very methodical manner. As they complete one phase they then move on to another. The Buffalo site still seems very fluid and up in the air. bjfan82 December 8th, 2005, 10:17 PM From what the Seneca&apos;s are now saying, no designs have yet been made. They said that they were going to bid it out and not have an actual design until spring. So apparently all that you saw was a concept and not actual plans. Yeah i&apos;ve never seen a 3-D rendering...that clearly doesn&apos;t exist...but i&apos;ve seen 5 different plans of where it will be located...and then the final one that made the cut...So just sit back and relax and watch them build it. Jerome December 8th, 2005, 10:19 PM see above, no need for name calling I posted by accident before I finished. Don&apos;t be so thin skinned. I hope they do end up building it. steel December 8th, 2005, 10:31 PM It would make sense that they would not talk about building a hotel. They will not have to pay any of the bed taxes or any taxes for that matter that other hoteld do. So their operation will be stiff competition to the other downtown hotels. If they keep it under cover they keep the other hotel operators form jumping on the anti casino bandwagon. If the Senecas play their cards right those other hotels would be pro casino. Then after you get the casino deal done you drop the hammer and build your hotel. homestar December 8th, 2005, 10:47 PM According to an interview with Supervisor Demler of Wheatfield the developers have shown him proof that they have obtained $500 million in financing for the proposed Wheatfield Amusement Park.

Is there any timeline for this? bjfan82 December 8th, 2005, 10:53 PM see above, no need for name calling I posted by accident before I finished. Don&apos;t be so thin skinned. I hope they do end up building it.

sorry for the name calling, but you jump on everyone accusing them of being liars all the time so don&apos;t tell me not to be thin skinned. I do retract my previous comment and i&apos;ll delete it. BuffCity December 9th, 2005, 04:07 AM The Casino, Parking and nearby lofts...

First off, the Casino being built will help out downtown, people are still going to want to get Hotel rooms, eat at restaurants and have drinks on chippewa, and unlike downtown Niagara Falls...Buffalo has much of this in place to happen.

The Casino itself will bring lots of people from PA and maybe Ohio and thats just what Buffalo needs...people to visit the city, and I think that in itself will be a key when Bass Pro comes through, because PA people are hunters and fishers, and Ohio is on Erie as well so they must have a fishing sportsman group in numbers. Combined with easy access and lots to do and see, this entire deal is big, it might keep Buffalo awake at night, instead of dead ass tired, and on Sunday wahen nobody is walking around, we will now have people going to and from the Casino.

Now everyones opinions will vary here, some hate the idea of casinos, some love it and some think they can&apos;t fix what is broke...but the important idea here is free enterprize and business growth.

I would love to see the Seneca&apos;s build a nice hotel, a wonderful casino and take in cash for the tribe, they deserve it and have earned they&apos;re keep...now it&apos;s time for the White man, the Black man and the rest of the US (Buffalo) population to make of this what we can and take something we can not control and adapt to it and potentially live off it also, atleast partially.

The people living in the lofts will have a simple choice...either deal with it or move...somebody will move in, hell Elk Terminal is sweet and I can bet this will only spur residential unit development on this side of downtown.

PLEASE as soon as someone gets renderings, please post them. homestar December 9th, 2005, 06:15 PM In my opinion, the results won&apos;t be as rosy. Traffic around the city will not increase because they plan to build an off-ramp from the 190 directly to the casino. Hotel business will not increase because the Senecas will build their own hotel that will be able to steal business from existing hotels (no taxes, no fees), restaurant business may not pick up when the senecas have their own restaurants, their own bars, their own entertainment.

You mention free enterprise. It&apos;s not. Because the Senecas will have an unfair advantage over all other DT businesses by not having to pay any taxes, not having to pay fees, not having to follow state regulations, etc.

Will there be some benefit. SURE. But does it outweigh all the problems? bjfan82 December 9th, 2005, 06:28 PM You mention free enterprise. It&apos;s not. Because the Senecas will have an unfair advantage over all other DT businesses by not having to pay any taxes, not having to pay fees, not having to follow state regulations, etc.


That would be considered&quot;corporate welfare&quot;if it was any American company.

Just a quick note too...they aren&apos;t going to be building an off ramp from the I-190. For a couple reasons...if they want to avoid all the lawsuits that will be coming, they can do anything or change anything on state roads, and we are not recommending the off-ramp because it makes no sense. There are two other off ramps within a few block radius. sargeantcm December 9th, 2005, 07:43 PM ^^ Yeah, not to mention that it would probably violate all the AASHTO interchange spacing requirements. ECoastTransplant December 9th, 2005, 08:16 PM Isn&apos;t a new off-ramp part of the Bass Pro package? So I guess it is making sense a quarter mile up the road. bjfan82 December 9th, 2005, 10:49 PM ^ really? I did not know that...There is already an off-ramp from the I-190NB at W. Seneca Street, people using the I-190SB will get off at Niagara St or Oak/Elm...it is only a few blocks away plus there is no room to build another one...i&apos;ll definitely look into it this upcoming week. BuffCity December 10th, 2005, 02:48 AM In my opinion, the results won&apos;t be as rosy.

How is having the Seneca&apos;s any different than having Fort Erie CANADA, it&apos;s still sovereign land. I love how people think the Senecas&apos; land is United States land, IT&apos;s NOT.

Free enterprize it is, simply because NYS makes themselves automatically at a disadvantage, thats not the Seneca&apos;s fault. Look at cigarettes and gas, if NYS would cut the taxes down off these, people would not run to the Rez and the circle would be broken.

And yes, if a casino is build, other hotels will get business as well, how much, nobody knows yet. Jimi C December 10th, 2005, 03:19 AM How can you guys complain about the casino? Its development. The Senecas are willing to invest big money in the heart of your city, its creating jobs (pretty decent paying ones at that) and they are putting up new buildings. What is the problem? If you dont like to gamble, dont go. This is going to bring people into downtown that otherwise would not go there. Im sure many of them will venture outside of the casino doors and pump money into the smaller bars/clubs too.

http://img232.imageshack.us/img232/4361/wfv19jg.jpg sargeantcm December 10th, 2005, 03:47 AM ^^ Thanks! Finally, some development news other than that damned casino. We may very well end up with a totally transformed waterfront within the next decade, but this is all we find interesting? It&apos;d be nice if we could discuss some things that would appear to have a 99-100% chance of helping the city, rather than this casino, that along with having 3 others in close proximity, which only seems to garner a 50-50 chance at success/failure. It&apos;s not like a casino is even unique to the area anymore, and personally I don&apos;t see what the big draw is, but I&apos;m not the type to get suckered in by the hype in the first place. I&apos;m still dumbfounded as to who is going to be filling these hotels. I don&apos;t gamble, but say I did. I&apos;m going to stay overnight in DT Buffalo when I live 10 miles away? Surely a casino is not going to turn Buffalo into a tourist mecca overnight. Besides, that role is already taken, and we don&apos;t want it.

But maybe I&apos;m just jealous, for I just wish I had some say in the planning of it, so I could get a 25% cut in the profits just for sitting on my ass. Man, I&apos;d do that until I was red and raw, and on a church pew (or a metal futon with a cheap mattress)!

Point is we&apos;re not going to know how it&apos;s worked out for at least a few years, possibly not until it&apos;s too late (not that there&apos;s anything we could have done, thank you Albany). I have the same feeling about the casino as I do about Byron Brown, and isn&apos;t it ironic, he supports it! All I can say is thank God no local money has gone into funding this thing (a la Bass Pro), or has there? Although in all fairness, much of that Bass Pro money is being spent on a worthy development framework.

BTW I read that the City has a 2004-05 fiscal year surplus of $39.2 million, the biggest in 25 years. Actually $77 million before you take out anticipated costs and prior debts. Now I don&apos;t know how those numbers relate to the total budget, but it certainly doesn&apos;t sound bad. ECoastTransplant December 10th, 2005, 03:59 AM Why is someone in Sacramento the first one to post renderings that were in the Business Journal two weeks ago?? :dunno: Come on guys, bring something to the forum!

JimiC:&quot;Im sure many of them will venture outside of the casino doors and pump money into the smaller bars/clubs too.&quot;

Sure is working in Niagara Falls! :weirdo: bjfan82 December 10th, 2005, 04:15 AM ^ thanks eastcoasttransplant for posting that rendering...I didn&apos;t see it in bizjournals, so good catch. Its been like 2 years since they announced that, i got the impression from this forum that it may wind up a dead project. But glad to see something modern looking popping up downtown AND it will be on top of a surface lot...so that is a double whammy.


I&apos;m still dumbfounded as to who is going to be filling these hotels. I don&apos;t gamble, but say I did. I&apos;m going to stay overnight in DT Buffalo when I live 10 miles away?

That&apos;s the perfect question. Me and my boss were pondering that the other day, and we are both dumbfounded. I guess it is supposed to be locals that gamble for a couple hours and have a few drinks and don&apos;t wanna drive home. Although I think that is a very very weak argument. That is the impression we got from the casino developer. If anything, I think it will just be normal people coming to Buffalo for business or whatever, and need a place to stay and decide to go to the new shiny hotel in town. sargeantcm December 10th, 2005, 04:22 AM I don&apos;t know, I just think I&apos;m scared shitless that this is another Silver Bullet. We haven&apos;t really had one in over 20 years, after all. We&apos;re due.

And unlike Metro Rail, when this is done, we can&apos;t change it. It&apos;s not even in the US! It&apos;s there to stay. Metro Rail, on the other hand, can (and should be) changed to meet the needs of the metro (as the name implies). Maybe it failed as a silver bullet, but I think it&apos;s become an excellent asset from which to build off - it can even share w/ traffic on Main St! I challenge anybody apply that argument to the casino. bjfan82 December 10th, 2005, 04:32 AM ^yeah I agree...i was at the ceremony on thursday and the whole thing didn&apos;t feel right. It seems like we&apos;re getting the raw end of the deal. The Senecas continually talked about getting their&quot;buffalo creek&quot;land back that was rightfully theirs in the first place, and kept repeating how this land will be theirs forever and it will never be owned by the&quot;white man&quot;again (they didn&apos;t word it like that) and it will never be taxed again.

I get a bad feeling about trading our property away forever for a short term Buffalo gain, and that is assuming it will do what we hope it will do for the city. Not to mention we kinda sell out our character and history for it, all while Tony Masiello cheers it on, and Byron Brown repeats exactly what Tony says.

But, on the other hand, if this really speeds up some other spinoff developments and the harbor development, then maybe 9 acres of crummy boarded up abandoned buildings given to the Senecas could be worth it and never an issue again. sargeantcm December 10th, 2005, 04:44 AM But, on the other hand, if this really speeds up some other spinoff developments and the harbor development, then maybe 9 acres of crummy boarded up abandoned buildings given to the Senecas could be worth it and never an issue again.

That&apos;s the crux of the argument, and unfortunately it&apos;s impossible to tell. I don&apos;t think the other examples people point to, the most applicable being NFNY and Detroit, look very promising, however. But perhaps we shouldn&apos;t be so quick to sell it short, either.

I also just don&apos;t think Buffalo has the critical mass for a tourism base to support something like this, thus preventing it from acting as another local tax. Maybe in ten years if even half of this water/riverfront stuff comes to fruition, but certainly not now. bjfan82 December 10th, 2005, 05:15 AM I also wanted to add to my post before, that i just thought of. During that ceremony they swung the wrecking ball 10-15 times and it didn&apos;t even dent the building. Not one brick fell. The wrecking ball bounced off like a tennis ball. As funny as it was, the Senecas are definitely gonna be knocking down some solid buildings. bjfan82 December 10th, 2005, 05:21 AM Why is someone in Sacramento the first one to post renderings that were in the Business Journal two weeks ago?? :dunno: Come on guys, bring something to the forum!


what did the article say about the Maguire Building...i did a search on bizjournals and can&apos;t find any articles about this building. All I can gather from the picture you posted was that it will open in Spring &apos;07. I assume they are probably going to start building it within 4-5 months. Are they going to have to knock down any buildings for this? Because it looks a lot bigger than the parking lot it will be located on. Or maybe this is from a different angle than I saw the site before. ECoastTransplant December 10th, 2005, 05:59 AM There was an article in the Nov. 25th edition, it wasn&apos;t available online. Here&apos;s the important stuff:

Paladino aiming for SUMMER start to building work

With a revised purchase agreement in hand and prospective tenants in tow, local developer Carl Paladino hopes to start construction on his proposed multi-tenant office building.

The Buffalo Urban Renewal Agency, during its November 23 meeting, is expected to sign-off on a land disposition agreement that will clear the way for Paladino to purchase the last parcel he needs for his proposed 11-story, 335,000 square-foot Court Street office building.

&quot;We&apos;re hoping to get a shovel in the ground by late spring or early summer,&quot;Paladino said.

Paladino said he is negotiating with four tenants, including three law firms, to occupy significant portions of the building. The building will include a 138-space indoor parking ramp for the tenants, a fitness room and deli. Paladino is also negotiating with a bank and a securities firm to occupy portions of the building&apos;s street-level ground floor.

This was published before the actual BURA meeting were the owners of Main Place came in and offered a $1 million for the city piece he needs to build it. A clever way to eliminate competition! He owns half of the property he needs- there are no buildings coming down this time. ECoastTransplant December 10th, 2005, 06:08 AM Here&apos;s a rendering of 731 Main, what may be the first terra cotta building constructed downtown in over 30 years.

I don&apos;t understand these single-story buildings in the heart of downtown. It looks like a strip mall in cheektowaga.
