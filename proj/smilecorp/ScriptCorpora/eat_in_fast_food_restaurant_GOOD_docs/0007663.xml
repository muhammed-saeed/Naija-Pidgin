Amalia&apos;s (Your Neighborhood Spanish Resto)
 
On any given day, my boyfriend and I would be in a fast food restaurant or the food court in a mall. However, every now and then, the wannabe culture vulture in us rears its ugly head, yearning for real napkins and mood lighting. With Valentine&apos;s fast approaching, we wanted to try a date place for a change. Spend some time just chatting with each other with no impatient person bearing a tray of food hovering around, waiting for us to vacate our table. Enter Amalia&apos;s along Aguirre Avenue inside BF Homes Paranaque.
 
Save for a man reserving some tables for a future party, my boyfriend and I were the only persons inside the restaurant. Very nice and cozy :) First we were given a small basket of garlic bread (very garlic-y bread! yum!) which we easily demolished. Then, our paella came which was supposed to be for three, but if you and your companion have a moderately healthy appetite, then you&apos;ll be able to finish the plate without much effort.
 
For dessert, we had apple pie ala mode and it was ok, although admittedly I&apos;ve had better. I enjoyed the ice cream though and had an extra scoop :p
 
I loved how attentive the waiters were, refilling our glasses even without being asked and patiently answering all our questions. Or maybe this was because we were the only customers that night, hence they had all the time in the world to cater to our every whim.

Amalia&apos;s is a great place for catching up with friends, family or loved ones and it&apos;s practically next door to us dirrty Southerners. So this coming Thursday, try to keep Amalia&apos;s foremost in mind when planning your Valentine&apos;s date.
 
 

* Amalia&apos;s 67 A. Aguirre Avenue, BF Homes 850-3123 Dining Hours: 10AM to 2PM, 5:30PM to 10PM daily

 Amalia&apos;s Spanish Resto&quot;The Best&quot; Submitted by Willie (not verified) on Wed, 2010-07-21 11:37. 
Jessica I think your too personnal on this. We are a close friend of Mingoy and Amalia. Santino is definitly right. Mingoy dosent cook at all he is the key in customer relation and the asset in kitchen management is Chef Amalia. We are old customer even La Tasca time were Mingoy and Amalia met. Mingoy is the dine-in manager not a chef and Amalia is the cook in La Tasca. During Mingoys successful time most of the cooks are sisters and relative of Amalia from her province in Antique. And most of her sisters and relatives are now in Magallanes or BF branch of Amalias. Even the cashier in Amalias Magallanes, she is still the lady during Mingoys time. Amalia still handles the kitchen well and we know that the youngest daughter of Mingoy and Amalia is the one handling both branches she is learning a lot from her mother and aunts. Up to now I still go to Amalia&apos;s Magallanes and sometimes in BF and I always see Amalia there... Keep up the great food Amalia!!! I hope more branches to come...

 Mingoys Submitted by Jessica De Leon (not verified) on Thu, 2010-06-17 10:43. 
Please bear in mind that the original cooks are not with amalia&apos;s. It is not amalia running the kitchen, it&apos;s her daughter who never even gave a damn about the restaurant business when her father was alive. MIngoy was the key to the success of the restaurant, he had the taste. Sorry Santino but the resto was put up even when Mingoy was still alive. The daughters went against their own Father. It was opened in Zapote first and closed after 4 months. Get your story right. The daughters hated their father. Amalia is also the second wife among 4 others. This was the story told to me by the children with the first wife.

 @Santino -

Thanks for the clarification Santino and having the story straight. Amalia&apos;s is the widow of the former Mingoy Jocson of mIngoys&apos;s.

The food is kinda the same but they did change it up. The Jocsons are good friends of our family way back in the 80s since they started Mingoys.

Happy Munching!

HI! MARLA

JUST WONDERING HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW AMALIA&apos;S OR MINGOY&apos;S?

 As i know amalia comes from Submitted by Santino (not verified) on Tue, 2009-03-17 08:39. 
As i know amalia comes from the name of Amalia Jocson who is the wife of mingoy. She is the executive chef when they started as an ice cream parlor way back 1980&apos;s. As most of the old customers know like my family we really know the family history. Now Amalia started her own restaurant after Mr. Domingo &quot;mingoy&quot; Jocson died last 2003. The mingoys name is already sold to the Bachmann&apos;s so the owners are new now. Now they have 2 branches one in Magallanes where Mrs. Amalia started and one in BF homes. Now the chefs and cooks of BF and Magallanes are the original chefs since 1980&apos;s. And Chef Amalia is the one personally handling her own restaurant. GREAT FOOD.... MUST TRY......

 aren&apos;t the owners of Amalia&apos;s Submitted by entrepgirl (not verified) on Sun, 2008-11-23 07:37. 
aren&apos;t the owners of Amalia&apos;s relatives of the owners of Mingoy&apos;s, maybe that&apos;s why it&apos;s similar.

 I think Amalia&apos;s is trying Submitted by Maristel (not verified) on Thu, 2008-10-09 21:50. 
I think Amalia&apos;s is trying hard, they just copied Mingoy&apos;s! I ate there once with my boyfriend and was not happy at all. Plus the owners and their cooks go in and out of the kitchen and are very loud.

 Yes, I agree that the food is Submitted by melina (not verified) on Wed, 2008-10-08 17:21. 
Yes, I agree that the food is a bit pricey for the quality.

I also had a not so good experience. I dined in last September 2 and when my credit card bill came, I was shocked to be double-charged by the restaurant.

 the place is nice but the Submitted by foodiewannabe (not verified) on Fri, 2008-03-21 03:41. 
the place is nice but the waiters and service are not.when my boyfriend and i went there for the first time last week, we were surprised that such a resto with great reviews have such a bad service. we went in and nobody even greeted us. the waiters/waitresses were all (pretending to be) busy. we ordered the paella for 3 and a plate of calamares. sad to say, we weren&apos;t happy again. the calamares were sliced too big to be considered an appetizer. the paella was way too &quot;basa&quot; and the the refillable iced tea was only the kind that was instant. considering they are a bit pricey, i suggest that they brew their iced tea and see what happens. my boyfriend and i are DEFINITELY NOT coming back to Amalia&apos;s.

 I&apos;ve been meaning to eat Submitted by melvel (not verified) on Sun, 2008-02-17 21:25. 
I&apos;ve been meaning to eat here, but whenever we pass by, there are no customers! To me, that can only mean one of two things: 1) the food is not good, OR 2) food is expensive. So which is it?
