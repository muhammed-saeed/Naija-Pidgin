Tips for Bakker&apos;s Driving School
 Doesn&apos;t Recommend wizi Joined 8 months ago 1.0 October 20, 2011 
 Did not pass the driving test. They need better instructors. Their instructors are like in their young 20s or at least the one assigned to us. Before the training, son was driving like a chauffeur which was smooth and nice. After training, he drove like a maniac in a hurry. Failed the driving test many times. Need mature professional driving trainers on their staff who knows the secrets to driving safely and correctly if we are paying a high amount of money. Need a role model driving instructor who knows how to teach safe and correct driving. Just saying &apos;Drive there and park&quot;won&apos;t work. …

 Refunds not given for services not rendered. Beware of Bakker Driving School. The instructor would only take my son on the freeway. Anyone can teach a kid to drive straight. The same instructor also saw fit to have my son drive to a fast food restaurant&amp;waste lesson time eating instead of driving. For his final lesson I called an complain. And requested my son actually be taught to turn properly, make safe u-turns&amp;3 point turns&amp;parallel park. I was told he would gave a different instructor and be informed. The new instructor said he could only do so much in a single lesson&amp;that my son would never pass a road test today. He also showed up in an SUV when my son only had experience in a sedan. He would yell at my son for struggling with blond spots in an SUV w/o experience. So after taking my son out repeatedly but knowing that I am not an instructor I called Bakkers&amp;said listen he was never given his true lessons. My son has a road test in Oct. I need a one hour lesson&amp;use of the car for his road rest. I explained he only has time fir an hour lesson because of school&amp;would not need the extra lesson had he been taught properly. I was told I would have to pay for two hours even if it was just an hour. I was told that was in addition to paying additional money to use the car. I requested an exception and allow us to pay for one hour&amp;the use of the car since i shouldn&apos;t have to pay for an extra hour that we were not using.one would think that was a reasonable request right? since my son never received proper lessons for the money that I spent. I was told the owner would call back. The owner left a voicemail&amp;I returned his call. His voice in the message sounded absolutely hostile. When I reached him live he sounds enraged. He accused me of lying about the last instructor. I explained it was the guy who die all the other lessons that was the slacker. He said I believe it about Sam because he has not been teaching a year. I said if you believe that about him he shouldn&apos;t be reaching. The owner said well that&apos;s not fair it&apos;s your job as the parent to teach him to drive. That&apos;s why you are required to take him out 50+ hours. I said I paid you a lot of money to teach him to Drive. It&apos;s your job to teach him the fundamentals&amp;my job to take him out practicing. I held up my end but I am not a trains instructor. The owner Rod said verbatim&quot;all you are is a complainer full of hot air&amp;complaints, so I don&apos;t want to help you!&quot;my response&quot;then I want my money back&quot;Rod&apos;s response&quot;I will not give you your money back because I just don&apos;t care&quot;since we did not get actual set Ices paid for I said&quot;well then I will report you to the BBB&quot;his response&quot;Do what you want... I don&apos;t care!&quot;and he hung up. It is clear this cut doesn&apos;t care about his customer, as specially if he chooses to dislike them. You see after they sell you a package of lessons they are usually done with you. The likelihood of your being a repeat customer is slim. So since they have no possibility of customer retention they have no reason to honor their end. He made that clear because is Rods own words he just does not care. If you do not heed my warning you better hope you get what you paid for because they won&apos;t give you your money back. And on one final note, the so-called instructor who is teaching under a year... I was told my son was getting some with years of experience. I still don&apos;t know if they lied to get the sale or are lying now to cover their fraudulent rear ends. …

 Paid for but never got a lesson. My son found Bakkers online and called to set up a first driving class and paid with my credit card. The driver stood him up for his first lesson and now a full month after we paid for a lesson they still can&apos;t schedule him for his first lesson! He is anxious to start driving but can&apos;t. When I called to get a refund the owner couldn&apos;t locate the charge in his records and told me&quot;you have to go to work for me&quot;and find the exact date of the charge before he would refund my money. This is a company that is totally disorganized. …
