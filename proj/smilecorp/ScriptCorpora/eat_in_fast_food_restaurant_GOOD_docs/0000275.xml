greenport lodging

 

Greenport and the surrounding towns have many small hotels, motels and B&amp;B&apos;s, most of them open year-round. They offer off-season rates, but the timing of the off-season varies from one establishment to another. Summer and Fall are the busiest seasons. In the summer boating, swimming, fishing and other watersports attract visitors to our beautiful village. In the fall the farm stands are full of produce the vineyards harvest their grapes, while fishermen come for the striped bass and blues off our shores. Winter and spring are our quiet seasons, but many businesses are open year-round, though on a more limited schedule.
