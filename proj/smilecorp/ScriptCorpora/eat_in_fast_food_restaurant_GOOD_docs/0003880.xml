 Persimmon and Pomegranate Salad 
 
 At our annual Christmas caroling party last year, my dear friend Pat brought this beautiful salad to add to the table of goodies. Throughout the evening I kept hearing requests for - &quot;that persimmon salad recipe.&quot; After the party, folks were e-mailing me to say thank you, but also adding their request for - &quot;that persimmon salad recipe.&quot; Last week while I was out of town visiting a friend, my husband warned me that there had been a frantic phone message left for me asking me for - you guessed it, &quot;that persimmon salad recipe.&quot; And then just yesterday, another friend of mine mentioned that she was making &quot;that persimmon salad recipe&quot; for her Thanksgiving dinner. So okay already . . . here&apos;s &quot;that persimmon salad recipe.&quot; The recipe originates from a November issue of Better Homes and Gardens . 




 Ingredients

Directions
 1. Squeeze juice from limes into large bowl. Add jalapeño Let stand 2 minutes. Meanwhile, trim and discard top and bottoms from persimmons. Thinly slice persimmons.

 2. ***To Toast Pine Nuts: Heat a skillet over medium heat; add pine nuts. Cook 3 minutes or until toasted, shaking pan frequently. Cool on paper towels. Makes 8 (1/4-cup) servings.

 Yogurt or Goat&apos;s Milk with Oats Cleanser 
 Here&apos;s a very simple cleanser to make and I promise you that your skin is going to love it. I made this for the first time a week ago and I feel somewhat addicted to it already. I&apos;ve made it with powdered yogurt and also with powdered goat&apos;s milk. I can&apos;t decide which one I prefer, because they&apos;re both amazing. I like to use rosewater from the Middle Eastern section of the grocery store to moisten the cleanser, but you can use any any type of water or hydrosol. Last night I added about a half teaspoon of honey to the mix for extra moisturizing benefits and left it on as a mask for about 15 minutes. It left my skin feeling super clean and soft.
 
 Ingredients 
 
 4 tablespoons powdered yogurt (substitute powdered organic goat&apos;s milk, buttermilk, or regular milk) 4 tablespoons organic oatmeal  Fresh water, rose water , or any type of hydrosol A few drops of honey (optional for a face mask version) 
 
 Directions: In a food processor, blender, or clean coffee grinder - grind the oatmeal into a fine powder. The finer the oatmeal - the nicer the overall texture of your final cleanser. Finely ground oatmeal is known as colloidal oatmeal and can be bought as such, however it&apos;s much less expensive to just grind your own oatmeal. Add the powdered yogurt, or other type of milk powder and blend the two ingredients together. If you mix up a good sized batch of this, you can keep a few ounces of it by your sink or bath and keep the remainder in the fridge for cool storage. 
 
 To use : put approximately a 1/2 tablespoon of the powder into your palm and add enough liquid to form a spreadable paste. Apply the mixture to your dampened face and massage gently in circles until your full face is covered. For a really good cleansing job , massage for at least a minute, or even better, for two minutes.  


 
 
 This mixture makes a delightful, non-irritating, daily cleanser, safe for sensitive skin types. It can also double as a face mask by simply adding a little less water and leaving it on your face for 20 minutes before rinsing with warm water. Adding a few drops of honey to the mask adds the added benefit of honey&apos;s natural moisturizing properties. Honey is a humectant , so it attracts and retains water. The oatmeal mask draws impurities from your skin while it dries, leaving a supple, elasticized, glowing skin underneath. If you use organic ingredients you are less likely to introduce harsh pesticides and chemicals to your skin, so when available, buy organic for your skin products. When I can&apos;t find organic, I buy regular ingredients, keeping in mind that I&apos;m sparing myself a myriad of preserving chemicals that regular face creams and washes include. 


 What Makes This Such a Great Cleanser? Dating as far back as Cleopatra, milk and yogurt have been used as skin cleansers and softeners. Milk products which are high in vitamins A and D, probiotics , and lactic acid , are absorbed by the skin when used to wash our faces. Goat&apos;s milk is a particularly good choice because the pH is the closest match to our skin&apos;s natural pH leaving the skin soft and moisturized after use. It also contains over 50 nutrients, pantothenic acid, biotin, choline, vitamin B2, calcium, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, many other trace elements, and anti-inflammatory compounds (short-chain sugar molecules called oligosaccharides). The lactic acid in milk and yogurt is a natural alpha-hydroxy acid . These acids are absorbed by the skin and help to dissolve the &quot;glue&quot; that hold dead skin cells together and in place on your face. This type of natural exfoliation allows the new healthy skin cells underneath to come to the surface - and this renewal of skin cells helps to show off your vibrant, glowing skin. 


 Oatmeal is an extra-gentle exfoliant that works to draw impurities from the skin and helps to unclog pores. It is also a mild astringent (a substance that constricts or shrinks connective tissues) - and it&apos;s EXTREMELY gentle on sensitive, or damaged skin. Oatmeal contains beta glucan - a polymer chain that comes from oats - which has proven to be an effective moisturizer and has shown in testing to help heal skin more quickly. It has has tested positive as an anti-inflammatory and it may also help to stimulate collagen production in the skin.

 Great Reasons To Drink Green Smoothies 
 1. They’re Delicious! 
Green smoothies don’t necessarily taste all that green. The higher ratio of fruits to greens generally keeps them tasting pretty fruity. What better way to kick start your day than with a delicious, fruity drink chock full of wholesome foods.

 2. Quick Way To Get Healthy Foods Into Your Diet. 
Drinking green smoothies is a quick and easy way to consume a wide variety of fresh fruits and greens that you may normally not find yourself eating. The goal is to choose the highest quality, natural, organic, healthy foods that you can find. How often do you consume raw kale, collards, spinach, celery, beet greens or chard? Popping them into a blender with your fruits makes consumption of these foods easy, quick, and palatable. You can even pour it into a to-go cup and drink it on your way to work. If you make a big batch, it can last quite nicely for up to three days in the fridge, providing you with two, fuss free mornings of breakfast.

 3. Weight Loss 
Drinking more green smoothies may result in eating less junk food. This in turn, may provide an opportunity for getting you on the road to all round healthier eating habits. Green smoothies are full of antioxidants, which can help to speed metabolism and fat burning. Additionally, green smoothies are packed with natural fiber that your body needs to keep a healthy colon. Many experts say that you need a bowel movement 2-3 times per day. A green smoothie will definitely help you achieve that goal which will help keep the body free of toxins and digested food. Fiber also decreases your cravings for sweets and other unhealthy snacks.

 4. Great Energy 
If you find yourself low on energy, green smoothies can come to the rescue. Since greens are packed with plenty of nutrients and vitamins that your body craves, you will get an energy boost that’s better than drinking some sugary energy drink, plus it will be permanent. By drinking a green smoothie daily, your body will get the natural sugars in the fruits and greens that it needs to provide you with excellent energy. There&apos;s a significant difference between processed sugar and the natural sugars that come from fruit. Green smoothies can also increase mental clarity, remove toxins, and can be a great source of omega-3s, protein, minerals, and nutrients.

 5. Easier than Salads 
Personally, I love salads. What I don’t love is making them. Once I’ve spent an hour making a nice dinner, the thought of having to also make a salad is a little off putting. Since I’ve been making green smoothies, I feel less compelled to have to make a green salad at dinner. In fact, learning about all these leafy green vegetables has gotten me into the habit of sautéing greens with some onions and garlic as a replacement for that salad or for our old staple“kid friendly”veggies of green beans and carrots. Victoria Boutenko, in her book Green for Life says that the more greens that you consume in your diet, the more you begin to crave these greens. I have to say this has been very true to my experience. The biggest problem that I’ve run into with eating so many greens is trying to find room in my refrigerator for them when I come home from my local farmer’s market each week. Greens are bulky and take up a lot of room in your fridge.

 6. Avoid Future Cancers 
One of the highest recommended ways to prevent cancer is to eat your greens. Greens have what scientists and doctors call phytochemicals. These phytochemicals are essential in preventing cancer and also fighting cancer if you have it. Adding a green smoothie to your meals will effectively reduce your risk of cancer.

 7. Positive Lifestyle Changes 
Beyond the losing weight, gaining energy, and finding yourself exposed to new foods you’ve never tried before, green smoothies may completely alter your lifestyle. Here’s what I’ve found about starting a healthy habit in my life. You start with one small change, and that change leads to another small change down the road, and so on. Before you know it, your entire outlook on food and exercise has undergone a surprising metamorphosis. Once you start eating better it will exponentially expand into other areas of your life. What’s interesting is that if you find yourself slipping back to a fast food restaurant or a few too many glasses of wine, your newly cleansed body will remind you (sometimes violently) that you are a healthy person who shouldn’t eat or drink bad foods any longer. In fact, I’ve noticed, that I just naturally don’t want most unhealthy foods any more. It’s amazing if you listen to your body what it will tell you. Green smoothies might just be the open door that leads to a permanent and extremely positive change in your life.

 How Green Are Your Smoothies? 
 One of my favourite discoveries over the past year has been the &quot;green smoothie.&quot; The notion came via friends who recommended that I read a book called Green For Life, by Victoria Boutenko . As a long time breakfast smoothie maker, this wasn’t exactly a radical departure from the norm, but putting green leafy matter into my smoothie was a new twist. 
 Let me begin by telling you that the book is extremely motivating. It’s short, it’s interesting, and it makes you want to run to your nearest green grocer for an armload of greens to shove into your blender. I began reading the book on a flight to Canada for a multi-city trip to visit various family members. By the time I landed in Vancouver, I was so motivated to start making these health reviving drinks, that I requested an emergency trip to the grocery store to stalk up on fruits and greens. The blender was pulled out from a cupboard at my sister Andrea&apos;s home and remained on the counter top until the conclusion of my visit. I was even able to ply my nephew Riley with one of these strange green concoctions and was amazed to receive the thumbs up. 
 My sister&apos;s home was an easy place to start making green smoothies while traveling. The real challenge would be to make them at my mom’s place. I knew that she didn’t own a blender and so my sister Donna, who was accompanying me on this next phase of the trip, provided a“Bullet”blender and brought it along. Donna and I are like-minded souls when it comes to things healthy, so not only was she on board with the green smoothie making, but she had a number of her own special concoctions that she liked to mix each morning for breakfast. Bless her heart, our dear mother sat back and watched the circus going on in her kitchen. I’m pretty sure we provided her with at least a month&apos;s worth of fodder for stories to tell her friends after we left. Making green smoothies in a regular blender is one thing; trying to fit them into a Bullet blender, was material for the I Love Lucy Show . To her credit, our mother tried all the many unusual things that were on offer, but I think it safe to say that we didn’t have a convert on our hands. 
 Almost a year later, I’m still mixing batches of green smoothie. The thought of making a smoothie without any green matter in it just seems wrong to me now. If you try recipes from Boutenko&apos;s book or web site and find that they&apos;re not necessarily tasting the way you want them to, just keep adding a bit more fruit or greens until you get the flavour you desire. I always start with the fruit portion of the smoothie, blend that and then proceed to add the greens. Taste after adding a handful and if it still tastes delightfully fruity and you think you can add a few more greens without making it taste &quot;too green&quot; add some more. I&apos;ve found this method to work pretty well.

So, if you’re feeling like greening up your diet a little, give the green smoothie a whirl. I predict that you&apos;ll be pleasantly surprised. 
 Green Smoothie Recipes These recipes come from Victoria Boutenko’s web site . I like to substitute one cup of the water for a cup of yogurt or Kefir. Try making the recipe as is and then amend as you choose. I generally find that bananas and mangos add a lot of sweetness, and if you freeze them or buy frozen, you can make your smoothie cold. Here are some additional fruit combinations to consider trying. Pair your choice of greens with any of them - raspberry-apple-banana ; pineapple-mango- banana; peach-raspberry ; orange-peach-mango. 
 
 Apple-Kale-Lemon                             Strawberry-Banana-Beet Tops                        4 apples                                                              1 cup strawberries
½lemon juice                                                      2 bananas
5 leaves of kale                                                    ½bunch romaine
2 cups water                                                        2 cups water

 Peach-spinach                                                     Pear-kale-mint 
6 peaches                                                            4 ripe pears
2 handfuls of spinach leaves                                  ½bunch of mint
2 cups water                                                         2 cups water

 Rocket Fuel Smoothie                                     Banana-Blueberry-Swiss Chard 2 cups seedless grapes                                      2 bananas 3 kiwis, peeled                                                    1 bag of frozen blue berries 1 orange, peeled and seeded                               5 leafs of Swiss chard 1 small leaf of aloe vera with skin                          2 cups water
5 leaves of red lettuce                        2 cups water                                            
                                                                                                          Here&apos;s a list of greens to get you started. 
 Kale Swiss Chard Bok Choy Mustard Greens Carrot Tops Yu Choy Sunflower sprouts (sprouts in general) Romaine lettuce Boston lettuce Arugula (Rocket) Collard greens Cabbage Watercress Turnip Greens Beet Greens Coriander / Cilantro Parsley Mint 
 
 A Word About Rotating Your Greens 

If you get into the routine of making daily green smoothies, make sure to rotate your greens rather than sticking to the same type day after day. Green leafy plants actually have minute amount of alkaloids, which act like a poison if ingested regularly. That’s where rotating your greens comes in. If you switch between different types of green plans, your body’s immune system is actually getting a boost because it is working on different alkaloids all the time.

 Why Choose High Quality Oils For Your Skincare Recipes 
 Whenever possible I choose to buy organic, cold pressed or expeller pressed oils for my skincare recipes. Why does this matter? All creams, lotions and oils that are applied to the skin are absorbed into the tissues, which then move through the capillaries into the blood stream. When poisons (insecticides, herbicides, fungicides) are used by agribusiness to grow seed, nut and vegetable oil crops, the molecules of those poisons show up in the extracted oil. This is the prime reason to choose an organic oil over a conventional one.

 Chemical or solvent extraction is the method used by the cheaper brands of oil (most regular commercial brands) to extract the oil. A description of how the majority of oils are processed, or refined, is sobering. The oil is separated from its food source with hexane or other petroleum solvents and then boiled to drive off the toxic solvents. The oil is next refined, bleached, and deodorized, which involves heating it to over 400 degrees F. The oil extracted this way still contains some undesirable solvent residues, while the amounts of many key nutrients (especially vitamin E) are significantly reduced. Antioxidants or preservatives such as BHA (butylated hydroxyanisole) or BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene) are then frequently added. The resulting product lacks flavor, aroma, pigments, and nutrients. All that can be said for such an oil is that it has an extended shelf life, a clear, uniform color, and an oily texture. 
 Expeller pressing is a method of natural, mechanical extraction and processing of oils where a small amount of heat is produced simply through the frictional heat created by hydraulic presses. This is usually around 120-200 degrees Fahrenheit and makes the oil suitable and economical as a base for cosmetics because of its fairly undisturbed molecular state.  
 Cold pressing oils is a method of mechanical extraction where heat is reduced and minimized throughout the batching of the raw material. This helps the oil maintain its original state, constituents, and depth. Temperatures are rigorously controlled to ensure that it does not exceed 80-90 degrees Fahrenheit. Although not a practical method of extraction for all vegetable oils on the market it is highly regarded as the extraction method of choice.
   
 Commercial oils used as the base oils of skin care lotions and creams bring whatever poisonous molecules are in the oils to the user. These are in trace amounts but they are nonetheless poison to the body. The liver will extract some to be excreted as waste, but some will be stored in the body tissues. These stored poisons do not go away. Of course, this same advice holds true of vegetable oils that you use for cooking and probably to an even greater degree. And one last point, regardless of refinement, it&apos;s best to store all oils in the refrigerator. Different oils have different lengths of shelf life, so pay attention to the information you&apos;re given when you buy your organic, cold pressed or expeller pressed oils.

 Recipe for Organic Antioxidant Oil Serum 
 
 When I first read about using an oil blend in place of a moisturizer, my immediate reaction was along the lines of ,“Eewh, that sounds kind of nasty.”I had visions of walking around with a Crisco like sheen on my face which was anything but appealing. It was only after wrangling to make my own moisturizers with minimal success, that I decided to give oil blending a whirl. What I wasn’t prepared for, was just how much I would love using an oil as my moisturizer. The oils in the recipe that follows are a far cry from Crisco.
 
 While many people shun oils as a beauty aid because they believe that the oil will clog pores or leave an oily slick on the skin, the fact is that most pore-clogging ingredients aren’t natural oils. They are mineral oils and animal fats. Certain oils are wonderful at binding moisture to the skin and strengthening skin cell membranes. Beauty oil ingredients aren’t terribly expensive and you can tweak the formula to suit your skin’s needs. It doesn’t hurt to have a few formulas standing ready to suit the changing needs of your skin. 
 The oil blend serum that follows has an emphasis on its healing and antioxidant qualities. Hazelnut and avocado oil make up the carrier oil portion of the recipe.  Avocado oil contains high amounts of Vitamin A, B1, B2, D, and E. It also contains amino acids, sterols, pantothenic acid, lecithin, and other essential fatty acids. It is highly prized to those with skin problems such as eczema, psoriasis, and other skin ailments.  Hazelnut Oil is known for its astringent qualities. It is fine textured and is highly penetrative making it good for face serums.  
The other oils in the serum are the heavy hitters in the antioxidant and healing departments. Rosehip seed oil contains good amounts of vitamin C. It is high in GLA, which help reduce the signs of aging, especially the fine lines around the eyes and around the mouth. It also contains Vitamin A, which helps to delay the effects of skin aging. It works wonders on scars and is the predominant oil used for treating wrinkles and prematurely aged skin.  Evening of Primrose Oil contains a very rare omega-6 essential fatty acid, namely gamma-linolenic acid. This is one of the body&apos;s three sources of eicosanoids, which makes evening of primrose oil potentially effective for autoimmune disorders, arthritis, and eczema. When mixed with antioxidants, and applied topically, evening of primrose can help decrease UV-induced skin damage. It is used especially for mature or dry, irritated skin.


 Antioxidant Oil Serum 
 1 oz. (30 ml) Organic Hazelnut oil 1/3 oz (10 ml) organic Avocado oil 1/3 oz (10 ml) organic Evening of Primrose oil 1/3 oz (10 ml) organic Rosehip Seed oil 5 drops organic Carrot Seed essential oil 5 drops organic Lemon Verbena essential oil 
 6 drops organic Rosemary Verbenone essential oil  4 drops organic Lavender essential oil           
 Measure ingredients into a small measuring cup or glass container stir and put into a glass serum bottle or dropper bottle. 
 I like to use my moisturizing complexion mist recipe to dampen my face lightly before applying this serum. Not only are you creating an on the spot moisturizer by locking water in under your oil, but it makes spreading a nice thin layer of the oil onto your face a breeze.

 Gluten Free Quinoa Salad With a South West Flare 
 This recipe comes courtesy of my sister Amy’s kitchen. This side dish was offered up at a dinner with lots of hungry mouths to feed. While everything else at the meal was tasty, this particular dish stood out above the others. Apparently I wasn’t the only one to make this observation because when I went back for seconds, there wasn’t even a small spoonful left. The peril of sharing a meal with hungry teenagers!

This salad fits a lot of bills. It’s relatively easy to make, it’s healthy, it’s beautiful with all it’s lovely colours, it’s gluten free, which is sure to be a winner in this day and age, it actually keeps well for a couple of days in the fridge, and the flavour is–dare I say, addictive. Okay, okay, maybe not to everyone, but it is to me. So make it for your next dinner or take it to your next pot luck to impress your friends.


 Quinoa, Black Bean&amp;Mango Salad 

 
 Ingredients 

•¾cup quinoa. Dry toast in a frying pan until it slightly changes colour and you can smell its nutty aroma. Next, rinse in a sieve and cook for 15–20 minutes in 1.5 cups of water until all of the water is absorbed. (This is pretty much like cooking white rice). Fluff and allow to cool.

 In a large bowl combine 

•2 cans of drained and rinsed black beans
•1 chopped red pepper
•½cup of chopped cilantro
•1 large mango, peeled and diced

 For The Dressing 

Combine the following
•Zest of 1 lime
•Juice of one or two limes (3 tbsps)
•3 tbsps. extra virgin olive oil
•½tsp salt
•1 tsp. ground coriander
•¼tsp. cayenne
•ground black pepper to taste

First combine the bean mixture with the cooled quinoa (pronounced“keen-wah”). Then add the dressing and toss.In keeping with the south west theme, you could also serve this as a dip for corn chips.

Serves 6 or more as a side dish
