 This Sunday’s paper had an coupon for 25 cents off a bottle of Fuze, and an additional coupon for 55 cents off a bottle of Fuze. The second coupon was located in the King Soopers insert.  Our local King Soopers doubles coupons and Fuze is on sale 10/$10. I was able to purchase two Fuze drinks for 50 cents.
