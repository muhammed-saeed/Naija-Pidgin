Protandim is the only supplement clinically proven to reduce oxidative stress by an average 40%, slowing down the cell aging process to the level of a 20 year-old.* While conventional or direct antioxidants can neutralize only one free radical molecule, Protandim triggers the creation of enzymes that can each eliminate over a million free radical molecules per second without being used up.

True breakthroughs are very rare. In fact, many people live a lifetime without ever witnessing one. But significant discoveries change lives and true breakthroughs change the world. For example, when Thomas Edison invented the light bulb it changed lives, transformed the world, and altered the course of history.

At LifeVantage, we talk a lot about breakthroughs because we have one—not the “breakthough” many companies claim and market today. LifeVantage has a true breakthrough, a breakthrough that is real; founded and proven by science. And unlike other companies today, we can back up our claim. At LifeVantage, not only do we have our own version of the light bulb—a revolutionary breakthrough, a proven product, backed by science and poised to alter history—we have its inventor as well.
 
 Dr. Joe McCord 

 LifeVantage Director of Science 

Dr. Joe McCord is the scientist behind our breakthrough product, Protandim. Dr. McCord is a world-renowned scientist, pioneer of Free Radical Biology, and discoverer of the anti-aging enzyme Superoxide Dismutase in 1969. He received the Elliot Cresson Medal from The Franklin Institute—awarded to distinguished inventors and scientists, putting Dr. McCord in the same company as Pierre and Marie Curie, Alexander Graham Bell, Orville Wright, and Henry Ford.

And just like Protandim is unlike any other anti-aging product, Dr. Joe McCord is unlike any other doctor or scientist. He has devoted his life to the study of free radicals, their role in aging and the many problems associated with aging, and he is recognized by the world as an expert in anti-aging. Now this breakthough can change your life.

 Glycemic Index??? What is it?? 

 I’ve long known that a breakfast of old-fashioned, slow-cooking oatmeal fills me up until lunchtime, while a bowl of corn flakes—with roughly the same calorie count—finds me craving a snack within a few hours. Likewise, whole-wheat pasta and lentils at lunch stick with me until suppertime, but if I eat mashed potatoes instead I’ll find myself ravenous by midafternoon. All my choices seem healthy, but some have more holding power than others. 

 When I first read about the glycemic index , I had one of those Aha! moments. Simply put, the glycemic index ranks foods containing carbohydrate by how quickly they are digested and how much they elevate blood sugar (glucose). By testing blood-sugar levels in humans after they’ve eaten various foods, scientists in Canada, Australia and elsewhere have assigned glycemic index (GI) ratings to many foods. Pure glucose, the usual benchmark for comparison, has a GI of 100. 

 The ideal carbohydrates for our bodies are those that are digested slowly and therefore provide a long, steady supply of energy. These foods rank low on the glycemic index scale and include apples (38), pumpernickel rye bread (50), whole-wheat spaghetti (37), dried beans (30) and lentils (30). 

 In contrast, high-scoring foods digest quickly and send a rush of glucose into the bloodstream. Examples of high-GI foods are corn flakes (92), mashed potatoes (74), doughnuts (76) and white Wonder Bread (73). 

 High blood-glucose levels are of extreme concern for those with diabetes, but can also be bad for the rest of us. Glucose spikes trigger rushes of insulin, the hormone that ferries glucose into cells. The surge of insulin quickly moves the glucose out of the bloodstream and into our cells, but the consequent drop in blood sugar triggers a feeling of hunger. Even more troubling, continued high insulin levels can promote fat storage, weight gain and can lead to heart disease and stroke by causing higher blood fats (triglycerides), lower good cholesterol (HDL) and elevated blood pressure. 

 Why are some carbohydrates better than others at helping avoid these glucose-insulin spikes, crashes and follow-up hunger? Most foods with low GI values have larger particle sizes and coarser, more fibrous textures. They require more chewing and move through the digestive tract slowly. On the other hand, potatoes and grains finely ground into flour or pulverized and formed into cereals have small food particles that are digested very rapidly—almost instantly, in fact. Interestingly, cooking methods can change the glycemic effects of foods. Overcooked and starchy pasta, for example, digests much more swiftly than pasta served al dente. 

 The glycemic index scoring of some foods holds other surprises. Old-fashioned oatmeal with flattened grains of oats has a low GI (55), while instant or quick-cooking oatmeal, processed to make the grains thinner, has a higher rating (66) because we digest the thinner grains more quickly. Ice cream gets a low GI score (37) because its butterfat puts on the brakes, causing it to move through the digestive tract more slowly than low-fat sweets, such as jelly beans (78). 

 

 Thus the glycemic index is only one of a number of measures needed to identify healthful foods. We still must be mindful of calories and ingredients, such as saturated fat, that should be eaten in moderation. All fats and protein register zero on the glycemic index because they contain no carbohydrate. And some foods are so low in carbohydrate—salad vegetables, for example—that their GI ratings are meaningless. 

 Be prepared: we are about to hear much more about the glycemic index and a related term, glycemic load (which more realistically reflects typical portion sizes). Some of it will be Too Amazing to Be True! and some of it will be confusing and contradictory. In the end, however, the glycemic index will be one more useful tool for helping us compare carbohydrate foods to identify the better choices. 

 North Americans often snack on unhealthy foods that, rather than satisfy, tempt us to eat more. If nothing else, the glycemic index can help us choose carbohydrates that stay with us, suppressing between-meal hunger pangs and the consequences they bring. (For further information, see: www.glycemicindex.com and The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, July 2002.)

 Beyond Organic Weight Loss Program 

I would like you to go to my blog www.fit4excellence.com and read all of the articles on exercise, nutrition, weight loss, etc…I think it will really help you! If you would like to journal your food consumption, please feel free to click on“comment”on any of the articles and journal away!! This way I can tweak your program daily OR you can just write it all down and we can go over it during a weekly paid consultation…it is up to you!!

Here is a beginning‘overview”of how I want you to start your new lifestyle program:

A.M.: -start your day with a cup of hot water with fresh lemon juice (cleanse)!    -1 scoop of Fruity Green Energy in water -1 scoop of Perfect Pro Meal…make a“smoothie”by adding 1/2 cup juice, water, fruit..be creative! Just try to keep it around 200-250 calories! -take 2 Calcium, 1 CraveCONTROL and/or 2 ThermoTRIM.  (you don’t need a multivitamin…it is in the Perfect Pro Meal.)

MID A.M.: more water…add lemon! (try to get in 1 gallon total per day) snack should consist of a small amt. of protein with a fibrous carb., for example: 10 raw almonds and 1 small apple OR a Perfect PRO Meal Bar.

LUNCH: Have your Perfect Pro Meal smoothie again! There are lots of fun smoothie recipes on http://www.80awesomecalories.com/pdf/SilkLightRecipes.pdf you just may need to modify!

Here is an example: (just cut the juice or soy in 1/2  and ADD PERFECT PRO MEAL)

Chocolate, Banana, and Almond Smoothie :

Ingredients 1 large banana 1 ¼ cups Silk Light Plain (change this to 1/2 cup) ,1 ½ tablespoons crushed raw almonds, 1 tablespoon  unsweetened cocoa powder, add Perfect Pro Meal to get your protein in!!

Preparation: Combine all the ingredients in a blender and mix until smooth, about 2 minutes. Note: For a thicker smoothie, peel, quarter, and freeze the banana overnight, and then blend with remaining ingredients.

MID AFTERNOON SNACK: Take 1-2 Crave Control, 2 ThermoTRIM and  1/2 protein bar, or some lean meat and veggies/fruit  (low glycemic veggies and fruits are best) Enjoy some HOT tea!

DINNER: Lean meat, about 30 grams is the size of the palm of your hand, chicken, turkey, fish, bison. (be creative with healthy marinades), 2 cups of veggies, Salad with balsamic vinaigrette light or vinegar and olive oil ( or almond oil), Add nuts, cranberries,…make it colorful! (you may flip your lunch and dinner if you chose to)

Try your best NOT to eat after 7 pm!! Drink hot tea to help the tummy in eve…..buy camomille tea bags!

BED TIME SNACK: 1 serving of Fruity Green Energy in water,  Take 1 tablespoon of Seabiotics (omega 3 and 9)

The key is to eat LIVE healthy foods that are full of NUTRITION!

Give it your best shot and call me with any questions!!

(Remember you get 1 CHEAT day per week!!)  Once you hit your weight loss goal I will put you on a maintainance program!! 

Blessings of health to you~

 PUMP Iron! 

Resistance training increases your resting metabolic rate by about 7%, so you’ll burn more calories throughout the day, even while sitting on your duff! 

This is according to Tufts University researchers.

Aim for 30-40 min., 3 times week!

 Your HEART Rate!! 

Your training heart rate zone is a critical element in exercise. Taking your pulse and figuring your heart rate during a workout is one of the primary indicators in ascertaining the intensity level at which you and your heart is working. There are many ways to measure exercise intensity. The Karvonen Formula is one of most effective methods used to determine your heart rate. The Ratings of Perceived Exertion and Talk Test methods are subjective measurements that can be used in addition to taking a pulse.

 The Karvonen Formula 
This is a heart rate reserve formula and it’s one of the most effective methods used to calculate training heart rate. The formula factors in your resting heart rate, therefore, you’ll need to determine your resting heart rate by doing the following:

 Prior to getting out of bed in the morning, take your pulse on your wrist (radial pulse) or on the side of your neck (carotid pulse). Count the number of beats, starting with zero, for one minute. If you don’t have a stop watch or a second hand in your bedroom, you can measure the time by watching for the number to change on a digital alarm clock. Find your pulse and start counting when the minute number changes the first time, stop counting when it changes again. To help assure accuracy, take your resting heart rate three mornings in a row and average the 3 heart rates together. 

Another element in finding your training heart rate zone is determining the intensity level at which you should exercise. As a general rule, you should exercise at an intensity between 50%–85% of your heart rate reserve. Your individual level of fitness will ultimately determine where you fall within this range. Use the following table as a guide for determining your intensity level:



Beginner or low fitness level . . .50%–60%
Average fitness level . . . . . . . . 60%–70%
High fitness level . . . . . . . . . . . 75%–85%
Now that we’ve determined and gathered the information needed, we can pull the information together in the Karvonen Formula:



220–Age = Maximum Heart Rate
Max Heart Rate–Rest. Heart Rate x Intensity + Rest. Heart Rate = Training Heart Rate 

 
 Jane’s  Minimum Training Heart Rate:
220–33 (Age) = 187
187–75 (Rest. HR) = 112
112 x .50 (Min. Intensity) + 75 (Rest. HR) = 131 Beats/MinuteJane’s Maximum Training Heart Rate:
220–33 (Age) = 187
187–75 (Rest. HR) = 112
112 x .60 (Max. Intensity) + 75 (Rest. HR) = 142 Beats/Minute

 
 
For example, Jane  is 33 yrs old, has a resting heart rate of 75 and she’s just beginning her exercise program (her intensity level will be 50%–60%.) Sally’s training heart rate zone will be 131-142 beats per minute:

Periodically, take your pulse during your exercise session to gauge your intensity level. Typically, the easiest location for taking a pulse is on the side of your neck, the carotid pulse. Be sure not to press too hard on the carotid artery or you’ll get an inaccurate reading. Count the number of beats, always beginning with zero, for 6 seconds (then multiply by 10), or for 10 seconds (then multiply by 6) to get the number of times your heart is beating per minute. If your pulse is within your training heart rate zone, you’re right on track! If not, adjust your exercise workload until you get into your zone.

 Ratings of Perceived Exertion (Borg Scale) 
Another method that can be used in conjunction with taking your pulse is the Ratings of Perceived Exertion (RPE). This is a subjective method that allows you to rate how hard you feel you’re working. RPE can be the primary means of measuring exercise intensity if you do not have typical heart rate responses to graded exercise. These people include those on beta blocking medications, some cardiac and diabetic patients, pregnant women, and others who may have an altered heart rate response.

On a scale of 0–10, rate how you’re feeling in terms of exercise fatigue, including how you feel both physically and mentally. You should be exercising between an RPE of 4 (somewhat strong) and an RPE of 5 or 6 (strong). Use the following table to determine the intensity level:

 
 
 
 
0 . . . . .Nothing at all
0.5 . . . Very, very weak
1 . . . . .Very weak
2 . . . . .Weak
3 . . . . .Moderate
4 . . . . .Somewhat strong
5 . . . . .Strong
6
7 . . . . .Very strong
8
9
10 . . . .Very, very strong (Maximal)
 
 
 
 

 The Talk-Test Method 
Like the RPE, the talk test method is subjective and should be used in conjunction with taking a pulse. The talk test is quite useful in determining your comfort zone of aerobic intensity, especially if you are just beginning an exercise program. If you are able to talk during your workout without a great deal of strain, you’re most likely in your comfort zone. Work at an intensity that allows you to breathe comfortably and rhythmically throughout all phases of your workout. This will ensure a safe and comfortable level of exercise.

Hope this helps you!!

Stay Strong~

 Nancy’s Personal Entry..Food and Workout! 

What a gorgeous day in MN!!

It has been one week since my“detox, get fit program”was launched.

Things are going very well.  In fact, today I power walked with my friend, Vicki, for 90 minutes!  We are thinkin’it was between 6-7 miles…yeah for us!

I have been staying completely away from any processed foods, sugars, and dairy!  I have been eating my products from www.BeyondOrganicStore.com , lots of low sugar veggies, some fruits, egg whites, chicken breasts and fish (wild caught), excepted for my canned white tuna.  I have been drinking loads of water with lemon, herbal teas and a“tad”bit of coffee.  (my“treat”for the day, BUT I only add stevia for sweetener and a drop of light soy milk).

My energy has been good thanks to Max gxl, this has also helped my workout recovery time. ( www.BuyProductsHere.com ) I am shocked that I am not getting too sore after KILLER workouts with weights and cardio!

My goal is to lose 3-4 lbs per week, but ultimately, I care about my body composition the most.  I will ONLY weigh myself 1 time per week.  This helps me to STAY diciplined.  At night when I REALLY want to eat, I drink my fruity green energy instead and go to bed!  I have noticed that my sleep has been very deep and I wake up completely refreshed.  Today, I had to wake up at 4 am to take my sister, Kathie and her hubby, Scott to the airport; I am  still feeling great and it is 5 pm!

One of my“energy”tricks is to eat small amts. of protein throughout the day, maybe 10 grams every 2 hours.  I also LOVE to munch on slices of green, yellow or red peppers at those times.

Lunch was amazing…a“mound”of spinach leaves, grilled salmon (30 grams pro.) and a drizzle of olive oil and balsamic vinigar.  Ice Tea. (constant comment)

Comment and let me know some of your favorite healthy lunches!

 About Colon Cleansing: 

About Colon Cleansing One of the main theories behind colon cleansing is an ancient belief called the theory of autointoxication. This is the belief that undigested meat and other foods cause mucus buildup in the colon. This buildup produces toxins, the theory goes, which enter the blood’s circulation, poisoning the body.

Some people claim these toxins cause a wide range of symptoms, such as: • Fatigue • Headache • Weight gain • Low energy

The colon is extremely significant in regards to its specific purpose. The colon is a section of the large intestine that extends from the cecum to the rectum. It is imperative that people understand the effect that irresponsible eating and drinking habits can have on the colon. Coincidently, because the colon is the main organ of the body that manages the waist production and disposal in the body, the process of colon cleansing should be a part of everyone’s healthy living regimen. As the primary sewage system of the body, we can utilize a colon cleansing program that would consist of external supplemental products that are specifically designed to detox your system.

 Combat the Fat Program/Dry Carb vs. Wet Carb 

 Low Carb…Is It REALLY The Best Way To Burn Fat?

 Ok…bottom line…do“low carb”diets burn fat?

In a word?

YES!

A recent study of 87 long term studies have proven that when it
comes to burning body fat, reducing your carb intake DOES work best.

BUT…

“Low carb”diets can be VERY frustrating for most people and hard
to stick to.

As an experiment last year, I went 10 full days with ZERO
carbohydrates.

I mean, not even a blade of GRASS in my diet…straight
protein…not a single carb or gram of fat in sight.

I went INSANE!

No, I don’t mean that“figuratively”…I mean I literally went
INSANE!

I went from near sobbing fits over my computer not working properly
to hysterical laughter at the thought of even undertaking such an
experiment.

You see, your brain NEEDS carbs just to function properly so doing
without any at all was an extreme example of how your body does
need to get some carbs to function.

So here’s a tip from the“Muscle Nerd Looney Bin”on how to easily
burn fat the“low carb”way from my Combat The Fat program

Separate“Dry”Carbs From“Wet”Carbs

This is a little twist I’ve created in Combat The Fat that allows
you to EASILY reduce the WRONG kind of carbs WITHOUT counting
calories and NEVER going hungry.

You need more carbs on training days to recover your muscle so you
can consume 2-3 servings of“Dry Carbs”on those days (like
oatmeal, pasta, bread, etc.)

“Wet Carbs”include most vegetables and fruits and don’t contain a
lot of carbs so you can eat MUCH more of these each day.

Use them as“fillers”in your diet to keep from getting hungry and
helping you avoid the real culprits…those“dry carbs”.

I know this is a very different way of looking at“food”and
doesn’t really follow the normal“low carb”pattern.

But it’s a glimpse of the way that I’VE structured the RIGHT way to
use“low carb”to lose weight and forms one of the foundations of
the Combat The Fat“Daily Eating Guide”.

 Hope it helps!

Your“Champion For The Average Joe&amp;Jane”,
Jeff

Thank you, Jeff, for this GREAT tip!  Yes, it works!

I have lost 5 lbs of fat in the last 2 weeks.

 Healthy Grilling 

Grilling is one of the lightest ways to cook, but to keep it that way, you want to pick leaner meats. Find out which cuts to look for.

Leaner Cuts First off, here are the cuts you should be looking for:

Poultry: Skinless, white meat chicken or turkey; ground turkey breast

Beef: Flank steak, top loin, sirloin, porterhouse, T-bone steak and tenderloin; 90% lean ground beef

Veal: Any trimmed cut

Pork: Pork chops or tenderloin (personally, I am not a big  pork advocate)

Lamb: Look for the word “loin”

Game: Rabbit and buffalo

Game birds: pheasant, quail and ostrich

The American Heart Association certifies many cuts of beef and pork as low in fat and saturated fat. When browsing the meat aisle, check packaging for their symbol. Also, fish is a lean protein. While not technically “meat,” you might try salmon, tuna, mahi mahi, halibut or tilapia — all sturdy enough for grilling.

The Calories and Fat :  My advice?…”think about it”— you choose a lower fat cut, but eat 10 or 12 ounces of it. That sabotages your healthy efforts. Aim for 3 to 4 ounces per serving — that’s about the size of your palm or your smartphone. You may see “lean” or “extra lean” on some meats. According to guidelines, meats marked “lean” must contain less than 10 grams of total fat, 4.5 grams of saturated fat and 95 milligrams of cholesterol per 3.5 ounces. Meats labeled “extra lean” contain less than 5 grams of total fat, 2 grams of saturated fat and 95 milligrams of cholesterol. But be careful when grilling up anything that’s “extra lean” — they may turn out rubbery or dried out.  Remember, not all cuts are great for grilling.

More Tips:    When shopping, look for meats that have the least amount of visible fat. If the cut is marbled, that means it’s streaked with fat. For burgers, remember that ground turkey or chicken can have as much fat as ground beef because they often have a mix of dark meat and skin . Make sure you pick ground breast meat — or look for low-fat ground chicken or turkey.

Other Benefits:

Not only are lean meats better for you, but they’re better for your grill, too. Fatty meats drip more and can cause more flare-ups, which can, in turn, burn your foods. Grease dripping on your grill also wears out the grill’s metal parts faster.

Cost Controls:

Not sure what cuts are in your price range?  Fresh direct, an online food delivery service, has a great chart that gives ballpark figures on your favorite beef, lamb and pork cuts.

 Insatiable Food Cravings? 

Do YOU have insatiable food cravings? Everyone does, right? Maybe for you it’s CHOCOLATE…or POTATO CHIPS…or LIME JELL-O! Whatever it is for YOU, food cravings are one of the reasons so many diets FAIL. After a few weeks of depriving yourself, you mindlessly scarf down your“secret sin”food and then wallow around in self-guilt. Sound familiar? Well, here are 4 TIPS TO CONQUER YOUR FOOD CRAVINGS…

Food Craving Tip #1:

Time Your Indulgence The best time to eat your“guilt foods”are shortly after training. This is when your body can actually USE the common insulin spike from eating sugary foods to help your muscles recover from your workout. That helps you build or maintain muscle which will in turn help you burn more fat.

Food Craving Tip #2:

Find Healthier Alternatives Eating the WRONG foods isn’t an“all or nothing”ordeal. So many people say,“If I’m gonna blow my diet, I may as well blow it BIG!”. Wrong answer! Choose low-fat egg nog over full fat…dark chocolate over milk chocolate…bake without the lard, full fat butters, or hydrogenated oils that recipes call for and use“healthy”oils instead. One of my favorite“desserts”is sugar-free vanilla pudding mixed with Perfect Pro Meal protein powder! www.BeyondOrganicStore.com Mmmmm…muscle-building goodness for late-night cravings!

Food Craving Tip #3:

Cheat, Cheat, Cheat! When you’re trying to lose weight, a“cheat day”can actually HELP you achieve better results! If you’ve been programming your body to deal with reduced calorie intake, it can adapt and try to hold on to body fat because it feel it needs to conserve that valuable fuel source. But by adding a“cheat day”in (no more than once a week!), you can jolt your sleepy metabolism into letting go of more body fat.

Food Craving Tip #4:

Plan Your“Make Up”Too often when falling off the wagon, people see it as“failure”and just give up. Instead, when you know you’re going to be“cheating”, PLAN for how you’re going to compensate. So if you find yourself at a party and the voices in your head are screaming for chips and dip, mentally COMMIT to hitting the gym the very next day with the intention of burning off those extra calories!

Have a Happy and Healthy Day!

 Boost Your Immune Engine 

 Swine flu, a.k.a. H1N1 virus, morphed its way into our fears in a media frenzy. We focused on pork ; washing our hands; wearing masks; and boosting tired  immune systems.  We should have thought about whey….

New research confirms that whey has impressive power to boost immune responses. Not the aminos that help prevent diabetes. That’s old research. Not the aminos that help  heal wounds. That’s old research, too. Not even the aminos  that protect cardiac health; or keep our bones and muscles stronger; or our weight controlled. That’s all common knowledge by now. New research suggests that whey boosts the power of our immune engine itself as it fights infection; heals wounds; or isolates germs and viruses.

It’s the alphalactalbumin and the beta-lactoglobulin in whey that we want working in us. Those alphas and betas give our neutrophilis cells – important in our immune response to injury and infection – a power boost when we need it most. As the body calms inflammation; releases  histamines, serotonin or prostaglandins that cause pain; increases blood flow, or sends out the famous t-cells, a ready supply of whey’s alphas and betas  will power up the immunity fight.

When you’re in an immuno frenzy, whether from a viral threat, or the wear and tear of intense exercise, sip on some whey, and let the alphas and betas do the rest.  Order Perfect Pro Meal from www.BeyondOrganicStore.com

 Powerful Pecs! 

Any bodybuilder  knows that to REALLY add some flare to his/her pecs, he/she  MUST add Incline Dumbbell Flyes to his/her chest routine.

But now there’s a way to make this powerful exercise even MORE effective using a breakthrough THUMB maneuver for more FORCEFUL CONTRACTIONS.

Can’t finger it out…I mean FIGURE it out? Here’s how YOU can take advantage of this awesome new tactic…

1. On an incline bench (set to no MORE than 30 degrees incline), hold a dumbbell in each hand at the starting position (arms extended above you, palms facing each other).

2. With your arms slightly bent, perform a standard flye by slowly lowering your arms to the side. BUT…

3. As you lower them, instead of keeping your hands and wrists LOCKED, ROTATE your hands so that your THUMBS point TOWARD THE CEILING at the bottom of the movement. (Make sure you feel a good stretch in your chest at the bottom.)

4. While focusing on contracting your chest muscles (rather than your arms), quickly raise both arms to the starting position while ROTATING your hands so that your palms face each other again.

This maneuver actually creates an isolated range of motion movement within your pecs resulting in increased muscle contraction and fiber stimulation.

To prove it, try this…

Hold one arm in the flye position while placing your other hand on the chest muscle of the “working arm”.

Now go through the motion of a “regular” flye with your wrists locked, while feeling the muscle movement with your other hand.

Once you’ve reached the bottom of the movement, hold your arm position and rotate your hand back and forth between the thumb “up” and the “normal” position.

Feel that movement in your upper pec?

Good! Now stick a dumbbell in your hand and get ready to GROW!

 Key to weight loss…please comment.. 

Plant proteins key to weight loss, healthy cholesterol, suggests study

By Lorraine Heller, 10-Jun-2009

Related topics: Research , Proteins, peptides, amino acids , Cardiovascular health , Weight management 

A diet low in carbohydrates and high in plant-based proteins could improve blood cholesterol levels while promoting weight loss, according to a new study.
 
In a paper published this week in the JAMA journal Archives of Internal Medicine , scientists suggested that popular low-carb diets with meat protein, which are often promoted for weight loss, may contain high levels or saturated fat and cholesterol, which could lead to the “potential for adverse effects”. 

 “This lack of a benefit for LDL-C control is a major disadvantage in using this dietary strategy in those already at increased risk of coronary heart disease,” write David Jenkins, M.D., of St. Michael’s Hospital and the University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and colleagues.

 “A plant-based low-carbohydrate diet high in vegetable proteins and oils may be an effective option in treating those with dyslipidemia for whom both weight loss and lower LDL-C concentrations are treatment goals,” wrote the authors, adding that more research was needed to confirm the benefits.

 ‘Eco-Atkins’ 

Their study, which was supported by the soy protein manufacturer Solae, found that overweight individuals who ate a low-calorie, low-carbohydrate diet high in plant-based proteins for four weeks lost weight and experienced improvements in blood cholesterol levels and other heart disease risk factors.

The researchers randomly assigned 25 participants to this diet, which they term the ‘Eco-Atkins’ diet, for a period of four weeks. The vegetable proteins in this diet were derived from gluten, soy, nuts, fruits, vegetables, cereals and vegetable oils.

Another 25 participants were given a high-carbohydrate, lacto-ovo vegetarian control diet, which was based on low-fat dairy and whole grain products. The diets provided 60 per cent of participants’ estimated calorie requirements.

After four weeks, both groups recorded similar levels of weight loss – around 4kg or 8.8lbs. However, reductions in LDL-C levels and improvements in the ratios between total cholesterol and HDL-C were greater for the low-carbohydrate diet compared with the high-carbohydrate diet, wrote the researchers.

 “The low-carbohydrate diet also appeared to produce beneficial changes in levels and ratios of apolipoproteins, proteins that bind to fats. In addition, small but significantly greater reductions were seen in both systolic (top number) and diastolic (bottom number) blood pressure for the low-carbohydrate vs. the high-carbohydrate group.” 

 ‘Debatable’ benefits 

The authors said their study provides insight into “debatably more effective and possibly safer tactics” for designing higher-protein diets for weight loss and cardiovascular risk reduction.

 “However, it is premature to recommend the‘Eco-Atkins’diet as a weight loss diet of choice without confirmation of its efficacy in larger studies of more diverse and higher-risk individuals. Long-term studies are also essential to ascertain both sustainability and safety,” they concluded.

 Antioxidant Myth…Truth Revealed! 

We benefit nutritionally from many components found in foods that also happen to be rich in“direct”antioxidants, such as oranges, dark chocolate and red wine. It is thought that if we eat these foods and many other direct antioxidant supplements, we would receive tremendous antioxidant rewards and reduce our total oxidative stress. Science is proving that to be a myth. Current scientific studies show that your body can’t ingest enough antioxidants through food, juices or vitamins to equal the number of free radicals your body makes every day; therefore failing to relieve oxidative stress. In fact, studies are also suggesting that consuming large amounts of direct antioxidant through supplements may result in antioxidants reacting with oxygen in your system, which results in the production of oxidants and increased oxidative stress. Coming to light through LifeVantage is a discovery that our body produces its own free radical fighting enzymes that are so powerful they can completely reduce the age dependent increase in oxidative stress. And with this discovery and the patented, clinically proven product that causes our bodies to produce the enzymes, a new opportunity for health and financial prosperity has begun.

Dr. Joe McCord LifeVantage Director of Science Dr. Joe McCord is recognized as one of the foremost authorities on the body’s antioxidant defense system. Dr. McCord has outstanding credentials, and he is featured in Dr. Sanjay Gupta’s book, Chasing Life. Dr. McCord is credited with co-discovering the enzyme Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) in 1969, which marked the beginning of the study of antioxidants and the impact on the human body. Thanks to his groundbreaking work, Dr. McCord is highly regarded in the field and has helped shape the direction of antioxidant research over the years.

 Lifevantage enters International Market in Mexico 
 August 19, 2009 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time 
 LifeVantage Enters International Market with Pre-Launch in Mexico, One of the Top Network Marketing Countries in the World 

SAN DIEGO–( BUSINESS WIRE )– LifeVantage Corporation (OTCBB: LFVN), a science-based, natural products company dedicated to helping people reach their health and wellness goals through science-based solutions for oxidative stress and the maker of Protandim® and TrueScience™ Anti-Aging Cream, announced today that independent distributor applications and orders are being accepted in Mexico in anticipation of a launch late this summer.

“Mexico ranks among the top five countries in terms of network marketing, according to the Direct Sellers Association (DSA). Mexico City is the second wealthiest city in the world, and the entrepreneurial spirit is thriving. Within the last 30 days, LifeVantage began accepting Independent Distributor applications and product orders from hundreds of new distributors in our Mexican market in anticipation of our late summer launch,” said Ryan Thompson, LifeVantage Vice President of Sales, who is overseeing the company’s entry into Mexico.

David W. Brown, LifeVantage President and CEO commented, “There are several reasons we are expanding into Mexico. Network marketing companies traditionally have achieved outstanding results in Mexico and that, coupled with the fact that LifeVantage has strong distributor relationships in the country, were key factors in the expansion decision. Nutrition and wellness product sales are booming in Mexico and we believe that Protandim and TrueScience are ideal for this market, especially with the research and science that supports our products.”

Francisco Varela, National Sales Director of Mexico added, “People here in Mexico have been waiting excitedly for the opportunity to officially sign up as distributors and begin receiving the benefits of LifeVantage products. They view this as an outstanding business opportunity and look forward to continuing the great momentum that has begun here in Mexico.” LifeVantage headquarters in Mexico are located at Regus Torre del Angel, Paseo de la Reforma 350 Piso: 10, Of: 10064, Col. Juarez Mexico, D.F.C.P.

“Just as LifeVantage offers products to improve both outward appearance and that unlock the master blueprint of cells for greater health, so does it provide a blueprint for prosperity that can set the people of Mexico and their loved ones free financially,” said Thompson. “Our opportunity program and our compensation plan have been authored by the leading minds in the industry. We are excited to offer such an exciting opportunity to the people of Mexico.”

 About LifeVantage Corporation 

LifeVantage Corporation is a publicly traded (OTCBB: LFVN), science-based, natural products company dedicated to helping people reach their health and wellness goals through science-based solutions to oxidative stress. Founded in 2003 and based in San Diego, Calif., LifeVantage develops nutraceutical products, including Protandim ® , that leverage the company’s expertise and that are intended to deliver significant health benefits to consumers. For more information, visit www.LifeVantage.com .

 About Protandim® 

Protandim ® is a clinically proven supplement that provides substantial benefits to help with the challenges of healthy aging. This patented antioxidant therapy works in a very different way than conventional foods such as red wine, oranges, blueberries or other popular antioxidant supplements. Protandim ® works by increasing the body’s natural antioxidant protection at the cellular level, triggering (inducing) cells to produce naturally occurring protective antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione synthase.

A peer-reviewed human clinical study showed that after Protandim ® was taken for 30 consecutive days, the accumulation of lipid peroxidation products (a biochemical marker of aging) was decreased by an average of 40%. The study also reported that this important marker of aging was decreased after taking Protandim ® to the level of a typical 20-year-old. Protandim ® is currently the subject of approximately 20 scientific studies at leading universities and research facilities. The nature and stages of the studies vary, as some of the testing is at a preliminary stage, while other studies using Protandim ® are currently in progress. For more information about Protandim ® , visit www.LifeVantage.com/mattleavitt .

 Fuel for your spirit! You are a blessing! 

SMALL STRAWS IN A SOFT WIND by Marsha Burns—Sept. 15, 2009: Beloved, your difficult circumstances can either be a stepping stone to the manifestation of My grace and glory, or they will be a tombstone that represents the death of hope. Right now, today, choose life and see the working out of My strength being made perfect in your weakness. This is certainly no time to retreat or give up; it is a time to re-fire and move forward with renewed faith.

Rise up and refuse to allow the enemy to use your current situation to neutralize you, says the Lord.

2 Corinthians 12:9 And He said to me,“My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.”Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. NEW RELEASES!

 Are you READY?? 



Are you ready to make a change in your health and fitness level?

We will teach, guide and support you on your pathway to success.

We have designed proven plans to assist you in reaching your goals, but ultimately it is your choice!

Feed your mind :

 Change / Choice / Decision 

One of the best places to start to turn your life around is by doing whatever appears on your mental“I should”list.

Indecision is the thief of opportunity.

Every life form seems to strive to its maximum except human beings. How tall will a tree grow? As tall as it possibly can. Human beings, on the other hand, have been given the dignity of choice. You can choose to be all or you can choose to be less. Why not stretch up to the full measure of the challenge and see what all you can do?

You cannot change your destination overnight, but you can change your direction overnight.

Decision making can sometimes seem like inner civil war.

Don’t say,“If I could, I would.”Say,“If I can, I will.”

It doesn’t matter which side of the fence you get off on sometimes. What matters most is getting off!

You cannot make progress without making decisions.

We generally change ourselves for one of two reasons: inspiration or desperation.

If you don’t like how things are, change it! You’re not a tree.

I used to say,“I sure hope things will change.”Then I learned that the only way things are going to change for me is when I change.

 GETTING LEAN FAST! 

Establish A Baseline Diet With A High Caloric Base And With The Right Ratios Of Complex Carbs, Low Fat Proteins And Good Fats.
 

This is really important as if you start too low, once your body gets used to that low caloric intake, you have nowhere else to go. In addition, too low of a caloric intake will sacrifice muscle tissue.

 
 
 In My Case, I Would Need: 

 (1950 x 0.4) / 4 =  195 grams of carbs
(1950 x 0.4) / 4 =  195 grams of protein
(1950 x 0.2) / 9 = 43.3 grams of good fats
 
Therefore, a high caloric base may be in the order of your bodyweight in pounds multiplied by 15. So for instance, since I am 130 right now, my caloric intake will be in the order of 1950 calories per day (130 x 15). The ratios that I feel work best to start with (and for the off-season) are a 40% carbs, 40% proteins, 20% good fats ratio.

 
 

My starchy carb sources will come mostly from oatmeal, grits, brown rice,  sweet potatoes, and my fibrous carbs come from vegetables like asparagus, spinach, green beans and broccoli. My protein sources will come from whey isolate, egg whites, chicken, turkey, lean red meats, salmon and tuna. My fats will come from a few raw nuts, extra virgin olive oil, flaxseed oil , some CLA , and the incidental fats found in lean sources of meat.

Give it a shot and tell me YOUR results!

Keep it real,

Nancy

 Curb-Craving Tips 

 We all have ’em – cravings. But you don’t have to let them take you away from your fat-loss goals this summer. Here are  easy-to-follow curb-craving tips. 

 Five ways to knock out cravings 
 1. Be hungry no more. Not eating regularly throughout the day will cause your body to
fall into starvation mode and
you’ll crave carbs – usually nutrient-void refined carbs,
such as white pasta and bread
– so nip that craving in the bud before it strikes by not letting yourself go hungry.
 Try this: Eat five to six small meals of protein and complex carbs every two to three hours. This will keep you satisfied so when a craving does arise (and that double-layer chocolate cake in the bakery window is calling your name) you’ll know that it’s all in your head because your body is fully fueled.

 
2. Know your triggers. Stressed? Bored? Sad? If you’re eating clean all day but then get hit with unexpected stress or emotion, those cravings could come creeping. If you find this is happening regularly, it’s time to jot that information down in your food journal or planner.
 Try this: Knowing your triggers will arm you with the best defense – carry clean snacks or see the next item on our list for another good way to ward off mindless snacking.

 3. Watch your sat fats. Going out for a round of food high in saturated fats (think pizza and chicken wings) can actually leave you wanting more for up to three days after your food fest, according to
a study from UT Southwestern Medical Center. Researchers say the fatty food hits your brain with fatty acids and prevents the hunger-regulating hormones – leptin and insulin – from signaling you to stop chowing down.
 Try this: The good news is that the same study points out that
healthy unsaturated fats, such as olive oil, don’t have the same waistline-damaging effects, which leaves your options wide open
for a whole-wheat crust pizza with fresh vegetables and olive oil or chicken breast strips sautéed in a tablespoon of the good golden stuff.

 4. Work it out. Sometimes those cravings are just a reaction to anxiety or boredom, which means that getting creative could be
your ticket out of cravingsville. The key is to distract yourself with healthy alternatives – not the kind that will leave you with regrets when its time to sling on the two-piece this summer.
 Try this: Get in a workout, take a walk or test-drive a new dance-cardio class for the first time. Turn your craving into a reminder that it’s time to switch gears and start something new.

 5. Be a kitchen vixen. Shedding pounds or eating clean doesn’t
mean sacrificing good food. Have pizza on the brain? How about a refreshing summer dessert or salty snack? We’ve got you covered.
 Try this: Check out Pick It Kick It by Oxygen ’s executive editor and special issues editor-in-chief, Diane Hart. It’s the perfect take-along guide on what to pick and what to ditch when it comes to beating those cravings, while still getting the most of your meal when it comes to flavor and nutrition. Including everything from what’s safe to order at a fast-food restaurant to how to get the most out of a food buffet, this book answers the questions you’ve been asking about eating clean on the fly.

Have a Fantastic Summer~

 Are You Skinny Fat? 

Are You Skinny Fat?

 
 
 5 Ways to Defeat Skinny Fat 

Take better care of yourself — no matter what you weigh.

 Get regular preventive health care — and know your numbers. Exercise regularly. Eat smart. Go big on vegetables, fruits, and whole grains — and easy on red meat, fats, refined grains, and sweets. Learn positive ways of coping with stress. Gather support for your healthy lifestyle by hanging out with healthy people. 
 
 by Beth Shepard, M.S., ACE-CPT, ACSM-RCEP, Wellcoaches Certified Wellness Coach 

Most people know that being overweight or obese increases your risk of serious health problems — it’s old news. If your body mass index (BMI) is within a normal range, you probably think you’re off the hook, even if you don’t exercise or eat right.

Think again. More than a decade of clinical research shows that many people are skinny fat , a popular buzzword describing men and women who appear healthy and fit on the outside. Many of these unsuspecting people have healthy BMIs, but are normal-weight obese ; they’re over-fat and at risk for developing obesity-related illnesses like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, and more. What about you?

 BMI vs. Body Fat Percent 

Body mass index is a number used by health professionals to assess whether or not your weight is in a normal range based on your height. But a normal BMI of 18.5–24.9 offers a weight range of about 35-40 pounds — you could be at either end of the range, or somewhere in the middle, and still be considered normal. It doesn’t account for body composition — fat or lean percent — and it’s not accurate for heavily muscled or pregnant individuals. In essence, it’s an imperfect measurement that offers a quick and easy, best-guess approach for assessing weight-related health risk.

In contrast, body fat percent offers an entirely different picture — it’s a measurement that reveals whether or not you’re carrying too much fat weight, regardless of the number on the scale.

 The Big Deal 

The concept of skinny fat is getting a lot of attention because we all know people who seem genetically blessed — maintaining a healthy weight without exercising or watching what they eat. But weight isn’t the only thing that matters. Studies show that whatever you weigh, poor nutrition and a sedentary lifestyle elevate your health risks. Check out these research highlights related to the skinny fat concept:

 A recent study found 29% of subjects classified as lean and 80% of subjects classified as overweight via the BMI method fell within the obese category when body fat percentage was measured. Compared to subjects with normal body fat percentage, these individuals also had higher levels of cardiometabolic risk factors such as C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation. Another study of BMI-assessed normal-weight subjects found abnormal metabolic profiles associated with obesity, including elevated triglycerides, glucose, and C-reactive protein; low HDL cholesterol, insulin resistance, and high blood pressure. Subjects with higher body fat percentages were most likely to have abnormal metabolic profiles, despite having a normal BMI. A 17-year study of over 37,000 apparently healthy 17-year-old males found risk for heart disease increased 12% with every one unit increase in BMI — even within the normal range. In a well-known 1999 study, Dr. Steven Blair and colleagues found that active obese individuals have lower rates of disease and death than normal weight individuals who are sedentary. 

 What To Do About It 

If you think you might fall into the skinny fat category, schedule a preventive health care visit. Your health care provider will evaluate your health risks and recommend appropriate tests, treatments or lifestyle changes. Ask about your numbers — such as cholesterol and blood pressure — they’re important to know. Depending on your needs, you may be referred to other health professionals, such as an exercise specialist or registered dietitian to help you establish an exercise program and improve your eating habits.

 Should I Get My Body Fat Measured? 

It’s up to you. BMI aside, if your health measures are normal, you’re exercising regularly, and eating right, you probably don’t need a body fat test — unless you’re curious. Cost, comfort, and accuracy varies considerably among different methods. 

The most important thing to keep in mind is that one number — whether it’s weight, BMI, or body fat % — doesn’t offer a complete picture of your health. Your everyday behaviors have an incredible amount of power over whether you develop preventable diseases that could cut your life short — or remain vibrant, healthy, and loving your life well into your later years. Make health-promoting choices each day — and chase the skinny fat away.

 How much Protein?? 


 
Bodyweight x 15 = calories per day


(calories per day x 0.4) / 4 = grams of carbs/day



(calories per day x 0.4) / 4 = grams of protein/day


(calories per day x 0.2) / 9 = grams of good fats/day

Total grams of protein per day divided by 6. If the amount of protein is larger than 50 grams per meal, then divide by 7 to make the protein amount per meal more bearable. In this case, you will need to consume 7 meals per day.


While there is conflicting research on the value of eliminating starches after 7pm, I tend to assume that there is some value in it, so what I do is that after 7pm I have no more starchy carbs, unless I have one of those days where 7pm is when I train, in which case, I do have starches for my post workout meal.Having said that, the first thing I want you to do is to take the total amounts of carbs that you will consume per day and deduct 30 grams from that. Why? Because I want you to allocate a minimum of 30 grams of your total carb daily allowance to fibrous sources.


Fibrous carbs not only help reduce appetite, but also increase your metabolism by virtue of the fact that it takes the body more calories to digest them than what the caloric value of these carbs is. So for instance, at 30 grams of these carbs per day you are looking to take in 120 calories from fibrous sources. Believe it or not, you body may burn 150 calories just to digest them so by eating these carbs you burned an extra 20 calories per day, which at the end of the Week adds up to 140 calories burned!

As my diet gets more intense, I find myself substituting starchy carbs by fibrous ones and eating up to 90 grams of carbs from fibrous sources per day. In addition, fibrous carbs aid in the digestion of protein, so please do not neglect them as you will achieve better results by eating them.

When can you eat your fibrous carbs? You can either choose to have them at every meal or you can choose to have them in the later meals, or split between your noon-time meal (meal 3) and your later afternoon meal (meal 5). It’s up to you. The remainder of the carbs will be starchy complex carbs.

Now that you know what your total number for starchy carbs per day is, if you have 5 meals per day then divide that number by 4. If you have 6 meals per day, divide the number by 5. If you have 7 or eight meals per day, divide that number by 6. In this manner, all of your starches fall before 7pm.

Now, like I said, if you workout at 7pm, then make sure that you have starches for the post workout meal. In this case, just move one of the starch free meals before your workout. By the way, typically what I do for convenience purposes is that I use these starch free meals to get the bulk of my vegetables in.

Now,“Where are the fruits?”you say. Since we are concentrating on fat loss, our choice of carbs will be geared towards low glycemic complex carbs and fibrous carbs. While fruits are very healthy, the fructose in them slow down fat loss so they are better left for bulk up periods.


This will give you the number of tablespoons of fat that you need to add to your diet. However, let’s recall that there are incidental, naturally occurring, fats that are found in clean items like oatmeal, skinless chicken, lean meats, etc. Therefore, eliminate one tablespoon from your number if the number is larger than 2. Otherwise, eliminate just half a tablespoon.So for instance, if your formula indicates that you need 2.5 tablespoons of fats, then take one tablespoon out to adjust for the naturally occurring ones and that will yield 1.5 tablespoons. If on the other hand, your formula indicates to take 1.5 tablespoons, only reduce by half a tablespoon, thus yielding a value of 1.


When do you consume these fats? I like to consume them on my starch free meals. Again, there is conflicting research as to whether fats and carbs can be consumed in the same meal. Because the jury is still out on that, I err on the side of caution and assume that they can only be consumed when the carbohydrates on the meal come only from fibrous sources. As a result, have your fats with your fibrous carb (starch free) meals. I like to take in no more than 1.5 tablespoons in one sitting so split your fats accordingly.


 
 Chicken 3.5 oz: 33 grams Turkey 3.5 oz: 28 grams Top Round Sirloin 4 oz: 35 grams Egg Whites (10 egg whites): 35 grams Tuna 3.5 oz: 35 grams Salmon 3.5 oz: 31 grams Grouper 3.5 oz: 31 grams Red Snapper 3.5 oz: 31 grams Whey protein 1 scoop: between 20 to 25 grams depending on product chosen. 
 


Since now you know how much protein you need, below you will find a list of the approved protein sources and the protein provided per serving (weighted before cooking): Protein Sources 


 
 Oatmeal (1/2 cup measured dry=27 grams of carbs) Grits (1/2 cup measured dry=27 grams of carbs) Potatoes (4 oz=28 grams) Sweet Potatoes (4oz=28 grams) Brown Rice (2/3 cup measured cooked=30 grams of carbs) 

For fibrous vegetables, concentrate on green beans and broccoli for the brunt of your fibrous intake and add to it lettuce, green peppers, spinach, onions, mushrooms, artichokes, zucchini, and asparagus.Typically, 5 ounces of green beans or broccoli yield around 13 grams of fibrous carbs. The rest of the fibrous sources presented here, require a pretty large amount to yield anything significant so what I do is that I concentrate on the green beans and broccoli for my main fibrous sources and then use the rest of the veggies as a supplementary addition.
 


This is the easy part. For the starchy carbs, concentrate on slow released type like the ones below: Starchy Carbohydrate Sources 

 Fibrous Carbohydrate Sources 

Evenly divide the fats between canned extra virgin olive oil (1 tablespoon = 14 grams of fat) and flax seed oil (1 tablespoon = 14 grams of fat). If you have a serving of wild salmon, then you can eliminate the flax oil for that day as salmon is a very good source of Omega 3s.

Note: Charts are provided for 5 meal, 6 meal, 7 meal and 8 meal scenarios. Charts assume that training happens before 7pm but if not, as explained above, just have a non starchy carb meal 1-2 hours before the workout and have the starchy carb meal afterwards.Also, I split the fibrous carbs in two meals (one at mid day and another closer to night time) but you can change that if you’d like as explained above. Finally, meal times can be moved as long as they are spaced 2 to 3 hours apart.
