View Full Version : McDonalds charging for ketchup..WTF? 
 
 mortimusmaximus May 21st, 2006, 03:44 PM I went to the local McDonalds today,,drive thru and got the usual and asked for 10 ketchup for my supersize fries.Yes I know this stuff is unhealthy but it&apos;s a periodic treat not a daily habit.
I was charged 70 cents for the packs of ketchup ...WTF?Is this nationwide or what? GateGuardian May 21st, 2006, 03:57 PM 10 Packs of ketchup!!!???!!!

You know McDonald&apos;s do have to buy these ketchup, they don&apos;t get it for free. If everyone takes a like a ton, they&apos;re be broke in no time mortimusmaximus May 21st, 2006, 04:03 PM Regardless of how much ketchup i asked for it is no different than going to a hotdog vendor and getting a hotdog.Then when you go for the ketchup he says that will be 50 cents please,,ya right.If I was eating in the mcdonalds i could use as much ketchup , salt and pepper as i wanted.Heck I could grab up all the salt and pepper packs and take them home.I think they charge enough for the meals to cover the ketchup cost.
It&apos;s not even the cost, it&apos;s that i always ask for ketchup and i didn&apos;t expect to be charged for something that is always free.What;s next to be charged for ,,onions, lettuce etc.? gordholio May 21st, 2006, 04:03 PM It&apos;s a sign of the time. Used to be that ketchup was just part of the order and came with it.
I go to Harvey&apos;s anyways and they don&apos;t charge for ketchup and they will put extra fixings on your burger for no extra charge. Plus, I wait for them to cook the burger fresh, rather than the McDonald&apos;s way, which is to cook them ahead of time and store them in a little heated compartment. sfu_lifer May 21st, 2006, 04:05 PM You do get charged for the onions/lettuce ;).
But yeah, this is outrageous. Still, McD&apos;s IS a franchise. To a limit, the owners may have set a policy for excessive condiment use.
Why didn&apos;t you just say forget it and just take 2 to see if they charge for that? mortimusmaximus May 21st, 2006, 04:07 PM You do get charged for the onions/lettuce ;).

I didn&apos;t know I was being charged till I was driving away. x86asm May 21st, 2006, 04:14 PM I may be a freak or something but I eat my fries plain :| . In any respect, when I go to BK, I can grap those mini cups and squeeze as much catsup in it. mpt May 21st, 2006, 04:14 PM thats crap, you should be allowed to have as much or as little ketchup as you want, its included with the fries. Restaurants don&apos;t charge you for getting ketchup, HP sauce, vinegar etc so why should McD&apos;s. Considering those ketchup packs are so small, 10 packs isn&apos;t that unreasonable. Do you get charged for pouring 5 dixie cups full of ketchup when you eat in, of course not. It&apos;s their costs associated with having a drive-thru.

I say, let the man have his ketchup :!: :!: :!: gordholio May 21st, 2006, 04:23 PM thats crap, you should be allowed to have as much or as little ketchup as you want, its included with the fries.

McDonald&apos;s is not a real restaurant, it&apos;s a fast food joint.
I drove through one time and ordered a breakfast - scrambled eggs, etc. and they didn&apos;t even put one little packet of salt in my order!
I don&apos;t know how many people don&apos;t put even a little bit of salt on their eggs - without any salt it&apos;s pretty tasteless.
How much does one little packet of salt cost - maybe half a cent or something? Geologic May 21st, 2006, 04:28 PM haha.. that&apos;s hilarious. Mcdonald&apos;s is going to start charging for napkins soon. Raggie May 21st, 2006, 05:39 PM McDonalds WON&apos;T go broke by giving out ketchup. It only costs them minimal to make their fries. The price of condiments is usually calculated in the prices of their burgers and fries, etc. Its a rip off. Maybe its just that one store and you should find out from head office if thats the norm. sportsfan99 May 21st, 2006, 05:54 PM I agree with the limits and then you pay extra.People could line the pockets with anhy to do them for a week talke about abuse.I know dq is looking at this as well.

you&apos;re talking about McD&apos;s the corporation. most stores are franchise locations and cases of ketchup and sauce are costs which the owner/operator has to consider. Raggie May 21st, 2006, 06:37 PM Franchises have to follow guidelines too. UrbanPoet May 21st, 2006, 06:38 PM i woulda charged you $20 for the ketchup. Who needs 10 packsof ketchup... you know resturants have to pay for those to right?
2 or 3 packs is reasonable but 10 :|

its either they charge you for them, or build the cost into the food... then ppl will compain it cost 4.99 for a meal ratehr then 3.99 Geologic May 21st, 2006, 06:42 PM its either they charge you for them, or build the cost into the food... then ppl will compain it cost 4.99 for a meal ratehr then 3.99

There are no $3.99 meals anymore. So we can all complain now, it&apos;s the ketchup that&apos;s increasing the prices!.. :lol: sportsfan99 May 21st, 2006, 06:44 PM No one needs 10 packs of anything. gman May 21st, 2006, 06:45 PM Regardless of how much ketchup i asked for it is no different than going to a hotdog vendor and getting a hotdog.Then when you go for the ketchup he says that will be 50 cents please,,ya right.If I was eating in the mcdonalds i could use as much ketchup , salt and pepper as i wanted.Heck I could grab up all the salt and pepper packs and take them home.I think they charge enough for the meals to cover the ketchup cost.

The reason why McDonalds is now charging these stuff now is because the people like you abusing it. And, that&apos;s why norma Joe like us paying the increased price. The price sure covers the ketchup cost but it does not cover unlimited ketchup cost. 10 packs of ketchup for one super sized fries? Hey! How about 200 packs? How about fill up my trunk?

Extra salt on McDonald&apos;s food? Yow! xIcewind May 21st, 2006, 07:02 PM The ketchup packs are tiny. I don&apos;t see how OP can only use three or so packs of ketchup for super sized fries. sportsfan99 May 21st, 2006, 07:03 PM The ketchup packs are tiny. I don&apos;t see how OP can only use three or so packs of ketchup for super sized fries.

Its people like the op that blows it for everyone else. 7-Endless May 21st, 2006, 07:09 PM I find some locations charge and some do not. I&apos;m not a big ketchup fan myself so when I order a hamburger or cheeseburger I used to ask for mayo instead of ketchup - some locations actually charged me the extra 10 cents.

I could understand if I was asking for it as an extra topping but to charge me for it as a substitution? :evil:

So what I do now is usually order it with no ketchup and after paying for it I ask for a pack of mayo - most of the time they can&apos;t be bothered to actually charge me just for the mayo. sportsfan99 May 21st, 2006, 07:11 PM I find some locations charge and some do not.

There are not charging for the first few.Its when you past 4 or 5 then they charge. Sajjad May 21st, 2006, 07:12 PM IIRC, supersize doesn&apos;t exist anymore (after supersize me came out).

The McD&apos;s at McCowan/Finch still charges even if you&apos;ve already paid,.. PIA to pull out your change.

It&apos;s Scarborough I guess.. what can ya do. Ojam May 21st, 2006, 07:29 PM IIRC, supersize doesn&apos;t exist anymore (after supersize me came out).

only in the states. jonkaho May 21st, 2006, 07:56 PM do they charge for salt? gtaguy May 21st, 2006, 09:13 PM anywhere in europe, McD&apos;s charge for ketchup... even for 1 pack. then again, any public washrooms there cost you at least a buck to use. EscaBoi May 21st, 2006, 09:44 PM It varies per restaurant. Some charge you for ketchup while others don&apos;t care, I would also say that it depends on who&apos;s working.

I remember when I use to work at A&amp;W, the owner started making us charge for packages of ketchup... he was so god damn cheap. Even limited what we could drink. Of course, I didn&apos;t care about the ketchup rule. As long as the owner or manager wasn&apos;t around, i&apos;d give people like 5 packs.

I remember a customer started arguing once, when the owner told him it was extra for ketchup/sweet and sour. It caused a whole scene... sportsfan99 May 21st, 2006, 09:53 PM do they charge for salt?

If you take 10 packs of any thing they should charge. akky May 21st, 2006, 09:53 PM yea i used to work at mcdonalds, and just as i quit like maybe a week b4 i quit they started that rule, in like last July, they charge for ketchup, sweet n sour, bbq, and all those other sauces...but not salt or straws or other stuff like that bembol May 21st, 2006, 10:01 PM This is sad...bottom line it&apos;s KETCHUP...!!!

If McDonald&apos;s starts closing down because of customers asking for it...I&apos;d understand...!!!


I go to Lick&apos;s so...!!! :cheesygri jb22 May 21st, 2006, 10:02 PM anywhere in europe, McD&apos;s charge for ketchup... even for 1 pack. then again, any public washrooms there cost you at least a buck to use.

When I visited Italy back in 2004 I was suprised the first time I went to a McD&apos;s and they charged for ketchup. Although I will say that what they gave me wasn&apos;t one of those packs but something like what sweet and sour sauce comes in so one pack was more then enough, atleast fo me.

Any way, I didn&apos;t care too much as it wasn&apos;t a lot of money and I actually think it&apos;s a good way to maybe have people rethink if they really want to pay extra to eat more stuff that isn&apos;t doing you any good. pakwan May 21st, 2006, 10:07 PM ketchup packets costs less than a cent (from what my manager told me before)
the store i work for only charges for the sauces, mac sauce and mayo in a cup.. (mayo packets are free unless you want loads of them) hey_dude1643 May 21st, 2006, 10:09 PM Mc donalds charges you for every thing now.. i got charged for extra sweet and sour sauce............. :| blizzah May 21st, 2006, 10:12 PM Mc donalds charges you for every thing now.. i got charged for extra sweet and sour sauce............. :|

That&apos;s actually a REAL charge now, unless you get nuggets.

And Double Cheeseburger and that other suff comes in a $3.99 meal. superizzy May 21st, 2006, 11:25 PM The first Dirty Don&apos;d that tries to charge me for ketchup will be the last time I go there.

If they wont give me a reasonable amount of ketchup for free i will ask for a refund on my meal and walk out. Siefer999 May 22nd, 2006, 01:55 AM 10 packs of ketchup is a bit excessive for a large fries dont you think? i bet your one of those people who also blame mcdonalds for making people fat. Allen84 May 22nd, 2006, 04:10 AM 10 packs of ketchup is a bit excessive for a large fries dont you think? i bet your one of those people who also blame mcdonalds for making people fat.

not really, lol, i used 7 packs on medium fries, it just depends on the person, some like to dip heavy.

I don&apos;t know why all you guys rag on him for using too much ketchup lol

kinda like pouring lots or little milk in cereal, and me? i lots of milk in my cereal literally overflowing :lol: john widow May 22nd, 2006, 04:50 AM Try paying then asking for ketchup afterwards if you can, they might not want to go back and punch in more for you to pay...but yeah...paying for ketchup crosses the line. 5abSingh May 22nd, 2006, 08:58 AM the reason more and more restaurants are beginning to charge for things that used to be free is because food cost for the owners has gone up by about 10% in one year. with things like minimum wage increase and the rising dollar factored in, the cost of many things is no longer covered in the price of the food. as a fast food restaurant owner myself, charging for sauce isn&apos;t something we do because we&apos;re cheap, it&apos;s something we do because we have to in order to stay in business. it&apos;s not just a few packets of ketchup to the restaurants, multiply those few packets of ketchup by the hundreds of customers a day. (ps. my restaurant doesn&apos;t charge for ketchup because we give a reasonable amount, just charge for dipping sauces) sportsfan99 May 22nd, 2006, 09:41 AM Try paying then asking for ketchup afterwards if you can, they might not want to go back and punch in more for you to pay...but yeah...paying for ketchup crosses the line.

Keep in mind its not paying for ketchup.It paying for extra no one needs 10 packs 3-5 ok but 10 yes they should charge. FastFokker May 22nd, 2006, 10:41 AM It&apos;s sad that so many idiots have abused the systems and companies are forced to charge for the small extras.

Although I could also care less about these fast food places, as I don&apos;t even go to them.. :lol: kookieMonster2k2 May 22nd, 2006, 10:42 AM Normally, you&apos;d get ~2 -3 packs per order.
If you asked for extra, get another 2 packs and they should give it to you.
However, if YOU are asking for a specified amount which is excessive, they should charge.
It&apos;s really up to McD&apos;s discretion on how much is an excessive amount.

I have this funny story.
We used to run a coffee shop type place and there was a select sandwich in the building.
The owner of the select sandwich started whining about this customer who was giving him a hard time.
She would order a toasted bagel and ask for LOTS of butter.
The owner being dumb, said OK, how much. (At this point, the owner committed to giving the requested amount by asking)
The customer said,&quot;Until it is dripping&quot;.
Was too funny listening to his stupidity.
We suggested that they control the request from the start and negotiate a price before it is made.
Therefore, we suggested that the next time they ask, to comeback and say, before the order is made and committed to, there is a charge of $2 for that amount of butter
The customer complained, etc and never came back.
Honestly, as a proprietor, you don&apos;t need customers like that.
She than came over to our store, but my dad negotiated the price before committing to the order and told her the cost.
She didn&apos;t like it and walked away.
If you&apos;re selling a toasted bagel with coffee for $1.55.
You would spread about 1/2 ounce of butter.
1 lb butter = 16 oz = $4.99 / 16 / 2 = $0.16
If you were to put a dripping amount, ~2 ounce, it would cost $.64 in butter alone.
Don&apos;t forget, there is the bagel, coffee, cream and sugar, bag, napkins, overhead, the employee&apos;s salary that must account into the price for a friggin $1.55 bagel and coffee.
Just be nice with the people and understanding and you&apos;ll get good service from them.

You lose money on customers like that, and thus why would you open up a store to lose money.

However, I do believe that, yes, McD&apos;s has the right to charge on excessive condiments... BUT.. they should&apos;ve informed the original poster of the charge so the that he would be able to say NO to the charge and get the normal amount of ketchup packets.

Also, ketchup packs don&apos;t cost a $0.01.
When we bought a case of ketchup packs, it would average between 7 - 9 cents.
McD&apos;s produces in large bulk quantity&apos;s, and probably save 2 cents or so.
But to say it cost a cent, not true.
my 3 cents dgs May 22nd, 2006, 10:47 AM I think when you are using 10 packs of ketchup, the ketchup is no longer a condiment but a side dish - absolutely fair to charge for it. Badman May 22nd, 2006, 02:42 PM Yea all i know of is that they give you the first couple for free and then they charge you. They do it with thier sweet and sour sause and bbQ sause. Also not all mcd&apos;s do it, i find that only the&quot;popular&quot;ones or the ones in the city charge you. ;) hotfishy May 22nd, 2006, 03:08 PM I do agree on the point that 10 packs is a bit excessive for fries...it&apos;s high in salt and will make u bald... b166er1337 May 22nd, 2006, 03:28 PM I think when you are using 10 packs of ketchup, the ketchup is no longer a condiment but a side dish - absolutely fair to charge for it.

i so agree with you, my brother who owns a small coffee shop cry&apos;s when people order a med cup of coffee, take it to the condiment table, dump out half the coffee and fill it up with cream. the cream and sugar costs more than the coffee. then they grab a wad of napkins and 10 stifr sticks to stir their coffee. when people make a quadruple quadruple, it hurts. mr_yellow May 22nd, 2006, 04:44 PM Even though I totally agree that the store has every right to charge for&quot;excessive&quot;condiments/extras, I don&apos;t see them offering rebates when we ask for&quot;no onions&quot;or&quot;hold the pickles&quot;.

Fast food is already too damn expensive anyways...

I think I spent 9 bucks the last time i was at harveys... SHEESH! mortimusmaximus May 22nd, 2006, 04:55 PM Whoa lots of love from all the posters for me here.I guess all I have to say is I always ask for 10 but usually all I get is 3 or 4.The downside to this trend is that perhaps in the future when all the haters in this thread get there order of fries in the mcdonals the ketchup dispenser will be a vending machine.Maybe a quarter for your lil paper cup of ketchup..then we&apos;ll see how you guys feel.

Yeah that&apos;s what peeved me off when I ordered a double cheeseburger with mayo instead of ketchup. Couldn&apos;t believe they still wanted to charge me - the worst part about it is that the cost of the combo would have went from $4.27 (no PST since it was less than 4 bucks) to $4.70 so it actually would have ended up costing me 43 cents more to have mayo instead of ketchup...eeek! sportsfan99 May 22nd, 2006, 05:43 PM Whoa lots of love from all the posters for me here.I guess all I have to say is I always ask for 10 but usually all I get is 3 or 4.The downside to this trend is that perhaps in the future when all the haters in this thread get there order of fries in the mcdonals the ketchup dispenser will be a vending machine.Maybe a quarter for your lil paper cup of ketchup..then we&apos;ll see how you guys feel.

It will be people like you that will lead to vending machines. Moot May 22nd, 2006, 06:14 PM Bring your McDonald&apos;s home and use your own damn ketchup them. Maybe you will think twice when you have to buy a bottle of ketchup every week. Good job McDonald&apos;s. Glad you&apos;re charging these idiots. gei May 22nd, 2006, 06:25 PM I went to the local McDonalds today,,drive thru and got the usual and asked for 10 ketchup for my supersize fries.Yes I know this stuff is unhealthy but it&apos;s a periodic treat not a daily habit.

I think you really answered your own question. If there are so many greedy people like yourself then mcdonalds would run out of ketchup in no time. gordholio May 22nd, 2006, 11:28 PM I think you really answered your own question. If there are so many greedy people like yourself then mcdonalds would run out of ketchup in no time.
Those packets are pretty tiny. mortimusmaximus May 23rd, 2006, 07:42 AM I always thought , ketchup, salt, pepper and napkins were considered consumables.That meaning these items are the cost of running a business.What the haters are saying here is like a hotel charging for soap and shampoo would be ok because so many people take the soap and shampoo home with them.
BTW those packs are awful tiny,I would be surprised if 10 packs even add up to 2 of the paper cups of ketchup.My request for 10 started with only receiving 3 or 4 packs when I ask for ketchup with my fries. FastFokker May 23rd, 2006, 07:48 AM What the haters are saying here is like a hotel charging for soap and shampoo would be ok because so many people take the soap and shampoo home with them.No, we&apos;re saying you should get charged when you ask for 100 little soap and shampoo bottles.

1 soap + 1 shampoo + 1 conditioner per person per day is perfectly reasonable and accounted for, now if half the people in the hotel started demand 5x that amount, the costs would go up and would eat into profits... therefore the company would have to either increase rates and lose customers, or just charge the idiots for additional soaps, shampoos and conditioners.

I&apos;m all for charging idiots a little extra.. isn&apos;t that why we invented gambling/lottery? The Idiot Tax? :lol: mortimusmaximus May 23rd, 2006, 07:51 AM No, we&apos;re saying you should get charged when you ask for 100 little soap and shampoo bottles.

This I would agree with. miss_swan May 23rd, 2006, 07:59 AM 10 packs of ketchup for supersize fries? That&apos;s quite a bit. 4-5 max is what I would use. I guess some people use alot of ketchup. If you actually asked for&quot;10&quot;packs of ketchup I can understand that they would charge you extra.

Keep in mind that the costs of tomatoes and associated products went through a very expensive cycle. The production of tomatoes took a huge hit due to bad weather to the point where chains like Wendy&apos;s ... or was it Burger King? - anyways - chains were stating that unless you asked for sliced tomato in your burger that they would not include it.

Hey, that&apos;s the way that it is.

Salt, on the other hand, would not even cost half a penny per pack. The supply chain has not been compromised like it had with tomatoes.

I also find it a bit disturbing that some/many people in these forums have little clue on how businesses work and have a hard time separating habitual expectations from reality.

Can&apos;t get 10 packs of ketchup for one supersize fry? Wow, let&apos;s blow up mickey d&apos;s. What&apos;s this world coming to? duckdown May 23rd, 2006, 08:13 AM 10 packs? What do you have, a ketchup deficiancy?

If I caught you taking 10 packs of anything from my restaurant I&apos;d throw you out.. stop being a glutton

http://forums.f2atv.com/images/smilies/eek.gif Siefer999 May 23rd, 2006, 08:17 AM didnt katrina fudge up the tomato market? prices almost doubled for the price of a tomato i think Ojam May 23rd, 2006, 08:51 AM This I would agree with.

and guess who you are in the story.

And you can&apos;t compare the cost of ketchup inside in the tub to ketchup in the tinny packets. Why do you think they switched to the tubs? Because its cheaper then the packets, I would guess significantly cheaper. kookieMonster2k2 May 23rd, 2006, 08:54 AM Yeah that&apos;s what peeved me off when I ordered a double cheeseburger with mayo instead of ketchup. Couldn&apos;t believe they still wanted to charge me - the worst part about it is that the cost of the combo would have went from $4.27 (no PST since it was less than 4 bucks) to $4.70 so it actually would have ended up costing me 43 cents more to have mayo instead of ketchup...eeek!

So you&apos;re gonna blame McD&apos;s for the govenrment imposed PST on food orders over $4.00.
You know that there are very few places that offer a combo meal for under $4.00 nowadays.
By increasing the overhead costs, you inadvertantly lower McD&apos;s profits, thus allowing a justifiable increase in prices.
I remember when they removed the $3.99 deals and I didn&apos;t go to McD&apos;s as much.
Now that they are back, I&apos;ve started frequenting it more often.

Don&apos;t get me wrong, I hat the fact that big corporations are trying to make a profit, but it is only these big corporations that can afford bulk, thus decreasing consumer price.
That&apos;s the way it is. WalMart for example.

If you really don&apos;t want to pay the&quot;man&quot;for the PST, do what other spendthrifty characters do, pay for it separately or cancel your &apos;extra&apos; condiment.


Cheers 5abSingh May 23rd, 2006, 09:05 AM for everyone saying that the free stuff is included in the price of the food, not true. think of the people that come in and take sugar and cream when they only ordered fries, or people that take an inch of napkins for their car, or pumping 10 cups of ketchup and using one or two (all have happened to us several times). also, many people will just walk into a restaurant and use the washroom or take condiments without buying anything. is the cost of those things included in THEIR food? and don&apos;t think that it&apos;s just one or two people, its about every other person that walks through the doors.
also, regarding the cost of tomatoes, when we first opened, a box of tomatoes (approx. 20 lb) was 20-25 dollars. since then, it has gone up to $70 dollars a box, and is currently at about $25-30 now. imagine, at $70/box, people asking for 10 packets of ketchup.
If you really like ketchup, buy a bottle and keep it in your car, eat your fries at home, or even eat in the restaurant since they usually have a dispenser. fireguy9 May 23rd, 2006, 09:17 AM pretty common in Europe to charge for this stuff,,,,, they have to recoupe costs everywhere nowadays srtor May 23rd, 2006, 09:35 AM Bring your McDonald&apos;s home and use your own damn ketchup them.

I was charged 70 cents for the packs of ketchup ...WTF?Is this nationwide or what?

I&apos;m embarassed that I have to share the same planet as you. People are you are exactly what&apos;s wrong with today&apos;s society. When you grow up and get a job and have to pay for your own ketchup, you might realize why 10 packs of ketchup is gluttonous.

Where the heck are you guys getting off.

I&apos;m just a guy that happens to like ketchup who decided to complain about it.Now everyone is judging me and making assumptions about my age and accusing me of being a glutton.All of these personal attacks are unneccessary and not apperciated.


You either agree with my first post or you don&apos;t.
Please keep your assumptions about me to yourself and I will do the same. kud0s69 May 23rd, 2006, 07:57 PM I find it funny to see how many people are getting on the guy for asking for 10 ketchup. It is better to have too much ketchup than too little. It sucks finishing off your fries, and being one packet short. Also some people like to add a pack or 2 to the burger.

Wendy&apos;s is the worst. I live close by a wendy&apos;s and would ask for&quot;some ketchup&quot;and I would get 2 packs. So I started asking for a whole bunch of ketchup, and I would get 3 packs. If I didn&apos;t ask specifically, they would give me none. McDonalds should just stop asking if you want ketchup. The amount of people forgetting, would offset the people asking for 10 packs.

WTF :confused: is with people saying&quot;Asking for 10 packs is abusing the system, and it&apos;s people like you who are ruining it for the rest of us&quot;. It&apos;s freaking fast food condiments. I should really hope your life is not ruined by the shortages of free ketchup you get. Ridiculous. It always was free. Fast food has been around longer than 99.999 percent of the Redflag deal readers, and I am sure there has always been people who asked for lots of ketchup.....

Some people need to get a grip on reality. ratface May 23rd, 2006, 08:38 PM I went through the mcD drive through tonight. Ordered a regular meal with medium fries. She asked me if I wanted ketchup I said no, because I wasn&apos;t planning to use any. Guess they didn&apos;t hear me. In my bag there were 6 kethcup packets.

So there policy sure isn&apos;t being applied evenly.

And if 6 is&quot;normal&quot;for a medium, then 10 wouldn&apos;t be ridiculous for a large.

And maximus, if you want some extra ketchup, pm me. I&apos;ll give you first crack, then I am posting them on the BST forum ;) Realrena May 23rd, 2006, 09:18 PM wanna know the actual material cost to make a big mac?

That&apos;s exactly what I did - I cancelled the mayo. I&apos;m not blaming McD&apos;s for the PST... I just find it really silly to pay over 40 cents more for a mayo substitution. FastFokker May 23rd, 2006, 11:39 PM wanna know the actual material cost to make a big mac?

sorry but i think your figures are a LITTLE off... :razz: actual cost is approx 1.25 (i have insider info :D ) this includes food cost, operating cost, employee cost, overhead... you cant leave these costs out.

If they just gave it out for free, what&apos;s to stop people from just stock piling them and never buying ketchup from a grocery store?

Regular restaurants don&apos;t charge for them because it&apos;s hard to take home the ketchup from a bottle.

10 packs IS excessive even for supersized fries. If you need that much ketchup you should just gather the packs and drink it. The average size of a ketchup packet is what ? ~10g? So that is 100 g of ketchup. That is a crap load of ketchup.

tim hortons coffee is actually very similar with mcdonalds. i believe its the same beans but with a slightly different blend. tim hortons does something with their coffee that is not normally allowed (im not going to say what it is since you guys are going to call me a liar)

the coffee itself is probably less than a 10c, the cup is probably 5-8c each. but with overhead + labour, the coffee&apos;s cost really depends on the location. some stores make $5000 while others make $10000 tina t May 27th, 2006, 12:50 AM [QUOTE=Siefer999]tim hortons coffee is actually very similar with mcdonalds. i believe its the same beans but with a slightly different blend. tim hortons does something with their coffee that is not normally allowed (im not going to say what it is since you guys are going to call me a liar)

and business are looking to cut costs...if you dont ..you lose in the marketplace. its all a race to the bottom line. and cutting excessive condiment use for a restaurant is a very logical place to cut costs. gilboman May 30th, 2006, 10:08 AM They put Salt in it, doesnt everybody already know this?

this is absurd... its like taking unused crackers for soup that other customers dont use lazybum131 May 30th, 2006, 12:14 PM this is absurd... its like taking unused crackers for soup that other customers dont use
What&apos;s so absurd about it? If the restaurants moved to by request only, then I have no problem with someone who really likes their crackers in soup to be able to request four packets (two of the usual + two of the packs that I don&apos;t want).

10 pack of ketchup sounds excessive but for a Supersize I don&apos;t really think it is. The packs are so tiny that I can go through 4-5 packs easy with a medium fry. Each pack is only good for a few swipes unless you only dip in the very tip. I don&apos;t consider myself to be much of a ketchup person (family probably takes 5 years to go through a bottle).

The first Dirty Don&apos;d that tries to charge me for ketchup will be the last time I go there.

If they wont give me a reasonable amount of ketchup for free i will ask for a refund on my meal and walk out. sportsfan99 May 30th, 2006, 05:00 PM 10 packs is not within reason.4-6 any thing after that is not in reason. maebach Jun 1st, 2006, 04:46 PM I went for some large fries today, and she gave me 8 packs of ketchupo for no extra cost :| :| I only said to put a few packs of ketchup in the game.
