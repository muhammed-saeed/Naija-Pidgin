 Many of you are praying and believing for a new car, but you never clean the one you have, or change the oil, or take care of it in any fashion. Many of you are believing for a new home, but you never mow the lawn, clean the house, or paint and repair the one God has blessed you with. Many of you are asking God for a better job; however you arrive late, leave early, miss days, and barely do what is expected of you on the job that He has given you. Some of you are believing for a husband or wife. You are praying for God to bring you the best He has to offer, however you are overweight, in debt, and have done absolutely nothing to deal with the emotional baggage from past failed relationships. Now to the point…Many of you are praying for healing, however you overeat, consume food and soft drinks you know are bad for you, never get any exercise, and don&apos;t get enough sleep. This concept is called stewardship. 

 The number one excuse I hear from people is the time and effort it takes to prepare a home cooked meal. Through trial and error I have accumulated several recipes for casseroles that take less preparation time than sitting in the drive through line at your local fast food restaurant. I do not like to cook, and have found most cook books are written for people who do enjoy spending time creating a meal. Although most dieticians would tell you that these recipes have too many carbs or too many calories, I feel that I have found a happy medium between healthy food and good food. And they taste great heated in the microwave later! 

 I use a 9x12 baking pan. The reason is because a glass dish can be hot when you take it out of the dishwasher…and it will break if you drop it. Also, a glass dish may be dishwasher proof, oven proof, and refrigerator proof….however, if you accidentally turn on the burner under the dish instead of the burner for the oven, it will shatter. And yes, I do know these things from experience! I tried using small mixing bowls, and eventually bought one that is 10 inches in diameter and 4 inches deep. I also recommend buying a disposable tin baking pan if you are taking a casserole to a party, because it is also a fact that you are not likely to get your baking dish back. 

 I sliced up real chicken breasts once, and went looking for a better way. Tyson makes frozen diced chicken breasts in a bag! Life is good! I sliced up an onion once, never again. Delmonte makes little tubs of diced onion, and in the frozen food section there are bags of diced onions, and better yet is a frozen onion mix made from sliced green onions. I use ground sirloin instead of ground chuck because it really bothers me to see half of the meat disappear while I am browning it. If the recipe calls for tomato sauce, find it! If it calls for tomato paste, use it! It does make a difference, I know! And finally, don&apos;t be afraid to use a lot of spices and seasonings while preparing the casseroles, they will be bland without them.
