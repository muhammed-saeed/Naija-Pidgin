 Our
 Assistant State Attorneys are in court every working day doing their best to
 keep all of our citizens safe and to maintain the quality of life that makes
 Southwest Florida so special to all of us. Although the local media
 highlights some of the cases that we successfully prosecute, there are a great
 many of them that never get mentioned. What follows is a sampling of some
 of the convictions that our trial teams of prosecutors, investigators, and
 clerical staff, all working closely with law enforcement, have obtained this
 year. 
 
 
 State
 of Florida vs. Brown
Drug Dealer Pinched Near School 
 
 Shortly
 after classes were dismissed at a Fort Myers elementary school,
 investigators working undercover purchased cocaine from 35-year-old
 Vasco Brown of Fort Myers. The Special Investigators Unit documented
 the entire transaction, using video and audio surveillance. Prosecutor
 Stephen Schwarz proved to the jury that the transaction was within
 1000 feet of a school, and Brown was found guilty within minutes of
 deliberations for sale of cocaine within 1000 feet of a school and
 possession of cocaine. He was later sentenced to 15 years in
 prison. 
 
 State
 of Florida vs. Au
Man Shoots, Kills, and Sets Body on Fire 
 
 David
 Au drove his victim from a bar in Saint James City, stopped at his house to retrieve his gun, and then shot him in the head twice
 with a 9-millimeter Ruger. Au was driving as he fired the weapon
 towards his victim, shattering the passenger window. Prosecutor
 Hamid Hunter explained to the jury how the 37 year-old then dragged
 his victims body to a nearby dock, dosed it with gasoline, and set
 the body on fire in an attempt to dispose of it. Au declared he was
 defending himself from a perceived attack, but Hunter claimed he had
 multiple opportunities to seek help, or avoid the situation. Au was
 convicted of second-degree murder with a firearm, and was sentenced
 under 10-20-Life with a minimum mandatory 30 years in prison. 
 
 State
 of Florida vs. Young
Crack Dealer Caught on Camera 
 
 Robert
 Lee Young was found guilty of selling and possessing crack cocaine at
 a local fast food restaurant parking lot in Fort Myers. Undercover
 agents were able to purchase crack cocaine from the drug dealer while
 under full surveillance. A local concerned citizen had reported Young,
 23 years old of Fort Myers, to the Lee Countys Sheriffs Office
 Narcotics Unit as a complaint of drug dealing. Prosecutor Earl
 Fechter presented the necessary evidence to the jury to convict Young
 in less than a day. 
 
 State
 of Florida vs. Jacobs
Teenager Shoots Witness to Keep from Testifying Against His Brother 
 
 Johnny
 Jacobs was 16 when he shot Antonio Harris to keep him from coming to
 court and testifying against his brother Sheddrick. Jacobs was charged
 as an adult with aggravated battery with a firearm and shooting into
 an occupied vehicle in Fort Myers. The case was tried in January but
 ended with a hung jury. 
 Prosecutor
 Elizabeth Biffl retried the case in April and earned a conviction on
 both counts. He was sentenced to 30 years behind bars. 
 
 State
 of Florida vs. Tedder
Man Ties Up Family, Steals Cash 
 
 A
 Panama City man was convicted of home invasion and kidnapping felonies
 that occurred in Fort Myers in March 2003. Gaynor Tedder, Jr. claimed he was coerced into
 bursting into the home and tying up the victims before stealing
 thousands of dollars in cash. But the jurors didnt buy it as
 they returned a guilty verdict in less than two hours. Prosecutor
 Robert Lee praised Lee County Sheriffs deputies for arresting
 Tedder and a co-defendant five minutes before they were going back
 into the victims house a second time. Co-defendant Michael
 Lee Varnum, 32, who pled guilty in November and was sentenced to seven
 years in prison took the witness stand to testify against Tedder.
 Tedder, 40, was sentenced to life in prison. 
 
 State
 of Florida vs. Brashear
Youth Group Leader Sentenced to 5 years 
 
 In
 an emotional admission of guilt, former church youth group leader Dana
 Brashear was sentenced to five years in prison in March 2005.
 Prosecutor Scott Cupp was able to convince a panel of jurors that led
 to her conviction of lewd and lascivious battery for having sex with a
 12-year old boy. During the trial, Brashear accused the boy of lying.
 During sentencing, she admitted her guilt and apologized to the
 victims and her own family. 
  
 State
 of Florida vs. Upshaw
Premeditated Murderer Convicted 
 
 Two
 prosecutors, Anthony Kunasek and Paul Poland, worked meticulously to show the jury how Herschell Upshaw violently took part in the
 homicide of a North Fort Myers elderly resident. Upshaw, 18,
 Jessica Hill, 17, and Tessa Robinson, 18, entered Townsends home
 with intentions of robbing and killing him. The trio blindfolded and
 tied their victim as they stole his bankcard, demanded money and
 credit card pin numbers, fired three shots, left the scene and
 withdrew money from his bank account. In two and a half days of
 trial Kunasek and Poland confirmed that Upshaws role in the murder
 of Paul Townsend was prevalent and premeditated. After three hours of
 deliberations, the jury found Upshaw guilty as charged, and he was
 sentenced to life in prison. 
 
 State
 of Florida vs. Myers
Relocated Sex Offender Doesnt Register 
 
 When
 the habitual sex offender Leonard Myers was told by authorities that
 he was charged with failure to register as a sex offender he stated,
 I think its a bunch of bull. I just went on vacation and
 when I took it, I got violated. But Prosecutor Francine
 Donnorummo proved with seven witnesses that Myers did in fact relocate
 and changed his permanent address, refusing to report his new
 residence as required by Florida statute. Myers, a 43 year-old
 habitual sexual predator, was found guilty and sentenced to 21 months
 in a Florida state prison. 
 
 State
 of Florida vs. Fletcher
Teenager Shoots and Kills Mute Woman in Broad Daylight 
 
 A
 deaf mute woman was shot seven times at high noon by a 15-year old who
 carjacked her vehicle. Travis Fletcher murdered the woman in
 broad daylight because she could not scream for help. Prosecutor
 Betsy Biffl charged Fletcher as an adult and earned convictions in
 March for 2nd degree murder and carjacking with a firearm. He
 was sentenced to 25 years in prison. 
  
 State
 of Florida vs. Berube
Man Convicted of Murder as He Attempted to Escape Police 
 
 Arthur
 Berube of Lehigh Acres was convicted of murder, which arose from a
 carjacking that ended in the death of his teenage girlfriend in a
 fiery car crash while trying to outrun police. Prosecutor Dean
 Plattner proved Berube was under the influence of cocaine and alcohol
 while driving at speeds up to 100 mph as he tried to get away from
 Fort Myers police and Lee County Sheriffs deputies. The 2nd degree
 murder charge, along with DUI manslaughter, carjacking, and several
 other charges netted Berube 25 years in prison. 
 
 State
 of Florida vs. Denis
Child Rapist Receives Life Sentence 
 
 Prosecutor
 Francine Donnorummo provided evidence to a panel of jurors convicting
 Robert Denis of sexual battery upon a child less than 12 years of age.
 Denis had committed sexual battery upon a 10-year old. The lack of
 support from the mother of the victim and her community did not stop
 Donnorummo as she called five witnesses, carefully showing how the 39
 year-old had sexually abused the young child over a period of a year.
 The jury agreed and Denis was sentenced to life in prison. 
 
 State
 of Florida vs. Barker
Home Invader Beats Man to Death 
 
 John
 Barker II bragged to anyone who would listen about killing North Fort
 Myers contractor Michael Livolsi. Along with his brother, the 25-year
 old Barker hog-tied, beat to death, and robbed 40-year old Livolsi
 during a home invasion. Assistant State Attorney Betsy Biffl called to
 the stand Livolsis brother Chris who described how he was the first
 to discover his brothers beaten body. Livolsi died ten days later.
 Within two hours after hearing closing arguments, the jury returned a
 guilty as charged verdict for 2nd degree murder and home invasion
 robbery. Barker faces life in prison. His 24-year old brother, John
 Barker III, will be tried on the same charges later in the year. 
 
 State
 of Florida vs. Castaneda
Twenty Four-Year Old Rapes Young Girl 
 
 Jose
 Castaneda invited a young girl, 14, to the drive-in theater in North
 Fort Myers. Castaneda, 24, of Fort Myers, then committed sexual
 battery upon his victim, forcing himself upon her. Lonely, scared, and
 violated, the victim did not report the incident until two weeks
 later. Castaneda was arrested, charged, and found guilty of lewd or
 lascivious battery. Prosecutor Daniel Cavanaugh convinced the jury as
 a judge claimed Castaneda a registered sexual predator and sentenced
 him to 12 years in prison. 
 
 State
 of Florida vs. Rosier
Execution Style Shooting Doesnt Stop Victim from Identifying
 Defendant 
 
 Willie
 Dallas, a resident of Fort Myers, awoke to a young man knocking on his
 door covered with blood. He immediately called 911 and authorities
 found Kevin Henry, 19, of Clewiston, FL sitting on Dallas porch,
 half naked and soaked in blood with two gunshot wounds to the head.
 After Henry awoke from his medically induced coma 19 days later, he
 was able to identify to investigators Reashod Rosier, 22, of Fort
 Myers as the shooter. Prosecutor Paul Poland presented to the jury how
 the defendant Rosier held Henry at gunpoint, forced him to take his
 clothes off to search for money, and then had the victim lay face down
 while firing two shots into the head of Henry. The jury found Rosier
 guilty of attempted 1st degree murder with a firearm and robbery with
 a firearm, and sentenced him to life in prison. 
 
 State
 of Florida vs. Edison, Edison, Gordon, and Persons
Fort Myers Drug Gang Convicted 
 
 Courtroom
 security was tight as Prosecutor Jean Paul Galasso presented his case
 to the jury against four co-defendants, Alonzo Edison, George Edison,
 Ceon Gordon, and Tony Persons for trafficking in cocaine. These
 co-defendants have an extensive record, but in the past, prosecution
 was thwarted as the witnesses, out of fear of retaliation,
 disappeared. This group was a big part of the drug trade in the city.
 They were also suspected of being involved in drug shootings prior to
 their arrest. Evidence presented revolved around drug house
 surveillance by the Fort Myers Department. The S.W.A.T. Team raided
 the premises and found drugs being processed and prepared for
 distribution. The jury returned in less than an hour with a guilty
 verdict. Each defendant could get up to 30 years in prison. 
 
 State
 of Florida vs. Jacobs
Convicted Felon Gives False Name, Caught with Firearm 
 
 Last
 October police pulled over Sheddrick Jacobs for driving without
 taillights. When the officer asked for a name, Jacobs provided a false
 name and birth date. The officer was not convinced as he accessed the
 DHSMV motor records database from his patrol car. After the arrest,
 police found a loaded Ruger Mark 1 .22 caliber handgun under the
 drivers seat. Jacobs had a prior record of convictions of two felonies
 involving grand theft of a motor vehicle. In court, prosecutor
 Elizabeth Biffl explained to a jury the consequences for a convicted
 felon in possession of a firearm. The verdict was guilty as charged on
 all three counts including possession of firearm by a convicted felon,
 driving with a suspended license, and giving a false name. Jacobs was
 sentenced to 11 years in a Florida state prison. 
 
 State
 of Florida vs. Stairs
Sexual Predator Behind Bars for Life 
 
 Marc
 Stairs had been sexually abusing his victim, aged 7, for over a year
 and a half before she reported his behavior. Working carefully with
 witnesses and evidence, Prosecutor Daniel Cavanaugh wanted to make
 sure that Stairs never encounters a child again by concluding the jury
 trial in a verdict of guilty. Stairs, 39, of Lehigh Acres, was found
 guilty of 2 counts of sexual battery upon a child less than 12 years
 of age, 1 count of molestation, and 1 count of lewd or lascivious
 exhibition. Stairs was sentenced to life in prison in February. 
 
 State
 of Florida vs. Williams
Bus Attendant Guilty of Battery Upon Special Needs School Boy, 7 
 
 A
 Lee County Elementary School bus attendant was found guilty of battery
 for slapping one of the passenger students. Betty Williams, 50, of
 Fort Myers, had slapped a seven year-old special needs student while
 riding the school bus. The victim was left with a red mark across the
 face that could be seen the following day. Prosecutor Ana Hall called
 several eyewitnesses, who identified Williams striking the young
 schoolboy. Williams was found guilty and sentenced to 1-year county
 probation, anger management counseling, and 100 hours of community
 service. 
 
 State
 of Florida vs. Hutchins
Man Convicted of Kidnapping, Raping, and Beating Woman 
 
 Cecil

 as she was waiting for a friend at a local store. Hutchins, 27, of
 Fort Myers, then drove his victim to a nearby field, beat and raped
 her, and told her to report that unknown men had jumped her.
 Investigators soon heard the true story, and were able to charge
 Hutchins with sexual battery with great force and kidnapping. After
 the defendants arrest he stated, I wrote a letter to the Judge,
 and I dont want to get a lot of time for something I didnt
 do. Prosecutor Francine Donnorummo worked diligently through the
 week long trial, showing evidence that even included matching dental
 bite marks left on the victims face. Hutchins was found guilty by a
 jury trial and was sentenced to 25 years. 
 
 State
 of Florida vs. Sands
Man Secretly Records Woman in Bathroom and Bedroom 
 
 Kenneth
 Sands had a secret in his house in Fort Myers. Sands, 49, had a
 separate room where he would receive live video and audio feeds from
 the bedroom and bathroom of his victim. Sands conveniently placed
 micro cameras in carbon monoxide detectors in the two separate rooms
 where he would watch and record his victim undress and shower.
 Evidence also shows that Sands edited his tapes, and placed them in a
 collection. Prosecutor Carlos Cavenago had plenty of footage to
 convict the defendant, who later pled guilty to all three counts of
 voyeurism. Sands received 90 days in Lee County Jail and 3 years of
 probation with an order for sex counseling to follow. 
 
 State
 of Florida vs. Sluyter
Child Rapist Caught by Eyewitnesses 
 
 In
 November of 2001, neighbors heard screams from Patrick Sluyters
 residence. After peering into the window, eyewitnesses saw a sexual battery in progress
 involving Sluyter and a 10-year old girl. The neighbors notified the
 police immediately, dispatching the authorities that also witnessed
 the crime. Police quickly arrested Sluyter, 41, of Cape Coral and
 placed him in custody. In court, Prosecutor Daniel Cavanaugh proved
 the defendant has been sexually involved with the girl for over a
 period of a year, leaving the jury to confirm a guilty verdict of 2
 counts of capital sexual battery. In March, Sluyter was sentenced and
 will be imprisoned for the remainder of his natural life. 
 
 State
 of Florida vs. Brown

 A
 prison release re-offender was sentenced to 30-years in prison for
 aggravated battery while using a weapon, and five years in prison for

 in his bed with a claw hammer. 
 
 State
 of Florida vs. Bell
16-year old murders to retrieve cell phone 
 
 When

 it. Prosecutors Jean-Paul Galasso and Carrie Pollock proved to the
 jury that Bell committed the murder to protect his drug turf. 
 
 State
 of Florida vs. Dooley
 Man Walks Out of Crack House, Robs Driver 
 
 In
 less than an hour, a Lee County jury found Michael Lee Dooley, 29,
 guilty of robbery. The defendant took the stand telling jurors that
 when he came out of a crack house where he went to but the drug, he
 saw a smaller man losing a street fight and jumped in to help. But
 when prosecutor Linda Smith called the victim to the stand, he said a
 truck had blocked the road when he was driving home from work in

 and Dooley grabbed him taking $16 from his wallet. Dooley still faces
 a separate trial on another robbery. 
 
 State
 of Florida vs. Moringiello
Millionaire Found Guilty of Murdering Wife 
 
 Aeronautical
 engineer Donald Moringiello, 65, of Fort Myers Beach, shot his wife in
 the chest four times, tied concrete blocks around her ankles and neck,
 and dumped the body in a bay 100 yards from their residence. Hattie
 Fern Bergeler was later found, yet authorities could not
 identify her body. Moringiello never reported her missing. A niece
 from Alabama did, which led to his arrest. Police found the weapon
 hidden underwater behind a seawall, blood and DNA evidence inside the
 home, and matching concrete blocks outside the Moringiello residence.
 Prosecutors Elizabeth Biffl and Scott Cupp worked diligently
 throughout the six-day trial. The case was first tried last year, as
 Hurricane Charley slammed Fort Myers. The jury could not reach a
 verdict, and a mistrial was declared. This time, after only two hours
 of jury deliberations, Moringiello was convicted of second-degree

 occurred. Macias raped the 12-year old once on the bathroom
 floor of his Naples home and fondled her numerous other times,
 according to her testimony. Macias was convicted of sexual

 lewd and lascivious molestation. He was sentenced to 15 years in
 prison. 
 
 State
 of Florida vs. Edgard

 When
 a 11-year old girl had told her mother that their neighbor had raped
 her, Collier County Sheriffs were immediately dispatched to Jean
 Edgards apartment. Edgard, 31, of Immokalee, was asked a few
 questions outside his house before he subsequently urinated himself
 while standing on his front lawn with the authorities. After a

 of sexual abuse of a 12-year old boy over a two-year period. The
 28-year old defendant met his victim through an Internet Chatroom in
 2001. When Holland traveled to Naples from his home in Texas, he
 met the boy at the motel in which he was staying. The defense
 argued that the sex was consensual and that the boy was more sexually
 experienced than the defendant. Prosecutor Rob Crown told the
 jury, Neither the victims lack of chastity nor his consent is a
 defense. 
 
 State
 of Florida vs. Sniffen

 State
 of Florida vs. Searle
Man Charges at Deputies with Machete 
 
 A
 Bonita Springs man was convicted of aggravated assault on a law
 enforcement officer after he charged out of his home confronting
 deputies with a machete. Throughout the trial, the defense tried
 to show the Charles Searle, 39, thought the two officers were kids or
 hoodlums trying to burglarize his home or van and the machete
 was to frighten them away. Prosecutors Andrea Canizares and

 Marvin
 Owens, a jewelry business owner, left his house early in the morning
 to began work. As he climbed into his van with a suitcase full
 of jewelry valued at over $200,000.00, a man approached with a handgun
 demanding the suitcase and the keys to the van. The man
 threatened to kill Owens if he did not comply, he then took the
 briefcase full of jewelry, and fled the area with the van. Coincidently, a woman was contacted if she would like to buy some
 jewelry. She happened to know Owens personally, and even
 recognized some of his stolen jewelry that was for sale. After
 contacting authorities, members of the Charlotte County Sheriffs
 Office conducted a controlled buy of jewelry at the same location
 purchasing $600.00, and at a later date, arrangements to purchase
 $15,000.00 worth of jewelry. That same night, a search warrant
 was served and three people were arrested including Savario Pitts, 24,
 of Port Charlotte. In court, prosecutor Martin Stark called 10
 witnesses to prove Pitts guilt in the crime. After an
 exhausting three-day trial, Pitts was convicted of robbery with a
 deadly weapon, carjacking with a weapon, and dealing in stolen
 property. He was later sentenced to 30 years in prison. 
 
 State
 of Florida vs. Perez
Con-Artist Impersonates Law Enforcement Officer, Commits Home Invasion 
 
 When
 homeowner Frank Edwards, 66, of Port Charlotte answered his door, he
 met a man who claimed to be a police officer. The man wore a
 handgun and a portable radio, and told Edwards that he had been
 implicated for dealing and possessing narcotics. Edwards and his
 tenant were zip-tied behind their backs and informed that they were
 under arrest. As the victims lay face down and defenseless, the
 fake police officer, who would later be identified as James Perez, 34,
 of Port Charlotte, and two others disguised as a criminal and a
 officer, ransacked the house and stole money, bank cards, and firearms
 owned by Edwards. Perez and his team left Edwards home and
 were subsequently caught by authorities. In a two-day jury
 trial, prosecutor Martin Stark confirmed the charges against Perez,
 which included home invasion robbery possessing a firearm, burglary
 while armed, and falsely personating an officer during a commission of
 a crime. In just 40 minutes of deliberations, the jury returned

 State
 of Florida vs. Hoefer

 The
 owner of a gymnastics facility in Charlotte County, Robert Hoefer, had
 secretly taped five 8-year old girls using the bathroom of his gym to
 change into leotards before going to gymnastic practice. The
 defense argued that Hoefer set up the surveillance equipment to catch
 a cheerleader he believed was stealing leotards. Prosecutor
 Claudel Trajan argued there would be no reason to set up expensive
 equipment to catch a thief who could not fit into the clothes of an
 8-year old. The jury found Hoefer guilty of 8 counts of
 voyeurism. 
 
 State
 of Florida vs. Cox
Persistence doesnt always pay off 
 
 For
 Mr. Ray Wertz and Ms. Janet Hansen, cigarette ashes were enough to
 make them crime victims. John Cox, 45, of North Port, became
 enraged when Mr. Wertz unknowingly flicked cigarette ash out of his
 window into his vehicle. After gesturing that ash had gotten
 into his eyes, Mr. Wertz apologized but was cut off by Cox. In
 order to avoid further contact, Wertz drove around and off but was
 ambushed after Cox sped past and hid behind a sign. Upon Mr.
 Wertzs vehicle approaching, Cox threw a handful of gravel and hit
 both Wertz and Hansen with rocks and shells from the roads
 shoulder.  

 Prosecutor
 Andreas Gardiner argued that the defendant was guilty by proving to
 the jury how he threw rocks and gravel at their vehicle, which could
 have caused much more tragic consequences. After a two-day
 trial, the jury deliberated for three and one half hours and returned
 a verdict of guilty for Throwing a Deadly Missile at a Vehicle. 
 
 State
 of Florida vs. Barker III 

 Second
 brother convicted in robbery and homicide 
 
 In
 September of 2003, brothers John Barker II, 25, and John Barker III,
 24, of North Fort Myers, broke into the home of Michael Livolsi with
 the intentions of committing a robbery. During the commission of
 the crime, Livolsi was hogtied, fiercely beaten and left for dead in
 his home. The beating he sustained was so violent, Livolsi never
 again regained consciousness and died nine days later. 

 John
 Barker II was charged and convicted of 2nd degree murder and home
 invasion robbery and sentenced to life imprisonment plus 30 years in
 May. This was due to the hard work of Assistant State Attorney
 Betsy Biffl who provided the sequence of events and the maliciousness
 of the crimes to the jury for a guilty verdict. In August,
 prosecutor Biffl also won the conviction of John Barker III for
 manslaughter and home invasion robbery. He now faces life in
 prison.  

 Due
 to Barker IIIs prior criminal record, he can be sentenced to life
 imprisonment plus additional years under Florida&apos;s Habitual Felony
 Offender Statue. 
 
 State
 of Florida vs. Travis
Disagreement leads to murder 
 
 A
 jury decided the fate of a Lehigh Acres man after a three-day trial
 and one and a half hours of deliberating. Dorris Travis, 60, of
 Lehigh Acres, was convicted of second-degree murder for the stabbing
 death of 50-year-old Michael Range.  

 Prosecutors
 Stephen Schwarz and Earl Fechter presented the scenario to jurors
 describing how after a brief disagreement at the local Moose Lodge,
 the two went in different directions to the outside of the building. After a few moments, a couple patrons began to look for Range who was
 found outside the front entrance fighting off Travis, but to no avail. During the altercation, Travis had repeatedly stabbed his victim
 causing his untimely death.
