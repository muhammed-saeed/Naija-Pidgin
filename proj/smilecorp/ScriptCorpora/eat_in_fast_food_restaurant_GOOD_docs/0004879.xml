 July 7, 2012 Rajanee Thai Cuisine Mobile review by maha ( 1 review ) This my favorite little restaurant in Mililani, and the food is wonderful, definately better than the competitor&apos;s. We often get take out since this is a little hole in the wall on the deserted side of the stripmall with outdoor seating. Best i Mililani, perhaps on Oahu for Thai food. July 7, 2012 Island Fish&amp;Chips Mobile review by Jmj ( 3 reviews ) Nothing fancy... Just a walk up counter for fish and chips and grilled sandwiches, etc. but the sandwich was tasty (with an above average tomato!!!). Good for a low key, less expensive meal. June 30, 2012 Steak Shack OMG delish! by Erin ( 44 reviews ) Went here almost a year ago and I still dream about this place. SOOOOOOOOO Good!
