&apos;Sit-in&apos; at fast food drive-in, knife thrust result in indictments

CLINTON - The enraged customer staged a sit-in at the drive-in window of a fast food restaurant, refusing to leave and then waving a knife at an employee, indictments unveiled today indicate.

The May 2010 incident at the McDonald&apos;s Restaurant on Illinois Avenue in Oak Ridge netted three charges against Laketta E. Bingham, 22, of Knoxville.

She was indicted this month by an Anderson County grand jury for attempted aggravated assault, obstructing a highway or other passageway and disorderly conduct.

Bingham was reportedly causing a disturbance at the drive-in window and was asked by management to leave.

She instead stayed at the window, blocking other customers and prompting employee Tara Pfeiffer to come outside and take other customers&apos; orders, according to the arrest warrant.

Pfeiffer brushed against Bingham&apos;s car several times while walking back and forth, refused service for Bingham and told her to leave, the warrant states.

Bingham produced a folding knife that she thrust out the car window and waved at Pfeiffer, it alleges.

Free on bond, Bingham faces arraignment Aug. 5 in Anderson County Criminal Court.

More details as they develop online and in Saturday&apos;s News Sentinel.

&quot;Laketta&quot;?? Who makes up these names? Laketta, you need to be warming your but in a jail cell instead of being out on bond. With your temper, those restaurant workers are not safe. Get some anger management help as soon as you can.

I feel ya pain LaQuinta! The next time I go through Wendy&apos;s drive-thru, Ima lose it when they don&apos;t put my extra sour cream in da bag!!

It takes every fiber of my being to not say something REALLY UGLY when I have to haul my big butt back to the restaurant because a fast food place can&apos;t get your very simple order right! It&apos;s ain&apos;t rocket surgery or nuthin&apos; to push little buttons with pictures, throw together some grade D cow and jam it in a paper sack.

I suspect ol&apos; LaQuinta was finally pushed too far.

Oh and the comment about her sweatin&apos; gravy? Pricelessly awesome.

*Yes. I know; I deliberately wrote, &apos;Rocket surgery&apos; and all of the other misspellinks.*

Haven&apos;t heard&quot;Whammy Burger&quot;in a long time. It was a hamburger with a slice of pineapple. Do you remember the name of the drive-in on Kingston Pike that served it?

Man, when did they start having that? I might have to hit the drive thru. But seriously folks, I used to see pinto and beans on the menu board of local delis. When I&apos;d tell that to the folks in Ohio or New York when I worked up there, they&apos;d just roll their eyes and mutter something about dumb rednecks.

Trust me, New York (state) has plenty of rednecks! We lived at Ft. Drum five years, and it was filled with dairy farms. Kids went to school with manure on their boots because they did their chores before going to school. There were hard feelings against us; military families were not welcomed when we first arrived in 1987, even though it meant thousands of high paying civilian jobs to an economically disadvantaged area.

There were NO minorities, so the thought of ten thousand soldiers, many married with families, living in the surrounding area, was frightening. There was very little on post housing, no schools or hospitals, so we were much more enmeshed with the local population than usual, to help their economy, but they saw it as an invasion. The fact that many of us couldn&apos;t drive in their 6 months of snow didn&apos;t help.

When you see pickups with gun racks and confederate flags 30 miles south of Canada, it&apos;s a safe bet they ain&apos;t flying it to show pride in their&quot;Southern Heritage&quot;roflbo!!

I betcha the men had at least as many fishing rods and hunting guns than men down here have, probably more. Lots more were into chewing tobacco, eeeew!!

I saw more rednecks there in a week than I see here in a month. Ohio is rural, too. There are even rednecks in Germany, but I never found out what they were called. Oh, and I got a little redneck in me, when the situation calls for it. Bet you do, too, Sherry.
