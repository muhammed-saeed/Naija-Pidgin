 A. Imagine this: Youve been driving around all day doing
errands and 

 it is about
time for dinner. You dont want to go
home to a dirty 

 kitchen and try
to scrounge up something to eat, so what do you do? 

   

 B. A
common choice these days is to eat out. But where do you go? 

 According

 patronize 160,000
different fast-food restaurants every day ( Clark 38).

of the leaders in this industry is McDonalds. As an assistant 

 manager at
McDonalds, I deal with customer satisfaction much of 

 the time. I have to know what make the
customers want to come back. 

   

 D. Today
I would like to discuss what influences customers choice of fast food
restaurant. With research and personal
experience, I have found three major factors are correlated with a restaurants
success. These factors are: good value, fast service, and a quality
product.

into play.
