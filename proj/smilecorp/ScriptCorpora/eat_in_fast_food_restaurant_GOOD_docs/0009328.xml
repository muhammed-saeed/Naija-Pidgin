 Disaster-Related Benefits 

 What is DUA? back to top 

 

 

 Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) is a federal unemployment assistance program that provides compensation for individuals whose employment or self-employment has been lost or interrupted as a direct result of a major disaster, but who are not eligible for regular unemployment insurance (UI). A major disaster is a natural catastrophe such as a severe storm, hurricane, tornado, straight-line winds, and associated flooding that resulted in a Presidential declaration of a disaster. A Presidential declaration is made when it is determined governmental assistance is needed for communities and individuals directly affected by the disaster. 

 Who may apply for DUA? back to top 

 

 

 Any individual who is unemployed as a direct result of a declared disaster may apply for DUA. This includes self-employed business people, farmers, loggers, commissioned-paid employees and others whose unemployment occurred as a direct result of a declared disaster, but who are not eligible for the state&apos;s regular unemployment insurance program. 

 How do I apply for DUA? back to top 

 

 

 To apply for DUA, visit any Georgia Department of Labor career center and file an unemployment insurance claim. Present valid government issued picture identification and your social security number. If self-employed, have proof of earnings for the most recently completed income tax year, such as:
 Copies of the most recently completed income tax returns Copies of quarterly estimated income tax payments records Similar documents

 DUA benefits are subject to federal and state tax. Individuals may elect to have federal and/or state taxes deducted from their DUA payments. Individuals will receive IRS Form 1099-G to file with their income tax return. 
 
 

 
 
 Education, Training, and WIA 

 What is WIA? back to top 

 

 

 WIA stands for the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, implemented in Georgia in July 2000. This federal legislation has helped Georgia move toward a comprehensive, customer-focused workforce investment system where Job Seeker and Employer customers alike can access a wide range of workforce-related tools and information they need to manage their work lives. Services are provided through a network of One-Stop Centers statewide.

 Workforce Investment Act (WIA) Summary for Job Seekers 

 What is a &quot;One-Stop&quot; Center? back to top 

 

 

 The Workforce Investment Act (WIA) requires that each service delivery area (there are 20 in Georgia) have at least one comprehensive or full-service One-Stop Center. A One-Stop Center is a place where Employers and Job Seekers can access a wide range of workforce services. In Georgia, there are over 45 &quot;full-service&quot; One-Stop Centers, and most areas have several other locations for customers to access workforce services also. A majority of the full-service locations are GDOL Career Centers, while others are separate facilities. Many different education, training, and employment-related services available in the community are also provided by various partner agencies at the One-Stop Center or through referrals.

 Find a One-Stop Center (by county) 
 

 Does &quot;One-Stop&quot; mean I only have to go one place for all of the workforce services I need? back to top 

 

 

 At a One-Stop Center, every effort is made to make it as easy and convenient as possible for Employer and Job Seeker customers to get the customized services they need. Many customers will be able to get everything they need from a single location, during a single visit or multiple visits. Other customers may need services that are not available onsite. In these situations, One-Stop staff will facilitate necessary linkages and referrals. 

 How do I find out where to go for workforce services in my community? back to top 

 

 

 There are 20 Workforce Investment Act (WIA) service areas in Georgia, and each area has at least one comprehensive or full-service One-Stop Workforce Center providing services. Most areas have several locations for accessing services. These service access points may include GDOL career centers, One-Stop Centers, technical colleges, Voc Rehab offices, Department of Family and Children Services (DFCS) offices, or other community based organizations.

 Find Us 

Select GDOL Career Centers, GDOL Voc Rehab Offices, or One-Stop Centers, depending on your specific needs, and the county or city in which you are interested. 

 Do all One-Stop Centers offer the same services? back to top 

 

 

 While One-Stops offer many of the same services, there are differences among One-Stops services based on the needs of customers in the community. For example, while all One-Stops provide workforce resource areas with a variety of self-service options online or through books, videos, or pamphlets, a One-Stop Center may offer specialized services for Hispanic employers and job seekers, or youth. Contact the center in your community to learn about specific services available.
 

 I just got laid off and am collecting Unemployment Insurance. Can WIA help me? back to top 

 

 

 Yes. Services to dislocated workers are a major component of WIA activities. You may also be eligible for Trade services, which assist individuals who have become unemployed as a result of increased imports from, or shifts in production to, foreign countries. Please contact your local One-Stop Center to inquire about the services that are right for you. 

 Does each of the 20 local workforce areas in Georgia have its own web site? back to top 

 

 

 Most of the areas either have their own web site, or are a part of their administrative entity&apos;s web site (for example, a city government or a Regional Development Center).

 Find a One-Stop Center 

Local area web sites are listed on the left-hand side of the drop-down box that appears once you have selected a county. 

 Do One-Stop Centers serve persons with disabilities? back to top 

 

 

 Yes. Georgia&apos;s local One-Stops have been designed and equipped to ensure that all customers can access the services and programs they need. One-Stops comply with accessibility and reasonable accommodation provisions of the Workforce Investment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards, and the Georgia Accessibility Code. Additionally, One-Stops can provide adaptations to help customers with visual, hearing, mobility, and cognitive or language impairments access services. 

 Can I access workforce resources from my computer at home or from my office? back to top 

 

 

 Yes, many excellent workforce resources for both Employers and Job Seekers are available online starting with the wide range of services and links available through this Georgia Department of Labor web site. Some customers can get everything they need without ever coming into a One-Stop Center. Other customers begin their research and exploration of services at home, and then visit a One-Stop Center for staff assistance. Yet other customers prefer to visit their local One-Stop, or do not have access to a computer at home.
 

 Can I apply for Unemployment Insurance (UI) online from home? Can I apply for Unemployment Insurance (UI) at a One-Stop Workforce Center? How do I find out where to apply? back to top 

 

 

 Unemployment claims can be filed in person at any Georgia Department of Labor (GDOL) career center (which in some cases may also be a full-service One-Stop Center) or by Internet from any computer with appropriate Internet access. After the initial claim, weekly recertification can be done from any Internet accessible computer - including from home, a public library, a One-Stop center, a GDOL career center, or other location.

To file an unemployment claim via the Internet you must have a valid email address. This email account should be your personal email address because private and confidential information about your claim will be sent to this email address.

 A friend of mine was just approved for WIA-funded On-the-Job Training (OJT) with an employer in our community. What exactly is OJT? back to top 

 

 

 In On-the-Job Training, 
 participants are actually employed and trained by an employer. 
 The employer is reimbursed up to 50 percent of the wage 
 rate of the participant for a limited period of time, 
 to help defray the costs of providing the training and 
 additional supervision related to the training. In other 
 words, OJT may help Job Seeker customers get a foot in 
 the door with a new employer interested in taking advantage 
 of this financial incentive. 

 I am currently employed, but I&apos;ve realized I need additional training in order to get promoted in my field - I&apos;m just not sure what kind of program would best help me achieve my career goals. Is there someone I can talk with about this? back to top 

 

 

 Yes. A knowledgeable career advisor at a GDOL Career Center or other One-Stop Center can introduce you to a variety of resources to help you make a more informed decision, and will provide career counseling as needed. In the meantime, there are many links on the GDOL web site you might want to visit to get started.

 Learn About Education and Training 

 Can WIA pay for my training? back to top 

 

 

 Potential resources available to students in Georgia include Workforce Investment Act (WIA) funds, Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally (HOPE), Pell, assistance from entities serving specific populations (e.g., persons receiving Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), older workers, youth), scholarships, and grants. A career advisor at a GDOL career center or other One-Stop Center can help you explore available resources, eligibility criteria, schools and programs, career options, and all of the other things you need to consider before making an application for training. The career advisor will also introduce you to the Individual Training Account (ITA) Eligible Provider/Program List that displays the training programs in Georgia eligible for WIA funding. 

 What is an Individual Training Account (ITA)? back to top 

 

 

 ITA stands for the Individual Training Account system, the primary way for Georgia&apos;s adults and dislocated workers to access Workforce Investment Act (WIA) funded occupational training. An Individual Training Account (ITA) is essentially a voucher given to customers who need occupational skills training to become gainfully employed or reemployed. Supported by assessment and informed decision making, customers may use their ITAs to purchase training slots in any program on the eligible program/provider list. Since each of the 20 local workforce boards in Georgia may establish monetary, categorical, and time limits for such vouchers there may be differences among areas.

 ITA Eligible Provider/Program List 

 What training providers are eligible to receive Workforce Investment Act (WIA) training services under the Individual Training Account (ITA)? back to top 

 

 

 Providers and their programs 
 eligible to apply for approval/certification under WIA 
 include universities, colleges, community colleges, technical 
 institutes, some proprietary schools, apprenticeship programs, 
 public and private training providers - including entities 
 such as vocational-technical schools, community and faith-based 
 organizations, private training companies, labor organizations, 
 employer organizations, and private individuals.

Prospective training providers are required to submit applications covering each individual program or course of study proposed for certification - as programs, not providers, are certified through this process.

Please contact the One-Stop in your local workforce area to learn more about the Individual Training Account Eligible Provider/Program system in your area.

 Find a One-Stop Center (by county) 

 Although it is referred to as an ITA &quot;Eligible Provider List,&quot; isn&apos;t it actually certified program(s) and courses of study that enable a provider to be listed? back to top 

 

 

 Yes. Application and inclusion on the list are based on approved individual courses of study, not the provider who operates them. Therefore, providers must submit information with their application addressing each program they would like included on the statewide Eligible Provider list. 

 How do Community Based Organizations (CBOs) and Faith-Based Organizations (FBOs) that provide training fit within the ITA eligible provider system? back to top 

 

 

 Under WIA, CBOs and FBOs are important partners in Georgia&apos;s workforce system. They may be certified as eligible providers, along with all other providers of adult training services under WIA, by submitting an application to be placed on the statewide Eligible Program/Provider list. In some cases, due to an exception to the ITA system, a different approval process is followed. 

 What criteria are used to determine who does and who does not get an Individual Training Account (ITA)? Is it based only on economic need? back to top 

 

 

 No. Each local workforce board (there are 20 in Georgia) defines local criteria for providing ITAs based on critical local workforce needs. For example, criteria may be set related to economic development priorities, occupations in demand in the area, and expected wage levels - so long as the criteria are reasonable and uniformly applied. 

 What career direction is provided to customers? back to top 

 

 

 Local workforce staff may inform customers and facilitate career decisions. However, the ultimate training decision rests with the customer within defined local policies and parameters. The career advisor&apos;s role is to provide customers with guidance and feedback from assessment that can help them understand their needs and choices prior to selection of a training program/provider. 

 Is there a maximum ITA dollar amount? back to top 

 

 

 Yes. ITA accounts are the responsibility of local workforce boards, which may establish total and categorical caps, length of time, mechanisms for payment, and other criteria. 

 Are youth eligible to receive Individual Training Accounts (ITA)? back to top 

 

 

 Although there are some exceptions for older youth age 18-21, the ITA system primarily serves adults. 

 Can I receive WIA services if I&apos;m only 16? back to top 

 

 

 Yes. A variety of services are available through local area workforce systems to youth age 14-21, either through WIA directly or through workforce partners. Examples include career exploration, occupational skills training, mentoring, apprenticeships, basic skills training, literacy training, and work experience. Youth services are not, however, generally provided through the ITA system. 

 Are the &quot;rules&quot; for WIA the same for all local workforce investment areas? back to top 

 

 

 Although there are broad federal Workforce Investment Act (WIA) guidelines that guide all 20 local areas in Georgia, there is also great flexibility for local areas to develop policies and procedures that meet the unique needs of their communities. Please contact the One-Stop Center in your local workforce area to learn more about your particular local workforce system.

 Find a One-Stop Center (by county) 

 At the state level, who is responsible for overseeing the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) workforce system in Georgia? back to top 

 

 

 The Governor designated the Georgia Department of Labor (GDOL) as the state agency responsible for overseeing Georgia&apos;s workforce system.

 Can my employer require me to perform duties not included in my job description? back to top 

 

 

 Yes. The Fair Labor Standards Act does not limit the types of work employees 18 and over may be required to perform. This is true whether or not the work asked of the employee is listed on the job description. 

 Is my employer required to pay a higher rate if I work during the weekend or at night? back to top 

 

 

 Extra pay for working weekends or at night is a matter of agreement between the employer and the employee (or the employee&apos;s representative). The Fair Labor Standards Act does not require extra pay for weekend or night work. It does require 1 and 1/2 the regular rate of pay for time worked over 40 hours in a workweek for nonexempt employees.

 Isn&apos;t my employer required to give me breaks and a meal period? back to top 

 

 

 Neither the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) nor Georgia law requires breaks or meal periods be given to workers. However, many employers do provide breaks and meal periods, even though discretionary with the employer. Breaks of short duration, from 5 to 20 minutes, are common. The FLSA requires that workers be compensated during short break periods; however, an employer does not have to compensate workers meal periods of thirty minutes or more, as long as the workers are free to use the meal period time as they wish and are not required to perform work during that time.

 What are the fastest growing occupations in Georgia? back to top 

 

 

 Occupational growth is defined using projections data. These data list the fastest growing jobs (percentage of growth), largest job growth (numerical growth), most annual openings, etc. Eight of the 20 fastest growing jobs are related to health services and five are related to computer technology. Fastest growing occupations, defined as a percentage of new growth, also have a minimum of 100 annual openings. Additionally, more than half of these occupations have higher than average wages. Occupations with a high percentage of growth, 100 or more openings per year and higher than average wages earn the distinction of being a &quot;hot job&quot;.

Occupational projections are published in Georgia Workforce 2014 Long-term Employment Trends and Georgia Area Workforce Trends (local workforce investment act areas).

 What is the average salary for Georgia workers with a college degree? High school diploma? High school dropout? back to top 

 

 

 The U.S. Census Bureau reported that college definitely pays. Workers age 18 and over with a Bachelor&apos;s degree earn an average of $51,206 a year, while those with a high school diploma earn $27,915. Workers without a high school diploma average $18,734. An advanced degree earns workers an average of $74,602. These data were collected in the Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS) for 2004.

Current Population Surveys from 1998, 1999 and 2000 were used to estimate Synthetic Work-Life Earnings Estimates. These estimates show that over a lifetime (age 24-65), the differences in earned income are far more significant. Workers without a high school diploma will earn less than $1.0 million in their lifetime. Those with a high school diploma will earn $1.2 million. Workers with a Bachelor&apos;s degree will earn $2.1 million and an advanced degree will earn 2.5 million.

 Where can I get information about my reemployment rights if I was called up for active reserve duty? back to top 

 

 

 Certain persons who serve in the armed forces have a right to reemployment with the employer they were with when they entered service. This includes those called up from the reserves or National Guard. These rights are administered by the Veterans Employment and Training Service of the USDOL.

 FAQs for Reservists Being Called to Active Duty 

 I quit my job and my employer refuses to pay me for my last week worked. What can I do? back to top 

 

 

 Often employers and workers disagree over final amounts due. The Fair Labor Standards Act requires that employees be paid at least minimum wage for all hours worked, and time and a half for any overtime hours worked; salaried personnel must also be paid. The USDOL Wage and Hour Division enforces these requirements, but enforcement may be slow. The practical alternative is to file a claim for wages against the employer in the small claims court (Magistrate Court) in the county where the employer is located. Although the worker will have to pay a filing fee, that filing fee can be collected along with wages if the court rules in the worker&apos;s favor. 

 How can an employer fire me under &quot;Employment-at-Will&quot; if Georgia is a &quot;Right-to-Work&quot; state? back to top 

 

 

 Georgia is a &quot;Right-to-Work&quot; state. This means that workers may not be required to join a union or make payments to a union as a condition of employment. This protects a worker who is not hired, or is fired, due to refusal or unwillingness to join a union only.

 UI Extended Benefits 

 How many unemployment insurance benefit extension programs are available in Georgia? back to top 

 

 

 There is currently one unemployment insurance benefit extension program to assist individuals out of work through no fault of their own. 

 Is there a possibility of more extensions? back to top 

 

 

 The President and US Congress can enact legislation to create further extensions. If another extension occurs after you exhaust your benefits, we will notify you by mail if you qualify. Please keep us informed of your current address.

 

 Has there been any new legislation passed to create further extensions? back to top 

 

 

 On February 22, 2012, the President signed into law the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-96). The bill extends the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program through December 29, 2012 and State Extended Benefits (SEB) program through January 5, 2013. The new legislation does not add any additional funds for individuals who have already exhausted EUC and/or SEB; it extends the filing dates in which an eligible individual can apply. It also includes a three-tiered reduction in EUC benefits that relies on Georgia&apos;s unemployment rate.

The State Extended Benefits (SEB) Program for the state of Georgia ended on March 26, 2012. Provisions for SEB were only available while Georgias unemployment rate remained above the required minimum set by federal regulations. Based on data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on March 30, 2012 as well as revisions to prior year data released on February 29, 2012, Georgia no longer met the criteria to continue the SEB program. Under federal and state law, individuals may receive three additional weeks of SEB after the week the program ends. The last payable week of SEB is the week of April 15-21, 2012. There will be no payment of SEB for weeks ending after April 21, 2012, even if a balance remains.

 

 How will the current legislation impact individuals receiving EUC or SEB? back to top 

 

 

 
The legislation will cut additional weeks of total benefits in Georgia, by reducing the potential maximum weeks available to individuals beginning in September 2012. Further reductions may occur, if Georgia&apos;s Total Unemployment Rate (TUR) falls below the required unemployment rate for each EUC Tier.

As of April 21, 2012, Georgias SEB program ended. This cut an additional 20 weeks of extended benefits.

 

 Can I contact my career center or the UI Customer Service Unit now to find out if I may be eligible for EUC and/or SEB in the future? back to top 

 

 

 No. EUC and SEB programs can start and end at various times. This is determined either through the legislation that created the extension, or by a reduction in the unemployment rate. We cannot determine your future eligibility until you either exhaust your current eligibility or your claim expires. 

 Currently, how many tiers and weeks of EUC are available? back to top 

 

 

 Beginning July 8, 2012, three EUC Tiers are available. It is possible some EUC Tiers may end before December 29, 2012, if Georgia&apos;s Total Unemployment Rate (TUR) falls below the required rate. The number of current available weeks are as follows:

 First-Tier Emergency Unemployment Compensation (1st Tier EUC) Individuals who have been paid all regular UI benefits will be eligible to receive up to 20 weeks of First-Tier EUC benefits, if they are not eligible to establish a new unemployment insurance (UI) claim in Georgia or any other state. Individuals must meet all eligibility requirements to be paid benefits. Effective September 2, 2012, the maximum number of weeks will decrease from 20 to 14. There is no Total Unemployment Rate (TUR) requirement that must be met in order to pay benefits. First-Tier EUC benefits will be payable through week ending December 29, 2012. No additional weeks of EUC payments can be made for any week ending after December 29, 2012, even if here is a balance remaining.

 Second-Tier Emergency Unemployment Compensation (2nd Tier EUC) Individuals who have been paid all First-Tier EUC benefits will be eligible to receive up to 14 weeks of Second-Tier EUC benefits, if they are not eligible to establish a new UI claim in Georgia or any other state. Individuals must meet all eligibility requirements to be paid benefits. Effective May 27, 2012, Georgia&apos;s TUR must be above 6% to continue to pay Second-Tier EUC benefits. The maximum number of weeks will not change. Second-Tier EUC benefits will be payable through week ending December 29, 2012, as long as Georgia&apos;s TUR remains above the required rate. No additional week of EUC payments can be made for any weeks ending after December 29, 2012, even if here is a balance remaining.

 Third-Tier Emergency Unemployment Compensation (3rd Tier EUC) Individuals who have been paid all Second-Tier EUC benefits will be eligible to receive up to 13 weeks of Third-Tier EUC benefits, if they are not eligible to establish a new UI claim in Georgia or any other state. Individuals must meet all eligibility requirements in order to be paid benefits. Effective May 27, 2012, Georgia&apos;s TUR must be above 7% to continue to pay Third-Tier EUC benefits. Effective September 2, 2012, the maximum number of weeks will decrease from 13 to 9. Third-Tier benefits will be payable through week ending December 29, 2012, as long as Georgia&apos;s TUR remains above the required rate. No additional weeks of EUC payments can be made for any week ending after December 29, 2012, even if here is a balance remaining.

 Fourth-Tier Emergency Unemployment Compensation (4th Tier EUC) The 4th Tier EUC Program has triggered off. Based on data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on June 15, 2012, the three month average, seasonally adjusted total unemployment rate in Georgia fell below the 9.0% rate required to remain triggered on to the Fourth Tier EUC program. As a result, individuals must qualify for and exhaust Third Tier EUC benefits prior to or during the claim week of July 1 7, 2012, in order to establish a new Fourth Tier EUC claim Individuals who meet this requirement and those who are receiving Fourth Tier EUC benefits and have a remaining balance as of the week beginning July 8, 2012, are eligible to receive the remaining Fourth Tier EUC balance through week ending date December 29, 2012. No additional weeks of EUC can be paid after December 29, 2012, even if there is a remaining balance. 

 What are the eligibility requirements to establish an EUC claim? back to top 

 

 

 To establish an EUC claim, individuals must have: (1) established an unemployment insurance (UI) claim that began on or after May 7, 2006; (2) exhausted their regular UI benefits, or their claim benefit year has ended; (3) must not be eligible to establish a new regular UI claim in Georgia, any other state, U.S. territory, or Canada. 

 What are the eligibility requirements to establish a SEB claim? back to top 

 

 

 State Extended Benefits (SEB) may be available for individuals who have exhausted all regular unemployment insurance (UI) and Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC), First, Second, Third, and Fourth Tiers on or after February 15, 2009.

The State Extended Benefits (SEB) Program for the state of Georgia ended on March 26, 2012. Individuals who exhausted Fourth-Tier EUC benefits were required to apply for SEB by completing an online SEB application. Individuals had to qualify for and exhaust all regular UI and EUC eligibility (all four EUC Tiers) with a payment for a week ending date prior to or during the week of April 8, 2012 April 14, 2012 , to qualify for SEB. SEB payments will not continue for any week after April 21, 2012, even if a balance remains. 

 Can I apply for EUC before my regular UI claim exhausts? back to top 

 

 

 No. If you have regular UI benefits remaining, you must be paid all of your balance first, or your regular UI claim must expire, before you can file for EUC. 

 I noticed my SEB job prospect classification is listed as“Not Good Prospect.”What does that mean and how does it affect me? back to top 

 

 

 Under the SEB program, the Georgia Department of Labor (GDOL) is required to classify an individual&apos;s prospects for obtaining a job that will start within four (4) weeks as either“good prospects”or“not good prospect.”Classification will be determined by the answer to the following question:“Do you have a guarantee to start a job within 30 days from the date of this application?”This question appears on the online SEB application.

“Good Prospects”classification means that an individual has indicated he/she will start a job within 30 days from the submittal date of their application. Individuals who receive this classification will be required to meet the same work search and availability requirements each week as required on their previous UI and EUC claim.

“Not Good Prospects”classification means that an individual has indicated he/she will not start a job within 30 days from the submittal date of their application. Individuals who receive this classification will be required to meet the stringent SEB work search requirements listed below. They also will be expected to apply for and accept any job if it: (1) is within their capabilities to perform; (2) pays a gross wage exceeding their weekly benefit amount (WBA); and, (3) pays not less than minimum wage. This means that an individual may be required to accept work outside of their regular occupation.

In order for an individual to have his/her job prospects reclassified as“good prospects,”he/she must submit a copy of an employer&apos;s written offer of a job that will start within four (4) weeks to his/her local career Center. Once reclassified as“good prospects,”the individual will be expected to meet the“good prospects”requirements. 

 How and when do I need to apply for EUC benefits? back to top 

 

 

 Once you have exhausted your regular unemployment insurance benefits, you may be eligible to receive EUC benefits. We will send you a letter advising you how to apply for and claim your EUC benefits. In most cases it will not be necessary to complete an application. The first week claimed following the exhaustion of the initial regular claim will serve as the EUC application and qualify claimants for First-Tier EUC benefits. The first week claimed following the exhaustion on the First-Tier EUC will serve as the Second-Tier application and qualify claimants for Second-Tier benefits. The same would apply for the Third-Tier EUC benefits.

If you need to reopen your claim or file an additional claim, you will be required to complete the online EUC application.

 How much will I receive? back to top 

 

 

 First-Tier EUC: Currently, First-Tier EUC will calculate to be the lesser of either 80% of the maximum benefit amount (MBA) received on your most recent regular claim, or 20 times your weekly benefit amount. All First-Tier EUC claims established on or after September 2, 2012, will calculate to be the lesser of either 54% of the maximum benefit amount (MBA) received on your most recent regular claim, or 14 times your weekly benefit amount.

 Second-Tier EUC: Second-Tier EUC will calculate to be the lesser of either 54% of the MBA received on your most recent regular claim, or 14 times your weekly benefit amount.

 Third-Tier EUC: Currently, Third-Tier EUC will calculate to be the lesser of either 50% of the MBA received on your most recent regular claim, or 13 times your weekly benefit amount. All Third-Tier EUC claims established on or after September 2, 2012, will calculate to be the lesser of either 35% of the maximum benefit amount (MBA) received on your most recent regular claim, or 9 times your weekly benefit amount.

 Fourth-Tier EUC: Fourth-Tier claims established with an effective date on or before April 21, 2012 will calculate to be the lesser of 24% of the MBA received on your most recent regular claim, or 6 times your weekly benefit amount. Fourth-Tier claims established with an effective date between April 22, 2012 and May 26, 2012 will calculate to be the lesser of 62% of the MBA received on your most recent regular claim, or 16 times your weekly benefit amount. Fourth-Tier claims with an effective date between May 27, 2012 and July 7, 2012 will calculate to be the lesser of 24% of the MBA received on your most recent regular claim, or 6 times your weekly benefit amount.. The week ending July 7, 2012 will be the last week in which EUC individuals in the state of Georgia can exhaust Tier 3, and establish Tier 4 eligibility. Under the phase-out provisions, Individuals receiving Fourth Tier EUC benefits and have a remaining balance as of the week beginning July 8, 2012, are eligible to receive the remaining Fourth Tier EUC balance through week ending date December 29, 2012. No additional weeks of EUC can be paid after December 29, 2012, even if there is a remaining balance.

 State Extended Benefits (SEB) will be calculated to be the lesser of either 80% of the maximum benefit amount (MBA) received on your most recent regular claim, or 20 times your weekly benefit amount. Individuals who live in another state but have filed a Georgia claim will only be eligible for up to two weeks of SEB, if the state of residence is not in a SEB period.

The State Extended Benefits (SEB) Program for the state of Georgia ended on March 26, 2012. The last payable week of SEB is the week of April 15-21, 2012. 

 How are EUC and SEB benefits paid? back to top 

 

 

 EUC and SEB benefits will be paid either by direct deposit or by check. 

 I was on EUC and was told I qualify for a new claim. The weekly benefit amount (WBA) is lower than my EUC WBA. Can I stay on the EUC? back to top 

 

 

 Possibly, new language added to the EUC legislation passed in July, 2010, allows certain individuals to elect to receive EUC instead of filing a new regular unemployment insurance (UI) claim when their benefit year expires. The potential new regular UI claim must be at least $100 or 25% less than the individual&apos;s weekly benefit amount of the expired benefit year claim. This piece of the legislation only affects claims that expire with the week ending July 24, 2010 or later.

 NOTE: This legislation does not apply to SEB. If an individual can establish a regular unemployment claim while receiving SEB benefits, the individual no longer qualifies for SEB benefits. He or she must be paid regular unemployment benefits even if the weekly benefit amount is lower than the SEB weekly benefit amount. 

 Will EUC benefits affect my Trade Readjustment Allowances (TRA) payments? back to top 

 

 

 Yes. An individual cannot collect TRA for a week if he or she is eligible to receive EUC benefits. EUC benefits must be paid instead of TRA benefits. If a person is claiming TRA benefits, the TRA benefits are suspended until he or she exhausts their EUC benefits.

The maximum amount of EUC benefits that a claimant may receive may be deducted from the maximum amount of basic TRA payable to the individual if the EUC benefits and the TRA are based on the same regular unemployment claim. When an individual exhausts EUC benefits, his or her eligibility to resume TRA will be determined.

TRA eligibility periods for basic, additional, and remedial TRA will not be revised or extended because of eligibility of EUC benefits. 

 Will SEB benefits affect my Trade Readjustment Allowances (TRA) payments? back to top 

 

 

 Yes. An individual cannot collect TRA for a week if he or she is eligible to receive SEB benefits. SEB benefits must be paid instead of TRA benefits. If a person is claiming TRA benefits, the TRA benefits are suspended until he or she exhausts their SEB benefits.

SEB will be reduced on a week to week ratio for each week the individual receives basic TRA prior to receiving SEB.

TRA eligibility periods for basic, additional, and remedial TRA will not be revised or extended because of eligibility of SEB benefits. 

 Will EUC benefits affect my Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) payments? back to top 

 

 

 Yes. An individual cannot collect DUA payments for a week if he or she is eligible to receive EUC benefits. EUC benefits must be paid instead of DUA benefits. If an individual is not able to qualify for EUC benefits because an injury suffered in the disaster left them unable to work, they will revert to the DUA payments. 

 Will SEB benefits affect my Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) payments? back to top 

 

 

 Yes. An individual cannot collect DUA payments for a week if he or she is eligible to receive SEB benefits. SEB benefits must be paid instead of DUA benefits. If an individual is not able to qualify for SEB benefits because an injury suffered in the disaster left them unable to work, they will revert to the DUA payments.

Payments of DUA benefits cannot be made after the disaster assistance period (DAP). The DAP is not extended or revised based on SEB eligibility. 

 What are the employment service registration and work search requirements for EUC? back to top 

 

 

 All individuals receiving EUC benefits must be registered for employment services and are required to be able to work, available for work, and actively seeking work, unless exempted due to participation in approved training, union affiliation, or have a definite recall to work date within six weeks. Individuals are required to record and submit proof of their work search efforts, listing verifiable contacts, while receiving EUC. You must contact two different employers on two different days during each week you claim EUC.

 What are the work search requirements for SEB? back to top 

 

 

 Individuals must actively seek work for each week that SEB is claimed. A work search record should be maintained beginning the first week after the mail date shown on the SEB Monetary Determination, DOL-411SEB. Individuals must contact at least two different employers each week, Sunday through Saturday. Each contact must be made on a different day of the week.

Failure to seek work for any reason during a week claimed will result in denial and/or repayment of benefits. Denial of benefits will require individuals to return to work for at least four weeks and earn at least four times the WBA. Individuals who are unable to meet the SEB work search requirements may choose not to claim SEB for that period and resume claiming SEB for weeks that the requirements are met.

 When does the EUC program expire? back to top 

 

 

 Legislation has been enacted to extend the eligibility period of Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) through December 29, 2012, as long as Georgia&apos;s Total Unemployment Rate (TUR) remains above the required rate. No additional weeks of EUC can be paid for any week ending after December 29, 2012, even if there is a balance remaining. 

 When does the SEB program expire? back to top 

 

 

 Legislation has been enacted to extend the eligibility period of State Extended Benefits (SEB) through week ending January 5, 2013; however, provisions for SEB are only available while Georgias unemployment rate remains above the required minimum set by the federal regulations. Based on data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on March 30, 2012, as well as revisions to prior years data released on February 29, 2012, Georgia no longer meets the criteria to continue the SEB program. Therefore, effective March 26, 2012, the SEB program ended. Under federal and state law, individuals may receive three additional weeks of SEB after the week the program ends. The last payable period for the SEB program will be the week ending April 21, 2012. SEB payments will not continue for any week after April 21, 2012, even if a balance remains. 

 Are Georgia employers being charged for EUC benefit payments? back to top 

 

 

 No. EUC benefits are completely funded by the Federal Government. 

 Are Georgia employers being charged for SEB benefit payments? back to top 

 

 

 Currently, governmental entities and Indian reservations are charged for the benefits paid to individuals receiving SEB. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Unemployment Insurance 

 What is unemployment insurance? back to top 

 

 

 Unemployment insurance is temporary income for workers who are unemployed through no fault of their own and are either looking for another job, have a definite recall within 6 weeks of the last day worked, or are in approved training. The funding for unemployment insurance benefits comes from taxes paid by employers. Workers do not pay any of the costs.

 Why is an affidavit required? back to top 

 

 

 Section 50-36-1 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated (O.C.G.A.) requires every applicant for public benefits, including unemployment insurance (UI), who is 18 years old or older, sign an affidavit attesting that they are (1) a United States citizen or a legal permanent resident or (2) a non-citizen legally present in the United States. 

 When do I execute the Applicant Status Affidavit? back to top 

 

 

 Upon completing an application for UI benefits, applicants visiting a GDOL career center will be assisted with the execution of an Applicant Status Affidavit. Applicants filing for UI benefits via the Internet will receive an email within 3 to 5 days providing a date on which the applicant is to report in person to the local career center to execute the Applicant Status Affidavit. Valid government-issued picture identification is required. You cannot receive benefits until the affidavit is accomplished. 

 

 I executed an Applicant Status Affidavit last year when I filed for UI benefits. Do I have to execute another one this year? back to top 

 

 

 No. This is a one-time requirement, but non-citizen status documents must be presented each time an individual files for UI benefits. 

 When is my claim effective? back to top 

 

 

 Your claim is effective the date you first file for benefits. GDOL does not backdate claims. 

 How do I qualify for unemployment insurance benefits? back to top 

 

 

 There are several qualification requirements, but these three are critical:
 You must have earned enough money in the base period to set up a claim. You must be unemployed through no fault of your own. You must be able to work, be available for work, and be actively seeking work each week you claim benefits. 
 

 What is the base period? back to top 

 

 

 The base period is the period of time we look at to determine if you have been paid enough wages to establish a claim. For Georgia, the base period is the first four of the last five calendar quarters completed at the time you file your claim. An alternative base period consisting of the most recently completed four calendar quarters will be used only when a claim cannot be established using the regular base period. 

 How long must I have worked to establish a claim in Georgia? back to top 

 

 

 Your claim is based on insured wages earned in the base period, which is the first four of the last five calendar quarters completed at the time you file your claim. You must have earned qualifying wages in at least two of the four quarters in the base period. The total wages in the base period must equal or exceed one and one-half times the wages in the highest quarter. A secondary calculation will be made when the sole reason that a claim cannot be established is the one and one-half times requirement. An alternative base period consisting of the most recently completed four calendar quarters will be used only when a claim cannot be established using the regular base period. 

 What are the minimum and maximum weekly benefits paid in Georgia? back to top 

 

 

 Effective July 1, 2007, the minimum is $44 per week. The maximum is $330 for claims filed on or after July 1, 2008. The amount an individual will receive is based on the amount of wages earned in the base period. 

 What is the maximum and minimum number of weeks a regular unemployment claim can be established? back to top 

 

 

 Prior to July 1, 2012, the maximum number of weeks is 26. Effective July 1, 2012, the maximum number of weeks a claim can be established will range from 14 to 20, depending on the seasonal adjusted statewide unemployment rate in use at the time the regular UI claim is filed. For claims filed from July 1 through December 31, Georgias seasonal adjusted UI rate for the previous April will be used. For claims filed from January 1 through June 30, Georgias seasonal adjusted UI rate for the previous October will be used. The minimum number of weeks is 6. 

 How can I determine the potential maximum number of weeks a claim can be established? back to top 

 

 

 The date the claim is filed will determine this for you. The chart below provides the maximum number of weeks the claim can potentially be established based upon the unemployment rate in effect at the time the claim is filed.

 
 Seasonal Adjusted UI Rate Maximum Number of Weeks Maximum Benefits Payable will Equal the Lesser of: Less than or equal to 6.5% 14 weeks 14 x Weekly Benefit Amount (WBA) or 1/4 of Base Period Wages Greater than 6.5% up to 7.0% 15 weeks 15 x WBA or 1/4 of Base Period wages Greater than 7.0% up to 7.5% 16 weeks 16 x WBA or 1/4 of Base Period wages Greater than 7.5% up to 8.0% 17 weeks 17 x WBA or 1/4 of Base Period wages Greater than 8.0% up to 8.5% 18 weeks 18 x WBA or 1/4 of Base Period wages Greater than 8.5% but less than 9.0% 19 weeks 19 x WBA or 1/4 of Base Period wages 9.0% or above 20 weeks 20 x WBA or 1/4 of Base Period wages 
 

 Why has the maximum number of potential UI weeks been changed? back to top 

 

 

 The Georgia Legislature passed House Bill 347 which changes the calculation method to determine the maximum number of weeks to be based upon the adjusted statewide unemployment rate in use at the time the regular UI claim is filed. The change became effective July 1, 2012. 

 Is everyone eligible for the maximum number of weeks? back to top 

 

 

 No. The individuals base period wages are used to determine the maximum benefits payable which may or may not qualify an individual for the maximum number of weeks. The maximum benefits payable to an individual in a benefit year is the lesser of the maximum number of weeks times the weekly benefit amount or one-fourth of the base period wages. 

 How can I determine what unemployment rate is being used to establish my claim? back to top 

 

 

 An Unemployment Benefit Determination is mailed to claimants when an initial claim is filed on or after July 1, 2012. The determination will provide the rate for your claim filing period. The current rate for a specified claim filing period may also be obtained by contacting UI Customer Service at 404-232-3001 or 1-877-709-8185. 

 If I establish a claim and the unemployment rate goes up at a later date, will my claim be recalculated to add extra weeks? back to top 

 

 

 No. An unemployment claim will be established using the unemployment rate in effect at the time of filing the claim. The claim will not be recalculated if the unemployment rate changes during the life of the claim. 

 What do I have to do to qualify for benefits if I have earned enough money to establish a claim? back to top 

 

 

 Just earning enough money to set up a claim is not enough to receive unemployment benefits. You must also meet other eligibility conditions. You must have a decision made on the reason for separation from your last work. If your most recent job loss was not the result of a lack of work (i.e. layoff, business closure), a decision on the reason for separation is required. A department employee may conduct a telephone interview with you and your former employer to get information about the reason for your separation or any other issues which might affect your claim. A written decision will be mailed to you, and to your employer if the issue is separation. Other requirements include, but are not limited to, being able to work, being available for work, and actively seeking work. 

 Can I draw benefits if I quit my job? back to top 

 

 

 If you quit, you may be eligible to draw benefits if you can show that you quit for good work-connected reason(s). Examples of good work-connected reasons are material change in working conditions, material change in working agreement, nonpayment for work, and similar reasons. You will not be able to draw benefits if your reason for quitting was personal even though the personal reason was a good or compelling one. The only way to know for sure whether you are eligible if you quit is to file a claim. The department cannot make a predetermination of eligibility before a claim is filed. 

 Can I draw benefits if I was fired? back to top 

 

 

 If you were fired from your job, you will not be able to draw benefits if your former employer can show that you were fired for failure to follow rules, orders, or instructions, or for misconduct on the job. The only way to know for sure whether you are eligible if you are fired is to file a claim. The department cannot make a predetermination of eligibility before a claim is filed. 

 Are there other requirements if I draw benefits? back to top 

 

 

 Yes. If you are awarded benefits based on your reason for separation from your last work, you must meet other weekly requirements. You must be able to do some kind of work that is available in your area and that you are qualified to do. You must be available for work without placing undue restrictions on your availability, such as lack of child care, lack of transportation, or other restrictions. You must be actively seeking work each week and you must be looking for full-time employment. You must not refuse any offer of suitable work or referral to suitable work without good cause. You must be registered for work with the department&apos;s Employment Service Division, and you must respond to any notices to come in for services. If you work and earn any money while you are drawing benefits, you must report all earnings for the week in which the money is earned, not for the week the money is paid. Any amount over $50 earned during a week will be deducted from your weekly benefit amount if you filed your claim on or after July 1, 2002. Any amount over $30 will be deducted if you filed your claim on or before June 30, 2002. 

 Does severance pay have an effect on my benefits? back to top 

 

 

 You are usually not eligible for unemployment insurance benefits during a period covered by severance pay paid to you by your employer. The only way to know for sure whether severance pay is disqualifying is to file a claim. 

 Does retirement pay have any effect on my benefits? back to top 

 

 

 If you are receiving a retirement pension from a base period employer, the pension may be deductible from your weekly benefit amount if your employer contributed 50%or more toward the pension fund. If the pension payment is determined to be deductible, the department will reduce your weekly benefit amount dollar for dollar by the weekly amount of the pension that is attributable to the employer. NOTE: If your pension is from an employer you worked for before the base period, it is not deductible. The receipt of Social Security is also not deductible, although you do have to be available for full-time work. 

 How do workers&apos; compensation payments affect my claim? back to top 

 

 

 If you are receiving Temporary Total or Temporary Partial Workers&apos; Compensation payments, you are not eligible for unemployment insurance in Georgia. The only way to know for sure is to file a claim. 

 How do I claim benefits each week after I file? back to top 

 

 

 Once you file your claim, you will be required to certify your eligibility for each week you claim benefits. Most people claim benefits by using the telephone response system, known as OLIVoR, over the Internet, or in person at a GDOL Career Center.

 OLIVoR 
 Certify for Benefits over the Internet 
 GDOL Career Centers 

 When do I get my first check? back to top 

 

 

 The department will send you a written decision (called a determination) telling you whether benefits may be paid or not. Remember, you must execute an Applicant Status Affidavit. You cannot receive benefits until the affidavit is accomplished. This determination is usually issued about 14 to 21 days after the day you file. If benefits are allowed on your claim, your first check will usually be mailed on the same day as the written decision. You must claim benefits each week prior to receipt of your determination in order to receive payment for those weeks. If you requested direct deposit of your check to your bank account, the first check will be deposited the same day the determination allowing benefits is mailed. The funds will be available the second business day after deposit. You may inquire by using OLIVoR or the Internet to verify the date your check was either mailed or deposited directly to your bank account. 

 My checks always arrive on Thursday and today it didn&apos;t. What should I do? back to top 

 

 

 Wait. Although checks often arrive on the same day of the week, they occasionally arrive later due to mail service or government holidays. If you have not received your check within 10 days of the date you certified, you should contact your local career center. 

 Are unemployment benefits taxable? back to top 

 

 

 Yes. Any unemployment insurance benefits you receive are fully taxable income if you are required to file a tax return. At the time you file your claim, you may elect to have the department withhold state and/or federal tax on the benefits you receive. You may change this withholding election one time during the year. The department will send you a 1099-G form at the end of the calendar year showing how much in benefits you received during the previous year. It also shows the amount of taxes, if any, that were withheld. You should use this form when you file your income taxes to report benefits received and any taxes withheld by the department. Questions about filing should be directed to the IRS, to the State Department of Revenue, or to a tax consultant. 

 I received two determinations on my claim. One says I can draw benefits and the other says I cannot. Which is correct? back to top 

 

 

 The department will release a determination on each separate issue on your claim. As a result, you may sometimes receive more than one determination. A decision imposing any kind of disqualification takes precedence over a decision allowing benefits. For example, you could receive a decision allowing benefits because you were laid off due to lack of work, but be ineligible because you do not have child care to enable you to look for another job. 

 What if I disagree with the decision made on my claim? back to top 

 

 

 The only way for a decision to be reviewed and potentially reversed is to file an appeal. You have the right to file an appeal of any decision made by the department on your claim. The appeal rights expire 15 days after the date the decision is released. The Commissioner of Labor does not have the authority to intervene in the appeals process. If the decision is on your separation from work, your employer also has the right to appeal. An administrative hearing officer will conduct the appeal. 

 How long does
 it take to get an appeal? back to top 

 

 

 Once an appeal is filed, it usually takes from 2 - 2 1/2 weeks for a hearing to take place. The department is required to send written notice of the hearing time, date, and all issues to be discussed. This notice must be mailed at least 10 days before the hearing takes place. A written decision is mailed to all interested parties. 

 What if I disagree with the decision of the hearing officer? back to top 

 

 

 You may appeal to the Board of Review. The Board is a three-member panel appointed by the Governor. The Board reviews the entire record of the hearing held by the administrative hearing officer and all other relevant materials. The Board does not hold in-person hearings and does not take new evidence or testimony. The Board reviews the case and either affirms, modifies, or reverses the decision of the hearing officer. The Board&apos;s written decision is mailed to all interested parties. 

 Can I appeal the Board of Review&apos;s decision? back to top 

 

 

 The Board&apos;s decision may be appealed to the Superior Court of the county in which the work was performed. A petition for review must be filed with the court. The department does not file these appeals. NOTE: If the work on which the claim was based was performed out of state, the appeal of the decision of the Board of Review must be filed in Fulton County Superior Court.
