Out of all the things my mom in law and grandma in law wanted for a late Mothers Day they wanted a burger. They never tried Five Guys and neither has the BF and it&apos;s been forever for me so off we go.

We each got a burger and got a large plain fries to share. You pick your basic burger which gives you the choice of amount of patty, with/without cheese and bacon then there are &quot;free&quot; toppings you can do. The one thing I don&apos;t like is how it is wrapped in foil and put in a bag so it got a bit smushed. The burger itself was really juicy. Because it is fresh made and wrapped in foil, I don&apos;t really feel this is good take out food and will get soggy.

I don&apos;t get the In N Out comparison at all. I was talking to a friend online and the first thing they asked is if it was better than In N Out. Yeah they&apos;re both simple menus and serve it up fresh but the taste is apples to oranges. They&apos;re both good, and just different. If you like more toppings than standard, this is probably more of your place.

I like their fries a lot. It&apos;s a good mix of a bit of a soft and crispy like a hybrid between a steak fry and a french fries. A large was shared between four people and we had some left. It is big servings....if you want fries it&apos;s probably good to share a regular between 2.

Everyone talks about the machine and I pictured when people said they have ice tea that it would be attached to the machine and I can flavor it however I want. It was separate and standard Peak tea flavors so I was a bit sad about that. I ended up trying a few of the Dasani waters instead since I&apos;m not really a big soda person.

They were really efficient with the line and came to even check on us at our table which is a positive unusual for a fast food place.

Overall, it was pretty good and more importantly mom and grandma was happy. They are looking forward to the one opening on Lake Mead by their place and they really want to return. As much as I enjoyed the food at that moment, I had major itis and angry tummy. I just can&apos;t eat good and greasy stuff so it&apos;s not their fault at all. If you love a good burger though give this place a go.

The big greasy bag of fries may make you wince at first...but let me tell ya they&apos;re pretty damn good!

Good, fresh burgers and fries.  A TON of fries.  Really, I don&apos;t NEED all those fries!  But I&apos;ll eat them.  Oh yes, I will.  The only thing that would make this place better?  A drive-thru!  But really, I don&apos;t need that either. Getting out of my car and walking inside ...ah yes, what a grueling workout!

Although I&apos;ll always be a (legal) immigrant at heart, I&apos;m all about American food, particularly burgers. So I was extremely hyped to check out Five Guys, since the reviews from my friends were nothing short of astounding.

The staff at this particular venue greeted me and my Five-Guys-veteran friend with enthusiasm and remained consistent and genuine with their hospitality. Service is a huge component in my dining experiences, so the joint lived up to its reputation.

The quality of the food, however, was a little bit overrated. Not to say the Bacon Cheeseburger I had wasn&apos;t up to par, but it honestly was not any better than the original Six Dollar Burger. And trust me, I know burgers! The meat was well-cooked, the rest of the ingredients were fresh and flavorful, but it didn&apos;t rock my tastebuds any harder than a blue cheese burger from Stripburger (outside the Fashion Show Mall).
The Five Guys style fries were alright as well; plentiful in that they offer an entire brown bag filled with them, but lackluster in flavor... I have a thing against peanuts and both styles of fries (the second being Cajun style) are fried in peanut oil, which might have been the negative factor.

I&apos;m a fan of Five Guys and I&apos;ll probably end up frequenting it during late-night meat cravings, and based on the customer service, dedication of employees and quality of (some of) the food, I&apos;d recommend it. But fair warning --- don&apos;t get your hopes up for the spectacular burger experience to end all fast food joints. It&apos;s great, but not without flaw.

Honestly, I don&apos;t get it. How this place has any reviews higher than four-stars is beyond me. And I don&apos;t mean that in an overtly critical way, nor do I mean to say this place is anything like a two-star... no. It&apos;s a solid three. Let me tell you why.

I walked in today after getting my eyes looked at the awesome eye doc above this place. I asked the girl working the counter for a cheeseburger with everything, plus fries and a drink. At most places, this would constitute some sort of combo meal. Here they seemed to charge me for everything piece meal. All together it was right north of $12, which seemed kinda steep. Thinking it might be totally worth it like Smashburger, I was cool with it.

While waiting for my burger and fries, I went up to their cool-looking future soda tron. It&apos;s essentially a soda machine with a touch screen that allows you to pick from a bunch of different types of soda. So far, so good. A few minutes later, someone walked by and asked me if they could get me ketchup or something while I waited for my food. I said yes, thank you, that&apos;d be swell. Plus points for that. Then a few moments later my food was ready. I ate a few of my &quot;spicy&quot; fries for a minute and headed home. Twenty minutes later, I was home and ready to tear into my burger. O opened it up, and... how to put this nicely... my expectations were not met. I found a smallish burger topped with all the usual fixings. $12 worth of food? Nope.

I tore into it and was even further depressed. The burger was ok, on par with the burgers my dad sometimes makes at home. Good meat and seasoning, sure, and probably well worth $5, but not 12. It wasn&apos;t even a big enough burger where you can say at least you got your money back in volume.

I will not be returning.

I must give this place 5 stars

This is the best burger I have ever had in my life...

Ive never had such a good quality burger the meat is so juicy and flavorful, the bun just melts in your mouth and to top it off i had bacon mayo and cheese to enhance this flavorful juicylicous burger. I ordered a side of fries to go with it there also very tasty I love the seasoning on them and there very generous with the amount they give you. My son had a grilled cheese and fries he ate all of his food which is very rare i actually had a bite of the grilled cheese myself and i must say it was pretty darn tasty for just a grilled cheese.

I have no complaints about this place. How can you go wrong with good quality food, good friendly service at a decent price.

If you haven&apos;t tried this place please do it will be the most delicious burger you have ever had, ever since Ive been here Ive been craving and dreaming of their food.

First thing you see when you go in is a lot of people, then the barrel of peanuts everywhere. I thought they were some kind of decoration until I seen people with them on the plates.

Burgers and peanuts? Werid but awesome lol.

So they bagged our food even though we were dining in. I look in the bag, and the fries are everywhere, and I can&apos;t even find the burgers! As I am looking for the burgers at the bottom of the bag, I find a small carton with a few fries in it. I think that was a pretty good deal to pay three bucks for fries, and they filled the bag up with them lol.
I did not finish all those fries. I just had a simple hamburger and it was pretty small patty for almost six bucks. I like the idea of choosing toppings for free though.

Another cool thing was the soda machine. It was pretty fun, to have so many choices and all computer.

I will return and very likely choose more toppings.

Delicious, delicious, delicious!

The quality of their burgers is wonderful. I ordered a cheeseburger with mayo, mushrooms and onions. The bun is soft and sweet, the meat is flavorful, condiments were tasty. I used to love Fuddruckers burgers, but honestly this place takes the cake... er, the meat patty. The facility itself is clean and inviting. The staff was hospitable. No complaints here. The price may shun some people, but it&apos;s really not that expensive. You get what you pay for and even more in my opinion. You get a quality burger that tastes great. If you&apos;re looking for a cheap, previously frozen, premade burger type place, I can give you the directions to the nearest Mcdonalds and you can order a $1.00 Mcdouble.

I wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the fries but I&apos;m a tad bias since I don&apos;t like spice. It seems like they toss the fries with a spicy seasoning so it&apos;s too much for me (I&apos;m the girl who can&apos;t even eat a bag of Andy Capp&apos;s Spicy fries without chugging on some milk). If you like that cajun side of fries, then you will probably be a fan of these.

All in all, definitely a great place for burgers. You can customize your burger to your liking with whatever condiments they offer. Pretty good in my book.

I went into Five Guys after hearing all of the hype surrounding it. I was very intrigued, and I love how Chick Fil A uses peanut oil to fry everything, so I figured it would be something like a beefy version of Chick Fil A. I ordered a little bacon cheeseburger with bbq sauce, grilled onions, jalapenos, lettuce, tomato alongside some Cajun
fries.

The burger was delicious. It was really juicy, and I loved how the crust of the meat was very crispy. The cheese was delicious as well. The jalapenos added a nice kick to the burger.

The cajun fries were really bad though. They needed some salt, and they needed it badly. Otherwise, they were well seasoned, but I couldn&apos;t eat more than a couple of fries without feeling this immense dryness in my mouth. Another pet peeve is that they only have malt vinegar and ketchup for the fries. I tried the malt vinegar with the fries, and I thought it was disgusting. It didn&apos;t taste like malt vinegar to me. It tasted more like apple cider vinegar. Since I&apos;m not a ketchup fan, I didn&apos;t end up eating a lot of the fries. You could really taste that they were fried in peanut oil by the way. It wasn&apos;t a positive or a negative; it was just very prevalent.

Overall, I won&apos;t be coming back to 5 guys. I&apos;m going to stick to In N Out and Smashburger.

About time I&apos;ve tried this place.

So I walk in to the most unexpected sight. A crowded, noisy mess with giant bags of potatoes and boxes containing peanuts at the front door. I&apos;m still confused over why there&apos;s so many peanuts, but moving on, I just get in line.

The menu is fairly basic, which from my perspective is a good thing! Since I can be quite picky when it comes to burger toppings, it&apos;s very convenient for the burger to come plain and just let them know which toppings you would like afterward (at no extra charge). What can I say? I&apos;m a mayonnaise hating machine who believes that putting cheeses like Swiss or Monterrey Jack on a burger is blasphemy, so it gets quite frustrating having to constantly explain that over and over again at other burger joints.

I was a bit worried about the price. $12.08 for burgers, fries and a drink isn&apos;t expensive, but that&apos;s not exactly my idea of a deal either, not at a fast food restaurant at least. After finishing the meal however, I can say that it was totally worth it, even if it&apos;s something a poor college student can&apos;t eat on a regular basis.

I ordered a regular cheeseburger with grilled onions, ketchup, mustard and lettuce. The thing was HUGE. I just loved how it was a double cheeseburger as well, even though the menu didn&apos;t say so. Hate to jump on the comparison bandwagon, but it really reminded me of In-N-Out, just much bigger, juicier, sesame seeds on the bun and no yummy special sauce. The part that most reminded me of In-N-Out was how when you get close to finishing the burger, the meat, cheese and toppings start to outweigh the bun. Still too soon to say which one I prefer though.

The fries were also a surprise. I can be quite a weirdo when it comes to fries. As someone who can appreciate crispy fries and soggy fries, I was quite impressed with the balance of sogginess and crisp. They also overload you on them. They already come in a cup to begin with, and looking behind the counter, it appears the cup is just thrown in there which leads to the bag being overloaded with fries in addition to the cup. And this was the regular sized cup! There was enough of those things for two people.

One thing I really had fun with is the soda fountain. It&apos;s futuristic in the sense that it works on a touchscreen which dispenses every drink through the same sprout, but old-fashioned in the sense of &quot;syrup.&quot; Like those old-timey soda fountains you hear about, it offers several bases (such as Coca-Cola, Sprite, Mello Yello, etc...) that you can choose to make all sorts of concoctions from thanks to the flavored syrups (such as Peach, Orange, Cherry, Vanilla, etc...). Peach Sprite in particular is VERY good.

As for the ambiance of the place? I can&apos;t say I cared for it. It was so ridiculously loud in there, you basically had to yell if you wanted to talk to someone. And in spite of the large space the restaurant is in it still felt a little bit too crowded.

The Final Verdict:

Pros:
Big, juicy, delicious burgers.
The &quot;create-your-own&quot; type menu.
A tad steep, but totally worth it for what you get.
Exceptional fries, of which you&apos;re given much more than enough of them.
The out of the ordinary soda fountain.

Cons:
VERY noisy. Not the type of place to have any kind of meetup (which is what I was here for in the first place), that&apos;s for sure.
Cramped layout of the restaurant.

WTF?:
What&apos;s with all of the peanuts?

Suggestions: The kitchen should be semi-closed off from the rest of the restaurant. That would probably help out with the noise problem A LOT.

Would I return? In spite of my gripe about how hectic the ambiance of the place feels, yes.

You have to have rocks in your melon to spend $13 on a basic burger, small frys and small drink for what would cost $5.75 at In n Out.
Go ahead, throw your money away.

The employees are well rehearsed with answers when people complain of the prices.
Try them out,, and if you fall for the high prices,, you&apos;ll fall for the lame answers.
Ask them was that reply number one,,, or was it reply number 8?

NYC extreme fast food prices just don&apos;t travel well IMHO.
In n Outs business is booming for good reasons.

I was driving down Flamingo Rd. on my way to do some errands when I spotted Five Guys out of the corner of my eye. I quickly veered my car into the shopping center&apos;s entrance like I was on &quot;Fast and the Furious.&quot; I think I may even have drifted. I&apos;ve been wanting to check this place out for a while and just kinda forgot about it since Smashburger was closer to me in location.

I ordered fries, soda and a cheeseburger, all for around $10. The burger was yummy and not greasy, albeit small. I got it topped with mushrooms and fresh jalapenos which gave it a nice kick. The order of fries was huge and almost filled the entire paper bag of food. I like that they have the option of dipping them in malt vinegar. They also have those new-fangled Coke fountains with over 100 flavors. Overall experience was good and the service was fast and friendly. The meal price is a concern since the regular burger was teeny with just one patty. Maybe cut down on the fries and up the burger size.

The concept is order the way you like it, simple yet smart, giving you options.  Is is unique?  It must be as they seem to be growing at a fast past, popping up all over Vegas valley.

I like my burger grilled, with cheese and crispy bacon, lettuce, tomato, onions and some pickles.  I like mayo and ketchup, no mustard.  I&apos;ll say this place gives it to me just like I like.  The burger patty is consistently even in thickness, cooked well, and the burger is put together well.  I don&apos;t care for the fries, I think they over cook them, but I am not much of a &quot;fry&quot; eater.

The lines can be long, the dinning room crowded, but it moves quickly.  If you like peanuts, you can pass the time shucking some, I usually get a handful, it&apos;s free!  the noise level can be deafening, as the staff are always yelling out and the makes everyone else raise their voices to compensate.  As for price, I think it&apos;s a little higher than most burger joints, but the burger is worth it.

This is the schwag of burger joints.

I gave this place three tries, and it failed me all three times. I went during opening week and both the food and the service were really lacking. So I tried it again a month later and still bad. My third, and now final, visit was last week. The food is still horrendous and the service is still severely lacking.

These are some of the greasiest fries I&apos;ve ever had the misfortune of eating. You know it&apos;s bad when the paper bag they put them in is so soaked with grease that it&apos;s about to burst. I like a crisp rigid fry, the fries here are soggy and disgusting. The burgers are quite greasy and disgusting as well. I&apos;ve come to the conclusion that they have a syringe in the kitchen and they just inject everything with salt and lard, then cook it in the grease from a pigs ass.

And for how nasty the food is, it is priced entirely too high. Last week when I went the grease-ball burger sat in my stomach just churning and destroying my insides for a day. It truly felt like there were Five Guys standing inside my gut kicking everything in sight!

We have ate at this 5 guys a few times. The burgers are great and you get to eat as many peanuts as you want for free. I love it that I can add as many extra toppings as I want for free.

Love the menu, it&apos;s simple yet they offer a ton of toppings. Nowhere else in town can I get a to-go grilled cheese with whole grilled onion, grilled mushrooms, and a cool crisp tomato. The fries were delectable as well. 5 Guys staff was friendly and professional. The store was clean and neat.

Note, the coke machine at this location offers hundreds of coke-syrup combinations in the dispenser, futuristic and so dang neat!!

The most memorable part of dining at Five Guys Burgers and Fries is the suped up soda machine.  It dispenses ice, and has a touch screen that let&apos;s you select amongst 121 drink options (sodas, sweet teas) and another four brewed teas.  Thank the Forerunners that the burger ordering process here does not involved that much overwhelming choices.

As far as burgers go, it is a decent burger made with fresh ingredients. And the toppings are already included in the asking price, and you can customize your burger with as much or little of it as your heart desire.

Taste wise, I still think In-n-Out is better. But it definitely beats out burgers served at your typical fast food joints.  Plus they do not have the flexibility of allowing you to customize your toppings as you would at a Five Guys Burger location.

Grab the peanuts if you want, it is complimentary.  But the soda machine is my top reason for coming back.  Seriously, where was this machine when we were little and have friends that make drinks with every flavor sodas that comes out of the soda fountain???

Decor/Ambiance:  4/5  Simple no frills fast food restaurant tables and chairs.  Brightly lit.

Food:  3.5/5  No complaints, it is like burgers you get at a back yard BBQ, without the burnt patties or lighter fluid flavoring.  Solid but not gourmet.

Value:  3.5/5  Costs more than other fast food, but uses better ingredients. You get what you pay for.

Service:  4/5.  The cashier was great at describing what they serve making my first visit here as un-daunting as possible.

Cleanliness:  4.5/5  The staff here keeps the place nice and clean, even during the dinner rush.  Good job!

Parking:  4/5  Should not be an issue.

Overall, I would rate Five Guys Burgers and Fries more than just A-Ok (3 stars) but not quite 4 stars.  Will be back though, especially to explore what else the soda machine is capable of serving up.

Only thing missing, IMO are milk shakes.

Let&apos;s just say that I am an IN-N-OUT addict and this was my first time at a Five Guys Burger joint overall. It was a pretty good experience and I really liked the quality of their Burger.

Atmosphere 3/5: It&apos;s a fast food joint so no big surprise. The place a little bit dirty but beside that, it was alright.
Food 4/5: I was pretty shocked by the Burger. It was pretty good actually and I really like that I was able to choose the garnitures on my burger and it was free. The burger is pretty decent size and actually preferred the bun from 5-Guys vs. In-N-Out. The Cajun style fries are really good.
Service N/A:

Overall, a good experience at Five Guys and Fries. But In-N-Out stays my favorite for their Secret Menu.

You know you got a restaurant problem when one thing that people mention about this place is the cool soda machine. I admit they do have some cool soda machine that shoot all kinds of drinks.

Love their peanuts for free appetisers. But the experience when you dine in there is like dining in the zoo. The staff keep yelling &quot; two at the door&quot; as soon as they saw some people in the front door. &quot;three at the door&quot;, &quot;look two monkey&quot;, doesnt it makes you feel like you are in the zoo?

The burger was so-so but I&apos;ve gotta say, in n out is better although this joint apparently have won all kinds of awards. I would still probably come back just for to go order. Eat in, thats another issue!

I&apos;m not a big burger girl so I don&apos;t go just any-ol&apos;-where for one. Five Guys has a good burger! When I remember to order the &quot;little&quot; one (the standard burger comes with 2 patties). There are times when I crave the simplicity of In-N-Out: I find their burger&amp;fries much lighter&amp;like being able to drive thru. But then there are days when I want what I can only describe as a &quot;backyard&quot; burger&amp;this is where I satisfy that fix: heartier burger that has a more homemade taste&amp;feel. That being said, I wish there was a potato chip option! If I was chillin&apos; in the backyard eating a burger fresh off the grill, I wouldn&apos;t be eating it with fries. Now, with THAT being said, I&apos;m not the biggest fan of Five Guys fries. It seems people either love &apos;em or hate &apos;em. There&apos;s nothing necessarily wrong with how they taste, they&apos;re just overwhelming.&amp;I think it&apos;s sinful (not in the awesome way) that they give you so many. But I can also see the appeal if you&apos;re there with 3 or 4 people because you can easily share 1 small order. All in all, the staff is always über friendly, the restaurant clean, the patrons happy&amp;the quality of the product justifies the fact that a FG burger costs the same as an entire meal at In-N-Out.

This is the best burger I&apos;ve had for under $10.

I think In N Out is one of the most overrated things in life.  I don&apos;t get it!  My wife loves it and could eat there twice a week no problem and I&apos;ve had my fair share of bites.  I just don&apos;t see what the hype is about.  No doubt the price is better along with their fries but I&apos;m not coming here for that.

In my world, a great burger always has a ton of toppings and ordering your burger &quot;all the way&quot; is the only way to go.  These patties are super juicy and taste fantastic.  I also love the melty, oozy greatness of the cheese is put in between the 2 patties.

On a side note, the soda fountain machine is tremendous.  It&apos;s truly straight out of a Jetsons (automatically dating myself bigtime!) episode.  I&apos;ve never had that many choices for beverages at a burger joint with quite a few flavors I&apos;ve never seen like raspberry diet coke.

Now I have 2 unhealthy vices that I might have to indulge in once a month.  This and Nothing Bundt Cakes!

Move over In-N-Out!  Five Guys gets 5 stars from me!

Numerous toppings to select from and a great &quot;classic cheesybugery flavor&quot; that sticks to your ribs.  You have  to pay a little more for cheese and/or bacon, but all of their burgers, hotdogs, and sandwiches come with the option to add up to 15 different toppings at no additional charge.  Mmmm...I love the grilled onions&amp;mushrooms option.  You know you&apos;ve done some eating when you leave FGBF.

Have you ever had 2+ people in your party order the same thing (ie. cheeseburgers) with completely different toppings and then have them all tossed in the bag with no markings??  At FGBF they label each burger with a # that coordinates to the order in which your party placed their order.  I know it&apos;s a little thing, but it sooo delights me to not have to play musical burgers, trying to guess which one belongs to who.

Have no fear if you decide to make a pit stop while hanging with your cool vegan friends; they offer Vegan Sandwiches, which I&apos;ve heard are quite tasty.

I&apos;m no newbie to Cajun Fries, as I&apos;m originally from North Carolina, where I grew up eating Bojangle&apos;s Cajun Fries.  With that said, I did find FGBF a little overseasoned.  Next time I&apos;m planning to ask if they can do lightly seasoned Cajun Fries, otherwise their regular fries are outstanding.

The wait isn&apos;t long, but they offer peanuts to snack on (if you&apos;re not allergic) as you complete the final stage of your &quot;Get Some Beef in May Bellay&quot; mission.

My favorite part is an often overlooked place to excel in the customer experience, the soda dispenser.  As I approached this fancy pants machine, I&apos;m noticing all of these buttons!!  I press the Diet Coke button and then receive another (no less than) 6 options for flavored Diet Coke, ranging from cherry, cherry vanilla, vanilla, orange, lime, and one more.  They even offered all of these choices in the Caffeine Free Diet Coke variety as well.

They don&apos;t have a Drive-Thru window, but they offer online ordering.

Still pricey. Still a good burger.

One cool change...the super slick new digital coke machine. There are about 40 sodas to choose from! Pretty fun. For example, if you select sprite zero, you can then choose raspberry, strawberry, peach, grape, cherry, classic and so on! Fun!

Note to diners! I had forgotten.  The regular burger is really a double patty and the little is a single patty.

Another nice touch, five guys numbers your burgers along with your order on your receipt, so you don&apos;t have to dissect them to figure oput whos is whos.  Cool!

My 2-patty burger, fries&amp;coke set me back $12, about twice the cost at In-N-Out. There are no combo deals here, everything a la carte. Burger was tasty, fries not as good as In-N-Out, and Coke machine can make any flavor imaginable, but cherry syrup added to Coke is not the same as a Cherry Coke. They play good music here, but the seats are not that comfortable. Also have free peanuts here if u wanna sit around and crack shells, but i did not come here to be a peanut freak, I wanted to try the burger and fries.

We got a gift card as a xmas present (we just received it,lol)
I came on a busy Friday night and expected a long wait-especially since you can order ahead online....well! There was no one in line ahead of me, just a few people waiting on their orders.
I brought my daughter, who zoomed in on the boxes of peanuts and immediately poured a scoop for us. We bought one cup just to try the stellar soda machine; this thing is awesome, you choose on a touch screen which type of drink (coke products, lemonade, powered, etc.), then you choose a flavor for it. Most drinks have more than the usual cherry and vanilla options. We LOVED the peach sprite, tried vanilla root beer, and coke zero cherry/vanilla. Next time we&apos;ll try all the fanta flavors.
By the time we finished sampling sodas, our order was ready!
They have a simple menu-just bear in mind, the large burgers are two patties and the small burgers are one. The large fries fed our whole family of three,along with out burgers. We had cajun fries,which were amazing, of the &quot;steak fry&quot; variety. My burger was awesome, though I prefer In-n-outs just slightly over this one. They have a big assortment of topping at no extra charge and some option I forget the name, all in or something like that, that is pretty much the works.
All in all I would definitely return alone, with family in tow, or with friends.

I have been here twice and in both cases, I had similar experiences.  The burgers are pretty good, though I would prefer one thick patty that can be cooked more rare.  The burgers are large and messy...both good things.  They seem to be especially proud of their fries, even posting where the potatoes come from.  I had cajun fries and they were tasty and plentiful, but in my opinion, kind of expensive.

Two other things I liked were the free peanuts and the awesome soda machine.

A lot of people had hyped this place up - so my sister and I took it for a spin. I was not wowed. It literally was just okay.

My best description for it would be a cross between In-N-Out and Fatburger. Reasons why: Burger tastes like a fatburger patty. Large in size and similar consistency, except they don&apos;t have the topping I normally put on a fatburger (fried egg). Fries are an attempt at being similar to In-N-Out but fail. Tasted more like potato skin than potato and were overcooked.

On the plus side the place is bright, inviting, clean, and the workers are extremely helpful and polite.

I think this is just a matter of taste buds - you&apos;re either an In-N-Out fan or a Five Guys fan and I&apos;m just an In-N-Out fan.

Daughter, Kathy, and I were in need of Lunch; and we wanted to stay in this area... Five Guys was the choice, since Kathy knew I had been taste-testing one-pound Burgers in Northern California... where I live.

It was last Tuesday, a half hour before Noon, and there was no line at all at that time... Lucky, I guess.

If you&apos;re into Burgers, the menu is divided between the Single-Pattie Burgers preceded by &quot;Little&quot; in the name... And the double-Pattie kind... about a buck fifty difference in general. Toppings are free... Mayo, Lettuce, Pickles, Tomatoes, Grilled Onions, Grilled Mushrooms, Ketchup, Mustard, Relish, Onions, Jalapeno Peppers, A1 Steak Sauce, BBQ Sauce, and Hot Sauce.... whew! If you say &quot;Everything&quot; (or some synonym), you&apos;ll receive Mayo to Mustard piled on.

Question to clerk... &quot;What is your favorite Burger?&quot; Answer... &quot;I don&apos;t eat Burgers. I&apos;m a Vegetarian.&quot; Five Guys must be paying this clerk well... to have a Vegetarian work at a despicable Hamburger Stand.

Well... decided on the...

Cheeseburger (** 1/2 $5.79) Toppings consisted of Extra Mayo, Onions, Lettuce, Tomato&amp;Mustard.

Everyone Brown-Bags it at Five Guys... everyone... including dine-in customers. My first impression after unwrapping the Cheeseburger was the thought that this tastes like something familiar... couldn&apos;t come to a definite conclusion. But the general impression... nothing that would knock your socks off... in essence, Just a Burger! And an expensive one at that... especially with the Fries as an additional purchase! (See similar double-pattie from Burger King called a Buck Double...)

Regular Cajun Style Fries (** $2.89) if it weren&apos;t for the fact that the Fries came out cool and over-cooked.. this would be a pretty good pile of Fries... especially with the sprinkled Cajun Spice Powder.

As you all know... once the Fries get cool... they also get clumpy.... and you have to eat them faster, faster and faster before they get COLD!

Question to audience... Does Five Guys deliberately throw the Fries into the Brown Bag? Seems like it...

Regular Fountain Drink $1.99 x 2

Kathy&apos; order...
Bacon Cheese Dog (*** $4.99) No further comment by Kathy...

With all these raving positive comments plastered all over the wall, I expected more... a lot more.

At the end of the meal... I figured out what a Five Guys Burger tastes like... a McDonald&apos;s Big Mac! How disappointing!

Don&apos;t believe the hype...  This place was all over the broadcast and print news when they first started opening in Vegas, so when I wanted a burger, I figured &apos;What the heck?&apos;.  Well, as &apos;cool&apos; as the interiors are, and as nice as the employees were, I have to say I was extremely disappointed.  Maybe it&apos;s a case of too much hype, since they have quotes from other city reporters and periodicals posted all over the place stating how they&apos;re the best burgers ever.  I don&apos;t know, it just seemed ordinary to me.  Not bad, but not worth trecking there if it&apos;s not on your way to somewhere else.

Everything is served in brown paper bags, which is ok I guess.  Conserve water you&apos;d waste washing trays, but kill more trees with paper bags?  I guess it&apos;s a tradeoff.  One cool thing I enjoyed was the boxes of peanuts everywhere, and you nosh on those while you wait for your order.

Like I said, I wouldn&apos;t NOT go there, I just wouldn&apos;t go out of my way to go there.  I&apos;ll stick to IN-N-OUT.

First thing that attracted my attention when I walked in were the giant bags  of potatoes everywhere. It&apos;s a cool thing to see, but kind of makes the place looks messy, in my opinion. But, no big deal.

I had never been there before, so I wasn&apos;t really sure what to expect. It was a pleasant surprise that their toppings were free, especially since they offer grilled mushroom and onions. I ended up ordering the regular cheeseburger. What I wasn&apos;t expecting was that i was a double cheeseburger. You think they would put that somewhere, but maybe it was my bad for not asking what their portions were like.

All in all, it was a good experience. Did it live up to all the hype that I heard about it? No. I think it would&apos;ve been better had people not told me how much they liked it. I&apos;d probably go back - if I&apos;m in the neighborhood. I&apos;m still a sucker for In N out though.

As a burger person, I was really hesitant about trying this place, even though most of the people I know have done nothing but rave about it . So far I&apos;ve eaten there three times, and each is better than the last. Fantastic friendly service, phenomenal burgers, and their fries, oh, oh their fries. Anyone who thought that In-And-Out Burger was the pinnacle of fast food epicuriousness, prepare to be amazed. Everything from the free peanuts in bags located around the store, to their beautifully designed iPhone app is top notch. Just a great, relaxing, fun, enjoyable experience which makes you feel better walking out than walking in.

If you haven&apos;t tried it, please just do yourself a favor and stop by for a quick bite. You&apos;ll be as addicted as the rest of us in no time.

Best seasoned bag of fries in Las Vegas. But that&apos;s pretty much all this place have to offer for me. I love the free peanuts while waiting for my food. Just be sure to try to throw away your shells. Trust me, Arvin T. tested the theory of throwing shells on ground as adding to the decor. Embarrassingly failed.

I never add sauce or fillers to my burgers but here I have to. The meat is super-well done hence dry. You definitely want to add BBQ sauce, or mayo, or something to your burger to make it better.

If I had a choice, I&apos;d go to In and Out for my burgers and Five Guys for my fries.

If In n&apos; Out and Fuddrockers had an affair, Five Guys would be the illegitimate child (children?).

The red and white colors, and the uniform workers reminded me of In n Out. Building/ordering your own style burger reminds of Fudds.

I usually don&apos;t like the make your own burger joints, because I like to try the unique burger styles of different places. You know, what they come up with. But my burger ended up great and still unique.

Their main burgers come with two patties. I ordered the bacon Cheeseburger with grilled onions, mushrooms, mustard and BBQ sauce, and it came out mighty tasty.

They also take great pride in their fries. I&apos;m not a big fry guy, but they did seem good. They have bags of potatos all over the floor. And they tell you where in Idaho they come from.

The place seems pretty trendy. It was packed when we went.

My coworker and I were eagerly waiting for this place to open.. Finally, made our way here, a change from our usual &apos;go-to&apos; burger spot at Gorden Biersch.

First thing I noticed were sacks of potatoes, complimentary peanuts and some bright pink red patties cookin&apos; behind the counter..

Double Cheeseburger: Got it with mayo, lettuce and tomato. Not the most architecturally constructed burger but not nearly as sloppy as a Tommy&apos;s Burgers either. This thing hit the right notes for me! In regards to the the patty itself, it was Absolutely packed with that great burger taste! I liked it better than Smashburger (smashburger&apos;s slightly over salted for my taste) and I&apos;d probably take this over In-N-Out, 7/10 times (don&apos;t get me wrong, in n out is awesome).. I did notice the bottom bun starting to sponge in some of the juices from the patty but it didn&apos;t bother me much.

French Fries: Large was more than enough for 2. Their fries were fried more over done than the usual and with skin-on. I liked them, and the thought of them utilizing fresh potatoes may have mentally helped..

Service typical. Ambiance was cool and interesting with all the peanuts shells scattered on the floor surrounded by potato sacks. Value was fair for quantity But I thinkt the quality of the Burger makes up for it!

I was really excited about this place and because I love all types of french fries, I figured I would like these, too.  Skin on fries are my favorite.  But these were just soggy.  And the cajun seasoning was surprisingly bland.

I didn&apos;t realize that a regular cheeseburger was two patties.  So it was way too much food for me.  The bun got pretty soggy.  But I liked the burger and the unlimited toppings.  I would recommend getting the Little Hamburger or Little Cheeseburger and less toppings in order to preserve the bun.  Or just eat it with a knife and fork.

I agree with the other reviewers that the restaurant was super noisy. Not sure where the noise was coming from because it wasn&apos;t crowded. But the staff was super friendly.  The unlimited peanuts was a nice touch although the warnings all over the store about peanut allergies and not giving them to kids made it seem like it wasn&apos;t worth it for the business to offer them.

Like  most food, I guess it depends what you&apos;ve grown up with. If you&apos;ve grown up with In-N-Out, like me, this place may not cut it.

No doubt it&apos;s a good burger, but $20+ for me and the wife to eat burgers and fries?

Sure you can throw unlimited toppings on your burger, but once you get 2 or 3 on there all you are accomplishing is creating a burger that you can&apos;t fit in your mouth. The hero of a great burger is the meat, right? You start tossing around multiple toppings all willy-nilly you end up with a burger that might have had a nice juicy patty of wonderful beefy goodness in there somewhere, you just can&apos;t remeber anymore.

The large order of fries is definately large and enough to feed Kate, plus her eight, plus her douche-bag ex and still have some to take home. And while the cajun fries are tasty, they get a little old by the end of the bag.

I am sure this sounds like a negative review, I promise, it&apos;s not. Just honest. I will be back. It&apos;s a good burger. I will refrain from comparing it to In-N-Out; apples and oranges as far as I am concerned. But I will say that if I am torn between 5 guys or In-N-Out, an animal style double double will win out every time.

Aura: As soon as you walk in, Its a friendly, welcoming atmosphere. Clean, cheery modern music,&amp;professional attitudes. You can see everything is made fresh.

Fries: They give you more than enough fries. Like twice as much you can fill in one order. Not too salty, but still are unique in flavor. I recommend the Cajun seasoning.

Cheeseburger: Crispy but not dry. There&apos;s different sizes you can choose for your patty. A regular is like a double cheeseburger. Made in peanut oil&amp;tastes delicious! I usually put jalapeño peppers, hot sauce, grilled onions, lettuce&amp;mayo. There&apos;s lots of options. But with any combo you like, the meat makes it even better.

Drinks: They have options that range from Coke products to gold peak teas. Nothing special like typical Malts or milkshakes.
