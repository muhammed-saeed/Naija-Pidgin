Plan&amp;prepare before the morning arrives. Identify&amp;stage everyones outfit the night before. Nightly, stage&amp;measure the food items for breakfast.
 Lisa S. | January 19, 2011 at 12:19 pm | 
I have Fibromyalgia so keeping my mornings stress free is a must! I make muffins in large batches and freeze them for my husbands breakfast, so every evening before bed, I set up the coffee maker and take a muffin out of the freezer for the next mornings breakfast.
 Hannah | January 19, 2011 at 12:20 pm | 
We have these at work and they are terrific! Would love to have one at home too!
 April W | January 19, 2011 at 12:20 pm | 
My Tip for Morning Routines:
Have small children. Although I rarely manage to rise when my alarm clock sounds and my coffee pot brews, I never oversleep since my youngest child awakens me by climbing into my bed and effectively shoving me out. I’m awake and ready for my coffee!
 Gloria Kerrigan | January 19, 2011 at 12:22 pm | 
Maintain the same bedtime each night, this makes getting up with the alarm much easier! Clothes for the day, lunches, and backpacks ready night before. Having on hand healthy breakfast choices accessible to the kids, they can grab yogurt, fruit, whole grain bagels, etc…while they eat I get dressed.
 Deanna | January 19, 2011 at 12:23 pm | 
I use a lot of appliances! I use my Keurig every morning for coffee or chai. I also use a bullet type blender to make smoothies with green tea or protein powder. I make my lunches the night before and buy thing like yogurt and fruit that are easy to transport.
 PAM BARBEE | January 19, 2011 at 12:24 pm | 
To get ready in the morning without too much drama, the night before I have everyone lay their clothes, check their backpacks&amp;book bags, make sure they have enough money for lunch, snacks&amp;any other activity. I also have anything that can be set on a timer like the coffee&amp;hot curlers set&amp;ready to be hot when we are ready to use them. I have a breakfast menu that everyone looked at the night before, made their selections&amp;I am ready to start cooking without having to waste time seeing what everyone wants to eat when they are still trying to wake up&amp;make that decisions. The Keurig brewer with it’s built-in timer would be a great addition&amp;another advantage to a stress free morning.
 Sarah | January 19, 2011 at 12:24 pm | 
To make our morning routine more efficient, our family cleans the night before. We don’t go to bed until the dishes are done, laundry is going, every surface is wiped down, and floors are spotless. It’s great to wake up to and helps everyone get out the door on time!
 Sharon Elliott | January 19, 2011 at 12:25 pm | 
The night before I set up the coffeemaker and the smell of coffee is so wonderful. When I wake up in the morning the smell of the coffee is so invigorating. Even the kids enjoy the smell and it helps wake them up. And when we wake up smelling the coffee everyone is in a good mood which makes for a great day.
 Linda W. | January 19, 2011 at 12:26 pm | 
Have the clothes out and ironed the night before as well as having the lunches made. We set up the coffeemaker with the timer to brew before we are up and have our coffee ready to go.
 Heather Mishoe | January 19, 2011 at 12:27 pm | 
I love planning the night before to help the mornings go smoother

Saving time for me is preparing at night. Prepare lunches, bottles, and prepare coffee pot at night and my convineant timer set for 5:30. Kids bathed at night car packed. Only have to get myself and change kids and we are out the door
 Lisa | January 19, 2011 at 12:28 pm | 
Back in the day when I had to get to work early I made sure that my kids clothes were laid out, shoes nearby, and all their school things. The kids knew where everything was and that saved me a lot of time hunting for everything.
 celeste parker | January 19, 2011 at 12:28 pm | 
It is impossible for me to save time in the mornings I am always running late but…..I keep the TV turned off seems to keep everyone focused and on task Also set the kitchen clocks a bit fast 
 M Cameron | January 19, 2011 at 12:29 pm | 
Have the clothes out night before&amp;backpacks ready to go by the door.
 sherry newman | January 19, 2011 at 12:29 pm | 
i have 2 kids so make as much of their lunches up as i can the night before and get myself ready before they wake up
 Karen Perea | January 19, 2011 at 12:29 pm | 
My kids HATE to get up in the morning. I have them shower and have everything organized at night and then they get dressed for school. In the morning all they have to do is put on their shoes, go potty and brush their teeth and walk out the door. I buy them clothes that are wrinkle resitant but if they get wrinkled I have a name brand wrinkle remover product I use. I have joint custody so their school is 30 minutes away from my house so we leave early. My kids eat breakfast at their school so we do not need to worry about that in the mornings.
 Laurie Thompson | January 19, 2011 at 12:29 pm | 
I get everything ready the night before. I put lunch money in my kids pockets, socks inside their shoes and bookbags beside the front door. I hate to have to search for things in the morning.
 Dawn O | January 19, 2011 at 12:29 pm | 
The key for me to have a less stressful morning is to make sure that I get up and have had my shower b4 my children get up. If they start talking b4 I’ve had a nice hot shower, the morning does not go so well.
 Roseanne A | January 19, 2011 at 12:29 pm | 
I have everything ready for the kids that was done the night before and I have the K-cups right next to the Keurig so there is no wasting time! We are ready to go.
 Annette | January 19, 2011 at 12:29 pm | 
I gather everything that needs to go out the door the night before and I have a spot by the door where I place it. That way, it’s difficult to miss.
 Kim | January 19, 2011 at 12:29 pm | 
before I go to bed–I do everything in stages, make everyone’s lunch, lay out clothes, put everything together on the countour (that I can) for breakfast. That way when the alarm goes off everyone knows what to do and it’s easy to grab and go. If I don’t have time I have the whole family participate in getting ready the night before. That teaches everyone to pitch in and get organized.
 Jeanette McMahon | January 19, 2011 at 12:30 pm | 
Whatever you can get prepped or situated the night before always helps; coffee, lunches, clothing, keys, thing you’ll need for the day, healthy snacks, bottle some water, prep dinner&amp;make sure you take care of yourself too, schedule your workout, eat well, that should help make your day go smoother. If we don’t take care of ourselves, how can you take care of others?
 hdgpdg | January 19, 2011 at 12:30 pm | 
Do a much as you can the night before–lay out clothes, pack lunch, have things ready for your breakfast, shower the night before.
 Stephanie | January 19, 2011 at 12:30 pm | 
I have everything laid out and organized the night before! Full outfits hang on the back of bedroom doors, coffee pot automatically starts at 6:30, lunches are already made and in the fridge, I even make sure coats and my purse (with keys inside) are all ready to go! It’s little things, but it adds up to a lot of time spent if you are running round trying to find a shirt and pants that match, or figuring out what the pack for lunch, etc.
 Mary Levens | January 19, 2011 at 12:30 pm | 
My sister has one of these and says it makes her mornings so much easier with getting the kids out etc. I have to run my kids all the time would be great to be able to get a quick cup of coffee to take on the go and not have to wait for the whole coffee maker to get done.
 sydney anderson | January 19, 2011 at 12:30 pm | 
I make and set the timer on the coffeemaker, then I make husbands lunch, and then go to bed nice and early to make sure everything goes smootly in the moring!!
 Christy Huggett | January 19, 2011 at 12:30 pm | 
I have everything ready to go the night before including setting the timer on my coffee maker…
My morning includes daily devotional time which helps make the day brighter!!
 Gina | January 19, 2011 at 12:31 pm | 
We try to have all of our clothes, backpacks, etc ready each night and set the alarm a few minutes early each AM. This allows for coffee time before work and gives us a little wiggle room in case of unexpected problems.
 Jen Leo | January 19, 2011 at 12:31 pm | 
With 2 dogs, a husband, and a 2 year old, our mornings are CRAZY! To help me keep my sanity I do a few things before going to bed each night: 1. set the coffeemaker to brew before we get up. 2.Measure out the dog’s food into their dishes so I can just plop them down in the morning. 3. every weekend I make a massive batch of waffles so I can just throw a couple in the toaster for the toddler’s breakfast. 4. Make sure all sippy cups are full and prepared for the day
 Patricia Florek | January 19, 2011 at 12:31 pm | 
I set my coffe to brew so it’s ready when I wake up in the morning. I really would love to win a Keurig pbrewer so I can have coffee all day&amp;not have to wait for it!
 Mary Ridgeway | January 19, 2011 at 12:31 pm | 
Always have clothes out and ready, even down to socks and underwear! Backpacks are packed and ready the night before. I have to pack lunches as well so I try to have the lunchboxes and containers for the food ready so I can just pack and go. On busy mornings we try to do healthy but quick items for breakfast and leave bigger breakfasts for the weekend. But always have to have coffee!
 Kacie | January 19, 2011 at 12:31 pm | 
If you prefer ice coffee like me, prepare the coffee the night before. Fill 2 ice cube trays with the coffee and put another cup in the fridge. In the morning put it all in a blender with a generous squirt of chocolate syrup and a touch of milk and blend for 30 sec. You will have yourself a Grade A Iced Mocha Frappachino that will rival Starbucks!
 Blakely Segroves | January 19, 2011 at 12:31 pm | 
The night before, I always get my coffe pot ready and set it to come on bright and early. I have two small children so I always get their lunches, back packs, clothes, etc ready the night before. I also make sure that I have all of my clothes together. The thing that saves me the most time in the mornings is making sure EVERYTHING is in the place where they belong (keys, cell phone, etc). I also have a note pad handy for any reminders like taking snacks out of fridge, etc. I already like you on FB!!!
 Leslie Walter | January 19, 2011 at 12:31 pm | 
Set up the coffee pot the night before. If I“smell the coffee”my day has begun.
 Sandra | January 19, 2011 at 12:31 pm | 
Prepare the coffee pot the night before. If it has a timer, set it. Also plan what to wear the night before. You have no idea how many times I’ve stood in front of the closet with 5 minutes left before time to leave with“nothing to wear”.
 LorrieC | January 19, 2011 at 12:31 pm | 
I love my Keurig coffee maker. I find it is such a timesaver in the morning. No coffee to grind and wait to drip into a carafe, just place a kcup in the maker, place a cup underneath, bring the cover down, hot cup of coffee in less than 1 minute!! It is the best coffee maker ever!!!!
 Cindy Beffrey | January 19, 2011 at 12:31 pm | 
I make sure everything is ready for the day the night before. I like my time in the morning to be relaxed and having everything clean and organized helps me to relax before starting my day.
 Sheree | January 19, 2011 at 12:32 pm | 
My tip is getting ready the night before. I have lunches made,clothes laid out, breakfast planned…most important make sure homework is done. To top all that work off a Keurig would be great in the morning.
 Christyne Frye | January 19, 2011 at 12:32 pm | 
I do as much the night before as possible. Lay out outfits, pack bags, lunches and gather anything we need for the next day. The best thing is put the plates on the counter or table for breakfast. Taht way my children don’t need me to start to eat.
 Donna | January 19, 2011 at 12:32 pm | 
The things that saves us time in the morning is to try to get everything ready the night before. From our cloths, lunches, book bag/work bag, and anything else needed for the next day. This save time trying to get it all together and ready at the last minute!
 Holly Jones | January 19, 2011 at 12:32 pm | 
we plan breakfast the night before and also set the coffee pot to start on its own!! schedules are extremely important for my son who is autistic so things have to stay the same as much as they can!!
 Tanya Herb | January 19, 2011 at 12:32 pm | 
Well, I have 4 boys and I’ve learned one thing, COFFEE!!! Just get up and DO IT!! Ok so getting a bath and laying clothes out the night before helps, but in my unperfectly perfect world that doesn’t happen often, so yep, COFFEE!! That’s my story, and I’m sticking to it! 
 Kim Curry | January 19, 2011 at 12:32 pm | 
I already like All You on FB. My easy morning routine is simple. I get everything ready the night before. Clothing, backpacks, cereal in covered bowls on the table, coffee maker set on a timer, coats by the door, and my items for the day in my car so I don’t forget anything.
 Lee | January 19, 2011 at 12:32 pm | 
The night before: lay out your clothes, get your breakfast and lunch packed and ready and set up the coffee maker. Leave your car keys always in the same spot so you don’t have to scramble and search for them every morning. I leave my pocketbook right by the front door (actually blocking the door) along with my keys.
 Sandy McKinney | January 19, 2011 at 12:32 pm | 
A good nights sleep and a positive attitude go a long way. Makes for a better day too. Did I mention lots and lots of coffee?????
 Jodi | January 19, 2011 at 12:32 pm | 
Have everything set for the next morning-coffee set to a timer, lunch ready, dinner all set for the crockpot, and shower the night before!
 Carmen | January 19, 2011 at 12:33 pm | 
Well, this is so not new or creative…but it works…After the boys are in bed, I check the calendar to see what is going on the next day. I prepare any lunches that are needed for the next day, what I can prepare for breakfast, I do (including getting the cereal in a bowl with a lid, coffee pot set, I lay clothes out for boys and myself, get any bags to the front door or even in the car, if I’m not too tired. I will sometimes make myself a list for the next day and tape it to the front door. I know this may sound anal, but it helps me mentally prepare for the next day so that I can sleep better. Plus, with my husband’s 24 on 48 off schedule and many meetings, it is a must so that I know if he will be there to help.
 Nancy | January 19, 2011 at 12:33 pm | 
Do as much as you can the night before! I pack my kids’lunches, get out their outfits for the next day, and make sure the coffee pot is ready so all I need to do is push the button when I get up!
 Kimberly86 | January 19, 2011 at 12:33 pm | 
I pour each kid a cup of milk and put a lid on it. In the morning they each grab their cup and pour it over their cereal. Makes them independent, and saves time and spills.
 April Ockerman | January 19, 2011 at 12:33 pm | 
I have young ones at home. I get my coffee set up the night before, that way it is already brewing when I wake. We keep the same bedtime that way they have a predictable routine. If we are going out during the day, I freeze yogurt and applesauce to keep their other food and milk cold so when lunch/snack time comes around it is defrosted and the milk stays cold too. I also keep my diaper bag packed and ready to go with snacks, diapers, other essentials; so if we ever have to leave last minute I don’t have to go scrambling around to get a bag ready. When I come home from being out, I restock the diaper bag and know we won’t run out of things.
 Beach-Bum Barb | January 19, 2011 at 12:33 pm | 
I get my husband to get everything ready&amp;then have him wake me so all I have to do is push a button, and the coffee is done!! What a lover-boy )
 Martine Benzio | January 19, 2011 at 12:33 pm | 
I stay focused and stay of the computer and facebook!
 Sandy B | January 19, 2011 at 12:33 pm | 
I always make sure I have my coffee before I do anything-I need that shot of caffeine before I start! After that, since my mind fog clears up, I can rush through my morning ablutions and outfit selection much faster and without confusion.
 Sarah W | January 19, 2011 at 12:33 pm | 
The night before, I pour dry cereal into bowls, set the table with spoons,napkins and mugs for juice and put out vitamins. It makes things go so much faster in the morning routine.
 Trisha | January 19, 2011 at 12:33 pm | 
I have a hard time getting going in the morning. I’ve found that setting my son’s alarm to give him enough time to get ready to go helps me out by giving me a little more time to get my stuff together and sleep a few minutes more!
 cindy champion | January 19, 2011 at 12:33 pm | 
I pick my outfit out before bed and make my lunch. I find this saves me lots of time in the morning.
 Julie P | January 19, 2011 at 12:33 pm | 
I make sure all clothes are set out the night before&amp;my son’s backpack is ready to go. I even have my own clothes&amp;accessories laid out&amp;ready. The more I can have ready the night before the better.
 Jill Stowasser | January 19, 2011 at 12:33 pm | 
Timing is everything, each teen has their own shower/bath time so that there is no fights, setting everything out the night before like clothes, backpacks (homework) and shoes/jackets. Setting up or out the coffee machine, breakfast items, lunch items or anything thing else that needs to be put together or made. Also, checking in with the kids the night before to see that they have money, forms signed, homework done, clothes washed they want to wear or if there is anything special they need, really saves on running around in the morning.
 Alexis H | January 19, 2011 at 12:33 pm | 
I make sure lunches, and diaper bags are ready the night before. That way I have time to spend with my little in the morning before we head to day care and work!
 Brandi B. | January 19, 2011 at 12:33 pm | 
I have 5 kids in three different schools..so winning this would be a great time saver on top of what I already do! I have each kiddo lay out their clothes for the morning. I also get their cereal and bowls out and on the counter for the next morning before I go to bed. This way they only have to pour the milk and eat. Ive also found that quart size milk jugs are easier for small hands to pour by themselves. 
 Mandolin Ziadie | January 19, 2011 at 12:34 pm | 
I prepare everything the evening before and make it flow out my door: when I wake to my set alarm, I walk into the bathroom where everything is already set out (including my entire outfit and makeup), walk downstairs after showering and getting dressed to find my coffee brewed and ready to be poured into my travel mug, my lunch prepacked and ready to pop into my bag (which is right next to the fridge) and my jacket and shoes on the stand next to the front door, ready to be quickly thrown on (with my gloves and car keys already in the pocket of my jacket!) My entire routine takes under 30 minutes on most days!
 Shelly | January 19, 2011 at 12:34 pm | 
I already“like”All You My biggest time saver, other than sticking to a routine for all 6 of us and having lunches made the night before, is specific to being the mother of an infant. I shower, do my hair&amp;makeup all before anyone else gets up but I don’t get dressed until everyone else is dressed and practically ready (I wear a robe). It seems like my 7 month old always seems to make a mess of me in one way or the other and this just saves time changing outfits not to mention saving my sanity!
 Melissa | January 19, 2011 at 12:34 pm | 
My morning routine is preplanned the night before. The kids have to pack their backpacks and get out their clothes for school. If I need to make a lunch, I make it the night before and just pull it out of the fridge. My biggest time savor is NOT TO TURN ON THE TV! The kids get tuned into whatever is on and won’t get ready for school. I usually don’t get a cup of coffee until I come home from dropping them off. WOuld love to be able to have a cup before I drop them off!!
 Heather Osgood | January 19, 2011 at 12:34 pm | 
I make sure I have all the kids clothes laid out the night before. Their coats&amp;book bags are by the door so they can pick up when they head out for the bus. I also love prepping our breakfast meal the night before. For example one of our favorites is french toast casserole. I cube my bread the night before&amp;cover it with foil. I also mix together all the wet ingredients&amp;leave them in the fridge so when I wake up I just have to mix the 2 together&amp;bake! This is also easily done with different casseroles, quiches,&amp;muffin mixes. If I make a quiche you can easily keep the wet ingredients in the fridge, cube the bread&amp;cut up all the veggies the night before. Such a major time saver&amp;you&amp;your kids still get a delicious&amp;healthy breakfast!
 Whitney | January 19, 2011 at 12:34 pm | 
Ohh My best time saver in the morning is the night before, I write down everything I need to do the next morning (important stuff near the top), so I am not running around trying to remember things. Besides getting everything together the night before, I try to cross off things as I do them the morning. It makes me feel productive and I rarely forget to do things like start the coffee maker!
 Chandra Tresaugue | January 19, 2011 at 12:34 pm | 
I bought a hanging sweater organizer for each of my daughters and have it hanging in their closet. It is large enough to hold a weeks worth of outfits. During the weekend laundry cleaning, I have my girls pick out the outfits they will wear during the week, and place everything except shoes (including panties/socks/etc) in each cubby (M-F). In the morning all they have to do is grab and outfit, no digging through drawers or having a hard time deciding which outfit to where, the work is already done!
 Marcela Zacharova | January 19, 2011 at 12:34 pm | 
Get ready the night before and have a good cup of coffee in the morning

Well currently I get the coffee pot ready to go the night before…but with a Keurig I wouldn’t have to do that anymore!!! Then my husband and I wouldn’t have to draw straws on who has to get it ready that night. WIN WIN either way
 April Pilkington | January 19, 2011 at 12:34 pm | 
I have 2 year old twins and a 9 and 4 year old. The twins are up b4 the sun. I don’t really have a morning routine, because something diffrent always happens every morning. I just say a prayer, put a smile on my face and do what needs to be done and look foward to nap time! 
 josephine hartline | January 19, 2011 at 12:34 pm | 
To save time in the morning I now use a kitchen timer for facebook. Still have my coffee but get more accomplished.
 patty urso | January 19, 2011 at 12:34 pm | 
get all lunches done the night before and get up early so i can relax as i get ready instead of being hurried and making mistakes (which takes more time anyway with corrections!)
 Susanne | January 19, 2011 at 12:35 pm | 
I am already on my second one–I used the first one so much, that it broke–got a new one, because I don’t want to be without it! I use mine to wind down after taking the kids to school in the morning, I come back home, and fish through all my flavors…. Depending on the morning, I use this to start my day off right. All the flavors help to set the stage for the morning. If I have a lot to do, I go with something with a lot of bang! But some mornings, I just chillax, and then I do a soft, comfortable flavor like pumpkin spice or butter toffee…. LOVE IT!!! I tell everyone to get one!
 Gloria | January 19, 2011 at 12:35 pm | 
I nake my coffee each morning when I finish that mornings coffee.I set the timer so it is just finishing brewing when my alarm goes off. Each noght before I go to bed, I put out my cup and spoon on a paper towel and set my sweetner there too. Then all I have to do is grab the creamer and drink. Would be better if I could find someone to bring it to me in bed, but this works.

To keep mornings going smooth I like to use my crockpot to make oatmeal overnight. It’s hot and ready when we get up. I preset the coffee pot to come on too. I’d like to get clothes set out for my boys…but I haven’t gotten that accomplished yet.
 PM Cameron | January 19, 2011 at 12:35 pm | 
Don’t wait til the last minute!
 Coretta Harris | January 19, 2011 at 12:35 pm | 
My best advice for saving time in the morning is to wake up a couple of hours earlier than I normally do.(If I have to be at work at 8am, I wake up at 6am) It gives me time to relax, get dressed, eat breakfast, etc.,versus getting up later and feeling rushed.
 Carla Phillips | January 19, 2011 at 12:35 pm | 
Prepare everything the night before, including dogs food and meds. Say a prayer when I go to bed and when I get up.
 Amy | January 19, 2011 at 12:35 pm | 
Having a writen plan helps my sanity…I never fell like I’m forgetting anything when i can see what’s coming up at a glance.
 Angie Merchant | January 19, 2011 at 12:35 pm | 
I already like ALL YOU! Clean my sink out the night before!
 Jamie | January 19, 2011 at 12:36 pm | 
My husband and I split duties. He’s out feeding the dog while I’m packing lunches, making coffee and“opening up”the house to the morning. Also, he’ll make breakfast for him and our son while I’m getting ready for the day. Works out really well.
 nancy Horta | January 19, 2011 at 12:36 pm | 
First of all…. I“Like”all you on FB already 
Second I LOVE ALL YOU on a regular basis!!!!! It’s my favorite magazine!!!!!

Myself and my Husband….. On the weekend, I preplan dinners for the week…this way they just have to be taken out of the fridge or the freezer to be cooked. One day a week I do a crockpot meal. As for mornings, Lunch is prepared the night before and in the frige! Our coffee machine is on timer…. Showers are taken the night before, and our outfits are picked out and ready to slip on!
The most I do in the morning is take the dogs out and feed them, as well as prepare breakfast. I like to get up extra early to enjoy a half hour with breakfast and coffee and my pets 
 Robyn Clark | January 19, 2011 at 12:36 pm | 
I’m a very organized person so everything is ready the night before but when I get out of bed the first thing I do is grab my robe, go to the kitchen and turn on my Keurig and pick out my coffee so when I pop out of the shower a few minutes later, I can have my coffee w/i minutes and off I go to start my morning routine. Good coffee is the key to my day!!
 Karen Buss | January 19, 2011 at 12:36 pm | 
It goes without saying start your day with a moment of meditation whether prayer or just a moment of reflection, to calm your mind. Everything you can do in the evening to simplify your morning is great. A happy attitude helps keep the family on track doing much to help keep the morning at a good pacse.
 Amy K | January 19, 2011 at 12:36 pm | 
Hit snooze button until I hear coffee beans start grinding in the coffeemaker preprogrammed the night before. Then I take a quick shower, get ready for work and collect my daughter to leave. Juggling my daughter, diaper bag, purse, and coffee mug to the car. Then it’s off to Grandmas!
 Emily | January 19, 2011 at 12:36 pm | 
Besides having everything cleaned and all the clothes ready to go from the night before, why don’t we try to have our…hudsbands prepare everything in the morning!! That should reaallyyy save us time in the morning!
 Kelli | January 19, 2011 at 12:36 pm | 
I have found, as hard as it may be, to prepare the night before AND get up and ready before the rest of the house does. Picking out outfits, shoes, and matching haibows makes it so much easier if I do it at night instead of scrambing the next morning. I also find that when I am ready I do not feel as rushed and it allows me to direct more attentionto my family’s needs!
 Nancy Stymacks | January 19, 2011 at 12:36 pm | 
The night before I have my clothes picked out&amp;ready and my lunch is packed-up in the refrigerator, so all I have to do is wake up and not make any clothes or lunch decisions! It really saves so much time.
 stacey b. | January 19, 2011 at 12:36 pm | 
I cook my eggs in the microwave so breakfast is fast and nutritious. Just break it in a microwave safe bowl and poke the yolk so it doesn’t explode. Then cook on 1:10 and it is perfect!
 s johnson | January 19, 2011 at 12:36 pm | 
I prepare my son’s lunch, the night before. I make sure everything he needs, for the next day, is in his backpack and it is out waiting for him in the morning. In the morning i set him up with his breakfast, and because he is only 6, I have all his clothes laid out for him. Meanwhile, I start to get myself ready for the day too. My secret is simple, wake up on time, even on those cold dark mornings. Sometimes, that’s hard to do, but better to be ready,steady and on time, than feeling rushed and late. Of course, after I have him on the bus, I reward myself with a few cups of coffee. Boy, a Keurig coffee maker would be a great reward for all my hard work ! A mom’s job, is never done, but is always rewarding !
 Brande | January 19, 2011 at 12:37 pm | 
Don’t rush and get yourself and everyone in a tissy. Don’t let take another 5 minutes of sleep and enjoy a little family time in the AM and make sure to give everyone a kiss good morning!
 myrna | January 19, 2011 at 12:37 pm | 
I have 4 children, so mornings can be b.u.s.y. To help, I stagger wake up calls, from oldest to youngest, by 10 minutes. Since the 2 younger children shower the night before, they don’t need as much time to get ready for school. The older 2 then get plenty of time to shower w/o the everyone knocking at the door. We also choose clothes the night before–this is especially helpful for my fashionistas who would otherwise NEVER be ready on time!
This routine works wonderfully for us and everyone manages to eat together and they are all ready to leave the house at the same time.
 KC | January 19, 2011 at 12:37 pm | 
I also try to get everything prepared the night before. For us, that means making sure that both my husband and I have our work clothes prepared and that we have everything ready for our son to go to daycare. A quick cup of coffee would be so helpful when my son decides to start acting his age (almost 2 1/2) and throws everything off schedule!
 sarah | January 19, 2011 at 12:37 pm | 
I have a preteen girl, a two year old boy and a 3 month old boy. My husband leaves very early in the morning so I am on my own in the am. I am a teacher and MUST be to work on time! thankfully my husband makes the coffee in the morning so that saves me time. I am the ONLY one who showers in the am. My daughter and the boys bath and shower at night.While I am in the shower I drop waffles for older kids and turn the dryer on…(yes there is ALWAYS a loaf ready to go!) I guess the thing that saves me the most time is I no longer do my hair and make up…I would much rather have a 5 minute cuddle with my toddler or relax and feed my baby…..it is all worth it!~ Off to LIKE on FACEBOOK!
 cathy miller / rewcath | January 19, 2011 at 12:37 pm | 
My tip for saving time in the morning is for me to stick to my morning routine, I leave plenty of time to have a couple of cups of coffee, then wash, dress and I’m ready for the day–same routine everyday and plenty of time.
 Tanya | January 19, 2011 at 12:38 pm | 
Make sure everyone is showered, clothing is laid out, lunches are packed and the coffee timer is on and ready to get me started early!
 Martha Green | January 19, 2011 at 12:38 pm | 
I plan and visualize the next day. Lay out clothes, fix lunch box and even write down the things I want to get accomplished.
 Kelly | January 19, 2011 at 12:38 pm | 
I get EVERYTHING ready the night before! I get my clothes and accessories, my kids’clothes (including socks, underwear and shoes) all set out and ready to put on. I have my purse, keys, and packed backpacks ready at the door. I have lunches ready to grab in the fridge. The coffee maker is on a timer so it is already brewed when we get downstairs. Breakfast items are ready to go and the plates and utensils are on the table. Basically we are on automatic pilot in the morning! It is amazing how 20 minutes of work at night can save you hours of insanity in the morning!
 Lynn Seppala | January 19, 2011 at 12:38 pm | 
I set the timer on the coffee machine so it is ready when I need it. I also have my kids get their bags together the night before so we aren’t running around in the morning trying to remember everything. I also have a rule in the mornings of no tv and no games until they are bathed, dressed and fed. That cut down on the dilly dallying in the morning the most! IF they are all ready, they can watch a little before going to school.
 Renee Klevenhagen | January 19, 2011 at 12:38 pm | 
After we eat supper at night, we include making the coffee for the next morning in our routine. As we wash the dishes, we wash out our travel mugs, grind the coffee and get the percolator ready. We get the sugar into the cups at that time, too. At night we have tea so while the dishes are being washed and dried we boil the water so it is done by the time we are and we sit and have our tea. In the morning all we have to do is plug in the percolator and pour the coffee, which is ready by the time we are!
 Mary Harvey | January 19, 2011 at 12:38 pm | 
I am NOT a morning person so being prepared is imperative to keep me grouch-free! I get TWO outfits set out for my 7yr old son so he has a choice because otherwise he will complain about what I laid out and this really heads off any arguments (and delays) in the morning. I also have my clothes ready. I check my office voice mail messages from home the night before so I am prepared for the following day.
 Teresa Weyer | January 19, 2011 at 12:38 pm | 
I set my alarm on my phone to let me know when it’s time to get out the door, but in the morning, I already have my coffee grounded the night before. Everything by the door so I can grab it on the way out and in the morning I have my food already in it’s container and ready to grab and put into my lunch box, For breakfast, I already have prepared for the week my breakfast–I have 1 cup prep bowls that can be used in the microwave/oven and comes with lids to put into the fridge. I have frittata’s or I have oatmeal prepared or what ever I feel like. But all I need to do is put it in the microwave for about 30-45 seconds and it’s ready, I have even made muffins in my prep bowls! I couldn’t live with out them!
 shirley delp | January 19, 2011 at 12:39 pm | 
GET AS MUCH DONE THE EVENING BEFORE, TO PREPARE FOR THE WORKDAY. SHOES, CLOTHES, LUNCH ALL PICKED OUT AND READY TO GO
 Kati Mertel | January 19, 2011 at 12:39 pm | 
I am NOT a morning person to say the least. My morning consists of hitting the snooze 3 to 4x, or until my husband yanks all the covers off me. The first thing I do in the morning is stumble my way to the coffee pot, I am not coherent without my coffee in the morning. I TRY to remember to prep the coffee the night before, or even set the programmable timer .. but never fails I always forget or get side tracked with helping my husband get ready for work the next day, studying for school, prepping dinner for the next day, or working on remodeling our house. It also does not help that I work nights but I still get up with my husband at 6:30 so I can see him for a little bit, and make him breakfast. I think the Keurig would be great to have in the morning so I wouldn’t have to make a pot of coffee for my self, or if I am not feeling coffee I have other choices at the touch of a button. I think it would be even more convenient for those mornings when i did not prep the coffee the night before and it is ready to go in a split second instead of waiting for the pot to fill up.
 Kara | January 19, 2011 at 12:39 pm | 
The night before my husband sets up the coffee maker so we wake up to the smell of fresh coffee. I also pick out my outfit and have it hanging in the bathroom. I also get out my curling iron, hair dryer and make-up and have it ready on the bathroom counter.
 Patty | January 19, 2011 at 12:39 pm | 
I prepare my lunch the night before. I make sure I have my outfit picked out the night before. The coffee is already setup to go the next morning. I generally wash my hair the night before but If I don’t wash my hair the night before I have a restyling spray so It will not take me long to do my hair.
 Wendy | January 19, 2011 at 12:39 pm | 
I would wake up at 4 am (i have to work at 6 am)
I would wake my son up and change him&amp;feed him. put him in his swing while i got ready for work. Take my son to my mom’s house around 5:30 feed him again put him back to bed and then go to work
 Theresa | January 19, 2011 at 12:39 pm | 
Utilize kitchen products and devote a section of countertops and cabinets for hectic breakfast time. Have coffee, sweetener and mugs by or in the cabinet above the coffeemaker. Use plastic cereal savers or a cereal dispenser in the same area so you don’t have to mess with a cardboard box and its inner plastic bag.
 Jacqui | January 19, 2011 at 12:39 pm | 
It’s embarrassing to admit, but I multitask while peeing…I have a wall mirror that pulls out far enough for me to do my make-up or flat iron my hair while sitting on the pot! It’s quite the time saver!
 Jennifer Turner | January 19, 2011 at 12:40 pm | 
I am not a morning person&gt;&lt;even though I have to be at work at 5 am. My husband is up before and has my coffee for me and has my car running.:) You see, we live in Wisconsin where the weather gets really.
 Sonia B | January 19, 2011 at 12:40 pm | 
Make lunch the night before, set clothes out,tidy up&amp;get everything else ready for the next day. Saves you time&amp;sanity when there isn’t much to do first thing in the morning.
 Erika T. | January 19, 2011 at 12:40 pm | 
The key for me is to plan ahead. I make a list of everything that I need to have done in the morning the night before. I also set out outfits for myself and my son so there is no hassle with getting dressed. Also a good tip is to leave post it notes on the fridge or even on your steering wheel of things you want to make sure you don’t forget!
 Kyra Davis | January 19, 2011 at 12:40 pm | 
I get up before everyone else. I shower&amp;dress so I am ready for my day. I sit down with a cup of coffee and sit in the quiet while I drink my cup of coffee. After that I wake up the kids, and that’s when the day begins as a family. Before that it’s my time to relax, meditate, and become calm and at inner peace so that I can focus on my children for the rest of the morning. Once the older one goes off to school, the younger one and are then ready to do what is on our agenda for the day&amp;I haven’t been frazzled by the morning!
 Melisa Smith | January 19, 2011 at 12:40 pm | 
Mornings can generally be a bit stressful in our house with two boys–one in 1st grade and one in 2nd grade. I have found the best thing to reduce morning stress is a Routine. The boys know what needs to be done so they can get to school in time. They are generally real good about following a routine.
 Christina P. | January 19, 2011 at 12:41 pm | 
I am a stay at home mom of 4 but they are in school so I lay everything out from backpacks to outfits, shoes, hair bows for the girls. Lunches are all packed and/or set out in the fridge ready to put in their lunch boxes. Vitamins and med bottles are set out on the counter ready to be taken. We look at the breakfast menu for school and if it’s something they won’t eat we get breakfast stuff layed out. I don’t take care of getting me dressed or anything else until all kids are ready and out the door. I also get up 20 min earlier than I should in case someone has a bad morning and needs a little extra time getting ready (because let’s face it, we all have bad days)!! The most important thing I do is make sure the kids have coats and backpacks on, kisses and hugs given and at the door waiting 5 min before the bus comes just in case they show up early!!

I “like” All You Mag on facebook.
I prepare what I can the night before. I have a few tricks that keep me on track and not stressed out. I prepare and set the coffeemaker timer before I go to sleep so when my alarm clock goes off I smell the coffee brewing and I do not hit the snooze button, I jump right out of bed! I have fresh fruit for breakfast so that is a easy fix. I put have my purse, keys in the same place everyday I check and make sure they are there before I go to sleep (nothing like the frantic rush of looking for lost keys to stress you out.) I select my work clothes the night before and hang them on my bathroom door (over the door hook are great for this). I set my alarm early to allow for traffic delays&amp;get to work usually 15-20 minutes early everyday. (Extra cup of coffee and a few minutes to relax before work are nice)
I take my lunch to work 4 days a week. preparing lunch the night before makes sure I have a healthy lunch and a stress-free morning.
 Sherilyn | January 19, 2011 at 12:41 pm | 
Like most everyone else, I also try to do as much as I can the night before (easy breakfast choices, clothes picked out, bookbags and school supplies packed and ready to grab). It also helps to have a hubby who is a morning person who helps get things going since my best time is definitely not in the am hours! And for those busy mornings, coffee is always the beverage of choice 
 JANE WYATT-SCOTT | January 19, 2011 at 12:41 pm | 
The key to a smooth start to my day is preparation…Before I go to bed I make sure all the toys are picked up, dishes are done, baths are taken, hubby’s lunch is packed, and breakfast is prepped. I have Celiac Disease, which means my breakfast has to be gluten free. While, I often just have eggs or bacon, sometimes I crave something different. I always mix all the dry ingredients for my breakfast (protein pancakes or flax toast) and my hot beverage (protein cocoa cappuccino) the night before. After my daughter and I finish breakfast, I hop on the treadmill and log an hour of walking/jogging, which helps energize me for the busy day ahead!!
 Bethany | January 19, 2011 at 12:41 pm | 
My time saving tip isn’t all that creative but I get up an hour early to get myself ready and everything organized before I get the boys up—I have GOT to shower and get my caffeine before i even speak to anyone
 ame glasgow | January 19, 2011 at 12:41 pm | 
i dont have one of these but would love one…our current coffee maker has a mind of its own.we set our timer to make coffee in the morning so that it does not take to much of our morning routine time,but some times i guess its not in the mood to make it for us as it just ignores the timer and does not make coffee.so some times we just dont get coffee in the mornings.those are the days we know we are going to drag all day,sigh.i would really love to have some thing reliable…
 Kathy | January 19, 2011 at 12:41 pm | 
Already like allyou on FB. =) Always have clothes ironed and ready the night before. Lunches made. Everything ready to go by the door–bags, coats, shoes, etc.. I even have prep work for breakfast ready. With 3 children age 5 and under every second saved is soooo worth it.
 Janice | January 19, 2011 at 12:41 pm | 
We get up and get going right away. Coffee first, feeding cats 2nd&amp;right to work. We work at home, so we don’t have to go far! We check business emails and messages and focus on our ebay and website store orders. Once we get those printed, we can take a break&amp;have breakfast&amp;check the paper&amp;the news. It’s all teamwork here. No one gets stuck doing everything. That’s the key for us. Actually, we call ourselves 1582-The Team! It’s our house #&amp;a take off on a local sports radio show.
 Kim | January 19, 2011 at 12:42 pm | 
I don’t have a coffee maker so, I have to wait until I get to work for my coffee. To get to work faster so that I can get my coffee, I prepare everything at night. I also do showers at night to save on time in the morning. I have a special needs child so, things are a little slower at my house. I make lunches and fill her backpack at night as well and put a note on my purse to remember to bring them. I set my alarm clock 15 minutes fast so that I have a few extra minutes that I didn’t think I had. I make sure to have quick and healthy breakfasts on hand. Best of all, I take my daughter and drop her off at school and get my kiss and hug and I am off to enjoy a great day!
 Tiffany Gnisci | January 19, 2011 at 12:42 pm | 
My biggest time savers in the morning are setting up the coffee the night before so it’s ready when I get up. (A Keurig would make it even easier in the a.m. though, hint, hint); and having my kids get dressed for school as soon as they get up while I’m making their breakfast has saved us a lot of time in the morning. I used to let them eat first and then get dressed and we were always rushing. This routine makes life a lot less stressful in the morning.
 RAMONA ODOM | January 19, 2011 at 12:42 pm | 
I was a stay-at-home mom while my children grew up. Now that I am a grandmother, I have a career. It has been hard to get use to but I find that preparing the night before makes it so much easier. My Keurig is a real time saver. I have my husband’s and my travel cups ready with our favorite additions and can get them ready in time for us to grab as we go out the door. Makes for a very calm exit each morning.
 joanie torre | January 19, 2011 at 12:42 pm | 
I have 8 animals and 1 husband to feed in the morning. All food is prepared the night before and ready to be dispensed as soon as the alarm goes off. I am the last to eat but the smell of coffee brewing is my incentive to get done quickly.
 Jenny | January 19, 2011 at 12:42 pm | 
With four children to get off to school in the morning, my mornings can be very hectic. We have a time schedule that we have to stick to, especially for the shower!. My children have all been packing their own lunches since kindergarten so, now that they are older, they are all capable of making their own breakfast as well. That really helps me, as I have to get my and my husband’s lunches ready to take to work. I have found that timing is everything and if you can stick to your schedule, everything else will fall into place. When the unexpected arises, you just add it in and go with the flow! Thanks for the opportunity to win a coffee machine as this is part of my morning (6:35 a.m. Make Coffee!!!! Most important part of my morning. My workout is already done so I deserve a treat!)
 Margaret Aubin | January 19, 2011 at 12:42 pm | 
My biggest time saver is my husband. He gets up with our oldest son and makes them both breakfast. I get up and finish getting N ready for school while T gets ready for work.
 Cynthia S | January 19, 2011 at 12:42 pm | 
To keep the stress out the mornings, we do as much as we can do the night before, packing lunches, clothes are laid out, backpacks are double checked and packed. Being the Mom, I’m the last to go to bed but the first to get up. I go to bed right after the children so that I am able to get up earlier to have my cup of coffee and my own quiet time, then depending on what time who has to be out the door, we wake up in 15 min intervals so that everyone is not needing to use the bathroom at the same time, while this one is in the bathroom the other one is in their room getting dressed. We like to start our day peacefully without stress and this seems to be working the best for us.
 Debi | January 19, 2011 at 12:42 pm | 
I prepare everything the night before so all I have to do it get up in the morning and switch things on.
 Nicole Brusich | January 19, 2011 at 12:43 pm | 
When I grocery shop on Sundays I come home and pre-package everything out into baggies. Chips, nuts, veggies, vitamins and anything else that goes into the process of making lunches in the morning. By doing that all I have to do before leaving the house is grab what I want that day, toss it in a bag and go! This also helps out BIG time in portion control. It’s January! Who isnt dieting right now LOL!?
 Jacqueline Dunn | January 19, 2011 at 12:43 pm | 
My morning schedule is much less hectic since I started using a Keurig single cup coffee maker. I don’t have to set up the timer on the 12-cup coffee maker the night before or rush to start it in the morning if I forget. The ease of use, fast efficient brewing, and wide variety of flavors to choose from make this system the best way I can think of to make my morning more efficient. I used to be running late every day, usually waiting on the coffee maker, but since I started using the Keurig single-cup brewer, I haven’t been late once!!
 zevah steres | January 19, 2011 at 12:43 pm | 
me and my kids start the night before getting everything prepared that we are going to need the next day, it saves us time in the morning because we are human and Early mornings are very hard (we don’t like to get up at 6:30 but we have to) so everything goes smoothly we do everything the night before this saves the kids from stress they really don’t need at their young age and i have to have my a.m. coffee i love coffee!!

I have RA and fibromyalgia and I often wake up with aches and pains. I appreciate that the coffee can be made the night before and will be ready for me when I get up. I haven’t ever used the Keurig but I’ve heard so much about it, I know I would love it.
 Nicole | January 19, 2011 at 12:43 pm | 
Having 2 school aged daughters I need all the extra time I can get; and to get some I iron all of their school clothes on Sunday for the entire school week. I also have their shoes ready with the socks they are going to wear inside of them. I prepare their lunches at night; have the girls gather the items they will need for school, put them in their book bags and sit the book bags by the front door. Last but not least, I save time by brushing my teeth while I’m in the shower! Surprisingly this saves 3 to 5 minutes!!
 Shelby | January 19, 2011 at 12:43 pm | 
I am home with my kids 4days out of the week, so most mornings are a breeze for me. The three days I have to work, I just get everything all packed up and ready to go the night before. Diaper bags and the other half of the house go in my car, clothes to wear are laid out, shoes are found and breakfast is prepped and ready to go! Then, when I wake up in the am, I take my shower while breakfast is cooking (usually a bake of some sort), I get the kids up to eat, while I am finishing getting ready, then once they are done, it’s teeth, hair, clothes, shoes and we are out the door!
 Jennifer Franks | January 19, 2011 at 12:43 pm | 
a kuerig would really make my mornings easier this one want coffee that one wants hot choclate and the other wants tea what a time saver this would be
 Robin | January 19, 2011 at 12:44 pm | 
The most efficient way that our family saves time in the morning is ROUTINE! We start the night before by makeing sure we have our showers and picking out our clothes and getting to bed on time so when morning comes we are ready to start our day my 3 boys are 8,8,&amp;6 and they always beat me out of bed but they know there routine. its eat breakfast, brush teeth, get dressed, then we have a chore chart that they look at and they need to do all the chore’s(that apply for morning) that are listed on there name for that day. When finished they have free time. This makes my mornings smooth and theirs to.
 nikki gower | January 19, 2011 at 12:44 pm | 
We get as much ready as we can the night before. Lay out everyone’s clothes, pack lunches, we have a‘launch pad’by the front door where all our bags and purses are packed and ready to go. I also have the kids keep a pair of boots and snow pants at school so we don’t have to juggle getting those together in the mornings. The best things I feel we do is make sure the house is neat and clean before we go to bed. It’s a lot easier to wake up knowing I am coming downstairs to a clean house.
 Jennifer E | January 19, 2011 at 12:44 pm | 
I do as much as I can the night before. I make a smoothie for my breakfast and fill my lunchbox. Then I set out my clothes and put everything I need for work on a hook next to the door. That way I wont forget anything!

I like to set my clock 20 minutes fast, so when I wake up I think it’s 20 minutes later than it really is. That early in the morning, half groggy, I never remember that I’m tricking myself. When I get in the car (with one shoe half on, my purse half open and the contents spilling out, and one eye of mascara on) and see that I’m actually running on time, I get so excited!!
I’m sure there’s a more organized way to have my mornings run more smoothly, but there’s never a lack of excitement! 
 Sarah Ulfers | January 19, 2011 at 12:44 pm | 
Since I’m not very mobile in the mornings, my success is in the preparations I make the night before. I.E. getting cloths, boots,and Backpacks.
 bonnie w. | January 19, 2011 at 12:44 pm | 
i like to wake up late on purpose. it makes me get off my butt and get stuff done. if i prepare the night before and wake up on time…i end up wasting time enjoying the news, breakfast, and facebook. when i’m late there’s no time to procrastinate!
 Bernadette Sabia | January 19, 2011 at 12:44 pm | 
TO help my morning go easier the night before i put the coffee pot together so once i get up i just hit on.. as the automatic timer to turn it on broke. I also prepackage lunch snacks and put them in bag for each day
 Abbe | January 19, 2011 at 12:44 pm | 
Do as much as you can the night before to make the morning easier. If there’s something that you must do in the morning, leave yourself a note where you’re bound to see it (bathroom mirror, above the coffeemaker or next to your keys).

 Julie Mikek | January 19, 2011 at 12:45 pm | 
My new husband and I drink different types of coffee. I like it strong with flavor and he likes it much weaker and just regular coffee…. A Keurig would be an awesome wedding gift to us for us We would enjoy it every day and think of All YOU and Keurig with every cup&lt;3
 Mary L. | January 19, 2011 at 12:45 pm | 
Get as much done in the evening as possible, so there isn’t so much to do in the mornings. And definitely COFFEE, COFFEE, COFFEE!!
 Valerie | January 19, 2011 at 12:45 pm | 
Always have everything ready the night before. This deletes much of the usual morning stress. So clothes are set out, lunches are made, breakfast items are prepared, coffee pot is ready to brew with the flip of the switch. Nice calm morning, no rushing around.

 Alexandria Adams | January 19, 2011 at 12:45 pm | 
I try to get all of my things ready the night before so that I can spend less time in the morning struggling to find things while I’m groggy. This includes picking out outfits, preparing lunches and breakfast (I bring mine to work and eat it there). I know that I have a difficult time waking up, so the less confusion that I have in the morning, the better.
 Paula Bankester | January 19, 2011 at 12:45 pm | 
I get a head start with our rice maker the nite before with either stoneground grits or rollcut oatmeal set for 6 am. When I wake up let the dog out on way to coffee maker, make lunch while she’s out then back up to bedroom with my coffee which can cool just enough while I’m in the shower, then back down for a nice hot breakfast and a little facebook time. Good Coffee, Good Breakfast and Good time starts me off for a good day in no time.
 kristen miller | January 19, 2011 at 12:46 pm | 
take a shower the night before with your outfit of choice laid out, so in the morning all you have to do is wash your face, throw on some mascara and blush, and your outfit is already there for you. comb the hair and Grab a breakfast bar out of the pantry and you can be out the door in 15 mins! works wonders for those of us who like to sleep every minute we can!
 Joy | January 19, 2011 at 12:46 pm | 
I do as much as possible, clothes, setting up breakfast (including coffee) lunches, etc the night before. In some cases I try to do a few days at a time.
 Jenni | January 19, 2011 at 12:46 pm | 
Laying out our clothes the night before and packing everything in the lunchboxes except for the cold stuff really saves me time in the mornings!
 Lisa Rounds | January 19, 2011 at 12:46 pm | 
My successful morning requires preparing the night before. I hate getting up earlier than needed so I get everything ready the evening before. The kids backpacks, lunch, and clothes ready. AND most importantly the coffee maker ready to just push“START”!
 Becky | January 19, 2011 at 12:47 pm | 
When I had children at home to get off to school Sunday was my day. I would plan my weekly meals, get groceries. I did all the laundry and put clothes together for the week. So in the morning if I was short on time at least I had those things out of the way. #1 tip would be to have organization and make it routine.
 Lisha | January 19, 2011 at 12:47 pm | 
Preplan as much as possible and Prepare as much in advance as possible and make the morning routine then everyone knows what to expect.

Make batches of pancakes and/or scrambled eggs (or other breakfast favorites) in advance for the week so that you just throw them in the microwave and serve. Have vitamins, clothes, backpacks etc. arranged and ready to go so that there’s no need to have a search party on the way out the door. Make it a regular assembly line.
 Penny | January 19, 2011 at 12:47 pm | 
There is a schedule posted for my 3 children of things that need completed every night like showers, homework, things put away, items out for the morning including clothes laid out and lunches packed and bedtime. We motivate them by giving them an allowance however they need to make sure all the above is completed or they get money taken out of their allowance jar. By working together as a family the night before mornings aren’t hectic and I can sit and enjoy my coffee and breakfast without rushing.

My kids and I clear out school bags the minute I get home from owrk and we get all of the homework done and sign the assignments to be placed back into the bags before dinner. This, plus laying out our clothes and making school lunches after dinner dishes are done give us time in the morning to eat without rushing and starting the morning out with a giggle, smile or just a general feeling of success.
 Ami Baker | January 19, 2011 at 12:47 pm | 
AVOID GETTING ONLINE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. Wait until lunchtime. A peek at my email led to a read of my favorite blogs, a facebook reply (or 5), then a twitter post (or 2),&amp;before I knew it a half hour of precious morning minutes were wasted away.
 Julie Mikek | January 19, 2011 at 12:48 pm | 
My quick tip would be to get all kids’clothes out the night before. Making the coffee and programming the maker for the morning would give a few extra minutes to spend with the kids before all of have to be out the door at the same time. I also like the idea tha the kids can make hot chocolate with the Keurig so that the whole family can enjoy it!!!
 Patty Farnsley | January 19, 2011 at 12:48 pm | 
Mornings come early in our house. (4:30) so being efficient and organized is a must! I know my brain does not function at its best at that time! So prepping for the next day always starts the day before. First thing I do is have the coffee pot ready to start brewing for the next morning. This is especially important if something has been been forgotten from the night before! lol. I do this right after dinner. We make sure all the mess is cleaned up, dishes done, clutter put away, floor swept. Then I get lunch stuff laid out. I freeze lunches ahead so that saves so much time and money. I bag it up and put it in the fridge. Car keys, cell phone, everything needed is put in one place on the table. Makes for a stress free morning. We are not big breakfast eaters but I keep cereals, bars and fresh fruit and juices on hand.
Lists are a wonderful thing !!!
 kerri | January 19, 2011 at 12:48 pm | 
I have 2 year old twins who are starving when they get up so I have things already laid out for them to eat when we get up and milk cups filled in the fridge so they don’t have to wait long and I even have diapers and wipes ready to change them as soon as we get down that way everything is in one spot.

It’s not very creative but I do as much as possible the night before. Lay out outfits, pack lunches, have backpacks waiting by the door ready to go. I also plan out our meals two weeks in advance and have a dinner calendar that has all of our meals listed out so in the mornings, all I do is see what we’ve got planned for dinner and lay out the appropriate meat/ingredients. No thinking involved 
 Tracy Tallan | January 19, 2011 at 12:49 pm | 
We have a routine the boys have adapted to the past couple of years. My boys are 1st and 2nd grade now and still want me to pick out their clothes. But while they get dressed I get their breakfast ready. While they eat we talk about their day coming up and I make their lunch. I usually don’t get to make my coffee until after they are off to school. But hitting the gym in the mornings, I must have my coffee before class! Staying physically strong and healthy makes me a better wife and mom. And the caffeine keeps me happy and awake! 
Best of luck to all the great women out there!
 kim | January 19, 2011 at 12:49 pm | 
With three kids, it is not always easy getting everyone together, especially when I hate mornings and can never seem to get anywhere on time. I try to do everything at night so that we are ready to go first thing, especially if the alarm doesn’t go off. Ooops!

 April Taylor | January 19, 2011 at 12:49 pm | 
I save time every morning by getting up 1st. I have 45 mins before the rest of the family is moving to shower and enjoy my coffee. I do not have a timer on my coffee pot so I start it and then jump in the shower. By the time I am out it’s fresh&amp;hot. I don’t especially like to get up early but it sure helps with the grumpys if we as a family are getting ready in stages and not all fighting for the bathroom.
 Sherelle Dunham | January 19, 2011 at 12:49 pm | 
My fiance’leaves before myself, so to help with the kiddos, he makes our daughter’s lunch for school, and gets our son’s baby food and bottles ready. Also, he makes sure the animals are fed and lets them go outside to use the bathroom. When it’s my turn to wake-up and get moving, our six-year old daughter has a checklist of what to do, which keeps her motivated and on task to get herself ready. I make sure to put breakfast items in an area she can reach. I put on a pot of coffee to refrain from crawling back into bed. All of the items needed for the day (backpack, purse, and diaper bag) are loaded in the car before the morning. Additionally, we all pick-out our clothes for the next day the evening before.

having infant twins and a 4 year old–time is very limited in the mornings–so my way of preparing is get everything packed and done the night before, putting diaper bag in the car that way I won’t forget it when I am rushing out the door 
 Lisa Koch | January 19, 2011 at 12:50 pm | 
prepare you coffee the night before and set a self-timer, so you can have that first cup of coffee as soon as you get out of bed!!!
 Dusti Miller | January 19, 2011 at 12:50 pm | 
I think the most important thing in the morning is to stick to a routine. If you do things in the same order everyday they become habit. Obviously, preparing things the night before and setting the timer on the coffee maker are big helpers but I am a firm believer in routine. If I oversleep or do something out of order, it affects the start to everyone else’s day.
 Georgia Sawhook | January 19, 2011 at 12:50 pm | 
Morning is not my best time. I love the fact that I can set my coffee to wake me up with the grinding of the beans and the aroma of the coffee. The best of course are the new Folger/Millstone coffees. My favorite being Vanilla Biscotti. YUM! With the 7 kids all grown and gone, the quiet coffee time is my favorite. Never was able to enjoy it for years. So bring on the Keurig, cuz I really want to make retirement a WHOLE lot easier!!
 Lora Reynolds | January 19, 2011 at 12:50 pm | 
I like you on Facebook!

The night before, I lay out my gym clothes in the bathroom so I do not wake my husband in the morning.

My alarm goes off at 5:03 and I get out of bed at 5:06am. Yes, it is timed perfectly for most amount of sleep posssible. I go downstairs and set my coffee maker to go off 5 minutes before I come home from the gym.

6:45am home from the gym, read my devotional (me time) and drink my coffee. 7am my youngest wakes up and about 30 minutes later her brother wakes up. I have worked out, had my coffee, read my devotional and now ready to start my day with a positive attitude!

I would love a Keurig!
 Deena Mayhew | January 19, 2011 at 12:50 pm | 
Since I’m not a“morning person”, successfully meeting a morning schedule needs to be thought through the night before, because leaving the“details”until morning will only spell disaster! I make sure that I have decided what I will wear, what I need to bring, and I back-calculate what time I need to leave to make it to my destination on time. (ie, also known as a calculation of how long I can sleep in!) If I allocate the time to this thought process the night before, things go smoothly–if not, it’s a morning scramble! Since I have a slow-perking coffee maker, the chance of my getting my much-needed morning tranfusion of a coffee-fix is totally in jeopardy under“scramble”mode. I have often thought that a Kerig coffee maker would sure be a time saver in“scramble mode”, and if I’m not in“scramble mode”, the time saved could equate to a few more minutes of blissful sleep! The more I think about it, I sure hope you pick me! This is one kitchen gadget that will totally enrich my life–no matter what kind of a morning I’m having! :0) Thanks for the opportunity to win one!
 Amber B | January 19, 2011 at 12:50 pm | 
I fix my hair in the car. My hair-do is nothing more than a ponytail with some hairspray to keep the fly-aways down. Using my folding brush, I pull my hair back at one stop light and spray it with hairspray at another. Very efficient.

I also brush my teeth in the shower. It’s a two-fold time saver: 1. I’m using water already, and 2. It saves me from having to change or clean my shirt because I just spit toothpaste on it…which I’m prone to do.
 Kim | January 19, 2011 at 12:51 pm | 
I like to prepare breakfast items that can be frozen or reheat well on the weekend. For example, breakfast taquitos, mini quiche, things like that. In the morning you just pop them in the microwave and you have a great breakfast in less than a minute.
 Dawn Ashby | January 19, 2011 at 12:51 pm | 
My mornings are blessed because my husband and I split the duties. He gets up early 5:30 to be exact with our oldest daughter who catches the bus at 6:36. She is a pre-teen and her clothes are her clothes (any parent of a teen understands this). I wake up at 6:15′ish to approve of her attire The younger daughter gets up around 7:30 for breakfast and her attire is picked and laid out while she eats breakfast. In the meantime, coffee has been made, 2 cups or so has been drunk and husband is at work. Teamwork is the key!!!
 M.J. Streu | January 19, 2011 at 12:51 pm | 
We save time in the morning by getting the kiddos bathed the night before and having them pick out their clothes then too. Mornings we just have to get up, get dressed, brush our teeth and hair, and they’re ready in time for the bus! It’s also helpful for Mommy if there’s a programmable coffee maker with fresh hot coffee ready and waiting so she can wake up quickly too!!! 
 Cathy Hemmelstein | January 19, 2011 at 12:51 pm | 
I own my own business so routine is the answer. First&amp;foremost coffee, than dog, shower, news and out the door. With routine this can be done in 30 minutes
 Robin H | January 19, 2011 at 12:52 pm | 
Planning—plan the night before as to what will be for breakfast, what will be taken for lunch (usually leftovers from the night before), and what will be for dinner (and prep those ingredients ahead of time). Setting the coffeemaker to automatically brew the coffee in the morning is crucial.
 Cindy1953 | January 19, 2011 at 12:52 pm | 
I make sure my yard sale Keurig is full of filtered water the night before and that my coffee basket filter is clean with my coffee grinder next to it filled with my favorite coffee beans. I have my cereal on the kitchen table with my bowl and spoon. So in the morning I can Grind my beans, Turn on the Keurig, Make my coffee, Fix my cereal and RELAX!
 carol | January 19, 2011 at 12:52 pm | 
I try to have the dishwasher run the night before, get stuff that is needed for the morning ready to go, including laundry.
 Anna McMullen | January 19, 2011 at 12:52 pm | 
Ha HA I trick myself every morning in saving time. When I set my clock I will set it for 6:30 a.m. each morning but the difference is when I set the correct time of the clock, I get it to the actual time and then hold the button down and let it set ahead for several minutes. I turn my head and don’t watch the time to where I have no idea how far in advance it is set. 5 minutes, 10 minutes or one time 25 minutes ahead. This gives me extra cushion time in the mornings. When I figure out how far it is set in advance, I do it over again.
My other time saving tip is get in the shower, wash, and get out. Don’t just stand there. Tell yourself you have to get in and get the job done and get out. I take 7-10 minute showers, my husband takes 25 minute showers. A lot of wasted time!
Thanks! Hope I win!
 Jennifer | January 19, 2011 at 12:52 pm | 
I have a 5 year old who is very picky about what she wears. I have found that allowing her to pick her clothes out for the entire week makes each morning so much easier. We also have her back pack on the door with her coat ready to go. This way we can grab and go and be out the door. Breakfast is usually pre-made french toast or pancakes that are frozen in single serving bags in the freezer. Pop it in the microwave and breakfast is ready in 45 seconds. Life is grand!
 Jennifer Hanson | January 19, 2011 at 12:52 pm | 
I agree with everyone else who says lay out the clothes the night before, etc. I set my child’s clothes out, get her homework/backpack ready and set out and prepare the items for her lunch so that mornings aren’t quite so hectic. It doesn’t eliminate the child who doesn’t want to get going in the morning though…if I could find a solution for that then I would be set. ; )
 Ann | January 19, 2011 at 12:53 pm | 
My suggestion for morning routines running smoothly–set the alarm clock 15 minutes earlier and GET UP when it goes off. Be sure to place it across the room so you will have to get up to turn it off. After a few mornings, it will come naturally.
 Jennifer Nicassio | January 19, 2011 at 12:53 pm | 
Just like everyone’s post on here, of course doing all that can be done the night before is important, we put everything in the car like jackets, gloves, hats and shoes so those aren’t forgotten. But I also try to plan for the unexpected by waking just 15 minutes earlier than everyone else to make sure I am awake and ready to think about what needs to happen that morning and day. What is nice is when everything is done and everyone is ready and we have 10-15 extra minutes to sit and spend time with each other.
 Sherry Locklear | January 19, 2011 at 12:53 pm | 
I have one of these in my office&amp;I LOVE IT!!!! It is so easy&amp;fast, I am a big coffee drinker and my husband is too, since he is an police officer and it would be much eaiser for him since he is on the go!!!
 Stephanie | January 19, 2011 at 12:53 pm | 
I’m already a“like”of AllYou on FB!

The night before, I have my breakfast already planned out. I already have my“walking the dogs in the cold”sweat clothes already beside the bed. I roll out of the bed in the morning, throw on the sweat pants and immediately walk the dogs before I do anything else. This wakes me up more than coffee!

The only tip I really have is learn how to be a multitasker. I will have coffee maker already running straight into a to-go tumbler, have the straightening iron heating up and brushing my teeth at the same time. I find that if I don’t turn on the TV or radio in the morning, I get things done a lot quicker. If i have the TV on, I slow down so I can listen to what is going on, and sometimes run to the TV to see what they are talking about. So no more TV in the morning.
 Jennifer Franks | January 19, 2011 at 12:54 pm | 
The easiest way to get throught the mornings is to teach your children to be self sufficient. they each have an alarm and they get up and get ready on their own while I get ready. then they can choose to fix their own breakfast or have me fix them something its give and take and makes for nice mornings. of course my kids are 11 and 15 but they have been doing this since they started school.
 Shelly Potter | January 19, 2011 at 12:54 pm | 
Already like you all!

My timesaving tip: I have four kids and we are always about 20 minutes to get out the door! ages 11-2.. yes, all the way down! Here’s how we do it: Buddy system! My 11 year old helps out the 4 year old, my 7 year old helps out the 1 year old. Diaper bag is ALWAYS packed and by the front door, the keys are always hanging up, and shoes are always lined up by the door! Stay organized and you will always be 20 minutes out the door!
 Krista | January 19, 2011 at 12:55 pm | 
One of the things I do in the morning to save time and keep track of time is use the timer on my microwave to keep the kids on task. It also saves me from nagging too much.I set it for a certain amount of time when they sit down to eat and when the timer goes off they know they need to move onto the next thing. I send one into the bathroom, while the other one gets dressed in their room. And then they switch. I set the timer for how long they can be in the bathroom and then I set the timer to go off 5 minutes before we are supposed to leave so I can get the kids to school on time.
 Heather W | January 19, 2011 at 12:56 pm | 
By establishing a getting-out-the-door routine, mornings can become less stressful. Children can sometimes cause progress to slow down the closer it gets to departure time. Make a leaving-the-house checklist and give children age-appropriate tasks from this list, regardless of whether they are going as well or if it’s just an adult on the trip. Let the family know what time you need to walk out the door. About fifteen minutes before this, have the troops swing into action, using the checklist as a guide. In the mornings, older children can warm up the car and make sure pets are put out for the day. Pre-teens can double check that small kitchen appliances and AC/heating units are turned off. Youngsters can fetch umbrellas and purses. This leaves mom free to focus on last-minute tasks of her own and teaches children responsibility for themselves and the family as a whole.
 Jerry Willis | January 19, 2011 at 12:56 pm | 
Get the coffee pot ready the night before; set timer. Before going to bed, get clothes out and ready; shave and settle in for a night’s rest. My daughter and her family have a Keurig and I am so envious. They LOVE IT!
 lela middour | January 19, 2011 at 12:56 pm | 
I already like All You on facebook. My tip to make mornings easier is to ask for help if you’re married. Quite often my husband handles our morning routines because I am not a morning person. We also keep juice boxes&amp;cereal bars&amp;fresh fruit on hand so the kids can have a snack before eating breakfast at school. Plus showers are done the night before giving us one less thing to do in the mornings!
 Shelly | January 19, 2011 at 12:56 pm | 
Have everything ready to go the night before. This includes laying out clothes and having anything you need to take with you set in a certain spot so you can just grab and go 
 wendy | January 19, 2011 at 12:57 pm | 
I prepare brown rice and chicken breasts on Sunday, portion into reusable containers and keep in refrigerator for healthy lunches. I opted for a simple, no fuss hair style years ago, wet, apply product, go. My make up routine has become fast and simple with the advent of mineral make up, and of course brushing your teeth in the shower. All saves a few minutes and gives me time to sit, relax and have a cup of coffee.
 Jenny | January 19, 2011 at 12:58 pm | 
My best time-saving tip is to teach your child independence. My 8 year old CHOOSES to prepare his own breakfast, whether it be cereal, a toaster pastry, or a cereal bar. All it takes is a few minutes to show him how to do something and then he an do it on his own in no time.

This can, however, backfire when your child decides to make a grilled cheese sandwich in the toaster.
 Tanya Hall | January 19, 2011 at 12:58 pm | 
While I would like to say prepare the night before, that does not always happen. So for a successful morning I say“ALWAYS”have a back up plan. Those quick grab and go breakfast and lunches for yourself and the kids. The easiest way make this happen is to separate the food right when you get home from the grocery. Grapes already in individual baggies, turkey rolled in a baggie for last minute grabs, ect. With a diabetic daughter I always have to have back up plans and quick grabs, makes my morning so much smoother.
 shirley delp | January 19, 2011 at 12:58 pm | 
I try to organize everything the night before.
 Lori Gulliford | January 19, 2011 at 12:58 pm | 
I always get everything I can organized the night before. I have refillable bottles I use for my husbands lunch , do I prefill them and put all foods together that have to go in his lunchbox so I just have to grab and put them in. Any snacks for the day are in baggies so grab and in they go go!!
The dog food is in a resealable container , so I pop off the lid, and they can eat and lid goes back on when done.
As for me I have snacks, coffee anad even tea alreaady stored at work , so I don’t have to worry about me too much in the morning.
 RebeccaMcD | January 19, 2011 at 12:58 pm | 
I am very blessed because I home school my two first graders so mornings are usually a laid back affair.
BUT to make sure everything goes super smoothly when the kids wake, I get up with my husband and make him a French press cup of coffee (because it’s faster, smaller,&amp;quieter than a whole POT-we don’t have a Keurig single-cup maker!); I pick up anything left out from the night before; I check my e-mail and organize our school work for the day. Getting up before everyone else and planning the day is the key, for me, for having a smooth morning and day!
 Wendy R. | January 19, 2011 at 12:58 pm | 
On the weekends, I make a bunch of breakfast burritos and sausage biscuits so when we’re busy we can throw them in the george foreman to warm up while we’re fixing our morning cup of joe! Having clothes ready for the next day and lunches prepared the night before get us out the door in no time!
 TAMI F | January 19, 2011 at 12:58 pm |

 Sue Robbins | January 19, 2011 at 12:59 pm | 
I have fibromyalgia&amp;Lupus&amp;mornings are not always good for me, so I do as much as possible the night before. This includes making lunch, coffee, getting my clothes ready for the next day, and lastly, making sure my son and husband are all packed up and ready to go. My husband works two 24-hour shifts a week plus goes to school 4 nights a week, so I always try to have him stay in bed to get as much sleep as he can. Making lunch and taking showers at night also helps my son, who has ADHD, be better prepared to start his day. Mornings are still sometimes very difficult in our house, but being able to get out of the house with a small travel mug of French Vanilla or mocha coffee in the morning is the best way to start the day.

I’m not a morning person at all, but when I have to get up early I make sure I have most of the morning chores done the night before.
I also make sure our coffee pot is all ready to go. Filter in, coffee in, water in, timer set, coffee cups out, and creamer out for my husband.
It just makes things alot easier!
 Jessica Lodge | January 19, 2011 at 12:59 pm | 
I have a‘when it’s time to go that’s it’rule! If my eight year old has mis matched shoes then so be it! If he can’t find his gloves than that is what pockets are for. As a result he tends to get the things most important to him ready the night before. BTW I left the house with mis matched flip flops on one day, so the rule applies to all. As a result I am better at putting my shoes away so that I can find them in the morning now.
 Sara | January 19, 2011 at 1:00 pm | 
My husband and I tag team in the morning. He makes lunches and dresses one child, I make breakfast and dress the other. We have very strict eating times and if the children are not finished at that time, food is taken away. It has only happened once! I find that by keeping the morning routine the same, we have great success and happy mornings. Each day we celebrate a great morning and on our drive to day care and school we talk about how we are going to make each day wonderful. Being the only coffee drinker in the house, making an entire pot is not practical so I tend bypass my morning brew until I get to work. Would love to savor a cup before leaving home!
 Stephanie | January 19, 2011 at 1:00 pm | 
I prepare everything the night before. Everyone’s clothes are laid out. Breakfast is prepped and we are nearly ready as soon as we wake up.
 Sherry Quinn | January 19, 2011 at 1:00 pm | 
my best tip is, Get your husband to cook breakfast!!! would love to have the coffee pot!
 Melissa | January 19, 2011 at 1:00 pm | 
Clothes out the night before, book bags ready, lunches packed. Like to know what they want for breakfast the night before to have it ready when I get them up. Also coffee is programmed and set the night before so that it atomatically makes before my alarm goes off 
 Katrina Whitaker | January 19, 2011 at 1:00 pm | 
I have bought so many other coffee makers and just can’t make a perfect cup of coffee. So many of my friends have told me that Keurig makes the best and it is so easy to use, and you have so many wonderful flavors to choose from. I am all for easy and good tasting coffee. That would definitely save me morning time.
 Susie Huckabee | January 19, 2011 at 1:00 pm | 
I have one child in Kindergarten that catches the bus at 6:50 am; and an 18 month old; and my hubby has to be at work by 6:45am, so he can’t really help out in the morning. In addition to getting everything ready the night before(especially for the Kindergartner), I’ve found the biggest help for me is to take everything out to the car first–then come back in to lock up and do a last minute check. Then I’m just loaded down with the baby and my keys when we walk out the door.
 Deanna | January 19, 2011 at 1:01 pm | 
It might sound contradictory but I give myself 10 min of‘awake’time first thing in the morning. I have already set my coffee timer so coffee is already ready..I do five min of yoga to center myself and allow my whole body and mind to wake up. Then I get my coffee and check Facebook and emails for five min. When that is done I am awake and ready to start my day! Like I said it sounds contradictory but that ten min wakes me up and from there I am on full power!
 Lisa Niehaus | January 19, 2011 at 1:01 pm | 
I get my lunch ready the night before so I can take a healthy lunch to work and not have to rush in the morning. Also saves money by not going out to eat.
 Jane Johnson | January 19, 2011 at 1:02 pm | 
Best tip for moms with younger kids or for those dads who help out, but aren’t the best at picking out outfits:

Each week I made outfits for each day and put them in large clear baggies. I included everything needed for that outfit down to the socks&amp;hair bows. My daughter just looks in the drawer and pulls out the bag she wants and gets herself dressed.
 Geri | January 19, 2011 at 1:02 pm | 
This is a great tip for singles, couples and families with kids. Cook 3-4 meals the weekend including snacks and desserts. If you have children, they love to help! Eat one together. Pack the rest in to-go containers with snacks in zip bags. Planning and cooking meals during the week is one stress you don’t need in the morning. Grab and go!
 Kristin M | January 19, 2011 at 1:02 pm |

 Glenda Penny | January 19, 2011 at 1:03 pm | 
I make sure to make my breaksfast and lunch the night before so that I don’t have to rush in the morning.
 Darlene | January 19, 2011 at 1:03 pm | 
Team work! My husband sets out the medications for us the night before, along with his cereal bowl and things for morning. I make his lunch and set it on the top shelf of the fridge for him, so when he comes down at 4:30 the next morning, he can just grab his breakfast, his lunch and head out the door hassle free. He just has to remember not to put the orange juice on his oatmeal 
 Melissa Mathews | January 19, 2011 at 1:03 pm | 
To make my mornings more efficient, we lay out clothes, pack backpacks and organize lunches the night before. I also set the alarm with enough time for me to have a quiet cup of coffee before I get my son up. I get him up and dressed and give him enough time to eat breakfast and have some playtime before he leaves for school–makes for much more peaceful mornings. If there is an odd morning where I have extra things to do, I make sure I have a to-do list written so everything gets done.
 Rachel Carver | January 19, 2011 at 1:03 pm | 
I always pack lunches and have the kids uniforms ready the night before. I find that this helps them stay in a routine when they wake up, and it gives me a few minutes to relax. I also get the kids bookbags ready to go and keep them by the door along with their jackets!
 T.A.D. | January 19, 2011 at 1:03 pm | 
I set out everything the night before: I place clothes and shoes at the ready and in the kitchen, I have pre-measured items set to make quick and easy meals.

I shower at night, so when I wake up I can get dressed in a flash, head to the kitchen and make breakfast.

By being prepared ahead of time, I can generally get dressed and out the door within 10-15 minutes.
 Sharon | January 19, 2011 at 1:04 pm | 
My advice for saving time and sanity in the morning?
1. Keep breakfast simple. String cheese/portable squeeze yogurts, fruit, toast, etc. And eat it in the car on the way to school. Saves a ton of time in the morning.
2. Pack lunches night before or have kids buy lunch at school.
3. This may sound indulgent but I fill the bathtub for my son before I wake him and he happily stumbles out of bed and into a warm tub. Soon, he fully awake and clean. He just has to get dressed and get in the car where his breakfast is waiting.

Total time from dreamland to car: 30 mins. or less.
 Rebecca | January 19, 2011 at 1:04 pm | 
Clothes for my daughter and myself are laid out the night before. If it is a“gym day”(my daughter goes to a private school and wears uniforms) the gym uniform goes into the dryer so that it can be turned on and her clothes all warmed up for her to put on. (She hates getting up on school days and the prospect of warm clothes helps) I also have 5 of those cheap plastic magazine storage/holders and they are labeled Monday–Friday. We use these to keep homework, book orders, lunch money, and other school forms organized by what day we need. We also put an small items needed for after school activities in these as well, like dance shoes. Then in the morning, all we have to do is grab the stuff out of that day’s magazine container and we are out the door!
 Dara Indish | January 19, 2011 at 1:04 pm | 
I live in snow country so my best time saver and sanity saver is my remote start for my truck. I can enjoy my second cup of coffee on my way to work in a warm truck with clear windows. I often see people driving with just a small, clear space in their windshield and wonder how they can relax and enjoy the trip like that. Not to mention it’s very unsafe.
 Rachel Barr | January 19, 2011 at 1:04 pm | 
I received a waffle maker for Christmas and I have made quite a stack of them and froze them. Now all my kids have to do is pull one out, heat it up and“wallah”…a good breakfast!
 Denise | January 19, 2011 at 1:04 pm | 
I set the coffee maker on a timer so that the coffee is brewing while I get ready. I make my lunch the night before and pack everything for the next day at the same time. If I can, I even load some things in the car the night before. When getting my child ready, I give him a 10 minute warning before we need to get into the car, so he’s not rushing either.
 Lisa | January 19, 2011 at 1:05 pm | 
Easy morning routine:

On Sundays I prepare all lunches for the work week in single serving containers so I can just grab it and stick it in my bag. I always pick out my outfit the night before and hang it in the bathroom. The only thing that would make my morning go even quicker is not having to wait for the pot of coffee to brew! And I never can figure out the coffee grind/water ratio so my coffee never comes out good and I just end up spending tons of money at the coffee chains!
 Kristin M | January 19, 2011 at 1:05 pm | 
We have everything together the night before. Lunches are planned out and anything we need for sports is in the car. In the morning we just get dressed, eat and put any last minute things in the lunches. I even have a cloth bag I keep by the door where I put anything I need for my errands, like grocery list, coupons, library books to return, outgoing mail, signed notes for school etc. This way I have my act together and if we get behind I just grab the bag and go rather than searching for things at the last minute.
 Virgie Roth | January 19, 2011 at 1:06 pm | 
My daughter eats breakfast at school, but she likes to have“a snack”before we leave the house. I buy Annie’s bunny grahams and cheddar bunnies, and Hostess mini muffins. My daughter likes to be independent, so I put them in a bin in our pantry where she can“self serve”while I’m getting ready for work.
 Wendy | January 19, 2011 at 1:06 pm | 
I have 2 small children. I try to measure out my infant son’s formula and lay out his diaper and outfit for the next day. My toddler, I try to remember to lay out her outfit and get her drink and breakfast prepared, because I either wake up when my husband leaves for work or when my son wakes up. We have a coffeemaker, but it doesn’t have a timer on it or I just forget and think that I don’t have enough time. A Keurig would definitely help my morning and the rest of the day! =) Thanks
 Melissa | January 19, 2011 at 1:06 pm | 
my best creative tip for in the morning is to lay out all the clothes for the kids, set the coffee maker to go off for the hubby and I. get bowls, spoons, glasses out for the morning breakfast. all the kids have to do is pour the cereal and milk and get ready for school. Backpacks, boots and coats are kept by the door so everything is ready.
keys, walets, purse is also kept by the door. Having a new coffee maker would deffinatly help us with our morning as the kids could make their hot chocolate and us our coffee. It would be so nice to be able to have different things for beverages in the morning
 Merry@DefineFrugal.com | January 19, 2011 at 1:06 pm | 
Breakfast that includes a good cup of coffee is the most important meal of day. To save time, I buy Greek-style yogurt (usually honey vanilla) and add about 1/3 cup of high-fiber bran cereal, a few blueberries, banana slices or raspberries and a few walnuts or pecans. YUM!!

If I’m in a real hurry, I can toss the cereal, fruit and nuts in a ziploc bag. Grab a container of yogurt and take my breakfast (and coffee) with me. 
 Christina Fletcher | January 19, 2011 at 1:07 pm | 
I start my mornings by cuddling up next to my 7-year old daughter and gently tickling her until she is awake and giggling. I have found that starting our day laughing and having fun makes all the dull routine of getting dressed, making breakfast, and brushing teeth much easier on both of us and we both do it with smiles on our faces instead of stomping around half-asleep and grumpy. We still get everything we can ready the night before, but even if we’ve forgotten to do something, if you start your day off smiling it’s much easier to take it in stride!
 Karen | January 19, 2011 at 1:07 pm | 
Just Do It: Brew It . . . in a Keurig! I’m still using the same coffee maker ~ get this ~ given to me as a wedding gift 25 years ago! Keurig is all about simplicity, speed, and value. As a busy working mother of two and silver anniversary wife, it’s appropriate and timely for a Keurig coffee maker and Millstone K-cups to enter my home life! Coffee at work is simply the best with our Keurig B3000 . . . a new year . . . a new Keurig!
 Molly Becker | January 19, 2011 at 1:07 pm | 
In that each school year brings new time managemnet challenges, most have resulted in new solutions.

This year, freshman year of high school for my son, I’ve had to take a step back and allow him to take care of his morning routine without getting in the way. Now, of course, I have to double check with him that he has eaten (never would have thought a teen boy needs to be reminded to eat!) before he steps out the door, but the morning goes more smoothly if I lazily awaken as he takes his shower and don’t emerge from my room until the last 20 minutes of his preparation.

This less hectic approach to getting my son off to school affords me a more at ease/focused way to get myself ready for my day. It has been a win-win situation; both of us are less stressed which has, in turn, made each more efficient at getting our days off to a good start. It would be wonderful, since I now have time for a cup of coffee, to incorporate the Keurig to this nearly carefree mix!

 leslie | January 19, 2011 at 1:08 pm | 
I make the school lunches the night before so it is one less thing to think about in the morning.
 Heather Russell | January 19, 2011 at 1:08 pm | 
Hubby&amp;I tag-team to make it out the door each morning. He wakes the kids while I prepare breakfast. He gets them dressed&amp;ready while I make school lunches. He drives the Middle Schooler, I take the High Schoolers. We get out the door in ½ the time.
 Robin N | January 19, 2011 at 1:09 pm | 
The crock pot is your friend and it isnt just for dinner! There are so many wonderful breakfast dishes you can put in the night before and have ready for everyone to enjoy in the morning.

We also use the“launch pad”system in our house. Each child has a coat rack, a place for their back pack and their shoes. They take all of that off when they get home and put it away (no shoes worn in the house) so everything is right there when they need it and no scrambling to find that errant shoe while the bus is sitting outside. It is near their homework station so they finish their homework and put it into their packs so theyre ready to go. Also at the bus stop is a rack for gloves and hats, those go in right away too so none of them get lost.
Our morning starts at 5:45 when the oldest gets up and ready. The 3 kids are all on different schedules so we have busses that go at 6:30, 7:30, and 8:30. It makes for a very long morning but also makes bathroom time easier.
 jana gramaglia | January 19, 2011 at 1:09 pm | 
Set your alarm for 15 mins earlier at the least. It seems like something always comes up and slows you down in the morning and this way you won’t be running late.
 Haley B | January 19, 2011 at 1:09 pm | 
I made a special hanger that hangs on the back of my door. It has pockets for all my makeup,hair accessories, hair brushes etc.

The night before I make sure my hanging organizer is ready to go so I can grab everything easily and quickly.
 Alea Shinn | January 19, 2011 at 1:09 pm | 
Our mornings have a set time for everything to keep my 2nd grader moving–He wakes up at 7:30, has to be dressed by 7:45, has til 8:00 to finish breakfast, 8 is time for him to brush his teeth, and then get his gear on for school. He is more motivated to get things done with a time set for what he should be doing. We also get his backpack ready the night before so we don’t have to look for any homework, folders, etc in the morning.

 Paige J | January 19, 2011 at 1:10 pm | 
Going to bed at a decent hour the night before is a great way to start. That way you are well rested in the morning and can wake up on time. If you are well organized, also, this will make the morning routine run smoothly! Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed! Sending you off in a pleasant mood and with a great attitude!
 Angie | January 19, 2011 at 1:10 pm | 
The night before I get my one year olds bag ready to go with her clothes, diapers etc. We try to follow the same schedule every morning whether it is myself or my husband taking her into the sitter.
 Jessica Monroe | January 19, 2011 at 1:10 pm | 
I sit out my coffee making stuff the night before. Mug, coffee packet, spoon. But I make my coffee in the microwave because I don’t have a coffee pot. I’m the only won in the house that drinks coffee or hot drinks really. I would love one of these. Thank you so much for giving one away. Whoever gets it is definitely going to be a happy person, I know I would.
 Kathy | January 19, 2011 at 1:11 pm | 
I set up stations. For example, a coffee and tea station where everything is already ready for when I get up in the morning, a station where I keep all the toothpaste and deodorant so my husband can find them easier, and a station where I keep everything he needs for work so he doesn’t forget them when he leaves.
 Sandy | January 19, 2011 at 1:12 pm | 
I always have everything ready the night before!! Have the coffee timer on so all we have to do is eat breakfast and get around in the morning.
 sarah lynn | January 19, 2011 at 1:12 pm | 
we have three kids under three. our time saving tip is to have a routine and to stick to it. we do everything at the same time every morning, starting with breakfast at eight. if the kids get up early (before seven) or late (after seven), we still wait until eight o’clock to start our morning routine and continue that way until lunch at eleven. this way i’m not wandering around trying to figure out what needs to be done, and the kids can know what to expect and make the most of their time as well (i.e. they finish eating breakfast, get dressed and ready, and then get to play). the afternoon is much more relaxed, though!

my husband would LOVE a keurig–he is a coffee fanatic and always has the coffee brewing long before i get up.
 Heather Chandler | January 19, 2011 at 1:12 pm | 
I make oatmeal in the crockpot overnight. Bowls and spoons are already set up. My son picks out his oatmeal toppings the night before as well as his clothes. This gives him a sense of independence and speeds up our morning.
 Diane O | January 19, 2011 at 1:12 pm | 
The best way to start off my morning is hearing my daughter’s voice say“Mama!Mama!”. Once I am up it’s seeing the huge smile on my daughter’s face so excited to see me awake!
We do the typical toddler routine.. diaper change&amp;clothes changing first, then we start off our morning sharing a“mommy&amp;me”bowl of cereal. My daughter gets her toddler bowl&amp;I get my Adult sized.
She loves this part best. I think it helps us“connect”. Then we play and have fun! 
 Kristin | January 19, 2011 at 1:13 pm | 
There’s no substitute for laying things out the night before and post-it reminders on top of your keys.

 Barbara Seddon | January 19, 2011 at 1:14 pm | 
I am retired so early morning routine is more important than I ever thought it would be. If I don’t start my day right, I am a slug all day. So it’s up by 6:15. coffee and paper and then a 3 mile walk with a friend, either inside at the Mall when the weather’s bad or outside. It would be much too easy to poke along and/or give in to the aches and pains that come with age. When I get home, I’m ready for a busy productive day!
 Lisa | January 19, 2011 at 1:15 pm | 
To save time in the morning all week long is I make homemade pancakes and waffles on sunday and freeze them. In the morning all the kids have to do is pop in microwave and breakfast is served! i always keeps snacks and juice boxes/water in van for solving those last minute“im thirsty or im hungry still”as your running out the door. i always leave a second bag in van with wipes dipes toys tissues xtra clothes (in winter hat/gloves) i dont want to be going back home cause we forgot something. and of course i pile everything by the front door as i think of what we need in the morning. as a mother of 4 Keurig would be great. since kids love hot chocolate and ice tea, i love mocha and my husband loves flavored coffee. this would save so much more time to our morning routine 
 Lynette | January 19, 2011 at 1:15 pm |

 Kim T | January 19, 2011 at 1:15 pm | 
being ready the night before is a huge help–but humor helps get me and my 5 year old out the door on time. She is not a great morning person and every day she has school I swear she would sleep till noon so to get her moving I give her a few wake up please and if that does not work the mommy tickle and hug machine goes to work! On days that does not work I have been known to dress the sweet girl while she is half asleep. She is awake and then ready for teeth brushing, getting shoes on and getting out the door. She eats a granola bar and bannana on the way to school! I try to fit in a cup of coffee in there also so a Keurig coffee maker would be a God-send!
 janis bukstein | January 19, 2011 at 1:16 pm | 
if I start my coffee right before I start getting on my make up on I save the waiting time on my coffee to be ready. I also throw my food for breakfast in the microwave while getting dressed and than have time to sit and relax and have breakfast.
 Mary Zelli | January 19, 2011 at 1:17 pm | 
Set up coffee pot the night before. Prepare lunch at night while cleaning up from dinner. Don’t dawdle on the computer reading emails and the newspaper. That’s what always makes me late!!!
 Spring | January 19, 2011 at 1:18 pm | 
I pick out my outfits for the week and then my scrubs for my second job for the week. Dinners are made up to 4 days in advance. So if i am working my second job the kids can just heat up dinner and go. Coffee is up and running so all i have to do is grab the creamer and fill my cup. I brush my teeth in the shower so i can enjoy the hot water and the wake up. No blower dry no chemicals all natural in a ponytail and I am ready in under 30 mins. At work In 5.. Ok still half asleep.
 Becky Slayton | January 19, 2011 at 1:20 pm | 
I make sure my girls have all their school stuff gathered BEFORE they go to bed. so they dont call me with things they forgot.
 Lynette S. | January 19, 2011 at 1:20 pm | 
There are a few things I do:
1. Prepare the coffee pot right after diner the night before.
2. Set out clothes for The Kid before bed time.
3. Set out clothes for me.
4. Wake up about an hour earlier then I need to, so I can putz around and wake up without feeling rushed.
 Julie M. | January 19, 2011 at 1:21 pm | 
I have four wire baskets that I use to speed up the lunch-making process. One has sandwich bags, foil and snack bags. Second has snacks: Granola bars, individually portioned bags of grapes, crackers, bananas. Third has individually portions of chips and pretzels. The fourth basket I use for placing sandwiches. I make the sandwiches while the children eat breakfast. All they have to do is grab their bag, make a selection from the three food baskets and grab a juice box. Really saves time for us!
 Sheryl | January 19, 2011 at 1:22 pm | 
I am so not a morning person so at night I lay out my clothes–IN ORDER–around the living room. I start at one end stepping into the next piece in logical order. Looks pretty comical but at the end, I step into my shoes (by the door) pick up my pre-packed bag and I’m out the door!!
 Tina Watts | January 19, 2011 at 1:22 pm | 
I have a keurig and a carousel holding my coffee’s, teas and apple cider. My husband chooses his flavor and makes his coffee right before he walks out the door for work. My grown children use it to make their hot chocolate. I put 2 packets of instant oatmeal in a 16 oz cup and use my keurig to add the hot water to it. Then I make my hot tea. I have breakfast and a hot drink..all within a few minutes. The only thing I do is set out the oatmeal packets and my cups the night before.

 Kristi Prario (Sunshine) | January 19, 2011 at 1:24 pm | 
ALWAYS think ahead!;) I started drinking coffee five years ago while living in Houston, Texas (MD Anderson Cancer Center) ~ while I stood by my husbands side. ALWAYS wake up about 30 minutes prior to your children and enjoy a cup of coffee in a nice quiet house. Then wake those angels up and focus in on what means the most. Still enjoying coffee with my hubby by my side in the Sunshine State.&lt;3
 Carie | January 19, 2011 at 1:24 pm | 
I am a busy Mom that has to get kids up and out the door by 6:30am so I never get to have a cup of coffee until I get to work. Brewing a pot of coffee in the morning is pretty much out of the question-no time, takes too long to brew, and half of it gets wasted. If I had a Keurig I would be able to have my cup of coffee while I’m getting ready and be revved up and ready to go when I get to work. It helps that I have my clothes picked out and hanging up near the bathroom, the kids clothes and backpacks ready to go and wonderful children that work well with our routine. Coffee is a must for me and a Keurig makes that possible.
 Leasa Pratt | January 19, 2011 at 1:24 pm | 
I leave clothes out for my 8yr old son the night before. Then in the morning when it’s time for him to get up I send our dog, Ruby, (a boxer) in to wake him up so I can continue my routine of putting on makeup and drying my hair! By the time I’m done, my son is up and dressed! Then we go downstairs to eat breakfast together.
 Laura | January 19, 2011 at 1:25 pm | 
I have to follow my same night and morning routines. When I fall out of routine, I end of scrambling around and running late. I have to go to bed at about the same time every night, wake up the same time every morning, start my coffee, then feed my cats, watch the news, check e-mail, shower at the same time every morning, etc. If I vary from my routine even a little bit (i.e. feed the cats before I make coffee), I get so thrown off, I lose track of time! I have been like this as long as I can remember. My mom was very good with setting me up on a morning routine when I was very little, and I feel it makes me organized and more energized. Strange, I know, but it definitely works for me.
 Jaynel | January 19, 2011 at 1:25 pm | 
i prepare for the next morning by setting out clothes and having my shower before i go to bed. I would love a Keurig.
 LuAnn K | January 19, 2011 at 1:25 pm | 
Here is one way that we make the morning go smoother. While my husband is getting ready, I turn on the computer and check e-mail and facebook. Then I go get ready while he checks e-mail and facebook. Then we get the kids up for school. This way we both get a few minutes to catch up with our world before taking on the day.
 Jana | January 19, 2011 at 1:26 pm | 
I prepare well the night before, especially when it comes to my morning-must-have, coffee! Since I don’t (yet) have a Keurig coffee maker, I prepare the one I do have and set its timer so that the coffee is fresh and ready when I wake up.
 Lindsey | January 19, 2011 at 1:26 pm | 
To avoid the “I have nothing to wear!” issue. Sunday I lay out all my outfits for the whole week and hang them in a separate area in my closet with clothes pins clipped to each hanger with the days of the week written on them. I include socks, jackets, shoes, jewelry, anything else that might make a morning stressful trying to find in the grogginess before getting my coffee. With having to look Business Professional everyday this really helps to have it all laid out since the only thing I want to wear in the mornings are my sweatpants : )
 Laura Frisch | January 19, 2011 at 1:27 pm | 
Maintain same routine 7 days a week. Go to bed at the same time and rise at the same time. Usually have the kids get their bathes and showers the night before and coffee is ready and made on a time every morning. Lunches are made the night before, so that they can grab it and run.

 Debbie Korkodilos | January 19, 2011 at 1:28 pm | 
Have lunches made the night before, clothes laid out for both kids, coffee maker set to auto brew, alarm set for earlier than the kids. Books, shoes, coats all by the door and of course the leash too. Breakfast orders the night before. I“like”you on facebook already.
 Kati F | January 19, 2011 at 1:28 pm | 
I don’t iron in the morning…I Dewrinkle!! Love that setting on my dryer!!
 Cynthia King | January 19, 2011 at 1:28 pm | 
To save time in the mornings I make sure my house is in order, garbage is emptied,dishes are done,living area cleaned up,take shower,make lunches,take out food for next nights dinner,set up coffee maker, lay out cloths,it saves time in morning but is also nice because I come home to a house that is neat and clean after work and that’s when I sit and enjoy my All You magazine and enter sweepstakes ect
 angie | January 19, 2011 at 1:28 pm | 
I make sure everything is ready to go the night before clothes are laid out dishes are done( for some reason when dishes are done it just makes life seem less stressed) I have the cusinart that uses the kcups so it makes things easier the kids just grab their hot coco in the morning and can also make oatmeat or grits with the hot water function. So easy to use.
 Alice Warren | January 19, 2011 at 1:28 pm | 
I try and get as much done the night before. Bucause my 4 year old is a late sleeper and keeps wanting a few more minutes haha how funny at 4 but i digress then the next morning i make the first attempt to wake her when she“hits the snooze”i go make get dressed. Second attemp snooze again then i go get hings ready to fix breakfast this usually continues for about 15 minutes or so then i get sleepyhead out of bed to the start her day.
 Katie | January 19, 2011 at 1:28 pm | 
When I’m really prepared, I like to pre-make my daughter’s lunch and have it in the fridge. I also have pancake batter mixed in the fridge so we can have a nice breakfast before she goes to school and I love to have my coffee in the pot ready to press“Start”because I love and need my morning coffee!
 Tina Smith | January 19, 2011 at 1:29 pm | 
I do all of the oldiest like packing backpacks the night before and setting out clothes. I make pancakes and waffles during the weekend and freeze them for quick breakfast options. My daughter (who is 12) has picked up my need for lists and makes her own every night before bed. My one best tip is to take a few minutes for yourself before starting the day. I love to spend just 15 minutes listening to a meditation or an easy yoga program to wake up fresh!
 Sharon S | January 19, 2011 at 1:29 pm | 
I always set the coffeepot timer the nite before, put my purse, keys and anything I may need to bring with me near the door- it would be so nice to have a coffeemaker with K-cups incase I have a senior moment and forget to set the coffeepot-
 Jenni Cenname | January 19, 2011 at 1:29 pm | 
I find my mornings always run the smoothest when I wake up atleast 30 minutes before the time I need to get ready and be on time. This way I have enough time to enjoy a cup of coffee (from the pot that was pre-programmed the night before) and be fully awake before I have to get everything together. On mornings we have to be out the door at a specific time I do not turn on the computer or TVs, it is too easy to let these become a distraction and lose time in the process. Also, every evening we lay out all clothes, down to socks and shoes in one spot so that we know exactly where they are and what we are wearing. Finally, it is important to keep healthy to-go breakfasts on hand such as, pre-made whole wheat muffins and already sweetened whole wheat waffles. If time does get away from us we can eat in the car and save about 20 minutes!
 Olga Gintchin | January 19, 2011 at 1:31 pm | 
We all have our own duties in the morning. Husband takes out the dogs, I put up the dog gates, son feeds and waters the dogs, etc. so everyone is put to good use. We also are post-it note happy so if there is something unique going on that day that we might forget we always put a sticky on the door as a reminder.
 Beth M | January 19, 2011 at 1:31 pm | 
I already like you on FB. My time saving morning tip is to lay out things the night before and make sure everything the kids need is ready. It just saves hassle the next day!
 Bev | January 19, 2011 at 1:31 pm | 
Hubby&amp;I have different taste in strength/taste of coffee. We have 2 coffee‘stations’on opposite ends of the counter with our coffee in cabinets above. This has eliminated us waiting to use the same items/space, and we start our mornings together in an enjoyable atmosphere.
 Kim M | January 19, 2011 at 1:33 pm | 
Make a list the night before of what I need to do the next day. This always saves me time and ensures I don’t forget any errands or tasks I need to complete.
 Marie B. | January 19, 2011 at 1:33 pm | 
Get ready the night before, but start the morning with a fresh cup of coffee. My coffee maker just gave out so a new one would be great instead of instant coffee.
Three small children make for a busy day so teeping on routine is key.
 Sami | January 19, 2011 at 1:33 pm | 
We all take supplements and some medications. While I’m sipping my first few sips before anyone else has gotten up I get every-ones stuff out of the cupboard and put it on the counter in their areas. The rule is when you take it, you put it away. That way, we know if it’s still sitting out, who to double check with and make sure they get on it. Works like a dream.
 Mary Jane Goodell | January 19, 2011 at 1:33 pm | 
MJ’s TOP FIVE TIPS
_________

TIP #1:“GRAB N GO.”Get lunch(es) ready to go and into the fridge. Have a small bag of snacks in the fridge ready to go when you go.

Note: I’m not sure about you, but I get hungry when I’m out running errands, or on the way to work, or babysitters, or grocery store…you get the picture. I’ve found it’s cost effective and healthier to carry some sort of snack for yourself and/or baby. Please also refer to TIP #4.
_________

TIP #2:“MMM SMELL THAT COFFEE.”Clean out our coffee pot the night before (if you have one), get the coffee in there and ready for morning except for the water. All you’d have to do is pour in water and press start. (Or use your brand new Keurig!)
_________

TIP #3:“TAKE 5.”I highly recommend taking a shower the night before so in the morning you can take 5-10 minutes to put on some make up, enjoy a cup of coffee, do some stretches, read the newest issue of ALL YOU.. or simply take five to do anything, because let’s face it: you’ve earned it!
_________

TIP #4:“BABY TO GO.”Each time I come home from being out with my 3.5 month old I refill the diaper bag with extra diapers, a clean burp cloth, a clean outfit, a clean changing pad, formula, bottle(s), nipple(s)and a few snacks for me (homemade peanut butter crackers, almonds, 100 calorie snack bar, etc). Then I can almost literally buckle in my baby and go!

_________

TIP #5:“FILL‘ER UP.”Because mornings can be hectic, I’ve found it easier to fill up on gas if I’m low or on empty, the night before. Then I don’t have to worry about stopping at the gas station, waiting in line, pulling back out into traffic, etc.

_________

I hope you’ve found these helpful! I’m so glad we’ve all been able to share tips and strategies. Cheers to“ALL (of ) YOU”!!

Warm wishes,
MJ

I pick out my clothes, have clean dishes and more. I use http://www.flylady.net 
 Mary Beth | January 19, 2011 at 1:34 pm | 
I am a fan of All You on FB and love the magazine!
To minimize morning stress, I lay out clothes for my son the night before, and pack my briefcase and lay out my own clothes. I also set up the coffeepot–I’d love to be able to skip that step by winning a Keurig!
 Dawn | January 19, 2011 at 1:34 pm | 
I set the alarm clock ahead 15 minutes–really does work to get me up with enough time to enjoy a cup of coffee before I head out the door!
 Alicia | January 19, 2011 at 1:34 pm | 
My 9 year old likes to lay around in the mornings and tries to stall. So I decided to get him a timer. I set it for his shower and then again while he is getting dressed. He always tries to race to see if he can beat. It makes it fun for him and less stressful for me. It has helped so much with his time management that now he can help me do a few things to speed things up in the morning.
 Rebecca | January 19, 2011 at 1:34 pm | 
The most creative way I save time in the morning is by being disorganized.

The more organized I am the more forgetful I am. So no matter what time I get up I first make that pot of coffee. Then head to the shower and get ready for a great day at work.
 Jill | January 19, 2011 at 1:34 pm | 
sleepy, sleepy in the cold northeasty;
please alarm clock, please dont ring!
a storm every week, my car windshield to scrape;
so hard to get out bed, for goodness sake!
finally i arise, after lying in bed;
too cold to shower, i wish for a keurig.
i warm up the car, after slipping on the ice;
after fussing with the coffee pot.. ooh that coffee tastes nice.
i wash the face, and brush thy teeth;
its off to work i go the coffee is all i need!
 Sharon | January 19, 2011 at 1:35 pm | 
As soon as I get up&amp;into the kitchen, I turn on the coffee maker&amp;while the coffee is brewing, I unload the dishes from the dishwasher&amp;put them all away.

I get my boys up&amp;while they are eating breakfast, I get on the computer&amp;check the latest deals&amp;the Daily Freebie on AllYou.com.

Then, after cleaning up after breakfast……we begin another day“homeschooling”.
I drink coffee all day&amp;would love to have this!
Thanks!
 Fern Cruz | January 19, 2011 at 1:35 pm | 
I prepare my mornings the night before, Put outfits together, make lunches/or have money ready. I also have easy breakfasts on hand, waffles, cereal, yogurt, fruit, juice. Also I have a white marker board on the door going out to the garage which has all of our schedules, deadlines, homework, meetings,etc. It makes it ease to scan in the morning to see if there needs to be anything picked up, kids to soccer, Dr. appointments etc. The family knows this is our“go to”place for all activities, and it is so easy to add or remove anything…I would LOVE a KEURIG !!! My friend has one but it would be difficult to get it out of her kitchen without being noticed! What a time saver as well as being able to have so many flavors available for everyones taste. Looking forward to having my own! Thank you!
 Lisa L. | January 19, 2011 at 1:37 pm | 
I brush my teeth in the shower on days I feel rushed.
 Natalie S. | January 19, 2011 at 1:37 pm | 
I already“like”you on facebook:) most creative tip…well of course set up coffee the night before, but to make it even more enjoyable add any extract of your choice (i.e. vanilla or almond extract)…it makes it all the better in the morn!! however, would love me some keurig to make it even more enjoyable!! what would be better than basically someone (the keurig) making for you!! it’s like coffee in bed basically!! 
 caroline speer | January 19, 2011 at 1:38 pm | 
When i go to bed i set the alarm for 7am when i have my family over. I have the coffee set to turn on so i can have my morning cup of coffee as soon as i wake up, and i relax in peace while on the computer going through my emails and playing sweepstakes, then around 10 my kids and grandkids get up so i make them breakfast and i feel so refreshed by then and couldnt have done that without my morning coffee. I drink coffee all day long and my sisters they come over daily so we all drink coffee and have snacks and chat alot its a family tradion that we all love, and will continue to do so,and thats what makes my mornings so great, my family and a great cup of coffee to start my day.
 Gayle | January 19, 2011 at 1:38 pm | 
I lay all the outfits out on couch, get the lunch bags out on counter and things that do not need kept cold i add to bags, Vitamins and allergy meds put on breakfast plates on table. I try to make as little as steps as possible in the AM. getting 2 young kids out in the AM is hard.
 Loremil | January 19, 2011 at 1:38 pm | 
Bath the night before, so my 6 yr old and I are not arguing in the morning. We are not morning people. My 6 months old just watches us. Of course, clothes, backpack, and snacks ready. I also have my clothes ready. I let my daughter pick out her clothes or she waste time looking for a certain color shirt.
 Dawn Staniszeski | January 19, 2011 at 1:39 pm | 
Take the time on the weekend to plan your week ahead of time..Plan your meals and what you are going to wear each day and have those clothes already put together so when you get up you won’t be spending alot of time looking for something. And utilize your Crock Pot…saves alot of time especially if you have everything together to throw into it before you walk out of the house!
 Brenda Estes | January 19, 2011 at 1:41 pm | 
My kids are grown now but I still do the same way with my husband and I as I did when our kids were small by preparing all things the night before and it makes a stress free morning.
 Belinda Gale | January 19, 2011 at 1:42 pm | 
Do you have a great tip for making your mornings more efficient?..Yes I do..when I wake, the first thing I do is stretch..then I think to my self I have woke to enjoy another day with my family and that puts a smile on my face and energy in my step..that starts my morning off stress free..also it helps to have everything organized the night before and in it’s place so that you know where everything is…and when your family works together to help each other out, the morning runs more smoothly, teamwork is a must for an efficient morning 
 darla parkhill | January 19, 2011 at 1:43 pm | 
we get everything set out the night before, clothes, homework, backpack…a keurig would make it alot easier on all of us…kids could even make hot chocolate with it…would love to win one…seen them on qvc and it would be great…
 julia B | January 19, 2011 at 1:43 pm | 
I personally find it less stressful to plan my day to leave the house before anyone else wakes up! Coffee set to perc at the same time so it is ready for me when I walk out the door.
Have proven to my dr that this keeps my BP lower.
 Tiffany Scholl | January 19, 2011 at 1:44 pm | 
I have 5 1/2 year old twin boys so my life is nothing but a schedule. Ever since they were born they and I have been on a schedule. Even to this day their schedule is so routine that they use the bathroom within minutes of each other. HAHAHA!!! Every night I get their clothes ready and sitting in their room for morning. Their backpacks are ready and at the back door. They go to bed at the same time every night and wake up at the same time in the morning. I get up and do the same routine…shower, hair, makeup, then get the boys up and ready for school. Make their breakfast and head out the door. All within about an hour. I can’t imagine how chaotic my life would be if i didn’t stick to the daily routine.
 Depsy Lamar | January 19, 2011 at 1:45 pm | 
My husband is a US Marine so we run the mornings like the military!!! We make it fun though…our kids are 2 and 8 years old so we“march”to get our cloths on and then“march”to brush our teeth and so on. My husband yells out“hut 2,3,4″and we all giggle and TRY to be serious as we get things done. Its worked for us, and until they are too old to enjoy it, we will continue doing it.
 pauline cullers | January 19, 2011 at 1:45 pm | 
If you have a varied schedule like I do it is best to prepare everything you’LL NEED SUCH AS PHONE NUMBERS, DOCUMENTS,ADDRESSES, etc the night before. Also create a timeline and priority list. having this ready to go in the morning is a tremendous timesaver. have everything ready to go including clothes, shoes, meds everything packed and ready to go. night before is also the time to plan the next day’s dinner; check to make sure you have all the needed ingredients. if necessary make shopping list. communicate with those you need to transport such as your kids; and those people you have to meet with or call.the more you plan ahead the more you’ll get done and the easier it’ll
be for you and others.
 Brenda | January 19, 2011 at 1:45 pm | 
Set my programmable coffeemaker the night before so I always wake up to fresh coffee Oh, and I also set my alarm about 10 minutes early so I can hit the snooze once or twice and feel like I’m getting away with a few extra minutes, when I’m really not 
 Patty | January 19, 2011 at 1:46 pm | 
I like on face book
 Teresa | January 19, 2011 at 1:47 pm | 
Make sure the coffee is ready!!
 Lee Ann | January 19, 2011 at 1:47 pm | 
I start my only child’s day by waking her up and telling her what she has to look forward to for that day. It may seem like a little thing, but starting the day with a good attitude is MORE THAN half the battle for any of us!
 Debbie | January 19, 2011 at 1:47 pm | 
I prepare the necessary things the night before,clothing, lunch, notes to remind myself of things to be done . This process allows time in the morning for myself to do some yogic breathing/yoga. Allowing time for ones self is the best way to start the day, along with my cup of tea/coffee!
 Patty | January 19, 2011 at 1:47 pm | 
I make the kids lunches the night before, I also check their back packs for anything that needs to be signed and I set the coffee maker so it is ready when I crawl out of bed.
 Jessie | January 19, 2011 at 1:48 pm | 
Have no plan other than make sure everyone is dressed and fed. Oatmeal only takes a sec and everyone knows if momma isn’t making pancakes already, it isn’t going to happen.

I know i will not get picked never do. just wanted to tell you all I love this mag. it is always a joy yo read it.thanks
 patti | January 19, 2011 at 1:48 pm | 
set up coffee the night before. unrefrigerated items in lunchboxes. coats/shoes/backpacks @ the back door and outfits decided on. We’ve been in a breakfast rut of cereal or oatmeal so we’ve been making (lowfat) muffins or quick breads the night before for a more interesting fast and easy breakfast.
 Mary | January 19, 2011 at 1:48 pm | 
I make sure the diaper bag is packed up the night before with everything we are going to need for that day out (snacks, formula, diapers, etc). I also double check with my husband each night to make sure we are on the same page with what is going on the next day.
 Lyndsey | January 19, 2011 at 1:49 pm | 
I’m a newlywed, and definitely not a morning person, so getting my husband as well as myself ready for the day is a challenge. I find that programming our (ancient!) coffeemaker the night before is such a help. Waking up to the smell of coffee can get anyone’s day started right. I also package up lunch the night before, as well as check to see that our clothes are prepped for the AM. Who wants to iron at 6am? Not me! And post-it note reminders are a life saver!
 MICHELE | January 19, 2011 at 1:49 pm | 
I already“liked”you on fb, before this.
 melinda mazzocco | January 19, 2011 at 1:50 pm | 
key here is to pre pre everything the night before, to laying out clothes, setting coffee pot, making pancake batter and putting in fridge..etc. taking a few extra minutes each night saves alot of stress in the morning. we are not morning people. so its essentail to get up, have the coffee ready then start our day. then its eat, get dressed and grab out book bag and bags that are already sitting by the door
 Doc Poteet | January 19, 2011 at 1:50 pm | 
I have everything ready the night before..including my coffee…it is on a timer to be brewed fresh each morning
 MICHELE | January 19, 2011 at 1:50 pm | 
I do’nt have a really creative tip, I just try to get my kids’clothes out before I got to bed, then I have them help me get stuff going and their breakfasts made and they love to help pack their lunches.
 Brandi Hernandez | January 19, 2011 at 1:51 pm | 
I am unemployed at this time so I stay home with my youngest of 3. I usually set my coffee pot and have their lunches done the night before, but since my sister got a Keurig for Christmas I’ve skipped making my coffee at home. Since I can’t afford one right now,every morning once my oldest kids go to school, I drive 15 minutes to my sister’s house just so I can have Keurig coffee:)
 LisaL | January 19, 2011 at 1:51 pm | 
I am learning more and more that being on a schedule and being prepared the night before is a MUST for our morning routine to go smoothly. I always have my boys (Ages 10 and 5) get their backpacks laid out along with shoes, snow boots, hats, gloves, jackets, etc the night before. They also lay their clothes out in their rooms the night before Hubby makes breakfast and coffee while I get ready for work. It’s pretty much tag team in the mornings but thank goodness the boys are old enough to help out. Our routine doesn’t vary much and I think that is so important for children.

I would love a Keurig as my hubby and I have different tastes in coffee!
 Shannon | January 19, 2011 at 1:51 pm | 
I have my children pick out their clothes for the week on Sunday, that way I only need to approve the outfits one time. Then I also plan out breakfasts, so that the children don’t get to dally around trying to decide what to eat.
 Debbie S. | January 19, 2011 at 1:52 pm | 
After several mornings getting to work and realizing I had forgotten something at home including my office keys, I came up with this solution: The night before gather the things I will need and PUT THEM IN THE CAR RIGHT THEN!!! I also make our lunches ahead and there is a note on our backdoor near our car keys to remind us to open the fridge and grab our lunches. No more turning around in the morning to go home and get what we forgot 
 Robin McDonald | January 19, 2011 at 1:53 pm | 
I have 2 teenagers. My 15 year old daughter seems to get up in the mornings just fine. My 16 year old son however is not quite as easy. So in order to save time, money and countless words I pour a bowl of ice on him to wake him up. I do realize this has nothing to do with coffee but IT WORKS. By the way he does like and drink coffee so being the sweet mother I am and for waking him up in the mornings I do have coffee waiting on him. 
 xpressomama | January 19, 2011 at 1:54 pm | 
Of course you have to prepare the night before with clothes, shoes, backpacks, and keys. In the mornings I set a timer so that I don’t lose track of time (it feels like a challenge! ha!) and making yourself smile sets the mood. I have been singing zippity do dah to get me laughing until I get that sip of coffee and go ahhhhhhh.
 Debra Smith | January 19, 2011 at 1:54 pm | 
We all get up in 30 intrevals..the earlier bird gets the hottest water.
 Gigi | January 19, 2011 at 1:54 pm | 
my tip for saving time:
with two small children, it would take me forever to get them ready for school. So I created a chart of their responsibilities in the morning. If they do it all by themselves, they get special treats when they get home after school. Special points to anyone who does it without whining.
 Susan Stossel | January 19, 2011 at 1:54 pm | 
The best tip I can give is to get your coffee brewing in the morning, because there is nothing better than the aroma of coffee to get you moving and out the door. Works for me.
 Miranda | January 19, 2011 at 1:54 pm | 
I prepare my Keurig brewer the night before w/ my Kcup, water and coffee cup so I just have to start the machine and my cup will be ready in less than 2 mins. I also plan my outfits and lay everything out that i’ll need for the next day before I go to bed that night.
 Erica | January 19, 2011 at 1:54 pm | 
Only tip i can offer is have 5 different alarm clocks so we all can wake up 
 Amanda Layton | January 19, 2011 at 1:55 pm | 
No one in our house is a“Morning”person especially the kids! Mornings are not only hetic but seem to be the breeding grounds for early morning arguments between the kids. #1 AM Arguement….Who will be riding up front on the way to school! I decided I had had enough of this! I made a Chart…the“Front Seat Privilege”chart! This chart has the date and the child’s name to whom the privilege belongs to for the day! It is now posted on the basement door that leads to the garage. AMEN! It works! No more arguements over who will ride in the front seat! The kids simply look at the chart and comply! I should make more charts, huh?
 Amy | January 19, 2011 at 1:55 pm | 
The easiest thing to do is preplan and have things set up the night before. I always do it after making dinner becuase then I only have to clean up one mess. This makes my mornings run much smoother.
 Bridget | January 19, 2011 at 1:55 pm | 
I wash my hair and put it in a bun before I go to bed so it’s wavy and ready to go when I wake up. I also do the usual setting of the coffee pot the night before and making a batch of mini cupcake size quiches once a week. They freeze and reheat great!
 Lorynn | January 19, 2011 at 1:56 pm | 
Pack lunches the night before, lay out clothing the night before–and set your coffee in the filter the night before (I need coffee to function in the morning first thing!) If anyone wakes up late I always keep fruit bars and toaster pastries on hand for that“run out the door”breakfast!
 Kelly W | January 19, 2011 at 1:56 pm | 
I have a 9 month old and a 3 year old. Our mornings are very hurried no matter what I have done the night before. My 3 year old is learning to be independent, so I have a picture chart of everything she can do on her own and she moves her magnets when she has finished parts of her morning routine like handwashing and toothbrushing. I help her with combing her hair and dressing herself, getting her bookbag and we move those magnets, too! I am hoping eventually she will be standing at the door ready to go, having accomplished everything herself. She will know she is done because all of her magnets are lined up!
 Kathy | January 19, 2011 at 1:57 pm | 
Keep everyone Moving! I have 2 boys 8 and 5. The 8 yr old is SLOW, the 5 yr old is quick! So I make sure I have the 8 yr old have everything ready the night before! I LOVE ALL YOU!
 Carole Miller | January 19, 2011 at 1:58 pm | 
My tip is to keep moving. Prepare as much as you can the night before but when you have a daughter, all bets are off. Be prepared to fix a different breakfast, iron a blouse/top, or whatever. At any rate, have the coffee ready! Back in the day, a Keurig would have been WONDERFUL!! It still would be.
 elizabeth reisner | January 19, 2011 at 1:59 pm | 
Its all about schedule in my home. Anything that can be done the night before is done, and school bags are sitting by the door, ready to go. I always get up 30 minutes earlier than the kids so I can be showered and dressed. This way I can get the kids moving, fed, and out the door as well. Coffee is always a good helper for me as well. I’d absolutely love to win a Keurig to replace my old coffee maker!
 Jessica | January 19, 2011 at 1:59 pm | 
My mornings can be pretty crazy sometimes. I try to cut corners by packing lunches the night before and having the coffee timer set for 6 AM. Since everyone is always running late in the morning (lol) I have a box of nutrigrains right next to the coffee pot, so everyone can have breakfast on the way to their destination 
 elizabeth reisner | January 19, 2011 at 2:00 pm | 
I also already like All You on FB 
 julia mcintosh | January 19, 2011 at 2:02 pm | 
I always get the coffee pot ready for the next morning the night before. So much easier for me and my husband when we have to get two teenage daughters and a 5 yr old up for school. Also laying out clothes the night before and having backpacks ready to go makes the day go much easier instead of running around looking for lost items.

My husband spoils me.. he makes coffee when he gets up.. and brings me a cup before I even get out of bed and before he goes to work..got to love that. He is such a great man. All my kids are grown and have homes of their own. When they were young it was very crazy in the mornings.. now I can relax some..
 Katie Atkinson | January 19, 2011 at 2:03 pm | 
With my husband in the Army, and have 3 children to be ready for school every morning, mornings are very hectic. My morning starts 30 minutes before everyone wakes, so I wake up at 4:30 a.m. I start the coffee, take all 3 dogs outside, get myself sorta ready, then begin on my husbands breakfast. Something quick, usually eggs, sausage or bacon, and toast, sometimes pancakes or french toast. At 5:30 I start waking my kids and make their breakfast, get them dressed, double check their homework. Then we all sit down and read a chapter of a book before school starts. This is my morning Monday through Friday. I love every bit of it.
 Sarah G. | January 19, 2011 at 2:03 pm | 
We get everything ready the night before. Shoes, coats, and bookbags by the door, lunch made and in the fridge in lunchbags so we can just grab and go, clothes laid out on dresser. Oh and Coffee already ready to just hit on (mine is a cheapy that doesn’t have a timer).
 LYNDA | January 19, 2011 at 2:03 pm | 
The key to a morning routine it to prepare the night before. Lunches are made, table is set, clothes are picked out, and backpacks ready! Got to have coffee in the morning, and a Keurig machine would simplify breakfast for me!
 Gary | January 19, 2011 at 2:04 pm | 
I set my bedroom clock an hour early while leaving the other clocks correctly set. That always allows me an extra hour to really enjoy the waking process. It is like having a 25 hour day.
 Lindsey B | January 19, 2011 at 2:06 pm | 
I bought 5 foam door hangers and decorated each with the days of the week. On Sundays I lay out my outfits for the week not only to make sure my mornings run smoothly, but having everything ready Sunday allows me to spend my evenings snuggled up on the couch with my boyfriend and dog watching ou fav. tv shows. I hang the door hangers over the hangers of everything that i’m going to need for the mornings and set all the outfits in a seperate part of my closet. I first made the hangers when I was packing for a long trip and couldn’t keep up with how many outfits I was packing. I enjoyed this organization so much when I worked as a teacher for a daycare I made it our art prodject one day. The parents loved how their children made use of their new organizational tools and said every weekend they did the same routine I did. It made everyones mornings go a lot smoother.
 Amy C. | January 19, 2011 at 2:06 pm | 
Outfits, Bookbags&amp;granola bars are ready the night before. My work bag, travel coffee cup and purse are in spot the night before as well. Coffee maker is set to 5:30am to brew for me. I have the hubby take all bags to the car (my garage) when he leaves for work which saves me from looking like a pack mule when I walk out the door in the morning with my two kids and a baby car seat! Best tip I can give is to get your hubby to help you out. Work as a team, you don’t get as overwhelmed. I know it’s hard for the“Perfect Mom”to ask for help but it works! Even something as small as having him getting my son’s chocolate milk ready in the morning helps my day go WAY smoother! Thank you dear husband of mine!
 Alicia | January 19, 2011 at 2:06 pm | 
I already FB you. I like frozen iced coffee in the AM, so I perk the coffee the night before. I freeze it in plastic containers, whatever size works for you. I put the blender on the counter and anything I will need to take with me, I place by the door. In the morning I give the frozen coffee a quick blast in the microwave until it starts to unthaw a little, put it in the blender with milk, additional ice cubes and flavoring, I like french vanilla syrup. When it is ready, I put it in my large travel mug, rinse everything out, and I am ready to go.
 Stacy | January 19, 2011 at 2:07 pm | 
I already“like”u on FB And the Kuerig would be the item that would make my life&amp;morning better!!!! With 2 kids, ages 10&amp;5, it’s very difficult to get out the door in a timely manner. I do lay their clothes out the nite before&amp;their backpacks are ready to go too….but it still seems like I go crazy every morning!!!!
 Maria Greve | January 19, 2011 at 2:07 pm | 
We do everything at night for the next morning: set the Mr. Coffee timer, lay out clothing&amp;shoes, make lunches and stash them in the fridge, make sure all homework and school stuff is packed up and ready to grab. I also pour cereal in Tupperware bowls with lids so it’s ready for the kids to add the milk in the morning!
 Machell S. | January 19, 2011 at 2:08 pm | 
I have had my mornings stress free for years. When my children were little I would lay cloths out, pack lunches and have breakfast items ready the night before. Now that they are grown I don’t have to worry about them but I do now have 5 dogs to care for not to mention my husband. But as for me husband his lunch is packed and coffee pot (not a Keurig) set with coffee mugs set on counter all the night before. The dogs I just keep there clean feeding bowls on the counter waiting. So All I have to do is feed them, let them out and then were good to go.
 sherry | January 19, 2011 at 2:08 pm | 
I take one day every few weeks and bake/prepare muffins, pancakes, waffles, french toast and freeze in portions. Then in mornings, I can microwave home made items, add juice/coffee-quickly! Thanks for the giveaway!
 Robin Brigman | January 19, 2011 at 2:08 pm | 
To save time in the morning I try and get up before the kids (2 boys-4 and 2) are up and get breakfast on the table ready to eat as soon as they get out of bed. I also prepare there toothbrushes in advance so it make the process as smooth as possible. Also during the winter without having to go outside I use my remote start for my car and pre-heat the car without leaving the house and I pre-set the dials on heat settings the night before.
 Leatta Workman | January 19, 2011 at 2:10 pm | 
We have 10 kids (ages 14, 11, 10, 8, 7, 6, 3, and three 2 year olds)so without a plan, mornings can be dreadfully bad. Each of the older children is paired with another and are a team. When the team is done with their morning list, they get an inspection. Things like having the cleanest room, record time or being the best dressed earn bonuses like picking the dessert for supper or saving bonuses for a big bonus like a trip to the movies. I cannot wait, until the 3 year old and three 2 year olds are old enough to be on a morning team.

Right now I never have time for a good coffee in the morning and it would be a great start to the day. I’ve tried adding flavorings to instant and“singles”(tea bag style) but the terrible flavor is still noticable.
 Chelsea | January 19, 2011 at 2:11 pm | 
I’m at home with a 3 month old right now, so the mornings are pretty much up to her! The best thing right now is to make a list the night before and then review it in the AM. That way it keeps me focused on what needs to get done for the day. My husband leaves for work early and I am usually drinking the leftover coffee once baby and I wake up since I don’t need a whole new pot. I am thinking a Keurig would work perfectly for us!
 Julie Isely | January 19, 2011 at 2:12 pm | 
When my children were little I would bathe them before bed and put on the clothes that they were going to wear the next day. No arguments or struggles with getting dressed in a.m. and if they were still sleeping just throw a coat on and go.
 Leah Brislin | January 19, 2011 at 2:12 pm | 
I am a homeschool mom of five. Mornings start at 4 a.m. for my husband and I, and most days we’re on the go to classes here and there by 9 a.m. To help with the morning rush, I spend a few minutes while I’m preparing dinner to put together the breakfasts and lunches we’ll need for the day. After dinner, I make sure all shoes, bags, and coats are found. I also brew a pot of coffee, to be reheated in the morning for speed. It would be awesome to have a Keurig so I can enjoy fresh coffee fast!
 Kimberly Wood | January 19, 2011 at 2:12 pm | 
I shower the night before and get out my clothes, books and whatever I (we) need for the day. I set out bowls for the cereal and do as much as I can ahead of tiem so I don’t have to stress as much in the morning. While I am finishing my make up I have the car warming up and defrosting.
 Lizz D. | January 19, 2011 at 2:14 pm | 
Get as much done the night before as possible! Kids clothes laid out, breakfast planned, etc…
Always get yourself ready first before you get the kids up…even if it means having to get up a little earlier! When you are all ready, it makes everything else flow so much easier.
Limit distractions in the morning. Like, no t.v. until everything is done and ready to go in the morning. Then if there is time, let the kids watch a program while you finish up and are ready to head out the door!
 Elizabeth Santana | January 19, 2011 at 2:14 pm | 
As a working Mom, every time saver that I can put in place I just have to.

Each night as I am making dinner, I am also preparing lunches and setting up the coffee maker (with the timer set for 5 minutes before my alarm).

While my lillte one is in the bathtub, I am laying out outfits for the next day. Multi-tasking. Mom’s middle name.
 Laura Johnson | January 19, 2011 at 2:14 pm | 
One of the things I make and keep in the freezer to make breakfast faster is egg and sausage burritos. I cook 1 lb of ground sausage, onions, and green peppers and then in a separate pan I scramble six eggs. Then I put a dozen flour tortillas in the microwave for 30 second so they are soft and bendable. I put the eggs, sausage, onions, and green peppers inside each flour tortilla, fold them over, secure with a toothpick, and put them on a cookie sheet to freeze them. After they are frozen, I can bag them. Each morning I can then take them out of the freezer as needed and heat them up in the microwave for 1 minute each. It makes a quick and healthy breakfast. Serve with salsa if desired! It’s very portable too if you are on the run! They would be great with a cup of coffee, hot chocolate, or tea made in a Keurig coffee maker! 
 Rachel N | January 19, 2011 at 2:15 pm | 
I like you on Facebook. To save time in the mornings I try to prepare the night before, from making lunches to picking out outfits. Next I always try to keep a routine, brush teeth, shower, get dressed, start car to warm up, do hair, grab everything else and go. This coffee maker would really help me more by staying on my time schedule and having a good cup of coffee. Thanks Allyou!! 
 Diana | January 19, 2011 at 2:15 pm | 
My tip is“don’t sweat the small stuff”. The world will not end if your kids’clothes don’t match, if your hair and makeup aren’t perfect, or if the house isn’t immaculate. Sometimes it’s better to just sit down, relax, and have a nice cup of coffee.
 Wendy | January 19, 2011 at 2:16 pm | 
My hint? Do as much as possible the night before. Plan your outfit and accessories, lay out as much of breakfast as you can, set up the coffee pot and put anything you’ll need to take with you near the door.

Less stress in the mornings = happy family.
 haley allen | January 19, 2011 at 2:16 pm | 
I have small child so I always start by setting my coffee pot to brew just before I get up so the coffee is hot, ready,&amp;waiting for me! I also go ahead&amp;make my sons milk, juice,&amp;water cups so that we can go straight to the fridge&amp;get the when he wakes up&amp;we’re ready to walk out of the door. I also put my lunch in my lunch bag in the fridge so that I can grab it&amp;go. I do the same for my son’s snacks&amp;always pack his diaper bag at night with the outfits for the week&amp;diapers, etc.
 Jill Kerns | January 19, 2011 at 2:17 pm | 
LOVE ALL YOU on FB already and subscribe to the magazine. What makes it easier–getting up 30 minutes earlier and having ME time alone. I have time to get everyone’s things together (if I didn’t do it the night before), make coffee (nope no Keurig) LOL, check email, and get the day started.
 Jessica | January 19, 2011 at 2:17 pm | 
I love iced coffee in the am, summer or winter. So, my tip is to brew an entire pot of coffee on Sunday, having your coffee which ever way you want. Then you add whatever amount of sugar you want then refrigerate. Each morning I wake up and pour my‘iced’coffee and it is so easy!
 Summer | January 19, 2011 at 2:18 pm | 
On mornings when I have to get up early, I try to pick out my outfit the night before. I also either wash my hair the day before so that I don’t have to dry it and fix it. I wash my hair every other day to save time, electricity and split ends. Coffee first thing in the morning would help speed the morning on!!
 PinchingAbe | January 19, 2011 at 2:18 pm | 
I put my son’s lunch money in his folder the night before after he does his homework so I don’t forget it by accident the next day.
 Emmy Smith | January 19, 2011 at 2:19 pm | 
I save time by planning ahead the night before. I lay out things for lunches and get things organized so the mornings are not a rush to find things.
 Angela | January 19, 2011 at 2:19 pm | 
Time savers for me are: Pack my Son’s lunch the night before, put coffee mugs next to the coffee pot that is on auto, put my cell phone in my purse&amp;keys in my coat pocket, put all my Son’s things near the door. He has ADHD so keeping him on task is very hard in the am. We have a check list for him in the am to stay on task. This works most days for us. 
 Regina DuShane | January 19, 2011 at 2:19 pm | 
Best time saving tip in the morning is keep it simple.
 Cyn Davis | January 19, 2011 at 2:19 pm | 
On sundays I get all my clothes ready for the week. and lay out breakfast items the night before. Organization and pre-planning are key.
 Angela | January 19, 2011 at 2:20 pm | 
I make sure everyone has their clothing, shoes, backpacks and anything else they need for the day where it needs to be for the morning rush. My boyfriend makes the coffee in the morning while I am in the shower and getting ready for work. He brings me my coffee after I get out of the shower. We relax for a little while (on facebook) with our coffee and then start getting the kids up and ready for school. As long as we get all the items we need for the day set out and ready, the morning goes smoothly!!
 Kate | January 19, 2011 at 2:20 pm | 
I do as much as I can the night before. Shower, lay out clothes, set out dishes, get coffee maker ready to go.
 stacey | January 19, 2011 at 2:20 pm | 
For the crazy mornings when I have to travel to“the city”(DC) and leave 2 1/2 hours earlier than normal, I have it down to a science! The baby’s bag is packed and given to the Babysitter the day before so Hubbie can drop him off and I don’t have to worry he forgot something Clothes are laid out–down to the shoes and jewelry. I make sure to wash and flatiron my hair the night before so the morning primping ritual is minimal! Car is usually packed with everything except my banana and coffee. Baby’s diaper is laid out and bottle is ready to go in the fridge so DH doesn’t have to run around aimlessly trying to figure any of that out. It’s amazing how organized and how fast you can get ready when you know you need to beat the rush hour traffic.
 Lisa Robertson | January 19, 2011 at 2:20 pm | 
Get everything ready the day before. It saves on a lot of time in the morning.
 rachel | January 19, 2011 at 2:20 pm | 
I wish I did something to make my morning easier. I do just give up on crazy mornings and buy coffee.
 Malea Gardner | January 19, 2011 at 2:20 pm | 
I’m retired, but there is still routines. Like set the coffee pot, have everything cleaned before bed. Already a fan!! And would love this Keurig coffee maker have heard so much about it and of course all good…:)
 Adreth | January 19, 2011 at 2:20 pm | 
I make sure the kids lunches are made the night before, all notices are signed and put into the right place, my stuff that I need to take is right on the table. The kids put out their clothes the night before. I also set up my Keurig the night before-To start my morning morning off right I NEED my coffee!!!
 Nikita Nik | January 19, 2011 at 2:20 pm | 
I already like you on facebook . My best tip to save time in the morning is to get everything ready at night related to the things you do everyday or you are gonna do the other day. Whenever we plan to go out for long period the next morning we get our bags, snacks, clothes, tickets and purse/handbags ready. Even I try to get the breakfast half ready so that don’t have much work to do. It really helps in next morning and saves a lot of time. Not to forget going to bed on time to have a nice sleep to feel fresh next day.
 Katherine Ring | January 19, 2011 at 2:21 pm | 
Saving time in the am is paramount. There are 5 people in the house. Two are children&amp;three are adults. 2 of us drink cuppas daily. The pm before we pack backpacks, lunches in the fridge and shoes&amp;jackets are put by the front door. I wake about 1 hour before them and make a pot of cuppas. I wake them, get breakfast going while they shower&amp;dress then to the table for grub, lunches in backpacks&amp;time to spare for some talk time or TV. Out the door&amp;I return to my cuppas. Sometimes the coffee pot has turned off. It would be great to make a fresh cuppa in minutes!
 Kathy | January 19, 2011 at 2:21 pm | 
I preset my coffeemaker to start brewing around the time I’m getting up. By the time I shower and get dressed, my coffee is ready. I also set out breakfast dishes (cereal bowls, spoons, cereal boxes) the night before, that way we just need to pour the cereal, and we can eat.
 Laura Melendez | January 19, 2011 at 2:21 pm | 
I have ALL the clocks that I look at in the mornings set about 7 minutes ahead. My mind even when half awake knows I have to be on time and this assures that I make those deadlines, even if I procrastinate a little. I don’t get to have my coffee until I get to work.
 Tonya C | January 19, 2011 at 2:22 pm | 
Planning the night before. It makes those mornings just a little bit easier!
 tjay | January 19, 2011 at 2:22 pm | 
make lunches the night before and leave infridge to grab and go…
Have clothes picked out for the week for the kids and leave them on shelf in closet so each day they get up and pick a complete outfit and get dressed!
 Anne Marie | January 19, 2011 at 2:22 pm | 
Our morning begins with an automatic wake up from 2 lovey dogs, needing their morning outside. We make sure the night before, that the coffe pot is set up for morning brewing, clothes are ironed and waiting to go and lunches are made. We are the kind to get our vert last wink of sleep, so a quick jump up, quick brush of the teeth, into clean clothes and out the door we go. For all of night before prep, makes for a smooth out the door transitation.
 Lori Lee | January 19, 2011 at 2:22 pm | 
I have my youngest daughter set up her clothes the night before along with her backpack with everything ready for the next day.
 JoAnn R | January 19, 2011 at 2:22 pm | 
Already like“All You”on Facebook

Everyone shower the night before, have breakfast cereal or whatever ready to distribute Have coffee ready to go on a timer all done the night before as well.
 Julie Thinnes | January 19, 2011 at 2:22 pm | 
Mornings ae crazy with 3 girls and a hubby! The night before my girls and I lay out clothes for the next day so no one aruges about what they are going to wear. I also set the coffee pot to start before the alarm goes off so it’s all ready to drink. The girls go throught he lunch menu on the weekends for school and write their names on the calendar if they want lunch from home. So I get lunches packed before they get up. We have snacks and water bottles on the counter ready to grab and put into the back pack.
 michelle m | January 19, 2011 at 2:22 pm | 
I already like all you on face book!! Grea Mag!!
 Lori Brakefield | January 19, 2011 at 2:22 pm | 
Any time I can force myself to get up when the early alarm rings so I can go for a run, I find that my day goes much better and more stress-free! Now, a cool coffee maker can REALLY boost my motivation! 
 Janice Michaels | January 19, 2011 at 2:22 pm | 
We have everything ready the night before. We lay out what we are going to wear (even our socks&amp;undies!), pack the diaper bags (bottles ready in fridge), breakfast cooked&amp;ready to heat in the microwave and hopefully out the door on time!
 Cheryl | January 19, 2011 at 2:22 pm | 
I set the coffee maker at night before I go to be and I allow myself half an hour to chill and drink my coffee so the caffine has time to kick in!
 Tracy S | January 19, 2011 at 2:23 pm | 
I love to have a cup of coffee or hot coco in the morning but with work and kids there isn’t always time. I have family members who have just bought one of these and it is great. I would love to have one.
 Caroline Tomon | January 19, 2011 at 2:23 pm | 
Make sure the kids have their outfits ready for the next day before bedtime. Also pack their backpacks and have snacks all ready to go for the morning so all they have to do is get breakfast and brush their teeth and hair and we are out the door!!!
 Kimberly Wilson | January 19, 2011 at 2:23 pm | 
The night before we have everything ready clothes, lunches, keys, cars are gassed, backpacks ready. We set our coffee pot to start brewing at 4:30 am as soon as it is done brewing my husband an I immediately get out of bed and start our day with a yummy cup of coffee. We wake the kids (teenagers) up as we leave so they enough time to get ready.
 Shannon Backstrom | January 19, 2011 at 2:23 pm | 
When I put the kids clothes away, I always put them away as complete outfits. So pants, shirt, unddies and socks. This way the kids can open their closet and pick what they want. It is all complete. They feel like they have control over their clothes and I don’t have to help find something to match. I also have the kids make sure their backpacks are ready to go the night before. This makes mornings much less hectic.
 Heather Freed | January 19, 2011 at 2:23 pm | 
For me, preparation is key. I put clothes out, get lunches/diaper bag together–the more I have done the night before, the smoother my morning is!
 Andi | January 19, 2011 at 2:23 pm | 
Like you on facebook~!
 Kay Hazen | January 19, 2011 at 2:24 pm | 
In addition to having everything all laid out and ready for the next morning, which I try to do but don’t always accomplish. I get the kids up a half hour earlier then they really need to get up. It is hard some mornings, but we love having extra time in the morning, I don’t stress and yell at them all morning to hurry up. They get up lazily…eat…get dressed ect. and no one is rushed or stressed out. By the time we need to go, they are ready and happy!
 Connie Mize | January 19, 2011 at 2:24 pm | 
Have your kids lay their clothes out the night before and make lunches the night before.
 Erika Lowery | January 19, 2011 at 2:24 pm | 
My teen thinks it is a good idea to go to sleep with his clothes on.
I have the coffee pot set for 30 minutes before we wake up so we all have fresh, good smelling coffee to help us wake up.
Oh and hit snooze a few times. 
 jenniffer eads | January 19, 2011 at 2:24 pm | 
to make mornings a little smoother i set out 2 sets of clothes for my daughter the night before and she can pick from one of the 2 outfits to wear that day.. this way it saves alot of time trying to pick out what to wear!
 Angela C. | January 19, 2011 at 2:24 pm | 
One of the best things I know to make mornings lest chaotic is to do as much as I can the night before. Things such as lunch bags can be prepped the night before as well as already knowing what I plan to wear. I also try to set my self a schedule which isn’t always easy since I work as a cashier and do not have a set work schedule. I try to find a wake up and bedtime that will fit my varying daily work hours.
 Amanda | January 19, 2011 at 2:24 pm | 
Mornings are set up like a production line. I put my alarm clock across the room, so there is no snoozing. Then I turn on the shower to warm it up, head to the kitchen and turn on the coffee, get my clothes that have been ironed the night before, hop in the shower, get out, get dressed and go get my coffee then I am out the door. It makes the mornings go by smoother, which makes me happier when I get to work!!
 michelle m | January 19, 2011 at 2:24 pm | 
I am far from a morning person!! The only way I manage to get hubby and 2 kids off to school is to plan ahead. I make sure book bags are all set . Lunch boxes are made and in the fridge the night before. That gives me time to wake up and enjoy a cup of coffee before I have to get them dressed and out thedoor!!
 RetroDream | January 19, 2011 at 2:24 pm | 
CCCOOOOFFFFFFFFFFEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!! How strange that Coffee makes all the difference in the world for me to start the day. But…..it.is.true.
 Bethany Tyler | January 19, 2011 at 2:24 pm | 
We recently got a towel warmer. It has plenty of room to hang our next morning’s clothes complete with underwear and socks! It makes getting up and dressed on a col winter morning MUCH easier!
 Diana N | January 19, 2011 at 2:24 pm | 
TO make weekday mornings easier we do alot of planning on the weekend. There are 4 of us–we each wake up at a 15 mintue interval to shower, share the mirrors for makeup. I prep breakfast the night before–defrost what is needed to make quick work of preparing eggs. Each person gets a job: warm bacon (precooked, toast muffins, fry eggs. We pick outfits the night before and always make weekly menus so that I can prep dinner by defrosting or marinating before I leave for work. Then we car pool
 kathleen | January 19, 2011 at 2:25 pm | 
I am a HUGE morning person(I know—freak), but I actually get up at 5AM to make lunches/ensure all laundry is done and breakfast is made. This is also about my only time ALONE so I don’t mind. Could sure use some coffee to keep me awake then!
 Andi | January 19, 2011 at 2:25 pm | 
I prep a week’s worth of my son’s snacks in bags so when I pack his lunch in the morning I just grab one and go 
 Louise Holt | January 19, 2011 at 2:25 pm | 
I only drink one cup of coffee a day. I have resorted to instant coffee and microwave water because it is fast. If I would make a post of coffee it would go to waste. This is cheaper for me.
 Karen | January 19, 2011 at 2:25 pm | 
we pack our lunches the night before so they can grab and go and they will have what they want for lunch! We shower the night before! I get the kitchen ready for making breakfast! Having coffee so convenient in the morning would make it start fabulously!
 Susan F | January 19, 2011 at 2:25 pm | 
My day starts at 5:20 am getting a HS student ready for the bus at 6am. Honestly most women wont like this tip but it works fo me. My morning routine consists of throwing hair up in a pony, putting on moisturizer and chapstick. Doing that, I have time to get two kids and a hubby out the door on time.

The key is getting everything done the night before.
 Michaela Tacker | January 19, 2011 at 2:25 pm | 
I get everything ready the night before. Coffee and water measured and in the coffee pot. Clothes set out. Cups for coffee and plates for breakfast set out.

If breakfast is going to be cooked, I assemble it the night before.

I shower before bed so wet hair isn’t an issue–I’m not enough of a morning person to wake up early enough to dry my hair! I braid my wet hair before bed which keeps it smooth and keeps my waves in shape until morning.

I make sure my keys are hanging on a hook by the door so I don’t have any last minute key searches in the morning.

If I stick to my little night time routine, mornings go by smoothly!
 Lisa Kirby | January 19, 2011 at 2:25 pm | 
The key to a smooth morning…is a daily routine. Do the same thing every morning. The kids pick up the routine and they are relaxed always knowing what is coming next. Alarm, get dresses, brush hair&amp;teeth ect. This allows me to do what I need to do like pack lunches, make coffee and breakfast. I can expect my girls to come into the kitchen at roughly the same time every morning.

Hi
I always make sure I am up early enough to make a pot of coffee, read the newspaper or watch the news for a t least fifteen.I enjoy my breakfast and coffee first.Then,I start my day. I woull love a keurig machine,that would make my coffee real fast..
 Summer Shaddix | January 19, 2011 at 2:26 pm | 
My mornings would go by so much easier if we had one of these machines but in the meantime wake up when your alarm clock goes off and dont hit the snooze button, it’ll get you everytime!! That way you have plenty of time to enjoy your Millstone coffee made from your Keurig coffee maker!!

Granted my girls are all grown up and off to college but that still doesn’t mean that it’s not a run run morning for my husband and I. For me to get out of the door on time and to make sure he does as well I get up at least an hour before he does so I can get my shower in, make up on, etc…plus the most important thing of the morning-COFFEE! A lot of times I can’t wait for the pot to brew so I quick heat up a cup from the day before then start a new pot!
 Jennifer | January 19, 2011 at 2:26 pm | 
I try and prepare lunches for hubby and two kids the night before. I also cook twice as much when making waffles, pancakes, muffins etc…so they can be popped in toaster for a healthy fast breakfast!

Save time in the morning I try to group everything I need next to the door, like my car keys, purse, letters to be mailed. That way I’m less likely to forget stuff and get you going more quickly in the morning.
 Brenda G | January 19, 2011 at 2:26 pm | 
I get the coffee prepared the night before, put the dogfood in the dog bowl and place it where it can’t be reached, put all our clothes out in the bathroom and put the toothbrush and paste on the counter. I pack my lunch from dinner leftover the night before so it’s ready to pull from the fridge.
 Margo | January 19, 2011 at 2:27 pm | 
To help us with a stress free morning, we take showers the night before. We lay out all our clothes, pack the kids back packs and set out snack and lunch money if needed. We pack lunches and snacks if it’s one of those days. Set out coffee cups and sugar. Have anything needed for the day next to the door. We make time for small talk with everyone to make our day better! We have a Keurig coffee pot already, but would love to have one with a timer, so my coffee is ready for me, so I may have more time with my children and puppy. I would transfer the one I have to my husbands work so they could enjoy Keurig made coffee there as well. Please consider my comment, I would love to win this for my family. Thank you!!!
 janice loback | January 19, 2011 at 2:27 pm | 
The night before you get everything ready that you will need, clothes you will be wearing, homework, stuff for the office and anything else that you or your family will need. The most important first thing in the morning is that awesome cup of coffee just for you to give you the awe feeling I can handle anything today and the rest of the day will go by stress free. A whole lot better then everyone running around in 100 different directions in the morning and your day starts out stressed out yikes,,,, not good!!!
 Silvia Lahay | January 19, 2011 at 2:27 pm | 
I have taught my kids since they started school to lay out their close the night before, this makes it a lot easier for the morning. Also, my son always takes his shower in the evening before bed and my daughter in the morning. No fighting over the shower this way in the morning. I also do all my prep the night before so in the morning it will be ready to go. I always fix a good healthy breakfast for the kids. So If, I’m making crepes I will do as much as possible the night before and be ready for the morning. I have a the coffee machine ready to go first thing in the morning for my husband and I. But I think the most important thing that I do for my family is to plan ahead for the week so I know what I will be making for the kids. I have always cook a good healthy meal for them and they love it. They are great breakfast eaters, to the point that sugary cereals are not something they go for. But that first cup of coffee for hubby and I just get’s us started in the morning.
 Maura McNulty | January 19, 2011 at 2:27 pm | 
With 4 kids I have learned to do alot the night before! Take a shower, give bathes, make sure breakfasts and lunches are ready to go. I also try to wake up first so I can get the dog out and walked before and hopefully my tea water boiled before the mayhem begins!
 Terri Metcalf | January 19, 2011 at 2:28 pm | 
Forget laying out the clothes for the kids. Just bathe them and put them in comfortable clothes to sleep in. Then there’s no fight over getting dressed in the morning. Also, do as much other preparation as possible the night before. Then the alarm can be set a little later. Doesn’t everyone love to get at least 10 more minutes??
 Janetta Ellis | January 19, 2011 at 2:28 pm | 
My best tip for the morning with small kids:

On Sundays I let my child take 5 snack size baggies and have him fill them with what he would like for breakfast: cereal, poptarts, yogurts, oatmeal, picture of eggs.. whatever he wants. Then in the morning when he wakes up, he puts what he wants on the counter and while he is dressing, I get his breakfast ready. This way I am not trying to figure out what he wants, making sure he is getting dressed, the baby dressed and fed and then me getting ready. Whatever he eats for breakfast his brother does as well. This allows me those sane moments and keeps them from tearing up the house!
 Julie | January 19, 2011 at 2:28 pm |

To make the morning easier we try to have everything laid out (clothes), or packed (backpack) before bed on school nights.

On the weekend we make mornings easier by having some quick easy breakfast munchies available for the kids so we can sleep in 
 m | January 19, 2011 at 2:29 pm | 
my best things is getting ds lunch ready for him right when he gets home from school the day before. being that way we get it done. Being 3 days out of the week we are book with things. NOthing like getting 1 thing else to worry about each day. Getting up in the morning with out feeling tired thats also the extra benefit when I go to bed when he does. I set his alarm clock but never seem to need it being I wake up with CAT earlier and kick her out 2 hrs ahead of it but go back to bed then he wakes up on time w/o the alarm going off most days. Then I get up get him moving breakfast. Which nice hot cup of hot cocoa or apple cider would be nice in the morning would be nice already.
 April B | January 19, 2011 at 2:30 pm | 
It’s always best to plan the night before to ensure a smooth morning! Pick out clothes, pack lunches, lay out coats and all those winter accessories, plan breakfast, prep backpacks, set the table….whatever you can do ahead of time, do it! It makes the mornings less hurried and stressful if you are prepared AND if something does go wrong in the morning, you have time to deal with it! For moms, if you can get up before the kids and get ready first, you’ll feel more prepared to face the day. I know I always feel better when I have my hair and teeth brushed!
 Allison | January 19, 2011 at 2:30 pm | 
I am a stay-at-home mom to a 2 year old little girl. We often have morning functions to go to and need to get our the door quick. I do anything and everything I can the night before to get us and my husband out the door on time. I put out a cereal bowl, spoon, and my husbands vitamin on the counter. I go ahead and fill my daughter’s sippy cup with milk and put it in the fridge and pull a muffin out of the freezer for her. I lay out our clothes along with shoes, socks, hairbows for her and my jewelry. I also go ahead and lay out any dry ingredients that I will need for that night’s dinner…..rice, canned goods, seasonings, etc. That way when we are home from our errands, I already know what to make for dinner and have the ingredients out and ready! This mom would love a Keurig to keep me going on my busy morning track! =)
 Lisa M | January 19, 2011 at 2:30 pm | 
Im a SAHM with 2 small kiddos and one on the way! I make sure my decaf coffee is ready to brew and the kiddos breakfast is ready to pull out of fridge and ready to heat or eat and sippy cups are full of milk! Lots of hugs and cuddling also is a must most mornings!
 Sandi Murray | January 19, 2011 at 2:31 pm | 
Take everything you can to the car the night before. After baby is in bed, take the diaper bag, snack, juice cup, change of clothes, etc. out to the car so that all you have to grab on your way out the door is your purse. I try to keep an extra set of clothes, diapers, and wipes in my car at all times just in case.
 Tara Pandey | January 19, 2011 at 2:31 pm | 
My best tip to save time in the morning is to get everything ready at night related to the things I do every morning. Whenever we (me and my wife) plan to go out for longer time in the next morning, we get our bags, snacks, clothes, tickets and purse/handbags ready. Even we try to get the breakfast half ready so that don’t have much work to do. It really helps in next morning and saves a lot of time. Not to forget going to bed on time to have a nice sleep to feel fresh next day.

There’s no way I can even go to bed before making a pot of coffee to be ready to start int he morning. When the alarm goes off…I’m up, the first thing I do is start the coffee…do my usual prepping/getting dressed, then set down w/my hot cup of coffee to watch the news to start my day. While I’m doing that…my fruit/yogurt is working out in my blender…and minutes later…my smoothie is ready. My husband is up and out the door in 5 minutes…NOT ME..I have to have an hour to“wake up”….and prepare myself for the big day ahead. It’s a tradition that has taken me time to perfect..but if I gotta go…it’s gotta be done.
 Mary | January 19, 2011 at 2:31 pm | 
To save time and stress, I get up when I wake up. No use going back to sleep.
 Aimee Tillett | January 19, 2011 at 2:32 pm |

 Kela Reece | January 19, 2011 at 2:32 pm | 
…hmmm, do as much as possible before I go to bed the night before….not a morning person and the less I have to do in the morning the better!!!
 Marcie | January 19, 2011 at 2:32 pm | 
I lay out each child’s outfit the night before and make sure all lunches are packed and in the fridge. I also set the table for breakfast and keep a spare box of granola bars in the car just in case we are late to rise. Most importantly, I set the coffee maker timer to make sure I am well caffeinated to handle the routine!
 kathy mcclaskey | January 19, 2011 at 2:32 pm | 
I always try to get everything ready the night before. Setting out clothes and getting breakfast planned for the next day for my 5 year old.
 Selina Hill | January 19, 2011 at 2:32 pm | 
Getting ready the night before is essential. We make coffee the night before and make sure the timer is set properly, lay out the next day clothes, make lunches, sign and get backpacks ready, and I also check my gas gauge before getting home to make sure I have enough gas to get to and from work considering gas is cheaper near home than work. The kids also bath at night to save time in the morning. Now if only their hair would stay tangle free.
 Julie Tazzia | January 19, 2011 at 2:32 pm | 
The night before I mentally plan exactly what I will pack in everyone’s lunch. Then when the alarm goes off, I don’t have to think about it. I can drink my morning coffee while mindlessly assembling lunch and listening to the morning news. Then I’m ready to attack the day.

 Dawn McKenzie | January 19, 2011 at 2:32 pm | 
I hung a fabric shoe holder in my daughter’s closet from the clothes rod. On the weekend, I filled it with 6 outfits for each of the children, socks, and underwear. I placed a few extra undies and socks in one cubby and one outfit that was NOT in season in a cubby as well. Each morning, I got up late, rushed to get myself ready, then went into their room and calmly grabbed a set of clothes. If is was an odd weather day, I simply grabbed the off-season outfit and we were out the door in minutes! Now if I could just remember to set out my clothes the night before, we would be ALL set!
 Melissa Swaldo | January 19, 2011 at 2:32 pm | 
I have everything ready the night before&amp;stick to the same routine every morning! Being prepared keeps my boys on task&amp;teaches them a valuable life lesson. A Keurig with a fresh hot beverage would definitely be a wonderful cure for my morning chaos!

Shower at night and set clothes and school stuff out all together with shoes and coat. Kids eat lunch at school to avoid the packup hassle. Have a check list when needed to remember important items. Have a cat instead of a dog, he does not need to walk. Work at home in the afternoons so i can go back to bed…really need this because I don’t have a Keurig.lol
 Lori Paschal | January 19, 2011 at 2:33 pm | 
I have a full time job and attend school 2 nights a week and on Saturday mornings. I try to plan my meals for the week during the weekend—pack lunch meat and condiments or PB&amp;J for a couple of sandwiches, chop vegetables for salads, portion out snacks,etc.—which frees up time on weeknights for studying and time with my family. It also makes it quick and easy to pack things the night before, and everything is grab-and-go from one particular spot in the fridge in the morning. Like others have said, I also choose my outfit before bed. Having everything organized and ready to go makes it easier to fall asleep, too.
 Alicia | January 19, 2011 at 2:33 pm | 
I prepare healthy breakfasts once a week to freeze or have on hand for the mornings during the week. I also get up an hour before my kiddos to pack lunches and get a head start on the day, before I get them up and ready
for the day!
 Tracy | January 19, 2011 at 2:33 pm | 
I pull out all the clothes the night before, everyone wakes up to their own alarm clocks and make their own beds, we meet in the kitchen for a quick breakfast before brushing teeth and getting out the door. I make sure all homework is signed, done, and backpack is packed and waiting at the door the night before. I also pack snacks or have them in the front of the fridge the night before. Most days my son buys lunch but if not, I prepack what I can the night before. My mornings are pretty stress free pending morning crankiness.
 Vanessa Brophy | January 19, 2011 at 2:33 pm | 
I am always in a hurry getting ready in the mornings. So I prepare my coffee maker the night before and in the morning all I need to is push the button.
 Jamie Stanley | January 19, 2011 at 2:34 pm | 
I have everything set out and ready for when I wake up…I also make check list every night for the next day so I do not forget anything. I am a 23 year old mother of two with one on the way! It does not sound like much but it really helps me save time in the mornings.
 Ann | January 19, 2011 at 2:34 pm | 
I sleep in my workout clothes so I save time in the morning and ensure I get my daily exercise. That way, I don’t make excuses or end up stumbling around my room getting dressed in the dark trying not to wake up my husband!
 Scott Carroll | January 19, 2011 at 2:35 pm | 
To get everyone moving in the morning we work a system of staggered get ups. Being a stay at home Dad, I run the show in the mornings. My wife is the first one up and to the shower. I then make sure her coffee is ready and sometimes serve her special treats for breakfast. I also start her car and clean off any snow. I then get the 12 year old daughter up and moving. As mom is coming out of bathroom she gets to go in and start getting ready for her day. The seventeen year old son is next, he has a private bath and gets into shower as I am keeping daughter on task. Once older son is almost done, I begin to wake up the littlest one, my seven year old son. All the while maintaining a semblance of sanity and trying to keep everyone on track to get them on their way at appropriate times. If anyone needs a special lunch for the day it is packed and ready to go, as well as book bags being ready and loaded with library books, gym shoes etc. The Keurig would become a welcome addition to this family and starting our day. Thanks for a chance!
 Marlo R | January 19, 2011 at 2:35 pm | 
To make the mornings run smoothly, I put the girls’clothes in the dryer to make them nice and warm for them. They know the quicker they get dressed, the longer they can enjoy the warmth from the clothes! And, of course, already a fan on FB!
 tomi jones | January 19, 2011 at 2:35 pm | 
Prepacking lunches the night before….getting coats,shoes,mittens…etc near the front door—-homework finished&amp;in backpacks put into car—coffeepot readied&amp;set to perk 15 minutes before alarm sounds is an ABSOLUTE MUST!!! =)
 Heather | January 19, 2011 at 2:35 pm | 
I have a schedule for everyone….we only have one bathroom and 4 people getting ready…everyone gets a half hour in the bathroom….the kids clothes are ironed and put in their bedroom…when you are done in the bathroom you announce it to the next person……..doors are never locked invade someone needs back in for something…..bags and coats are staged the night before for take off…..the kids eat breakfast at school so I don’t have to worry about that.
 Susan Johnson | January 19, 2011 at 2:35 pm | 
Well, like the 100′s here, preparation is key the night before. I make coffee to go off at 5:50. My husband gets out high schooler up as he has Aspbergers, he responds better to dad. I think that is a great stress reliever (for me!), so for dad, I have his coffee ready. We have to remind our son his whole routine, even though he has done it since preschool, we will have things taped to the mirror to help him remember his routine, his meds in a cup the night before. And we set an egg timer to help him time his individual things, though it does not always work, We are trying to teach him to be more self sufficient and quite frankly, I feel it is a losing battle; the two steps forward 3 steps back applies to my son in every way. I get up before he goes to school as he has to get a hug from me every morning. Then we have 40 minutes before I start on out second son in middle school, who is much easier and more self sufficient, but a teenager who likes to sleep in. Bed times are consistent as much as I can get them. They both like to push the boundaries! 
 Susan | January 19, 2011 at 2:36 pm | 
We could not and would not get through the morning without TEAMWORK! Every kid has a morning job to do make sure we are all on time and stress free. In addition, my husband and I have a great routine where I help the kids get dressed and ready while he makes breakfast. Then I pack lunches while he and the kids eat. After they are all out the door, I can take a deep breath and slow down for a few minutes to eat my breakfast before I am off to my destination!
 Julie | January 19, 2011 at 2:36 pm | 
I try to have everything ready the night before. Kids clothes picked out and lunches packed. I try to make mornings smooth running to get everyone out the door on time.
 Tanya Friesen | January 19, 2011 at 2:36 pm | 
The evening before. Set out the table for breakfast in the morning. Also set out everyone’s clothes for in the morning. If you are needing to pack anyone’s lunch prepare it all the night before. Than in the morning everything will move a lot faster and smoothly.
 susitravl | January 19, 2011 at 2:36 pm | 
After the chaos of trying to get my“not-morning people”family up, fed and out the door with everything they needed for the day, I would sit in the car digging in my purse for the keys, on the verge of tears.

Now, the last thing I do before I head up to bed at night is lay my keys on the counter, next to my purse.

I still struggle with getting everyone to school and work on time and fully dressed–LOL–but with one less problem now.
 Diana | January 19, 2011 at 2:37 pm | 
Doing as much as I can the night before so mornings are a little more relaxed! Make lunch, decide what to wear&amp;put it out along with going to bed early enough to wake up refreshed but not so early that I can’t sleep!!
 Cristin Galperin | January 19, 2011 at 2:37 pm | 
My biggest time saver for the morning is to get breakfast ready the night before. It saves so much time when you can scramble some eggs with ham and cheese in a microwave container the night before. In the morning put the container in the microwave for about a minute and you have instant scrambled eggs!
 Linda Childers | January 19, 2011 at 2:37 pm | 
My time saver is up at 5:45 am. Get hubby up, make coffee, and get in the shower. When done in the shower our coffee is ready to enjoy while we are getting ready for work. This routine works every time :O)
 Lauren | January 19, 2011 at 2:37 pm | 
Luckily, I am a morning person! However, my husband, daughter, and 3-step children are NOT morning people!! After MANY, MANY morning fights and fusses over clothing, shoes, hair accessories, jackets, etc, I learned my lesson. I enlist the help of all the kiddos the night before. It started with just the kids approving their outfits (from socks and undies, all the way down to the pony-tail holder&amp;hair accessory!!) and now it has turned into a whole family affair! The kids thought it was un-fair that they had to lay all their stuff out the night before and the parents didn’t, so now right before bed our living room looks like a dressing room!! Every one has thier spot where the next day’s outfit and accessories go with baskets/hooks/labels/etc for all PRE-APPROVED items for the next morning! I get up and drink about 3 cups of coffee while I’m getting ready before I even attempt to wake anyone else up After I am ready, we are usually out the door in less than 30 minutes from the time I start waking kiddos up. Oh and breakfast in the car is a must :)
 Lisa | January 19, 2011 at 2:38 pm | 
I keep my morning stress free by always getting dressed, putting on shoes and making my bed. It’s so easy to lounge around and then have to rush later when I don’t get dressed right away. It inspires me to get going. It may not sound like a time saver but it truly is when you consider how easy it is to lose track of time when you are sipping your coffee in your jammies.
 Dawn H | January 19, 2011 at 2:38 pm | 
The easiest way to make the morning routine easy is to have everything ready the night before! After dinner and dishes are all set, our family makes our own lunches together, make sure our clothes are picked out and backpacks/brief cases are all set for the next day. So in the morning we can get up, have breakfast and go =) It eliminates the searching and“What am I wearing today?”It works for our family! =)
 Judie Bouldry | January 19, 2011 at 2:38 pm | 
I start my morning by getting up an hour before everyone else does to get“me”time in. I read, drink my coffee and catch up with friends on facebook and email and then I wake everyone with a kiss good morning and by telling them that I love them….can’t go wrong from there 
 Johnna Anesi | January 19, 2011 at 2:38 pm | 
I get everything ready the night before…EVERYTHING! This includes setting the coffeemaker, getting our clothes&amp;the kids clothes sat out, making sure shoes are by the door,&amp;bags are actually in the car (because those can be forgotten even if they’re by the door), the dog treat is out so that I just have to grab it when put her in her crate, the kids get baths the night before,&amp;for breakfast I get the dishes, cups,&amp;eating utensils out whether it’s just cold cereal or homemade waffles (the batter is made the night before obviously), lunches are made the night before, and whatever else you can think of…all done the night before…EVERYTHING the night before is the key to having a time saving AND stress-free morning.
 Paula | January 19, 2011 at 2:39 pm | 
I have an 18 month old and im due any day with another so i need to keep a schedule and coffee helps me do that! Its the only caffeine i allow myself so i need it to brew fast!!!!
 Lisa F | January 19, 2011 at 2:39 pm | 
I lay out my clothes and I let my kids pick out their outfits the night before. They enjoy picking out their own clothes and then they are eager to get dressed in the morning.
I make sure their backpacks are all set with what they need the night before as well.
I keep a family calendar and a small day planner to look at , so that I don’t forget special events, birthdays, etc. If there are any errands I need to do that day, I leave a shopping list and a to-do list on the counter. By the front door I leave a cute basket-style tote that I fill, so I’m ready for my errands that day. I may fill it beforehand with library books to return, any items I may need to return to a store along with the sales-slips, coupons, or store flyers, even b-day cards to be sent.
This way, I’m not caught without the things I need. Sometimes, to save on gas, I try to plan out my route, so that all my errands are in the same area to maximize time and gas.

I almost forgot, the most important thing is to have the coffeemaker programmed and ready to go for when you wake up. There’s no better way to start the day!
 kathleen yohanna | January 19, 2011 at 2:39 pm | 
I have no tips. My mornings are crazy. I enjoyed reading all the posts and now I have some good ideas that I intend to put into practice. Backpacks should be packed the night before and lunches ready also. Thanks to all for the good ideas.
 Danielle McCann | January 19, 2011 at 2:40 pm | 
I like all these other people, get as much ready the night before. I would love a new coffee pot to help me get ready for the day. My mom has this coffee pot and she loves it.
 Maria B | January 19, 2011 at 2:40 pm | 
I pack the kids lunches the night before, have backpacks by the front door, lay clothes out the night before, and set the coffee pot timer. Makes for a‘less’stressful morning:)
 nancy sukup | January 19, 2011 at 2:40 pm | 
the best morning time saver i have is preparing my coffee the nite before. alli have to do is flip the switch and i’m on my way.
 Julie Conner | January 19, 2011 at 2:41 pm | 
I try to lay everything out the night before to be as prepared as I can be. I keep everything as routine as possible so everyone knows what they need to do. The problem I have is I don’t always do things for myself because I worry about everyone else. I know it is not creative but it is a true life situation.
 Tara McCarl | January 19, 2011 at 2:41 pm | 
My time saving tip in the morning is to get things ready the night before. Work clothes laid out with shoes, purse and keys by the door, AND travel mug by the Keurig. 
 Theresa | January 19, 2011 at 2:41 pm | 
Since I have three kids 5 and under I keep to a schedule to make my mornings run better. I also keep in mind what time I want everyone to be ready to go out the door and make that time about half and hour before I need to be somewhere, so I have some flexibility with getting everyone where they need to be. (I already liked All You on Facebook)
 Sarin Parkins | January 19, 2011 at 2:42 pm | 
My biggest morning hurdle is keeping my 2 year old occupied while I am getting my 10 year old and husband out the door. I set a different toy on the coffee table after I put her to bed each night so every morning, she looks forward to the“new toy”I set out on the table. Sometimes it’s a baby doll with play food or perhaps a coloring book with crayons. I set her juice and a small dish of cereal with the play items and she is set while the chaos occurs around her!
 Andrea Nedley | January 19, 2011 at 2:42 pm | 
I start planning my week on the weekend. I will place clothes together for the week with a few extras put together for changes in the weather of snow or rain. So I will put the pants, shirt, undergarments and socks all together for myself and my husband. At dinner time when putting away all the leftovers I will make ahead several lunches for the week label and freeze them. Small fruits and vegetables for snacking are put into small serving containers that are completed when coming home from the grocery store. Then the nightly routine of getting a ready made grouping of clothes set out making things so easy for the morning. Get up…dress (showered the night before), grab the lunch bag and put in the containers from the fridge. Hook up the dog, put lunch and purse in the car and start it. Enjoy walking my little dog Bella in the peaceful quiet of a new morning. That is a grand total of 30 short minutes. Then, hop in the car and off to work. My personal Mini Keurig is there and waiting for my first fresh cup of the day. Ahh….now the day is ready to begin.
 John K | January 19, 2011 at 2:43 pm | 
Best advice is to think ahead. I hope I win the coffee maker.
 Claudia Thomas | January 19, 2011 at 2:43 pm | 
Lots of great advice already.

Well lets see :

I have a 12-month old daughter and luckily I can stay at home w/ her. However we are a Military family and my husband has to work long shifts sometimes.

In order for us to get breakfast on the table, we sit down once a week and plan our meals. Some you can prepare the night before, put it in the fridge and just get it back out in the morning and fix it.. cook it or bake it. Breakfast casseroles are one of the great dishes!

Also, don’t rush and stress out that early in the morning, it’s not good for your health 

Try waking up a few minutes earlier that you have to, enjoy the quiet before the kids and hubby wake up, have a few minutes to yourself before the“chaos”begins, read your daily newspaper and enjoy a delicious cup of coffee made by the great Keurig coffe maker, of course 

Have a great day everyone xoxo

To make my mornings a bit easier to get my girls off to school and me off to work is to have my girls pick out their clothes the night before, and have lunches packed the night before. This eliminates any arguing about clothes and saves some time for unexpected occurences. I also get up and get a shower before my kids are up so I can give them my time and attention before putting them on the bus!! Having a Kuerig would make things even easier than brewing a cup of coffee also!!
 Renee | January 19, 2011 at 2:43 pm | 
The night before I do as much as I can to organize for the next morning. Backpacks, library books, sticky note reminders on the door and of course, program the coffee pot to be ready when I am! I am grouchy otherwise. Most importantly, even in a state of semi-organized chaos to get out the door, I remind myself to not speak harsh words to my hubby or kids because no one needs to part ways like that! Oh and never, ever forget the travel mug!
 Kathleen TImmermeyer | January 19, 2011 at 2:43 pm | 
Lay clothes out the night before helps in the morning rush. Lunches are made the night before. I am the only coffee drinker in the house and currently make a pot of coffee and drink it in a couple of days using the microwave to warm the cup of coffee up.
 Patti | January 19, 2011 at 2:43 pm | 
I do follow“All You”on FB. I have always prepared the night before, that includes setting the coffeepot. There is nothing more refreshing and sense awakening than the smell of coffee brewing thoughout the house. While I am having my coffee, I place a small saucer on top of the coffeepot to warm food for the cat. I used to put it in the microwave, but now I let my pot warm it up. This also works for bagels, muffins and any type of breakfast bar. Place item in foil or on saucer ahead of time. When the coffee is done there is enough heat on top of the pot to warm several items. Quick and saves $$ at the same time. No more microwave. This is an awesome offer. Sure hope it’s me.

We make our sandwiches for work a week ahead of time and take them out of the freezer when it is time for work.

Have an emergency plan and take advantage of your husband’s morning time! I suggest keeping $2 or $3 dollars strategically placed in case of emergencies: glove compartment of the car, unused zippered portion of a child’s back pack, etc. Its great for when you oversleep; forgot the lunchbox by the door; noticed too late that gas is on E and you also forgot your check card! This has avoided some disastrous mornings. My husband helps because he is a Marine and has to get up for work earlier. He double checks on anything I had to get done the night before and he always gives an extra ten minute cushion to try and get anything crossed off my to do list…like take out the dog and feed him, make sure the coffee is brewed, change my toddler’s diaper while he is still asleep. He also makes sure my alarm is set and updates me by sending me a text on what he did. Team work and careful precautions mean time management and efficiency!
 Becky Richardson | January 19, 2011 at 2:45 pm | 
Well unlike most of these ideas/comments, I do not have kids but I do have a hubby (Mike) who acts like one when it comes time to get up for work in the morning – he loves the snooze button! We carpool since our commute is about 35 miles into work–saves us TONS of money, but it also means we need to be in sync with being ready to leave by 6:55 on the dot each day. We fool each other by setting each other’s alarm clock earlier than what it really is (we don’t tell each other because that would ruin it) but that way we both can snooze a couple times and relax a little bit and turn on the news which gives us both the real time as well as keeps us updated on traffic. While I shower first, Mike goes down and makes us a breakfast sandwich for the road and gets lunches together. By this time, I’m done in the shower and Mike goes in and we can time it out so that we’re both fresh ‘n clean, dressed and ready to go to work at the same time. Don’t laugh, but I always know what I’m going to wear each day because I have pants that go for each day of the week – Monday is black, Tuesday is brown, etc. and as for a tops, I keep them in order in my closet and go for the next one that matches my pants. It works, try it out! There of course have been times where I’ve resulted to brushing our teeth in the shower, leaving with damp hair or only one earring put in so it’s not always perfect, but it works for us! Mike is C-L-U-E-L-E-S-S when it comes to making coffee so I usually have to wait out until I get to work to have a cup (am I the only one who cannot for the life of me figure out the programming button on my coffee maker?! Yes, I’ve woken to cold coffee that was somehow made at 1 AM, but I digress), but I think a Keurig is something that would be so convenient (and he can’t mess up!) Why I haven’t bought one yet is beyond me! But, timing is everything for us in the morning–I am a receptionist and need to be in by 8am, I’ve definitely got it down to a science.
 Erin Pizzimenti | January 19, 2011 at 2:45 pm | 
Having a Keurig brewer is the first step to saving time in your morning as you can eliminate the stop to your local coffee shop!!! With so many blends/flavors to choose from, everyone in your home is sure to find a blend (or 3) they love…oh&amp;hot chocolate for the kids–GENIOUS!!!

I, like many others, prep the night before…tubs for the kids, clothes laid out, backpacks packed. I find eliminating the“clutter”in the area time is spent in the morning also helps reduce time spent looking for keys, homework etc… 

Following the same routine every morning is also important with kids…this way everyone knows what the expectations are&amp;there is less confusion/drama!

YAY for Keurig!!!
 Sherry | January 19, 2011 at 2:45 pm | 
I lay out the kids backpacks with their coats by the door the night before. I also put my purse&amp;coat by the door. This way everything is ready for the mad dash out the door.
 Patricia | January 19, 2011 at 2:46 pm | 
Have clothes picked out before going to bed. Make sure backpacks have everything needed inside the night before and place near the door so you can quickly grab tehm on teh way out.
 Clare Perkowski | January 19, 2011 at 2:46 pm | 
I’m a diabetic so I have to eat first thing when I wake up. My routine is to set up my Keurig the night before and set up my bowl of oatmeal and the fruit next to it. When I get up I just have to turn on the coffee, pour water in the oatmeal and microwave it and then I’m good to go. Takes me about two minutes to fix breakfast. I don’t think anyone can do better than that and it works well for me.
 Jennifer | January 19, 2011 at 2:46 pm | 
I already“Like”All You on Facebook!
 Becky Heim | January 19, 2011 at 2:46 pm | 
I set my coffee pots timer to start right before I get up so its ready to go in the morning. I also make steel cut oatmeal in the crockpot. It cooks all night and is ready in the morning.
 Miranda Althoff | January 19, 2011 at 2:46 pm | 
The best way to save time in the morning is I try to get everything ready the night before. Kids pick their clothes out, they tell me what they want for breakfast and packed in their lunch. Then I go ahead make stuff that can be made ahead time for their lunch and pack it in their boxes and put them in the fridge. Coats, shoes, socks, clothes, and backpacks are all in the closet lined up, so as soon as the kids eat they can go to the hall closet and grab their clothes and such. Plus I even get my clothes out to make sure when it is time to get the kids off to school all of us are ready and make sure I grab my cup of coffee or I can not function with out.
 Grace | January 19, 2011 at 2:46 pm | 
I make all decisions before I go to bed, what I am wearing, make lunches, etc. This way all we have to think about in the morning is getting to school and work! It’s too early to think!
 Tracie G | January 19, 2011 at 2:47 pm | 
Mornings made easier–talk with the kid(s) the evening before to kind of give them a‘preview’of what’s coming up the next day. ALWAYS pick out clothes the night before and always, ALWAYS get up with the alarm!
 MB | January 19, 2011 at 2:47 pm | 
I give my twins baths at night, then have each pick out their clothes–that way there is no fighting! Then I let them pick out a breakfast item and lunch items for the following day. In the morning, all the kids require is a change of clothes and brush of the hair. All I require is a strong cup of coffee!
 Paula Bower | January 19, 2011 at 2:47 pm | 
Everybody has a routine in my house. Baths are taken the night before, so in the morning I get the kids up, they get dressed, eat their breakfast, brush their teeth and hair and they are ready and out the door. Then I have a cup of coffee or tea and relax with me time, before I have to get ready for work.
 janet | January 19, 2011 at 2:47 pm | 
On the weekends i sped time making breakfast for the week for my husband who gets up @ 3:30 every day. I make pancakes,sausage,egg,cheese,on English muffin’s (egg mc muffin),french toast sticks,wraps of egg,cheese and veggies. I wrap all separately,and mark them so he only has to grab,microwave and go.We don’t have a Keurig, so I set the times for it to go off so he has his hot coffee. he drinks his first cup and takes the rest in a to go mug,leaving me to get up and make my own,sometimes he has time to make the coffee so it will be ready when I get up,he liked Colombian,and strong, I like decafe and med. Having a Keurig would make our coffee time so much more enjoyable
 wendy | January 19, 2011 at 2:47 pm | 
to save time in the morning I wash my hair at night and don’t dry it. I have very thick, curly hair and I used to wash and dry it in the morning and it would take me about 45 minutes and cause my hair to get dry and frizzy. Now at night, after washing it, I put it in a bun and go to sleep. In the morning it is a bit damp and my curls are just right, not frizzy from any blow drying.
 Gillian Mobey | January 19, 2011 at 2:47 pm | 
1) I keep the Alarm out of reach so that I have to get up to stop it and cannot just keep hitting the snooze button

2) The night before, plan what you need for the next day and set everything out so that there is no scramble to find anything in the morning

3) Program your coffee machine so that there is coffee waiting for you in the morning.
 melinda spence | January 19, 2011 at 2:48 pm | 
Wow! Reading some of the posts, I’m slightly jealous!! (If my husband started my car in the morning, I’d probably wonder when he bumped his head! LOL- he’s a good guy but….ok so stick to the subject….
In order to make my morning run smoothly, and adequately caffinated, I pre make coffee and freeze some of into ice cubes. My left over coffee is placed in the refrigerator because some days I like it hot and some days I do not. (haha that rhymes) ok so….then I grab a breakfast cereal bar or it’s just the coffee and off I go. I have a 45 minute drink to work bright and early, If I should forget to pre make my coffee(or the husband decides to drink all my coffee,,,,boo) then I will“cheat”(not on the wonderful loving husband) but on my home coffee and hit the local fast food restaurant for a small $1.00 coffee and it’s off to work I go. I’m a bit of a“coffee snob”though and I much rather have my favorite coffee brand from home. Im like a kid with a favorite blanket that way….Good Luck to all! This Keuring Coffee maker is amazing! I’ve been blessed to have a cup or two from a family members house and I’ve wanted one ever since!
 Stacia | January 19, 2011 at 2:48 pm | 
As many have mentioned, morning routines are MUCH easier when preparations are made the night before. Outfits, backpacks, snacks, etc. that are ready to go take so much stress away!
 Courtney | January 19, 2011 at 2:48 pm | 
The best trick I’ve employed to get the kid out of bed on time in the morning is to let that job go to the dogs. I’ve given my child the job of feeding the dog in the a.m. Dog slobber is enough to get any child out of bed and getting ready for the day!
 crystal pinson | January 19, 2011 at 2:49 pm | 
I make mine and my husbands lunch at the begining of the work week so I don’t have to make them everyday.
 Donna | January 19, 2011 at 2:49 pm | 
My tip for making mornings less stressful is to not stress. Seriously. Certainly planning ahead, completing tasks the night before, are important but every day brings the unexpected and unplanned. I’ve finally learned to“roll with the punches,”make sure I get the most important things done, and leave for work knowing whatever I forgot, will probably be waiting for me when I get home.
 Susie S. | January 19, 2011 at 2:50 pm | 
I am a stay at home Mom so I really don’t worry about having everything together b/c our son isn’t school age yet and my husband only works every 3rd day. I do however take care of my husband when he is going on shift with the fire dept. I do my best to get all of his food ready the night before so the next morning all I have to do is put it in his cooler. Then as he is walking out the door I ask him if he has each thing that he is supposed to carry b/c 9x’s out of 10 he will forget something, then being the nice wife that I am I take whatever he has forgotten up to the fire station.
 Gina | January 19, 2011 at 2:51 pm | 
I get up with my husband every day at 5:30 and I make him coffee and get his lunch ready. I know this may sound old-fashioned but it makes me get up earlier than normal and it keeps him happy. Then I rinse out my coffee pot to make hot water for tea for my 18 year old son and myself. The way I save time is just by getting up early. That way I have MORE time.
 Rebecca D. | January 19, 2011 at 2:51 pm | 
Trying to get out the door in a timely manner requires I get as much as possible completed, the night before. Braid daughters waist length hair the night before so I don’t have to tackle her in the am. This way she knows the knots in her hair will be minimal.

Next, everyone, including the hubs, needs to have everything picked out the night before. This means making there’s an alternate shirt for those days when the weatherman’s prediction was based on HI’s weather instead of the midwest.

Shoes are lined at the door, you know, do we can all pretend were firemen and see who can get them on the fastest.

Lunches for the family are made the night before and placed towards the front of the fridge. Nothing say’s,“we’re going to be late”, like sliding lunch bags out of the fridge, catching a gallon of milk and have the lid pop off.

Then there’s one of the most important and critical steps to insure everyone will get out on time and happy. The setting up of Mom’s coffee the night before. This means the favorite travel cup is next to the coffee maker with the lid off, ready to rock and roll.

Healthy muffins that were baked in advanced are pulled from the freezer. If everyone decides in the morning that their palates are not in the mood, there’s always my fail safe frozen blueberry waffles and homemade wheat, strawberry pancakes. All of which take a few seconds to get ready. Having a few options helps avoid chaos.

Next is the tooth-brushing, fun, fun, fun. We have a couple different toothbrushes to choose from for each child as well as different flavor paste. The night before when they’re done brushing, we have them pick out which one they’ll get to use in the morning. This helps get them excited about using the brush with the“cool”character.

Mom’s keys are attached to her purse the night before because she’s been known to lose them….right in front of her face. Purse is always in the window seat, missing purse equates to Mom loosing her mind. Not good.

Oh then there’s the dog. His food is scooped out and placed in a secret-to-him, hiding place. Playing drop and run with his food helps insure we don’t have any escapee issues while we’re trying to walk out.

Bottom line, make things a game or as fun as possible, have a ritual in order to avoid forgetting anything or mishaps that can make you late. Regardless, don’t stress. With my household, my stress equates to additional chaos with my kids, husband and dog acting up. 
 Melany | January 19, 2011 at 2:53 pm | 
ooh I almost forgot a great advice that should always be passed along: Avoid the“change the outfit”problems with children (and adults who cant seem to find a solution) in the morning by having only one or two outfits that was agreed on the night prior and then put a lock on the closet door! The rule is: it was good last night and nothing has changed drastically since you slept so it should be good in the morning! For me, I keep a one outfit rule. 
 Amy Coldwell | January 19, 2011 at 2:53 pm | 
I get myself completely ready for work and have the vehical running before I go get my son out of bed. He has down sydrome and there is no changing the way his morning starts. We play a game while I am getting him dressed then we stop and get him a sweet tea on our way to school. He has to have tea like mommy has to have her coffee. If you do one thing different he will just sat there and look at you until you start the way he has done now for 12 year.
 Joyce Rougeou | January 19, 2011 at 2:53 pm | 
Making my mornings easier is simple as this: PLAN AHEAD. I get things ready the night before, so things flow easily in the morning. Coffee pot is ready, as well as the travel mug. Just makes sense to me.
 Laura | January 19, 2011 at 2:53 pm | 
I have everything out the night before. Getting up when the alarm clock goes off helps too. 
 taya linville | January 19, 2011 at 2:54 pm | 
Get everything ready the night before, and get a good nights sleep!
 Jacki W. | January 19, 2011 at 2:55 pm | 
On the weekends I cook big breakfasts and will make extra pancakes or french toast in both the refrigerator and freezer so that there is always backup on the mornings where we’re in a time crunch. My daughter loves peanut butter french toast, so she never complains when I give her 2 pieces with peanut butter in between. They’re great for a grab and go breakfast!
 JOANN HOFFMAN | January 19, 2011 at 2:55 pm | 
I prepare the night before.My husband is diabetic so I measure his cheerios and put them in a covered bowl and measure the milk and put it in a container in the fridg. Have the coffee pot ready to go so all he has to do is dress and enjoy breakfast. I also pack his lunch so we can control his carb count. This makes less stress on him and easier to control his diabetis.
 shannon s. | January 19, 2011 at 2:55 pm | 
I am never never on time! I lay my clothes and my sons clothes out the night before and set the coffee maker to start so hopefully I can smell the coffee and it is basically like a“BACK UP”alarm clock!
 Jennifer | January 19, 2011 at 2:55 pm | 
Apart from getting clothes ready, laying everything out for the next day, putting dishes away, etc. we also prep for the morning. I plan ahead with what we’re going to eat and then sort of“set the table”for breakfast! That way, there’s no need for rushing or scrambling through the kitchen for a can opener, a knife, or scissors to open packets.
And this may be difficult, but I try to wake up 5-10 minutes before I have to, to give myself some quiet time–this way, I find it that everything tend to flow smoother and easier in the morning 
 Amy | January 19, 2011 at 2:57 pm | 
I try and make sure my son takes his shower at night so we don’t fight all morning!! I know it will be a bad morning if I have to get him up earlier for his shower.
 Deanne | January 19, 2011 at 2:57 pm | 
My tip for being organized and not rushed in the morning is to get it all together the night before. I have three children 12, 10 and 7. Outfits picked out, back packs by the door, coffee set up and ready to hit the“on’button. I pack their lunches in the morning though because they like fresh sandwiches that are not made the night before. (I can’t blame them!)
 Heather | January 19, 2011 at 2:57 pm | 
We make our mornings easier by sticking to a routine! My daughter has to wear uniforms to school, so picking out what to wear is super easy. On the days they get an out of uniform day we pick it out the night before and have it ironed and ready to go for the next morning. I wake my daughter up at 6:30 for breakfast, at 7 its time to get dressed and 7:15 its time to fix her hair (and this is actually our only decision making in the mornings!). Then I grab her snack out of the fridge and we’re out the door at 7:30. A routine makes it so much easier to make sure we’re always on time and not running around late! Of course it helps that I get come home and relax for a bit after I drop her off at school 
 Paula | January 19, 2011 at 2:58 pm | 
A big cup of coffee and anything I can do the night before–pack lunches, pick out clothes, book bags packed and ready, etc…. that helps the morning rush!!
 Leah Allen | January 19, 2011 at 2:58 pm | 
Unfortunately, I have an old coffee maker, so I have to put the coffee in the filter and fill up the coffee maker with water the night before. I take my showers the night before, and lay out my clothes for the next day. I shop for quick breakfasts–like already prepared egg mix or pancake mix. I also, prepare my lunch the night before. So, when I get up I turn on the coffee maker, get dressed, make the breakfast, eat and grab my lunch. Don’t forget to brush your teeth and hair and then you’re out the door.
 Jen D | January 19, 2011 at 3:00 pm | 
You’ve got to have everything in the same place so that you’re not looking for where things are. A place for everything and everything in its place. Have a set‘vitamin’station–I use a two-tiered lazy susan. If I’m down to a scrap of soap–I’ll go ahead and put out a fresh bar to swap it with the next day.
 Barbara | January 19, 2011 at 3:00 pm | 
Several things make for a stress free morning. Kids showered and backpack and clothes ready for a.m. Also, I rise 30 minutes earlier so my shower is done and I can assist those needing it. And patience, if I’m not stressed out, everyone else is much calmer,
 Kelli | January 19, 2011 at 3:00 pm | 
I like to have the kids organized the night before for a smooth morning. The Keurig seems i would make it easier with hot water already ready. I love my hot chocolate on cold mornings and so do the kids.
 Angela S | January 19, 2011 at 3:00 pm | 
Layout clothes the night before and iron them. Have a breakfast plan.
 Chantel | January 19, 2011 at 3:01 pm | 
I homeschool my 8 year old son and have a 9 month old baby, so my mornings can be a little hectic! I try to plan ahead as much as possible. I write down everything that needs done the next day while the kids are asleep. Then check things off my list as I get them done! I also try to plan meals out so the day goes much smoother.
 laurie dercole | January 19, 2011 at 3:02 pm | 
I would love this I am the biggest coffee drinker going. I get up at 0315 hrs to go to work and there is nothing like having to wait for the coffee pot to get done, Plus I have to set it up the night before, sorry but what a pain if you forget. I work 12hr shifts with a lot of over time, and want nothing more that another cup of coffee as soon as I walk into the house.If you can except my message I would love to win this to make my life a little no ALOT easier for me. Thank you for your time.
 Gayla | January 19, 2011 at 3:02 pm | 
All clothes for day care and work are laid out the night before, as well as all lunches packed and ready to grab! Making a large batch of muffins or pancakes on the weekend and freexing the extras makes it easy to get a good breakfast. A few seconds in the microwave and then a topping of berries makes the pancakes just delightful!
 Connie H | January 19, 2011 at 3:03 pm | 
My husband drinks coffee and sets it up the night before, as we do our clothes, our girls clothes etc. When I hear him turn the shower off I turn on his coffee maker (makes a travel mug full) and when he comes down stairs his coffee is ready as he takes our daughter to school. I stay home and get the other one on the bus. Lunches HAVE to be made the night before!
 Denise | January 19, 2011 at 3:03 pm | 
I like to go to bed with my sink clean, dishwasher running and coffee pot filled with water. That way when I get up, I can immediately have clean dishes to start fixing meals and get my coffee brewing.
 Jessica G | January 19, 2011 at 3:03 pm | 
I am not a morning person, so I do everything I can the night before. After the kids go to bed, I straighten up the house and plan for the next day. I use the timer on the breadmaker so bread is ready in the morning. I take meat of the freezer to thaw for the next day’s supper. The kids are old enough to get themselves ready and they have chore charts to help them remember exactly what they need to do so there are no excuses about forgetting. I buy cereal and other non-perishables in bulk so we don’t have a lot of problems with running out of food and household items. I also bake in bulk so we have muffins and cookies on hand. When we are taking a trip, I lay out outfits at night and have all bags packed and ready to go. Waterbottles are filled and in the fridge.
 Jackie | January 19, 2011 at 3:03 pm | 
I have four kids–one in high school, one in her last year of elementary, one in preschool, and my baby at home so mornings are ALWAYS crazy! I get plenty of healthy convenience items like granola bars and pre-cut fruit that the kids can grab on late days, and I try to plan as much as possible the night before…make sure all homework and permission slips are signed, choose outfits which I hang up as a full outfit rather than separately, the little ones get a bath at night since the older two like to shower in the morning, and I put a new filter and coffee in the coffeemaker so my hubby can have his breakfast…could sure save a lot of time if we had a Keurig!!
 REBECCA | January 19, 2011 at 3:04 pm | 
My husband makes the coffee in the morning and leaves before me, makes for a VERY smooth morning for me and the kids :p
 J. | January 19, 2011 at 3:05 pm | 
I fill the coffeemaker with fresh grounds, and have the water ready to go…just touch, and voila–it is ready to go and wake me up at a moment’s notice! I also find that cooking for my husband the night before, and leaving a breakfast wrapped up, speeds things up, when he has to leave at 5:45 am for work.
 Sara | January 19, 2011 at 3:06 pm | 
I always try to get things ready the night before including lunch, clothes and coffee.
 Kim | January 19, 2011 at 3:06 pm | 
My tip for the morning is to get everything out the night before. Plan breakfast and put the dishes out on the counter, get the kids clothes out and leave them on the dresser and have everything we need to walk out the door in one spot by the door.
 Angeli Ebeza | January 19, 2011 at 3:06 pm | 
I’m a college student, so getting out of the door by the time the bus comes is a MUST. So the night before I get everything I need for that day ready: clothes ironed and shoes picked out, lunch, etc. I even set up my coffee maker with the grounds and water so that the switch is ready to be flipped when I get up the next morning (unfortunately, it doesn’t have a timer). I set my bookbag by the door, beside the shoes I’ll wear the next day so that I’m not grabbing books and searching for shoes when I get up! I also shower the night before so that all I have to do in the morning is wash my face, brush my teeth and do my hair/make-up! I keep my iHome in my bathroom and listening to music in the morning really gets me moving fast! I give myself 3 or 4 songs to finish up in the bathroom so I can grab my lunch/coffee/books and head out!
 Angel Hunnell | January 19, 2011 at 3:06 pm | 
I do like everyone else and watch the weather and pick out clothes the night before, showers taken, breakfast planned and set out etc. But, 2 most importants things for me in the morning are DO NOT hit the snooze button and DO NOT turn on the TV until EVERYBODY is ready to go!!
 Alisa | January 19, 2011 at 3:07 pm | 
1) I plan ahead. I make a week’s worth of lunches on Sunday night for my son. I will plan on making meals during the week that my husband and I can take for leftovers. I always pack those the night before.

2) I write a list the night before of things I have to leave the house with the next morning.

3) I pack book bags and work bags the night before and put them in the car, since we have a garage.

4) I lay out clothes for my son and I the night before.

5) Communicate. My husband and I have a game plan for who has to do what (with the kids) in the mornings so no one is stressed. Who is feeling the kids? Who is dressing the kids? Who is waking up the kids?

6) Keep breakfast simple. Cereal, fruit, healthy bar, or smoothies make great breakfasts. If we are having a breakfast smoothie then I will make it the night before so all we have to do it grab it in the morning.

7) Coffee is a must for any working mom. I measure out my coffee, fill up the water tank and put in new coffee filter the night before so all I have to do it hit start in the morning.

I have my daughter pick out my outfit the night before and I pick out mine as well. We make batches of pancakes on Sunday for the week. I make the coffee when I come downstairs and I take the puppy out. When I come back in the coffee is ready and I watch a little tv with my daughter before giving her breakfast. Then I go get ready. A Keurig would be AWESOME!!!!
 Jayme Davis | January 19, 2011 at 3:08 pm | 
My routine is probably pretty similar to everyone elses…but being that there is hundreds of comments…I’m not reading thrugh them to find out 

I have a 7 year old, a 15 month old and I also watch a 4 month old 3 days a week…SO, a stress free morning is a must in my house! On the way up to bed, the kids and I make sure that all of their toys are put away, and my daughter’s back pack is packed (home work there, papers signed, reading log filled out, etc). Usually I even stay on track and lay out her clothes for school! AFTER they go to bed is when my prep for the next day begins. I come downstairs and put away any miscellaneous items, wipe down the counters, vaccuum up the hard floors, pack my duaghter’s lunch for school, set the coffee pot up to start brewing at 6:45 the next morning, and make sure that I have no ugly messes or clutter to face in the morning. I get up about 45 minutes before my first child does, so that I can take my time doing my hair/makeup/clothes, and even check my email(and facebook) in peace. If I don’t take the time to have myself up and ready then I’m just a grouch and feel sluggish all day.

Most importantly, all of my“night before and morning of”preperation is done in COMPLETE silence. Why?? Because I won’t get any of that until the kids go to bed again 
 Joanna | January 19, 2011 at 3:08 pm | 
I straighten up the house the night before and get my sons school clothes laid out so he can jump into in a flash. I set up the coffee to start brewing in the morning right before I wake up. Sometimes I skip the coffee and head out the door (as soon as he gets on the bus) and enjoy a cup of Keurig coffee at my mom and dads.
 Kristen | January 19, 2011 at 3:09 pm | 
We get things ready the night before and have all our pieces and parts ready to go, but my biggest morning change to eliminate stress was to sit down and plan out how long it REALLY takes to get through our morning routine. Once I did, I discovered that we all needed to get the ball rolling about 30 minutes earlier than we had been. Now, we have a realistic time frame to work with and all the stress is gone–in fact, we sometimes discover we have time to spare!
 Cindy | January 19, 2011 at 3:10 pm | 
The first thing I do every morning, rain or shine is throw open the drapes and shades to let the day in. Watching the sunrise as I sip a cup of coffee always inspires me to begin a new day.
 Aubrey M. | January 19, 2011 at 3:10 pm | 
I freeze my bottled water at night so that it can melt and stay cold all during the day.
 Lisa Appell | January 19, 2011 at 3:10 pm | 
I have to say that all the above has stressed me out!! I just have a morning routine, shower, dress, hair, makeup, breakfast with coffee, and devotional. If I do that in that order, it’s not stressful at all. Life is better when you don’t stress out. I’ve been saving my quarters for a Keurig, so it would be nice to win one. 
 Olga Gintchin | January 19, 2011 at 3:10 pm | 
We also put our keys in our lunch bag so we don’t forget our lunch!!!
 Robin | January 19, 2011 at 3:11 pm | 
Always having the house picked up before bed, gives me a stressfree morning. I love waking up to a clean house !!
 Leslie | January 19, 2011 at 3:12 pm | 
We do as much as possible the night before: showers, laying out clothes, preparing school bag, stocking diaper bag, fixing school lunch, etc. Of a morning, I do as much as possible before the kids wake up. Once they are up, I give quick and easy commands, and I start counting down to them the amount time before we need to leave. Mornings are always hard work but occassionally we have a few spare minutes to cuddle before running out the door.
 herminia maldonado | January 19, 2011 at 3:12 pm | 
I usually have my clothes,husband’s, baby’s clothes laid out the night before.I also do this with breakfast,I prep everything at night.I also prep my coffee the night before.This helps my family life run more efficiently in the morning.
 Jennifer | January 19, 2011 at 3:13 pm | 
Mornings are always chaotic, but I do what I can the night before to make them a little more bearable. First and foremost, my children are still young so we have bath time at night. Clothing is ready the night before; snacks and lunches are packed the night before.
I also wake up about 20-30 minutes before my children so that I have time to enjoy a cup of coffee and *wake up* before the craziness begins.
 Lisa | January 19, 2011 at 3:14 pm | 
Give everyone morning jobs making beds, cleaning bathroom sinks, feeding the pets and emptying the garbage cans. My son makes and packs his lunch and backpack the night before so there is no excuse to help out in the morning. With everyone chipping in, the morning goes smoothly and there is enough time for a second cup of steaming hot coffee from my Keurig!
 Angela Ogle | January 19, 2011 at 3:15 pm | 
The best thing I do to make mornings easier is to get as much ready the night before and to remember to set the alarm, lol
I unfortunately have to drink instant coffee as I don’t have a coffee maker so this would be a wonderful blessing to win!!
 Shana | January 19, 2011 at 3:15 pm | 
My time saving idea is neither original or creative. It is the oldest trick in the book but so overlooked in today’s world. I stay home. I KNOW…I told you it was unoriginal:). My husband and I decided that me staying home would be less chaos for everyone and that it would be worth every financial sacrifice we make. To continue with the less chaos plan we even decided to homeschool. I KNOW. Craziness:) Our morning routine is now spent over muffins and grammer lessons so this coffee pot would help me out TREMENDOUSLY:)!!!
 Melissa | January 19, 2011 at 3:16 pm | 
Keeping the tv is a must in our house. While it might not cut time, if my girls can be out the door more than 10 mins ahead of schedule, we get to go to Tim Horton’s where one gets a small hot chocolate and the other a small mocha. This tends to work wonders!!!
 LeAnne Samson | January 19, 2011 at 3:16 pm | 
#1) My five year old daughter has thick, curly hair to her waist (beautiful, but not so manageable). To save time (and tears) in the mornings, I apply a good dose of smoother/detangler and give it a good brushing just before bedtime. If I’m lucky and she doesn’t get something funky in it overnight, the next morning all she needs is a quick comb-through before we’re off to school.

#2) Similar to above: I style my own hair before bed, but leave out any styling product until morning. After breakfast all I need is a little touch-up and something to hold the style and I’m good to go!

#3) I homeschool my third grade son, so to make sure we’re off to a smooth start in the mornings I get his lessons ready the night before. That way he can get a little work done in the van as we take little sister to school and not a minute is wasted.
 Katie Heuer | January 19, 2011 at 3:16 pm | 
I wake up an hour before my kids, That way I can get a shower and relax with a hot cup of coffee before we have to get going. This really helps me, it seems like the day goes by much smoother if I have my morning“chill”time.
 alicia blake | January 19, 2011 at 3:18 pm | 
I’m already a fan of all you&amp;love the mag. the tips are great, and helps save money too with all the coupons…I refer it to everybody…lol. I tend to leave myself notes the night b4 just so I don’t forget anything. Something like this would definately keep me moving in the mornings!!!
 PK | January 19, 2011 at 3:18 pm | 
Of course, I already LIKE All You on Facebook!
 Mary Breeggemann | January 19, 2011 at 3:18 pm | 
I am a busy mom to 4! My husband works from 6am-4:30pm every day.. So before bed each night I make my oldest two pull out the clothes the night before, I make breakfast or have it ready to be made the night before, and the baby’s bottle is already made, refrigerated, and then just warmed in the morning so things seem to go a little smoother each morning.. With the babies only being 11 months apart things can get pretty crazy pretty fast!
*I already‘Liked’All You on FB months ago*
 dee smith | January 19, 2011 at 3:19 pm | 
I pack their lunches and lay out their clothes the night before. I also have them get their backpacks ready. The next morning, they are ready to eat, brush their hair and teeth, slide on their clothes and they’re out the door. I have terrific daughters. Their dad needs this coffeemaker before he puts us in the poor house because he keeps buying coffee by the cup at the local gas station!
 laurie dercole | January 19, 2011 at 3:19 pm | 
I get up at 0315 hrs to get ready for work and I am the biggest coffee drinker going. And nothing like waiting for the coffee pot to get done. Now I have to set it up the night before and thats a pain when I forget to do it when I get in late from overtime at work. I work 12 shifts and its crazy for me. I dont have anyone else getting up with me to do it either. And after a hard day at work I would love to just walk in change and have a cup of coffee from this machine. Thats HEAVEN to me. So please I really could use this and would make my day go faster so that I can enjoy the cup of coffee longer.
Again Thank you for this chance to have a wonderful cup or CUPS of coffee the better way.
 A Goldman | January 19, 2011 at 3:19 pm | 
I like to shower at night. Not only lets me sleep better, saves time in the morning. Also, hang clothes on hook outside closet at night so don’t have to choose in the morning.
 PK | January 19, 2011 at 3:19 pm | 
Maybe it’s not all that creative but a great morning time saver is using dry, spray-on shampoo. Saves the time of washing and drying your hair and really does the job of keeping the root area full and clean. Just be sure to brush all the“powdery”spray out! 
 Kim | January 19, 2011 at 3:21 pm | 
For our family wake-up…the easiest of days go as follows…Take out a muffin from tjhe freezer the night before..program the coffeepot.. and the wake up with my family
 Erica Best | January 19, 2011 at 3:22 pm | 
My tip is going to bed early really helps i like to get up 10 mins earlier to just have some me time just to think and get my head together it really helps.
 Lynda Ehrich | January 19, 2011 at 3:22 pm | 
Start with prayer. Closet organized by groups; I rotate my clothes. I grab the first“bottom piece”in the row, grab first top that complements it, then grab shoes (organized by color). I start my Keurig, then take the slow cooker from fridge (did prep night before), plug in dinner.
 Julie Demke | January 19, 2011 at 3:22 pm | 
I set the clocks at least 10 minutes ahead in the kitchen. I try to always sit down and enjoy a cup of coffee and always have a to-go mug! I have my lunch packed in my cooler and ready to take to work as I head out the door.
 Marcy | January 19, 2011 at 3:23 pm | 
I pack lunches the night before, and pick out clothes for myself and the babies the night before. Since I do a lot of couponing, I’ve also got anything I’m taking with me for my shopping trips together and ready to go near the door. That way there’s no wondering what to wear, or where that one really valuable coupon is, or what in the world I’m going to feed the hubby!

For sanity, even if I’m staying home that day, I get dressed to the shoes and make the bed right away. With shoes on, I’m really ready for anything. And making the bed–well, it makes me happy and confident. It gives me a little sanity.
 Amie | January 19, 2011 at 3:23 pm | 
Do as much as possible the night before; pack lunches, set out clothes, baths, know what is for breakfast, book bags/coats/winter clothes ready and packed. Leaves out all the guess work for in the morning. I just simply put it all into motion.
Thanks for the giveaway. I have been wanting one of these for awhile.
 Kathy | January 19, 2011 at 3:23 pm | 
We plan who will take what for lunch and we program the coffee pot. We also let the kids know what they are having for breakfast (ex-cereal, eggs, ect) so that there are no arguments in the morning.
 Shauna | January 19, 2011 at 3:24 pm | 
Of course preparation the night before is essential! I love the timer setting on my Coffee Maker and it makes it easy to get a cup on the fly. A good time saver in the morning for me is to make sure I am up and ready before my child. That way I can get him up and ready and we head straight out the door. This makes sure there is no extra time for him to watch tv or get out toys!
 alice | January 19, 2011 at 3:24 pm | 
Making my morning stress free is easy. My husband leaves for work around 7:15 a.m. He is not a breakfast person and likes to make his own lunch. I have a daughter in college, so I figure she is able to take care of herself. I do, however, locate her keys and sunshades, which is what she can never find and put them with her books and make her breakfast while she is dressing. While they are getting ready to leave, I feed and let the dog out. After everyone leaves is when I enjoy my coffee and listen to the news before I start my day. I do not have a coffee maker, so I make a cup of instant. I sure would like to smell the coffee making in a Keurig.
 Beth Edwards | January 19, 2011 at 3:24 pm | 
Mornging Tips:
–Night before; lay everyone’s outfit out, have all bags, coats, etc at back door ready, Place all cups on kitchen counter upside down, fill coffee pot with coffee and have coffee selection out, have everyone’s breakfast selection out on counter.
–In the morning; up and at‘em no hitting snooze, no cartoons will be on until the kids are dressed and ready.
 Cher Wulf | January 19, 2011 at 3:25 pm | 
I love the comments for smooth mornings. My best idea to date is to set the Keurig the night before to go off 5 minutes before I am up. That smell of coffee is an eye opener on its own! I place my“to go”cup filled with creamer and flavoring in the fridge the night before so it’s just pour and GO!
 P. Lucas | January 19, 2011 at 3:27 pm | 
Being retired the rush is not to get out the door fast but to not be stressed if I would have to. I lay out clothes that I will wear the night before and pack my ditty bag to take when I go to care for the grandchildren, In there I always have a cheap or free surprise to give them to make their day better too.
 Lisa O&apos;Neil | January 19, 2011 at 3:27 pm | 
To make things easier in the mornings, the kids pack their school bags, half pack their lunch bags and lay out their clothes the night before. That way in the morning, they eat a healthy breakfast, get ready and pack the rest of their lunch.
 Jill | January 19, 2011 at 3:28 pm | 
I make sure backpacks, jackets, projects, etc. are in the car the night before. I also pack lunches and place them in the refrigerator so they are ready to grab on the way out the door. I try my best to remember to set clothes out including socks, shoes, etc. the night before. And if I’m feeling really adventurous I’ll have breakfasts prepared as much as I can the night before (filling cups with milk, etc.). I’ve found that the less stressed I am in the morning the less stressed my kids are so I hope that leads to a better school day for them.
 Kim Haubrich | January 19, 2011 at 3:28 pm | 
I wish I could say that I was as organized and well prepared as most of the comments on here BUT I am not. My mornings consist of getting out of bed and getting ready for work while trying to wake my 18 year old son up for high school. If I had the Keurig I could make my cup of coffee while I was in the kitchen turning off all of the lights my son left on the night before and be ready for the day when making my way back to his room to see if my bundle of joy is up! 
 Jaz | January 19, 2011 at 3:31 pm | 
My day can not begin until I have had my morning cup of coffee…ahhh..coffee..:-)
 roberta | January 19, 2011 at 3:33 pm | 
Starting in November for the last 30 years, I make my“Christmas Braid”, gift it and stash the rest in freezer. Every morning, I make johnny cake for hubby’s breakfast along with his coffee. Later, I have my coffee with the Christmas braid, he has it on Sundays. Coffee needed to start the day.
 stephanie | January 19, 2011 at 3:33 pm | 
I have kept my sanity by giving my mornings to me. I get up, do yoga,make sure our 12 year old son is still on the right track.Walk the dogs, then share a protein shake with our 14 year old son and make sure he is still moving. My sanity: having independent sons = some of my time.
 Karin Bell | January 19, 2011 at 3:35 pm | 
The best way I’ve come up with to get my kids going in the morning is to make plans to cook breakfast with them the night before. I let them choose something easy (pancakes, scrambled eggs, french toast) and they will help prepare and cook them with me. They get so excited about helping out, they practically POP out of bed! Nothing starts the day out better than happy kids, a full belly, and no squabbling!

(I’m already an“All You”Facebook fan!)
 Jessica V | January 19, 2011 at 3:37 pm | 
I always get lunches together the night before and get my coffee pot set. That way I don’t have to waste time in the morning doing those tasks.
 Linda Secunda | January 19, 2011 at 3:39 pm | 
I don’t have a time saving tip, in fact I need one! I wake up groggy from meds that I take for restless leg syndrome, and try to wake up! I jump (well not so much) in the shower and try that wake up routine. I usually miss my morning coffee as I don’t have enough time to make coffee. Having a Keruig would surely help my day!.
 Angie Carter | January 19, 2011 at 3:41 pm | 
The 3 P’s: Plan, Prepare, Pray

1. The night before, PLAN ahead and determine what will be needed in the morning. Make a mental list or even put it down on paper.
2. PREPARE by completing your list.
3. PRAY for the Lord to help your morning go smoothly and to give you strength to face those unexpected things that might come your way.
 Rachel | January 19, 2011 at 3:41 pm | 
I have 3 children 10 and under so for my girls (7 and 5), I bought them socks and underwear with the days of the week on them. When they get up they just ask what the day is and pick out their“unders.”Well more often than not my youngest picks out the wrong ones on purpose, she will sit at the breakfast table and giggle about wearing Sunday socks and Thursday undies to school on Tuesday. 
 Megan | January 19, 2011 at 3:42 pm | 
We save time each morning by preparing our lunches, coffee, and setting out our clothes the night before. When we get up we get dressed, eat breakfast, brush hair and teeth and are ready to go.
 Donna | January 19, 2011 at 3:42 pm | 
My favorite fall-back breakfast is one or two pieces of whole wheat toast with peanut butter and a piece of fruit! When things are crazy, this is so easy, nutritious and delicious. Kids love it. I know it sounds too easy, but it’s tasty and provides protein, whole grain, a fruit and, along with a glass of milk, adds calcium
 Joanna | January 19, 2011 at 3:44 pm | 
I am NOT a morning person, so hubby gets everyone upand helps keep us all moving. The night before, I lay out littles clothes, iron guys shirts if needed, and put all non-perishable breakfast items on the kitchen table for easy access in the am. I also make sure that lunches are made in evening and that all paperwork, signatures, etc. are done at night. Preparation the night before keeps us groggy morning people on track!
 Adrian | January 19, 2011 at 3:44 pm | 
I set up my coffee maker the night before so when I come downstairs with the kids all I have to do is flip the switch. While I’m getting their breakfasts&amp;lunches ready my coffee is brewing. I also have the kids pick their clothes the night before so they are all set in the morning–no more I can’t find it! The youngest gets showered at night to streamline her morning routine. Anything to shave a few minutes off the morning and cut down on stress before school.
 pati allison | January 19, 2011 at 3:47 pm | 
Easy, get a Keurig!
 Holly | January 19, 2011 at 3:47 pm | 
In addition to having it all ready the night before (which is a huge help), I sleep in workout clothes and get up a half hour earlier….jump around a bit to help myself wake up and brew some breakfast tea. It’s so much easier to hustle all the kids when you’re not bleary-eyed yourself!
 Shari | January 19, 2011 at 3:48 pm | 
In addition to all the usual getting ready the night before tips, when my daughter was smaller, we used a five-day hanging clothes sorter in her closet. Each day had a complete set of clothes, including undies, socks, and shoes if the outfit required a specific set of shoes.

I always allowed her to help me choose her outfits on Sunday afternoons. Knowing that she had already chosen the outfits herself went a long way toward preventing morning arguments.

My other morning tip that still sticks to this day is keeping bottled water&amp;granola bars in our van. If something happens (oversleeping, doctor’s appointment, whatever), we can dash out the door, knowing a quick snack can be grabbed on the way to where we’re heading with adding extra time for food.
 Mackenzie | January 19, 2011 at 3:48 pm | 
This sounds crazy but I dry my hair in the car on the way to work. If I want it curly I put a little gel in it, otherwise I comb it out straight. When I’m driving I point the air vents at my hair and when I get to work 20 minutes later it’s dry (my hair is pretty thin). It saves me a good 10 to 15 minutes every morning and saves the electric at home.
 alicia | January 19, 2011 at 3:49 pm | 
Being a mother of 3 boys 5 and under I had to get my family on a routine. Getting them to bed at a timely manner gives me the extra time I need so that I am prepared for the next day. I love waking up and only having to hit the“brew”button. 
 Catherine P. | January 19, 2011 at 3:49 pm | 
Sometimes it is very hard to wake up in the morning, so I have multiple alarms set up to help wake myself an daughters up in the morning. I have to coffee maker ready so all I have to do is plug it in. Lunches are fixed after dinner (especially if we take leftovers) and I get the pets food ready the night before too! We have 3 cats and a dog and they want to be fed as soon as I get up in the morning (cats want their tuna). This all helps for a smoother morning.
 Nicole T | January 19, 2011 at 3:50 pm | 
I think the best thing you can do is plan ahead the night before. I have a 3-month-old so whenever we have plans in the morning, I make sure the diaper bag is packed and ready to go so I’m not rushing around trying to find things at the last minute. I also make sure he’s had a bath the night before if needed, since it’s easy to run out of time in the morning if we both have to get showered or bathed! This always makes my morning’s a little less stressful!
 Shari Aizenman | January 19, 2011 at 3:50 pm | 
I taught my son to organize the house the same way I have, so that if I am attending a birth, he can prepare his breakfast, lunch, whatever, and have coffee ready for me in the morning!
 Lyndsie | January 19, 2011 at 3:51 pm | 
I already“like”you on fb, so I am just going to add my morning helper since I am NOT a morning person at all! I Def. set up the coffee maker the night before so it is ready when I get to the kitchen. I also shower the night before so I don’t have to dry my long hair. This is a HUGE time-saver!!! If I want a smoothie for breakfast I use my Ninja and the night before i put all the ingredients in the small mixer container and put it in the fridge, take it out in the morning and put the Ninja on top for 30 secs and Voila!

Also if I DO take a morning shower, I brush my teeth in the shower to save on time AND water!
 Leah | January 19, 2011 at 3:52 pm | 
Organization is key. I made a list of everything I did in my morning routine, and I mean EVERYTHING. I went through the list and marked things to do the night before or even earlier, things I could cut out of my routine and things I should watch the time spent with. I make sure my clothes are ready the night before. I have my keys and work badge by the front door, so they are always easy to find. If I have a class the next day, I have my bag by the door. I am a student and I work full-time so I started making a big calendar to keep track of up coming events as well as planning cook days, clean days, etc.. Meal planning cuts a lot of time out of the full day routine. I plan my meals for a week. I do the shopping on one day and cook everything on another day. When the food is ready to be put away, I package everything in individual serving size containers and have them ready to grab and go without much preparation each evening. Watch prep time in the morning with hair and make up…My hair is beyond long and I used to spend lots of time with it and make up…Once I really looked at what I was spending time on and how much, I was able to trim it down quite a bit. There are lots of tricks out there to trim the prep time…and coffee first thing always help fuel the way for a happy and wide awake morning. 
 Lisa M | January 19, 2011 at 3:52 pm | 
It’s really tough for the kiddos and most espically in the winter, when the cozy covers wins in the morning. Once were all up in the morning, the online timer is set on the computer for one hour. Who says that getting ready can’t be a secret mission. We love to use the countdown bomb, because it has a fuse that shortens with the time. The goal, be ready before the fuse goes off. If we can accomplish our mission, we can happily put the fuse on pause. I give updates throughout the hour. I’m telling you, without fail our household is out the door before the bomb explodes.

If my daughter wants to be a super agent, she gets her stuff ready the night before. Imagination wins and everyone is safely on their way!
 Brandy Golden | January 19, 2011 at 3:53 pm | 
I have three girls under the age of 8 years and mornings are very crazy!! Each night before we go to bed we start getting stuff ready for the morning. We pick out our clothes for the next day, set the table for breakfast, and get all our bags and coats set up by the front door. If I am really on the ball I will get dinner in the crock pot the night before and put it in the fridge to keep till morning. I even do the girls hair the night before…LOL. I don’t know what I’m gonna do when they are to old for braids and pig-tails!! On the weekends I will make biscuits, donuts, pancakes, or breakfast pizza on a english muffin and freeze them for hot breakfasts during the week. I do instant coffee because making a full pot is a waste when there is only one person drinking it in the morning. I would love to have a keurig! It would be a little slice of heaven in my morning craziness!!
 Patricia C | January 19, 2011 at 3:55 pm | 
I make breafast for the week on Sunday. I scramble over a dozen eggs (16-18), 1 lb of bacon, 2 boxes of sausages, and a huge batch of pancakes.Weekday morning breakfast’s are fast and easy, we just warm up in the microwave.
 Patti B. | January 19, 2011 at 3:56 pm | 
Make a checklist and post it on a mirror that you traditionally see every morning…that way you won’t forget anything.
 Theresa C. | January 19, 2011 at 4:00 pm | 
Have everything laid out and ready for the next day so I don’t forget. Make the kids lay out their things too.
 Kimberley | January 19, 2011 at 4:01 pm | 
My advice for stress free mornings include 3 things:Consistency, Routine, and Home. Be consistent with bedtimes and wake-up times. If everyone knows the routine it will all go smoothly (most the time). Everything needs a home. If everything has a home there is no doubt where to find it when you are headed out the door.
 Dixie | January 19, 2011 at 4:04 pm | 
Ask your children for any notices from school so that you can sign papers, place lunch money, fees, etc., in small“baggies,”and return to the back pack ready to go in the morning. Make a bedtime schedule and make sure your child knows what is expected: take baths at night, lay out school clothes (including shoes&amp;socks) for the next day, have school back packs packed and ready to go and placed in a specified spot. Set out breakfast the night before; bowls, cereal, cereal bars. And most importantly, get everyone to bed in time to get a good night’s sleep, which will make getting up and going so much easier in the morning.
 Cindy | January 19, 2011 at 4:07 pm | 
Save time in the morning by deciding on clothes the night before, ironing them, and hanging them and hanging all underclothes, pantyhose, and accessories with them–preferably on the hanger. Place shoes nearby. Help kids pack their backpacks and prepare all but sandwiches for lunch. Place lunchbags in fridge. Set up a breakfast bar with bowls, spoons, and cereals. In morning, add the milk to the bar and kids prepare their breakfast as you make sandwiches and finish packing lunches. Place a checklist near the door so kids and you can check that you’ve got everything you need to head out the door.
 Darlene | January 19, 2011 at 4:10 pm | 
Programming my coffee maker the night before so the coffee is ready when I come downstairs to get ready for work. Also, pack lunches and get backpacks ready the night before. Have all coats (hats, mittens when needed) by the door for easy find.
 Nancy C. | January 19, 2011 at 4:11 pm | 
I try to keep my morning routing VERY SIMPLE. I have two standard breakfasts that I have in the freezer ready to go (egg muffins and brown rice w/walnuts, cinnamon, cranberries, and a splash of milk). To do the preparation, I keep all supplies (except the milk) in one cabinet above the microwave so whichever I choose in the morning, I don’t have to go searching for all the others things I need to make my breakfast.
 Judy T | January 19, 2011 at 4:21 pm | 
The night before, all lunch boxes are sitting on the counter ready to be packed, lunch items in one place so we can pack quickly, clothes laid out, and backpacks are by the door. Then in the morning we get dressed, pack lunches, grab backpacks and hurry out the door. Thekey is to get most everything done the night before so there is more time to sleep in!
 melinda g | January 19, 2011 at 4:23 pm | 
Coffee is set the night before and the timer in the pot kicks on automatically. I multi-task while I am waiting for my body oil or lotion to soak in so I can get dressed. I wrap my wet hair in a towel, apply my oil, brush my teeth, then go fix my jug of ice water for the day and grab my clothes on the way back to the bathroom. That short amount of time allows the towel to absorb moisture from my hair making drying quicker and the lotion or oil is soaked in and doesn’t stain my clothes.
 Kathy | January 19, 2011 at 4:25 pm | 
I wake up 15 minutes earlier than I need to because I -

Leave a
Little time for

Yourself–enjoy a cup
Of coffee&amp;check out Facebook–you’ll be
Unstoppable and stress-free all day long.
 Shelley Palmer | January 19, 2011 at 4:25 pm | 
I already“like”you on FB. My best morning routine short cut is breakfast. I keep a bowl of shredded mini-wheats in a re-sealable container in the car. I don’t use milk, never have. I eat while I am en route to my first patient or to the office (home health nurse). High fiber gives me a great feeling of fullness and gives me a stable blood sugar release throughout the morning!
 Mylinda | January 19, 2011 at 4:30 pm | 
In the morning, try not to hit the snooze. Lay in bed and stretch, waking up your whole body and mind. Run over in your mind what needs to be done when you get up because you have done most of the preparation the night before. Set your mind to a positive mindset, and hit the day head on.
 Jen | January 19, 2011 at 4:30 pm | 
Being organized the evening before is a necessity for making things simpler in the morning. I have my children get their clothes ready and on the table for the next day, their backpacks, coats, etc. set out and ready to go. In the morning I wake them up and they automatically come down the stairs and grab their clothes, get dressed, then come to the table for breakfast. If there is time before the bus comes, they watch some cartoons. Routine, Routine, Routine! The most essential time saving and sanity saving tool for me in the mornings is my programmable coffee pot! It is priceless to wake up to a hot cup of coffee. )
 Lela Dominy | January 19, 2011 at 4:32 pm | 
When my kids were little I would get up about a half hour before they got up. This gave me a chance to have my first cup of coffee before everyone got up and the kaos began. Then one Christmas I let them know that the only way I would allow them to wake me at 4 am up on christmas morning was if they had a cup of coffee for me in their hand.They woke me up at 4 am but I could smell the coffee in the cup they brought me. From then on my wonderful oldest son made my coffee every morning before he woke ME up. When he left home he gave me an automatic coffee pot so I could still have my coffee waiting for me when I got up. He is 45 now and he still has my coffee ready when I get up when I am visiting his house.
 Laurie Allred | January 19, 2011 at 4:32 pm | 
I prepare everything I possibly can the night before. That way my four year old can get her own breakfast and she knows what she is wearing for the day. It also helps get my husband out the door and on to work quicker. No frustrated mommy!
 Susan Del Duca | January 19, 2011 at 4:33 pm | 
Set up coffee and coffee cups and breakfast dishes on the table night before.
 Helena | January 19, 2011 at 4:34 pm | 
I always thought making a full pot of coffee in the morning before I got ready saved me time. But after visiting some family last weekend that both had a Keurig coffee maker, I could see how much time it saves. I couldn’t believe how fast it made a cup of coffee. And it tasted so much better! Not being the most organized person, I enjoy all the tips on AllYou.com. I keep trying out the ones that work for me. Maybe someday I will actually be organized! I save time in the morning by having all my breakfast and lunch food at work (we have a refridgerator) so I don’t have to hurry up and make it at home before I leave. I get to work early enough to have my breakfast.
 Delena | January 19, 2011 at 4:35 pm | 
I have two boys, ages 4 and 2 (along with a 3 month-old little girl). In order to get things done in the morning, I announce,“Weather Watchers…to the Window!”and the boys run over to the huge picture window to give me a weather report. While they give me a play-by-play on the weather, I’m able to get the dishwasher unloaded, new dishes loaded, coffee started, and breakfast made for everyone. Meanwhile, they’re having fun giving me a report, and I don’t hear,“MOM! When’s breakfast going to be ready?!”repeatedly.
 Delena | January 19, 2011 at 4:37 pm |

 mywife | January 19, 2011 at 4:39 pm | 
Set up the coffee maker at the night before.
Put the k cup,coffee cup and a spoon beside the coffee maker.
Hang working clothes behind the bathroom door.
Hang a wash cloth beside the shower.
Shave at the night before.
Put the breakfast on the table with a bowl and spoon, normally I eat cereal and milk. Sometimes with yogurt.
Set the alarm at 6am.
In the morning at 6am, I jump in the shower, then go to the kitchen and turn on the coffee maker, ours is wearing out, we had it for years. It heated water really fast, so in less than 1 minute, the coffee is ready for me to go. While I’m having my breakfast, my coffee is ready of me.

Everyday is like that, the coffee maker really makes our life easier. I hope I will win a new one to replace my old coffee maker.
 Katrina Greene | January 19, 2011 at 4:39 pm | 
Aside from nightly prep for the next day, I wake up 30 minutes before everyone else for a little“Me Time”to drink my coffee and plan out the day. With caffeine flowing through me, our mornings run pretty smooth. Having a Keurig coffee maker would be such a special treat for this CEO of Household Greene!! 

(Also, I’m a fan on FB!)
 Kristin | January 19, 2011 at 4:43 pm | 
Growing up in a large family (6 kids, plus foster kids and day care children) I learned from my mother very early on that organization is the key to a stress free morning. There are several ways that we save time, but one of the best time savers was installing a pocketed shoe-type organizer on the inside of our hall closet door. The pockets are perfect for not only shoes and boots, but hats, gloves, scarves, etc. We also designate pockets for keys, iPods, cell phones, change, and mail/papers that need to be sent or taken with. I label each pocket with pictures for the younger children and words for my 9 year old (and husband). Each child has a row of pockets for their belongings and before bed each night it is their responsibility to check that everything is in the organizer, even my three-year-old twins know to make sure their things are in the“right”place!!! I, of course, check again before heading to bed myself. This saves a ton of time running around looking for a lost mitten for one child, anothers iPod, my cell phone, my husband’s keys, etc.“A place for everything and everything in its place”is the motto in our house!
 Phyllis Thomas | January 19, 2011 at 4:46 pm | 
Assign everyone tasks to do in the evening, to be very prepared in the morning. Make these tasks standard operating procedure. It only takes 3 weeks to establish a habit. The nagging should be complete in 3 weeks, and the mornings should go much better.
Some chores could include laying out clothes, bathing at night, doing breakfast prep, and having books and bookbags set by the door for a quick exit.
 Olivia | January 19, 2011 at 4:48 pm | 
We definitely have to have a efficient wake up routine! 4a.m wake up everyday for my husband and myself..We always do what we need to the night before (it makes it so much easier on us when we wake up)It’s also less rush in the mornings, and you don’t have to worry about forgetting something you need for work at home..Thank you so much for offering this.I love All You Magazine, and I always share your free samples on my website..Once again thank you so much!

I set out clothes and fill backpacks the night before along with make the lunches and set the coffee pot for 6:45am the night before.
 nancy glessner | January 19, 2011 at 4:52 pm | 
I am an early riser. Up at 4:30 am. I like to get my clothes for the next day, ready the night before. Press them and then they are ready to go.&gt;)
 Wendy Perry | January 19, 2011 at 4:54 pm | 
We get to sleep on time and I organize everything for the next morning the night before. Really the best tricks are organization and team work. We all work together to get everyone out the door when they need to be!
 Becky B | January 19, 2011 at 4:55 pm | 
We all have our“staging”areas at home where we place, the night before, what we are going to need the next morning. This allows us to have more time for getting ready and we can just grab what we need for the day and go!
 Carrie | January 19, 2011 at 4:57 pm | 
I do everything that everyone else has mentioned. The only thing that I did not see mentioned is giving yourself extra time to wake the children up playfully.
Mornings go way more smoothly when I wake them up with smiles and tickles, versus the hurried“Get up now,”kind of mornings. Huge difference!
Of the two who are still in grade school, I wake my daughter up first because she needs a little more time than the boys. Once she’s up&amp;at‘em, I go wake up the youngest. It’s nice when their first expression of the day is a smile. And their attitudes towards getting up is so much better this way. You end up with a cooperative and pleasant start to the day.
 Amanda Ranta | January 19, 2011 at 5:04 pm | 
I prepare as much as possible before morning. Deciding what to wear, what to eat and what to bring with me for the day in advance help greatly. I even put the coffee and water in the coffee pot the night before! I eat and get dressed while the coffee maker is going because mine takes about 15 minutes to complete its cycle.

I’m married now, but when I was a child -I was 1 of 5 kids!- we had a shower schedule because all 5 of us kids shared one bathroom. I think that has helped a lot too…I know how to be quick and efficient’cause I’m used to having to be! 

(I already‘like’you on Facebook. )
 Julie O&apos;Malley | January 19, 2011 at 5:04 pm | 
To make mornings more efficient in my house, we take our showers before bed, I set the (old, decrepit) coffeemaker to brew 15 minutes before the alarm goes off, pack lunches and have them ready, and we all organize our clothing on hangers before we go to bed. That way the coffee’s ready, all we have to do is style hair, get dressed, brush teeth and grab a piece of fruit&amp;a cereal bar and our lunch bags on the way out the door.
 neha | January 19, 2011 at 5:08 pm | 
On the weekends I prepare breakfast burritos, waffles, pancakes and sometimes muffins to freeze for easy weekday breakfast. The night before I have my kids take a bath, pick their school clothes and shoes, we pack lunches and put them in the fridge, I get the coffee maker ready, and I wake up 45 minutes before everyone else to get in my morning yoga. That does mean I have to get to bed earlier, but if I don’t exercise, we all are cranky! ; ) (I follow ALL YOU on fb)
 David Chaille | January 19, 2011 at 5:10 pm | 
I follow the exact same routine every morning for maximum efficiency. I first start brewing the coffee, add flavored syrup to my cup, feed the dog, let the dog outside, and pour a bowl of cereal. By the time that I complete all of these tasks, my coffee is ready to pour. I then drink my coffee and eat my cereal while checking my email on the computer.
 allison | January 19, 2011 at 5:18 pm | 
We keep all our school items in the same place, bookbags, coats, homework ect so we know exactly where to look when we need it. I try to wake my kids up with a smile&amp;“Good Morning”also soft music playing which helps things run smoother most morning&amp;they are less grouchy. We pack snacks&amp;lunches if possible the night before&amp;they pick out there clothes. My oldest has a bowl of cereal each morning the other two eat at school then they are out the door for a great day.!
 Deb Campbell | January 19, 2011 at 5:19 pm | 
I pre-make as much of the lunhes as I can (SNACKS, DRINKS, ETC). That way I can make sandwiches, throw in the drinks and be done. I also decide my clothes, because I am not too awake in the mornings!
 Terri Mack | January 19, 2011 at 5:23 pm | 
I have a bag that I hang on the door knob at night and as I think of things I will need to take with me in the morning it goes in the bag (letters to mail, coupons for shopping after work, my charged cell phone etc.) alls I have to do is grab the bag and I have everything I will need. Coffee maker always set up the night before, evryones clothes all laid out and ready to go. We all need to be out of the house by 6:15 every morning so what ever we can do the night before really helps
 Kim Johnson | January 19, 2011 at 5:24 pm | 
We try to fix the coffee, lunches, plan breakfast and what to wear the night before. helps save time in the mornings, which are hectic enough!
 Carolyn | January 19, 2011 at 5:28 pm | 
I find it easier to get the kids ready in the morning if I am already up and ready before them. Also having the kids get showers and have their backpacks ready by the door also helps, along with my stuff ready to go as well.
 Donna Orrico | January 19, 2011 at 5:28 pm | 
Winning the Keurig coffee maker would really help to make my morning more productive. I use a perk coffee pot because thats all we ever used in my house as a child&amp;the coffee is hot&amp;great tasting. Since trying coffee from the Keurig at people’s houses I have been sold&amp;want one. Coffee making in the pot is so time consuming&amp;I hate washing the pot every morning.
 Debra Siebold | January 19, 2011 at 5:30 pm | 
Different schools and different departure times require that we do as much as possible the night before. My children shower, pack up their schoolwork, and pick out clothing the night before. I have my coffee on a timer so I smell it brewing when I wake up. My biggest trick is to set the alarm 30 minutes before I need to wake up my husband and 3 boys, to get those glorious few minutes to myself with a cup of coffee in hand. Those few minutes make the whole morning at least seem less chaotic!
 Jamie | January 19, 2011 at 5:32 pm | 
Have a checklist for each member of the family, especially children, listing their morning routine (such as get dressed, brush hair, brush teeth, get lunch from fridge, etc.) Make it fun by playing peppy music to time them on their tasks. Make oatmeal in the the crock pot the night before so breakfast is ready and smelling delicious when you get up. Have everything for the day set out at your“launch pad”the night before so you don’t have to go hunting for things before running out the door. Also never let the gas tank fall below 1/4 of a tank so pit stops are not required in the morning.
 Kimberly R. | January 19, 2011 at 5:33 pm | 
Always make lunches and pick out clothes the night before–it always saves time for me!
Thanks 
 Kathy Egley | January 19, 2011 at 5:34 pm | 
Pick and lay clothes out the night before for the next day, try to shower the night before. Have timer set on coffee maker so when the alarm goes off i can toilet and feed the animals, get dresssed and out the in a speedy time.
 Sherry Turner | January 19, 2011 at 5:41 pm | 
Would love a Keurig coffee maker….I try to do as much prep at night to cut out on time in the morning.
 Joan C Jones | January 19, 2011 at 5:42 pm | 
I have a 15yod with multiple handicaps and issues from a chromosome deletion. It takes a lot of planning to get out of the house with her. I try to her her formula made the day before and get all the things on her wheelchair that I can the day before. I also have everything laid out that I can. Even my coffee, and meals I have ready and waiting to take with me.
 Tracy Brabec | January 19, 2011 at 5:46 pm | 
I get up a half an hour before my children so I can have my first cup before the kids get up and I start their breakfast. Mornings go so much smoother after mom has her coffee!
 Kathy Z | January 19, 2011 at 5:57 pm | 
I get up earlier than some of the kids and get their lunches and my coffee made. I use the rice cooker to make oatmeal or grits overnight, which means it’s ready even for the early risers. The little kids have their clothes all picked out and ready to go. Mornings are much easier that way.
 Leigh Ann | January 19, 2011 at 5:58 pm | 
I have a daughter who is disabled and needs my undivided attention to get ready for school. I made my son a list of what he has to do in to morning to get ready, and I keep breakfast foods that he can prepare in case I or my husband aren’t available to help him. I tell him to check his list and if he dawdles too much, he will lose a priviledge that evening.
 Michelle Corey | January 19, 2011 at 6:04 pm | 
I make enough breakfast on the weekend to last through the week that can easily be reheated in the microwave for a few seconds, I have an organizer in my chilren’s room with their clothes laid out for the entire week, and all backpacks, coats, ect. are lined up next to the front door ready to grab on the way out. With 4 kids and 2 adults, this really saves us time!
 Crystal | January 19, 2011 at 6:06 pm | 
For a mom on the go we have no time in the mornings for anything other than getting dressed, combing our hair and rushing out the door. Having children of all ages to cart back and forth plus a full time job the easiest thing that I have found is preparing breakfast ahead of time and sticking it in the fridge/freezer. Rather than pay the high prices for fast food and leading an unhealthy lifestyle, I bag whatever it is individually so we can pop it in the microwave, or toaster and in a couple minutes we have healthy, filling breakfast on the go!
 Rhonda A. | January 19, 2011 at 6:06 pm | 
Keeping a routine is imperative!!! My husband, son&amp;myself all have to rise early each week day, so we prepare as much as possible the night b-4. Lunches are ready to go, clothes (at least for me) are laid out&amp;anything needed to go with is put by the front door, so it won’t be forgotten.
Also my husband sets 2 alarms on his phone. One to go off to let him know he has 1/2hour left b-4 leaving&amp;one that goes off when it is time to leave. This really helps keep a time frame, as I leave about 15 mins later.
I just can’t emphasize how much organization helps&amp;of course the COFFEE is set the night b-4 to go off&amp;be ready when we get up. I have to have that cup soon after getting up. Having one of these coffee makers would be so sweet!!!!
 Rita Sheppard | January 19, 2011 at 6:08 pm | 
I get everything ready the night before to save time the next morning by putting my coffee on so all I have to do is push the on button, take my clothes out that I’m going to wear the next day, and set out my breakfast dishes and food on the table.
 Kym Hall | January 19, 2011 at 6:11 pm | 
Timing and planning is important and getting enough rest. I also stick to a schedule in the morning so I leave the house on time and get to work on time. This way if I won the keurig. I would always have time for coffee.
 Nicole S. | January 19, 2011 at 6:14 pm | 
I always set my coffee to brew the night before, and i shower at night before I go to bed
 Kristina | January 19, 2011 at 6:15 pm | 
we set out all of our clothes for the day I set my sons on the living room couch and mine are in the bedroom. We also take showers the evening before. Breakfast is a toaster item and butter quick easy and on the go:)
 Tammy | January 19, 2011 at 6:20 pm | 
Wouldn’t it be nice to have one less thing to worry about in the morning….the convenience of the Keurig would help make crazy mornings a bit more appealing…..with kids and busy work schedules anything that saves time is a great big THUMBS UP from me!
 Alice H | January 19, 2011 at 6:21 pm | 
We make the coffee the night before. We also start showers EXTREMELY early and make sure that the person that gets out of the shower starts waking the next one“in line”. I keep knowledge of the time by keeping the local news on tv. I don’t necessarily watch it–but, I know what segments are on at what time, making it easier for me to know where I SHOULD be on my schedule.
 Megan McIlhargie | January 19, 2011 at 6:25 pm | 
The night before is your key to success. Take baths, pack lunches, set out clothes and don’t forget to set your automatic brew time on the coffee maker! I cannot get through a morning without coffee and it’s bittersweet to wake up to brewed coffee which is of course a time saver and life saver!!
 Kellie | January 19, 2011 at 6:26 pm | 
We have a pre-teen boy and a diabetic cat that needs her insulin every morning. Since she sleeps in my sons room I combine chores. I start a bagel and glass of juice for my son, get the insulin ready for the cat, and then take the breakfast to my son-which wakes him up right away-and give the kitty her medicine. One task done and one boy up and out of bed!! If I had a Keurig I could also make myself a cup of tea, that would be heaven!
 Jennifer Heberlie | January 19, 2011 at 6:27 pm | 
Setting out clothes the night before has never worked for me, because I am a mood dresser. I wear different things based on the mood I am in that day. The best time saver for me was to organize my closet by color. That way whatever mood I’m in I can find my clothes easily. I also divide clothes into sections by seasons so it is easy to find clothes for whatever weather it is that day.
 Michele H | January 19, 2011 at 6:31 pm | 
Routine, up, shower, dress, breakfast, make lunch, brush teeth&amp;final touches and out the door.
 mary garner | January 19, 2011 at 6:34 pm | 
grab a cup of coffee, say a prayer to get the day started in the right direction and then make beds, shower, get dressed and carry on
 Barbara K | January 19, 2011 at 6:37 pm | 
Clothes are picked the night before, breakfast&amp;lunch menu is written on a wipe off board and coffee is on a timer!
 Angela | January 19, 2011 at 6:38 pm | 
Already“Like”All You on FB….But a good nights sleep, Cup of Joe in the morning and my rambuncious 2 1/2 yr old boy makes my day efficient as it is.
 Deb R. | January 19, 2011 at 6:39 pm | 
Make sure everything is done the night before. That way all we have to is grab and go.
 Pam Minor | January 19, 2011 at 6:43 pm | 
I take time out the night before to pick out clothes, fix lunches, plan breakfast, and do anything that will help the next day go smoother. We put everything we need for the next door in a special basket by our door which is checked before we go out the door. If there is a lot of things that need to be packed for the next day, I go ahead and put as much as possible in the car so that it’s all ready to go.
 Jenn | January 19, 2011 at 6:44 pm | 
I have my lunch ready to go the night before ~ cold stuff together in the fridge, others stuff already packed. My work bag is ready to go with everything I need to take, most importantly my ID and work keys. I check the weather and place the appropriate coat on the back of a dining room chair and set out boots if needed. The coffee maker is prepared and set to go off so it is brewed and waiting on me. All my make up and hair products are kept in the same area to streamline the morning styling process. After I am dressed, I start my car (in cold weather) and then throw my lunch together and accessorize my outfit.
 Chris P | January 19, 2011 at 6:46 pm | 
Every weekend after laundry is done, I assemble five outfits for the following week, including the undergarments and accessories. I hang the five outfits in order at one end of the closet. No more looking for matching socks or a particular scarf. Easier to mix it up when you have time than to try and be creative in the wee hours of the morning!
 Dorothy Shaulis | January 19, 2011 at 6:47 pm | 
I do as much the night before as I can, such as bathing the night before, choosing clothing fot ehe next day,setting the coffee maker up, breakfast table set, lunch bag ready to go and anything else that needs to be taken along with you sitting near the door so you don’t forget anything or even putting things in the car so they are already there. Keep a regular routine in the mornings, that is what I find easier!
 Vivian | January 19, 2011 at 6:48 pm | 
I make those morning routines more efficient by consciously changing the order and manner of doing those things to fit your routine allow me to make adjustments as necessary, i.e. go with the flow and never forget to add to that a little bit of fun.
 Debra Waits | January 19, 2011 at 6:50 pm | 
The first and foremost thing I do is set the auto timer on my old cofee pot the night before and pray it works, as I can’t function without that first cup. Then I set the alarm on my cell phone and on my clock radio (15 min difference) just in case 1st one doesn’t wake me. I also have all clothes, toiletries and make-up laid out and ready to go so after I have that first cup of coffee there is no need to rush around or make decisions. Purse and keys are by the door so I’m ready to go and begin the day. A new coffee maker would sure help.
 Carol S | January 19, 2011 at 6:50 pm | 
Get everything around the night before-clothes etc. That way you have already decided what you are wearing, you just put it on and go. If you have kids, that can put a wrench in the system, so get their backpacks ready as well.
 Jacqueline Wentling | January 19, 2011 at 6:51 pm | 
&lt;3 It&apos;s nice to put the familys jackets and gloves in the dryer to get warm before they leave the house in them, and they are excited, and put them on fast! It&apos;s great for p.j&apos;s and bath towels too. A big warm hug to get them going!! 
 Trena Skufca | January 19, 2011 at 6:54 pm | 
I have 2 teenagers and each have their set time in the bathroom. I have put a clock on the bathroom wall and now we are all stress free and on time every morning.

I would love to win a Keurig Coffee Maker. I could possibly be the first to have one of these in Mitchell SD 
 Rachel Wexler | January 19, 2011 at 6:54 pm | 
I made up a breakfast“menu”for my kids and laminated it. Then, with a dry-erase marker, I have them circle their breakfast choices the night before. That way I can get their breakfast ready while they get dressed–and grumpy/sleepy-heads don’t have to waste valuable time trying to decide what they want to eat in the morning.
 Kathy H | January 19, 2011 at 6:55 pm | 
I make oatmeal in the crock pot and have coffee ready to roll. Lay out clothes before bed and shower at night.
Mornings are much easier and stress free
 Jennifer Archdeacon | January 19, 2011 at 6:59 pm | 
Aside from the obvious of having everything laid out the night before, if I have to get up extra early for some reason sometimes I sleep on top of the bed with a blanket thrown over me. When I get up all I have to do is fold the blanket up. I hate to leave the house with the bed unmade, so this solves that problem. Shower the night before, so all you need to do is brush your teeth, put on makeup that is laid out and ready and do your hair. Grab your coffee that was already to turn on and a snackbar or muffin, and your lunch which of course was fixed last night and you are ready to go. You watched the news last night so you know what the weather is going to be so you dress accordingly. Hopefully you have a few minutes that you have saved that you can have a few minutes to go over and make a list of things that need to be done before you start the whole day over again.

I drink instant coffee now, I have a Bunn coffee maker but, I can’t seem to brew it right and it is always too watered down. Anyway, to save time ,I now just have a mug of water in the microwave, and in the morning just punch in the time to heat the water, add my instant coffee and viola, fast, easy , plus no thinking required since I’d just rolled out of bed and my brain is still in nuetral.=D
 Cindy | January 19, 2011 at 7:11 pm | 
With six kids, a morning routine is necessary. To make an easy morning 3 shower the evening before and 3 the next morning. Breakfast is labeled in the freezer as 4 kids attend high school, they prefer to have juice and a frozen breakfast sandwich. I make the sandwiches on Sundays for the week. Lunches are premade for those who take them. All the kids have their own cubbie and hook with a schedule posted above with what is needed or due on a particular. These schedules are filled out every Friday, before the kids start their weekend. I find having a schedule and routine very helpful for the working of our large family, no one has missed the bus in ten years.
 Nicola | January 19, 2011 at 7:21 pm | 
We follow night/day routines to keep on track. Half of us shower @ night while the other 2 shower in the am (cuts down on hot water loss). Clothes are laid out and ready the night before as well as shoes and book bags. Cereal is poured and covered with plastic wrap and put on the table with spoons and fruit so all it needs is milk added in the am. My husband is a stay at home dad so he gets up at 6am with the kids to make sure they have breakfast. We have initial alarms set for my hubby and the kids and a 2nd alarm goes off 20 minutes before everyone has to leave so they are alerted that they need to hurry up. My husband gets the coffee going as he walks out the door with the kids around 7am. I don’t have to be at work until 830am so my alarm goes off around 715am. With my husband taking the kids to school I get the house to myself for a bit with the aroma of fresh coffee coming down the hall. Having routines helps everything go smoothly where none of us feel like we have to rush and not get up so early.
 Rebecca Dula | January 19, 2011 at 7:22 pm | 
It has to be picking out clothes ahead of time. With a 4 and 7 yr old, they do much better when things are already done for them. They don’t even have to open their eyes to get dressed. They just grab and put on.
 Tara | January 19, 2011 at 7:22 pm | 
The night before, I lay out my son’s clothes for the day. I also lay out my early morning workout clothes and business clothes to make the process easy and to eliminate an excuse to skip my workout.

I also pack my lunch the night before. It saves all that time of blankly staring in the fridge trying to figure out what I want to bring for the day.
 Carrie Claffey | January 19, 2011 at 7:32 pm | 
I have to have my clothes ready, lunch packed and coffee ready to go the night before. I even get up early so I can read the paper and have breakfast in peace and quiet, my only alone time. It’s even a good time to get the dishes unloaded and the dryer emptied do. It’s amazing how much you can get done while everyone is asleep. I would love to win the coffee maker, it would make my life easier. Thanks
 Ruth Augustine | January 19, 2011 at 7:35 pm | 
A cup of fresh brewed coffee and my bible or daily devotion. Thats what gets me going in the morning
 Erin K | January 19, 2011 at 7:37 pm | 
My husband, my 5 year old son and I are in the car and on the way by 6:15 every morning. I make sure I have my baby boy’s clothes laid out for him on his dresser…I lay my son’s clothes out too (pa rum pum pum)!

We are routine people–every morning is the same. I DO make sure that everything is packed the night before so that when I have to try on 8 outfits because everything looks awful on me, I still leave on time.

Coffee is a must and I would love a Keurig coffee maker to make it a little easier.
 Chris Z | January 19, 2011 at 7:42 pm | 
I make of list of at least 3-4 things that need to get done the next day. In the morning, before turning on the computer to read emails, blogs, find coupons, etc., I make sure that I do at least 1 or 2 of the items on the list. This way I don’t get carried away on the computer and I also feel good‘checking off’things at reaping my reward at the end of the day.
 Nicole | January 19, 2011 at 7:49 pm | 
My kids make the coffee for my husband and I in the morning. They feel like they are doing something special for us. Awesome. Found out that they“sneak”some for themselves sometimes. I wondered where all my creamer goes!! So it is a timesaver for us and a great motivator to get up and go.
 Nicole S | January 19, 2011 at 7:51 pm | 
Besides trying to plan everything out I need the night before, I also set up my alarm clock for intervals to go off to remind me of what time it is as I am getting ready.
 Brenda | January 19, 2011 at 7:53 pm | 
I set certain alarms on kids cell phone to keep them on track and aware of the time. If they stay on track, we stop at Subway or Tim horton’s for b-fast on Fridays. I get coffee and lunches ready the night before, and try to smile and be calm in the morning. Nobody likes a grouch. I try to keep em on track and reward the good behavior!
I’d Sooooooo LOVE a Keurig…just sayin (pick me)
 Jill A. | January 19, 2011 at 7:56 pm | 
Since I’m not a morning person, I do as much as possible the night before. My lunch is packed, the kids’book bags are ready, our clothes are picked out and put in the same location every night so we can find them in the morning. We bath/shower in the evening for it’s one less thing to do. My husband and I split the tasks with our kids–I make sure they are dressed and he feeds them breakfast since I have to leave earlier than him. We follow the same routine everyday. Sometimes we have to bribe our kids–if they get dressed quickly every day for the entire week they can chose the movie for Friday’s movie night. The mornings are so hectic that I even eat my breakfast in the form of breakfast bars on the commute to work–no time to sit down at home!
 Carolyn P | January 19, 2011 at 7:58 pm | 
I always try to have everything ready the night before whether it be for a school morning, work morning etc. Make the coffee, lay out lunch money or lunch box with non perishable item already packed the night before so everyone is able to basically grab and go.
 Misti C. | January 19, 2011 at 8:06 pm | 
Having my first cup of coffee before the kids get up is my key to a successful morning! My children (7&amp;4) love being active particapants in their morning routine. Let your children make decisions that pertain to them for the day, like what to wear and healthy options to put into their lunches! You will be suprised how good their attitudes can be when they feel like they made the important decisions of the morning!
 Tina P | January 19, 2011 at 8:10 pm | 
I work 70+ hours per week. I must have fast, excellent coffee. I drink coffee morning, noon and night and Keurig makes my life easier. I love coffee and I will not drink bad coffee. Keurig makes an excellent cup of coffee and the products are phenomenal. I love everything about my Keurig…best product in my kitchen.
 Theresa | January 19, 2011 at 8:11 pm | 
I set a tote next to my purse to put things I need to take the next day. I also put a note on my purse with things I don’t want to forget in the morning (lunch in fridge).
 Marian Wehr | January 19, 2011 at 8:15 pm | 
I get up the same time each day, make coffee,&amp;take my dogs out. Once back in with the dogs I sit down and enjoy my 1st cup of coffee for the day. It is my time.
 Martha H. | January 19, 2011 at 8:15 pm | 
For fifteen months, I’ve been getting up very early Monday–Friday and driving to my daughter’s to help care for her and her baby. I’ve learned a couple of valuable reminders to help me get out of the house with what I need every day. I have a small tote bag that I put things in I need to remember the next day and then I hang it on the door knob of the door I got out each morning. To keep from forgetting my cell phone from the charger, I put my purse nearby the plug and put my phone on top so I see it when I pick up my purse. To make sure I remember my vitamins&amp;medication each day, I keep them in the same drawer where my comb and brush are in the bathroom and get them out each day&amp;put them in my purse before I brush my hair.
 Melissa | January 19, 2011 at 8:20 pm | 
My plan is easy. I get up at 6:00 shower, get ready. wake the kids up at 7 rush to get them ready. Grab a frozen dinner out of the freezer for lunch and leave at 7:20 or 7:30. My super secret is that my wonderful daycare feeds my children! My secret weapon is that my employer has free coffee for me when I get there as a reward.
 Linda | January 19, 2011 at 8:27 pm | 
I try to get as much done the night before as possible, so to help avoid morning stress. I get up at the same time every day, even though some days I have to leave the house earlier than others. I have my clothes ready the night before too. I would love to win the Keurig because coffee if a must in the mornings and I’ve heard only wonderful things about them!
 Tracey Henderson | January 19, 2011 at 8:38 pm | 
I program my coffeemaker to start when my alarm clock goes off, jump into the shower, then enjoy my coffee while getting dressed and making the bed.
 Susan D&apos;Amato | January 19, 2011 at 8:38 pm | 
Besides making lunches and setting up the coffee pot the evening before, I try and pull together 7-10 days of outfits every other weekend. I put my bag and shoes by the door. I also get up a little earlier than I need to in order to watch the news for a few minutes and check my calendar so I have all my ducks in a row for the day.
 Jennifer Horgan | January 19, 2011 at 8:52 pm | 
I lay my clothes out the night before so I can just get up and ready in no time before my son wakes up.
 Brenda | January 19, 2011 at 9:00 pm | 
I like you on Facebook.

My tip is to have everything prepared for the next day. Great most days except for those when i change my mind. 
 Martrisa | January 19, 2011 at 9:19 pm | 
On Sunday evening I make 20 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. One for each child for each day of the school week. I put each sandwich in a zipper bag and then put all of bags in a large plastic tub in the freezer. That way in the morning all I have to do is throw a bottle of water, bag of baby carrots (all bagged on Sunday evening) and a treat as well as their sandwich fresh from the freezer in their lunch bags. By the time lunch rolls around their sandwiches are thawed and fresh!
 Mark D. Avery | January 19, 2011 at 9:23 pm | 
My best advice is to stay focused the night before and plan your morning, allowing family time when possible.
Have a daily routine that has changes that keep you on your toes and fresh. Sleep well, have your, or anyone in the households, morning meds ready, and put them where you won’t forget to take them, But remember the little hands that grab everything, keep them safe.
My routine ended in 2006 when the Federal Goverment Terminated me for Post Cancer Surgical Problems.
11May04 I started a new life. Surviving is a challange.
It all passes to fast, take my word for it.
Never sacrifice the moment to save time you will never get back.
The best time saving tip is an old Boy Scout Motto:
Be Prepared.
Two words that can make a huge differance in the outcome of every situation you will ever face.

I wish you all well
Mark D. Avery
 Sherry | January 19, 2011 at 9:33 pm | 
I make mornings more efficient by laying out clothes for everyone, setting the timer on the coffee pot and having lunches packed the night before. I put purses, phone, keys, backpacks, etc. in the same place every night, so we don’t waste time looking for them in the morning.
 Linda | January 19, 2011 at 9:46 pm | 
I multitask: I put hot curlers in my hair and while I wait for them to cool down I brush my teeth, get dressed, and do things like feed the dog!
 Tina | January 19, 2011 at 9:50 pm | 
I have a time budget. I print them out on Sunday. For each day I have a list of“day of the week”chores to accomplish. One of my chores is ironing–(on Tuesdays). This means all laundry washed on Monday is ironed and hung in closets. This helps tremendously because I never have to worry about ironing clothes when we are getting dressed. Also I always run my dishwasher and shine my sink right before I go to bed. In the morning while my coffee is brewing, I start a load of laundry and empty the dishwasher.
 Tina Ng | January 19, 2011 at 9:52 pm | 
I take a shower at night before I go to bed. I leave my sunglasses, keys, badge and any other things I would need in the morning before heading out the door in one place. On weekends I cook enough lunch for the whole week and each night I put them in a container. In the morning I just grab it, add an apple or orange, and that’s my lunch for the day.
 Judy K | January 19, 2011 at 9:58 pm | 
Iam a list maker and with six of us in the house, three adults and three children i make list for each of us for each day and then update them the nite before because as we all know things change even the kids love the coffee maker for the hot chocolate which they love in the am
 Becky H | January 19, 2011 at 9:59 pm | 
My husband and I like to do as much as we can the night before to get ready for the next day. I also like to get up 15 minutes earlier than I need to so that I do not have to rush. Doing so gives me a few minutes to enjoy some much needed“me”time while eating a bowl of cereal. This starts my day out on a nice relaxed note!
 Amy | January 19, 2011 at 9:59 pm | 
I“like”All You on Facebook.
We do all of the typical laying out of clothes, lunches, bags, etc, the night before. But my best tip is to relax and make it fun. With four boys there is a lot of competition in our house, so I use it to my advantage! We race and make the morning a game. The first one dressed chooses breakfast, the first one with their teeth brushed and coat on gets to choose the radio station in the car, etc. I feel good knowing that I didn’t have to nag my boys to get them ready and they aren’t stressed and frustrated when they get to school.
I would love this coffee maker! My husband has bought it for me twice because he knows how much I want it, and I have returned it both times because I just couldn’t have him spend that much money! I would LOVE to win one!!
 pamela | January 19, 2011 at 9:59 pm | 
I learned very quickly when my 6 children were younger that this unorganized mom was going to flounder if she didn’t get some help! I helped myself by helping my children be responsible for getting ready themselves. This not only helped me, but also helped them become more responsible! They set their own alarm clocks, get their own breakfasts, and have their supplies ready the night before without much prompting from me. Mornings are less stressful as we visit at the kitchen table while Daddy makes their lunches…yes, I somehow only have to feed the animals and compliment everyone on what a great job they’re doing!
 Nancy Menard | January 19, 2011 at 10:03 pm | 
We have the school backpack ready and waiting by the door, and the lunch pre-bagged (chips and cookies-just needs a fesh sandwich in the morning). I also prep the coffe pot with coffe and filter-even water (you can keep it cold with a few ice cubes).
 Erin Rednour | January 19, 2011 at 10:06 pm | 
Sometimes I’m really good about getting as much done for the morning the night before. Like putting dinner leftovers in small containers for lunches and getting the clothes all ready. But sometimes I forget to pack lunches or the clothes I want are still in the dryer and I have to run around and get everything in the morning. BUT, I always remember to get the coffee ready. It is what I head for when I sleepily stumble out of bed in the morning. I can forget to get lunches or clothes ready, but I never forget to get the coffee ready.
 Erin H. | January 19, 2011 at 10:08 pm | 
To help our mornings run smoothly, we wake up our three year old twins by singing silly songs. It makes them smile/laugh and they are less likely to be crabby.
 misty | January 19, 2011 at 10:11 pm | 
I make breakfast for the next day by starting recipes at night before bed, in my crockpot! I love fruity oatmeal and such each morning!
 Christen | January 19, 2011 at 10:17 pm | 
I have extremely thick hair so I try to wash it the night before and let it dry for the most part and then finish with the blow dryer–then I set out the hot rollers to give it some body in the morning.
 Andrea | January 19, 2011 at 10:18 pm | 
I have 3 kids ages 8, 3, and 4 months. I have my oldest pick out her clothing the night before for school the next day. Lunches get made the night before sometimes I even make up all the peanut butter and jellies for the week on Sunday night that way I only have to throw it in her lunch bag that morning. Sippy cups for my 3 yr old get made the night before and are ready and waiting for him in the fridge when he wakes up. The baby is bottle fed and those are all made the night before as well. I even lay out clothes for my husband to make things easier for him in the mornings. Coffee is the first thing I do in the mornings it’s a must! I will often make up batches of pankcakes and waffles on the weekends to pop in the toaster on weekdays before school. Also homemade muffins are a big hit as well. These little things make life ALOT easier and less hectic in the morning.
 Sarah | January 19, 2011 at 11:11 pm | 
The best thing to make the morning better is to win this coffee machine and take less time in the morning!
The best way to make your morning better is to set your alarm for 15 minutes early and take time to wake up and breathe before having to jump out of bed. Also the night before have everything packed and ready by the door. I also post a note on the door if there is something I really need to do…like don’t forget to drop off the book this morning. We also switched our iron, coffee marker and curling iron to ones that shut off automatically so no worries if you forget to unplug. Not worring you are going to burn down the house helps everyones morning.
 Patti Toby | January 19, 2011 at 11:16 pm | 
Set the java to start at 7, get up, coffee’s ready, now to start the day! Having the Keurig B60 coffee maker is all I or you will ever need in this lifetime!
 Wendy | January 19, 2011 at 11:16 pm | 
I take a deep breath, focus on the moment, take time for some stretching and then hit the floor running.
I lay out my clothes and make my lunch the night before. I drink lousy coffee at work, because there is not enough time to brew coffee for one at home.
This coffee maker would put more zen in my a.m. and spare me the bad stuff at the office that they try to pass off as coffee.
 KD | January 19, 2011 at 11:31 pm | 
I figure if my boys like frozen waffles&amp;pancakes- It’s completely okay, if I make extras on weekends and freeze them fresh for weekdays, so I don’t have to cook after rolling out of bed!
 Ann Graham | January 19, 2011 at 11:34 pm | 
We set our coffee up the night before on it’s automatic timer so we can grab fresh coffee on the way out to work. The problem is, my husband gets up a couple of hours before me so by the time I get my coffee, it’s no longer fresh. Just the thought of owning a Keurig coffee maker paired with Folgers coffee would be“the best part of waking up”!
 Pam M | January 19, 2011 at 11:47 pm | 
Get into the habit of packing your lunch the night before, set up the coffee maker and instant breathing time in the morning. A quick brew and go from a Kuerig would even be better.
 Aisha F | January 19, 2011 at 11:54 pm | 
I always stay prepared doing all I can the night before. Laying out my clothes, having my breakfast ready. However what helps me the most is waking up 5 minutes earlier to stretch my body, and do some routine yoga exercises. This helps refresh my mind and body. You wouldn’t believe how refreshing it is. It awakens your senses and even helps you move faster so you don’t waste any time in the morning. After that simple routine I am ready to conquer the whole day!!!
 Wendy | January 19, 2011 at 11:55 pm | 
I shower the night before, so incase I need the snooze I can hit it. I have simplified my makeup routine to what I can finish in the car. The noight before, I try to get my clothes and items packed and ready to go for the day. I have settled for instant coffee&amp;boiled water from the microwave in a travel cup.
 Cindy | January 20, 2011 at 12:07 am | 
I try to always to the same thing in the same order when getting ready in the morning. I also pack by work bag the night before and put anything I need to take with me the next morning either in or by my bag.
 Cassandra Norris | January 20, 2011 at 12:13 am | 
So I try to prepare as much as I can the night before! Normally the night before I will prep the coffee pot, so all I have to do is turn it on when I get up. I also prep lunches for both my boyfriend and I so all we have to do is grab and go. Then I either gather my work clothes or workout clothes and put them in one place so I don’t have to go digging through drawers or the closet half asleep…..I try to get as much as I can the night before so the morning is smooth sailing!
 Darlene | January 20, 2011 at 12:15 am | 
Besides all the wonderful prepping idea like everyone mentioned…we always need a little wake up drill that helps everyone wake up and get started. I would put on a tape called the sleepy bus and it had a song about waking up. Come on you sleepy heads get up get out of bed, see how the sun is shinning. Wake up and dont be slow…tell um its time to go weve got a lot to do today. I would put it on and tell them you have until the song is over to get up and then the next song gfave them time to get dressed and get to the table to eat. That made things fun and peppy and gave them a time frame they knew they needed to beat the clock…but I wasnt the one having to stand over them and watch so much.
 L. Ann Morel | January 20, 2011 at 12:24 am | 
Oy! There’s nothing worse than being miles from home in AM traffic and realizing you forgot something. Avoid fuzzy morning mind syndrome by uses sticky notes at eye level on your home’s exit door. Ah, one less worry starts the day on the right note.
 Talitha Lee | January 20, 2011 at 12:26 am | 
I set up my coffee maker to brew and be done when I get up. My kids have a morning routine that they follow to help make the mornings smoother. I try to do as much in advance as possible but some days you just can’t plan ahead!
 Devon | January 20, 2011 at 12:32 am | 
Make your kids sleep in their clothes. At 1st my girls thought I was nuts, but after getting up at 515am so they could get dressed, they decided it wasn’t so bad if they could sleep in another 1/2 hour.

My 12 yo still does this sometimes.
 Elliott E. Fisher | January 20, 2011 at 12:39 am | 
Making a list of what you are doing so you don’t forget/repeat.
 Linda boyd | January 20, 2011 at 12:56 am | 
I like you on FB. I always get up and have coffee ready to go. Turn it on……Hop in the shower. Come out and wear a warm fuzzy robe and slippers. grab my coffee and go online to check out my Facebook for all the great deals and sweepstakes and of course my fav site. like All you!!!!! 
 Beverly C. | January 20, 2011 at 1:17 am | 
I do as much as possible the night before since I’d rather do that and get more sleep. This would be so convenient and I love flavored coffees.
 Jessica | January 20, 2011 at 1:26 am | 
I get everything ready the night before–bags, clothes, even breakfast. Oh and my great husband unloads the dishwasher so all I have to do is put the dirty breakfast dishes straight in. Makes clean up a breeze.
 Susan Fisher | January 20, 2011 at 1:34 am | 
I try to get everything ready, and by the front door for the morning. A sticky note on the door also helps with reminders for the day. A Keurig coffee maker would also be a great time saver! 
 Regina | January 20, 2011 at 1:37 am | 
My tip is use disposable bowls, cups, spoons, etc…only stick to cold cereals. That way there is nothing to clean later. And have everything you need for the next day already in the car ready to go the night before. I use hot tap water and a styrofoam cup for my instant coffee. Precook meals in advance that can be pulled out and heated for the week. And chose outfits for each day ahead of time.
 Sherri S | January 20, 2011 at 1:45 am | 
My morning tip is to lay out as much as possible the night before so I don’t have to think too much in the morning.
 Mary | January 20, 2011 at 2:38 am | 
Organize is the key to success especially for your morning start.
I always prepare at night, I set out the coffee cups, sugar, bowls for breakfast. We put backpacks at the front door, lay out the clothes at night, and set the timer for coffee. We always try to think ahead, but we never forget to Love one another, and by taking the time to say it too. We live by the motto of never allow stress to come between our family, and by living by this golden rule we do not have stress free mornings, we work together as a team, and everything falls in place. Life is to short to allow stress to damage our health.
With Love, Understanding, and family first we always get threw it all.
Everyone always remember family first.
 Brigette | January 20, 2011 at 2:50 am | 
I“like”All You on Facebook.

I save time in my mornings by being organized the night before, takes 10 minutes before bed to have a stress free morning. I really like my mornings and I look at them like a chef might–I want all the prep work done and ready to go so I can do my thing!
 Lynda | January 20, 2011 at 3:53 am | 
With 3 adults trying to get out of the house in time and 2 bathrooms, I try to streamline breakfast by using easy-to-eat/grab foods such as yogurts, granola bars, and pre-packed snacks in ziplocks. I also plan my outfits either the night before or in my mind in the 10 minutes while I snooze. I have also learned to not fret about dishes and to just leave them soaked in water for when we come home.
 Tammy | January 20, 2011 at 4:02 am | 
Dear Sweet Ladies!
I sure I hope I am doing this correctly as I have never attempted to put anything on-line before! But, when I found this opportunity“to share your best advice for saving time (and sanity) in the morning for a chance to win one of two Keurig B60 coffee makers—plus each winner will get some delicious Millstone and Folgers coffee K-cups!”I absolutely HAD to write in! With three special miracle children in our home I wish I could advise you all on how to save time, time is too precious and something we don’t ever have enough of! But, I can tell you how winning this would help save my sanity every morning! Wake-up call is 4am every morning, and a cup of coffee is needed like a breathe of fresh air! I can’t even function without my morning coffee! I can’t even tell you how many cups a day it takes to stay fully awake and alert, as there is no such thing as a set bed-time here, so as you can imagine, that’s takes a LOT of coffee. It would truly be a dream come true to have a Keurig Brewing System&amp;Millstone K-Cups! I currently use the least expensive store brand instant (time is too precious to wait and I don’t have a coffee maker) coffee, and I am sure you can imagine the taste is less then pleasurable, but, it gets the job done. I am sorry I went over the 50 word limit, I just wanted to share from my heart how much winning this give-away would mean to me! Thank you for the long read and for generously sponsoring this contest! Blessings to all you hard-working moms, and dads, and all your healthy babies!
 Dawn | January 20, 2011 at 5:46 am | 
Set up the coffee pot the night before–that way coffee is ready when you get up in the AM. Gotta have my coffee in the mornin’!!!
 Seana Landeros | January 20, 2011 at 5:56 am | 
We have a HUGE magnetic calendar on fridge so everyone knows what’s up; coffee is a MUST, and planning your clothes, bring-alongs, etc. are all done the evening before. 
 Courtney St. Germain | January 20, 2011 at 7:35 am | 
With our family of six, including an infant, team work is how we make the mornings run more smoothly. The older kids pitch in with the evening chores like after dinner clean up. My husband and I tag team helping them, bathing the baby and picking out clothes for the next day. But my husband does something during this routine that not only saves time in the morning but is also very cute. He fills our coffe filter with grounds and our coffee carafe with filtered water from our refrigerator and then he covers the spout with saran wrap to keep it fresh. It definitely saves me time in the morning that I don’t have to stand there sleepy-eyed and fill the coffee pot. Thank you honey.

Doing three things the night before helps my morning start right. My children pick out their clothes. I set up the automatic coffeemaker to help wake me up to the aroma of fresh brewed coffee. And I get into bed at the same time each evening.

To help save time in the mornings, the night before, I set the coffeepot, lay out clothes, pack lunches, have backpacks by the door. This saves a lot of time and we aren’t trying to figure out what to wear, or where the school things are…makes mornings smoother.

i prepare as much as possible the night before, so in the morning i can start my day with less to do and less stress

How I save time in the mornings with a husband and three kids to get ready and shiped out of my hair is simple. It is important to establish a routine. Things go smoother and faster when everyone know what to do. Prepair what you can the night before. ex. backpacks by the door. Clothes set out. showers taken. lunches packed. Shoes hat gloves and scarfs all together and ready. I wake first to get ready start the coffee and wake the heard. As they get dressed I prepair breakfast. simple..

The more I PLAN and ACCOMPLISH the night before reflects how SMOOTH my morning will be! I think the only step I have left to save me time in the morning would be to get rid of the“fluff”i.e. pet, kid&amp;husband! LOL

Working various shifts, my day may begin 5 in the morning, 9 at night, or anywhere in between. No matter the time, my day doesn’t begin till after that first cup of Joe. I set my coffeepot timer so that when my alarm goes off, that wonderful aroma meets my olfactory senses. Now if there were a way to obtain that first cup without having to get out of bed!

I’m definitely not a morning person and, with longish hair, a morning shower + blow dry + styling would take forever. So, I love to take a shower at night, right before bed and let my hair air dry (Bonus: less damage to strands and if you slick lotion on skin right before hitting the sheets, it packs more of a moisturizing punch!). Then in the morning, I quickly run a curling iron through the ends to give my hair a polished look for work before running out the door. It’s a win-win. And, of course, it helps to have clothes, shoes, etc…laid out the night before for extra organization.

For as long as I can remember I have had my kitchen clocks set 5 to 10 minutes fast. I never allow myself to factor those extra minutes into my schedule. So since I have a tendency run late, I’m on time or occasionally early!

After years of being late I started setting my kitchen clocks 5 to 10 minutes fast. I never allow myself to factor those extra minutes into my schedule. So now I’m on time or occasionally early!

Stick to a routine. I have two kids I get ready for school each day and I need to get ready for work. If I don’t get up on time and the kids get up before me. It sets the tone for the entire day, which is not good.

My mornings are hectic and I am always looking for new ideas to make my mornings go easier. I have an 11 year old, 2 year old and another one on the way so I know my mornings are only going to be more hectic. My routine right now is to get as much as possible ready the night before. Clothing laid out for myself and the kids, backpacks/diaper bags packed and ready by the door and lunches made. My oldest daughter usually takes her breakfast to go so we bake muffins and have them wrapped and ready to go along with a juice box. My husband sets up the coffee pot the night before to be ready when he gets up at 4am. I don’t have to be up until 700 am so I’m usually heating up my coffee in the microwave. Even with all the preparations, I still can’t get out of the house on time.

At the beginning of the week, I look at my schedule for work (meetings, visitors, etc.) and plan my wardrobe. Since the warddrobe is ready to go on Monday, each day I don’t have to fuss with finding something to wear and I’m always prepared for the visitors and/or meetings appropriately.

Our family of five tips are: watching weather update so we plan our outfits ahead of time, getting backpacks, showers, makeing lunches&amp;setting coffee pot of 14 cups ready for hubby’s thermos&amp;travel mug. (which leaves me making more in the morning!) Also, the two older children help with chores before bedtime. It is also helpful getting sports uniforms ready for the next day. The Keurig Coffee Maker would be awesome for us especially for me&amp;when we want to bring coffee on the go to kids sporting events and they can enjoy hot chocolate!

I have pre-made/homemade sausage/egg/cheese biscuits, scramble egg burritos, and waffles in the freezer for quick heat-ups in the morning. When everyone is leaving at different times it makes it easier to grab and heat. They if you’re running late you can take it with you. Everyone has learned to use the microwave (1 button heating), so mom doesn’t have to be in the kitchen non-stop.
 Cynthia C. | January 20, 2011 at 11:40 am | 
I have the house picked up before bedtime each night. Showers are done the night before&amp;I have the clothes laid out also. I go ahead and pack the snacks and items that don’t need to be heated up in the lunchboxes the night before. I know that we should be eating breakfast&amp;finished by a certain minute&amp;also dressed&amp;ready to go by a certain minute. That way we can walk out the door when we are supposed to.

We make our mornings more efficient by Moving To The Music. I create CDs of feel good music that keeps us moving and smiling. Each song is an indicator that we need to move onto the next task such as brushing our teeth or putting on our clothes/ shoes.
 BranDi MG | January 20, 2011 at 11:53 am | 
We pretty much run the same routine everyday, so we alternate and make a competition out of who can complete each common task the fastest.

Place brightly colored post-its around the house of things to do in the morning. Rules: Do what you can do at night, try to collect all of the post- its in a room, never enter the same room twice, and don’t forget your lunch phone, keys, or wallet.

Most of the time I waste in the morning is just getting out of bed. Getting ready and out the door has never been an issue for me, it’s just getting up. I’ve found that having my alarm clock linked to my Ipod on a playlist with really upbeat positive motivating music helps me get moving much faster. It also starts me out on a positive note for the day, no matter how bad I wanted to stay in bed.
 Amie | January 23, 2011 at 11:54 am | 
i like to have my kids set out clothes and socks and shoes at the end of theyre bed the night before, then they can get up and get themselves dressed while i make my coffee 
 janis | February 5, 2011 at 5:32 pm | 
The best way for a productive morning, is to be sure to get most everything ready the night before. I always make my husband and my son’s lunches the night before. I empty the dishwasher from dinner, and reload with any errant dishes that haven’t been washed. I also set my current Keurig machine up—I make sure the water is full, and I use either the“My KCup”for my husband’s fav. gorund roast coffee, or a Keurig KCup ( our current fav is Folger’s Columbian) and K cup in the slot and the mug underneath so it’s set and ready to roll when my husband gets up in the morning. I also set out the food bowls for our 7 cats, and pick out a couple cans for them to share in the morning.
Mornings go smoothly in my house!

I make breakfasts ahead of time and freeze them. I put them in the microwave while we’re getting dressed and when it comes out, it’s done. Something easily done this way is breakfast burritos. Make up the filling ahead of time, freeze it, heat it, then stuff your burrito with it and go.
 Lindsy Salgren | January 19, 2012 at 10:46 am | 
Lay your clothes out and roll your hair in curlers the night before, in the morning all you have to do is get dressed and unroll your hair an spray it…slap on a lil make up and you are ready to go! Used to take me an hr and a half to get ready, now it only takes me 15 minutes!!!
 becca | April 3, 2012 at 4:36 pm | 
I like all my fav magazines! My best idea is to have this K Cup machine!!!!!!! In all honestly my hubby and I have two different bathrooms–I lay our clothes out in our respective bathrooms- have a makeup case that has my makeup in order of how I put it on I keep our car keys by the door and pack lunches as I’m making dinner the night before….Coffee is our only hold up in the morning so PLEASE pick ME!!
