 FEATURE IWrestledABearOnce Interview 
Forest Gump&apos;s momma always used to say Iwrestledabearonce&apos;s music is like a box of chocolates; you never know what you&apos;re gonna get. Well, she didn&apos;t say it specifically about them, but with a mish-mash of jazz, electro beats, swing, easy listening, metal and grindcore in their songs; Iwrestledabearonce (IWABO) have, without a doubt, created a unique sound in which you have no idea what will happen next.

BritEvents&apos; Lucy Middleton catches up with the band for a quick chat before their Birmingham O2 Academy gig on the 2nd May.
 FEATURE Get loved up for Valentine 2012
