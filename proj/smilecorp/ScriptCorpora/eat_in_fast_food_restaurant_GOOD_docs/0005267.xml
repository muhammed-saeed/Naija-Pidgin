 ★★★★☆ Highly recommended 
 Ann F. 4 Sand Springs Saloon Steakhouse 
 
Sand Springs is a wonderful addition to Frostburg&apos;s restaurant selection, considering its not fast food or a pizza place. If the place is busy, you may have a wait for food. Big deal, go some place else if you do not want to wait. If you don&apos;t know if you will get a seat, make a reservation. Big deal, go to a fast food restaurant if you do not want to bother making a reservation. And if you can&apos;t sit outside but someone is smoking outside, its because there is no smoking in the establishment. The food is great as well as the atmosphere. Cheers to Sand Springs!!

 ★☆☆☆☆ Sandsprings Saloon Steakhouse 
 Joyce W. 1 Sand Springs Saloon Steakhouse 
 
I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. My sister and I ate there for years and were given excellent service, then last year my 70 year old friend and I went there twice, the first time we waited an hour on a Sunday to get our meal, and I had to search for our waitress to get our meal. The next Sunday we were told by a hostess we could not sit at a booth we sat at because it&quot;was reserved&quot;, after she sat us at a table too small for us, but there was no reservation sign on the table, we asked to sit in the dining room and were told no, it was&quot;full&quot;, we asked to sit on the balcony and were told that was closed, so we went to the Tasty Freeze and on our way back someone was standing on the balcony smoking a cigarette. We were told when we left that&quot;we have reservations ladies&quot;, then my sister told me her and her husband go there every Saturday night and don&apos;t need reservations. Obviously this was discrimination.

My co-workers and I dine at Sand Springs for lunch several times a week. We are always pleased with the food and service. The service staff seat us and get our drinks promptly; we are always in and out in a timely manner and the food is great!

 ★★★★☆ Good food - Friendly Service 
 Jeff K. 4 Sand Springs Saloon Steakhouse 
 
Sand Spring is very nice establishment with a local flair. Having put a couple boys through the university we have been coming in frequently over the last few years. Each time seems better than before.

With a full menu of dinner entrees and pub food / sandwiches there is plenty to choose from. The food has always been good, and the service friendly.

It&apos;s a great place to have a good meal at excellent prices and to also sit back, relax and catch a game in the bar.

 ★☆☆☆☆ Horrid Service 
Anonymous 1 Sand Springs Saloon Steakhouse 
 
The service is like a bad high school play: warm, well-meaning and completely inept. The food is ok, but GOD the service cannot even be called service. They seat you and pretty much wander back to the bar to talk to each other.

I really expected more and we were GREATLY disappointed. I will never EVER go back there.

 ★☆☆☆☆ Delusions of Adequacy 
 Lawrence G. 1 Sand Springs Saloon Steakhouse 
 
FIrstly, this establishment was recommended by a colleague of ours at the local university. We arrived at 1:20pm.

The food was so-so, neither overly flavorful nor appetizingly presented.

The service, if you can call it that, was nothing short of appalling. I cannot recall the last time I have felt so ignored in an establishment that, by design, is&quot;supposed&quot;to see to its patrons.

We waited for seating. We waited for our waitress. We waited for our water and coffee. We waited for refills for our coffee. We waited for our menus. We waited for our silverware. Forty-five minutes into our stay, the waitress brought out our salads and, two minutes later, another server brought our entrees. We&apos;d only barely had time to sample our greens when hot on their heels came the main course.

Perhaps it is because the wait staff is densely packed with college students or maybe it was because all 4 of the gentlemen at our table were well-dressed and mature, but we were, nonetheless ignored.

I would not recommend this so-called&quot;saloon&quot;to anyone for any reason, unless it be to inflict retribution for some transgression. Mediocre food and nonexistent service equal a dining experience that might only be parallelled in the cheapest of buffets offering up institutional-quality food.

We have been to this restaurant once and expected it to be much better.It was recommended by hotel staff. But our experience was poor. The service was poor and steaks were not cooked properly.Perhaps it was only our experience,but I would not recommend this restaurant.
