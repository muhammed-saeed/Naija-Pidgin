Or just drop another turd in my burger for confusing them. And I was unaware that big mac&apos;s had a &apos;special sauce&apos; in the first place lol.

 I would like to try one, but I fear the extra attention/work that must be put into explaining and making it would give them a reason to put all kinds of disgusting **** in my food.

 Join Date: Jan 2006 Location: *410 MD 410* Feedback: 39 /0/ 0 ! I get at least one a week. There amazing! If you don&apos;t feel like getting the extra attention just order them seperately and put them together yourself and then you don&apos;t have to worry about them. Hmm I might have to try it with the BigMac sauce, I normally just use some sweet and sour or some buffalo when I&apos;m feeling the spicy mood. __________________

 It literally takes all of 10 seconds to put it together yourself, that&apos;s why I would never order a McGangbang. __________________
