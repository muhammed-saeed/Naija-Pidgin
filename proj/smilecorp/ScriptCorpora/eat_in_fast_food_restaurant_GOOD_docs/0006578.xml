 Year Purchased: 1919 
 Why the Owner Chose Oak Bluffs 

Good location: halfway between the downtowns of Oak Bluffs and Vineyard Haven at 1.7 miles to either. Close to the main roads leading to all Island points. Our home has been in the family since 1919 and the house itself, is thought to be 150+ years old.
 The Unique Benefits at this House 

Access to all Island points and on bus line that runs every 15 mins. most of the day. We leave our car at the house or even on the mainland. It&apos;s about $1 per town and 1-, 3- and 7-day passes, are deeply discounted. These may be purchased onboard any bus. An example of the savings is this: a 1-way to Aquinnah (Gay Head clay cliffs) is $5 or $6, round trip is double, but a one-day pass only costs about $7.00.


Did you know you can fly to the Vineyard? Go online to CapeAir for schedules and rates; and, of course, the Vineyard Transit buses serve the airport, too.

&quot;Eventide&quot;has been in Dana&apos;s family since his great grandfather&apos;s family purchased it almost 100 years ago.

I took an early retirement in 2010 so we could improve our&quot;Eventide&quot;house, making it a better value for our guests.

Our renters are encouraged to make suggestions. We also invite questions at any time.

After 3-years manufacturing turbine blades, Dana began a 34-year career with the Railroad. His interest in nostalgia was fueled by working first, in an 1896 switchtower, which is now a Museum.

Dana&apos;s facsination for older things, such as telephones and our Vineyard house, have resulted in a collection of the former and a restoration of the latter. In fact, he grew up in a Connecticut home, built about 150 years ago.
