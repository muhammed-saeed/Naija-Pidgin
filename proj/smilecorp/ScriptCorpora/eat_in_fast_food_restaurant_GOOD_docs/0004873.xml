 American, Comfort Food/Home Cooking, Seafood, Steak House 
  If you want excellent, fresh seafood at good prices, without goofy frills or pretense, this is the place. It&apos;s a 30 minute drive from our condo in Panama City Beach, but well worth the drive. Where else can you get 2 dozen raw oysters and a pitcher
