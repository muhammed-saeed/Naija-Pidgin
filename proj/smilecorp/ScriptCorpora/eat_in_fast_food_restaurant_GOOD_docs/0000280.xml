 Save On Car Insurance 
 Quick tip of the day to save on car insurance!!! Today I switched my car insurance to paying monthly by electronic withdrawal and received a 10% discount on my rate. Also by paying it through electronic withdrawal from the company, I was able to avoid any month withdrawal charges or service fees. I know that many people use bill pay through their bank or credit union but by doing so, your insurance company will not give you the electronic withdrawal discount. The reason being is that the insurance company is not taking out the funds. So if you use bill pay, contact your insurance company and have it set up on there electronic withdrawal system. It just may save you some money on your car insurance...It did for us!

 One Wreck...Two claims? 
 Continuing with our theme lately about car wrecks and what to do, must share with you what I learned today. Yeah believe it or not it sometimes happens. My good friend came home after work to find his wife waiting by the door with tears in her eyes.

 As he walked in asking her what is wrong she quietly began to explain by saying &quot;Don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s not that bad&quot;. Well any married man knows this is not how you want your wife to begin a conversation with you. She began to explain by taking him out to his beloved black GMC Denali Truck...This can&apos;t be good for any car guy.

 She began to mumble her explanation while pointing at the truck, not hearing a word she said, he noticed not one but TWO big dents and scratches on front and the back of the truck. Well, she explained how fence post mysteriously jumped out behind her when backing up but after hitting it she hit another when pull forward away from the first. With great discuss he walked back into the house speechless.

What does one say to his wife who just wrecked his truck in the driveway with no one around? This is where the lesson begins. He call the insurance company and files a claim, He shows up today to drop off the truck to be repaired and is informed that because his wife hit an object, stopped and pulled forward and hit another that this is actually two claims. WHAT? How can this be? It was just one bad accident. Not accordingly to the insurance company!

The explanation begins the first accident is when his wife hit the first pole. As soon as she stopped and put the truck into drive that accident was over. When she pulled forward and hit the other pole that is accident number two.

Even though they happened only five seconds apart, this means now he must pay two deductibles and his wife&apos;s record will show two accidents.

Lessons to be learned, after an accident don&apos;t make any rush decisions to remove yourself from an embarrassing situation. Second if your wife drives like this, time to buy her an old clunker with dents already included...Oh and watch out for those sneaky fence post.

 MY GIRLFRIEND WRECKED MY CAR!!! 
 First of all, stop screaming! And second, your beloved was just experienced a major trauma, why are you on the internet? 
 
I&apos;m
 going to assume that the answer to that question is because she is safe
 at home with you and now you are trying to put all the pieces back 
together. Well done you. So here&apos;s a couple things you need to know...


First, when your girlfriend drove your car, your 
insurance policy went with her and when she wrecked it, she wrecked it 
under YOUR policy. Not hers. No matter who was driving it, it was still 
covered under your policy when the accident occurred. Think of it this 
way &quot;lend your car, lend your coverage&quot;. It&apos;s your car and no matter who
 is driving it and playing Grand Theft Auto with it, you need to protect
 it.

Second, let&apos;s say that you have managed to trick 
this lovely creature into being with you for several years and she 
drives your car all the time but only now has she decided to smash your 
treasured Geo Metro into a cop car during a high speed chase. At this 
point, the right thing to do would have been to add her to your policy 
BEFORE any of this happened.

And why, you ask?

Because
 adding a driver with a violation to your policy AFTER an accident could
 cause your rates to skyrocket in flight. The purpose of insurance is to
 cover you before something bad happens, that&apos;s why it&apos;s there: to 
protect you in case something bad happens. You lent your car out in good
 faith and you got slapped silly...but as long as you had everything in 
place before, it&apos;s all going to be okay.

 When Insurance Gets Complicated 
 A Few Things You Think Are Covered By Your Insurance... But MIGHT NOT BE!!! 

 Fire Arms 
 That heirloom Colt Single Action Army that Paw-Paw swears gunned down more than a few of the Clantons at the O.K. Corral? It&apos;s not covered under your standard policy. To cover it, you would need to add what&apos;s called a &quot;floater&quot; to your policy. A &quot;floater&quot; is an amendment to your existing policy that would require extensive documentation and even an appraisal to cover the full value of the item. 
 Fine Art 

 So you have that missing Jackson Pollack sitting in your attic? That&apos;s awesome but guess what? Just like your sweet Peacemaker listed above, if you want this covered for it&apos;s full value, an appraisal and everything that goes with it is going to be required. It might end up costing more to cover this thing than you would ever get for it. 
 Jewelry 

 Look, you don&apos;t own the Hope Diamond. And why would you want to? It&apos;s cursed. But this doesn&apos;t need to be anything fancy. Even if it&apos;s simply the engagement ring that you saved all your pennies for, that appraisal needs to happen and should have happened when you bought it. These are necessary, especially for jewelry, to document and insure that you have proper coverage for your fanciest of baubles. 
This is fairly inexpensive coverage to add to your home owners insurance and can even be for as little as ten dollars in premium for every one thousand in coverage per year.

Zombie Apocalypse, Alien Invasion, Interdimensional Monsters, Goblin Attack

 Um...you&apos;re on your own.

 Why Does My Home Insurance Not Match The Value Of My House? 
 Home insurance is all about replacement. If your house gets blown away by a tornado or if it gets incinerated in a fire or demolished by an advancing robot army, your insurance is designed to rebuild your house at replacement cost NOT market value.

 So, let me explain that: your house is worth five hundred grand and so you want it insured at five hundred grand, right? No, not right at all. Insurance companies are not concerned with market value, furthermore, insurance companies aren&apos;t concerned with that land. Should your house be blown up in that robot attack we talked about, the dirt underneath is still there.

A good example would be two similar homes in different neighborhoods. One&apos;s in a fancy, upscale neighborhood and the other is a average Joe&apos;s part of town. Of course, the home in the upscale neighborhood will be valued at more, but the rebuilding costs will be the same no matter what part of town they&apos;re in.

And why is this? Because the PRICE of the materials to rebuild will be the same no matter what the IMPLIED VALUE of the houses may be. Just because you want to live in a 90210 part of town doesn&apos;t mean that your house is actually costs more to replace. Replacement is the name of the game and will be even across the board. The price of lumber is the same on one side of town as the other.

The identical homes in Oklahoma and Malibu may be valued differently but they will relitively cost the same to rebuild. Remember it is all based on replacement cost not market value.

 Car Accident Quick Tips... 
 Here&apos;s five easy things to remember in the event of a car accident :



 Tip 1 : Make sure you keep all your important vehicle information together in a secure place in your car. Rooting through old menus and empty CD cases is really going to drag things out when you can&apos;t find your insurance paperwork. 


 Tip 2 : Make sure you collect ALL of the other driver&apos;s information. Name, phone number, license plate number, insurance company and policy number, anything else you can think of. It seems simple to remember, but often the smallest piece of info can be overlooked and everything just gets more difficult. 


 Tip 3 : In this modern digital age, use technology to your advantage. Take pictures with your camera phone, record anything you can on video. This will help show position of the vehicles, the time of day, the current weather conditions, and even the time of day. Any small piece of information can help expedite your claim. 


 Tip 4 : Gather any witness to the accident. As a bystander to the accident, they will have seen the events take place and will be able to give an impartial account of what happened. Passengers in either vehicle WILL NOT make good witnesses, remember that everyone is right in an argument. 


 Tip 5 : To help speed along the claim process, call in the claim yourself. Don&apos;t hope that the other person will take care of things. If you are struck, make sure to call the insurance company of the other driver yourself to get the ball rolling.
