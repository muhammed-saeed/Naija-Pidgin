 How Our School Did a Food Fundraising Auction 

 A USA Fundraising reader tells us how their school put their own twist on a school auction - and had their most successful fundraising auction to date!
 
Our school&apos;s &quot;Tasty, Delicious Chinese Auction&quot; Fundraiser was our most successful auction yet. The novelty of standard Chinese Auctions wore off when many of our generous donors of gift certificates, 50/50 prizes and table items for auction grew scarce. Fundraisers subsidize our class trips, graduation dances and other needed resources. Our think tank Fundraising Committee was charged with the job of arranging new and different ways to raise funds. Borrowing from ideas of our previous annual Chinese Auctions, we tested a new path to fundraising success.


 

Foodies and Fun Equal A Successful Food Auction
The nice thing about our Tasty, Delicious Chinese Auction was that children, parents and whole community were intrigued and eager to be part of this unusual idea. Some of our organizers collected discount coupons from local restaurants and fast food emporiums for dinners for two and a whole family. There were also vouchers for free pizzas at a local pizzeria and a complete Chinese family dinner at a nearby Chinese Restaurant. These items were used as door prizes. The first-prize winner would get cooking lessons with a major chef.
 
 
 Set The Tables Like They Are Groaning Boards 
Three long cafeteria tables were loaded with items like cookie dough cakes, hand-turned chocolate in whimsical dishes from the local Chocolatier, bags of popcorn and cotton candy secured with balloons and necklaces with strings of lollipops for the kiddies. A second table was filled with cooking items like various types of kitchen gadgets, bouquets of fresh herbs, large beer steins loaded with sticks of beef jerky, pretzels and cellophane-wrapped cheese sticks. On the third table, there was a T-shirt &quot;tree&quot; created from a 36-inch cardboard pole from an empty gift wrap paper tube. Chop sticks pushed through the pole formed hangers from which t-shirts were suspended. To this table was also added hand-sewn aprons, pairs of baking mitts, tea towels and even a chefs cap.


 The Most Popular &quot;Take Home&quot; Food Table 
Two round tables were set aside as featured &quot;take home&quot; food tables. The committee appropriated aluminum containers from local takeout restaurants to fill with homemade chile, Boston baked beans, cole slaw, Buffalo wings and finger sandwiches. Not to be outdone by this, desserts were added to the second round table to display homemade cakes, pies, cookies and sweet quick breads like maple walnut, banana coconut and strawberry kiwi wrapped in cellophane and tied with pretty bows.


Doors Open Promptly And Fun Begins
Each item was numbered as regular Chinese Auctions. Patrons purchased a number of tickets in duplicate, holding onto one and depositing the other in a small container in front of items for each drawing to determine winners.

Food and meal fundraisers always draws people out, because everybody has to eat, and most people end up spending money on fast solutions from time to time. A food fundraising auction gives busy people the option of buying home-cooked meals instead of fast food, and to buy something in support of their favorite organization that will definitely, definitely be used!

 
   
 
 How to Plan a School Fun Run Fundraiser 

 
 How to Plan Your Own School Fun Run 

 Hosting a Fun Run at your school is a great way to get your community involved in raising money for your organization while having fun at the same time. In a traditional Fun Run, students find sponsors to pay them for each lap they are able to run, and students who raise the most money or run the most laps can win prizes for their performance. With the help of your school community, there’s no need to hire an expensive company to coordinate your event. The best part about enlisting help from local volunteers is that your organization will see more of the event’s profits. You’ll also have the freedom to make necessary last minute adjustments without violating any legal agreements or contracts. 

 

 Moran Prairie’s TREK Event 

 The Parent Teacher Group at Moran Prairie Elementary School in Spokane, Washington, has hosted a successful school Fun Run named TREK for 14 years. Over the years, the actual event has evolved to include a DJ, a concessions stand, a mobile pizza booth and a silent auction, generating substantial returns for the organization. The TREK Committee chairs oversee every part of the event and volunteers report directly to them. Planning an event of this scale is a tremendous job for everyone involved, but the amount of money your organization could earn is well worth the time and effort. From sparking community interest to depositing their profit, here’s how they did it: 

 

 Marketing and Preparing for the Event 

 In recent years, the Moran Prairie PTG tapped into the artistic talents of the elementary school students and asked them to create the design for their promotional t-shirts. After choosing the winning design, they worked with t-shirt vendors to place an order for affordable shirts to sell as they promoted the Fun Run. They also offered free t-shirts to students who raised $50 or more in donations. 

 With the help of members and volunteers, the PTG&apos;s TREK Committee canvassed their community and found people willing to provide food donations for their concession stand, prizes for student participants, and free items to sell for profit at their silent auction. One of the teachers fills in as a DJ for the event every year, and the TREK Committee makes sure one of their volunteers is available to assist him before and during the event. 

 The entire TREK Committee works closely with the group’s treasurer to make sure that everyone is on the same page about how the money is handled, organized, and deposited. The PTO TREK Committee has found that delegating separate components of the event to different teams, or sub-committees, reduces the overall stress on the group and ensures that the Fun Run and additional events run smoothly. 

 A new addition in 2011, the TREK Committee has launched a blog and Facebook page to stay in touch and build momentum with everyone who is involved in the event. (Editor&apos;s note: Anyone can set up a blog for their fundraiser using a free blogging service such as www.blogspot.com.)
 

 The Fun Run and Other Activities 

 Since the PTG holds this annual event on a Friday immediately after school lets out, they are able to handle all of the set-up and last minute changes during the school day. One team organizes the Fun Run ensuring that race tags are purchased and available for distribution to the students and that prizes are in place for student participants top finishers, top pledge earners, etc. Another team collects donations, tallies tee shirt orders, and then processes that entire order. Other teams coordinate the music and concessions stand, where the sixth grade students participate by selling items to hungry attendees. 

 One team oversees and coordinates all of the volunteers that are needed on the day of the event. Roughly 60 volunteers are recruited to make this day happen and fill spots as lap markers, water station attendants, pizza booth helpers, silent auction monitors, concessions helpers, race check-out helpers, set-up, tear-down and clean-up helpers. There are even teams that help two days prior to the event to sort and distribute the tee shirt orders as well as process the food donations that come in for the concession stand. 

 Another team coordinates the silent auction by arranging the donated items, organizing and monitoring the bid sheets, and pacing the auctioning of items. While the success of the auction largely depends on the quality of the donated items, some of their best-selling items are actually nontraditional. Last year, they sold a coveted reserved parking space for $300 by increasing the bidding time. 

 When bidders pay special interest to a certain item, the auction team extends the bidding time to allow several people to bid on the same item, resulting in higher bids. When the team is flexible with the pacing, parents have fun with the bidding process and raise even more money for the group. By advertising big ticket items ahead of time, the TREK Committee has been able to increase their attendance and promote the event. In recent years, they’ve even supplemented the auction with a raffle featuring popular items.

(Editor’s Note: The TREK event features a silent auction, but for those interested in conducting a live auction, enlisting a volunteer with auction experience can add a fun and professional tone to the event. Can’t find a professional auctioneer? A local celebrity or comedian could give your auction a lighthearted feel that will entertain participants and generate media interest.)&quot; 

 Moran Prairie’s annual TREK event has been a community fixture for over a decade, and families look forward to spending time together in such a warm and welcoming environment. With careful planning, strong communication, and community support, your organization can host a similar event and raise money for your cause. 
 
   
 5 Safe Alternatives to Door-to-Door Fundraising Sales 

 
Fifty years ago, children were encouraged—in some cases, even required—to make door-to-door sales a central component of their fundraising. Since then, the world has undergone drastic changes. Even if parents know most of the people in their neighborhood, it’s no longer safe for children to approach their neighbors without proper supervision.

In fact, the Association of Fund-Raising Distributors and Suppliers (AFRDS) no longer endorses door-to-door solicitation due to serious concerns for child safety. So how are young students supposed to sell their products and raise money for their schools in the new millennium? Fortunately, there are five safe alternatives to door-to-door sales that are actually more effective.
 
1. Storefront Sales 
Setting up shop in front of a busy store is a great way to ensure a steady flow of foot traffic. Along with the natural flow of customers, your group will also enjoy the benefits of selling in a well-lit area supervised by the store’s own security team. Parents should encourage their children to decorate their sales table and create signs to promote their products. If they are polite and friendly when approaching perspective buyers, their sales are sure to soar.
 
2. Product Parties 
Remember the classic Tupperware parties where neighbors came together to socialize and stock up on plastic containers? The same type of party can breathe life into any fundraiser, allowing parents and children to spend time with their friends while raising money at the same time. The host family can organize icebreakers, games, and snacks to share with the group, and children can raise money in the safety and comfort of their own homes.
 
3. Virtual Fundraising 
Almost everyone is familiar with Facebook and Twitter, and these networks can make it easy for children to fundraise without going door-to-door. Families can post status updates about upcoming sales events and locations. They can also take direct orders online and arrange a time and place to meet for payment. Before you announce the location of a public sale or product party, make sure to check your privacy settings so that you’re comfortable inviting certain people! Aside from Facebook and Twitter, you can also open a free online fundraising store, where the company will deliver the products right to your supporters&apos; doorsteps.
 
4. Festival or Concert Partnership 
Local festivals and concerts are perfect places to set up sales tables. Since these events are likely to be heavily populated, students will always have a steady flow of customers. Curious buyers are bound to take a look at a well-organized and decorated table near the entrance or exit, and it should be easy for children to sell their fundraising products there. Make sure to check with the venue first to see if a sales permit is required.
 
5. Yard Sale Fundraising 
Since people who attend yard sales are ready to shop, why not take advantage of the fiscal atmosphere? Parents should first check with the family hosting the yard sale to see if their children can set up a table nearby. Most families will be happy to have the additional attention. Young students can then make their own signs and sell their products in a fun, well-supervised environment.

 Windshield Washing

 Gift Wrapping

 Chili Cooking Contest 
Encourage people to search for their favorite secret recipes and enter a chili cook-off. Chefs can pay an entry fee to participate and tasters can pay to sample the food. Offer the winning chef a cash prize.
