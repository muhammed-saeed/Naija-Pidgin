Negative effects in eating fast foods

Fast food is often referred to food that is prepared quickly in a restaurant kitchen. Diners order the food and then eat it an inexpensive restaurant or take the food home to eat. Consumption of fast food has many disadvantages including high calories, sodium and fat content. Think carefully when you order from a fast-food restaurant. Look for items that fewer calories and more nutrition.


• Calories---Since fast food is typically deep-fried, it contains tons of calories. Typically, fast food meals contain over 1,000 calories, which is almost half of the recommended daily calorie intake for men and women.


• Saturated and Trans Fats---The oil that fast food is cooked in is often high in trans fat. Saturated fat is found in French fries, cheese, mayonnaise, chicken, and most other fast food products. Consuming too much trans and saturated fat can cause heart disease and high cholesterol.


• Salt---Extra salt is added to fast food to preserve it and add taste. You can consume a whole day&apos;s worth of salt in just one fast food meal. Consuming too much salt can cause high blood pressure and heart disease.


• Lack of Vitamins and Minerals---Fast food is lacking in nutritional value, as it is rarely made of fresh fruits, vegetables or whole grains. By consuming fast food, you are missing out on essential vitamins and minerals to keep you healthy.


• Portion Size---The large portion size of fast food encourages over-eating. Instead of an average sized meal, people consume extra large portions. This leads to obesity and other serious health complications.


• Additives---Flavor, texture, color and palatability in fast food are enhanced by additives. These additives, like sweeteners and colorants, may be extremely harmful to health.


Eating in fast food encourages people to eat on the go. Diners are encouraged to eat quickly and then leave the premises or else you can eat while you are doing something. This is the reason why the appreciation of food is discourage and family can&apos;t communicate while eating. Eating in fast food is acceptable but eating of vegetables and fruits should be your number one priority because healthy eating is very necessary if you wanted to live longer.
