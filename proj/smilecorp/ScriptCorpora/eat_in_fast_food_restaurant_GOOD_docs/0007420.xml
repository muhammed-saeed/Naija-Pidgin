What should you say when you are turning in a job application in fast-food restaurant in order to sound professional?
 In: Management and Strategy , Hiring and Retention [ Edit categories ] 

 Answer: Ask to speak with the Manager. Hand them the application, extend your hand for a handshake, look them in the eye and say, I would really appreciate being considered for the position, if you need any clarification about anything on my application, please don&apos;t hesitate to ask.
Also, it can depend on what position you&apos;re applying for. If it&apos;s NOT a management position, you may want to make yourself stand out, and not be soooo professional buy saying something like:
I think you&apos;ll find my application is &quot;sizzling&quot;. It shows a sense of personality and humor, and the manager will probably remember you over other candidates.
