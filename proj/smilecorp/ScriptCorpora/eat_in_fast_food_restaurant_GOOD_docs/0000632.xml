 I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 08-05-2007 04:28 PM 

That burger with the six strips of bacon from Wendy&apos;s...

I wasn&apos;t all that impressed.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Barry from Athens - 08-05-2007 05:46 PM 

My wife and I joke about the Baconator.

&quot;Two thick slabs of bacon, with bacon-flavored cheese smothering them. Six strips of bacon wrapped around and the whole thing is rolled in bacon bits and fried in bacon grease.&quot;

The name just lends itself so to that kind of exaggeration.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Lizzie - 08-05-2007 05:50 PM 

ew!
Makes me glad Im a vegetarian.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 08-05-2007 06:59 PM 

Well the pictures just imply that its this big ol&apos; burger, but it was anything but... It looked like someone sat on it...

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Lizzie - 08-05-2007 08:00 PM 

and a heart attack on a bun.

I do enjoy their black and white commercial though.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Phil from LI NY - 08-05-2007 08:31 PM 

I&apos;ve had it and didn&apos;t care for it. It was good of course, but nothing special. Now the Bacon Mushroom chedder melt.... thats my favorite. I love that burger.... Wendy&apos;s sucks for never having it.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 08-05-2007 08:46 PM 

I&apos;m allergic to mushrooms, so... can&apos;t quite comment there...

I think the best burger I ever had was at this small town place across from the fairgrounds in Coeur d&apos;Alene, Idaho. It had like two beef patties, four slices of bacon, three slices of ham, pineapple, pickles, ketchup mayo and I think horseradish.

But then there was Burger Heaven in Rathdrum where I grew up, they&apos;ve got a bacon double cheeseburger and fries that are freakin&apos; awesome.

But then I guess the local places are bound to be better than the corporate ones.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Phil from LI NY - 08-05-2007 08:52 PM

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Gary - 08-06-2007 07:03 AM

The description of that burger makes me think of that Meatgasm pizza bumper from Tony.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Lizzie - 08-06-2007 07:51 AM 

*shiver* yick. Thats deffinatley not my kind of pizza

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Gary - 08-06-2007 07:54 AM 

You&apos;re not kidding.
I&apos;ll take some pinnapple or mushrooms, But Ranch dressing? What the heck?

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 08-06-2007 12:25 PM 

I dunno about ranch dressing, but they have this creamy alfredo on chicken and bacon pizza that is SOOOO freakin good.

Actually that with Pinapple sounds really good right now...

Thats what most of my friends say but i dont really like meat either it makes me feel sick all the time.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Brian Brown - 08-06-2007 02:59 PM 

I&apos;m with you Lizzie. I cannot eat red meat and other meat is iffy. Basically the last time I had red meat it made me feel like I had food poisoning. After talking with my mom she mentioned that my grandmother also didn&apos;t eat red meat since it upset her system. *shrug*

So I just avoid it. Safer that way.

So I can have bits of fat stuck in my teeth. After i ate meat I always feel so lethargic, kinda like a mini post- thanksgiving type of feel. Yukk.

Phil, you don&apos;t know the power of the Vegan side.....

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Barry from Athens - 08-06-2007 06:00 PM 

I eat anything that doesn&apos;t eat me first. Around here, that lets kudzu off the list. 

Anyway, I figure everyone eat what you like. Just so long as you try new things periodically.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 08-06-2007 08:00 PM 

I have difficulty eating vegetables... And I prefer my meat red, but not as red as people from Guam do... I&apos;ve had two Chomoro friends who eat there meat barely seared and still bleeding and insist it be done that way. Thats going a little far I think.

They had raw stakes in one episodeof B5. In the comentary for B5 they talk about how they even made the actors eat them raw for real.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 08-06-2007 11:32 PM 

They got this place here in Spokane called Dicks. (all though the locales call it Che Rishards) You can get a little double cheeseburger for$1.25 and a large fry for 83 cents. Their onion rings and chocolate malt shakes are really good too.

Man this is making me hungry.

I think we just created the thread of perpetual burger hunger.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Phil from LI NY - 08-07-2007 12:53 AM 

I got this place maybe 20 minutes from me called All American. Honestly, there is nothing special about there burgers, they&apos;re just amazing. Just big greasy cheese burgers. There great. Maybe I&apos;ll make a trip there this weekend and eat it during the live recording of wingin it. Thats if i&apos;m around for it.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 08-07-2007 05:54 PM 

Ok so what constitutes the perfect burger? For me it&apos;s two patties, two slices of American or block sliced cheddar cheese, fried ham and like four slices of bacon, hard and crispy not limp like the franchise places. I&apos;m not big on vegies but I&apos;ll take lettuce if it is sufficiently shredded and as lots of good mayo. And not oily mayo, that creamy kind thats almost cream cheese. (and sometimes cream cheese is good on it too) I&apos;m not huge on ketchup but I&apos;ll take it in moderation. Definitely against mustard. And the bun needs to be light, fluffy and not dry. I hate buns that suck up all my condiments. And the patties shouldn&apos;t be overly greasy but tender, not dry or anything. There should be just enough seasoning to taste the pepper, and that&apos;s it.

I know, I&apos;m real original. But that to me is the perfect burger. 

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Phil from LI NY - 08-08-2007 12:03 AM 

For me... forget the patties. Fresh chopmeat, mozzarella, basil, choped onions, a drop of oil, mix it all up into burger style... throw it on a charcol BBQ. The charcol is on one side with lots of mesquite wood chips to smoke the shit outta the burger. Toasted buns, a little lettuce, a slice of tomato, a slice of cheedar and maybe a little Peter Luger steak sauce, very light.

Yeah.. I think you completely missed your mark on the &quot;could have had some depth&quot;... the minute you and Phil went all Elf fanboy and tossing in the whole &quot;Dwarves SUCK!&quot; bit.

Meatgasm - 2 1/2 pounds of MEAT AND CHEESE! Ranch dressing instead of pizza sauce, and a smattering of hot wings on top of it all!

Here&apos;s the Japanese version! Pizza death 

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Phil from LI NY - 08-09-2007 09:55 AM 

Its only the truth Brian.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 08-09-2007 12:53 PM 

What!?!? We can have a conversation about hamburgers that has depth!

For instance, what do you guys think of Angus beef? My personal opinion is that it tastes like ass, and I don&apos;t understand why it&apos;s more expensive.

And Brian, for your information I&apos;m eating a salad right now. With 2 pounds of sliced turkey and roast beef, a mound of olives and probably a couple pounds of sliced colby cheese. And half a bottle of creamy lemon poppyseed dressing.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Phil from LI NY - 08-09-2007 01:17 PM 

Angus beef, is seriously over rated. I never understood why it gets so much hype. So i&apos;m in agreement with you Mr. shack.

Now thats a man&apos;s Salad!

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 08-15-2007 12:21 PM 

What about best pizza?

We&apos;ve got a take and bake place called Papa Murphy&apos;s, chances are its all over, but their Chicago Style Chicken and Bacon stuffed pizza is amazing. Papa John&apos;s is pretty good too but expensive. The only local place I can think of thats decent is this place called Pizza Rita, their toppings are good and fresh and are insane with the amount of it, but I think they go overboard with the sauce.

It is a food group in our house 

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 08-15-2007 09:19 PM 

Pizza was a real luxury in our house when I was a kid... Despite the fact my mom worked at a pizza place. My dad is a beef person. And it has to be burnt with no seasoning what so ever.

I was deprived as a child.

Sometimes I really get a craving for those thin crust 99 cent party pizzas, those are really good too.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Gary - 08-15-2007 09:27 PM

Or maybe it&apos;s the result of bacterial growth. 

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Gary - 08-16-2007 07:47 PM

Almost perfect. Just add fresh squeezed OJ, and we will be set.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Brian Brown - 08-20-2007 04:08 PM 

So this weekend, Doug the Trivia guy, introduced us to a Raclette Grill. We had a great Sunday brunch at Mike&apos;s.

Here&apos;s an example of it....
 http://www.amazon.com/Swissmar-KF-77041-Gourmet-8-Person-Raclette/dp/B0000635XW 

The process is pretty simple. Slice up some raclette cheese, put it into the small trays, wait until it bubbles and pour the cheese over stuff. Stuff being defined as ham, boiled eggs, bread, potatoes, brocolli, cauliflower and the like. MMMMM!

It was damn good with the mimosas. It was a good weekend!

Huh. So it&apos;s like a new-age fondue pot. Did you guys throw your keys in the goldfish bowl afterwards and go home with an experiment? heheh

That does sound interesting though. Is there like a special kind of cheese you use? I&apos;m a big fan of cheese but I&apos;ll admit there are times when drowing my food in it is too much for me to handle.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Barry from Athens - 08-20-2007 06:04 PM 

What the heck is a raclette? Must be some west coast thing because I&apos;ve never heard of it here on the other side of the country.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 08-20-2007 07:30 PM 

Well it appears to be a cross between a skillet and a fondue pot. You&apos;ve got several containers of heated cheese in the bottom and a skillet on the top. It appears to me that you grill meat and stuff on the top and then drop it in the cheese and eat it.

At least thats what I&apos;m guessing, I&apos;ve never seen one either... And I *am* on the West coast...

Well it&apos;s kinda fondue like... but you really POUR the cheese over stuff on your plate instead of dipping.

We were using raclette cheese. Here&apos;s a good wiki article about it.
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raclette 

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 08-21-2007 12:41 PM 

Wow. So can you describe the flavor of the cheese? It says its kind of salty, is it overly salty? Is it sharp like cheddar or smooth like Colby?

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Brian Brown - 08-21-2007 02:39 PM 

Smooth. It&apos;s a bit pungent but not overly so. So I would suggest doing a grilling of this OUTSIDE otherwise your couch will probably have a funk to it, and it won&apos;t be because of your swamp ass! 

I would say the cheese, when melted down, is similar to a swiss but less tangy? More like a melted Mozzarella? I would suggest going to a store like Whole Foods and going to their cheese department and asking to try some!

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 08-21-2007 04:33 PM 

As far as I know we don&apos;t have a whole foods up here... We have a Huckleberrys natural market though that tends to carry some hard to find foods, I&apos;ll check them out.

 20 Hamburgers to Eat before you Die. 

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 08-22-2007 10:18 PM 

I was a Burger King Manager for seven years. That pretty much sums that question up.

But honestly, some of that shit I was planning on using for Wingin&apos; It content. Such as the time I had to fire a guy because he forgot to prep salads and a lady had a heart attack waiting for her food. And then the time I got robbed and put the guy in prison for three years for stealing my cookies.

Yeah I got a lot of stories, pretty much all of them bad, and I think most of them funny.

All though worst experience outside of that job... For some reason on our wedding day my wife and I stopped at Wendy&apos;s on the way to the park where we were getting married. Our food was so rancid we had the shits all through the ceremony. That rises to the top I think because it effected both of us on pretty much the most important day of our lives...

I threw up.

well he byfriend who has no shame picked it up and studied it. he confirmed it. but all I knwo is taco bell is not the place for me.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Geistbear - 08-23-2007 09:00 AM 

While I was working in DC PepsiCo corporate said they would buy this office I worked for dinner...anything in their lineup, our choice. This office worked alot of late evenings and often had food brought in, we got pizza pretty often so we didn&apos;t want pizza hut, likewise we had fried chicken fairly often so KFC didn&apos;t sound appealing. We fiqured Taco Bell, they might have to send it in trays and we&apos;d self assemble and have to use chaffing dishes, but it sounded like something different we&apos;d enjoy. PepsiCo refused saying basicly they didn&apos;t trust their food. We even suggested they could bring in staff to supervising if they were concerned and it came down to that they simply didn&apos;t trust their own food.

Now I wasn&apos;t ever much of a Taco Bell person, but after that I never ate in one again. If they don&apos;t trust their own food why should I?

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Ed from Texas - 08-23-2007 11:05 AM 

There was (probably still is actually) a place in College Station called Fat Burger. Don&apos;t know why, but they were the best tasting burgers.

Problem was, about 25% of the time, we&apos;d get sick from them. We swear off the place for a few months, but eventually the craving overwhelmed us and we&apos;d go back again.

Hmmm, it&apos;s only a couple of hour drive....wonder if they&apos;re still open.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 08-23-2007 12:42 PM 

I think the worst service I ever had was at Pizza Pipeline. And normally I give these kids slack for the dickheads who come in and order and then bitch about this that and the other thing and say shit like &quot;It&apos;s not like your job is that hard.&quot; They&apos;re precisely the reason why its that hard.

But this one time we went to Pizza Pipeline and ordered like two pizzas and a desert pizza, and there were like four other customers waiting, and a few delivery orders and there were like three employees there. We waited like 45 minutes, and these three employees are just being vulger and cussing and swearing the whole time, and not the funny kind of vulgar that we do but the stupid too young to know what this shit is kind. And I&apos;ve got a clear view of the back and I see our pizzas rolling out of the oven... And collecting on the end... And then rolling down onto the floor.

And the kicker is I see one of the guys walk over like ten minutes later, step in the pizza and walk away. Then come back five minutes later, look at the pizzas on the ground, then look around like he&apos;s trying to see who&apos;s watching, sees me and goes &quot; I guess we should cook another pizza.&quot;

You GUESS?!?

We were in that place a total of three hours. Haven&apos;t been back since.

It&apos;s not as good with brown rice instead of white, though.

Am I the only one worried about where this is going? Oh well I blame Gary if only he had stayed he could have kept this forum on track now it is to derailed ever save.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Alanfromtheuk - 09-01-2007 05:38 AM 

Ermmm. Well what can I say really. Phil. Lacey Chabert, Yeah I see that, she&apos;s hot.


Now Dub........ Why not look for someone who&apos;s legal to wear a near-catholic school girl outfit. And BTW, most schools over here have a similar style of uniform.

As to Emma Watson. Isn&apos;t she legal now? I could have sworn I heard she was.


**EDIT**

Emma Charlotte Duerre Watson was born in France on April 15, 1990, so she&apos;s 17 and technically legal. Here in the UK anyway.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 09-01-2007 10:37 AM 

Oh for goodness sake people. It&apos;s not about sex. It&apos;s not about age. it&apos;s about... Good god I&apos;ve forgotten what it&apos;s about.

Oh yeah. Hamburgers.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Phil from LI NY - 09-01-2007 11:58 AM 

Alan, in the states, your considered legal at 18, so thats why I said underage for Emma... she really is a cute girl, hopefully she gets hotter and sweeter with age.

As for Lacey... If nobody like her... thats good, more Lacey for me. Oh look its time for me to wake up...

 RE: I ate a Baconator - horsesboy - 09-01-2007 12:17 PM 

Phil it is all about the hamburgers so get back on subject.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Phil from LI NY - 09-01-2007 01:02 PM

Before we go back to food, lets just look at another photo of Lacey Chabert...AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!

OMG, WHY AM I A HUMAN WASTE LAND???

I can&apos;t help the fact that I think shes so sultry and amazingly sweet...

 

 RE: I ate a Baconator - horsesboy - 09-02-2007 09:10 AM 

Phil back to Burgers.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 09-02-2007 01:54 PM 

The bacon was crispier this time. Though it was a bit much.

Lacey Chabert... Meh.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Lizzie - 09-02-2007 03:08 PM 

Today on the ride back form my trip my mom was hungry so we went to the wendy&apos;s I tried to convince her to get a baconater just so I could see someone actually eat it. She said no. So I got the satisfaction in seeing the car in front of us get 4 burgers becuase the guy giving them the food basically screamed their order back to them.

It was a great moment,

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Phil from LI NY - 09-02-2007 03:33 PM 

Did you get a Baconator Lizzie?

And Dub... I like crispy bacon.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Lizzie - 09-02-2007 03:37 PM 

Im a vegetarian, remember.
I just wanted to see one becuase its fascinating how some one can fit it in they moutha nd finish it.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Phil from LI NY - 09-02-2007 03:46 PM 

OOO, thats right I forgot.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 09-02-2007 07:56 PM 

Seriously though, the burger is freakishly small compared to how they portray it. I&apos;d say its like 3 inches in diameter and maybe and inch thick. Its really a pathetic burger for what they make it out to be.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Phil from LI NY - 09-02-2007 07:59 PM 

You remember the rodeo burger from Burger King... now thats small.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Lizzie - 09-02-2007 08:02 PM 

Some one should sue fast food stores for false advertising! Liek the lady who sued McDonalds becuase there was no warning on the coffee cup. Make them put a disclaimer that says &quot;Warning: Food shown in this commercial make not actually eb as large or as tastey looking in real life&quot;

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Phil from LI NY - 09-02-2007 08:07 PM

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 09-02-2007 09:49 PM 

Oh you bastard. I can&apos;t believe you said that.

Do you realize how much I miss the rodeo burger? Damn.

Oh what am I saying. It was basically a really small version of the Western bacon cheeseburger from Carls Junior. Unfortunately I&apos;ve got to cross state or county lines to get one.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - horsesboy - 09-02-2007 10:05 PM

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Lizzie - 09-02-2007 10:21 PM

Your lucky because DHL doesn&apos;t get nearly the amount of volume that UPS does. And with peak season(xmas) coming up, we&apos;re probably going to be putting out 100-150 thousand a night. At least i&apos;ll be getting a lot of over time.

Alas, I had to make due with Mickey D&apos;s and Dairy Queen for burgers while at the Con. I made a deliberate choice to not have a vehicle (which was actually rather nice), so that limited mobility to the food court near the Con hotels.

So kind of back the burger thing who has the best chicken smawichs personly I love Wendy&apos;s Spicy Chicken one come to think of it I love spicy chicks to but thats for another time or is who know with this trend.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Ed from Texas - 09-04-2007 09:47 PM 

I am ethically opposed to chicken sandwiches. beef for burgers and ham for sandwiches. Anything else just won&apos;t do.

But, that&apos;s just me.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 09-04-2007 11:03 PM 

Wendy&apos;s has the best quality breast for their spicy chicken but I dislike the quality of their bun and the low quantity of mayo. I had a spicy chicken from Carls Junior the other night and it was pretty good, as far as spiciness and mayo quantity vs bun. The regular chicken sandwhich and the new one they came out with from Burger King are pretty good. I think the spicy chicken from Jack in the Box is best, that is as far as currently on the market, considering actual chicken breast, spice amount and mayo vs bun amount.

I think the best one that ever came out, even though it was processed chicken, was the spicy chicken sandwich from Burger King. I haven&apos;t seen it in probably ten years. the chicken itself had a spicy crust, and it had this creamy chipotle mayo sauce that was just insanely good. I could eat a dozen of these things. (well... before my wheat allergy anyway)

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Gary - 09-05-2007 04:22 AM 

I really think the chipolte mayo sauce is the secret to the great taste of that sandwich.
I&apos;ve have it on fish often at a local resturant. Good stuff.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Lizzie - 09-05-2007 06:59 AM

Otherwise, I really like Chik-fil-A&apos;s.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Gary - 09-05-2007 08:29 AM 

I&apos;m really enjoying all the good mexican resturants that are popping up lately.
( No, I do not mean Taco Bell)
Although it seems to be at the expense of Italian ones.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 09-05-2007 11:42 AM 

Wow, speaking of Mexican...

There is a chain here in Spokane/Coeur D&apos;Alene called Case De Oro, and oh my god their food is so good. The manager is almost always drunk and tends to replace my Roy Rogers with ice tea, but other than that their meats are so tender and juicy and the cheeses are so great, and the beans and rice actually have flavor to them... Man. If it weren&apos;t for them my wheat allergy would drive me insane.

I like the flat bread better. though one grande is filling where I can usually eat 2 of their normal quesadillas.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Lizzie - 09-05-2007 08:10 PM 

Back to food.

What are your condiment choices.
I love Honey Mustard, mayo, ketchup, soy sauce and ceasar dressing.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 09-05-2007 08:28 PM 

It depends on what you&apos;re talking about.

If it&apos;s a burger I really only care for mayo, and occaisonaly a little ketchup.

Chicken sandwich... Never more than one condiment, but mayo, ranch, honey mustard, chipotle mayo, horseradish...

Soy sauce or worsctisher seems to go best cooked in hamburger meat.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Lizzie - 09-05-2007 08:31 PM 

I love soy sauce with sushi and stir fry or wiht white rice.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - horsesboy - 09-05-2007 09:54 PM

Just because she&apos;s legal doesn&apos;t make it right. Although if we were all a decade or two in the futere the age difference wouldn&apos;t seem as bad.

You usually get about 8-12 nuggets in an order.

(actually I&apos;m sick as hell and don&apos;t want them catching anything, or giving me more, whatever this is) There&apos;s a chinese place down the road that delivers, I&apos;m tempted to order and tell them to deliver it to the bedroom window...

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Gary - 09-08-2007 09:27 AM

Monday&apos;s menu includes my first attempt at flarn.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Barry from Athens - 09-08-2007 09:58 AM 

I eat in almost every night and bring in my lunch almost every day. We go out Fridays and I treat myself to lunch on days I have to teach a morning lab.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Phil from LI NY - 09-09-2007 11:46 AM 

Instead of fighting, how bout we split it. We&apos;ll give the coffee beans to Gary.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Lizzie - 09-09-2007 12:10 PM 

I love coffee too!
I love getting chocolate covered espresso beans from starbucks but as long as i get a piece of cake im happy!

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Phil from LI NY - 09-09-2007 12:34 PM 

This is a perfect meal for any guy... women won&apos;t like it.... maybe some, but most won&apos;t.

Back on topic.
Why don&apos;t they offer chicken omlettes?
They put just about any other type of meat with eggs.
Is it some taboo that people don&apos;t want to cross?

 RE: I ate a Baconator - horsesboy - 09-10-2007 09:57 AM 

I thought you did not eat meat so what do you care? Thre was a place that had some here but the tasted horible and almost never sold so I gues thats why.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Phil from LI NY - 09-10-2007 11:15 AM 

Chicken isn&apos;t considered meat horsesboy.

Speaking of omlettes.... I haven&apos;t had one in ages.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Lizzie - 09-10-2007 11:38 AM 

Chicken is poultry but it is still considered off limits by vegetarians.
Its just white meat to me.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Phil from LI NY - 09-10-2007 11:44 AM

Don&apos;t be afraid to try something different. A good B5 mantra to live by.

Shows how much you know. it was great. Everyone in the house thought it was good, and loved the fact that it came from the cook book.

As I was enjoying my meal I realized it might have been even better with a horseradish/mustard dipping sauce.
But then I would have had to start all over again. LOL

We should have ordered something really greasy and cheesy at Dragoncon in rememberance of this topic. Our mistake. 

Maybe we can keep the thread going till the pool party and all go out for Baconators. Or something equally bad for us.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Lizzie - 09-11-2007 05:43 PM 

I just want to say somthing about food and how disgusting it is at school cafeteria.
We have been changing the way we distribute ketchup the past 3 years my freshamn year there were two bowls wiht ladels in them, sophomore we got squirt bottles. Later a company came and took over our cafeteria, made it better and added ketchup and mustard dispensers. NOw my junior year we have the squirt bottles rarley and ketchup in packets that yesterday tasted like alchohol(its burned your tongue at the touch) and today it tasted like barbecue sauce!

SOMTHING IS SERIOUSLY WRONG HERE!

 RE: I ate a Baconator - dqbiggerfam - 09-11-2007 08:38 PM 

Heh, we got served Barchettas some days. Similar do a spicy(almost too spicy for me, but that&apos;s not hard) deep dish pizza, you could wring it out and get a puddle of grease then eat it. Never underestimate the crappy food from a food service. If you even get decent food, it&apos;s a blessing. I went to a tech school that had a culinary class. Best cafeteria food I&apos;d had in along time.

No, not that long, 7 years. I just did not like school. Plus my school was full of asshole&apos;s and such. Some of those idiot&apos;s still act like there still there, not growing up. I like it when they call people saying something stupid like, &quot;YO! Lets go to the park tonight and get WASTED.&quot; After I use a certain amount of colorful words, I usually tell them to STFU and get a life... job or something.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Gary - 09-12-2007 05:12 AM 

Back in high school they didn&apos;t even provide us with containers. We&apos;d either have to pump it on to the food, or into a corner of the tray.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Lizzie - 09-12-2007 05:47 AM 

Thats still the same for us ketchup goes where ever you can put it. But iwill never get over the traumatizing &apos;Ketchup in a bowl&quot; and ladeling it on my tray plu si was third lunch so who knows what was actually in it.

And we spelled it catsup!

We were so poor we had to take two pieces of bread, and wish we had tomatoes in between.

Generic ketchup sucks!

So you all know how Kerry&apos;s wife is heir to the HEINZ fortune.
Well in 8th grade i learned this and my teacher found BUSH ketchup at his local supermarket so he bought and showed it off to our class. then we had a heated debate about why Bush decided to make his own ketchup brand.

I still can&apos;t figure how it was up hill both ways, but it was.
I also had to cross a river.
Not too bad before a rain, but after a mess. (This is New Jersey we&apos;re talking about.)
I hated the wet/frozen socks most of all.

Checkers! I love there fries!

Checkers also has great apple pies.
They&apos;re like McDonalds used to make with the crisp outside covering.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - horsesboy - 09-13-2007 02:04 PM 

I like McDondals but I think Boardwalk is probly the best of them all. Burger king is the worst as far as fries go.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Lizzie - 09-13-2007 04:25 PM

Oh and as long as the fries are crunchy but not over done and they taste right. IM happy and IM even happier if their curly fries.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Barry from Athens - 09-13-2007 05:21 PM 

Checkers does have pretty good fries. I like seasoned fries when I allow myself to get some.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Ed from Texas - 09-13-2007 08:17 PM 

Well, I&apos;ve never heard of Checkers (East coast thing?) but down here, Fuddruckers makes some tasty fries.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 09-13-2007 08:35 PM 

I&apos;ve never heard of Checkers either. It&apos;s kind of debatable to me who has the best fries around here. Wendy&apos;s are pretty good on their own. I agree on Burger King being the worst. They used to have the best until people complained that there was salt in the coating. (stupid no salt people) I had some awesome steak fries with my prime rib at Black Angus a couple days ago. Other than that we&apos;ve got a local franchise called Zips that are pretty damn good, not just fries but burgers too.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - horsesboy - 09-13-2007 09:39 PM 

No they have come on the west coast to here is the link. http://www.checkers.com/find.html you have not lived till you try there food.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Brian Brown - 09-13-2007 10:24 PM

 Phil from LI NY Wrote: Wow, a few who never heard of Checkers. I believe they started in Florida and over the past several years have been branching out. 

They&apos;re a little drive thru place that&apos;s become more widespread because they don&apos;t take up much space. Drive thrus on both sides of the building (need a passenger in the car to use one of them, as I found out the hard way).

Cheap and tasty (not to be confused with Big and Tasty) and slapped together when you order, I think.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Gary - 09-14-2007 06:08 AM

It&apos;s much easier to get the food and drinks without a steering wheel in the way.

We don&apos;t have Crystal burgers, White Castle is all over the place though.

Plus as someone who doesn&apos;t eat meat I don&apos;t have to worry.
I know that can&apos;t really be meat in those things.

Sonic has kick ass drinks and great burgers, and their motz sticks aren&apos;t too bad, and I do like their tots, but their fries don&apos;t really stand out.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Phil from LI NY - 09-14-2007 10:11 PM 

The only time I ever saw a Sonic was when I was in Vegas. There was one behind the Rio, the hotel I was at, but I never got a chance to go there.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Knucle01 - 09-15-2007 06:11 AM

&quot;Come visit your local Sonic&quot;

there isn&apos;t one damnit!!!

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Gary - 09-15-2007 07:10 AM 

For those who don&apos;t know, Sonic is modeled after the old 50&apos;s drive in&apos;s

You pull into a parking spot, and order into a speaker, and the food gets delivered to your car

Why not? Are you blind? They do have braile menus available.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 09-15-2007 09:37 AM 

If you&apos;re seeing commercials for one then you&apos;ll likely be getting one in your area within a year. That happened here in Spokane, we just got our first one a year ago. They&apos;ll put it in the highest traffic center they can find, on the smallest plot of land available, and then for three months you&apos;ll have massive traffic problems around that area. So don&apos;t expect to be able to actually try Sonic until six months after its built.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Alanfromtheuk - 09-15-2007 09:53 AM 

THey put it in the highest traffic area because that&apos;s likely to get them the most customers.

They&apos;ll put it in the highest traffic center they can find, on the smallest plot of land available, and then for three months you&apos;ll have massive traffic problems around that area. So don&apos;t expect to be able to actually try Sonic until six months after its built. 

Not quite true I have been seeingthem for at least two years and the closes on is at least 30 mins away and depending of trafic wait what am I say in this area if trafic is bad I would be lucky to get there be the end of the world.

Does Dairy Queen count?

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Phil from LI NY - 09-17-2007 12:40 PM 

Carvel had some great shakes.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - horsesboy - 09-17-2007 02:02 PM 

Why not count Dairy Queen. What is Carvel Phil?

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 09-17-2007 06:04 PM 

Locally I&apos;m pretty sure everyone would agree that Zips has the best shakes. But then pretty much any local restaurant has better shakes than the franchises. Burger Heaven in Rathdrum, Idaho has great shakes. (and around here we have a lot of local huckleberry picking so huckleberry shakes are common) Amongst the franchises I&apos;m gonna say Jack and the Box and Arby&apos;s are the best, though I haven&apos;t had one (oddly enough) from Sonic. (actually not so odd, I can&apos;t get through the drive thru there without ordering a cherry slush or a cherry limeade-good god thats good stuff)

Can&apos;t say I&apos;ve ever had one from Dairy Queen either. I always end up ordering ice cream from there, though once I ordered a burger and it was pretty good.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Gary - 09-17-2007 06:24 PM 

I guess our regional differences are begining to show in this thread.
Let me share what knowledge I have.

Dairy Queen - Sometimes an ice cream store, sometimes a fastfood resturant with ice cream. Location Nationwide

Carvel - Ice Cream store. Better than Baskin Robbins.Look for their Ice cream cakes in your local food store. Located in the North East.

Jack in the Box - Fast food resturant. Similar to Burger King. Located in the Western US. Abandoned East Coast 20+ years ago.(Yes I&apos;m bitter.)

Hardees and Carl Jr. - Fast food resturants. Identical except for name. Location Hardees Eastern US. / Carl Jr. Western US

Arby&apos;s - Fast Food resturant. Focus on Roast Beef. Location - Nationwide

Sonic - Please read the thread.

Zips - Unknown. Location Dubshack Universe.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Phil from LI NY - 09-17-2007 08:44 PM 

Wow, i&apos;m suprised Carvel isn&apos;t all over.

Arby&apos;s is pretty limited around here. I do recall there&apos;s an Arby&apos;s in Queens, but I don&apos;t make it out there...

Let me add that Five Guys which came up a while ago is a semi fast food Resturant now chain that started in Northern Va and has location in seral east coast states now. It was founded by five bothers and is famous for there fires and burgers. Eat there if you get a chance.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 09-17-2007 09:31 PM 

Zips is a massive local chain, they have something like fifty stores between Spokane and Coeur d&apos;Alene alone. Everytime a fast food place closes a Zips replaces it. Sometimes three blocks apart. I&apos;m totally serious.

Zips has been rated the top fast food restaurant in this area for the last five years. They started well over 30 years ago (I dunno when they came about, I just remember they&apos;ve been here longer than me) and they fell out of favor between the late 80&apos;s until 2003-4 or so when they just freaking exploded. Their biggest burger is called The Boss, is three patties with four or five slices of cheese, mayo, lettuce, tomato, three slices of bacon, two slices of ham, and god damn it I&apos;m hungry now...

Probably Zips&apos; most popular attraction has been it&apos;s &quot;bag o&apos; burgers,&quot; five cheeseburgers for five bucks. Nowadays they sell it with a bucket of fries for 7.99. They&apos;re kind of mid range pricing wise, but their food really is excellent for a fast food place.

As for Jack in the Box being like Burger King.... Eh, no. Not even remotely close, there isn&apos;t a single similarity between the two besides the fact that both are fast food and they both serve burgers. Having worked at both, BK for seven years and Jack in the crack for two weeks, I can tell you that BK and Carls Junior are pretty much the same as far as cooking methods (both use a flame broiler, which by the way cleaning causes serious scarring of limbs) but Carls has a more expansive menu. I&apos;ve never worked at Carls though so I don&apos;t know how their employee/operational map goes but from people I knew who worked there I understand thats similar as well. Jack in the box is just completely different, from the structuring of their crew and shifts, operation of the kitchen, method of cooking and menu. (which is also more expansive then Burger King)

Incidentally, there is a reason why it takes so long for you to get your food at JB, and it isn&apos;t because they&apos;re cooking it fresh. It&apos;s because their setup prohibits any sort of cooperation between crew members in the kitchen. It&apos;s strictly a one man operation. Where as in say BK or McDs you can slap a guy in each position, cooking meat, making sandwiches, wrapping, etc, JB just has one guy in the kitchen who goes from cooking meat to making sandwiches to wrapping and handing to you. (Incidentally, removing any stop gap against cross contamination, those same unwashed hands that pulled the meat out of the freezer and slapped it on the grill handled your bread and wrapped your burger too) JB does have a meat heater for rushes to help keep with demand, but the general rule is to not use it. That said when it is used I can tell you that dry pattie you just bit into has been sitting there for three hours. (not that BK and McDs is different, but at least there system can keep meat moist for up to four hours) There is another position, the &quot;Frying and specialty items&quot; position where a guy fries fries, egg rolls, chicken patties, fish (all in the same vats mind you, and you wondered why your fries tasted funny?) and makes salads, cheese potatoes and if they still have them those rice bowls...

And the killer is, having almost been sued out of existence years ago for that massive ecoli outbreak, Jack in the Box still manages to remain the WORST offender of food safety laws in the Pacific Northwest, if not everywhere. They are hands down the filthiest restaurants, continue to promote unsafe food handling, and their average retention is somewhere around 300%.

Now don&apos;t get me wrong. I hate Burger King and what that job did to me. But dear lord, people who eat at Jack in the Box (like my wife) are just plain fucking insane. It&apos;s like gambling with your life.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Phil from LI NY - 09-17-2007 11:42 PM 

Never heard of 5 Guys, Zips or Jack in the box...

Are you sure you guys are from planet Earth? Cuz I can&apos;t finda any middle ground here. Except the original topic starter... The Baconator, lol.

Seriously, I don&apos;t understand this thing about Black Angus meat, but unless it comes from the actual restaurant, it tastes like shit.

Since moving to Florida I&apos;ve been exposed to grits. This is the most nasty breakfest food known to me. In an attempt to make it edible, they try to add one or more of the following, in no particular order, sugar, butter, syrup,ketchup, tabasco and even melted ham fat. I still don&apos;t think it helps. 

Well Gary I guese you are a bonifide southern red neck now.

Fries with mozzarella and brown gravy? Wow. There&apos;s a concept I&apos;ve missed.

As for breakfast foods... I haven&apos;t found one I can stand. I used to love bagels till my wheat allergy. Gluten free bagels are about the nastiest things on the planet. Sadly my breakfasts now consist of a cheese wiener and a cherry coke.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - ditto - 09-23-2007 12:49 PM 

You&apos;ll like it, trust me. 

And it&apos;s easy enough to make. If you can&apos;t get cheese curds, then mild cheddar or even mozzarella is fine. Good fries are a must, otherwise you end up with even mushier fries.

Have any of you had Mongolian BBQ? Good lord I miss that. Its basically an all you can eat bar (typically) where you take one or two bowls and fill them with all the uncooked noodles, meats, vegitables and sauces you can and hand them to a guy who plops it on this huge grill/table and he cooks it, slaps it on a plate and hands it back to you. It&apos;s impossible not to walk away without a bloated feeling at these places. They fill you and then some. My favorite is called Hu Hot, but there&apos;s only one of them that I know of...

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Gary - 09-24-2007 01:38 AM 

I&apos;ve had it. I love watching them cook on that round grill. It&apos;s like fantastic Chinese with none of the disadvantages.

Oh, speaking of avoiding sodas - I&apos;ve been soda free for about two months. I had gone to diet soda a couple of years ago, but I&apos;ve read even that is pretty hard on the body with all the acid.

So, I&apos;ve been drinking Kool Aid (yea yea, joke away). The real sugar free seems to be hard to find. But, Splenda has started making a pack specially forumulated for use with mixing in Kool Aid. Makes for a much better drink than the nutrasweet based sugar free Kool Aid.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 09-25-2007 06:47 PM 

Tempura in my book is mostly corn starch, with a fourth of the flour, baking soda, water and oil.

A long time ago I added curry powder and that made it pretty good too.

I think here in the US jam has a diiferent texture than jelly does. PLus we have all these major companies that make jelly.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - ditto - 09-30-2007 09:25 AM 

I love chili too. I love how it can be a unique expression. It can be red or green. It can be made with tofu, beans, poultry, beef, or pork. It can be incredibly hot, or even sweet. It can even be made with chocolate. You can make chili out of almost anything.

Hm. I&apos;ve made myself hungry.

I like both, sweet chili that burns a hole in your mouth. Especially with Louisiana hot sausage and chunks of steak in it. Then mix in some shredded cheese and sour cream and dip tortilla chips in it. Oh my god is that the best or what.

I love chili also. I agree with Ditto, that there should be some sweetness and tang and a kick.

They had a chili cookoff at Stone Mountain Park outside Atlanta yesterday. I wish I could have attended.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Brian Brown - 09-30-2007 07:58 PM 

I&apos;m a fan of a spicy chili. I&apos;ve not had a sweet chili?

So this weekend was plagued with very average food. The best thing I ate was at Joe&apos;s Crab Shack. Crab stuffed shrimp! Good stuff!

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Gary - 09-30-2007 08:09 PM 

Do the waiters randomly dance at all Joe&apos;s crab shacks?

I get to watch women dance, don&apos;t have to get on the floor myself, and don&apos;t have to hand out singles. Sounds like win win.

I had one time where I was waiting for a drink that I could realy use and had to wait on the whole dancing thing realy anoiling in that siduation but that was only on time and maybe has justed soilered me to much to the whole thing. Also alot of the waiters at tghe one byt me are male so not as much fun Gary.

They have just the right amount of food though and are realy a good deal.

Red Lobster used to be better. I think it&apos;s the efforts to have mass appeal to the crowd who wants lots of food for little money that has brought them down.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - horsesboy - 10-01-2007 10:14 AM 

They were not bad the last time I ate at on but that must have been at least a year and a haslf again if not longer so I can&apos;t speak to now.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - ditto - 10-01-2007 11:18 AM 

Red Lobster is all bad. Find a good seafood restaurant and go there instead. Paying the extra$$$is worth it, imo.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 10-01-2007 12:37 PM 

I&apos;ve never been to Red Lobster but the only one in our area is mobbed every night, so there must be something to it.

I want to take a trip to Seattle one of these days at eat at the Ivars on the pier. Then go to Pike Street Market and visit the little collectibles shop. They have the most impressive collection of geek stuff ever. (and upstairs in the outdoor market some people sell crack pipes in the shape of the starship Enterprise)

Olive Garden has huge crowds too, but I wouldn&apos;t call that good Italian food either. It just bland pasta drowned in mozzarella, imo. Red Lobster is similar when it comes to seafood.

Are there any good national chain resturants ?

 RE: I ate a Baconator - ditto - 10-01-2007 01:44 PM 

For the big chains, in my opinion, no. They are average at best.

But, to be honest, that&apos;s what it takes to succeed on a national level. A big chain needs to have a menu that appeals to a large group of people, be cheap to make, and likewise be reasonably priced for patrons.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Barry from Athens - 10-01-2007 07:24 PM

What are you talking about, thats what makes good Italian. 

Actually we found a recipe online for their Zupe Toscona, and we made a gluten free variant that is 100,000 times better than what they have in the restaurant. My wife makes a mean Chicken Con Broccoli now as well.

Wow. That got me hungry. Damn it Brian, and you told me to eat the taquitos...

Without doubt, if you can recreate a restaurant chain dish at home it will be much better than what you can get at the restaurant. The big difference is in quality of ingredients.

Olive Garden isn&apos;t Italian. This is Italian:

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Ed from Texas - 10-02-2007 08:39 PM 

About the only national chain that I eat at with any regularity is Outback Steakhouse. Can&apos;t go wrong with a Bloomin&apos; Onion to start or a Chocolate Thunder for dessert. Can&apos;t ever do both in the same meal, though. Way too much food.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 10-02-2007 09:03 PM 

I&apos;ve never been to Outback, I&apos;ve been wanting to try it but my wife always diverts me to other establishments.

We got a local steakhouse thats pretty frakkin good, and they serve all kinds of exotic dishes I refuse to try. Elk, Moose, Crocodile... Too weird for my taste. But the prime rib is excellent.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - horsesboy - 10-02-2007 09:46 PM

Croc is kind of like a cross between fish and chicken. I&apos;ve only had it a couple of times. I think the meat itself is rather bland, so it tends to be spiced up a lot in a dish.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Gary - 10-03-2007 10:11 AM

Yep, exactly what you think it is.

Alright what sandwich shop has the best suns. Jerry&apos;s, Quizno, Subway, blimbies or other?

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Lizzie - 10-03-2007 05:18 PM 

The only one around here is Subway.

I like subway.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Gary - 10-03-2007 05:44 PM 

Of the choices give I&apos;ll have to go with Subway.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 10-03-2007 05:56 PM 

Of the choices given I&apos;m going with Quiznos, in that their toasts sandwhiches are better and typically so is their service.

Outside of that I&apos;m gonna say nobody compares to Caruso&apos;s deli. They got a bout three restaurants in the Pacific Northwest so far and they are just incredible. Fresh baked breads, real sliced meats, seriously fresh condiments... Just amazing.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Barry from Athens - 10-03-2007 07:17 PM 

I prefer Subway to Blimpies and definitely way over Quiznos.

Subway just tastes fresher and crunchier than Blimpies. Quiznos may be baked, but they heap so much cheese on there that it&apos;s too gooey for my tastes.

Though oddly enough, I like Schlotsky&apos;s as well.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 10-03-2007 08:11 PM 

It depends on what you order. I always get the chicken bacon ranch from Quiznos. I&apos;m not sure that even has cheese. Got plenty of ranch though, and me likey.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Ed from Texas - 10-03-2007 08:23 PM 

All those places put too much vegetable matter on sandwiches for my taste. When I want a salad, I&apos;ll have it in a bowl, thank you very much!

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 10-03-2007 08:59 PM 

I totally agree. But then they put so little meat on them if you didn&apos;t have the lettuce all you&apos;d have is partially cooked bread.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Lizzie - 10-03-2007 09:01 PM 

I just like there to be a lot of veggies. too much dressing takes away from the veggies flavor

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Gary - 10-03-2007 09:07 PM 

It&apos;s usually the stale/ freezer burned bread that does it for me.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - ditto - 10-04-2007 07:21 AM 

I prefer two of the local sandwich companies, one of which was featured on Food Network&apos;s &quot;Best Of...&quot;.

Otherwise, it&apos;s a bit of a toss up between Subway and Quiznos for me

 RE: I ate a Baconator - photojoe - 10-04-2007 07:23 AM

Oh wow, speaking of Pork, you know whats really good? Get some boneless pork ribs and cube them up, and kind of simmer them in a pan with a whole bottle of salsa and an 8 ounce packet of cream cheese, then put that in a flour tortilla with some sour cream and cheddar cheese. We call them Pork Burritos. Hot damn is that shit good.

Well, the Empire doesn&apos;t consider a fry cook to be any threat, or they&apos;d have a tighter defense. An analysis of the plans provided by Rachel Ray has demonstrated a weakness in the recepie. But the approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point. The target area is only two meters wide. It&apos;s a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the chicken. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the meal. Only a precise hit will set off a chain reaction. The shaft is ray-shielded, so you&apos;ll have to use an instant read thermometer.


Okay, I tried, and I failed. At least I tried.

Thanks. How about this one:


The Chairman: Ermil, there was nothing you could have done, had you been there. You would have been killed, too, and the recipe would now be in the hands of the Empire.

Ermil: I want to come with you to the kitchen stadium. There is nothing here for me now. I want to learn the ways of the turducken and become a chef like my father.

Based on what I saw on The Next Iron Chef squid is out of the running for favorite flavor. Of course everyone has different tastes.

Prailenes and cream is nice. So is B&amp;Js rum raisin.

I like Cookies and Cream flavour, cookie dough or just plain vanilla if it is a good one.

That and exersize. Middle back and forwards spend the whole game running. As long as Liz isn&apos;t playing goalie or stat girl she likely burns off 300 to 400 callories a game. Practice likely to be the same if her coach is up to snuff.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Gary - 10-09-2007 08:45 AM 

Is that all?

It would take more than two games to burn off the 830 calories in a typical Baconater.
Not to mention it&apos;s 51 grams of fat.

If she was over six teet tall and weighed in a a dozen pounds on the wrong side the two hundred pounds (like me)she could burn 500+ cals if she played her arse off. We are not even considering the weighlifting class that she should also be taking too (gotta get good strength in the lower body, abs, and back to play your best.) That doesn&apos;t cover a baconator, but you don&apos;t eat those every day, or even every week for that matter.

PS: what level is Liz playing at? Anything but AYSO and my comments should still apply. Particularly if she&apos;s playing at college.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Gary - 10-09-2007 09:02 AM 

A better question might be how many hours of typing on a keyboard would we have to do to burn off 800+ calories.

It is in fact a federal law that restaurants must provide nutritional information, not just the fast food ones. As of five years ago it was a point on Washington and California&apos;s Health and Safety Checklist, ensuring that its prominently displayed. I believe its also stated in the law that if a customer asks the business for that information it must be provided in a take home manner, leaflets and such.

That might not be a Federal law but its definately been a law in the three states I worked in when I did fast food. (which I only stopped doing four years ago)

 RE: I ate a Baconator - horsesboy - 10-09-2007 09:15 PM 

I know that the stuff is there but you have to ask and get them to dig it out in this area at least. Defently not promitly displayed.

This is why so much of restaurant food is pre-prepared frozen. They have to get the values of the food they serve to match up with the posted info (with a certain margin of error.) Denny&apos;s [barely not fast-food] is terrible for this. You get any meal with veggies on the side, and they come in single serving frozen bags. How do I know this? I once asked for all carrots and was told they can&apos;t do that because each serving was &quot;made that way when they frozen them at the factory.&quot;

 AVATARS

 Soccer 
Well its not my coaches fault its the whole division&apos;s becuase they schedule the games. We had a game yesterday and we have one tomorrow and saturday. The next 2 games are away about a 30 minute drive. Which seems short but add in the fact that its getting dark earlier and we have to do Homework. The last game of the season is an hour drive away.

Cooking with beer can make some fabulous dinners. And it&apos;s a great excuse to drink more.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Lizzie - 10-10-2007 08:47 PM 

doesnt cooking the alchohol make it lose its effectiveness

 RE: I ate a Baconator - ditto - 10-10-2007 09:02 PM 

Not exactly. Alcohol isn&apos;t added to food to get you drunk. Well, at least not usually. It&apos;s there for the flavor.

Wine is popular for the rich flavor it can give a dish. It also adds what I&apos;ve heard some cooks call &quot;brightness&quot;. This is a little bit of tang that helps balance the dish. Some recipes use vinegar for a similar reason.

The nice thing with beer is that you have a huge range of flavors that you can add to a dish. Guinness is often added to stews for it&apos;s malty accent.

Brightness: Think olives.

Some flavorants are water soluble and are easy to release from foods, others come from metabolic breakdowns (keep bread on your tongue, wait a few minutes to swallow), and others are stuck in wax and fat and are only soluble in alcohol. Thus the bit of cooking with beers and wines. Not only do you get the flavors of the beer and/or wine itself, you brake flavors free from other ingredients. Tomatoes are quite popular to pair with wines for example.

Chocolate infused with citrus oils, particularly orange. This melted over strips of orange zest. YUM!

Chocolate coated coffee beans.

I think$7.50 for a hot dog (not all beef) and$10.00 for a 20 ounce domestic yellow fizzy beer is fair (considering they could charge more when you&apos;re a captive audience, and at the local ball park you can bring in any solid food from outside venders.)

this why im glad the theater i go to has a mall across the street. When ever I go to the movies I leave an hour or early (takes 20 minutes to get there) then I run into the mall buy some candy and a drink. this costs about the same price as maybe 1 drink. I always bring a messenger bag because its big but just looks like im carrying books and my sweatshirt.

For me its apple cider, pumpkins/pumpkin seeds and the pumpkin spice latte!

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Gary - 10-13-2007 07:59 PM

I love cider too. My wife makes it in a crock pot to keep it warm for as long as it lasts, and adds mulling spices ( I know there are cloves, but I don&apos;t know what else) and lets the spices soak in this oversized tea ball in the cider. It is delicious.

Every fall/winter the local news hits the shelters and does a storyon how the weather that drops into the low 50s poses a serious risk to those unfortunate enough to be without shelter. I imagine it&apos;s probably not good for any person or creture who is not in good health.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 10-14-2007 09:35 PM 

You&apos;re actually complaining about the low 50&apos;s? Here in Spokane between December and February we&apos;ll have two to three week periods of low single digit temperatures on clear, sunny days. Wind chills bring the temperature into the double digit below. Animals can&apos;t be outside and people can&apos;t be outside for more than a few hours at a time bundled up.

(Dubshack need not respond. He&apos;s starting to scare me. ... Well go ahead Dub, just keep it tame.) 

I&apos;ve done Thanksgiving a couple of times. I just go with the standard stuff. Since I don&apos;t have a large family, I generally just get a turkey breast instead of the whole turkey.

Make traditional fare like mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, green beans, turkey or ham, that kind of thing. Keep innovation to a single dish. Desert is particularly amenable to doing something new and interesting. People are a lot more forgiving if desert doesn&apos;t come out (which has happened to me at some dinners I&apos;ve hosted).

I think people are more impressed by traditional dishes done well. They come with expectations, so don&apos;t mess with them.

Oh, and you can do about 75% of the dinner ahead of time. You can cook a lot of things like mashed potatoes and vegetables two or three days ahead of time and then refrigerate them. I make green beans the day before and refrigerate. I bring them out Thanksgiving day, microwave them to heat them back up, dump in vinegarette, toss, and I&apos;m ready with them.

For me the key to making a good turkey is to cook it in a couple cans of chicken broth. Makes for tender meats.

YUP, the whole pig, head and all. The worse is when they give a live pig to a little kid as a birthday present and tell them to raise it big and strong then the following year on their birthday it becomes the main center piece.

I won&apos;t deny it&apos;s pretty traumatic for the child but on the upside, the pig probably had a better life (and death) than the pig that became bacon in the grocery store.

When I&apos;m visiting up in Seattle I love grabbing a Dick&apos;s Burger . It&apos;s a true drive in where you order at a window and eat in your car. All walks of life goes there, you can see everything from a person pulling up in a Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren to a homeless person grabbing a burger.

In Bohol I make sure to head over to Payag as often as I can. I&apos;ve never had BBQ that was so fricken good!

I generally try to find the places where the locals eat. It&apos;s much better fare than what&apos;s served at the tourist traps and much cheaper too.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Gary - 10-24-2007 10:47 AM 

A jesuit priest told me to avoid chain resturants when on vacation. Experience the local culture whenever you get the chance. You should try to do this at home too.

Sadly, sometimes the local culture is Olive Garden and McDonalds

I think you need to reevaluate your definition of culture.
Unlimited bowls of salad do not count.

You have no need for the chain restaurant.

That&apos;s a possibility. I&apos;ve just ran into people a little to often who would prefer to eat at Olive Garden rather than Mona Lisa or they got confused when I told them I considered Macaroni Grill &quot;Mall Food&quot;

If the food comes in 5 gallon pails it is not good food.

Imagine eating a mudlike sand, only with less flavor.

Yum. Much better than grits.

The refrigerated polenta is much better than the non-refrigerated type.

oyster.

the only thing I&apos;ve ever had that hit my gag reflex and it wasn&apos;t because it was badly made it was just not my thing was cherry liqueur chocolates. I&apos;ve tried them a few times in the years and each time I end up having to brush my teeth in an attempt to kill the nasty flavor.

I normally get the cheesesteak. They also have ham and turkey versions. Plus you can get several different cheeses. The cheesesteak with blue cheese is awesome.

However, today, I went with their jalapeño burger. Spicy and tasty. Yum.

I had a recipe called Mediterranean Spaghetti. It&apos;s a baked casserole with layers of spaghetti, a meat/stewed tomato/onion/nutmeg/cinnamon sauce, and a feta/parmesian/egg sauce, two layers of each.

It was a leftover from earlier in the week when I had time to cook.

You know the skyping we do after Wingin&apos; It on Saturday could be edited into something maybe... I know last Saturday was hilarious. We could just have random people have quirky conversation about random concepts.

If you guys are serious I&apos;d consider buying the domain myself and hosting it on my server, with the audio files on Podango. The site itself might go down from time to time but the feed should be reliable.

We&apos;d have to have a couple of &quot;hosts,&quot; people with computers that have enough power to not only host the skype chat, but record and edit the show. Then we could rotate as needed. My new machine should be able to handle it so I could be one. If Ian is up he might be another.

And then Mike can decide later if he wants to assimilate the show into Farpoint. They really don&apos;t have the time to develop anymore shows with anyone.

My wife made me reheated Mac and cheese last night. I hate that. The noodles are always to soft and mushy.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - ditto - 10-29-2007 08:00 AM 

It depends on how you reheat it; baked or fried is better than microwaving. And the pasta was probably too cooked to begin with.

That&apos;s the basis of the glycemic index diet. Making you feel full longer.

Personally, I like meat. A lot of carbs make me really sleepy, veggies tend not to fill me up. Slices of turkey really cuts the edge off of my hunger and can even fill me up with just a few slices. That was what I brought to D*C and ate for breakfast, lunch, and sometimes supper.

Shrimp, thinly sliced cocanut, pineapple. Repeat. A quick dip in rum and set alight as the last thing you do before taking the 1st bite!

best place period in the midwest. great raodhouse type bar, been around forever it seems. great prices, but you have to eat there. no carryouts. and the burgers are huge. although it says you have to be twenty one, that is just during the evenings. when things tend to heat up. darcy and i go there all the time.

It&apos;s called the great attractor. Because of the warping of space-time all diners are pulled to the North East. Because the universe hasn&apos;t reached maximum entropy yet all of them have not merged into the diner singularity that is expected to emerge somewhere in Rhode Island.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Gary - 11-07-2007 06:39 AM 

Gosh I was still hoping for more of a selection than just Rhode Island.

I&apos;m not really sure since the party is at the relatives but I&apos;m guessing a Turkey and a Honey Baked ham or a whole pig also I&apos;m sure there will be some pancit, lumpia and leche flan.

Which reminds me I&apos;m going to have make some mashed potatoes since I&apos;m sure that&apos;s the only way I&apos;ll see some.

Yes but snow is fun. Well at least when you do not have to go anywhere it is fun.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - ddad - 11-19-2007 12:18 PM 

Looks like the first snow will be on thursday for us. it&apos;s not to get above 30 to 40 and rain the day before. So we are looking at snow or ice. I am hoping for the former. As far as pie favorites, my aunt always makes the best deep dish chocolate or banana pies each year. Caused many a fight over them, I still have the fork wounds. lol.

Movie popcorn. Evil and disgusting, but I like it anyway. It&apos;s strangely addictive.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 11-22-2007 11:30 AM 

I agree, the only cranberry I like is strawberry cranberry juice, and I only drink that to avoid more kidney stones.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Barry from Athens - 11-22-2007 06:58 PM 

I fixed a turkey breast, sausage and sourdough dressing, mashed potatoes, squash and sausage casserole, and green beans with almonds and balsamic vinegarette. I made zucchini bread and crandberry apple bread. We went over to my mother-in-law&apos;s for desert, but I made a pumpkin pie yesterday for consumption on Friday.

And I served jellied cranberry sauce from a can.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - dqbiggerfam - 11-22-2007 09:16 PM 

had turkey, mashed potatoes, brussel sprouts, pumpkin and dutch apple pie, and candied yams,
as well as about 4 hours of tv time. A quick review of A License To Wed: over the top and tolerable for teh first 30-45 min, after that it lost me. The choir&apos;s &quot;you&apos;re late&quot; song was great though.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - photojoe - 11-22-2007 10:44 PM 

A turkey dinner as provided by Dennys. I should be at home with my wife and kids, I should have cooked a real dinner for them instead of... this.

We went out to dinner... My mother cooks every year, so she kinda wanted a change up this year, which i&apos;m good with. My whole family had turkey... except me. I couldn&apos;t get my eye off of the 17 oz steak. It was an absolute delight.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Gary - 11-24-2007 03:44 AM 

I had my once yearly piece of turkey to celebrate the holiday. It was tasty.

I found a sandwich place that offers a Thanksgiving sub.
Turkey, mashed potatoes, green beans, cranberry sauce, and gravy, all on a sub roll.

We had turkey, dressing, candied yams, green bean casserole, rolls, mashed potatoes, canned and traditional cranberries. Relish tray with broccoli, olives (black and green), carrots, cauliflower, green peppers, and cherry tomatoes.

Pie was pumpkin, apple and cranberry apple. Whipped topping of course.

And Coronado Island was lovely.

Your father is a savage.

My dad hunts and I&apos;ve had all sorts of game meat, it all tastes nasty to me.

Lonna had to work Thanksgiving so we couldn&apos;t have a family get together like we normally do. The turkey didn&apos;t cook fast enough, we ended up eating at like midnight... The whole vacation kinda sucked, I was planning on getting all this recording done and I didn&apos;t get hardly anything accomplished.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - ddad - 11-27-2007 12:29 AM 

actually it wasn&apos;t me that got the deer. i only fish, or drown worms might be a better way to word that. my cousin took his fourteen year old son out hunting for the first time this year. the story goes he set him up in a tree stand, then drove off in the woods a half a mile or so away and went to another tree stand. leaving the boy with a walkie talkie &quot;in case there was a problem&quot;. three hours later the boy came walking though the woods and called up. &quot;hey dad! i got one!&quot; my cousin got down and said, well where is it?? &quot; heck if i know dad, I shot it and hit its shoulder and it ran off. thought i&apos;d better come tell you&quot; lol.

Kids. this is why the Byran side of my family have white hair at age forty.

Hey, under-hood cooking is way underrated! As long as your engine is in good shape (not giving off any fumes or odors) and your food is well sealed you can steam or boil anything you can imagine. Take it from the guy who is driving 40+ hours a week. My #1 thing is using engine heat to bring water or coffee to a near boil (an actual boil is too dangerous, for the automotive electronics as well as for my fragile hide.)

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Gary - 12-01-2007 06:21 AM 

I made eggs under the hood once for kicks. It does work, but not as good as a frying pan.

Photojoe, I&apos;ll bet you could have a great cup of coffee that way.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 12-01-2007 11:07 AM

Nope, if you boil water under the hood you get a steam explosion. A standard percolating coffee maker would spill (unless you made a custom holder, say, welded to the exhaust manifold[yeah, that gets nice and hot]) Any enclosed container will burst when you put any volume of fluid worth mentioning.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Gary - 12-01-2007 05:42 PM 

Maybe a tubing system that wraps around the exhaust manifold to heat the liquid then move it away. Hey it works for anti freeze.

Too complicated.

Pig iron or mild steel welded to the exhaust manifold: It&apos;s a heat pipe.

Then that gets routed or has a &quot;cup holder&quot; or &quot;tray holder&quot; welded to it, or formed on the end of it. The goal being having this heat be in place that&apos;s accessible and capable of securing your food on.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Brian Brown - 12-07-2007 08:07 AM 

Back to Pizza - We have a couple chains that aren&apos;t bad. Streets of New York is pretty okay. I think they are local based but there are a TON of them around.

I like this local place called Red Devil - MMMM! Good stuff.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - ditto - 12-07-2007 09:00 AM 

I make a distinction between local chains and national/global chains. Of course, that distinction might not apply in big cities like New York.

The important point to realize is that every restaurant is a business. To be successful, there has to be a balance between quality and cost to produce an appealing product that people are willing to buy. From what I&apos;ve seen, it&apos;s the big, national chains that really cut corners when it comes to food quality. They produce bland, but palatable, food that is extremely cheap to make, and easy to make consistently. They are just like the big brewers.

Premium chains, such as Lidia&apos;s strike a different balance. The quality will be much better, but you&apos;ll also pay a lot more for it.

Anyway, people go to the big chains because they know what they&apos;ll get. No matter where you go, a Starbuck&apos;s coffee or a McDonald&apos;s hamburger will be pretty much the same, though it may be slightly different in other countries. People find it comforting to know what they&apos;ll get, especially when you are in an unfamiliar city and unsure about what unknown restaurant to try.

Local chains generally start from an individual restaurant. To be able to afford another location, they&apos;ve had to be somewhat successful. Basically, they&apos;ve built a reputation on a certain level of quality that is generally better than the big chains. The problem local chains start to run into is how to make their food consistent between locations. Most fail in this respect. The ones that do survive, end up being pretty good.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - horsesboy - 12-07-2007 09:25 AM 

I am not a big fan of Beersicles I like beer but there is something about it frozen that just does not taste right to me.

I&apos;ve not tried a beercicle yet.

Is there a better style beer to start with? Stout,IPA, or maybe some of that chocolate double stout?

So how does everyone feel about eggnog?

I love it around the holidays.

I even make french toast using eggnog instead of milk. I bake it in the oven. Obscenely high in fat, but what the heck it&apos;s Christmas.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Mr_Wall - 12-11-2007 09:16 AM 

I&apos;m lactose intolerant so things like eggnog are like kryptonite to me

You have to get the deep dish, its the only way to go. But they by far have the freshest toppings around here, and are excellent. You can order online too, which is a big plus.


 Brian Brown Wrote: I&apos;m with you there. UGH.

I&apos;m a fan of thin, crackerbread style of pizza. MmmmM!

Mushroom and cheese for me please! 

I agree on the crackerbread style, I do like that. But I&apos;m allergic to mushrooms so no thanks.

Yeah Papa Murphy&apos;s was a staple food around this house till the wheat allergy came along. Their stuffed crust chicken and bacon with alfredo sauce pizza is just to die for. (and can probably kill you as well, I&apos;ve never eaten more than a slice at a time and not turn into a bloated hog)


 Mr_Wall Wrote: we do just a little over that but it beats going to Round Table down the street. 

Oh yeah, we had a Round Table in Sonora CA that was awesome, their all meat pizza was really good. Also there was an independent place called Sky High Pizza I think at the top of the Sierra Nevada (slap me if I&apos;m wrong) but they had HUGE pizzas that were very tasty.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Dubshack - 12-11-2007 05:50 PM 

Not a big fan of the nog. But then for me theres this whole threshold between drinks, slurpees and milkshakes, and nog is just in an uncomfortable place for me. Like drinking whole cream.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Barry from Athens - 12-11-2007 08:04 PM 

I love egg nog. I tried to do the fat free kind, but it was just bleah. But full-fat egg nog just makes me ill. I compromise with the low-fat version. At least there&apos;s still some of the sinful taste of the real thing

 RE: I ate a Baconator - dqbiggerfam - 12-11-2007 09:31 PM 

During the holidays I&apos;ll have the occasional glass of half/half eggnog and martinelli&apos;s sparkling apple cider, although I will have to try other flavors as well. I had the cranapple recently and it could actually drink it straight without thinning it out. I can&apos;t do that with apple cider.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Gary - 12-12-2007 04:24 AM

So we were having a lunch time conversation about eggnog and what sort of alcohol to put into it.

Of course brandy. There was also talk of spiced rum, regular rum, etc.

I also put forth the idea of Drambuie 

I&apos;m also a fan of making my own eggnog. It&apos;s very simple - heavy cream, eggs and sugar.

Depends on my mood Gary. Sometimes you just want a large marshmallow sometimes you want lots of small ones.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Mr_Wall - 12-15-2007 11:17 AM 

Large - they&apos;re great for roasting over a bonfire.

 

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Gary - 12-15-2007 11:31 AM 

I&apos;m in the small camp myself. If I shove 2 to 3 lg ones, I feel like I&apos;m going to OD. A handful of small ones is just right.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Mr_Wall - 12-17-2007 08:09 PM 

I&apos;ve probably come close with eating lumpia, especially during my tweens of going to Filipino parties each weekend and eating about a dozen before the party actually started.

this has carried over to the rest of my life, whenever we end up at another party, I end up eating at least a dozen and if I&apos;m visiting either my or my wifes mom and they&apos;re making some, I&apos;m eating at least 2 dozen.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Barry from Athens - 12-18-2007 10:54 AM 

A small order of french fries probably has 10-15 french fries. That&apos;s about 250-400 orders of fries to get to 4000 fries. So I could easily imagine someone eating that many over two or three years.

But how reasonable is it to have eaten 40,000 french fries? 400,000?

You&apos;d be surprised how many people I know who cannot do it without a calculator even with the information I already gave. Assuming they could even reproduce how I set up the problem.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - horsesboy - 12-18-2007 11:13 AM

I use to have a real issue with Milk, I would only drink it if I was the one who opened the carton and if anyone else touched my carton I couldn&apos;t drink it anymore. Plus I was really big about the smell, I&apos;d always have to smell it to make sure it was still good and if it was the day of expiration then it was going down the sink.

anyone have issues with their calamari having legs? a friend of mine does, I always thought it was kind of funny that she could only eat calamari if it was in rings but if the sucker had legs she was done. It didn&apos;t help the day I made them do a little dance in front of her.

I made chili. Ground beef, light and dark kidney beans, onions, green peppers, tomato sauce, diced tomatoes. chili powder, cumin, basil, salt, and black pepper.

I would normally use cayenne, but wanted to see how it tasted with black pepper. It was definitely less hot and tasted a little sweeter than usual. I think the sweetness of the tomato sauce was able to come through better.

Some people say eating something cold causes your capillaries to expand and you&apos;ll start to feel warmer as a result.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - ditto - 01-14-2008 12:45 PM 

It&apos;s not true. In fact, it&apos;s the same problem as eating ice cubes. You have a cold mass in your stomach that needs to be heated. This may increase your heart rate, but more importantly, it lowers your core temperature. It&apos;s not a big drop, but it does take time to restore.

Poached eggs with some hollandaise sauce is delicious.

Yummy

ps.-i really want that egg poacher now.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Gary - 01-29-2008 07:33 AM 

Some places substitute the canadian bacon in eggs benedict with spinach, and call it eggs florentine.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Lizzie - 01-29-2008 07:38 AM 

I get that too!! so delicious

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Satai (with Punsch) - 01-29-2008 08:39 AM 

How do you mean... no bacon?
Sounds suspicius to me.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Gary - 01-29-2008 08:48 AM 

They exclude the canadian bacon and substitute it with spinach. Great change if you don&apos;t eat meat.

I had dinner at a friends house for the first time when I was about 8, I remember wondering &quot;where&apos;s the rice?&quot; and then being even more confused by the spoon (an extra utensil?) and thrown off by being offered bread with butter.

For my own personal preference I prefer Jasmin rice, I usually get the 20lbs &quot;3 Ladies&quot; bag

yeah, a bit of a tangent but the talk of rice suddenly gave me flashbacks.

It involves good food, much wine and a movie.

Havnt decided yet on which to watch, Return of the King or the traditional Valentines Day movie When Harry met Sally .


By the way, does any one know what to serve with bagna cauda?

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Lizzie - 02-14-2008 06:03 AM 

go with the action movie!! Their much more fun to watch and are easier to enjoy with less awkward moments and i do not really like &quot;when Harry Met Sally&quot;

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Gary - 02-14-2008 06:37 AM 

My wife and I went out last night, pizza and Gellato for desert.

You would have to pay me large amounts of money to go out to a resturant tonight.
I have three different horror stories about Valentine&apos;s Day meals, that have taught me otherwise.

Ok, it might be a bit cheesy but it has bitterness, sarcasm, Casablanca and faked orgasms. Its like life in a little box. 

The only risk of awkward moments in our relationship (we&apos;ve lived together for 7 years) is when we cant agree about when to push the &quot;paus&quot; button, when James Masters is on screen or when Juliet Landau is.

Perhaps, but, trying to drive traffic to restaurants, gift stores, and flower shops on an arbitrary date....and benefiting from such artificially created demand with well jacked up prices - that is commercialism at its manipulative worst.

No special activity around here for Valentine&apos;s Day. My wife and I make our date nights when my parents come to visit and watch the kids.

And, in this case, it&apos;s just as well. We probably would have gone to see &quot;Jumper&quot;, but the review on Slice looks less than stellar.

I wrote my wife a check for &quot;Child Support&quot;, she cashed it and is in Italy, and she has Sole Legal Custody of our kids. My oldest has been sick sense Friday and has been in the care of a babysitter. He has now missed two days of school this week (Monday was a school holiday) and he missed most of his school day Friday (sent home from school.) I can&apos;t take him to the doctor because she said I can&apos;t do anything with the boys w/o her express consent. To top it all off the court will not address this issue until next Tuesday, and this only because I filed an emergency petition. To think, I have to file a law suit to take my sick child to the doctor while my wife parties overseas!

I grew up in a really strong Filipino American community... they&apos;ll throw a celebration for just about anything, summers are the best, we would go to at least one shin-dig a month during the year and it would ramp up to about one per week in the summer.

Of course that came back to us when we got married, we had nearly 300 attendees.

I don&apos;t know anything about warm cheeses. What would be a good cheese for a novice to start with?

 RE: I ate a Baconator - ditto - 03-08-2008 09:20 AM 

Warmed parmesan is very delicious. Take a slice--yes, use the real stuff and not *shudder* the canned--and pop it in the microwave for 20-30 seconds until it is bubbly. Let it cool a bit before you eat it, otherwise you&apos;ll burn yourself. Mmmmmm.

Many restaurants cook it for a little longer and then let it cool until crisp. Then they break it into small pieces and sprinkle the cooked parmesan over salads and pasta.

yeah i had an awful experience in whole foods when i tried this delicious mushroom marinated in Balsamic Vinegar and well they almost called an ambulance becuase i didn&apos;t know what was going and why my chest was hurting. Luckily my mom called me and she told me to calm down and what was going on.

scary stuff....

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Mr_Wall - 04-25-2008 01:08 PM 

todays lunch was a Vietnamese &quot;pork meatball&quot; sandwich from across the street
contents included: wietnamese mayo, pate, carrots, cucumbers, cliantro and jalapeno&apos;s

 

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Lizzie - 05-02-2008 10:29 AM

but at least it was good.

I&apos;m a bit more concerned about waiting 30 minutes at the bar for my next beer(s), though I&apos;ve already decided I&apos;ll just BART in rather than mess with parking.

I&apos;ve worked in the Tenderloin&amp;Bay Shore, the mission is pretty friendly compared to both of those places.

The main difference is that I didn&apos;t use any pâté (or liver). I seared some small sirloin steaks, sauteed some mushrooms and added some prosciutto before wrapping everything in the puff pastry. It turned out very well.

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Barry from Athens - 05-09-2008 06:58 PM 

Tried out a new past place near my house. Had tagliatelle (?) with norma sauce. Some sort of eggplant, tomato, mozzarella sauce. It was good.

I had the best grilled cheese sandwich in Atlanta yesterday.
It was about a block away from where D*C ensues.
It had cheddar, colby, and some scallions on rye bread. Delicious!

 RE: I ate a Baconator - Mr_Wall - 05-17-2008 09:07 PM 

For lunch my wife wanted to head over to a place called Pacific Fusion, one of the studios she works for orders lunch from them occasionally (when everyone gets tired of Korean). Turns out it&apos;s &quot;Asian Fusion&quot; which means they serve both their Fish&amp;Chips and the Sushi with Wasabi.

I decided to go with their Mixed Catch Basket : 2 pieces of fresh fish, 4 coconut shrimp&amp;3 oysters with sweet potato fries.

Needless to say, I&apos;ve got left overs now.

Honey on corn muffins. Mrmmmmm.

I&apos;ve been feeling like making chocolate-whipped cream filled cream puffs for the last few days. Maybe this weekend. Anything with that many eggs and butter and cream HAS to be good.

Life is much as it was, though I have an actual real diagnosis for whats going on... it&apos;s called Fibromyalgia, and if I&apos;d have connected the dots between the random pain all over and the IBS and anxiety and other shit that was happening to me, I might actually still be podcasting. But as it is I&apos;ll have to settle for jumping through insurance hoops to get the medication that actually works for me... That and publishing my first book on Lulu.com, which I dunno... take that for what it&apos;s worth... 

Seems overpriced to me but a dollar of the proceeds of either the print or digital sale goes towards my treatment... which logically would lead to me writing the sequels... which because of the Fibro I have no energy for...

At any rate I&apos;ve been dying to jump back into podcasting again but it isn&apos;t happening, and I&apos;m pretty sure it won&apos;t till I can get back on Lyrica. Which I might start getting from Canada if my appeals don&apos;t start getting through... But even then that&apos;s like$100 for a month and a half supply... Drug is to new I guess. Oh well. We&apos;ll figure it out.

I went with this version.

 http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Irish-Soda-Bread-with-Raisins-231580 

It is not the plain traditional version. It leans a little more toward cake than bread so that the kids would enjoy it a little more.

It&apos;s cool how the baking soda and buttermilk eliminate the need for yeast as a rising agent.

It&apos;s quick too. You can go from scratch to loaf of bread in about 35 minutes.

I&apos;m going to give that a try.

Actually, both baking power and baking salt are leavening agents. You don&apos;t often see both used in a recipe.

It lends itself to a softer bread, hence leaning a little to the cake side.

I&apos;m eating a slice from one of the spare loaves right now. Some suggest jelly, but slightly toasted with butter or marmalade is a slice of heaven.

Ditto, if I could get 20 6-7 year olds to make it, you should have no problem. Use a little extra flour when mixing it into a ball. It&apos;s very sticky.

I had to do a quick google on &quot;she crab soup&quot; and that looks mighty tasty! 

It is tasty. The correct way to serve it is with a little sherry on the side. Don&apos;t find that much any more, though.

For Mother&apos;s Day I made my wife blueberry pancakes, and an egg over hard, as well as a nice cup of tea.

I so need to make that my new handle. &quot;Eclectic Institute Huckleberry calling with a voicemail!&quot;

I&apos;ll just settle for my raspberry sorbet.

Harvesting for optimal potency? Sounds either like The Matrix or Viagra.
