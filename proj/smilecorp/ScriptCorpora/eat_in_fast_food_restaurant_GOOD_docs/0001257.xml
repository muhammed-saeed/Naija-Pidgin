rip-off
 
If you enjoy being nickle and dimed to death this is the place. They charge 5 cents per packet of mustard, sweet and sour sauce, or soy sauce, and 20 cents for every set of chopsticks you order. Most Chinese restaurants give these for free with your order, being standard for most orders. Also, the food is sub par at best and the service is terrible. They answered the phone by saying&quot;Hold on&quot;- no please or thank you or mention of the name of the business, just&quot;Hold on&quot;and then when I questioned the policy of charging for things that come with chinese food, and cancelled my order, the woman cursed at me. I will not order from here again, and hope you don&apos;t either.

Great Place Great Food
 
I&apos;ve had their Kung Pow Dishes (great). I usually get some soup and an appetizer. The Crab Rangoons are second to none. I love their Yat Kow Mein Soup (Soup with Chicken, Baby Shrimps and Beef with thick noodles in a hearty Chicken based stock. (They put a fried egg on top of the soup I can do without it).

beware of soup, vegetarians
 
good soup and value. just beware that vegetable soup is the only soup with a non-meat base.

Super fast delivery
 
I totally order from here when I&apos;m exhausted from a long day at work. I think their best dishes are the salt and pepper shrimp and their beef chow fun. Their portions are very big so make sure to invite over friends when you order from this place.

Fast, Reliable, Generous and Inexpensive
 
This place is great for a few good reasons, they give very generous portions for a very good price and they deliver in lightening speed. Seriously they always say 30-45 mins or even 45-1 hour but they always deliver in under 20 mins, on several occasions they have been here in 10 mins, no joke! They have become my favorite delivery place for that reason alone, the food is very good but not the best chinese in Chicago, however the other places take so damn long to deliver that i just gave up on them. One other place took 2hours and 15 mins, I swear. I watched a whole basketball game as i waited for my food! One time I ordered food from See Thru and I ordered a Diet Pepsi, when the food came it was regular (i hate regular) I called them just to say, guys you gave me the wrong can. Can you believe they sent the delivery guy all the way back just to give me a diet pepsi!? Awesome, I love those guys! I ordered from them 10 mins ago and i swear, the guy is here right now!

tasteless greasefest
 
I sometimes go there in desperation, when the thought of another Subway sandwich is too awful to bear. No matter how many times I say,&quot;little oil&quot;, the food is greasy greasy greasy. I&apos;ve tried some of the plainer dishes, and those are tasteless, unless you ask to add blackbean sauce and/or garlic to the dish. I dunno, I just don&apos;t find anything very good about the food except that it&apos;s convenient and fairly fast.

A convenient and tasty option for lunch
 
I eat at the Chinese See-Thru Kitchen on Roosevelt about once a week for lunch and order from their special lunch menu. Each lunch option includes shrimp friend rice and an eggroll (pork and vegetarian options are available). I typically order the seafood or vegetarian items and enjoy the Kung Pao Vegetable, the Szechuan Shrimp, and the Shrimp with Broccoli. The value is terrific, and the portions are generous. Delivery service is friendly and prompt.
