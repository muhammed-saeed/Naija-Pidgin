Coming to America (1988)

Prince Akeem Joffer (Eddie Murphy) of the fictional African Country, Zamunda, seeks real life experience (and an escape from his arranged marriage) by moving to Queens.Quote: &quot;I started out mopping the floor just like you guys. But now...now I&apos;m washing lettuce. Soon I&apos;ll be on fries; then the grill. And pretty soon, I&apos;ll make assistant manager, and that&apos;s when the big bucks start rolling in.&quot; --- Maurice (Louie Anderson) to Prince Akeem and Semmi (Arsenio Hall) while they clean the kitchen at McDowells fast food restaurant.
