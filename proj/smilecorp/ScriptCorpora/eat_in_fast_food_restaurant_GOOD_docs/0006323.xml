 Getting Started 
 If your electric bill is more $200 per month, the Circuit Rider is GUARANTEED to work for you. 

Electricity from the power company has noise,
distortion, reverse harmonics, and other flaws that
cause you to pay for more electricity than you
actually need.

Circuit Riders will

 Reduce the amount of electricity drawn from your power company. 
 Deliver a clean, even flow of energy to your home or building. 
 Remove spikes and surges to protect your valuable electronic investments. 
 Improve general equipment performance and extended motor life. 
 GUARANTEED ENERGY SAVINGS! 

Circuit Rider is an innovative, economical, environmentally friendly electronic device for commercial and residential clients. Heres how it works for you

 Reduce the amount of electricity drawn from your power company. 
 Deliver a clean, even flow of energy to your home or building. 
 Remove spikes and surges to protect your valuable electronic investments. 

We are proud of our products and stand behind
them. Every Circuit Rider Unit comes with

 Guaranteed kWh savings of ten percent (10%) or more 
 Five (5) year limited warranty 
 $2,000,000 insurance policy (included) 
 Twelve (6) month money back guarantee 

Documented savings in kilowatt hours used have ranged from 10% to
in excess of 35%. These savings have been reflected on the electric bills of residences and businesses in many
locations across the country.

Basic explanation: Currently, you draw 22.7 amps from your power company
to create 22.5 amps for your location (due to voltage imbalance and harmonicsreverse voltage). With a Circuit Rider installed, you draw only 20.43 amps to maintain 22.5 amps into your home or office plus Circuit Riders other benefits that improve operations of all electrical devices.

 For Home Owners 

Homeowners can protect their biggest investment. Circuit Rider protection means protection from lightning, surges, and spikes for all electrical appliances in their home. Most homeowners have surge protectors for home computers and home entertainment centers, but not for kitchen appliances, fax machines, or air conditioners, etc. The Circuit Rider provides protection for every electrical outlet in the home. This also provides extended life expectancy for all electrical devices in the home in addition to reduced kilowatt hours used.

 For Commercial and Industrial Businesses 

For business owners, industry, and educational facilities, Circuit Rider units provide extended life expectancy for expensive electronic devices and electric motors, reduced downtime and repair expenses. Additionally, the reduced kilowatt savings on three-phase voltage, especially 480v, can have a significant positive impact on the bottom line.

 How does the Circuit Rider work? - A Technical Description 

The device saves kWh by several applications.

 1. First, we have incorporated MOVs (metal oxide varistors) in every Circuit rider unit. These (MOV) divert transient voltage spikes and down-line lightning strikes to ground. The diversion of transient voltage spikes will reduce the amount of energy that motors draw. The harmonics that are present in every circuit are reduced by the combination of the relationship with the EMI filters, MOVs and capacitors that are present in each circuit rider unit (Savings 0 4%).

 2. By eliminating the transient voltage, we balance the voltage. A 3% voltage imbalance attributes to a 10% motor de-rating. By eliminating this, we save on the amount of energy that a motor has to draw to operate. (Savings 0.5 10%).

 3. By having capacitors, we are increasing the Power Factor to all appliances and motors. The closer the Power Factor is to Unity (1.0), the more efficient a motor operates. Thus requiring less energy to operate. If Power Factor is at 0.85, this results in the Current wave Lagging the Voltage wave by 15 %. This results in motors having to draw 2 4% more energy to operate. By increasing Power Factor, we are eliminating the need for a motor to draw more Current (Savings 0 10%).

 4. As we increase the Power Factor, we are lowering the amount of Current a motor requires. Normally, the Current will drop in the same percentage as Power Factor percentage increases. With the Proprietary Knowledge and a combination of other parts, we reduce the Current percentage to an amount greater than the increase of the power factor percentage. Also, we are eliminating Apparent Energy which heats motors. (Savings 0 -10%).

 5. Then we have Harmonic Balancing. The 5th, 11th, and 17th Harmonics applies a reverse torque on 3 phase motors. The circuit rider restores the 60 Hz cycle and thus the 60 Hz fundamental cycle the 5th was countering (Savings 0 4%). Then the 3rd, 9th, and 15th (The Triplen Harmonics) apply no forward force on motors. By restoring the 60 Hz cycle, we eliminate the Current that feeds the triplen harmonics (Savings 0 4%).

The above analysis shows how we can save 0.5 to 42% on kWh. This is one of the many features that result out of the New Technology of the circuit rider. By eliminating the harmonics, not only will motors last longer, but so will all of your electronics. Eliminating the harmonics prevents overheating of components and neutral conductors, damage to motors, electronics, circuit breakers, and transformers.
