 If It Were MY Ad Dollar 
 Filed under: Domino&apos;s Pizza , new normal , Hardee&apos;s , user categories , trier rejecters , 2 minute ad , showcase ad , undercover boss , Steak And Shake , Zaxby&apos;s , McDonald&apos;s , new products , Advertising , marketing dollars , Subway , Pizza Hut , Capt D&apos;s , Arby&apos;s , Quantitative Research —Rick Phillips @ 07:50 
 It’s worth thinking back about 2010—what fast food ads do you remember? (I wrote this in late Jan.) 

 For me, Pizza came to mind first; from the 10 Dollar  price point positioning of Pizza Hut (which offered value and an immediate clarification on pricing, always a nebulous weak point for the Pizza category) to the Domino’s ads about `sending in a picture of your pizza’and real pizza in ads from now on with no special effects (a reaching out to be more real to people - in essence just what that Undercover Boss series does). 

 Yes, that funny ad with those Valley Girl type secretaries eating Hardee’s Fresh Chicken Fingers comes to mind still too; and, Wendy’s Sea Salt Fries, but that was recent. Okay, I still have a memory or two of McDonald’s different `Wraps’type offerings, Arby’s 1.00 Menu - and Subway now offering Breakfast (all three of which induced not one action by myself until recently trying Arby’s Buck Items). Nearly all the rest is a wash. Money swept under the bridge of TV Fast Food Advertising. 

 Zaxby’s is simply that easy to whistle same music theme over and over and the folksy endorsement by small celebrities - IHOP is endlessly pushing slightly expensive breakfasts IMO - all the Casual Restaurants such as Friday’s are endlessly pushing the under 10.00 price point (and ignoring that I will be paying a tip beyond any price point that EXcludes a drink to begin with ) (not real) - and, where has the Burger KING went anyway? Price is also what I remember about Capt. D’s ads - and Steak and Shake - while price AND size is what I remember about Taco Bell. (As I go mentally thru my local Woodstock Ga. Fast Food Market.) 

 My guess is that some marketing departments are patting themselves on the back - they have gotten the point thru to a weary America that `eating out’ can fit into a reduced `frills’budget diet the new normal has put America onto . 

 But, PRICE may be less compelling - especially emotionally to a consumer - than the reward of trying a new product offering that sounds especially good; one that you may be excited to tell a friend about. And, less compelling than trying to directly talk to consumers like the Pizza category did in 2010. IMO. 

 So, what would I do if it were MY ad dollar? 

 I’d want to stand out. 

 For example, to `reach the consumer’would 4 thirty second ads bunched with a block of perhaps 4 minutes of similar ads each time - sound like a way to stand out—OR—WOULD A TWO MINUTE `SHOWCASE’AD?—————–Heck, even 24 - Five second logos might have more impact than the standard forgettable 30 second ad a week into a new ad flight. 

 IMO, with `Showcase’Ads - Brands can address all the marketing categories with 3 or 4 variations (a strategy not often used) - first and foremost, the `frequency-rejecter’- that is the core population base that is aware of your brand, has used it in the past - but now, it has been so long, as to be a `trier-rejector’(at least to YOU the owner of the brand) of the brand - having replaced it with other choices. 

 IMO, many of these people can be lured back - and many fall into the influenced by advertising campaigns motif - that ad agencies have long relied upon for improvement of sales during sales campaigns . IMO, they could be targeted MUCH more via a Showcase ad . 

 After all, REGULAR users are JUST that - and are UNLIKELY to be significantly changing their Frequency of Usage over any term ; other than to bump up the next visit interval by a few days, perhaps. Much more effective ways exist to market to your existing customer base than TV mass advertising. 

 Of course, the ultimate boom would exist on MAKING A NEW USER ENTIRELY - the total rejecter; never user (for all practical purposes) - certainly a Showcase Ad for these extremely low awareness of what your brand IS market - can become better informed and tempted about what YOU have to offer via your brand. 

 These LOW-KEY, almost, aw-shucks ads - like an infomercial - are the emotional connection to change behaviour———not the mind numbing, what did I just see, 30 second blasts of normalcy.

 Top Of Mind Restaurant Ads 
 Filed under: Chili&apos;s , Domino&apos;s Pizza , upscaling , upscale salads , freshness , Hardee&apos;s , Quiznos , Wendy&apos;s , KFC , Capt D&apos;s , Zaxby&apos;s , Steak And Shake , Advertising —Rick Phillips @ 10:21 
 When I do some of my on the street - top of mind interviewing - I often ask my respondents about recall for Restaurant Advertising - here’s an example interview - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTRO81RR7DA . Anyway, as I got to thinking of it just now - I thought I’d `do myself’so to speak. 

 And the ad I like the most - is - Hardee’s; specifically the two `valley’girl secretaries who are eating the `fresh’breaded Chicken Strips and ignoring the `annoying’phone calls they should be answering. To me, it’s hilarious and gets the message across about Freshness and upscaled. 

 The Wendy’s `talking couple’ads about the new Fresh Salads (different types being featured) also comes across as promoting the Freshness and upscaled - with a bit of humor too. (The distracting relationship of the male and female Wendy’s worker.) 

 The Domino’s Pizza chief with his `not fluffed up’pizza photography ads are next for me. Connects that his (Domino’s) pizza is Real Food and to not wanting to `fool the customer’(implying the others do). The invite for consumers to send in their own pictures also connects at the personal level. 

 Captain D’s slogan recently - `Cookin in the Kitchen’- caught my attention for its snappiness and food shots. 

 Chili’s - 5.99 Hamburgers caught my attention for low price point for sit-down casual (tipping locations) and product shot. 

 Steak and Shake coupons for Butter Pecan milkshakes increased my desire to go. 

 KFC - I’ve caught myself singing - G Double O D Goooooood - reluctantly a time or two. Catchy. 

 Quizno’s - 3, 4, and 5 dollar combos. Like this idea of a sliding combo price. 

 The laid back Zaxby’s tune - so easy to whistle.

 Price Point Stalking - The New Normal

 Putting promotion and advertising dollars behind various price points is nothing new in the restaurant category - but - in 2010 - it would seem to be of huge importance based on the current crop of ad positionings positioning prices. For example - check out this list of price points promoted in the past year in the Atlanta ADI at least: 

 79 cents - Taco Bell (occasionally). 

 99cents - Wendy’s Value Menu - Capt. D’s sides 

 1.00 - McDonald’s Dollar Menu; Burger King, Arby’s, Checkers 

 1.50 (2/3.00) - Checkers, Dairy Queen (occasionally) 

 1.99 - Snack meals - Mrs. Winners, Church’s, KFC (occasionally), Dunkin Donuts, 

 2.00 Denny’s 

 2.50 Subway Breakfast Combo 

 Meals For One 

 2.99 Combo’s - McDonald’s, Wendy’s, Krystal, Boston Market 

 3.99 Long John Silvers, KFC, (4.00)Firehouse Subs&gt;4Pm (4.00) Steak&amp;Shake, (4.00) Quizno’s, 3.99 Hardee’s, (4.00) Denny’s 

 5.00 - Subway Footlong, Boston Market 5.oo + sides, (5.01) Arby’s, (4.99) Waffle House, (4.99) CiCi’s Pizza, (5.00) Little Ceasar Pizza, (4.99) Denny’s, 5.00 - Capt. D’s lunch, (4.99) - Zaxby’s, 

 5.99 Domino’s Pizza, 6.00-Denny’s 

 8.00 Denny’s 

 6.99-9.99 - Friday’s, Ruby Tuesday’s, Ryan’s, Golden Corral, (10.00) Pizza Hut, Folks Restaurant, Red Lobster, Olive Garden, Applebees, 

 And now, with smaller portions becoming more accepted at a reduced price (often with more profit however) - the under 10.00 to eat AT a restaurant perception continues to grow.

 Arby’s Adopts 1.00 Value Menu (In Atlanta At Least) 
 Filed under: 1.00 Value Menu , consumers prefer E-Mail , In-and-Out burgers , trading down to FF , Capt D&apos;s , Arby&apos;s —Rick Phillips @ 16:07 
 Nothing like being a bit late to the party - or - making the move while a 5.01 Combo advertising campaign is going onward - but Arby’s has finally moved to match the direct FF competition. Seems the shift away from advertising specific products and tastes continues. 

 Also seen lately is Capt. D’s once again positioning their food and prices compared to Red Lobster - this time showing a party of two that they could have fed a party of four AND gotten 15.00 back. The tradedown customer is a legit positioning for sure for `dinner’FF restaurants. 

 Finally, some other restaurant links:

 My Perception Of The Woodstock Georgia (Fast Food) Restaurant Market 
 Filed under: Roast Burgers , The Great Recession , Dunkin Donuts , Steak And Shake , daypart pricing , Po Folks , Capt D&apos;s , the new normal , woodstock georgia , Burger Inn , community involvement , New China Buffet , Firehouse Subs , Dairy Queen , Atlanta Bread Company , O&apos;Charley&apos;s , store closings , KFC , IHOP , Wendy&apos;s , Taco Bell , McDonald&apos;s , Five Guys , Checkers , Ruby Tuesday&apos;s , Krystal&apos;s , Burger King , Sonic , Panda Express , Arby&apos;s , Chick-Fil-A , Subway , speed of service —Rick Phillips @ 11:48 
 First, let it be said that my usage of nearly ALL of the restaurants has already assumed the `new normal’of the Great Recession. Regardless of what cheerleading the media may be doing about the economy - most folks are now cautious on discretionary spending - of which, restaurant visits - even to a degree Fast Food restaurant visits - has been impacted. 

 In alphabetical order: 

 Arby’s - I `responded’to the ads for the `Roast Burger’earlier in the year and was not impressed. I refused to respond to the Marry a Goat `humor’ad campaign and somewhat like the recent 5.01 combo or pricing (the one cent being for Quality).  That said, generally, I perceive that Arby’s as expensive without having coupons from the coupon mail drop a few times a year. Additionally, they  `streamlined’their `fries’- dropping my favorite the Homestyle. How can they NOT promote the Jamoca Shake? 

 Atlanta Bread Company (ABC) - Remodeled nicely. Upgraded to real plates and silverware. Messy to clean up. Can be crowded and slow service. Female favorite. Good soups and combo prices. Mellow atmosphere. 

 Burger Inn - Local  legend - all fresh cooked. Great breakfast customer base. Friendly people; newspapers available often. Excellent onion rings. Beefy hamburgers. Male favorite. 

 Burger King - I like the current billboard promotion about the Double Cheeseburger for a buck, real value - but - haven’t gotten it.  I have ordered the Mini burgers more than once however and view that as an excellent addition. Amazingly, the Woodstock BK got rid of Real Sweet Tea years ago (my assumption is that is still the case) and thereby nearly ended my usage—I can’t stand the fake sweet tea out of a machine. Operations should be aware that changing ICONic drinks can have a big effect.—Finally, where is the KING? 

 Capt. D’s - Perhaps my favorite FF in Woodstock. Quality, Quick, and Quantity with good value pricing. Covers all reasonable price points including lunch specials and on-going `specialities’that have all prices. Excellent choice of sides. Funny ads earlier in the year comparing to Red Lobster pricing. Friendly greeting and thanking when exiting. Good inside music. 

 Checkers - Still a viable concept (double drive thru) - chicken wings were a good addition earlier in year - somehow it fits. Catchy phrase“you gotta eat”recognizable for smaller chain levels of advertising. Covers all price points well with a good mix of products. The Woodstock store does Sunday Pricing - good idea - hasn’t ever motivated me for their `down sized’versions. Could probably `play-up’the FUN theme a little bit more. 

 Chick-Fil-A - Woodstock’s Chick-Fil-A is amazingly busy. Overwhelmingly busy whenever they do a promotion like 2-1 for a chicken sandwich or free food giveaway. Excellent quick service regardless of how long the lines are - especially at the drive-thru . (However, I’ve detected a time or two a usage of `workers in India’taking my orders—I’m not kidding - and, in this time of underemployment in America - that is NOT right to save a few cents that way.) Real Milk Shakes were genius. Consistent quality. Friendly employees. Clean.—————All that said, the Woodstock inside service in the sit-down area can be horrid and when is Chick-Fil-A gonna get some normal fries? Also, one takes a chance when getting the baked potato. 

 Dairy Queen -  The standard in Ice Cream desserts from the drive-thru. Haven’t used but really like the new pricing structure in ads 2/3 3/4 4/5.00 - interesting approach. Unfortunately, for me, the food hasn’t broke thru. 

 Dunkin Donuts - Right on the Strip - I’ve never used location. Certainly they can advertise donuts and donut prices more.  (IF I knew a quick Donut sweet was 99 cents for example - it would come to mind for `dessert’or breakfast purchase more often. Never seen a place less concerned with establishing a price point understanding. Just how much does a dozen donuts cost?) 

 Firehouse Subs - Expensive but Excellent. Can be slow. Friendly employees. TV’s to watch. Good real sweet tea. Small, can be crowded. 

 Five Guys Hamburgers - Tangential to Woodstock in Sandy Plains area—good operation - waiting for a Woodstock Location (several good places available perhaps too). 

 IHOP - Expensive, right? What specials? 

 KFC - Closed but not forgotten. Also was one, like BK, to drop sweet tea for a time. 

 Krystal’s - Krystal `fix’a must a few times a year. (Canton Road.) Ad’s featuring Crispy Onions on burger looks very compelling. Wi-Fi add - good idea. 

 McDonald’s - Woodstocks unit re-designs and updates the interiour often - which is nice. Clean. Service can range from excellent to very poor (weekends). Can often find an AJC or USA today in newspaper bin. Separate kids area - thumbs up. Fries can vary in quality. Best FF fish sandwich. 

 New China Buffet - Lunch value leader. Good quality food. Friendly employees. Priced by the pound to go. Widest variety of food. 

 O’Charlies - Stopped going shortly after changed menu restricting Prime Rib to Sundays only. 

 Panda Express - Have never used. Pass by back of lot 3 times a week on way to Walmart. 

 Po Folks - AKA Folks—&gt;Expesive for what you get. 

 Ruby Tuesday’s—How could they get rid of German Potato Salad? (pet peeve). Good miniburgers and platter pricing. Easy to split orders. Great salad bar still. 

 Sonic - I really like their ad’s inside the car with the main guy and his friend and the main guy and his wife. Classic. Best onion rings in Woodstock at FF. To me, tasteless burgers. Fun to use. Daypart pricing on drinks in the afternoon. Fun music playing. 

 Steak And Shake -  Best Milkshake in Woodstock. Can be very expensive without coupons and very reasonable with coupons. Great variety of sides. Great music inside. 

 Subway - Good with pricing with coupons. Good quality. Can be SLOW service. GOOD real sweet tea. Fresh. Daily specials a good way to address pricing. Excellent variety of sandwiches. 

 Taco Bell - Good cheap price positioning. Good Chalupa’s. Good real sweet tea. Good service speed. Good quality overall. 

 Wendy’s - Huge variety in quality - excellent one time - poorish the next. What the heck happened to the fries - almost tasteless compared to yesteryear. I’m told good salads. Expensiveish compared to McD’s. Baked potato good price/quality.

 Spend Less Here (Trade Down) - The `New’Fast Food Mantra 
 Filed under: Capt D&apos;s , Pizza Hut , trading down to FF , China , Burger King , Arby&apos;s , fast food law , Checkers , Red Lobster , Advertising —Rick Phillips @ 06:52 
 This weekend I was watching some sports on TV when the `new’Burger King ad with the King came on the screen. Anything with the KING gets my attention. This one  began with a `consumer’holding a BK sandwich, who evidently `finds’money in his pocket (that shouldn’t be there) and he is complaining about this to a policeman. The policeman says `reverse pickpocket’and asks for a description - which, while being given by the `consumer’results in the classic `THERE HE IS’- cops and `robbers’chase. 

 Off to the races goes The King crossing over a busy street while evading the law. Only to be SMASHED by a yellow cab. (With an impact that could easily kill a real person and you the observer literally feel it.) Yes, t he first viewing had my full attention and brought amusement in addition to the message of BK itself—you can save money by eating with us. Expect to see more of the reverse pickpocket. 

 The BK ad ran within minutes of another FF comparison ad - this one for Capt D’s (seafood). In this one, in a parking lot aside of a Red Lobster,—customers of the RL are approached and asked how much money their meal cost. I saw two different ads on this and one said 80 dollars and the other 100 dollars - at which moment the Capt D’s renegade interviewer brings the RL party over to a makeshift area with a long folding table where Capt D’s employees crank out one meal after another and tell the RL group they could have had `all this’and spent 40.00 less. The mantra, again; you can save money eating with us. 

 Which brings me to the two `fake restaurant’ads currently in the Atlanta market being run by FF brands. The first is the *obnoxious Pizza Hut ads where it is `their pasta’which is being served in the restaurant that evening. So, after `candid’praise for the pasta - the `upscale’diners `laugh’about how they were fooled by the quality. Indeed, why would you be a fool and go to a sit down restaurant, pay thru the roof,—when you can get `restaurant quality’delivered to your door. The mantra, you can save money here, by eating at home. 

 (* what is actually obnoxious is the version of the ad where the PH girl rips her `apron’off to reveal her PH identification - she does it in a manner that somehow shouts—~you idiots-jokes on YOU~). 

 OR, you can also find the other fake restaurant ad for Hardees and their Big Burger products. The idea; don’t pay 8.00 for a 4.00 burger. The mantra; you can save money by eating with us. 

 Finally, in Atlanta, Arby’s stores seem onto the price position with the 99 cent ArbyQ plastered (tastefully) over the store outside banners—while the Checkers down the road makes sure its customerbase knows it has 69 cent Sundays and Wednesdays. 

 Because of the economic uncertainty, the market for the upper middle and lower upper classes for FF restaurants is increasing . Promoting the `savings’with quality  via trading down is one approach - expect to see this even more.
