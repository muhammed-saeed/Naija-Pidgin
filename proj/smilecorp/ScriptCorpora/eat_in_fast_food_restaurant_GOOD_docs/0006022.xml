Three Killer Ways to Smoke Your Meat

Ever since we had our first taste of smoked ice cream last week, we&apos;ve had smoke on the brain. Sure, we could take the easy road and hit our local barbecue joint, but there&apos;s nothing like the feeling you get from smoking your own meat.

If you&apos;ve never tried smoking (food) at home, you may think it&apos;s too difficult/time-consuming/expensive/impossible to do in an apartment, but we&apos;re here to show you there is more than one way to skin a cat. Just don&apos;t smoke it.

 1. Trash Can Smoker (around $50) 
 
 
​ The DIY choice of the bunch, this method is also relatively easy and sure to impress. Head to the hardware store, grab a can, hot plate, metal grate, wood chip box, and a temperature gauge, and consult the guide to put it all together. The space between the meat and the heat will ensure slow cooking and even smoking, and the rig will pay for itself after the second smoke. 
 2. The Smoking Gun from PolyScience ($99.95) 
 
 
​ This contraption might look equally suited for other types of smoking, but for those cooks confined to an apartment, the Smoking Gun will allow you to infuse smoky flavor into just about anything. Simply place a pinch of either hickory, cherry, or applewood (included) into the chamber and add a quick blast of smoke to already-cooked or ready-to-eat foods. There&apos;s no heat involved here; this gadget is simply for adding flavor. Use this to your advantage and smoke things that could never be smoked before, like spinach:

 
 3. The Rolltisserie ($6,695) 
 
 
​ So, you&apos;ve mastered the trash can smoker and you&apos;re ready for an upgrade? Check out the Rolltisserie, a portable, towable, meat-smoking behemoth that can handle 16 racks of ribs or 16 three-pound chickens at once. OK, we admit this is a big upgrade, but with this you could make smoking your full-time gig. Expect to see one of these pissing off the full-sized food trucks at your local meet-up very soon.
