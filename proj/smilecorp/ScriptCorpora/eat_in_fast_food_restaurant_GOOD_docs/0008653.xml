Unfortunately, many of these people will be left with a disfigured joint, more gout attacks and an even more intense pain down the road. In fact, sometimes gout can be one of the most discouraging and painful diseases known to man. But it doesn&apos;t have to be this way!

Thousands of people and even some traditional doctors are now choosing a healthier and simpler approach to gout. These people are using a natural cure gout treatment which works by flushing the cause of gout (uric acid). And not using pain relievers to hide the pain.

And the best part about this treatment is that you can do it from the comfort of your home with your diet, vitamins, minerals, and some simple lifestyle changes.

 Why You Must Flush Uric Acid? 

First off, you need to realize why you are suffering from gout. Gout is primarily a physical disease which is most often caused by your lifestyle. Research shows that being overweight, elevated alcohol consumption, poor dieting, inactivity, and hypertension are some of the primary causes of gout.

And this is partially the result of too much uric acid in the blood stream. Your body is always in the process of flushing many by products which can harm your health and uric acid is one. When uric acid is not flushed from the body, it usually is deposited between the joints and forms into crystals. The crystals are the cause of your pain.

Fortunately, gout research is showing that you can be pro-active about your health and cure the gout symptoms in a matter of days. Here are some suggestions reported from various gout studies.

 5 Ways to Naturally Cure Gout 

 1. Most natural health experts recommend weaning yourself off of doctor-prescribed NSAIDs. Because NSAIDs often give the patient a sense of false hope and hide the pain, we strongly suggest curing the gout symptoms as opposed to hiding the symptoms. Though painful at first, you will ultimately be able to live gout free if you use simple natural remedies to flush uric acid.
 
 2. Secondly, you should also make water your number 1 priority for your day. You should aim to drink at least 100 ounces of water per day. Water naturally cleanses and flushes your body of uric acid and other harmful toxins. By drinking water, you can become healthier and lose up to a pound of fat a week.

 Fact! Most often hunger pains are simply the body asking for more water.

 3. Thirdly, we also recommend a daily baking soda remedy. Because baking soda has a basic pH, you can actually neutralize uric acid in your body with a baking soda remedy. All you need to do is take a half a teaspoon of baking soda and add it to a tall glass of water. Drink up and remedy your gout attacks.

 4. Research shows that gout sufferers are often deficient in vitamins A, B5 and E. Rather than supplementing all of these vitamins, we recommend eating about 8 cherries a day. Cherries are loaded with vitamins and have actually shown to reduce gout attacks.

 5. Finally, we also stress education. Did you know that there are over 20 ways you can naturally cure your gout symptoms. And better yet, there are over 50 changes you can make with your lifestyle to prevent gout from ever affecting you again. Check out this Gout Remedy Report for everything you need to know.
