 Baby Name Trends: From Classic to Hip 
 Posted July 13, 2012 Comments Off | 
Mamma Smith
Goodbye Bertha, Hello Kaitlyn! The top baby names of today break with tradition and follow-up on new trends. Because choosing the perfect name can be a daunting task, many informative web sites have been launched with parents in mind.

A name is central to a child’s earliest sense of identity. It’s often the first word he or she learns to read and write. Naming trends of today are defined by celebrities, literary classics, and even name brands. Look no further than your favorite book, car, or brand for baby name ideas. Names like“Armani”,“Del Monte”,“Infiniti”,“Celica”,“Chevy”, and“Lexus”are increasing in popularity.

Unisex names are another trend that is gaining steam. Parents are using names such as Jordan, Madison, Devon, Bailey, Parker, and Logan on boys and girls. However, when naming a baby, parents must consider if it invites potential teasing. Boys are often targeted more heavily than girls.

Want to add a twist to your baby’s name? Another naming trend includes spelling classical names untraditionally. There are usually at least five different ways to spell any name. This way, you can add variety to a classical favorite.

You could also use a name inspired by nature. Examples for boys include Ashton, Avery, Birch, Bradley, Grant, Holden, Landon, Logan, or Wesley. For girls you could use Beverly, Brooke, Erica, Hayley, Lauren, Lillian, or Olivia.

Want a crafty name? Bailey, Baker, Carter, Cooper, Foster, Mason, Porter, and Turner may be more your style. However, you can’t go wrong with the following chart-topping baby names, whether you prefer the 1900’s or the 1990’s.

Names of the 1900’s:

Boys: John, William, James, Charles and Robert

Girls: Mary, Helen, Elizabeth, Marie, and Alice

Names of the 1990’s:

Boys: Michael, Christopher, Joshua, Jacob, Andrew, David, and Tyler

Girls: Ahley, Emily, Sarah, Amanda, Taylor, Megan, Kayla, and Nicole

Best of luck. ; )

 The Lowdown on Britax Car Seats 
 Posted July 12, 2012 Comments Off | 

As a parent, not only do you want the absolute best for your child, but you’ll also do anything in your power to keep them safe and out of harm’s way. Britax, the number one selling child’s car seat in England, Europe and Australia, has a real, honest investment and passion for designing, developing and producing the safest possible travel for all of our children. Car seats save the lives of countless children around the globe, and Britax wants you to know that they are working continuously on ways to save even more.

From the first moment that you hold your newborn in the hospital, concerns about getting your newest family member home safely fill your mind and don’t go away, as keeping your child safe will always be a main priority in life. You need to choose a car seat manufacturer that values the insurmountable amount of trust that you have placed in their hands. You can rest assured that Britax is and will continuously work with leaders of in child car safety seat field to ensure that they are consistently pushing the boundaries of both the design and safety aspects.

Just under 10 years ago, Britax introduced its exceptional line of child car seats to the finicky U.S. market to the delight of both high-end carmakers (like Porsche and Mercedes) and ecstatic parents. American moms and dads were completely enamored with a car seat that has increased side impact protection and a unique pitch control system that reduces forward movement in the unfortunate event of an accident.

Other than safety, concerns of parents also include their child’s comfort in the car seat, as harsh fabrics can damage baby’s delicate skin.. Britax has heard the calls of troubled parents throughout the UK and around the globe and implemented the Comfi-Flex system. This system combines areas of stylized, soft-to-the-touch fabrics that are not only breathable and flexible, but durable and cleanable as well. The areas of the seat where baby’s bare skin is in direct contact with the seat, such as where those precious cheeks touch the side wings, will never be of concern again!

Another concern of parents is the overall cost of car seats. For this, Britax has created the unique, Adjusta-fit system; enabling your Britax car seat to grow as your child does with the adjustable headrest and harness. The same seat can easily accommodate your child from birth to 65 pounds.

The wide variety of Britax car seats for children offers a product for every need and lifestyle. Britax believes that not only should a car seat be fitted to your child’s weight, but also should fit your automobile, as even the safest car seat in the world won’t function the way it should if it can’t be installed properly.

 Baby Shower-Novel Way Of Arrangement 
 Posted July 12, 2012 Comments Off | 
Baby shower games.

Photo matching - enticing baby shower game- all the guests should bring the baby picture of themselves. Arrange all pictures on a board. Give each picture a number. Each guest has to match the adult guest name with the corresponding baby picture. The guest with the most correct matches wins.

Top Baby Songs- entertaining baby shower game-divide the guests into teams. Ask them to write down as many songs that have the word baby in the title in 3to 5 minutes. The team with most song titles wins. The losers can sing a baby song chosen by the winners.

Baby shower invitations.

Baby Shower invitations can be as formal or informal. The baby shower invitation can be simple or complicated. We can decide that. However, it is worth putting some time and effort into baby shower invitations, because it sets the mode and tone for that special Baby Shower Party.

The invitation must have Time, Date&amp;location of party. The baby shower invitation must contain your telephone and email addresses. We should always remember to include details of the events that need preplanning or preparation.

Baby shower themes.

Baby shower themes are a great idea for a baby shower, by creating a real party atmosphere by matching baby shower invitations, baby shower favors, baby shower decorations, and Baby Shower Games. Below, there are few favorite baby shower themes. We should always remember that the baby shower theme must suit the most important guest [the expectant mother].

Once the baby shower theme is decided, we can use the theme for baby shower invitations, baby shower decorations, Baby Shower games, baby shower cakes, and baby shower favors. . Write an alphabet letter on each guest’s invitation. Ask them to bring a gift beginning with that letter. Decorate the room with letters.

Baby shower gifts

The gifts that we give should be useful for the baby. The baby shower gift may be simple or expensive that depends on our purse weight. Here are few suggestions.

Baby’s First Library: The Runaway Bunny, Big Red Barn, and Goodnight Moon

LullaBag Gift Cradle - Natural Cotton - used up to 12 months, Wooden Two-Step Stool- this comes in 2 colors, Small Photo Album, -used from birth to over 36 months, Classic Red Tricycle used from 24 months and up

Baby shower Cakes

Baby shower cakes are a practical, yet beautiful gift for new parents and baby and made to look just like their name, a cake. These clever little beauties are filled with all kinds of useful baby items such as diapers, bibs, bottles, pacifiers, shoes, socks, etc.

All the things a new parent needs to get them started! This gift is a great centerpiece at a baby shower and as the gift! It is sure to“wow”everybody! Perfect to take to Mom and Baby at the hospital, too.

Baby shower decoration

Baby shower decoration- decorates the room with pictures of famous movie stars and films. We can also decorate the room with pop star posters. We can decorate room as per any children story such as‘Hey Diddle Diddle’or‘Goldilocks. We can use children’s books for table centerpieces. Stack the books and tie ribbon around the books with a big bow on top. Decorate the top with a pacifier.

Stable baby shower decoration-decorate the room as a stable with a manger big enough for Mom. Another type of decoration is Umbrella baby shower decoration-Decorate room with umbrellas, galoshes, etc. Tell all the guests that the forecast says showers today and every one comes in raincoats.

 The Great Baby Name Debate 
 Posted July 11, 2012 Comments Off | 
Winifred or Willow? Thomas or Troy? The name you choose for your child will last a lifetime. Whether you’re looking for something original that will stand out from the crowd or a traditional name that people will instantly recognize, choosing a name for your new baby is a huge responsibility.

It goes without saying that you as the parents must like the name. Names that hold bad associations for you are out (Jeremy was a bore at school, you can’t stand Bella in the Tweenies), and if you consider your own name uninteresting, you may wish to choose something more exotic - or vice versa.

Think carefully about combinations of first name and surname. Are they compatible? You may like a mixture of an unusual first name with a more familiar surname (Zara Phillips), but be careful about rhyming the two names - Mark Clarke won’t thank you for it. Beware initials that could cause hilarity to your child’s future friends - Ethan Thomas or Peter Oliver Ogilvie won’t be joining in the giggles! Trying to be clever can also cause grief - Poppy Fields or Summer Winters may sound cute at the time, but can eventually grate on everyone’s nerves!

If she’s called Grace, will she turn out to be butter-fingered? Will Maximus grow into a Mr. Puniverse? Is Jordan a boy or a girl? What will Elizabeth grow up as? Lizzie? Beth? Liza? And as for Ashleigh, Ashley, Ashlee, Ashlea and Ashlie - all in circulation at the moment - how is anyone supposed to find a name that is both special and appropriate?

Fortunately, sources of inspiration can be found everywhere. You can avoid the throng of Chloes, Emilys, Jacobs and Jacks topping the baby name charts for the past few years, and choose from a huge variety of names collected in specialist books and on the Internet. Some parents prefer biblical names - Rebecca, Abigail, Joshua, Samuel and Joseph are all very popular at the moment. Names inspired by nature include Blossom, Lily or Skye and even Tiger for boys. Place names (Paris, Lamorna), colours (Coral, Ebony), astronomy, music, and sport - all provide a wealth of ideas and choice.

Naming twins presents its own set of challenges. You may wish to link the names in some way using the same first letter (Jack and Jill?) or a theme such as Liberty and Faith, or even similar names like Leo and Eleonora. However, you might end up having two very independent children who don’t wish to be connected by name as well as birthday. A less obvious connection involves using different names with similar meanings such as Columba and Jemima (both meaning dove), or Jonathan and Matthew (gift of God).

For those of us who still haven’t decided even when the stork delivers, the arrival of your newborn may give you all the inspiration you need! Christmas babies often appear as Noel or Noelle, Natalie or Natasha, nighttime births produce star inspired names such as Stella, Esther or Sterling, and for thankful parents after a difficult birth, Nathaniel (gift of God), Abigail (father’s joy) or Miranda (wonderful) might fit the bill.

So whether you plump for Clifford or Condor, Harriet or Harmony, above all have fun choosing that special name - and with careful thought, your child will grow up bearing a name you can all be proud of!

 Infant Car Seat Covers 
 Posted July 11, 2012 Comments Off | 
Infant car seat covers come in many forms ranging from items designed for style to items designed for severe weather conditions. You can find a cover for your baby?s car seat that will not only suit your needs but your tastes as well. Many find that one cover just isn?t enough.

I chose to purchase three infant car seat covers for my little one. She was born right during the throws of winter and the Posh Pouch was a natural choice for our northern climate. This is one of the infant car seat covers that offer great looks along with excellent comfort for the baby.

The Posh Pouch fits right on the baby car seat and serves as a nice, warm backdrop. The item unzips for your little one to fit inside. The product is designed to encircle the baby as she sits in the unit. Just pull the zipper shut and the baby is snug and warm in this well designed product.

What I love about this product is its useful design but I also like the looks as well. The designers took the time to add lovely details on this product. The baby is surrounded in soft pink fur and delicate lining. This is one of the most attractive of the infant car seat covers I saw that were designed for winter weather.

The Posh Pouch is just one of the many infant car seat covers available on the market. I chose a cute cow design for the spring and fall time of year. The weather does get quite a bit chilly during these seasons but not nearly cold enough to warrant using the Posh Pouch.

There are tons of options that keep your baby warm while offering adorable designs as well. The cow design is really special because I dressed my daughter up in a cow costume for her first Halloween. She matched the car seat cover perfectly and I am always reminded of the special occasion each time I use it.

The last or the infant car seat covers is designed for rainy weather. It consists of clear plastic that zippers right over the entire seat unit. This item is great because it can be used in conjunction with the other infant car seat covers. The main purpose of this particular product is to protect the baby from elements like snow and rain or even dust.

There are plenty of other infant car seat covers available. You can definitely find at least one for your specific needs.

 Hints And Tips On Scrapbooking Babys Firsts 
 Posted July 10, 2012 Comments Off | 
It is true to say that a lot of people begin to get the scrappin bug after their child/children are born and usually their first attempt at scrapbooking is making a baby album.

Having a child is one of the most important events in our lives and babys first year is a busy, lively, ever changing journey of discovery. It is full of important milestones


No wonder then, as parents we want to capture and record all those many memorable moments - preserving them in scrapbooks is a great way to safely keep and cherish those memories for years to come.


One timeless and extremely popular baby scrapbooking idea is to make an album that consists of firsts.


This is a relatively easy and flexible theme to follow, especially for someone new to scrapbooking and is a great way to create enchanting baby scrapbooks.


This kind of album usually consists of a scrapbook arranged in chronological order with individual layouts showing special and notable moments in your babys life.


New babies are so photogenic its hard to resist capturing all the big and little things that make up their day-to-day lives.


No doubt you will have lots of pictures to sort through so heres a small list of firsts to give you some ideas for organizing your photos:


 sleep/nap bottle/breast feed diaper change dressed in their first outfit ride in a car seat smiles bath trip out in the buggy solid food teeth sitting up drinking from a cup feeding him/herself crawling walking with the furniture steps/walking on their own hair cut halloween Christmas
 


To add a little more interest to your album try and vary the layouts, for instance make some events into double page spreads. Such as coming home from the hospital or bath-time, which always presents an opportunity for some great photos!


Give your pages a personal touch by adding some memorabilia, using a pocket envelope, to your layouts - like the birth announcement or maybe a lock of hair from their first hair cut.


If you are new to scrapbooking and youre unsure about starting out on your new album then a good choice would be to buy yourself a baby scrapbook kit. These kits contain everything you will need to begin scrapbooking and are a great shortcut to creating super layouts that you can be proud of.


You can also enhance your pages with some of the many baby-related products that are available on the market. Decorate your layout with an adorable or cute baby scrapbook paper.


Then, embellish your page with some charming baby scrapbook stickers like rattles, booties, bibs, bottles etc and when theyre done display all of your beautiful pages in a lovely baby scrapbook album.


Go on give it a go. Make yourself a baby scrapbook to savor and keep all those incredible memories. Youll find its much more than just a scrapbook it will become a precious family keepsake that youll treasure forever.

 Choosing a Toddler Car Seat—How to Ensure Your Child’s Comfort and Safety 
 Posted July 10, 2012 Comments Off | 
 Learn about toddler car seats before you buy. It may not be necessary to purchase an expensive car seat to keep your child safe.

 

Most children are ready to start using a‘toddler’car seat at about six months of age, until they transition into a‘booster’car seat at approximately 2 years of age. Toddler car seats are forward facing, and typically use a combination of the car’s seat belts or a special anchoring system, and a separate harness, to secure the car seat and the child. Many toddler car seats allow the child to ride in either an upright or a reclined position, and some models raise the child up sufficiently to be able to easily see out of the vehicle’s windows while in the upright position. Child car seat manufacturers are bound by very strict guidelines, and you may be surprised to find that some of the more expensive car seats don’t provide any better level of protection than those which are more moderately priced. Child car seat manufacturers are bound by very strict guidelines, and you may be surprised to find that some of the more expensive car seats don?t provide any better level of protection than those which are more moderately priced.?

Toddler car seats come in three basic varieties: (1) those that can be used only as a toddler car seat, (2) those that can be used both as an infant car seat and a toddler car seat, and (3) those that can be used both as a toddler car seat and a booster car seat. Seats that are designed to be used in two different modes are called‘convertible’car seats.

Convertible infant/toddler car seats can be used for children from infancy (with the car seat in the rear facing position), into their toddler years (with the car seat turned around and used in the forward facing position), until they are ready for a booster car seat. In the rear facing mode, these types of car seats can typically be used with a child up to about 25 lbs, and then used in the forward facing position until the child reaches about 40 lbs. These types of car seats have a larger seat than an infant only car seat, and many come with padded inserts for use when the child is still small.

Convertible toddler/booster car seats are forward facing, and typically use both the car’s seat belts and a separate harness during the‘toddler’stage, and just the car’s seat belts during the‘booster’stage.

 Car Seat Cushions 
 Posted July 9, 2012 Comments Off | 
A long drive ahead can prove to be tiring for the person behind the wheel. Staying in one position for a long period of time can cause back pain. If the driver’s seat is not formed well, it does not have the capacity to support your back and spine. It is a good thing, though, that car seat cushions have been invented.

Car seat cushions serve a very specific purpose. They offer a driver support for his back and spine when he is behind the wheel. Of course, as the name implies, these seat cushions have been specially designed and manufactured for car use.

For drivers, the benefits of car seat cushions can be felt most during long drives. Because one is forced to assume an unnatural position for an extended duration, he is most likely to feel strained. Cushions such as these provide comfort and correct the body’s posture so it does not cause undue strain.

Ranging from a manageable price of $12 to a high-end cost of $99.99, car seat cushions have been also made available in a lot of colors, designs, sizes and styles. There are removable car seat cushions as well as cushions that can be used for the home or the office. Different materials have been used to make car cushions. Bamboo, leather, wool and nylon are only some of these. Nowadays, car seat cushion manufacturers have become more and more creative in terms of aesthetic appeal.

Aside from their obvious function, car seat cushions are also known for their visual charm. If you use one everyday, you can get yours personalized to reflect your personality. You can hire someone to make you a cushion in your desired color, style and material. Other more innovative options are available. You can get a car cushion that can wrap around your chair or one that looks like a stuffed toy but actually provides you with sufficient back support.

 How To Talk To Your Baby And Understand What Shes Saying Back 
 Posted July 8, 2012 Comments Off | 
Engineer It is incredible, but within a years time your baby will progress from random crying to talking. This is quite an achievement for your baby and in a very short period of time. In this chapter we will look at your babys development when it comes to language. Youll also discover what you can expect to see every month but its important to remember that these stages of your babys development are broad and because every baby is different these are not meant as exact milestones.

One month. Your baby will be able to understand speech long before actually talking. From birth he will look at your face and listen to your voice. He may make a small range of noises that will start to mean something to you - these may be made when he experiences feelings of hunger or pain (such as crying and certain sounds while he is breathing). When your baby is eating, you may notice him making sucking type noises and sounds of contentment. The way that your baby cries is an important communication method while he is actually unable to talk. Crying lays the foundation for speech as your baby learns to control his vocal cords. Crying is also a babys way of indicating hunger, discontentment, or general discomfort. Through responding to this crying you let your baby know that she is important to you and this can really be reassuring for a young infant.

Two months. As a child enters his second month he is far more aware of the world things such as sounds, even that of your voice, will amuse and fascinate your child. Change the tone of your voice and this will keep him amused. Your baby will respond with a variety of cooing sounds, vowel-like sounds, and sometimes some consonant sounds such as a k. You will find that your baby has quite a collection of cooing sounds that she uses to communicate with you as well as discover how to use the sound of her own voice. During this time, try and talk with your baby this will encourage her response and help in the development process. By looking into your babys eyes you are communicating an important thing to her that you are listening.

Three months. By now you will find that your baby is able to recognize your voice and may come to you or face you when your voice is heard. You may notice him laugh out aloud and may even scare himself by doing this (as he does not initially know that he is the one making the sounds). Your baby will be making sounds such as ahhhh gooo. He will squeal when he is happy and content, again often startling himself as he learns his own abilities.

At this stage you should not only talk to your baby but also introduce other communication forms such as singing and story telling. The greater your effort in trying to talk with him, the better his response is likely to be.

Four months. By now more and more communication should be taking place with your baby. You may notice a greater amount of smiling while his babbling may have a noticeably singsong quality to it, often ranging into a high pitch that delights him as he learns to like the sound of his own voice. There will be lots of repetition to the sounds that your baby makes.

It is important that you always respond to your babys oohs and ahhs and whatever other communication methods she is using - respond with your own voice tones. This is your chance to have a chat time with your baby and you should take advantage of these times you are helping him to discover the art of conversation. There will also be certain times when your baby may also not be in the mood for talking. He will turn his head in the other direction and may put his arm over his face. He may be showing signs of anger or frustration by crying out, especially if something is taken away from him.

Five months. As each month progresses you will find that your baby is becoming better at communicating. Its possible that you will notice him imitate some sounds and gestures. By now hell most likely be able to let you know if hes happy or sad. When attention is wanted your baby will babble until he is given the attention he feels he deserves. Interestingly, if you always respond to his communication efforts (whatever these may be) hell repeat them whenever he wants your attention this way.

During this month its likely that your baby will be looking at your mouth moving while you talk. Talk to him from across the room and hell be able to find you with ease. He is learning to control his vocal sounds as he watches your response to his sounds.

Six months. Your baby may now be using consonant-vowel combinations. Its quite possible that he has discovered his mirror reflection and is probably having conversations with himself. Your babys language is becoming much more precise.

Here are some ways that you can help your baby develop her language skills:

Speak very slowly and clearly.

Identify and point out items, objects and people as you talk about them.

Use shorter sentences sentences.

Using repetition when singing songs and nursery rhymes helps the learning process.

Reading to your baby is a good idea and should be done as often as possible ask your baby questions and point things out to make the process as interactive as possible.

Let your baby respond in his own way when communicating with her.

Seven months. Your baby is now continuing to learn how to use his newfound language skills. He may be able to do things such as wave goodbye and may accompany his wave with babbling sounds. He can say mama or dada.

Eight months. Your baby is playing games such as pat a cake and peek-a-boo. Even though he cant speak the words that belong to these games, he can babble and talk to himself. Its likely that your baby knows what the word No means by now as well.

Nine to twelve months. Its possible that by now your baby understands requests and commands such as give it or dont touch that. Similarly, she may understand simple questions such as wheres your rattle? At this time you should be encouraging your baby to use gestures (and you should respond to them). For example if your baby indicates she wants to be picked up then say you want to be picked up? while picking her up. This helps the learning process. You should also talk about everything that you do, and use gestures (and short sentences) as youre doing them.

Here are some ways to help your baby with the learning process:
Look at books and talk about the pictures in simple languages. Where possible try and use books that your baby is able to hold.

Talk often to your baby using simple words to identify objects in his life. Name trees, numbers, colours, and animals as you take your baby for a walk. You should also use your babys name often this way she will be able to recognise it.

Talk back to your child when she talks with you.

Introduce concepts to your baby, such as the big dog or the little mouse.

Give your baby time to get his words out; dont be tempted to complete sentences for him.

Continue to read to your baby as much as possible. Reading should be part of your daily routine.

From day one start to talk in a simple, short and uncomplicated way with your baby even though she will not understand what you are saying this is laying the foundations for learning language.

Twelve months. After one year babies are generally able to say one or two words and are able to understand 25 words or more. For example if a person in the room asks, where is daddy? your baby will look for you. Your baby is also able to point at things (and ask for things in this way).

Breast Feeding Basics For Your Newborn Baby Keziah .EngineerIt is a myth that bottle-feeds and breast-feeding is equally good. Mothers milk is the best for proper growth of the child. There are certain nutrients in the mothers milk that helps the baby fight illnesses while also promoting brain development. As compared to breast fed babies, the formula-fed babies are more prone to illnesses.

Ideally you should start breast feeding the child within 2 hours of its birth, but do not worry if for some reason you are not able to do so - many mothers feed their children after a few days because of some medical reasons and they turn out to be just fine. Apart from milk avoid giving the child any water or pacifier because the child is still learning to breast-feed and things like the bottle nipple and pacifiers can confuse the baby while nursing because milk doesnt flow as fast as it does through bottles.

Do give the child enough time to breast-feed. Dont limit the time. It could frustrate the baby. An average of about 10 to 45 minutes can be taken by the baby to completely satisfy itself.

So how should you hold your baby during breast feeding? The answer to this is that see to it that the gums of the baby are on top of the areola because there is a chance of nipples becoming sore if the baby just chews on the nipple instead of taking in the areola. You can hold the baby in a cuddling position and feed it or you can lie on your side placing your baby facing you. Usually when the baby has had enough milk it will let go of the nipple on its own, but the baby takes usually half an hour on each side.

Well now move on to another critical issue which every breast-feeding mother needs to know about what to eat during the process of breast feeding. It is very important for a breastfeeding mother to have a healthy and balanced diet. A variety of foods are required during this period including:
Get lots of vegetables and fruits try and have an intake of 5 portions a day of fruit and veg.

For additional energy try and take in starch rich foods such as bread, pasta, potatoes, pulses and rice this will provide a good source of energy.

Foods such as wholemeal bread, vegetables, pulses, cereals and pastas will provide fibre women occasionally experience bowel problems after childbirth and an intake of fibre on a daily basis will help with this.

Proteins such as lean meat, fish, eggs and poultry.

Try and get two portions of fish per week (including some oily fish). Do not exceed 2 portions of oily fish per week.

Dairies such as cheese, milk and yoghurt are an excellent source of calcium and should be included in a breast feeding mothers diet.

Some doctors advise taking vitamin supplements such as Vitamin D (10 mcg per day). Your doctor will be able to advise which supplements will be right for you.

In addition to the foods that you should eat above there are certain food types that you should steer clear of at this time. As above you should restrict your intake of oily fish to two portions per week but you should also avoid eating more than one portion of swordfish, marlin or shark per week as these fish contain high levels of mercury. You should also be careful with your intake of caffeine and alcohol. It is true that some breast feeding babies react to the foods that their mother has consumed. Some doctors believe that it is wise to lay off peanuts during this stage as well approximately 2% of the population is allergic to peanuts however your baby may have a higher chance of being allergic if the mother/father/brothers/sisters have problems such as asthma, eczema or hayfever. If you believe your baby may be at risk due to these factors it is worth consulting your doctor.

 Baby is Coming, Are You Ready? 
 Posted July 8, 2012 Comments Off | 
It has been a long pregnancy. You are probably tired and feeling worn more often then not. But, are you prepared for baby’s arrival? Do you have all the baby clothes, baby furniture and bedding that you need? Perhaps you aren’t even sure what you need to have? Not to worry, even if you didn’t have a baby shower to help you prepare, you can find all the items you need for baby right under your nose!

One of the biggest worries when a mom to be is preparing for baby is the baby’s room. Having the proper baby furniture and bedding is essential. But, what do you need and what isn’t necessary? Sure, it’s nice to have a whole room designed to a nursery theme with crib, rocker, bassinet, and changing table. But, all of those products aren’t necessary and in fact, baby isn’t going to care what she gets her diaper changed on. Changing tables are one thing that can be eliminated as well as the bassinet. Cribs and baby bedding are made to support any size baby from a newborn to a toddler. So, while these products are great to have, don’t worry if you don’t have them.

As for baby clothing, you will want to pamper baby for sure with cute outfits, little booties, and hats. But, the truth of the matter is, during the beginning months of baby’s life, he or she won’t have too many big outings to go to. In fact, mom and baby will probably spend a lot of their time resting up for the next feeding in the middle of the night. Again, yes it is great to have a dresser full of cuteness, but reality is, a few cute outfits will do just as well. Now, you should not short yourself on onesies and sleepers. Baby will spend most of his or her day in these and will more then likely need a few per day depending on how much baby decides to spit up. Don’t forget the diapers! Having several burping clothes and blankets will also help.

Does all this discourage you? Every parent wants to give their child the best every step of the way. But, having the best furniture and clothing isn’t going to help baby in any way. If you really want to find some or all of these items but don’t have a large budget to work with, you do have other options. The most obvious of these is to ask family and friends for hand me downs. More then likely, they will be happy to lend you the items they no longer need. Or, if someone is asking you what you need, don’t be afraid to tell them what you would like to have. Also, search around garage sales and thrift shops. You can clean and repaint just about anything you find. Saving money this way will help with the ever demanding diaper fund you will have to have!
