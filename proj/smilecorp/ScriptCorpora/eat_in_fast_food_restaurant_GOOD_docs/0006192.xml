Olive restaurant and bar open near 173
 Posted on June 25, 2009 at 5:54 pm by Melissa Westphal Tweet 
 

There’s a new dining spot near Illinois 173, and the owner’s name is sure to be familiar.

Olive Kitchen and Cocktails, 1001 W. Lane Road, in Machesney Park had a soft opening last week and a busy first weekend, said Mike Muzzarelli, one of the restaurant’s managers. Muzzarelli is also the food and beverage director at the Radisson Hotel&amp;Conference Center.

High-profile businessman Sunil Puri, president of First Rockford Group, owns Olive, which is his first dining venture outside of the Radisson, which houses the Forest City Pub.

Olive’s restaurant features mostly American fare, like sandwiches, homemade soups, salads, pasta dishes and steaks. Muzzarelli said a special breaded olive appetizer, club sandwich and Friday night prime rib special have been the most popular dishes so far.

The restaurant does have a banquet room that can hold about 90 people, so Muzzarelli said Olive will be available for small parties and do catering.

Check out more about Olive at oliveat173.com or call 815-316-3333.

I would’nt waster your money, OR YOUR TIME with this place. I took my mom here on her birthday, and from the very start service was bad..then to down right the worst service i’ve ever experienced. I understand with a new resturant, that there will be kinks to iron out, we understood this when our appitizer arrived uncooked, as in a big hunk of cheese as dip, with soggy chips. We waited 10-15 min just to be waited on with drinks. We were there 11/2 hours and still did’nt recieve our SALADS with no meat, just SALAD. 6 people had come and gone, and we still ahd not eaten, but our uncooked appitizer. My son was at home with my dad, who started running a fever, my father tried to call us, and we didnt hear the phones, so he called the resturant, and the resturant said they were to busy to tell us that my father was trying to call in regards to my sick child. We got up without eating out salads. They only discounted out appitizer, that was uncooked. Needless to say, we will never go back, and neither should you.

My wife and I went there last month and found the restaurant to be both pleasant and reasonably priced. We especially liked the olive cheese appetizer. The bill was especially reasonable. The service was excellant. Our anniversary date was special thanks to them..

We visited your establishment last Friday evening for the purpose of having fish. 1st I have to say the the atmosphere and service was great. The 2nd is BUT the fish was less than good. The baked was served over done and the battered fish way to much coating. We said this to the waitress and she apologized. When asked if ours have said anything, she commented yes. Then wanted to know if she should contact the manager and send them over. We said no and left. We should not have to ask for a manager to say our remarks about the meal. Sorry to have to comment negative about our recent experience.

Positive: A nice mid-range upscale spot. Took my wife there for lunch on a Friday. Food was very good. I had the vegetable pasta.
Coffee was hot and fine which is a point that I use to judge a place.
We would go again.

A couple of things that could be improved:
-cloth napkins would really make a better impression, I would spend another dime to help with the laundry—or at least better quality paper napkins; the McDonald’s grade just don’t cut it.

-men’s restroom didn’t appear to have been touched since the evening before-could use some attention before opening.

We spent a very plesant Saturday afternoon at Olive. The restaurant was fairly empty, but we had a great time. Our wait person was excellent–but again, there was virtually no one else there (we were there between lunch and dinner times). We did meet some very interesting people from the banquet room and the over all experience was grand! We loved it and plan to go back to support this new local restaurant. I hope the positive feeling remains!
Prices were very reasonable and we had no problems with our food or service.
Good Luck Olive–listen to your customers–we want you to stick around.
