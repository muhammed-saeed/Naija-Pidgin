 CLINTON, MS (WLBT) - 
Eight days after the tornadoes, people in Clinton took a break today to enjoy the spring sunshine and attend a classic car show.

Some of the most beautiful vintage cars around lined the parking lot at Clinton Plaza Saturday morning. From classic GTO&apos;s to Mustangs, proud owners were happy to talk about their restored vehicles. The cars were part of a parade before they cruised to the Plaza.

It&apos;s put on by the group called &quot;Main Street Clinton&quot;. &quot;We&apos;re trying to make all people in the Jackson area aware of this part of Clinton, trying to bring families to the Clinton area, just show what Clinton has to offer,&quot; says David Winborne, President of Main Street Clinton.

Organizers say the timing was perfect: assistance groups had been set up in the Plaza parking lot until Friday.
