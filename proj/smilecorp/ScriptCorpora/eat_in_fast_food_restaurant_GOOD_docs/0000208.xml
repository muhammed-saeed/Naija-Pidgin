 ...little place, BIG burgers!
 
 
With a wide variety of foods, our menu has something that will please everyone in the family. We don&apos;t consider our restaurant to be an average fast food restaurant. Everything on our menu is not cooked until you order it.
 We cut our vegetables fresh daily, insuring your food with the freshest taste. Our pastrami and chicken is cut daily and seasoned to perfection. Our specialty dressings, ranch and thousand, are made from our treasured recipes we&apos;ve kept in the family for years.
 We have REAL milkshakes made with ice cream and milk. Our famous onion rings, zucchini and mushrooms are cut fresh and battered daily.
We care about the food we serve and always take care of our customers.

 
 
 
 

 
 If you&apos;re on the go, our drive thru is always open!
 
 
 For faster service, call ahead and place your order, we&apos;ll have it ready for you to pick up.
 
 
We offer a 10% discount to company or large family orders over $50.
