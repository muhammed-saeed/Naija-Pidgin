 FROM A NEWLY DISOVERED SCROLL OF GENESIS

And Adam said,&quot;Lord, I am lonesome in the Garden, and it
is difficult for me to remember how much you love me.&quot;
And the Lord God said,&quot;I will create a companion for you
that will be with you forever and who will be a reflection of
my love for you, so that you will know that I love you, even when
you cannot see me. Regardless of how selfish and childish and
unlovable you may be, this new companion will accept you as you
are and will love you as I do, in spite of yourself.&quot;
And God created a new animal to be a companion for Adam.
And it was a good animal.
And God was pleased.
And the new animal was pleased to be with Adam and he wagged his
tail.
And Adam said,&quot;But Lord, I have already named all the animals
in the
Garden and all the good names are taken, and I cannot think of
a name
for this new animal.&quot;
And God said,&quot;Because I have created this animal to be a
reflection of
my love for you, his name shall be a reflection of my own name,
and you
shall call him Dog.&quot;
And Dog lived with Adam and was a companion to him and loved him.
And Adam was comforted.
And God was pleased.
And Dog was content and wagged his tail.
After a while, it came to pass that Adam&apos;s guardian angel came
to the
Lord God and said,&quot;Lord, Adam has become filled with pride.
He struts
and preens like a peacock, and he believes he is worthy of adoration.
Dog has indeed taught him that he is loved, but no one has taught
him humility.&quot;
And God said,&quot;I will create for him another companion who
will be with him forever and who will see him as he is. This companion
will remind Adam of his limitations, so he will know that he is
not worthy of adoration.&quot;
And God created Cat to be a companion to Adam.
And Cat would not obey Adam.
And when Adam gazed into Cat&apos;s eyes, he was reminded that he was
not the
supreme being.
And Adam learned humility.
And God was pleased.
And Adam was greatly improved.
And Cat did not care one way or the other. 

 

 

 DOG FIGHT 

 The Americans and Russians at the height of the arms race
realized that if they continued in the usual manner they were
going to blow up the whole world. One day they sat down and decided
to settle the whole dispute with one dog fight. They would have
five years to breed the best fighting dog in the world and which
ever side&apos;s dog won would be entitled to dominate the world. The
losing side would have to lay down its arms. 

 The Russians found the biggest meanest Doberman and Rottweiler
females in the world and bred them with the biggest meanest Siberian
wolves. They selected only the biggest and strongest puppy from
each litter, killed his siblings, and gave him all the milk. They
used steroids and trainers and after five years came up with the
biggest meanest dog the world had ever seen. Its cage needed steel
bars that were five inches thick and nobody could get near it. 

 When the day came for the dog fight, the Americans showed
up with a strange animal. It was a nine foot long Dachshund. Everyone
felt sorry for the Americans because they knew there was no way
that this dog could possibly last ten seconds with the Russian
dog. When the cages were opened up, the Dachshund came out of
it&apos;s cage and slowly waddled over towards the Russian dog. 

 The Russian dog snarled and leaped out of it&apos;s cage and
charged the American dachshund. But, when it got close enough
to bite the Dachshund&apos;s neck, the Dachshund opened it&apos;s mouth
and consumed the Russian dog in one bite. There was nothing left
at all of the Russian dog. The Russians came up to the Americans
shaking their heads in disbelief.&quot;We don&apos;t understand how
this could have happened. We had our best people working for five
years with the meanest Doberman and Rottweiler females in the
world and the biggest meanest Siberian wolves.&quot;&quot;That&apos;s
nothing&quot;, an American replied.&quot;We had our best plastic
surgeons working for five years to make an alligator look like
a Dachshund. 

 

 

 THINGS WE CAN LEARN FROM A DOG: 

 Never pass up an opportunity to go for a joy ride. 

 Allow the experience of fresh air&amp;the wind in your
face to be pure ecstasy. 

 When loved ones come home, always run to greet them. 

 When it is in your best interest, practice obedience. 

 Let others know when they have invaded your territory. 

 Take naps and stretch before rising. 

 Run, romp, and play daily. 

 Eat with gusto and enthusiasm. 

 Be loyal. 

 Never pretend to be something you are not. 

 If what you want lies buried, dig until you find it. 

 When someone is having a bad day, be silent, sit close by
and nuzzle them gently. 

 Thrive on attention and let people touch you. 

 Avoid biting when a simple growl will do. 

 On hot days, drink lots of water and lay under a shady tree. 

 When you are happy, dance around and wag your entire body. 

 No matter how often you are scolded, don&apos;t buy into the
guilt thing and pout. 

 

 

 IF YOU CAN... 

 If you can start the day without caffeine, 

 If you can get going without pep pills, 

 If you can always be cheerful, ignoring aches and pains, 

 If you can resist complaining and boring people with your
troubles, 

 If you can eat the same food everyday and be grateful for
it, 

 If you can understand when your loved ones are too busy
to give you any time, 

 If you can overlook it when those you love take it out on
you when, 

 through no fault of yours, something goes wrong, 

 If you can take criticism and blame without resentment, 

 If you can ignore a friend&apos;s limited education and never
correct him, 

 If you can resist treating a rich friend better than a poor
friend, 

 If you can face the world without lies and deceit, 

 If you can conquer tension without medical help, 

 If you can relax without liquor, 

 If you can sleep without the aid of drugs, 

 If you can say honestly that deep in your heart you have
no prejudice 

 against creed, color, religion or politics, 

 Then, my friend, you are almost as good as your dog.

 The Dog Dictionary 

 

 LEASH: A strap which attaches to your collar, 

 enabling you to lead your person where you want 

 him/her to go. 

 

 DOG BED: any soft, clean surface, such as the 

 white bedspread in the guest room or the newly 

 upholstered couch in the living room. 

 

 DROOL: Is what you do when your persons have food 

 and you don&apos;t. To do this properly you must sit as 

 close as you can and look sad and let the drool 

 fall to the floor or better yet, on their laps. 

 

 SNIFF: A social custom to use when you greet other 

 dogs. Place your nose as close as you can to the 

 other dogs rear end and inhale deeply, repeat 

 several times, or until your person makes you 

 stop. 

 

 GARBAGE CAN: A container which your neighbors put 

 out once a week to test your ingenuity. You must 

 stand on your hind legs and try to push the lid 

 off with your nose. If you do it right you are 

 rewarded with margarine wrappers to shred, beef 

 bones to consume and moldy crusts of bread. 

 

 BICYCLES: Two-wheeled exercise machines, invented 

 for dogs to control body fat. To get maximum 

 aerobic benefit, you must hide behind a bush and 

 dash out, bark loudly and run alongside for a few 

 yards. The person then swerves and falls into the 

 bushes, and you prance away. 

 

 DEAFNESS: This is a malady which affects dogs when 

 their person wants them in and they want to stay 

 out. Symptoms include staring blankly at the 

 person, then running in the opposite direction, or 

 lying down. 

 

 THUNDER: This is a signal that the world is coming 

 to an end. Humans remain amazingly calm during 

 thunderstorms, so it is necessary to warn them of 

 the danger by trembling uncontrollably, panting, 

 rolling your eyes wildly, and following at their 

 heels. 

 

 WASTEBASKET: This is a dog toy filled with paper, 

 envelopes, and old candy wrappers. When you get 

 bored, turn over the basket and strew the papers 

 all over the house until your person comes home. 

 

 SOFAS: Are to dogs like napkins are to people. 

 After eating it is polite to run up and down the 

 front of the sofa to wipe your whiskers clean. 

 

 BATH: This is a process by which the humans drench 

 the floor, walls and themselves. You can help by 

 shaking vigorously and frequently. 

 

 LOVE: Is a feeling of intense affection, given 

 freely and without restriction. The best way you 

 can show your love is to wag your tail. If you&apos;re 

 lucky, a human will love you in return. 

 

 

 Dog Haiku 

    I love my master;
Thus I perfume myself with
This long-rotten squirrel. 

   I lie belly-up
In the sunshine, happier than
You ever will be 

   Today I sniffed
Many dog butts-I celebrate
By kissing your face. 

   I sound the alarm!
Paperboy-come to kill us all-
Look! Look! Look! Look!  Look! 

   I sound the alarm!
Mailman Fiend-come to kill us all-
Look! Look! Look! Look! Look! 

   I sound the alarm!
Meter reader-come to kill all-
Look! Look! Look! Look! Look! 

   I sound the alarm!
Garbage man-come to kill us all-
Look! Look! Look! Look! Look! 

   I sound the alarm!
Neighbor&apos;s cat-come to kill us all!
Look!  Look! Look! Look! Look! 

   I lift my leg and
Wiz on each bush. Hello, Spot -
Sniff this and weep 

   How do I love thee?
The ways are numberless as
My hairs on the rug. 

   My human is home!
I am so ecstatic I have
 Made a puddle 

   I hate my choke chain -
Look, world, they strangle me!
Ack Ack Ack Ack Ack! 

   Sleeping here, my chin
On your foot - no greater bliss - well,
Maybe catching cats 

   Look in my eyes and
Deny it. No human could
Love you as much I do 

   The cat is not all
Bad-she fills the litter box
With Tootsie Rolls 

   Dig under fence-why?
Because it&apos;s there. Because it&apos;s
There. Because it&apos;s there. 

   I am your best friend,
Now, always, and especially
When you are eating. 

   You may call them fleas,
But they are far more -I call
Them a vocation 

   My owners&apos; mood is
Romantic-I lie near their
Feet. I fart a big one.
