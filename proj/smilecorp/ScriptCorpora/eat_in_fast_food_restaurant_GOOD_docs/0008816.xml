 green portion in burger

 Tweet I purchased a whopper (buy one get one w/coupon) at 15:43 hrs / 3:43 p.m. on January 4, 2008. at the Burger King on Brookhurst St. Store #11086. Since it was in drive-thru, I didn&apos;t have a chance to look at anything before driving away.

While stopping to eat the burger, I casually looked at it after I had taken a couple of bites. Something looked green, not lettuce, or pickle, but almost blue-green, I looked more closely and it was actually a part of the burger itself, not something added on top.

I stopped eating it cause it looked nasty, went back to the Burger King and contacted the manager-on-duty, who appeared to be 20 years old. I showed him the inside of the burger and asked him if he knew what it was. He said he had no idea. I said I wanted to file a complaint and he said,&quot;we don&apos;t do that here&quot;. I asked him what I needed to do to file a complaint. At this point, I&apos;m getting really concerned about the kind of&apos;whatever&apos;attitude. He said to call the number on the back of the receipt.

I said fine, but asked to have the burger back so I had proof of my complaint, he gave it back to me at least, didn&apos;t throw it in a shredder to destroy the evidence. I later looked on the back of the receipt and its a flippin customer survey number so you can come back, buy something and then get a free whopper. I did the survey, thinking if I did maybe there would be a live person, but it was touch key thing all the way,

I then went online looking for a customer service number, corporate contact, something for Burger King, nothing. So, here I am. I&apos;m putting the burger in the freezer till I get a hold of somebody at their corporate headquarters. Does anyone know of a corporate number I can use? Thanks for your help.
