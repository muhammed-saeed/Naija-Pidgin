 Muckraking Friend of Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson Was &quot;Intrigued by Mussolini&quot; and &quot;Captivated by Lenin&quot;

 (p. 29) As one of the original &quot;muckrakers,&quot; Steffens wrote newspaper and magazine expos√©s that gave journalism a new purpose, . . .

. . .


He learned to write and to invest, and within nine years was the managing editor of McClure&apos;s, one of the most popular and prestigious magazines in the country.

He was, as usual, in the right place at the right time. Volatile Sam McClure was transforming his namesake publication into a journal that would rip the veil from American life, forcing readers to confront the corruption that had seeped into every seam of their democracy. The January 1903 issue alone featured an installment of Ida Tarbell&apos;s groundbreaking history of the Standard Oil Company; . . .


. . .


He managed to remain friends with Roosevelt and then Woodrow Wilson . . .


. . .


Intrigued by Mussolini, Steffens was captivated by Lenin, whom he interviewed briefly during the revolution. He became one of the first of that sad little band of Western intellectuals who fell head over heels for the Soviet Union. Unlike most of them, he did not deny the stories of atrocities leaking out of the workers&apos; paradise. Even more chilling, he simply believed them necessary to bring about the great changes to come. He never wavered from his infamous first impression of the U.S.S.R., &quot;I have seen the future, and it works.&quot; Instead, living comfortably on money he made from the stock market, he insisted that &quot;nothing must jar our perfect loyalty to the party and its leaders,&quot; and that &quot;the notion of liberty . . . is false, a hangover from our Western tyranny.&quot;

 Love Canal as a &quot;Pseudo-Event&quot; Caused by an &quot;Availability Cascade&quot; 
 


 (p. 142) An availability cascade is a self-sustaining chain of events, which may start from media reports of a relatively minor event and lead up to public panic and large-scale government action. On some occasions, a media story about a risk catches the attention of a segment of the public, which becomes aroused and worried. This emotional reaction becomes a story in itself, prompting additional coverage in the media, which in turn produces greater concern and involvement. The cycle is sometimes sped along deliberately by &quot;availability entrepreneurs,&quot; individuals or organizations who work to ensure a continuous flow of worrying news. The danger is increasingly exaggerated as the media compete for attention-grabbing headlines. Scientists and others who try to dampen the increasing fear and revulsion attract little attention, most of it hostile: anyone who claims that the danger is overstated is suspected of association with a &quot;heinous cover-up.&quot; The issue becomes politically important because it is on everyone&apos;s mind, and the response of the political system is guided by the intensity of public sentiment. The availability cascade has now reset priorities. Other risks, and other ways that resources could he applied for the public good, all have faded into the background.

Kuran and Sunstein focused on two examples that are still controversial: the Love Canal affair and the so-called Alar scare. In Love Canal, buried toxic waste was exposed during a rainy season in 1979, causing contamination of the water well beyond standard limits, as well as a foul smell. The residents of the community were angry and frightened, and one of them, (p. 143) Lois Gibbs, was particularly active in an attempt to sustain interest in the problem. The availability cascade unfolded according to the standard script. At its peak there were daily stories about Love Canal, scientists attempting to claim that the dangers were overstated were ignored or shouted down, ABC News aired a program titled The Killing Ground , and empty baby-size coffins were paraded in front of the legislature. A large number of residents were relocated at government expense, and the control of toxic waste became the major environmental issue of the 1980s. The legislation that mandated the cleanup of toxic sites, called CERCLA, established a Superfund and is considered a significant achievement of environmental legislation. It was also expensive, and some have claimed that the same amount of money could have saved many more lives if it had been directed to other priorities. Opinions about what actually happened at Love Canal are still sharply divided, and claims of actual damage to health appear not to have been substantiated. Kuran and Sunstein wrote up the Love Canal story almost as a pseudo-event, while on the other side of the debate, environmentalists still speak of the &quot;Love Canal disaster.&quot;

 Experience Can Provide Sound Intuitive Knowledge 
 


 (p. 11) . . . , the accurate intuitions of experts are better explained by the effects of prolonged practice than by heuristics. We can now draw a richer and more balanced picture, in which skill and heuristics are alternative sources of intuitive judgments and choices.

The psychologist Gary Klein tells the story of a team of firefighters that entered a house in which the kitchen was on fire. Soon after they started hosing down the kitchen, the commander heard himself shout, &quot;Let&apos;s get out of here!&quot; without realizing why. The floor collapsed almost immediately after the firefighters escaped. Only after the fact did the commander realize that the fire had been unusually quiet and that his ears had been unusually hot. Together these impressions prompted what he called a &quot;sixth sense of danger.&quot; He had no idea what was wrong, but he knew something was wrong. It turned out that the heart of the fire had not been in the kitchen but in the basement beneath where the men had stood.

We have all heard such stories of expert intuition: the chess master who walks past a street game and announces &quot;White mates in three&quot; without stopping, or the physician who makes a complex diagnosis after a single glance at a patient. Expert intuition strikes us as magical, but it is not. Indeed, each of us performs feats of intuitive expertise many times each day. Most of us are pitch-perfect in detecting anger in the first word of a telephone call, recognize as we enter a room that we were the subject of the conversation, and quickly react to subtle signs that the driver of the car in the next lane is dangerous. Our everyday intuitive abilities are no less marvelous than the striking insights of an experienced firefighter or physician--only more common.

The psychology of accurate intuition involves no magic. Perhaps the best short statement of it is by the great Herbert Simon, who studied chess masters and showed that after thousands of hours of practice they come to see the pieces on the board differently from the rest of us. You can feel Simon&apos;s impatience with the mythologizing of expert intuition when he writes: &quot;The situation has provided a cue; this cue has given the expert access to information stored in memory, and the information provides the answer. Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition.&quot;

 Steve Jobs Showed that Art and Commerce Could Be &quot;Happy Bedfellows&quot;

 (p. 2) Gary Oldman is an English actor . . . widely known for his roles as Sirius Black in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series and Jim Gordon in the Batman movies.

. . .


 READING Right now I&apos;m reading the Steve Jobs biography by Walter Isaacson. I love when people have a singleness of purpose and don&apos;t get dissuaded. I can connect with that. I can recognize it. I think a lot of artists have that. Art and commerce are not particularly happy bedfellows, but he was the exception.

I read quite a lot of biographies. I like nonfiction. The other book I&apos;m carrying around with me at the moment is &quot;River of Shadows: Eadweard Muybridge and the Technological Wild West&quot; by Rebecca Solnit. It deals with the 19th century and the arrival of speed with the coming of the industrial age. We were very much governed by nature before; we were at the mercy of our own speed and horses and the like. It&apos;s interesting to think of living at that pace.

 Our Cups Will Runneth Over If We Choose Entrepreneurship, Imagination, Will and Optimism 
 


 



















Source of book image: http://www.abundancethebook.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/cover-NYTimes-3d-500.jpg?139d23 



 (p. 18) in Silicon Valley, where the locals tend to be too busy starting companies to wallow in gloom, Peter Diamandis has stood out as one of the more striking optimists. Several years ago, Diamandis founded the X Prize Foundation, which rewards entrepreneurs with cash for achieving difficult goals, like putting a reusable spaceship into flight on a limited budget. More recently he helped start Singularity University, an academic program that convenes several weeks a year in the Valley and educates business leaders about the &quot;disruptive&quot; -- i.e., phenomenally innovative -- technological changes Diamandis is anticipating. To be sure, Diamandis is both very bright (he studied molecular biology and aerospace engineering at M.I.T. before getting an M.D. at Harvard) and well informed. Moreover, he&apos;s not the kind of optimist who will merely see the glass as half full. He&apos;ll give you dozens of reasons, some highly technical, why it&apos;s half full. Then he&apos;ll explain that your cognitive biases are tricking you into seeing the glass of water in a negative light, and cart out the research of acclaimed psychologists like Daniel Kahne¬≠man to prove his point. Finally he may suggest you stop fretting: new technologies will soon fill the glass up anyway. Indeed, they are likely to overfill it.

. . .


(p. 19) Throughout the book Diamandis . . . offers small groups of driven entrepreneurs as a kind of Leatherman solution to the world&apos;s problems. It&apos;s true that plenty of insurgents are doing impressive things out there -- Elon Musk&apos;s Tesla Motors, which helped jump-start the world&apos;s electric car industry, is a good example.


. . .


. . . , there&apos;s a significant idea embedded within &quot;Abundance&quot;: We should remain aware, as writers like Jared Diamond have likewise told us, that societies can choose their own future, and thus their own fate. In that spirit Diamandis and Kotler put forth a range of possible goals we may achieve if we have the imagination and the will. A little optimism wouldn&apos;t hurt, either.

 Behavioral Economics Does Not Undermine Capitalism 
 


 












Source of book image: http://www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/thinkingfastandslow.jpg 







Daniel Kahneman first gained fame in economics through research with Tversky in which they showed that some of economists&apos; assumptions about human rationality do not always hold true.

Kahneman, whose discipline is psychology, went on to win the Nobel Prize in economics, sharing the prize with Vernon Smith. (Since the Prize is not normally awarded posthumously, Tversky was not a candidate.)

I have always thought that ultimately there should be only one unified science of human behavior---not claims that are &quot;true&quot; in economics and other claims that are &quot;true&quot; in psychology. (I even thought of minoring in psychology in college, before I realized that the price of minoring included taking time-intensive lab courses where you watched rats run through mazes.)

But I don&apos;t think the implications of current work in behavioral economics are as clear as has often been asserted.

Some important results in economics do not depend on strong claims of rationality. For instance, the most important &quot;law&quot; in economics is the law of demand, and that law is due to human constraints more than to human rationality. Gary Becker, early in his career, wrote an interesting paper in which he showed that the law of demand could also be derived from habitual and random behavior. (I remember in conversation, George Stigler saying that he did not like this paper by Becker, because it did not hone closely to the rationality assumption that Stigler and Becker defended in their &quot;De Gustibus&quot; article.)

The latest book by Kahneman is rich and stimulating. It mainly consists of cataloging the names of, and evidence for, a host of biases and errors that humans make in thinking. But that does not mean we cannot choose to be more rational when it matters. Kahneman believes that there is a conscious System 2 that can over-ride the unconscious System 1. In fact, part of his motive for cataloging bias and irrationality is precisely so that we can be aware, and over-ride when it matters.

Sometimes it is claimed, as for instance in a Nova episode on PBS, that bias and irrationality were the main reasons for the financial crisis of 2008. I believe the more important causes were policy mistakes, like Clinton and Congress pressuring Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to make home loans to those who did not have the resources to repay them; and past government bailouts encouraging finance firms to take greater risks. And the length and depth of the crisis were increased by government stimulus and bailout programs. If instead, long-term cuts had been made in taxes, entrepreneurs would have had more of the resources they need to create start-ups that would have stimulated growth and reduced unemployment.

More broadly, aspects of behavioral economics mentioned, but not emphasized, by Kahneman, can actually strengthen the underpinnings for the case in favor of entrepreneurial capitalism. Entrepreneurs may be more successful when they are allowed to make use of informal knowledge that would not be classified as &quot;rational&quot; in the usual sense. (I discuss this some in my forthcoming paper, &quot;The Epistemology of Entrepreneurship.&quot; )

Still, there are some useful and important examples and discussions in Kahneman&apos;s book. In the next several weeks, I will be quoting some of these.

 A Renting Labor Force Is More Dynamically Mobil 
 


 









Source of graph: online version of the WSJ article quoted and cited below.







 (p. C2) The U.S. economy needs the dynamism that renting enables as much as--if not more than--it needs the stability that ownership engenders. In the current economy, there are vast gulfs between the employment pictures in different regions and states, from 12% unemployment in Nevada to 3% unemployment in North Dakota. But a steelworker in Buffalo, or an underemployed construction worker in Las Vegas, can&apos;t easily take his skills to where they are needed in North Dakota or Wyoming if he&apos;s underwater on his mortgage. Economists, in fact, have found that there is frequently a correlation between persistently high local unemployment rates and high levels of homeownership.

 &quot;Under a Mountain in Omaha&quot; 
 


 (p. 170) lnformatics had been run from the top down. Here&apos;s a story typical of the way the company worked. They had a trainer at headquarters who was told to educate the troops at the Federal Systems Division in northern California, which was run by Geno Tolari, a tough-minded football player from Pittsburgh. When the trainer arrived and announced, &quot;I&apos;m here to train your people,&quot; Geno shot back, &quot;You can&apos;t train my people.&quot;

The trainer got haughty. After all, he was from headquarters. &quot;I&apos;m the education department. I train your people.&quot;

But Geno insisted, &quot;You can&apos;t train my people because you don&apos;t know what they do.&quot;

So now the trainer asked, &quot;Okay, what do they do?&quot;

Geno answered, &quot;I don&apos;t know.&quot;

The trainer thought Geno was joking with him, and insisted, &quot;I&apos;m the trainer; I need to know what they do.&quot;

That&apos;s when Geno confessed, &quot;I can&apos;t tell you because I don&apos;t (p. 171) know. They&apos;re under a mountain in Omaha, and it&apos;s a military secret, and the Air Force won&apos;t tell us what they do.&quot;

 Obama&apos;s World Bank President Opposes Growth, Profits and Globalization 
 


President Obama&apos;s pick for World Bank President, Dr. Jim Yong Kim, is scheduled to take office on July 1, 2012.




 (p. A8) Dr. Kim has drawn fire recently for comments in a book he co-edited in 2000, &quot;Dying for Growth.&quot; In a piece he co-authored for it, Dr. Kim co-wrote that &quot;the quest for growth in GDP and corporate profits has in fact worsened the lives of millions of women and men.&quot;

. . .


. . . an economist who has become one of Dr. Kim&apos;s leading critics, New York University&apos;s William Easterly, said the World Bank nominee offered an &quot;amateur&quot; approach to economics through an &quot;antiglobalization point of view&quot; that is critical of corporations.

&quot;His critique was much more radical, that the system itself was responsible for creating poverty,&quot; Mr. Easterly said.

 If Milken&apos;s Bonds Are &quot;Junk&quot; then Yunis&apos; Microloans Are &quot;Junk&quot; Too 
 


 (p. 167) The world owes a debt of gratitude to Mike Milken and his creative team. Did some people go too far? Yes. Did some of them take advantage of the freer flow of capital and end up doing more damage than good? Sure. But markets are messy. Major shifts in the flow of capital often lead to periods of excess before the pendulum swings back and equilibrium is restored. Mike Milken and his team made a major contribution to today&apos;s market atmosphere of high liquidity, which in turn has also helped lift the world&apos;s poor out of poverty. Today the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh has created microloans for mothers living on $2 a day. And that won Grameen the Nobel Prize. The Nobel Committee didn&apos;t call microloans &quot;junk&quot; debt.

 Happiness Research Undermines European-Style Labor-Market Regulation 
 


Bryan Caplan persuasively pans the book he is revieiwng. But along the way Caplan makes an intriguing observation of his own:




 (p. A11) . . . , happiness research makes a powerful case against European-style labor-market regulation. For most economists, the effect on worker well-being is unclear. On the one hand, regulation boosts wages; on the other, it increases the probability that you will have no wages at all. From the standpoint of a happiness researcher, however, this is a no-brainer. A small increase in wages has but a small and ephemeral effect on happiness. A small increase in unemployment, by contrast, has a massive and--unlike most other factors--durable effect on happiness. Supposedly &quot;humane&quot; regulations to boost workers&apos; incomes have a dire cost in terms of human happiness.

 Michael Milken Provided &quot;Access to Capital for Growing Companies&quot; 
 


 (p. 163) Although [high yield] . . . bonds eventually became known as a favored tool for leveraged--buyout specialists in the 1980s, Mike&apos;s original goal was different. He wanted to provide access to capital for growing companies that needed financing to expand and create jobs. Most of these companies lacked the investment grade&quot; bond ratings required before the big financial institutions would back them. Mike knew that non-investment-grade (a k a &quot;junk&quot;) companies create virtually all new jobs, and he believed that helping these companies grow strengthened the American economy and created good jobs for American workers.

It was by studying credit history at Berkeley in the 1960s that Mike developed his first great insight. He found that while there could be significant risk in any one high-yield bond, a carefully constructed portfolio of these assets produced a consistently better return over the long run than supposedly &quot;safe&quot; investment-grade debt. This was proved during the two decades of the 1970s and &apos;80s when returns on high-yield bonds topped all other asset classes. Mike saw a great opportunity when he realized that the perception of default risk far exceeded the reality. In fact, these bonds had a surprisingly low-risk profile when adjusted for the potential returns.

After twenty years of superior gains, the high-yield bond market finally fell in 1990. Actually, it didn&apos;t fall--it was pushed by unwise government regulation that forced institutions to sell their bonds. The dip only lasted a year, however, with the market roaring back 46 percent in 1991.

Mike&apos;s competitors--Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Credit Suisse First Boston, the old oligopolies of the syndication (p. 164) business--labeled them &quot;junk bonds&quot; to disparage Mike&apos;s brainchild. He was not a member of their white-shoe club and they were not going to take his act lying down.

 In Antitrust, as in Medicine, First Do No Harm 
 


 (p. 94) Western Union&apos;s lawyers carne up with a dusty old New York Stale law, dated 1905, that said no one could buy more than 10 percent of a telegraph company chartered in that state without the approval of Albany lawmakers. Hard to believe, but it was right there in black and white and there was no possibility of getting the New York State legislature to understand why it was vital to build digital highways.

Talk about unintended consequences!

(p. 95) Originally, the law was written to stop Western Union from monopolizing the telegram business, but the law backfired and was used by the monopolist for its own protection.

 &quot;Innovation&quot; Should Be Reserved for Electricity, Printing Press, Telephone and iPhone 
 


 Source of graphic: online version of the WSJ article quoted and cited below.




 (p. B1) &quot;Most companies say they&apos;re innovative in the hope they can somehow con investors into thinking there is growth when there isn&apos;t,&quot; says Clayton Christensen, a professor at Harvard Business School and the author of the 1997 book, &quot;The Innovator&apos;s Dilemma.&quot;

. . .


Scott Berkun, the author of the 2007 book &quot;The Myths of Innovation,&quot; which warns about the dilution of the word, says that what most people call an innovation is usually just a &quot;very good product.&quot;

He prefers to reserve the word for civilization-changing inventions like electricity, the printing press and the telephone--and, more recently, perhaps the iPhone.


. . .


Mr. Berkun tracks innovation&apos;s popularity as a buzzword back to the 1990s, amid the dot-com bubble and the release of James M. Utterback&apos;s &quot;Mastering the Dynamics of Innovation&quot; and Mr. Christensen&apos;s &quot;Dilemma.&quot;


. . .


(p. B8) Mr. Christensen classifies innovations into three types: efficiency innovations, which produce the same product more cheaply, such as automating credit checks; sustaining innovations, which turn good products into better ones, such as the hybrid car; and disruptive innovations, which transform expensive, complex products into affordable, simple ones, such as the shift from mainframe to personal computers.

A company&apos;s biggest potential for growth lies in disruptive innovation, he says, noting that the other types could just as well be called ordinary progress and normally don&apos;t create more jobs or business.

But the disruptive innovations can take five to eight years to bear fruit, he says, so companies lose patience.

It is far easier, he adds, for companies to just say they&apos;re innovating. &quot;Everybody&apos;s innovating, because any change is innovation.&quot;

 Wise and Wyly Words on Air Conditioning 
 


 (p. 42) It was February 1958. I got myself a room, not far from the office, in a little house built in the 1920s owned by a seventy-five-year-old woman named Mrs. Thompson. I lived in her &quot;in-law&apos;s room,&quot; which meant I had my own front door, but I had to share the bathroom with her and, because I did not have a kitchen, I had to eat out. My rent was $10 a week.

I had my car, which meant I could get around, and the training school was air-conditioned, which meant my second summer in Dallas was a lot more pleasant than my first.

Thank you, Willis Haviland Carrier, for inventing air-conditioning. I owe you one. And I&apos;m not the only one. At the height of the dot-com stock market bubble of 1999, Barton Biggs--the wise, graying investments guru at Morgan Stanley--posed this question to seventy-one people: which invention is more important, the Internet or air-conditioning? Barton was on the losing side of the vote, 70-2.

Obviously, he&apos;d found seventy people who&apos;d never spent an August in Texas.

 First Principle for Trustbusters Should Be &quot;Do No Harm&quot; 
 


 (p. A2) In essence, Justice says that, beginning in 2008, several plankton, in the form of five publishers, conspired against a whale, Amazon, whose monopoly clout had imposed a $9.99 retail price for e-books.

The deal the publishers eventually reached with Apple unfixed the price of e-books by linking their prices to the cover price of the print version. More importantly, publishers could begin to reclaim the right to set e-book retail prices generally.


. . .


Apple, with 15% of the e-book market, is no monopolist. The five publishers, though Justice insists they dominate trade publishing, account for only about half of e-book sales. Crucially for antitrust, the barriers to entry are zilch: Amazon, with 60% market share, could create its own e-book imprint tomorrow and begin bidding for the most popular authors.


. . .


Let&apos;s go back to &quot;per se&quot; vs. &quot;rule of reason.&quot; Because the 1890 Sherman Act is so sweeping and almost any business arrangement could be read as prohibited, courts understandably evolved a &quot;rule of reason&quot; to distinguish the permissible from the impermissible. Unfortunately, the result has been antitrust as we know it: wild and fluctuating discretion masquerading as law. Retail price maintenance alone has been embraced and dumped so many times by the courts that it must feel like Jennifer Aniston.

&quot;Do no harm&quot; would be a better principle for trustbusters.

 Entrepreneur Krupp Was Paternalistically &quot;Benevolent&quot; and Was Skeptical of Capitalism 
 


 











Source of book image: online version of the WSJ review quoted and cited below.









 (p. A13) Harold James, professor of history and international affairs at Princeton University, portrays a vastly different organization in &quot;Krupp,&quot; a painstaking chronicle of a company that traces its roots to a steel foundry in Essen in 1810. Mr. James&apos;s Krupp is a company for which the manufacturing of war mat√©riel was always of secondary interest to that of civilian production. The company might have preferred to concentrate on manufacturing railroad equipment and consumer goods, but in the developing and expansionist German empire of the 19th century, state requirements for the tools of power dovetailed with Krupp&apos;s desire for regular long-term contracts. The result for Krupp was a practical, if not deliberate, focus on armaments.


From the manufacturer&apos;s perspective, the emphasis on war mat√©riel did not consign Krupp to the ranks of belligerent militarists; it was just smart business. &quot;The purpose of work should be the common good,&quot; founder Alfred Krupp once said, or at least that quote graces a statue the company erected after his death in 1887. All through the 19th century, Mr. James says, the pursuit of profit was less central to the Krupp mission than building a solid enterprise within a framework of social responsibility. As early as 1836, Krupp established a voluntary health-insurance program for its workers. By the middle of the century, life-insurance and pension plans had been instituted. Workers&apos; hostels and company hospitals were constructed. In exchange for this paternalistic benevolence, Krupp expected complete loyalty from its work force and vehemently opposed the slightest hint of union organization or political activity among its employees.

&quot;Alfred Krupp perfectly fits the mold of the heroic entrepreneur,&quot; Mr. James writes. &quot;Profoundly skeptical of joint-stock companies, banks, and capitalism in general, but also of big-scale science and modern research methods, he was a genius at extending to its utmost limits the possibilities of the craft entrepreneur.&quot;

 Texas Was a Place Where It Was OK for an Entrepreneur to Be Poco Loco 
 


 (p. 42) Today, everybody knows something about Texas, but in those days Texas was still like an undiscovered oasis of freethinking, individualistic, action-oriented, business-minded people. It was a place where gut American characteristics were concentrated and magnified. A place where you could taste the frontier spirit that is part of our national heritage. There was a feeling in the air that you could invent yourself as any character you chose, and that your neighbors would leave you alone to be whoever you wanted to be. I liked the aggressiveness of the people in pursuing their goals, and the fact that you could be poco loco , as Spanish speakers say: a little crazy. This quality is a big help when you&apos;re an entrepreneur. I felt that, in Dallas. there was extra oxygen in the air.

 Quick Computing If Air Conditioning Worked 
 


 (p. 36) Using those IBM 650s was no easy feat. You had to take your turn in line with the other students, write your program, key punch it onto a big stack of cards, do your proofs to make sure it was accurate, and feed it into the computer. If you were lucky and the air-conditioning did not malfunction, you&apos;d get your results back quickly. But there would be errors, which you had to correct, and then you had to repeat the process over and over again until the 650--working on the data with the program that you wrote--came up with the right answers.

 &quot;Birdseye Coaxes Readers to Re-examine Everyday Miracles&quot; 
 


 

















Source of book image: http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2012/05/04/10/50/13z9ot.Em.56.jpg 




 (p. C7) Birdseye made and lost money, went west to search for the cause of Rocky Mountain spotted fever and hunted fox for furs in Labrador, where he took his wife and infant son to live 250 miles by dogsled from the nearest hospital. He harpooned whales near his home in Gloucester, Mass., and wore a necktie while doing it. And he designed the industrial processes that made it possible to fast-freeze food, thus rendering obsolete much canned, dried, salted and smoked food and the musty basement bins that once held a winter&apos;s diet of turnips, onions and potatoes.


Food had been frozen earlier but more slowly. Crystallization turned it mushy and tasteless. It was poor man&apos;s food. In Labrador, fishing with the Inuit, Birdseye noticed that when a fish was pulled from a hole in the ice and into minus-40-degree air, it froze instantly, staying so fresh that when it was thawed months later, it would sometimes come alive.

He spent years putting together modern mass production with what he had seen in Labrador. By the 1920s, he was fast-freezing food that was far closer to fresh than any competition. &quot;Today&apos;s locavore movement--the movement to shun food from afar and eat what is produced locally . . . would have perplexed him,&quot; Mr. Kurlansky writes. After all, &quot;consumers could go to a supermarket and buy the food of California, France and China for less money.&quot;


. . .


The author makes a telling point about locavores: &quot;We need to grasp that people who are accustomed only to artisanal goods long for the industrial. It is only when the usual product is industrial that the artisanal is longed for. This is why artisanal food, the dream of the food of family farms, caught on so powerfully in California, one of the early strongholds of agribusiness with little tradition of small family farms.&quot;

Birdseye&apos;s heroism has been forgotten, and his frozen food is taken for granted, the way all inventions are taken sooner or later. He sold his business for $23.5 million in 1929 to what would become General Foods. He stayed on as a consultant and also ran his light bulb company, which he would sell too. 



For the full review, see:

 HENRY ALLEN. &quot;The American Way of Eating; Harlan Sanders and Clarence Birdseye, just like today&apos;s locavores, saw a meal as a way to improve people&apos;s lives.&quot; The Wall Street Journal (Sat., May 5, 2012): C5&amp;C7. 

(Note: ellipsis added.)

(Note: the online version of the review is dated May 4, 2012.)





 (p. C6) &quot;Birdseye&quot; is a slight but intriguing book that raises far more questions than it answers. But it indeed coaxes readers to re-examine everyday miracles like frozen food, and to imagine where places with no indigenous produce would be without them. It emphasizes the many steps that went into developing such a simple-seeming process.

 A &quot;Boring&quot; and &quot;Excellent&quot; Business Education 
 


 (p. 34) Most of what they taught us in those days was functional. This was before they added &quot;entrepreneurship&quot; to business courses. It was all about manufacturing, marketing, and personnel. I found that somewhat boring. I had two favorite courses. The first was Small Business. It was the only course where all the pieces carne together. The other was Computing, which was the first computer course that the Michigan Business School had ever taught. I had a feeling that this was the big new thing. But, more important, it was what IBM did. I had never seen a computer lab before. This was soon after Remington Rand made headlines with its UNIVAC I, the world&apos;s first commercial computer.


. . .


(p. 59) The University of Michigan is an excellent school. I loved being there and I am proud to have earned an MBA. When I was there, I noticed that the f√¨ve-and--ten-cents-store founder, Sebastian S. Kresge--the man who invented the Kmart chain--had given them Kresge Hall. When I could afford to, I figured, why not do the same? I have always been so grateful for what I learned there. In 1997 I gave the school funding for a Sam Wyly Hall. (A few years earlier, Charles and I had helped to build Louisiana Tech&apos;s 16-story Wyly Tower of Learning.) It&apos;s fulfilling to me that today Paton Scholars study at Sam Wyly Hall on the Ann Arbor campus.

 Some Tasks Are Done Better in Private Offices 
 


 
















Source of book image: http://timeopinions.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/quiet-final-jacket.jpg




 (p. 4) When the R.C. Hedreen Company, a real estate development firm based in Seattle, commissioned a renovation of a 10,800-square-foot floor in an old downtown office building five years ago, it specified a perimeter of private offices. Collaborative spaces are provided for creative teamwork, but the traditional offices remain the executives&apos; home ports.


&apos;&apos;Individually, a lot of our workday is taken up with tasks that are better served by working alone in private offices,&apos;&apos; says David Thyer, Hedreen&apos;s president.

Susan Cain, author of &apos;&apos;Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can&apos;t Stop Talking,&apos;&apos; is skeptical of open-office environments -- for introverts and extroverts alike, though she says the first group suffers much more amid noise and bustle.

Introverts are naturally more comfortable toiling alone, she says, so they will cope by negotiating time to work at home, or by isolating themselves with noise-canceling headphones -- &apos;&apos;which is kind of an insane requirement for an office environment, when you think about it,&apos;&apos; she says.

Ms. Cain also says humans have a fundamental need to claim and personalize space. &apos;&apos;It&apos;s the room of one&apos;s own,&apos;&apos; she says. &apos;&apos;Your photographs are on the wall. It&apos;s the same reason we have houses. These are emotional safety zones.&apos;&apos;

 Entrepreneur Sam Wyly Hard to Classify 
 


 











Source of book image: http://www.charlesandsamwyly.com/images/1000-dollars-and-an-idea.jpg 





I sometimes divide entrepreneurs into two broad types: free agent entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs. Free agent entrepreneurs are the self-employed. Innovative entrepreneurs are the agents of Schumpeter&apos;s process of creative destruction.

Then there are entrepreneurs like Sam Wyly who don&apos;t fit very well in either category.

He built or improved businesses in ways that made the world better, but usually did not involve breakthrough innovations.

Like many of the entrepeneurs considered in Amar Bhid√©&apos;s main books, Wyly grew businesses that served consumers, enriched investors and created jobs. Some of his most important start-ups, especially early-on, involved computer services. And his efforts to compete with the government-backed AT&amp;T;monopoly, were heroic.

I read the 2008 version of his autobiography a few months ago, and found that it contained a few stories and observations that are worth pondering. In the next few weeks I will briefly quote a few of these.




The 2008 Wyly autobiography is:

Wyly, Sam. 1,000 Dollars and an Idea: Entrepreneur to Billionaire . New York: Newmarket Press, 2008.




I have not read the 2011 version of Wyly&apos;s autobiography:

Wyly, Sam. Beyond Tallulah: How Sam Wyly Became America&apos;s Boldest Big-Time Entrepreneur . New York: Melcher Media, 2011.




The dominant examples in Bhid√©&apos;s two main books are entrepreneurs like Wyly. The two main Bhid√© books are:

 Steve Jobs Channels Ellis Wyatt 
 


 (p. 260) In 2007 Forbes magazine named Steve Jobs the highest-paid exec-(p. 261)utive of any of America&apos;s five hundred largest companies, based on gains in the value of stock granted to him at Apple. He was on the board of directors of the Walt Disney Co. Yet his former residence in Woodside, where he had once met with Catmull and Smith and mused about buying Lucasfilm&apos;s Computer Division, was now in a state of decay under his ownership.

He had wanted to demolish it; after a group of neighborhood residents opposed his plan to do so, he left the house open to the elements. The interior suffered damage from water and mold. Vines crept up the stucco walls and wandered inside.

The memories that haunted its hallways were those of Jobs&apos;s darkest times. He had bought the house only months before the humiliation of his firing from Apple; he lived in it through that firing and through the hard, money-hemorrhaging years of Pixar and NeXT. He left it as his fortunes were about to change, as he was sending Microsoft away from Pixar, convinced that he had something he should hold on to.

When a judge ruled against his quest for a demolition permit, Jobs appealed in 2006 and 2007 all the way to the California Supreme Court, but he lost at every stage. He received proposals from property owners offering to cart the house away in sections and restore it elsewhere; he rejected them. One way or another, it seemed, he meant for the house to be destroyed.

 &quot;There Was Never a Plan . . . Just a Series of Mistakes&quot; 
 


 &quot;Robert Caro in his Manhattan office. The later volumes of his L.B.J. biography have taken more years to write than it took the former president to live them.&quot; Source of caption and photo: online version of the NYT article quoted and cited below.



 (p. 37) &quot;There was never a plan,&quot; Caro said to me, explaining how he had become a historian and biographer. &quot;There was just a series of mistakes.&quot;

. . .


(p. 38) Caro had a[n] . . . epiphany about power in the early &apos;60s. He had moved on to Newsday by then, where he discovered that he had a knack for investigative reporting, and was assigned to look into a plan by Robert Moses to build a bridge from Rye, N.Y., across Long Island Sound to Oyster Bay. &quot;This was the world&apos;s worst idea,&quot; he told me. &quot;The piers would have had to be so big that they&apos;d disrupt the tides.&quot; Caro wrote a series exposing the folly of this scheme, and it seemed to have persuaded just about everyone, including the governor, Nelson Rockefeller. But then, he recalled, he got a call from a friend in Albany saying, &quot;Bob, I think you need to come up here.&quot; Caro said: &quot;I got there in time for a vote in the Assembly authorizing some preliminary step toward the bridge, and it passed by something like 138-4. That was one of the transformational moments of my life. I got in the car and drove home to Long Island, and I kept thinking to myself: &apos;Everything you&apos;ve been doing is baloney. You&apos;ve been writing under the belief that power in a democracy comes from the ballot box. But here&apos;s a guy who has never been elected to anything, who has enough power to turn the entire state around, and you don&apos;t have the slightest idea how he got it.&apos; &quot;

The lesson was repeated in 1965, when Caro had a Nieman fellowship at Harvard and took a class in land use and urban planning. &quot;They were talking one day about highways and where they got built,&quot; he recalled, &quot;and here were these mathematical formulas about traffic density and population density and so on, and all of a sudden I said to myself: &apos;This is completely wrong. This isn&apos;t why highways get built. Highways get built because Robert Moses wants them built there. If you don&apos;t find out and explain to people where Robert Moses gets his power, then everything else you do is going to be dishonest.&apos; &quot;

 Physicist Says &quot;Financial Models Are Only Mediocre Metaphors&quot; 
 


 











Source of book image: online version of the WSJ review quoted and cited below.









 (p. A19) Trained as a physicist, Emanuel Derman once served as the head of quantitative analysis at Goldman Sachs and is currently a professor of industrial engineering and operations research at Columbia University. With &quot;Models Behaving Badly&quot; he offers a readable, even eloquent combination of personal history, philosophical musing and honest confession concerning the dangers of relying on numerical models not only on Wall Street but also in life.


Mr. Derman&apos;s particular thesis can be stated simply: Although financial models employ the mathematics and style of physics, they are fundamentally different from the models that science produces. Physical models can provide an accurate description of reality. Financial models, despite their mathematical sophistication, can at best provide a vast oversimplification of reality. In the universe of finance, the behavior of individuals determines value--and, as he says, &quot;people change their minds.&quot;

In short, beware of physics envy. When we make models involving human beings, Mr. Derman notes, &quot;we are trying to force the ugly stepsister&apos;s foot into Cinderella&apos;s pretty glass slipper. It doesn&apos;t fit without cutting off some of the essential parts.&quot; As the collapse of the subprime collateralized debt market in 2008 made clear, it is a terrible mistake to put too much faith in models purporting to value financial instruments. &quot;In crises,&quot; Mr. Derman writes, &quot;the behavior of people changes and normal models fail. While quantum electrodynamics is a genuine theory of all reality, financial models are only mediocre metaphors for a part of it.&quot;

 &quot;In a Garage Pursuing a Dream&quot; 
 


 (p. 257) The increase in computer-animated films . . . marked the dawning of a democratic moment in artistic expression and entrepreneurship. Just as technological developments in digital production were (p. 258) opening the door more widely in live-action filmmaking, technology was making computer animation more accessible every year.

Computer animation was still an art form that required talent and intense Commitment; it wasn&apos;t within reach of Everyman. The accessibility of its tools, however, brought new possibilities. Where Pixar&apos;s early years had required a succession of wealthy patrons--Alexander Schure, George Lucas, and Steve Jobs--an enterprising artist of the early twenty-first century was not so dependent. The hardware and software of an animator&apos;s workstation, once the province of major studios and effects houses, could now be had for the cost of a good used car. As Pixar started its new life as a crown jewel of the Walt Disney Co., it was plausible that it would sooner or later have to jockey release dates with a new kind of rival. Or, rather, it would have to face a rival that looked much the way Pixar itself did thirty years earlier, as a group of men and women in a garage pursuing a dream.

 NGO Workers Are More Concerned with Following Plan than Achieving Mission 
 


 













Source of book image: http://www.bibliovault.org/thumbs/978-0-8047-7672-1-frontcover.jpg 








In the quote below, &quot;NGO&quot; means &quot;Non-Government Organization,&quot; for instance, a philanthropy.



 (p. 17) As for the state&apos;s representatives, their authority was what Coburn calls a &quot;useful fiction.&quot; The district governor wielded his connections to Kabul as best he could, but did not possess great influence, in part because -- in keeping with the most sophisticated state-building methods -- government aid was mainly distributed by locally elected committees. Istalif&apos;s police were seen as hapless at best, predatory at worst; Coburn found that villagers were eager to protect him from a local officer. The French soldiers who periodically showed up in the bazaar had little impact, though their presence did become an excuse for keeping women out of the area. But Coburn observed that &quot;no group was less effective at accumulating influence&quot; than the NGO community. The best development experts accomplished little: their turnover was high, and they frequently bestowed their largess on deserving locals -- women, refugees who&apos;d returned from abroad with some education, victims of wartime injuries -- who didn&apos;t have the connections or ability to capitalize on their good fortune. NGO workers seemed less concerned with achieving a valuable outcome than with demonstrating to their backers that they had followed a mission plan to the letter.

 Intellectual Property Rights as Refined in Case Law 
 


The questions and answers in court illustrate how case law would approach the issue of refining and reforming intellectual property issues based on concepts of justice, but also on practical issues. (This is from Disney and Pixar lawyer Steve Marenberg questioning Dick Cook in testimony before Judge Clarence Brimmer, Jr. on November 1, 2001, the day before Monsters, Inc. was scheduled to be released.)




 (p. 193) Q : So obviously the delay of the film by injunction or otherwise would affect the first weekend and the ability to gain all of the benefits you&apos;ve gotten by virtue of the tact that November second is the first weekend?


A : It would be a disaster.

Q : And that would affect, then, not only the theatrical performance of the film, but what other markets in the United Sates?

A : Well, it would completely be a snowball effect in a reverse way in that it would certainly put a damper on all of the home video activities, all the DVD activities; in fact, would influence international because international is greatly influenced on how well it does in the United States, and by taking that away, it would definitely, definitely, have a big, big impact on the success of the film.

And furthermore, going further, is that it would take away any of the other ancillary things that happen, you (p. 194) know, whether it would become a television series, whether or not it becomes a piece of an attraction at the parks, whether it becomes a land at the parks, or any of those kinds of things.

 Workers Want to See Compensation Related to Contribution 
 


This is a great example contra (or at least qualifying) Daniel Pink&apos;s claim that all you need do for knowledge workers is provide them enough money so that they can provide for the basic needs of themselves and their family.




 (p. 145) The public offering process brought details of the intended allocation of Pixar stock options into view. A registration statement and other documents with financial data had to be prepared for the Securities and Exchange Commission and a prospectus needed to be made ready for potential investors. These documents had to be reviewed and edited, and it was here that the word apparently leaked: A small number of people were to receive low-cost options on enormous blocks of stock. Catmull, Levy, and Lasseter were to get options on 1.6 million shares apiece; Guggenheim and Reeves were to get 1 million and 840,000, respectively. If the company&apos;s shares sold at the then-planned price of fourteen dollars, the men would be instant multimillionaires.


The revelation was galling. Apart from the money, there was the symbolism: The options seemed to denigrate the years of work everyone else had put into the company. They gave a hollow feel to Pixar&apos;s labor-of-love camaraderie, its spirit that everyone was there to do cool work together. Also, it was hard not to notice that Levy, one of the top recipients, had just walked in the door.

&quot;There was a big scene about all that because some people got (p. 146) huge amounts more than other people who had come at the same time period and who had made pretty significant contributions to the development of Pixar and the ability to make Toy Story, &quot; Kerwin said. &quot;People like Tom Porter and Eben Ostby and Loren Carpenter--guys that had been there since the beginning and were part of the brain trust.&quot;

Garden-variety employees would also get some options, but besides being far fewer, those options would vest over a four-year period. Even employees who had been with the organization since its Lucasfilm days a decade earlier--employees who had lost all their Pixar stock in the 1991 reorganization--would be starting their vesting clock at zero. In contrast, most of the options of Catmull, Lasseter, Guggenheim, and Reeves vested immediately--they could be turned into stock right away.

&quot;I decided, &apos;Well, gee, I&apos;ve been at this company eight years, and I&apos;ll have been here twelve years before I&apos;m fully vested,&apos; &quot; one former employee remembered. &quot; &apos;It doesn&apos;t sound like these guys are interested in my well-being.&apos; A lot of this piled up and made me say, &apos;What am I doing? I&apos;m sitting around here trying to make Steve Jobs richer in ways he doesn&apos;t even appreciate.&apos; &quot;

 &quot;Dematerialization&quot; Means More Goods from Fewer Resources 
 


 (p. C4) Economic growth is a form of deflation. If the cost of, say, computing power goes down, then the users of computing power acquire more of it for less--and thus attain a higher standard of living. One thing that makes such deflation possible is dematerialization, the reduction in the quantity of stuff needed to produce a product. An iPhone, for example, weighs 1/100th and costs 1/10th as much as an Osborne Executive computer did in 1982, but it has 150 times the processing speed and 100,000 times the memory.

Dematerialization is occurring with all sorts of products. Banking has shrunk to a handful of electrons moving on a cellphone, as have maps, encyclopedias, cameras, books, card games, music, records and letters--none of which now need to occupy physical space of their own. And it&apos;s happening to food, too. In recent decades, wheat straw has shrunk as grain production has grown, because breeders have persuaded the plant to devote more of its energy to making the thing that we value most. Future dematerialization includes the possibility of synthetic meat--produced in a lab without brains, legs or guts.

Dematerialization is one of the reasons that Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler give for the future&apos;s being &quot;better than you think&quot; in their new book, &quot;Abundance.&quot;

 &quot;Scratch a White Liberal and You&apos;ll Find a Bigot&quot; 
 


 















Source of book image: http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowldc/files/2011/10/my-long-trip-home.jpg 




 (p. C1) As a social studies major in his junior year at Harvard, Mark Whitaker attended a debate on the subject of ethnicity. One participant was the chairman of the department. Mr. Whitaker stood up to raise some questions.


&quot;What would you tell someone who didn&apos;t have a clear ethnic identity?&quot; he asked. &quot;For example, what would you tell someone who had one parent who was black and another who was white? Who had one parent who was American and another who was European? Who had moved dozens of times as a child and didn&apos;t have a specific place to call home?&quot; Everyone in the room knew that Mr. Whitaker was talking about himself.

&quot;I guess I would say that that&apos;s too bad,&quot; the professor answered. &quot;In the future I hope we don&apos;t have too many more people like you.&quot;

Mr. Whitaker recounts this story in &quot;My Long Trip Home,&quot; a book filled with as much family tumult as Jeannette Walls described in &quot;The Glass Castle&quot; and a racial factor to boot. It&apos;s a story that registers not only for its shock value but also for the perspective and wisdom with which it can now be told.

The episode did not anger him, he said. He saw it as his professor&apos;s Freudian slip, &quot;exposing a wish to hold on to a sense of certainty about his roots in the face of a gathering demographic storm that threatened to wash them away.&quot; But Mr. Whitaker&apos;s troubled and combative black father, who is the book&apos;s central figure through sheer force of personality, had a more heated reaction. &quot;As I always say, scratch a white liberal and you&apos;ll find a bigot,&quot; Cleophaus Sylvester Whitaker Jr. told his son.

 Add to Your List of Marketing Mistakes 
 


 (p. 142) The consumer products arm of Disney--the group responsible for licensing toys and other tie-ins--was also slow to see the potential of Toy Story . It was a case of out of sight, out of mind: Toy Story was in production hundreds of miles away. Preoccupied with two other forthcoming releases, Pocahontas and The Hunchback of Notre Dame , Disney Consumer Products left the Pixar film on the back burner. When Guggenheim met with one of the division&apos;s senior licensing executives in December 1994, he was alarmed to discover that she saw no licensing potential in the film.

&quot;We put together a presentation reel of scenes from the film that we&apos;d already completed, and material on how the film was being made&quot; Guggenheim said. &quot;We were taking that around the company so people could get a feeling of what this film was all about.&quot;

The executive told him, I don&apos;t know how we&apos;re going to do toys for this.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Guggenheim queried. &quot;It&apos;s Toy Story . You know, Toy . . . Story .&quot;

Yes, she said, but you have all these toys that already exist--Mr. Potato Head, Speak&amp;Spell, all that stuff. How are we ever going to make money off that?

&quot;But you have all these original characters. You&apos;ve got Buzz, you&apos;ve got Woody.&quot;

 Mhyrvold Left Work with Hawking for the Excitement of Entrepreneurship 
 


 (p. 139) Microsoft was represented ¬°n the discussion by its senior vice president for advanced technology, a thirty-five-year-old Nathan Myhrvold. After finishing his Ph.D. at Princeton at age twenty-three, Myhrvold had worked for a year as a postdoctoral fellow with the physicist Stephen Hawking at Cambridge, tackling theories of (p. 140) gravitation and curved space-time, before taking a three-month leave of absence to help some friends in the Bay Area with a software project. He became caught up in the excitement of personal computer software and entrepreneurship and never went back. In Berkeley, he co-founded a company called Dynamical Systems to develop operating system for personal computers, which struggled for two years until Microsoft bought it in 1986. At Microsoft, he persuaded Bill Gates to let him establish a corporate research center, Microsoft Research, with Myhrvold himself in charge.

 James Morrison Was a &quot;Retailing Genius&quot; 
 


 











Source of book image: online version of the WSJ review quoted and cited below.









 (p. A13) Morrison was not an inventor-capitalist but a retailing genius, more Sam Walton than Steve Jobs. He catered to England&apos;s growing consumer class by diversifying his wares and, in his ever-growing network of shops, introducing luxurious showrooms. He was a disciple of volume, seeking &quot;high turnover, small profits, and quick returns.&quot; He sent his traveling men not to find buyers, as was typical, but to find the best suppliers. Advantageously purchased in bulk, goods would sell themselves. Morrison&apos;s buyers were specialists, anticipating the practices of later department stores. He kept his finger on the pulse of fashion and on &quot;market making&quot; events. Legendarily, he was never caught short of black crepe when a member of the royal family was ill. &quot;The Duke of York has died most conveniently,&quot; he once quipped while tallying profits.
The &quot;Napoleon of shopkeepers&quot; went on to found his own merchant bank and accumulate a prodigious investment portfolio, much of it in American bonds. Strategic lending to broke aristocrats greased Morrison&apos;s way into Parliament, where he served as a &quot;radical Whig,&quot; championing political reform and free trade.


. . .


. . . Morrison conducted both his retailing and his banking business with impeccable transparency. The investments he sold were honestly structured, and the risks he ran were his own, backed by sufficient collateral. Morrison&apos;s was an era before bailouts, an era of some moral luck but little moral hazard. Markets rose and fell with reasonably predictable effects. For him and many of his contemporaries, credit remained a personal matter of the highest consequence. In this, alas, a character such as Morrison now seems more alien than familiar.

 Lasseter&apos;s Success Came from Seeing How the Details Affected the Storytelling 
 


 (p. 138) &quot;I had no reason to think it would be any good,&quot; recalled Barzel, who was then a recently minted California Institute of Technology Ph.D. on the lighting team. &quot;I knew John was absolutely brilliant as a animator of shorts. But I&apos;ve read authors who write good short stories and crummy novels; I figured it&apos;s a different skill. I had no reason to think John would have the skill to pull off a full-length movie.&quot;

He expected something that animators and animation buffs might find interesting, but that probably would not have a particularly wide audience.

&quot;I joined because I wanted the practical experience,&quot; he said, &quot;I thought, Well, it&apos;s going to be the first full-length [computer-animated] movie, so it&apos;ll be a fun thing to have been associated with, however it turns out.&quot;

What finally made Barzel a believer was watching Lasseter at work. He found that Lasseter had an uncanny ability to shift between the macro level of the entire film and the micro level of whatever detail he was dealing with at the moment. &quot;Looking at an individual frame -- it&apos;s meticulous work-- he would always be aware of its role in the larger context of storytelling,&quot; Barzel recalled. &quot;He&apos;d say something like, &apos;This is the first time this character responds to that situation; it&apos;s really important that he get the right glint in his eye.&apos; &quot; Barzel started to think, John knows what he&apos;s doing. This movie could be really good.

 Lean Start-Ups &quot;Ruthlessly Cull Failures&quot; 
 


 Eric Ries and his book. Source of photo: http://nemonics.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/eric-ries-lean-startup.jpg?w=584&amp;h;=262




 (p. D3) &quot;What&apos;s different in the Valley is that we&apos;ve found a quasi-scientific method for reinventing businesses and industries, not just products,&quot; said Randy Komisar, a partner in a leading venture capital firm, Kleiner Perkins Caufield&amp;Byers, and a lecturer on entrepreneurship at Stanford University. &quot;The approach is much more systematic than it was several years ago.&quot;


The newer model for starting businesses relies on hypothesis, experiment and testing in the marketplace, from the day a company is founded. That is a sharp break with the traditional approach of drawing up a business plan, setting financial targets, building a finished product and then rolling out the business and hoping to succeed. It was time-consuming and costly.

The preferred formula today is often called the &quot;lean start-up.&quot; Its foremost proponents include Eric Ries, an engineer, entrepreneur and author who coined the term and is now an entrepreneur in residence at the Harvard Business School, and Steven Blank, a serial entrepreneur, author and lecturer at Stanford.

The approach emphasizes quickly developing &quot;minimum viable products,&quot; low-cost versions that are shown to customers for reaction, and then improved. Flexibility is the other hallmark. Test business models and ideas, and ruthlessly cull failures and move on to Plan B, Plan C, Plan D and so on -- &quot;pivoting,&quot; as the process is known.

 &quot;Being Able to Work on a Great Project&quot; 
 


 (p. 133) Recruiting was brisk; the magnet for talent was not the pay, generally mediocre, but rather the allure of taking part in the first fully computer-animated feature film. &quot;Disney gave us a very modest budget [$17.5 million] for Toy Story ,&quot; Guggenheim said. &quot;Although that budget went up progressively over time, it didn&apos;t afford for very high salaries, unfortunately. We tried to make the other working conditions better. Just the enthusiasm of being able to work on a great project is as often as not what attracts artists and animators.&quot;

 Faraday and Einstein Were Visual and Physical Thinkers, Not Mathematicians 
 


 













Source of book image: http://www.rsc.org/images/Faraday_Chemical_History-of-a-Candle_180_tcm18-210390.jpg 






 (p. C6) Michael Faraday is one of the most beguiling and lovable figures in the history of science. Though he could not understand a single equation, he deduced the essential structure of the laws of electromagnetism through visualization and physical intuition. (James Clerk Maxwell would later give them mathematical form.) Albert Einstein kept a picture of Faraday over his desk, for Einstein also thought of himself primarily as a visual and physical thinker, not an abstract mathematician.

. . .


Faraday&apos;s text is still charming and rich, a judgment that few popular works on science could sustain after so many years. Though he addresses himself to an &quot;auditory of juveniles,&quot; he calls for his audience to follow a close chain of reasoning presented through a series of experiments and deductions.


. . .


. . . : &quot;In every one of us there is a living process of combustion going on very similar to that of a candle,&quot; as Faraday illustrates in his experiments.

In his closing, he turns from our metabolic resemblance to a candle to his deeper wish that &quot;you may, like it, shine as lights to those about you.&quot;

 In History, Documenting Your Sources Matters More than Your Credentials 
 


 









George Dyson. Source of photo: online version of the NYT interview quoted and cited below.






 (p. D11) BELLINGHAM, Wash. -- More than most of us, the science historian George Dyson spends his days thinking about technologies, old and very new.

. . .


Though this 58-year-old author&apos;s works are centered on technology, they often have an autobiographical subtext. Freeman Dyson, the physicist and mathematician who was a protagonist of Project Orion, is his father. Esther Dyson, the Internet philosopher and high-tech investor, is his sister. We spoke for three hours at his cottage here, and later by telephone. A condensed and edited version of the conversations follows.


. . .


 . . . today you make your living as a historian of science and technology. How does a high school dropout get to do that? 

Hey, this is America. You can do what you want! I love this idea that someone who didn&apos;t finish high school can write books that get taken seriously. History is one of the only fields where contributions by amateurs are taken seriously, providing you follow the rules and document your sources. In history, it&apos;s what you write, not what your credentials are.

 (p. A13) Over the next three decades, Breasted would excavate a series of sites in Egypt, the Sudan and the Near East. He would also develop an important ability to identify rich and influential benefactors and to gain their confidence without resorting to sycophancy. . . . Notable among the Maecenas figures he cultivated was John D. Rockefeller.


Rockefeller had been an early patron of the University of Chicago; he might have done something for Near Eastern studies in any case, but it is clear that without Breasted&apos;s energy and enthusiasm, Rockefeller&apos;s scholarly philanthropy would never have taken the course it did. Eventually, he provided the funding for an entire Oriental Institute in 1931. (The OI, as it is affectionately known, had existed from 1919 but essentially as a concept between academic committees.) Together with its Egyptian offshoot, Chicago House, the OI is perhaps the leading center of Egyptology and Assyriology in the world. At the moment, on both sides of the Atlantic, we are hearing a lot about the evils of bankers and capitalism, but as far as I know no street protester has yet endowed a university department.

 Lasseter&apos;s Epiphany: &quot;This Is What Walt Was Waiting For&quot; 
 


 (p. 52) In a trailer on the Disney lot, Lasseter huddled with Rees and Kroyer to look at the first computer-generated scene to come in--a race among drivers in virtual motorcycles known as light cycles. The scene had no character animation and its graphics were rudimentary, but it brought Lasseter an epiphany. The dimensionality of the scene was something he had never witnessed before. If this technology could be melded with Disney animation, he thought, he would have the makings of a revolution. Until then, three-dimensional effects in animation had required difficult, costly sessions with the multistory &quot;multiplane&quot; camera, practical for only a few key sequences in a film, if that. The computers could even move the audience&apos;s point of view around a scene like a Steadicam. The possibilities seemed infinite.

&quot;I couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing,&quot; he said later. &quot;Walt Disney, all his career, all his life, was striving to get more dimension in his (p. 53) animation . . . and I was standing there, looking at it, going, &apos;This is what Walt was waiting for.&apos;&quot;

He was not able to interest the animation executives in it; they did not care to hear about new technology unless it made animation faster or cheaper.

 &quot;The Astaires&apos; Defiant New World Optimism&quot; 
 


 













Source of book image:
 http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513pEMI-LeL._.jpg 






 (p. C6) The Astaire universe was made of crazy joy, that guiltless worldview unique to the art of the American 1920s. The Astaires&apos; trademarked exit was the gleefully mischievous &quot;runaround,&quot; in which they trotted about the stage in ever increasing circles as if joined at the hip, expanding their geometry till they reached the wings and vanished. It was goofy and expert at once, a way of defining musical comedy as the state of being young, cute and in love with life.

. . .


&quot;For all their jazz-fueled modernity,&quot; Ms. Riley writes of the Astaires&apos; London r√©clame, they were &quot;anti-modernist.&quot; This pair was more than sunshine. The sheer zest with which they frisked through a show ran &quot;counter to High Modernism&apos;s pervasive sense of the instability of the self and the universe.&quot; This was the time, Ms. Riley notes, of &quot;The Waste Land,&quot; &quot;Ulysses,&quot; &quot;Vile Bodies.&quot; Art was in despair. But the Astaires&apos; &quot;defiant New World optimism&quot; proved a remedy: meeting cute, assuming disguises and high-hatting the blues with fascinating rhythm. It&apos;s a very American notion: that a strong foundation in popular art creates a positive worldview in general. Call it the audacity of charm.


. . .


They don&apos;t make shows that way anymore, and Ms. Riley&apos;s book is thus a resuscitation of a naive but perhaps more authentically native showbiz, an art of natural forces. &quot;The Astaires&quot; is a salute to an America at ease with itself and doing something wonderful in the song-and-dance line that seemed, for a time, like the hottest thing in the culture.

 (p. 9) The problem, Murray argues, is not that members of the new upper class eat French cheese or vote for Barack Obama. It is that they have lost the confidence to preach what they practice, adopting instead a creed of &quot;ecumenical niceness.&quot; They work, marry and raise children, but they refuse to insist that the rest of the country do so, too. &quot;The belief that being a good American involved behaving in certain kinds of ways, and that the nation itself relied upon a certain kind of people in order to succeed, had begun to fade and has not revived,&quot; Murray writes.

 (p. A5) BEIJING. EVEN at 106 years old, Zhou Youguang is the kind of creative thinker that Chinese leaders regularly command the government to cultivate in their bid to raise their nation from the world&apos;s factory floor.
So it is curious that he embodies a contradiction at the heart of their premise: the notion that free thinkers are to be venerated unless and until they challenge the legitimacy of the ruling Communist Party.

Mr. Zhou is the inventor of Pinyin, the Romanized spelling system that linked China&apos;s ancient written language to the modern age and helped China all but stamp out illiteracy. He was one of the leaders of the Chinese translation of the Encyclopaedia Britannica in the 1980s. He has written about 40 books, the most recent published last year.


. . .


His blog entries range from the modernization of Confucianism to Silk Road history and China&apos;s new middle class. Computer screens hurt his eyes, but he devours foreign newspapers and magazines. A well-known Chinese artist nicknamed him &quot;Trendy Old Guy.&quot;


. . .


THE decade-long Cultural Revolution that began in 1966 wiped out Mr. Zhou&apos;s lingering belief in communism. He was publicly humiliated and sent to toil for two years in the wilderness.


. . .


About Mao, he said in an interview: &quot;I deny he did any good.&quot; About the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre: &quot;I am sure one day justice will be done.&quot; About popular support for the Communist Party: &quot;The people have no freedom to express themselves, so we cannot know.&quot;

As for fostering creativity in the Communist system, Mr. Zhou had this to say, in a 2010 book of essays: &quot;Inventions are flowers that grow out of the soil of freedom. Innovation and invention don&apos;t grow out of the government&apos;s orders.&quot;

No sooner had the first batch of copies been printed than the book was banned in China.

 &quot;Crises Are an Inevitable Concomitant of Risk&quot; 
 


 (p. 11) Some economic risks are worth taking, and crises are an inevitable concomitant of risk. Crises, like firm failures, can be seen as a manifestation of the Schumpeterian process of creative destruction. The role for economic analysis is to ensure that the creation dominates and that the destruction is not too costly.

 &quot;Amazed by the Short-Term Psychology in the Market&quot; 
 


 (p. A1) Even after European leaders appeared to have averted a chaotic default by Greece with an eleventh-hour deal for aid, worries persist that a debt disaster on the Continent has merely been delayed.



The tortured process that culminated in that latest bailout has exposed the severe limitations of Europe&apos;s approach to the crisis. Many fear that policy makers simply don&apos;t have the right tools to deal with other troubled countries like Italy, Spain, Ireland and Portugal, a situation that could weigh on the markets and the broader economy.

&quot;I don&apos;t want to be a Cassandra, but the idea that it&apos;s over is an illusion,&quot; said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard and co-author of &quot;This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly.&quot; &quot;I am amazed by the short-term psychology in the market.&quot;

 Freedom Grew from the Greek Agora 
 


 











Source of book image: http://images.borders.com.au/images/bau/97801997/9780199747405/0/0/plain/a-culture-of-freedom-ancient-greece-and-the-origins-of-europe.jpg 






 (p. C9) A city&apos;s central space reveals much about the society that built it. In the middle of the typical Greek city-state, or polis, stood neither a palace nor a temple--the dominant centering structures of Asian and Egyptian cities--but an open public square, an agora, useful for gatherings and the conduct of business. When Cyrus the Great, founder of the Achaemenid Persian Empire, first encountered Greeks on his western boundaries, he sneered at the race of shopkeepers who hung about the agora cheating one another all day. Yet that same race would later defeat his descendants, Darius and Xerxes, in two of the most consequential battles the Western world has seen, at Marathon in 490 B.C. and at Salamis 10 years later.

. . .


Mr. Meier&apos;s approach runs counter to a tendency in recent classical scholarship to trace Greek ideas to non-Greek sources or to seek common ground on which East and West once met. The polis itself has been claimed in the past few decades as a Near Eastern, or Phoenician, invention; Carthage too, it seems, had an agora at its hub. But Mr. Meier takes pains to dismiss this claim. Relying on expertise amassed in his long academic career, he reasserts the uniqueness of Greek political evolution, the mysterious and somewhat miraculous process that culminates, at the end of this account, in the emergence of Athenian democracy.


. . .


After surveying the crucial reforms of the Athenian leader Cleisthenes, the foundation stones of the world&apos;s first democratic constitution, Mr. Meier asks: &quot;Was it just a matter of time before the Attic citizenry was reorganized--so that Cleisthenes did something that would have happened sooner or later anyway? Or were Cleisthenes&apos; achievements beyond the scope of men less able and daring?&quot;

 Successful Innovation Depends More on Will than on Intellect 
 


 (p. 9) The odysseys of [Lasseter, Catmull, Smith and Jobs], and of Pixar as a whole, bring to mind the observation of the maverick economist Joseph Schumpeter that successful innovation &quot;is a feat not of intellect, but of will.&quot; Writing about the psychology of entrepreneurs in the early twentieth century, a rime when the subject was unfashionable, he believed few individuals are prepared for &quot;the resistances and uncertainties incident to doing what has not been done before.&quot; Those who braved the risks of failure did so out of noneconomic as well as economic motives, among them &quot;the joy of creating, of getting things done, or simply of exercising one&apos;s energy and ingenuity.&quot; In Pixar&apos;s case, at least, the resistances and uncertainties were abundant--as was the will.

 Carnegie and Twain Opposed Roosevelt&apos;s Imperialism 
 


 










Source of book image: http://www.chinarhyming.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/51Hr-aIgESL._SL500_AA300_.jpg 







Marxists and others on the left often claim that big business is the main force behind U.S. imperialism. Is it not ironic that the most imperialistic U.S. President was the anti-big-business &quot;progressive&quot; Teddy Roosevelt who was vehemently opposed by big businessman Andrew Carnegie?

Mark Twain is sometimes accused of insufficient sympathy with the downtrodden. Those who so accuse, misunderstand his message. He too opposed Roosevelt&apos;s war on the Filipinos.

(Carnegie and Twain&apos;s friendship is discussed in David Nasaw&apos;s biography of Carnegie.)




 (p. 13) There was within the United States a strong and vocal anti-imperialist movement, which included former President Grover Cleveland, Andrew Carnegie and Mark Twain, but it struggled to tamp down the country&apos;s growing expansionist zeal, and to compete with the energy, tenacity and bulldog ambition of one man in particular: Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt, who in just six years rose meteorically from New York City police commissioner to president, nurtured a deep and unshakable contempt for what he called the &quot;unintelligent, cowardly chatter for &apos;peace at any price.&apos; &quot; Not only had the &quot;clamor of the peace faction&quot; left him unmoved, Roosevelt wrote, it had served to strengthen his conviction that &quot;this country needs a war.&quot;

. . .


Although Roosevelt moves in and out of Jones&apos;s narrative, disappearing for long stretches, he still manages to steal the spotlight, just as he does in every book in which he appears. When McKinley dragged his feet before sending troops to Cuba, Roosevelt sneered that the president had &quot;no more backbone than a chocolate √©clair.&quot; In the Department of the Navy, Roosevelt gleefully took over while his boss was on summer vacation, anointing himself the &quot;hot weather secretary&quot; and crowing to a friend that he was having &quot;immense fun running the Navy.&quot; In Cuba, after choosing his regiment of Rough Riders from 23,000 applicants, he ordered his famous charge up Kettle Hill wearing a custom-made fawn-colored Brooks Brothers uniform with canary-yellow trim.

 How Pixar Vision Was Made Real 
 


 (p. 8) . . . Pixar&apos;s story was anything but preordained. It is a triple helix of artistic, technological, and business struggles, and it is a study in the tremendously uncertain and contingent nature of artistic, technological, and business success. It illustrates how professional prestige and social status flow into each other, and how a small organization can magnify its power by deploying them as an economic force. It shows how small things, done well, can lead to big things. It is the story of a small group of individuals who started with a shared ambition to create a new way of telling stories--within a virtual world of mathematical constructions--and who traveled a long and circuitous road until their vision became a reality.

 Manifesto for a Rising Standard of Living 
 


 











Source of book image: online version of the WSJ review quoted and cited below.








 (p. A13) Mr. Diamandis is the chairman and chief executive of the X Prize Foundation and the founder of more than a dozen high-tech companies. With his journalist co-author, he has produced a manifesto for the future that is grounded in practical solutions addressing the world&apos;s most pressing concerns: overpopulation, food, water, energy, education, health care and freedom. The authors suggest that &quot;humanity is now entering a period of radical transformation where technology has the potential to significantly raise the basic standard of living for every man, woman, and child on the planet.&quot;

. . .


Predictions of a rosy future have a way of sounding as unrealistic as end-is-nigh forecasts. But Messrs. Diamandis and Kotler are not just dreamers. They lay out a plausible road map, discussing, among other things, the benefits of do-it-yourself tinkering--like the work by geneticist J. Craig Venter in beating the U.S. government in the race to sequence the human genome--and the growing willingness of techno-philanthropists like Bill Gates to tackle real-world problems.

The biggest hurdles, however, are not scientific or technological but political. There are still too many corrupt dictators and backward-looking governments keeping millions in penury. But as we have seen lately, the misruled have a way of throwing off despotic governments. With ever more people reaching for freedom, countless millions are tacitly embracing the Diamandis motto: &quot;The best way to predict the future is to create it yourself.&quot;

 &quot;The Patience of Jobs&quot; 
 


 (p. 7) Steve Jobs was missing from the scene of the meeting, though he would soon be Disney&apos;s largest individual shareholder (the acquisition was a stock-for-stock trade) and the newest member of Disney&apos;s board. Lasseter was right about his money; Jobs had driven a hard bargain in buying Lucas&apos;s Computer Division for five million dollars (not ten million, as is sometimes reported), but as it turned out, he put ten times that amount into the company over the course of a decade to keep it afloat. Few other investors would have had the patience of Jobs.

 Nasar Gives Compelling Portrait of Joseph Schumpeter and His Vienna 
 


 














Source of book image: http://luxuryreading.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/grand-pursuit.jpg 






 (p. C31) Ms. Nasar gives us Belle √âpoque Vienna -- infatuated with modernity and challenging London in the race to electrify with new telephone service, state-of-the-art factories and power-driven trams -- and then a devastating picture of Vienna at the end of World War I: war veterans loitering outside restaurants waiting for scraps, and desperate members of a middle class that saw inflation wipe out all its savings trading a piano for a sack of flour, a gold watch chain for a few sacks of potatoes.

. . .


Among the more compelling portraits in this volume is that of Joseph Alois Schumpeter, the brilliant European economist who argued that the distinctive feature of capitalism was &quot;incessant innovation&quot; -- a &quot;perennial gale of creative destruction&quot; -- and who identified the entrepreneur as the visionary who could &quot;revolutionize the pattern of production by exploiting an invention&quot; or &quot;an untried technological possibility.&quot;

 &quot;What Success Had Brought Him, . . . , Was Freedom&quot; 
 


 (p. 5) The success of Pixar&apos;s films had brought him something exceedingly rare in Hollywood: not the house with the obligatory pool in the backyard and the Oscar statuettes on the fireplace mantel, or the country estate, or the vintage Jaguar roadster--although he had all of those things, too. It wasn&apos;t that he could afford to indulge his affinity for model railroads by acquiring a full-size 1901 steam locomotive, with plans to run it on the future site of his twenty-thousand-square-foot mansion in Sonoma Valley wine country. (Even Walt D√¨sney&apos;s backyard train had been a mere one-eighth-scale replica.)

None of these was the truly important fruit of Lasseter&apos;s achievements. What success had brought him, most meaningfully, was freedom. Having created a new genre of film with his colleagues at Pixar, he had been able to make the films he wanted to make, and he was coming back to Disney on his own terms.

 &quot;Human Progress Is Built on Man&apos;s Desire to Correct His Mistakes&quot; 
 


 











Source of book image: online version of the WSJ review quoted and cited below.









 (p. A17) Yu Hua is one of China&apos;s most acclaimed novelists, hugely popular in his own country and the recipient of several international literary prizes. He brings a novelist&apos;s sensibility to &quot;China in Ten Words,&quot; his first work of nonfiction to be published in English. This short book is part personal memoir about the Cultural Revolution and part meditation on ordinary life in China today. It is also a wake-up call about widespread social discontent that has the potential to explode in an ugly way.

. . .


Mr. Yu argues that corruption infects every aspect of modern Chinese society, including the legal system. Historically, Chinese peasants with grievances could go to the capital and petition the emperor for redress. Today, Mr. Yu writes, millions--yes, millions--of desperate citizens flock to Beijing each year hoping to find an honest official who will dispense justice where the law has failed them at home. What will happen when they discover that their leaders at the national level are just as corrupt as those at the local level?

The violence and deprivations of the Cultural Revolution are by now well known, but Mr. Yu&apos;s reminiscences add color and texture to what the world has learned in recent years about that lost decade. The youthful Yu Hua is something of a wise guy and a schemer, pitting himself against bureaucratic inanities. It is sometimes impossible to know whether to laugh or cry.


. . .


As awful as the Cultural Revolution was, in Mr. Yu&apos;s telling its horrors sometimes pale next to those of the present day. The chapter on &quot;bamboozle&quot; describes how trickery, fraud and deceit have become a way of life in modern China. &quot;There is a breakdown of social morality and a confusion in the value system of China today,&quot; he states. He writes, for example, about householders around the country who are evicted from their homes on the orders of unscrupulous, all-powerful local officials.

Mr. Yu&apos;s portrait of contemporary Chinese society is deeply pessimistic. The competition is so intense that, for most people, he says, survival is &quot;like war.&quot; He has few hopeful words to offer, other than to quote the ancient philosopher Mencius, who taught that human progress is built on man&apos;s desire to correct his mistakes. Meanwhile, he writes, &quot;China&apos;s pain is mine.&quot;

 Pixar as a Case Study on Innovative Entrepreneurship 
 


 














Source of book image: http://murraylibrary.org/2011/09/the-pixar-touch-the-making-of-a-company/ 







 Toy Story and Finding Nemo are among my all-time-favorite animated movies. How Pixar developed the technology and the story-telling sense, to make these movies is an enjoyable and edifying read.

Along the way, I learned something about entrepreneurship, creative destruction, and the economics of technology. In the next couple of months I occasionally will quote passages that are memorable examples of broader points or that raise thought-provoking questions about how innovation happens.
