 You want the government to control what we eat? How about how much we eat? Has anyone else read George Orwell&apos;s&quot;Animal Farm&quot;??? Maybe you should go to your local, public library, and read it. If people cannot control themselves then it is their fault. The govt. does not need, nor do I want them, to be anywere near our rights. Stop looking for someone to regulate everything and everyone. That should be the individual&apos;s job. Not the governments. Mike D
