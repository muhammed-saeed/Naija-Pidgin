 Best Answer - Chosen by Asker
 You are invited to a dinner party, and the hostess serves food that you just hate! Just thinking about it makes you feel sick. You look at it, and wonder how to get rid of it without actually eating it. There is no dog around to serve it to under the table, and you do not want to insult your hostess so you have to think of ways to eat it, or at least look like you are eating it!
Steps

1.
add spices to cover the taste
Enlarge
add spices to cover the taste
Stare at the food you have to eat, and push it over so it does not touch any other food on the plate. Take a bite of something else, and with your fork, push the&apos;hated&apos;food around, as if you are going eat it. While playing with it, think to yourself,&quot;It isn&apos;t going to kill me.&quot;
2. Take a forkful of more food on your plate, and again, push around the&apos;dreaded&apos;food so it looks like you have eaten some. Make sure that when you push it, the plate shows through so it looks like some of it is gone.
3. If the food is soft, try adding it to another soft food on your plate, so that you do not taste it as much.
4. If it is solid food, then add a condiment to kill the taste.
5. Try to seem as if you enjoying your meal, so your hostess will not be offended, but keep pushing the hated food around to look as if you are eating it.
6. If it is solid food, then cut it into very tiny pieces so you won&apos;t choke, then maybe pick up some potatoes with it, and chew it together so you won&apos;t taste it.


Tips

* You do not have to finish everything on your plate. When you feel you cannot stand another bite, then just push the plate slightly away from you, put the napkin on the plate and just sit till others finish.
* If your hostess questions you, just tell her that you were not very hungry, but that it was delicious.


Warnings

* Remember to chew your food well so that you do not choke.

 Try it once. Go in with the thought that if you dislike it after a bite, you would discard it. I hated Brussel Sprouts .. until my wife stir-fried them and served them as&quot;optional&quot;. Boy! I finished all and am waiting for the next round.

Not all you hate now remains so forever. Try it later some time. It has been proved that kids (and adults too) need to taste something a number of times before they start liking it.

Another case in point .. beer.

 why ever would you do that? I don&apos;t eat things I hate. If its to avoid hurting someones feelings, its best to be honest and just say simply that you do not care for the taste
