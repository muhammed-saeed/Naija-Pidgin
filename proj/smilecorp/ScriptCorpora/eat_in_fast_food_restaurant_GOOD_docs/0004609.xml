 An array of animals... 
 
 
 We&apos;re like a kid at a snow cone stand -- we have several things to consider today, including a drive to get the state to outlaw one method of euthanizing animals.  And there&apos;s a missing Boston in East Dallas.  More on those things later. That photo? (Click on it to make it larger)

It&apos;s a construction site.
 
 But not just any site. 



 That&apos;s the Dallas Zoo&apos;s current 10-acre construction project, the Giants of the Savanna exhibit designed to house at least two elephants -- Jenny and zoo newcomer Gypsy -- at the outset. I snapped this photo while looking south from the Marsalis Avenue bridge adjacent to the zoo. (Aside: You see now why I work with words and not pictures.) You can read about the project at www.dallaszoo.com . 

 THE FERRIS SITUATION: Here&apos;s a LINK  to the Channel 33 report on the pro-animal demonstration at the Ferris City Council meeting Monday night. On the surface, nothing seems to have changed since the declaration that the&quot;kill&apos;em now&quot;edict had been rescinded -- except that the Ferris city officials probably realize now that they&apos;ve poked the wrong bear with a stick. More to come in this story, no doubt. 

 EVERMAN COULD USE SOME FOOD: Over the weekend we saw several e-mails about the Everman Animal Control Shelter needing food for the animals. When we asked the city Animal Control Officer Teresa Weldon if the need had been met, the answer was that it had been somewhat but more is needed. 

 &quot;We have received food donations but we are feeding around 60 dogs and 20 cats at the moment,&quot;Teresa said.&quot;Our greatest need is dog food and cat litter.&quot; 

 To offer to help, e-mail evermananimals@yahoo.com . 

 These are among the dogs you&apos;ll be helping -- that one in the middle is an earhound named Ike and it&apos;s obvious that he&apos;s getting along with other dogs. Here&apos;s the deal on Ike, though: He has already been adopted once and is looking for a home again because&quot;his new owner was&quot;transferred out of the country&quot;and Ike came back to the shelter.&quot;He is leash, house and crate trained. He is does wonderful with other dogs, cats and kids.&quot; 

 THE EUTHANASIA ISSUE:  Denise Rinker wants the State of Texas to outlaw&quot;gassing&quot;of animals in shelters. Texas allows euthanasia by needle and by gas chamber. 

 Denise says,&quot;If your heart will allow it, you should do a search for video on the web that shows the results of being gassed to death. It is heart-wrenching to watch.&quot; 

 She has prepared a petition campaign against gassing animals. Click HERE  to see the petition. And she&apos;s also prepared a video with photos of dogs who wind up in shelters. Click HERE . 

 And if you&apos;d like to encourage Denise or join her in her fight for a more humane Texas, e-mail her at dejavonrinker@yahoo.com . 

 (SOAPBOX MOMENT: Seriously, we need to come up with a phrase other than&quot;put to sleep&quot;and a word other than&quot;euthanasia&quot;to describe what happens to animals who are killed to make room for more animals who will be killed when they aren&apos;t adopted from a crowded shelter. &quot;Euthanasia&quot;suggests there is something wrong with the animal when there is not and that is too kind to the officials who approve of the killing.) 

 A MOM AND PUPPIES: This e-mail was zipping around cyberspace and landed in my inbox, so I checked with the writer, Waco W. Smith , who told me the momma dog showed up in the backyard and delivered five pups about six weeks ago. This is in Pleasant Grove near Highway 175 and LBJ in southeast Dallas (next to Balch Springs/Seagoville). 

 How much time before this Momma and pups are turned over to animal control?&quot;We are renting this house,&quot;Waco says.&quot;When the landlord finds out is when I will have to call unfortunately.&quot; 

 Last night, Waco told me that&quot;we have got someone close to White Rock Lake to come help vaccinate the puppies. It&apos;s a great help. What ever you can do for the pups and momma dog will be great.&quot;  

 Here&apos;s the original story from Waco:&quot;I&apos;m needing to know very quickly where to take the dogs. These are not my dogs and I don&apos;t have the space, time or money to take care of them. I know we have a big stray problem in this city but, that&apos;s not my fault. I&apos;m just a concerned person trying to do the right thing before I have to call City of Dallas Animal Control Services. I don&apos;t want to see these dogs being put to sleep but, I&apos;m not going to be the one to get fined or looked at being the bad guy here. The mom stray dog showed up in my backyard one day and had the pups. There are several stray dogs wandering the streets (of   Pleasant Grove) and nobody is doing nothing about it.  Contact me ASAP. Thank you.&quot; 

 Contact the writer about these dogs at wacosmith64@yahoo.com . 

 CHANCE DISCOVERY OF PUPPIES, INJURED CAT: This request for help arrived overnight from veteran rescuer and do-gooder Pat Rodriguez. There&apos;s an opportunity in West Dallas, not far from the Dallas Animal Services Adoption Center, to rescue some puppies and a kitten that&apos;s been hit by a car. 

 &quot;I recently picked up Meals on Wheels route. ... I ran into some pets that probably could use a better place to live and was wondering if you could post their story in the hopes that someone might be willing to be that better place .  

 &quot;One man had two lab puppies, looked to be about 10 – 14 weeks old. Very cute, both were on the porch and have complete access to walk out onto the street.  

 &quot;The other [situation] is a kitten, looked to be about 4 or 5 months old. I could tell something was wrong with her. She had been hit by a car and her owner just fashioned some split for the kitten . It looks that her broken bones are now healed, but she has a funny little walk. I’m guessing that she won’t be so lucky next time when she tries to outrun a car. 

 &quot;I’m pretty sure I can talk their owners into giving me these animals . Each person had other pets (and, yes, I’ll be taking them sterilization coupons of course!)&quot; 

 So, what to do?&quot;If anyone wants to help before these pets get run over or die from other factors of neglect, let me know,&quot;Pat says.&quot;I’ll pay for the shots for all these animals if I get takers. I can be contacted at patrod@sbcglobal.net .&quot; 

 SO OBVIOUSLY AN EARHOUND: Jeffrey Hartman, who with his wife Debra, fosters for Straydog Inc ., has nominated this dog Paula for celebration as&quot;Earhound of the Day.&quot; 

 Indeed, that is one spectacular set of ears. 

 Jeffrey explains,&quot;This is Paula, ex-streetdog, now being fostered for Straydog. About 8 months. old, fully vetted and ready to play.&quot; 

 You can actually meet her on Saturday at the Straydog on-site adoption at the Plano PetsMart at Parker Road and Central Expressway. 

 &quot;Paula has another dip or two for her demodex [mange],&quot;says Jeffrey.&quot;She fit in with our other 4 without any problem, no aggression of any kind. Likes laying in the grass under the sun, playing with her stuffed animals or running around the yard with our youngest dog. She does&apos;sit,&apos; and we&apos;re working on other commands too. I found her in Pleasant Grove near my work. This is an area for strays and probably breeding also. She may have been dumped or was fortunate to escape somebody&apos;s yard.&quot; 

 (To ask about adopting Paula, e-mail viewz@flash.net  or go to the Straydog website HERE to see available animals and opportunities to help.) 

 ENCOUNTER WITH PARVO: This is Paula The Bassett Puppy -- she&apos;s been having a rough time thanks to an evil virus called&quot;parvo.&quot;She&apos;s really struggling this morning, we&apos;re told. 

 If Paula were in a shelter, she&apos;d be euthanized, but she&apos;s luckily in foster care. 

 Audrey Merritt, the veteran Ennis rescuer, has been fostering three basset puppies on behalf of the Queenie Foundation. Over the weekend, Paula came down with parvo.&quot;She really needs some prayers,&quot;says Audrey. 

 If one puppy in a multiple puppy setting has it, you have to treat all of them, Audrey says. So she&apos;s looking for help financing the adventure, which has already run up a $225 bill at a local vet and is likely to settle in at around $500, she says. 

 &quot;We don&apos;t know how they got it. It is a mystery to us,&quot;She says.&quot;They&apos;ve been crated all their lives; we&apos;ve had them their entire lives..&quot; 

 There is a theory, Audrey says, that the dog&apos;s illness is connected to the parvo/distemper shot it got on Saturday. It became ill on Sunday. 

 All of the dogs have been&quot;spoken for&quot;and will be adopted as soon as they are recovered from their illness. 

 To help Audrey&apos;s medical fund, call 972-875-1597 or e-mail queeniefound2@hotmail.com .  She says a fund has been set up at the vet&apos;s and she will give the information to people who are willing to help. Or you can go to the Fundable link HERE . 

 TOTO IN TOOL: The Humane Society of Cedar Creek Lake has a nice collection of available animals these days including a Cairn Terrier named Toto and a ScottishTerrier named Westie. 

 Toto is 12 and Westie is 7. The dogs&apos;family decided they did not need the dogs, according to the society&apos;s website HERE . 

 The society is also still looking for a home for Dollar, the dog picked up at, indeed, a Dollar General Store. We featured Dollar last week -- the dog photographed in the water-filled tub at the shelter in Tool. 

 To ask about adopting any of these dogs, contact shelter manager Krista Mc Anally at 903-432-3422 or e-mail dogshsccl@yahoo.com. 

 AND IN CARROLLTON: It&apos;s going to be a close call at the Carrollton Animal Shelter today. There are some last-minute contingencies in place if nothing developes to save the cats and dogs on today&apos;s list, but you never know what&apos;ll happen. Miss Taffy, the cocker, may go somewhere. She may not. And there&apos;s been no interest in this obvious good dog, Bic. 

 To help Joe Skenesky stave off the grim reaper by adopting or rescuing, call 972-466-3420 or e-mail joe.skenesky@cityofcarrollton.com . 

 THE IRVING REPORT: This is Ozzie, the St. Bernard, who we know about thanks to veteran shelter walker/photographer Russell Posch&apos;s work at the Irving Animal Services Shelter. On the&quot;urgent&quot;list at the shelter are two barely out of their babyhood pit mixes, 5-month-old Amy and 6-month-old Clyde and this 8-year-old German Shepherd mix, Sarge. And there&apos;s Doreen the Bloodhound. And..well, the list of animals in the Irving shelter goes on and on. 

 You can read a blog dedicated to the Irving animals by clicking HERE . 

 And you can see Irving&apos;s cats by clicking HERE . The shelter&apos;s PetFinder listing is HERE . 

 Or, you can visit the shelter at 100 N. Briery -- that&apos;s just east of the intersection of Belt Line with Rock Island, a couple of miles south of Airport Freeway (183) and a couple of miles north of the Lone Star Park horse track. Call the shelter at 972-721-2256 or 972-721-2257. 

 (SOAPBOX NOTE: Well, I can&apos;t imagine what anyone is doing with a St. Bernard in this climate -- I wear a beard and it&apos;s almost too much. OK, help me off the soapbox. Watch the knees.) 

 CATCHING UP: Yesterday we mentioned a Great Dane mix and her pups at the Collin County Animal Services shelter in McKinny. Last night we got a note from our tipster, DeDe Whitcomb, veteran volunteer and rescuer, that the Collin County Humane Society pulled mom and pups, so they are all safe. 

 No doubt, the Collin County Humane Society can use some foster homes and some donations to pay for vet visits to make sure everyone is healthy. Click HERE . 

 THE ROADSIDE DOGS AND THE READERS: Remember Sherry Kunz telling us about the two dogs living near the Loop 12 and Interstate 30 interchange in West Dallas? She writes,&quot; One of your readers got Kent Robertson from Dallas Animal Services to contact me. They went to the spot that I directed them and found 2 adult dogs instead of puppies. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be. They are small and black. I asked what kind of shape they were in since they had been in the same spot since Thursday morning of last week. He said OK, but they were mangy . They ran from them but they were going to try and trap them. 

 &quot;Thanks again to you and your readers.&quot; 

 DUSTY IN OKLAHOMA: Last week we posted a note about an old Australian Shepherd named Dusty   who was&quot;on the short clock&quot;at the Edmond, Okla., Animal Shelter . You may recall that she&apos;d been dumped there because her humans decided their new condo yard was too small. Never mind that 13-year-old Dusty is overweight and arthritic and unlikely to need a pasture for running after sheep, billy goats or calves. 

 At any rate, you readers are swell. Here&apos;s the note from Cheryl M. Melton of the Forever Friends Humane Society .&quot;Thanks for posting about Dusty, Larry! We so appreciate you and all the wonderful emails we have received. I truly believe we have found her new forever home !&quot; 

 CONTEMPLATIONS: You may notice that we have a couple of notes today praising the readers , those folks who visit Readlarrypowell.com and respond to pleas for help. Here&apos;s the deal: In the world of online journalism we know we are nothing without our readers -- used to know that in print journalism, too. ... Ever vacation on the North Coast? Well, of course, people around the Great Lakes know what we&apos;re talking about. Marketing has given the United States FOUR coasts. Read about the North Coast here: http://www.americasnorthcoast.org . Wasn&apos;t Texas marketed as the Third Coast for a while? And, of course, I feel the need to point out that we live in Oak Cliff on the southern side of the Trinity River -- known to us intellectuals as, of course, the&quot; Trinity Corridor Left Bank .&quot;... Discuss: Best place to enjoy a summer day in Texas if there&apos;s no water around: In a pasture listening to bugs, watching clouds and keeping an eye open for an unpleasantly territorial bull. 

  

 ADDENDUM: BE ON THE LOOKOUT:   T his Boston Terrier has gone missing, we hear from Erin Eads who has reached us on behalf of a neighbor, Ginna Kaplan. 

 Koda, a 6-year-old, 12-pound girl, was last seen on a patio at the corner of Fitzhugh and Worth in East Dallas about 6:45 p.m. Monday. 

 The story is that Ginna had put Koda on her porch to go for a walk, then realized she left the leash in her home. She stepped in to get it, came back in 2 or 3 minutes and the dog was gone. Koda is not a runner, Ginna says. She thinks someone may have picked her up and walked away with her -- she&apos;s a very friendly dog. 

 Ginna has been warned to beware of scam artists. She&apos;s checking shelters and has papered the area with posters. The dog wasn&apos;t wearing tags but is microchipped. 

 If you&apos;ve seen Koda, call 214-213-2661 or 214-801-4786. 

 Koda isn&apos;t the&quot;type to run away,&quot;Ginna says. She says the little dog always stays close to her and doesn&apos;t&quot;chase birds or anything.&quot;

 Smurfs, shelters and stuff... 
 
 For the second day in a row the morning has brought temps in the 70s and cool rain to our corner of the world -- it is as if we have awakened on someone else&apos;s planet. 

 Normally, it would be so hot and bright outside that you think you&apos;re standing too close to the sun. 

 Now, we&apos;ve got a lot of things to address today, including the fate this very day of this Great Dane mix puppy and its siblings and mom in Collin County, so read on and we&apos;ll spotlight some animals you may be able to help. 

 FIRST, GARGAMEL: Not to get nerdy on you -- I had to look this up -- but Gargamel is a wizard who is an enemy of the Smurfs, those little blue creatures from kiddy TV. 

 And you&apos;ll see how this comes into play for this stray cat. We got the story from Patricia Barrington, the Animal Control Division Manager for The Colony. 

 She and Animal Control Officer Stephanie Byington play the roles of the Smurfs in this episode called&quot;Gargamel&apos;s Haircut.&quot;And says Patricia of the ACO,&quot;You can call her Smurfette if you want, she wears a blue uniform everyday.&quot;You have to call both of them really&quot;gutsy&quot;in their attempts to make Gargamel presentable. 

 Gargamel is a beautiful cat who, at first, appeared to be properly fluffy. But looks aren&apos;t everything. (That&apos;s pre-cut in the upper left, then fighting back on the right and on the lower left, the cat next to its pile of hair and, on the lower right, the cat wearing a&quot;What? Nothing happened here&quot;expression. 

 Here&apos;s the story from Manager Barrington: 

 &quot;As Officer Byington and I risked life and limb to get this cat’s coat off of him, the prospect of euthanizing this darn near perfect feline is just terribly frustrating. 

 &quot;You see, Gargamel came to us, looking like a nice, big ol’ furry Persian mix cat. He was purring and meowing and begging for attention, and loved pets on his nose. Petting him anywhere else resulted in a furious reaction from Gargamel.  

 &quot;After the first three or four furious reactions, we discovered that he was declawed, which basically meant we could manage handling him without being shredded; so we did. 

 &quot;Turns out, petting beyond his nose was agonizing. He was matted like no cat I’ve ever seen. Wads of matted fur pulling his flesh with every pet he was given. 

 &quot;So, Officer Byington and I decided we’d shave him. He was cooperative for the first 45 minutes, after that it was a battle of wills and us people won.  

 &quot;After removing clump of fur after clump of fur, we discovered Gargamel was not only declawed but was also a neutered male.  

 &quot;So, there you have it, a nicely shaved, declawed, neutered cat with a personality as big as Texas. All this can belong to you for the meager price of a rabies vaccination plus a $20 adoption fee … that’s a heck of a deal in these economic times. And, if Gargamel isn’t your cup of tea, we still have Evander the 1 ½-eared neutered, declawed kitty as well as Senior, the long haired buff, neutered declawed boy..&quot; 

 Now, Evander and Senior are not&quot;Smurf names,&quot;but, Patricia says,&quot;If you check out [The Colony&apos;s list on] PetFinder, you&apos;ll see severa Smurf names. It&apos;s our theme for the rest of the month.&quot;Click HERE to see that link. 

 And to ask about adopting Gargamel, Evander Senior or any other critter at The Colony, call 972-370-9250 or e-mail pbarrington@thecolonytx.gov . Or drop by the shelter at 4720 E. Lake Highlands in The Colony. 

 MEANWHILE IN COLLIN COUNTY, YOUNG DOGS, OLD DOGS AND AN EARHOUND: Our tipster DeDe Whitcombe tells us that there are some dire situations in the Collin County Animal Services Shelter in McKinney and that some are newborns and some are seniors. No doubt, there are some in between, too. 

 First up there&apos;s the case of the Great Dane mix momma who was surrendered by her human along with SIX newborns, including the one pictured at the outset of today&apos;s report. 

 The mother dog was&quot;in horrendous shape,&quot;says DeDe, so she quickly went on the euthanasia list and today is her last day unless someone steps up.&quot;I&apos;m praying for a miracle,&quot;DeDe says. 

 There&apos;s also a Sharpei mom with four newborns. 

 And there are the senior dogs. They include a Pomeranian, a small Jack Russell-type --&quot;He sounds like a frog, his voice is so raspy.&quot;And a older Beagle girl who is -- could there be any doubt -- our earhound for the day. Look at those long, velvety ears -- they&apos;re made for gentle tugging as you and the dog watch TV or read a good book. 

 All of these dogs are at the Collin County Animal Services Shelter in McKinney. Call 972-547-7292 or e-mail animashelter@co.collin.tx.us . to ask about rescuing any of these animals. You can read about the shelter and its adoption and rescue policies HERE .    

 The shelter and its volunteers work hard to move animals out of the shelter in a happy way, into rescue groups or to the SPCA or into the arms of a loving human or at least keep them a step ahead of the Grim Reaper. 

 HELPING SOME CATS: We got this note from several sources, and to make sure the situation had not be resolved we went to the source, Cheryl Swafford, who is still looking for help with three family cats. 

 Her original note read,&quot;My sweet mother-in-law passed away last Monday morning and left behind 3 beautiful and wonderful cats. Two are sisters from the same litter. One (Sissy) has long hair and the other (Sugar) has a medium length coat. They are both calico. They are about 10 years old and are as sweet as they can be. The third one is a male black cat named Salem. 

 &quot;He was very, very attached to his people (my mother-in-law and father-in-law who also passed away). Salem is an extremely smart kitty (about 5 years old) who loves men best, but loves women almost as much. He tries to talk and is just amazing.  

 &quot;All three cats are spayed/neutered and are up to date on their shots. 

 &quot;My mother in law made arrangements to have a woman from a rescue group take her cats in the event of her death, but that person says they are full and cannot foster them.&quot;We will not be able to keep the house much longer and cannot take the cats because we have a dog. We are desperate to find a loving place for these wonderful cats.&quot; 

 To offer to help Cheryl, e-mail CLswaff567@yahoo.com  or call 972-867-8083. 

 Cheryl adds,&quot;These are cats that have never been outside and have been loved and spoiled.&quot;Which is exactly how cats should be treated. 

 CARROLLTON CRITTERS: Dogs and cats wind up in the Carrollton Animal Services Shelter every day and just about every day, some are adopted or moved out by rescue groups. 

 This is a city shelter, so if a human doesn&apos;t save them, well, you know. To quote Groucho Marks,&quot;If man is a dog&apos;s best friend, the dog is in trouble.&quot;
Still, there are people who rise to the occasion. Their opportunities in Carrollton today include these cats -- Nemo, the striped cat, and Pearl, the lounging cat. They are two of four cats that were left behind in an apartment when the people moved. Wasn&apos;t that nice? 

 Nemo, says the official report, is a&quot;little quiet and would do better in a home without small children.&quot;Pearl can handle anything -- she&apos;ll flop over anywhere and enjoy a good petting session. 

 Then, when it comes to dogs, there&apos;s Bic, that reddish retriever mix who arrived as a stray. Just something about that look that makes Bic appear to be ready to accompany a human on any mission from walking in the park to shopping in a major department store (he&apos;d need his own credit card, of course). 

 And Dutchess, with the jaunty ears, is a 3- or 4-month-old shepherd mix girl who came in as a stray. She&apos;ll probably grow to be a&quot;large&quot;dog. She&apos;s just a puppy and learning how to behave, but she&apos;s not keen on sharing a dog bowl with other pups. 

 And, alas, there is Miss Taffy, an older Cocker Spaniel who arrived as a stray. I&apos;ve seen that look on our Cocker, Inky. It is the look of a dog who feels as if she&apos;s been caught doing something she should not be doing. And she&apos;s looking for forgiveness. Sadly, Miss Taffy has probably done nothing wrong in her entire life. It&apos;s not her fault that she became a&quot;stray&quot;-- some human let her down. 

 To ask about any of these Carrollton animals, call 972-466-3420 or e-mail joe.skenesky@cityofcarrollton.com . 

 MEANWHILE IN OKLAHOMA: Our Burns Flat, Okla., tipster Terry Lynn Fisher has sent us a couple of notes about some dogs in Corn, Okla. 

 Corn is about an hour east of Burns Flat, which is about .. well, Google it and you can get directions to these dogs. 

 Terry Lynn is trying to help find places for these two to go. 

 Sandy is the 13-year-old part Beagle who fills the frame in this photo. She&apos;s good with kids, loves to be petted and has been left alone because her human went into a nursing home. If no one steps up for Sandy, she&apos;ll go into a&quot;high-kill shelter&quot;on Friday. 

 The little year-and-a-half-old Dachshund in the other photo&quot;has been severely abused. He is totally terrified... He is too scared to even eat or drink, so the people [who have him right now] are&apos;forcing it,&quot;Terry Lynn says.&quot;Gee, I imagine that is going over really well. This one needs someone that understand his fear. He goes to the pound Saturday. He will be put down ASAP for he is so terrified they will not even mess with him. ... He needs his own special angel.&quot; 

 To help these dogs, contact Terry Lynn at remembering_oddball@yahoo.com or call 580-330-1459. 

 TOP DOG SPEAKER SERIES REMINDER: The Companions For Life Top Dog Speaker Series has some room left for rescuers and shelter staffers at Wednesday nights&apos;event: Shama Hyder, founder of Click To Client, host of a web TV show and a social media marketing expert, will discuss&quot;Hot To Use Social Media To Build Buzz and Further Your Message.&quot;the event is from 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. at REI, 4515 LBJ Freeway, in Dallas. REI has conference rooms above the merchandise floor. You must have a reservation. E-mail info@companionsforlife.org . And CFL President Rebecca Poling notes that the session&quot;has been approved for 1.5 CEU credits for ACOs by Texas Department of State Health Services, Zoonosis Control Branch.&quot; 

 CONTEMPLATIONS: Our lament yesterday that there was nothing on TV except paid programming inspired Jeff Stuart of Dallas to write,&quot;As a fellow insomniac , I can identify with the&apos;Paid Programming&apos;comment -- but what makes them worse is the fact that some still have commercials in them.&quot;Amen, amen, amen. ... Yesterday I heard a TV reporter breathlessly reveal that murdered ex-NFL quarterback Steve McNair&quot;had twice the legal limit of alcohol in his body.&quot;He was shot to death while sitting on a couch -- who knew there was a legal limit for sitting on a couch? TV reporters -- their words often demonstrate why people need editors. ... One more note about the moon: As I watched part of a documentary last night about the first American moon landing, I was reminded that for a while in 1969 and 1970 you could find lunar-related marketing in lots of places. In my hometown, there was a fast-food restaurant designed, as I recall, to look like a lunar lander and it was called the&quot;Moonburger.&quot;I guess they were out of this world -- I have to guess because the place shut down before I could make time to stop by and order one. The moon, while good for songs, was not that good for marketing, I guess.

 Jazz, Ferris, Gina, a pumpkin patch&amp;the moon 
 
 It&apos;s the 40th anniversary of the alleged moon landing -- kidding about that alleged part. 

 And we&apos;re having splashdown in North Texas -- rain actually falling and drenching the earth. In the meantime, there are other things to consider: 

 THE STORY OF JAZZ CONTINUES: Last week we told you of concerns about a female Rottweiller named Jazz who was being kept in an unpleasant situation and, according to her owner, was suffering from a degenerative muscle disease. 

 Brenda Bredemeyer told us this story about a neighbor&apos;s dog and asked if anyone could help the dog. That dog is now out of that yard and in the East Lake Veterinary Hospital. Nancy Underwood, the veteran rescuer, suggested that Brenda tell the neighbor that Nancy would buy the dog from him and the guy said, basically,&quot;Just take her.&quot; 

 Sometimes it takes a team to help an animal. Nancy arranged to get the dog into the clinic and here&apos;s the latest from Brenda: 

 &quot;My husband, Terry, and I took Jazz to the East Lake Vet Hospital this morning [Saturday]. Nancy Underwood arranged everything. She is an amazing woman. Nancy called me this afternoon [Saturday] and told me what the Vet said. 

 &quot;Jazz does have a Degenerative Muscle Disease. Her eyes are the way they are because of the disease. She has no muscle in her head so there is no muscle to hold her eyes in place. She can&apos;t eat because of the disease. Her feet are all cut up and infected. She weighs 53 pounds. They put her on antibiotics and are going to keep her there for a week. Nancy said the vet will call her Thursday and let her know how Jazz is doing. &quot;They are going to put her on Prednisone to help build up the remaining muscle she has. They are going to try and get some food down her. ... If, after a week, she is not doing any better, they will put her down. Nancy said if they have to put her down, she will come in from Austin and be there with Jazz and so will I. At least now she is not out in the hot sun and she&apos;s in the best of care. 

 &quot;We got her last night [Friday] and brought her to our house. I petted her, rubbed, scratched and massaged her and it felt as if she didn&apos;t know what to think other than she loved it. I talked to her and cried every time I looked into her eyes. This morning before we took her to East Lake, I spent some time with her just talking to her and massaging and petting her. I told her I love her and she going to be loved and taken care of. When I would stop petting her, she would nudge me with her nose and follow me everywhere I went. She is such a sweet dog.&quot; 

 And, Brenda echoes a question many a rescuer has asked through the years,&quot;&quot;It infuriates me that so many people treat animals this way. I don&apos;t understand why they get a pet if they are not going to love it and take care of it.&quot; 

 To ask about helping with Jazz&apos;s expenses, e-mail nancycunderwood@gmail.com .   You can read about East Lake Veterinary Hospital at  www.welovepets.net . The East Lake mailing address is 10101 E. Northwest Highway, Dallas, 75238. While you&apos;re at the website, click on the adoptions button to see the East Lake Pet Orphanage&quot;inventory.&quot; 

 BIG DAY IN FERRIS: This is the day the animal folks are supposed to show up for the Ferris City Council meeting to demonstrate in favor of less euthanasia and more adoptions, to boil it down to the basics. You may recall this all bubbled to the surface when a city official basically told Animal Control Officer Misty Clark to stop worrying about adoptions and start euthanizing the animals. Rescue groups and concerned animal lovers rose to support her and claimed the animals in the shelter. Click HERE to read the Ellis County Press account of the situation and an interesting quote from the interim city manager about using the order as a&quot;shock factor.&quot;It&apos;s possible the&quot;shock factor&quot;boomeranged. At www.cityofferristexas.org  you&apos;ll see that tonight&apos;s council meeting begins at 7 p.m. Demonstrators have issued the call to gather at 6 at city hall. 

 GINA&apos;S BRIEF REPRIEVE: The big dog, Gina, who loves people but not particularly other dogs, has been given a reprieve at the Denton Animal Control shelter -- she has until Thursday if no one steps up to take her. 

 As you may recall from last week, shelter volunteer Amy Pelzel, who adores this dog, tried her out at home but Gina was territorial and jealous and not keen on sharing with other dogs. On her own witha human, she is an angel. That&apos;s the way it works sometime. Lord knows what happened in her past to make her unhappy around other dogs. 

 Originally she was to have been put to sleep during the weekend, but Amy has prevailed at least until Thursday in hopes of saving this dog. 

 To ask about Gina and to help her, e-mail amy_pelzel@yahoo.com . 

 THE ROADSIDE DOGS: Last week we mentioned that veteran rescuer Sherry Kunz had spotted two pups romping in a hard-to-get-to area at the Loop 12-Interstate 30 intersection west of downtown Dallas. Here&apos;s today&apos;s report and Sherry still needs help with these pups -- but even more. Why? Because there are more pups . She writes. 

 &quot;The pups were still there this morning. It’s obvious they are living there. It’s also just a matter of time before they are run over. I saw 8 strays this morning, counting the pups. What do other people do that want to rescue dogs? I’m depressed and I’m overwhelmed with the dogs I already have. I know all rescue groups and shelters are full. I didn’t receive any response from my request that you put on your website Thursday. I’m not even sure how to get to these puppies without scaring them into the traffic. 

 &quot;I’m not even sure that one person could rescue them. There is no place to pull off the road. It’s not a great area for a female alone to be trying to rescue them. If someone has an idea of how to rescue them, I will gladly help. 

 &quot;Email me at sykunz@att.net . Again, they are in the grassy area to the right as you exit I-30 east to Loop 12 North. I have not seen a Mama dog. I don’t know how they are surviving but they won’t much longer. Please, can someone help or at least give me some advice on how to catch them?&quot; 

 PET WATCH SUMMIT REMINDER: The Pet Watch Summit, a gathering of neighborhood pet watch groups and people who are interested in forming them, is scheduled for 7 p.m. Tuesday -- meet&apos;n&apos;greet starts at 6:30 -- at the office of For The Love of the Lake in the Casa Linda Shopping Center, Garland at Buckner in Dallas. Animals benefit from human teamwork. For more info, call 214-328-0508 or e-mail info@lfhainimalalert.org . 

 PRAYERS&amp;PASSAGES: Joyce Conley has written a loving tribute to her dog Ariel (left). You can read it on our Prayers&amp;Passages page -- click on the button in the upper right corner of this page. 

 NEW TO BURNS FLAT: The dogs continue to arrive in Burns Flat, Okla. The latest, according to our tipster Terry Lynn Fisher, is&quot;this doll.&quot; 

 She&apos;s less than three months old and&quot;too darn cute,&quot;Terry Lynn says.&quot;She&apos;s sweet, loving and playful. She looks very healthy and like somebody has cared for her.&quot; 

 The little dog is enjoying playing with a Burns Flat dog we featured last week, Twilla the&quot;pitty girl.&quot;To ask about helping either of these dogs, e-mail remembering_oddball@yahoo.com or call 580-330-1459. 

 TODAY&apos;S LUNAR EARHOUND: Well, it&apos;s only appropriate that to celebrate the 40th anniversary of man&apos;s lunar landing, we feature a little dog who looks like he might have the ears to catch signals from the moon. 

 This is Riley, a 2-year-old Chihuahua mix who weighs in at 11 pounds and is in the Dallas Animal Services shelter because his&quot;previous owners could no longer take care of him.&quot; 

 Amazingly, this little guy --again, only ELEVEN POUNDS -- has been available since June 24. 

 To ask about adopting Riley, stop by the Dallas Animal Services Shelter at I-30 and Westmoreland. Visit www.dallasanimalservices.com   to see the many, many dogs and cats available for adoption in Dallas&apos;big facility. 

 You can get Riley for under a hundred bucks -- less than $10 a pound. Quite the bargain. 

 REMINDER: Each quarter, Urban Animal magazine publishes a list of animal-related events . We want to include your events. So, rescuers, rescue groups, shelters, friends of shelters, bars, parks, city halls, etc., if you have an animal event coming up in September, October, November or beyond , send that announcement to lrpmail@aol.com and put EVENT in the subject line . Urban Animal is proud to offer the free listing to people who are helping animals -- especially if you keep it simple. Just a few succinct lines. I&apos;m begging you to keep it simple. 

 CONTEMPLATIONS: Another thrilling win for the Texas Rangers -- extra-inning, walk-off homer by Ian Kinsler. He&apos;s got to be an All-Star next year, don&apos;t you think? Especially if the Rangers get into the playoffs. Sorry, got carried away. Forgot it was (a) the Rangers and (b) after the all-star break. ... As an insomniac, I click through a lot of TV channels . Things are so dismal sometimes I&apos;d almost pay money to see a test pattern instead of&quot;paid programming.&quot;... Yesterday I planted my annual pumpkin patch . Today it rains. Maybe that&apos;s a sign that by October, the front yard may be gloriously orange with pumpkins . Of course, in my two decades of trying to grow pumpkins, I&apos;ve had lots of greenery but few admirable pumpkins. This, like the Texas Rangers, could be the year. And I&apos;ll be dancing with the Rockettes at Christmas.

 A napper gets a break... 
 
   

 In the years that we&apos;ve been presenting our weekend feature, Let Sleeping Dogs Lie&amp;Napping Cats Nap , we have always featured a critter that had a human in its household. 

 This time we&apos;re doing that, but just barely. 

 We got this photo of snoozing Ariel in an e-mail with the subject line&quot;A Napping Cat and a Dirty Rotten Kitty.&quot;Now, that sounds like a sleeping cat is being swatted by a pesky pal, doesn&apos;t it? 

 But, nope. This photo was snapped by Jonnie England, the Director of Animal Advocacy and Communications for the Metroplex Animal Coalition during a visit to the Dallas Animal Services Adoption Center at I-30 and Westmoreland. 

 She managed to snap Ariel as she was in the deep throes of catnapping   in her   shelter bed with her favorite doll at the time, Dirty Rotten Kitty. (Click on the photo to make it larger.) 

 Ariel, also pictured glaring at the camera after being awakened,&quot;finally got adopted last Saturday, the day after I took that photo,&quot;Jonnie says.&quot;She was there for more than a month for some unfathomable reason.&quot; 

 We don&apos;t know who adopted Ariel, but we suspect Ariel has become a favored household napper. She has that look. 

 Now Jonnie would never let an opportunity to promote an adoptable cat go by, so she included photos of three awake cats as a hint to people who don&apos;t have a good cat friend at their homes. 

 

   

 These cats are (top left) Bongo, then (bottom left) the unfortunately named Booger, and Silver Belle. Unless someone adopted them overnight, all are available for taking home this weekend. You just have to show up at the Dallas Animal Services Adoption Center and apply. See how by going to www.dallasanimalservices.com . 

 (Remember, you can nominate your dozing critter for spotlighting in Let Sleeping Dogs Lie&amp;Napping Cats Nap by sending the phot of the snoozer and info to dallrp@aol.com . We are insomniacs, so we celebrate the easy sleepers.) 

 NOW, SOME ADDITIONAL ANIMAL SITUATIONS: 

             Normally our weekend is reserved for sleeping and napping and snoozing critters, but this weekend, we&apos;ve got some timely things that need to be attended to so we will. And we know readership is down on weekends, but you never know who is reading who might be able to help, so that&apos;s why we&apos;re adding these items. Please pass the news along to your friends, neighbors, loved ones, relatives, ex-in-laws, acquaintances and strangers you may see at the washateria or at the pool hall that Readlarrypowell.com is open for business nearly all the time. They should feel free to click. 

 Our weekend items. 

             -- Edna Taylor, one of our reliable tipsters in Houston is trying to help someone with cats in Dallas . She writes,&quot;I have a dear friend in Dallas who has been out of work for a ye ar. She has the opportunity to come to Houston for a week (next week) to apply for several jobs. She is doing everything humanly possible to keep her pets and is hoping that someone can foster her cats for ONLY the week she will be in Houston and do so without charging her. Any ideas?&quot;Well, kids, I know there are people in Dallas who are helpful -- if you can help foster the cats and give the Dallas person a break, e-mail tayloredna@msn.com . 

             -- Also from Houston , the folks with the rescue group Scout&apos;s Honor are looking for foster homes for kittens. Hmmm, this foster situation may be a statewide dilemma. To offer to foster kittens, e-mail info@scoutshonor.org . 

 But Scout&apos;s Honor isn&apos;t just looking for homes for kittens, there&apos;s also this cat Lucy, who appears to be about 5 years old.. She is named in honor of the star, Lucille Ball, because of her red hair.   The cat was a stray, found on the front steps of an office after being loose for so long that she not only got skinny and tired but also, gasp, dirty. It couldn&apos;t have been easy for Lucy -- whoever had her first also had her declawed. A cat without claws in strange territory is living a tough life. 

 She&apos;s now been in the care of Scouts Honor for a while.   And, she&apos;s available to anyone who will make sure she&apos;s an indoor girl.   Again, that address is info@scoutshonor.org . 

 MEANWHILE IN OKLAHOMA: Our hardworking tipster Terry Lynn Fisher of Burns Flat, Okla., in the western part of the state, nearly 100 miles due north of Wichita Falls, has some cases that need some help. 

 One is this female Rottie whose owners are in the military and are being sent to Alaska but can&apos;t take the dogs -- family members are taking the small ones, but Sable the Rottie has no place to go. She&apos;s&quot;available to good home.&quot; 

 And, while in the past couple of weeks, Burns Flat&apos;s animal control has had a Scottie and a Pug (both saved, of course) and there are always some mixes in the crowd. In this case, we&apos;re talking about Twilla, a pit mix, who is under 6 months old and is&quot;very loving,&quot;Terry Lynn says. Because the dog had a&quot;bad family,&quot;the dog was rescued and is now awaiting her fate in the Burns Flat shelter. 

 To help either of these dogs, e-mail remembering_oddball@yahoo.com or call 580-330-1459. 

 And, as long as we&apos;re crossing the Red River and visiting Oklahoma, we ought to mention a tip about an old Australian Shepherd we got from Terry Lynn about a situation in the Edmond Animal Shelter. Edmond is just north of Oklahoma City, about 215 miles north of Dallas on I-35, and halfway across the state from Burns Flat. 

 In forwarding this note, Terry Lynn said,&quot;This is just straight up wrong.&quot;And she says,&quot;If anyone can help this poor old girl, I can help with transport.&quot; 

 The story is Dusty is on a short clock in the Edmond Animal Shelter . She was&quot;dumped at the shelter for the worst reason!,&quot;according to a note from Cheryl Melton of Forever Friends.&quot;[Her humans] moved into a condo and the yard is too small! &quot; 

 Dusty is 13, spayed, overweight and beleaguered by arthritis. But she&apos;s had obedience training and earned a Companion Dog ranking and Canine Good Citizen ranking and is being surrendered after spending her entire life with the same people who say their condo yard is too small. I don&apos;t know how much room an overweight, arthritic, 13-year-old dog needs. 

 To help her, e-mail plumbattycathouse@yahoo.com or remembering_oddball@yahoo.com . 

 FERRIS REMINDER: Well, this Ferris situation, where the city wants to step-up the euthanasia rate rather than let a hard-working animal control officer save the animals&apos;lives through adoption and rescue, is going to turn up in the news at some point Monday, one suspects. We&apos;ve had word from several people in the rescue community that they&apos;re going to show up for the 7 p.m. Monday council meeting in Ferris City Hall at 100 Town Plaza. You probably recall that Animal Control Officer Misty Clark says a city official told her to euthanize the animals in the shelter rather than try to save them. The council backed off but not completely. And some think this all boiled over because the animal control officer had asked the city council to put a restroom in the animal shelter. 

 One hopes everyone will experience dramatic enlightenment , animals will be saved and humans will get along. And I&apos;ll be dancing with the Radio City Music Hall Rockettes this Christmas. 

 CONTEMPLATION: Use your weekend wisely. You never know when you&apos;ll need extra energy on Monday morning . ... Let&apos;s all think positively regarding the economy -- some of us would like to have jobs that paid actual money one more time before we go to that great unemployment office in the sky. ... There is a theory that when the Dallas Cowboys do well, Dallas does well. But that was before the Cowboys moved out of the county. All those Cowboys seem to be doing well . George Bernard Shaw said,&quot; Youth is wasted on the young &quot;but the truth is money is wasted on the young . I say this from an older vantage point.

 The Friday report... 
 
 Son of a gun, there really was a&quot;cold snap,&quot;just like the weather people predicted. Actual rain fell on our yard. The grass was puzzled. Now, let&apos;s move on to such things as Gina, the Denton dog, needing a place to go ASAP. So many animals race the clock, here&apos;s a chance for one to win. 

 A SPECIAL BOWSER AND CORINNE&apos;S PUPPIES: Our longtime tipster Gail Whelan of the Companion Animal Network contacted us with two extraordinary situations. First up is Bowser, this handsome fellow.&quot;I pulled this little tyke last week along with two other dogs from Arlington,&quot; says Gail.&quot;He followed one of the others around a lot, slept and ate and seemed normal. Then I noticed that when I came into the room all the others stood and wagged, but he stayed asleep. I decided to drop a stainless steel bowl near him when he was sleeping. You guessed it -- NADA. I&apos;ve tried clapping, whistling, everything I can think of -- but I do believe he is deaf. 

 &quot;I need to find a deaf dog rescue group -- or at least a foster that is experienced in working with deaf dogs.&quot; 

 She says Bowser is 4 1/2 months old, an American Bulldog-Pointer mix.&quot;I know he is a pointer because he points at birds!,&quot;she says.   &quot;He is a beautiful and sweet boy that needs an experienced person to help him reach his potential.&quot; 

 (To ask about any CAN critter, e-mail can_rescue@yahoo.com or call 214-808-3238.) 

 Use that info also to contact CAN about this dog and her puppies. She is Corrine, a 15-pound dapple Dachshund-Corgi mix. And her puppies are, well, even more mixed. Corinne, says Gail,&quot;has been a wonderful momma.&quot;And she says the puppies (these are some examples of the mixtures -- Crawl is the brown one, Charlie is the active one) are well-socialized and ready for adoption. 

 Here&apos;s the back story from Gail.&quot;A few months ago we pulled a sweet little dog from the Cleburne shelter. We were told it was a male. Not only was it NOT a males, but she was pregnant.&quot; 

 THE GINA STORY: Earlier we reported on a dog named Gina who was in the Denton Animal Services shelter and had sort of&quot;adopted&quot;volunteer Amy Pelzel, one of our reliable tipsters. 

 Amy fell for the dog, too. And, knowing that Gina was on the clock, she decided to see if the adorable dog could squeeze into her already well-populated dog home. 

 Alas, Gina is more of an alpha dog and is devoted to Amy. The mixture makes adjustment worse than difficult, so now the task is to find Gina   a good home. And the clock is ticking. 

 Amy realizes now that she can&apos;t keep her friend Gina,   so she&apos;s looking for a home for the otherwise adorable and well-behaved dog. She has returned Gina to the Denton Animal Services shelter and is&quot;praying that someone adopts her. If not...I know her fate is Monday.&quot; 

 While Gina might not be keen on some of the other dogs in the house, she appears to have room in her life for a human.&quot;She is such a sweetie -- slept in bed right next to me last night,&quot;Amy says. 

 To save this dog&apos;s life, e-mail amy_pelzel@yahoo.com . The shelter link is HERE  and the shelter is here: 300 South Woodrow Lane, Denton, TX 76205. Call 940-349-7594. While the shelter is closed to the public on Sunday and Monday morning, rescues can contact Amy anytime and the place opens for adoptions after 1 p.m. on Mondays. Still, Gina has a slim window . 

 A DOLLAR AT CEDAR CREEK: A few weeks ago we mentioned that Krista Mc Anally, the manager of the Humane Society of Cedar Creek Lake Shelter at Tool was looking for a volunteer to take photos and help post available critters on Pathfinder. 

 Cari Weinberg answered the call and has sent us a look at a special dog at the shelter -- that&apos;s the dog soaking in the water trough. 

 &quot;Her name is Dollar,&quot;Cari says,&quot;and she has personality and then some! She is a friendly, outgoing German Shepherd mix who seems to have a sense of humor. I met her on a hot a day and she would occasionally leave my side to go take a dunk in a little tub of water set up in her pen (&quot;Hey, guys, everybody in the pool!&apos;), then she&apos;d hop back out and run around. 

 &quot;She was found in the parking lot of a Dollar General Store in Denton. The Good Samaritan who found her had her inside for a few days before bringing her to the shelter and it seems that Miss Dollar is housebroken. She is also spayed and has all of her shots. and best of all, she is one happy lady.&quot; 

 Cari adds,&quot;The shelter is really meeting a need and they are doing great things down there. I’m at my pet maximum at home, but there were some terrific dogs there at the shelter – if I had room at home, Dollar would have a guaranteed spot on my sofa.&quot; 

 Click HERE to see the shelter link. Call the shelter at 903-432-3422. 

 THE TWO-DOG DROPOFF: Earlier this week I was talking to the folks at our vet&apos;s office in Oak Cliff and they told me about coming to work and finding two kittens in a suitcase on the front porch. They found homes for those kittens. Then, I got a note from Tina Hamilton with Happy Tails of Gun Barrel City about these two white Chihuahuas. 

 They were dropped off in Gun Barrel City -- in the heat, in the sun and not in a safe situation. 

 But someone spotted them and got them to Tina and she says they both arrived with mange and very long nails. Obviously they&apos;ve been neglected and someone who didn&apos;t want to or couldn&apos;t afford good care for them just decided&quot;time to hand them off to someone else.&quot; 

 So, Happy Tails could use two things: someone to give these dogs a home and some donations to help with their medical care. To ask about the dogs or to offer to help, e-mail txtina1201@yahoo.com . 

 DOGFIGHT HOTLINE: Our pal Bekki Harvey who keeps up with a lot of animal stuff and wades into rescuing, too, sent us this note about an important phone number announced this week. The Humane Society of the United States , in the wake of the big dog fight ring arrests in Texas, Missouri, Arkansas and other states earlier this month, has set up a hotline to handle tips on dogfighting and cockfighting and any other fighting that involves animals. Clip this and keep it handy 877-TIP-HSUS , which translates to 877-847-4787. Rewards go up to $5,000 for information leading&quot;to the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in dogfighting or cockfighting.&quot; 

 HELPING THE PUPPIES: Earlier this week we got a copy of a note from Karen Langston of the West Side Animal League in White Settlement. She&apos;d been at the warehouse where the Humane Society of North Texas is caring for the hundreds of dogs seized in that Montague County puppy mill&quot;bust.&quot;She writes of HSNT&apos;s need for volunteers and says,&quot;If you can handle bending, squatting, and crawling into crates on the floor to clean up poop, pee, and other yucky stuff , they desperately need more volunteers . It took me and two other volunteers 3 solid hours to feed, water and clean the crates of the dogs on our two rows and there are about 8 rows of dogs. It&apos;s hard to see them confined in the crates but they need our help .&quot; 

 To volunteer to help -- and you&apos;d better be serious about helping -- e-mail kninebuddy@sbcglobal.net . 

 BROWSING IN DALLAS: While looking at the available animals on the Dallas Animal Services website HERE , I found the Earp brothers, Morgan and Wyatt, though they do not resemble each other except in history only and, of course, they&apos;re both dogs. 

 But Morgan is our Earhound today. Look at that set of ears. He can probably hear the Clanton Gang sneaking up on a sand dune while wearing cotton boots. Morgan is a 10-month old pit-Catahoula mix who weighs 42 pounds and came in as a stray on May 17. 

 That Dachshund is 2-year-old Wyatt Earp who weighs in at 17 pounds. He arrived as a stray on May 14. And, you know, Wyatt has a nice set of ears, too. The kind a person can enjoy petting while watching TV with a lap dog. 

 Both can be adopted at the Dallas Animal Services Adoption Center at I-30 and Westmoreland just minutes west of downtown Dallas. You can see Dallas&apos;available shelter animals at www.dallasanimalservices.com . 

 THINGS TO NOTE: The band 17 Hands High continues its charitable ways by performing Saturday on behalf of seeking a cure for breast cancer. The event is -- I&apos;m not making this up -- the Save The Boobies Volleyball Tournament (Click HERE at the Lone Star Country Club, 1849 E. Belt Line Road in Coppell. The tournament starts at 4 p.m. and 17 Hands High (our musician son Bart is the band&apos;s Tex the Bassman ).presents its rockin&apos;brand of country music -- I call it&quot;bootrock,&quot;but what do I know? -- about 5:30 p.m. on the club&apos;s stage. ... The writer/editor Nicole Sica , whose animal website had a loyal following, has announced the end of her Poocini Report. See www.poocini.com . ... DFW Pug Rescue will benefit from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday when Dirty Dawgs hosts a dog wash at its Plano facility, 4801 W. Park Blvd. Suite 421. DFW   Pug Rescue volunteers will do the bathing. A percentage of the proceeds goes to the rescue group. ... Southlake&apos;s Farpointe Cellar hosts a benefit from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday for the Greyhound Adoption League of Texas -- they&apos;re calling it&quot;Premium Pour For Paws.&quot;Tickets are $60 at the door. Not only do you get to sample wine -- including what they call a&quot;surprise Pinot Noir&quot;and I have no idea what makes wine a surprise -- but you can participate in a silent auction. See www.galtx.org . Farpointe is at 721 e. Southlake Boulevard. 

 CONTEMPLATIONS: My vacuum cleaner and I were talking things over this week an we asked this question: Are dogs shedding more this summer than in past years? ... We have a dog, Annie, who, when you turn on the vacuum, gets up, trots to Martha&apos;s bathroom and jumps into the tub and sits until the&quot;storm&quot;is over. We don&apos;t know why. She&apos;s only ever lived with us and we&apos;ve never chased her with the vacuum cleaner. She may have read a tornado emergency handbook and mistakes the sound of the vacuum for the sound of a freight train. ... Is breakfast the most important meal of the day or is a platter of nachos ?

 PM edition: Cash found; others wait... 
 
 
 Here we go with an amazing story to start our PM edition of Readlarrypowell.com. 

 And we&apos;d be remiss if we didn&apos;t remind people who don&apos;t have animals that city shelters are loaded with them. Their only hope is humans. And this dog is Annabelle the Labradoodle in Corsicana. You can help her. Just read on: 

 HUNT FOR CASH PAYS OFF: Back on June 11 we posted a note about an Aussie lost in Colleyville and just before noon we got a call from Zora Quinn as she drove her dog home from his adventure. He was&quot;dirty and smelly, stinky,&quot;she said,&quot;but he was back in her care. 

 Yep, from June 11 until this morning about 5:30 Cash the Aussie had been missing from the home of Zora and Matt Quinn. 

 But it isn&apos;t like he had totally vanished. The folks in the cul de sac on Cimarron seven or eight miles away in Hurst sure knew he was around. 

 &quot;He&apos;s terrorized that neighborhood -- I owe them big,&quot;says Zora.&quot;He&apos;s eaten bushes, swum in people&apos;s pools, eaten their newspapers. He&apos;s eaten two pair of shoes. 

 &quot;In fact, he&apos;s 10 pounds fatter than when I had him before.&quot; 

 Yes, the neighbors, unable to catch the dog, had called animal control, but Cash eluded the professionals, too. 

 Three days ago, a Hurst Animal Control officer who had one of Zora&apos;s Cash flyers in the truck, called to say that a similar dog had been spotted in the neighborhood. Zora had made about a thousand of those little posters, contacted websites, made calls, etc. Everything you ought to do to try to find a dog. 

 Last night, she says, there were four sightings in the neighborhood. So she decided to&quot;camp&quot;there and wait. At 5 a.m., she says, she spotted him sleeping on a front porch and reclaimed her dog. 

 In the time that Cash was gone, the household added something new. The woman from whom they&apos;d gotten Cash felt so sad about the dog vanishing that she gave the Quinns a puppy. So, now Cash has a playmate -- his half-brother, a young red merle Aussie named Levi. 

 There is one big question to ask about this more-than-a-month-long adventure, but only Cash can answer it. Did someone drive you that far and dump you? 

 And, once again, the words of our late pal from Find-a-Pet, Joe Cranford, prove to be true. When your pet goes missing, get the word out. Post signs, tell friends and strangers and check the shelters. And, especially, don&apos;t give up. 

 NOW THAT&apos;S A FACE: This cat on the right is one of five tuxedo kittens that our Houston tipster and noted cat rescuer Edna Taylor is trying to help. 

 That is just a great cat face -- sort of a movie star tough-guy face. And as regular visitors to Readlarrypowell.com know, we believe, base on personal experience, that the black and white&quot;tuxedo&quot;cat is gifted with a peculiar brand of&quot;feline zany.&quot;I swear. You can&apos;t underestimate the level of zany in these tuxedo cats -- loveable, charming, adorable zany. 

 This guy&apos;s name is&quot;Fathead,&quot;but, as Edna notes,&quot;names can be changed.&quot;He has a sibling named&quot;Itty Bitty&quot;(left) whose name reminds me of the one of the characters in a Greater Tuna play who comments on a neighborhood cat,&quot;Who in the hell would name a cat that big Itty Bitty?&quot; 

 At any rat, Fathead and his kind are in foster care right now where potential adoptors can be closely monitored, but Edna points out that if they&apos;re not adopted soon&quot;they will have to go live in a cage at PetsMart to be adopted out and I will not be able to screen potential adopters. ...   Could you imagine these little ones getting into the wrong hands? ... So, I am sending them around again and asking that someone PLEASE adopt one or two (or all) of these little tykes :) They come spayed/neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and ready to love. 

 &quot;They are sweet, friendly. social, playful, funny and KID FRIENDLY.&quot; 

 Travel arrangements can be made if you live outside of Houston and can demonstrate that you&apos;d be a good human for a kitten. To audition to adopt, e-mail tayloredna@msn.com or call 713-628-4052. 

 BELLE OF THE SHELTER: In Gainesville at the Noah&apos;s Ark shelter, there is a dog who is of the same mix as our big, sweet guy Hambone. Belle, pictured here, is a Great Dane/Lab mix. She&apos;s 2 years old and, according to Noah&apos;s Ark spokeswoman Debbie Lhotka,&quot;has the elegance and regal appearance of the Dane with the size and height of a large Lab.&quot; 

 If she&apos;s anything like our Hammy, you&apos;ll need to have a big chair or a couch ready for her when you get her home. 

 She has an old leg injury that has given her a&quot;bowed knee&quot;and she&apos;ll limp a little, but she&quot;runs, plays and romps around with no problems,&quot;Debbie&apos;s note says.&quot;She loves going for walks and just hanging out with a family.&quot; 

 To ask about adopting Belle, call 940-665-9800 or visit the shelter at 2501 Weaver in Gainesville. 

 CORSICANA LABRADOODLE. You can almost sing that to the tune of&quot;Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy.&quot; 

 Anyway we got notes from two of our Corsicana tipsters, Julie Maupin and Lynn Gatlin, about trying to help find a home for&quot;sweet Annabelle&quot;the Labradoodle. That, as you probably suspect, is a cross between a Labrador Retriever and a Poodle. 

 Annabelle is one of those dogs that has been caught up in the restructuring drama at the Corsicana Animal Shelter -- to keep the shelter operating, city hall has been helped by volunteers and the Humane Society of Navarro County. 

 According to the story of Annabelle, she had been adopted and was returned to the city shelter. She&apos;s been there more than a month. 

 Annabelle is a year old and very active and loved playing with kids in the back yard. But, a month ago, she nipped a kid in the yard. As Lynn writes,   &quot;While we don&apos;t know the circumstances, we have to honor what we&apos;ve been told. No matter whether we believe it or not.  &quot;Nonetheless, Annabelle can&apos;t be re-homed in our county. She must be relinquished to a rescue is the apparent rule at the moment. She was granted a reprieve and not PTS simply because she&apos;s a wonderful and happy dog.  

 &quot;In the meantime, Annabelle has been in the back of the shelter in her pen growing more and more anxious each day. She&apos;s beginning to pace and I don&apos;t blame her. It smells awful back there and she&apos;s all cooped up watching the other dogs come and go. It&apos;s just not fair.&quot; 

 Annabelle has passed a&quot;temperament test&quot;administered by an outside dog trainer, and Lynn says,&quot;I have literally been with this dog every single day for 3 weeks now and she&apos;s never offered to nip at me. Not even when we&apos;ve been out in the yard running and retrieving her toys and playing hard to tire her out. Not even in the middle of all that excitement has she ever been anything but sweet. High energy? Yes. Aggressive? No. It&apos;s a shame that one person can be allowed to seal the fate of a dog such as this.... 

 &quot;Each day that passes is another day that somebody is missing out on a great dog. If anyone can help or point me in the right direction, Annabelle and I will be forever grateful.&quot; 

 To offer to help Lynn save Annabelle, call her at 903-874-3722 or e-mail lynnsoldit@yahoo.com  or fosterfolks@projectpawz.com . 

 CONTEMPLATIONS: There are more good people than bad people. We just have to remind some of them that they are good enough to love a critter like family or even better. ... Still missing Elvis. ... Do you think more problems and disagreements would be settled if every meeting started with a fresh slice of pie?

 Heat, animals and humans... 
 
 Let&apos;s talk heat and animals today. I heard a weather report this morning that there is a&quot;cold front&quot;headed toward Dallas tomorrow that will drop the temp into the 90s. Momma, find the sweaters. 

 Now, here are our heat-related topics including a pair of roadside puppies. And Smiling Dog Farms has encountered a rough spot and needs help. Read on: 

 So, there I was on Wednesday under the assumption once again that everybody in the world wants to protect their animals from the harsh assault of extreme weather. 

 And, I got an e-mail from my pal Jonnie England, the Metroplex Animal Coalition&apos;s Director For Animal Advocacy and Communications. The headline was&quot;Protect Pets From High Heat And Hot Summer Sun.&quot;We&apos;ve mentioned this sort of thing already this summer but it never hurts to hammer home a point to people who aren&apos;t listening. (The complete list from Jonnie is below. Feel free to printout and save or distribute.) 

 About the same time Jonnie&apos;s e-mail arrived we got a letter from Brenda Bredemeyer. I followed up with a phone call because the subject line was very dire:&quot;Pictures of dying female rottweiller.&quot;That&apos;ll grab your attention.   Brenda and her family are very upset about what they perceive as a bad deal for a dog. 

 The rottie appears to be left mostly alone in a shadeless yard with a doghouse for shelter and food and water left out in the open for the sun to heat up to however hot the sun can heat water these days. Plenty hot, I guess. But there&apos;s more. 

 Brenda says her sister first reported this dog&apos;s situation to Mesquite Animal Control and the SPCA of Texas in June. Apparently the owner is meeting the basic minimum to avoid a cruelty charge. Brenda has filed a second report, she says. 

 Through the summer, the dog has continued to lose weight, Brenda says.&quot;A few weeks ago, my husband asked the owner,&apos;What is wrong with the dog?&apos; He said she has a degenerative muscle disease and it&apos;s fatal and she will only get worse. My husband asked him,&apos;What are you going to do with her?&apos;The owner said,&apos;I guess I&apos;ll have her put down.&apos;But he continues to do nothing. It&apos;s quite apparent the dog is getting no medical care which I know is the law and she continues to wither away. I doubt that she can see because of the condition of her eyes.&quot; 

 To be fair, Brenda says nobody knows if the dog has actually been to a vet or what the alleged disease might be. But Brenda has this question:&quot;Is there anything you can do to have this dog taken away from this owner?&quot;Call Brenda at 972-454-4169 or 214-774-4656. Or e-mail bbredemeyer1@yahoo.com or bbredeme@foxgal.com . 

 Maybe it is time for a second opinion. Maybe the dog&apos;s problems aren&apos;t fatal., And those infected eyes -- maybe that&apos;s entrophy, an easily solved eyelash problem. Maybe&quot;kill the dog&quot;isn&apos;t the only solution. 

 TWO ROADSIDE PUPPIES IN THE HEAT: Veteran rescuer Sherry Kunz sent a note this morning about something she&apos;d seen on the way to work.&quot;I was hoping you could put out an urgent request. There are 2 puppies sitting in the grassy area as you come off the ramp from I-30 to Loop 12 North. I was exiting Loop 12 going under the overpass and they are sleeping in that area to the right as you come off the I-30 East ramp. I called 311 but they won&apos;t respond quickly enough.&quot; 

 The puppies, she says,&quot;look like German shepherd about 2 months old . If anyone can go get them, I will help financially.&quot;For more details on these dogs e-mail  sherry.kunz@inwoodbank.com . 

 &quot;She says,&quot;I wish I could have stopped but there was really nowhere safe to stop. This is actually the second time I’ve seen a set of puppies in this general vicinity. Could be it has become a easy dumping ground. They probably throw them out the window as they are driving by.&quot;&apos; 

 A CRISIS AT SMILING DOG FARMS: Many people turned to Smiling Dog Farms in recent weeks for help with unwanted dogs. Now, it seems, there&apos;s been a run of bad luck at the sanctuary at Wharton. 

 Here&apos;s the list, according to a note from the sanctuary: 

 July 1, the well went dry and though a temporary fix was made, a new well is needed at the cost of $15,000. 

 July 3, the air-conditioner cratered . A temporary fix was made, but a big bill is coming to permanently fix the problem. The&quot;inside dogs&quot;are safe, but the situation is still iffy. 

 July 7, the Farm&apos;s pickup lost its transmission during a trip back from Arlington where personnel had picked up a load of donated dog crates. That&apos;s a $2,400 bill. 

 So, Smiling Dog Farms is trying to quickly raise $22,000 to handle those problems. Then, the sanctuary is looking for a thousand monthly&quot;donor-partners.&quot;And, of course, the sanctuary can always use adoptors. 

 To read more about Smiling Dog Farms go to www.smilingdogfarms.org . The mailing address: Smiling Dog Farms, P.O. Box 743, Wharton, TX 77488. 

 THE OLD GOLDEN AND THE PET WATCH: The Little Forest Hills Animal Alert folks are tending to a wandering older Golden girl. She was found&quot;barely walking&quot;on Whittier near San Leandro in the White Rock Lake neighborhood. 

 No collar, tags or microchip. And a&quot;fairly large tumor on her belly,&quot;we&apos;re told.   To claim this girl or to inform the Animal Alert folks about her story, call 214-930-5910. 

 And, LFHAA spokeswoman Maeleska Fletes reminds us that there is a&quot;Pet Watch Summit&quot;scheduled at 7 p.m. Tuesday, July 21, (the meet&apos;n&apos;greet starts at 6:30 p.m.) at the For The Love of The Lake office in Casa Linda Shopping Center, Garland at Buckner in Dallas. The purpose is to gather pet watch groups to swap info and to help other neighborhoods form pet watch groups. Pet watch groups can rescue the lost and save the wanderers. For more information, call 214-328-0508 or e-mail info@lfhanimalalert.org . 

 CONTEMPLATIONS: Would there be a Dallas if air-conditioning had not been invented? ... Guacamole chalupa -- the best light lunch in summer? ... Which is better in summer? Lemonade or limeade with a cherry?

 AND NOW, THE HEAT TIPS: Here is the list of anti-overheating tips we mentioned in the early part of this report: 

 GOOD RULES FOR THE HEAT: Returning to Jonnie&apos;s note about protecting animals fro the weather. Jonnie&apos;s opening quote is&quot;It may seem like dogs and cats tolerate the heat better than we can, but keep in mind that their normal body temperature is 101-102 degrees, and they’re wearing fur coats. The heat, humidity and hot summer sun can take a toll on our pets, causing heat stroke, dehydration, sunburn—yes, animals can get sunburned, too—and even death.” 

   And, seriously, you&apos;d think only a pinhead would need to be reminded of this stuff, but, I swear, every year aren&apos;t we amazed at what happens? 

 One of the tips is appropriate for the rotty&apos;s situation.&quot;Outside pets must have plenty of shade and fresh water at all times. A yard that’s partially shaded in the morning might not have any shade in the afternoon. Pets really should be inside where it’s cool during the heat of the day. 

             --Then there&apos;s&quot;Never leave pets unattended in a vehicle.&quot;   It gets too hot too fast these days and people steal animals. 

             --When traveling with your pet, bring fresh water (and a bowl).&quot;You never know when your car might overheat or break down and you and your pets will be stuck for a while.&quot; 

             --Don&apos;t take your dog for walks during the heat of the day. And avoid hot parking lots and paths so you don&apos;t burn the anima&apos;s paws. 

             -- Fill a kids&apos;wading pool with water so your dogs can cool off -- change the water daily, Jonnie suggestts. 

             -- Animals can get sunburn. but there is sunsceen designed for animals -- human sunscreen may contain ingredients that make animals sick. So can insect repellent -- make sure the product is animal safe. 

             -- Older and overweight animals don&apos;t mix well with high heat and humidity. And, Jonnie notes, the&quot;snub-nosed&quot;dogs -- bulldogs, pugs, Bostons, Lhasa Apsos, ShihTzus, etc. -- have a tougher time in these conditions and should be kept indoors except for potty breaks. 

             -- Shaving a dog&apos;s coat&quot;can help preent overheating, make flea and tick control easier and keep you dog cooleer,&quot;Jonnie says.&quot;But never have the coat shaved to the skin, which robs dogs of natural protection from the sun.&quot; 

             -- Importantly, she says, watch for heat distress symptoms such as excessive panting, drooling and mild weakness, elevated body temperature (and in cats open-mouth breathng.&quot;It&apos;s important to act quickly to save the animal.  Move the animal to a cooler area, apply ice packs or cold, wet towls to head neck and chest, give small amounts of cool water or ice cubes to lick, if outdoors spray gently with cool water (let the hose run a while), and, if there&apos;s no quick improvement, go to the vet immediately .

 Works of art and other tales... 
 
 It is the middle of July and we are as hot as the middle of August. 

 If any school kids are reading this, enjoy every day of the summer. You&apos;re building memories. The rest of us are just fighting the heat. 

 WORKS OF ART: How about those animal shelters? Give&apos;em all a break -- urban, suburban and&quot;out in the sticks,&quot;as the sophisticates say. All of these shelters have animals that need to be moving into homes. 

 Today we&apos;re going to spotlight Dallas Animal Services and we&apos;re going to do this under the heading of&quot;Works of Art.&quot; 

 For example, we have two cats today that are currently in the care of the DAS Adoption Center and they are, you can tell by looking, genuine works of art. 

 We go the tip on these cats from Jonnie England, Director For Animal Advocacy and Communications for the Metroplex Animal Coalition . 

 Epiphany (on the left) is an artist&apos;s dream, a sensation of colors and brush strokes in a&quot;dilute tortie&quot;coat. She&apos;s a former stray -- may be about 7 months old --   who has been available for adoption since April 23. That means she&apos;s on the clock at the ever-more crowded city shelter. 

 So is Maximus, who, in spite of that&quot;maximum&quot;appearance, weighs in at just 10 pounds. But isn&apos;t he a beaut? Looks almost like he&apos;s a Russian&quot;nesting doll.&quot;He&apos;s 3 years old and has been in the shelter since May. Why? His&quot;owners&quot;moved and&quot;couldn&apos;t take him with them.&quot;Lots of that going around these days. 

 Oh, that dog? Well, that&apos;s today&apos;s Earhound. Meg is a 3-month-old Shepherd-Doberman mix who weighs in at 25 pounds today, but, no doubt, will get larger. And those ears? Surely they can&apos;t get larger. She is a work of art, though, and it looks like she ought to have a cartoon bubble over her head with the word&quot;YIKES!&quot; 

 All of the animals -- and many, many, many more -- are at the Dallas Animal Services Adoption Center, 1818 N. Westmoreland at I-30, just a few minutes west of downtown Dallas. 

 As Jonnie reports, the cat&apos;s&quot;urgent&quot;list (animals on the fast clock) is&quot;unbelievably and frighteningly long. Babies, adults, short hairs, long hairs -- I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever seen so many beautiful and varied cats.&quot;(The dog list is as long and desperate, also.) 

 You can see more of the animals at www.DallasAnimalServices.com . 

 PYR CRISIS: Krista Mc Anally, the manager of the Humane Society of Cedar Creek Lake shelter in Tool, is looking for help with two Great Pyrenees seized over the weekend by Kaufman County authorities. 

 The two malnourished and poorly kept dogs were found with the body of a third.   

 Krista sent out a note seeking grooming help with the Pyrs and a volunteer from SPIN (Saving Pyrs In Need) responded. But there is need for more volunteer help with the dogs -- grooming, fostering adopting. Contact Krista at 903-432-3422 or email dogshsccl@yahoo.com . 

 THE MALLOY BRIDGE SITUATION: The notorious dog dumping ground near the Malloy Bridge in southeastern Dallas continues to acquire unwanted animals. These dogs are a couple of examples. 

 Our tipster Deborah Trevino reports that these two dogs are still living near the site where a puppy and a chained dog were recently rescued. 

 The brown dog, Deborah says, is&quot;pregnant again.&quot; 

 The male mostly black dog is&quot;shy, but has the potential to be a great family pet.&quot; 

 Heck, he may have been a great family pet at one time, but the family didn&apos;t turn out to be as great as the pet. 

 To offer to help try to charm these dogs into custody, e-mail dtrevino60@aol.com. 

 HAVE YOU SEEN THIS DOG? We&apos;ve mentioned this dog Jake a couple of times before but we haven&apos;t had a photo of him until now. Our friend, Ancil Jennings, who is a friend of the family that is looking for   Jake, sent this notice. It&apos;s being distributed to rescuers and animal fans in hopes of returning 10-year-old, 4-pound Jake to his family in New Boston, about 3 hours northeast of Dallas on I-30. He&apos;s a black poodle with a white splash on his chest&quot;and maybe a few gray hairs.&quot; 

 Jake, you may recall, vanished&quot;on the job&quot;on the night of May 30 when he was&quot;patrolling&quot;a property with his master -- as they have done without incident for many years. 

 Ancil&apos;s notice says,&quot;At the place he was last seen, there is a service station, a car lot and a service road to the freeway. We feel it likely that someone who saw him thought he was lost and so they picked him up. Actually, at that point, he was not lost. His adored master and his doggy playmates were all close at hand. He has a family who loves and misses him and Jake returns that affection, but the No. 1 person to him is his beloved master.&quot; 

 Jake was wearing a collar with ID tags and rabies tags when last seen. If you&apos;ve seen Jake or know his whereabouts, call 903-628-2116.   There&apos;s a reward for his return. 

 CONTEMPLATIONS: A lot of people I know make fun of my decision not to fly in commercial airliners. I don&apos;t know if any of those fun-makers were on that jet where the hole suddenly developed in the fuselage. ... I saw President Obama throw out the first pitch at the Major League All-Star Game last night. He&apos;s a lefthander who threw from the rubber and got the ball all the way to the plate and into the catcher&apos;s mitt. Probably no truth to the rumor that Texas Rangers Owner Tom Hicks tried to sign him for the second half of the season. ... Harry Potter &apos;s back in the movie theaters -- he&apos;s the only one who can afford the tickets.  Oh, I&apos;m kidding. Obviously a lot of kids went to see the move last night, using up big portions of their college funds and putting off buying a car or getting medical care in order to afford the ticket, a box of popcorn and a soft drink that costs more per gallon than gasoline in Europe.

 Maybe a fresh look... 
 
 Before we get into the more difficult things today, I want to take a moment to tell you about a chance encounter at a Red Bird-area auto repair shop in Dallas. 

 My fullychargedspouse Martha and I were there to get a new battery and tires for the   minivan. This particular day, though, it wasn&apos;t the bargain price on tires that was the highlight of the visit. 

 A young woman at the checkout counter had a baby carrier and we looked inside to see one of the most beautiful babies ever born on this planet. Such a tiny baby. Four pounds, Mom told us. A boy. His twin sister is still in the hospital, growing daily from her starting point of right at 2 pounds. Six pounds of babies. Both kids vibrant. Just tiny. 

 And such a beautiful face on that baby boy. Beautiful tiny hands. Wonderful jet black hair. Such a gentle vision. In a world sometimes too rough on people and animals, we had a few minutes away from the challenges. We saw a new mother&apos;s love . We saw a beautiful child. 

 Maybe we saw some hope for the future. Maybe I&apos;m just a sap for babies. But for a little while on a staggeringly hot day in Dallas, we felt the cool breeze of promise and grace . 

 Bless that Mom, she&apos;s going to have quite an adventure. 

 AN EARHOUND WHO IS A CAT: Yep, we&apos;ve selected Evander to be one of today&apos;s&quot;earhound&quot;and there&apos;s good reason. And, yes, he&apos;s named for the heavyweight boxer who famously had a chunk of his ear bitten off by opponent Mike Tyson. 

 Evander is a 4- or 5-year-old declawed fellow currently under the care of the folks at The Colony. Animal Control Division Manager Patricia Barrington says,&quot;We are told he was born minus half an ear. It&apos;s a very distinguishing trait and just adds to his overall worn, tattered, ragged, stuffed-animal-type personal. Evander is such a love. He never misses an opportunity to be petted and if he can’t find a willing hand, he’ll find a shelf, or a doorway and he’ll manage to pet himself. He’s super affectionate. To adopt this lovely boy, one simply needs to pay in advance at a vet clinic for his rabies shot and pay a $20 adoption fee; a heck of a deal for a friend of a lifetime.&quot; 

 To make arrangements to adopt Evander, e-mail pbarrington@thecolonytx.gov  or call 972-370-9250. 

 AN EARHOUND WHO IS A DOG: What are the chances that we&apos;d happen upon a dog with a missing ear the same day we&apos;re told about Evander? Never mind the odds on finding these animals, it&apos;s the long odds of getting them to safety that we ought to worry about. 

 Kahlua is one of the many animals in the Carrollton Animal Services shelter. He&apos;s #20030 and he&apos;s described as a shepherd mix who is&quot;missing his right ear flap.&quot;He&apos;s a medium-sized dog. And the scouting report reads,&quot;This gentle older fellow was found running stray. He is a friendly fellow who gets along very well with other dogs and loves to be with people. He is a very out-going dog and though he may be a bit older on the inside he still thinks he is a puppy.&quot; 

 To ask about Kahlua or any of the dogs and cats at Carrollton, 972-466-3420, or e-mail Joe.Skenesky@cityofcarrollton.com . 

 TWO FROM CAN: The Companion Animal Network     has a couple of dogs that have been rescued from shelter situations and, now that they&apos;re off death row, they need homes. 

 We get their information from CAN&apos;s Gail Whelan. 

 Dexter (left) is the Blue Heeler, under 2 years old and&quot;fully grown at 46 pounds.&quot;   He&apos;s in a   foster home right now, but that family already has two large dogs and&quot;to make matters worse,&quot;Gail says,&quot;the young woman is horribly allergic to sweet Dexter.&quot; 

 As is the nature of his breed, he has abundant energy and curiosity, Gail reports,&quot;but is also happy to lounge on his bed and while away some dog day afternoons.&quot;He knows basic commands, gets along with other dogs and people and is healthy, though he may have been abused in the past and is slow to warm to new people. 

 Also, Gail says, CAN has been disappointed by the lack of response to the dog Luckey. If nothing comes up soon, Luckey&quot;is headed for a shelter,&quot;she writes. 

 He&apos;s 18 months old, good with other animals and kids and healthy. He&apos;s just not finding a home. And if you are interested in either of these dogs, e-mail her at can_rescue@yahoo.com  or call 214-808-3238. 

 LITTLE TIME TO MOURN: On Sunday we ran an&quot;emergency&quot;listing for a dog named Pumpkin in the Denton Animal Services shelter and Pumpkin got no reprieve and was euthanized Monday morning. Afterward I was lamenting this awful occurrence with our tipster, rescuer Amy Pelzel, who is a volunteer at the shelter. 

 And Amy, who has the wisdom of experience, replied,&quot;It&apos;s always sad&quot;and then she noted that the shelter had&quot;like 30 new dogs!&quot;that morning. All of them face the same fate as Pumpkin if people don&apos;t respond. 

 Later in the day, Amy sent this note about the dog in the photo.&quot;We have the most amazing dog at the shelter now. She was found as a stray with one tiny puppy. Her puppy got adopted on Saturday. Gina, the mama, is left at the shelter and because of her recent&apos;childbirth look,&apos;everyone keeps passing her by. 

 &quot;Everyone at the shelter calls her my&apos;assistant&apos;because I let her out when I get there each day and she follows me EVERYWHERE with a sweet smile all over her face. She is simply amazing!&quot; 

 Gina is a Catahoula mix, probably 2 years old. 

 The rest of the story:&quot;Our Animal Control Officers went back to where they found the mama and the first puppy and we found the remaining ones in someone&apos;s fenced-in yard. We contacted the owners and they said they would find homes for the puppies but could not afford to take care of Gina anymore... 

 &quot;Please someone help with this one.. She only has until Thursday morning. She is by far the best dog at our shelter. She has NEVER shown any aggression and never even barked. She gets along with ALL of the other dogs at the shelter and simply LOVES people. If you know someone looking for a new loyal best friend, its Gina. Please let me know ASAP if you can help her! Ill pay half of the adoption fee on this one if someone wants to adopt her!&quot; 

 The u sual adoption fee is $120, as you can see at www.denton.petfinder.com . To ask about Gina, e-mail amy_pelzel@yahoo.com .  

 CONTEMPLATIONS: Is that a hint of Autumn in the air or is it an e-mail from the State Fair of Texas in my inbox? Ah, it&apos;s from the Fair, not that I wouldn&apos;t enjoy an autumnal breeze. The e-mail notes that the Creative Arts Competition Handbook is online at www.bigtex.com . Some of the deadlines are at 5 p.m. on July 31. The fair runs Sept. 25-Oct.18. ... My son Bart was driving home from work Monday evening when he glanced at a truck in the right lane next to him. The company logo&quot;Mister Glass&quot;was emblazoned on the side, but a bit of equipment was hanging down so that as the truck rolled down the road, the&quot;G&quot;and the&quot;l&quot;were covered up. You never have a camera when you need one. ... After I cough up whatever it&apos;ll take to see the next Harry Potter movie this week, I think I&apos;m going to retire from going to the movies. The prices have finally ticked me off. Lousy movies don&apos;t deserve a $9 or $9.50 ticket. It used to be that the price of the popcorn was an insult, but now, having seen some of these movies in which&quot;crude&quot;is mistaken for&quot;wit,&quot;I think the films are the biggest ripoffs in theaters. It pains me to write this. I love movie theaters. But, there is a limit.

 Ferris, Lola, horses and other topics 
 
 It&apos;s a Monday -- new challenges and old themes. 

 Too many animals in shelters and rescue groups, not enough adopters and foster homes. 

 Too much money in Lotto Texas and the wrong numbers on my ticket. Well, let&apos;s move on. Read on to learn about Ferris developments and today&apos;s&quot;Earhounds&quot;from the Humane Society of North Texas in Fort Worth. Yes, this Cowtown bunny is among today&apos;s Earhounds. 

 HELLO, FERRIS: We have no photos of dogs or cats to use with this item about the Ferris Animal Shelter controversy -- and that&apos;s a good thing. The animals were removed to safe surroundings last week. The Ferris animal shelter controversy continues this week -- it wasn&apos;t a&quot;one-day story.&quot; 

 We got an e-mail over the weekend regarding the animal shelter situation in Ferris. The animal control officer, Misty Clark , is looking for people to help her convince the Ferris City Council that euthanasia is not the only answer to moving animals out of the city shelter. 

 You may recall that last week she got an order from her boss to kill all the animals in the shelter rather than to try to adopt them or get rescue groups to claim them. (At Readlarrypowell.com we refer to this as the&quot;Texas Solution For An Animal Problem: Let&apos;s kill it.&quot;) 

 This morning I asked Misty about the adoption rate at the little shelter and she said she averaged moving 22 animals a month via adoption or rescue groups . What about the euthanasia rate ? She says she euthanized only the very sick or the aggressive -- averaged three a month , she said. 

 She says that back on July 7, she was called to her supervisors office, given a form called&quot;Expectations of Animal control Function City of Ferris&quot;and told that she should return to the shelter and euthanize all the animals. She refused to do that , instead contacting animal-rescue folks and the mass response saved all 26 animals. 

 In her weekend e-mail she wrote,&quot;I do not know why this decision has been made. I did put in writing to the Council and Mayor requesting a bathroom be put down at the shelter. I did this on June 5th, I would only hope this was not the reason for their decision. They have denied my request for a bathroom.&quot; 

 The City Council&apos;s next meeting is at 7 p.m. on July 20. Misty says,&quot;I would like to beg anyone and everyone to get o the agenda to speak at this meeting.&quot;You have to register with the city prior to noon on July 15. Call the city at 972-544-2110 or 972-842-5761. The mailing address is 100 Town Plaza, Ferris, 75125. Click HERE   to see the council member contact info. 

 Misty told me this morning that she&apos;s experiencing some blood pressure problems and her doctor has told her to take it easy for a few days. So, she&apos;s&quot;off the clock&quot;right now and says she&apos;s convinced that the city will terminate her. Still she is firm in her stance in favor of adoption and rescue. 

 In her weekend note, she also wrote,&quot;Euthanasia is a part of my job as an Animal Control Officer. Sad as that is, I do understand that some animals cannot be saved. Due to illness, injury, aggression or just the fact there is no more room in the shelter, animals must be euthanized. To date in the area of $10,000 in adoption fees have been received by the City of Ferris since I started this job. I would like to know how the euthanization of these animals would have been cost-effective for the City.&quot; 

 PUMPKIN&apos;S SAD FATE: On Sunday, Denton Animal Shelter volunteer Amy Pelzel sent a note asking us to try to help save Pumpkin, scheduled for an 8 a.m. euthanasia today. We quickly published her request and hoped that some good would come of it. We&apos;ve received word from Amy that Pumpkin, who was suffering from some sort of skin condition, did not make it. She was euthanized earlier today. We don&apos;t really know what to say about this -- Pumpkin is one of many animals meeting this fate today and each day in America&apos;s shelters. What is the solution? How do we make people care more? How do we influence the uncaring to be caring? And why should anyone care that a dog named Pumpkin died in a small shelter in North Texas? We should care because humans ought to leave a better legacy than killing -- animals and each other. 

 LOLA THE LOOKER: You wouldn&apos;t think such a beauty would be running free, but, oh, yes, this is Dallas and that happens all the time. Lola got lucky. She was running free in the Little Forest Hills neighborhood near White Rock Lake and that neighborhood&apos;s strays and foundlings are watched over by the Little Forest Hills Animal Alert . 

 Alert spokeswoman Maeleska Fletes says year-old Lola was&quot;covered in ticks&quot;when she was found. She&apos;s been given her shots, the ticks were all removed and she&apos;s available.&quot;She really, really wants to be around humans,&quot;Maeleska says.&quot;She gets along fine with other dogs and seems scared of cats. She is a bit shy and tends to duck if you make a move toward her too quickly. She has shown no aggression whatsoever.&quot; 

 Drawbacks: She can escape from chain link fences and she barks to be around people. To ask about adopting her, e-mail maeleska@maeleska.com  or call 214-766-3577. 

 AND IN FORT WORTH: The Humane Society of North Texas has been in the news lately for acquiring around 500 puppies from -- where else? -- a puppy mill. This has burdened the HSNT dramatically and the Metroplex Animal Coalition has stepped in to help find volunteers to deal with that many animals in their current quarters at an old slaughterhouse in the Fort Worth Stockyards. 

 In the meantime, business continues as usual at the Fort Worth shelter. And, today we have selected three animals for designation as&quot;Earhounds.&quot;The white rabbit is Snowball and the brown rabbit is Terex and you can see how to adopt them at www.hsnt.org . 

 The horse with the pointy ears? That equine earhound is Cookie, a 6-year-old Arabian mare who had been left in a pasture for two years to eat. She&apos;s also not trained for riding. So, she&apos;ll need a patient horseperson to teach her about the saddle and bridle. To adopt Cookie, it&apos;ll take a $150 donation to the HSNT. 

 She stands 14.2 hands -- I don&apos;t know how tall that is even though I&apos;m a native Texan and have fallen off horses. In my world, the height of a horse comes in three designations: need a ladder, don&apos;t need a ladder, need a doctor. 

 SPEAKING OF HORSES: Our national horse issue monitor, Jennifer Glick of Rowlett, sends word that Tuesday (July 14) is a day for horses in Washington. It&apos;s&quot; Horses On The Hill Day. &quot;   

 And it has nothing to do with any senate hearings. Nope this is a movement in support of an anti-cruelty bill for horses. Click HERE to read about it. If it becomes law, it would keep the horses safe from being transported and slaughtered for human consumption. Theoretically. No telling how many different ways Americans will have to say&quot;no&quot;before laws will finally stamp out the industry. 

 CONTEMPLATIONS: As a longtime print journalist I have seen the value of an editor at work, so that&apos;s why I try not to come down too hard on TV anchors who don&apos;t have an editor standing between them and stupidity . Still, a cable news channel anchor last week, reporting on the running of bulls at Pamplona, described a bull as being&quot;disoriented.&quot;  No, duh. How about we stage the Running of the Anchors down a street they&apos;ve never seen and let drunken nitwits run up and slap them or kick them and see if the anchors also suffer from disorientation?&quot;Where&apos;s my teleprompter?&quot;mooed the disoriented anchor. ... At least we know the Texas Rangers won&apos;t lose for four days in a row. Because of the All-Star Break and a quirk in the schedule, they don&apos;t play again until Friday. ... Good grief, humans, be kind to animals. Pass it on.
