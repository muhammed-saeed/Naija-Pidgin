 Wonderful Chicken Pomodoro. I will drive from Henry county to Nothing but Noodles for their chicken Pomodoro. I love it! I always have to order extra spinach in it though.

 Oodles of noodles. Nice variety of dishes in this hybrid - sit down fast food restaurant. I ordered the 1/2 salad and 1/2 bowl of noodles which was quite satisfying. They tend to overdo the sauces so you can ask for sauce on the side or lightened up.

The pad thai I ordered was good but again was a little too oily and over sauced. You have to pay extra for the meat here. …

 Great Food. I have been to this place a couple of times and I really like it. They serve Asian (Japanese, Thai and Chinese) food and some Italian stuff like pasta. There&apos;s a lot of choice, even for vegetarians. I really like their tomato bisque soup. The food quantity is also generous. Prices are very reasonable. …

 For pasta lovers. Nothing but noodles is quick, delicious, affordable order at the register, have food delivered to your table kind of restaurant. As the name suggests, noodles are featured. They have all types from Italian, Southwestern, Asian, American and even salads. They have a great lunch special of pasta or soup and choice of salad for $5.95. They have a huge selection and it&apos;s all made to order. Fresh, fast and hearty. Additions of chicken, tofu, beef or shrimp can be added to most anything. There&apos;s plenty of seating inside and out. This is one of my favorite lunch time spots. …
