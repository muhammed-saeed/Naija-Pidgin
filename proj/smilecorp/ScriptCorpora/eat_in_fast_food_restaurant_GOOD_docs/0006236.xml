 My favourite Turkish restaurant on Green Lanes 

 Advantages: Great food, quick, friendly service, inexpensive
 Disadvantages: Can be crowded and noisy on weekend nights


...INTRODUCTION 

Diyarbakir is a Turkish Restaurant on Green Lanes (A10), in the borough of Haringey, North London, a 7-8 minute walk from Manor House Tube station and practically seconds away from Harringay Green Lanes rail entrance. Undoubtedly, the densest Turkish restaurant population in London, if not, the whole planet, including Istanbul itself. I moved to this area in 2005 and my decision was mainly down to the great value restauration and the Mediterranean (Turkish - Cypriot - Greek - Middles Eastern) groceries having grown up on the stuff.

 THE RESTAURANT 

You can spot the trays of lovely, colourful daily stews from the street as they are displayed in the window. As you enter, the long chilled counter is on your left with a huge menu board overhead. The decor is simple, now repainted a warm yellow and red. Unlike...

Review of Diyarbakir Turkish Restaurant , London 
 
 See, there ARE some green places in Birmingham! 

 Advantages: Fabulous plants from everywhere, gorgeous relaxing picnic garden, brilliant staff
 Disadvantages: The tropical house isn&apos;t suitable for asthmatics!


...If you?re hunting for somewhere to spend a summer?s day in the West Midlands, that both you and the kids will enjoy, look no further than Birmingham Botanical Gardens. 

Opened back in 1832, this was originally a place for the gentile folk of Edgbaston to soak up the sun and see some green places during a time when both industrial and family housing seemed to be taking over what was once a lush area. According to staff at the Botanical Gardens, it?s pretty much the same in 2006 as it was then. The proprietors of the nineteenth century gardens made it their life long work to source as many exotic and semi-exotic plants as possible, leaving us 170 odd years later with a glorious historical collection of ?New World? species; many of which date back to the 1500?s. 

The gardens are spread over 15 acres, this seems like a huge area to visit...

Review of Birmingham Botanical Gardens, Edgbaston, Birmingham 
 
 Easily the best asian restaurant in Birmingham 

 Advantages: Close to the city centre. Excellent varied and interesting menu.
 Disadvantages: A little bit pricey for some, but you get what you pay for!


...Having watched Lasan with Gordan Ramsey&apos;s F-Word restaurant of the year award in 2009, I leapt at the opportunity to go to try out the wonderful food.

Three friends and I decided we&apos;d go during the week. The website allows you to book online and a prompt email came back confirming our table.

The area of St Paul Square (around the corner) is really cool and there are several nice bars to whet our appetite beforehand!

We were a little early for our table, but there is a really nice waiting area with a bar to keep us occupied. The service generally was first class - not in your face. You almost don&apos;t notice them, which is how it should be.

The menu offers some really unusual but fantastic dishes - so don&apos;t expect Chickin Tikka Masalla! A wonderful veal dish for main finished off a lovely evening. Great relaxed atmosphere in...
