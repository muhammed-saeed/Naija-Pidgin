I had an ample supply of chicken quesadillas, and they were delicious!

From the entrees, you can choose from sirloin steak, chicken fried steak, fried shrimp, grilled chicken breast, grilled catfish, and meat loaf. Side dishes cost $1.49 each, and you may choose from 16 items.

Hot rolls were immediately served, and our order was ready within 20 minutes after ordering. I enjoyed the black eyed peas and garlic mashed potatoes.

There was not much to choose from for dessert, but after trying to eat all the food placed before me, I did not really need dessert. The Cotton Patch specializes in fresh products. Although prices seem a little high, you are given large portions, and we took doggy bag home since we both could not finish everything we ordered.

The manager was present the entire time, as she went from table to table, greeting customers. An enjoyable dining experience!

Also on the menu for about the same price are a shrimp basket and oyster basket. Shrimpers seems to be primarily a seafood restaurant, but also on the menu are some Mexican dishes, such as faijtas and salads. Prices vary from as low as $4.95 for hamburger to $20 for large oyster and shrimp plates.

The booths are comfortable, and there is boat and some fish placed at intervals on the walls to give atmosphere. However, if you are looking for romantic and gourmet-type dining, then this is not the place. Management has the radio playing a little too loud for my liking, but, overall, you will leave here with good dining experience. I recommend this restaurant because I like the service and the food.

Non-burrito items available are quesadillas, tacos, and nachos. All of these are available in steak, chicken, or veggie, and prices range from $5.25 to 6.25.
I ordered the 1/2 Bird Burrito with Diet Pepsi, and the total cost was $6.75.
You can also order online and check the menu at www.freebirds.com.

Also offered is a 1 1/2-pound Monster Burrito, which I did not try. There is also small area with table for outdoor dining, and take-out is available. Severs are friendly and hard-working and willing to please customers.

The restaurant has metal tables and no booths. There is bar and a patio outside in an area where you can enjoy your meal.

What sets this apart from other local seafood restaurants is the wide variety of seafood items available on the menu: stuffed flounder; grilled, baked, or fried tilapia; oysters; scallops; crawfish tails; shrimp; and fried catfish are listed on the menu. Also available are tuna steak and Pacific rockfish, and if you want something other than seafood, you can order a 12-ounce rib-eye steak for $16.79 or a cheeseburger for $7.75. They are open 7 days a week, and from 11am until 4pm, you can order their fried seafood baskets, which range in price from $6.25 to $10.95.


I ordered the fried tilapia with onion rings, fries, and two hush puppies. I did not care for the hush puppies, but the onion tings were large and delicious. The French fries were tasty, with a touch of spice, and the two tilapia were excellent, as was the red and tartar sauces served with them.


The servers are friendly and my waiter filled my tea twice without me asking.


I ordered the house salad for $2.99, and the tartar and red sauces were served with it. I asked the waiter if they had Thousand Island, and he replied that the closest thing to it is the Remoulade dressing. Remoulade is like a souped-up Thousand Island with more spice and flavor. I actually liked it better than Thousand Island. Other salads on the menu included salmon Caesar, Carmen&apos;s crab/avocado, and Cancun shrimp, with prices ranging from $2.99 to $8.79.


From I-30, take University Drive south. You will pass Berry Street, and shortly after, you will see the large Ocean Rock Sign on Bluebonnet Circle.



They have 19 beers on tap, plus bottled beer and a variety of red and white wines. There is KID’S MENU for those 10 and under, ranging from $3.99 for a grilled cheese sandwich to $5.49 for a shrimp basket. Side orders of baked potato, fried okra, onion rings, white rice, coleslaw, black beans, and cottage cheese range form $1.50 to $3. Other interesting items on the menu are the San Juan crab burger, fish tacos, and &quot;shrimpchilidas.&quot;

 Quote: I ordered a steak sandwich and dinner salad with 1000 Island. The steak was large but not very tasty. It was not especially tender either. It was served on bun, and you could add condiments as you liked. The salad was okay, but what they called 1000 Island dressing did not taste like 1000 Island. It was more like Italian, and not very good at that.
The restaurant offers hot and cold subs, ranging from turkey and cheese to meatball parmigiana and chicken parmigiana. Various burgers, sandwiches and soups are also on the menu.

Pizza, calzone, garlic bread, spinach roll, and lasagna are also some of the menu items found here. I was disappointed in the food I ordered, so maybe the Italian selections are better.

This restaurant is not located in the best part of town. There are homeless people who frequent this area, and it is near Hemphill Street, which has reputation for being dangerous area. If you must try this place, go in the daytime. There is parking in the street where you can walk right in.

My favorite is the rasberry cheesecake with white chocolate--cheesecake topped with slivers of white chocolate.

The employees are friendly and courteous, and the service is fast.

With the wide choice of menu items and delicious foods, the Olive Garden is one of my favorite places to eat. You can also call ahead for orders to go, and they are usually ready for pick-up within 15 minutes.
