 Are you a Tigger or an Eeyore? March 9, 2012, 12:15 pm
Filed under: Uncategorized 
For my 40 th birthday, my drop-dead gorgeous wife bought me a round-trip ticket to Hawaii. This trip was not for the four of us. It was only for me, alone for nearly three weeks.

Most people could not understand why or how we she could send me anywhere by myself, and especially not to Hawaii, of all places.  That is all right with us. You see, most people would not understand it if we told them. Maybe the following video can shed some light on the subject. Seeing Dr. Randy Pausch’s “ The Last Lecture ” has changed me as a person. The original lecture given at Carnegie Melon University is over an hour long. I will post it on our idso2.com Facebook page . For now, I found a revised version which Dr. Pausch gave on The Oprah Winfrey Show.

 

I was 12 years old when I first rode a bodyboard. I was at Huntington State Beach with my friend and his mom. I was riding an orange Aussie at Brookhurst Street, with no fins.

Later that same summer, my parents took me to Oahu for the first time. They set me up with a board bag, Churchill fins, and a Morey Boogie Mach 7-7. I rode Sandy Beach for the first time and got worked! I pearled on a five-foot wave while going straight. I “taco’ed” the board when the nose hit bottom, leaving a giant crease down the middle. Back then I did not even know how dangerous a surf break Sandy’s was. I got the wind knocked out of me, but I survived. I was hooked!

When we returned to the mainland, I wanted to go to the beach everyday. I found out that I could take the #37 bus straight down Euclid Avenue to Huntington Pier. Most days you could find my friends and I, going for a dawn patrol, packed into the rear of the OCTD bus. It was always dark, so we usually slept all the way to the end of the line.

 

I can remember the first time I saw the Morey Pipeline Contest on television. Watching these guys riding huge waves and being paid was the coolest thing ever. After that contest, I taught myself how to set the recorder on the VCR so that I could be ready for the next contest. I recorded it every year following. I was stoked and inspired.

Growing up in Orange County made it easy for me to make friends and meet other people that bodyboard. Back then we were always broke. We learned how to barter at an early age. Friends of friends would lend out their bodyboarding videos and my friend would make copies. We would often times trade magazines for videos or stickers for posters. Then we really got into surfing when a local surf shop started renting out there surf vids.

I have been lucky enough to visit the Hawaiian Islands many times. I have been to Oahu on summer vacations with my family, typically  in Waikiki.

This would be a first. This trip was different. This trip was strictly a surfari. No kids. No resorts. I have always wanted to go to the North Shore, in the winter, and watch the Pipeline bodyboarding contest. It was a childhood dream that I thought I had given up once we decided to raise a family.

My wife would not let me. It would not be easy. This was the first time I have ever left my family for a significant period. I had to do this. I had to seize this moment.

Two years ago, I would not have been in shape enough to go on this trip. Two years ago, I was not healthy enough to consider going.

For my 40 th birthday my wife gave me something that money cant buy. She trusted me enough to give me the opportunity to fulfill a childhood dream. She loved me enough to give me the space to pursue the chance of a lifetime. I have recently learned that one should never give up a childhood dream no matter how old he may be.

 

My name is Michael and I am an idso2. I am making a lifestyle change. With my family’s support, I checked off something from my “bucket list”, this month. I don’t just love my best friend. I am in love with her. For my birthday this year, she gave me the opportunity of a lifetime that I will never forget! Dear Lord, thank you for my life and this awesome opportunity. In this lifetime, my family and I are definitely a clan of Tiggers! Thank you for your support.

 A Yearning for More Balance February 10, 2012, 12:34 am
Filed under: Uncategorized 
 

My wife has always maintained a belief that there are two things we should never skimp on: doctors and food. I have finally listened to her wisdom. We try to apply this philosophy in our daily lives. We have made maintaining good health our top priority. With that said, we have had to make certain financial adjustments. 

We have had to eliminate things from our budget in order to afford a PPO health plan. In order for us to get healthy, it was vital for us to be able to choose our own doctor.

We have been taking steps towards eliminating meat and dairy from our diets. Presently, we have been making steps towards eliminating gluten, as well as processed sugars from our diet. We have made steps towards eliminating food items in the house that contain colored dyes or artificial sweeteners. We threw out the aluminum pots and pans and bought stainless steel.

We stopped eating fast food. We have had to limit our spending in certain areas, such as entertainment, in order to keep a constant supply of vitamins and supplements as well as fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, raw nuts and seeds, and legumes in the pantry. 

We do not go out to eat as much as we used to. We do not go to the mall as much either. We make sacrifices, together as a family, to be able to keep our gym memberships. Each member of our family has had to sacrifice having certain material things in order for us to continue home schooling our children.

These are just a few examples of the “baby steps” we have taken. As a whole, our family is eating cleaner than we ever have. We have had to clean out our pantry and our refrigerator of junk foods and anything processed. We have come a long way in the past two years. The change has been a steady process that cannot just happen overnight. 

People have tried to encourage me to go on The Biggest Loser on NBC. In the past, people have encouraged me to get the LAP-BAND surgery. I am not looking for a quick fix. I do not want a short cut.

I refuse to leave my family for 12 weeks to live on “The Ranch”. In the past, I missed out on too many things when I was a workaholic.  My children need to witness my transformation. I want my family to see me when I am crying, as well as when I am laughing.

There is nothing more liberating than the feeling I get when the four of us exit the gym together after our workout; each of us smiling ear to ear, single file, sweat dripping, ipods blasting. By working together, we all achieve more. My wife and kids are my support system.

The gym has been going through major remodeling. I have had to come up with alternative ways to get my workouts in. During the past months, my family and I started going on bike rides together. One afternoon, the four of us rode to Huntington Cliffs. This is a 13-mile ride, roundtrip! 

I turned 40 a couple of days ago. I feel like I can do anything. I feel empowered. Working out and eating healthy has helped me gain more balance in my life. I feel like I am in my twenties, just wiser.

For the first time in my life, I feel like I am on my way to becoming the man that I have always wanted to be. For the first time in my life, I feel like my wife and I are becoming the parents we have always wanted to be. This is the closest I have ever felt to my wife and kids, in our 11 years of marriage.

Dr. Stone once told me that a father’s job is to be himself, so that his son can decide what to keep or throw away. For the first time in my life, I do not feel like I have to pretend to be something I am not. For the first time in my life, I am home enough for my children to see who their father really is. For the first time in my life, I have an appreciation for life. 

My name is Michael and I am an idso2. I am making a lifestyle change. I began this journey just wanting to be skinny. Ironically, today I find myself yearning to acquire more balance in my life. Thank you for your support.

 An Introspective Look Back On 2011(Part 2) December 23, 2011, 5:40 am
Filed under: Uncategorized 
 

There comes a time in everyone’s life where we have to face change . At first you refuse to face it, you might even deny it . You might be able to forget about it , for a short while. Maybe it starts out as something you turn over in your mind while taking a shower. Suddenly you see the clock in your peripheral vision and realize that you are late! Whoosh! It is forgotten for months. 

The next time it gets harder to ignore. You can feel it . Suddenly, you are not the only one that notices that you are miserable. Other people in your life begin to feel that you are troubled. They might even offer to help you with it . Inside of you, unspoken, you know that only you can really change it .

I came to that point with myself again. There was no denying it. Nevertheless, what was it? My it, is obesity, the morbid kind. Two years ago, I decided to change all that!

I could not do another diet. I could not do surgery. I knew I wanted this weight to be gone for good. I wanted to be happy again. This year I committed to changing my lifestyle for the rest of my life.

Today, the scale can show you that I am physically 75 pounds lighter. However, only the smile on my face and the tears in my eyes can show you that I am a thousand times lighter in the mind. 

During this past year, I spent a majority of my free time checking out different kinds of LCP . LCP is what I jokingly call Lifestyle-change Pornography. I am not talking about the first time you found your dad’s collection of old Playboy magazines in the garage. 
 
 

I am talking about something that inspires me to make a change. LCP empowers me. LCP reminds me why I want to get up and go to the gym at 6 a.m. It is anything that helps me identify it .

It can be that Master of Puppets song by Metallica, when I am in the weight-room. It could be an article about the health benefits of apple cider vinegar. It can be an article in a magazine at the dentist’s office. It can be almost anything. It can be almost anywhere. There you have it. LCP = Lifestyle-change Porn!

This year I found some hardcore LCP . I found shows like The Biggest Loser and Oprah’s Lifeclass. 

 Kitchen Nightmares, with Gordon Ramsey is one of my favorites. The people are forced to look at themselves. At first, they do not like what they see. By the end of the episode, Chef Ramsey has empowered the entire staff to keep working hard long after he has left.

 The Biggest Loser on NBC is another example of LCP . It is impossible not to feel inspiration after watching the season 12 finale. John Rhodes’ loss of 220 pounds brought my entire family to tears.

This year, Oprah Winfrey became one of my all time favorite LCP stars. Oprah’s Lifeclass television series defines exactly what I mean by LCP . This series touched my soul. It has changed the futures of my future grandchildren.

The lessons, taught in the Lifeclass, helped me go deeper than ever in my soul-searching. These lessons forced me to look into the reasons why I was unhappy. These lessons helped me recognize what things I needed to eliminate in my life in order to make lasting change. This year I started recognizing how my ego gets in my way. 

This year I eliminated certain relationships. I recognized that I could not have people in my life that constantly brought negative energy.

This year I broke the family chain of holding grudges. I learned this self-destructive behavior from my father. There was a point in my life where we did not speak for 13 years. This year I forgave him in order to free myself. It takes courage to work through the process of letting go of anger. I will continue working on this.

I had not had contact with my daughter in quite some time. During an intense argument, regretfully, I told my daughter that she should take the GED test and get a job. She walked out of the house and did not come back.

This year my wife and I vowed to have more of what we love in our life. This year I finally came to my senses.

This year I apologized to my daughter. For the first time, I was not afraid to admit to her that I had made a mistake and that I was wrong.  This Thanksgiving was the first holiday that the four of us have shared together in almost two years. We have a lot to be thankful for this Christmas! 

In 2011, our family, made a commitment to change our lifestyle! Together as a family, we have chosen to make good health a priority. We strive to make “baby-steps” each day towards improving our health. Wellness has become a sparkling beacon in the darkness of the fear of change.

My name is Michael and I am an idso2. I am engrossed in my children’s lives. I am a good father. I am a good husband. I am a good person. I am making a lifestyle change. I cannot do it alone. After spending some time being introspective this year, I was able to recognize parts of my self-destructive behavior. This Christmas I am proud to say, “I did something about it!” Thank you for your support.

 An Introspective Look Back On 2011 (Part 1) December 20, 2011, 9:25 am
Filed under: Uncategorized | Tags: belief today , core belief , history of diabetes , material possession , thinking about things , winter recess 
 

My wife says I always get “funky” around this time of year. In the past, I used to take that comment negatively. I do not anymore. This year I started recognizing how my ego gets in my way. I know what she is really trying to say.

Christmas is five days away. I enjoy spending time alone during this time of year. I always have. I usually have a countless number of things going around in my head during the holidays. Don’t we all? Sometimes being alone helps me sort those things out.

 

I guess it begins when I start thinking about my gift list. Every year I try to find a nice, quiet place to be alone. I start writing down the names of people I want to thank.

As I wrote that line, I realized that for all these years I have held a core belief that in order to show gratitude, I have to give someone material possession. It cannot be just anything. It must be something of value. It is a relief knowing that I do not hold value to that core belief today.

As I start to think about the people in my life that I want to add to my list, I inevitably begin reflecting on the quality of my life. I inevitably begin thinking about things I want to change in my life. Christmas is not just a time for celebrating.

It is also a time for me to reflect on my quality of life.  Winter recess has always been a time that I manage to slow down and find time to meditate and contemplate about the quality of my life, at that exact moment in time.

As I look back on 2011, I realize how many things have changed in my life. For you to truly appreciate where I stand today, you must know and understand from where it was that I began.

I have been a member of my gym for 5 years now. During the first three years, the only time I went to the gym was to sign up and give them my credit card number. 

I grew up in a home that did not follow good health practices. I have inherited a history of diabetes and various forms of cancer from my mother’s side of the family. I have inherited a history of heart disease and high-anxiety from my father’s side of the family. My grandfather and my father have both had open-heart surgery. My father had his first heart attack at the age of 32.

I have carried on the Rosenberg family tradition of poor health. There was a time in my life where dinner after work meant putting four cups of white Jasmine rice into the rice cooker, just before heading over to the Colonel’s for a 12 piece bucket of his original recipe. Did I mention I needed to make a quick stop into Sav-on to get some more cigarettes and Coke-a-cola? That can pretty much summarize my workout routine throughout my 20’s and early 30’s. 

On New Year’s Eve 2010, I made a promise to myself that I would change my lifestyle. In less than 12 days, I will have completed my second year of keeping that promise. In retrospect, I had no clue as to the amount of hard work it would take to keep that promise.

Today I go to the gym 6 days a week. I walk 3.5 miles a day. In addition to my cardio, I have recently added weight-training to my workout two days a week. I have cleared out the fridge and pantry of almost everything evil . To date I have dropped 75 pounds. That is just the physical work that I have done. Next post we discuss the spiritual and emotional work I have done this year.

My name is Michael and I am an idso2. I am engrossed in my children’s lives. I am a good father. I am a good husband. I am a good person. I am making a lifestyle change. I cannot do it alone. After spending some time being introspective this year, I was able to recognize parts of my self-destructive behavior. This Christmas I am proud to say, “I did something about it!” Thank you for your support.

 What Is Eating Me? October 29, 2011, 3:46 pm
Filed under: Uncategorized 
This journey has been less about what I am eating, and more about what has been eating me. I have recently realized that I equated food with love. I learned at an early age that you could show someone you love them, by feeding them. The bigger the meal, the deeper the affection you showed to your beloved. 

I could use food to show a dear regard of friendship. In our neighborhood, we often heard parents say, “Great job at school today, let’s go out for ice cream.” After a dramatic victory on the soccer battlefield, I have often said, “Hey, let’s all go out for pizza, my treat!”

Cooking “Mi Vida” a four-course, candlelight dinner for two can show a passionate lust or infatuation. For the love of my life, I might whip up a picnic lunch on the beach. Start with Hawaiian bread and creamy Havarti accompanied by a glass of Chamay. Even Casanova knows you have to have crème brulee bread pudding for dessert.

My relationship with my father has had its difficulties, to say the least. He was not a great parent. My dad was a good provider. He was gone most of the time. When my father came home from work, in a good mood, he would say, “Let’s go out to dinner and pig out!”

Some things have recently happened in my personal life that has allowed me to see my father through the eyes of an adult. In the past, I have looked at him through the eyes of a teenage child. Now I see him man to man, if you will.

Through months of soul-searching, I have realized that I had developed his poor eating habits. I realized that I had developed his body type and shape. I realized that I was not being true to myself.

My father shared bonding time with me during meals, across the dining table at any given restaurant. His idea of quality time, when there was quality time, was devouring an extra large pizza together.

I now believe that I smoked cigarettes all those years because I subconsciously thought it would help me understand him more. I was a heavy smoker for about 10 years. The more I disliked him, it seemed the more I became him. I would eventually prove that I could eat more than him. I would eventually prove that I was bigger than him. 

I have spent a majority of my life trying to get my father’s attention. I have spent a majority of my life trying to understand who he is. Now that those questions are answered, I know what I am not. By knowing more about what I am not, I know more about who I am.

Sometimes I cannot believe how much I have changed during the past two years. I enjoy exercising. I enjoy playing sports. I enjoy taking care of my body physically as well as mentally. I do not need to eat food to bond with my family. I do not need to use food to show my family that I love them. I will even admit I have recently become an Oprah Winfrey fan. Crazy, huh?

I began this journey 22 months ago. In the past, I used food to gain a false sense of power. In the past, I used food to hide my insecurities and weaknesses. Today, I am almost 40-years-old and I am starting to see a completely new me. My name is Michael and I am an idso2. I am making a lifestyle change. I am facing the things that are eating me. I want to rule my destiny.  I thank you for your support.

 Can I Be Anymore Tortoise Like? September 23, 2011, 7:54 pm
Filed under: Uncategorized | Tags: child rearing , education , elementary school teaching , inspiration , married with children , mr. mom , obesity , parenting , spirituality , stay-at-home-dad , weight loss 
 

Two years ago, I could pack my family into the car and drive 2 hours during rush-hour traffic to find some “hole in the wall” restaurant I read about in the The OC Register or saw on television . 

Back then, I would skip breakfast most days. I usually ingested a big lunch at one of the greasy spoons close to work. Next, I would go out to dinner with the family and devour a gigantic dinner. Evening meals always started with some sort of deep fried appetizer and concluded with a sinful dessert. Eventually I would get home and pass out due to the combined effects of food coma and complete emotional exhaustion warranted from dealing with a class of 36 fifth graders all day.

Two years ago, I wanted to be the best ! All I wanted was to climb the “Corporate Ladder”. I had it all planned.  First, I would teach for a few years and get tenured. Next, I would get my administrative credential and become a vice principal. I could learn the ropes and eventually become the principal. After spending a few years in administration, I could run for a position on the local School Board and make my way into politics!

I remember thinking that I could take out more student loans and as a result, put my family deeper into debt. We only owe $45,000 after consolidating my loans for undergrad and graduate work. Another $15,000 to be NCLB (No Child Left Behind) compliant is just a drop in the bucket! I know this can work! 

Two years ago, I wanted my children to go to the best private schools and have the best teachers so that they could get into the best colleges. Then they could get the best jobs and be the best at whatever they wanted to be. I did not care what the kids wanted to be, just as long as they were the best !

Today, I am just trying to be good . I am learning that good enough should be good enough. I am learning that if good enough is not enough for someone, then that is their problem and not mine. I cannot continue going through life trying to please others. I am learning not to give everything I have to others. I am learning to save fuel in the tank for myself. I am learning to enjoy time for myself even if it is only an hour a day.

I know what it is to live life being constantly late all the time. You wake up too late to go to the gym, you are late to work, late to the faculty meeting, late getting home from work, arriving late to soccer practice, late for dinner, and too late to make love tonight. You feel like your life is a race. Most days you feel like you are losing the race. Eventually, you begin to feel like your life is a race to nowhere. 

That lifestyle is in the past. Today, I am trying to keep the number of times we eat out to a minimum. In general, eating out just is not as healthy as eating at home. In addition, it is too expensive. These days a healthy dinner for three, plus drinks and tip is hard to find for under $30. I could take my family out for fast food and have them order from the dollar menu. However, that would be defeating the purpose of eating.

Today, I am learning to think of food as fuel. I am learning to put things in my body for two reasons. I am learning to choose things that either nourish my body or help heal it. I am learning not to make my food choices based solely on whether it tastes good. 

Mrs. Young was my sixth grade teacher at James Madison Elementary. I asked her to sign my yearbook. It was the last day of school and my mom was there with me. Mrs. Young signed my yearbook and cried when my mom thanked her for being my teacher. She wrote “Go for the best, don’t settle for less!” My mother never let me forget that day. I have an echo in the back of my head with my mom saying, “Remember what Mrs. Young said. Go for the best, Michael!”

Today, I am learning that I do not have to be an “over-achiever”. I am trying to slow down the pace. I am learning that less is more. I am learning to develop coping skills that do not involve eating. I am learning to find more balance in my life. I am learning to recognize “triggers” that cause anxiety in my life.

Today, I am home-schooling my son. This will be our second year. I am learning not to pressure my children to be the best . I am less concerned about their future and more concerned about their present. Today, I am more concerned about their social and emotional development. I just want them to be happy.

Two years ago, I weighed close to 400 pounds. I began this journey to change my lifestyle a little over 21 months ago. Since then, I have lost one-half inch in my neck and seven inches from my hips. I have lost seven inches from my chest and eight and one-half inches from my waist. My hat size is three-quarters of an inch smaller. In 21 months, I have literally lost weight from my head to my toes. I used to buy size 13 shoes because I needed the extra width. Today, my running shoes are size 11!

My name is Michael and I am an idso2. I am making a life-style change and it is not easy. I pictured myself being further along when I began this journey almost two years ago. This morning I weighed in at 320 pounds. I have lost a total of 75 pounds. Today I walked 3.30 miles in 60 minutes. I have stopped telling people that I work well under pressure. Keeping balance is key.
In this high-speed race to nowhere that we live in, I want to be less like the hare and more like the tortoise.  Thank you for your support.

 Dropped the Guilt, Dropped the Baggage, and Dropped the Weight December 3, 2010, 12:32 pm
Filed under: Uncategorized 
 

I began my transformation last New Year’s Eve. While the glasses of champagne were being passed around the room and handfuls of confetti were being flung into the air, I had no idea of how much self-awareness this journey would require. That night, however, I was certain of two things: I was slowly killing myself and I was committed to stop it.

Last January I made a promise to myself to change the destructive way I had been living my life. I have been working extremely hard at fulfilling that promise during this past year. I hope that you, the reader, may learn from my many trials and tribulations.

I began this journey at 395 pounds. I weighed in this morning at 339 pounds. Today is a great day for me because I had been teetering between 352-347 pounds for close to 4 months. I increased my workouts and made changes to my diet several times but I just could not get to that 50-pound mark. I had often heard of people hitting a “plateau” when dieting. Nevertheless, experiencing it first hand is exasperating to say the least.

One of the most important things I have learned this past year is to drop the guilt. I was feeling guilty for wanting to go work out. I found myself feeling guilty for leaving the dirty dishes in the sink or the large pile of dirty laundry in the garage behind, as I left to go exercise for 2-3 hours. I found myself feeling guilty when I was too tired to go to a friend’s birthday party or wedding. I needed to rest during the weekends and let my body recover.

In addition, I found myself feeling guilty that I was exercising while my wife went to work. I truly felt shame for getting healthy. There was an inner struggle that I was not providing for my family, because I wasn’t bringing home a paycheck. But on the other hand, I knew I was showing signs of pre-diabetes and it could only get worse.

It took time for me to realize that I was feeling pressure from societal and cultural values. Doesn’t our society value man as the sole provider and woman as the homemaker? I had to look inside of myself and decide if these were my own beliefs and values. I had to decide if I wanted to teach these values to my children.

As a result, I had to drop the guilt and accept that there are times when it is acceptable to be selfish. If taking care of my health and choosing to lead by example for my wife and children is considered a selfish act by others, so be it. The more wrapped up in myself and self-serving I become, the better. I have to be true to myself and believe that my true friends and family will understand that what I am doing is just. 

Another important lesson I learned about myself this past year is that my obesity has more to do with my emotions than my calorie intake. I had several hang ups regarding my relationships with family members and friends.It is like a scene from a Harry Potter movie. I am not sure what happens but the minute I walked into my parents’ house I magically turned back into the teenager I once was when I lived there. I could not say no. I could not be me. I learned my eating habits from my parents. They learned certain recipes and food combinations from their parents and were now passing them down to my children.

 In my opinion, the main culprits of diabetes in an Asian household is some sort of fried meat, served along side a mountainous serving of steamed white rice. Oh yeah, and hold the vegetables.

I had to come to a point where I stopped acting like a child when I walked into my parent’s house. They needed to see me as an adult and a parent, but more importantly, I had to see myself that way before they could. The more I started acting like the man I see myself as, the more I was treated as such. Breaking chains in any family is difficult but it can be done. This type of change takes time and is still a work in progress. Taking baby-steps is key.

I began to realize that I was carrying a lot of emotional baggage from my childhood and it was time to leave it behind. As I began doing the work to resolve these issues, I became more confident and focused.

My workouts felt better. My body and mind felt like they were working together. My mind is not wondering off during my workouts. I have found new focus.

My name is Michael and I am an idso2. I am making a life-style change and it isn’t easy. I pictured myself being further along when I began this journey a year ago. I am a work in progress. I am committed. I will never quit. I dropped some of the guilt. I dropped some of the baggage. I dropped some of the weight. That is a total loss of 56 pounds to date and this voyage isn’t close to being over. Stick around and be a witness. Thank you for your support!
