anybody else work in retail and want to scream somedays???
 have just got in from work and its been one of those days!!!! I work in a shop in my town centre and actually really love my job but days like today drives me mad!!! Every other customer was just in the worst mood and seemed to love taking it out on me!!

Today i had:

several people lobbing their money at me when i was on the till
people shoving money under my nose when i am still trying to get things through the till
one man telling me how awful our stock was for about 10 minutes! Not sure what i was supposed to do about that!
Someone totally ignoring their child while she destroyed a display, then looked at the damage the child had done and just went &apos;ok, lets go&apos;. Didnt even attempt to put anything back.
And several complaint about how the shop is too small and we need more staff!!


Aggggghhhhhhhhh!!!

Ok rant over.

There are some fantastic customers out there however that make me laugh, they always make my day. Reply With Quote 18-08-11,  16:44 #3 Becky J(34) Member Join Date Feb 2009 Location Somewhere sparkly...* Posts 620 I work in a fast food restaurant and OH MY GOD some customers!

We are franchised and the franchisee keeps putting the prices up and up and up, so the customers have a go at us about what a rip off it is, as if it&apos;s our fault!

One conversation I had with a customer went like this...

Customer - 1.59 for a latte?? What a rip-off! They were 1.49 last time I came in. That&apos;s daylight robbery that!
*explains why the prices have gone up*
*customer rolls eyes*
Me - At least it&apos;s cheaper than if you went to Starbucks or somewhere like that.
Customer - Yeah plus the coffee&apos;s nicer here than in Starbucks anyways.

Well what you complaining about then???

And when they complain when you don&apos;t fill their drink right up to the top, when you&apos;re only meant to fill it up to the line anyways.
Or that their fries are too salty, or not salty enough, or in one case, too hot!!
Or when they literally throw money at you from across the counter.
Or when you give them like 9-odd change in pound coins because you have no fivers in your till, even tho you apologise that you have no fivers in your till.
Or when they complain that you have to pay for sauces (even tho again that&apos;s not our fault, franchisees decision)

Also, we don&apos;t have a staff room in our store, so we have to sit out on the dining area on our break, and some customers are sat on the table next to you going &apos;that burger was sh*t, those fries were sh*t...&apos; and looking at us... We didn&apos;t make it, we&apos;re on our break, take it back!!

i also had plenty of abuse about the fact i was organising my christmas stock into the shop drawers as it is going out monday. is that my decision??NO!!!! but feel free to swear at me about it! grrrrrrr

and once dd is in bed the wine will be open! Reply With Quote 18-08-11,  17:07 #6 Claire H(1552) Member Join Date Jul 2011 Posts 416 I work in the HR department of a big supermarket chain, and although I don&apos;t work on the shop floor I have witnessed first hand some disgusting treatment of the people working on the shop floor and tills. The rudeness is unbelievable! This isn&apos;t just a few people either, this is a fair amount being moody, rude, ignorant and aggressive. I don&apos;t know what gets into some people when they go into a shop, it seems to turn normal folk into monsters! I understand sometimes is can be frustrating waiting your turn or if an item is out of stock or deemed too expensive but yelling in the face of someone who cannot do anything about it and has no control over the situation is horrible. I&apos;ve had colleagues reduced to tears on many occasions by the nastiness of the general public! I even had one lady THROW a frozen chicken at a someone on a till because she had to wait Reply With Quote 18-08-11,  17:13 #7 Irene G(9) Member Join Date Oct 2009 Posts 2,257 am so glad i don&apos;t work in retail any more, left when i had my kids!

my fella used to work in a shop and some days i sat in the shop with him, and most of the customers were lovely, but one woman was really rude but she made the mistake of being rude to me but didn&apos;t realise i wasn&apos;t staff, i called her a cheeky cow and she shut up.

am always nice to staff, no reason not to be, and you can always moan about bad shops to other ppl once your ourside! Is there a way to make the system fairer? Of course.. It&apos;s called equal distribution.
If money will be what determines limitations in life, then we all deserve equal amounts of it. Many socialists will want it to be based on how much. you contribute to society. Capitalists will want it to be based on many other things, not only hard work. Once we accept that the end of suffering is possible, then we can proceed with the steps that are necessary in order to achieve that.

Parents who let their children play with toys, break them and then walk off.....gets on my nerves

And when people interupt you whilst you are serving....&apos;i need that from up there&apos; me - im serving at the minute ill get in once im done, &apos; i need it now&apos;. i know ill drop everything and leave all the customers waiting before you to bow to your wish and command.

I know i sound like a sarcastic cow but sometimes it really grates on me

My pet peeves are customers who let kids destroy shelves and walk away, ones who say&quot;no, you can&apos;t have that&quot;and kid just drops whatever they had.
BUT my TOP peeve is customers who ask how much something is....

i worked in retail for 10 years.

i worked in a cycle/car parts shop and the customers where so rude to me because i am a women. actually had some guy ask me to get a man cause what use was a dippy pregnant blond to him. thankfully it was our garage manager that went to &apos;help&apos; him and he gave him an earful about me being a supervisor in store. and i&apos;d lost count of the number of times peoples only comment was &apos;shouldn&apos;t you be on the till love&apos;!!!!

had a few celebs in when i worked in the city centre and a few did the &apos;do you know who i am?&apos; eh yes your a customer and i&apos;m dealing with one right now! Reply With Quote 18-08-11,  23:20 #13 Annmarie m Member Join Date May 2005 Location the other side of glasgow Posts 246 wasn&apos;t me but my friend works on the customer service of a supermarket and had a guy throw a flaky because his two for 10 pound offer hadn&apos;t come off his bill. took 20 odd minutes and a manager before the fact that both items being 3 pound means they weren&apos;t eligible for a two for 10 pound offer!! Reply With Quote 18-08-11,  23:21 #14 sharron b(32) Member Join Date Jul 2010 Posts 1,125 Not in the business now but spent years there so I know what you all mean.

So many awful things I cna think of . . .

And as for &apos;the customer is always right&apos; . . . grrrr no they bloody well are not! They are only right when they actually are, and when they are polite about it, sometimes they are very very wrong indeed! Reply With Quote 18-08-11,  23:22 #15 Gail S(87) Member Join Date Jul 2010 Posts 345 I used to work in retail before I had my baby. I worked for a very large well known DIY store.

Some customers were really rude and some of the male customers wouldn&apos;t believe what you are telling them because you are a woman. However.

I will cheer you up as some of the questions I was asked by people whilst working in it was really funny.

&quot;Does that fridge come full of food when you buy it?&quot;
&quot;Do you sell nine inch nails?&quot;( for anyone that doesn&apos;t know, it&apos;s a band)
&quot;Do you sell bread and milk to go in the fridges?&quot;

My all time favourite was&quot;Do you sell fish and chips?&quot; 

There are some very strange people in this world.

They&apos;ve got extra helpings of ice cream off the ice cream man for being polite, bags of sweets from local traders for being polite etc. even though the people don&apos;t say that it&apos;s their manners that have done it, it&apos;s just people like to see and hear it and tend to do that bit more to help rather than feel daunted.... it&apos;s worked wonders for me in my time and I&apos;ve got further with an issue through being polite rather than abusive. &apos;Be true to yourself - because ultimately, it&apos;s yourself you have to answer to&apos; Reply With Quote 18-08-11,  23:29 #17 sharron b(32) Member Join Date Jul 2010 Posts 1,125 Originally Posted by Annmarie m had a few celebs in when i worked in the city centre and a few did the &apos;do you know who i am?&apos; eh yes your a customer and i&apos;m dealing with one right now! I had loads of them over the years, and often it was the ones who&apos;d you&apos;d least expect it from, whereas some of those you did expect it from where actually nice as pie and made no issue of it. A certain duchess with a not too pleasant reputation used to come in with her children and she was always absolutely lovely where as a not so famous actor, the type you&apos;d recognise only if you were actually a fan of his type of films, was an obnoxious git!

There was a guy who was a regular for a few weeks who was always waiting for Richard Harris . . every time he left he told us to let Mr Harris know if he turned up, because he was meant to and hadn&apos;t, must have been delayed by some important meeting, that they&apos;d left and gone on t x,. y or z . . . always seemed to expect special treatment because he &apos;was waiting for Mr Harris you know&apos;. Of course nobody believed him and we were just about at the point of telling him so when one day, 10 minutes after he sat down who turned up? Yep, Richard Harris (who incidently was nice as pie and never made an issue of who he was, nobody would have known he was even there if not for the other guy making such a fuss of &apos;Mr Harris&apos; and his arrival lol) Reply With Quote 18-08-11,  23:44 #18 Karaleena S Member Join Date Mar 2010 Location A million miles from normality Posts 1,216 I used to work in Sainsburys - wow! Some people were so nasty and rude, it was almost unreal. Heres just a few things I had happen

My very first day, 1st customer on tills, gives me, money, a cheque, card she wants to take points off, saving stamps and a debit card (big shop lol) I of course got a bit flusted and the lady helping me, was showing me what to do, this woman was really carrying on, calling me stupid, telling me to hurry up, asking for the manager, i felt like crying and walking out! She then said&quot;My bus was due 5 minutes ago&quot;A customer behind her then had enough and said&quot;Will you shut up, it say on the till she is new, she is trying her hardest and if your bus was due five minutes ago, you should have come here earlier!&quot; LOVED that customer 

I had a man, who I beleive had real issues, THROW the entire contents of his basket at me, as I asked him to take the items out of the basket as he was just stood gawping at them.

A stalker, who we had to ban in the end, as he kept bombarding me with letters and flowers and then told a bloke who worked there he was going to&quot;get&quot;me after work because I turned him down 

A woman shout at me, before the store even opend as I wouldn&apos;t let her in!

Oh and when I was 7 months pregnant....4 ft 11 with no weight but HUGE bump...pretty obvious and a lazy **** family stood there and asked me to pack all there shopping, wouldn&apos;t have minded, but it was all really heavy things - crates of beers, huge cat litter bags, big packs of water, then said I was lazy as I called someone over to help 

......When I was 17 I worked in a coffee shop, I was doing a coffee, when I went to turn off the hot milk, I turned it the wrong way and put it on full, burnt all my hand and some of my wrist, was blistering and peeling and the jack **** I was serving SAW it and was still wittering on&quot;I wanted two coffees and a...&quot;SHUT THE HELL UP, MY ARM IS MELTING AWAY!!!

Aw, retail, and to think I will prob be back there soon.......... 

 Don&apos;t follow me, I don&apos;t know where I&apos;m going!&quot; Reply With Quote 18-08-11,  23:58 #19 Cathy H(110) member Join Date Aug 2011 Posts 31 Never worked in retail but work in a hotel.

I used to work for a card/gift shop and one morning, the minute we opened up we had a young teen come to the till asking for a refund due to buying the wrong cards for her mum (they were from her dad, he sent her there to choose one for his wife..)

Our policy at the time was no proof of purchase, then no refund unfortunately but we could offer an exchange. The girl went away and seemed happy, so I thought anyway! A few minutes later an angry looking man comes charging in the shop asking for his 79p back as his wife would not like the card his daughter had chose.

He then started quoting his legal rights to me...it was 9am!

But remember, the customer is always right. 

There was another today, someone asked if we had something in stock, I KNOW we did not have any of it as it was discon, however this guy would not take no for an answer and I had to ask the manager and what did she say?! No, it has been discon. Made me look like I could not do my job properly. 

I do love some customers though, the ones who are smiley and chatty, makes retail nicer to work in. Reply With Quote 19-08-11,  00:14 #21 Siobhan A(28) Member Join Date Aug 2011 Posts 9 Loling at some posts here.

more stuff that drives me bonkers

people who queue up first thing in the morning outside, but the insist on banging on the doors demanding we open

people who come in at 5.29 and spend 20 mins picking stuff, despite us closing at 5.30 and us telling them they only have a minute!

the sheer amount of food and drink that is spilled in the shop

the dirty nappy i found down one isle 

customer who walk up to you and go &apos;wedding&apos;. er wedding what?? apparently in customer language that means &apos;excuse me, where is your wedding section&apos;. i have actually started to refuse to help people unless they say excuse me or please.if my 3 yr old can do it, so can grown ups 

people who pay for something that is 50p with a 20 note when your till float is only 50, and more than one person does this first thing, you are then screwed!

Its the worst experience of my life, and I need to get back into work now, but the thought of working in another shop fills me with dread.
Asda always had a policy of offering the best customer service. I have to say I did try my best. I was polite, helpfull, and would do everything in my power to help the customers.
I worked on the clothing bit, and the abuse I got reduced me to tears.
A lady accused me of shoving a trolley into her son, that NEVER happened. The manager had me over it and I was so upset. She then admitted it wasn&apos;t me.
I&apos;ve had things thrown at me, comments about my weight, complaints about the quality of the clothing (I haven&apos;t made it), the list goes on.
I&apos;ve also had to pick up peoples stinking shoes up and throw them away (they walked out in a brand new pair).
The worst bit was when a man was caught masturbating in the changing room. He&apos;d left the door open, there was a mom and her young daughter in the next changing room.
