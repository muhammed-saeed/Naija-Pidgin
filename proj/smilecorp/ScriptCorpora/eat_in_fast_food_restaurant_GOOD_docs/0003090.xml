 How to recieve a raise Fast Food Worker - (City withheld for privacy), Pennsylvania, United States I waited 6 months and asked for a raise in a note expressing that I believed I deserved a raise and named everything that I did. In two weeks I got a 10 cent raise. It&apos;s not a lot but some people have been there 5 years and never got a raise. Posted in Negotiating Higher Pay on 22 Jun 2008
