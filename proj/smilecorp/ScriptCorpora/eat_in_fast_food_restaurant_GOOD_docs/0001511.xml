Description:

 CROSS -REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS

 [0001] This application is related to and claims priority from U.S.
 Provisional Patent Application 60/985,606 filed Nov. 5, 2007 which is
 hereby incorporated by reference.

 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 

 [0002] Conventional commercial restrooms are characterized by multiple
 plumbing fixtures and their respective fittings, such as water closets
 with flushometers, urinals with and without flushometers, lavatory sinks
 with faucets, and the accompanying devices that dispense consumables such
 as soap, paper towels, water closet tissues, water closet disposable seat
 covers, urinal deodorant supplies, and wall hung air fresheners. With
 such a wide diversity of amenities in any given commercial restroom,
 periodic maintenance of the consumables alone (consumables are those
 provided materials that are used by the restroom patrons as a function of
 traffic) creates a substantial task list, not only in the supply of them
 into the dispensing devices within the restroom, but also into the
 particular facility where they are being consumed.

 [0003] Managers of commercial restrooms view the restroom as yet another
 expense or at the other extreme an opportunity to make a statement to
 their customers. Indeed many studies have shown a large impact can be
 experienced by customers whether positive or negative by the customer&apos;s
 singular visit to the restroom area. In some of these installations, the
 multi fixture restrooms can be many and can be located in remote parts of
 a large expansive campus. Typically the cleaning, consumable refilling,
 and plumbing maintenance has fallen under the responsibility of the
 property owner or property manager. The routine cleaning of the restroom
 and refilling of the soap, paper towels, and paper tissue dispensers has
 typically fallen upon the in house group under maintenance called house
 keepers. Their primary responsibility is to maintain the commercial
 restrooms for a pleasant and efficient use by customers visiting the
 property. This routine cleaning is accomplished by facilities through
 many schemes and systems that range from very informal and non specific,
 to regimented systems of routes and times of the routing. In the past,
 most owners of commercial restrooms have cleaned and maintained the
 restroom this way in order to maintain an area of the property
 (commercial restroom) but is a procedure which can do harm with an
 unpleasant patron experience.

 [0004] Of all the venues for commercial restrooms, one common patron
 problem is universal. More times than not, a particular patron of the
 commercial property restroom is not familiar with the property layout and
 the location of all of the possible restrooms. Manual signage is only
 indicative of location; and in the instance of many people using the most
 convenient restroom, forewarning of a queue (people waiting in line
 inside the restroom) and choices of alternate restrooms with no queues is
 not possible. Moreover, conventional restroom facilities, especially in
 high traffic areas, such as airports, stadiums, educational institutions,
 and restaurants have traditionally experienced long queues and
 insufficient or wasted asset capacity during periods of peak restroom
 usage. As such, potential restroom users are often subjected to
 frustration and inconvenience as a result of these issues. A particular
 challenge is not only the daily servicing many of these restrooms, but it
 is also being able to leverage that service with fewer employees in a job
 position, which is also prone to high turnover. For example, if a
 particular restroom within a property has not been used all day, there is
 no need to waste valuable time servicing that restroom. This is equally
 valid if certain fixtures are known historically to have been used more
 than others; and the periodic routine maintenance of that fixture could
 potentially be deferred to a less frequent servicing routine, if there
 were some efficient way to do so.

 [0005] The tasks of cleaning and replenishing consumables in a commercial
 restroom have ultimately fallen upon the owner of the general property.
 Whether that property is a public pay for entertainment (movie theatres
 and stadiums), hospitality (hotels and resorts), convention halls, or
 high traffic public locations (railroad stations, airports, etc.) varying
 degrees of methods have been used to clean and replenish the commercial
 restrooms of those properties. Much of the methods have been home grown
 and specific to the properties, from simple route plans that teams of
 employees are instructed to follow (to evenly cover the expansive
 property layouts), to specific routines of restrooms based upon known
 general traffic conditions. For example, in airports, a restroom located
 next to a gate which routinely deplanes large body aircraft may be overly
 utilized whenever the large population of flyers deplanes. Depending upon
 the level of quality desired for each property, the actual maintenance
 routine could be minimal, leaving major cleaning to less traffic periods.
 The actual routing of house keepers and verifying a
 cleaning/replenishment routine is left to knowledge of the property
 traffic and simple hand written logs which sometimes can be found hanging
 in an inconspicuous spot within the restroom. Absent a miscalculation on
 traffic pattern or an incomplete service routine by a new maintenance
 employee, the need for servicing may be determined only by a physical
 observation of the restroom or worse yet, a customer complaint about the
 state of a substandard commercial restroom.

 [0006] National restaurant chains and QSRs (Quick Serve Restaurants) know
 the impact of substandard restroom cleanliness with some chains actually
 placing a dollar value on the cost. Such a costly element of the business
 is left to the good practices of a busy manager who with the best of
 intentions during the manager&apos;s work day, does not always have the time
 to devote to restroom quality. The forgotten small restrooms during the
 business day can better be monitored centrally from the home offices as
 well as allowing for the economies of large scale use on consumables
 purchases for bargaining with low cost providers of such consumables. It
 is yet another factor of today&apos;s business models that can have the
 restroom monitoring being performed remotely as well as the consumables
 procurement being remote from the actual consumption.

 [0007] A large segment of commercial restroom owners contract out the
 sanitation tasks of the commercial restroom to outside service providers
 and the service that used to be in house is now more economically sourced
 out. This has allowed for reductions in house personnel to maintain the
 restroom, keeping a fraction of the previous work force for emergency
 tasks. These service providers can be a local agent or a branch of a
 larger state or country wide company. With the bulk of the work tasks
 being contracted outside a business, the actual supplies purchasing for a
 specific restroom can be located miles or even states away and are now
 more disparate than when accomplished by in house personnel. These
 changes have ushered in a whole new set of challenges when it comes to
 maximizing the commercial restroom as an asset.

 [0008] The traditional commercial restroom has provided water control and
 dispensing consumables through either manual operation, or automatic
 operation using infrared sensors or other sensors that detect the
 presence of users, of faucets on sinks, water closets, urinals and other
 consumables dispensers. At the present time many of these types of
 commercial restrooms have adopted &quot;hands free&quot; operation where the user
 touching the various plumbing fittings is minimized for the user&apos;s
 convenience or sanitary reasons. Most of these automatic sensors follow a
 logical routine for detecting valid targets (users within a predefined
 sensing zone) and ignoring invalid targets such as patrons walking past
 plumbing sensor detections zones or hands moving quickly below faucet and
 soap dispenser fittings. Typically, each valve operates alone with no
 communication or direct interaction with other valves and each sensor
 operates an associated fixture with no communication or correlation with
 other sensors. With no inter communication or central communication,
 potentially useful information that can be extracted from, for example,
 the activation and deactivation of individual sensors is not utilized
 and/or discarded. Simple counting of the activations may yield some basic
 inferential information on consumables but precise prediction of the
 entire property&apos;s restrooms can be greatly underutilized. Some prior art
 patents, owned by the assignee, U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,304,569 and 7,177,725
 network these sensors for gross control of the restroom via a central
 controller offering two way communication between the plumbing fittings
 and a central area. The actual electronic detection elements of the
 sensor software are not broken up and only gross information of on and
 off and length between the on and off can be extrapolated. In the case of
 sensors to detect all levels of consumable paper and level of consumable
 liquids more sensors complicate the system network and are prone to
 diagnostic and added repair when they fail, increasing life cycle costs
 and system complexity.

 [0009] The lack of restroom automation can also lead to wasted water due to
 valves that leak slowly or run-on causing flooding. Slow leaks during
 no-demand times can also prompt intervention by maintenance staff to fix
 a slow leak before it becomes so obvious it is running on. The lack of
 restroom automation further can lead to suboptimal operating conditions
 such as water flow-failure, exhausted consumable supplied, inoperable
 water fixtures, which can increase the cost of ownership, and/or general
 owner and user dissatisfaction due to any of the above. Accordingly,
 there is a substantial need for improved monitoring and maintenance of
 restrooms, and also there is, a need to maximize the restroom asset while
 minimizing the cost to maintain the asset by support services.

 [0010] Additionally, there has been a movement to implement ecologically
 friendly and ecologically efficient systems and services in facilities,
 in particular, with respect to, e.g., water, paper, and soap consumption
 in restrooms. From a servicing standpoint, facilities managers as well as
 janitorial staff have also experienced frustration and an inability to
 effectuate efficient operating procedures allowing such staff to maintain
 consumables supplies and also to know when, for example, an appropriate
 time period (e.g., a lull in restroom activity) would allow janitorial
 staff to address issues in the restroom facilities. Hence, there is a
 need for implementing systems and methods that can address these problems
 from both the restroom user perspective and the servicing staff
 perspective. With more large facilities contracting out the housekeeping
 service, the need for making those servicing visits by outside personnel
 requires more exacting information on what to expect at a given
 commercial restroom within a property. It would be highly advantageous
 for such systems and methods to be integrated with solutions for
 addressing the need for improved monitoring and control of restrooms, as
 well as reducing the need for additional infrastructure, e.g., minimal
 use of sensors, thus simplifying and/or simply eliminating the increased
 cost and service requirements for additional sensors. With the increasing
 demand and economic pressure, monitoring the commercial restroom at a
 quality level with minimal costs, has become extremely difficult. There
 is a further need to maximize the restroom asset while minimizing the
 support services cost to maintain the asset.

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 

 [0011] A system comprises a plurality of sensors in a restroom facility
 which operate various automatic devices such as flushometers, faucets,
 and other commercial restroom devices. The sensors are in communication
 with a network and provide direct information regarding aspects of the
 restroom facility such as, but not limited to, timing information, water
 closet and urinal water flow, temperature, air quality, and user traffic.
 The system extrapolates the direct information to determine indirect
 information regarding the state of other various aspects of the restroom
 facility, including, but not limited to, the condition of the water
 closets and urinals the supply level of consumables, the general
 cleanliness of the restroom facility and availability generally of
 various restrooms and also of fixtures in the restroom when traffic
 patterns in the facility are high. The system provides an indication
 regarding the need for attention to an aspect of the restroom facility
 based upon the direct (actual sensor activations) and indirect
 information (heuristic software models). For example, a control system
 can include at least one server configured to monitor data states
 associated with a first of features of the restroom; a controller coupled
 to the at least one sensor and configured to receive first state data
 associated with the first set of features and, the controller further
 having a coupled memory storage with embedded alarm data characteristic
 of selected combinations of different ones of the first states data and
 the controller operative to generate particular action commands upon
 receiving a selected one of the combinations, thereby causing at least
 one of servicing of the restroom, activation of informational direction
 to user of the restroom and providing useful restroom status information
 to the user. In addition, in another aspect of the invention, a method
 for forecasting restroom usage queue times for selected fixtures of the
 restroom includes operably associating at least one fixture sensor with
 at least one fixture in the restroom, such that at least one attribution
 of the fixture is monitored by the fixture sensor; operably associating
 each of the at least one fixture sensors with a restroom controller;
 monitoring entrance and exit events for the restroom using a presence
 sensor, the presence sensor associated with the restroom controller;
 generating a time/date stamp for data generated by the at least one
 fixture sensor and the presence sensor; determining a user saturation of
 the restroom; calculating an estimated queue time associated with the
 user saturation of the restroom; and communicating the calculated queue
 time to potential users; thereby enabling efficient use of the restroom.

 [0012] In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a restroom
 control system for controlling a restroom and its restroom facilities.
 The system comprises one or more sensors configured to monitor states
 associated with a first set of features of the restroom. A controller is
 operably coupled to the one or more sensors, and configured to receive
 first states data therefrom associated with the first set of features to
 determine second state data associated with a second set of features and
 communicate the status condition associated with the first set of
 features, thereby causing useful actions to be scheduled for the
 restroom.

 [0013] Another aspect of the invention related to a method for
 automatically generating work orders for a restroom by: sensing the state
 of at least one restroom fixture; communicating the at least one sensed
 state to a controller; calculating the use of at least one type of
 consumable within the restroom facility based upon a predetermined
 average usage for each of the at least one sensed states; aggregating the
 calculated usage for each type of consumable within the restroom facility
 to determine a total amount used for each type of consumable; determining
 when the total amount used for each type of consumable surpasses a
 predetermined threshold; evaluating at least one of additional stored
 data and sudden occurrence data for determining whether the predetermined
 threshold should be adjusted based on the additional stored data and the
 sudden occurrence data; and issuing a work order for replenishment of
 each type of consumable for which the respective threshold has been
 surpassed.

 [0014] In a further aspect, the present invention relates to a method
 comprising: receiving first data from a plurality of sensors, at least
 one associated with a flushometer; inferring information based on the
 received first data, the inferred information being indicative of at
 least one state of the restroom facility requiring at least one
 corrective measure; and transmitting at least one notification including
 at least one instruction for implementing the at least one corrective
 measure.

 [0015] In yet another aspect, the present invention relates to a computer
 implemented system for managing restroom facilities, comprising a central
 processing unit (CPU) and a storage device coupled to the CPU. The
 storage device has information stored therein for configuring the CPU to:
 first data from a plurality of sensors associated with at least one of an
 appliance aspect and a utilization aspect of a restroom facility; second
 data determined by executing computer software based on the received
 first data, the second data being indicative of at least action state of
 the restroom facility requiring at least one corrective measure for the
 restroom facilities; and an alarm system activated by a notification of
 achieving the at least one action states including at least one
 instruction for implementing the at least one corrective measure for
 servicing the restroom facilities.

 [0016] In yet another aspect, the present invention related to a method for
 forecasting restroom usage queue times for selected fixtures of the
 restroom. The method comprises: operably associating at least one fixture
 sensor with at least one fixture in the restroom, such that at least one
 attribution of the fixture is monitored by the fixture sensor; operably
 associating each of the at least one fixture sensors with a restroom
 controller; monitoring entrance and exit events for the restroom using a
 presence sensor, the presences sensor associated with the restroom
 controller; generating a time/date stamp for data generated by the at
 least one fixture sensor and the presence sensor; determining a user
 saturation of the restroom; calculating an estimated queue time
 associated with the user saturation of the restroom; and communicating
 the calculated queue time to potential users thereby enabling efficient
 use of the restroom.

 [0017] In yet another embodiment, the present invention relates to a system
 for a restroom. The system includes at least one server configured to
 monitor data states associated with a first of features of the restroom.
 A controller is coupled to the at least one sensor and configured to
 receive first state data associated with the first set of features. The
 controller has a coupled memory storage with embedded alarm data
 characteristic of selected combinations of different ones of the first
 states data. The controller is operative to generate particular action
 commands upon receiving a selected one of the combinations, thereby
 causing at least one of servicing of the restroom, activation of
 informational direction to user of the restroom and providing useful
 restroom status information to the user.

 therein. For example, the fixture 130 may include one or more water
 closets 132, one or more automatic urinals 134, one or more faucets 136,
 trash receptacles 140, as well as dispensers 142 of consumable items such
 as restroom tissue paper, soap, paper napkin, fragrance, bowl sanitizer,
 seat covers, and hand sanitizer. Other types of the fixtures 130
 (showers, hand dryers, and a product dispensing machine) may also reside
 within the restroom 101 and all such fixtures 130 are contemplated as
 falling within the scope of the present invention. As illustrated in FIG.
 1, at least one information source 111 is provided in communication with
 a restroom convenience center controller 110. The information source 111
 may be, for example, a sensor 112 or a peripheral device 113.

 [0045] Briefly turning to the sensors 112, which are disclosed in more
 detail below, the restroom 101 of FIG. 1 further includes a plurality of
 the sensors 112. The sensors 112 receive data regarding observed
 conditions of the restroom 101. The sensors 112 may be associated with
 one of the fixtures 130 within the restroom 101, such as urinal automatic
 activation sensors 152 associated with the urinals 134 respectively,
 water closet automatic activation sensors 151 associated with the water
 closets 132 in the restroom 101 and faucet automatic activation sensors
 153 associated with faucets 136. Other ones of the sensors 112 may be
 located within the restroom 101 for gathering data but not associated
 with a particular one of the fixtures 130, such as air quality sensor
 156, patron counter 158, and a water flow sensor 160. Various sensors 112
 for use with the present invention are further described below.

 [0046] With continued reference to FIG. 1, the restroom convenience center
 controller 110 is operatively associated with each of the sensors 112 in
 the restroom 101 as illustrated, to receive (either via &quot;push&quot; or &quot;pull&quot;)
 data from one or more of the various sensors 112 (or their respective
 controllers) within the restroom 101. Although FIG. 1 illustrates
 hard-wired type electrical connection to the sensors 112, it should be
 appreciated that such sensors 112 may be coupled to the controller 110 in
 a wireless or other type manner, and such alternatives are contemplated
 by the present invention and described in further detail below. A
 preferred embodiment utilizes a ZigBee® wireless network protocol
 which is able to create self-organizing mesh networks, thus negating any
 need to perform complicated routing configurations between wireless
 nodes. It should be noted, however, that other network protocols and/or
 infrastructures can be utilized in accordance with various embodiments.
 It should also be noted that although it is preferable to utilize
 wireless-based sensors and facilities (collectively referred to as
 wireless information sources 215, for example shown in FIG. 2), if for
 example, building infrastructure inhibits the effectiveness of wireless
 communications, wired sensors, facilities, and networks (collectively
 referred to as wired information sources 214, for example shown in FIG.
 2) can be used in accordance with various embodiments such as fiber and
 power line communication.

 [0047] Furthermore, although the restroom convenience center system 100 is
 generally illustrated and referred to as a physically separate component
 from the fixture 130 and the sensors 112, it should be appreciated that
 the restroom convenience center system 100 may be included as a single
 device or component with the other sensors 112 or the peripheral devices
 113, such as in combination with the air quality sensor 156, built into
 the flushometer automatic activation sensor 152, 151 of the urinal 134 or
 the water closet 132, or integrated with a graphical user interface 180
 in the restroom 101. It will be appreciated that this can be ideal for
 &quot;retrofit&quot; applications or for small restrooms. It should be appreciated
 in instances where the restroom convenience center controller 110 is
 &quot;accessible&quot; to patrons, the tamper detection aspects of the invention
 discussed further below achieve an increased importance.

 [0048] FIG. 2 is a more detailed illustration of the components of the
 restroom convenience center controller 110 in accordance with various
 embodiments. The restroom convenience center controller 110 consists of
 one or more hardware modules and associated software. In the embodiment
 of FIG. 2, one hardware module is referred to as the Data Collection Unit
 (DCU) 210, which is responsible for collecting data from all attached
 devices, including, for example, hard-wired components or wireless
 components, such as via a Device Area Network (DAN) 230, providing system
 time and passing device data to the Network Interface Unit (NIU 220). The
 wired information sources 214 may include the air quality sensor 156
 (FIG. 1), a janitor login interface 172 (such as for janitorial access),
 a patron call device 173 as discussed further below, a keypad 174 and
 local user interface (LUI) 180 for stakeholder interaction, a tamper
 switch or sensor 181, and a temperature sensor 162. The wireless
 information sources 215 in communication with the DAN 230 may include,
 for example, the automatic activation sensor 151, the water flow sensor
 160, the faucet automatic activation sensor 153, and the patron counter
 158.

 [0049] The Data Collection Unit 210, for example, can be, but is not
 limited to, an Atmel AVR microprocessor. The DCU 210 manages the DCU 210
 configuration, collects data from attached wired information sources 214
 and wireless information sources 215, provides system time via an RTC
 (real-time clock) 240, performs some minimal processing of data,
 communicates with the NIU 220, communicates with DAN 230, and provides a
 mechanism to update its application flash image. Thus, as illustrated in
 FIG. 2, the DCU 210 receives data from various attached peripheral
 devices 113 (air quality sensor 156, janitor login interface 172, patron
 call device 173, keypad 174, tamper sensor or switch 181, temperature
 sensor 162, LUI 180, RTC 240) described in further detail below, as well
 as from those sensors and devices that are wirelessly linked to the
 restroom convenience center controller 110. The DCU 210 also provides
 information back &quot;out&quot; of the controller 110 such as to provide the LUI
 180 to a stakeholder in the restroom 101. In one embodiment, the DCU 210
 receives data from the respective sensors 112 at set time intervals and
 timestamps the data. It should be appreciated that the DCU 210 may be
 configured as desired to receive or request information at different time
 intervals (or even substantially continuously) from different sensors
 112. A nonlimiting example would include, for example, as the air quality
 sensor 156 that may transmit data every second and the water closet
 automatic activation sensor 151 that transmits data every minute.

 [0050] With continued reference to FIG. 2, the NIU 220 is another hardware
 module that can be utilized in accordance with various embodiments, and
 is responsible for providing access to the Internet 250 by a user 260
 such as by a web-based user interface for configuring and viewing system
 contents, storing historical data, data driven event notification, and a
 means for notifying an external server of re-supply and predictive
 maintenance data. The NIU 220, for example, is a Digi Connect ME module.
 The NIU 220 manages the NIU 220 configuration of: devices, for example,
 ZigBee nodes; IP parameters; configurable user preferences; provides a
 full Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) stack;
 provides user notifications; provides predictive maintenance and
 re-supply algorithm capability; provides a web-based user interface to
 the system; provides an File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server for code
 updates; provides an FTP client for code updates; provides timestamp
 capability; provides historical data on demand; and uses the ThreadX
 operating system.

 [0051] Continuing the reference to FIG. 2, the DAN 230 is responsible for
 managing the wireless device network and providing an interface between
 attached nodes and the DCU 210. The DAN 230 can, for example, be a
 MaxStream XBee ZigBee interface module. However, it should be appreciated
 that various types of networks known in the art may be utilized with the
 restroom convenience center system 100. The DAN 230 acts as a network
 coordinator to manage the device network; communicates with attached
 nodes; and communicates with the DCU 210.

 [0052] As described above, the NIU 220 is responsible for providing a
 web-based user interface, which is discussed below. With reference now to
 FIG. 3, in one embodiment of the system the controller 110, such as via
 the NIU 220 (see, FIG. 4 also), is communicatively connected to the
 Internet 250 or some other network capable of providing
 data/communications and allows an end user, such as a system operator,
 building facilities manager, etc. to interact with the restroom
 convenience center controller 110 over, e.g., the Internet via &quot;embedded
 web pages.&quot; The embedded web pages can provide various remote
 interactions with and displays associated with data sensed and
 extrapolated at the restroom convenience center controller 110. For
 example, the embedded web pages can allow an end user to acknowledge
 alerts, reset counters and/or sensors, and perform a &quot;manual&quot; janitorial
 visit. Additionally, the embedded web pages can provide access to views
 of all relevant restroom convenience center controller 110 and restroom
 convenience center system 100 information.

 [0053] With reference to FIG. 4, a detailed illustration is provided
 depicting one embodiment of the various restroom convenience center
 controller 110 elements (DCU 210, NIU 220, and DAN 230) and their
 corresponding function. The DCU 210 can comprise, but is not limited to,
 the following modules: a time management module, a configuration
 persistence module, the firmware, interfaces, e.g., the XBee interface,
 and data acquisition and control modules for attached devices as well as
 wireless devices. The NIU 220 can comprise, but is not limited to, the
 following modules: a time management module, a configuration persistence
 module, the firmware, web server and machine-to-machine interface, a data
 archive, various predictive algorithms, and communication interfaces,
 e.g., for email, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), etc. The DAN 230 can
 comprise, but is not limited to, XBee ZBee interface module, and
 firmware.

 [0054] While generally the restroom convenience center system 100 is
 referred to in the singular sense, it should be appreciated that in
 certain embodiments multiple areas of the restroom convenience center
 systems 100 may be linked to a networked system providing for centralized
 control and/or data warehousing. Thus, FIG. 5A illustrates a restroom
 convenience center controller 110 in communication with information
 sources 111. Typically this represents a single restroom 101, such as
 shown in FIG. 1. FIGS. 5B and 5C are diagrams illustrating another
 exemplary aspect of the present invention, wherein a plurality of the
 restroom convenience center controller 110, each individually associated
 with their own respective restroom(s), are coupled to a central global
 command unit, e.g., network operations center (NOC) 510.

 [0055] Various embodiments contemplate a central monitor and control system
 associated with a large venue, such as, for example, a convention center,
 an airport, a school, a hospital or a sports stadium in which a large
 number of restrooms 101 reside therein. In such an embodiment, each
 restroom 101 can have its own restroom convenience center controller 110
 associated therewith, in which data is received from various information
 sources 111 therein, and a status communication is then communicated in
 response thereto. More particularly, in the present example, such data is
 transmitted over a communication pathway such as a data bus [not shown],
 through a router [not shown] (optional), to a global command unit over a
 system level data bus.

 [0056] With specific reference to FIG. 5B, three separate restroom
 convenience center controllers 110 are illustrated as being in
 communication with a NOC 510. The restroom NOC 510 includes a restroom
 management database 511 allowing for storage and retrieval of
 information, such as for performing predicting functions as further
 described below. In addition, it should be appreciated that various
 software modules may be resident or accessible via the Internet 250 to
 allow functionality for messaging, predictive maintenance, consumable
 replenishment, route planning, LEED (Leadership in Energy Efficiency
 Design) compliance, water conservation, figures of merit, policy
 compliance, and building and patron safety. Such an embodiment may be
 useful for controlling all of the restroom 101 within a given facility.
 FIG. 5C is a further embodiment wherein each restroom convenience center
 controller 110 for a facility is in communication with an intermediary
 controller 520 for that facility which is in turn, along with other like
 controllers 520 for other facilities, in communication with a NOC 510. It
 will be appreciated that such an embodiment may be useful in monitoring
 global facilities within a single entity or providing restroom management
 services to a group of different entities.

 [0057] Although optional, the intelligent routers [not shown] may be
 employed in the present example to facilitate an orderly transfer of data
 to the NOC 510 in an orderly fashion to avoid packet collisions, etc. In
 one example, the analysis of collected data, discussed further below, is
 performed at the restroom convenience center and alarm conditions and
 states are passed on to the NOC 510. However, in another embodiment of
 the present invention, some portions of analysis are performed at both
 the restroom convenience center controller 110 level and at the NOC 510
 level. For example, to the extent that further analysis is to be
 performed to compare and/or analyze historical or trend data between the
 various different restrooms, as is further discussed below, such analysis
 can be done at (passed up to) the NOC 510.

 [0058] The restroom convenience center controller 110 will also
 periodically export accumulated system and device data to an outside
 server 510 as described above. The system operator may configure the
 restroom convenience center controller 110 to export none, some, or all
 of the interim/direct data that it collects from the facilities (e.g.
 exporting all sensor data from the flushometers, or exporting all
 accumulated air quality sensor 156 data) which would otherwise be
 discarded. In addition to this interim data, all accumulated totals (e.g.
 total flushes, total faucet run time) will be sent to an outside server.
 Data is sent as, for example, a comma-separated-value (CSV) file attached
 to a regular email. One skilled can appreciate XML format, SNMP (Simple
 Network Management Protocol) format, to name a few can equally be
 applicable. The location of the email server or the type of recipient
 (machine, human) is unimportant; the only requirement being that the
 restroom convenience center controller 110 is properly configured to
 contact an outgoing mail server on its local network (via Ethernet or
 WiFi).

 [0059] A key benefit of a centralized approach embodiment, especially when
 monitoring a very large number of geographically distributed restrooms
 101, includes the ability to leverage existing commercial database,
 knowledge engine, data mining, customer help desk, and customer
 relationship management software applications when building restroom
 management applications. Such a large scale system would require,
 preferably, the computing power to run sophisticated applications on top
 of the commercial software packages to speed development and reduce
 development costs. Applications might include predictive failure models
 based on statistical methods such as the Poisson distribution, dynamic
 resource scheduling based on queuing theory, route planning, and order
 forecasting. Alternatively, a smaller scale system may not require a back
 office to aggregate data from multiple locations, but instead would place
 a high value on a localized system that is remotely accessible and would
 likely emphasize different benefits from that of a corporate retail
 client for instance. While some of the same applications such as
 predictive failure and route planning might be used with the localized
 system, they would likely be a subset of the full application resident at
 the data warehouse.

 [0060] If an alarm event, or need to take corrective action, is detected by
 the restroom convenience center controller 110 the alarm text, alarm
 time, restroom convenience center controller 110 identifier, alarm type,
 and any alarm-specific data is dispatched to the address(es) configured
 for that type of alarm. An alarm is only dispatched once while it is
 active. No new alarms of the type will be sent until the alarm is reset.
 The alarm is cleared by the restroom convenience center controller 110 if
 the condition that causes the alarm is reversed. The alarm is cleared by
 a user, for instance via a restroom convenience center controller 110 web
 page.

 [0061] Additionally, actions can be prompted in accordance with various
 embodiments, such as the generation of work orders. That is, after an
 appropriate one of the sensors 112 senses a state of one of a plurality
 of the restroom fixtures 130 described above, e.g., calculating the use
 of each type of consumable based upon a predetermined average usage for
 each consumable, the calculated usage for each type of consumable is
 aggregated to determine a total amount of consumable usage. When the
 total amount of consumable usage surpasses a predetermined threshold, a
 work order can be issued by the restroom convenience center controller
 110 for replenishing each type of consumable for which the respective
 threshold has been surpassed. Likewise, when the controller 110
 determines, based on the data from the sensors 112, that maintenance
 (preventative or remedial) is required, a work order, including likely
 replacement parts, can be generated.

 [0062] Referring back to FIG. 3, further detail regarding portions of the
 structure of the restroom convenience center system 100 and the relative
 interactions of the sensors 112 (such as water closet automatic
 activation sensor 151 and faucet automatic activation sensor 153), the
 peripheral devices 113 (such as patron counter device 158, and card
 reader 172) the controller 110, and communication pathways is shown. FIG.
 3, illustrates an overview diagram of a network for effectuating various
 embodiments.

 [0063] Generally speaking, all the sensors 112 associated with particular
 facilities in the restroom 101 (e.g., the patron counter 158, the urinals
 134, the consumable dispenser 142, the water closet 132, the faucets 136,
 etc) can transmit their data to the restroom convenience center
 controller 110 wirelessly (as described above), to avoid complicated or
 expensive wiring in the restroom 101. The use of wireless communications
 in association with automatic urinal 134, the water closet 132, and the
 faucets 136 allows for application of the described system without
 invasive work on the restroom. For example, the sensors 112 can
 communicate with the restroom convenience center controller 110 using, a
 ZigBee wireless network protocol.

 [0064] FIG. 3 also illustrates a local area network (LAN) 310 to which the
 restroom convenience center controller 110 is communicatively connected
 via, for example, a 10/100 Base T Ethernet or 802.11 wireless, or
 cellular data connection. The LAN 310 can provide connectivity to and
 from the restroom convenience center controller 110 and a global command
 center, e.g., a restroom convenience center controller 110 server and/or
 the NOC 510 described in greater detail below. The LAN 310 can effectuate
 communications in the form of a Web interface, email services, short
 message services (SMS) text for wireless devices using, for example, but
 not limited to extensible markup language (XML) and/or file transport
 protocol (FTP).

 [0065] In one embodiment, a janitor login interface 172, the patron counter
 158, and the indoor air quality sensor 156 and the presence sensors 150
 are also shown as being communicatively connected to the restroom
 convenience center controller 110 for gathering and transmitting sensed
 data to the restroom convenience center controller 110. Additionally, the
 sensors 112 and the peripheral devices 113 described above can be
 collectively and wirelessly connected to the restroom convenience center
 controller 110 as well, again for sensing and transmitting data to the
 restroom convenience center controller 110.

 [0066] With continued reference to FIG. 3, the restroom convenience center
 controller 110 is configured to operate on the LAN 310 of the facility in
 which it is installed as described to above. Each of the restroom
 convenience center controllers 110 can be configured, by default, to use
 a dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) to acquire network settings
 automatically. Each restroom convenience center controller 110 may also
 be manually configured with fixed network settings if required. It should
 be noted that for embodiments utilizing Wi-Fi, the restroom convenience
 center controller 110 may require additional configuration to access the
 wireless network, including the use of a SSID (Service Set Identifier)
 code as well as a WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) or WPA (Wi-Fi Protected
 Access) encryption key. Depending on the configuration of the DHCP
 (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server, it may be necessary to
 enter additional information manually, such as the SMTP (Simple Mail
 Transfer Protocol) server required for email delivery. Because the
 network settings may be configured through the serial port, it is not
 necessary to access the restroom convenience center controller 110 over
 the network to modify its network settings, but can be configured via the
 LUI 180.

 [0067] In addition, in a preferred embodiment, the restroom convenience
 center controller 110 can automatically discover active nodes, typically
 associated with one of the sensors 112 or the peripheral device 113.
 Through a web interface, e.g., embedded web pages discussed below, a
 system operator can see a list of discovered nodes and add those nodes to
 the restroom convenience center controller 110 system. The operator can
 also manually add nodes to the restroom convenience center controller 110
 system in the event that automatic discovery is not possible or feasible
 (e.g., by adding a battery-operated node).

 [0068] It should also be appreciated that each of the sensors 112 or the
 peripheral device 113 may further include an associated identifier, such
 as a unique identifier used to differentiate the data from one of the
 particular fixtures 130 from another. For example, it may be desirable
 for the system to be able to discern the first urinal from the third
 urinal in the bank of urinals 134 such that 50 actuations of each is not
 indicative of the need to replace the deodorant but 100 actuations of a
 single one of the urinals 134 would be indicative.

 [0069] Regarding the real time clock of the DCU 210, the real time clock
 240 allows for time stamping events transmitted to the restroom
 convenience center controller 110. The use of a &quot;time stamp&quot; for events
 allows for a determination of elapsed time, such as between events or
 between an adjustable baseline and an event. Using the real time clock
 240, the restroom convenience center controller 110 can also determine
 the need for certain actions based on the passage of time. For example,
 the replenishment of consumables and general cleaning may be based on
 patron volume and sensor activations as previously described, but may
 also factor in the time elapsed since a previous cleaning.

 A . Sensors

 [0070] As has been discussed above, one component of the restroom
 convenience center system 100 is the sensor 112 or a plurality of the
 sensors 112 used to provide information regarding the restroom 101 and
 stakeholders. According to one embodiment, the system 100 includes at
 least one of the sensors 112, which may be associated with a portion of
 the fixture 130 in the restroom 101 or generally monitor a state or
 property of the restroom 101, such as occupancy. Generally speaking, the
 sensors 112 will either be &quot;independent&quot; from the fixtures 130 in the
 restroom 101, such as an air quality sensor 156 or the patron counter
 158. Other sensors 112 are dependent, i.e. associated with a fixture 130
 to sense a function associated with the given fixture 130, such as
 signage for current time use of one or more of the fixtures and predicted
 time to availability or direction to an available fixture 130 or another
 restroom 101. The invention considers all possibilities for obtaining
 data, including &quot;inferred&quot; data based on other non-direct measurements,
 native communications built into the flush valve, add-on modules to
 transduce the events of interest, and also non-direct methods such as
 ultrasonically monitoring a plumbing riser and using digital signal
 processing techniques to uniquely identify the fixture 130 actuation.
 Some illustrative, non-limiting, examples of the sensors 112 for use with
 the present invention are described in greater detail below. In a more
 global view if other like restrooms 101 are present in the same site, the
 other restroom 101 need have only limited numbers of the sensors 112
 relative to a first &quot;typical&quot; restroom 101, thereby allowing accurate
 prediction of usage in all like restrooms 101. It should be noted
 however, that not all the fixtures 130 within the restroom 101 need to be
 associated with and the sensors 112. As will be described below in
 greater detail, data from one sensors 112 or the restroom 101 may be used
 to predict the current or future state of the given fixture 130,
 consumable, or the restroom 101 in general.

 [0071] It should be appreciated that the number and type of the sensors 112
 utilized in any given restroom or series of restrooms 101 may be varied
 depending on the desired accuracy, reliability, and cost of the system
 100. In addition, in one embodiment, the sensors 112 include sensor-level
 controllers or fixture 130-level controllers [not shown] disposed at that
 fixture 130 that provide varying types of control based upon the type of
 the fixture 130 or the sensor 112 associated therewith. Further, the
 types of the sensors 112 may be varied depending on the particular
 restroom&apos;s venue or usage. While the desired results to be achieved by
 the restroom convenience center system 100 will vary from user to user,
 FIG. 6 illustrates a table 610 including one estimate of benefits, needs,
 or requirements 630 according to the market 620. As can be seen, the
 importance of various aspects able to be addressed by the restroom
 convenience center system 100 vary from market to market.

 [0072] For example, an airport restroom sensor suite might include a
 presence sensor 150, such as for the automatic urinal 134 and the air
 quality sensor 156. This sensor suite might be chosen to optimize
 housekeeping efficiency since an airport typically contains a large
 number of the restrooms 101 typified by periods of high traffic followed
 by low or no traffic. Alternatively, a sensor suite for the restroom 101
 in an office building might include the door-positioned patron counter
 158 and the air quality sensor 156 to optimize the building&apos;s image and
 attention to detail. While not illustrated in FIG. 6, it should also be
 appreciated that there are other trends along which patterns can be drawn
 regarding desired restroom convenience center system 100 functionality
 that drives the particular configuration and level of consumables service
 of the restroom convenience center system 100 for a given installation.
 Gender, for example, may play an important role in certain installations.
 A woman&apos;s restroom may include sensors 112 for discerning the presence of
 liquid as compared to solid waste in a water closet 132, while a men&apos;s
 restroom may include sensors 112 for detecting users in operation of a
 waterless form of the urinals 134. Further, the sensors 112 utilized may
 be varied depending on the desired relative importance of various aspects
 of restroom configuration and maintenance.

 [0073] Turning now to illustrative non-limiting examples of the sensors 112
 that may be used with the present invention, one type of the sensor 112
 that may be used is a motion or presence detection sensor 150, such as an
 IR sensor see (FIG. 1). Typically this type of sensor provides a &quot;state&quot;
 indication, i.e. a target within the detection zone, yes or no. In
 combination with a clock mechanism, the presence sensors 150 may derive
 the length of time of the presence (or absence) of something in the
 detection zone. It should be appreciated that presence sensors 150 (see
 FIG. 3) are typically included in automatic actuation sensors such as
 those used to provide &quot;hands free&quot; flushing of the water closet 132 and
 the urinals 134 or &quot;hands free&quot; faucet and towel dispenser activation.
 Thus, many of the &quot;automatic&quot; fixtures 130 within modern commercial
 restrooms 101 already include sensors that can be used to provide data to
 the restroom convenience center system 100 in accordance with the present
 invention. For example, the presence sensor 150 may be associated with
 the water closet 132, the urinal 134, the faucets 136, the consumable
 dispenser 142, such a paper towel dispenser, or proximity near the
 entry/exit door. As has been previously mentioned, a portion of the
 fixture 130 may be associated with the sensors 112, as shown in FIG. 1
 or, alternatively, each of the fixtures 130 may be associated with the
 presence sensor 150, such as shown in FIG. 3. The presence sensor 150
 operates to detect when a valid target (user) enters a detection zone and
 then send a signal to actuate the device, typically either when the
 target enters the detection zone such as for the faucets 136 and
 consumable dispensers 142 or when the target leaves the detections zone
 for the water closet 132, the urinals 134, the faucet 136 or the
 entry/exit door.

 [0074] With continued reference to FIG. 1, one specific type of presence
 sensor 150 is a water closet automatic activation sensor 151 or urinal
 water closet automatic activation sensor 151 (collectively flushometer
 automatic activation sensor 151/152) associated with the urinal 134 or
 the water closet 132, respectively, that may provide information
 regarding absolute activations, absolute flow duration, periodic
 activations, periodic flow duration, status, message count, time of use
 and battery information. A further type of the presence sensor 150 is a
 faucet automatic activation sensor 153 that may provide absolute
 activations, absolute flow duration, periodic activations, periodic flow
 duration, time of use, status, message count, and battery information.

 [0075] Additional information is available from typical prior art sensors,
 such as total activations, battery status, battery door status, time of
 use, and battery contact status. For example, the restroom convenience
 center controller 110 can record a running total of activations for each
 flushometer, and will send alerts and notifications when the flushometer
 generally indicates that its battery is sub-nominal. A water closet
 automatic activation sensor 151 can record the number of flush valve
 activations at the particular water closet 132. The water closet
 automatic activation sensor 151 passes flush valve activation count
 information to the restroom convenience center controller 110 via, e.g.,
 a wireless link. Additionally, the water closet 132 flushometer automatic
 activation sensor 151 keeps a running count of the number of activations
 locally in some non volatile memory (or can also be sent to a centralized
 offsite memory in a control center.) Periodically, the water closet
 automatic activation sensor 151 will relay its absolute count information
 (as well as other use information, such as cumulative time of use) to the
 restroom convenience center controller 110. Alternatively, the
 flushometer automatic activation sensor 151/152 may provide a single
 output to the controller 110 when the count exceeds a predetermined
 threshold.

 [0076] In terms of the faucets 136, the restroom convenience center
 controller 110 supports collection of all available data from the faucets
 136, both battery-operated and hard-wired. Available data can include,
 for example, total run time, number of on/off water output cycles for
 each user, water flow (hot, cold, and/or total) and battery status. The
 restroom convenience center controller 110 records a running total of the
 run time for each of the faucets 136, and will send alerts and
 notifications when a battery-operated faucet 136 indicates that its
 battery is generally sub-optimal.

 [0077] A further type of the presence sensor 150, not used to trigger
 activation, may further be used in association with any one of the
 fixtures 130 to achieve an indication of usage of the fixture 130, time
 of use and projected time of availability, which can be used for
 notification to future users of the fixture 130 or even the wait time for
 all or one of the fixtures 130 for any given restroom 101. This may be of
 particular relevant for the fixture 130, such as waterless urinals or
 baby changing tables, where the usage does not require an &quot;activation&quot;
 and instead just a count and duration. It should further be appreciated
 that it may be desirable to position the presence sensors 150 where users
 may be utilizing the restroom 101, but not activating the fixture 130 or
 using consumables, such as someone merely standing at the sink to use the
 mirror or collecting a paper towel for personal use.

 [0078] Other types of the sensors 112 also fall within the spirit and scope
 of the invention. For example, a water flow sensor 160 is a sensor for
 measuring the flow of water through a given fixture 130 or supply line.
 Such the water flow sensor 160 may comprise a simple flow meter. Again
 with reference to FIG. 1, the sensor 112 may include the water flow
 sensor 160 associated with at least one water supply line [not shown] for
 the restroom 101, for example associated with a main water supply line
 and providing water to the restroom 101. The water flow sensor 160 may
 provide information regarding the absolute flow and the periodic flow.
 One such one of the water flow sensors 160 is described in, U.S. patent
 application Ser. Nos. 12/253,745 and 12/253,745 assigned to the present
 assignee. Not every one of the fixtures 130 necessarily needs a flow
 sensor; and indeed if a bank of the fixtures 130 has one connected
 upstream of the supply, this can enable narrowing down a leak problem to
 a very finite set of the fixture 130 on a common plumbing wall.

 [0079] Not every sensor 112 needs be directly associated with the fixture
 130. For example, the air quality sensor 156 may be utilized to provide
 data associated with the air quality within the restroom 101 or a portion
 of the restroom 101. While the figures and description generally describe
 the use of the single air quality sensor 156 per restroom 101 positioned
 to measure the general air quality of the space, it should be appreciated
 that one or more of the air quality sensors 156 could be positioned to be
 more highly correlated to space surrounding a particular fixture 130. The
 air quality sensor 156 may be configured to provide raw gas values and/or
 air quality values and also detect specific types of gases or air
 contamination.

 [0080] The restroom convenience center controller 110 can collect the air
 quality sensor 156 data from one or more of the air quality sensors 156
 installed in the restroom 101. Additionally, the restroom convenience
 center controller 110 has a provision for one locally-connected air
 quality sensor 156 although additional sensors 112 can be added via, for
 example, the ZigBee wireless network. The restroom convenience center
 controller 110 can also monitor the air quality sensor 156 levels and
 determine the overall air quality of the restroom 101 from this data. It
 should be noted that although the restroom convenience center controller
 110 does not need to retain the air quality sensor 156 historical data in
 memory, a system operator may configure the restroom convenience center
 controller 110 to export this data to an outside server or other internal
 separate unit for establishing profiles of certain parameters for future
 predictive use or for threshold evaluations.

 [0081] Another sensor that need not be associated with the given fixture
 130 is a patron counter 158. The patron counter 158 provides a &quot;count&quot; of
 the passage of an object, such as a user, through a given space. The
 Patron counters 158 are well known for being able to measure presence and
 direction of travel and may comprise the presence sensors 150, such as
 discussed above, or may be the sensors 112 such as those measuring &quot;door
 swings&quot; by capacitance or other means. Typically the patron counter 158
 will be positioned near an entrance or exit (but can be positioned for
 use with the water closet 132) so as to provide a count of individuals
 entering and/or leaving the restroom 101. The patron counter 158 may
 record an absolute count and/or a time period count.

 [0082] The patron counter 158 may be employed alone or in concert to
 ascertain traffic associated with the restroom as well as a usage
 thereof. For example, referring to FIG. 1, a patron counter 158 located
 at an entrance of the restroom 101 may give a count of a number of people
 entering and exiting the facility over a given period of time. For a
 given sampling period of time, the average length of time a person
 remains in the restroom can be determined. In addition, a second one of
 the patron counters 158 located at one or more other locations may be
 utilized to obtain a count of individuals that used the facility. For
 example, the patron counter 158 may be located at the faucets 136 or at
 doors of the water closet 132 or other locations. In the above manner,
 two types of data may be collected to give information relating to what
 percentage of people entering the restroom 101 actually use the water
 closet 132, etc., as opposed to, for example, simply using the mirror for
 grooming or other purposes. The average length of time for a given period
 of time of a person remaining in the restroom 101 can be compared to the
 average service time for each of the fixtures 130 and that comparison can
 dictate whether a person will experience a queue time (wait time) or not
 and even impact service time or scheduling action for that fixture. With
 more advanced modeling of the monitored times, probabilistic models can
 be simulated and effectuated in realtime to obtain more predictive
 expectations of how long a user may expect to wait and then output that
 information for display to the user.

 [0083] Yet another of the sensors 112 that may be utilized without
 associating specifically with the fixture 130 is a temperature sensor 162
 (FIG. 9). The temperature sensor 162 may be internal or external to the
 restroom 101 or both may be provided. Further, the temperature sensor 162
 may be a component of the HVAC system. Such information may be relevant
 to future service actions or provide predictive information as to the
 fixture 130 use and consumables replenishment (such as the outside
 temperature being extremely hot or cold resulting in changes of restroom
 use.

 [0084] As discussed regarding other aspects of the invention, the presence
 sensors 150 may include a time element for detecting the duration of a
 use (i.e. the duration of the presence detection). Other ones of the
 sensors 112 in the restroom 110 may include the sensors 112 employed to
 identify the presence of consumable supplies such as water closet paper,
 paper napkins, soap, and other products such as deodorizers and/or
 sanitizers.

 [0085] As was generally mentioned above regarding the data collection by
 the DCU 210, the timing of data collection may vary depending on
 information source 111. For example, the patron call device 173 for a
 patron and the tamper switch or sensor 181 may provide asynchronous data
 collection, sending a signal to the DCU 210 whenever they are
 &quot;activated&quot;. However, the air quality sensor 156 and the temperature
 sensor 162 may provide data in regular time intervals. Further, the data
 may be provided as a &quot;pull&quot; by the controller 110 from the information
 source 111 or &quot;push&quot; from the information source 111 to the controller
 110.

 [0086] Although a single one of the sensors 112 is illustrated in FIG. 1 as
 being associated with a given fixture 130, and the present application
 generally refers to sensor in the singular when referring to the
 sensorization of a single fixture 130, it should be appreciated that
 multiple sensors 112 having differing functions may be employed on the
 given fixture 130, as may be desired. In one example, each water supply
 line (not shown) associated with the individual water closet 132 or the
 urinal 134 may also have the water flow sensor 160 associated therewith
 to measure the volume of water (as opposed merely to the activation of
 the water closet 132 or the urinal 134 by the water flow sensor 160).

 [0087] In addition, each of the sensors 112 may include the ability to
 &quot;discern&quot; more than one aspect of the restroom 101. For example, the
 sensor 112 may include a number of individual sensor units spaced
 together or apart. For example, it may be desirous to use multiple patron
 counters 158 to form a larger detection area within a singular restroom
 101. In addition, some of the sensors 112 may provide additional data
 that relates to more than one aspect of the restroom 101. One example
 would be the air quality sensor 156. In certain embodiments, the air
 quality sensor 156 not only provides an output signal proportional to the
 summation of a broad class of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), but it
 is possible to extract timing information from the output signal that can
 be used for pattern recognition. The VOC output signal in combination
 with the extracted timing information and pattern recognition can be used
 to predict and discriminate activities such as cigarette smoking from
 other VOC generating events.

 [0088] In another illustrative example, as previously discussed, the flush
 valve of the fixture 130 may have the sensor 112 that can provide an
 indication of when an individual is present, when they have left, and how
 long they were present in addition to when the flush valve is triggered.
 For a flush valve associated with the presence sensor 150, data gathered
 may include the occurrence of a complete flush cycle, the manner of
 actuation, i.e. manual or automatic, the type of flush selected, such as
 a partial flush or a full flush, and the length of time the presence or
 actual use was detected, such as to indicate either solid (longer time)
 or liquid (shorter time) waste in the water closet 132. Further, based on
 the type of sensor 112 employed, various differing states associated with
 the fixture 130 may be monitored, such as &quot;standby&quot; (no valid target/user
 within the detection zone), &quot;armed&quot; (valid target/user detected), and
 &quot;flushed&quot; or &quot;activated&quot; (user is serviced and leaves the detection zone)
 for the water closet 132 or the urinal 134. In addition, a timer may be
 used, such as equivalent to the &quot;armed time&quot; of automatic activation
 sensors, to provide information regarding the length of time a user is
 &quot;present&quot; at the water closet 132, the urinal 134, the faucet 136, the
 consumable dispenser 142 or other restroom device. This time value can be
 used to generate &quot;service&quot; or use time for that particular fixture 130.
 Collecting and analyzing the service times for a particular user
 population time span can be analyzed within the system software to
 predict or to report status of the asset and to anticipate service needs.
 This reporting can be for maintenance scheduling or for signaling users
 as to the wait status they may encounter by using the restroom 101 or any
 selected one of the fixtures 130 of their choosing.

 [0089] In certain embodiments, the predictive aspects of the invention
 described below may be used to predict the state of one of the restroom
 101 from the sensor data from another. In such an embodiment, it is
 preferable that the &quot;dependent&quot; restroom 101 include at least one sensor
 112 of the same type as the primary restroom 101, such as a patron
 counter 158, to allow for normalization and benchmarking between the two
 restrooms. This capability can enable reduction of sensor 112 needed and
 simplify service action.

 B . Peripheral Devices

 [0090] The restroom convenience center controller 110, as described above,
 is able to accept input from stakeholders for various purposes and shown
 generally in FIGS. 2 and 9. The restroom 101 control system, in one
 embodiment, further comprises a patron call device 173 for the purpose of
 indicating an unsatisfactory condition in the restroom 101 e.g., an alarm
 notification upon a user activation thereof. The input to the restroom
 convenience center controller 110 can be effectuated via a simple
 momentary input, e.g., a switch or touchless sensor. Alternatively, voice
 input such as via recording a patron voice message or a &quot;live&quot; chat with
 an operator can also be implemented. Therefore, when a patron activates
 the patron call device 173 (FIG. 1) input, the restroom convenience
 center controller 110 assumes that an unsatisfactory condition now
 exists, unknown to owner, in the restroom 101 and that service is
 required. The restroom convenience center controller 110 can additionally
 dispatch any notifications or alarms that would be required because of
 this action. The restroom convenience center controller 110 can also
 record the timestamp of all patron activations and export this
 information to an outside server, e.g., the restroom convenience center
 controller 110 server, on a periodic basis.

 [0091] The patron call device 173 may also include a confirmation aspect,
 such that a user must confirm the activation to avoid accidental or prank
 patron calls. In one example, the patron call device 173 is generic and
 simply indicates a user need in the restroom 101. In another alternative,
 the patron call device 173 contains multiple buttons or indicators and a
 graphical user interface, and is configured to send data relating to
 specific requests, for example, a maintenance request, a supply
 replenishment request, or a medical emergency. In one embodiment, the
 system 100 is configured to monitor the status of a patron call, such as
 patron calls not yet confirmed, response status for confirmed patron
 calls, and historical number of patron calls.

 [0092] It should also be noted that the restroom convenience center
 controller 110 or individual sensors within the restroom 101 can include
 or be locally connected to one or more of the tamper sensors 181. The
 tamper sensor or switch 181 can detect when an outer casing of the
 restroom convenience center controller 110 is removed or otherwise
 tampered with and effectuate an alarm condition or notification.

 [0093] In a further embodiment, a janitor and/or maintenance interface 172
 is provided. The restroom convenience center controller 110 can accept
 input from a standard radio-frequency (RF) contactless card reader to
 allow individual janitorial staff to indicate that the restroom 101 has
 been serviced. If a janitor activates the card reader, the restroom
 convenience center controller 110 assumes that any previously indicated
 unsatisfactory conditions have been resolved, and that consumable
 resupply has occurred. In one embodiment, the restroom convenience center
 controller 110 records the time, duration, and identity of all janitorial
 visits and exports this information to an outside server on a periodic
 basis as well.

 [0094] In one embodiment, the janitor and/or maintenance interface 172
 (FIGS. 2 and 9), described above is used to create the electronic version
 of a &quot;restroom serviced&quot; clipboard displayable on a graphical user
 interface, such a LUI 180. When a janitor activates the interface 172,
 the date and time is recorded. When the janitor completes servicing the
 restroom 101, the janitor interface 172 is reactivated thereby creating a
 record of the duration of service personnel visit. Additionally, the
 janitor interface 172 can record the identity of the servicing janitor. A
 method for recording the service provided by the maintenance personnel
 (i.e. general re-supply, cleaning, etc.) is also provided. The ability to
 reset predictive algorithms to a baseline condition based on re-supply by
 maintenance personnel is provided as well, in addition to the ability to
 enter actual consumables inventory for fine tuning of predictive
 re-supply algorithms.

 [0095] Further, the LUI 180 may be provided within the restroom 101. The
 LUI 180 can provide an interface for patrons and/or servicing personnel,
 such as janitors, access to the restroom convenience center controller
 110 for reporting certain conditions as described above. Thus, the LUI
 180 may serve as the patron call device 173 and the janitor login
 interface 172. In addition, the LUI 180 can be utilized when configuring
 the restroom convenience center controller 110 via, e.g., a laptop
 computer, PDA, or other processor. For example, patrons can utilize the
 LUI 180 to indicate that the particular restroom fixture 130 or asset
 needs servicing or attention in accordance with a patron-specific LUI 180
 screen, while another LUI 180 screen can be displayed when a janitor
 accesses the restroom convenience center controller 110. That is, when a
 janitor accesses the restroom convenience center controller 110, an
 electronic &quot;restroom service&quot; clipboard can appear.

 C . Restroom Convenience Center System Operation

 [0096] The sensors 112, communications pathways, and the restroom
 convenience center controller 110 function to provide stakeholders with
 information regarding the historic, current, and predicted conditions in
 the restroom 101. Although the methods and functionality are illustrated
 and described below as a series of acts or events, it will be appreciated
 that the present invention is not limited by the illustrated ordering of
 such acts, events, or functionality. For example, some acts may occur in
 different orders and/or concurrently with other acts or events apart from
 those illustrated and/or described herein, in accordance with the
 invention. In addition, not all illustrated functionality may be required
 to implement a methodology or system in accordance with the present
 invention. The methods of the present invention, moreover, may be
 implemented in association with the devices illustrated and described
 herein as well as in association with other devices and systems not
 illustrated and utilize various combinations of components.

 [0097] Various stakeholders have been previously discussed in regard to
 interactions and usage of the restroom convenience center system 100.
 FIG. 7 illustrates one non-exhaustive list of stakeholders and the
 information provided by the restroom convenience center system 100 to
 and/or used by those stakeholders, including building owner/operations
 801, building maintenance personal 702, patrons 703,
 janitorial/housekeeping 704, government agencies 705, manufacturer 706.

 [0098] More specifically, FIGS. 8A and 8B are detailed diagrams
 representative of various actions, events, and/or interactions that are
 contemplated in accordance with various embodiments. The stakeholders
 illustrated in FIGS. 8A and 8B are the patron 703, facility operations
 701, facility maintenance 702, restroom convenience center system 100
 manufacturing 706, restroom convenience center system maintainers 850,
 janitorial 704, and information sources 111. It should be noted that
 although FIGS. 8A and 8B represent human actors, such roles can comprise
 systems and devices, e.g., facility operations can be personnel as well
 as facility operations management systems.

 [0099] FIG. 8A illustrates various actors and/or roles that may interact
 and be associated with restroom convenience center system 100 described
 herein in accordance with various embodiments, wherein such activities
 can be considered to be frequently performed. In the embodiment of FIG.
 8A patrons 703, for example, can interact by way of service requests. It
 should be appreciated also that patrons 703 will interact with the
 restroom convenience center system 100 though their use of sensorized
 portions of the restroom 101, such as the urinals 134 or the faucets 136.
 Additionally, patrons&apos; 703 actions can be directed and/or motivated by
 announcements, directions, etc., to, for example, move on to a different
 restroom facility due to long wait times being anticipated for use of the
 restroom 101 or the fixture 130 being disabled or wait times for the
 fixtures 130 being excessive. Facilities operations activities include:
 handle alarms, information processing (such as a predictive maintenance
 report, resupply forecasting report, and predictive resupply and air
 quality alarms and reports), alarm configuration, algorithm
 configuration, service report, LEED compliance report, system reset, and
 system configuration.

 [0100] Facility maintenance activities may include: system reset, system
 configuration, system diagnostics, device calibration, algorithm
 calibration, and device commissioning restroom convenience center system
 100 manufacturing activities include executing code testing and updating
 programs such as by flashing memory. Those monitoring the restroom
 convenience center system 100 may also perform updates to the
 programming.

 [0101] Janitorial activities include responding to service calls and
 regular service of the restroom 101, but of which may involve the janitor
 login function. The restroom 101 devices, such as the fixtures 130, and
 other services devices also may interact with the restroom convenience
 center system 100 to perform activities such as receiving set points,
 sending data and timestamps, alarming generation, device calibration, and
 device commissioning. The NOL 510, independent system integrators 881 and
 BAS 882 all provide information gateway activities.

 [0102] Those activities that are likely to occur less frequently are
 illustrated in FIG. 8B. For example, the patron may perform prank service
 requests or tamper with the restroom convenience center system 100. The
 facility operations and facility maintenance may experience a loss of
 HVAC, lighting, water pressure, communication, or power. The restroom
 convenience center system 100 manufacturing and restroom convenience
 center system 100 maintainers may experience a failure of the program
 updating. The janitorial staff also may forget to utilize the janitor
 login interface 172 or the login may result in an unknown or unauthorized
 entry. The restroom 101 devices may experience component failure or,
 particularly in the case of wireless devices, intermittent data
 transmission or total communication failure. Likewise, the NOC 510,
 independent system integrators 881, and BAS 882 may experience
 communication failure.

 [0103] Thus, each stakeholder has certain activities and interactions with
 the restroom convenience center system 100, including potentially
 problematic interactions or indications that can be addressed by the
 restroom convenience center system 100. For example, the restroom
 convenience center system 100 can sense and respond to patrons that
 tamper with the restroom convenience center controller 110 and/or the
 fixtures 130, the sensors 112, the counters 158, etc. As described above,
 the restroom convenience center controller 110 can also distinguish
 between real and &quot;prank&quot; or accidental service requests. Additionally,
 through the use of the restroom convenience center system 100, facility
 operations and maintenance personnel or systems can be apprised of and
 respond to a loss in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)
 services, loss of lighting, loss of water pressure, communication
 failures, and power failures (e.g., to the restroom convenience center
 controller 110). Restroom convenience center controller 110 manufacturing
 and maintenance personnel can perform code testing and program updating
 with regard to, for example the restroom convenience center controller
 110. Janitors on the other hand, can respond to service calls or simply
 being routine and regular service, and log such service by way of swiping
 a smart card (or other identifying device). Additionally, janitorial
 staff that either forgot to swipe their card or result in unauthorized
 entry/unknown identity can also be sensed and addressed in the restroom
 convenience center system 100. Interactive Stakeholders, such as NOC 510
 operators, building automation system (BAS) operators 881, and/or
 independent system integrators 882 can access the restroom convenience
 center system 100 via some manner of information gateway (e.g., embedded
 web pages, LAN connection, etc.) For example, if the updating program
 function (via flashing the memory) fails, restroom convenience center
 controller maintainers 850 and/or manufacturing personnel 706 can
 interact therewith. In addition, the restroom fixtures 130 can interact
 with the restroom convenience center system 100 via the use thereof,
 where set points can be received, data and timestamps of such usage or
 determined and transmitted, alarm and/or notification generation. It
 should be noted that the calibration of algorithms, device calibration,
 as well as device commissioning can be effected by or in response to
 usage. Moreover, failed or intermittent communications with and the
 failure of wired information sources 214 and wireless devices 215 can be
 sensed and addressed as well.

 [0104] Whereas FIGS. 1 and 3 illustrated overview diagrams of a restroom
 101 and its respective elements, e.g., the restroom fixture 130, the
 sensors 112, activators, etc., FIG. 9 is a more detailed illustration of
 the elements, users/service staff, communications aspects, and
 interactions there between. FIG. 9 illustrates a restroom convenience
 center controller 110 as the &quot;hub&quot; of the restroom 101. Certain of the
 peripheral devices 113 and/or the sensors 112 are shown to be connected
 to the restroom convenience center controller 110, e.g., the patron
 counter 158, plumbing devices, temperature sensor 162, the tamper sensor
 or switch 181, and the air quality sensor 156 being hardwired to the
 restroom convenience center controller 110 and a second one of the air
 quality sensors 156 being wirelessly connected thereto. Additionally,
 various bathroom controls and machine-to-machine links to external
 systems are shown with respect to the restroom convenience center
 controller 110.

 D . Restroom Convenience Center System Operation--Capturing Sensor Data

 [0105] In the broadest sense, the sensors 112 employed within the restroom
 101 and/or the fixture 130 controllers pre-assigned functions by
 monitoring, and/or sensing one or more first pieces of data therein at
 1004 (FIG. 10). For example, a patron counter 158 (see FIG. 1) is
 operable to identify a traffic amount within the restroom 101 to generate
 a count associated therewith. A presence sensor 150 is operable to
 identify when the water closet 132 or the urinal 134 is flushed to
 likewise generate a count (and also timing information as described
 herein). As described herein, timing information can also be collected
 and used for user information and predictive purposes as well which will
 be further described hereinafter.

 [0106] As illustrated in FIG. 10, the sensor 112 sends the data associated
 therewith to a respective restroom convenience center controller 110 in a
 series of steps. At step 1002, the sensors 112 are initialized. At step
 1004, the sensor is actively monitoring the restroom 101. At step 1006,
 sensed data is sent to the controller 110. At step 1008, the status
 condition is communicated based on an analysis of the sensed data. At
 step 1010, an alarm is sent. At step 1012, operations parameters are
 issued. At step 1014, data is stored. The restroom convenience center
 controller 110 is configured to receive such data and through the use of
 predictive algorithms, heuristics, and/or inferential statistics applied
 to the data, infer information, such as a status condition of the
 restroom 101 associated with the respective functions at 1008.

 [0107] In one embodiment, the sensor data is brought into the restroom
 convenience center system 100 using a selected media and protocol, but
 the sensor&apos;s functional profile remains the same with the data being
 &quot;normalized&quot; when it is stored in memory. An application programming
 interface (API) can then be used to flatten out the hierarchical
 representation of the sensor data to ease the burden of application
 development. This embodiment provides for improved speed of application
 development and flexible and modular communication options due to the
 normalized data forms used for the sensor data. A program needing access
 to the data from the sensors 112, such as to make probabilistic
 predictions described below, would access only the required parameters
 rather than a sensor&apos;s full functional profile variable set. The sensor
 and device data formats may be defined by a schema. The &quot;flattened&quot;
 sensor data may be provided as &quot;Meta&quot; data to an application, simplifying
 the need for tedious parsing operations.

 [0108] The status condition can thus be considered to be indicative of a
 need for at least one corrective measure and is communicated, such as to
 the NOC 510, a cell phone, PDA, computer workstation, or other devices,
 wherein such status conditions can initiate the transmission of a fault
 or alarm notification (actionable or informational), one or more
 operating parameters, or a data report relating to use or traffic in the
 restroom 101 at a given time or over a period of time.

 [0109] In one embodiment, information regarding changes over time are
 utilized as well as static &quot;snap-shots&quot; regarding the state of the
 restroom 101. For example, the air quality sensor 156 may detect a high
 VOC level. This may be predictive of either usage of high water volumes
 by the water closet 132 or may be predictive of a clogged form of the
 water closet 132. Thus, to discriminate between the events of the example
 above (high VOC associated with usage vs. a clogged bowl) logic may be
 used. For instance, one method would be to first examine the rate of
 change associated with the air quality sensors 156. Next it would be
 valuable to know whether the restroom 101 is currently occupied, such as
 from the state of the presence sensors 150. An examination of the time
 stamps for multiple flushes might also help to discriminate between a
 legitimate air quality sensor 156 event in the making vs. a clogged bowl.
 It should be appreciated that a combination of logic, statistics, and
 pattern recognition can be combined to provide a high probability of
 forecasting the state based on indirect sensor inputs. This type of
 timing analysis also is applicable to other of the fixtures 130 in the
 restroom 101.

 [0110] Based on the received data, the controller 110 is further operable
 to ascertain and communicate a status condition associated with the
 various monitored functions. For certain data, the restroom convenience
 center controller 110 may include a &quot;threshold&quot; value for which the
 respective sensor data is accumulated until the respective threshold is
 exceeded and a status condition is determined. Thus, the state table 1200
 (FIGS. 12A-C), discussed below, is not utilized to determine the state of
 the restroom 101 until the appropriate values for each of the sensors 112
 are reached. Thus, values corresponding to different time windows may be
 combined when determining the state. In one embodiment, the controller
 110 is operably coupled to the one or more sensors 112, and configured to
 receive first states data therefrom associated with a first set of
 features, which the sensors 112 monitor, to determine second state data
 associated with a second set of features not necessarily monitored.

 E . Threshold

 [0111] In one embodiment, the restroom convenience center controller 110
 estimates the future state of the restroom 101, or the fixtures 130 or
 other features or components within the restroom 101, by determining the
 current state of the restroom 101 or the components therein and
 evaluating such current state information over time. One manner of
 determining the current state is through the use of a state table 1200.
 The process of populating the state table may vary widely depending on
 the specifics of the application. For example, for purposes of
 consistency, a fast food restaurant chain may want all the restroom
 convenience center system 100 state tables to operate strictly in
 accordance with a set policy or combination of policies. This is in
 contrast to an application such as an airport where responsiveness to
 prioritized needs drives a requirement for the system to be adaptive. In
 the former case, an application would simply compare the normalized
 sensor data with the &quot;pre-determined&quot; table of allowable states complete
 with pre-determined thresholds and weightings. The latter case will
 involve conventional and well known stochastic methods and predictive
 models, such as the finite Markov chain. Markov is a stochastic
 methodology which predicts a future action based upon existing data and
 probabilities of future states. If a restroom is at state 5 according to
 FIG. 12 patron visits are very high and a patron call button has alarmed.
 In a Markov decision chain a change state can be decided by several
 approaches concerning the probability of those approaches, In state 5 a.)
 the patron visits could reduce and no further patron calls will be
 experienced, or b.) the patron visits will remain at the present rate OR
 increase without a further patron call received. The actual probability
 for each of the above (as well as others that can be considered) can be
 estimated and a decision/action made based upon the probabilities. As can
 be seen, as more system data is accumulated and processed, information
 about traffic patterns at specific times can affect the probability that
 patron visits will reduce simply because the system has learned the new
 information and it was extrapolated in the probability. Also see the data
 of FIGS. 22A-22D and 23A-23D, which show the behavior of such patron
 visits, and a look up table can be utilized for performing the above
 described Markov decision process. Using such known stochastic methods,
 it should be possible to predict the restroom 101 state at a future point
 with higher accuracy occurring over time. The state table 1200 includes a
 list of states 1210, sensor data 1220, and the response 1230
 corresponding to the state. While the state table 1200 of FIGS. 12A-C
 includes 64 possible states, it should be appreciated the possible states
 are a function of the number of inputs and also that using a similar
 technique to a Karnaugh-map they can be factored down into a lesser set
 of discrete response scenarios. Fuzzy logic may be applied to the data
 contained in the state table that takes into account prior states,
 trending, and predicted next state.

 [0112] It should be appreciated that a wide variety of factors may exhibit
 a correlation, to one degree or another, with the &quot;state&quot; of the restroom
 101, a portion of the restroom 101, or a consumable within the restroom
 101. For a given installation, it is desirable to utilize the fewest
 number of the sensors 112 necessary to provide the desired levels
 accuracy and precision in predicting future states of the restroom 101.

 [0113] Thus, in one embodiment, the system 100 is configured to utilize a
 wide variety of information to determine the appropriate state table 1200
 reflective of the restroom 101 and/or the facility as a whole. It should
 be appreciated that any combination of information may be used to
 establish the thresholds and state table and that some measure of
 increased accuracy of the predictions can be achieved the more
 information is used. Such information may include useful data relating to
 the restroom 101, including layout, location within a building relative
 to patron traffic and content, to the general user, including gender and
 age, to the facility in which the restroom 101 is located, including
 purpose such as school or office building and layout such as whether the
 restroom 101 is located near a lunch room or other heavy patron traffic
 and relating to external factors such as temperature and calendar date or
 other external factors which are particularly significant or unusual days
 of the year or widespread illness of users (of which all the above
 parameters can be entered into the system predictive function) indicative
 of predictable use level information. Such information may further
 include baseline statistical predictions or sensor data such as how long
 a typical user (both male and female) washes their hands following a
 solid waste event as compared to a liquid waste event or the air quality
 sensor 156 output that corresponds to cigarette smoke or various other
 gases that may be present in the restroom 101.

 [0114] The information may correlate to a known impact on the state table
 1200, thresholds, or algorithms of the present invention. Table 1
 provides nonlimiting examples of such correlations all of which can be
 established with statistical methods for predictive future use.

 [0115] The state table 1200 for a school will likely be very different than
 the state table for a similarly sized office building or athletic stadium
 and other different facilities. For instance, the school&apos;s state table
 might contain lower thresholds and higher weightings for VOC detection
 than the office building. Installation parameters such as gender, venue,
 etc. affect the thresholds, weighting, ratios and other aspects of the
 state table. A higher visits/hand wash ratio at a restaurant might result
 in a more aggressive consumable replenishment threshold in the state
 table than a restroom located in a public park. FIG. 6 illustrates a
 table 610 including one possible set of benefits, needs, or requirements
 630 for various markets 620. It will be appreciated that such factors may
 be varied and FIG. 6 is provided as a non-limiting example.

 [0116] One of the configuration parameters available for building the state
 table involves entering a facility schedule for normal operations,
 holidays, special events and for occurrence of characterizable sudden
 events, such as arrival of a multiple number of airplanes at one area of
 an airport when the scheduled times were spaced apart. Such a &quot;state&quot;
 could statistically project the increased level of patron use and prepare
 and service the restroom 101 accordingly. Since the operation of the
 restroom convenience center system 100 will be implemented as a state
 machine, a heavy usage condition or a situation where the available
 resources are unable to service the backlog, the restroom convenience
 center system 100 will transition for the normal operation state to one
 of several off-normal states to begin redirecting patrons or other
 pertinent actions. This off-normal state will prioritize requests among
 several restroom convenience center system 100 to service the restroom
 101 is in the order of worst need first.

 [0117] FIGS. 17-19 generally depict specific exemplary embodiments of logic
 that maybe used with the present invention. FIG. 17 illustrates a method
 1700 of configuring and setting up the state table 1200 and thresholds
 for use in a particular installation. At step 1701 empirical data is
 entered and at step 1702 installation parameters are entered, at step
 1703, the empirical data and installation parameters are utilized to
 generate initial states with weightings and threshold for predicting
 desired states or consumable levels in the restroom 101. The generated
 data may be further modified by manual adjustment via the LUI or embedded
 web pages. At step 1705, this generated information is stored in a
 memory. The generated data may be exported at step 1706 or proceed to
 step 1805 of FIG. 18.

 [0118] Turning now to FIG. 18, one embodiment of a main operation logic
 1800 of the restroom convenience center system 100 is depicted. At step
 1801, restroom sensor data is acquired. At step 1802, a remove protocol
 is performed and the data is transported and formatted. At step 1803, the
 sensor data is stored pursuant to a predetermined schema. At step 1804,
 the state table is populated for the current state. At step 1805, the
 current state is compared to the acceptable state. At step 1806, a
 decision is made regarding whether the current state is acceptable. If it
 is, the system 100 returns to step 1801. If not, then the results are
 analyzed at step 1807. Alarms are processed at step 1808 and the
 acceptable state table is updated at step 1809.

 [0119] Turning now to FIG. 19, an alternative embodiment is depicted
 illustrating a method of operation 1900. Sensor/consumable correlation
 data, empirical data, and site-specific experience are gathered at steps
 1901-1903 respectively. At step 1904, the desired state definition is
 developed. At step 1905, a model of the current state is predicted. At
 step 1906, a determination is made regarding if visits are greater then a
 predetermined threshold for consumable replenishment. At step 1907, a
 determination is made regarding if faucet activations are greater then a
 predetermined threshold for consumable replenishment. At step 1908, a
 determination is made regarding if water closet activations are greater
 then a predetermined threshold for consumable replenishment. At step
 1909, a determination is made regarding if urinal activations are greater
 then a predetermined threshold for consumable replenishment. At step
 1910, the weighting and correlation factors are applied to sensor
 threshold of steps 1906-1909. At step 1911, warnings, alarms, and
 reporting are implemented based upon the weighting, correlation, and
 threshold. Realtime sensor data is gathered at step 1912 and the system
 100 returns to step 1905.

 [0120] Turning to specific factors that may impact the state table and
 probability determinations, factors that may impact the predictability of
 the state for the given fixture 130 are the location of the fixture 130
 within the restroom 101, the overall layout of the restroom 101, the
 traffic pattern within the restroom 101 and the occurrence of high volume
 patron traffic due to a special event or a sudden influx of traffic, such
 as an unexpected coincidence of plane arrivals at an airport not in
 accordance with the regular schedule. For example, for the restroom 101
 layout shown in FIG. 1, it may be determined, either through prior
 experience, actual observations or accumulated statistical data
 associated with use of the instant restroom layout and location that
 patrons tend to use the first faucet more frequently due to that first
 faucet being located nearer to a restroom door or more proximate
 dispensers of consumables. Thus, such information can also be factored
 into the above-described conventional and well known statistical
 algorithm or heuristics to further enhance the predictability of when the
 soap dispenser 142 associated with that first faucet 136 will be
 depleted. Therefore, the restroom convenience center controller 110
 configuration can also utilize and take into account a Cartesian mapping
 (method of identifying location of fixtures within a drawn restroom grid)
 of the restroom fixture 130 and probabilistic models of the restroom
 fixture 130 usage. Moreover, with the minimal addition or utilization of
 the patron counter 158, the direct data can be utilized by the restroom
 convenience center controller 110, for example, to also predict when the
 restroom fixture 130, such as the aforementioned faucets 136 are likely
 to be occupied and thus determine information that can be utilized to
 direct patrons to, for example, an unseen faucet 136 in the restroom 101
 facility or another restroom 101 altogether that may be currently
 experiencing less patron traffic/usage. Hence, patrons&apos; behavior can be
 anticipated as well as modified/directed to maximize the usage of an
 asset or alternative restroom facilities without a risk of a monitoring
 system being overly intrusive from the perspective of the patrons.

 [0121] In one embodiment, patron call information may be used for quality
 control purposes, or may further be used to dynamically alter thresholds
 for supplies and maintenance requests. For example, if it is determined
 that an average response time for supply replenishment requests is 20
 minutes, the threshold at which at an automated request is generated may
 be altered to ensure that future replenishment occurs prior to the
 supplies being exhausted, thereby minimizing future manual patron
 requests. In the above manner, the controller 110 may better predict how
 to service various needs associated with the restroom 101.

 [0122] In one embodiment, restroom traffic is monitored as the primary
 predictor and driver of the state table determinations, for example,
 using the patron counters 158 as the sensors 112 in one or more locations
 within the restroom 101. In one example, usage is defined differently
 than traffic in the restroom 101 because not all patrons who enter the
 restroom 101 use a water closet 132, or the faucet 136, but instead many
 enter for grooming purposes, and thus are not necessarily consuming
 supplies (i.e., using one of the restroom fixtures 130). Consequently, in
 another aspect of the invention, the restroom controller 110 or the
 global command unit may take the restroom traffic data and usage data and
 generate use/traffic historical profiles and use such data to generate
 usage thresholds or use such data for other purposes, as may be desired.

 [0123] In one example, an air quality sensor 156 senses the presence of a
 volatile/offensive gas or compound. If no flushing of a water closet 132
 or urinal is sensed for an appropriate time span, the restroom
 convenience center controller 110 may infer that a patron has entered the
 restroom 101 and is smoking a cigarette therein or otherwise causing
 generation of unwanted gases. In another example, a representative
 fixture 130, such as the faucet 136 may have a presence sensor 150
 associated therewith, while the adjacent fixture 130 does not. Upon
 receiving a certain number of counts from the faucet sensor 153, the
 restroom convenience center controller 110 can apply, as described
 herein, a conventional and well known predictive algorithm in conjunction
 with comparing the count to a predetermined number of counts to determine
 to a sufficient degree of probability that, for example, paper towels
 need to be replenished. Further, such data can be analyzed in combination
 with external data, such as the day being that of a special event having
 a time dependent rising profile, or a sudden notice of a statistically
 large event, such as numerous off schedule air flights have arrived
 together at an airport, to enable service action to be taken in
 accordance with predictive determinations for such an event.

 [0124] Turning now to a specific example of a state table, FIGS. 12A-C
 shows a state table which can be utilized in accordance with various
 embodiments to determine appropriate actions that can or should be taken
 in response to the generated, indirect or inferential data described
 above. FIGS. 12A-C illustrates a plurality of states that can be
 experienced in relation to thresholds or occurrence of statistically
 significant events that are surpassed with respect to various sensors
 112, or in combination with incoming data notices, in a restroom
 facility. It should be appreciated that FIGS. 12A-C are used for
 illustrative purposes and that the invention is not limited to the types
 or quantity of sensors 112 listed in the state table of FIGS. 12A-C.
 Further, it should be appreciated that a state table in accordance with
 the present invention may be sized so as to correspond with the number of
 sensor inputs or may be compacted by various methods to reducing the
 total number of potential states.

 [0125] The state table allows for a determination of the current state of
 the restroom 101 given a set of indications from sensors 112. For
 example, if the water closet 132 sensor 112 is activated x number of
 times for a given time period and for the particular statistical
 conditions occurring for the restroom 101, the restroom convenience
 center controller 110 determines whether x surpasses a predetermined
 threshold set for an allowable number of activations before requiring
 service based on an average number of times a water closet 132 is
 supposed to be flushed for a particular period of time (and for the known
 statistical conditions at that time). If x does surpass the predetermined
 threshold, it may be assumed that, for example, a patron is repeatedly
 attempting to flush the water closet 132 due to the water closet 132
 becoming clogged (or is deliberately causing repeated water use for
 inappropriate purposes). Hence, the restroom convenience center
 controller 110 can access the sensor state and response matrix and
 determine that the current state, i.e., state 8 (FIGS. 12A-C), requires
 that servicing personnel respond by inspecting the water closet 132 for
 potential equipment failure and/or abuse. It should be noted that a
 plurality of combinations and states beyond those illustrated in FIGS.
 12A-C can be implemented in the sensor state and response matrix.
 Moreover, as mentioned above regarding the particular conditions, the
 different thresholds that might trigger one or more responses can be
 customized depending on the size, location, predicted demographic, e.g.,
 men or women, and predicted frequency of use of the restroom 101 facility
 and/or restroom fixture 130 therein, among other factors (such as
 described above).

 [0126] A fixture 130 that is explicitly included in the make up of the
 system state table can be based upon actual counts, should that
 capability exist, or inferred data calculated from another fixture 130
 proximate to the first with the inferred count adjusted by physical
 position and occupancy quotient.

 [0127] Based on the sensor data and analyses described herein, well known
 predictive algorithms based on conventional statistical methods can be
 used to estimate the percentage of consumables depleted or the need for
 preventative maintenance, etc. An alarm is dispatched to the configured
 recipient destinations when the estimated percentage exceeds a configured
 level. The algorithm is reset when consumables are restocked, such as
 when an input is provided (manually or automatically via a key-card type
 system or via RF tags on the consumables). The level of consumables
 within each restroom 101 may be tracked. In addition, the restroom
 convenience center 100 may track the total consumable stock (such as at a
 building), such that consumables (or maintenance parts) can be ordered
 automatically when supply is below a threshold. In one embodiment, the
 estimated percentage of maximum inventory is provided to the restroom
 convenience center controller 110 via web page configuration. An easy
 means is provided to indicate 100% consumable restocking. A means is also
 provided to indicate less than 100% restocking levels.

 [0128] The restroom convenience center controller 110 monitors an
 accumulated value particular to each type of the fixture 130 or device.
 The values are monitored until they meet configured criteria. Accumulated
 values are manually reset (via web page interaction or interaction with
 an interface in the restroom 101, such as a janitor login interface 172
 providing an input to the controller 110 denoting restocking) when
 equipment maintenance or equipment replacement is performed. There may be
 multiple accumulated values per multiple devices. When the criteria are
 met, the alarm type, device identifier, restroom convenience center
 controller 110 identifier, alarm trigger criteria, alarm time, and
 equipment ID are reported to a configured recipient. Possible values of
 monitored parameters are: water total flow, device duty cycles, device
 activations, device time in service, number of service calls, facility
 temperature, particular users of the site in view of special events or
 particular days in the year and even other factors such as widespread
 illness or unusual weather conditions. In one embodiment, a report
 presenting the current value of all devices&apos; accumulated values and
 threshold is available via a web page, as discussed further below.

 [0129] In other words, data can be collected with respect to
 already-existing sensors 112 that are conventionally utilized to sense
 the presence of a target user and for example, turn an associated fixture
 130, such as the faucet 136, on or off. Whereas the conventional sensors
 112 and restroom facility &quot;systems&quot; merely utilize a disjointed series of
 the sensors 112 to automate the fixture 130 operation, various
 embodiments described herein can extrapolate the on/off data to
 predictively ascertain useful information when correlated with at least
 relative time data and other sensor data correlated therewith. For
 example, various embodiments gather a number of times that the first
 faucet sensor 153 goes on and off. Such data can be combined/aggregated
 with time data that is relative to, e.g., a predetermined average time
 that a restroom user takes to wash his/her hands. This
 combined/aggregated data can then be applied to one or more predictive
 algorithms to determine with sufficient specificity, when soap dispensers
 associated with the faucets 136 and the first faucet 136 need to be
 replenished. That is, &quot;direct&quot; data, e.g., the on/off sensor data, can be
 utilized to extrapolate and/or predict &quot;indirect&quot; data, e.g., when one or
 more soap dispensers in the same restroom facility will likely be
 consumed and thus require replenishing.

 [0130] For example, one embodiment may set the usage value for the toilet
 paper in the water closet 132 as N and N=0 to start. The restroom
 convenience center system 100 assigns an impact on N for the sensor 112,
 where certain sensors 112 only slightly increase N and others provide a
 larger increase. An alternative embodiment involves determining the
 likelihood of a usage based upon all of the sensors 112 in the table,
 i.e. the water closet 132 activation plus an air quality indication is
 more indicative of a toilet paper usage than faucet and air quality.

 [0131] One embodiment of the invention would be to sensorize a reference
 restroom 101 in a sufficient manner to predict the state of another base
 restroom 101. Additional restrooms 101 at the same general location may
 then only include a minimal set of the sensors 112 or the sensor 112 such
 as providing only patron counters 158 (positioned at a door) at the
 remaining restrooms 101. The door patron counter 158 would then act as a
 &quot;bias&quot; that is used to adjust where that particular restroom&apos;s needs are
 against the more fully sensorized reference restroom 101.

 [0132] For the purposes of illustration the state table 1200 is shown by a
 series of 0&apos;s and 1&apos;s to indicate whether a particular device is above or
 below threshold or expected value. In one embodiment, the 0&apos;s and 1&apos;s
 represent continuous analog values, discrete counts, and probability
 density functions. Thus, in certain embodiments, thresholds for the state
 table 1200 could be populated based purely on empirical data obtained
 from the actual venue or similar installation.

 F . Restroom Convenience Center System Operation--Correlation Table

 [0133] It should be further appreciated that the accuracy and precision of
 the described predictive aspects of the invention may be improved in some
 cases through the use of additional sensors 112. Over time in a certain
 context it may be possible to accurately predict the need for service
 based only on number of visitors to the restroom 101. However, each time
 a new sensor 112 is added to the system 100, a more accurate prediction
 of the current state can be made. However, highly useful correlation
 information for predictive calculations can be obtained from a
 correlation table 1100 to map the relative correlation between the
 various sensors 112 and states of the restroom 101 (or the fixture
 130/consumables and other devices therein). FIG. 11 illustrates one
 non-limiting example of a correlation table 1100. In the illustrated
 embodiment, sensor input 1110 includes faucet activations, urinal
 activations, water closet activations, patron visits, air quality, and
 patron call status. For each of these sensor inputs, the correlation for
 various consumable usage 1120 is provided as high, medium, low, or no
 correlation 1130. It is intuitive that there would be a strong
 correlation between water closet activations and toilet paper usage, just
 as there would be a strong correlation between faucet activations and
 soap usage. However, a correlation also exists between water closet
 flushometer activations and soap usage although not as strong as that
 between faucet activations and soap usage. Thus, the flexibility of the
 present invention allows for different combinations of the sensors 112
 and accumulated historical data and comparison with current device data
 allow for different predictive approaches to predicting the current state
 of the restroom 101 and predict alarm states in the future.

 [0134] Once the sensor data has been used to determine, such as via the
 state table, the current (or predicted) state of the restroom 101, the
 restroom convenience center system 100 can also determine whether certain
 thresholds have been exceeded through the use of correlations. One way to
 do this is to establish a correlation factor for the water closet valve
 actuations to toilet paper usage. The correlation table (e.g., FIG. 11)
 indicates there is a high degree of correlation between water closet
 valve actuations and toilet paper usage. For a given installation, it may
 be known (or assumed) that in the case of male patrons, a water closet
 132 is sometimes used in place of the urinal 134, so it would be
 desirable that the system 100 remove this presumed action from counting
 towards the value of toilet paper depletion especially in a male
 restroom. This is in effect, a statistical negative weight which can be
 included to predict more precisely when consumables are to be replaced,
 as opposed to merely assuming one flush event equals use of toilet paper.
 That is, if a user is using a water closet 132 for liquid waste and
 therefore not using toilet paper, the correlation between the water
 closet 132 actuation and the use of toilet paper must be adjusted. In one
 embodiment, conventional stochastic models may be used to generate the
 state table and correlations. Another approach to further quantify
 population of the state table is to make use of the statistics method
 known as the &quot;Delphi&quot; technique. The Delphi technique would essentially
 treat each of the sensor inputs with it&apos;s own set of thresholds as an
 &quot;expert&quot;. The initial thresholds would be set qualitatively based on
 experience such as, but not limited to, &quot;look at the restroom state after
 85 visits&quot;, &quot;a roll of toilet paper gets used up about every 35 water
 closet 132 activations, after about 125 hand washes the towels should be
 checked&quot;, etc. Each sensor 112 could be polled to send data, or may push
 data, to the application when it reaches, or is approaching, warning or
 alarm state and all of the sensor input&apos;s &quot;expertise&quot; could be summarized
 to determine whether the sensors 112 all think the toilet paper should be
 replaced, or the towels need replenishment, or other corrective action is
 needed. Thus, each different sensor 112 (or information regarding the
 restroom) may be treated as providing an independent &quot;opinion&quot; as to the
 state of the restroom 101. For example, it may be know that there is a
 high correlation between water closet activations and toilet paper usage.
 Likewise, it may be also known that there is a correlation between water
 closet activations and hand towel usage, albeit not as strong as for
 water closet activations to toilet paper. Using the Delphi technique the
 mean of the sensor inputs can be determined and the range of responses
 analyzed to make a decision.

 G . Restroom Convenience Center System Operation--Learning

 [0135] The restroom convenience center system 100 can utilize various
 &quot;learning&quot; or &quot;smart computing&quot; techniques to adapt to a given
 installation or set of conditions. To correlate the data with other
 information, the system 100 again relies upon the state table forcing a
 discrete number of conditions that can be detected and further enabling
 the option for the system 100 to react in a pre-planned manner or one
 that adapts and learns over time. The system 100 also can include
 embedded or stored historical use data for the restroom 100 and even the
 fixtures 130 and the dispenser 142 which can be called on to assist in
 the learning process. Further, &quot;manual&quot; feedback, or rather actual
 observations, is one way for learning to occur. It should be appreciated
 that maintenance and janitorial personnel can physically inspect the
 restroom 101 and enter into the restroom convenience center system 100,
 such as through the LUI 180, any items that were found to be out of
 compliance with established policy. The patron call device 173 is another
 input to the restroom convenience center system 100 which can cause
 learning to occur in the system 100. The patron call device&apos;s 173
 initiation of learning in the restroom convenience center system 100
 would be reduced to practice by employing logic and statistical
 techniques to result in information. For example, it may be determined
 that based on the last x occurrences of this specific condition, there is
 an y % chance that a patron call will be initiated to report an
 unacceptable housekeeping condition. If y is above a certain
 predetermined threshold, the restroom convenience center system 100 will
 initiate an alarm, such as a text message to the cleaning personnel
 located in closest proximity to the restroom, predicting the need for
 service next. It should further be appreciated that, in certain
 embodiments, it will be equally important for the servicing personnel to
 report a &quot;no service required&quot; event as well for learning to occur in
 this scenario, as a source of feedback to the system 100. One of ordinary
 skill in the art will appreciate there are numerous other conventional,
 well known ways in which the system 100 can learn and which are used
 herein. Pattern matching is an example of another technique that can be
 used as a stimulus to induce learning for restroom convenience center
 system 100 applications. The underlying algorithm used by the restroom
 convenience center system 100 in a given embodiment might initially
 assume a Gaussian distribution for the patron&apos;s use of a particular
 fixture 130 which is translated to a value in the state table
 representing a warning, alarm, trend variable, or other quantity of
 interest. A background algorithm will then begin to check actual
 experience against the Gaussian model and make appropriate adjustment
 based on the error.

 [0136] In one embodiment, the predictive aspects are improved by having the
 system 100 periodically set to a known &quot;acceptable&quot; state. As mentioned
 previously, the patron call device 173 may be used to &quot;true up&quot; the
 system 100 by allowing for an unacceptable condition to be reported that
 can be a catalyst for the system 100 to recalibrate based on learning
 from the specific conditions that led to the unanticipated shortage of
 consumables for instance.

 [0137] Further, the restroom convenience center system 100 may utilize an
 adjustment upon the occurrence of a certain event, such as if an
 excessive number of patron calls due to unacceptable conditions or
 housekeeping inspections indicate the need for services is occurring
 prior to the system actually providing a warning or alarm, a routine can
 be automatically or manually initiated that will provide for a more
 aggressive algorithm. A qualified patron call request to report an
 unacceptable maintenance or housekeeping condition will trigger a
 recalibration of the algorithm to become more aggressive in its
 prediction of facility needs. A restroom 101 with little to no usage of
 the patron call capability is one that is probably well maintained. These
 visits are time-stamped by the restroom convenience center system 100 as
 part of the electronic log. Therefore, one example of the restroom
 convenience center system 100 application program might walk down the
 state table looking for any value to go over threshold which would
 initiate a notification. This additional &quot;aggressiveness&quot; might be
 obtained by adjusting some or all thresholds downward by an amount, such
 as, for example, 10%. Another method might provide increased weighting to
 a sensor input or combination of inputs that conventional data analytics
 algorithms show to be good predictors of actual activity over the default
 state table settings. Another embodiment might implement simple logic
 that provides notice if the patron counter 1580R the water closet
 132/urinal activations AND the faucets go over threshold, then the
 thresholds are adjusted as described above. Thus, for particular
 installations the predictive accuracy may increase as a larger universe
 of observed data is gathered.

 H . User Interface

 [0138] The use of graphical user interfaces as a part of or in combination
 with the restroom convenience center system 100 has been previously
 described. In certain embodiments, user interfaces provide specific
 information and functionality. FIGS. 13A-13G, FIGS. 14A-H, and 15A-H are
 representative screen shots of exemplary embedded web pages that can show
 valve failure alarms for various restroom fixture 130, a restroom
 overview, and various performance-related data. Generally, the user
 interfaces 1300-1306, 1400-1407, and 1500-1507 can indicate whether or
 not water-related fixture 130 are not operating and whether or not those
 fixtures 130 have been turned off, as well as general maintenance alarms.

 [0139] More particularly, FIG. 13A shows a screen shot 1300 of a overview
 page indicating the status of the restroom convenience center system 100,
 including a toolbar or menu bar 1310 allowing for access to additional
 pages. In the example of FIG. 13A, the options include &quot;overview&quot;
 &quot;performance: all fixture 130&quot; 1310A, &quot;performance: total facility&quot;
 1310B, &quot;configuration system&quot; 1310C, and &quot;alarms&quot; 1310D. The overview
 screen 1300 further includes individual displays providing certain
 information, in one embodiment &quot;snapshots&quot; summarizing information
 available from more detailed pages. For example, an events log 1312, a
 diagrammatic representation of a selected restroom 1313, an indication of
 a selected fixture 130 performance 1314, and the performance of the whole
 facility, as well as performance charts regarding traffic 1316, air
 quality 1317, and temperature 1318. In one embodiment, the overview page
 provides for interactive and dynamic display of information, such as
 allowing a user to select an individual fixture 130 from the diagram 1313
 resulting in the display of information related to that fixture 130 in
 the areas 1314-1318 fixture 130.

 [0140] FIG. 13B illustrates a performance screen 1301 for the entire
 facility and FIG. 13C illustrates a performance screen 1302 for all
 fixture 130. The performance screens 1301 and 1302 can be used to track
 information such as water savings or other &quot;green&quot; metrics. FIGS. 13D-F
 illustrate information regarding specific sensor data, patron traffic,
 temperature, and air quality, respectively. FIG. 13F illustrates an alarm
 screen 1306, which provides a user with an overview of particular alarms
 that have occurred in the restroom convenience center system 100. In
 addition, it should be appreciated that information may be made available
 in various forms and corresponding to various time periods. Data may be
 displayed in various line graphs, although other methods of representing
 data can be employed to present such data to an end user, either
 visually, textually, or both. It should be noted that the embedded web
 pages illustrated in FIGS. 13a-13d also include adaptive menus and
 navigation controls to allow an end-user to navigate to and from such
 embedded web pages.

 [0141] FIGS. 14A-J illustrates an alternative embodiment of user interface
 screens 1400-1407. The screens 1400-1407 include a tool bar or menu 1410.
 The menu 1410 includes, in the embodiment illustrated, links for
 selecting &quot;all restrooms&quot; 1410A, &quot;main floor&quot; 1410B, &quot;first floor
 balcony&quot; 1410C (corresponding to various subgroups within the facility),
 &quot;reporting&quot; 1410D, and &quot;system configuration&quot; 1410E. Screen 1400, of FIG.
 14A, includes an overview of the information available to a user. One
 portion of the screen 1400 provides a tab for an overview 1411, fixture
 130 1412, and alarms 1413. A second portion 1414 includes information
 relating to fixture 130 and their performance for the selected fixture
 130 or group from the first portion. Additional information is provided
 via patron traffic 1415, occupancy 1416, and air quality 1417 displays.
 FIGS. 14B-D illustrate various embodiments of these screens 1401-1403.
 FIGS. 14E-F illustrate system configuration screens 1404 and 1405
 respectively indicating devices screen and facility screens. The system
 configuration screens may be used to alter the restroom convenience
 center system 100 functionality and/or the functionality of the fixture
 130. FIGS. 14G-H depict reporting screens 1406-1407 for reports 1420 and
 logs 1421 respectively

 [0142] FIGS. 15A-J illustrate alternative embodiments for the screens
 1400-1407 for a different exemplary facility, depicted in user interface
 screens 1500-1507.

 [0143] In one embodiment, once the ZigBee nodes for those devices have been
 added to the restroom convenience center controller 110 system, the
 system operator may then add individual devices to the restroom
 convenience center controller 110 system configuration using the embedded
 web pages in the restroom convenience center controller 110. The operator
 can enter identifying information and other details for each device added
 to the system 100, including the physical location and identifying marks
 or serial numbers for the unit.

 [0144] Additionally, the embedded web pages can be used to modify the
 restroom convenience center controller 110 configuration parameters
 described above. That is, an end user can provide system and network
 parameters, facilities parameters and/or instructions, consumables,
 services, and notifications parameters, heuristics information, as well
 as calendar data related to the above parameters, e.g., for scheduling
 and timing replenishment actions and also even allow entry of information
 related to unusual or non-recurring events which will impact service or
 alarm conditions. Furthermore, the embedded web pages can be utilized to
 present various event reports, e.g., system events, facility events, and
 network events, such as those already described above. Various other
 pieces of information can be presented as well, including but not limited
 to, histograms, forecasting and trending data, diagnostic information,
 export/restore information, as well as hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)
 information.

 [0145] In one aspect of the present invention, restroom usage is compared
 to a predetermined threshold (either simple thresholds or complex states
 resulting from correlation of various sensed events or other
 statistically significant events), and if exceeded, the restroom
 controller generates an alarm notification with a time/date stamp and
 transmits such alarm to a user via one or more devices and/or sends the
 alarm to the global command unit. The time/date stamp can be useful in
 evaluating response times to such alarms which then can be further used
 to dynamically adjust various thresholds to ensure that alarms are set at
 appropriate times so as to avoid one or more of the supplies being
 completely exhausted.

 [0146] The restroom convenience center controller 110, as described above,
 can be configured to deliver alerts and alarms regarding various events
 and conditions to responsible personnel via email. If notifications are
 to be delivered to a cellular handset, the text-messaging email address
 of that handset should be supplied as an address (e.g.
 12165551234@myvzw.net). Alerts may include any of the conditions
 described above, and resulting alarms and/or notifications can be tagged
 as urgent or requiring immediate attention. Additionally, different email
 addresses may be assigned to different categories of alert and alarm
 conditions, depending upon who the responsible parties are for resolving
 various conditions. Alert and alarm conditions may either reset
 themselves if the condition is reversed, or be cleared by a system
 operator using the embedded web pages in the restroom convenience center
 controller 110.

 [0147] In addition, or alternatively, based on the monitored fixture 130
 usage and the generated fixture 130 usage profile, the method may further
 query whether the monitored usage activity of one or more of the fixture
 130 deviates from the predetermined or dynamically generated usage
 profile. If so, an alarm notification is generated and time-stamped, and
 then transmitted to a user via one or more devices and/or sends the alarm
 to the global command unit.

 [0148] Data may also be exported on-demand by accessing the embedded web
 pages and selecting an immediate export. This may be done for maintenance
 or diagnostic purposes.

 [0149] As discussed above, the restroom convenience center system 100 and
 method of the present invention advantageously provides for real time
 monitoring of one or more of the fixtures 130 associated with the
 restroom 101, and such system and method is expandable to the monitoring
 and control of multiple restrooms in a large venue, for example. By
 providing such real time monitoring, alarm notifications associated with
 such functions can be communicated in a timely manner, thereby
 facilitating improved service need or preventive maintenance response.

 [0150] Various embodiments allow the restroom convenience center controller
 110 to monitor facilities usage generate an alert condition when it
 determines that a piece of equipment may need periodic maintenance due to
 accumulated usage and wear, such as those fixture 130 and aspects
 described above. Once maintenance has been performed on the concerned
 components, a system operator would acknowledge the maintenance activity
 to the restroom convenience center controller 110 through embedded web
 pages which allow interaction at the restroom convenience center
 controller 110 server of NOC 510-level. It should be noted that
 interaction with the restroom convenience center controller 110 can also
 be implemented remotely. For example, each restroom convenience center
 controller 110 consists of a system of a plurality of buildings that can
 be accessed, configured, modified, etc. via the embedded web pages.

 [0151] In one embodiment, the user interfaces may be used to depict a
 restroom &quot;figure of merit&quot;. The figure of merit gives a stakeholder
 information regarding a desired feature of the restroom 101 important for
 that stakeholder or facility. It also can provide a metric for comparing
 different restrooms. For instance, the figure of merit metric would be
 particularly useful to a fast food chain or service station business
 which is trying to distinguish its brand from competitors. The figure of
 merit could be used to print out lists of &quot;outstanding performers&quot;, those
 that are &quot;in compliance&quot;, and those that require remediation. In one
 embodiment, a figure of merit would be a composite score based on a
 number of factors, including a low number of legitimate patron call
 requests, availability of consumables, fixture 130 and device
 availability (nothing broken and off-line), VOC levels, crowding, and
 time of overcrowding of the restroom 101.

 I . Example Usage Scenarios

 [0152] Additionally, by estimating restroom traffic, the restroom
 convenience center controller 110 can determine how long on average it
 should take to deplete the consumables (soap, towels, water closet 132
 paper, etc) in the dispenser 142 and send an alert via email to the party
 responsible for stocking the restroom 101 and ordering supplies.
 Moreover, the restroom convenience center controller 110 can send an
 email directly to the supply depot requesting a shipment of supplies,
 thus automating the resupply process. It should be noted that the
 restroom convenience center system 100, including one or more restroom
 convenience center controller 110 and one more sensors 112 for each
 restroom facility, can be scaled appropriately depending upon the
 environment. In other words, a first restroom facility can be outfitted
 simply with a single restroom convenience center controller 110 that it
 is able to harness the collective randomness of previously unused and/or
 discarded data gleaned from existing presence sensors 150 to effectively
 predict indirect water usage, consumable replenishment, and appropriate
 service responses, as well as redirect patron traffic to alternative ones
 of the restroom fixtures 130 and/or other restroom facilities.

 [0153] In one exemplary preferred embodiment, the restroom convenience
 center system 100 interfaces with a user such that selected critical
 sensor information can be used to monitor general availability of the
 fixture 130 in the restrooms 101, monitor the presence of a user in
 certain general locations of the restroom 101 and collect critical timing
 information needed to evaluate service requirements and fixture 130
 availability in the restroom 101.

 [0154] During a low service level state, illustrated in FIG. 16A, the
 restroom 1600 can be characterized by no visible queues at fixture 130
 (such as water closets 132 or faucets 136) such that the restroom 101 has
 excess capacity. As the user enters the restroom 1600 via a door 1610 to
 a first area 1611, the user activates a patron counter 158, which
 generates a time stamp data for entry into the restroom 1600. This time
 stamp date is stored by a memory component; either of the patron counter
 158 or the restroom convenience center controller 110. The user then
 moves to any location within the restroom 1600, or can even decide to
 immediately leave. If the user moves to the water closet 132 or the
 urinal 134, the presence sensor 150 can detect general location and even
 position at the given water closet 132 or the urinal 134. Once the user
 engages the selected fixture 130, additional timing data is collected and
 stored by the memory component and used for system processing, analysis
 and action items, such as consumables replacement or repair of an
 apparently nonfunctional fixture 130. Then, once the user engages a
 specific fixture 130 1630 at a second location 1612 out of the fixture
 130, such as the water closet 132, the urinal 134, the faucet 136 and a
 hand drying component (not shown), the presence sensor 150 (associated
 with the water closet 132, urinal 134, and faucet 136) moves into an
 alarmed state and an accumulated time is also stored for use by the
 restroom convenience center controller 110. Once the user disengages the
 selected fixture 130, the associated presence sensor 150 moves from the
 armed state, then to an activation state and then back to a standby mode
 state upon the user leaving the detection zone, thus awaiting a new user
 to repeat the timing cycle.

 [0155] The user may then choose to go to a third location 1613 in the
 restroom 101 to engage another of the fixtures 1632, 1634, such as a
 changing or work station or the faucet 136. The user then initiates
 washing of their hands by activating faucet water flow and/or the soap
 dispenser 142. The faucet 136 has an associated sensor 153 (use FIG. 1)
 that activates a timing cycle much as was done for the water closet 132
 or the urinal 134 to accumulate useful timing information (time elapsed
 as well as actual start and end time) for use by the processing system.
 For automatic faucets, as previously discussed, the logic of operation
 has the faucet 136 in a &quot;stand by mode&quot; or an &quot;on mode&quot;, and thus, the
 time stamp will be for an &quot;on mode&quot; then to an &quot;off mode&quot; once user
 leaves the faucet. The sink can further include other disposables, such
 as soap, hand sanitizer and paper towels from dispenser 20. Once any user
 leaves the restroom 1600, via area 1614 the restroom convenience center
 controller 110 time stamps departure time for use by the processing
 system. The restroom 1600 can further include other features, such as the
 patron call device 173 which can be tracked by the restroom convenience
 center controller 110.

 [0156] In another exemplary mode of operation when the restroom 101,
 illustrated in FIG. 16B, is operating during peak loading by users, more
 users are present then the number of the fixture 130. In such a
 situation, the user enters through the door 1610 and activates the patron
 counter 158 that generates associated time stamp data for use by the
 restroom convenience center controller 110. In the peak loading mode,
 queues develop for each of the fixtures 130 such that rapidity of time
 turnaround is logged for each of the fixture 130 and that data is
 processed for use by the restroom convenience center controller 110. This
 system 100 can then analyze the data and evaluate such information as
 ratio of users to fixture 130 being available with knowledge of departing
 versus entry of users (such discernment of entry versus departure can
 also be determined by appropriate joint use of a patron counter 158 and
 the presence sensor 150). In addition, during periods of frequent use of
 the restroom 1600, the air quality sensor 156 [not shown in FIGS. 16A-C]
 could have an associated peak in detection of gases and even particular
 profile characteristics of the status of use of the fixture 130 and time
 of use of each of the water closets 132. In addition, the timing
 information associated with the wash station (faucet) 136 can also be
 correlated to frequency, as well as, number and time of use of the
 faucets 136, thereby enabling gathering of data useful for restroom
 sensoring of the consumables being expended and consequent scheduling of
 consumables replacement or other services.

 [0157] FIG. 16C illustrates the restroom 1600 of FIGS. 16A-B in a no volume
 traffic pattern, such as during period when a building is unoccupied.

 [0158] In another exemplary aspect of the invention, the restroom
 convenience center system 100 can use the restroom data obtained as
 described herein, to provide potential users with helpful information.
 For example, informational restroom signage 1640 (FIG. 16A) could be
 provided at the entry to the restroom 1600 and even at each of the
 fixture 130 within the restroom 1600. Thus, when the restroom 1600 has
 available the fixture 130, such information can be displayed. When the
 restroom 1600 is under heavy use, the signage 1640 can indicate which of
 the fixtures 130 are available with associated wait times and can also
 indicate alternate available restrooms with fixture 130 ready for use in
 less crowded alternate restrooms. Further detailed information such as
 queue times can be provided via the external or even internal signage for
 specific fixtures 130. With knowledge of rate of entrance and exit by
 user, the restroom convenience center controller 110 can also apply
 various predictive models to project fixture 130 wait time and
 availability probabilities.

 [0159] With reference to FIGS. 21, 22A-D, and 23A-D illustrate observed
 data from a sample restroom 101 with a patron counter 158 and flushometer
 fixture 130 counting flushes being provided. It will be appreciated by
 one of ordinary skill in the art that FIGS. 21, 22A-B, and 23A-D provide
 an indication of various thresholds, correlations, and weighting that
 could be used in accordance with the principles of the present invention.
 FIG. 21 is a table depicting raw data log of restroom entrances and
 fixture flushing over 47 days for two restrooms 101, one male and one
 female in a high traffic environment. It can be observed that there is
 very good one to one correlation between male visits and fixture flushing
 with only a 31/2% difference in the number of users entering the restroom
 101 and the number of fixture activations. By contrast, the female
 restroom has a 40% difference in the count of users entering the restroom
 and fixture activations. This shows consistent multiple flushing on the
 part of the female users when compared to the male users.

 [0160] FIG. 22A illustrates average traffic during the day (over the course
 of a month) in 15 minute increments for the women&apos;s restroom 101, and
 FIG. 22B illustrates the same for a different month. FIG. 22C illustrates
 the daily totals for the same restroom 101 and month of FIG. 22A. FIG.
 22C illustrates the daily totals for the same restroom 101 and month of
 FIG. 22B. FIGS. 23A-D illustrate the same respective information as FIGS.
 22A-D except for the men&apos;s restroom 101. Patterns of use can be
 approximated by the system as a function of acquired patterns of data and
 that data can be leveled for predictive analysis.

 J . Traffic Intensity Index

 [0161] Traffic intensity is the measure of the congestion of the restroom
 101. It is used to anticipate pending queues within a system.
 Specifically it compares the rate of arrivals to the rate of departures.

 [0162] With a traffic intensity index nearer to zero, there is very little
 queue time in the system. With a traffic intensity closer to one, the
 occurrence of queuing within the restroom 101 increases. In any given
 commercial restroom, the traffic counter of arrivals and departures for a
 unit of time is an early warning indicator that the restroom 101 is
 reaching a &quot;saturation&quot; and queuing models begin to be employed. The
 queuing models are then used to balance traffic to other proximate
 restrooms 101 by giving patrons information on making decisions based
 upon average anticipated queue times for the restroom 101 and to notify
 service personnel (or the RCC system) of any imminent service events or
 alarm states. People entering and leaving the commercial restroom 101
 generate the following index as characterized by FIG. 20.

 [0163] FIG. 20 illustrates a flow chart depicting logic for carrying out
 one embodiment of the above described feature. In FIG. 20:

 [0164] N i =number of people counted entering the restroom

 [0165] {hacek over (N)} it =Average number of people entering restroom
 per time t

 [0166] N e =number of people counted leaving the restroom

 [0167] {hacek over (N)} et =Average number of people leaving restroom
 per time t

 [0168] t c =System time stamp traffic count.

 [0169] With continued reference to FIG. 20, the queuing logic 2000 tracks
 both people entering and people leaving. At step 2001, a patron enters
 the restroom 101 passing through the detection zone of the patron counter
 158. At step 2002, an entrance signal is received by the restroom
 convenience center 100. At step 2003, N i is increased by one to
 account for the entry of the person in step 2000. At step 2004, a time
 corresponding to the traffic count is obtained. At step 2005, {hacek over
 (N)} it is calculated to determine the average number of people
 entering per time period. Essentially in parallel, the system 100 also
 tracks the number of patrons exiting. At step 2006, a patron exits the
 restroom 101 passing though the detection zone of the patron counter 158.
 At step 2007, an exit signal is received by the restroom convenience
 center 100. At step 2008, N e is increased by one to account for the
 exit of the person in step 2006. At step 2009, a time corresponding to
 the traffic count is obtained. At step 2010, {hacek over (N)} et is
 calculated to determine the average number of people exiting per time
 period. At step 2011, the traffic intensity index is calculated by
 dividing {hacek over (N)} it by {hacek over (N)} et . If the value
 is greater than or equal to 1, then a queuing estimate is provided at
 step 2012; if the intensity index is less than 1 the system 100 returns
 to steps 2001 and 2006.

 [0170] With similar generated data for patrons being counted during
 exiting, traffic intensity ratios can be determined. This calculated
 ratio for a restroom 101 can indicate if queuing might be present within
 the restroom 101 and patrons may experience a wait once entering the
 restroom 101. In one embodiment, when the traffic intensity ratio goes
 beyond a value of 1, the system 100 begins analyzing the individual
 fixture data to determine expected queue times based upon the service
 level of the individual fixtures 130. It should be appreciated that
 various methods and models can be used to predict the expected queue
 time, but one non-liming example follows classic parallel server models
 in queuing theory assuming a Poisson distribution of patron arrivals at
 the fixtures.

 [0171] The average wait time T might be defined;

 T = 1 μ - λ ##EQU00001##

μ=average service rateλ=average arrival rate.

 [0172] Where a statistically significant service rate is generated by the
 system with extracted data. The average arrival rate, one can appreciate
 is a trivial value the system has already generated per unit of time.

 [0173] As long as the traffic intensity ratio for the restroom 101 remains
 at 1 or greater, each set of information from the sensor 112 in the
 restroom 101 corresponding to an individual fixture 130 is analyzed in
 real time in order to determine how much time remains before the next
 fixture 130 becomes available for patrons in the queue. This information
 gets correlated to arrive at a probability for broadcasting beyond the
 restroom 101 perhaps to digital message boards either above the occupied
 fixtures 130 or in the hallway before entering the restroom 101.
 Unoccupied fixtures within a restroom experiencing queues, having digital
 messages above each fixture could broadcast a message of the
 availability. Moreover, if during high queue times a particular fixture
 fails to experience use by a patron in the queue, an alert to this
 anomaly is trivial for the system to generate and send.

 [0174] At any time during non peak hours the traffic intensity ratio for
 the restroom 101 is less than 1 the individual fixture data is
 continually stored for analysis. This data is used for various
 maintenance subroutines as well as inferential data on other consumables
 in accordance with the principles of the present invention.

 [0175] In this embodiment, an important aspect is always knowing what the
 service rates are for the individual fixtures 130 for a given restroom
 traffic profile, which, as has been discussed previously, may vary from
 installation to installation and even type of population using the
 facility at any given time. With gathered data for various traffic
 patterns, any given fixture 130 can have an average service time
 estimated based upon historical stored data against that fixture 130.
 Having an estimated average service time allows the system 100 to
 estimate service time when the restroom 101 begins experiencing queue
 times. Table 2 illustrates the activity of the presence sensor 150
 associated with the fixture 130 and the corresponding activity of the
 restroom convenience center controller 110.

 [0176] FIG. 24 illustrates this in flowchart form, wherein:

 [0177] f xy =Fixture numbered `x` in restroom `y`

 [0178] ta fxy =time stamp fixture x when sensor is armed in restroom `y`

 [0179] t ffxy =time stamp of fixture x when sensor activates plumbing
 fixture in restroom `y`

 [0180] t ffxy -ta fxy =length of service for fixture x=Sx (@time
 t f .)

 [0181] X=Σf xy x=1 to X

 [0182] The logic for predicting queue time 2400 begins, at step 2401, with
 the patron trigger detection associated with a particular fixture &quot;x&quot; in
 the restroom 101, such as by presence sensor 150. The presence sensor 150
 goes into armed mode at step 2402. At step 2403, the sensor sends a
 signal to the restroom convenience center controller 110 which is time
 stamped. The value of ta fxy is stored at step 2404. At step 2405,
 the patron exits the fixture 130, resulting in the sensor 150 exiting the
 armed state. The corresponding signal is time stamped and then stored as
 t ffxy at step 2406. The restroom convenience center controller 110
 then calculates, at step 2407, the fixture service time by
 t ffxy -ta fxy . At step 2408, the calculated value is stored as
 S xt f . At step 2409, the presence sensor 150 returns to standby
 mode and the system 100 returns to step 2401. One can additionally
 appreciate that when an expected activation of water is anticipated by
 the above, a simple edit check can be trivial for the system 100 to
 accomplish by perhaps water flow detection.

 [0183] Although the invention has been shown and described with respect to
 a certain aspect or various aspects, it is obvious that equivalent
 alterations and modifications will occur to others skilled in the art
 upon the reading and understanding of this specification and the annexed
 drawings. In particular regard to the various functions performed by the
 above described components (assemblies, devices, circuits, etc.), the
 terms (including a reference to a &quot;means&quot;) used to describe such
 components are intended to correspond, unless otherwise indicated, to any
 component which performs the specified function of the described
 component (i.e., that is functionally equivalent), even though not
 structurally equivalent to the disclosed structure which performs the
 function in the herein illustrated exemplary embodiments of the
 invention. In addition, while a particular feature of the invention may
 have been disclosed with respect to only one of several aspects of the
 invention, such feature may be combined with one or more other features
 of the other aspects as may be desired and advantageous for any given or
 particular application. Furthermore, to the extent that the term
 &quot;includes&quot; is used in either the detailed description or the claims, such
 term is intended to be inclusive in a manner similar to the term
 &quot;comprising.&quot;

 [0184] Various embodiments are described in the general context of method
 steps, which may be implemented in one embodiment by a program product
 including computer-executable instructions, such as program code,
 executed by computers in networked environments. Generally, program
 modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures,
 etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data
 types. Computer-executable instructions, associated data structures, and
 program modules represent examples of program code for executing steps of
 the methods disclosed herein. The particular sequence of such executable
 instructions or associated data structures represents examples of
 corresponding acts for implementing the functions described in such
 steps.

 [0185] Software and web implementations of the present invention could be
 accomplished with standard programming techniques with rule based logic
 and other logic to accomplish the various database searching steps,
 correlation steps, comparison steps and decision steps. It should also be
 noted that the words &quot;component&quot; and &quot;module,&quot; as used herein and in the
 claims, is intended to encompass implementations using one or more lines
 of software code, and/or hardware implementations, and/or equipment for
 receiving manual inputs.
