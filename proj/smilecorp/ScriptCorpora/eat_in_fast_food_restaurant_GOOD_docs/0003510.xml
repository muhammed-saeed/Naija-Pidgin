 Timothy Fadek/ Corbis Sygma, for The New York Times 
 Some shocked and frightened onlookers at the scene of the killings of five people yesterday at the Wendy&apos;s on Main Street in Flushing, one of the busiest commercial strips in Queens. 
 t was just past closing time 
Wednesday night at the Wendy&apos;s on 
Main Street in Flushing, Queens. 
Two men, one short and one tall, 
knocked at the locked front door, 
calling out for the manager by name.
The 27-year-old manager, Jean 
Dumel Auguste, seemed to know the 
men, and he led at least one of them 
down to the store basement where he 
kept a small office near the employee changing rooms and a large walk-in freezer unit.
Not long after, Mr. Auguste used 
the store&apos;s intercom system to summon his small night crew down into 
the basement for a meeting. Six employees made their way down the 
back stairs into the cool, musty basement.
It was a death trap.
Minutes later, on one of the busiest 
strips in Queens, a massacre began 
to unfold -- a crime so grisly, so 
ruthless that it left some of the city&apos;s 
most experienced homicide investigators sickened. When it was over 
Wednesday night, all seven employees had been shot, all of them at close 
range, all in the head. Five were 
killed, including Mr. Auguste. A sixth 
was fighting for his life last night, 
and the seventh miraculously survived, his cheeks pierced by a bullet.
&quot;This is the most horrendous 
crime scene I&apos;ve ever witnessed in 
my nine years as district attorney of 
this county, and as people know I&apos;ve 
been to a lot of crime scenes,&quot; Richard A. Brown, the Queens district 
attorney, said yesterday, as hundreds of police officers hunted the 
city for two suspects, and as relatives, stricken with shock and grief, 
gathered at a nearby Sheraton Hotel.
Investigators said yesterday that 
the crime appeared to have been 
carefully planned and timed, and 
they thought one of the gunmen either had worked at the restaurant or 
knew someone who did because of 
their knowledge about how the place 
operated. &quot;They knew too much 
about Wendy&apos;s and how things 
worked there,&quot; one official said.
Law enforcement officials said 
yesterday afternoon that they were 
pursuing several possible suspects, 
including a 36-year-old man, a former employee at the Wendy&apos;s in 
Flushing, who was arrested last 
summer in connection with a robbery at a McDonald&apos;s in Queens. The 
man, who had also worked at the 
McDonald&apos;s, was on probation at the 
time for a 1996 burglary of a Manhattan fast food restaurant.
In the 1996 
case, law enforcement officials said, 
the man used a cutting tool to break 
into the restaurant&apos;s safe. In the 1999 
case, the man was released in August on $3,500 bail, but then did not 
show up for court appearances and a 
warrant was issued for his arrest.
Police officials offered this description of the gunmen: One was a 
black man in his 20&apos;s, about 6 feet 
tall, who was wearing brown sweat 
pants and a brown sweatshirt. The 
other was a black man in his 30&apos;s, 
about 5 feet 5 inches tall, who was 
wearing a black jacket and blue 
jeans. The Police Department&apos;s leading suspect, whose driver&apos;s license 
lists him as 5 feet 5 inches tall, has 
been identified by at least one witness from an array of police file 
photos.
Another witness, however, 
could not identify the man.
Customers said yesterday that in 
the moments before the restaurant&apos;s 
closing time, there was no hint at all 
of what was to come.
A young couple sat at a front table, 
quietly finishing their food. One employee went about emptying trash 
bins. Others wiped down tables and 
counters. At 10:55 p.m., a regular 
walked in and ordered one of the 
night&apos;s last meals, a junior bacon 
cheeseburger, a baked potato with 
sour cream and chives and a salad.
By 11 p.m., the store was empty 
but for seven employees, and the 
front door was locked. In the most 
haunting disclosure yesterday, investigators said that a passing police 
officer tried to stop in for a hamburger shortly after closing time but was 
shooed away. A senior police official 
said the officer reported that he was 
waved away by a man and a woman 
standing at the door.
&quot;We think it&apos;s very possible that 
could have been the robber standing 
there with the female,&quot; the official 
said. &quot;The cop tells us there is a guy 
and a girl standing at the door saying 
we&apos;re closed. His sense was they 
seemed friendly. But could he have 
been standing there with a gun at her 
back? It&apos;s possible.&quot;
Once in the basement, Mr. Auguste 
and the employees -- Ramon Nazario, 44; Anita C. Smith, 23; Jeremy 
Mele, 18; Ali Ibadat, 40; Patrick Castro, 23; and Jaquione Johnson, 18 -- 
were quickly subdued at gunpoint, 
police officials said. The gunmen 
used duct tape to bind hands behind 
backs and gag mouths. At some 
point, plastic bags were slipped over 
the heads of all seven employees, and 
they were forced into the large walk-in unit that combines a refrigerator 
section and freezer section. And then 
they began to shoot, apparently determined to leave no witnesses to 
their theft of as much as $2,000.
It was unclear last night how the 
men made their getaway. Police officials said they thought the two men 
might have slipped out a side door. 
But a woman at a nearby bus stop 
told the police she saw two men leave 
from the front door.
Over the next 90 minutes or so, two 
of the wounded, Mr. Castro and Mr. 
Johnson, worked themselves free. 
Mr. Castro called 911 from a basement telephone in the manager&apos;s office. &quot;We&apos;re in the basement,&quot; he 
managed to say, despite the bullet 
wounds to his cheeks. &quot;We&apos;re locked 
in.&quot;
Mr. Johnson considered Mr. Castro his closest friend at Wendy&apos;s, Mr. 
Johnson&apos;s family said. The two 
sometimes walked home together. 
Now, Mr. Castro dragged Mr. Johnson upstairs, where they waited for 
the police by the front counter. Mr. 
Johnson, who had a bullet lodged 
near the top of his skull, was in Mr. 
Castro&apos;s arms. According to police 
investigators, Mr. Castro was in such 
a daze that he did not even realize he 
had been shot in the mouth.
The first officers arrived at 12:52 
a.m. The first paramedics arrived a 
minute later. Seeing two wounded 
men inside, the officers smashed the 
glass of the locked front door.
As Mr. Johnson and Mr. Castro 
were taken to the hospital, the officers followed a trail of blood down 
the stairs to the basement, where 
they confronted a terrible carnage in 
the walk-in refrigerator. There was 
blood everywhere -- on the walls, on 
the floor, on boxes of food. Four of 
the employees were already dead. A 
fifth died on the way to New York 
Hospital Medical Center in Queens.
Four of the employees were found 
inside the refrigerator part of the 
walk-in unit. One of the dead was 
found sitting on the floor outside the 
unit, propped up against the wall. An 
investigator said it appeared as if the 
man were taking a nap.
One of the first Emergency Medical Service paramedics on the scene 
described his reaction to a superior. 
&quot;He said to me, &apos;You trained for this, 
You&apos;re prepared for this. But you&apos;re 
never prepared for this . These were 
kids. They were teenagers. This was 
a massacre.&apos; &quot;
Police officials said that based on 
shell casings found in the basement, 
they thought the weapon used in the 
shootings was a .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun. Police said they 
were unsure whether more than one 
.380 was used in the attack.
One senior police official said: 
&quot;These certainly aren&apos;t the smartest 
guys in the world -- to shoot seven 
people to rob a Wendy&apos;s? I think they 
were going with the old gangster 
philosophy of dead men tell no 
tales.&quot;
As the day wore on, and as the 
hours ticked by without an arrest, 
relatives were left to cope with the 
twin burdens of grief and fear.
Yesterday morning, members of 
Jaquione Johnson&apos;s large family 
filed into the waiting room of the 
intensive care unit at New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens. 
Some roamed the halls, pacing and 
awaiting word from doctors, who 
were still operating.
&quot;Doctors said 
he can&apos;t move his right side at all, but 
he has sensation in it,&quot; his aunt, 
Regina Johnson, said. &quot;His teeth are 
completely shattered.&quot;
At the restaurant, a co-worker, 
Olga Purdie, whose 2 p.m.-to-9 p.m. 
shift overlaps with the victims&apos;, rattled off their names and burst into 
tears. &quot;Jean, Ramon, Ali, Jeremy, 
Anita, Jaquione,&quot; she sobbed. &quot;They 
were my co-workers. They were my 
friends.&quot;
Last night, two detectives were 
sent to Mr. Castro&apos;s home to protect 
their leading witness in the case. 
&quot;We fear for his life,&quot; a friend said.
Mr. Brown, the district attorney, 
spent three hours at the scene and 
promised &quot;a full-court press&quot; to arrest the culprits. The killings were 
the worst in the city since five Bronx 
relatives were shot and stabbed to 
death in March.
Mr. Brown noted that the death 
penalty was one possible punishment 
for Wednesday&apos;s shootings, and 
Wendy&apos;s officials quickly pledged a 
$50,000 reward for information leading arrests.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani 
pledged another $10,000. Mr. Giuliani 
did not visit the crime scene, but in a 
City Hall press conference, he seized 
on the shooting to defend his buildup 
of the Police Department.
At the crime scene, city workers 
pumped out sewer lines, searching 
for a weapon, clothing, anything that 
might be a clue. Police dogs and their 
handlers methodically searched for 
some faint scent of the gunmen. A 
police van circled the neighborhood, 
its loudspeakers blasting pleas for 
witnesses to come forward.
A police helicopter hovered over 
the scene and, for reasons they would 
not disclose, officers searched for a 
green 1994 Nissan Maxima.
Several factors hampered investigators yesterday. A security camera 
surveyed the front counter area of 
the store, but the videotape from the 
camera was missing.
&quot;If we were making an educated 
guess at this point, it would appear 
the tape was taken,&quot; an official said.
And the sound of gunfire may have 
been muffled by work crews who 
were jackhammering a sidewalk 
just four doors down.
&quot;I heard nothing because of the 
construction,&quot; said Muhammed Khalid, manager of the Flushing News 
Outlet, a store four doors down from 
the Wendy&apos;s.
Even so, officials said they had 
more than enough leads to pursue, 
and they expressed confidence that 
they would soon make arrests.
&quot;It may be today, it may be tomorrow, it may be later,&quot; one senior law 
enforcement official said, &quot;but we 
will get these guys. If we can&apos;t catch 
guys like this, then shame on us.&quot;
