McDonald&apos;s Franchise

 Hamburgers, chicken, salads 

McDonald&apos;s brand is in 122 countries around the world. Thirty thousand locations serve 51 million customers each day. More than 70 percent of McDonald&apos;s restaurants around the world are owned and operated by independent local businesspeople.

In addition, the company operates Boston Market. It also has a subsidiary, Redbox, which in 2003 started as 18-foot wide automated convenience stores, but as of 2005 has focused on DVD rental machines.

Most standalone McDonald&apos;s restaurants offer both counter and drive-through service, with indoor and sometimes outdoor seating. The Drive-Thru, Auto-Mac, or McDrive as it is known in many countries, often has separate stations for placing, paying for, and picking up orders, though the former two steps are frequently combined. In some countries &quot;McDrive&quot; locations near highways offer no counter service or seating. In contrast, locations in high-density city neighborhoods often omit drive-through service.

 Please Note: The operators of McDonald&apos;s, may not have verified the accuracy of the Franchise information contained within this website. For accurate up-to-date information, customers are strongly recommended to visit the official McDonald&apos;s website .
