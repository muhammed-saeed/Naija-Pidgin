I have actually woken up with my hand in a now-soggy bag and pesto mayo all over my face after having stopped in to Acme after a few drinks. More than once. One of the top 3 burgers you will find in SF proper in my opinion.
You can get sizable Buffalo, Lamb and Ostrich burgers and the traditional beef, but you pay. But like the $5 shake in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; I dare you to take a bite and not shout &quot;Goddamn, that&apos;s a pretty f*ckin&apos; good burger.&quot;  Oh and the bacon is thick cut and lovely.
The fixins bar is also a plus as I really hate being policed in the fixins/condiments department. I think I should be allowed to have 87 pickles on my burger if I want. Why? Cuz I&apos;m an adult.

*On our quest to try 52 new places in 52 weeks.*

I know- you think I&apos;m being harsh. But hear me out.

The pluses:
- the lamb burger was very tasty and they were heavy handed on the feta

The negatives:
- it was pricey; $9-10 for the burger, $4 for the fries, plus drink
- these are Gott&apos;s prices; and we&apos;re not in the Ferry Building people, we&apos;re in the Western Addition

If I lived in the neighborhood it may get more stars out of me. But I am not entirely sold that it&apos;s worth making the trek from Cole Valley.
