 Carrolls restaurants -
 Sun, 09/7/03 12:31 PM Does anyone remember the Carrolls restaurant chain in Central New York in the early 1960&apos;s. Great burgers and fries. I seem to remember that almost everything was 15 cents. Oh, for only the good old days.

 Sun, 09/7/03 4:25 PM Carroll&apos;s,&quot;Home of the Club Burger&quot;. We had two locations here in Plattsburgh. They were Plattsburgh&apos;s first&quot;real&apos; franchise-type fast food operations.

Carroll&apos;s finally became the fanchise owner for Burger King oulets in much of Central and Northern NY State. Both locations here were turned into BK&apos;s. For quite some time, Carroll&apos;s was BK&apos;s largest franchise operator. That is not likely the case anymore. BK&apos;s prodcut doesn&apos;t even come close to what Carroll&apos;s used to put out.

 Sun, 09/7/03 4:36 PM Carroll&apos;s was my FAVORITE place to eat in my Kindergarten/First Grade years (1972-74). There was one in Kingston, PA---the halfway point from home to grandma&apos;s...and we would go every Saturday afternoon for lunch. I&apos;m not sure why, but I liked it a lot better than McDonald&apos;s (maybe my chops were even fine tuned then ). Hmm? Could&apos;ve been the orange (my favorite) color, the burgers, or all of those collectable cartoon glasses (still have some, the big ones are all here, the little ones broke. ). I&apos;d say that Carroll&apos;s folded up here by &apos;75 or &apos;76---right around the time a BK moved down the street.
What a treat!!!!

 Sun, 09/7/03 8:07 PM The Carolls Corporation still exists...what happened was that in the mid-70s they realized that they couldn&apos;t compete with Mickey Ds as Carolls,so they closed some locations,and transformed the others into Burger Kings-my very first real job was &apos;opening&apos; a transformed old Carolls as BK in early 77..The Carolls Corporation remains one of the one or two largest BK franchisees....funny thing is that up until about a year or so ago, there WERE real Carolls in of all places... Sweden! Complete with Club Burgers..made my mouth droool...And yes it is spelled with one &apos;R&apos;.....

 Sun, 09/7/03 8:10 PM Carolls was the first &apos;real&apos; fast food for a lot of smaller cities in NY,PA and Ohio I believe- back in the days when Mickey Ds was REAL picky about their locations...

 Sun, 09/7/03 10:09 PM We had a Carrolls here in MA back in the early 70&apos;s.As a matter of fact we still have one of the orange trays that they use to serve the food on. They were one of first places around this area that stayed open 24 hours.My hubby and I would make middle of the night trips to Carrols when I was pregnant with our daughter and had cravings for one of their cheeseburgers.

 Mon, 09/8/03 12:59 PM There were a number of Carrols resturants in the Binghamton, NY area. All of them are now Burger Kings. There was for some time a standing,&lt;but abandoned&gt;Carrol&apos;s in Cortland, NY. It was sort of nice just to see the place still standing. The Club Burger was definately light years better than the Big Mac. I have a collection of glasses that they were handing out back in the early 70&apos;s whenever you got a large size drink.

 Tue, 09/9/03 8:10 AM Actually there was at one time, two Carrols in Cortland. The first was on Groton ave. It stood vacant for years, then a Burger King was built next to it, and it was demolished to make way for a bank. My brother worked there briefly while in high school. He had the usual fast food stories, food pranks, rats at the dumpster, zit-faced-nazi-manager (or was that the McDonalds in Mill Valley California?).

My last memory of that Carrols was in 1976, out partying with a friend, he asked the time, and we rushed over to Carrols. It was closed when we got there, he went to the back door, and he came back with a warm sack full of burgers, and fries. His buddy was the manager, and these were the leftovers they were going to throw out. It was a nice break in a beer and herb infused night.

The second was on route 13. It died shortly after Mickey D built across the road. It became an Arby&apos;s and is now a carpet store.

 Tue, 09/9/03 8:11 AM Mickey D had the clown mascot, while Carrols had some kind of fuzzy worm. We called it the slug.

 Tue, 09/9/03 6:09 PM It was great to be reminded about Carrols. In the 70&apos;s when I was in high school I sold radio time for a local station. I picked up the Carrols account after meeting the local district rep. We ran contests each day for free meals of club burgers cheeseburgers coke and fries. He would give me boxes each with 1000 coupons for each item. I kept many of those coupons for myself and friends. We thought we put them out of business when they closed in Ct to become Burger King. I got so tired of the food went I went out with friends they would pay for my food at another restaurant so I would give them coupons for their meals. It was the best of times It was the worst of Diets.

 Mon, 09/22/03 12:18 PM Thanks everyone for sharing your memories about Carrols. The food was great and most of it was only .15. It is a shame the way good operations are forced to close their doors. Anyways, no one can rob us of the great memories as well as their mouth watering food. If anyone has any Carrols memorabilia that they would be interested in possibly selling, please drop me a note at fort1722@aol.com . Thanks.
