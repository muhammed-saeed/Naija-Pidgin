 ST. LOUIS • Authorities suspect an arsonist is
to blame for the fire that gutted a Popeyes chicken restaurant in
the 3600 block of Gravois Avenue late Thursday night.

The person who reported the fire called from a cell phone at
about 11:30 p.m. Thursday, saying there had been an explosion and
someone was injured, said Capt. Dan Sutter of the St. Louis Fire
Department.

When firefighters arrived, they found no signs of an explosion
and no one injured, Sutter said. But the black smoke pouring from
the one-story commercial building was so thick and drifting into
the street that crews had difficulty seeing across Gravois, Sutter
added.

Katie O&apos;Sullivan, a spokeswoman for the St. Louis Police
Department, said the fire is being investigated as an arson. She
said police had no suspects.

The Popeyes restaurant is at 3665 Gravois Avenue, in the city&apos;s
Tower Grove South neighborhood.
