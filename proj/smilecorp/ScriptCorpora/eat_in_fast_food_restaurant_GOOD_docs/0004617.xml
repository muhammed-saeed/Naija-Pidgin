 Review Type: -- Select -- Member&apos;s Review Editor&apos;s Choice Chicken chop 2 days ago 
 by quekth 
 Apollo Grilled Western Food ( Hougang ) 
I was here for a late lunch. I decided to have chicken chop from this western food stall. It served with baked beans, french fries and sweet bun. The chicken chop was quite a big piece. It was nicely grilled to give it a slight crisp on the surface. It came serving with their special sauce. The p... more

 Rong Yuan Shu Shi Tan ( Ghim Moh ) 
If you are looking for traditional local chinese snack or breakfast, you can check out Rong Yuan Shu Shi Tan. I find that the steamed Taro Cake was a bit disappointing as I prefer those that have chunks of yam. I could not really taste the yam flavour or find the contrast in texture I wa... more

 Soya Bean . Jelly Bean - Chong Pang Market&amp;Food Centre ( Yishun ) 
It was another superb hot day when i was there. I decided to get a glass of grass jelly drink from this drink stall. It was a big glass of drink with quite a lot of grass jelly in it. The level of sweetness was just right. I was told grass jelly has rather good effect in cooling the heat and i like... more

 Awfully Chocolate ( Kallang ) 
Got a few tubs of their famous chocolate ice cream to a friend&apos;s house invitation. It was extremely rich and I felt as though I am sucking on a dark chocolate bar. Very satisfying in taste but it took me three spoons and I called it quits because it was quite sweet for me in the end. We all enjo... more 
 . Roasted Meat 2 days ago 
 by SGFoodonFoot 
 Jiu Jiang Shao La ( Ghim Moh ) 
Many people have recommended this roast meat stall at Ghim Moh Food Centre. With such high popularity we definitely have to join the queue to try out their roast meat. Yes I mentioned queue, it took us like a good 25 minutes for our turn. We bought the Roast Duck, Roast Pork and ... more 
 Mr Bean 2 days ago

 Mr Bean ( Tampines ) 
Bought this Red Bean Pancake for lunch. The red bean pancake was all right, but somehow I found their red bean to be a bit little. I quite like the pancake skin, it was soft and good to chew and I even can smell the fragrant of the pancake skin. The red bean was very thick. First bite, the... more 
 Dessert 2 days ago

 Dessert ( Ghim Moh ) 
The wonderful hawker food feast ended with dessert from Golden Swallow Dessert. I like the dessert here because of the fresh coconut milk. Bo Bo Cha Cha is the most appropriate dessert to highlight this. The hot Bo Bo Cha Cha was a bit too sweet but the cold one was really good. ... more

 Lian He Carrot Cake ( Ghim Moh ) 
Just beside the Chwee Kueh stall at Ghim Moh Food Centre is this inconspicuous Fried Carrot Cake stall that uses vegetable oil for healthier option. The stall sells both white and black carrot cake. We had the Black Carrot Cake. The steamed radish cake was moist and soft. T... more

 Go Western ( Sengkang ) 
I was here for dinner with a good friend. I decided to go western. I decided to have fried chicken cutlet served with rice. It came with coleslaw and baked beans too. The well seasoned cutlet was fried to near perfection for a crispy texture. Most importantly, it did not taste too oily. The ric... more

 Roasted Duck Rice - Sin Hing Restaurant ( Sin Ming ) 
This stall is located at the corner coffee shop along the Upper Thomson Road. It has got a queue of a few people when i was there last Sunday. I ordered my usual favourite - roasted meat and char siew rice. The meats where chopped in big pieces just how i liked it. I asked for extra braise... more
