Whenever I’m on the road, or when I want to slip out of the office during lunchtime for something other than the cheese and hotdogs that I normally take for lunch (while I’m on this Low-Carb&quot;diet&quot;)…I like to know my options going in.

Do you know what the Low-Carb choices are at fast-food restaurants these days?

 Here’s what I found… 
 
 

 
Shown here are the Total Calories and the Total Net Carbs (calculated by subtracting the total Fiber from the total Carbohydrates).

I used&quot;less than 20 Net Carbs&quot;as the cut-off. To view complete nutrition facts, simply click on the item itself.

A Word About Salads&amp;Dressings…

When you’re figuring the total number of Carbs in salads, you have to add in the Carbs from the dressing. That is, unless you do the Atkins Diet like Jim&amp;I do the Atkins Diet…

To keep it fun (and less restricting), we don’t count any sauces or condiments in our Carb counts for the day. I know it’s not the&quot;right&quot;thing to do, but it is the only way we could stay on this diet.

Plus, even though we’re not sticking to the&quot;official&quot;Atkins plan, we’re still losing some serious pounds because we’re eating FAR fewer Carbs than we used to. Not to mention, fewer Calories and less Fat. To each his own. (Oh, and don’t forget…skip the optional croutons&amp;crackers!)
