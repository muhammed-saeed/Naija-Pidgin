 The YAM Network (Auction ends Thursday, July 12, 2012!) 
 One Does Not Simply Quaff Into Mordor 
 Retail | Wichita, KS, USA | Food&amp;Drink 
 (In the liquor store I work in, I notice an older man wondering around the store looking very confused. I ask if I can help him find anything.) 

 Customer: “Do you have Rivendell?”

 Me: “ Rivendell ?”

 Customer: “Yes, I’m looking for Rivendell.”

 Me: “Um, I don’t know if we have that here. Are you sure what you’re looking for is called‘Rivendell?’”

 Customer: “Yes, Rivendell.”

 Me: *hesitantly* “Sir, I believe Rivendell is a city from The Lord Of The Rings .”

 Customer: “Oh.”

 (We pause and stare at each other for a moment. He pulls his phone out to call the person who sent him to the store. What was he looking for? Zinfandel.)

 Customer: “Yep, it was fine.”

 Me: *smiling* “That’s good.”

 Customer: “You have a nice smile.”

 Me: “Thanks!”

 Customer: “You must be very happy.”

 Less Is More, More Or Less, Part 3 
 Drugstore , Pharmacy | Omaha, NE, USA | At The Checkout , Money Issues 
 (Our store regularly runs a promotion on the various vitamin brands for‘BOGO’, buy 1, get 1 free. A customer comes up to the register with a bottle of a brand on the BOGO promotion. I am also an avid couponer and I regularly take in coupons for items we carry that I won’t use so that I can give them to customers.) 

 Me: “Sir, I see you’re buying a [brand] item. This week we currently have this whole line at Buy One, Get One Free. If you do get another one, I also have a coupon I can give you which is good for $2 off two items. So instead of getting one for $9.99 you can get 2 for eight bucks and change.”

 Customer: *quite angrily* “What the h*** is wrong with you people? I just want my vitamins. Why are you always trying to push me to buy extra stuff and give you more money!?”

 Me: “I’m…sir, I apologize. I probably wasn’t clear you’ll get twice as many vitamins and spend two dollars less—”

 Customer: “Oh f*** this. You’re all scam artists!” *storms off without paying* 

 Me: *stares in disbelief* 

 Next Customer: “So…can I use that coupon?”

 The Shape Of Things To‘C’ 
 Vitamin Store | California, USA | Body Problems , Rude&amp;Risque 
 (My manager&amp;I are working one night. A very well dressed woman in her 50s walks in.) 

 Me: “Hi, how are you doing tonight?”

 Customer: “I’m doing fine.”

 Me: “What are you looking for?”

 Customer: “I’m looking for something for my husband. He needs something for…”

 (She motions her right hand to make it into the shape of a‘C’.) 

 Me: “He needs vitamin C?”

 Customer: “No…something for…”

 (She emphasizes the‘C’shape of her right hand.) 

 Me: “He needs some calcium??”

 Customer: “No…you know what I mean?”

 (She’s still making the‘C’with her right hand, but is now widening the shape.) 

 Me: “I don’t think I know what it is.”

 (I ask for my manager who has been watching us. He immediately gets what she’s asking for.) 

 Manager: *points towards the male enhancements* “Ma’am, we have a wide variety of libido enhancers, but there isn’t anything to make him‘wider’or‘girthier’.”

 Customer: “Aww. Well, his libido’s fine. He just needs a little more to work with. Thank you for the help anyway!” *leaves*

 Me: “Thank you for calling [company]. How may I help you?”

 Customer: “So, like, I poured coffee on my keyboard, then put it on my radiator to dry it out, then ran it through the dishwasher, then through the dryer, but now when I type it does funny things. Do you think the coffee could have ruined it?”

 (I have to place customer on mute to laugh for almost a minute while he elaborates on his story.) 

 Me: “Yes, sir, it does sound like your keyboard has physical damage and will need to be replaced.”

 Me: “All right…let’s reconnect the cables to your router and we’ll have you back up in no time.”

 Customer: *distracted* “Hey, honey? How many fingers should I have?”

 Wife: *in the background* “You have five on each hand.”
