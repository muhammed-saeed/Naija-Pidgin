I&apos;m not what you&apos;d call a typical IKEA customer, in fact previous to just a few months ago, I&apos;d only been once and my abiding memory of that ordeal was trying to escape through the maze that they call a shopping floor to the safety of the car park. It&apos;s like, once you&apos;re in, you ain&apos;t leaving till you&apos;ve bought something.
Be that as it may, it just so happens that I&apos;ve recently been working very close to an IKEA. Not only that, but for a while I was working seven days a week and, as we all know, Sundays wouldn&apos;t be Sundays without a decent brekkie...they&apos;d be Tuesdays probably.
 

So, with that in mind, and having tried all the various other options around (not many), I ventured into said IKEA store to sample the breakfast. (The said IKEA being at Straiton, Edinburgh.)

The restaurant is a cafeteria-style job and first impressions were not good. Two lanes for queueing and both fit to burst with hungry shoppers. Oh dear. Not to worry though, the serving area was well staffed and the queues moved along at a brisk pace past the salads, sandwiches and cakes on display and on to the hot food area.
There&apos;s not a huge range of choice on offer but how much choice do you need? As far as I can remember, they did a breakfast ciabatta roll thingy, a kid&apos;s breakfast, a small breakfast and a regular breakfast (same as the small but with two of everything). Guess which one I went for?

I can&apos;r remember the price for the ciabatta, but the kid&apos;s brekkie was 85p, small was 99p and regular was£1.95. Certainly nothing wrong with the prices.
The breakfast consists of: hash brown, sausage, bacon, tomato, beans and scrambled egg. The kid&apos;s brekkie was a choice of any three items. I think you could also mix and match items for a custom breakfast, but don&apos;t &quot;quote&quot; me on that... I said DON&apos;T quote me!

The regular breakfast, as I said, is just the same but doubled. Not only that, you also get a roll and butter!
Coffee / tea/ hot chocolate comes in at 99p with free refills.
It&apos;s a bit of a jostle getting your grub, paying for it and then fixing your tea/coffee, but it WAS pretty busy. However, there were plenty of seats available and if you can manage to get one at the window, you get a fantastic view of Aurthur&apos;s Seat thrown in for free.

But how was the breakfast? Thought you&apos;d never ask.
It was good. Not great, not as good as home cooking, but it was good.
All the items were well cooked and had some flavour to them: juicy bangers, crispy bacon and moist-on-the-inside hash browns. I&apos;m not a great fan of scrambled eggs, but they were not bad at all...in fact I&apos;d say they were better than most fried eggs you get dished up when eating out. Even the tomatoes were grilled properly - not raw, not mushy, somewhere in-between. None of it was greasy.
The rolls on offer could be better though. perhaps a Scottish morning roll instead of a Kaiser or a poppy seed. Still, minor (very minor) quibble.
To cap it all, the coffee (from a push button dispenser) was excellent and I was sorely tempted to have a refill.
Since first having breakfast at IKEA, I&apos;ve been back a few times and the standard is pretty consistent. Sometimes the queue takes longer than other times (sometimes it&apos;s quite quick), but the food is always the same and always good.


In conclusion, I can heartily recommend breakfast at IKEA. Good, tasty food at a ridiculously low price. Why, you can even get your coffee or tea free if you get yourself an IKEA family card (Mon-Fri only).

I still haven&apos;t ventured back into the shopping area though.
