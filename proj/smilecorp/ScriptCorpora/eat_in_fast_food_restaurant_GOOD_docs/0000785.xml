29. UTILITY COMPANY ON TRIAL OVER ACCUSATIONS 
 IT CAUSED SMOG AND HEALTH PROBLEMS (Tape 3)



Chairman Hanley referred to an article from The 
 Washington Post which noted that a utility company in Columbus, 
 Ohio was the first ever to go on trial over government accusations that

 Hanley.



30. AUTHORIZATION OF THE FILING OF REZONING 
 AND PROFFERED CONDITION AMENDMENT APPLICATIONS IN THE NAME OF CHRISTOPHER 
 MANAGEMENT, INCORPORATED FOR BRIARWOOD TRACE (PROVIDENCE DISTRICT) (Tape 3)



Supervisor Connolly stated that a small piece of land 
 in the Briarwood Trace assemblage at the intersection of Interstate 
 66 and Nutley Street requires the Board&apos;s authorization for filing pending 
 zoning applications. He noted that the Board approved Rezoning/Final 
 Development Plan Application 2002-PR-008 in September of 2002. The pending 
 application serves to add a previously unconsolidated parcel to the 
 approved rezoning, which had received solid support from the community.



Accordingly, Supervisor Connolly moved that the Board 
 authorize the filing of rezoning and proffered condition amendment applications 
 on those portions of Swanee Lane, as generally identified in the pending 
 applications affecting the same and filed in the name of Christopher 
 Management, Incorporated. He noted that approval of this motion shall

 Supervisor Frey being out of the room.

 representatives of Mitretek Systems, and representatives of the Black 
 Engineer of the Year Awards Conference to appear before the Board to 
 pay tribute to her for work in the Fairfax County community and recognize 
 this important achievement in her career. Chairman Hanley seconded the 
 motion, which carried by a vote of nine, Supervisor Frey being out of 
 the room.



32. NORTHERN VIRGINIA SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION 
 DISTRICT 2003 SEEDLING SALE (Tape 3)

33. FLAGS AND FLAGPOLES AT COUNTY BUILDINGS (Tape 
 3)
 

 
Supervisor Mendelsohn reminded the Board that on October 
 7, 2002, he called to the Board&apos;s attention to the fact that flags and 
 flagpoles are not routinely placed in front of all County buildings. 
 He moved that the Board direct the County Executive to do the following:


 
 


 Add a specification requiring the installation of flagpoles at all 
 future County buildings that are designed. 



 



 


 Prepare a Consideration Item for the Fiscal Year 2004 Budget for 
 placing flagpoles at all existing buildings that currently do not 
 have them. 



 


 
Chairman Hanley clarified that the specification for 
 flagpoles would also apply to renovated buildings.



Supervisor Connolly seconded the motion, which carried 
 by unanimous vote.



(NOTE: Later in the meeting, this item was revisited. 
 See Clerk&apos;s Summary Item CL#35.)


 
34. COMPUTERIZED INTERACTIVE DISTANCE LEARNING (Tape 
 3)
 

 
Supervisor Mendelsohn noted that recently he observed 
 a demonstration of a computerized interactive distance learning program 
 at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJHSST). 
 He said that school staff told him that all schools in the County will 
 have the broadband capability to use this teaching tool once the upgrade 
 of the County/School I-Net is completed under the terms of the Cox Cable 
 license agreement later this year. He noted that the cost of the equipment 
 package is approximately $50,000 as shown on information provided by 
 the staff at TJHSST and distributed to the Board.



Accordingly, Supervisor Mendelsohn moved that the Board 
 direct the County Executive to explore whether any revenues from the 
 Cable Fund could be used for this upgrade either as a one-time or multiyear 
 project to install this equipment in all of the high schools. Chairman 
 Hanley seconded the motion.



Supervisor Connolly reminded the Board that when it 
 granted the extension of the franchise it also gave the School Division 
 a full one percent of the franchise fee for technology in the schools.



Following discussion, Supervisor Mendelsohn clarified 
 that his motion did not specify which side of the fund should be used; 
 it could be either School funds or County funds.



The question was called on the motion, as clarified, 
 which carried by unanimous vote.


 
35. CLARIFICATION OF FLAGPOLE ITEM (Tape 3)
 

 
(NOTE: Earlier in the meeting, the Board took action 
 regarding flagpoles at County buildings. See Clerk&apos;s Summary Item CL#33.)

 County Executive, regarding the placement of flagpoles at County buildings, 
 Chairman Hanley stated that the Board favored the least expensive option, 
 subject to the discretion of the County Executive.

 SLAUGHTER BILL (Tape 3)

 a bill that California Senator Dianne Feinstein plans to introduce in 
 Congress to prohibit the slaughter of American horses for human consumption 
 abroad. She moved that the Board direct staff to prepare a letter from 
 the Board to Senator Feinstein supporting the prohibition of horse slaughter. 
 Supervisor McConnell noted that horses are noble animals that have an 
 important place in American history. Supervisor Frey seconded the motion, 
 which carried by unanimous vote.

Supervisor Hudgins stated that BRE/VCD Associates, 
 LLC has filed applications to allow for a drive-through bank, the expansion 
 of existing buildings, the change in hours of operation of a previously 
 approved special exception use, and a change in circulation, parking, 
 and access for the Village Center at Dulles. Supervisor Hudgins stated 
 that because of contractual obligations and timelines relating to the 
 drive-in bank, the applicant is requesting concurrent processing of 
 the site plan.



Accordingly, Supervisor Hudgins moved that the Board 
 direct staff in the Department of Public Works and Environmental Services 
 to review and process the site and building plans for Tax Map 16-3 ((1))14D 
 and 16-3 ((1))15B part of, concurrent with the review of Proffered Condition 
 Amendment Applications PCA 88-C-091-08 and PCA 88-C-039-08, Special 
 Exception Amendment Application SEA 89-C-027-09, and Rezoning Application 
 RZ 2002-HM-044.



This motion does not relieve the applicant from complying 
 with the provisions of any applicable ordinances, regulations, or adopted 
 standards and does not prejudice the consideration of this application 
 in any way. Supervisor Bulova seconded the motion, which carried by 
 unanimous vote.



39. THE RETIREMENT OF AL HILLMAN AFTER WORKING 
 20 YEARS WITH THE FAIRFAX CONNECTOR (Tape 4)



Supervisor Hudgins stated that Mr. Al Hillman, who 
 worked with the Fairfax Connector since it inception in 1985, will be 
 retiring at the end of February. Supervisor Hudgins said that Mr. Hillman 
 was an integral part of the Fairfax Connector services for almost 20 
 years. He first served as a bus driver in 1985 and retires as the General 
 Manager, supervising the daily operation of the Dulles Corridor Express 
 Bus Service. Without his oversight of the fleet of buses serving the 
 Dulles Corridor, the County would not have had as successful a service 
 linking the Reston/Herndon area to the Metro system.



Supervisor Hudgins moved that the Board direct staff 
 to invite Mr. Hillman to appear before the Board to be presented with 
 a certificate of recognition on March 10, 2003. Supervisor Connolly 
 seconded the motion, which carried by unanimous vote.



40. SUPPORT FOR THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE ADVISORY 
 BOARD (CJAB) (Tape 4)



Supervisor Hudgins stated that the members of CJAB 
 have communicated to her several concerns regarding staff support and 
 the need for basic office supplies such as stationery paper for official 
 correspondences and copy machine use.



Following up on this communication with CJAB, Supervisor 
 Hudgins moved that the Board direct staff to review the concerns of 
 CJAB and report its findings regarding the following:


 
 

 The number of Boards, Authorities, and Commissions that receive 
 staff or office support. 


 



 

 The request for staff liaison and office support for CJAB. 


 


 
Supervisor Mendelsohn seconded the motion.



Chairman Hanley relinquished the Chair to Vice-Chairman 
 Hyland and asked unanimous consent that the Board direct staff to include 
 this item for discussion and consideration during the Budget deliberations. 
 Without objection, it was so ordered.



Vice-Chairman Hyland returned the gavel to Chairman 
 Hanley.



The question was called on the motion, which carried 
 by a vote of nine, Supervisor McConnell being out of the room.



41. STUDENT MUSICIANS FROM SOUTH LAKES HIGH 
 SCHOOL PARTICIPATE IN THE ALL-DISTRICT SYMPHONIC BAND AND THE ALL-DISTRICT 
 WIND ENSEMBLE (HUNTER MILL DISTRICT) (Tape 4)

 from South Lakes High School received top honors by being chosen to 
 participate in the All-District Symphonic Band and the All-District 
 Wind Ensemble.

 Daniels, Kelsey Fraser, Daniel Thayer, and Sean Williams for being selected 
 to the All-District Symphonic Band and to Kyle Brightwell, Thomas Kennedy, 
 and Jeff Ward for being selected to the All-District Wind Ensemble.



Supervisor Hudgins moved that the Board direct staff 
 to send these students letters of congratulations on their accomplishments. 
 Supervisor Frey seconded the motion, which carried by a vote of nine, 
 Supervisor McConnell being out of the room.



42. RECOGNITION OF MS. KATHY VERNON FOR HER 
 MANY HOURS OF SERVICE TO THE RED CROSS AND FAIRFAX COUNTY (Tape 
 4)



Supervisor Hudgins recognized Kathy Vernon, a Reston 
 resident for her outstanding volunteer service with the American Red 
 Cross. Ms. Vernon contributed many hours with the Red Cross and most 
 recently she was responsible for organizing the shelter in Herndon this 
 past December in response to a gas outage and an oncoming winter storm. 
 The shelter was located in the Dranesville District, but the event impacted 
 citizens in the Hunter Mill, Dranesville, and Sully Districts.



In recognition of the many hours Ms. Vernon volunteered 
 to the American Red Cross and the service she provided to the citizens 
 of the County, as well as internationally, Supervisor Hudgins moved 
 that the Board direct staff to invite Ms. Vernon to appear before the 
 Board to be recognized for her many outstanding volunteer contributions 
 through the American Red Cross. This motion, the second to which was 
 inaudible, carried by a vote of nine, Supervisor McConnell being out 
 of the room.


 
43. OLDER AMERICANS MONTH (Tape 4)
 

 
Supervisor Hudgins stated that when Older Americans 
 Month was established in 1963, only 17 million Americans had reached 
 their sixty-fifth birthday. Today there are 82,000 seniors in Fairfax 
 County alone, about 1 in every 12 residents, 65 years and older. Seniors 
 are one of the Countys most prized resources because of the number 
 of hours they give to the many committees, boards, and other volunteer 
 initiatives in their communities. Historically, Older Americans Month 
 has been a time to acknowledge the contributions of the past and current 
 older persons to the country, in particular those who defended the nation. 
 The Older Americans Month theme is&quot;What We Do Makes A Difference.&quot;



Supervisor Hudgins moved that the Board declare May 
 2003 as&quot; Older Americans Month&quot; in Fairfax County and 
 direct staff to invite the representatives from the Older Americans 
 Community to appear before the Board to be recognized. Supervisor Frey 
 seconded the motion and it carried by a vote of nine, Supervisor McConnell

 Board direct the Office of Public Affairs to publicize this information. 
 Without objection, it was so ordered.



45. THE MULFORD SCHOOL RELOCATION TO LEE HIGHWAY 
 (SULLY DISTRICT) (Tape 4)



Supervisor Frey said that The Mulford School has offered 
 preschool care for children for over 40 years in the Centreville area. 
 The school is now seeking to relocate its operation to a new site on 
 Lee Highway, and it must vacate the current site this spring. Therefore, 
 Supervisor Frey stated that the owners need to establish their new school 
 as soon as possible. To minimize impacts on the families of the children 
 enrolled in the school, Mr. and Mrs. Mulford have asked for the Boards 
 assistance in expediting the review of their applications and plans.



Supervisor Frey moved that the Board:


 
 


 Authorize expedited processing of the special exception application 
 and concurrent processing of the zoning and site plans. 



 



 


 Direct staff to schedule the public hearing to be held before the 
 Board immediately after the Planning Commission&apos;s recommendation. 



 


 
The applicants understand that this motion does not 
 relieve them of any obligation, ordinance, or standards, and will not 
 prejudice the consideration of the application in any way. Supervisor 
 Bulova seconded the motion, which carried by a vote of eight, Supervisor 
 Kauffman and Supervisor McConnell being out of the room.

 an application to the County referenced as Special Exception Amendment 
 Application SEA 93-Y-005 for the McDonalds identified on the County 
 Tax Map as 54-4 ((5)) 1A. Supervisor Frey stated that the sole purpose 
 of this application is to modify the restaurants existing hours of 
 operation to allow the establishment to open one hour earlier seven 
 days a week.



 Supervisor Frey stated that the applicant requests 
 a modification of the approved hours of operation to respond to the 
 growing needs of County residents for restaurant service earlier in 
 the morning. All other development conditions shall remain unchanged. 
 Given the limited nature of this request, Supervisor Frey stated his 
 belief that it is appropriate to expedite the public hearing process.



 Therefore, Supervisor Frey moved that the Board 
 authorize expedited processing of this application, and to schedule 
 the public hearing to be held before the Board as soon as practicable 
 after the Planning Commission hearing.



 The applicant understands that this motion does 
 not relieve them of any obligation, ordinance or standards, and will 
 not prejudice the consideration of the applications in any way. Supervisor 
 Bulova and Supervisor Hyland jointly seconded the motion, which carried 
 by a vote of nine, Supervisor McConnell being out of the room.

47. COMMISSION ON AGING TO CELEBRATE ITS THIRTIETH 
 ANNIVERSARY (Tape 5)



Supervisor Gross said that the Fairfax County Commission 
 on Aging will celebrate its thirtieth anniversary on March 29. The Board 
 created the Commission by resolution on March 19, 1973, and its charge 
 was to &quot;identify and promote better understanding of the problems of 
 the aging and to plan and promote and, where it is found necessary, 
 conduct activities to contribute to their well-being.&quot;



Supervisor Gross noted that since the founding of the 
 Commission on Aging, Fairfax County&apos;s population of those 60-plus has 
 increased from 22,551 to 111,415, and that number continues to rise. 
 The Commission on Aging has faced many opportunities and challenges 
 in its first 30 years, and is poised to meet many more in the next 30. 
 In recognition of the excellent work by the Commission on Aging, Supervisor 
 Gross moved that the Board direct staff to invite members of the Commission 
 on Aging to the March 10, 2003, Board meeting to receive a resolution 
 of commendation in recognition of this significant anniversary. Supervisor 
 Hudgins seconded the motion.



Following a brief discussion, the question was called 
 on the motion and it carried by a vote of eight, Supervisor McConnell 
 and Supervisor Frey being out of the room.


 
48. NATIONAL DONOR AWARENESS WEEK (Tape 5)
 

 
Supervisor Gross said that the week of April 21-27, 
 2003, is National Organ Donor Awareness Week. Thousands of people receive 
 organ and tissue donations every year nationally, and that number is 
 in the hundreds locally. Supervisor Gross moved that the Board:


 
 


 Proclaim the week of April 21-27 as &quot;Organ Donor Awareness Week&quot; in Fairfax County. 



 



 


 Direct staff to invite the members of the Commission on Organ and 
 Tissue Donation and Transplantation to appear before the Board at 
 its April 7 meeting to receive the proclamation. 



 



 


 Direct staff to prepare a Certificate of Recognition to be presented 
 at the same time to the Old Dominion Eye Foundation, in tribute to 
 its successful efforts in promoting cornea donations. 



 


 
This motion, the second to which was inaudible, carried 
 by a vote of eight, Supervisor Frey and Supervisor McConnell being out 
 of the room.


 
49. TRAFFIC FLOW AT SCHOOLS (Tape 5)
 

 
Supervisor Kauffman said that he has repeatedly heard 
 from citizens expressing concern over traffic flow and safety for parents 
 and children entering and exiting public schools during the morning 
 and afternoon rushes. Increased traffic volumes on roadways and more 
 and more parents using &quot;kiss-and-ride&quot; facilities have elevated the 
 problem.



Supervisor Kauffman noted that the problem has grown 
 increasingly difficult as there is no single entity in charge of or 
 capable of resolving these issues. Any given correction must involve 
 the local school, School Facilities staff, the Virginia Department of 
 Transportation, police, and Department of Transportation staff.



Therefore, Supervisor Kauffman moved that the Board 
 direct staff to work with the School Facilities and other agencies needed 
 to report with appropriate guidelines schools can use to resolve or 
 preempt these complex traffic flow and safety problems. Supervisor Gross 
 seconded the motion.



Following discussion, the question was called on the 
 motion and it carried by a vote of eight, Supervisor Frey and Supervisor 
 McConnell being out of the room.


 
50. ROSE HILL - SECTION THREE (LEE DISTRICT) (Tape 
 5)
 

 
Supervisor Kauffman said that Rose Hill, Section Three 
 is an undeveloped, but already subdivided and rezoned, part of the original 
 Rose Hill Subdivision the rest of which was largely completed 40 years 
 ago. This particular section has tremendous amounts of marine clay and 
 steep slopes that have turned away numerous attempts to make development 
 economically viable.



Based on the complaints from the community over the 
 years about marine clay problems, Supervisor Kauffman moved that the 
 Board direct staff to:


 
 


 Review the existing density penalty provision in the Code of the 
 County of Fairfax, Chapter 112 (Zoning Ordinance). 



 



 


 Provide an evaluation of the possibility of applying the density 
 penalty to new construction in marine clay areas that are already 
 subdivided, but not yet built. 



 


 
Supervisor Hudgins seconded the motion and it carried 
 by a vote of seven, Supervisor Connolly, Supervisor Frey, and Supervisor 
 McConnell being out of the room.



51. WAIVER OF FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SPRINGFIELD-FRANCONIA 
 HOST LIONS CLUB CHARITIES, INCORPORATED (LEE DISTRICT) (Tape 5)



Supervisor Kauffman noted that the Springfield-Franconia 
 Host Lions Club Charities, Incorporated has requested a waiver of the 
 application fees for permits associated with the flea markets held annually. 
 The flea markets are held on alternating Saturdays from April through 
 November.



Supervisor Kauffman therefore moved that the Board 
 waive the application fees for 21-day permits associated with the Springfield 
 Host Lions Club Charities, Incorporated 2003 flea markets. Supervisor 
 Hyland seconded the motion and it carried by a vote of seven, Supervisor 
 Connolly, Supervisor Frey, and Supervisor McConnell being out of the 
 room.



52. EXPEDITED PROCESSING FOR SPECIAL EXCEPTION 
 APPLICATION SE 2002-BR-044 ANNANDALE PLAY-CARE, INCORPORATED AT RAVENSWORTH 
 BAPTIST CHURCH (BRADDOCK DISTRICT) (Tape 5)



Supervisor Bulova said that Annandale Play-Care, Incorporated 
 provides childcare at Ravensworth Baptist Church in Annandale. Until 
 recently, the applicant also provided the same level of childcare at 
 Saint Barnabas Church in the same area for a smaller number of children. 
 Programming needs at Saint Barnabas have made it impossible for Annandale 
 Play-Care to continue to provide childcare at this second location. 
 For this reason, the applicant would like to increase enrollment at 
 Ravensworth Baptist Church to provide care for the children who have 
 been moved out of Saint Barnabas. From a State licensing perspective, 
 the applicant can meet all requirements for the larger number of children.



Supervisor Bulova noted that neither staff nor the 
 adjacent residents have any problem with this application. This application 
 is scheduled for a public hearing by the Planning Commission on Wednesday, 
 March 5, 2003.



Supervisor Bulova therefore moved that the Board direct 
 staff to expedite processing for Special Exception Application SE 2002-BR-044 
 and to schedule a public hearing to be held before the Board on March 
 10, 2003, at 4 p.m. This motion, the second to which was inaudible 
 carried by a vote of seven, Supervisor Connolly, Supervisor Frey, and 
 Supervisor McConnell being out of the room.



53. MARCH IS DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES INCLUSION 
 MONTH (Tape 5)



Supervisor Bulova said that throughout the US, March 
 will be celebrated as Developmental Disabilities Inclusion Month. In 
 Fairfax County, during the month of March, the Arc of Northern Virginia, 
 in conjunction with People First, a self-advocacy group for people with 
 developmental disabilities, and the Fairfax-Falls Church Community Services 
 Board, educate the public about the abilities and needs of people with 
 developmental disabilities and their families.


 
 Therefore, Supervisor Bulova moved that the Board:
 


 


 Proclaim March as &quot;Developmental Disabilities Inclusion Month&quot; in Fairfax County. 



 



 


 Direct staff to invite the Arc and others to appear before the Board 
 to receive the proclamation on February 24, 2003. 



 


 
The second to this motion was inaudible.



Following discussion, with input from Merni Fitzgerald, 
 Director, Office of Public Affairs, the question was called on the motion 
 and it carried by a vote of eight, Supervisor Frey and Supervisor McConnell 
 being out of the room.

A brief discussion ensued.



Supervisor Hudgins asked unanimous consent that information 
 from Arlington County be included in staff response. Without objection, 
 it was so ordered.

55. MOUNT VERNON DISTRICT&apos;S SIXTEENTH ANNUAL 
 TOWN MEETING REVISITED (Tape 5)



Supervisor Hyland distributed to Board Members copies 
 of the Mount Vernon Voice and the Mount Vernon Gazette ,

 25, 2003. The meeting, which was started 16 years ago, remains 
 a popular event.

56. EXPEDITIOUS AND CONCURRENT PROCESSING 
 FOR SPECIAL EXCEPTION AMENDMENT APPLICATION SEA 97-V-003 (Tape 
 5)



Supervisor Hyland moved that the Board direct staff 
 to provide expeditious and concurrent processing for Special Exception 
 Amendment Application SEA 97-V-003. It is understood that this 
 motion would not relieve the applicant from complying with provisions 
 of any applicable ordinances, regulations, or adopted standards and 
 does not prejudice the consideration of this application in any way. 
 Supervisor Kauffman seconded the motion and it carried by a vote of 
 eight, Supervisor Frey and Supervisor McConnell being out of the room.



57. NEW GUIDE TO EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS (Tape 5)



(NOTE: Earlier in the meeting there was additional 
 discussion regarding this item. See Clerk&apos;s Summary Item CL#2.)



Chairman Hanley reminded Board Members of the new guide 
 to emergency preparedness which is now on the County&apos;s website. It replaces
