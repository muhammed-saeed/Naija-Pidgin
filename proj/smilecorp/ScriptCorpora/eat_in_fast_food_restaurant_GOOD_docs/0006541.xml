How to handle your mistakes like a pro

by Eric Shannon on November 4, 2011 · 64 comments 
 
 N o one knows better than a boss that everyone makes mistakes. But not everyone handles them the same way. When you make a mistake, your boss will be watching you closely and asking himself these questions:

Am I dealing with someone who:

 learns easily from mistakes or repeats them endlessly? tells the simple truth or creates confusion to hide behind? sincerely accepts responsibility or just tells me what I want to hear? really hears and understands me? 

 Your boss will consider the cost of your mistakes to be part of his investment in you . It’s a cost of doing business. Your job when you report a mistake is to convince your supervisor that his investment is a good one. You can do that by following this checklist:

 report your mistakes early so your boss doesn’t find out about them from someone else apologize without assigning blame to others and without sounding defensive do whatever you can to correct your mistake and do it quickly show you thought about what led to your mistake summarize and say back to your boss his message to you, for ex:“I hear you saying that this was a costly mistake for the company at a time when…”and then commit to not making that mistake again and explain how you will avoid it 

 Fully accepting a mistake, making repairs and avoiding repetition is extremely difficult . Maybe one of the most difficult things in life. And that’s one of the few advantages you have in this situation—your boss knows how hard it is. So do it right and you’ll show what you’re made of. If you’re lucky, you may just come out ahead!

I always make mistakes on the job, I’m human. When I do make a mistake I try not to repeat it for a second time. I’m a barista and when I first started I made many mistakes. My boss whould ask me what I did wrong or what I forgot to do and I would confess what I did, and that it will not happen again. Its simply easy to know you made a mistake take responsibility for it and keep learning.

The Bigger the mistake the harder it is owning up to it. On the other hand, the bigger the mistake the bigger the lesson that will be learned. When I was working as a waitress, I would always be as kind as possible but quick on my feet because we were always so busy. We had huge black trays that would hold all of the food as we carried it out to the customer. One day, I had a really big order and I tried to carry everyone’s food on one tray at once because we were busy that day. Im struggling to hold the tray up but I don’t turn around and as I walk out of the kictchen door my arms give out and I dropped the entire order of food all over the floor. I made a huge mistake that day and learned to get the order out as quickly as possible without over doing it.

I used to work at a fast-food restaurant where I made several mistakes specially when I started working there.  Not having the ingredients ready and messing up the order were the most common errors I had and every time I made a mistake I would be scared to tell my manager what had happened.  Facing the situation and explaining my manager with the truth what really happened and accepting the responsibility helped me becoming a responsible employee by not repeating any mistakes and later on be ascended to a supervisor position.  On every mistake I made I always told my boss the truth and admitted it was my fault, also I made my best to not repeat that error.  This made me learned from my mistakes and also made my boss to trust in  me.

Mistakes happen all the time. However, I believe that it is important to try and prevent a potential mistake first. When working at my internship this summer, there were a lot of rules that had to be followed and I was expected to know them on my first day. For the first couple of weeks I would ask my mentor to help me out to prevent me from making a mistake in the first place as mistakes were extremely costly. Then as I became more comfortable with the rules, I would ask other interns in the office if what I was doing seemed correct. However, mistakes were still made and I would make a list of things to watch for and keep in mind in the future and keep this list on my desk. Preventing the same mistake is also extremely important–it’s not just about making the mistake and accepting it but how you improve and learn from the mistakes you make.

People often say that we must face our mistakes, yet we overlook the fact that it can be one of the hardest things to do in our lives. Mustering up the courage to confront those who have been affected by our mistakes is something that many people struggle with and often avoid for various reasons. Despite the difficulty of it, we must all face our mistakes in order to be successful in life. Not only must we face our mistakes but also learn from them. Working in an office this past semester introduced me to many new situations. Once I accidentally lost some data on an important file and I was reluctant to tell my supervisor about it. I could have just closed it and no one would have known that there was data missing until later and also I feared that I could be looked down upon or even fired for making such a mistake. However, I decided to tell my supervisor and apologize for my carelessness. It turned out that the file was backed up on her external hard drive, but apart from that, through this situation, she was able to gain more trust in me. Also, I was able to become more comfortable around my own supervisor. Just by confronting my mistakes without any lies created a more positive working environment. There are many good things that will come from simply accepting your mistakes and dealing with them rather than trying to avoid them for as long as possible because they will eventually catch up to you.
 Ashley L Ruiz 
As a supervisor one my biggest pet peeves is when employees do not take responsibilities for their faults. Everyone makes mistakes and sometimes those mistakes cost the company money, but that is never a reason to deny that the mistake was made. I believe that confess your failures means that you able to self examine yourself as well as learn from what you did wrong. The key to mistakes is learning from them and trying to avoid making the same mistake twice.
 Carmen 
This is totally common sense in all relationships including in employment.
Taking responsibility for mistakes may seem hard at first but when considering the cost of hiding and skating around lies, telling the truth makes it so much simpler.  There is the bonus of learning attached to it too!
 Manders_hughes 
Taking responsibility for your mistakes is hard for some people, for me its always been easy.  Every since I was a child I wanted to be perfect, perfection is still what I try to strive for.  So when I make a mistake I immediatly find out what went wrong and try to fix things.  I work in a pharmacy and when I first started to work there I made tons of mistakes, But I wouls ask qurestions and learned how to keep from making them.
 Pbescalante 
When you make a mistake, no matter how big or how small, you must own it. Try to fix it if possible, if not, do not hide and pretend nothing happened. Your boss might hear about your mistake from soeone else and might not like it. Be responsible and own up to your mistakes, We are only human and as such we make mistakes. The important thing is to earn from our mistakes and stop making the same one over and over again.
 Bn Eason22 
I completely agree with these points. However, some people have trouble accepting that they can be wrong or just chooses to accept that they are wrong. I use to be this way until I was put into leadership role. Then I realized through other peoples mistakes that is what I look like at times. Now I try to keep on improving on my responsibilties.

Shortly after turning 21, I landed a job at a small liqueur store in my hometown. Although there was a fair amount of walk in customers throughout the day, the companies main profit came from delivering alcohol to the bars around our area. So, while working there, my main job was to box up orders, and wait on customers whenever they came in (I was the only person that worked the night shift).

One night things were really hectic, and I was way behind on my orders due to the amount of customers that came in. After it finally slowed down, I was flying around trying to catch up, and in my rush, I broke one of the most expensive bottles in the store! While cleaning up the mess, my mind flooded with ideas on how to get out of this without telling my boss what truly happened. Eventually, however, I knew that the only real solution was to tell the truth, and I did (he was happy I told the truth and I didn’t get into trouble)!

It doesn’t matter whether its work, family, or friends, good morals will get you a long way with people, and they will respect you for it!

I have worked for 2 Japanese companies and have learned to accept responsibility for my mistakes.  In doing this, you also gain their trust.  When they see that you are willing to take responsibility for your mistakes and learn the necessary lessons to keep those mistakes from happening again, they are more willing to trust you with greater responsibilities.

I work in a biomedical research laboratory, and this has help me to learn from my mistakes. Sometimes, it is difficult to accept them because make you feel bad; however, we should have maturity to accept and learn from them.

Throughout high school, I worked in the dining room of a retirement community. It was my first job and I was new to absolutely everything.  Friday afternoons were the busiest time for the dining room and all the servers would try to help one another. When a server asked me to cover her table once, I did my best to help her, while attempting to maintain my own table’s satisfaction. Being new, I could not manage the quick pace and left my fellow server’s table unhappy. My fellow server was later confronted about“her”poor service. As embarrassing as it was, I stepped up and admitted that it was I that had not properly served her table. It was a serious mistake to try to take on another table on top of my own. Regardless of my mistake, my boss appreciated my ability to take responsibility for my actions and once my waiting skills improved I was promoted to hostess. I’ve learned that mistakes will always be made, but if one can accept fault and learn from their mistakes then one may reap the benefits.

I agree with what was stated above, I believe that if an individual can not accept responsibility for their actions when they make a mistake, they can not change. Accepting responsibility for your actions allows you to be able to improve. This  is something that affects not only your professional life but your personal life as well. I teach my daughter that in every action that you takes there is a reaction, and if you make a mistake accept responsibility, because if you dont you will never be able to improve.

As an indoor soccer referee, it was easy for me to make bad calls and not receive a good reaction from the coaches, parents, and players. With indoor soccer, a lot of the rules have been altered to make the game more suitable for the arena. I have found that if I clarify any rules I am unsure of before hand, it makes it a lot easier to make the right call. Even though I try my best, no referee is perfect and I can miss some calls or make the wrong ones. When these mistakes are made, I make an effort to ask my boss what the right action should have been. Since I ask these questions and clear up any misunderstandings, whenever the coaches try to attack me with their own input on how the game should be handled, my boss is always on my side and stands up for me. He knows that I am doing my best and that I know the game. I think this strategy has really helped me because I have been asked to come back four years in a row.

I know the impact of mistakes and costing the company money. In my position I set up corporations and estate plans for our client. Any kind of misspelling of a name or the wrong manger on the list can cost the company anywhere from $125 to $1,000. One day I set up the part of the Estate Plan with the wrong name. I could have easily went in and fixed it without telling my manager. (which is stealing) Although I felt stupid for making the mistake. I took it to my manager saying sorry for the mistake, gladly he told me everyone makes mistakes and to just watch my work a little bit better. It felt good knowing that I told him and that one day if it ever popped up with upper management, At least my manger knew about it.

Responsiblity for a person actions are important to the people around, and for yourself worth.  This is the one thing that I believe in when it comes to work ethic and family values.  If only more people learned how being responsiblity for your mistakes can earn you respect.
Thank you

Taking responsibility for your mistakes takes courage, but doing so shows that you are willing to learn from your mistakes and grow your knowledge.  Making a decision that is wrong is always better than making no decision at all.
 Loriann023 
Being an adult and knowing when you did something wrong is important to success. I have worked in retail a a lot, which is a very demanding work place. Making a mistake is simple in this environment. When learning how to work with a register and do specific things that a customer needs requires a lot of patience. I had made a lot of mistakes trying to charge a credit card or even balancing the drawer. By going directly to the manager when the issue happens, helps to solve the mistake quickly before any others arise.
 Alleyv15 
Owning up to mistakes can be a difficult task to tackle.  Adults strive to be perfect and to not make mistakes when working, however change is inevitable and sometimes certain factors are overlooked.

I have worked as a business manager and often times policies would change without warning.  There are several occasions in which receipts were not documented correctly which would throw off the numbers for the entire day.  My general manager took ultimate responsibility for these errors and would spend hours trouble shooting trying to find the glitch in the system.  Had I not owned up to my actions I would have set myself up for failure.  The truth is bound to come out and because I was honest about the mistakes they were easily corrected.  I found out later in life after taking a few accounting classes that those“minor”mistakes that I made could have caused“major”issues for the owners of the company and the IRS.  Owning up to your mistakes is imperative in the workforce.
 Keshawnadavis 
I believe that when you admit that you have made a mistake it shows that you are willing to learn from it. Everybody makes mistakes but the most important thing is to learn from those mistakes. I think that makes you a stronger person and an employer can recognize that they dont have to call you out everytime you do something wrong because you are willing to help yourself. Also, its better to call out your own  mistakes instead of an employer having to find out later another way. It shows you care about your job and your duties and you are willing to improve.
 Xochitl1003 
During the journey of our job experiences, we come across different situations that require our professionalism. As humans we are prone to make mistakes due to several reasons; stressful situations, last minute tasks, multitasking, pressure, dealing with other co-worker’s personalities, etc. However, it is our opportunity to demonstrate how we handle our mistakes. Personally, the times that I have made a mistake at work, I have decided to speak with my immediate superior and explain the situation. By explaining the situation, I discuss where I could have addressed the situation differently and how was to be handled. The main idea is to not perform the same mistake and find the root of the cause. In my opinion, this will show your immediate supervisor how responsibly we take our job and how we are finding the solution to the mistake. At the end of the day, our immediate supervisor only focuses on the interests of the company, and by acting professional on a mistake will demonstrate the value we have as an employee and as an important asset to the company. We should never argue with our immediate supervisors and learn to listen. In the professional world, each mistake helps us to improve and become better individuals. Finally, not forgetting how important is each employee.

One incident occured where I accidently faxed patient information to the wrong person. After this happened, I confronted my manager with my mistake, instead of trying to cover it up. When something like this happens, we have to take extra steps to make sure that the documents are shredded properly. Because I work in a health care environment, we have to be extremely cautious about protecting patient information. Any mistakes I make will be reported to management. I admit my mistakes, learn from them, and strive to never make the same mistake twice.
 Cov 
We have to admit when we make a mistake or do something wrong in especially in the  work enviroment.  It is part of being human, the worst is when people try to hide or cover up there mistakes and comes back and bits them at some point.  Since i  work in customer service it is  bond to happen once in a while, the importance is learning from your mistakes.  This shows your employeer that you are reliable and dependable no matter how big the mistake was. It is always better to come clean before your boss find out by others.

We have to accept our mistakes because sometimes we can’t tell by ourselves if what we did was wrong or not, so I think we have to understand it if someone try to let us know our mistakes. I think sometimes too the bosses have to take it easy on people because I think everyone makes mistakes.
 Takia Clayton 
Taking Ownership of your mistakes is what makes you an adult. A lot of times we as humans make mistakes and don’t want to take ownership, therefore we don’t learn the lesson. but when we do take responsibility of the mistake we accept our flaws and learn the lesson.

It is my experience that taking responsibility of your mistakes shows your employer that you have the company best interest at hand. Your boss will respect and trust you once they know you are a person of integrity. It is far better to admit your mistakes when they first occur, rather than wait to try to cover them up. I remember starting with my company and my boss put me in charge of organizing a district function. I forgot to request the funds to organize and execute the the function in a timely manner. Once I realized my error I immediately contacted my boss and explained the situation, she was able to clear the funds for me. It was a lesson learned. She did thank me for being honest and bringing this information to her in a timely manner. That incident has taught me to pay attention to details.

In banking it is so easy to make mistakes.  My mistake would be to not always check what the customer gave me.  Computers mess up and won’t catch everything.  I’ve learned to always stay on top of what I’m doing.  When money and reputation is involved you cannot afford those mistakes.  I took the loss and learned very early during my career to check behind my customers but most importantly myself.
 Mr. Achiever 
Take responsiblity for your actions and mistakes. We as humans will always make mistakes, however, it is up to us to decide whether to learn from the mistake or just disregard it. One of the most successful basketball players, Michael Jordan, said“I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life and that is why I succeed.”In other words, don’t be afraid to make mistakes, simply learn from them and come back smarter!
 Bajan6163 
Accepting responsibility for mistakes shows growth. The important step is to ensure that mistakes are part of the learning process . Always place honesty first, never cover up, and apply all principles learned in the process. Recognizing mistakes and learning from them can create the path to success.
 Ochesim 
Accept responsibility for your mistakes it does not kill you but instead makes you better and not letting you make such mistake next time but instead you improve in your job the next time.

My biggest problem is not admitting to a mistake, but rather taking the full blame without making up excuses. There is a very fine line between explaining the cause of a mistake and sounding like you are trying to put the blame elsewhere. As human beings we all make mistakes but it can be very hard to admit that we did so, especially when they are careless.
 Angel Bond74 
If making mistakes were a crime, I would be spending the remainder of my life behind bars. I have learned over the years, I will make mistakes and I will have to fix them. Being able to learn from mistakes is one of the greatest abilities someone can master. I have always lived by the motto,“It is not how many times you fall down, but the number of times you get back up that matter.”This is so true with mistakes. No matter the number of mistakes we make, we have to fix them and move on.
 Erica Davis 
In making many mistakes in my life i think it becomes easier with age to admit that you are wrong. Years have passed since ive graduated High School and i have held down many jobs with many different responsibilites. More recently i have been working for a nursing agency in which i am responsible for pulling all of our employees professinal licenses two times per month, however after a mishap i learned that what i thought was my master list was not. Turns out that i had misfed the information into the system and forgotten almost 20 nurses on this monthly check for months. WIthout hesitation i pulled the missing nurses immediantly only to find out that one of thier licenses had been pulled, making them ineligible to work. After notifying my superiors i wrote a formal apology and read it aloud at our weekly meeting. Being wrong never feels good, but it sure feels alot better when you can admit it like an adult. Fessing up to this mistake gained me respect from alot of my coworkers and taught me to double and triple check my work in the future.

Without mistakes, there is no learning. The most productive and successful people in this world will tell you that they had the guts to take risks and enough humility to make mistakes. It is from one small mistake or failure that the the road to success begins.
 Griff 
There’s one thing I believe in: if you never make mistakes, your simply not working! Everyone makes mistakes, goodness knows I’ve made my fair share in the past. The intriguing thing is, I am grateful for the learning experience each one has brought, without them I would not be the problem solver I am today, if I was afraid of making them, I would not have the confidence or courage to be an innovator. Even the greatest plans are usually a refined second attempt.  Employers do not want to hear you made a mistake, this was taught to me years ago. Employers want to hear“This is a mistake I have made, and THIS is what I am doing to correct it.”it’s the humility to admit responsibility and show your creative side when fixing the mistake, that oftern sets a good-experience apart from a bad one.

I’ve learned over the years to accept responsibility for your mistakes and store them in your memory bank so when you come across that type of situation again, you would be able to handle it differently.  Everyone wants to see you make a mistake, but if you own up to it people will have more respect for you and are willing to help you to correct the problem. Also, it will give other confidence that they can come to you with help with a mistake or a problem.
 Kat89447 
Accepting responsibility for mistakes has been a lesson I learned the hard way. No one wants to be embarrassed by lack of knowledge, but having made many mistakes I learned the only thing to be embarrassed about  was to keep making the same mistakes. I discovered that everyone makes mistakes and by sharing knowledge and teaching others how to avoid them helps both people become better employees. Shared knowledge and working together makes everyone more productive and successful. I have learned more skills from my mistakes and learning how to correct them, than I ever did from my successes.
 Laesha Stephens 
I had an experience in my life in which I had to accept responsibility for my mistake. I had the responsibility of making sure other people do the right thing and warn them if they weren’t. My mistake, while still learning my job, was that I did not warn people properly so that they understand that what they were doing was wrong. As I was confronted about this mistake, I found that I accepted it almost as this lesson stated. I apologized for it without putting blame on someone else, and I repeated the message my boss was telling me in order to let him know that I understood. And in the future, I vowed to do better.

Responsibility is not only what we are responsible in our life, profession or family.  The term responsibility means to me is the ability to response even though it may not fall under my area.  In our day today life,  we encounter situations where we have the ability to address the situation or support some one who is in desperate but most of the time we will wait for the responsible person to come and take care of it. Most people are fear about it’s after effect,  if something goes wrong if we do something unusual or go out of way and do something and blame come to us.  If we do anything for a right cause and we done our level best, still had a reverse effect, I will be proud of what I done rather no action.

A smart person learns from his/her mistakes, and a wise person learns from the mistakes of others.

I feel that making mistakes becomes a part of living life. When you have made a mistake, it does not mean that you have failed, it means you have another chance to master your craft. We must all accept our mistakes and be held accountable.
In relation to your job, learning a mistake and being responsible will strengthen your next task and performance. Many people are frighten what might possibly happen after making a mistake. I would suggest giving it your all and if a mistake occurs, feel good that you did your best.
 Zack 
As many have noted a smart person learns from their mistakes. Well I feel a smart person also makes them as well. If you are making mistakes then you are trying. I would rather be the person that tried and failed rather then a person that failed to try. Failure to try is the real mistake.

My first full-time job was my dream job at the time, selling broadcast video production equipment for a well-respected dealer.  I sold the boss my ability to sell and product knowledge and got the job.  I made one mistake after another in what was a critical time for learning.  I dropped a $8000 professional video camera, and I told customers what they wanted to hear sometimes because I feared telling them that I did not know.  Sometimes I believed that I was right and then found out later that I was wrong.  The most important lesson I learned in this job was to acknowledge my mistakes, rather than try to cover them.  This lesson prepared me for other jobs.  I now work in the health care field, and the consequences of reporting information that is not correct just to protect myself can have severe consequences.  If there is one thing that can make a person successful, it is to acknowledge one’s mistakes and learn from them.  I will echo Jay’s sentiment.  A wise person learns from the mistakes of others.  Company policies usually exist because of other people’s mistakes.  A wise person would acknowledge that.

My first job I was 17 and fresh out of high school and about to start college. So I was new to working and my boss was always on my case about everything I did. I was either to slow and not working fast enough but the only thing that he hated most was excuses. If I made a mistake I would take responsibility for it but I would alway throw in the‘but’something else. It wasn’t till the store manager took me into the office and told me to just stop all she wanted to hear was I made a mistake and thaI was going to fix it. Ever since that day I have always taken responsibility and always combated my mistake with a solution.
 Natalia B 
This is the toughest lesson for me to learn because I get defensive when I make mistakes.  I find it very hard to accept that I make mistakes and have been battling this issue and trying to learn to accept and own up to my mistakes and accept critisism, no matter how hard it is to hear it.  My initial reaction is that it’s not my mistake, something was faulty and it caused the mistake. That, ofcourse doesn’t help the situation and hurts me.  This is dfinitely a lesson that I will have to remind myself.
over and over again.

This is a lesson that everybody should acknowledge and learn from. Being a server at Disney is fun but extremely diffficult. It is Disney, you are suppost to be perfect in everything you do for the guest. When making mistakes cost you and your manager money, it can be a little overwhelming. The first step is atdmitting you made a mistake. Correct the problem in the most professional an timly manner. As long as the guest is happy that is the most important. You learn from your mistakes and move on. Serving for seven years you see alot and mess up occasionally. It is very important to realize that everyone is not perfect and you live and you learn!

My first job was as an oven boy for our town’s cheapest pizza restaurant.  I had just turned 16 and was scared that I wasn’t going to make it.  To make matter worse, my training consisted of 10 minutes of demonstration.  I started my first day without any experience and on the busiest day of the week.  The mistakes came tumbling in faster than Niagara Falls.  My boss confronted me on these mistakes and at first I denied them, I blamed someone else, or I simply ignored the accusations.  My boss later told me that he almost fired me because I wasn’t able to take responsibility for my mistakes.  When I began to accept my mistakes my quality of work improved drastically.  Not only did my boss help me learn from my mistakes, he also taught me how to fix my mistakes.  As I began to become comfortable in my working environment I stopped making the same mistakes over and over again.  My Dad always tells me that my first job wasn’t about making money, it was about what I took away from that job.  My first job taught me that it is okay to make mistakes and that taking responsibility for them is the best course of action.

Handling a mistake like a pro is not only taking responsibility for his or her action but also learning from those mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes at some point in their life; however, it is what you take from the mistake that matters. As a stay at home parent, the mistake I face was telling my daughter what to do instead of showing her. For example, I would tell her how important school is but I did not finish school. So, instead of just telling my daughter that having a good quality education is very important, I decided to return to school to be an example for her. The lesson learned here is that action speaks louder than words. My decision to return to school has not only shown her that education is important; but also it is never too late chaise your dreams.

As a perfectionist I have to say I struggle when I make mistakes. I mean nobody likes making them, but we know they’re inevitable. The truth is that they are indeed another chance for growth and improvement. All you need is temperance. The first job I ever had was at a local McDonald’s; I will never forget my first day because I dropped 6 burgers. I felt so embarrassed but then I realized the only thing that could come out as a result of that was something called“experience”.

Mistakes are always forgivable, you just have to have the courage to admit them, it is best to admit them quickly, and get on with improving at what you’re doing. Actually, identifying the causes of the mistake is something I like to do and have found extremely helpful, as I take the time to analyze what I should/could have done differently and commit to do it right.

I also remember my accounting professor in high school would always say:“accounting is 30% theory and 70% practice; do you want to really LEARN about accounting? Get an accounting job”. And so I did; it was only then that I understood what he meant. People can give you advice on what to do or what no to do based on their past experience and mistakes they’ve made, and you can certainly learn some from that; but you will never fully know, until you start living it out and making your own mistakes.

Not that you should intentionally do things wrong, but there are things that you cannot learn through other people, things that go beyond theory and cannot be understood until you actually experience them. That is why sometimes your mistakes can be great teachers, provided that you learn from them. Something good to remember: if you get to a point where you are no longer making mistakes, it’s probably because you’re not doing anything.

Mistakes are always hard, and I know that I personally have a difficult time dealing with them.  However, in the professional world I know that it is very important to admit your mistakes right away, simply because certain errors can have a major impact on the person that made them, and the employer as well.

My very first job was at a law office during the summer, and I was under a tremendous amount of pressure in the beginning, simply because I felt that I had to be perfect, because everyone in the office had so much experience.  I remembered that I filed something incorrectly and one of the lawyers could not find the client’s information.  I knew right away that I had made a major mistake, but I came clean for the benefit of the client, myself, and my employer.  Once I confessed my mistake, I started looking for the file, and the problem was solved quickly.

Overall, the best way to be a great worker is by building a relationship with a boss based on honestly and determination.  Of course it’s normal to make mistakes, but the way one goes about correcting their mistakes is even more important than confessing, because it shows admirable character.

Working in the business world as long as I have, you learn first hand that it is true that everone makes mistakes.  Because mistakes are not something unusual the way you handle them are very important.  I have personally learned that it is better to own your mistake and correct it if possible.  Working as an executive assistant, I am responsible for travel for several managers who travel a lot and it’s very important to make sure that all details for the trip have been finalized and confirmed.  Because many of the trips take place overseas, there is an issue of time zones as well as language barrier. There was an occasion where I made flight reservations for 6 different managers going to six different areas of the world.  I once made the mistake of forgetting to reserve a hotel for one of the managers.  Over the weekend while they were traveling, I remembered in the middle of the night and I had to get up and call the area where he was going to find a hotel that was available.  Luckily for me I was able to find one and send him a message with the information about where to go after he landed.  Being the professional I am, I admitted my mistake after he returned from his trip and told him of my strategy to avoid this type of mistake in the future.  He was very understandable, I would say especially since he ended up with a place to stay. .  If not it could have been very detrimental for me in my position.  An executive traveling 18 hours with no place to stay for the night.  My luck was finding a nice place near the area where he was meeting.

Since then, I have a checklist that I make for each traveler and I email them their full itinerary before their departure date.  This will immediately make me aware of anything that I may have forgotten.

For many it is hard to admit mistake because of fear of the consequences, but it’s better to admit them and accept the consequences then to have them exposed later where you may suffere a bigger consequence. The action of being true to yourself is what makes a professional different from a beginner.

One of the things I learned early on in my career is that everyone will make mistakes. I have yet to see in my 17 years of work experience to prove otherwise. The difference is how you react to the mistake. If you know you made an error, own up to it. Do you know how many times I have been written up for making a mistake? None! Upon discovering the mistake I would discuss the error with my supervisor and explain what I did wrong, what I could of done differently, and how could it of changed the results. I may of got a tongue lashing or two, but in the end we saw eye to eye. Not always was I the discoverer of the error. In this case I would own up to the mistake, and take the feedback positively. The thing I can say that has made me successful is not making the same mistake twice. On the flip side, if you are the ones correcting someone, make sure you give them the opportunity to discover what they did wrong and how it may of changed the results.

Owning up to a mistake is hard but it makes you a stronger person and shows you are human. No one is perfect. I would not expect anyone to be perfect. I had actually made a mistake about a medication and I gave the wrong medication to the wrong person. Though it was only vitamins It could have been worse. I got side tracked and before I knew it I handed the medication to the person sitting next to the intended reciever of the pills.

After graduation I worked for the“Urban League”of my area. My job title was to handle the enrollment for the upcoming DayCamp and to help with the food ordering and stocking. I was on a team of about 5 other recent highschool grad. With only a brief orientation of our duties i was on my own. It was difficult hard but i thought i had it!
The beginning was rough, but once I overcame my pride and realize my mistakes, it became easier.
Knowledge is for ever expanding and guess what? We dont know it all but there is always someone who can help you. EVERY STRIVING PERSON HAS FAILED OR MADE A MISTAKE , ITS LEARNING FROM THEM THAT WILL MAKE YOU SUCCESSFUL.

I am very blessed that this is an area that I handle well. At some point in my life I figured out how to handle constructive criticism well, and have managed to use it advantageously in my career: After a review early in my career concluded with my boss complimenting me on that ability, I realized that it was something I needed to continue to nurture and develop. When I worked for someone who criticized everything that I did, the people that we both worked for knew my reputation, and knew that I could be counted on to be honest and open, even in my mistakes.

Mistakes are definitely part of growing and learning–in fact, I’ve gotten to the point of referring to mistakes as“learning opportunities”. When those I’m training make mistakes, I say,“LEARNING OPPORTUNITY!”and proceed to explain what happened, how it happened, and how to correct it. I learned a long time ago that owning my mistakes allowed me to show my employers that I would accept responsibility for my actions, do my best to correct my own mistakes, teach others to avoid making the same mistakes, and that I can be trusted.
In Billy Joel’s song“Second Wind”, there is a line that says,“you’re not the only one who’s made mistakes, but they’re the only thing thing you can truly call your own”–and this is true. The sooner we accept that, the sooner we are able to realize our full potential and growth.

Right is right and wrong is wrong and everyone do make mistakes in the work place but it’s up to you to acknowledge the fact that what you may have done was wrong and accept full responsibility. Everone doesn’t agree with their boss but why put your job in jeapordy and start to create an hostile environment. So as for myself by me having a boss no! I don’t alway agree with what they may have to say but I most certainly isn’t going to approach her wrong. So it’s certain ways to go about resolving problems in the work place it depends on the person so with that being said some people just need to lear how to listen and take the feed back so it can better them later on down the line.

I hate making mistakes–I want everything I do to be perfect. However, the one thing I have learned over the years is to own up to mistakes, whether they are my fault or not. I do not believe in laying the blame on anyone else’s doorstep. I will take responsibility, even if the mistake was made by someone else who I am responsible for. I think it was my responsibility to communicate the needs better to the person who made the mistake, and that is my fault.

No one is perfect–I admit I am not perfect. If anyone says they are, they are either not telling you the truth or not truthful to themselves. The important lesson about making mistakes is to“own up to your mistakes”and learn from your same mistakes.

I remember in one of my jobs, I accidentally said something to an employee who misunderstood my statement. The employee went and inquired my statement with the Union representative. After noticing that maybe the employee misunderstood my statement, I immediately went over to the employee to clarify the mis-communication. In addition, I immediately clarified with the Union Rep about our mis-communication and notified upper management. The issue was resolved before anything was escalated and my boss was not put in a predicament.

I understand that it can be difficult to admit any mistakes or mis-communications. Admitting to your mistakes and quickly taking action resolved a potential problem for myself and my boss. I learned to be very careful with what you say to others and be clear–others may not interpret your intentions the same way that you interpret them.

During some points in our lives, it is acceptable for one to make mistakes. I definitely had plenty of them, and because I was so shy and honestly a bit afraid of my boss, I tried to hide them as much as possible. I had my first job as a lab assistant at the community college and I did enjoy it. I however, remember one event in which I had to prepare media by boiling the liquid on a hot plate. I was distracted by a classmate who kept talking to me and all of a sudden I hear the sound of liquid spilling over. I did not have a safety glove handy (which was my mistake) and soon there was a mess all over the lab. I was embarrassed and horrified!

Right as the incident occurred, my boss walks in furious knowing I was not cautious about watching the media. I knew it was my fault although I wanted to blame my classmate for distracting me. I did apologize and she forgave me (thank goodness) but I did learn a valuable lesson. Always be prepared and have necessary materials ready, and do not slack off from your duties. I never made that mistake again, but I continued working on my other weaknesses.

In order to become a professional learn from your mistakes. Once you made that mistake you will
not make it again and you know how to handle that particular situation. Mistakes is a part of
learning.
