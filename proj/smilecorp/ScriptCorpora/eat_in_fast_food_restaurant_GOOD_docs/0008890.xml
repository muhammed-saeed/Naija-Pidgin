Are you supposed to tip at Sonic?
 I have always wondered if you are supposed to tip the ppl that bring your food out, and if so, how much is reasonable? Would love it if ppl that have or currently do work at Sonic respond! Thanks!

 Best Answer - Chosen by Asker
 If you appreciate the service, (bringing your food to your car and not a drive-thru window is a service) you should be willing to tip. You don&apos;t HAVE TO tip, but let&apos;s face it, tipping may help to recognize and encourage good service. Often, I just round up or wave back the change. Even 10 percent is better tahn a sharp stick in the eye.

 erinsada… Yes! I work at Sonic, and it is very much preferred that people tip! That really is how we make our money for such a hard job (trust me there&apos;s never a moments rest)! So please, if you can afford to, make a carhop&apos;s day and give a tip!!

 Taylor Yes you should tip, But i think that they should pay more at least give the minimum wage. Working as a waitress/servant, you never know what there days are like even if its a $1 or $2 just try and give something every dollar counts just like at a restaurant they make there money from tips mostly.

 There are certain places that you tip and other places you don&apos;t. Sonic is not one of the places.

 My best friend in high school work at the local Sonic for three years. She said she was paid wait staff minimum wage, just like in a ‘real’ restaurant. So I guess you are expected to tip. I always do but that’s just how I was raised.

 Why would you tip, all they do is bring you a bag of food.

 I was told that waitresses/waiters at Sonic are paid the same way that other waitresses/waiters are at any other restaurant. Which means that they are paid lower than minimum wage and rely on tips to make a living. However, I do not know if that is true or not.

I just can&apos;t make myself tip at Sonic.

 No, don&apos;t tip, but I hear what you are saying. I usually face this dilema at Mexican places that aren&apos;t quite restaraunts--you go to a counter to order, they bring your food, and bus your table, but no one seats you, takes your order, or refills your drinks. I used to leave a buck at places like this, but I&apos;m not sure if that is just insulting.

After a while, I noticed that tip jars are bad luck. Any time I use one, my order is messed up. If it seems tipping is appropriate, I&apos;ll hand someone the tip.
