Face-lift helps Wendy&apos;s overthrow Burger King
 
With McDonald&apos;s entrenched as No. 1, Wendy&apos;s is moving into second place.
 By InvestorPlace Dec 2, 2011 1:23PM By Jeff Reeves 
 
 

 McDonald&apos;s ( MCD ) is the 800-pound gorilla of fast food. The $100 billion company turned quick-service restaurants into a science, has more than 33,000 locations worldwide, and is a heavyweight in breakfast and beverage sales in addition to selling burgers and fries.




It&apos;s nearly impossible to knock No. 1 McDonald&apos;s from its perch. So that&apos;s why fast-food restaurant Wendy&apos;s ( WEN ) is instead focused on the No. 2 spot and, according to reports, has dethroned Burger King to become America&apos;s second-most-popular burger joint.




The strategy? Higher-quality food, redesigned restaurants and marketing that showed American consumers who&apos;s the best -- behind McDonald&apos;s, of course.




It may sound silly to have a goal of second place. But it&apos;s important to be realistic. McDonald&apos;s dominates the marketplace with a 49.5% share of the &quot;limited-service burger segment&quot; business. Consider: With just a bit of growth, MCD will do more in sales than all of its competitors combined .




In 2010, Burger King&apos;s market share in the burger biz was 13.3%, while Wendy&apos;s share was 12.8%. But thanks to healthier options -- including skin-on fries seasoned with natural sea salt as well as higher quality fare like its premium Dave&apos;s Hot &apos;n Juicy Cheeseburgers line -- reports indicate big gains for Wendy&apos;s.




According to a report by Janney Capital Markets released Tuesday, Wendy&apos;s likely has passed Burger King in market share this year.



That may be a bragging point for Wendy&apos;s -- however, the U.S. &quot;limited-service burger segment&quot; is only a small piece of the fast-food pie. Chipotle ( CMG ) has been one of the biggest growth stories of the past few years -- with shares soaring over 260% since January 2010. Wendy&apos;s stock is up less than 10% in the same period.




Also, international growth is really what&apos;s fueling American-based restaurants. Take Yum! Brands ( YUM ). Almost 75% of its operating profits come from abroad, including from some 3,200 KFC locations in China -- and even KFCs in Kenya ! Even behemoth McDonald&apos;s has room to grow overseas, with the Golden Arches recently announcing a plan to open 700 stores in China over the next two years -- roughly one a day -- to build on its current total of 1,300 locations in the Middle Kingdom.




In short, a bigger bite out of the American burger market is nice…but not filling enough for a big restaurant stock these days.




Part of the reason restaurants like KFC and McDonald&apos;s do so well abroad is thanks to a well-followed brand in the U.S. Wendy&apos;s might be able to export its popularity later. However, with rivals like Yum! and Mickey D&apos;s already gobbling up international market share, it shouldn&apos;t focus too much on winning in the U.S. when the big profits are to be made overseas.

 Ewan Raven Dec 3, 2011 4:53PM I suppose it depends on where you live, I live in a small town and really enjoy BK, the employees are nice and attentive, I&apos;ve never had an issue with an incorrect order. I can go in and watch the news and get a triple whopper the way I like it (Ketchup Pickles and cheese) with onion rings that are decent, and some fairly decent fries (Haven&apos;t tried the new ones either.) Also, the &quot;microwave&quot; process can be beat if you get there early and they make fresh grilled burgers holy cow they&apos;re good.

McDonald&apos;s... well, I haven&apos;t had a burger there in over 6 year, it just got too small and the meat didn&apos;t taste like burger meat. But I still enjoy getting a hash brown there and their fries are decent, though the restaurant should you know be mopped once in a while.

Wendy&apos;s... I hate their new fries, I really liked their old ones. I haven&apos;t had a hamburger since the changes in the menu, but they were really good! I really liked their chicken nuggets and frosties, (Speaking of which anyone know how their new fries taste like when dipped in a frosty?) and of course their burgers. Fair price, and the restaurant was pretty clean, not as clean as my local BK but still.

Five Guys... I&apos;m sorry but no, this place is okay but too expensive and for me too &quot;hipster&quot; mainly because people put my burgers second to five guys and I cook some awesome hamburgers. Too greasy as well.

Hardees (Or Carl Jrs.) Love this place, wish there were more of them same level that burger king is at. And that my friends is my view on burger joints.

The food at my local BK&apos;s got so bad I quit eating there 5 years ago and have no plans to ever go back.The Wooper used to be great,but sadly no more.

Wendy&apos;s is very good but I am still undecided about their new Daves Cheeseburgers.Really​ like the new fries with the skin on and the sea salt.The Chili is great and their Chicken sandwich&apos;s are excellent.Never had bad food at a Wendy&apos;s

McDonalds breakfast is the best but their burgers just don&apos;t do it for me.Pretty Good fries.

No one has mentioned White Castle.Still love those sliders once in a while.

Heatmizer Dec 2, 2011 7:17PM &quot;The best burgers come from the gas grill that sits in my driveway, and the best fries come from the Fry Daddy that sits on my kitchen counter (using hand-cut white potatos or sweet potatos if I&apos;m feeling creative). Also, my milk shakes are way better than any fast-food joint&apos;s, and my apple pie, and my salads, and my brownies, and my everything else. Hell, even my ketchup, mustard and salt are better. McDonald&apos;s makes money. I make food.&quot;   Wait a second. You mean home cooking is better than fast food?!?!  What a strange concept.

Route212west Dec 2, 2011 6:56PM We have all the burger joints available and for my money, Carl&apos;s Junior is the best. 5 Guys is overpriced. Jack &apos;n the Box is probably second for the variety and the price. I teach 3 economics classes and although it&apos;s certainly not scientific, the stories the kids tell really makes me wonder how McDonalds keeps its lead. Portions, quality and service are all down and trail virtually every other chain. If you want a decent burger or burrito-give Carls Jr a try!

Once I ordered breakfast and all I got was a bun. I took it to the counter to complain and they threw it away. I waited and waited and waited and then asked where my food was. They said they didn&apos;t know what I was talking about. I had to drive till I found a McD to have breakfast. I haven&apos;t been back to a BK since.

[BRIEFING.COM] The Dollar Index has held small gains throughout the course of U.S. trade as early buying propelled the index through the 83.80 level and to its highest level in two years. The flight into dollars weighed on both the euro and the pound which are both trading lower by close to 0.5%. Early weakness dropped the euro to a two-year low near 1.2165 as bears look to test the June 2010 low in the 1.1900 area.
