Let&apos;s Have A Lovely Cup Of Tea
 Think of afternoon tea... what comes to mind? English ladies sat around a table sharing a pot of tea, maybe drinking from bone china cups and cocking their little fingers. That&apos;s what dreams are made of! Tea is a traditional drink served anytime of the day or night and is a must have for the vast majority of Brits... but not this one!

Traditionally, tea was brewed from loose leaves in a teapot and served in china cups and saucers. Nowadays it&apos;s more likely to be brewed directly in a mug using a teabag.

The Method For Making English Tea
 First pour fresh water into a kettle to boil. A pan on the stove top does the same job if you don&apos;t have a kettle.

Whilst the water is coming to the boil, prepare your cups and saucers ( or mugs) and the tea pot.

When the water in the kettle is boiling rapidly, pour some into the tea pot and swirl it round to warm the pot then tip it away. For two people, add 3 teaspoons of loose black tea leaves into the tea pot. Pour the remaining boiling water into the pot to brew the leaves.

Allow it to brew for around 3 or 4 minutes.

When you feel the tea is ready, add milk to taste to each cup, place the sieve on top of each cup as you pour the tea into them. This will strain the leaves and prevent them from entering the cup.

Add sugar if wanted and stir that tea! I seem to recall being told it had to be stirred clockwise but I have no idea why.

Take a digestive biscuit, dunk it in the tea and enjoy the flavours.

 Don&apos;t forget to add used tea leaves to the compost bin!

“Rosy Lee is Cockney For Tea! Fancy a nice cup of Rosy Lee?”
 Many people who still use traditional tea pots with loose leaf tea also use a Tea Cosy. These are what I can only describe as knitted or crocheted jackets for the tea pot.

They insulate the pot so while you&apos;re enjoying your first cuppa, the remaining tea in the pot is being kept hot ready for your second! Most people have two cups at a time.

Cosies come in all sorts of varieties. I grew up in 50/60&apos;s England surrounded by multi coloured crocheted woolly cosies. Of course there are ready made cosies some which sit right over the pot others are put directly onto the pot. The woolly ones are usually home made, maybe by Great Aunty Doris or whoever, but they can also be seen for sale at church fetes, school Fayres etc. A must have for the discerning tea drinker!

 Once opened, the contents of a pack of tea need to be kept fresh.

The way to keep tea in a perfect condition is to store it in a tea caddy. Tea caddies come in all shapes and sizes and made from a variety of materials.
