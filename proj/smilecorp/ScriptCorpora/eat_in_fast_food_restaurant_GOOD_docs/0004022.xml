Boat Crash update

Update on the boat crash involving Fish and Wildlife Officer Jason Reiff 
(note: this is the correct spelling of his name - it was inadvertently 
misspelled in the FWC release):

The victim&apos;s name: Jose Herrera, 59 years old from Hialeah.

Herrara is a sponger. He had a larger boat moored near the crash scene, but 
was going to or from that boat in a 12 foot sponging skiff at the time of the 
accident. He was in the Keys by himself. His wife, in Hialeah, has been notified 
about his death.

The autopsy&apos;s results, although preliminary, show signs of trauma and 
drowning consistent with a crash such as this. Final autopsy reports are 
pending, however.

The skiff the victim was riding in drifted away from the scene and has not 
yet been recovered. Law Enforcement agencies in the Keys are working together 
searching for it. Anyone who runs across a 12 foot sponging skiff, which was 
last seen floating upside down, should call the Sheriff&apos;s Office.
 
 
 
The following release is from the Fish and Wildlife Commission:

ONE DEAD IN BOAT COLLISION NEAR DUCK KEY MONDAY
 
 MARATHON A law enforcement patrol craft with the Florida Fish 
and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) collided with a 12-foot skiff at 
approximately 7:30 p.m., Monday, Dec. 30.

FWC Major Mike Long, Marathon said the occupant of the fishing skiff died and 
was apparently the only person aboard. Identification of the victim is being 
withheld until notification of family. The patrol craft operator, Officer Jason 
Rieff, 25, was uninjured. He is a two-year agency veteran.

The ongoing investigation is being overseen by the Monroe County Sheriffs 
Office.

After the collision, Officer Rieff entered the water and towed the victim to 
the beach, but was unable to revive him, the FWC reported. Long said an 
intensive search of the crash area last night by FWC, Monroe County Sheriffs 
Office craft, and vessels and aircraft of the U. S. Coast Guard, failed to 
locate any other victims or survivors who may have been aboard the skiff.

Neither vessel sank, Long said. The U. S. Coast Guard assisted in securing 
the accident scene.

Correction to yesterday&apos;s release about motorized scooters

I copied the following changes to Florida Statutes from The DHSMV web site, 
giving the details of what is and is not legal about motorized scooters: http://www.hsmv.state.fl.us/Leg2002.html 

&quot;Ch. Law 2002-20 HB 261 Traffic Effective 7/1/2002

316.003(21) A motor vehicle is any self-propelled vehicle not operated upon 
rails or guideway, but not including any bicycle, motorized scooter, electric 
personal assistive mobility device, or moped.

316.003(82) A motorized scooter is a vehicle not having a seat or saddle for 
the use of the rider, designed to travel on not more than three wheels, and not 
capable of propelling the vehicle at a speed greater than 30 mile per hour on 
level ground.&quot;

In essence, this says that a motorized scooter is legal to ride on the 
roadways for any age person, as long as it has no more than three wheels and as 
long as it does not have a seat on it.

We apologize for giving out incorrect information.

Man arrested for stabbing on Big Pine Key

 Big Pine Key Two men got into a fight at a residence on 
Avenue F Sunday night. One wound up in the hospital with a stab wound in his 
abdomen. The other is in jail for aggravated battery.

Deputies were dispatched to the home of 45 year old Michael Savage at 8:30 
p.m. where they found the victim, 32 year old John Doyle, bleeding from a stab 
wound in his stomach. Doyle told deputies hed been attacked by three unknown 
juveniles during a home invasion robbery. Deputies began searching the area for 
the alleged suspects, but none were located. They returned to the residence to 
continue their investigation, and discovered the real suspect, Savage, in the 
back bedroom of the home.

After speaking with Savage and several other witnesses, they were able to 
unravel the circumstances behind the incident. Savage said Doyle had come to his 
house earlier in the evening after having a dispute with his girlfriend. Doyles 
girlfriend then showed up and another argument began between them. Savage said 
he asked both Doyle and the girlfriend to leave and they did, but Doyle returned 
about 15 minutes later. At that point, Savage and Doyle reportedly began to 
argue, then began to push and shove each other. Savage said Doyle pushed him 
down and began to choke him. Thats when Savage said he took out his knife and 
opened it up. He says after he opened the knife, Doyle fell on the blade, which 
was driven into his stomach.

Doyle was airlifted to the Ryder Trauma Center in Miami by the Sheriffs 
TraumaStar helicopter. As of Sunday night he was in stable condition. Detectives 
have not been able to interview Doyle to find out his version of events.

Savage was arrested and charged with aggravated battery. Hes currently in 
the Monroe County Detention Center.

Animal body parts cause a stir in Port Antigua, Islamorada

 Islamorada People staying in an Islamorada neighborhood who 
were looking for seashells on the beach found more than they bargained for 
Sunday.

Several Miami residents, staying in the Port Antigua Subdivision, told Deputy 
James Freed they were looking for seashells on the beach when they found 
cinderblocks with what looked like a hand, foot and vertebrae attached by a 
white plastic zip tie. They went back to the residence where they are staying to 
get five of their friends. They brought them back to the beach to see what they 
had found. After looking at the body parts, they went to a nearby residence to 
call the Sheriffs Office.

When deputies arrived, they used crime scene tape to secure the area, then 
called for detectives and the medical examiners office. According to 
detectives, the body parts were determined to belong to animal, probably a pig.

Reminder: Go-peds are not legal to operate on roadways

 Monroe County The Sheriffs Office would like to remind 
everyone that operating motorized scooters, sometimes called Go-peds, is illegal 
on the roadways of the State of Florida. Many kids have received the vehicles 
for Christmas, and everyone needs to review what is and is not allowed regarding 
them. Go-peds are considered to be motorized vehicles. They are not, however, 
considered to be legally equipped to operate on the roadways of the State of 
Florida. Because of these two facts, there are actually three separate laws 
which apply to the operation of them.

A person must be 16 and must possess a legal drivers license to operate any 
motor vehicle on a roadway in the State of Florida. Additionally, because the 
motorized scooter-type vehicles are not considered to be street-legal, they 
are not legal for anyone to operate on a roadway in the State. Parents must also 
be aware of what their kids are doing: a parent may be cited for allowing their 
child to illegally operate such a vehicle on the roadway. And, remember, it is 
always illegal to operate any motor vehicle on a sidewalk, on the shoulder of 
the roadway or on a bicycle path. The Sheriffs Office wants to let everyone 
know that these vehicles are against the law on the roadways of the State of 
Florida. Deputies will be stopping people on Go-peds and other motorized 
scooter-type vehicles, warning them, and may issue citations for the illegal 
operation of the vehicles.

Two more lower units stolen from motors

 Tavernier A Tavernier man reported two lower 
units from his Yamaha boat motors stolen.

The victim called Thursday afternoon to report the theft, 
but said the crime could have taken place anytime since Monday. The stolen lower 
units were from two Yamaha 200 horsepower outboard engines on his boat.

Five more lower units were stolen from three boats in the 
same general vicinity. They were reported missing, stolen sometime between 
Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Detectives believe in these cases thieves 
approached the boats from the water.

14 other engines and/or lower units have been taken from 
boats in the upper Keys since June of this year. In most cases, the engines are 
being taken from marinas and boat yards, but the recent spate of thefts are from 
residential neighborhoods.

Detectives and deputies have diligently been investigating 
the boat motor thefts in the upper Keys and will continue to do so, but so far 
have not made any arrests relating to these cases. They speculate that suspects 
are transporting the motors and lower units to Miami, then shipping them out of 
the United States. The sheer numbers of boat motors available to thieves in the 
Keys, coupled with the difficulty owners have securing them, make the crime a 
tough one to solve. Detectives recommend making sure boats are parked or docked 
in well lighted areas. Alarm systems can also be helpful. There are many boat 
alarms available commercially. Most cost anywhere from $200.00 on up, but can 
detect when the boat moves, when wires are cut or when someone breaks into your 
boat.

We really need help with this investigation, said 
Detective Sgt. Corey Bryan. We need people to keep their eyes open for 
suspicious activity, both in residential neighborhoods and around marinas and 
boat yards. We need them to watch for trucks carrying boat motors or lower 
units, particularly at night. We need them to watch for suspicious activity on 
the water as well, particularly in residential canals and around marinas, he 
said.

Anyone who has information about any boat motor or lower 
unit thefts should call the Sheriffs Office immediately. Callers who wish to 
remain anonymous can contact Crime Stoppers of the Florida Keys. If a tip leads 
to an arrest, the caller would be eligible for a substantial reward of up to 
$1,000.00. The Crime Stoppers hot line number is 1-800-346-TIPS.

Lower units stolen from Tavernier boats

 Tavernier Five lower units from boat motors 
were stolen from three separate boats in a Tavernier neighborhood sometime 
between Tuesday and Wednesday.

The units were taken from three boats at two homes on 
Dubonnet Road in Tavernier. A neighbor called to report the thefts Wednesday. 
Detectives believe these lower units were taken by someone who approached the 
boats from the water.

This brings the total number of motors or lower units stolen 
in the upper Keys since June to at least 21. All the motors and lower units in 
question have been high-end Yamaha or Mercury engines, usually 200 250 horse 
power. Most of the stolen engines and lower units have been taken from Marinas 
and boat yards. Some have been taken from private homes.

Detectives and deputies have diligently been investigating 
boat motor thefts in the upper Keys and will continue to do so, but so far have 
not made any arrests relating to these cases. They speculate that suspects are 
transporting the motors and lower units to Miami, then shipping them out of the 
United States. The sheer numbers of boat motors available to thieves in the 
Keys, coupled with the difficulty owners have securing them, make the crime a 
tough one to solve. Detectives recommend making sure boats are parked or docked 
in well lighted areas. Alarm systems can also be helpful. There are many boat 
alarms available commercially. Most cost anywhere from $200.00 on up, but can 
detect when the boat moves, when wires are cut or when someone breaks into your 
boat.

We really need help with this investigation, said 
Detective Sgt. Corey Bryan. We need people to keep their eyes open for 
suspicious activity, both in residential neighborhoods and around marinas and 
boat yards. We need them to watch for trucks carrying boat motors or lower 
units, particularly at night. We need them to watch for suspicious activity on 
the water as well, particularly in residential canals and around marinas, he 
said.

Anyone who has information about any boat motor or lower 
unit thefts should call the Sheriffs Office immediately. Callers who wish to 
remain anonymous can contact Crime Stoppers of the Florida Keys. If a tip leads 
to an arrest, the caller would be eligible for a substantial reward of up to 
$1,000.00. The Crime Stoppers hot line number is 1-800-346-TIPS.

Teen charged with having gun, making threats

 Stock Island A 17 year old Stock Island teen 
was charged with threatening a woman with a handgun, and possessing marijuana.

Deputies were called to 6650 Maloney Avenue Saturday at 8 
p.m. to a neighborhood dispute. When they arrived, they found a 17 year old boy 
and a woman in an argument. When they pulled up, they saw the boy, Manuel 
Rangel, put something on the ground. Closer inspection revealed it to be a 
silver colored BB-gun which looked like a real handgun.

The deputies spoke with the victim, a neighbor of Rangel. 
She said she and Rangel had exchanged words, and that Rangel told her to stay 
out of his way or he would put a cap in her ass. He then lifted up his shirt 
and showed him the gun, which he had tucked in the waistband of his pants.

Rangel was arrested. A search of his pockets turned up a 
plastic bag of marijuana. Rangel was charged with aggravated assault with a 
firearm and possession of marijuana. He was turned over to the custody of the 
Department of Juvenile Justice.

Islamorada man arrested for burglaries, using a stolen credit card

 Islamorada An Islamorada man was arrested 
Sunday for breaking into several apartments last week. He also used a credit 
card stolen from the apartment to charge merchandise at a local business.

Deputies and detectives were able to identify the suspect 
using a surveillance tape from the business where 27 year old Michael Strobridge 
used the stolen credit card. When they confronted Strobridge at his residence, 
he admitted to using the card, admitted to stealing it from an apartment across 
the street, and admitted to two other break-ins during which he stole various 
small items. He also admitted to cashing a stolen check at an area bank.

Strobridge was arrested and charged with fraudulent use of a 
credit card, three counts of burglary and three counts of grand theft. More 
charges are pending on cashing of the check.

Missing man found

 Key Largo Detective Larry ONeill has 
located a man reported missing last month.

54 year old Michael Lee Davis was located after the 
detective talked to several acquaintances of his. One of them was able to give 
Davis location in Edgewater, Florida where he is currently visiting a friend.

When Detective ONeill contacted Davis to confirm that he is 
all right, Davis said he didnt tell anyone he was leaving the Keys because he 
didnt think anyone cared where he was.

Warning: Man is writing bad checks

 Monroe County The Sheriffs office would 
like to warn Keys businesses that a man has been writing bad checks over the 
past couple of days.

According to Detective Rick Martin, the man, who is using at 
least two different names, has a book of checks taken from a gas station in 
Cocoa Beach, Florida. He has written at least four checks at four different 
businesses totaling $2,500.00. He has tried to write checks in several others 
and has been turned down.

He goes by the names Ronald Stinson and Jeff Howard. He has 
pieces of identification with those names on them, including a Washington State 
drivers license and an expired credit card with the Stinson name and another 
identification card with the Howard name. The checks are written on the Bank of 
America, and are numbered between 1240 and 1279. He has written or attempted to 
write checks in both Marathon and Key West.

The suspect is described as a white male in his early 40s, 
six feet two or three inches tall, 230-240 pounds with reddish-blond hair. He 
has been described as having a pot-belly, and has a tattoo of the Miami 
Dolphins logo on one of his upper arms. He may be driving a dark colored jeep 
with a soft top or no top on it.

Anyone with information about this man should contact the 
Sheriffs Office immediately at 289-2430. Callers who wish to remain anonymous

Missouri man dies while diving

 Upper Keys A Missouri man died Thursday 
while diving near French Reef, on the ocean side of the upper Keys.

54 year old Thomas Peirson Prater was on a dive trip with 
his son on board the dive vessel Cheeca View, operated by Horizon Divers. 
According to witnesses, they were diving in about 45 feet of water at 10:30 a.m. 
and had been in the water approximately 45 minutes. The two men surfaced and 
gave the boats crew the O.K. signal. A mate from the boat jumped in the water 
to help them get back to the boat. When they were about 20 feet away, the mate 
noticed that Prater was in trouble. When they got him on board, he was not 
breathing, so they began CPR, called for help, and started in to shore.

By the time they reached dock at Key Largo Harbor at 10:51 
a.m., rescue personnel had arrived. They examined the victim, and pronounced him 
dead at the scene.

Praters dive equipment was taken into evidence for routine 
examination. An autopsy will be done to determine the cause of his death.

Bank branch manager arrested for stealing from customers accounts

 Key Largo The branch manager of Community 
Bank in Tavernier was arrested Wednesday evening, charged with stealing money 
from customers accounts and transferring it to her own.

23 year old Rosalie Hall of Homestead has been charged with 
grand theft. She is accused of transferring money from several customers bank 
accounts, through bank accounts belonging to members of her family and into a 
personal account held by her.

Detective Mike Wilkinson was called to the main office of 
Community Bank in Homestead Wednesday. When he arrived, he met with a 
vice-president of the bank who told him that Hall had confessed to taking the 
money from the customers accounts. Hall was there also, and she agreed to meet 
with Detective Wilkinson at his office in Plantation Key to talk to him about 
her actions.

She admitted to stealing at least $16,500.00 from three 
separate accounts. She said she picked the accounts because she knew the 
customers in question never checked the details of their accounts. She was 
caught after she made a mistake on one of the transfer slips, bringing the 
transfer to the attention of a bookkeeper at the bank, who then began examining 
all the transfers made by Hall.

The investigation is ongoing and more charges may be 
pending. She was initially charged with grand theft and was booked into the 
Monroe County Detention Center. Bond was set at $1,500.00.

Student charged with shooting BB gun at school bus

 Big Pine Key An eleven year old Big Pine Key 
boy was arrested Wednesday for shooting a BB gun at a school bus.

Eleven year old Luis Rodriguez was standing on the side of 
the road near the intersection of Avenue B and Sunset Drive with another boy 
just before 5 p.m. Tuesday. According to the bus driver, as he passed the two 
boys he saw one of them hiding something behind his back, then he heard 
something hit the side of the bus. A student riding on the bus told Deputy Tom 
Peteck, Jr. that he saw one of the boys point a BB gun at the bus and pull the 
trigger, shooting the side of the bus.

The boy was identified as Rodriguez by the driver and by 
students on the bus. He was located the following day by Deputy Peteck. He was 
charged with discharging a weapon at school property. He is currently being held 
by the Department of Juvenile Justice.

Man arrested again for credit card skimming

 Marathon A Marathon man was arrested for the 
second time in a month and was charged with skimming credit cards.

35 year old Raul Antonio Delcid was arrested by Detective 
Lionel Vargas Wednesday and charged with use of a scanning device or recorder to 
defraud. He was previously arrested in November on the same charges.

According to Detective Henry Hamilton, the investigation 
began after a fraud investigator from Citibank called Monroe County to report 
noticing a pattern of credit card fraud cases occurring in Monroe County. In 
particular, the cases pointed to the Tom Thumb store on Big Pine Key.

Detective Hamilton began to investigate, and discovered 
during his investigation that Delcid was the one allegedly responsible for the 
credit card fraud cases. With the cooperation of the store manager, Detective 
Hamilton was able to pull a video surveillance tape from July of this year 
showing Delcid using a scanning device to scan customers credit cards apart 
from the usual scanning device used by the store for purchases. The device he 
used records the magnetic strip on the cards, enabling the cards numbers to be 
used later.

When Delcid was confronted with the video tape, he confessed 
to skimming the credit cards. He said he would copy a large number of cards 
into the box, then sell the box to someone he only knew as Carlos in Miami. He 
was paid $15.00 per credit card number, making $800.00 on one occasion from 
cards skimmed at the Tom Thumb on Big Pine, and another $800.00 from cards he 
skimmed while working at the Dions Quik Mart on Summerland Key.

The card numbers he sold were 
subsequently used to defraud credit card companies out of thousands of dollars. 
Delcid was booked at that time into the Monroe County Detention Center on a 
felony count of credit card fraud. He bonded out of jail on those charges a 
short time later. Hes now been arrested a second time on the same charges. Bond 
has been set this time at $50,000.00. More charges are pending.

According to Detectives, investigations such as this one are 
complex, but because there is a clear paper trail from the person who does the 
actual skimming, people such as Delcid are relatively easy to pinpoint. He is 
still working with credit card companies on similar cases in the lower Keys, and 
with detectives from other areas of the county on similar cases throughout the 
county. The Sheriffs Office hopes to make more arrests such as this one in the 
future. The skimming of credit cards is taking place across the country and 
costs credit card companies millions of dollars every year.

Key Largo man charged with burglarizing business

 Key Largo A Key Largo man was charged 
Wednesday morning with breaking in to Pizza Hut in Key Largo and stealing their 
cash register.

Deputies Don Dalton and Jose Carballo were dispatched to 
reports of a business burglary at Pizza Hut in Key Largo just after 9 a.m., the 
glass front door to the business broken, and sandy footprints were found inside 
the business. A computer was broken, and two cash registers were missing. 
Deputies followed a trail of coins and shoe prints outside into the parking lot, 
then to a wooded area nearby. 37 year old Brian Thein was found in the wooded 
area standing over pieces of the missing cash registers. His shoes matched the 
shoe prints found in the store and parking lot.

Thein was arrested and charged with burglary, criminal 
mischief and grand theft and he was booked into the Monroe County Detention 
Center.

Keys man charged with exploitation of an elderly person

 Big Pine Key A Big Pine Key man was arrested 
Monday and charged with exploitation of an elderly person.

According to Detective John McGee, 55 year old Anthony 
Gligora was a guest in the victims home when the abuse and exploitation began. 
According to the victim, who is 84 years old, he began asking her for money. 
When she refused to give it to him, he became verbally abusive and violent. Over 
a period of six months, the victim says she gave Gligora approximately $5,000.00 
in cash and checks because she was afraid of him.

The victim finally asked Gligora to leave her house on 
December 8th. He refused, so the Sheriffs Office was called and he was removed 
from the home. He returned an hour later and he was arrested for trespass after 
warning.

He was released from jail Monday morning. Detective McGee, 
who had been investigating the case, arrested him again at 4:25 p.m. on Big Pine 
Key, charging him with exploitation of an elderly person. Gligora was booked 
back into the Monroe County Detention Center.

Sgt. Daryl Hull assisted in the investigation and arrest.

Detective charged with drunk driving

 Marathon Sheriffs deputies arrested a 
Sheriffs Office detective Saturday in the early morning hours for drunk 
driving.

A deputy on patrol at the 59.5 mile marker spotted a truck 
northbound. The truck was exceeding the speed limit and driving erratically. 
After following the truck for a period of time, and observing it swerving off 
the road several times, the deputy pulled the truck over. The driver of the 
truck was Mark Terrill, a detective with the Sheriffs Office.

Terrill was given field sobriety tests, which he was unable

Key Largo man charged with attempted murder

 Key Largo A Key Largo man was charged with 
attempting to kill his ex-wife Friday afternoon.

The victim told Deputy Sever Hustad she came home from work 
Friday at 4:45 p.m. When she walked in the door of her trailer, her ex-husband, 
51 year old James Calvin Coin, was hiding in the bedroom. He walked out carrying 
a gun. She said he pointed it at her head and told her he was going to end it 
today. He also pointed it at his own head, as if he was going to shoot himself. 
They struggled, and at one point, he discharged the gun into the ceiling. He 
also hit the victim in the mouth with the gun, and grabbed her around the throat 
at least two times.

The victim said she was yelling for help and he finally left 
the trailer. That is when she called 911 to report the incident. After the 
attack, she also discovered an expensive gold necklace missing from the trailer, 
valued at $600.00.

A short time later, Sheriffs Office dispatchers received a 
call from Coin, saying he wanted to turn himself in. He was found at a home on 
Bostwick Drive and was taken into custody without incident. He was charged with 
attempted murder, aggravated battery, violation of a protective order, burglary 
and grand theft. His bond is set at $250,000.00.

Man missing, possibly endangered

 Monroe County Sheriffs detectives say they 
need help locating a man missing since Thanksgiving.

54 year old Michael Lee Davis was last seen by his boss the 
day before the Thanksgiving holiday. Davis has reportedly worked for Hoefert and 
Sons in Key Largo for the past 25 years and has a near perfect attendance record 
during that time, according to his employer.

Davis resides on Plantation Key and his 1995 white Ford 
truck is still at his residence. As far as detectives have been able to 
tell, Davis did not tell anyone that he was leaving town and his boss and 
friends are worried about him.

Davis is five foot ten inches tall, 160 pounds with brown 
hair and brown eyes. His nickname is Redeye. Anyone with information which 
might help locate Davis should contact the Sheriffs Office at (305)292-7075.

Arrest made for Marathon HS Bomb Threat

 Marathon Sheriffs detectives arrested a 14 
year old Marathon student today (Wednesday), charging her with making a bomb 
threat at the Marathon High School Monday.

14 year old Gina Nichols-Nicholas told Detective Lionel 
Vargas she was home from school Monday and got bored. She said she wanted her 
friend to come over to visit her, so she decided to call in the bomb threat. She 
said she called the school, disguising her voice as a boys, and said You have 
a bomb at your school. The threat resulted in a detailed search of the school 
by law enforcement officers and firefighters, and an early dismissal of 
students. No explosive device or other suspicious package was found.

The following day when she arrived at school, she heard that 
school authorities and detectives could trace where the phone call came from, so 
she went to the School Administrators office and admitted that she was the one 
who made the call. The schools principal then called the Sheriffs Office and 
Detective Vargas responded.

Detective Vargas questioned the girl, and she repeated her 
admissions. A warrant was obtained for her arrest today (Wednesday). She was 
charged with making a false report of a bomb, a second degree felony. She was 
turned over to the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice.

Homestead men charged with drugs trafficking

57 year old Nebraska man dies while on dive trip

 Key Largo A 57 year old Nebraska man died 
while diving off shore of Key Largo Saturday.

According to witnesses, 57 year old Byron Gene Schultz was 
on board the Cheeca View dive boat, operated by Horizon Divers when the 
incident occurred Saturday morning just before 11 a.m. They said he surfaced 
after diving in 25-30 feet of water. He swam to the dive boat, removed his dive 
equipment and began to climb in the boat. As he was climbing up the ladder, he 
suddenly fell backwards into the water.

He was pulled from the water immediately, but was not 
breathing so people on board the boat began cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
immediately. A boat belonging to the Fish and Wildlife Commission was in the 
vicinity. Schultz was transferred to that vessel and was transported to shore. 
He was found to be dead on arrival.

His wife, who was staying at an upper Keys hotel, was 
notified of her husbands death. Detectives took his dive gear into custody for 
routine examination. An autopsy will be performed to determine the cause of his 
death.

Bahia Honda Bridge murder victim identified

 Bahia Honda Sheriffs detectives say they 
finally have confirmed the identity of the murder victim found dead on the Bahia 
Honda Bridge the morning of Monday, November 25 th .

Within a short time of finding the body, they had 
tentatively identified the victim as 28 year old James Anthony Alexander of Key 
West. It took time, however, to confirm that tentative identification. 
Detectives finally got photos and fingerprints for comparison from prison 
officials in Missouri. Alexander did prison time there for armed robbery prior 
to coming to Key West about ten months ago. His mother, who lives in Illinois, 
has been notified and has also identified the body as her sons. Alexander was 
known on the street as Nico, or sometimes as Tony.

Detectives from the Sheriffs Office Homicide division have 
been following up leads in the case since the body was discovered, shortly 
before 6 a.m. on the northbound side of the bridge, at the north end on the 
bridges shoulder. They say they believe a light colored car, some type of 
sedan, may be involved.

Alexander had been shot three times. He was wearing a yellow 
jersey-type shirt with the number 05 on it, and long black pants. He had two 
earrings in his left ear and two tattoos on his body, although detectives 
declined to be more specific about them. He was spotted by a passing motorist 
who flagged down a deputy who was working a traffic stop at the other end of the 
bridge.

Detectives say they are particularly interested in talking 
to anyone who might have seen any kind of suspicious activity on or near the 
bridge between 4 a.m. and 7 a.m. the day of the murder. They also would like to 
speak to anyone who knew Alexander and who might know what happened to him.

Anyone with information about this case should contact the 
Sheriffs Office immediately. Callers who wish to remain anonymous can call 
Crime Stoppers of the Florida Keys. Crime Stoppers is offering a $1,000.00 
reward to anyone whose information leads to an arrest in this case. The Crime 
Stoppers hot line number is 1-800-346-TIPS.

which tested positive for marijuana. The marijuana, weighing 91 grams, was 
seized as evidence. Manuel was arrested for possession of marijuana over 20 
grams and taken to the county detention center.
