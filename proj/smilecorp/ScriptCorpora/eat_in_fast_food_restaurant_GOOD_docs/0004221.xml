West Germany () is the common English name for the Federal Republic of Germany or FRG () in the period between its creation in May 1949 to German reunification on 3 October 1990. This period, during which Germany and Berlin were divided, ended when communist East Germany was dissolved and its five states joined the eleven states of the Federal Republic of Germany. The enlarged Federal Republic of Germany with sixteen states (known simply as &quot;Germany&quot;) is thus the continuation of the pre-1990 Federal Republic of Germany, and not its successor.

Author: MidNightRiderMMI School District 128 in Palos Heights has installed the new ZPass tracking system on school buses. The system allows school officials to track when and where students board and exit buses. It&apos;s the first day of school. Your child has new supplies, a new teacher and probably a new bus route. The fear of a child getting on the wrong bus, or not getting off at the right stop is very real for many parents. School District 128 in Palos Heights hopes to alleviate that anxiety through the installation of a new scanner on school buses carrying children in kindergarten through fifth grade.&quot;We can now go online and look and see if the child got off the bus and where,&quot;said Dr. Kathleen Casey, superintendent of Dist 128.&quot;We can track the students and the buses down to the minute.&quot;The system is called ZPass and is currently in place in just 26 school districts nation wide. District 128 is just the second in Illinois to utilize the technology. more palos.patch.com Tags GPS Tracking Kids Children Schools Illinois Bus Buses Tracked Big Brother Police State School District 128 Kids Inventory safety http://wn.com/GPS_Tracking_School_Children

Author: TerroristCitizen Daily News @ RevolutionNews.US ~ Northern California Preschoolers Wearing Tracking Devices. RICHMOND - California officials are outfitting preschoolers in Contra Costa County with tracking devices they say will save staff time and money. The system was introduced Tuesday. When at the school, students will wear a jersey that has a small radio frequency tag. The tag will send signals to sensors that help track children&apos;s whereabouts, attendance and even whether they&apos;ve eaten or not. School officials say it will free up teachers and administrators who previously had to note on paper files when a child was absent or had eaten. Sung Kim of the county&apos;s employment and human services department said the system could save thousands of hours of staff time and pay for itself within a year. It cost $50000 and was paid by a federal grant. http --&quot;Educate and inform the whole mass of the people...

Author: superutils www.superutils.com The storage of location based data, in the form of Latitude and Longitude inside of images is called Geotagging; essentially tagging your photograph with the geographic location. This data is stored inside if the metadata if JPEG images and is useful for tying the photograph to a location. Want to remember exactly where you took those photographs while on vacation? This information is for you. However, most modern digital cameras do not automatically add geolocation (Latitude and Longitude) metadata to pictures. The process for adding the geolocation data either requires specialized add on hardware, or post processing with software on the desktop after the pictures are taken. There is a large exception to this rule: Smartphones. With the proliferation of smart phones that contain GPS locator technology inside, the cameras in these devices are already equipped with the specialized hardware to automatically add geolocation information to the pictures at the time they are taken. Most people don&apos;t realize that the action of automatic geotagging takes place on their smart phones, either because it is enabled by default, not exposed the user as an option, or was asked and then forgotten. As a result, individuals often share too much information about their location, right down to the exact Latitude and Longitude when snapping photos with their smartpphone and posting them online.

Author: traynickel &quot;REAL MONEY&quot;T-SHIRTS @ executees.net Palos Heights officials assigned the ID tags to 400 students in preschool through 5th grade. Teachers clipped a card -- plain but for a smiley-face sticker -- to each student&apos;s book bag. The southwest suburban district rolled out the new system this week, becoming the second school district in the state to use technology not only to track school buses, but also the students who ride them, officials said. It is the newest technological advance in the effort to ease parents&apos;nerves and keep students safe. Today&apos;s parents, torn between wanting to give their kids more independence while also keeping them from harm, can now send them off knowing they can call the school to make sure their child arrived or to check if the child is late returning from school. About 5 percent of the 490000 school buses that transport kids across the country are believed to use the student tracking technology, according to the National Association for Pupil Transportation http://wn.com/ILLINOIS_SCHOOL_TRACKING_STUDENTS_WITH_GPS_9-1-2010

She examined the car after she saw officers gathered around her car, apparently trying to get the device back. Sheriff admits they wanted to track Stacy, if she fled with her son. UPDATE March 22, 2012 from Stacy: I have been waiting for judge field to rule on the 59/62 motions for the past 60 days. The 59 was a motion for a new trial. The 62 was a motion for stay of the transfer of custody and fees. The judge denied the motions. This means that we have to go to an appeal and that will take more than a year. Additionally, I have been threatened with 120 days in jail because the judge did not rule on the 59/62 for 60 days and there is a contempt motion filed for the $14000 attorney fees because the judge did not rule for so long. Jaden is losing more muscle tone. He is skin on bones now. He says that sometimes he does not eat. He wants to talk to me on the phone but is being prevented from doing that. DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT I DID WRONG THAT GAVE THE JUDGE THE RIGHT TO SEVER JADEN FROM HIS LIFE? DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT I DID WRONG THAT GAVE THE SHERIFF THE RIGHT TO ARREST ME? THE ANSWER IS THAT I DID NOTHING WRONG. NOTHING. THEY STOLE MY SON. THEY ARE ABUSING ME AND JADEN. I am praying for an elected official to step forward who will help us.

Trackn uses a simple GPS device which is fitted to the child, similar to a small wristwatch. Whole classes or groups can wear devices ensuring safety on school trips, visits to the park or even outward bound courses where older children have more freedom.

The system allows school officials to track when and where students board and exit buses. It&apos;s the first day of school. Your child has new supplies, a new teacher and probably a new bus route. The fear of a child getting on the wrong bus, or not getting off at the right stop is very real for many parents. School District 128 in Palos Heights hopes to alleviate that anxiety through the installation of a new scanner on school buses carrying children in kindergarten through fifth grade.&quot;We can now go online and look and see if the child got off the bus and where,&quot;said Dr. Kathleen Casey, superintendent of Dist 128.&quot;We can track the students and the buses down to the minute.&quot;The system is called ZPass and is currently in place in just 26 school districts nation wide. District 128 is just the second in Illinois to utilize the technology. more palos.patch.com Tags GPS Tracking Kids Children Schools Illinois Bus Buses Tracked Big Brother Police State School District 128 Kids Inventory safety 3:07 School Using GPS Device to Track Children Daily News @ RevolutionNews.US ~ Northern California Preschoolers Wearing Tracking Devices... published: 21 Aug 2010 author: TerroristCitizen School Using GPS Device to Track Children Daily News @ RevolutionNews.US ~ Northern California Preschoolers Wearing Tracking Devices. RICHMOND - California officials are outfitting preschoolers in Contra Costa County with tracking devices they say will save staff time and money. The system was introduced Tuesday. When at the school, students will wear a jersey that has a small radio frequency tag. The tag will send signals to sensors that help track children&apos;s whereabouts, attendance and even whether they&apos;ve eaten or not. School officials say it will free up teachers and administrators who previously had to note on paper files when a child was absent or had eaten. Sung Kim of the county&apos;s employment and human services department said the system could save thousands of hours of staff time and pay for itself within a year. It cost $50000 and was paid by a federal grant. http --&quot;Educate and inform the whole mass of the people...

This data is stored inside if the metadata if JPEG images and is useful for tying the photograph to a location. Want to remember exactly where you took those photographs while on vacation? This information is for you. However, most modern digital cameras do not automatically add geolocation (Latitude and Longitude) metadata to pictures. The process for adding the geolocation data either requires specialized add on hardware, or post processing with software on the desktop after the pictures are taken. There is a large exception to this rule: Smartphones. With the proliferation of smart phones that contain GPS locator technology inside, the cameras in these devices are already equipped with the specialized hardware to automatically add geolocation information to the pictures at the time they are taken. Most people don&apos;t realize that the action of automatic geotagging takes place on their smart phones, either because it is enabled by default, not exposed the user as an option, or was asked and then forgotten. As a result, individuals often share too much information about their location, right down to the exact Latitude and Longitude when snapping photos with their smartpphone and posting them online. To delete geotags from JPEG photos, just apply the batch Windows utility&lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt; 1:17 Wholesale Security GPS Tracker With SMS Message From China Make sure you know your family is safe.

Teachers clipped a card -- plain but for a smiley-face sticker -- to each student&apos;s book bag. The southwest suburban district rolled out the new system this week, becoming the second school district in the state to use technology not only to track school buses, but also the students who ride them, officials said. It is the newest technological advance in the effort to ease parents&apos;nerves and keep students safe. Today&apos;s parents, torn between wanting to give their kids more independence while also keeping them from harm, can now send them off knowing they can call the school to make sure their child arrived or to check if the child is late returning from school. About 5 percent of the 490000 school buses that transport kids across the country are believed to use the student tracking technology, according to the National Association for Pupil Transportation 4:17 Who&apos;s Watching The Children?

She examined the car after she saw officers gathered around her car, apparently trying to get the device back. Sheriff admits they wanted to track Stacy, if she fled with her son. UPDATE March 22, 2012 from Stacy: I have been waiting for judge field to rule on the 59/62 motions for the past 60 days. The 59 was a motion for a new trial. The 62 was a motion for stay of the transfer of custody and fees. The judge denied the motions. This means that we have to go to an appeal and that will take more than a year. Additionally, I have been threatened with 120 days in jail because the judge did not rule on the 59/62 for 60 days and there is a contempt motion filed for the $14000 attorney fees because the judge did not rule for so long. Jaden is losing more muscle tone. He is skin on bones now. He says that sometimes he does not eat. He wants to talk to me on the phone but is being prevented from doing that. DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT I DID WRONG THAT GAVE THE JUDGE THE RIGHT TO SEVER JADEN FROM HIS LIFE? DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT I DID WRONG THAT GAVE THE SHERIFF THE RIGHT TO ARREST ME? THE ANSWER IS THAT I DID NOTHING WRONG. NOTHING. THEY STOLE MY SON. THEY ARE ABUSING ME AND JADEN. I am praying for an elected official to step forward who will help us.

Alert notifications can contain information about the location of the user and might be sent to a mobile telephone or an email account. Geofencing is ideal for notifying parents when a child arrives or leaves a designated area. Losing a child in a busy shopping centre is every parents worst nightmare. Now Trackn have developed a system where a child or even multiple children can be traced instantly by GPS and can be monitored by a virtual electronic fence so that the parent or guardian is informed immediately if the child strays outside a designated area. Trackn uses a simple GPS device which is fitted to the child, similar to a small wristwatch. Whole classes or groups can wear devices ensuring safety on school trips, visits to the park or even outward bound courses where older children have more freedom. Trackn has introduced a revolutionary step forward in the welfare and security of pets, animals and livestock.
