It has been an interesting week trying to balance my calories/protein. So far so good though. Going to Five Guys for a little bacon cheeseburger with mustard instead of mayo, a half order of cajun fries, and a diet soda in a little bit. MMmmmm. Dinner is probably going to be a couple of pork loin chops and some veggies. 04/2010 - 295 Fattest

Chinese food sounds delicious! Thanks! Lol Their regular nutrition is way healthier than the average in western civilization. Plus most of them just eat less. Often that&apos;s due to the food being very hot - just makes you feel full way earlier. 04-15-2011, 02:50 PM #40 jamesyboi

What is shaping? Is it the same as toning? Our bodies either gain muscle or lose muscle. they either gain fat or lose fat. There is no such thing as shaping or toning. 04-15-2011, 03:30 PM #44 BladeJrs

Look on McDonald&apos;s website; they list all of the nutritional info for every item on their menu. Browse around what they have to offer, and look at the calories in each item you may want to eat. Since it shows you the calories, just pick something thats amongst the lowest. - Food is my enemy; I&apos;d rather die than to be fat.

I was trying to say you should become ripped without pissing everybody off by making them feel bad about their own food choices. Really, some people are perfectly fine with eating lots of bs and if you&apos;re friends with them, you sometimes have to take one for the team (ofc this shouldn&apos;t be a routine).

Being the-guy-that-never-eats isn&apos;t going to make anything easier , so make the healthiest choice you can and go with it. There&apos;s ways to make it less obvious. Especially in a fast food restaurant. No one really has to hear you announcing your healthy choice, probably with no sauce or whatever as they would at a sit down restaurant. There are times I go out 3 days a week to dinner with friends. I can&apos;t just not eat with cutting in mind every time for their sake. They for the most part understand my lifestyle, and as I said I try not to draw attention to it and deflect anything about it.

Them-&quot;What?! Why are you getting grilled chicken when they have a triple bacon burger with fries and a free dessert?!&quot;

Me-&quot;Eh, I don&apos;t feel too great I don&apos;t want something too heavy.&quot;

No one is telling you to say,&quot;because I eat healthy and you&apos;re a bad person for not doing so.&quot;

And not to sound cliche or be&quot;that guy&quot;, but if eating healthy while your friends eat bad is becoming that much of a strain on your friendship, you need some new friends. My friends may joke about it once in a while, but again, just deflect it and move on to other friend like topics. 275-&gt;180-&gt;225... Next stop, 150
