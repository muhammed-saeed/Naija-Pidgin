		CREATIVE KIDS STUDIO 
 
 
 Creativity is an attitude and an approach to life,
 not a product. Creative thinkers know there are many&quot;right answers&quot;to a
 question and many ways to solve a problem. They are the kinds of people that can work
 around obstacles and&quot;make lemons into lemonade&quot;. Creative thinking is a LIFE
 SKILL that children will really need when thay are adults. It is more than just
 having music or art in your home that makes your children creative. It is the things you
 DO with them that count. 

 In this section you will find
 creative projects, tips and information on creativity in children.
 Most of these recipes and childrens&apos; craft ideas come from pamphlets available by Evelyn
 Petersen - See Brochures on the Books&amp;More page. Feel free to email Ev with your own ideas. 

 Encouraging the creativity in your
 child: 
Parents who make every little decision for their children are not allowing
 them to experience one of the first steps in develping the creative process - recognizing
 and making choices. Let your child make choices everyday that are appropriate such as
 breakfast foods to choose from, which table to choose at a fast food restaurant, which
 bedtime story..... 

Rather than jump in to solve a problem for your children,
 ASK THEM first what seems to be the problem or what is going wrong. See if they can come
 up with more than one (reasonable) solution and try them ALL out. Decide which is the best
 and describe WHY. This will reinforce their confidence in decision making and divergent
 thinking skills.

Give complete attention to children when they talk to you
 about their ideas and opinions. If you are busy make sure they know you will be taking the
 time to listen as soon as you can. Try not to interrupt or mention&quot;right&quot;or&quot;wrong&quot;ideas and keep the conversation open ended. If children believe you
 value their ideas (more importantly their ability to form ideas, opinions and make
 informed choices), the more they will exercise creative thinking.

When doing artwork, don&apos;t provide children with&quot;models&quot;to copy from

Children do not have to stay inside the lines when coloring
 or paint with the designated colors in painting by number.

Frame or hang up childrens&apos; creations and writing samples.

 The Creative Process: 
 Have you ever looked at your child&apos;s crayola drawing or painting and said,&quot;Oh no,
 all he does is scribble!&quot;Or,&quot;All she does is cover the entire paper with
 paint!&quot;...don&apos;t despair! Your child is creating spontaneously and naturally, and
 engaged in a perfectly normal developmental process. All children proceed through natural
 developmental stages as they use art media. This developmental sequence is most easily
 seen when children use crayons or paint. So if your child is&quot;scribbling&quot;or
 covering paper with paint, REJOICE! This is how ALL children develop skill in the use of
 art media. Your child is simply proceeding naturally through the steps of the
 developmental sequence...its&apos; the PROCESS that is important, not the PRODUCT.
 Encourage and praise your child as you enjoy each of these steps or stages: 
 
 Drawing Sequence 
 &quot;Scribble drawings&quot;Child experiments with use of color to
 scribble or cover entire paper. White space combined with lines creating designs are seen. Some lines are drawn with purpose; spaces are enclosed and color
 palcement is more purposeful Shapes are discernible as well as lines with varied direction Shapes and lines are often put together and the creation or object is
 named, usually after completion. Child attempts to make letters, and plans ways to put shapes together to
 represent something he/she has in mind. What adults recognize as&quot;pictures&quot;appear, and children often
 attempt to print their names. 
 Painting Sequence 
 Child experiments with paint and usually covers the entire paper, mixing
 up all the colors. Child starts to separate the colors of paint and tries different ways of
 using the paintbrush. Child leaves some white space as well as separating colors Child&apos;s earlier experiments lead to creation of shapes with the colors of
 paint and white space; child begins to make enclosed shapes Child begins to plan ways to fit shapes together to make designs. Child begins to put shapes and colors and spaces together to create
 represented objects, often naming them after completion Child begins to plan his/her designs, and plans the ways his/her ideas
 will be represented with paint. 
 
 
 Creative Projects: 

 Home made play dough is a great way to keep children of any age busy and occupied. It nurtures creativity and develops small muscle strength and skills. It strengthens the fingers and eye hand coordination. But using play dough teaches many other things as well.

If you talk about what children are doing with the play dough as they use it, it is also a way to improve language and vocabulary. (push, pound, twist, stretch, pull, press, roll, pinch, etc.)

If you print these words on paper, it helps children see that what we say can be written and read, which helps them learn literacy. If you let them help you make the play dough, they learn about math when they count and measure. They also learn the science of how things can change when heated or combined.

They also learn about rules for using materials they like when you have them play ONLY with the play dough at the table; you can even use a place mat or on a cookie sheet to define the space.

Why is it WAY better than store bought? Store bought play dough contains dyes and chemicals that can stain fabric or carpet or stick to the floor. Home made play dough contains only flour, salt, water and a little food color and alum (for a preservative) If there are any spills, it will dry and vacumn right up or wipe off. Home made play dough does not have to be refrigerated; just put it away in a tightly sealed baggie. It takes only a few minutes to make. (Really!). And best of all , it’s CHEAP!

Here is my recipe:

In a large bowl, measure out 1 cup of flour. Set aside.
Heat¾c. water and¼c. salt in a small pot on medium low heat.
(You will also need a Tablespoon, cooking oil, alum powder, and food coloring.) Be ready; the next steps will happen very quickly.

Stir the water to dissolve the salt. Add 1T. of any cooking oil and a few drops of food color. When the water starts to simmer, add 1T. of alum. Then pour the hot liquid into the bowl of flour and mix. As it cools a little, take pieces of the dough out and knead them until completely smooth. EVERYONE loves play dough, from tots to teens to elders.

 Tip for
 Parents 
 Its ok to say&quot;I don&apos;t
 know&quot; 
Giving children the answers every time they ask a question
 cuts off avenues of curiosity and exploration. Allow yourself and
 your child to fully experience not knowing the answer; instead, love the
 question. Say&quot;I don&apos;t know, so let&apos;s try to find out.&quot;Then use the resources of the library or your PC and the internet to
 really enjoy the treasure hunt of searching for the answer. Children
 should understand that it&apos;s okay not to know all the answers, and that
 search and discovery on the Net with you is a great way to learn. 
 Tip for
 Teachers 
 3D Junk Sculpture 
 A good problem solving activity that is also an&quot;art&quot;experience
 is making&quot;3D junk creations&quot;. Collect some good junk, like small plastic cups
 and lids, paper and cardboard tubes, golf tees, spools, pipe cleaners, drink decorations,
 plastic packaging, twisties, small paper plates...just about anything in your junk drawer.
 Let children use a strong plastic tray or plate as a base. Then they can use masking tape
 to attach junk and build up and outward with it from the base. It will take on a life of
 its own and look something like a Dr. Seuss illustration. After a suitable time to admire
 the creation, just take it apart and keep the junk collage items in a bag for another day.
