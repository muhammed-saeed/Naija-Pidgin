 The Carteret News Times Help Wanted ads… 
 January 31, 2008 
I always enjoy reading the Carteret News Times.  Apart from all of the typos i usually find it is the Classifieds I tend to chuckle at mostly.  There are the usual“Carpenter”and“Electrician”jobs you see in almost every print of this paper…and then there’s the mystery jobs.  You know…the ones that say“Someone needed for something blah blah please send resume to this carteret times po box”.  Honestly….who in the hell would apply for this.  One…you don’t know what your applying for…all you know you could be applying for some fast food restaurant. Two…you will have absolutely no way to follow up…most people like to follow up or keep tabs on the places they’ve applied for work…I know I do…and pretty much 100% of the people I know do so get a clue.  Last, but not least, it just seems kind of shady….You’re going to have to go into this job knowing your boss went an extra mile to make sure that you didn’t know who you were applying to…seems rather conspicuous to me.

So…take a hint people and include the name of your bloody company when you submit a help wanted ad.  Let your potential employees know who they could be working for…and you just might get an increase in applicants.

 A more uplifting post…Hoop Pole Creek Nature Trail in Atlantic Beach 
 January 28, 2008 
Wanted to chime in today with a more positive post than my last and recommend a nice area for walking in Atlantic Beach to visit. It is the Hoop Pole Creek Nature Trail (the trail in the Food Lion/movie theater plaza, by Dominos). During the summer I really enjoy stopping by this place often. Gives me a chance to clear my head…spend some time with my wife…take the dogs for a nice outdoorsy walk…and really take in some clean fresh air. Below are some of the sights you can see on this trail. So if you’re looking to escape the bustling life of carteret county for a while…definitely check this place out!

 The Sports Center and Railroad Tracks 
 January 27, 2008 
On my way to the gym this evening it occurred to me how incredibly annoying the railroad tracks are in Morehead City (and for that matter, some of the roads). Every time I drive over one I feel like I’m going to lose a wheel or break something inside of my car. I’m not sure if that’s the way it is supposed to become over time…or is it something that could be easily solved with a little pavement? Any way you look at it, it surely can’t be good for the car or your tires…especially if you drive over them multiple times a day.

 
 The tracks at 35th and Arendell…I cringe every time I drive over them. 
So I get to the gym and of course it is packed, but I manage to get a great 40 minute cardio workout anyway…just had to wait 10 minutes for a machine to use. I really want to praise this gym. Their equipment is nice/new, the atmosphere is great, and the staff is usually very friendly(A lady says“Have a good night”as I’m out the door every night). oh…you also don’t have to lock yourself into a contract here like the other gym in morehead…gold’s (this will be another post in and of itself…). It is quite affordable. I think I pay some $55 a month for myself and another which is great I think.

My only gripe with the place is the overcrowding. I’m sure at one point in time the parking lot and the amount of equipment inside could support their membership but it seems to really be peaking…at least from my point of view. If you hit this place right after work (around 4:30/5:30 it’s completely slammed)…you’ll be lucky to get a parking spot anywhere near the entrance (but hey its a gym right…the walk will help a little….right?). Once inside pretty much every cardio machine is full…the good ones anyway….so you’ll have to go get on one of the weird ones that make you feel like a robot when you’re using it until a newer one opens up. (my avg. wait time has been 10/15 minutes…not too bad..but not great). My advice…get rid of some of the old machines and bring in the new ones…how can you tell which ones people like? Just take a look at the ones that are always full…the ones that aren’t might give you an idea of what to boot.
 
Enough ragging on this place…it really is ok in my book…it’s always been Morehead’s nice local gym (only gym until Gold’s came I think)…so I say if you’re looking to get a bit more fit…or change your lifestyle for the better a little…grab a membership here…try it out for a few months. Just try and find those sweet time windows when it’s nice and calm there so you won’t have to waste too much time.

 Life in Cartert County! 
 January 27, 2008 
Welcome to this blog about Carteret County. Not quite sure what the bounderies of this blog is going to be, but I’m thinking it will be used as an output of my feelings/experiences/and interactions as I continue life here in the labled“Crystal Coast”of North Carolina.

There are lots of things I could talk about…local business…Events..figure heads…areas of interest…and I plan on doing so in time. This is mainly put up as a journal of my exploits here but will be public just in case anyone is interested in reading it.
