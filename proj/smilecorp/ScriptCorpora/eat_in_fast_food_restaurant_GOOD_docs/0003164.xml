Comeback Sauce
 August 17, 2011 by Jackie Garvin 
 
 
 
Comeback Sauce. It goes with EVERYTHING.....except Cheerios.
 
 

Ask anyone from Mississippi if they know about Comeback Sauce and they will look at you shocked for even asking the question.  Of course, everyone in Mississippi knows about Comeback Sauce.  Even if you’ve never heard the name, you probably know it, too.   The sauce that’s served by the steak house chain made famous by the onions that bloom, is reminiscent of Comeback Sauce.  Chances are you’ve had it on a burger or sandwich at a new age sandwich shop.  It’s a versatile sauce that also makes a great salad dressing.   The origins are debated, but most attribute the sauce to a Greek immigrant who settled in Mississippi after WWII.

Most recipes agree on the proportions of mayonnaise to ketchup to chili sauce and heavy on the black pepper.  After that, the amounts of all the other ingredients are up for grabs.
 
Del Monte Chili Sauce. Look for it on your condiment aisle.
 
Chili Sauce is a condiment that is  usually found on the same aisle as ketchup, mayo and mustard.   Look for it on the top shelve.  The bottle  contains 12 ounces.  I’ve always preferred Heinz, but,  my store  was recently out of Heinz and I bought Del Monte which I’ve found is just as good.   It’s always nice to have an option.   Chili Sauce and chili pepper are not the same.

I formulated this recipe to give it as much shelf life as possible.  Since I opted for garlic powder and onion powder over fresh garlic and onion, the sauce will keep in your refrigerator for as long as you would keep mayonnaise and ketchup. But, don’t worry.   It will be eaten long before you have to worry about it spoiling.

It’s uses are many.  It’s a dip for vegetables and chips, a salad dressing, a sauce for seafood or a sandwich spread.  I will be serving mine tonight with Salmon Patties.  It is good on EVERYTHING, except Cheerios.

Here’s my version that makes a pint jar full.

1 cup Duke’s mayonnaise (one of my Favorites )

1/4  cup Heinz ketchup

1/4 cup chili sauce  ( I prefer Heinz or DelMonte.  DO NOT substitute Thai Chili Sauce)

1 heaping teaspoon Dijon mustard

1 teaspoon onion powder

1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce

1 teaspoon ground black pepper

1/4 teaspoon Tabasco sauce

1/4 cup light olive oil

juice of one lemon

Mix all ingredients well and store in refrigerator overnight.  It needs to sit to let the flavors become“acquainted”.   They shouldn’t rush into marriage.

Oh, SO very glad you shared this! I’ve never heard of“Comeback Sauce,”but that’s ok–I’ll be mixing some up this week! Your recipes are rather special…: )

Emma Ann,

Once you make this sauce, you will always want to keep some in your fridge. I didn’t grow up knowing about Comeback Sauce, either. You would think something so popular in Mississippi would make it’s way to South Alabama. At any rate, I’m sure glad that I finally crossed paths with it. Thanks for reading, Emma Ann!

I just made this dressing and of course i had to taste it, OH my goodness!!!!! If letting it sit makes it better I wont be able to stand it!!!! I will just take a spoon and eat it. I made it with Dukes!!!!!
My Frig will never be with out this Dressing!!! Thank you so much for sharing. I did leave out the Black Pepper because Hubby can eat it, but every thing else is as written.

OMG…..Dukes mayo for 75 cents……..I’d drive half a day for that. There’s nothing else like it. Hellman’s would be my next choice but still, there’s no comparison. And yes, we do love comeback sauce in Mississippi. It is good on anything!

I think the sauce at the steak house may have a tad bit of horseradish added. However, this sauce is good just like it is with fried onions. Take it out for a“taste”drive and let me know what you think. It goes with EVERYTHING…..except Cheerios. Thanks for stopping by! Please visit again!

Hi Kari!

Welcome to Syrup and Biscuits. I reformulated this sauce to have a loooooonnng shelve life. Some recipes call for fresh minced onion and garlic. I substituted onion powder and garlic powder. The primary ingredients are mayo, ketchup and chili sauce. So, this will keep as long as you would ordinarily keep those products in your fridge. However, this will not last long. I can promise you that. It goes with EVERYTHING……except Cheerios!&lt;3

Comeback Sauce is similar to Alabama White BBQ Sauce. It does have ketchup and chili sauce, though. However, it could be easily modified to create White BBQ Sauce. I need to do a post on Alabama White BBQ Sauce. Thanks for the inspiration!

This sauce is crazy good. I think the steakhouse’s sauce may have a touch of horseradish in it but i’m not sure . At any rate, this sauce is good enough to stand up to any fried onion just like it is. I do use Grey Poupon but, honestly, with the small amount in this recipe I would say to use what you have.

I too found you thru Pinterest. I’ve never heard of this sauce but one day years ago in the salon I work in a lady came in that used to own a restaurant in town. My client asked her if she had any of her special sauce made up that she wanted to buy some. The lady came back a few days later with some kind of concoction in a mason jar. I asked my client what it was and she said she didn’t know but that it was the most delicious sauce ever and it was good on anything. I have a feeling this may be her“secret”sauce. I can’t wait to try it.
Love your blog!

As a Mississippi girl I think you’ve done a fine representation of our Comeback sauce Jackie. In fact, it’s very much like my own recipe! There are recipes around that think a simple mixture of mayo, ketchup and tons of black pepper qualify, but as I see you have discovered, there’s a bit more to the sauce than that.
 Reply 
 Jackie Garvin permalink September 5, 2011 8:11 pm 
Mary,

Thank you so kindly! I looked at about 12 or 15 different recipes and they were all over the board with the exception of the mayo:ketchup:chili sauce ratios that seemed to be fairly consistent. Several recipes used fresh onion and garlic. I keep onion powder and garlic powder in my spice cabinet and use them in condiments when I want to extend the shelf life. Obviously, the powder will last longer than fresh. Most of the recipes called for cayenne pepper but I used Tabasco instead because the flavor is milder and my grandchildren love to eat this sauce. They can’t tolerate a lot of spiciness. Some of the recipes used anchovy paste. I think Worcestershire Sauce has enough flavor to compensate for anchovy paste. The addition of horseradish makes it taste a little closer to the steakhouse onion sauce but that’s getting too spicy for little ones. We love this sauce. I keep a jar in my fridge at all times.

I would use whatever mustard you can find. Don’t omit it because it lends some acidity that would be missing. Try to find some spicy brown. If you can’t find that, use yellow. Please let me know how it turns out for you.

I haven’t made this yet, but looking at the recipe (and the amount it calls for) I would probably stay away from the Sriracha in this recipe, as it is much much spicier than the Heinz chili sauce! If I’m thinking of the right two sauces, you could eat a teaspoonful of Heinz chili sauce right off the spoon, but if you tried to do that with Sriracha, it would burn your face off! In a smaller amount it would probably work, though.

Jackie–Sounds so good. I saw you ask about where to buy Comeback Sauce. Google“Thames Comeback Sauce”. They are out of Oxford, Mississippi and make the best Comeback Sauce ever! You can also order it from The Mississippi Gift Company’s website. Lots of interesting items at The Mississippi Gift Company!

Substitute an equal amount of ketchup and add a pinch more (about an 1/8th of a teaspoon) of garlic powder and onion powder. You might want to add a pinch of chili powder, too.

I formulated this recipe to give it a long shelf life. Some recipes use fresh garlic and onions but I decided to use garlic powder and onion powder for the staying power. The main ingredients are mayo, ketchup and chili sauce. I’ve never seen any one of those go bad. So, the Comeback Sauce should last a long time in your refrigerator.

Enjoy!

I was really excited to make this, but I was SO disappointed! I’m not sure where I went wrong, but is it supposed to taste so fishy? I’m not a huge seafood fan, and my sauce tastes really really fishy. I keep trying to use a little bit on different things that I have eaten throughout the week, but I just cannot stand it. I’m sad that I’m going to have to throw it all away, and it’s a waste of all the ingredients that I went out and bought specifically for this recipe. Even my boyfriend, who loves seafood, thinks it tastes like fish. What did I do wrong? and is there anything I can add to fix it?
 Reply 
 Jackie Garvin permalink * November 20, 2011 6:54 pm 
Jess,

If you used Thai Chili Sauce instead of regular chili sauce, that would account for the fishy taste. Thai Chili Sauce contains fish sauce and sometimes shrimp paste. That’s the only thing I can imagine that would make it taste fishy. None of the standard ingredients contain any fish or seafood products.

Comeback sauce is very popular in Mississippi and probably originated in the Jackson area where there is a good number of Greek imigrants from years ago. Restaurants always have it on their tables to eat with crackers as well as other things too. There are numerous restaurants, chefs, and just good cooks who bottle and sell it from one end of the state to the other. There are also many recipes for it, some using fresh onion and garlic and some of them use catsup instead of chili sauce, but it’s all good! It is very similar to a homemade Thousand Island dressing, but better.

I ran across you on a FB post by The Pioneer Woman. Glad I found you!

Sweet chili sauce doesn’t have much of a zing at all. My two year grandchildren love Comeback Sauce made using my recipe. Your little one will probably love it, too! Look for Heinz Chili Sauce. It’s usually in the same section as ketchup on the top shelf and comes in bottles smaller than ketchup.

I developed this recipe to have as long a shelf live as possible. It will last as long as you would normally keep the principle ingredients which are mayonnaise and ketcup. If you make it up one batch at the time, you won’t have to worry about it going bad. It will disappear before you turn around good.

I substituted this sauce for mayo/salad dressing to make tuna fish for sandwiches and it was fantastic. All I added to the can of Albacore tuna was 2-hardboiled eggs, a little sweet relish to taste and the comeback sauce. I also used the comeback sauce on my wheat bread intead of mayo/salad dressing. Comeback Tuna (my new name for my tunafish..hehehe) , tomatoes and lettuce…it was outstanding!!!

I did a poll on Facebook to my fellow (South) Mississippians and the only one that had heard of it now lives in Jackson. So…It’s a North MS thing. I grew up in Poplarville which is an hour from Hattiesburg and New Orleans. South MS is like a different country compared to North MS. We’re influenced more by New Orleans and the Coast and the culture is a whole lot different. I had heard of Remoulade, but not Comeback sauce. Interesting though, and it does sound tasty. I have to admit I’ve never had Duke’s either, we grew up on Blue Plate!

Comeback Sauce rocks, Duke’s mayo rocks, and YOU rock, dear Jackie! I’ve been eating Comeback Sauce ever since I was a young child (LONG time ago!) when my grandparents took me to lunch at the Mayflower Cafe in Jackson MS where they serve it as salad dressing. Couldn’t get enough of it then, and can’t get enough of it now. I’m very cautious to make a batch only when I know there will be plenty of folks around 
Jackie, chances are you’re already aware of this, but just in case…Martha Hall Foose provides the history of Comeback Sauce in one of my favorite cookbooks–‘Screen Doors and Sweet Tea’. You’re absolutely correct about the Greek connection.

I had never heard of Comeback Sauce until within the last year….the local Jack’s Hamburger fast-food restaurant close to my house offers Comeback Sauce as one of their sauce options with the chicken tenders.

More info on the origin…There was a famous restaurant in Dallas called Brockles (Greek family) and they had this dressing and it was sold in grocery stores back then. We kept it cold and spread it on saltines for a quick snack. You can probably do a search online under Brockles Dressing and see how close yours is to theirs. I knew the moment I saw the picture on Pinterest what it was!!

I saw this on pinterest and put it with my collection of recipes to try. Think I’ll try it really soon, sounds like it might be yummy with sweet potatoe fries as well as all the other suggestions I’ve been reading. I’ve been having a craving for those anyways and now an even better reason to bake some up! Can’t wait ) My husband and I always make up a dish of our own sauce using mayo and ketchup/bbq sauce for a base- he adds chipotle spice and I add a curry blend. Both are yummy, but definately giving this one a whirl! Judging by the title Syrup and Biscuits I want to look around a wee bit more!

I have been making my own version of this for years and for some reason have never thought to make a jar full. Dumb me. I don’t use pepper since I can’t eat it either. I use some horseradish sauce and hot sauce in place of the tabasco sauce. A cooler version for us light weights that can’t handle much heat.

“It’s uses are many. It’s a dip for vegetables and chips, a salad dressing, a sauce for seafood or a sandwich spread. I will be serving mine tonight with Salmon Patties. It is good on EVERYTHING, except Cheerios.”

I haven’t cooked with it yet but used it as a dipping sauce after the food is prepared. You could also use it as an addition to mayonnaise based salads such as chicken, ham and shrimp. The next time I make meatloaf, I’m going to add it in place of ketchup to the meat mixture. I think it will add a special flavor to the meatloaf. I don’t see a problem with the sauce breaking during the cooking process.

Please let me know if you need some more information. 

Enjoy!

Needed a sauce for wrap sandwiches made with a tortilla one day this week and thought of comeback sauce but didn’t have any chili sauce. I pondered what to use in its place and saw that I had some Ortega Original Thick and Smooth Taco sauce (mild but spicier would be great, too) so I used that. WOW is it good. This was great on our sandwiches but would be especially good on a taco salad or even as a dip. This was very similar to some of the ranch style spicy dressings. This turned comeback sauce into a fiesta!

Love your site! I’m from central Louisiana, and our favorite quick sauce is a simple remoulade with ketchup, mayo and Tony Chachere’s seasoning. I have seen recipes for comeback sauce before but yours sounds the best. The complexity of flavors is what I’m looking forward to most.

My daughter is so addicted to our remoulade that she has actually mixed ketchup and ranch dressing at school for a dip. Her friends made fun of her—until they tasted it! I’m willing to bet she will love having a jar of comeback sauce in the fridge at all times. Guess I need to go buy some new mason jar lids…

Oh, and even though I’m from LA, I live in Georgia. I was introduced to Duke’s mayo years ago by a Georgia native. He said when he was growing up, he thought the white condiment’s only name was Duke’s—not Duke’s mayonnaise. Just Duke’s.

I’d switch ketchup from Heinz to organic–(no High Fructose Corn Syrup that way). Same goes for Worcestershire sauce and check back labels on dijon and chili sauce…I always turn around the product and read the labels now. Thanks for the recipe, and the southern cultural/cuisine knowledge! ~Cheers

This sauce sounds awesome.. I’m thinking of trying it in a beef pasta dish for dinner…Anyone tried it like that?

Christina,

I haven’t tried it with beef pasta in particular, but it goes well with beef.

I found this on Pinterest and it will stay in my fridge from now on! (only change I made was use low fat mayo as we are on diets in this house–but it is still great!!) I saw that there is nothing similar on allrecipes.com. You should post it on there ASAP!
Closest they have is a Russian Salad dressing with 41 reviews so I know that you would knock them out the park

I am from Jackson Mississippi and I grew up eating comeback on everything! Mayflower, The Elite, Bills Greek Tavern, and probably just about every good Restaurant in and around Jackson have their own version. My favorite childhood memory is waiting for my food at the elite and eating their unbelievable rolls with comeback that was in a squirt bottle on the table. I made this recipe today and am very pleased with the results. Now I can have it at my whim to put on my bread, salads, crackers, seafood, burgers….well just about everything Thanks so much for this great recipe!

Could you use Miracle Whip? I have that in the fridge which we hardly use as it is…and Mayo we would use even less.

Chuck,

If Miracle Whip is a flavor that you’re accustomed to, then by all means, use it. It’s all about your individual taste preference.

I searched EVERY food store in my area and NO Duke’s. Was in my local Dollar tree yesterday and was browsing food section and guess what was on shelf???? Yes—DUKE’s. Grabbed several jars and rushed home to make sauce. Can’t wait till it is ready. Thanks. I was raised in Mississippi.

OMG! I didn’t know what it was called. I have been looking for this recipe for a long time. Chili’s and Applebee’s stopped serving it. For the last couple years I have tried unsuccessfully to recreate it.
THANK YOU!

Does anyone know of a”family”recipe for doctored mayonnaise? Was given a jar as a gift but
was denied recipe because“auntie made me promise to never let it get outside the family!”

Would guess it has a drop of mustard but otherwise no discernible other additives.

Thanks!

Soulds good want to try it but was wondereing if anyone knows the calories. I try and eat healthier but want to try new things.

Rosalund,

I don’t use a calorie counter program so I can’t tell you how many calories are in the whole recipe or how many per serving. Mayonnaise is the main ingredient and it’s a high calorie item. Using Comeback Sauce sparingly would bring down the calorie count per serving.

Comeback sauce is the best. My granddaughter and I made up a batch this morning. I can’t wait to use it on pulled pork on Saturday. I think I’ll try it on my turkey sandwich for lunch today.
Thanks do much for the recipe.

I pinned this recipe last year, and just got around to making it this morning. Never tried Duke’s until now, and let me just say, OMG, it’s the best mayo I have ever put in my mouth! We’re from north Louisiana, and we have a Raising Cane’s down the street, and the sauce tasts EXACTLY like theirs if you add a few more drops of Worcestershire sauce. So glad I found this! We’ll be using it a lot! Thanks for posting!

LAMom,

I’m so glad you enjoyed the recipe! You’ll be sure to keep a jar in your fridge now that you’ve tried it! 

Duke’s is the best mayo, in my honest opinion.
