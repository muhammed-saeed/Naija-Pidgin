 My Shocking Discoveries of Fast Food French Fries 
 By Doug Purcell 

I use to believe that the reason why Americans ate poorly is because they are simply living in a fast aced society, and are misinformed. Know I don’t believe that. With many great products out there such as“super size me”Americans should get the point that fast foods are terrible for you. I remember in my Psychology class we were talking about eating disorders and the girl that sat next to me mentioned to our teacher about“super size me.”
She told our teacher of the negative effects that fast foods had on American people. And what she said last disturbed me, she said that right after she saw the movie, she went to get some McDonalds! Some people know the information but they just don’t care. I will have more understanding for someone that has no idea, but if you’re an adult you should take more responsibility for your eating habits.

One for your health and well being, and two if you have kids you want to ring them up eating the good stuff. Okay know let’s talk about fast foods. Most people know that fast foods are not good for you, but most of them don’t know what exactly makes it unhealthy. Well let me tell you something about fast food restaurants; in the early years they were not that bad for your health. That’s right when McDonalds first started it was a decent place to eat.

Everything was made from scratch, the way food should be. The potatoes were cut and peeled and fry that day. They didn’t add any chemicals or who no what else to the foods, everything was natural. Well with industrialization comes their benefit, but however it did have their negatives. In the 1960s McDonalds started to cut it labor costs so it got ride of the people that chopped and peeled the vegetables. They soon discovered the idea of pre making everything. That translates to processed foods. Many people didn’t realize the change in taste.

When I was writing this article I decided to call my local McDonalds and ask the manager some questions. I asked how the fries are made and what equipment they use to fry them. The manager was very clueless, she just said that the french fries arrive from the truck everyday and that they deep fry it in the fryer. That’s alls he knew about the fries . What surprised me is not only how clueless the customers are about the food they are receiving from fast food restaurants, but also how clueless the people are that is actually working there. It’s like me receiving food from a truck and me just prepare it and eat it. Do you really trust that? Well many people are doing that when they are picking up pre frozen foods and not reading the ingredient information.

The McDonalds restaurants became an assemble line. There were large factories that mass produced the food products and they hired people to do individual tasks whether it is to fry potatoes, put the condiments on burgers, or serve drinks. They needed an easier way to make mass productions of there food. In the early years McDonald made there fries from cottonseed oil and beef lard or tallow. That what gave McDonalds fries there secret taste. Well, ever since then there were complaints and etc going on about the overdose of saturated fats in which McDonald’s food had. So in 1990 to replace the saturated fat content they started using vegetable oils, in particular hydrogenated vegetable oils. The effects of hydrogenated oils are far more dangerous than saturated fats. Are they worth your health?

 Road restaurant counterfeit 
 Niagara County sheriff’s deputies on Saturday the 20th traced a counterfeit $20 bill passed at a South Transit Road restaurant to the Buffalo area.

The manager at a BK told deputies the money was exchanged at the restaurant’s drive-through window about 1:30am. An employee actually managed to obtain the vehicle’s license plate number, and the car was traced to a Buffalo man who said he received it from someone else.

 Safe Fast Food? 
 You may want to send your child with a sack lunch these days, that is if you want them to have food that is safe. A USA Today investigation revealed last week that the U.S. Department of Agriculture allows millions of pounds of meat into to the nation&apos;s schools that would not pass inspections by fast food chains like McDonald&apos;s or Burger King!

 Fast food restaurant 
 A Marshall deputy is suing a local Wendy&apos;s franchise after a restaurant employee admitted to placing his body hair on a sandwich. Deputy R. Sleeth and his wife, who are represented by Wheeling attorney David Jividen, brought 11 counts against three former Moundsville Wendy&apos;s employees.

Thomas Bender, one of the former employees, previously admitted he put the hair on the sandwich then served it to the deputy at the drive-through in March but the deputy noticed the hair before he ate the sandwich.

Bender was fired from the restaurant and took a plea bargain before heading to a criminal trial. The lawsuit says that Bender &quot;breached the duty of care owed to the plaintiff by conspiring and to adulterating food being prepared…thus causing the plaintiff injuries.&quot; Another employee, Joshua Monroe, was also fired and has not yet been to trial. Monroe is accused of encouraging the act. Upplagd av Charisma kl. 22:56 Inga kommentarer: Etiketter: Fast food restaurant

 Fast Food Menus 
 What if fat does not make you fat? That is the question scientific journalist Gary Taubes asked in a 2002 New York Times article that challenged 60 years of conventional wisdom.

Taubes has now carried the concept further. In the year 2007, he published an expose on the junk science and failed public policy of the nation&apos;s low-fat, low-cholesterol diets. This siege has undoubtedly cost the beef industry millions, perhaps billions, of dollars.

Taubes&apos; 500-page best-selling &apos;Good Calories, Bad Calories&apos; examines thousands of science projects and then states that animal fats are not the problem of our obese and chronically ill society, but carbohydrates are.

Good Calories, Bad Calories examines the diet and health conundrum as Taubes follows research clear back to the late 1800s. In those early years, even with limited scientific testing available, Taubes documents that science was already linking refined carbohydrates and starchy foods with weight problems. Also with &quot;chronic diseases of civilisation&quot; such as diabetes. Upplagd av Charisma kl. 05:28 Inga kommentarer: Etiketter: fast food menus

 Fast food in France 
 The enthusiasm for la restauration rapide comes closer as consumers in France continue to feel a financial pinch. In the meantime, the nation&apos;s historically frosty attitude toward American burgers and fries appears to be thawing.

Long ago, McDonald&apos;s franchises in France were met with heavy protests. Now, at the end of last year, McDonald&apos;s France says that more than 1,100 Golden Arches throughout France rang up sales of€3.3 billion—an 11% increase over 2007.

Long live la restauration rapide:) Upplagd av Charisma kl. 03:29 Inga kommentarer: Etiketter: Fast food in France

 Avoid processed foods, fast food and days without physical exercise 
 
We can&apos;t hope that individuals can muster the self-discipline of their own to avoid processed foods, fast food and days without physical exercise. Instead the idea is that governments must actively work to change environments and reduce the menu of harmful options available in everyday life.

Now we have hundreds of towns in Europe and elsewhere that have adopted a version of this strategy, aimed particularly at preventing children from becoming overweight and obese. They have hired dietitians to counsel children and their families in schools, organized walk-to-school days, hired sports educators and even built new sporting facilities. The U.S. government is increasing its funding for cities and towns to pursue so called community-based obesity prevention, in an effort to gather data about which kinds of tactics work best.

&quot;Finally, people are acknowledging that the obesity problem is so pervasive that it isn&apos;t just because people are making bad choices&quot;, says Laura Kettel Khan, an obesity expert at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which makes grants to states for community obesity-prevention programs.

 &quot;Other programs focus on what you eat. This program focuses on eliminating your appetite. I lost 31 lbs. without having to use willpower or suffer from feelings of hunger, cravings or compulsions. I look and feel great and I love hearing the compliments.&quot; 
 
 &quot;However, last night, I listened to your Compulsive Overeating reframing CD…only one session, and today my self esteem is sky high (it’s never been).&quot;
