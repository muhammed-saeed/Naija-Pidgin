 It’s the Little Things That Drive You Nuts 
 Posted on July 5, 2012 by middleagedplague 
Yesterday was one of those days when nothing went right, and I wouldn’t have noticed it if it had.
 
See this? this is NOT the kind of day I was having yesterday. Wading, by Steve Henderson of Steve Henderson Fine Art
 
The details don’t matter, as I’m sure you have your own version of special days like this: the toilet overflowed, the dog ran out of food, people streamed in and out of the door constantly interrupting my work (as if this is anything new), I was tired, couldn’t find my left flip flop (it was in the bathroom; its mate beneath the dining room table—something to do with Toddler visiting, I imagine; come to think of it, maybe she had something to do with the toilet, too), lunch’s potato soup was anemic and listless, the check didn’t arrive in the mail but the bills did–

My major concern was that 24 hours wouldn’t be enough to fit it all in, and the extras would spill over into the next day.

Obviously, none of this stuff is major, but an overwhelming compendium of trite, trivial, bothersome details running into the back of one another and knocking down the living room lamp (that didn’t happen, fortunately) sets the mood and tone of the day in such a way that the best thing to do with it all is to drag yourself into the evening and call it all done.

Which I did.

Eight p.m. found me literally rolled up in the hammock (it was cold), swinging back and forth . . . back and forth . . . the hypnotic pendulum movement disengaging conscious thought. If I wanted to be spiritual about it, I’d say that I was“being still and knowing that He is God,”but I wasn’t knowing much of anything by that time other than that the dishes were done, the laundry put away, the e-mail inbox addressed, the dog fed with the new bag of food, and the Toddler—thank God and the Norwegian Artist, the latter who took control of this part—read to and tucked away for the night. One hoped.
 
Finally, a break in the day, and relief from the storm of inconsequential yet draining events. Break in the Weather, available as an original and signed print, framed and unframed, by Steve Henderson.
 
On my way inside—to my book, jammies, and early bed (which I appreciate although the Toddler does not)—I stopped to visit the box of unwanted kittens from the most recent unsolicited pregnant stray cat dumped off at our country home ( Life Is a Gift ), and I did something I haven’t done for a long time:

I sat on the ground, scooped up the kittens, and played. While the mother cat wasn’t enthusiastic about this (up to this point, she’s managed to keep them all—by sinister growls—huddled in that box;“It won’t last,”I try to tell her)—I had fun, and so did they.

I flopped them over and checked their genders—they all look like boys to me, but what do I know? I’m just the daughter of a microbiologist—kissed their noses, felt their scratchy little claws on my bare legs, and totally lost myself in fur and felines. I felt like I was eight-years-old again.

I don’t know how long I was there, but for the first time that day, the minutes fled effortlessly by, and by the time I tucked everybody back into the box, where it looked like they had no intention of staying, I was breathing normally again.
 
Child and adult—we don’t just share the same beach, we share the same person. Reflection, by Steve Henderson.
 
Book, jammies, bed, sleep—and I find myself in tomorrow today, with a working toilet, still no check, a better breakfast than yesterday’s lunch, and a box of active kitties ready to play when I am.

Little things. They can drag you down or build you up.

 Heads up: Thirty of my essays in Kindle friendly version will be appearing soon, entitled Life Is a Gift, and featuring a painting of the Norwegian Artist after every chapter. I’ll let you know when the e-book is out on this site, but you can also find out on my Facebook Page , Linked-In , and Twitter .

 Empowerment: Making Your Own Bread 
 Posted on June 26, 2012 by middleagedplague 
Back in the 1970s, the status symbol for school-aged children who brought their lunch in a brown bag (we did that back then) was Wonderbread.

White, squishy, soft, building our little bodies in 12 different ways—combined with bologna it represented the pinnacle of elementary school sophistication and finesse.
 
Sunshine, laughter, good food, and play—these are four great ways to build happy little bodies. Summer Breeze by Steve Henderson of Steve Henderson Fine Art
 
And of course, my mother, being who she is, did not buy the stuff in the white bag with the blue and red and yellow bubbles spattered joyously—like balloons—about, but rather, the substitute—still white, still squishy and soft (my brother used to roll it into a ball and throw it at me), the exact same thing but it came in the wrong bag.

Nobody else knew this, but I did.  My power lunch may have looked like the real thing but it wasn’t, ultimately being nothing more than an ersatz proxy of the genuine article, although what the genuine article was supposed to be is a conundrum.

While my mother more than once was a  dampening influence on the social status of her youngest child (I have inherited this trait), she was quirky, which meant that, far more times than I realized, she came up with innovative, unusual ideas totally out of step with the culture of her day.

One of these was making sour dough bread from scratch, a family project involving two weeks of stirring a grey slurry that looked more like something you’d slather on your walls that insert into your alimentary canal. Eventually the concoction was pronounced ready, mixed with yeast and flour, kneaded, shaped, and slipped into the oven.

Seven of us—two adults and five children—watched through the miniscule window of the oven as the bullet-shaped loaves plumped and browned into something that was completely foreign to our visual experience. (I tell these stories to the progeny and they stare:“Were minds, as well as pursuits, so much simpler back then?”)
 
Modern life does not have to be as complicated as we are making it. Afternoon Tea by Steve Henderson of Steve Henderson Fine Art
 
When the aroma hit our olfactory glands we collectively oohed.

But it wasn’t until the bread came out of the oven that the action really started: it takes seven people less than five minutes to completely annihilate two loaves of freshly baked sour dough bread, and that we did, staring disconsolately at the empty cookie sheets and wondering if we had to wait two weeks to repeat the experience.

“If we’re going to eat it that fast,”my mother pronounced,“it’s not worth making.”

“But we haven’t wasted it,”I pointed out, my eight-year-old brain instinctively referencing the ultimate sin of leaving good food—which back then consisted of cow’s tongue, liver and onions, and boiled zucchini—on the plate, wasted, when it could have been feeding the starving children of whatever country my mother had heard about in the news that day.

While we never repeated the experience (my argument must not have been as strong as I thought), its memory never left me, and when I was 15 and alone in the house with a bag of flour, a packet of yeast, and some water, I made my first loaf of bread.

I have never looked back.
 
Forward, onward moving through life in general and through the adventure of making bread—I am surprised at the places I find myself.
 
There is something exhilarating, empowering, and enervating in making something that you are accustomed to buying, and bread is a great—and cheap—way to start. My gift to you this week—my wonderful readers—is my recipe for Quick, Cheap, Simple French Bread. 

Bon Appetit!

 Quick, Cheap, Simple French Bread Recipe 
 Posted on June 26, 2012 by middleagedplague 
 Homemade bread doesn’t taste anything like what you’re accustomed to buying in the store—Thank God. If you’ve never made bread before, cut yourself some slack—your first loaves may not be picture perfect, but they’ll more than likely be edible. As with anything, the more you practice—and learn from your mistakes and successes—the better you’ll get. If you want to read the article that inspired my publishing this recipe, check out Empowerment: Making Your Own Bread. You can read it while the bread is rising.
 

Ingredients:

 2 1/2 cups lukewarm liquid (think: baby bottle safe). I used a mixture of whey and leftover tea, but milk will do, or water; cold coffee will provide an interesting flavor, but please, not pop/soda

 1 Tablespoon or packet yeast (I use quick rising)

 1/3 cup oil or melted butter (I used olive oil)

 1/3 cup sugar or 1/4 cup honey 

 1 teaspoon salt 

 6-9 cups flour (may be whole wheat or white or a blend of the two; I used 4 cups whole wheat and the rest white; you probably want to avoid 100 percent whole wheat if you’re a novice at this)

 2 Tablespoons Dough Enhancer , if desired, and if you’re using whole wheat flour. (It’s not necessary, but if you have a high proportion of whole wheat flour, it tenderizes the final product)

1) Pour the liquid into a large mixing bowl .

2) Sprinkle the yeast atop and let it sit for a minute .

3) Add the oil, honey or sugar, and salt. Whisk with a spoon, whisk, or hand mixer.

4) Mix in three cups of the flour. You can stir the whole time with a spoon or beat with a mixer. I prefer to use a mixer with dough hooks because the longer I beat the dough with the mixer, the less time I have to knead it, by hand, later on. Whether you stir or mix, make sure the flour is completely incorporated and you have a smooth slurry or batter before you add more flour.

5) If you are using Dough Enhancer, this is the time to sprinkle it over the batter and work it smoothly in.

6) Add another cup of flour (this is four in all) —by this time you should have a stiff batter. If you’re using the mixer and the dough hooks, do so for five minutes or so. What you’re doing is developing the gluten, the protein composite found within flour, and doing so will enable the bread to rise more efficiently. You can either hold the mixer still and move the bowl (choose a direction, clockwise or counterclockwise, and stick to it) or move the mixer (again, either direction, but the same one). Gluten develops in strands, and if you maintain the same direction of stirring or mixing, you avoid“breaking”the strands.

7) Depending upon the power of your mixer, add up to another 2 cups of flour , a half-cup at a time, until you have a stiff dough. At any point, if the mixer is straining too much and not blending the mixture well, switch to a wooden spoon. (The amount of flour you ultimately use is variable, depending upon the amount of moisture in the flour itself, as well as in the environmental air around you. I made this batch on a rainy day in June, and ultimately used nearly 8 cups of flour.)

8) By now your mixture should be relatively stiff. Stir in another cup of flour (7 cups in all, by now) until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. If you need less flour to achieve this pulling-away-from-the-sides-of-the-bowl thickness, use less. If you need more, sprinkle it in—a quarter cup at a time—until you get there.

9) Sprinkle a half cup of flour over a clean, dry surface on which you can need the bread . Dump the dough from the bowl onto the floured surface.

10) Now it’s time to knead. With floured hands and the dough in front of you in a sort of circular shape, gently grab the top half of the dough and fold it toward you. Push this down with the heel of your hand, and turn the dough a quarter turn (to the right, or left, but be consistent). Repeat the action of folding the dough in half, from the top and toward you, and pushing it down with the heel of your hand. This is the action of kneading , and if you’re absolutely whacked as to how to do it, please follow the link or Google“How to knead bread dough”to find a video or photo reference.

11) Knead for 10-20 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic, sprinkling flour on your work surface, a quarter cup at a time, to keep the dough from sticking. (I used an additional 3/4 during my kneading process). Because this is French bread, which rises without a mold, it needs to be a bit stiffer than if I were making rolls—I kneaded until the bread didn’t stick violently to the surface of the counter when the flour was all used up.

12) You can tell you’ve kneaded enough by rudely poking your finger into the dough —along what you’d like to do to the shoulder of the driver who just turned in front of you and cut you off. If the dough springs back with some degree of energy, it’s ready.

13) Pour 2 Tablespoons of oil into a large bowl, plop the dough on top of it, turn the dough so that both sides are oiled, and cover the dough with a clean towel or plastic wrap. Let sit for 45 minutes to 1 hour at room temperature, until doubled. (If the room temperature is 95 degrees, the dough will double faster than if the temperature is 72 degrees.)

14) Punch the dough, with your fist, to deflate it. Flip it over.

15) Grease two cookie sheets .

16) Cut the dough in half, and shape each half into a long bullet. You can do this freehand, or you can roll each half into a 12 x 20 inch rectangle or so, and roll up tightly, from the widest side, into a cylinder. Pinch the bottom shut, and shape the ends into loose points. Put each bullet onto a cookie sheet. My sheets are sized so that I have to place the loaves diagonally so that they will fit.

17) Cover the loaves, loosely, with a light towel. You can also set the cookie sheets into the unheated oven on a lower rack. Drape a towel over the upper rack.

18) Let the loaves rise for 20-40 minutes, until doubled .

19) 10 minutes before you think the loaves will be doubled, pre-heat the oven to 385 degrees (taking out the dough from the inside of the oven, obviously, if that’s where you put it). Many recipes tell you to bake at 400 to 425 degrees, but in 35 years, I have never encountered an oven in which one can successfully do this. The product generally turns out hard, burnt, and more black than brown. Every oven is different though—and through trial and error, you will learn yours.

20) Slash the loaves with a sharp knife, 1/2 inch deep, diagonally at 2-inch intervals .

21) Bake the bread for 20 minutes, until it is browned on top, and lightly browned on the bottom. If it’s not brown at 20 minutes, cook longer. If you’re nervous that it’s burning, check, quickly, at 17 minutes. Remember, if you used whole wheat flour, that the dough in its raw state is brown already; what you’re looking for is that it is browned —a darker color than when you put it in.

22) Take the bread out. For a softer crust, rub the surface with butter.

23) Let the bread sit 20 minutes for slicing. This is very important, since the bread continues to bake with residual heat, and this step finalizes the interior baking. If you slice too soon, you may wind up with a gooey center.

24) Eat, enjoy, analyze for future improvement, and congratulate yourself for making a product that has fed mankind for centuries.

Leave me a comment if you have any questions or frustrations, and I’ll reply. Because I really don’t live at the computer, I may not reply at the very time you are experiencing frustration, but I will reply.

You did it!

 Life Is a Gift 
 Posted on June 20, 2012 by middleagedplague 
Well, one of the kittens died.

I know, it was grey and ugly, the product of its homely, drab, tabby-striped, alley-cat, pregnant feral mother that someone dropped off on our property. The morning she gave birth we all looked at one another and said,
 
Grey is such a drab color, so opposite to the way the Norwegian Artist paints. But even grey, in its own way, is beautiful. Autumnal Reflections by Steve Henderson.
 
“Great. Four new grey and ugly alley cats that all look like their mother.” And then we found the family a box that we set on the porch where it would be safe, put out food and milk, and guarded the area from the chickens (they’re bullies, you know) while the mother ate.

“Maybe,” I told the Norwegian Artist, “after we feed her for several weeks, she’ll feel safe and warm and wanted.”

“That’s what I’m afraid of,” he responded, and proceeded to coo at one of the kittens. Okay, to be strictly honest he didn’t coo, but he didn’t snarl either. The lifting of his upper right lip could as easily be interpreted as a smile as it could a sneer, but I’ve never known the Norwegian to sneer.

There’s something about motherhood that ennobles animals who are otherwise anything but noble, like this ratty, random cat. Within hours she had commandeered the porch, streaking like a bullet from the box toward any animal that stepped within 10 feet. When Mozart, the Russian Blue patriarch who has benevolently overseen the feline farm for 15 years, padded softly behind the carrier, there was a pronounced thwack as the new mother poofed up, her trebling, trembling tail hitting the ceiling before she hurtled onto the bewildered interloper.
 
Motherhood—and fatherhood—are beautiful and ennobling things, in the world of humans and in the world of nature itself. Reflection by Steve Henderson
 
Ten seconds later she was back in the box, licking the grey matters of any dirt they could have picked up in the interval of her absence.

Three of the grey matters were quiet and complacent, the fourth piercingly and unrelentingly strident, which I attributed to its blindly – and I mean this literally – wandering far away from its mother and out of the box, where it yowled and its mother looked concerned, not quite sure of what to do. I kept putting it back, commenting to Tired of Being Youngest, “This one’s going to die if it doesn’t stop wandering away.”

As it happened, it did die, but not because it wandered, but because it just stopped – stopped yowling, stopped striving, by next morning stopped breathing, leading me to wonder if it had been yowling for more reason than just being intrepidly stupid, and if the mother never stirred herself to rescue it because she knew it was better not to.

So small. So innocent. So beautiful even in drab greyness. It lay in my hand, sleeping a deeper, more permanent sleep than its littermates, which it looked just like, but it wasn’t, not anymore.

Tired of Being Youngest wrapped the body in a soft pink cloth, then dug a tiny grave beneath the maple tree, where nobody will inadvertently plant tomatoes. She covered the top with rocks (to discourage the dog), and ended the ceremony by strewing the surface with flowers.
 
Life is a gloriously mysterious and mystically beautiful gift. Spirit of the Canyon by Steve Henderson, available now as a signed limited edition print.
 
Yes, it was an ugly, unwanted grey kitten from an uninvited cat, and there are three more that look just like it still in the box. But for a brief moment it was alive, and loud, and outwardly normal – a promise of life enigmatically aborted at the point when it had just begun.

And this promise of life, and then absence of it, awes me – because life is a precious, awesome, mystical and mysterious thing, something I have no power of granting or taking away, but can only mourn, and marvel.

Life is a gift.

 Conquering Fear 
 Posted on June 14, 2012 by middleagedplague 
My vivid imagination, in conjunction with a Type Triple A, drive-it-to-the-ground personality, means that I conjure up all sorts of dire and dreadful scenarios for any given set of actual facts. The less probable the outcome, the more likely I am to come up with it, and I am fully capable of fancying an array of potential scenarios ranging from the mundane to everything that you find in a Bruce Willis movie.
 
I never have seen Bruce Willis out in the wilderness, subjugating things. His wilderness is an urban one. The Pataha, by Steve Henderson, available as signed limited edition prints
 
(As an aside, have you noticed that Bruce always starts out crisp and clean—well, as crisp and clean as Bruce can manage—and by the end of three hours looks like something the cat upchucked on the back porch?)

I digress.

Through the years, the progeny has been the primary recipient of largesse from their parent’s dubious gift of mental B-grade screenplays, and they are all  familiar with the admonition, upon their going somewhere, anywhere, of “Don’t get stolen!”

Now that they’re older, my parental thoughts run less on their accepting candy from strangers than on their forgetting to turn off the car lights, stranding them with a dead battery in a strange city, at night, in one of those covered high-rise parking lots where bad things ALWAYS happen.

And with the three minutes left on the battery of their phone, they call me:

 “Mom, I’m someplace in inner city Chicago. And the car won’t start.” 

It’s not as if, like any parent, I don’t have original material to work with. It’s just that, when it actually happens, it’s never like I fear it will be (sometimes it’s worse). Whatever it is and whenever it happens, however, it’s real life, in real time, and we all get through it.
 
There&apos;s a difference between what we dream, daydream, and fear. The daydreams are definitely the best of the three. Daydreaming, by Steve Henderson, is sold, but note cards of the image are available. Just follow the link on the picture.
 
Last night, I had a dream – not a Martin Luther King dream – in which I spent hours on the computer, viewing one website after another, hitting links, reading content that didn’t actually exist because it was circumscribed to what I created in the subterranean miasma of my fog-befuddled subconscious.

At some point, I awakened enough to realize this, my intellect delivering a stunning piece of coherent thought:

“Don’t waste time,” it told me, “following non-live links.”

While this idea has been expressed far more eloquently by others – the apostle Paul comes to mind with his “Whatever it true, whatever is noble, whatever is right,” recommendation in Philippians 4:8 – it never hit so hard as when I awoke from three hours of work with absolutely nothing accomplished, because everything I had read or seen was confined to what I had generated in my mind.

It wasn’t real. It never would be. And I didn’t have the power to make it so, or not so.

“Why then,” I asked my fully wakened mind, “do you waste so much time – sometimes under the guise of prayer – thinking, fearing, and worrying about, what could happen?
 
Life, in real time, offers beautiful, fear-free moments worth filling our thoughts with. Dandelions by Steve Henderson of Steve Henderson Fine Art, available as an original, miniature study, note card, and soon, a signed limited edition print.
 
“Why do you follow links that exist only because you think they do?”

Bad habits don’t disappear overnight, and they don’t just “disappear,” actually, without significant work, discipline, and effort on our part. So one little dream won’t lasso my tumultuous thoughts into submission.

But that dream, however, is a step forward, one of many through the years as I absorb what the word “Trust” means, and Who it is that I want so desperately to give that trust to.

Someone with Live Links.

 Forgiveness 
 Posted on June 6, 2012 by middleagedplague 
A friend and I have developed a coping mechanism for forgiving reprehensible people in our lives who have hurt us. It goes like this:

Forget about trying to love these people. The warm fuzzy feelings just aren’t there and we’re in no mood to generate a substitute.
 
We do not love everyone in our lives like this -- and it&apos;s unrealistic to expect ourselves to do so. Madonna and Toddler, available as an original and as note cards, through Steve Henderson Fine Art
 
We will, however, refrain from actively hating them.

 “How immature.” 

Yeah.

Probably.

I am mature enough to acknowledge that I am immature. Like a plant in the garden, I am growing, still needing care, not quite the towering oak spreading a canopy of grace over the world at my feet.  Actually, were I to describe myself as a plant, I would choose something shorter – like a pumpkin, or summer squash.

Meaning that, in my zucchini/crookneck world, if the realistic choice is between artificially generating feelings of bonhomie toward a reprehensible, arrogant, conceited, supercilious slob of a human being or just knocking that dervish out of my mind altogether, I’ll kick the bum out.

 “You should love your enemies.” 

(By the way, I know that it’s not you slapping me around with these admonitions, which probably grate on you as much as they do me. Some irritating invisible individual is blathering about in our brains.)

The notable C.S. Lewis, who by outside accounts was a crusty, irascible, impatient sort of being, mused on this issue of loving one’s neighbors as himself in his hallmark book Mere Christianity , which you can either download onto your e-reader or, since its cover won’t give away your embarrassing reading habits like 50 Shades of Grey , is safe to carry around in hardback or paperback form.

“Well, how exactly do I love myself?” Lewis asks, reasoning that he does not exactly “. . . (have) a feeling of fondness or affection for myself, and I do not even always enjoy my own society.”
 
One way that we love ourselves is by cutting ourselves a lot of slack, trying to understand why we did what we did. Contemplation by Steve Henderson
 
He continues, “. . . thinking myself nice is not why I love myself. So loving my enemies does not apparently mean thinking them nice either. That is an enormous relief.”

Indeed it is.

Years ago I shared a city that was much too small for the two of us with a woman who was outwardly gracious and kind to every citizen of the community but very, very different to me. As these situations usually go, we ran in many of the same circles, and when I wasn’t in the same room with her, I was listening to her praises cascading from the lips of others.

Early on I realized that schooling my outside features to pleasant neutrality was not enough; inside, I could either seethe at the woman or let her go outside the cage of my mind.  Because she never did accommodate me by moving to another continent, I was forced to take the high road, for my own sake, and determine to not hate her, which I most effectively did my removing her from my thoughts altogether.

I loved her – my enemy – by choosing to not make her a substitute god to which I offered too many waking thoughts – bitter, acrimonious – as if they were a prayer.

Not the best solution, but one that worked, allowing my spirit to survive – even grow – to the point that before we parted company I was able to vaguely understand her, pray for her, sympathize for her hurts that I understood and sorrowed for.

But I never did like her.

So love your enemies and forgive them as best you can – and an acceptable place to start is by not denying that they hurt you and you don’t particularly like them because of this, and while it would be so spiritual to pray for their well being, you’re not there yet, and until you’re strong enough to resist eating the entire chocolate cake in one sitting and totally destroying your diet, you’ll just forgo temptation and keep the stuff out of the house.

 Lost in the Box Store—Where Are the Socks? 
 Posted on May 31, 2012 by middleagedplague 
For years, whenever I wanted to fully express the abject monotony of a mind-numbingly tedious task, I drew upon the comparison of buying a pack of socks.

How wrong I was.
 
The path to purchasing socks, far from being straightforward and clear, winds and wends in an ever changing path. Expose by Steve Henderson
 
Humbled now, wrung by a recent shopping ordeal, I determined that never again will I discount so lightly an undertaking which, far from being simple, is intricately and multifariously complicated indeed.

This particular shopping fiasco started when the Norwegian Artist announced that all of his socks had died, interred in holey ground, and since I was the next lucky family member to be heading into town, would I pick him up a packet please?

Black. Crew length. Not cheap. The Norwegian is a man of simple tastes.

I picked a box store, any box store (they call them this, by the way, because these one-stop-to-shop-until-you-plop centers are rectangular and windowless, like a box) and headed to the men’s section where I found myself awkwardly surrounded by smiling cardboard cutout males in boxers, briefs, thongs (disturbing, I know), jammies, t-shirts, muscle shirts, a-shirts – but no socks.

Thrice I orbited the undie wall, captivated by the stuff that men wear out of sight under their jeans (Sage and purple stripes—Really? And down to your knees? I don’t think so) until the awkward glance of the sales associate young enough to be my son brought me back to reality. I wouldn’t want to ask someone who looked like my mother either why she was wedged, Twilight-Zone style, in the second most boring section of any store, the first being the sock department.

Which, in this store, apparently did not exist.
 
I would have had more luck finding the sock department in the midst of Bryce Canyon National Park than I did in the box store. Descent into Bryce, available as an original and a limited edition signed print, through Steve Henderson Fine Art
 
I left the smiling men, skirted through women’s lingerie, somehow found myself in the toothpaste aisle, ducked past the potted plants, and was ready to leave, defeated, when I decided to use the bathroom and found the sock section buried in the back corner with restrooms.

Who designs these floor plans anyway?

Unbeknownst—seriously, that’s how you spell it—to me, the hard part of the task was yet to come.

Do you know how many varieties of black, crew length, and definitely not cheap men’s socks are out there?

One brand divided itself into bronze, silver, and gold multiplicities, with updated market prices to match.

Another had an industrial, extra industrial, and super industrial strength, leading me to conclude that the plain industrial product must be flimsy in comparison to its brothers.

A third had a blue stripe across-the-toe, green stripe, and red stripe varieties, but no elucidation.

There were socks with tennis player on the packaging and suit-clad businessmen, with hikers and lumberjacks (side by side – is that a good idea?), and one giant bag with SOCKS blazoned across the front. I knew enough to avoid that one.
 
So much variety, so much color, so much beauty in one place -- this describes the ocean, not the sock department. On the Horizon, available as an original and a limited edition, signed print through Steve Henderson Fine Art
 
I felt as if I were taking some massive multi-choice test in which all of the answers – A through K—looked exactly the same except for an extra comma in Sentence A, a semi-colon in B, a period in C, I could go on forever because I really do like punctuation, but I won’t because I see your eyes are getting glassy.

What I did do was close my eyes, grab a package, and run – not suspiciously so as to attract more attention than I already had – to the nearest and only functioning check stand in the store, where the woman ahead of me and the store associate were staring down, transfixed, at a pair of black men’s pants. They looked like they had been standing that way for a long time, and were planning to continue to do so for an equivalent duration.

There is a reason why I hand-knit all of my own socks.

 I Am (amazon) Woman—Hear Me Roar 
 Posted on May 23, 2012 by middleagedplague 
It was—literally—a small thing that I wanted, but my entire family gaped at me in horror, as if I had brightly announced,

“I think I’ll sell my body on the streets to pick up a little pin money.”

“I can’t believe you’re serious,”was the general consensus.
 
I put a significant amount of thought and care into the concept of buying an e-reader. Catching the Breeze by Steve Henderson
 
“Where are your values?”the Son and Heir challenged.

Even the Norwegian Artist looked shocked.

Before you join them, relax. My knees are not designed for short skirts, and when I clomp around in heels I look and sound like a rhinoceros in a thong.

All I coveted was a Kindle e-reader , which, in this family of voracious literary fanatics who run their fingers over high gloss pages, murmuring,“This is typeset in Calisto 12-point with one-inch side margins on heavy weight, high gloss cotton stock. You can smell the quality emanating from the tome,”went over with thundering thump of censorious opprobrium.

“I’m shocked,”commented Tired of Being Youngest, looking up from whatever it is that she does all day on her Ipod.

Eldest Supreme tore away from Facebook on her phone long enough to add her DisLike button.

“Y R giving in 2 the electronic world”College Girl texted.

The Norwegian Artist, who is old enough to remember, and have read, Ray Bradbury’s Farenheit 451 and George Orwell’s 1984 , looked concerned, an expression similar to the one he wears as he trolls through the library’s audio books section in search of the next volume he will download to listen to while he’s painting.
 
It&apos;s because I love reading so much that I pursued this e-reader thing over the vociferous objections of my tribe. Provincial Afternoon by Steve Henderson
 
What is the problem with these people?

Every Sunday—when the library is closed along with the rest of the village–I find myself book-free, having stayed up late the night before to find out who-dun-it, so desperate for reading material that I scour the newspaper classifieds for“Animal Feed and Hay,”“Aircraft,”and“Appliances”(there’s a swamp cooler for $75; is that a good price?). I have not yet dropped so low that I pick up the sports section, but I do pore over the Wal-Mart and K-Mart ads, comparing sock prices.

I would seriously pity a person in this condition.

But pity doesn’t get you anywhere; action does, and on a day out to the Big Town with Tired of Being Youngest we stopped at a magic store, a Ben Franklin birthday bill in my pocket, and I bought the thing. Its arrival to the household was greeted with the same enthusiasm shown toward the abandoned, pregnant, stray gray kitty that someone dumped on our porch.

I don’t care. I don’t care. I spent an exhilarating afternoon learning my new toy, downloading an addictive game, and checking out as much free stuff as I could find. That next day—Sunday—I selected from four different novels, and the game, and I played and played and played.

And then I put the Kindle down, just for a moment, and didn’t see it for several hours.

Tired of Being Youngest had discovered the game.

The Son and Heir pored over The History of Ancient Numibian Culture (it was free!).

Toddler was over—dang if she isn’t taller, with a longer arm reach than I realized—and we all know what toddlers do when they see buttons. We also know what adults do when they see toddlers pushing buttons on expensive electronic items.

When the Norwegian Artist rescued the item from Toddler’s grasp he stopped to look at my home page.“Did you download any Zane Gray?”he asked.

That’s enough. It’s mine. And so is vengeance.

Kindle, you have kindled a fire in the quintessence of my concupiscent literary soul.

 The Formidably Frightening Car Alarm Fiasco 
 Posted on May 15, 2012 by middleagedplague 
So I’m sitting in the car when I hear the tell-tale snick of all the doors locking.

“All the doors just locked,”Tired of Being Youngest announced helpfully from the back seat.
 
Calm, gracious, and superb around young children -- this is Tired of Being Youngest&apos;s usual state. Dandelions by Steve Henderson
 
“I noticed that.”We are vaguely disquieted.

I’m in the passenger seat, holding the keys, waiting for the Son and Heir, my apprentice driver, to finish looking at blocks of wood in a friend’s yard. As a woodcarver, he’s in the equivalent of my yarn shop, debating the merits of walnut over oak, locust over birch.

I hit the button—click—and unlock the doors.

Two minutes pass of the Son-and-Heir critically viewing blocks of wood, hefting this one, peering at that one, setting two side by side and stepping back for a better view, when the doors lock again.

Snick.

The sense of mutual disquietude in the car deepens.

I unlock the doors with a click. Two minutes later they lock again.
 
Surrounded by silence, except for Snick, Click, Snick, Click. Autumn Sail by Steve Henderson
 
Snick. Click. Snick. Click. Eventually,  understanding and motherly patience exhausted (there’s a reason why no one ever accompanies me to the yarn store), I click a last time to unlock from the inside and open the doors.

Big mistake.

Apparently, all this time the car has been trying to tell me something—concerned that no one is in the driver’s seat but someone is on the passenger side, fiddling with the keypad—it launches the alarm, that loud, raucous beeping people generally ignore because it happens so frequently, but which is outrageously overwhelming when you are sitting in the midst of it

Simultaneously, the Voice in the Back choruses with my own to screech out the obvious:

“The car alarm is going off! The car alarm is going off!”(I’m sure that the neighbors appreciated this concise explanation of the situation at hand. We really should have been there for Paul Revere’s ride.)

Despite the illusion of being cool, calm, and over the age of 40 (this last one no illusion), I am not immune to feeling like an idiot in the midst of a boisterously rollicking fishbowl. It is the unrelenting noise, however–which reminds me of a newborn with colic and the instinctive response of”Make it stop! Just make it stop!”—that freezes my brain and fingers.

“Make it Stop! Just make it stop! Everyone’s looking at us!”I’m not sure which of us shrieked this, but it represents the general consensus of our collective thoughts.

Frantically pushing buttons—the lock button, the unlock button, the panic button, the lock button twice, then the unlock with obsessive compulsive finesse—none of these make a difference. Although the entire fiasco involves less than 15 seconds, everything moves slowly, like a dream—except, mercifully unlike a dream, I don’t look down and find that I am unexpectedly topless, or have wandered into a public bathroom with unstalled doors and toilets set about, randomly, in the middle of the floor.

“Push the panic button!”

“I did!”

“Then lock it and unlock it and push the panic button!”
 
This all happened because of wood. Alpine Spring by Steve Henderson
 
“I am!”

“Then put the key in the ignition and start the car!”

That’s actually a very good idea.

I follow through. Start the car. Relieved that the proper key is in the proper place, it stops the alarm.

Ah, Silence. You Dogood.

The only sounds are the gentle thunk of a piece of wood dropping to the ground. The Son and Heir discovered some maple in the pile.
