Guest Commentary: We need to change the way we create jobs in a new economy Published on: Aug 29 2011 - 12:01am Doing the same thing over and over and over while expecting a different result is one part insanity and two parts bad planning. It is time to get out of the recliner and take charge of our own destiny. Waiting for Uncle Sam or the State is simply not a logical option. Does the federal or state government have the financial resources to build infrastructure, put up brick and mortar or fund short or long term business ventures? No, they cannot, at...

Bias is in the eye of the beholder Published on: Aug 28 2011 - 12:01am To the Editor:
Recently the Herald published a lengthy piece by a conservative reader purporting to objectively analyze the“bias”of the political content of this paper. Not surprisingly, he found a liberal bias in virtually everything he looked at, including cartoons, columnists, letters to the editor, and Our View, although some were rated close to neutral.
While I take him at his word that he believes he gave fair... ‘The love of putting pen to paper’ Published on: Aug 28 2011 - 12:01am  BISBEE—The love of putting pen to paper came early in the life of Pearl Watkins, planted by a seed from the Lewis Carroll novel,“Alice in Wonderland.”“I read it when I was about seven and I realized that one could create a world within a book,”said Watkins.

That means you’ll need to be more vigilant about watering, although if your monsoon was anything like my monsoon, you really didn’t get much help from the rains this summer anyway. Pay special attention to trees, shrubs and other perennials planted within the last year or so as their root systems probably still aren...

The day got started with a boat race. However, this wasn’t any normal boat race; these boats were made from plastic bottles. I judged the boats on design, creativity, originality, buoyancy, and durability. But the prize for best boat design was only 1,000 pesos. The real money went to the winner of the actual race. Contestants had to... Our View: Let’s answer the Army’s call for help Published on: Aug 28 2011 - 12:01am One week ago in this newspaper we published a front page article on the need to help the Salvation Army meet its demands during trying times.
Considering how well our communities rallied during the Monument Fire, providing shelter donating money, food and whatever else was needed, it wouldn’t be surprising if all of us are a bit tired of the word “donate.”With that in mind, thank goodness for the Salvation Army...

Dear Prof: Help for parents and their children using home computers Published on: Aug 28 2011 - 12:01am Dear Prof:   Do parents know if their children are using their computers, handhelds, or smart phones for school projects? Although home computers and WiFi devices offer many advantages for children to gain high-tech skills and enhance their school work, there is a downside if parents do not know how they are being used and if they do not take actions to ensure that these devices are not being misused.

I have voted since I was 21, many years ago, and after the last 12 years I am really disgusted.
Think about it, if the parties did not want our troops in the Near and Middle East they would not be there, no matter what us stupid voters want.

Hello. I recently moved to Sierra Vista two weeks ago and am living with family with the desire to stay permanently. The climate, geography and community are wonderful.

It is horrible.

Ten years ago if a woman left a briefcase unattended outside a local retail store, with its key taped to the top, a clerk would pick up the item and restock it. There would be an assumption that the customer was returning the briefcase.

Many of these traditions date back decades or generations, and range from the solemn to the light-hearted.

Our Readers&apos;Views: One can&apos;t deny evolution Published on: Aug 22 2011 - 8:42pm To the Editor:
I have followed the evolution/creation controversy for years and I’ve learned one thing for sure. Whenever a young Earth creationist quotes a prominent scientist as rejecting evolution and supporting creationism, the creationist is, well, inaccurate.
So, when Mr. Vandivort recently claimed that noted astronomer and author Robert Jastrow“admits that the evidence lies with creation, not evolution,”I was...

There’s also the question of whether we’re a federal republic; and if so, how terms like capitalism, communism, and socialism fit in.
In sorting through these terms it helps to separate them into two groups: Democracy, republicanism, and federalism describe political systems, while capitalism, socialism, and communism describe economic systems....
