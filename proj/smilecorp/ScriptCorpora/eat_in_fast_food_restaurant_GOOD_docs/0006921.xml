I&apos;m generally a fan of Del Taco, but this review is for one thing....

It&apos;s 2010, why doesn&apos;t Del Taco have established debit/credit card machines in their restaurants? I know they cost quite a bit to run, but for a prominent fast food restaurant, one would think you could invest in it. I think it&apos;s funny whenever I go through the drive-thru, they have to grab the little machine and hold it out so I can put my pin in...or...as it was a few months ago, they&apos;d have a little notepad for me to sign off my receipt...Ha!

That&apos;s still better than the local by Six Flags in Cali where I had to use the atm in the store that translated to the register and gave me cash with a stupid fee.

dumb.

I don&apos;t do fast food, but I do Del Taco.  The only thing I ever order is the 1/2 pound bean and cheese burrito, and I&apos;m convinced its the best edible 99 cents out there.  Why?  They use lard-free refried beans.  And that means everything.

I&apos;ve had bean burritos everywhere, and Del Taco&apos;s is the one of the few that doesn&apos;t give me stomach discomfort and I&apos;m positive its because of the omission of the lard.  The tortilla quality is decent, too.

You have the option of Red or Green sauce, too... Get the red.

As for the restaurant itself, I&apos;m also happy with the friendliness of the staff as well as the cleanliness of the establishment.  And with the money you save, you can go to RA for happy hour the next day!

If this Del Taco was only open from 10pm-6am, I am confident it would still be profitable. The after hours rush of drunk college kids is so large it is difficult to find a table Friday or Saturday night around 2am. One time, when I was there around 1:30am on a Friday, a kid grabbed the microphone that the employees dictate orders into and started freestyle rapping. Don&apos;t tell me you can&apos;t get that kind of action at Taco Bell. Most of my trips occur around 1am on weekdays, so I miss the rush.

The food, well, what can I say, it tastes amazing. It should though, since most items take a grease bath and effectively use tortillas as towels to soak up the tastyness and lock it in. I prefer the Chicken Chedder Quesadilla. Also, Tuesdays are for tacos, I think you can get 3 for .99 cents.

Del Taco is one of those BAT joints. What is a BAT joint you ask? Better After Ten. This means most of the time you will find it to be most desirable after 10pm. Some of my other BAT restaurants include Filiberto&apos;s and Jack in the Box.

Oh yea, and despite the frequent presence of unkempt drunk college kids, this Del Taco has good service and is quite clean inside.
