 Incredible food and service. I live five minutes from North End Pizza and eat there two or three times a week. They have incredible food and service! The pizza and subs are made of a NY/NJ style crust/bread which I love! The stromboli and manicotti are particularly delicious! Great appetizers (extra crispy fries and onion rings along with fried mushrooms and zucchini) are fantastic. I have had so many great experiences at this Oceanfront restaurant!

 Best Pizza at the beach, hands down.. I&apos;ve been eating at North End for about 15 years now and the food hasn&apos;t changed. From their authentic NY-style pizzas to their Philly cheese steaks and delicious Greek salads, North End never fails to satisfy. Whether it&apos;s lunch after a day on the beach or delivery that night, it beats any chain restaurant around. …
