 *Nutrition and ingredient information 
 is based on standard product formulations. Variations may occur 
 due to differences in suppliers, ingredient substitutions, recipe 
 revisions, product assembly at the restaurant level, and/or season 
 of the year. Certain menu items may not be available at all locations. 
 Temporary products are not included. Nutrition calculations follow 
 federal regulations regarding the rounding of nutritional data. This information is effective as of March 2012.

 Wendy&apos;s International, Inc., its 
 franchisees and employees do not assume responsibility for a particular 
 allergy or sensitivity to any food provided in our restaurants. 
 Federal regulations have identified 8 major food allergens: milk, 
 eggs, wheat, soybeans, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and crustacean 
 shellfish. For your convenience, menu items and ingredients that 
 contain these major allergens have been indicated. Foods cooked 
 in common oil have also been indicated as possible allergens. 

 Federal regulation has exempted from 
 allergen declaration any highly refined oil derived from the major 
 food allergens; therefore, soy oil as an ingredient is not indicated 
 as an allergen. Please consult your Doctor to know if you should 
 avoid products that contain highly refined soy oil. 

 Wendy&apos;s encourages anyone with food 
 allergies, sensitivities, or special dietary needs to check our
