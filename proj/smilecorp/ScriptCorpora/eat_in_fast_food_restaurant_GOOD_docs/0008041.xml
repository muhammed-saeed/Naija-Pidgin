Mcdonaldization of society

 The convenience and cost-effectiveness of McDonaldization , the process by which the principles of the fast food restaurant are coming to dominate more and more sectors of American society as well as of the rest of the world , slowly and steadily happened that it has taken time for its adverse effects to sink in into our consciousness . Nevertheless a conscious and studied effort must be undertaken to consider the irrational &apos; implications of a supposedly rational logic . Since McDonaldization encompasses too many industries and too many facets of human endeavors , then maybe we should 
 
first determine how people react to it as a concept
Dealing with the issues of McDonaldization can only be dealt with using a McDonaldized approach - examining the issues at hand and breaking them down into smaller issues and rationally assessing them according to their effect on people in particular and on society in general . This is also true with www .expedia .com , one of the world &apos;s leading online travel companies . Expedia provides travelers with the ability to research , plan , and book their comprehensive travel needs using Expedia-branded Web sites featuring airline ticket sales , hotel reservations , car rental , cruises , and many other services from a broad selection of partners
George Ritzer , author of the book McDonaldization of Society &apos; also thinks that peoples &apos; attitude about McDonaldization will determine how they cope with it as it expands and tightens its influence over society An &quot;iron cage &quot; for some may be a &quot;velvet cage &quot; for others , a world that represents their standard of good taste and high quality and , therefore they can think of nothing better than an increasingly rationalized world . Expedia represents a dotcom where travel choices and options are laid down rationally , from their choices of airlines , schedules , and seat class to other travel nuances such as hotels and car rentals . For them , HYPERLINK &quot;http /www .expedia .com &quot; www .expedia .com , a certified McDonaldized organization , is not a threat , but a peek at Nirvana . According to Ritzer , these people will do nothing about McDonaldization because they like and accept it
Some other people recognize the threats of McDonaldization , but feel its advantages in terms of the system &apos;s speed , efficiency , predictability and objectivity . These are the people who use their online computers to pay their bills , source tickets for a concert , and make airline seat reservations at HYPERLINK &quot;http /www .expedia .com &quot; www .expedia .com for business or leisure trips , local and abroad . In Ritzer &apos;s words for them bureaucracy and rationality construct a &quot;rubber cage &quot; that they can enter into and escape from at will . In their heart of hearts , these same people are likely to be the type to go on mountain climbing outdoor camping , fishing expedition , and other nature-tripping activities
Finally , there are those who fear and loathe McDonaldization and regard it in the same manner as philosopher Max Weber do -- an iron cage They prefer going through the trouble of making telephone calls and doing an extra trip to a ticketing office to discuss...
