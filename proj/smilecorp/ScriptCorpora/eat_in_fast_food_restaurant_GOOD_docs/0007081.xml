Easy Homemade Chicken Nuggets
 
Almost everyone likes homemade chicken nuggets but few people seem to make them. Why? Because it&apos;s less hassle to run to Wendys or McDonalds and pick up 50 chicken nuggets for seven bucks. Well, depending on what you have in your house it&apos;s not much more to make homemade chicken nuggets in your own fryer, and the taste and food quality is beyond anything you can get in most any restaurant, let alone a fast food restaurant.

I make this meal about every two weeks because it&apos;s inexpensive and it&apos;s my families favorite. Here&apos;s a quick list of what you need to make your own home style chicken nuggets using your home fryer.

Fried Chicken Nugget Recipe - What You Need
 
 1 full boneless/skinless chicken breast
 24 to 30 ounces of vegetable oil a box of Drakes or Fry Daddy frying mix a box of Shake-n-Bake coating (or cheaper, whatever flavor you want) a little bit of milk nerves of steel! (ok, thats me being dramatic)
 
 
Fried Chicken Nugget Recipe - Prep
 
 Turn on your fryer to get it warmed up. Mine has a chicken icon on it, set yours to around 300 degrees.
 With a sharp knife and a cutting board, cut the chicken into small cube (less then an inch square) Place the chicken cubes in a bowl. Pour a little bit of milk and/or water over the chicken to moisten them up. Mix the chicken in the bowl. Refrigerate until ready. Take one bag of shake-n-bake mix (the seasoning and the clear bag you shake it in) and place half the bag of shake and bake plus a cup or so of Drakes/Fry Daddy into the clear bag. Shake it up real good. 
 
Fried Chicken Recipe - Fry It!
 
 I have a smaller fryer, so I grab around 8 to 10 pieces of chicken at a time and throw them into the mixing bag Shake the chicken pieces in the mixing bag real good. Take a look to make sure the chicken pieces all have a coat on them Gently place the freshly coated chicken pieces into the fryer, one by one. Space them apart so they have less chance to stick together. Let the chicken cook for 3 minutes, then use your stirrer to stir the pot a bit Let the chicken cook another 3 to 4 minutes then remove from the fryer What I do is place 4 napkins on a large plate and put the freshly fried chicken onto them so the napkins will soak up the vegetable oil Let them set about 5 minutes before eating. Enjoy them then thank me later.

Deep Fryer Comparisons
 
I wanted to drop a quick word about deep fryers if you dont own one. What one should you get? Some are thirty bucks. Some are over a hundred. What you should buy depends on two things

 How much or how big of an item do you want to fry at once? How easy do you want to clean it. 

My home fryer is a cheapie. It&apos;s small. It&apos;s not super easy to clean but not horrible. I think I paid $30 for it. It works for me but keep in mind I&apos;m limited to small items like chicken nuggets and fish fillets. If you want to cook things like chicken breasts or several larger parts at the same time, get a bigger fryer. Don&apos;t worry about any fancy doo-dads or bells and whistles. A fryer just heats up oil at the temperature you tell it to. That&apos;s it. Shop around and get the fryer that fits your budget and needs; nothing more.
