Is this an encyclopedia article or an advertisement? I think it should be removed. SR
 Looks like an encyclopedia article to me. A bit short, though. Bryan Derksen &quot;Hey folks, Subway® Restaurant&apos;s 7 sandwiches with 6 grams of fat or less have a calorie range of 230-370 and have as little as 3 grams of fat. Choosing one of these subs can save hundreds of calories and at least 21 grams of fat in just one meal! Buy now! Look at Jared, he lost hundreds of pounds, so can you! Come to Subway!&quot; ...and that is advertising! ~ RW It looks like both. I&apos;d favor editing out details about the store&apos;s offerings, and beefing up the corporate info. -- 67.171.28.197 04:47, 3 Jul 2004 (UTC) 
What, aside from being an oxymoron, is &quot;vegetarian meat selection&quot;? Tjwood 22:44, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)
 I was thinking the same thing. SECProto 00:17, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC) Most likely referring to the fake meat products vegetarians like to eat - some of them taste pretty good, in my opinion, although perhaps not exactly the same as true meat. My local Subway does not sell them, so I can&apos;t confirm that any of them do. Perhaps some confirmation, and rephrasing, is do? RW 02:22, Jan 6, 2005 (UTC) 
Subway has more outlets than McDonald&apos;s? This fact needs to be linked to some document.
 I&apos;ve added subway.com&apos;s History of Subway as an external link. Quoting: &quot;It is the world’s largest submarine sandwich chain with more than 21,000 restaurants in 75 countries. As a matter of fact, the SUBWAY® chain operates more units in the US and Canada than McDonald’s® does.&quot; RW Hello everyone, I am new to wikipedia and I know I have done a major edit(and am about to change other things ) to this article and to avoid having anyone think I am being a vandal- I thought I&apos;d list why I&apos;ve changed some of the things-they are all factual- I am an area supervisor for a large subway franchisee. (1) the headquarters of DAI the parent company is Ft. Lauderdale, FL (for tax purposes). The day to day operations are conducted by Franchise world headquarters in Milford, so I didn&apos;t change the box on the right of the page. (2) Someone had put that in the 1990&apos;s . Subway overtook Mcdonalds in the US. This was even reported in some newspapers and magazines. This was not true. They became the largest restaurant change in North America in the 1990&apos;s. This year they should (or may have already) overtake McDonalds in the US. (3) I put information about the original location and name in the article. Fred DeLuca himself once said he changed the name because when people would call and hear &quot;Pete&apos;s Submarine ...&quot; they would think that they were a Seafood Pizza shop. Not sure if he was kidding so left that out of the article. jcam More edits- (1) moved sentence about Jared to first paragraph to avoid having info of similiar info listed twice separately. (2) removed reference to why a submarine sandwich is called a sub- a first grader could figure that one out. (3) Included information about subway corporate structure. Some cynics have described the structure of subway to a mafia organizaion with DAI being the &quot;godfather&quot;(no I didn&apos;t put that in the article !!!) (3) Cleaned up some of the listings of subs (including the reference to &apos;veggie burger&apos;- don&apos;t know why someone listed that since that is an optional product which isn&apos;t at even half the Subway&apos;s. I left it in their but changed it to Garden Burger/Veggie Max since, I think a &apos;veggie burger&apos; is something which is meant to taste like a beef hamburger but is not. The Subway&apos;s which do serve the Veggie Max serve something which many resemble a rectangular burger, but the intent was not to make it taste like a burger(imho it tastes like stove top stuffing)(4) added reference to toasting which was a major subway decision brought about by competition from Quizno&apos;s . -- jcam 
SR is 100% correct ... this is clearly an advertisement&amp;the corporation&apos;s minnions are very quick to remove or reword any legitimate criticisms so that they look favourable to the company. This makes a joke of any pretences this page has to being an encyclopedia entry so yes it should be removed or at the very least completely&amp;impartially reworked. Ashtonstreet01 ( talk ) 04:56, 30 November 2007 (UTC)

 Reinstatment of Subway&apos;s inconsistent comparison advertisements 

&quot;Furthermore, Subway is inconsistent with their comparison advertisements. As explained previously, Subway never includes cheese, mayo, or other high fat condiments in their sandwiches&apos; nutritional content. But when they compare their sandwiches to that of fast food sandwiches (such as the Big Mac and Whopper ) in their advertisements and on their napkins, their nutritional content is taken straight from their competitor&apos;s nutrition information, which in the case of McDonald&apos;s and Burger King , always includes their standard condiments, including cheese/special sauce (Big Mac) and mayo (Whopper). Thus the comparisons shown on TV are not completely accurate or fair.&quot;

Okay, I recently tried to reinstate this paragraph only to get it shot down by (I&apos;m guessing a mod) for apparently not providing sources. Well, the sources would be Subway&apos;s/McDonald&apos;s/Burger King&apos;s online nutritional information along with Subway&apos;s napkins (which does a side-by-side-by-side comparison of one of Subway&apos;s sandwiches along with the Big Mac and Whopper). But how does one go about citing these sources while at the same time not making the paragraph unneccesairly longer? Also, how does one site a napkin ? I believe this is a very important part of the criticism section so I do want to see how to make this bit of info acceptable. 76.177.174.82 00:58, 26 April 2007 (UTC)

 More food 

A way to get them to put more tomatoes, pickles, etc. on your sub is, instead of asking for a sub &quot;with everything,&quot; say &quot;with tomatoes... and pickles... and olives... and jalapenos...&quot; etc., etc. adding one ingredient at a time. That works sometimes, because if you say &quot;with everything,&quot; they try to be sparing with the ingredients in order to make room for everything, whereas if you ask for one ingredient at a time, they just pile it on there until it can hardly fit. Now there&apos;s good eatin&apos;. Nathan256 29 June 2005 15:14 (UTC)
 Subway tricks, eh? Well, I&apos;m never stingy with the vegetables. People can say I&apos;m stingy and don&apos;t give as much out because of food costs, but people have to remember- I don&apos;t give a damn about food costs! Deskana 22:58, 15 July 2005 (UTC) 
Yes maybe you&apos;re not stingy but perhaps you&apos;d prefer not to have a sub with everything falling out of it in front of your customer.

Just make sure that the &apos;with everything&apos; doesn&apos;t include ghb in your drink
 It annoys me when people do that too... because they don&apos;t know our managers can give us grief if we put the salads on in the wrong order ... seriously! Subway regulations can be stupid. Deskana 19:21, 20 August 2005 (UTC) 
The worst offenders are the Rottinghaus Company, based in La Crosse WI. They own several Subways in the Midwest from Wisconsin to Missouri and Kansas. They used to stick with a &quot;formula&quot; for the amount of veggies and meat that went on the sandwiches and salads. Now due to the rising food costs, they tell their &quot;sandwich artists&quot; to be &quot;con artists&quot; and skimp on everything thay can when making a customer&apos;s sandwich. If a sandwich artist actually makes a sandwich according to Subway&apos;s product formula, that particular store manager will not make the unrealistic food cost percentage that the owners insist each store makes and gets disciplined. I used to work for these people and I don&apos;t know which was worse, The store owners or the customers who caught on to this scheme. I tried several times when I was a store manager to contact the owners or even the district manager about this issue and was told by the district manager that she did not have to communicate with the store managers unless there was a problem with their weekly sales reports and she would not accept phone calls from them. So much for company support. I quit as soon as I heard that. —Preceding unsigned comment added by Kcbadboy ( talk • contribs ) 08:31, 19 May 2008 (UTC) 

 Sub Club 

I changed the &quot;last date&quot; for the Sub Club because the Subways in my market are going until 1/28, but I&apos;m not positive that there aren&apos;t any going even later... does anyone have a definitive answer? Brjaga 05:25, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

Hi, do you have a source for the change in the Subway date? Thanks. Tfine80 05:25, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

Nothing I can link to, but I work at one in Southeastern PA, and we&apos;ve had a poster on our wall since mid-October saying we&apos;d redeem them until January 28. Trust me... I&apos;ve told plenty of customers, so I know I&apos;ve got the date right. Brjaga 05:27, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

Some American (I&apos;m English) customers I served on New Years Eve said that their market had phased them out already when I offered them stamps. We certainly have no plans to phase them out- the owner fitted a new reel in the stamp machine today. Deskana (talk page) 23:37, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

I&apos;m surprised your store is still giving them out to be honest! I&apos;m a Subway franchisee in the North of England, which was one of the first markets in the UK to phase out the stamps. All the communication I&apos;ve seen from around last May onwards has made it clear that stamps are being 100% phased out in this country with no exceptions. Certainly I&apos;ve not been offered any at any of the stores I&apos;ve visited in recent months.

I&apos;d be very surprised if your store continues offering them for much longer, especially considering the replacement swipe card is due to start trialing this year. Khronos 17:05, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

Just been to a store tonight for dinner, and, as far as I know, there are no plans to discontinue the stamps here in Brazil. Psi-Lord 04:17, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

I am an assistant manager in a Subway in the northern US, the plans (for America anyway) are to all be swipe cards, from what I understand certain owners dislike the idea, especially those without a cheaply gotten DSL or other high speed internet connection, those areas are still doing the stamps. We and most of the US use the cards at this point, $1 earned per point, 75 for a foot long, 50 for a six inch, and so on for others. -- BradytheLo ( talk ) 02:51, 2 November 2008 (UTC)

 Article edits 

I made major edits to the article formatting. This is so that hopefully, someday, it will be a featured article! I was looking at the menu on the McDonald&apos;s article and I roughly based it off that. I removed the amounts of slices and stuff that is put on as it is relevant only to an employee of the company, really. Any other questions about my edits, feel free to contact me directly if you want. :-) Deskana (talk page) 23:45, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

 More stores than McDonald&apos;s 

I think the reason there are physically more Subway stores than McDonalds is that a Subway store simply costs a lot less to build/maintain than a McDonalds.

To really compare the two, and then discuss reasons, sales volume is a better metric. 63.173.203.140 20:01, 9 February 2006 (UTC)Paul
 A fair comparison I&apos;d say. The store I work in (Stockport, UK) is one of the biggest in the area, and the McDonalds near it has twice as much space on the ground floor alone, ignoring the second floor which is actually even bigger. Technically speaking, the area of their store is 4 times larger and ours (and they have their own car park) out back, including a drivethrough section. Deskana (talk) 20:17, 9 February 2006 (UTC) 



 Subway Location 

Our city now has two Subways. One just opened up in Wal-Mart. This one served breakfast, while the one in town does not. PrometheusX303 00:33, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

 Subway in Finland 

There are at least four or five Subways in Helsinki alone now, and most likely at least one in all other major cities (Turku, Tampere, Lahti, Jyväskylä, Kuopio, Oulu, Rovaniemi, ...) also. Thanks to Subway, I have all but stopped eating at McDonald&apos;s or Hesburger when I eat fast food. The only thing I don&apos;t particularly like is how they wrap each straw in a separate plastic container. It&apos;s a straw! It&apos;s not going to be a major source of contamination! Could the restaurant try to be a little more environmentalist? J I P | Talk 21:57, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

 Too much menu info, not much else. 

Seriously, this article is like 60% menu info. Not like an encylopaedia should be at all. This should be stripped down and more actual corporate, company info should be added - it should probably we entirely re-written - anyone want to do this? Also, the History is terrible - just look at McDonalds to see how it really should be. -- Mark 11:37, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

 Menu 

Moved all the menu stuff into a new article: Subway menu as it&apos;s always going to be too listy to look any good inside the main article. -- I@n ≡ talk 14:54, 13 April 2006 (UTC)
 Good work, just what was needed. -- Mark 16:22, 13 April 2006 (UTC) The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposal. Please do not modify it. Subsequent comments should be made in a new section on the talk page. No further edits should be made to this section. 
The result of the debate was move . — Nightst a llion (?) Seen this already? 14:33, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

 Requested move 

 Subway Restaurants → Subway (restaurant) – The store is known as Subway . I&apos;ve never heard of a store called Subway Restaurants . Or to put it another way, McDonalds Restaurants is only a redirect to McDonalds . -- I@n ≡ talk 16:35, 13 April 2006 (UTC)
 I agree.-- Mark 16:22, 13 April 2006 (UTC) 
 Survey 
 Add * Support or * Oppose followed by an optional one-sentence explanation, then sign your opinion with ~~~~ 
 Support as proposer. -- I@n ≡ talk 15:13, 13 April 2006 (UTC) Oppose . At least in Canada, the TV commercials now sometimes say &quot;Subway Restaurants&quot;. I can only imply from the ads that &quot;Subway Restaurants&quot; is indeed the full name. Kirjtc2 16:23, 13 April 2006 (UTC) 
 Not per their website. Naming the article Subway Restaurants is like calling Toyota , Toyota Cars , or Goodyear , Goodyear Tyres or Hewlett-Packard , Hewlett-Packard Computers . -- I@n ≡ talk 16:45, 13 April 2006 (UTC) [1] has &quot;Official Subway Restaurants Web Site&quot; as the header. Meanwhile, this legal document [2] displays the legal name as &quot;Subway Restaurants Inc.&quot;, while this press release [3] announces the arrival of &quot;Subway Restaurants&quot; to the Illinois Turnpike, and this franchise directory [4] also calls it &quot;Subway Restaurants&quot;. Kirjtc2 04:19, 14 April 2006 (UTC) I am not a lawyer and I don&apos;t fully understand the legal staus of the company name, but that&apos;s not really the issue here. The article title should be the name of the restaurants which happen to be called Subway . Doctor&apos;s Associates Inc. and a legal entity that may or may not exist called Subway Restaurants can be referred to in the article. McDonald&apos;s refers to McDonald&apos;s Corporation in it&apos;s opening sentence. -- I@n ≡ talk 09:16, 14 April 2006 (UTC) Actually, the website refers to &quot;SUBWAY Restaurants&quot;. Surely if we&apos;re going by that argument the page should have the caps too. -- Darth Deskana (Darth Talk) 09:46, 14 April 2006 (UTC) I think that&apos;s because Subway is the name of the business, and because that word is very ambiguous, they sometimes put Restaurants to clarify. - Mark 11:00, 16 April 2006 (UTC) I work in a Subway in the UK and all the references to the company are either to &quot;Subway&quot; or &quot;Doctor&apos;s Associates&quot;. I have never heard the company referred to as &quot;Subway Restaurants&quot; in all my time there. -- Darth Deskana (Darth Talk) 16:57, 13 April 2006 (UTC) 
 Support . I&apos;ve never heard them call themselves &quot;Subway Restaurants&quot; before. By all means have a redirect ar &apos;Subway Restaurants&apos; though. -- Mark 16:27, 13 April 2006 (UTC) Support . I feel that them being called &quot;Subway Restaurants&quot; has been taken out of context. &quot;Come and visit our Subway Restaurants&quot; or something like that. Besides, I&apos;ve read all the small print on the signs at work (I work in a Subway) and have never seen any mention about &quot;Subway Restaurants&quot;. Actually we were given a survey by the council to decide whether our individual store was a restaurant or a fast food outlet... so I support, basically. -- Darth Deskana (Darth Talk) 16:55, 13 April 2006 (UTC) Support. Good way to disambiguate (is that english?) Sfacets 13:49, 14 April 2006 (UTC) Oppose . As I understand it, the correct name for the corporation should be used. That seems to be &apos;SUBWAY Restaurants&apos;. This name appears often on the web site. In fact, if you look at the title they use for the pages on their web site, it is some form of &apos;SUBWAY Restaurants&apos; Web Site&apos;. Vegaswikian 06:25, 18 April 2006 (UTC) Oppose It is not necessary to change the title. In fact, Subway receipts read &quot;Subway Sandwiches and Salads&quot;. -- Mrath 04:06, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

 The U-gouge Debate 

I think it should be mentioned somewhere in the article. Some may not remember, but they switched to the new side-style cut back in 2000 or 2001. There has been some criticism regarding this decision, as outlined in this infamous rant . -- Dragon695 22:57, 6 May 2006 (UTC)
 I&apos;ve seen that done and it seems a pain. Perhaps that&apos;s cause I&apos;m used to the hinge cut. Actually, if the hinge cut is done properly, then the sandwich does keep all the stuff in... people don&apos;t cut at the right angle, nor do they layer the salads correctly. I&apos;ve got it down to a fine art, even if I say so myself. -- Lord Deskana Dark Lord of the Sith 22:58, 6 May 2006 (UTC) I&apos;m moving the hinge-cut criticism here because it is unsourced. Subway is also criticized for their new &quot;Hinge Cut&quot;, a method of cutting the bread in one piece. This is as opposed to the old 2 piece U shaped canyon method of cutting the subs called the U-Gouge. [ citation needed ] Prome theus -X303- 23:08, 13 October 2006 (UTC) 
The forms they used when they did the u-gouge, held 5 pieces of bread horizontally, 2 forms, 10 bread, in a full pan. The forms now hold 4 bread per form, 8 per full pan, the bread flattens out more making it more suited to the hinge cut than the u-gouge. It is more difficult to accomplish now because of this. When I started at Subway, we still had the forms and in the time of transition, I was taught both. If you ask an average employee they&apos;ll only have a general idea of how to go about it, and usually butcher the task. -- BradytheLo ( talk ) 02:58, 2 November 2008 (UTC)

 Alternative logos 

I have seen some stores with alternative logos than the one currently in the article, I have seen a simular one but with a full black background and different style font, when I make one from a font on my trusted goldenweb.it it will apear here so you can see what it looks like, if you approve I will put it in the article. Lenny 13:25, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

 Image:Alternative subway logo.PNG An alternative logo, which I made. Lenny 13:34, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
 That&apos;s actually an old logo. They only changed within the last few years so a lot of locations still have it. Kirjtc2 14:13, 24 July 2006 (UTC) I see, I prefer the old logo out of the two as it looks newer! Lenny 14:27, 24 July 2006 (UTC) 
 Short independant bio of Subway 

Los Angeles Business Journal article on &quot;Restaurant groups&quot; has a short bio of Subway since it had the most locations in LA County: http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m5072/is_21_28/ai_n16484655 
 &quot; Subway has grown in recent years because it doesn&apos;t rely on extensive kitchen facilities and is thus able to open stores in smaller storefronts than other fast-food operations &quot; 
That&apos;s something to add to the article, at least; and theres much more there! JesseW, the juggling janitor 22:38, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

 Failed GA nomination 

I failed this article for two reasons. For one thing, it is underreferenced with only three to speak of. Also, it has a rather extensive bulleted list under the &quot;Pop Culture and Subway&quot; section. Some P. E rson 20:01, 22 September 2006 (UTC)




 Merge of Sandwich artist 

I feel that the Sandwich artist page should be merged into Subway. It is essentially a job description of a Subway employee, and is not that long. -- Mrath 04:09, 13 October 2006 (UTC)
 I agree. Between Operations and the menu section with a &quot;see below&quot; where the link is now? TransUtopian 23:42, 17 October 2006 (UTC) I agree too. Strong merge and cut down . There doesn&apos;t seem to be anything special about this position. Could be merged as a single line saying Subway store employees are known by this term Bwithh 03:35, 13 November 2006 (UTC) 
 Source for revenues 

In the article subways revenues for 2005 was stated as 9.05 billion USD, I couldn&apos;t find that anywhere on there website. Is there a source to back that up? Aren&apos;t they a privated company and therefore not required to publish financial statement? Pseudoanonymous 02:04, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

 Operations 

I removed the line &quot; Another example is in Mt. St. Helens. &quot; as an example of a &quot; non-traditional location &quot;. Being in or near a national park alongside other restaurants doesn&apos;t seem to be a non-traditional location. And that wording makes it sound as if it is in the actual volcano! :) Somebody may have just wanted to add that there is a Subway near Mount Saint Helens but put it in the wrong spot. 75.33.77.29 10:56, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

 Criticism 

I removed the following because it is not true:

&quot; On their website, Subway.com , the group specifies that a diet of Subway food will incur little or no weight loss. &quot; citing a &quot; Health Disclaimer &quot; at subway.com/subwayroot/menunutrition/jared/index.aspx 

What it really says is &quot; Your loss, if any, will vary. &quot;

 75.33.77.29 11:06, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

 Subway menu 

There&apos;s no reason to have a specific subarticle devoted to the Subway menu . That article is pretty close to indiscriminate information and should be cut radically. As far as I&apos;m concerned, the current two paragraphs in the main article are all one needs. Pascal.Tesson 17:00, 14 February 2007 (UTC)
 I agree. I&apos;ve made some edits to the menu article, but I&apos;m not sure why it exists in the first place. -- Zsero 19:15, 14 February 2007 (UTC) Yes, the information is rather indiscriminate and looks haphazardly organized. (There&apos;s a morbid fascination in including prices, sheesh.) The Subway B.M.T. at least should be pointed out somehow, as the Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Subway&apos;s B.M.T. resulted in a merge to Subway menu . Veggie Delite has an article, too. (I won&apos;t comment on the notability of that article.) Tinlinkin 01:18, 7 April 2007 (UTC) 
 Criticism 
 Furthermore, Subway is inconsistent with their comparison advertisements. As explained previously, Subway never includes cheese, mayo, or other high fat condiments in their sandwiches&apos; nutritional content. But when they compare their sandwiches to that of fast food sandwiches (such as the Big Mac and Whopper) in their advertisements and on their napkins, their nutritional content is taken straight from their competitor&apos;s nutrition information, which in the case of McDonald&apos;s and Burger King, always includes their standard condiments, including cheese (Big Mac) and mayo (Whopper), and their newest menu item, big salty hairyballs. 
This may be a confusing to people unfamiliar with Subway since they obviously don&apos;t have any &apos;standard condiments&apos;. I was considering improving it myself but I felt it would just make a bad sentence worse. Can anyone work out how to improve it or should we just delete the whole thing (which is unsourced anyway). Nil Einne 13:18, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

Subway&apos;s nutritional information currently uses the following explanation: &quot;Subs with 6 grams of fat or less include wheat bread, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, onions, green peppers and olives. All other sandwich values include cheese unless otherwise noted. Salads contain meat/poultry, standard vegetables and do not include salad-dressing or croutons. Addition of other condiments and fixings will alter nutrition values.&quot; The complete nutritional information download also lists the optional condiments and add-ons separately: http://subway.com/subwayroot/MenuNutrition/Nutrition/pdf/NutritionValues.pdf The criticism has been previously removed from the wiki but if it is restored it should at least reflect that cheese is only omitted for the &quot;under 6&quot; subs.

 What is Doctor&apos;s Associates? 

Doctor&apos;s Associates links here. It is not explained beyond &quot;Subway&apos;s parent corporation&quot;. So what is it? Who started it? Is Doctor&apos;s Associates a tax shelter for a certain group of physicians? - 71.51.51.120 18:04, 20 May 2007 (UTC)
 No: the &apos;doctor&apos; in question is Dr. Peter Buck . Tlesher 23:25, 10 June 2007 (UTC) Thank you. Believe it or not, I thought Subway did that to mislead customers into thinking that Subway&apos;s food was endorsed by doctors (as Subway does try to project a &quot;health food&quot; image). 76.177.190.137 15:45, 25 September 2007 (UTC) Actually, the name was chosen because (1) Peter Buck was indeed a doctor- a PhD not a medical doctor and Fred DeLuca, the other co-founder was going to college to become a doctor.

 Subway In PopCulture as Trivia 

I disagree with Skeezix1000 characterization fo the rewritten Subway in Popular Culture section as trivia and deserving of that tag. WP:TRIVIA lists inapproriate trivia sections as &quot;lists of isolated facts&quot; that ultimately make the article difficult to read. Certainly, the Subway in Popular Culture section met this requirement until recently. However, the suggested method for handling such trivia sections is by organizing them and incorporating them into the article. It even suggests that trivia can be &quot;grouped into a new section of related material.&quot; With the recent revision, I believe this is what has been done. The Subway in Popular Culture section is now in a clear, readable format that does not mar the presentation of the overall article. I do not believe that it any longer meets the definition of a trivia section according to Wikipedia&apos;s style manual. I would greatly appreciate any comments or other views.

It was probably an accident, but at 13:22, 21 September 2007 the link to an investigation of subways sub sizes was replaced to point to the subway webpage. I replaced the original link. ~~

 Myth or Truth??? 

I am posting this small article here on Wikipedia in search for the Truth, the question I pose upon you people is:

Do Subway pump the smell of fresh bread out into the streets to entice customers?

Only factual answers please, preferably with evidence to back this up! —Preceding unsigned comment added by Belly007 ( talk • contribs ) 19:36, 10 January 2008 (UTC) 


No we don&apos;t pump our bread smell out the only the reason you do smell that is usally the fan that sucks the hot air out of the store. This smell is only smelt when bread is being baked depending on how busy the subway gets. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 71.202.212.143 ( talk ) 04:19, 2 February 2008 (UTC)

 Vatican 

The list of locations included the Vatican... where would that be exactly? Apart from St Peter&apos;s Basilica, about the only areas of Vatican territory open to the public are St Peter&apos;s Square itself, and (for a charge) the Vatican Museum. There are a few other streets just north of the square, but the Swiss Guard won&apos;t let you in without some reason for being there. Anyway I&apos;ve been round all the public bits a year ago and I&apos;m 99% sure there was no Subway.

I&apos;ve just removed it from the list.. if there is actually a Subway please add it back, but remember the Borgo district (including Via di Porta Angelica) isn&apos;t Vatican territory. See the Google map [5] . 143.167.114.91 ( talk ) 16:25, 19 October 2008 (UTC)
 I&apos;ve never been there, but I just spent ten minutes on Google looking for one, and I think you&apos;re right. The only Rome-area address of a Subway is &quot;Via di Decima 12 Centro Comerciale Euroma2 Rome 00100&quot;. Google maps couldn&apos;t find this address, but it&apos;s not obvious that it&apos;s located in the Vatican. Tan | 39 16:34, 19 October 2008 (UTC) &quot;Centro commerciale&quot; sounds like a shopping mall. Definitely not the Vatican, actually makes me wonder how many other wrong entries are in that list! 143.167.114.91 ( talk ) 16:52, 19 October 2008 (UTC) Me again, from another PC in the uni library. Instead of fixing the errors in this list, why not get rid of it completely. It takes up loads of screen space and doesn&apos;t add much to the article. One line with this reflink [6] would be enough to show that Subway is a global business, and anyone that needs to can click it to see the countries. 143.167.169.28 ( talk ) 17:41, 19 October 2008 (UTC) Well, at face value I agree, but this seems to be an accepted section in many similar articles - see McDonald&apos;s or Burger King , for example. I think that you tweaking the list to be more accurate is fine; however, careful about just removing locations with no explanation. I would say in the edit summary why you believe that the location should be removed. Tan | 39 18:09, 19 October 2008 (UTC) Ok, if it&apos;s a standard feature then you&apos;re right to keep it. The countries I removed are the ones not in Subway&apos;s own corporate list (which I added at the top of that section as a reference) so I don&apos;t see how that could be controversial. 143.167.184.192 ( talk ) 13:41, 20 October 2008 (UTC)

 Unverified Voice-Over Claim Removal 

On 2 August 2009 an anonymous user added &quot;The voice-over in all the Subway advertisements was done by Donald James, who does proffesional voice-overs.&quot; See: Special:Contributions/58.105.183.66 . I am removing this for the following reasons: 1) This IP has previously been involved in vandalism. 2) There is no citation of a source of the claim. 3) I cannot find any confirmation of this claim elsewhere, even on Donald James&apos; own web site. 4) It was added in the wrong section. 5) The original edit was misspelled (though since corrected and reworded) 6) I have been involved in making Subway advertisements that did not use Donald James&apos; services. For all I know he may have done voice-overs for some or many advertisements, but the claim that he has done them all is demonstrably untrue.

The combination of these reasons lead me to believe that the addition is unsupportable. Jlick ( talk ) 09:09, 2 November 2009 (UTC)

 Drinks trademark not compulsory for Subway outside the USA

 New texting system 

There is currently a pilot program going on in San Diego, Bakersfield and some other college towns in Southern California that lets customers text in their orders and pick it up, instead of having to wait in line to order, pay and pick it up. I&apos;d like to create a new section called &quot;Texting Pilot&quot; or something similar and mention this. If this succeeds other Subway franchises nationwide might institute the system.

 Food quality? 

If this article is meant to be neutral, why is there is no mention of the fact that SUBWAY® sandwiches are well known for giving people diarrhoea ? The phenomena is even mentioned in an episode of Family Guy ( Hannah Banana when Peter Griffin says &quot;I just fed him a whole bag of SUBWAY® sandwiches. In a couple hours, we are going to sit around and throw his soft bread stool at each other&quot;. [ 1 ] I can only speak from painful experience after I used to work within walking distance of several SUBWAY® outlets. Periodically I used to buy a meal deal and then suffer chronic digestive tract failure six hours later. On doing a Google search for subway sandwiches plus: stomach ache , diarrhea or shits results reveals that from the amount of cites listed, other people also suffer from the same affliction. This is not just anecdotal evidence because these are only the cases where people have even bothered to report a problem. Who knows how big the real rate is? Ten fold? Twenty fold? I mean how often would you report that you had the craps after eating food from a particular fast food outlet chain on the net, if it were not a regular occurrence? To be balanced, over the years , I have eaten plenty of times at McDonalds or Burger King and never had a problem with any of their products (or Pizza Hut , for that matter).

But don&apos;t just take my word for it, this was posted seven years ago:
 Nothing Shits Bigger Than Subway I don&apos;t know what it is about Subway sandwiches, but man, you can count on one behemoth of a dooger the next day, or at least I can. I planted myself on the can and I thought for a moment that I may have, in fact, been losing my intestines. That Jared guy must spend the better part of his life sitting on the crapper. Posted by Ryan at March 14, 2003 04:39 PM Source 
I empathise with the guy. As I can speak from personal first hand experience. If this article is meant to be neutral, I can only think that the SUBWAY® must spend millions trying to keep this fact quiet and out of the mainstream media. I really do.

 Sub club phaseout 

Subway is no longer giving points on the cards. The points may be redeemed through July 31st, 2010 in some areas, I&apos;ve seen one mention in a forum that they&apos;re being cut off Feb 8th, 2010. The cards can still be used as reloadable cash cards for use at Subway restaurants. I&apos;ve seen the signs with the July 31 date at two locations.
 Strange, they&apos;ve only just started using them here in the UK. -- 139.133.7.237 ( talk ) 10:54, 20 May 2010 (UTC) 
The UK scheme is completely separate from the US cards. There is no cash card facility in the UK scheme and it runs to a completely different model, similar to that developed for the New Zealand market. It is due to be rolled out in other parts of Europe over the coming years. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 90.200.4.236 ( talk ) 20:57, 28 October 2010 (UTC) 

 U-cut v Side cut 

Would it be worthwhile including something about this? I don&apos;t know what the case is in the U.S., but in Australia Subway started to use a standard sandwich bar cut through the middle of the roll - causing the fillings to fall out easily. They used to use a unique-to-Subway U-shaped cut into the top of the bun and fillings were piled up inside the roll and the top placed back on - this technique created a roll where all the filling were on top of each other and they didn&apos;t fall out anywhere near as easily - a much better cut in my opinion. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 121.215.24.190 ( talk ) 04:50, 6 December 2010 (UTC) 

 List of restaurants 

I reverted the introduction of this section according to the following policies; MOS:FLAG WP:ICONDECORATION WP:INDISCRIMINATE . It&apos;s rather a long list and essentially is derived through original research using the source cited, which doesn&apos;t actually state the information conveyed. If there was a more straightforward cite that actually states the countries, or it was listed without all the icon decoration, it would perhaps be ok. Otherwise, I would suggest the best place to refer a reader where to find a Subway restaurant is the Subway website. -- Escape Orbit (Talk) 17:26, 8 January 2011 (UTC)

 Spnsorship ===Sponsorship=== Subway is the corporate sponsor in the NASCAR Sprint Cup series stock car for the Subway Fresh Fit 600 , held at Phoenix International Raceway . In addition, Subway is currently a primary sponsor for the NASCAR Sprint Cup number 99 car, driven by Carl Edwards . In 2007, Tony Stewart has appeared with Jared Fogle in ads, and he has driven his #20 Home Depot Toyota with Subway primary sponsorship in the 2008 Subway Fresh Fit 500 . Previously, Subway had sponsored Greg Biffle in the #16 car in 2005 and 2006. They also sponsor a pro-cycling team, and had their name on the shirts of Gretna F.C. before the club went bust in 2008. In the 1996 film Happy Gilmore , Subway was also the sponsor of the titular character. In July 2009, the Edinburgh Meadows baseball team announced that Subway will be their official sponsor for the forthcoming baseball season. Subway has also been a sponsor of the 2009 Little League World Series , where they advertised their Subway Fresh Fit Meals. 

 History prior to removal of unsourced material == History ==
 thumb|260px|Subway&apos;s logo used from August 28, 1965-2002. 

 Fred De Luca borrowed $1,000 from family friend Peter Buck to start his first sandwich shop on August 28, 1965 [ 2 ] , when he was only 17 years old. He was trying to raise money to pay for college. He chose a mediocre location for his shop, the corner of East Main Street and Boston Avenue in Bridgeport, Connecticut, but by noon on opening day, customers were pouring in. On the radio advertisement they had promoted the name as Pete&apos;s Submarines , which sounded like &quot;Pizza Marines&quot;, so they changed the name to &quot;Pete&apos;s Subs&quot;; eventually it adopted the &quot;Subway&quot; name and they decorated the store with maps of the New York City subway system; a theme that continues to this day. As of March 9, 2011, the company has 33,749 franchised locations in 95 countries and produced US$15.2 billion in revenue every year. In 2007, Forbes magazine named De Luca number 242 of the 400 richest Americans with a net worth of $1.5 billion.
 Subway restaurant, Pittsfield Township, Michigan 
In addition to traditional restaurants, Subway operates in many non-traditional locations. For instance, there are over 900 Subway locations in Wal-Mart stores and 200 on military bases, including several in Iraq and Afghanistan, in addition to three located inside The Pentagon , as well as an increasing number on college and university campuses.

Subway restaurants have been consistently ranked in Entrepreneur Magazine&apos;s Top 500 Franchises, and Subway was selected as the #2 overall franchise in 2008. Additionally, it was ranked as the #3 &quot;Fastest Growing Franchise&quot;, and the #1 &quot;Global Franchise&quot; as well. [ 3 ] In March 2011, Subway was ranked the most popular Fast-Food Restaurant in the United States of America in a poll of over 43 thousand social media users. [ 4 ] 
As of March 2011, Subway operates 34,246 stores in 95 countries and territories. [ 5 ]

 Sub Club (prior to removal of unsourced material) ===Sub Club=== Sub Club Cards and Sub Club stamps 
For many years, Subway restaurants offered a customer rewards program called the &quot;Sub Clubbers&quot;. Customers would receive special stamps with the purchase of a sandwich, earning one stamp for a six-inch sandwich and two for a foot-long; small cards called &quot;Sub Club Cards&quot; were also provided for customers to paste the stamps onto and keep them collected in an orderly fashion. Originally, stamps were redeemable for a free standard sandwich (charges for extras such as double meat or extra cheese still applied) with no other purchase required—twelve stamps for a free six-inch, and twenty-four stamps for a free foot-long. A Sub Club for kids was also established, with one stamp earned for every children&apos;s Value Meal purchased, ultimately earning a free children&apos;s meal for eight stamps. Later, the regular Sub Club was altered to eight stamps earning a free six-inch, and sixteen stamps for a free foot-long, with the added condition that a 21 fl oz (621 mL) or larger drink must be purchased to redeem the stamps.

In early June 2005, Subway announced that the popular customer rewards program would be phased out due to counterfeiting. Another reason, which was not stated by the company, for the discontinuation of the program was that there was a large amount of internal theft of stamps by Subway employees and affiliates, including the sale of rolls of the stamps online at places such as eBay . Officially the Sub Club program has been discontinued in the US and Canada by Doctor&apos;s Associates [ 6 ] and most other major markets such as Australia [ citation needed ] have also made local decisions to discontinue the program. The Sub Club program can, however, still be found in Germany and a small number of developing markets.

Participating Subway restaurants in U.S. and Canada now offer a &quot;Subway Card&quot; to customers, which functions as a stored-value cash card. In some states and provinces, the card also functions as a &quot;Subway Rewards Card&quot; allowing customers to earn points for free food and sandwiches. Unlike the Sub Club program, no other purchase is needed when redeeming points, and registered cards which are lost or stolen can be replaced. [ 7 ] Subway runs periodic promotions that provide free subs for preloading a Subway Card with certain dollar amounts, which are usually listed at mysubwaycard.com .
Restaurants in the UK and Ireland operate the &quot;Subcard&quot; rewards program. Unlike the US scheme, these cards cannot be used to store cash. 

 Products Subway&apos;s main product is the submarine sandwich along with options of salad and now breakfast (domestically). Many stores also offer cookies, muffins, and others desserts which may be purchased in a variety of flavors.
In order to ink the current deal with Coca-Cola , Coca-Cola offered to pay for the first rollout of toaster ovens to all existing restaurants in North America. [ citation needed ] Subway gave customers the option to have their sandwiches toasted due to increased competition from a rival sandwich chain, Quiznos , with the then trendy and standardized toasted submarine sandwiches . In Australia, the introduction of Fresh Toasting enabled the Subway Franchise to prevent Quiznos from gaining market share. The TurboChef and Merrychef toaster ovens are microwave-accelerated high-speed impinged hot air ovens. The deal with Coca-Cola led to Quiznos switching to Pepsi chain worldwide, except in Canada. Subway in Mexico still serves Pepsi products, however.
Subway menus varies by country optional program (COP), store optional program (SOP), market only program (MOP) but retain their main entrees which are included at every store. The main food sold by the store is Submarine sandwiches , sold in &quot;Six-inch&quot; (15 cm), &quot;Footlong&quot; (30 cm), 18 inch (45 cm) &quot;Mega Sub&quot; and the four inch (10 cm) &quot;Mini Sub&quot; sizes. All Subway stores offer customers lettuce, tomato, onions, and other common vegetables, as well as market selected options such as carrot, corn, radish and avocado. Like other fast-food restaurants, they offer &quot;limited time offers&quot; or LTO along with offers catering for all types of occasions. They offer &quot;Giant Subs&quot;, which are a minimum of three feet long. These giant sandwiches can be ordered in bulk and to nearly any specification, something which Subway has promoted as a part of their campaign to tailor every sandwich to the individual customer&apos;s taste. Subway also offers sandwich platters, which consist of 3 to 6 feet footlong sandwiches per platter. Cookie platters are also offered, consisting of 3 dozen cookies. 

 History section additions 

Hoping to get a discussion started on this content. A couple IPs have been adding the following text to the history section regarding a claimed youngest franchisee:
 (sample diff of edit being made) 
However, the addition is unsourced. Also, even if a source could be found, there&apos;s no content about any other individual franchisee owner, so I don&apos;t see any reason to raise this one above all others. It appears to be tangentally related trivia that doesn&apos;t belong in the article.

I&apos;ve removed the content, but starting this thread so the content can be discussed. --- Barek ( talk • contribs ) - 02:06, 27 April 2011 (UTC)
 Without any sourcing I don&apos;t see that there&apos;s much to discuss, personally. If it is sourced, then I would agree that unless there&apos;s a significant amount of third-party discussion of this person, it&apos;s not notable enough to merit inclusion and possibly would be undue weight. Now if they were the youngest person ever to be a franchisee of anything, that might merit further attention....but then, there&apos;d probably be significant sourcing to go along with that.
