Wichita, KS 67037
United States of America When I moved to Wichita, Kansas in 1998 I was 18 and had $100. Today I am 28 years old. I am no longer homeless. In fact, I live in a nice home in a decent neighborhood. I am a business major with the University of Phoenix (online). I have a son who is four years old and two step-children, ages 8 and 6. I have a wonderful fiance and have stayed at home with the kids for 5 years now while she has focused on her career.
I am now ready to enter the Wichita work force; unfortunately I am not having much luck in finding employment. I am not surprised that finding work is very difficult. Being homeless made holding any job very hard. Therefore, I have an unstable work history and virtually no business references to cite. I have now been turned down for employment by more than one fast food establishment.

Given how difficult finding work is for myself; getting a job must be even harder for those who are still without a home. I do believe Wichita wants to help their homeless community. As a former homeless person I can say with confidence that shelters are not the answer. There are roughly 500 homeless individuals in the Wichita area. If we can provide each of these people with a studio apartment and an entry-level job, many of those people will find success through their own hard work.

We are nearly done with our new Downtown Arena. The Kansas Coliseum used to and may still employ inmates from the Winfield Correctional Facility. Surely if convicted felons can be employed by an arena the homeless can as well. Perhaps the homeless could be employed by the city to remove trash from our streets and other public areas.

The Wichita homeless community affects everyone in the city. As long as we continue to act like homelessness is not an issue in Wichita it will remain a problem. The future job market may well get worse before it gets better. This trend could easily lead to more homeless Wichitans; regular people who cannot catch a break. The aircraft companies have already laid-off thousands. All of these people are now competing with unskilled workers for unskilled labor positions.

Therefore, the unskilled laborer is at a distinct disadvantage in finding work. I know because I am currently an unskilled laborer who cannot find work in the Wichita area. Even the fast-food establishments have become quite selective in whom they choose to hire. Historically, when the formal economy falters, the informal economy thrives. The informal economy usually refers to the laborers who work &quot;under-the-table&quot; or tax-free.

Without people willing to remodel their homes, make nonessential repairs and beautify their yards even the informal economy make take a hit. With nothing left to resort to, the criminal black market in our area will increase in influence. This will lead to more robberies, more drug dealers and more retail theft. Already rising copper prices have led to increased copper theft; a crime that can virtually destroy a small business.

I do not claim to have all the solutions to these potential problems but I do know we need to be proactive in our approach. If we wait until the politicians decide to act, it may well be too late.

Mike -

I applaud your coming forward to speak on behalf of those less fortunate than yourself. Your eloquence just goes to show that we should not judge a man by his circumstance, or home.

You may be the spark that can change a city. May your efforts be blessed.
