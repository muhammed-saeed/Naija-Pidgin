How to Calculate Table Turnover Rate for a Startup Restaurant
 by Chirantan Basu, Demand Media 

 
Restaurants make profits when they can seat as many people as they can through the day and when the patrons order higher-priced items. Customers sitting at your tables for hours, working away at their laptops and ordering nothing but coffee take up valuable space where you could seat several other parties ordering potentially more expensive menu items. You want your table turnover to be as high as possible to generate higher revenues, while providing customers with a pleasant dining experience. The table turnover rate measures how often parties occupy your tables during a measurement period.
 
Step 1

Select a measurement period. For example, you may want to measure the table turnover rate during certain meal periods, such as breakfast and dinner, or particular periods during the week, such as weeknights, to increase the revenues during those periods.
 
Step 2

Count the number of parties served at each table during the measurement period. Customers sit at a table, order, eat, pay and leave the restaurant. You clean the table and seat the next party. The more often you can do this for each table, the higher your revenue.
 
Step 3

Divide the number of parties served by the number of tables to calculate the table turnover rate. For example, if you have five tables in your restaurant and you serve 20 parties over the lunch hour, then your table turnover rate is 4 turns per table during the lunch hour. Larger tables may have lower turnover rates because it takes longer to serve more people and because you may have fewer larger parties visit your restaurant. An upscale restaurant may have a lower turnover rate than a fast-food restaurant because of differences in preparing and serving the food.
 
Tips

 The seat turnover rate is the ratio of customers served to the number of restaurant seats. The table turnover rate may be higher than the seat turnover rate for certain measurement periods depending on the party size and the number of seats per table. For example, if your tables seat four people and you seat mostly parties of two, you will seat more parties but fill fewer seats. In an April 2010 CNN Living article, writer Sarah LeTrent suggests several different ways to improve the table turnover rate. Loud music generally encourages people to eat faster, as do uncomfortable chairs and tables located in the middle of the restaurant floor.
