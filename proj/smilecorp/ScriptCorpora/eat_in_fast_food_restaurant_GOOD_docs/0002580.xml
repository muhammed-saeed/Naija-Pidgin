 NAPLES —
A 17-year-old San Carlos Park boy found hiding in a Dumpster has been arrested in connection with an attempted robbery of two people outside a fast food restaurant.

Deputies also found a gun that is believed to have been stolen from the boy’s house.

Dustin Allen Pastre, of the 18000 block of Doral Drive, Fort Myers, was charged Friday by Lee deputies with robbery with a firearm. He was sent to the Department of Juvenile Justice’s holding center.

According to a Lee County Sheriff’s Office arrest report:

Alvin Davila, 35, and Bonnie Newton, 28, whose addresses weren’t listed, told deputies that about 2 a.m. they purchased some food from a fast food restaurant in the 7100 block of Constitution Boulevard in San Carlos Park.

Newton told deputies she and Davila were sitting on a bridge eating and a vehicle pulled up. A boy got out of the car, described as a gold-colored sport utility vehicle, and asked her for a cigarette.

She said she had none and he asked for change and said “that he was out robbing people” and lifted up his shirt, displaying a gun. a report said.

He walked back to the vehicle and left.

An arriving deputy saw the vehicle and stopped it near the fast food restaurant. The driver, who was identified only as being born in 1990, turned off the vehicle’s headlights and “immediately put both hands out the window without being told to do so.”

In the meantime, Davila said he saw Pastre, who was not in the car when the deputy pulled it over, walking around while the deputy had the driver of the vehicle pulled over.

Newton said she saw the boy walk around the other side of the fast food restaurant, drop a gun in the bushes and hide in the garbage area.

The gun, a .44 caliber revolver, was recovered next to a flag and the restaurant’s playground, according to sheriff’s reports.

Deputies went to Pastre’s house to talk about a handgun that may have been stolen. No one was home, but several doors were ajar and a screen door was laying on the ground. A third door was forced open. The deputy went into the house and saw several items thrown around a bedroom.

Another deputy spoke later in the day with the homeowners, who said a handgun was missing. It matched the one used in the robbery.
