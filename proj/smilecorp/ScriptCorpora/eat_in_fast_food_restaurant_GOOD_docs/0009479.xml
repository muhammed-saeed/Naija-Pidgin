 Sharing Bedrooms

Sometimes, due to the family budget, it becomes necessary for siblings to share a bedroom. While it can be a hard adjustment for those who have never had to do it before, it can be very beneficial in developing social skills.

When your children have to learn how to communicate, and to share a space, they will develop new skills in communication, negotiation, and finding solutions. This can be a little rough at first, but over time, they will progress, and they will be able to have a better relationship with each other.

One of the funnest ways that this can begin, is for them to work together to design a theme for their bedroom. Being able to both have aspects that they like, that are brought together in the room for an overall theme can help bring harmony to the relationship as well. When they see that they are both invested in the decor, it can help them feel like they are on the same team.

This works well for both boys and girls. Finding common interests can make it a lot easier, but even if there are not any in common, being able to blend favorite colors together is a great start.

Some people have very fond memories of sharing a room with their sibling. They will often recall them later whenever their is an opportunity to discuss what they did when they were younger.

While sharing a bedroom may not be ideal, it is a situation that grows on many people, and helps them to develop a positive relationship with each other.

 Decorating With Purple

Purple was the color of royalty. The various shades can create a variety of atmospheres from the bold, to the subtle. When it comes to decorating with purples, you want to decide what the overall theme is going to be.

If your theme is going to be more modern and contemporary, then you want to use the more bolder shades of purples. Being able to find contemporary furniture pieces is easy. If you need to, you can always paint or upholster the piece in the shade of purple that you wish.

If the theme of your choice is more classy and elegant, then you want to choose the shades of purple that are deeper, like a wine or burgundy. There are some great plums as well, that look great in satin, or other sheen fabrics. Choosing fabric with a pattern that is elegant and creating pillow covers, is a fast way to create elegance in a room. Adding on tassels, jewels, and braided rope onto the pillows can take them over the top.

When it comes to using purple in a more delicate theme, you want to consider lavender, and light violet. Using real flowers that are in these shades can help set the mood in the room. You can go with a more country manor feeling, or even just the theme of a romantic summer day.

There are many options when it comes to using purple as your main color choice for your interior decor design. Being able to express yourself this way through artist expression, can be fun.

 How To Buy A House Without The Bank

A lot of people want to be a homeowner, but they have a hard time getting the bank to get them a loan. There can be a lot of reasons for this. They could have struggled with medical bills in the past, they may have gone through a period of unemployment, or they own their own business, and the income fluctuates each month.

There are many reasons people are turned down for loans. Some properties are also turned down for conventional loans as well, and so many possibilities that someone may be denied a loan.

Many people are able to buy a home without using the bank. If the seller is willing to carry the contract, then you can buy a home.

Each situation is different. Some seller’s want at least 20% down, while others just want to know that you will be able to cover the payment and just want out of the property. The length of the contract and the percentage of the interest rate is also different for each situation.

It is a good idea to still use the services of a Realtor if you can, so that you can negotiate terms that you are happy with, as well as have another set of eyes to go over the contract, and point out anything that you need to be aware of. Seller financing, also called owner finance is a great way to become a homeowner without having to deal with the requirements or restrictions of a bank.

 Putting Food on the Table 
 
This should be ingrained in your brain as deep as your neutrons can possibly go, because in this day and age—in this little world floating around the big universe—you absolutely have to remember this as a crucial part of your life….

 Be proud .

What does that mean? Just be happy? No, not necessarily. It simply means that you need to be proud of what you have, what you do, what you will do. If you’re a lower-class citizen and you bust your butt 10-12 hours a day working at a factory or clothing store or even a fast food restaurant, know that in order for you to survive, you have to be proud .

You’re putting food on the table. You’re doing with what you’re able. There’s no shame in it. Even if you’re a single mother working in a strip joint, no one—not one single person—can judge you. You’re taking care of your kids the only way you know how at the moment.

You don’t need to make a million. All you need to do is be thankful that you’re working. So many are either not thankful (because they despise their jobs) or aren’t working at all! Don’t be any of those people. Sure, you may not get a lot of the nice things out there—a nice house, a nice car, weekend trips, maybe even a cool smartphone. But it doesn’t matter….

Your family does. You do. Lower class still means you have‘class.’So…. Never be ashamed.
