     History 
 
 
 Ray Kroc, at 52 years old, invested his entire life savings to become the exclusive distributor of a milk shake maker called the Multimixer. Hearing about the McDonald&apos;s hamburger stand in California owned by Dick&amp;Mac McDonald running eight Multimixers at a time, he packed up his car and headed West. It was 1954. Ray Kroc had never seen so many people served so quickly. He pitched the idea of opening up several restaurants to the McDonald brothers, convinced that he could sell eight of his Multimixers to each and every one. &quot;Who could we get to open them for us?&quot; Dick McDonald said. Well,&quot; Kroc answered, &quot;what about me?&quot; Ray Kroc opened the Des Plaines, Illinois restaurant in 1955 and never looked back. In 1965 McDonald&apos;s went public with the company&apos;s first offering on the stock exchange. In 1967, the first McDonald&apos;s restaurant outside the United States opened in Richmond, British Columbia. In 1968, the Big Mac®sandwich was introduced, followed by the Egg McMuffin®breakfast sandwich in 1973. Milestones and accomplishments have followed ever since. Today, there are tens of thousands of McDonald&apos;s restaurants serving millions of people daily around the world. The incredible growth and success of McDonald&apos;s can be summed up with the first thought that went through Ray Kroc&apos;s mind when he first saw McDonald&apos;s: &quot;This will go anyplace.&quot; 
 
 
 Timeline 
 
 
 1937: Brothers Dick and Mac McDonald open a hot dog stand called The Airdrome at the airport in Monrovia, California. 1940: The brothers move The Airdrome building to Downe, California, where they open the first McDonald&apos;s restaurant, on U.S. Route 66, at 14th and E St., on May 15. Its menu consists of 25 items, mostly barbecue. As was common at the time, they employed around 20 carhops. It became a popular and highly profitable teen hangout. 1948: After noting that almost all of their profits came from hamburgers, the brothers closed the restaurant for several months to implement their innovative &quot;Speedee Service System&quot;, a streamlined assembly line for hamburgers. The carhops are fired, and when the restaurant reopens it sells only hamburgers, milkshakes, and french fries. At 15 cents, the burgers are about half as expensive as at standard diners, and they are served immediately. The restaurant is extremely successful, and its fame is spread by word of mouth. 1953: The McDonald brothers begin to franchise their restaurant, with Neil Fox the first franchisee. The second McDonald&apos;s opens in Phoenix, Arizona at N.Central Ave and Indian School Road. It is the first to feature the Golden Arches design; later this year the original restaurant is rebuilt in the same style. 1953: Third McDonald&apos;s restaurant opens in Saginaw, Michigan at the corner of State Street and N. Center Road, it is rebuilt in 2006 but stays at that location since opening. 
 1953: Fourth McDonald&apos;s restaurant opens, in Downey, California at the corner of Lakewood Blvd and Florence Avenue, and is the oldest McDonald&apos;s restaurant still in operation.[citation needed] 
 1954: Entrepreneur and milkshake-mixer salesman Ray Kroc becomes fascinated by the McDonald&apos;s restaurant during a sales visit, when he learns of its extraordinary capacity and popularity. Others who had visited the restaurant and come away inspired were James McLamore, founder of Burger King, and Glen Bell, founder of Taco Bell. After seeing the restaurant in operation, Kroc approaches the McDonald brothers, who have already begun franchising, with a proposition to let him franchise McDonald&apos;s restaurants outside the company&apos;s homebase of California and Arizona, with himself as the first franchisee. Kroc works hard to sell McDonald&apos;s. He even attempts to prevail on his wartime acquaintance with Walt Disney, in the failed hope of opening a McDonald&apos;s at the soon-to-be-opened Disneyland. 1955 : Ray Kroc founds &quot;McDonald&apos;s Systems, Inc.&quot; on March 2, as a legal structure for his planned franchises. Kroc opens the ninth McDonald&apos;s restaurant in Des Plaines, Illinois, in suburban Chicago on April 15. The first day&apos;s revenues are $366.12. The company&apos;s literature usually refers to this date as the &quot;beginning&quot; of the company, then already 15 years old, writing the McDonald brothers out of its history in favor of &quot;Founder&quot; Kroc. The company still refers to this restaurant as &quot;McDonald&apos;s #1&quot;. In July, Ray Kroc opens his second McDonald&apos;s restaurant in Fresno, California, operated by Art Bender, Kroc&apos;s first subfranchisee. The Fresno site is referred to as &quot;first McDonald&apos;s restaurant franchised by Ray Kroc&quot; on a plaque on the site, which is later rebuilt to resemble the 1950s-style restaurants. 1955: Ray Kroc hires Harry J. Sonneborn as his Chief Financial Officer. Sonneborn remained a key influence in the McDonald&apos;s corporation till his resignation in 1967. 1955: Ray Kroc hires Fred Turner (later CEO and Chairman) as a grillman in his store in Des Plaines.
 1958: McDonald&apos;s worldwide sells its 100 millionth hamburger.
 1959: The 100th McDonald&apos;s restaurant opens in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin.
 1959: McDonald&apos;s begins billboard advertising.
 1960: Kroc&apos;s company is renamed &quot;McDonald&apos;s Corporation&quot;.
 1961: The McDonald brothers agree to sell Kroc business rights to their operation for $2.7 million, a sum that Kroc borrows from a number of investors, including Princeton University; Kroc considers the sum extreme, and it strains his relationship with the brothers. In a handshake agreement, the brothers would also receive an overriding royalty of 1% on the gross sales. At the closing table the brothers told Ray that they were giving the real estate and rights to the original unit to the founding employees. Ray closed the transaction, then refused to acknowledge the royalty portion of the agreement because it wasn&apos;t in writing. The brothers keep their original restaurant, but in an oversight they fail to retain the right to remain a McDonald&apos;s franchise. Renamed &quot;The Big M&quot;, Kroc drives it out of business by opening a McDonald&apos;s just one block north; he attends the opening. Had the brothers maintained their original agreement, which granted them 0.5% of the chain&apos;s annual revenues, they or their heirs would have been collecting in excess of $100 million per year today. Had the brothers closed their handshake agreement with Ray, these royalties would have doubled. 1961: Hamburger University opens in the basement of the Elk Grove Village, Illinois, McDonald&apos;s restaurant Bachelor of Hamburgology degrees went to graduating class of 15. 1962: McDonald&apos;s first national magazine ad appears in Life magazine.
 1962: The first McDonald&apos;s restaurant with seating opens in Denver, Colorado.
 1963: One of Kroc&apos;s marketing insights is his decision to advertise McDonald&apos;s hamburgers to families and children. Washington, D.C. franchisees John Gibson and Oscar Goldstein (Gee Gee Distributing Corporation) sponsor a children&apos;s show on WRC-TV called Bozo the Clown, a franchised character played by Willard Scott from 1959 until 1962. After the show was cancelled, Goldstein hires Scott to portray McDonald&apos;s new mascot, named Ronald McDonald. According to Scott, they wanted to pay him in stock, but Scott decided to take the money. Scott, looking nothing like the familiar appearance of any McDonaldland character as is known today, appeared in the first three television advertisements featuring the character. After changing the character&apos;s first name to &quot;Ronald&quot; and replacing Scott with a new actor, and giving him the more familiar red, white, and yellow clown features, the character eventually spreads to the rest of the country via an advertising campaign. Years later, an entire cast of &quot;McDonaldland&quot; characters is developed. 1963: The Filet-O-Fish is introduced in Cincinnati, Ohio, in a restaurant located in a neighborhood dominated by Roman Catholics who practiced abstinence (the avoidance of meat) on Fridays. It is the first new addition to the original menu, and goes national the following year, with fish supplied by Gorton&apos;s of Gloucester.
