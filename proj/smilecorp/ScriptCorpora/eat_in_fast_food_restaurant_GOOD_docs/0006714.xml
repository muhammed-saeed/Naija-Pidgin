 Al Fredo di Roma 

 
Serving gourmet Italian and Mexican fare, this new addition is quickly becoming popular. 

A local owner and chef swears he will go broke from eating there so often. 

Their pasta is reasonable, and we are told it is outstanding.

 Al Pie del Carbon 

 
Now this is a genuine grill! Open flame cooking over real wooden logs.

Grilled veggie on skewers and true Argentinean beef. The grilled fish is also a treat and at a great price.

 Albino&apos;s 

 
Albino&apos;s is a breath of fresh air, the food is exquisite and so is the service.

You will not be disappointed.

It&apos;s not on the main street but is well worth the detour.

If you want a &quot;local&quot; restaurant away from all the tourist joints, you will have a great experience.

 Ambars 

 
Serving gourmet Italian fare in a romantic setting on the terrace. 

Nice place for that special date.

 Asadero El Pollo 

 
Yummy grilled chicken with bags of rice, salsa, onions and lots of corn tortillas.

They close when they run out of chicken... it can be as early as 3pm or as late as 7pm.

Prices are inexpensive and the chicken is grilled over a wood burning fire.

 Blue Angel Restaurant 

 
The food here is absolutely excellent. 

The chimichanga and chili rellenos  are outstanding. 

Breakfast offers Mexican and American dishes plus the staff accommodates special requests. 

Lunch has a selection of authentic Mexican dishes as well as North American style sandwiches and burgers.

In addition to the dinner menu, the restaurant offers theme nights. 

There are not many restaurants in Cozumel that offer such great ocean views.

 Bob&apos;s Cozumel 

 
Visit this great place for one of the biggest beers on the island or one of their other refreshing signature adult beverages.

Be sure and try the (quickly becoming) famous Italian Melt sandwich with a side of homemade fresh daily Pasta Salad, you won&apos;t be sorry you did!
