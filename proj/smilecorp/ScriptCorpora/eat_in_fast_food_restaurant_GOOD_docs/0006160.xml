View Full Version : Life of a recovering Drama Queen 
 Thorn 07-19-2003, 12:03 PM Hello, my name is Thorn and I&apos;m a Drama Queen.

I&apos;ve had this problem since I was a teenager and I&apos;ve been keeping it under control since then. In my early 20s, my addiction got the better of me and I was a basket case. Now in my mid-30s, I am drama-free!

But every once in a while...I fall off the wagon.

Usually it is someone else&apos;s drama though - drama by proxy. Luckily, I work with a couple of people who can supply me with a steady supply of the needed drug. One of them is single (Dog) and one of them is recently married (Noob).

Recently Noob&apos;s husband&apos;s ex-girlfriend showed up at their house. The husband (Jacko) wasn&apos;t home. Noob had no idea why this person was there and subsequently freaked out. The ex informed Noob that she wrote Jacko a letter and left it at the house. When Jacko got home, Noob nailed him to the wall. Suddenly Jacko&apos;s secret internet time at 2am, made sense. His multiple and secret email accounts - suspect! The fact that Jacko kept the letter with him at all times and wrote the ex&apos;s phone # and email address on the envelope, did not help his cause. This two days after he bashed the bumper of her new car (she hadn&apos;t even paid one payment yet) Drama all around!!!

Ah yes...my fix.

All day long we agonized over the Noob situation. We talked to her. We talked about her. We emailed. We listened. We offered advice (Dog&apos;s advice is crap btw). We commiserated. We thanked whatever force we worship that it is not us. If they sort it out over the weekend, we&apos;re sunk. Thorn 07-19-2003, 12:31 PM So what about me?

In a nutshell I&apos;m a professional woman in the computer industry, in my mid 30s, 5&apos;9&quot;tall, 160lbs, dark out of control hair kind like Jim Morrison or Billy Squier&apos;s. I am married and have 2 cats and an iguana.

Things I do:
read
ride motorcycles
watch movies
drive fast
lift weights
drink beer (wine and bourbon too)
take photographs

Things I don&apos;t do:
anything involving children
drive slowly
bar hop
watch network television
watch freaking Nascar
sew
cook
ski

I&apos;ve been lurking here for a while and decided to join in. You are a twisted bunch of people. I feel at home already. Thorn 07-20-2003, 11:11 AM I was 19 years old and only had 2 boyfriends before I met The Leech. I didnt know at the time he would become The Leech. No, I was taken in by his low voice and his guitar. My first warning sign should have been the fact that he kept having to move his early 80s BMW R65 around from hiding spot to hiding spot, to avoid the repo man. Ah love is blind after all.

Ray Charles blind in fact. A few days after I became smitten, I he told me he was married. My young heart was broken and my young ire was roused.

Married?? WTF?

Were separated. I havent even seen her for weeks. He says.
So what does that mean? Why arent you divorced?
Cant afford it.

Ah. Warning sign number 2.

What else should I know about you?
I have a daughter.
Really? Oh crap.
She lives with her mother. In {neighboring state}.

Blinking red sign WARNING!

By this time, it is too late for me. His blue eyes. His letters. Yeah, he wrote me letters when I wasnt with him and gave them to me when I was. They did me in. The fact that he was living in the basement of some guys house, somehow didnt matter. Not a finished basement either. A raised bunk, bolted to the floor with old propane tanks and fishing gear beneath it. Our raft of love. Thats how little it bothered me. It was romantic, his struggle with life.

He had never been given a chance, I thought. He was an unplanned child with much older siblings and now much older parents, who had little time or patience for a new child. He couldnt go to college because his girlfriend was pregnant and they had to marry. So he chose to serve our country in the Army instead. Then the Army screwed him out of disability for his back injury it was this injury that kept him out of work; every job became a physical trial.

Yeah right. In hindsight I know this for what it was unadulterated bullshit. I know now that if there had actually been a discernable injury from his service with the Army, he would have had treatment or disability payments or both. It was just an excuse to be unemployed and feel sorry for himself. He enjoyed feeling trod upon by the world. It made him feel that his own failings werent his fault. And dont we all love that? I romanticized the hell out of it. I was the only one who understood him. I tried to save him.

Before you judge me too harshly, I must tell you that I made him get a divorce. I didnt want to be involved with a married man, no matter how separated. He did. I was flattered. I thought it meant something. Thorn 07-20-2003, 11:16 AM I worked one shit job after another and finally we got a place of our own, and no longer had to make love beneath a room full of rowdy drunks. Soon after, he quit his job. I felt strong and responsible. He said he was looking for work. I paid the bills. He asked for money. I told him it had to be for gas and not for cigarettes. He spent it on pot instead.

Screaming sirens WARNING!!!

Why did I stay? Because I would come home to find dinner made. He would sit out on the steps and play guitar and sing me love songs. He would buy me little gifts and leave them to surprise me. He wrote me love letters. He cut peaches in bed and fed them to me. He had long hair. He made up silly names for our cat. He loved his daughter. He could quote Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy and Monty Python. He didnt name his penis.

One day, when I was home alone, his now ex-wife showed up in a lather. Furiously, she pounded on the door demanding to see him. When I opened up she charged in, shouting about child support and where the fuck was it. We fought. She left. I slammed the door. Glass shattered.

Flashing lights, screaming sirens, guy hitting me with a baseball bat WARNING!!!!!!!

Shortly after this lovely episode, he was gone for an entire night. I knew what he was doing. He was out at his buddys place getting stoned. The Leech turned into an asshole when he was stoned. You know how it affects people differently, but mostly for the better? Not this guy. He became rude, patronizing and stupid when he was stoned. The man I loved simply disappeared to be replaced by this loud, boorish idiot. He was gone a lot.

We split. It was awful. Although I can barely remember it now, my diary of the time is positively drenched in tears as I poured out my broken, battered 20-year-old soul.

After a while I dated. I remember one man telling me that I really shouldnt talk about my ex quite so much. That it made him feel like he could never compete or measure up. After that I was quiet about him. I healed.

Then, almost 2 years later, a letter came. Thorn 07-21-2003, 06:50 PM A letter from The Leech. Even though he had disappointed me and broken my heart, I still thought of him as My One. This was the reason all my subsequent relationships were shallow, surface affairs that I never took seriously. Sure, I liked the men I dated. I laughed with them. I slept with them and shared many parts of my life, but I never let any of them get close. One wanted to marry me, but I said no.

So now I had a letter. From The Leech. He was sorry. He was lonely. He was unfulfilled in love. He wanted to see me. He wanted me back. He wanted to try again. Hed changed.

My heart soared. It was as if I could fly. My whole being felt lighter. I was flooded in joy. Awash in my own wonderful, irresistible self.

For about two minutes.

Then my brain managed to get a word in.

What do you think youre doing? This man used you and ignored you and was not a good partner to you. Are you nuts? That was over years ago.

There were instructions in the letter, how to get in touch with him. He had moved to a city north of where we used to live. Just moved and had no phone yet. I was to meet him at a coffee shop in town. At dusk. Can you picture it? You can smell the coffee, right? See the lowering light and the rosy glow in the clouds as the day unwinds? You can feel that sparkly, electric tingling in your fingers cant you? The one you get when after a long absence, you see the person you love and desire above all others. When you cant quite catch your breath and your lower abdomen feels like its plummeting to the earths core.

You look amazing. Tears in his eyes.

I was gone. But I had to at least pantomime a good fight. We would only talk. We would not touch. To touch would mean instant surrender. Thorn 07-21-2003, 06:57 PM We walked after coffee. It was two blocks to his apartment. We came to a dimly lit cemetery on the right. The dramatic lighting set off my ankle length black leather coat to advantage. I had the power. I could accept or reject. I could lift him out of the mire of his own making and set him on the path to happiness. Or I could crush him under my heel and damn him to hell forever. Glorious.

I leaned on tombstones and threw words at him. Memories. Invectives. Accusations. I posed beneath streetlights and hurled questions. Why? How?

He drops the bomb.

Hes married.

What??? Again???

Yes, apparently. This is getting to be like a broken record. I am stunned. I cant fucking believe it. He married again. Im speared by my own jealousy. How could he do this to me? The memory of me? Damn him.

No kids this time, so theres something.

I head for my car, taking long, determined strides, my footsteps echoing. He follows.

Can I explain?
Not now. Dont. Im still walking, keys at the ready; my car.
Can I see you again? He asks, crouched by the window.
I dont know. Window goes up. Reverse. The last thing I see is him in my rear view mirror, lit by my taillights. Thorn 07-21-2003, 07:30 PM A few days later, he called. My mother answers and gives me the look. She drilled me with questions when I arrived home from my meeting with the Leech. She knows how I feel, but hopes I will use my head.

I agree to have dinner with him. An Italian hole-in-the-wall near his apartment. The meal was expensive. Handmade pasta. Wine. Cappuccino. I knew he couldnt afford it. I wanted him to make penance. Punitive damages.

He tells me she has filed for divorce already. They were only married a year. She is an artist and couldnt live out here. She wanted to move. He didnt. She couldnt leave without her Utrex. I vilified her in my mind. Looking back, I realize she was more like me than I could have realized. Poor girl. I knew what she must have gone through. The nights alone. The lack of money. The excuses. Oh yeah, but Ill bet he sent her letters too.

A few days later, he asked me to come see him so we could talk. I agreed. This time at his apartment. we sat outside on his second story porch, hidden in the branches of a huge maple. Light and shadow playing on our faces and hands. It was hard to resist. He was so earnest in his desire to resurrect Us. He was working; had been for months. He was sending child support for his daughter. He hadnt smoked pot in weeks.

I let him take my hands in his and lie to me again. I believed what I heard. The apartment wasnt a showplace, but at least it was clean and at least it was his. He had a car and was fixing up an old Triumph Tiger. He still had his old Gibson. I wouldnt let him play it then.

Two nights later we went to bed. It was incredible. This man knew me so well. Knew my body and how to make me love it, to make me revel in it. Our tears mingled on our skin and dried in the morning air.

From this distance, I cant remember why he had to move from that apartment to a much more squalid one a few streets away. It was a greasy little hole on the first floor. I found out most of the furniture in the old apartment belonged with it, so there was precious little to move to the new digs. And only my car to move it with his disappeared somewhere along the way and he only had the Tiger left. He bought a futon to put on the floor. His struggle was noble. He joined a band and played music. I adored him. I adopted a cat that I kept at his apartment. We were a family. Thorn 07-22-2003, 06:49 PM After a while, we decided to move in together. I think it was an act of kindness and stupidity on my part. I desperately wanted things to work and knew how impossible it would be for us to continue as Us, with him rooming with some guy, I thought we should live together instead. It was delusional, I know. It was putting myself in the role of savior/provider/mother that I should have avoided at all costs. Too bad I didnt have some kind of cosmic warning about the fights we would have about how I emasculated him.

We found a place and settled in. Things were ok. I think we fought so much because the making up was so sweet. The thing I recall most about this relationship was that it was never on an even keel. Nope, either things were so blissful that I felt like I was glowing all the time and I felt smug and complete and in my destined groove. Or things were black and terrible and I could only think of a murder/suicide as the way out. Ahhh love.

But in a twisted way, this became normal. We had virtually the same fight (his lack of steady employment and money and my subsequently having all responsibility) over and over. I remember once he bitched at me about how I was spending money. My money. That was ironic. He alternately made me feel like a shrewish fishwife or his angel come to save him from his wreck of a life. Neither was what I deserved to be. Neither was what I ought to be. These were just convenient roles in which to cast me so that he could escape his own responsibility. If he would have just behaved like an adult, we wouldnt have had things to fight about.

I called him at work one day and found out he hadnt been employed there in almost 2 weeks. I called home and he answered. He offered a lame reason for being home at that hour, and didnt mention that he was no longer employed.

When I got home we fought about it. His lying and deceit about the job angered me in the way only a person working a shit job can get angry. I was suffering at a crappy job, for crappy wages and he couldnt do the same? WTF??!! But his reason was unassailable his back injury. And hey he was picking up odd jobs for our landlord in return for reduced rent, so he wasnt totally slacking off. Ever the idiot, I forgave. Oh and could he have $20?

This pattern repeated itself along with the patterns of our earlier days. I worked. He smoked. I paid. He borrowed. I stayed home. He left. I cried. We fought. Once we threw things. He could not grow up. He was convinced that the world owed him a living. He didnt understand that it doesnt and never has and never will.

One day I came home to a long letter saying that he was moving in with his friend so that he could be autonomous. Just which dictionary he got that word out of, I dont know, but it wasnt English. I raged. I threw things and screamed until my throat was raw, my voice hoarse and I could barely see. I drove over there and we had it out. Cringing, his friend left us to it, but feared we would hurt each other. Later he told me that he expected to return to one of us bleeding or dead. Thorn 07-22-2003, 06:53 PM The Leech and I agreed to remain a couple, but live apart. It was painful, but little did I know then that it would be the best way to get him out of my system for good. You see, the love began dying with that separation. We were apart, but I could still cling to the scraps and get on with my life. This was in September and in October I had a new apartment, a new job (a good job with a future for once!) and a new car (an actual new car, not a used one like the piece of shit I had been driving).

My life was taking a very positive turn. I saw The Leech less and less. I could tell my separate and independent living space made him nervous and ashamed. The fact that I could actually see this was a miracle. His emotional hold over me was broken and I was seeing him clearly for the first time. He was beginning to piss me off. He told me that my job was easy and was handed to me because I was young and pretty. With a sneer, he refused my offer to drive my new car. He thought my lifting weights would make me too manly. Disapproval fairly oozed from him. As if he could talk.

Finally on Christmas Eve, I called him to say that our plans were still kind of touch and go with my family because my Auntie was having a difficult time. She was in the stage of renal failure where home dialysis becomes ineffectual, and hospitalization more and more frequent. At this, The Leech exploded in anger. So did I. That was it. The love bond we had for 5 years was broken. Really in that instant I hated him. He disgusted me in his selfishness towards a dying woman that he knew I loved dearly. Fuck him and his attitude. I did not need this.

I told him that we were done, that I would come get my motorcycle and anything else I had at his place and return anything he had at mine. He shouted that it would be fine with him. The next day he called as if nothing had changed. It took a while for him to believe me. For once, I think I truly surprised him.

The trade of goods is always a difficult thing. Ours was ugly. Every time we agreed to meet, Id show up and he wouldnt. He didnt want to give me my bike. He said it wasnt finished yet and that I wouldnt be able to ride or maintain it without him. He had a point it was a Triumph after all. So, I told him he could keep it if I could get the money back I paid for it. That was a laugh, and I knew it. He didnt have money for a cup of coffee, much less a motorcycle. So he told me he would give me his old Honda CVCC instead. I didnt need the car, but it could be sold. I got $500 for it. More than I paid for the Triumph.

After that, my life changed. The new job opened up opportunities and I earned more money than I ever thought I would. I made new friends. The self-confidence that had eroded during my time with The Leech, returned in full force. 3 months later, I met my husband. We clicked instantly. I told him all about The Leech and some things that happened with him and with others that I havent mentioned here. He told me of his past. We fell head over heels in love. We moved in together and had only one fight in 7 years. That still stands.

Then one day, a letter came. Thorn 07-23-2003, 11:19 AM Seven years. It is estimated that the average person will replace every cell in their bodies in seven years. Literally and figuratively, I was a different person from the one The Leech left all those years ago. Still, he sent me a letter. Actually, he put it in my parents mailbox because he didnt know where I lived (notice that I didnt say he mailed it to my parents, he drove to the box and put it in, cheap bastard). My mom begged me to let her open it and read it to me she was burning with curiosity. No way was I going to agree to that. A couple of days later, I went to get it.

Sowhat did the letter say? Literally speaking, it said that he was constantly thinking about me. He bitterly regretted letting me go (twice). That he has never since known a love like mine and probably never will. That he hoped I was happy. That whenever he heard a certain sappy love song, he felt like crying. Between the lines however, he was fishing. It was pretty obvious.

At first I was highly flattered. I cannot deny the huge ego boost. This man still wanted me. This man regretted making me leave. He pined for me. All riiiight. Vindication. Take that you asshole! I hope you writhe in misery for the rest of your sorry life. I wanted to flaunt my life in front of him. My happiness. To show him that I had achieved the life I wanted; without him. In a more crass and cruel way, I wanted to show him the material possessions I had, the ones he would be seriously envious of.

Then I was pissed. The overall tone of the letter was arrogant and in a way, dismissive. Id have to actually dig it out to quote it, but trust me, it was. What a load of horseshit. As if I would be interested in him after all these years. After what happened. Give me a break. There was an address to which to reply. I havent. That was 3 years ago.

Did I tell my husband? Yup. And we had a huge laugh over it. Mostly where I egged him on to challenge the Leech to a duel and fight over my favors! Pistols at dawn! Swords at midnight. Hubby would kick his ass.

So that&apos;s my big drama in a nutshell (many mini-dramas left out). Thanks for reading. Feel free to PM comments. Thorn 07-23-2003, 07:21 PM So what to do for an encore? Hmmmcasts about for more drama.

Oh, I know. My first date with my husband.

Well, second actually if you count a quick trip to trade a machine gun for a motorcycle. Butthe second date. He decided he would make me dinner at his house (OMG a man with a house now THATS a change huh??). I agreed to bring dessert (ok you pervs in the audience, stop getting ahead of me already!).

You know how sometimes its the little weird coincidences and similarities that make you really click with someone? I had one of those moments in his kitchen. On the fridge, held by weird fish magnets, were some of my favorite Calvin and Hobbes cartoons ever. You know the one where Susie and Calvin are at the lunch table and Calvin asks her whats for lunch Cigar butts in gallstone sauce? and she yells Its beanie weenies! And the one where she tells him not to tell her about his lunch because its always something revolting Its not my lunch thats gross, its my dessert. Look! A thermos full of phlegm! And the one where he offers her something out of his thermos with the tempting line I went to all the windows in the house and collected dead bugs, then I mashed them into a gooey paste. I call it Bug Butter, care for a taste? Well, he had all of these on his fridge and oh lordI was stunned. He knew. He got it. That meant he would probably get me (ok you pervs, Im getting there, just let me tell it in my own way will ya?)

So weve eaten and are settling on the couch to watch The Fugitive (yeah, its a date movie, ok?!) when I remember the berries and get them from the fridge. Then he pops us and says that he forgot something, too. Down to the basement he goes and comes back with are you ready for this???? Dom Perignon.

I. shit. you. not.

I was blown away. We talked through most of the movie and when 4am rolled around, we gave in to our sluttish ways. We screwed six ways from Sunday until we were dehydrated and sore. It was great.

So here we are, 9 years later. Its great. I look back at my early 20s in wonder that I ever could have come out of them the kind of woman my husband could love. I think the teens and twenties are the hardest years. Most experiences are new. Most situations are new. Everything is changing. Hormones are raging. Everything seems to be magnified all out of proportion. I look back now from my much better 30s and think how much wasted energy I poured into things that seemed important at the time, but which I can barely remember now, or have completely forgotten. At the time if someone had said this to me, I would have laughed until I cried.

So now, when am having trouble with perspective, I always ask myself if this particular thing will matter in 10 years. If I say yes, I put energy towards it. If I say no, I dont put much.

Oh shit that got really preachy at the end there, didnt it? Sorry. Thorn 07-24-2003, 02:57 PM Lately, I&apos;ve been feeling pretty harried at work. My boss was recently let go, so anything that he used to do to help me out with my work, I do myself now. In the normal course of my duties, I have to conduct trainings 5 times a quarter. I just got a bunch of feedback forms from the attendees.

I rock.

That&apos;s the consensus. That I&apos;m awesome. I know my shit. I&apos;m a great presenter. Oh yeah. I can feel the love.

Not only did I get in a great chest and biceps workout, but now this. Sometimes life is good. Thorn 07-24-2003, 07:10 PM Clearly, the novelty has not worn off yet.


As a woman in my 30s, I am often asked if I have kids. When I say no, I get the look. That instant look of pity/concern/wonder at my answer. It happens in an instant, and most people don&apos;t even know they&apos;re doing it. That doesn&apos;t make it less insulting though. Why assume this is bad, or worse, assume that there is something wrong with me? I am childfree not childless. I do not need your pity, nor your scorn.

This is different than it was in my 20s. Back then, people were constantly telling me that I would change my mind someday. Condecensing, patronizing, assholes! I&apos;m 35 now and am even more convinced than ever that kids are not for me.

I get all kinds of reasons why I should have a kid. My favorite is that the little cretin will be there to take care of me when I get old. Oh yeah. Tell that to all of the old people who are abandoned in nursing homes across the country, and never see their kids again. Or worse, get duty visits at Christmas or Mother&apos;s day. Please.

Once, I had a new mother get upset because I would not fawn all over her and her child. Instead of oohing and ahhing with the crowd of other estrogen overloading females, I chose to simply smile and go on my way. She took that as some unforgivable insult. I barely know the woman and have no desire to see the baby (in Seinfeld-ese). I found this out through a third party. Figures.

I have no yearning for or interest in children. I never have. When I was 14 I got my first real job because I couldn&apos;t stand having to babysit for my money. Whether it was environment or just me, I have never had the burning need for kids. My biological clock is a sundial. So glad I have a husband who feels the same:

&quot;How do you feel about children.&quot;I asked nervously on one of our first dates.
&quot;I hate them.&quot;
Phew. He was so perfect, I was afraid of this answer. If it was yes, I&apos;d have to let him go. No way am I becoming a breeder.

One thing I really hate about it is people calling it a miracle. I&apos;m sorry, but an event that happens a couple of thousand times a day and has done for thousands of years, is not a miracle. Dogs, rats and snakes have babies - humans are not special. Fulfilling the only biological requirement you have on earth is not an achievement in my book. Yeah, it might be a welcome and blessed event for you, but don&apos;t make it out to be some sacred, rare occurrence. And don&apos;t make it a reason to look down upon those who don&apos;t have kids.

Somewhere I read that the single most ecologically/environmentally irresponsible action a human can commit is to produce another human.

So, I have now alienated 2/3 of the people who read this. Great. :rolleyes: Thorn 07-25-2003, 04:41 PM Marriage is work.
Thats crap. If a relationship is work you dont have the right partner.

My marriage is not work. We dont have to sacrifice and compromise and make an effort to keep things together. We do not bicker. We do not argue. We do not have spats. We rarely disagree. We do not complain about each other. We do not nag.

My husband and I have had one fight in 9 years.

Honestly one fight in nine years. We like each other the way we are and dont expect the other to change. Nothing he does bugs me enough to make an issue out of it. And I suppose the reverse is true also (or I definitely would have heard about it already!).

Something in Bambookis latest post struck me that her family didnt approve of her Ex. I didnt say anything about my familys attitude towards The Leech. At the time, I think they thought he loved me but was bad for me; didnt support me well and didnt hold up his end of the partnership. But they didnt try to stop me and to this day, speak in pitying tones about him. He never deliberately tried to hurt me when we were together. The only time he did that was after our final split. He badmouthed me to some people and I heard about it. But it wasnt like him and I knew it was just emotion and spite. It hurt me at the time and made me angry, but Im not angry any more.

I dont know what it is that makes many women go after the fixer upper (great term Bambooki). I dont think I wanted to change The Leech. No, I wanted him to grow with me. I dont think I tried to force him to be anything except an adult (which was a stretch!), and I thought that would be a given.

From this experience and watching other women struggle, I learned that you cant really change anyone. That what you see is what you get so you better like it. This goes for men and women. If they are messy now, they will be messy forever. If they are forgetful now, they will be forgetful forever. If they are selfish now, they will be selfish forever. Fundamental personality traits like this are made decades before you meet that person; dont fool yourself into thinking you can do anything to effect a change. You cant. So move on and find someone who has the traits you need and value the most. You will have a happier life because of it. Thorn 07-25-2003, 06:46 PM I am so psyched. In August my husband (to be known in future as BSBG) and I are heading to Watkins Glen in NY. For those of you who arent speed freaks this is the location of a most choice racetrack. I am a track junkie.

It started innocently enough, when my local Ducati dealer invited me to come to a track day/skills school. Id been riding motorcycles for years at that time and felt pretty good about trying my skills on the track. It is instructor led with plenty of classroom learning. They also group the participants together by riding ability and experience. Most importantly, its not a race. No stopwatches allowed (for insurance reasons mostly, if its a timed event, the insurance quadruples or something, but driving schools pay less). Just you, your bike and your nerve. And of course, your adrenaline.

It was awesome. Heart-pounding and rewarding. I felt smug. I did it. And I did well. My Ducati is older, but plenty fast and a pretty good track bike (after some minor mods). I did fairly well and I also completed a race school the same summer. I dont have any intentions to race, but wanted to see what it was like. It really tests you and your machine. You learn exactly what youre capable of and what your bike is capable of. Learning the limits of ones bike is very important, but not as important as learning the limits of you.

So after a few of these over the years, BSBG and I decided to do a similar thing with the cars. This particular driving school is sponsored by the local BMW Car Club. It is organized in a similar manner to the Ducati track days classroom training plus the division of driver skill levels. The only difference is with the BMW Club, each driver has to flag as well. That means you are on the side of the track waving different flags to warn drivers should a situation occur. A lot can be learned by flagging (mostly what NOT to do).

So far Ive had 7 driving schools in my M3 and about as many on my Duc. Its always challenging and I always improve something when I go out. My instructors give me high marks. So Im ready for a new track and Watkins Glen is it. It looks great at over 3 miles with elevation changes and PLENTY of curves!! A racing friend already told me they are all late apex turns. So tough to master for a freak like me with no patience. Woo hoo! Im psyched.

Im getting some work done on the car to get ready and to make sure everything is in top condition new tires, rotors, pads and general inspection, plus a lightweight flywheel so that the engine spins faster and I dont lose so much horsepower due to the weight of the spinning mass. Ive already chipped it and put in cold air intake and a free-flow exhaust, so short of a supercharger (mmmmm Supercharger), this is as much of a hp boost as Im likely to get. Drooool. Watkins Glen, here I come!

Anywayafter all the other girlie posts, I thought Id write a manly post for you guys out there who waded through all that shit hoping for a pay off! Thorn 07-26-2003, 07:48 AM Thanks for the props in your journal Oldlady. I&apos;m blushing. :blush:

Canning - my mom used to can just the way you described it. She had a big black speckled pot of boiling water that she would lower the rack of jars into. We had a huge garden when I was a kid. Grew so much stuff sometimes, that we had to take some to the local co-op to trade (usually for carob chips. Oh how I cried over those endless carob chip cookies she made. Oh the humanity! Vile carob bean. It was probably carob and not an apple that was Eve&apos;s downfall and now the woman&apos;s curse of chocolate addiction is upon us. But I digress...) Mom canned tomatoes, peaches, relish and made the BEST bread-n-butter pickles I&apos;ve ever had. I remember pulling the little red seal tab to make sure there were no leaks. After a while, she switched to the lids with the seal built in, but when I was little, those red tabs were everywhere!

Oh and the jams she made...mmmmmm. Once, she had a failed batch of strawberry jam. Only she called it failed, the rest of us called it heaven. It had failed to gel despite her experience and prior success. It was more like strawberry chutney and was perfect for pancakes and ice cream (preferably both if we could get dad to make us pancakes!).

Don&apos;t even get me going about her applesauce!! Thorn 07-27-2003, 12:04 PM Sometimes I am convinced that we are devolving. You know, the opposite of evolving. Survival of the fittest doesnt apply to the human race anymore. We have learned to cope with and overcome genetic defects in our past, and now those genetic defects are as common as normal genes. Thats why Im not totally opposed to genetic selection for newborns.

You know what I mean if youve seen Gattaca. For those who havent, this movie takes place in some distant future where we have cracked the double helix. We can identify specific genes and what they do. With this knowledge, couples can now select the genetic make up of their child. These people will not be predisposed to diseases like diabetes or asthma or epilepsy. They will have no weight problems. They will have 20/20 vision. They will have high IQs. They will have greater physical stamina.

Birth defects and all physical and mental handicaps are a thing of the past. People not born by genetic selection are called invalids and are not allowed to go to college or to get the good white-collar jobs. Instead they are laborers and criminals. The reason is that those people have something wrong with them that will raise its ugly head eventually, and the benefits of training this person for something important will be curtailed. Basically theres no ROI in these invalids.

This sounds suspiciously like eugenics, doesnt it? Eugenics has come to signify a horrible practice where all people who are different will be eliminated. The deaf. The blind. The retarded. The nearsighted. The asthmatic. The diabetic. The diversity of people will be limited to those that fit a certain standard. People automatically think of an Aryan race of supermen. Or of a society where girls are undervalued and not chosen for conception. You know where this can go.

But that&apos;s not what eugenics is. I think of it as a return to natural selection. Thorn 07-27-2003, 12:15 PM Back when we were first developing as a species and somewhat after, people who were blind or deaf or had physical defects, didnt live. Nature selected them out. They died young and were not able to pass along their defective chromosomes. But as we became civilized, we were able to cope with these ailments and people began to survive. They passed along their genes.

If we had an apocalyptic event tomorrow, and all medical treatment was gone; how many of us are fit enough to survive? Not me. I am an asthmatic and Im severely near sighted. Without glasses, I wouldnt be able to function well. I couldnt hunt or gather or fix things or do anything effectively and would cost more to my village than I could return. Without proper medication, I will die. So at least my drain on things would be mercifully brief.

Today, the whole of mankind is pouring money and effort into curing and/or coping with diseases that should have been selected out. Think of how much energy, knowledge and money go into research for new ways to cope with the symptoms of defective genetics. Not to mention the amount of irreplacable natural resources that are going to support a population that is basically a genetic dead end.

People often use this as an argument against genetic selection. That if we had no defects to repair or diseases to cure, we would cease to learn and explore and scientific research would grind to a halt. I completely disagree. Humans are nosy to a fault. We would find something to do (like cure the common cold, find renewable energy sources, travel to other planets). When I think of how much more we would know if we werent busy trying to fix what weve made wrong with us, I nearly cry.

Some will say that this not being able to survive under these primitive circumstances is moot. That our society doesnt function that way anymore and its not necessary to be fit enough to survive outside of it. That our new society allows for existence without this kind of hardship. So what that genetically damaged people breed and further degrade the gene pool? We don&apos;t need to make the best humans we can. Our society will change to allow these people to exist.

Maybe it will. But it saddens me to know that as a viable species, humans are weakening every generation. We arent getting stronger and fitter. Were getting weaker and more defective. Me included. Only a few hundred years ago, I would have been selected out. But instead here I am, forever tied to the nearest pharmacy. Thorn 07-28-2003, 07:39 PM No weird theories to shock you with today. Thanks for reading so far. I hope I can be entertaining while I get my thoughts out.

Today was harried, but productive and fun. Had to go to another of our locations to give training this morning, and it was so nice that I decided to take the bike. Its about an hours drive but I left a little earlier and went some back roads. Ahhhperfect weather. Leisurely and not too much traffic (read minivans) to get in my way. I absolutley love twisting the throttle and zipping into the passing lane! Not that my car isn&apos;t fun, but it&apos;s not as fast as my 2-wheeled babies. I hadnt ridden this bike for ages, just rode the Ducati when I rode at all.

Reactions to women on motorcycles are still somewhat strange, even for a state that has the highest per capita motorcycle ownership in the country. A typical encounter goes like this:

Nice bike. Is it yours?
As if Id be sitting on it, or gassing it or preparing to leave on it if it werent.
Yes it is.
Its a big bike. Sometimes he will add for a woman, sometimes he just wants to.
Well, its not like I have to lift it over my head.
I guess not. Laughs. Usually compliments and/or questions about my choice of marque ensue.
Why dont you get a Harley?
Why should I get a Harley?
Because theyre unique.
Oh, you must have an interesting definition of unique. I see hundreds of them every week and only a dozen or less of this kind. Just for the record, I have a BMW and the Duc.

Sometimes they will ask me why I ride. Do they ask guys the same thing? Doubtful, they only seem to need to know why a woman would ride. I always answer for the same reasons they do (if they also ride) or (if they don&apos;t), that the big twin is the best vibrator ever! Who needs a man??

Yeah, its weird being a biker chick. Lots of the clothes dont fit. Boots are the worst. All the womens boots look idiotic with fringe and roses sewn on them or have Frankenstein heels. I dont need the height and no fucking way am I putting on anything that has either a fringe or a rose, so I have to buy men&apos;s boots. My Vanson pants were supposed to be cut for a woman, but guess where the waist is? About 2 below my navel. Precisely where a mans waist is. My jackets are good both of them were made for women and accommodate for hips and breasts and the shoulders arent too huge. Gloves fit OK. You win some, you lose some.

I dont often take the bike to work because its a hassle. I go to the gym every morning and since I wont ride without full gear on, that means numerous changes of clothes. Its fun, but wastes time. I only have about an hour and a half for my workout in the am, so I hate wasting any of it. Didnt work out today though, had to haul ass. Will go tomorrow. Chest and triceps. Two of my favorites. Thorn 07-30-2003, 09:50 AM Yesterday on a talk radio show, I heard homosexuality described as a birth defect. That was a first.

Hmm. Never heard that one before. Let me think about that for a minute. When I think of birth defects I think of mangled flesh and cleft palates and deformed hearts. What are those? Imperfections. Difficulties. If severe enough, causes for death. Surely the death of that individual and invariably any progeny she or he may produce.

Hmm. Gays have kids. Ahh, but not with each other. Being gay means you have to go to someone else to have a child, and it cant be with your chosen partner. Only one of you can be a parent at a time. And even then, it requires a highly specialized scientific process to accomplish. Therefore, left to itself, homosexuality is a genetic dead end. And since our only biological function on this earth is to reproduce, one must be heterosexual to accomplish this. Homosexuality denies this process. In our overcrowded world, luckily, this doesnt matter.

Hmm. Can homosexuality be classified as a birth defect? I guess in the strict sense that it negatively impacts our biological ability to reproduce; yes it could be called this.

Which led me down another train of thoughtback to Gattaca or A Brave New World. If we found a gene that triggered homosexuality in humans and parents had a choice whether or not to bear a gay child, how many would? Maybe one in a million. Maybe not even that many. Maybe choosing a gay child would be enforced as a form of population control.

This got me thinking about gay marriage, which in the strict sense, can never be. By strict sense I mean the legal definition of marriage being the union of a woman and a man. One of the things driving that definition is the ostensible intent of marriage to produce children. So if that is the framework of marriage; does it invalidate mine? We are not going to have children. Does this make us less married or not married? I dont think so. What about those who cannot have children? What does it say about that? Hundreds of years ago, a marriage could be annulled for the lack of children. Henry the VIII found this quite convenient when he tired of the axe.

Hmm. Should we come up with another way to describe this union? Should we create another class of union? That could work, except that it would inevitably become a second-class union. That would be an outrage. How can we put one relationship above another simply because it doesnt conform to a certain configuration? So what do we do? Redefine marriage? That cannot be done without entirely separating it from the church. Most churches do not allow homosexual marriage, but still count childless marriages to be whole. This would never work; marriage will always recognized by the church and by the state. In churches it is a sacrament and a holy thing. Impossible to separate marriage from the church.

What choice do we have now for gay unions? If we classify homosexuality as a birth defect, and we allow other people with survivable birth defects (even if those defects render them unable to have children) to marry, gay marriages would have to be granted as well. But that would mean a change in definition, which will never happen, or theyll have to be civil only unions and run the risk of turning into second-class citizens. Oh my brain hurts. I cant think about it any more, actually have to do some work now. I hope no one is offended by this - I am not against gayness - personally, I don&apos;t care what anyone&apos;s sexual orientation is. Thorn 07-31-2003, 05:19 PM Ferris Bueller: I did have a test today. That wasn&apos;t bullshit. It&apos;s on European socialism. I mean, really, what&apos;s the point? I&apos;m not European, I don&apos;t plan on being European, so who gives a crap if they&apos;re socialists? They could be facist anarchists - that still wouldn&apos;t change the fact that I don&apos;t have a car. Not that I condone fascism, or any ism for that matter. Isms in my opinion aren&apos;t good. A person should not believe in an ism - he should believe in himself. I quote John Lennon;&quot;I don&apos;t believe in Beatles, I just believe in me.&quot;A good point there. Of course, he was the walrus. I could be the Walrus; I&apos;d still have to bum rides off of people.

I love that movie. Have it on laserdisc of all things.

I have had only one interracial relationship. Well, to be honest it wasnt so much a relationship as a summer fling. I was 21 or 22 and went into my local upscale stereo shop for some reason and saw this adorable boy working the counter. We started talking and just didnt stop. About stupid stuff like The Princess Bride and other funny movies. When I walked out, I said to myself You should ask him out. After a few minutes, I turned around and walked back in.

Hey. This is going to sound weird but, would you like to go out sometime? If you have a girlfriend, you can say no. Hows that for smooth?? Bahahaha!

But he said yes. Oh he was cute. Younger than me, too. Skin like milk chocolate. Mmmm.. Sweet.

So it began. To be honest, it was so light and noncommittal that I cant remember much of it. We went to parties together. And rode his motorcycle (I was between). Once we went to a party at a friends and we tented out (along with almost everyone else) in their back yard. The next day, we were mostly hungover and hungry. So we decided to crash a bean breakfast hosted by a local church. We paid our $2 or whatever and sat at a picnic table and gorged on eggs, beans, sausage and biscuits.
Once, he won a nights stay w/dinner at a very snooty hotel in the city. We went on the bike and freaked out the bellboy. I loved the look on his face when we gave him our helmets to hold while we checked in.


Anyway, only twice did racism interfere with our lives while we were together. Thorn 07-31-2003, 05:23 PM The first time was when we were going to meet at a concert venue to see Sting. I was with my girlfriend and we went down first. We were to meet him at a certain place at a certain time. We waited. We hunted. We waited. These were in the days before cell phones, so we were pretty much SOL in the communications dept. He never did show.

The next day I asked what happened. He was at work (hes a car stereo installer) and took a customers car out to listen to the system with the top down. Not speeding, just cruising around and listening. Sirens. Lights. Cop. Car interior torn apart and wires everywhere. Accusation that he was trying to steal the stereo, and just stole the whole car. With the key, mind you. He explained that he worked for this store and what he was doing. They held him while they checked it out. In a cell. For hours. Finally, when it was too late for him to drive the two hours to the concert, they let him go with an apology.

We both knew had he been a nice white boy, instead of a nice black boy, he would not have been bothered in the first place.

The second thing is weirder. I have been a passenger in a car with guys who have been pulled over for speeding, and not once did this ever happen.

Cop comes up to the window (which is down) and pushes my guy back against the seat with his forearm across the upper chest, leans in (hand on sidearm) and says to me:

Are you all right, maam?
I look at my guy, like WTF and say
Hide the leg irons. in a gravelly voice.

The cop was not amused. He gave my guy a ticket and sent us on our way. My guy laughed afterwards but was mad that I said it. I couldnt help it.

An incident I didnt see went like this. He was at his moms house in Florida washing her car. His biological mother is white, his biological father is black, his stepfather is white. Hence, the house was inhabited by two white people and my guy (when he was there and not with his biological dad). A neighbor comes by and asks if he can come wash his car when hes done. On the face of it, its an honest mistake, but its just one of those things that he has to deal with all the time. It made me very sad. Still does. Thorn 08-01-2003, 10:55 AM I am a Douglas Adams fan. Yes, that is tantamount to admitting to geekhood, but there it is. Of course I was upset when he died a couple of years ago. Ive read the Hitchhikers Guide series over and over. I have versions of them in audio form and Adams himself, which somehow now seems even more important, reads them. Strangely, I havent been able to get into the Dirk Gently books, but I keep trying. I love his use of odd words and his canted view of the world and how he can make complex science accessible and extremely silly. Last Chance to See was simultaneously sensitive and hilarious a tough thing to pull of with grace and verve and of course he did it.


So imagine my delight at finding Salmon of Doubt on my librarys shelf. It is a collection of essays and other bits and pieces scrounged from the depths of his hard drives. It has a rippingly hilarious introduction by Stephen Fry, one of my favorite funny men. I havent gotten through the whole book yet, but so far it is excellent.

I read all the time. Usually more than one book at a time. Last year was my personal best I read exactly 100 books. I keep a book journal so I know. Mostly thrillers. Right now Im reading Caesars Women by Colleen McCullough, The Empress File by John Sanford and Salmon of Doubt.

Things Im picky about:

Dialogue each character must have their own voice. I hate it when authors make everyone talk the same and have the same vocabulary. Drives me crazy.

Monologues/Fiction disguised as a treatise I hate books that have long, drawn out treatises on things. Sometimes theyre used to show motivation, other times to educate a reader about elements of the book (like science, religion, medicine, dog grooming whatever), but are more often than not, a platform from which the author gets to spout rhetoric. Its OK to educate me as a reader, but it is not OK to preach and force your views down my throat.

Plot holes Lately, Patricia Cornwall is guilty of this. She leaves holes in her plot big enough to drive a tank through. If youre going to create a situation or make a point, follow it up!

Dangling characters Sometimes an author will create a character to just make one or two things happen. Thats annoying. Find another way. It always leaves the reader wondering what the hell happened to that person.

That being said, there are some things that certain authors do that I can overlook because its not the point. You read authors for what they give you, not what they dont give you. For example; dont read Michael Crichton if you want deep characterizations. I hate that every reviewer trots out this complaint with each new book. Damn! How many books do you have to read before you get it that characterizations are not Crichtons strong point, and if he developed strong characters, it would detract from the real reason you read his books; mainly for the cool, just barely out of reach but feasible science, the fluid dialogue and the slightly heavy-handed moral warning. The complete opposite is true of Marian Keyes a fun, light read, full of zippy characters, but no plot.

Anyway, I&apos;ll list some of my favorite books and series later. Mostly I just wanted to spout off about Douglas Adams and how creative and wonderful a writer he was, and how much I miss his work. Thorn 08-01-2003, 02:29 PM Dennis Lehanes Kenzie and Genarro books. Set in Boston and surrounds, theyre extremely well written. His command of the language is awesome. The single best opening sentence of any book Ive ever read is from his book Mystic River. Check this out and tell me its not amazing:

When Sean Devine and Jimmy Marcus were kids, their fathers worked together at the Coleman Candy plant and carried the stench of warm chocolate back home with them.

Robert Craiss Elvis Cole novels. Theyre great. Good plots, interesting characters that actually change and grow. Nice dialogue. Funny in places.

Colleen McCulloughs Ancient Rome series. Yeah, Im only way through the 3rd book, with two more to go, but these are awesomely researched and well written. If you can keep all of the characters straight, you will get such an education on Republican Rome. Backstabbing and political intrigue was not invented in Washington, DC.

Sue Townsends Adrian Mole books. OMG are these funny! I read them in my early 20s and literally laughed out loud. Then my books were stolen and I had to try to find them all over again. Thank god for Amazon.com!!!

Kathy Reichs Tempe Brennan novels. If you were really into Cornwells Kay Scarpetta novels, but are tired of the preachy tone and the idiotic plots, try these. Same forensic goodness but with sense and no high horse. She stumbled a bit with the 3rd book, but got better with the 4th and 5th.

Consistently good writers:
I mean this in the sense that even the worst book from these people is better than any John Grisham.

Ruth Rendell (aka Barbara Vine) (A Dark Adapted Eye, Live Flesh)
PD James (A Certain Justice, The Black Tower)
Raymond Chandler (The Little Sister, The Big Sleep)
Stephen King (The Stand, Needful Things, The Shining, The Dead Zone - Too many to list.)
Patricia Highsmith (Collected short stories, Ripley Series)
Douglas Adams (Hitchhikers Series, The Last Chance to See)
Greg Bear (Darwins Radio, Blood Music)
Ross Thomas (The Chinamans Chance, The Eighth Dwarf, Briarpatch)
Dennis Lehane (Mystic River, A Drink Before the War, Sacred)

As I read especially good stuff, Ill put it in here. Thorn 08-02-2003, 03:48 PM Noob is still coming to the gym with me fairly regularly. I am pleasantly surprised. I expected her to give up by now because it isnt instant gratification. Its been about two months now and shes gone about 20 times. Shes weak, but making the effort. Once, she told me that she dragged herself in even though she hadnt slept well because she knew I would yell at her. How funny. I told her I was proud of her. After her 1st full 5-day week of workouts, I gave her a set of lifting gloves as a little reward. She liked them and was happy. It is hard to keep her from beating herself up for not lifting as heavy as I do. Give me a break. Ive been doing this for years its ok that I lift twice or even three times what you do Noob! Give it time and you will be lifting like this as well. Actually I dont believe this last statement. I am naturally muscular and naturally strong. I didnt start out with as light weights as she is. But everyone has to start somewhere, and the fact that she has started is positive.

It has affected my workout in a couple of ways. One is for the better, one is not. The way it is better is that I push myself a little more. Pride is a funny thing. I run my ass off more intensely when shes on the next elliptical than when she isnt. What a show off huh? But, its true. I cant let her see me slack. The way it isnt better is that sometimes I dont get in a full, intense lifting session because Im busy coaching her and spotting her. I think that will change over time she will need me less and less. But for now, sometimes my workouts arent as focused as they used to be.

Ive been going to the gym and lifting weights off and on for 10 years. This latest on period has been 2 years. Now that my workday doesnt begin until 8:30, I go in the morning. I like it much better than going after work. Its quieter and there are fewer people. Plus it wakes me up and sets up my metabolism for the day. I do not chat, socialize or walk around. The people who do make me laugh - shut up and lift!

People are always shocked and fairly awed when they find out I go to the gym every morning before work. People are so lazy. I am a fitness snob - I admit it. Not a fitness nazi mind you, just a snob. The eww factor of the overweight is pretty strong with me. I cant help it. Its just a visceral reaction that I cant control like when you see roadkill. Most people have no respect for their bodies as machines. Thats what they are. My body is a machine that lets me carry out my will. If I dont take care of it, it will let me down. Simple.

The more antagonistic will trumpet the Jim Fixx example. Remember Jim Fixx? Big running fanatic and fitness guru. Died of a coronary while out running. Ha ha. Big joke. Lazy people often trot out this gem to illustrate that keeping fit is a waste of time because youre just going to die anyway. Bullshit. Its an excuse for being lazy, complacent and having little self-respect.

I have some chronic health problems that cannot be fixed or cured, so keeping the rest of me in good physical condition is important. Otherwise those minor problems will become major ones and keep me from doing what I want. I got enough shit going on that I dont have to ask for trouble!

Plus, I take pride in the fact that Im not a slug. I dont just sit around on my ass all day and do nothing. I care about me and like the results my exercise gives me. Usually that is I think I over trained chest this week. I usually train chest twice a week and today I have one spot in my right pec that is more sore than the rest of the muscle or the right muscle. Ill skip chest on Monday and only do it on Thursday. I wonder if Noob will make it another whole week. Thorn 08-03-2003, 11:28 AM Heres a strange thing;
I am married.
My brother is married.
My parents are still married to each other.
My husbands parents are still married to each other.
My brothers wifes parents are still married to each other.

I think thats kind of strange. With the divorce rate in the US being so high, what are the odds of this happening? I think its one reason my marriage is the way it is (stress-free). Seriously, I have never seen my parents fight. Spat, yes. And by spat I mean

Damn it woman! This cupboard is a mess! I cant find anything. Why dont you organize it?
What are you looking for?
The peanut butter.
Along comes mom, reaches over dads shoulder, spins the shelf thingie and there is the pb.
I know where everything is. Its my cupboard.

That kind of thing was the most serious disagreement or disharmony I ever saw between the rents. When my friends parents were splitting right and left, it was very reassuring. Sometimes it was embarrassing though. I have known my best friend for 25 years. We still email and talk and visit regularly even though she is 3000 miles away. So one day when we were 14 or so, she bicycles over to my house, lets herself in and comes up to my room and announces;

Your parents are making out in the driveway again!

Oh how deep is the trough of teenage parental humiliation! I was mortified even though I had known Olga (not her real name but a real made-up name that we used, I was Evelyn, my mother was Wanda, I cant even remember why now but it was funny at the time) anyway, I had known Olga for 4 or 5 years now, and she was used to my lovey-dovey parents. But still - making out in the driveway!!??? Oh great. How many other people saw them? How much additional crap would I have to take on the bus the next morning? Thanks a lot mom&amp;dad. Why cant you just be normal?

Of course now I am grateful for their love and devotion to each other. Their example has made me not want to compromise in my relationship. Its taught me that constant fighting is wrong. That if youre always bickering and sacrificing and compromising, that you have the wrong mate. My brothers marriage is similar, although I think they have the same kind of spats that my parents used to have (and still do). But they are perfect for each other and very, very happy.

My parents still are, too. But many times during my teenage years, I hoped that mom would divorce my dad. See, we didnt get along. Almost since I learned to speak, my father and I have fought. It stems from having exactly the same communication methods and quickness to anger, but totally differing opinions. So we yell and interrupt and get very mad, very quickly. We are also the king and queen of stubborn. Thorn 08-03-2003, 11:37 AM When I was small he would hit me. I guess now it would be called abuse and not spanking. I think there is a big difference between the two. If my dad had doled out spankings instead of just smacking me, it would have been a whole lot more effective and would have kept me from the fear and hatred I had toward him. Yes, I feared my dad. He would rage and I was usually the target. Mostly it was a straw that broke the camels back reaction. I was the last in a long line of things that pissed him off. So instead of just getting the result of how much I had pissed him off, I got the result of how much the world had pissed him off.

The last time he hit me was when I was about 14 or 15. I cant even remember why. He chased me up the stairs and into my room where I cowered on the bed. He hauled back and punched me on the upper arm. That seemed to be all he had in him because he just yelled and tore stuff off my walls and smashed stuff off my dresser after that. I remember cowering in a fetal position on my bed, waiting for the storm to be over. I can only imagine how it could have been if he drank. My dad is practically a teetotaler and always has been.

After that, it was verbal abuse only. I dont know why. I suppose it was because I was beginning to look like a woman at that point, and my father would never hit a woman. I know, thats a weird distinction ok to hit a child, but not an adult. I think I would have almost rather had him hit me than call me a whore, asshole or bitch. This was almost constant once he knew me to be sexually active.

After a while, even this stopped. I think he felt that he failed in raising me. That I was already a fuck up, so why bother to try to correct her anymore? He dismissed me in a way. Like a special project that didnt turn out well so was discarded on a basement shelf. Im not sure which hurt worse. My father didn&apos;t like me.

But over the years that we have not lived together, my father and I have healed and actually have a semi-functioning relationship. It happened very gradually. One thing I remember is that he started to make an effort to talk to me if he answered the phone when I called. Just little things; how to take care of my car, snow tires, did I have a good flashlight, how was the asthma. Soon, we could speak for hour without a problem. I cannot tell you how awkward these conversations were at first, and I guess they still are in a way. I didnt feel as though I have a rapport with my dad. We didnt have a context, except one of violence and fear and disappointment.

He has also made formal and gut-wrenching apologies to me. Always in front of the family, always with tears (his and eventually mine, too). His latest apology was last Christmas and included my brother. We both told him that he didnt have to keep doing this. That he was forgiven and it was all over with and neither of us turned into a raging psychopath because of his actions. My brother got hit too, but not nearly so much as me. Bro didnt inherit quite so much personality from dad as I did, so didnt clash as much. Plus he was a boy and got much greater leeway than I did as a girl.

I do love my dad. We are not, and probably never will be close though. I dont think I actually like him very much. I mean, if I met him as a coworker, Im not sure Id like him. Its hard to tell from this close. Our past has left a lasting impression (scar?) on me. I absolutely cannot tolerate ANY violence or temper in a man. Even though I am a physically large woman and one who is also strong, I will always have a visceral and somewhat craven fear in the presence of an angry man. I hate this feeling of helplessness and vulnerability and therefore have never chosen men who have quick tempers or the need for constant macho bravado and control.


Wow, that post really got away from me. It went to a destination I didnt start out for. Sometimes I never know where my writing will take me. Now my little kitty Scribble has hopped up and is looking for attention. Gotta go. Thorn 08-04-2003, 11:37 AM Just watched the most hilarious movie this weekend. If you havent seen Scotland PA do. Its great. It is based on Macbeth except its set in the 70s in a fast-food restaurant. Pat&amp;Joe McBeth are sick of working there and want to run the place, so they have to kill the owner. They are in the clear until a cop shows up to solve the crime. Christopher Walken (the cop) steals every scene hes in. The whole thing is funny and dark and strangely dramatic at the same time. Very Coen brothers-esque. I loved it. Andy Dick plays one of the witches! During the opening credits it says that the screenplay is by William Shakespeare. Must buy this now! Do yourself a favor and see this.

In reading my last couple of entries, I think I need to clarify a couple of things.

Mom where was she? She was around but didnt really do much in the way of interfering with my father and me. Mostly she just told me not to do stuff that would set him off. It makes her sound cold but she really wasnt. She was concerned but just removed. We have a great relationship, and almost always have.

Some thoughts on corporal punishment; when used as part of the disciplinary process with children, I dont think its a bad thing. It serves its purpose when it is meted out in specific terms, under specific circumstances. By that I mean that it should be clear to the child as to why they are getting spanked. The parent should not be in a towering rage. Angry yes, but out of control, no. The spanking should be precise and of a duration that is known to both the child and the parent such as six strokes with the ruler or whatever. It should not leave scars or cause serious damage. When finished, the parent and child should talk again about why it was done and how to avoid such a punishment in the future. The child should be chastised, but not angry or humiliated. The parent should not continue to be angry or continue the punishment in a verbal form. It should be over.

You find it strange that a person hit as a child could feel this way? And she doesnt even have a kid, how can she talk? Well suck it up. I am entitled to my opinion. I think we have a nation of out of control brats with no manners, respect or boundaries - just what we need, that and the horrible adults they will become. A little spanking sounds like just what the child psychologist ordered!

Noob will not be coming to the gym with me for a while. She just found out she has to have her gall bladder out. Its full of polyps so the surgery will be happening soon. Shes pretty young and scared that they growths may be cancerous. This is not a common condition. Its disturbing and worrying.

I have never had surgery and hope I never will have. Ive been hospitalized many times though and once was clinically dead for 58 seconds. No I did not see lights, my dead relatives or god. It was dark. Thats it. Ive been intubated (major suckage) and x-rayed and poked and prodded. But never cut open. I have seen a bunch of it on TV and both my parents have had quite a lot of surgery. The thought of it kind of makes me feel strange. On TV the surgeons seem to treat the body like it was a collection of poorly organized parts. I know they have to be that way to get at the problem sometimes, but it would be uncomfortable to be treated this way.

Damn! Dont you hate it ladies when you shave your legs and miss a tiny little strip on one leg? Ugh! Crap. On that note, Im outta here. Thorn 08-05-2003, 11:18 AM A few years ago, I won a skydiving lesson. There is a local airfield where these crazed lunatics amuse themselves by throwing themselves out of perfectly good airplanes, and hurtling towards the ground at 120 feet per second. All for a little adrenaline rush. Couldnt they just get that by tipping their chairs and then leaning back just a little too much and then catching themselves at the last second? Wouldnt that be enough for crying out loud?

Well, it isnt. Nothing on earth can move you like gravity. That, and overwhelming feeling of possible imminent death. What a way to spend an afternoon.

Why did I do it? For the experience. To cross it off my list. Because my friends were doing it. Pick one, pick them all.

When we got there in mid-morning, the day was underway. Like any other group of like-minded people doing very eccentric things, they had a secret-handshake kind of vibe going on. They all seemed to know each other and had on kind of a skydiving uniform wrap around sunglasses, bleached hair, sandals, t-shirts with strange logos and faded jeans. Strangely, no parachute pants in sight.

We attended a lecture about the importance of chute packing. This made us semi-nervous since none of the chutes wed be using were packed by the people who were going to use them. There is a Mason-like secret organization of chute packers with credentials, resumes and apprenticeships and thus like. Around them was the aura of power, respect and just a whiff of the Mafia boss. We were indebted to these people for our very lives. Would they demand tribute? What could I offer? My wrap around sunglasses?

We were paired off with our instructor/Siamese twin. You see, we were going on a tandem jump. This means your instructor is strapped to your back, kind of like a sloth, koala or monkey. Instead of feeling like the mama, I felt like a human airbag. The instructors then give you the ground rules on what to do when in free fall, when to open your chute and how to land. If I couldnt manage the first two, the last would sort of fade into the wallpaper.

We get into the plane, a whole lot of us. BSBG and I will jump simultaneously. Our other friends are still on the ground. Im about 5th from the door. My instructor says that hell count to three and then well tip out. Like were getting into a pool. Ive never gotten into a pool with a 190-pound guy on my back!

Inch. Inch. Inch. On our butts, knees up, fairly crablike in our weird Siamese twin rigging, creeping towards the open door. Its insanely loud and the wind is whipping around in the cabin. Inch. Inch. Inch. Ok heartstart pounding. Ok palmsstart sweating. Come on adrenaline go! Youre going to jump out of a plane for gods sake be nervous. Be scared. Nothing. All I can muster is gobs of excitement and a huge grin. Inch. Inch. Inch. Here&apos;s the door now.

One.


Two.

Out!!!! Im out of the freaking plane! He didnt say three! Thorn 08-06-2003, 09:09 AM ARCH!!

Thats the main bit. To arch your back against the wind and rapidly approaching Earth. Mind the altimeter need to pull the chute at about 5000 feet. We jump at 12000 feet. Then ARCH! For you math-phobes out there, this is about a minute of free fall. Doesnt seem like much on the ground but in the sky- YEEEE HAAAA! Is it an awesome 60 seconds! Damn its cold up here! And my eyes are watering even with these stupid goggles on! I cant see my altimeter. Crap! How will I know when to open the chute? It hardly feels like Im moving. The air almost feels solid. But wait, isnt that the ground?

Ah yes, the ground. It intrudes. How to avoid hitting it? The chute. It is an optical illusion that when you open a parachute, you fly upward. You dont. The person filming you just keeps falling. It feels uplifting, but thats just the suddenness of decelerating from 120 feet per second to none. For a moment youre stationary. Then you start to drift. It was a pleasant surprise to find out that steering a canopy is just like steering a motorcycle (apart from the leaning bit) push right, go right; push left, go left. Got it.

Wow. You can see everything from up here! Look at all the little people. They do look like ants. And the plane looks so small now. Its so quiet. All I can hear is the wind and the creaking of the canopy lines. Look at the trees and the buildings. Its like a model train set. I can see my motorcycle! Wheres BSBG? Oh and look at that lumberyard next door.

Lumberyard??!! Crap! Dont let me land in the lumberyard!!! Push right, go rightjust steeeerrr over this way and ahhtheres the landing green. Whats that instructor/twin? When Im just about to hit the ground, bring my hands straight down and in towards my legs? This causes the canopy to pull forward and acts as a brake? OK, no problem. Theres the ground now. Damnit sure is coming

Wham! Miracle of miracles. Both my instructor and me stay on our feet quite a feat when strapped together. Disengage canopy.

Now the adrenaline hits! That was the most awesome thing ever! What a RUSH. I cant stop grinning! I wanna do it again. Im practically dancing in my stupid yellow jumpsuit with the awful leather helmet that looks like its from the Chicago Bears circa 1950. Can we go again?

But I only paid for one drop, so one is all I get. Now I get to watch my friends go up. None of them made a perfect landing. Only me. {curtsey} One of them really got screwed. He came down very fast and then just as he disconnected from his instructor he puked!! We laughed our asses off. Then we found out why, but it was still funny. Turns out his instructor was going for some kind of club record for the number of tandem jumps done in one day. The way to come down fast after the canopy opens is to corkscrew. So he corkscrewed first right and then left. Paul was completely motion sick. He was pissed. The rest of us got tons of canopy time, he barely got any.

Afterward:
When we returned to work a bunch of people were freaked out and relieved to see us. The day after we were there, someone died while jumping at the same airfield. She did land in the lumberyard after her chute failed to open and her reserve got caught in the main chute and didnt deploy correctly. The day before, a guy landed in a tree and broke his leg. They thought the unnamed victims would be one of us. Damn! Thorn 08-06-2003, 03:57 PM Well, mostly.

Recent good shopping trip:

CDs!
Led Zeppelin Houses of the Holy
Simon&amp;Garfunkel The Columbia Recordings to 1969
Social Distortion Prison Bound
Prince Best of
Joe Jackson Best of
Annie Lennox Bare
Elvis Presley 30 #1 Hits
Steve Martin Lets Get Small

Woo hoo! I love new CDs. I love putting them all in the stereo and hitting shuffle. I love the new shiny, unmarked surface. I love discovering the artwork&amp;liner notes. I even like adding them to my database.

A Recent bad shopping trip:

Bras.
I go to the rack of a brand I used to wear but havent in a couple of years. Jeez! What is with all these padded bras?! What am I, 12? I dont need a padded bra for fucks sake. Can I just find a normal, cotton bra please!? Finally, heres one. I try on my size. WTF?? Have I shrunk? This stupid thing is too big! I check the size. Yup, its the size I have been wearing for almost 20 years.

So I move to another brand. Same problem. What?? My BOOBS are shrinking? :eek: Hows that for a cosmic joke? I run every day and lift weights and my ass refuses to shrink. WTF is with that?? As if women dont suffer enough with this whole stupid getting your period thing. Every month. For 35 years. Now my boobs have to shrink???!!! There is no god. Well at least I can wear a padded bra now!! Just kidding.

So I try on another (eek! smaller) size. Well damn. It freaking fits.

Bra shopping sucks. Are you with me ladies?? Especially when your boobs are shrinking.


Car shopping can be fun. Let me rephrase that; car looking can be fun. My car is 5 years old, but is just the ticket for getting to drive all kinds of niffy things at snooty dealerships. Take the Porsche dealership they let me drive anything! I just say that Im tired of my old car and am looking to upgrade. They practically kill themselves giving me the keys. Ditto the Corvette dealer and once I drove a used Ferrari! Now where&apos;s that McClaren?? Thorn 08-07-2003, 01:40 PM This post is dedicated to all those readers who I have not yet alienated with my gay marriage and/or devolution posts.


I am a Second Amendment supporter. I am uncomfortable with anyone infringing my constitutional rights. I guess if I had any religion it would be a Cult of the Constitution. People say that the Second Amendment was written in a time that was simpler and the weapons less destructive. That may be true, but what about the other amendments? Whats to stop people from tearing down other amendments just because they were written long ago? Its the precedent that I dont like. How much time is long enough for an amendment to be viable? Who is to say it is not viable?

We may not need a well-maintained militia now, but we certainly do need to protect ourselves. In the past, the militia served this function, now I have to be a militia unto myself. I cannot allow the government to strip me of my right to protect myself. Ever hear the phrase Theres never a cop around when you need one.? Can you imagine if this were the only way you would be protected? Do you think criminals are going to wait for someone to show up so it will be a fair fight? Since when has the government ever had my best interests in mind? Since when has the government done anything right?

I cannot stop societys escalating violence. I do not have a solution that will make us all peaceful and loving and kind to one another. Until then, I will take responsibility for my own actions and my own defense. Partially, its why I lift weights. The thought of just being another weak woman, who can be easily subdued, is abhorrent to me.

Do I own a gun? Yes. Does BSBG? Yes. Many. 3 safes full.

He is an expert used to teach for the NRA. He taught me. I shoot well and respect all rules of gun ownership. We are responsible gun owners. They are for protection and also for enjoyment. We enjoy going to the range and practicing. We enjoy the mechanics of a well-designed firearm. If anyone breaks into our home, they are going out in a bag. Its that simple. I refuse to be a victim. I refuse to be powerless. I refuse to be frightened. When I am home, I am absolutely secure in the knowledge that we can handle whatever comes.

Do we sound paranoid? Were not. Were prepared. And we refuse to hide our heads in the sand and say, It couldnt happen to us. It only happens to other people. The problem with that is that youre the other person to everyone else. My mother in law was a victim of a home invasion; so dont tell me it never happens.

You have all heard that guns dont kill people, people kill people. Its true. The gun is no more responsible for the death than is the manufacturer. Why dont we outlaw cars? Why dont we sue car manufacturers? People die in car crashes more often than they do by firearms. People conveniently forget that. How about swimming pools? People drown in them, especially children. We should outlaw those. And bathtubs! Damn those things are dangerous. Down with bathtubs. Dont forget knives. Every time someone wants to buy a knife, we should do a background check or make them wait a week to get their knife. And gas grills. And cigarettes. And dogs. And roller coasters.

I agree with background checks. Criminals should not have legal access to firearms. I dont agree with telling me what kind of gun I can have, though. Those laws have done a lot of good though huh? Criminals certainly cant get those anymore, can they? Nope, no illegal weapons for them. That showed em. Thorn 08-08-2003, 04:43 PM Rob Zombie freaking rocks. I love this man. Not as much as Neil Young perhaps, but Im sure he can feel the love.

People write about sex a lot in their journals. Im not sure why. Some of its good and has a point, others are just showing off or writing to get attention, or to be accepted or cool. Thinking about or picturing other people having sex has its appeal, but for me its limited because sex has to involve me to be a turn on. Sometimes I, think about my more ugly/goofy coworkers in the act. I never fail to laugh.

Why oh why do people who cant drive feel the need to turn out to the left slightly before turning right? Morons. No concept of fucking power steering or vehicle dynamics. These are the same people who brake in turns, not realizing that their tires are losing contact with the road and therefore they are more at risk than if they didnt brake. Idiots.

People also have a lot of angst about the opposite sex in their journals. I read my old real life journals sometimes, and wonder at how I couldnt get on with my life because I was so obsessed over some guy or other (the Leech included). I wish I knew than what I know now, that I needed to take care of me first and then someone would come along that would fit into the life Id constructed. As soon as I did that, someone came along.

Ministry also rocks.

I have been involved with another message board for about a year now and I have multiple personalities on it and no one knows. Sometimes I even have conversations with myself and set up arguments to see which people will defend which of my personalities. Its funny. One personality no one likes but one seems to get along. One just comes to the board to stir shit and insult. One rarely posts. 4 personalities altogether. Its hard keeping track sometimes, but I have a schitck with each of them, so its not too bad. Its kind of an experiment.

I used to play The Sims all the time, and then suddenly, I lost interest. No exaggeration in one day I just dropped it. Before that though, I was obsessed. I even had Sims dreams, with the little spinning diamond above peoples heads and everything. Sick.

My pecs hurt from doing chest this week. The normal ache though, not the over-training pain of last week. I did legs and back today. This workout always leaves me exhausted.

My Ducati is loud enough to set off some car alarms. {evil grin}

I cannot wait to go home. I have an appointment with my therapist. You may have heard of him Sam Adams. BSBG says he put some in the fridge along with some yummy chardonnay. We are semi-wine snobs. Semi. We like good wine, but it doesnt have to be either expensive or French for it to be good.

A wine snob story. My sister in laws friend took a wine tasting class. She was taught that only French wines are palatable or acceptable. No other wines not Italian, Australian, American or German. She would drink nothing but French wine. No one else knows how to make wine and its all crap. BS. So, my sister in law has a dinner and I decide we should decant the wine instead of leaving it in bottles. We do. She drinks. She praises the wines up one side and down the other. Words cannot adequately describe the look of horror, humiliation and anger on her face when we showed her the California wine bottles. She so deserved it though. Thorn 08-09-2003, 03:51 PM A couple of guys just left the house. One was my brother in law, the other is an old buddy of BSBGs. Hes a cop. Deputy Sheriff. Oh the horror stories. He gets cosmic jokes played on him, too. He is hugely allergic to cats. So of course, he always finds the cat hoarder with 50 to 100 cats stuffed into the apartment theyre being evicted from. His most recent hoarder eviction was ultra gross. So many cats that there was 8 inches of cat shit on the floors. 8 inches! He says that the old guy, who was actually still living in this hellhole, had a mattress on the floor and the cat shit was up to the top. All of the cats had to be euthanized because they were all diseased. There were dead cats decomposing in their own shit. Seriously one of his grosser stories. And no, he didnt get to wear a mask or boots or gloves or any other protective gear.

Once he told a story of another eviction where the apartment was filled floor-to-ceiling with garbage. It was piled up into walls and the whole place was a maze. It took them an hour to find the occupant. I can even imagine this. But hes totally serious.

Another eviction (and possible arrest on 3 outstanding warrants) story he told today goes like this; he and his partner go to the residence, paperwork in hand. When they get in there, they discover the occupant on the floor with 3 gunshot wounds to the chest. He is bleeding but coherent and says that a black guy shot him and ran away. The apartment was locked up tight, however. They figure the guy must still be in there. Search turns up no one. The guy is going on about it, so they do a building search. No one. After the guy is hauled off to the hospital, they search the apartment and find the gun behind the couch and a suicide note in the bathroom drawer (go figure). Apparently the guy wrote the note, shot himself 3 times, got up, hid the note and made up the story about the black guy. At the hospital they confirm with the doctor that the wounds were self-inflicted. One shot took out a ventricle; the others did no major damage. Hes patched up. In recovery, a blood clot loosens from his heart and lodges in his brain. Stroke. Coma. Death.

I could never be a cop.


Thanks to everyone who has PMed me with encouragements or comments Deb_u_taunt, L_D, Mattie, Bambookie&amp;Tango. I know there are more that I didnt list you are appreciated too. I read many of your journals as well keep on writing goils.

My Lives of the Twelve Caesars is beckoning, so I must read. Its the oldest book Ive ever read Suetonius wrote it in the 1st century ad. Sometimes when he says something like some letters from so-and-so survive to this day, I have to remember that it was 2000 years ago! Thorn 08-11-2003, 02:12 PM &quot;I refuse to join any club that would have me as a member.&quot;- Groucho Marx

Weird vibes around here lately. So much venom and clannishness. More than Ive ever seen during all my lurk-time (about 6 months). Its made me re-think keeping my journal here. It seemed like a home for creativity. Sure there were plenty of journals without substance, theres bound to be, but there are some that have a point and are well written. Just as with any on-line message board, the quality is bound to be uneven. But the exclusive little world that some would like to create here, even in the off-topic area, is just strange. Maybe the site owner should make it all improv, all the time. That way the pure can feel special all by themselves. But of course, it never works that way. Without impure people around, whom would they have to lord it over? Nah, they need the nons in order to feel superior.


I saw the same thing happen at another dedicated board that sprouted several off-topic thread forums. The dedicated original people were mad that so much of the conversation took place on the off-topic boards. They were indignant that none of their on-topic threads got as much play as the off-topics. Eventually, some of them tried to boycott the off-topic forums. Like the bratty little kid who takes his bat and goes home.

It didnt work though. The rabble-rousers continued to post to the on-topic threads and have way too much fun on the off-topic threads. After a while, the furor died down and everyone was again posting wherever they felt like it. It was really stupid.

The funniest thing is that the people who dont want things to stray away from pure improv topics, probably describe themselves as open, freethinking and tolerant. The fact that theyre being insular, closed-minded and hostile, seems to escape them. Priceless, but human. People cant help the desire to feel special and part of an exclusive group. Its part of human nature. The fact that we have come down to having to do this with virtual friends and on-line communities is farcical.

Ive often seen a cyber-community compared to a bar or a living room or other physical room of people, and that by playing by the same rules as apply in those situations, a person can successfully navigate an on-line community. Yes and no. Sure, if youre a confident/witty/charming person in real life, youll be a confident/witty/charming person in cyber life. But if youre not, you can safely act out and not bear the consequences you would in real life. Its remarkably freeing for some. Others take it too seriously like dogs snarling over territory.

Another thing is the person who deliberately becomes the shit-stirrer. On the surface, they say it is just their schtick. Unconsciously, it&apos;s another story. They think/know that eventually the community will reject them, so they reject the community first before they can be hurt. Its sad and obvious really, and I have no patience with it. Unless of course, it is part of my twisted little experiment on the other board I frequent.

That being said, Ill play it by ear. Ill monitor and watch. If the site owner decides this should be all improv, all the time, no harm done. Ill go and so will others. But I think much of the fire and shine and pure silliness will also go, and wheres the fun in that? Thorn 08-12-2003, 10:33 AM Judging by the number of views, I see that I am not the only one with a sense of curiosity for the prurient. The journal is interesting in a couple of ways if it is true.

The arrogance of this woman is overwhelming. Its laughable. Ive seen smaller egos on sports stars and top sales reps. When it comes right down to it; a prostitute is a blue-collar worker similar to a plumber or a mechanic. They are paid not based on what they know, but on what they do. Fine and good. My dad is a factory mechanic. But why get an attitude about your customers? I recently had a guy in to work on my roof. He was nice and smart and affable. If he had given me the attitude this woman gives her customers, Id have used another roofer. Seems odd to me.

Thats how I think of prostitution once I get past the eeewww factor. It should be regulated like every other blue-collar job. There should be OSHA regulations and apprenticeships and journeymen (journeywomen?). There should be standardized pricing and Unions. Specialization and certification. Taxed and licensed. Since it is obviously a profession with a market and a huge customer base, we&apos;d have to be nuts not to capitalize on it. But that will never happen, and not just because the straight community wouldnt let it, Id bet that the high end whores themselves would be against it. After all, they cant be held accountable or liable for anything because the person who complained would just get arrested. Pretty neat that.

But thats the top end, what about the bottom end? What about the crack whores and the women (kids) abused and controlled by sadistic pimps? Or even the ones with relatively humane primps. Could legalization and regulation help these women? Probably not. There is always a criminal element to any profession. These women would most likely remain where they are. No, the ones I can see it most benefiting are the middle classes. The ones that just need to get out of debt. The ones who need to support kids or elderly parents. They could probably make good money in a prostitute Union.

That being said, the eeewww factor is big for me. The thought of having to get physical and open up my body to any man, who had the cash, is totally repulsive. Fat men literally make my skin crawl. I think having to be intimate with one would make me nauseous. Now that&apos;s sexy! :slurp: I can separate sex from love, but not from attraction. I kind of admire a person who can be that separate from themselves. A person who can simply treat another person like a machine they have to deal with. An onerous task that must be got on with. I couldnt overlook the wholly unattractive package. Not that the attractive package would be easy, but it would at least not make me puke.

Overall I think prostitution does bring things down to a certain gutter level, but this isnt new. Polite society likes to relegate it to a corner, out of sight out of mind. Maybe if we legitimized it and regulated it, prostitution wouldnt reek of the gutter quite so much. Every time a Heidi Fleiss gets busted, and her A-list of clients comes out, people seem to think its OK, even expected. There&apos;s a veneer of acceptability. That she ran a high-class establishment and it is somehow better or different than a stand up in an alley. We still make Charlie Sheen and Hugh Grant jokes, but they are jokes of nodding approbation not condemnation. Hypocrites we are. Thorn 08-13-2003, 12:08 PM Every time I go to one, I cant wait to leave. Its a combination of things:
the noise
the smell
the people
the traffic
the overcrowding
the unfamiliarity

Basically I guess it comes down to people. Too many in too small a space. I just cant relate to the desire to live in one. I could happily live the rest of my life and never set foot in a city again. When I lived in the 2nd biggest city in our state, I could hear my neighbors through the walls. I had to fight for a parking space. It took me forever just to get out of the city each day (I worked elsewhere). Once, my apartment was broken into. And its not even a big city really (about 90,000 people). Gak. Never again.

My dream is to have a house on more than 10 acres of land. Preferably with a water feature a brook or a pond. And a four or five car garage. The solitude and the silence and the space will be heaven. Right now my house is on a dead end street in a suburban development. We only have acre and have neighbors on both sides. They arent bad people, but one has kids and a pool and its constantly loud and irritating. The other play bad 70s rock or their TV so loud that we can hear dialogue. The guy across the street is a maniac about his lawn he mows at night with the headlight of his tractor on. Its crazy. I hate it. Weve been there 6 years now. The house is paid for, so its cheap.

Ok, enough of that. Too many of these journals are just whining pity-parties from people who have no bigger problem than themselves. Wake the fuck up people. Most of us have no idea what real hardship is and probably never will. American life has made us soft. If we get cut off in traffic, it ruins our whole day. Oh, didnt get that CD/DVD/parking spot/whatever and were crushed. Cheated. Betrayed. Give me a break. Thorn 08-13-2003, 01:26 PM I had an excellent grounding in good music as a kid; Neil Young (my mom and I went to see him last month and he was great as always), Eric Clapton, early J. Giles, Jim Croce, The Eagles, Led Zepplein, early Pink Floyd. It was great. Until I was about 10. Then my musical world shut down with a thud.

They found Jesus - the rents. And with all newly converted born-again Christians, the conversion was extreme. Suddenly, things that were OK the day before, were evil and of the devil today. They laid waste to the record collection. With tears I recall the day they burned the Led Zeppelin IV album (original pressing sob!). Church went from 1 hour on Sunday to 4. Halloween was right out.

Religious zeal took over big time. Little fish stickers appeared on everything. My parents would witness to practically everyone they met. We no longer gave out candy at Halloween but instead tracts. Oh yeah, as if I dont have enough trouble with the neighborhood kids, they have to make it worse. As I got older, things became taboo Atari, the Rubix Cube, Rock and Roll all works of the devil to take our minds off of Jesus. I remember being sent to Christian camp for a week a couple of times. It was awful. Teenage hormones harnessed to pray and speak in tongues and get blasted by the Holy Spirit or whatever. Bad food. Bad games. Bad all around.

Once, they had me go to a seminar at church about the evils of rock and roll. I was about 14 at the time. It was at night and had all kinds of slides and a cool younger guy that they thought could relate to us gave the talk. So up on the screen goes that Uriah Heep album cover (http://www.thenightowl.com/images/uha.jpg (http://www.thenightowl.com/images/uha.jpg)) and they proceed to tell us that Uriah Heep was another of the devils many names.
So I raise my hand and say,

Uriah Heep is a character in David Copperfield by Charles Dickens. He is sneaky and oily but he wasnt Satan.

They totally didnt address my freaking point and they proceeded to tell us that it was evil because of the cover. Then they put up the Led Zep IV album cover. They took issue with the druidy guy with the lantern (ooohh its in the shape of an upside-down star! Stay back). They didnt like Goats Head Soup because Satan was known to appear as a goat sometimes. They thought that ELOs Waterfall was full of secret messages. They totally lost me. I think in that moment, my belief in god was gone. I saw these people for the grasping at straws folks they were.

It went down hill after that. I discovered Black Sabbath. I have blocked out all memory of the day the rents found We Sold Our Souls For Rock and Roll in my bedroom. But it wasnt just stuff like that that set them off. No, even News of the World by Queen freaked them out. Guess they didnt like Killer Queen. When I started to like David Bowie my mom lost it because he was gay. All I can say is the Walkman saved me. Headphones man!

These days they are much less uptight about things. My mom doesnt believe what I said she said about David Bowie (she likes his new CD). They were so out of the loop for so long though, that they crack me up. Heres what I mean. My mom calls me one day to say that she just heard this really great song on the radio and she loves this new band. It was Sultans of Swing. I nearly choked I laughed so much. I had to break it to her that it was 15 years old (at the time). Thorn 08-14-2003, 04:48 PM with peanuts. Oh what a great story that is. Shirley Jackson is one of my heros.

Oh man my car is fast! Of course it could just be that Ive been driving a relatively slow car for the last two weeks. Just got it back from my mechanic. The brakes need to be broken in, and so do the tires but wow! I will have to play with it more to see if the lightweight flywheel has any real effect.

Just read Burns post about Warren Zevon. He is one of my favorites. BSBG got me into him. He has almost everything on vinyl too. WZ is under appreciated I think. He had one or two hits and thats all people think of, which is too bad. Transverse City is a great album and so is Sentimental Hygiene (Neil Young plays guitar on the title track). Roland The Headless Thompson Gunner is one of the best songs ever. My Shits Fucked Up is priceless. Mr. Bad Example is a riot. I love it all.

My new pet peeve is the misuse of the word myself. For example:
Feel free to call myself or Nancy with any questions.
This is WRONG! Break the sentence in two. Would you ever say to anyone - feel free to call myself? Only if youre a moron. The correct sentence is as follows:
Feel free to call Nancy or me with any questions. (You always put yourself after the other people in your sentences.)
Another is this:
Joe and myself went to the party.
WRONG! Again, split the sentence. You wouldnt say myself went to the party. You would say I went to the party. So the correct sentence would be:
Joe and I went to the party.
I am a total grammar nerd. Couldnt tell, could you?

The rain finally stopped. At least for now. It rained for 11 days in a row here. And muggy as hell! I felt like I needed SCUBA gear to go outside. The sun is out and I can hardly take it in. I actually got to drive home with the sunroof open yesterday.

I am feeling kind of misanthropic today. Everything people do just bugs me. A woman comes out to her car to smoke (that&apos;s the smoking area for our company - your car) and has to run the car so she can have air conditioning. Grrr. I was in my car with the windows open, trying to read and she makes a ton of noise. Disgusting, fat, sweating brute. I just heard some people saying goodbye to a woman who works in our cafeteria. They were all hugging and it was so fake. As if they had 3 words to say to her while they she served them lunch. Phonies. At the gym there are people who come in to work out wearing their work clothes. What the fuck is wrong with you? You dress, drive, arrive, change, work out, shower, change, drive. Just wear your stupid gym clothes and bring your work clothes!! Morons!

Ill just listen to some 80s music until I calm downThere is freedom within, there is freedom without, try to catch the deluge in a paper cup. Ahh, thats better. Thorn 08-15-2003, 11:37 AM P iss

I can now add one more reason that I am glad that I dont live in a big city that blackout must be hell. I am proud of the controlled and calm manner in which the citizens acted. They did great (at least so far at the time of this writing). But I wouldnt want to be one of them. That so sucks. When the power goes out here, I just have to haul out the generator and plug it in. It doesnt run everything, only 2 circuits, but its enough. Before we had the gennie, we had frozen pipes, frozen iguana and lost a whole refrigerator of food. Since weve had the gennie, it has definitely paid for itself. Plus we get to watch movies and have air conditioning in one room.

Just found out that the security guards at one of our locations didnt show up today, so 70 or so people are wandering around the parking lot unable to get into the building. Considering the temper of the site director for that location, the security guard who didnt show should go straight to unemployment after he opens up. Of all the people in the world I would not want to be right now, hes at the top of the list. I would rather be Saddam Hussein at this moment.

My bro&amp;his wife and me and BSBG are having a birthday party for my mom tonight. Her bday was actually a few days ago, but she&amp;dad were away on vacation. I got her this really cool Bob Dylan boxed set that I think she will love. And Im picking up a positively sinful chocolate fudge torte w/strawberry layers. I will have to walk home to burn off the calories from just smelling the thing, Im sure!

I hope dad drives the hot rod. Hes got a 32 Ford panel truck that has been totally hot-rodded. Its a gorgeous blue with a Chevy small block and chassis. Its very cool, but has been 5 years in the making. The only time Ive seen it move is when the guys were pushing it into the garage! It has been recently appraised at about $30-40K. He is so proud. It something hes always wanted to do but the responsibilities of family prevented him until 5 years ago. Im glad he can have something for himself. Even though he was a son of a bitch to live with sometimes, he worked like a dog for us. Sure we sometimes wanted for the luxuries (like REAL chocolate and not sinister carob) that other kids had, but never for the necessities.


Had a monster leg workout today and Tuesday. Its very hard for me to get my legs to hurt now that squats are almost impossible for me to do on a regular basis. Instead I do leg presses and those make my legs hurt (and my butt!!). My back is what keeps me from this stuff. I have spina bifida occulta, which hardly ever gives me trouble but makes my lower back very unstable. I have to be very careful or Ill put it out and practically cripple myself. Once when I was doing deadlifts (great for hams and glutes), I put my back out and almost blacked out right there in the gym. It was excruciating and I was seriously debilitated for days and only functionally debilitated for a couple of weeks. It was awful. No more deadlifts for me.

Having my protein shake now. I drink one a day. Carbs are my downfall though. I have to cut down. Not radically, but a bit. I also try to increase my protein so that I can maintain my muscle mass. Im not huge or scary or anything, but I have been lifting for years and am pretty muscular for a woman. But because women are not chemically set up to have a large muscle mass, we need to supplement. Not with steroids mind you, but with protein and increased creatine (found in red meat). Carbs are definitely important for overall nutritional balance, but I think I eat too many of them. Im going to start carb-counting now.

Whoaa person I used to work with years ago just came by. Hes here to pitch some software that another department is interested in. What a small world. Its cool though. Hes a nice guy. I hope he makes the sale.


Anywaymy collective rambling has petered out for now. Thorn 08-17-2003, 09:07 AM I am off to a wedding today. In Boston. It s a chore.

Well consider it payback for my wedding you say? Nope. Mine was tiny. Immediate family only. No pomp. No circumstance. I didnt even buy a dress. Including the rings it was under $3000. And we werent even going to wear rings at first but kind of got bullied into it by various mothers. My ring is my one nod to vanity in this whole procedure. If Im going to wear one, its going to be diamonds baby!

I dont need to be the center of attention that badly, thank you very much. Thats what it seems like to me whenever I go to a big wedding. A cry for attention. Look at me!! Somebody loves me. Seehere he is right here (good hard yank on the chain). Validate me! See my pretty dress? It cost more than my car! Love me!

Bah. The whole concept just seems warped and twisted these days. An excuse to show off. And a colossal waste of money if you ask me. Damn, for what some chicks spend on their weddings, you could buy a decent car or put a huge down payment on a house or start a solid investment portfolio. Instead these brainless twats pitch it all down the toilet in a self-absorbed frenzy of look at me.

BSBG and I never intended to marry. We didn&apos;t see the point. We were already in love. We were already committed to each other. The paper license and the rings weren&apos;t necessary to convince us that what we share is real and forever. We didn&apos;t need to put up a&quot;keep off the grass&quot;sign. But, then I got laid off, and the bias of the law against the unmarried got us. I couldn&apos;t legally be on the insurance that he partly paid for anyway. So we got married. But we spared our relatives a big to do.

So its hard to be of good cheer when I go to these things sometimes. I usually get stuck at some gawd-awful table. The music is wretched. The DJ is obnoxious. The insipid games make me want to barf. Its hot. Noisy. And I think I might cheerfully strangle the next asshole who taps on their glass in an effort to make the bride and groom kiss. We usually escape just when the guys are drunk enough to dance and the girls are drunk enough to dance on the tables.

I have been in a couple of weddings, and its worse as a brides maid than it is as just an ordinary guest. When youre a brides maid, youre expected to stay the whole time and even participate in some of the idiotic games. My best friend, Olga, was mad at me when I refused to stand with the rest of the hopeless females and catch the bouquet. Well damn! It was 95 degrees out and I was wearing a long polyester dress. My stupid shoes were killing my poor feet (she made me actually dance the Macarena, damn didnt that spectacle make her happy??!!) I just had some rubber chicken and bad champagne. When she kept on me about it I just said Im not single, just unmarried throw the thing without me! Oy vey. As soon as it wound down, I raced back to my hotel room, stripped off the horrid dress, stuffed it in my saddlebag and took off as fast as I could without popping a wheelie.

Ahem. Put your game face on now. Try to look like you&apos;re not going to the firing squad! Thorn 08-18-2003, 02:17 PM The church was air-conditioned


As part of the ceremony, someone badly sang Annies Song by John Denver (gak!!!!)

The photographer almost got run over on Tremont Street while trying to take a group photo of everyone on the church steps. A ton of tourists stopped to gawk and take pictures too. We were a spectacle.

BSBG took my picture at Sam Adamss grave. Sadly it does not say Brewer, Patriot. It should.

The reception had OPEN BAR!!!

The DJ was too lame to make us play those stupid wedding games. The music sucked.

Absolutely no one banged a glass to make the couple kiss. A wedding miracle!!!

Crazy, homeless guys kept trying to get themselves into the pictures that were being done in Boston Common. They complained the wedding party was hogging the benches.

My mother-in-law chattered incessantly during the hour ride to Boston.

None of the bride or grooms friends drank beer. They all drank wine or girlie pink drinks.

I looked hot in my short blue dress and strappy sandals.

The best man bawled through his toast. No, make it eulogy. The worst toasts ever. Between him and the maid of honor it was easily hour of listening to meaningless anecdotes and stammering.

We bailed at the first Bob Meeger song they played. Thorn 08-18-2003, 04:17 PM There is going to be another blood drive here at work. I wonder if Ill faint again? The first time I gave was in April and I was feeling fine. Got up from the bed thingie and sat at the table to have my juice and I started to feel light headed. As I was making my way towards a vacant bed thingie, I hit the floor. I smacked my head pretty good and it hurt for a day or so. I kind of wish that someone filmed it just because it must have been hilarious. Of course I will try again. The actual giving part wasnt bad at all. I liked the little motorized tray that slops your blood back and forth like a miniature wave machine. The color is nice, too. And the whole arent we great human beings kind of vibe. My blood type is A negative.

Im ordinarily not a big humanitarian. Whenever I see some sort of footage of a disaster or war, I always think of the animals with more sympathy and/or worry than I do the humans. Or when a cowboy gets shot and his horse goes tumbling tooI cringe not for the rider but for the horse. I cant help it. To me, animals are much more sympathetic than are humans.

One of my peeves is the casual way people treat animals. As if they are inanimate objects that can be easily thrown away. Needless to say, whenever I watch Animal Cops, I cry. I cant help it. Its not fair that pit bulls have to die simply because they were born what they are. Theyre so cute. Now, granted, it is more practical to put them down than to take a chance it may be violent, but its so damn sad. One of my mechanics has a pit bull named Penny and she wouldnt hurt an ant. Shes so cute and always wants attention.

I also hate it when people buy animals with little or no research and then think they can just throw them away. I used to volunteer at a reptile rescue place near my house and it was just astounding how many assholes would buy those cute, little green iguanas and have no idea how to take care of them. Iguanas should cost more at the beginning it would be one deterrent. But because theyre $20 or less, people get them.

Little do they know that these guys get up to 8 long and require very specialized housing and diet.
Housing very large with room to climb! Hot spot of nearly 100 degrees. No lower than 65 degrees at night. Humid at least 40% - they come from Central America, what do you expect!? My girl has a 6x5x3 enclosure with lights and a heat panel and a humidifier in winter.

They eat no animal protein in the wild and cannot digest it. Dont feed them dog or cat food. Their livers and kidneys will fail and they will die in a few years. Mine is going to be 9 and is quite healthy. Also, they cannot absorb calcium from food without exposure to UVB. No UVB means they leech calcium from their bones. The bones become soft and bend and eventually they die. They need fresh leafy greens (NOT lettuce) with other veggies mixed in.

Males become very aggressive during breeding season and can do serious damage if youre careless (I had one break a cats leg once when the stupid cat wouldnt obey the warnings - hissing and tail whipping). Females lay eggs almost every year (just like you girls, they lay eggs without a male having to fertilize them) and require nesting boxes and other environmental changes so that wont think theres no good place to lay their eggs, and then get egg-bound and become infected.

Oksorry for the rant. But thats just the tip of the iceberg with igs. Snakes, turtles and other assorted exotics have the same issues as igs in the pet industry. Theyre disposable to most people and that is so sad. If I had more time/room/money, I would go into rescue myself. Thorn 08-19-2003, 03:36 PM My parents definitely dont still think Im 12. Heres proof:

Im in the car w/my mom a couple of years ago. She just came from the doctor who told her she had to go on cholesterol medication (like Lipitor or something) and he gave her some samples to try. They had different side effects and he wanted to gauge their effect on her.

This one is definitely out. she says holding up a sample kit.
Why? You havent even tried it yet.
Because the main side effect is reduced sex drive. No way, Jose. She rolls her eyes and laughs.

In a way Im used to this. Once mom and I had a conversation that went like this.
Are mens penises really different from each other or are they mostly the same?
I practically fell off my chair. If I had been drinking anything I would have surely soaked her.
What? I really cant think of anything else to say.
Well, you know Ive only ever had sex with your father and Im curious.
Mom, I have not seen every penis on the earth. How should I know?
Well, youve been with more than one man. Whats it like??
OMG. Did my mother just call me a slut? How on earth am I going to answer her? Do I have to take this seriously or can I just not answer? So I just start laughing like crazy.
Youre insane. I tell her. And that was that. I never did tell her.

But the answer is a combination of both, fundamentally all penises are the same. If youve seen one, youve seen them all. There are some differences though as there is with anything. Kind of like noses. They are all different but are all functionally the same. But crap! What kind of question is that from ones mother??!! OMG.

When I was young, I have a faint memory of mom giving me the facts of life, but she dodged the heavy lifting by giving me a book. It was written by some Christian family counselor type dude and was pretty vague in a specific sort of way, if you know what I mean. Yeah, all the proper words were there; penis, vagina, marriage, tingly feeling, but the details were missing. For example; how wet the whole process actually is. I was really shocked the first time I saw a guy come. Damn it was freaking everywhere! Nothing prepared me for this. I love the movies where a couple finishes up and then just lie there together and talk or go to sleep or whatever. Total BS! No one wants to lay in the wet spot. Where is the towel??? A towel is an absolute must for me. The slow trickle does nothing for the mood, believe me.

Ok, ok, ok. TMI already. I know.

My dad has never mentioned sex to me in any way, shape or form. I remember that his dad couldnt even say the word pregnant. It was always in the family way to him. Maybe thats where dad gets it from. Ive never asked my brother how he found out about sex. I bet it wasnt dad. From moms embarrassing revelations, its clear that he enjoys the hell out of it, but wont talk about it. This is good since mom already drives me nuts.

I caught them only once. Im not exactly scarred since theyve always been pretty affectionate with each other in front of us kids. I was probably 16 or so and was completely mortified in the way that only a 16-year-old can be. I literally wanted to disappear into the earth when I next saw them. I dont think they were aware of my presence. Maybe they were. We never mentioned it. Thats probably for the best.

Mom told me she accidentally walked in on my brother after a shower and got an eyeful. He was probably 17 or 18 at the time, so it was super embarrassing for them both. One bit of info I did not need was the fact that he is apparently hung like a horse. TMI!!!!

So, at least my mom has loosened up a bit, but I wish shed find someone else to talk to about this stuff. Thorn 08-20-2003, 03:28 PM So I tried to give blood today. Tried. I&apos;m so mad.

The last time, I fainted way after the actual giving part, when I got up from eating my cookies. This time, I didnt even make it that far. As soon as the blood started flowing, I was out. They had to pull the needle and abandon the project.

I feel like such an ass. WTF? Why should my blood pressure drop that drastically? What a waste of time. I feel so stupid. As my blood type is kind of unusual, I thought it would be a good idea to give. Guess I was wrong. Not doing that again. The next time they call me to try to get me to go, Ill try to explain so they wont call me again. This sucks. I feel bad about it.

I was told that this isnt indicative of any sort of problem its just something that happens. Who knows? My bp was perfect 124/80, My resting pulse is in the neighborhood of 60. I just cant shake this feeling of inadequacy. I know its stupid, but I absolutely hate it when my body betrays me. It is a machine damn it. I keep it in good condition, feed it well, hydrate it, and exercise it. Why does it let me down? As if I dont have enough of that as it is. Oy vey.

And now for something completely different.

I have to launch this program in our company. It&apos;s something we&apos;re offering jointly with another company that approached us. Anyway, the person from the other company that I have to deal with on this was the CEO of the company I used to work for (for 8 years). It is so weird. He&apos;s a great guy with lots of charisma and I loved working with him at our old company. He left about 2 weeks before they laid me off. A lot of other people from our old company also work here with me, so on the way out he was bombarded with people wanting so say hi. I felt like part of some celebrity&apos;s entourage! Such a small world. Thorn 08-21-2003, 04:01 PM At the gym theyve just installed these new TVs all over the place that show this Golds Gym music channel crap. The music has always sucked in that place and the videos definitely arent helping. WTF is it with all these young chicks? They are virtually interchangeable. Same clothes (tacky, desperate for the only kind of attention they understand). Same hair (overcolored with the wind fan on high). Same voice (screecy/whiny). Same video (dancing in a tunnel/boxing ring/warehouse/fake futuristic club). Same dancing (overplayed lapdance, yawn). The guys arent any better. I am listening to some Macy Gray right now SHES different.

How can you tell who is who? They are all exactly the same. The minds of the young are definitely easily amused if they actually like this drivel.


Anyway. Having a sort of job crisis lately. The bottom line is I dont really like my job. Well, I dont like management to be specific. Things have changed and are about to change more and its not for the good. I get very little support and our department is ignored (not invited to larger dept meetings etc) unless it is to complain, berate or chastise. It really makes it hard to come in and feel the slightest bit enthusiastic. I guess Ill spend a couple of days next week on the phone to people I know and see what else is out there. I feel kind of bad because I didnt achieve what I wanted to with this job. And to make things worse, our hard drive crapped out and I lost my resume! It was good too dammit!


Does anyone else watch Monster House? I love that show. On the most recent episode, there was one guy who did zilch practically all week. He tried to weasel out of doing stuff and then when it was crunch time at the end, when everyone else is climbing on scaffolding in the middle of the night, hes standing around drinking a Coke. Anyway, I was struck by how much like The Leech he seemed to be. The Leech did the same thing; scaled down anything that smacked of real work or pawned off his work on other people. He also got offended when the people in charge of something didnt like his ideas; he would accuse them of being condescending when in fact, they just didnt agree with his idea and said to do it the way they said. When youre in charge, you get to do stuff like that. When youre not in charge, shut up and do what youre told. He could never learn that. Like the guy on the show, hes talented but a lazy complainer. Damn fools.

BSBG is the total opposite. For one, hes an engineer so is usually in charge. His ideas are well thought out and usually work the first time with no problems. Its that engineering stuff again. Secondly, he has an awesome work ethic. He goes the extra mile and would rather do things the right way than the easy way.

Hes my safety net. I am by no means a stupid or careless person, but when hes involved in anything I do, I dont feel as if I have to be totally on top of everything. I can let go. I trust him implicitly to hold up his end of things. Such a refreshing change after my early 20s where I virtually had to do all the heavy lifting with any project or plan or job. BSBG is the ultimate Boy Scout always prepared. He has every contingency covered and makes such good decisions that I dont have to try to second guess him.

Some may say that I let him control me. On the surface, from the outside, it may look like that, but its not. I just agree with his decisions and trust him to make good ones. Not just for him, but for me, too. And whatever is good for him is good for me, and what is good for me is good for him. We dont usually need or want different things and when we do, we err on the others side. Id rather have him happy because it makes me happy and saves me aggravation in the end. It sounds corny but it works. We look out for each other.

I am so looking forward to our vacation. Its not as though we have a particularly harsh or stressed life, though. And besides driving at Watkins Glen, were not doing anything special. After all the work we had done on the Beemers, we cant afford to do much else. Well probably go sit in the cars! Christmas will probably be a skinny one unless we can get the bills paid down; prepaid oil for winter, recent wedding w/2 night stay, home improvements and furnishings, and car improvements ugh. It never ends. We need to just stop for Sept, Oct and Nov. I just hope we have the discipline. But dammit, were practically out of chardonnay!! Oh I just love to say thatit sounds so snoot-ay. Oh Buff-ay, we&apos;re out of Chardonnay! Thorn 08-21-2003, 04:32 PM So last night I get up to pee. I&apos;m half out of it because it&apos;s like 1:30am. I never turn the lights on because I know where it is and there is enough ambient light for me not to trip and brain myself. So I just finish and am turning to flush when a figure steps into the doorway and screams. I scream.

It&apos;s BSBG - he didn&apos;t know I got up and freaked out at seeing me in the bathroom. We both had heart attacks. We were so out of it that we didn&apos;t even discuss it but now, I can&apos;t stop laughing.

I&apos;m so glad he didn&apos;t come in while I was still peeing - I probably would have fallen off the toilet and peed all over the floor! Thorn 08-27-2003, 05:23 PM Wow. That track is totally different from NHIS. I can really open up the car and let it fly. Got to well over 100mph in two places on each lap. It&apos;s a relaxed track that is easy on brakes and tires (yay). My instructor said it was very rare for students to get to go solo on their first time at a track, but both BSBG and I solo-ed on the second afternoon. It was awesome! It makes NHIS feel like a giant autocross as opposed to a racetrack.

NHIS is about 1/2 the size of Watkins Glen, but they have the same # of turns (11). Both have severe elevation changes too. But NHIS keeps the car in constant flux, and WG is more relaxed - you have time to think and plan your next corner. NHIS you have to react with much less time to think about things. Very different, but equally valuable. I think my car is too powerful for NHIS though. That was evident on my first lap around WG.

The event was well run and I found the classroom sessions with the Audi Quattro club to be more useful than with the BMW club I normally do this with. I&apos;ll have to make some suggestions. Conversely, there were some things that the Quattro club could do better that the BMW club does. Hopefully we can make both clubs events better. The good thing about WG though is that we don&apos;t have to flag!! Flagging can be so boring if you&apos;re at a dull corner.

I wonder why WG is such a pit though? I mean, it gets much more NASCAR business than NHIS does, but its way more run-down. The bathrooms are icky. There was trash blown around into bushes and corners and stuff. Things needed painting. The garages needed updating (bigger doors and air at each bay would be a step in the right direction). Weird. The track itself was great, but the facilities needed some money and work thrown at them.

No crashes. Just one spin out on turn 1 (a 90 degree right after a very long straight away) - no injuries to car or driver. And one mechanical failure that didn&apos;t result in sheet metal damage. So overall, a very good event. A big difference between the Audi club and the BMW club is the dearth of old cars at the Audi event. I really don&apos;t blame them - old Audis were crap, so who would keep them? Old Beemers on the other hand, were great cars so people do keep and run them on the track. More new Porsches at the Audi event, too. Drool. We get quite a few old Porsches at BMW events, but fewer new ones. Different mix w/the Audi club. No Ferraris, Lotuses or Lambos though. We usually get at least one at a BMW event. Once, someone showed up in a McLaren!!! Nice people. A shade less intensely wired than the Beemerphiles, but close. Not as wound as the Porsche guys either!

I had a great instructor. On my last run with her in the car, she was really quiet (we have communicators in the helmets). Then she pipes up to tell me that it&apos;s good that she wasn&apos;t talking. When she has to talk a lot it means that the student needs to be told (reminded) what to do. She said that she couldn&apos;t talk fast enough with her other student (a real track newbie). I looked on my student evaluation and saw lots of 10s and a few 9s and 9.5s (10 being best). Woo hoo! I knew I was a good driver, but it&apos;s nice to get affirmation that I am.

Sometimes when I blow corners or have trouble getting the line, I feel stupid. I feel especially pressured as a woman sometimes. That the guys are looking at me like I&apos;m an idiot because I&apos;m a woman. That I&apos;ll never get as good as they are or that I&apos;ll never measure up. Mostly that&apos;s in my head. I&apos;ve never gotten anything but encouragement from all the guys in the classes and all my instructors (all men up until yesterday). But secretly, us women always suspect that men really don&apos;t believe we are as good as a man at what we&apos;re doing. Especially something so macho as track driving and souped up cars. Like I said, its mostly in my head, but its something Im very aware of. Usually when we get in our cars, its an equalizing effect. I pass and get passed, so does everyone else.

I have to say that I love passing people! At these driving schools, there are rules about passing. First you have to be given a signal to pass (called a point by) from the car in front of you (the passee) before you can. Second, it has to be in an approved passing zone. The instructor and event coordinators tell you where these are. Sometimes, a newbie will give a signal to pass in a non-passing zone or will give one too late in the passing zone. This is kind of an unplanned test of the student being given the point by. If you take it, its you that is in the wrong, not the person who gave it. Equally bad is to pass without the point by. Its dangerous and bad form. If you dont get the point by, suck it up or get on their ass more at the next passing zone!

I let people by. There are better drivers and faster cars. My biggest peeve is with bad or inexperienced drivers in faster cars. Im always up their asses in the turns but on the straights I cant catch them and some of them are too stupid or egotistical to let me go by. This happens on bikes as well as cars. Luckily my car is pretty powerful, but sometimes I have to deal with a hothead in a new Porsche or Firebird or whatever and they really bug me. You kind of need to be on someone&apos;s ass to get a point by. You&apos;ve got to fill their rear view mirror. I can&apos;t do this if they walk away from me in the straights. Sometimes I have my instructor have a little chat with their instructor. If the flaggers are good they will blue flag the offending car and then I can usually get by. A blue flag pointed at you means that there is a faster car behind you and you need to give them a point by.

Flags are another big test of the student. You have to pay attention to where the flaggers are on the course and what the flags mean. Obviously the checkered flag means the end of the session, but there are also yellow flags, blue flags, red and yellow striped flags, black flags and back flags with an orange circle. You have to see them and know what youre supposed to do. A trick to remembering where they are is to wave at each flagger on your warm up lap. They like this (as a sometimes flagger, I can relate.). Also wave a thank you on the cool-down lap.

Newbies sometimes don&apos;t know how to get on or off the track safely either, so dealing with them is also another unplanned test. This happened to me a couple of times. They get off line of where they are supposed to be and get in your way. Closing speed becomes really apparent then!! But my instructor said I handled them very well and made good choices. Once someone forced me off line (off the race line) and I compensated very well and stayed off line. It&apos;s dangerous to start a corner off line and then try to finish it on line. Sure it means you lose the set up for the next couple of corners, but if you blow a turn, just regroup and get back on line when it is safe. I&apos;m so proud of myself that I could do this coolly and without hesitation. I think it was one of the reasons I got to solo.

I got to go out with 2 different instructors in their cars! I love to do that. You can really see how consistency and smoothness is the key. They were both very experienced drivers. One had a car I envy an E30 M3. Its the model series before mine the original M3. Great cars.

Anywaythats it in a nutshell. My first ever track event at Watkins Glen. We will be back. I wish we lived closer!

On the way home we stopped and got some provisions. We had pretty run of the mill (bordering on bad) food out in NY. WG is in the sticks (they think they&apos;re wine country though!) and the pickings for dining are pretty slim. So we got some wine, olives, cheese, bread, proccuitio, fresh tomatoes (still on the vine) and will have a feast later! Thorn 08-30-2003, 09:37 AM Sitting here listening to the soundtrack to Pulp Fiction. What a great movie that is. Its too bad that he made it so early, now everything by comparison is crap. Jackie Brown was OK, but it was no Pulp Fiction. I dont hold out much hope for Kill Bill either. I mean, it has Uma Thurman in it so no academy awards there.

Anyway. Whenever I come back from a couple or more days away, I have a dread peculiar to my situation. I dread that my little kitty Scribble will be dead or in a very bad way. She has cancer. She was diagnosed in May. The tumor is huge and is filling her chest; pushing on her little heart and lungs and even her esophagus. She has a hard time breathing and swallows a lot. Shes been on prednisone since her diagnosis. It has helped, symptom wise.

We lost our dog, Magnum, to cancer a few years ago and we know the spiraling signs of death from it. Scribble is still a little way from that. She still eats and is still interested in life. She was just here on my weird stackable footstools, looking for attention. But, she doesnt have the energy to fix up her fur much and she has begun to develop some awful mats. Were going to have to take the clippers to her soon.

Scribble was a stray. I had seen her in the neighborhood a few times. Once under one of our birdfeeders. Once she wouldnt get out of the way in the road. I had to get out of my car and pick her up and carry her to the yard. She was sitting literally a foot from my bumper. Did not care. Completely stupid. If I had been one of those creepy/schitzo cat-haters, she would have been done for. Then I saw her again on my deck (under another birdfeeder) and she looked really bad. Her entire coat was matted and had twigs and leaves stuck in it. She also had this weird little worm-like growth on her left ear. I coaxed her in with some crunchies and took her to the vet. She checked out fine then. We found the cancer on her 1-year check up.

We think that she was abandoned here when someone moved. I dont know how people can be so callous. Sure she was surviving out there, but she wasnt thriving and definitely wouldnt have lived through last winter. I think she likes it here despite the Orange Menace known as Chuck. Chuck is my 11-year-old cat. He hates every cat he has ever met besides his mother and littermates. At first these two fought (once he made her bleed!), but now they just avoid each other and have the occasional staring contest that ends in a hissing fit. Its funny when they just make air-raid siren noises at each other. The bullying is equal opportunity though dont think that just because Chuck is precisely twice her size that he is in charge. Nope. She goes for him sometimes and he runs. Way funny. Its character building.

Now The Rocky Horror Picture Show soundtrack is on. Aimee, if you read this the stage production is called The Rocky Horror Show, the movie is the Picture Show. I hope you get the part. Ill bet its a really fun production to be in.

Ive only been to a crazed midnight showing once. I didnt get dressed up but a lot of other people did. This was about 16 or 17 years ago when I was 17 or 18, so I cant remember much of it. I remember I had never seen the movie before so it was a really surreal experience. I didnt understand any of the bits with the toast and the toilet paper and the rubber gloves. But I laughed and drank and my love of RH began. BSBG doesnt get it. I think its too weird for him. He sometimes claims the straight guy role to the extreme. He says the same thing about the Hitchhikers Guide series that its too geeky even for him. As if! Hes an engineer and an RPI grad. Nothing is too geeky for him.

They may do some more.folk dancing!

Tim Curry was genius in this. We could take in an old Steve Reeves mov-ay.

My unconventional convetionalists, I just lip-synched that whole song.

******************************************************************************************
Just now I read the Great things about being a Gal thread. How sensitive and on the defensive everyone is. There must be a lot of PMing going on, either that or rampant paranoia. It also occurred to me that the original post was pretty singular in that it ascribed to the ancient premise that a woman is only valuable for how she looks rather than who she is. But I dont think that was the intent. It could be read that way, sure, but that doesnt make the assumption correct. After lurking here for months, I didnt think that Ben meant it that way. So I didnt post about it. Restraint and thinking before one posts could avoid a lot of emotional kneejerks and vitriol. Unless you all like that kind of thing. It makes for interesting reading, thats for sure. Adds to the voyeuristic thrill we all get from reading on this site.

Being a woman is complicated. Thats not to say that being a man isnt, but I think being a woman is more so. Especially now. Roles and choices are expanding. Biology and cultural ties are still strong though, and many of the two do not mesh well. For example; I find it interesting that couples choose to have children and then give them to strangers to raise 8-12 hours a day. What is more important; the way your child is raised or your job? Women really make strange choices. Oh but the second income is needed to survive, you say. Well, if you really need that second income, you cant afford a child dont have one until you can. Seems simple to me. I feel bad that single mothers cant avoid having strangers raise their kids.

My parents muddled through. Mom didnt work outside the home until I was in high school and my brother was in junior high. It wasnt easy. Dad didnt make a lot of money and we didnt have every new thing under the sun. But mom was there and I think that strengthened us somehow. Gave us a constant. I am thankful for it. And slightly amazed. I asked my mom if she minded and she said absolutely not. She loved hanging out with her kids (except when we were being brats or fighting).

Wellthe sun is shiningIm outta here. Thorn 08-31-2003, 08:40 AM Last night while watching Catch Me if You Can, I was reminded of a couple I knew 12-15 years ago. They were in their 70s then. He was a WW2 veteran. He went to France late in the war and while he did see some action, he was mostly involved in the aftermath of war.

One day he and his company were moving towards their target; a prison camp set up by the Nazi sympathizers for French citizens. It was still heavily defended and they had to go on the attack. No air support since it was a prison and they didnt want to kill any innocent citizens. The only action I can visualize comes from the few war movies I have seen. I can imagine the sweat and the confusion and the fear. Guns firing and people yelling.

Eventually, the enemy forces are broken and the Nazi sympathizers are either killed or rounded up. This leaves the men free to storm the camp and open the cells and free the people. My elderly friend was one of these. He charged into a cellblock with his buddies and began unlocking cells. Inside one tiny, cement cubicle, crouched on the floor with her mother and sister, was a young French girl.

He says that he knew in one instant that he found the girl for him. She says that one look at his amazing blue eyes and blonde hair and American soldiers uniform and she fell instantly in love. He pulled her up and gathered her mother and sister to him and walked them out past their captors into the light of day. She spoke no English, he no French. Another soldier interpreted their first tentative conversations.

Eventually they learned enough of each others language to talk and when he left France, she came with him as his wife. Isnt that amazing??? I swear this is a true story. They were still in love almost 50 years later. Totally devoted to each other. And he still had those amazing blue eyes. Thorn 09-01-2003, 10:16 AM It drives me crazy when people blame the motorcycle for accidents. Or say they hate motorcycles. Do you hate cars because people crash them? Do you hate banana peels because people slip on them? Do you hate ovens because people burn themselves? A woman I used to work with once said to me that she would never get on a motorcycle because her son crashed one and they are dangerous.

Is this the same one that got in a car accident last year? I asked.
Yeah. She says.
Do you still drive your car?
Its not the same thing. She insists.
Yeah, right. It is precisely the same thing.

Most motorcycle accidents occur for one of two reasons;
1. Stupidity/incompetence/arrogance of the motorcycle driver
2. Stupidity/disrespect/incompetence of the driver of a car

Starting slow, taking lessons and building skill will remedy the first. Being aware of your surroundings and driving like everyone is out to kill you, will help with the second. Wearing proper protective gear will help if the first two are overruled by a twist of fate.

I have been riding for YEARS and have great respect for my machine; its limits, my limits and a paranoid awareness of everything around me.

Most people drive cars on autopilot. They cruise around in a little bubble of false safety, hoping that someone else is being careful. Theyre oblivious and have no idea about vehicle dynamics or how their vehicle performs (or doesnt perform more likely). Theyre morons and shouldnt be allowed to drive. Here in the US, we consider driving a right, not a privilege and it gets us in a lot of trouble.

Motorcyclists have to be hyper aware of everything. When people are in a car with me, they are amazed that I see things way before they do and comment on them. This happens whether I am driving or not. When I see a potential ugly up ahead, I can avoid it or tell the driver how to avoid it (hey, theres a car trying to turn left about 50 yards up and is blocking traffic, get in the right lane). The driver is always amazed that I saw that. This is how I drive. This is how I always drive. But I know that no one else does, so I can compensate for their stupidity. I give myself room and know what&apos;s going on.

So, lack of awaremess is the first problem. The second is lack of skill. They dont know how to ride. They dont know anything about weight displacement, counter steering, braking, tires or closing speeds. They think its a toy. An amusement ride. Its so easy for a young person to get a bike that is way too powerful for them to handle at first. The thought of starting with a 250cc or even a 500cc just mortifies their adolescent egos. Nope; gotta start with a GSXR 1100 with more horsepower than their first car.

Then theyll get on the thing in jeans and a t-shirt. No helmet. Well, with brains that weak, I guess they dont have much to protect. No big loss.

I used to work with a woman who finally got her own motorcycle after years of riding behind her husband. She refused to wear a helmet. Her argument was that if she got into a crash, she wanted to be dead not a vegetable. WTF kind of argument is that? I&apos;m sorry, but my sense of self-preservation is a bit sharper than that. The anti-helmet league likes to trot out the tiny # of cases where there was enough head trauma to render a person comatose but not dead. They completely ignore the thousands of cases where the helmet saved the life and there was no brain injury.

Now, stop thinking about split open skulls for a second here. Thats not the problem. The skull is pretty hard to smash. No, what youre trying to do by wearing a helmet is to slow down the rate at which the brain is traveling through the tiny amount of room it has inside your skull. When you are rushing forward at 30, 40 or 50+ mph and suddenly hit a solid object, your brain is going to slosh up against the inside of your head at that same speed. Thats what kills you. The material inside a helmet is designed to absorb this shock and energy and keep your brain and skull from absorbing it. Thats what a helmet is for and thats why it works.

Of course there is also the skull-splitting thing.

A friend of mine, lets call him Mark, got a call from another friend who wanted to go riding. Mark said sure. The friend insisted that Mark wear a helmet. He usually didnt and the friend didnt want to ride if Mark didnt wear one. Mark gave in and they set out for the nearest curvy road.

A few miles into their ride and theyre making this blind left-hand turn, almost a sweeper the kind of turn that you can really get into with the throttle. Mark is behind his friend. As soon as he clears the curve he sees a pick up truck smack in his lane. His friend has enough room to get by with both wheels on the pavement. This startles the driver into jerking the wheel and putting him even farther into the oncoming lane. Mark has no room and has to go off the pavement. When he does, he shears off one of those retaining cables used to reinforce telephone poles. It whips forward hitting Mark in the head and throwing him from the bike. By this time hes in soft sand and most of his speed is gone. He tumbles and the bike stalls.

When he gets up, he discovers that his helmet has been split in two starting at just behind the ears. If he hadnt been wearing the helmet, he would have been decapitated. All he had that day was a bruise, a scraped cylinder head and a bent foot peg and handlebar.

He showed me that helmet, years later. It was the first of many he obsessively bought and wore whenever he got on a bike.

Once, I was at a gas station filling up the bike. Some guy and his chick come in on some rice rocket. While hes off doing whatever, she comes over to talk to me. She is wearing shorts and a bikini top. She asks me why I ride with all that stuff on. Doesnt it make me too hot?

Not really. Its worth it.
Nothing is worth that. She says.
I have an idea. Why dont you go down to the end of the pump island and take a running start and then slide on your belly down over there. I point to the parking lot.
No way! That would really hurt and Id be all torn up.
Just think of how it will feel when your boyfriend doesnt make that next corner.
Her eyes got real big and she started mumbling that I was right. Then she turned around and started yelling at her boyfriend that she wanted to go home. True story. I love messing with people.

I mean, Ive fallen on my knee while just walking and torn my jeans. Why the hell do people think denim going to take 70mph on pavement?? Broken ankles are my favorite. Its the most commonly broken bone associated with motorcycles. Nahboots are too uncomfortable. Hows that cast buddy? Thorn 09-02-2003, 06:31 PM Why did I start this journal?
Because it looked like fun.

What do I get out of it?
A chance to air my views, track my memories, log my thoughts and get some feedback on occasion. Validation is something we all crave.

Will I continue this even if I do not use this board for publishing?
Maybe. If I can find a host that is to my liking, I will switch.

Why do I like this site as host?
Flexibility of post content.
Relatively mature user community.
Anonymity
Its free
Easy to use

Why cant I use my paper-bound journal instead?
Because its time consuming to handwrite everything.

Why cant I just keep this on my computer?
I write everything in Word before I paste it into the online format. I keep it, too. There are some entries I have done from work and those I will have to copy into this Word. This may work better in the long run, although I will miss the PM function. And of course I will miss some of the other journals.

It has been interesting to read other peoples lives. My own reactions and opinions on things are of course, right and correct (aren&apos;t everyone&apos;s?), but I am fascinated by other viewpoints. Sometimes the way people react to things is totally surprising. The way other people live their lives is interesting and makes me think.

I guess I should do some browsing of the legitimate journal sites to see if any of them will fit my needs if I decide that a more public forum is what I need.

Thanks to everyone who has read this so far. I appreciate it. Sorry to get so preachy sometimes I just cant stay away from that damn soapbox. Thorn 09-03-2003, 05:14 PM Recently read a book called Year of Wonders A novel of the plague, by Geraldine Brooks. Despite the contrived ending, it is an excellent read.

It is the story of a small village in northern England (about 350 people) and how they cope when plague arrives. Anna, a maid in the house of the rector and his wife, tells the story. Anna is quite possibly the most truly good person in fiction I have ever read. At times I wondered if she was human. No matter how many people did her wrong or betrayed her or hurt her, she forgave and did them a good turn. Clearly this person was not modeled on me.

Actually, the book is based on a true story. The plague year 1666 in the village of Eyam was pretty well documented. The inhabitants decided to sequester themselves inside the boundaries of the village. This way they wouldnt spread the disease. Memories of the plague years from centuries ago were still fresh. They knew they would be persecuted as pariahs if they infected others. Well, everyone agreed except the richest family in town they left. They could have helped the village by remaining, but in their selfishness, they abandoned the people.

Left to their own devices, they went through this cycle that Ive read is pretty common. Disbelief. At first they thought it was just a rumor. Then a couple of people died. Then they got religion and began to pray. When that didnt work, they blamed the two local healer women and killed them because they were witches. When that didnt help they turned to superstition (I guess killing the witches didnt keep the devil away after all) and magic charms. When that didnt help they went into a period of doing nothing. More and more people died 2/3 of the village in the end. Then someone suggested that they burn their possessions in a great fire in the square. Reluctantly, they did. After that, the incidents of plague decreased and eventually stopped.

I felt intense dislike/disgust for the villagers and their stupidity when they killed the healer women. WTF?? Their ignorance of everything that we know now turned them into such brutes. The two people who were vital to the ongoing heath of the village were the first ones blamed for the plague. Does that make any kind of sense??? What is with these people?? My anger is intense because I know this kind of thing really went on. Hundreds of innocent women died at the hands of brutal thugs, blinkered by their ignorance and hatred.

Then I have to stop and consider these people were desperate. They were scared. They had no idea why the plague had come and grasped at anything to try to stem the tide. Superstition ruled their lives. They had no other context for the inexplicable. I feel bad for all of them and wonder at how we survived those dark times. The second witch to be killed did an interesting thing; she shouted back to the mob that their women joined her in her dance with the devil and her black magic. As soon as she was dead, the men turned on these women their wives, mothers, sisters and daughters and accused them of the very same things. If a sensible person hadnt stepped in to explain that Anys was just using the only weapon she had left. They smartened up and didnt lynch the rest of the women in the village. The things she said were taken from an actual record of a witchs confession. Chilling.

On the positive side, the surrounding communities were very supportive of this little village. Along the boundary walls were set up areas where things could be left for the plague village; food, clothing, etc. In exchange, the villagers would leave money or lead that came from their mines. It was in the other villages best interests to support the plague victims because they knew if they didnt, the villagers could leave and go straight through their communities, infecting everyone for miles around. It was great to see the cooperation and respect between them.

The memory of this story will stay with me. Every time I read a book like this, I am sooooo thankful that I was born in the latter half of the 20th century!!! Oh the difficult and dangerous lives these people had. Makes me ashamed of myself when I am too lazy to load the stupid dishwasher! Thorn 09-04-2003, 11:28 AM I had a very weird thing happen at the library yesterday.

Im reading the Masters of Rome series from Colleen McCullough. Im on book 4 Caesar. Ive just reached the part where Caesar is entrenched with his army in longhaired Gaul. Like Tiberius will do 100 years later, Caesar is playing one tribe off the other and fighting them individually. Just like the Greeks, the various tribes in Gaul fought each other constantly. This is an enormous advantage for Rome. One of the tribal leaders, Vercingetorix, gets the idea that if the tribes banded together, their larger numbers would be impossible for the Roman army to defeat. He succeeds to a degree and becomes a huge pain in the butt for Caesar before he is ultimately defeated.

So anywayIm heading towards the check out desk with my books and theres a bit of a line. So I hang back and check out the new releases. While casually scanning, The Druid King catches my eye. I open it to read the synopsis and you could have knocked me down with a feather. It was the life story of Vercingetorix. Freaked me out. Of course I had to get the book. Im going to wait until Im a tiny bit further along in Caesar to tackle it, but isnt that weird?? A few weeks ago, I wouldnt have had a clue who Vercingetorix was. Apparently, he is a hero of some note in ancient French history. Kind of like the way Leif Ericsson is to Scandinavians.

AnywayI just thought this was a creepy little occurrence.

Ta. Thorn 09-05-2003, 04:35 PM I spotted a movie title that looked familiar last night while scrolling through the channels Ripleys Game. Its an adaptation of the Patricia Highsmith (one of my favorite authors) novel and it stars John Malkovich. I watched it on IFC last night. It was great. That is a rare accolade from me. I was absolutely mesmerized by JM. He is hypnotic in this movie. Hypnotic in the same way he was in Dangerous Liaisons. Oh man. He is still so sexy. He just has this animal magnetism about him that is like a gravitational field for me. I dont consider him handsome, but help me - he is attractive. Meowrrrr.

The movie sticks close to the books particulars, although it does lose some plot points that are more emphatic in the novel. One thing that was interesting is that its not set in the 1960s, which is when I think the novel is set. Instead, the director puts Ripley in the present day. It works though, so I dont have an issue with that choice. I havent watched The Talented Mr. Ripley because I like the book too much.

Thats a loose rule I have. If I really enjoyed a book, I refuse to see the movie. There are some exceptions, but not many. Not only does this save me from a lot of crappy movies, but also keeps the pictures in my head pure. Take Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil for example. It is a favorite (I even have a signed, limited edition) and even though I love Kevin Spacey, I refuse to see the movie. Its bad enough that I actually have to know that KS played Jim Williams, so now he is all I picture when I read it, but Im not going to have all the other characters replaced in my head. Even the lovely and talented Chablis appearing as herself doesnt tempt me.

This doesnt always happen to me though. For example, I can still read Interview With The Vampire and The Vampire Lestat without seeing Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt (both HORRIBLE choices for those roles).

Im so mad that I stopped and watched a couple of minutes of The Stand, because now all I can see in my head is Gary Sinese! Damn. I hate that. I had my own image of The Walkin Dude but now thats gone. Hannibal Lecter has been replaced by Anthony Hopkins. And so it goes.

No big plans for the weekend. Maybe a little hiking. Ride the Ducati a bit. Homemade pizza tonight! BSBG makes killer pizza.

TTFN. Thorn 09-07-2003, 07:04 PM Dire Straits what a band. Im sitting here listening to their debut album and am of the opinion that it is a masterpiece. They were incredible. Waterline. Water of Love. Sultans of Swing. Man. They dont make bands like this anymore. And they dont make guitarists like Mark Knopfler anymore either.

I am sad that the era of the guitar god is over. At least I think it is. Im old, and I dont listen to new music so maybe I missed some mystical wonderman with the guitar. I doubt it.

Even when I was young, I idolized the guitar man. Eric Clapton was my first taste of godhood. He was amazing. I wish that he hadnt lost his amps somewhere in the 80s. He sure could use them now.

Eddie VanHalen. Oh man. I am a hardcore, old VanHalen fan. I hated VanHagar. Give me Diamond Dave any day. Fools has to be the best VanHalen song ever. I have everything they ever did on vinyl and on CD. What a band. I wasnt even offended by Oh Pretty Woman either. I think they did Roy justice.

Stevie Ray Vaughan. I am very privileged to have seen him twice in concert. The last time I saw him was about a month before his death. On that day, I was working and got a call from my boyfriend Dan. The first words out of his mouth were
Are you sitting down?
Why? I asked. Who died?
Stevie Ray Vaughan.
I cried for two days.
I remember the first time I ever heard his version of Voodoo Chile, Slight Return. It was on the radio and I was mesmerized. I thought that someone must have found some old Hendrix tapes buried in a studio somewhere. Then I heard him sing. This isnt Jimi, I thought. I absolutely had to hear who it was. When the announcer said it was SRV I was floored. I had almost worn out my tape of Texas Flood. I still have that cassette. Its held together by tape, but it still works.

Remember Randy Rhodes? Man he was a virtuoso. It is a genuine shame that he was so young and didnt make many records with Ozzy. I think I read somewhere that he would either take lessons on the road, or if he couldnt find anyone to study with, would give lessons. Classical guitar in either case.

Slash is the last of the guitar heroes, I think. For a glorified garage band, Guns -n- Roses was great. Slash has real talent. Too bad hes fucking around with a solo career that hasnt really gone anywhere. Slashs Snake Pit? Surprisingly, theyre not very good.

It seems to me that everything today is just bubble gum pop, rap or sound-alike, bland light rock. How can you have a guitar hero in all that fatuous crap? These people dont seem to be artists to me. Theyre more interested in money and fame than they are in music or songwriting. I almost wish that their predecessors werent so successful. The 80s set a bad precedent. Morons with more hairspray than talent got rich and famous. Now every idiot with a bellybutton ring who uses blowjobs like currency can get famous. Makes me sad. No wonder every time I go to buy CDs theyre usually 20 years old! The only new bands I like are Queens of the Stone Age, Tool (not really new) and Chevelle.

They just dont make bands like The Who anymore. Or Led Zeppelin. Or Queen. Its a shame that REM changed so much. Same with The Chili Peppers. David Bowie though, remains excellent although Diamond Dogs is still my favorite. Neil Young continues to put out quality pretty much all the time, too. I really wish Rob would get White Zombie back together, but his solo stuff will do. I miss Primus. And Social Distortion. And the old days of The Mighty Mighty Bosstones. My favorite ZZ Top album is still Tres Hombres.

Anywayenough showing my age. I have a new boss tomorrow and Im dreading it. From all indications, it will not be pretty. My interim boss is kind of a jerk. When she is done talking to you she just turns around in her chair and starts reading email or something. No goodbye. No wrap up. No thanks. Just turns around. Its the rudest thing Ive ever seen. Rumor has it the new boss is a friend of hers. Help me if they are at all alike. I already have agents combing Monster, thats how optimistic I am. I know, its probably not the best way to enter into a new relationship, but I think its better to be proactive and find a new job before I totally lose it with my current one.

I really wish I could get a job in the motorcycle industry or with BMW motorcars. Chances of that happening are pretty slim since my expertise lies elsewhere. But my passion is with those areas. I would love to work for a motorcycle manufacturer (oh Ducati would just be a dream!) and work on programs for women riders. The ones they have now are sooo girly and lame. I think they miss part of their audience mainly me! Local dealerships can do a lot to encourage women riders and increase their business, but many of them dont. The fastest growing demographic among motorcycling is women. Old-school, male-run dealerships often alienate women unknowingly. Bad for business. Oh well, maybe someday. Thorn 09-08-2003, 08:54 AM I held it in until I was alone and then I wept. I knew this day would come. A world with no Warren Zevon. I have this horrible lump in my chest. Sorrow is heavy.

We just played Life&apos;ll Kill Ya and The Wind back to back yesterday...the day he died. It is awful. And so not fair. Why can&apos;t Bono step in front of a train? Why won&apos;t Bon Jovi overdose or something? People who have been polluting my brain for years!! Damn them!!! Now my fantasy of WZ and Les Claypool making an album together will never be realized. How great would that have been??

Goodbye Warren. I will miss you. You were a genius.

If you don&apos;t believe me, listen to Excitable Boy in it&apos;s entirety. What a voice. Lyrics like that just don&apos;t exist anymore. Perfect musicianship.

Damn.

Damn.

Damn.

I know what&apos;s going on the turntable when I get home. Thorn 09-08-2003, 04:56 PM I dont do it. Im paranoid about spy programs and just dont get into enough new music to be bothered.

It is stealing.

I buy a lot of used CDs. This does nothing to benefit the artist either. And its not illegal.

I felt slightly guilty when I copied a whole bunch of CDs from my brother.

Only slightly guilty because most of what I copied was old music. Like The Doors or CCR. When the artist is dead or the band is broken up, I dont feel so guilty.

I see buying music as an investment. An investment in the future of a band that will make more music that I like. If the band is gone or the artist is dead, there is no future music and my investment will only go to an heir or music publishing company that has no ability to produce more music for me.

So, when I bought Elvis - 30 #1 Hits, it was used. I really dont think Lisa Marie needs my money (or deserves any for that matter, it was her father I wanted to hear, not her).

More artists should make their music available on the web. I have no issues paying an artist for their work. The recording industry is the problem. I dont think they are worth the cut they get. Maybe the artists should be the ones to decide that, but the people have definitely spoken.

The RIAA can sue all they want; I dont think they can stop this. Thorn 09-09-2003, 10:54 AM I feel a tiny bit guilty about last night. All he has to do is come near me sometimes. There is this electric communication that tells me this is not merely a goodnight caress. He knows exactly where to touch me and how. It makes me melt. I am useless after that. Usually I am a more active participant than I was last night, so he didnt really mind that I just lay there and let him take us to another place.

Question for you men out there who actually read this weirdness. If you are engaged in heavy foreplay playing with her more than she is playing with you, do you get bored? I have always thought that feeling the signs of arousal in your partner was incredibly powerful. I know I get turned on, so I think that for guys it would be the same.

I am soooo glad that BSBG is a bodybuilder. At work, Im surrounded my tubby little men with potbellies, fat-slab shoulders and man boobs. Ugh. I cant even imagine it. BSBG has a 31 waist and a 46 chest. He has carved shoulders and pecs. Great thighs and a 6-pack (if you can find it under all the fuzz!). Hell be 40 in January and has the body of a man his age. Its one of the major reasons that I work out so that he can be as proud of me as I am of him and that he can still lust me after all these years.

Ok OkIm done! I am just giddily, swimmingly, sensuously happy today. Thorn 09-11-2003, 10:15 AM Had to take my big orange cat to the vet yesterday. Abscess. He was probably fighting again. Its on the top of his hip, just in front of his tail on the right side. Either he needs to kick more ass or run faster! Hes always a big hit at the vet, being such a handsome boy. He likes to get out of the carrier and wander around the waiting area. A guy was in with a 6-month-old boxer who was very curious about the Orange Menace. Very calmly, they sniffed and then went their separate ways. Phew. The Orange Menace is not a small cat (15 pounds in summer, 16 in winter) and has huge paws and claws I had visions of him ripping open the boxers little nose.

Anyway. 2 years ago we were enjoying our last moments of innocence (its 8:30 as I write this). I was in a Microsoft training class when the attack came. Another student was on the net and saw on CNN that a plane had hit the WTC. We all thought it was a mechanical failure. A horrible tragedy, but not frightening. Then when the 2nd plane crashed, the dread hit. The fear that this was something bigger. The instructor still insisted it was mechanical failure. 2 planes guy? At the same time? Crashing into the same building complex? Yeah, and I got a bridge to sell ya.

After the Pentagon crash, the company basically shut down. Everyone was gathered in the cafeteria in front of a TV management had set up for us. We were all shocked and slightly disoriented. Disbelief was the overwhelming emotion. I just couldnt believe this was happening. We were being attacked on our own soil! Never in my life did I think anyone would hurt us here. The US has always been safe. Secure. I always felt protected. I wasnt used to feeling vulnerable.

By 2:00 pretty much everyone had gone home for the day. People were ultra polite and caring towards one another. Speeds on the highway were visibly lower. People didnt cut each other off. Patience was at an all time high. I was glued to the TV for the rest of the day. Even though it was horrific, I couldnt stop watching. My heart broke. I cried off and on. Random tears. I just wanted to be with BSBG and try to understand how my world had changed.

That awful, empty feeling of fear and dread was quickly replaced with anger. Who the fuck do these people think they are? Just who do they think theyre fucking with? Were the United States the most powerful military nation on earth wtf are you thinking?? Were going to bomb the shit out of you. Are you happy now? Glad that you poked the lion with a stick? I admit to wrathful glee when I watched the bombing of Afghanistan. How do you like it? Did that solve your problems? Backward, twisted, intolerant religious freaks. Oh yeah, I can still get mad.

To this day, I cannot look at footage or photos of the towers. Yesterday on my drive home while listening to a talk radio show, I started to cry while listening to the host talk about 9/11. It is still too painful. I can only imagine what it was like to be in NYC or DC on that day. Everyone involved bystanders, police, firemen and emergency workers they all performed amazingly well. I was proud of them and I still am. They were calm and collected and rational and humane.

On 9/13 I was laid off my job. Sensitive huh? I was still kind of shell-shocked from 9/11, so my own personal tragedy didnt seem so bad. My boss came into my office and shut the door. He never did that before, so I knew something was up. I looked up at him and said I dont have a job anymore, do I? And he just nodded. We were pretty close and I think he was more broken up about it than I was.

So with all my free time, I was able to watch a lot of the news coverage of the event. Over and over and over I watched the 2 crashes and the aftermath of the Pentagon and the true heroes of flight 93. I will never forget it.

This experience makes me wonder how the citizens of Israel can stand the stress. They are under constant terrorist attack. Each side seems bent on revenge but each act of revenge sparks another act of revenge. Its unbelievably stupid. Neither side will back down. Neither side will see reason. Why dont they just kill everyone and have it over with? End it once and for all.

I watched the WZ InsideOut special again on VH1. I cried when they showed him recording Keep Me In Your Heart. It is SO unfair. I want him back. I know its a little ridiculous for me to feel this strongly. I dont know whats come over me. Thorn 09-12-2003, 03:19 PM I&apos;m all out today!

Why do cops try and save suicide attempters? I have always found this a strange practice. Go save someone who doesnt want to die why dont you? How big will the loss of this one person be, after all? There are literally billions of us so each and every one of us is pretty much replaceable. Not in the sense that there is someone exactly like us out there, but in the sense that our contribution to society can be easily replaced 9 times out of 10.

I cant think of a single social issue that cant be put down to over breeding. There are just too damn many of us for any of us to be irreplaceable on a social/civic level. It makes me sad. I love reading about small towns or tribes or villages where every person played a vital role in the function and survival of the community. Everyone felt special and needed and vital. Everyone was important and relied upon. Responsibility can be a very empowering thing. Most people behave very unselfishly when they are responsible for something larger than themselves.

Anyway, I gotta get out of this mood! Thorn 09-16-2003, 04:32 PM I am so sick of these articles and studies that talk about how obese Americans are and how its not getting any better. Well no shit. Most of the people that I know are so freaking lazy that they can barely walk to the printer that is 12 feet away! I dont want to hear it. If youre fat and out of shape and do nothing about it, dont whine to me. I dont care. I go to the gym every day and I dont fill my body with crap every day. It doesnt take a genius to figure that out. People are told that a good diet and exercise are the only way to lose weight, but they dont have the willpower to carry it out. Thats not my problem. Stay fat. Be unhappy. Die young. I dont care. Just dont make me look at you too much, ok? Damn!

Another thing thats been really pissing me off is this California Recall Election. If it were the Democrats lining up to kick a Republican out of office, they wouldnt care if the ballots were drawn on stone tablets! Hypocritical assholes. And if I were a Latino or other minority in southern CA, I would be freaking insulted by the ACLUs rationale for getting the equally biased state Supreme Court to delay this recall.

Basically theyre saying that the minority voters are too stupid to operate the voting machines properly.

&quot;The ACLU said the punch-card system could disenfranchise voters in six counties, including Los Angeles, the state&apos;s largest. Those six counties include 44 percent of state voters and have heavy concentrations of minority voters.&quot;- CNN

If these machines were really so outdated and flawed, wouldnt they want them replace for everyone, not just minorities? I guess not everyone is stupid enough to need this caring action of the ACLU. Fuck. What a bunch of assholes.

Other than thatthings have been good. Went to a birthday party for my ex-boss on Saturday. It was a surprise and boy was he ever. People he hasnt seen in 10 years showed up and he was floored. Everyone got a little misty at his speech of thanks and love to all. He gets a bit carried away when hes drunk a bottle and a half of wine! I didnt drink that much, but BSBG still had to drive home. Didnt want to crash the FLC. Did zilch on Sunday except a bit of clutter clearing, made beef jerky, made apple crisp, drank beer and wine with a great meal and watched a movie.

We watched Immortal Beloved. Id never seen it before and liked Amadeus a lot so I figured what the hell. Plus it had Gary Oldman. It was sad, but not as intense as I thought it could be. It seemed that the actors were just going through the motions to some extent. The performances in Amadeus just seemed so much more poignant to me. {shrug}. I think the enduring mystery of the identity of the Immortal Beloved is really interesting though. The way they portray it in the movie is probably as good an explanation as any. There is a fine line between love and hate. If Ludwig treated his sister in law that harshly, I can see that it might stand to reason it was because he loved her and thought she betrayed him. Absolutely tragic if its true. I have always listened to a fair amount of classical music, and Beethoven is the thing I put on when I want to be energized by music that doesnt distract concentration. Its magical.

Anywaymy new boss has been here for a week now. So far, so good. As she finds out more about our dept and what weve done and tried to do, that aura of her thinking shes the first one to have thought of certain ideas, will go away. Its pretty funny to watch though. More power to her if she can break down the wall to upper managements mind though. So far, they just wont understand what needs to be done to have things be successful. They insist it can be done another way, and when it fails, they blame us instead of the process. And they wont give a single thought to the fact that weve told them all along that it wont work. I guess thats why they get paid the big bucks. {eyeroll}

I just read an article on CNN about the worlds oldest person, a woman in Japan. They call her a hero. What for? Not dying? Nope sorry, thats not heroic. And some call the people who were in the WTC when they were hit heroes. What for? Dying? Nope. Wrong again. Thats not heroic either under these circumstances. They were victims. Sad and tragic were their deaths, but not heroic.

Hero and heroic have lost all meaning. People dub anyone who does anything a hero, thus diminishing the term. True heroism needs to involve peril or physical danger, selfless disregard for such and the saving of something or someone valuable. Dying or not dying all by itself is not heroic. People have lost all sense of proportion. Thorn 09-17-2003, 03:27 PM BSBG has to go to Vegas today so I will be all alone tonight. Hes very lucky that his employer has private planes and he hardly ever has to fly commercial for business anymore. He gets to take the Falcon this trip. Ive never been in a private jet before. I think the one the company has is pretty utilitarian and isnt anything like the ones you see in the movies. Still, it is a private jet. He just drives to the hangar, parks the car inside and jumps on the plane. None of that airport security crap or waiting in lines.

So I think Ill hit the library then read and eat leftovers. I recently ordered the last (purportedly) book in the Griffin&amp;Sabine series. A friend of mine got me into them when the third one came out and Ive followed it ever since. Its the combination of the art and the format like reading someone elses mail. Sure, the storyline is hokey but its different and entertaining.

Our 2-year wedding anniversary (9 year living together anniversary) is coming up later in the month. Even though money is tight, I hope we can do something special. Maybe splurge on some filet mignons and open a bottle of one of my favorite wines that has been aging quietly in the basement. Sigh. Then we can watch Pulp Fiction or something!! I got him a little something a Warren Zevon CD he doesnt have. It came yesterday. I almost gave it to him then Im so bad at holding onto stuff until the right time. Goofball.

Oh I just found out that David Bowie is coming to a venue near me for his Reality tour. No one else I know is a fan, so Im not sure I can find anyone to go with me. I hate going to concerts alone. I will be seriously bummed out if I cant find anyone. Ive never seen him live before so this might be my last chance. I think I have more DB albums than any other artist. Second is probably Neil Young.

Am now listening to Slade. What a great band they were. They only got famous in the states when they did really cheesy, unoriginal stuff in the 80s the whole Run Run Away thing (ugh). Sure there are a couple of more old school Slade tunes on that CD, but not many. What a way to go out.

I dont think there are many rational people left in California. They elected Davis??? Many times? This man gave legal drivers licenses to criminals. Now he wants to give them free college educations? How is this going to reduce crime, pollution, overcrowding, the deficit or taxes? By letting more useless, unskilled, unschooled and unhealthy people in the door?

Oh yeah, that makes sense. Lets let them all in so the legal, tax-paying residents work harder and harder to give their money to people who contribute absolutely nothing to the economy or welfare of the state. Lets let them in so that it forces the upstanding working folks out of the state for good. Lets make it so expensive to live in California that the skilled and educated people leave and our employers are forced to take their companies elsewhere. Then all well have left are millions of criminals who need to be paid their welfare checks and get their free prescriptions for their multitude of problems out of oh my, where did all the money go? Did they take the tree on their way out? Thorn 09-18-2003, 05:14 PM Did you ever notice that? Whenever there is a kiss or something, the author always describes the taste of the other person to be like smoke or rain or some other stupid thing that doesnt taste like anything. They never taste like the Italian grinder with extra onions they had for lunch! And when they eventually get down to having sex, the woman never is in the middle of her period. Nope, shes always ready for him and hes always eager for her. And she never has to go to the bathroom first or gets embarrassed at her stubbly legs. He never has gas or fumbles with the condom. Thats why sex scenes always make me laugh!

The book Im reading now had more sexual tension than you could fit in a boxcar and so I just knew that the sex would be hokey and unreal. Full of words like deep and ready and turgid and melding and heat and fire. Puh-leez. I just skim until theyve got their clothes on again. Unless, of course, I need a good laugh. Thorn 09-21-2003, 11:28 AM Two days ago I found out my boss is only 6 months older than me. What a blow to the ego that was. I have never felt inadequate before, but suddenly I felt that my entire career was a waste. That I should have been more ambitious. That I should have achieved more by now. I even had a dream about it. I was at some sort of huge fancy bash like the academy awards or a very snooty party. Everyone was dressed to the nines except me. I was wearing rags. Like Cinderella in the before picture. I know that dream was a direct result of finding out her age. I didnt feel this bad when I found out my doctor is exactly my age (we have precisely the same birthday). My doctor, my age and with her own rapidly growing practice. Me zilch. New boss a job that I know I could have done had I played the game better.

But thats just it the corporate game. It doesnt interest me. I wouldnt like the person I would have to become to play it well. So far, Ive seen both sides of my new boss the way she acts around her boss and the way she acts around us (her new dept). How can she do it? I guess she must think its worth it or that she is just playing a game and that everyone already knows it and expects no different from anyone. But it would make me nauseous.

Still, I somehow feel like its passed me by. That its too late. That Ill remain just a low-level schlub for the rest of my life. In some ways it bothers me, but it also makes me tired. Yes, I want to do well and to have fun at my job, but I have never been very ambitious. I like having a life and the thought of sacrificing my morning workouts to come in early, or staying so late that I never see my husband just doesnt seem worth it. I guess the truth is that if you dont do those things, you dont get anywhere. One of the guys I work with (Dog) actually went for our old boss job and didnt even get to an interview. That sort of made me back off (I was writing a business plan in anticipation of putting my hat in the ring) and I never went for it myself. Then my new boss hire was announced and that was the end of it.

I know I could do the job. Its my burned out state that really dragged me down. Im not as positive about the success of what I do for this company any more. Sometimes I am ready to quit in the sure knowledge that this melding of business models can never work. My new boss on the other hand is full of ideas and enthusiasm. Its nice to see in a way. If upper management wasnt just feeding her a line to get her hired, maybe she will succeed. But if they dont listen to what weve been saying for years and put in place some necessary changes, things will continue the way theyve been going downhill. Who knows? Maybe theyre finally serious. Maybe theyve had enough lousy quarters to finally get it. Maybe my enthusiasm will return.

I definitely have to keep the lack of under better wraps. I cant let my doubt show. I resolve to be just as gung ho about things as Boss Lady is. Actually, I am beginning to like her a great deal. She and I have a lot in common I think. We both drive BMWs for a start. I ride motorcycles and she wants to take flying lessons. Were proud brunettes. We have similar backgrounds in the industry. We both work out regularly. I think were going to have a good working relationship. Thats a relief. I was worried that she would be a clone of her boss (who was my boss for the time that my immediate supervisor position was vacant and it was awful she is a pill).

Soanyway, I am resolved to keep a positive attitude. I will not tear myself down with baseless comparisons. I am happy and have been for years, her position cant really change that and its stupid to dwell on it because its stupid to compare myself with another person. Whats right for her isnt necessarily right for me (as illustrated above). As do most of my bad emotions, they will blow away sooner or later. I like myself too much to dwell on them. Thorn 09-22-2003, 09:00 AM The funniest thing ever!!!

Last night we had steak and green beans and bread and olive oil for dinner. This morning as I&apos;m sitting at my desk, I suddenly start hacking up a lung. As an asthmatic, this is a little worrying but I&apos;m not panicked. I didn&apos;t cough at all at the gym.

So I cough a bit more and feel something solid come up. I spit it into my hand kind of perplexed...it&apos;s a feaking bean!!!!

One of those little ones from inside!

WTF???? How the hell did that get there and why did it stay down there so long??? I didn&apos;t choke on it last night.

Freakin&apos; A!!!

I can&apos;t stop giggling about it. Thorn 09-24-2003, 11:41 AM Today I worked in a set of 8 incline presses with 45-pound dumbbells. The most I have ever done for an incline press. It was work and the muscles were immediately tired, but I did it. Im going to be sore tomorrow. Ive never really kept track of my routine and progress. I just kind of gauge things in my head and judge by how my body feels with the weight and move up when I judge the time to be right. The weights I lift now are triple + what I started with a million years ago. I dont talk much about how much I run or lift because it sounds like showing off. DNA made me a big girl with big muscles and so my strength is mostly just genetics. I wish I didnt have to be so careful of my lower back and knees. I never feel like I get a really good leg workout or low back workout. Luckily, doing lunges on the Smith doesnt pain me. I did them extra heavy on Monday, so my ass is killing me! If there are any ladies out there who want to know how to work their butts DO LUNGES!!! It will feel like your ass is on fire!

So Im going to work in the 45s again and again during incline presses and eventually it will be my standing weight and not a stretch weight. I think when I get to 50s Ill need someone to spot me and help me get the weights into position my grip strength at that angle just isnt that great. Maybe if I work my arms heavier Ill be able to do it. Shoulders too, although I already kill them every week.

I am very concerned about connector damage as well. Muscle fibers are rich in blood that carries nutrients and therefore they repair themselves quickly. Tendons and ligaments on the other hand, are not as rich in blood flow and therefore heal slowly much slower than muscles do. A big problem (especially with men) is that people lift too much too soon and tear a connector. A torn ligament or tendon leaves the whole joint inoperable and will set you back weeks while you recover. I am hyper aware of this and so my form is excellent and my weight increments moderate and far between. Plus, Id have to become a juice monkey to lift REALLY heavy. Women just dont have the right chemical makeup to build mass like guys do. I want some mass to keep my metabolism working and active all day, but I have no illusions as to how big I can get or even want to get. There are only 2 women in the gym when I go who lift equal or more than I do. Neither are giants but both are very dedicated and strong. I aspire to the same strength and ethic.

I do have massive pipes, though! ;) Thorn 09-26-2003, 10:04 AM So it&apos;s Noob&apos;s birthday in a couple of days and we&apos;re celebrating here a little. Our new boss brought in 50 munchkins! I will keep resisting. It&apos;s hard when I look at the chocolate honey glazed, but today I am wearing a pair of jeans that I haven&apos;t fit into in 2 years, so I am protected. These jeans are like my armor. Whenever I look down and see my now flat stomach, I will resist the sweet pull of the munchkins! If things get too rough, I have a Detour bar that tastes like a Snickers so a couple of bites will curb my craving for sweets.

rust. Thorn 09-30-2003, 10:12 AM So just at the tail end of my workout this morning, the lights in they gym went out. Other than the people on the electrically powered cardio machines, it didnt seem to faze anyone. People just kept on lifting, me included. It was kind of cool to see and made me laugh.

I remember black outs when I was a kid. Oh did we have fun. Mom would light a bunch of candles and if we wanted to play a game or do homework, she would light a couple of hurricane lamps! I loved the smell of the oil and the flickering light. I always thought of Abraham Lincoln, studying away by firelight in that little cabin of his. Because we heated largely by wood, we were always warm. It was especially great if it was snowing. Youd get that snug, safe, snowed in feeling. We never felt stranded or disconnected the house was too well stocked for that. It was a taste of Little House on the Prairie, which were some of my favorite books when I was a girl. The blackouts never lasted long, but they were fun.

Now we have a generator because of problems we had with frozen pipes and lost food. They are fun but in a different way. We have the gennie and so do many people in the neighborhood. Looking out the window at the isolated lights is always kind of eerie. Like the end of the world.

I have always had an insidious desire for a plague or other population decimating disaster. I have read The Stand and other apocalypse type books and absolutely love them. The appeal is that everyone will be useful and special again. Everyone will have some kind of skill or value to bring to the table. No one can be easily replaced. No one will feel disposable. Hidden talents will be uncovered and human civilization will begin again. Of course it wont be the same as the first beginning, but it would be interesting.

I wont survive it long though. Thats the other thing that intrigues me. How long would I last? I can see myself driving to various stores, armed to the teeth against possible crazies, and taking my medication out of darkened pharmacies. How much would be enough? How many stores could I hit before others with my condition got the same idea and there was a mad, desperate race for the last of the life sustaining medication? What would happen when it expired? Would anyone bother to make more? Could anyone? Doubtful. Id probably live a few years and then that would be it. But oh, how interesting those few years would be. Thorn 10-01-2003, 09:51 AM Damn! Damn! Damn! It happened again. I had a really good back workout yesterday and now Im paying for it. My right rhomboid is spasming like crazy. The last time this happened it spasmed so hard that it disarticulated ribs from my spine! It hurts to do anything, including breathe. Fuck. I so do not need this. The last time this happened I couldnt lift for weeks and got really out of shape and weak. Damn. I cant lift. I cant run. Im out of it.

Its this kind of thing that gets me depressed. I stopped lifting a few years ago because I was plagued with physical problems despite my efforts to take care of myself. Thoughts of the futility of it all just resonate through my head like a mantra. Why bother? Youll always have something wrong with you no matter what you do. You can lift and run all you want and your body will still betray you. Why bother? You will never be healthy. Why bother?

It is so hard not to get wrapped up in those negative thoughts when my physical problems are hampering me right and left. BSBG just doesnt understand. Hes never had anything go wrong since he was 6 years old. No injuries. No chronic illnesses. No limiting condition. He cannot know how I feel since hes had nothing but physical perfection his entire adult life. Sometimes I am wracked with jealousy and anger about this. Its stupid and I dont really hate him, but sometimes I would like for him to taste my physical uncertainty and frailty just so hell know how it makes me feel so helpless and inadequate and trapped. Trapped in my own body that betrays me. Its like a cage. A prison with no escape.

Probably, Ill have an easier time aging than most people. Im already used to physical failure and betrayal of the body. Oh thats comforting. Things will only get worse, not better. This is the best physical shape I will ever be in. This unstable, unpredictable and unreliable body. Great. I hate it so. I feel so trapped. Things feel futile. No matter what I do to improve my physique, I will always have a disaster of a back, unreliable knees and asthma that without these great drugs, would kill me as sure as a bullet.

But to give up is to give in. To give up would probably accelerate the process of my degeneration. I would disappoint BSBG and myself. As futile as it is, I have to keep trying. It is my only salve. It keeps the despair at bay. It keeps my pride intact. And pride is my only refuge sometimes. My will. My discipline. These make me proud. They distinguish and separate me from the herd. They are part of who I am and what makes me strong. I cannot submit to my treacherous body and let it get the best of me. It is a tool. A tool used to accomplish my will.

I cant allow myself to get depressed. The last time it happened, I gave up lifting and all exercise for 2 years. I really hated who I was during those years. All self-esteem and self-regard went right out the window. I got fat. I ate junk. I didnt care. My sex life was practically non-existant. It sucked. I wont let this happen again. It is worse than the frustration I currently have with my physical shortcomings and weaknesses. Damn. I think Im going to go cry. Thorn 10-03-2003, 03:25 PM Theres been a lot of talk on the journals lately about taking medicine every day and feeling bad and helpless and trapped.

Well join the club and suck it up. All the posts sound like so much whining and you are all way better/stronger people than that from what I&apos;ve read. The whining is out of character.

I have had to take medicine all my life in order to keep from dying. You think you have it bad? Try that one on for size. Since I was 3 years old, I have taken medicine every day. Sometimes, yeah, its been depressing. Being chained to a medicine cabinet for eternity is not a pleasant or empowering thought. But the alternative is an early grave for me. At least if you stop taking your Prozac or whatever you wont drop dead or be hospitalized on a respirator. I got a cold once and 3 days later when into respiratory arrest. Thats my world. Some have it better, some have it worse. Play the hand youre dealt.

So dont fall into the snare of feeling helpless and trapped and depressed. If youre convinced that your mental problems have a physical cause, then there is no reason to feel ashamed or belittled by having to take medication. If its really just like any other ailment, then stop whining and take your pill. It sounds harsh but seriously, youve got the help you need and youre not dying. Blowing it out of proportion is really silly. And it doesnt help. Just take the meds and be glad they exist. Otherwise, wed have to lock your crazy asses up!

Ok, end of tough love post. Thorn 10-06-2003, 03:02 PM The weekend was pretty uneventful as usual. We did go visit our friend the deputy sheriff to see his new house that he just bought with his girlfriend. Its very nice and something that BSBG and I would have definitely considered buying ourselves. Its a log home on about 5 acres with no nearby neighbors. We loved the heated 3-car garage with finished upstairs. Between that and the finished basement, they should have plenty of room to spread out. Apparently they were one of 5 people vying for this house. They went with the brokers advice and got it. Amazing. They werent even offering the most money.

Then they realized they had no furniture and would have to buy some. They went to the usual outlets but didnt see everything they wanted. So he goes on line to check out some furniture that would compliment the log structure of the house. He finds a site that has exactly what he wants and calls up the company. They tell him that the best way to see everything they make is to get the catalog ($30), which he does. He finds a flintstone bed and a gorgeous table inlaid with granite. He figures they will be expensive but when the price of the table comes back at $18,200 and then the bed comes in at $12,500 he laughs and gracefully exits from the conversation. This is after hes invited to fly in and tour their facility, pick out their wood and stone, stay at the lodge and meet the artist. There is a private airstrip right next to the factory that most of their customers use. Ooooo-kay. Not quite the thing on a deputy sheriffs salary!

A couple of weeks later he gets a call from this same company. They tell him that they were building a bunch of furniture for this couple in California ($600,000 worth!!) but that by the time the work was done, the couple was divorcing. The furniture was paid for out of an escrow account set up during the divorce proceedings. Now they were ordered by the court to liquidate the furniture. 2 of the pieces that they ordered matched what my friend called about. The flintstone bed and the table. They say that they can refinish and refit both items to better fit what he originally wanted. When he asks the price, they say 90% off of what we told you before.
UNREAL!!!! Oh the luck. I told him he should have gone out and bought a Powerball ticket! Hes getting an $18,000 table for $1800. And a $12,000 bed for $1200. Amazing. Its nice when good things happen to good people.

Ok, Im going to say it. I hate sports. All this BS about the Red Sox and the Braves and the Cubs is driving me to drink. Every morning I have to listen to people around me dissect every play as if it were a political debate (as if any of them would put this much thought into a political debate!). I mean who the hell cares? Will it matter in 10 years? How people can put this much energy and thought into a childs game is beyond me. My mother is guilty of this when it comes to football and it drives me crazy. My brother is this way about just about every sport known to man. I just dont get it. I cant get that excited about something so trivial in the grand scheme of things. And I am so glad that BSBG is the same way. I could not have stood it.

Got to the gym today. No back spasms. I got in a run and then did legs. Now I feel like I need a nap. That always happens when I do legs after too little sleep. It just wipes me out. Tomorrow is when I normally do my back workout, but I may substitute chest and do back on Wed. Just to give me an extra day of recuperation. Thorn 10-08-2003, 11:18 AM Office politics suck. In June of this year, my boss was forced out of the company in a bullshit maneuver that was driven by a person who just didnt like him and his style. The withheld his bonus and put him on probation basically. No matter what he did, they always told him it wasnt enough. He couldnt win. Eventually, they had enough poor performance history to sack him, which they did.

Now, this is happening to me. The same person who did it to my boss now has me in her sights. My bonuses are being withheld because of a couple of reasons that are really strange. One is because I dont show enough enthusiasm on a day-to-day basis. The other is that when I went to another site to launch a program to the sales dept, I mentioned a couple of times that this program was sponsored by two high management guys. A manager took offense at this and thought I was sidestepping responsibility for the program.

What?? Since when is mentioning upper management sponsorship a bad thing? How else can I get this program taken seriously unless I do? I have seen many other people do the same thing when trying to get buy-in from other groups. I could not believe it. Especially after I met with my then boss and explained exactly why I mentioned these big wigs and she agreed that it was probably a good approach. She didnt reprimand me or indicate that I had done something inappropriate in any way. Then she blindsides me with this performance review bullshit.

She even brought up a review from last year that of course had some areas where I had to improve, as do all reviews. She said that this was an indication that I have an ongoing problem. If that were the case, why did I get a raise last year that was in the top 90% percentile for company raises?? If I was doing so badly, why did I get a raise at all, much less a good one (for this company anyway)?

But she has all the authority and I have no recourse. I prepared a rebuttal to this for my file, but I dont think it will do much good.

Yesterday I met with her and my new boss to discuss how things are going. Knowing this woman the way I do, I asked her point blank if this performance plan was something she truly believed would help me or if it was just a way to tell me that I should look for a new job immediately. I know her games. She cant manage to peoples strength, so instead she finds ways to get rid of the people that dont fit her mold of what people should be. In answer, she pointed out that it was probably a personality issue and that she didnt expect me to change my personality. All said with a sickening little smile and a laugh. Vicious asshole.

So now Im on the hunt big time. I have to get out of here. I doubt that I will have this job come Christmas if I stay. I am so angry and outraged that this can be done to me. I come in every day and do everything that is expected of me. I have worked against upper managements cluelessness of what I do and why it is valuable. My department has been like the redheaded stepchild of our company. We have never been taken seriously. For the last year, its been one step forward, two steps back. In spite of this, I have retained a drive to accomplish something positive and show that this work is important to the company as a whole.

But now I have to leave without achieving that. I feel like I have failed. Maybe I havent been as cheerleader like as this woman wants, but she will never find anyone with as much belief in what this department has to offer than I have.

I also thirst for revenge of some kind. This woman has done this deliberately and it is personal. I can see it in her eyes when she talks to me. She wants to make me suffer and squirm and be driven out and defeated. I can see it. When I asked her my point blank question about the real reason for this performance review, I could see she was surprised. It was just for a second, but I saw it. She must have really thought I was stupid. Bitch. My fantasy is to find out her pseudonym for the trashy romances she writes and out her.

So I went online and actually found a promising job. A company that is similar to the one I work for, but different in all the important ways. Weirdly enough, it is literally 5 minutes from my house. I emailed the President about the position and he emailed right back asking if I could come in this week and to forward my resume.

I was up most of last night thinking about all of this and trying not to get too excited about the possibility of working so close to home for a company that looks more interesting and more me than the one I currently work for. Ive done a whole bunch of research on this company. Not that there was much to find. Theyve only been in business for 14 months. A start up.

That doesnt scare me. Some of the best years of my life were spent at a small company that was growing exponentially. There was a vibe there that was hard to describe. We were like David against Goliath. The underdog. The little guy going toe-to-toe with the big guys. And we were winning. It was excellent. Every order was a reason to celebrate. Everyone knew each other well and got along socially as well as professionally.

Will I ever get that back again? Probably not, but my chances are better with a new company than with this 20-year old, billion dollar behemoth I work for now. My boss knows now that I have no choice but to look for other employment. I hope she doesnt want to pull the trigger early. That would really ruin the holidays for me unless I could find something quickly. The market out there is choked with the unemployed though, so I cant count on that.

So thats my drama for now. Its been going on for a few weeks, but I thought I could resolve it. I started feeling more positive this morning. Things seem brighter now that I have direction and I will be free and starting something new. Thorn 10-08-2003, 08:25 PM Woah! The job opening I mentioned above is moving ahead. The President of the company wants to meet tomorrow at a local restaurant (they&apos;re finding new office space and are probably ashamed of where they are at now) to discuss things. It&apos;s after work, so no having to make thinly veiled excuses to my boss. Woo hoo!

Again, I am trying not to put that much hope in this because it&apos;s not a guarantee, but damn...I&apos;m freaking good at what I do and I know my stuff. Soooo...I have some hope for this. I hope it doesn&apos;t suck and that the people aren&apos;t jerks. Oh and that the salary is good.

Now I have to slope off and do some more research on their industry so that I can formulate some intelligent questions about the company and the position!

Oh please oh please oh please oh please let me be able to quit soon!!! Thorn 10-11-2003, 11:32 AM The interview went well. I am supposed to have another with someone else. I liked the two owners of the company. They were very casual and seemed up front and honest. The company is very small, but has a steady customer base and is about to go into development of what they feel will be a very successful product. Part of their workforce is over here on the east coast, and some is on the west coast. One owner is based here, and the other there. They service and support customers all around the country. They readily admit to having no knowledge or ability about the job theyre hiring for thats why they need help. I think the job is something I can do, albeit challenging and somewhat of a stretch for me. They said that after they set up the interview in the restaurant, that they thought I might think they were weirdos who were out to get me or something. But they werent. Theyre looking for new office space. They mentioned where they were looking and I told them it was probably 3-4 minutes from my house. Then I pretended to write on my hand Note to self; cannot be late for work. That got a laugh. I think it will be exciting and a far nicer place to work than where I currently am employed.

For example; a guy that I work with that I have known for 10 years was recently accused of sexual harassment. Now, I can tell you straight out that it is a lie. This guy would NEVER do that. Ive known him a long time and can make that statement with no doubt in my mind. He is a sensitive guy and a stand up guy. Hes married and they just had their first child in Feb. I have never seen him act inappropriately towards a woman in thought or action. If he was that kind of guy, he wouldnt be a good friend of mine. And I remember when he first started dating his wife, he was totally smitten. But it was more than just sexual, he admired and respected her. Seriously, he bragged (and still brags) about how smart she is (shes an investment banker) and how creative and how talented she is. It doesnt hurt that shes also very pretty.

There is no way he harassed this woman. When he asked who accused him, they refused to say. When he asked if there was a witness to this incident, they said there wasnt. So basically, its her word against his and hes guilty until proven innocent. He doesnt need a lawyer yet. If there is an investigation, he will need one. Our family lawyer is now the attorney general for our state, so maybe I can help him if it comes to that.

I am so disgusted. Between that and the crap Im going through on my end, its turning out to be a pretty sucky place to work. I cannot wait to get out. Thorn 10-12-2003, 02:52 PM So I am scheduling an interview with a 3rd person at this prospective employer. I&apos;m pretty psyched. She said that the two guys I met with were&quot;greatly impressed with my personality and my background.&quot;Heh. That&apos;s gratifying to hear. Lately I&apos;ve felt pretty abused and dispensable. I am going to focus on the positive and keep my self-esteem up. Nothing shows up worse than lack of confidence. Personality is half of the battle. No matter how qualified you are, if they don&apos;t click with you, no job. Sometimes clicking with someone helps offset shortcomings in qualifications. Not that I can&apos;t do this job. I can. It will be a stretch for me, but the good kind. The kind that will make me grow and be creative and keep the fire lit under me. I think it will be exciting. Oh that sounds so hokey.

Right now I am watching a movie from 1925. Metropolis. Wow. It&apos;s interesting but, I fear that my attention span is too short to keep me very involved. The simplistic plot and over-the-top acting is too much. Although the sets are pretty interesting and I wish I could see them clearer and in color. The use of music is the only constant way to keep the audience emotionally attached to the story. The makeup on both male and female actors is hilarious! Oh how far things have come and how they have stayed the same.

I just have to put in a plug for Samuel Adams&apos;s Octoberfest. I love this beer. It&apos;s so malty you can practically chew it. Do yourself a favor and go buy some! I think I hear one calling me now. Thorn 10-13-2003, 05:14 PM My job is boring today. Some days Im slammed and other days I have nothing to do. Literally. Its aggravating. Of course, the possibility of my imminent absence from these halls doesnt help! I started having resignation fantasies. Of course I will be courteous and professional about it, but I doubt I will be able to hide my glee about the whole thing. I really should stop with this. It wont be pretty if this job doesnt pan out. Ill be so crushed and youll have to read through my paragraphs of whining and anger and disappointment. So be warned!

I am also having visions of actually having an office again. I had one at my last job and I loved it. As a long-time cube-dweller, it was a refreshing change. I actually felt like a grown-up. The cube Im in now is about as large as the conference table was in my old office. You couldnt raise veal in these cubes theyre too small! Seriously, were packed in here. I shouldnt get my hopes up about that either, but I cant help it. My brain just drifts away into the possibilities! I really wish I could disconnect and stop it.

I have begun to remove unnecessary personal items from my desk. Like books of funny quotations and weird words. I havent gone so far as to remove photos and such - that would be too obvious. But I have pared down. Not that this tiny prison can hold much in the way of personal items. But I will take my slinky with me when I go! I hope I remember to take my natural keyboard (its mine) and clean out my locker in the shower room.

Hey now. I actually did some work. Web research for IT spending figures. ZZZZZZZZZ.
The problem is, a company needs to be a subscriber to info and research firms like Gartner and IDC. If we are, I do not have access to these things. At my last job, I did. Oh well. Just more of the same being swallowed up by corporate BS. Which takes me back around to thinking of this job prospect. Im going in circles.

Well almost time to leave here. By brain has totally checked out. I just sifted through a large-ish proposal and made some edits. Yawn. If it werent for these sweet tarts, I would probably fall on my desk in a puddle of drool. Sucks that my boss is in the very next cube. Literally 2 feet away. I type these in Word and then paste them into the reply form. Oh the subterfuge. I bet if I get this new job, I wont be bored at all! I probably wont have any time during the day to read journals or update mine. That would be a nice thing. I hate being at work and being bored. I also frequent another board during the day since I usually have time. That will probably be cut down as well. Im psyched for it and wish the interview was tonight instead of tomorrow.

Anyway, Im just babbling now so Ill shut up. :D Thorn 10-16-2003, 03:32 PM So the past couple of days Ive been running around like crazy for work and havent been obsessing over this job 12 hours a day. Just 10 hours a day!

I did get another email from the company owner and he wants to talk again. Apparently I made quite an impression on the person I interviewed with on Tuesday. This is positive. I am psyched. I really want this job and to get out of my current one! My resignation fantasies have returned. I just had to deal with an arrogant person on the phone and I so wanted to tell him off since it wouldnt matter and I wouldnt care!

So my concentration has really gone downhill. Every time my boss talks to me about something we need to sort out, I cant get interested. Were planning stuff that would matter if I cared and wanted to stay, but now its hopeless. I just want to roll my eyes and make throwing up gestures at her! Its not that shes a bad person, but you know how it is when youve mentally and emotionally disconnected from something. Its hard to engage after that. Oh this is agony! I just want out. I keep thinking of the things I could be doing at this other company and the stuff Im doing now just takes a back seat. I feel slightly guilty about that, but not a whole lot.

Now I am obsessively checking my yahoo mail to see if he emailed back about a time and date for us to meet. I am so pathetic. I am sorry that B E G did not get the job she wanted, but it is good that the company she does work at has given her a boost. Jobs are so stressful most of the time. Either because you dont have one or because the one you do have makes you crazy. I dont know anyone who isnt stressed out over their job. Sad huh? That we spend so much of our lives doing things that drive us crazy. I know this new job (now thats positive thinking for you!) will be stressful, but I hope that the atmosphere and the change will offset that. I really dont mind working, but I hate being bored or stressed out.

I talked to someone yesterday who asked if I would entertain other offers if this one didnt pan out and I said yes. Although, hes let loose with some facts about his company that make me wary. And its a subsidiary of another large company and I think I would be setting myself up for similar misery at the hands of some giant corporation. But who knows, its something to think about.

My oldest friend is in town and we are going to another friends wedding on Saturday. Another friend is flying in to attend as well. I have known these women since we were kids 20-25 years. Its really strange that no matter how far-flung we get, we still manage to stay connected. Only Olga and me are close, but we all still communicate to a certain degree. Its kind of cool. No husbands on this trip, which will be cool. Not that I dont adore BSBG, I do, but sometimes its good to get away with the girls. The resort where the wedding is being held looks really nice. Ill have to scope it out thoroughly to see if its someplace BSBG and I should go in future. Were always looking for cool places to go on the bikes.

Anyway, heres something Ive always wanted to know. When is it OK to ask someone if they are gay? I know this guy and I think hes gay, but I dont think I can just ask him. Its just something I would like to know. To have the question answered. Not for any specific reason, just to have it answered. With almost everyone you meet, you know their sexual orientation. Its part of the whole and is just something that goes into the total picture of the person. Usually you dont dwell on it, but its there. But with some people, its just a mystery. And because its an aspect of someone that is normally known, its weird not to know. You know? Somehow, I dont think I could ask him and not offend him and feel like an ass. If anyone knows the etiquette here, send me a PM. Thorn 10-20-2003, 12:10 PM This weekend I attended the wedding of an old friend. Ive known her since 8th grade. We hung around in with a group of about 10 other people 4 of which also attended. So there were 6 of us whove known each other for a long time. Even though we dont have much in common these days, we all had a great time talking about our current lives and old memories. The DJ played lots of 80s music, so we danced like maniacs to the same music we danced to when we were in HS together. It was a blast!

The only disappointing thing was the hotel at this resort. It was awful. We paid $200 a night and it was like staying at someones camp at the lake! Totally a rip off as far as Im concerned. Tacky furniture. Too few towels. The towels felt like sandpaper. No shampoo (but two shower caps and bottles of icky lotion). One bar of soap. Inadequate bathroom lighting. Hideous lamps and fixtures. A wire loop around the door handle for security. Clanking pipes at all hours (it sounded like we were in the hold of a ship!). All around icky. I am somewhat of a hotel snob, so for $200 a night, I expect more. I have stayed at better places and paid far, far less. It was disappointing because I was hoping to find a cool resort for me and BSBG to go to and use as a base for a motorcycle trip. Oh well.

I loved seeing my friend so happy. I met many of her new family members and they were all great. She is going to have so much laughter in her life now. Shes had a bunch of bad relationships over the years, so its a relief to know that she finally has found her man. I told him to take good care of her because shes one of the good ones.

The day before the wedding was my last track day of the year. We ran a different track configuration and so it was a little more challenging, but I still prefer the old configuration more turns! I was bummed that I couldnt run on Saturday as well, but at least I got in one day. My instructor told me that my driving ability had progressed to the point where if I dont learn how to heel-toe, Ill hold myself up. I really nailed some turns and have improved my consistency all of this adds up to increased speed! I improved so well in some turns that I was able to catch folks in much more powerful cars that always get away from me in the straights, but if I am on their asses in some turns, they have to point me by and let me pass! Woo hoo!!

There was one asshole in a Lotus who passed people without getting pointed by. I so wanted to black-flag him when I was flagging, but I was at a station before the passing zone, so couldnt do it. I hate that shit. You cant just pass whenever you want to. Its a driving school, not a race. His instructor needs to set him straight. Just because he has a Lotus, doesnt give him license to be an asshole. He scared the shit out of me by cutting in front of me at the last second in my braking zone. It can be really dangerous and lead to crashes. An idiot in a TT did the same thing to me just off of the front straight when I was braking down from about 100mph to 40mph. Asshole!!!! Who do you think you are putting me in danger like that? They should have black-flagged him, too but they didnt. I bitched about it later, but it was too late.

But anyway, it was good despite these issues. Only one crash and there was very little damage (he hit the tire wall) to car or and none to driver. A couple of spins and a near crash into a cement wall (dumb ass was way too hot on his warm up lap now he knows the danger of cold tires!). It was right at my flagging station so I had to make sure that he got back into the race line in a safe manner. BSBG told me that the same guy in the 911 who spun on Friday, also spun on Saturday, but in a different turn. Some people never learn. Im glad in a way that I wasnt there on Sat. BSBG said that someone screwed with the grouping and really fucked things up. Instead of grouping by ability, they just arbitrarily put people in run groups. This meant that 10 minutes into the session, there were huge trains because there were slow drivers on the track with fast drivers and not enough people could pass. Very frustrating if youre a faster driver. You dont learn anything if youre driving below your skill level. Its a waste of time and money and feels like a rip off. They got the run groups better organized in the afternoon, but still that was almost an hour of wasted seat time.

Oh did that ever turn into a bitch session! Sorry. I just love my track days and hate it when they are badly organized or cost me seat time. The crash happened in my session and I lost 15 minutes of seat time because of it. I was glad that no one got hurt, but pissed that it cost me track time!! Im selfish that way.

No news on the job front. Im waiting to hear from the guy that wants to talk to me again he needs to pick a day for us to meet. Hes probably busy finding office space and hasnt gotten around to it, but my head is going off into paranoia land and envisioning all kinds of other more negative scenarios. I really need to stop it! Thorn 10-21-2003, 01:31 PM The coolest thing just happened.

I walked next door for a sandwich (garlic&amp;herb wrap w/boursin cheese, rare roast beef, provolone, grilled tomatoes, red peppers&amp;onions - then the whole thing is grilled - oh it&apos;s the best!) and coming back I noticed what I thought was the biggest earthworm ever. It was in the street wriggling in the leftover rain water. I step closer&quot;Hey! It&apos;s not a worm. It&apos;s a baby snake!&quot;I pick it up and it was soooo cute. He just weaved in and out of my fingers and wrapped his tiny tail around my pinky. AWWWWWWW! What a little sweetie. I put him in the back of our building near the pond. Hopefully it will be safe there and not try to cross the road again. It looked like a corn snake or possibly some kind of water snake, too young to tell. I&apos;ll look it up when I get home.

I totally adore snakes of all kinds. I used to have one when I was a kid. I found a bunch of eggs underneath a log pile and decided to take one of them to see what it was. I kept it on the porch in a syrofoam cup full of peat moss. After a while I forgot about but then one day, suddenly remembered.

When I poured it out of the cup it was all wrinkled and shrunken (I didn&apos;t know then that this is normal when the baby reptiles consume all of the yolk). I was so bummed out that it died. But then, it moved! Right there in the palm of my hand, it moved. I kind of freaked (being 12 at the time) but held onto it. In a few minutes, a tiny nose appeared. Two little nostrils and an egg tooth. Soon the rest of the head was out and it could see it was a tiny, green snake. He hatched in my hand - a smooth green snake.

I kept him for a little while on a diet of weird bugs and spiders, but then let him go when the weather started to get cool. He loved to hunt spiders (which I also love, so it was hard to feed them to the little snake).

I would love to have a snake again - a python or something, but BSBG has a big aversion to them. It&apos;s hilarious when I find a garter snake or something in the yard and he hides inside until I stop messing with it. A freaking garter snake!!! BAHAHAHAHAHA! Thorn 10-23-2003, 10:21 AM Now you&apos;ll have that song in your head all day! Hey - there are worse things.


So the prospective employer cant meet with me this week. Im bummed. It will have to be next week. This is the part I hate the worst. I know they are interested in me; otherwise there would be no 3rd interview. This 3rd one is key. This is the one where we talk money. First, are they profitable? If not, what is their timeline to profitability? Also, how are they funded if they are not profitable? Making sure my paycheck clears every week is pretty important to me. Second, can they afford me? Depending on what they expect me to do besides the basics, I will need more $$. Third are the benefits. Likely they will be sparse. Small companies usually are. But all wont be lost if they are since my husband is employed and I can always go on his plans. Right now we are on mine since they are better and less expensive. No dental at his employer unbelievably. Luckily I had a bunch of major work done a few years ago.

Anyway, I really hope it turns out to be a good financial situation for me there. I cannot stand it here. My new boss is driving me nuts. She is my age and very enthusiastic (Ill bet she was a cheerleader {puke}) and she wants to do 75 things at once. Im more of a get a couple things done, then move on to the next things kind of person. I like to feel like Im making progress. Instead, were all moving in 10 directions at once.

Example; she wants me and Dog to produce this little handbook thing for some other department. Yesterday she says she wants it by COB today. Then about an hour later, she asks me to go to some other site to do some training for some people who missed my last training. She wants me to do it today. Hello! You just said you wanted us to work on the other thing. Now my schedule clashes with Dogs and we cant do it.

WTF??!! Learn to prioritize! She has no idea. Its making me frazzled. I dont mind having a few irons in the fire, but when you have too many, things get left undone and fall by the wayside. I hate that. It makes me feel like Im not accomplishing anything. If I dont get this job (oh please not that!), I will have to have a talk with her about improving the way we work together.

It snowed today! Freaking October 23 and it SNOWED! I hate when winter starts this early. It seems like forever when it finally breaks in April or May. Last year it snowed with accumulation before Thanksgiving thats still not even technically winter and it didnt stop snowing until late April. I thought I would kill someone it was so depressing. Now this snow wont have anything in the way of accumulation, but its the mental distress that early snow causes. Were not even at a high elevation here. Up in the mountains it is OK, but down here its too early!!! We didnt even have a nice autumn. We went from 90 degrees and humid to 60 degrees and dry literally overnight. The day after Labor Day, the temp dropped 15 degrees. Weve had our first hard frost. I like it when the seasons act like what they are fall is my favorite and this year I got gypped. Two years ago it was a beautiful fall. Dry and 70s and 80s until mid-November! I was out of work at the time so it was glorious!

I have to say that Warren Zevons version of Raspberry Beret is way better than Princes. I also like his version of Back In The High Life better than Steve Winwoods. Oh how I miss Warren.

There has been a great debate on the Florida feeding-tube woman lately. I have to agree with the decision to remove the tube.

Under the circumstances, it is the right choice. Her body cannot support itself and has not made any progress towards that in the past 13 years. Its her time to go. Death is not unnatural. Sometimes it comes early, but it comes for us all.

Life support and feeding tubes are appropriate for patients who need the support while their bodies and brains heal. To keep a person on artificial life support when there is no higher brain function, and/or no progress towards that state, is just cruel. If it happened to me, I hope my family would let me go. I mean, I probably wouldnt have any idea that it was happening, so I wouldnt suffer. But to exist in that perpetual state would be an undignified and unproductive life.

I also have a problem with wasting resources on a person who wont be fully alive ever again. We have difficulty getting care to people who will get well and go on to be a productive citizen to see care wasted on those who will never contribute again is a shameful waste. I dont know how much it contributes to the overall high costs of healthcare, but Im sure that these perpetual vegetative patients do cost other people access to healthcare.

It sounds cruel, but really just let these people die. Its their time. I think that people should have access to a dignified and timely death. Lingering in endless illness must be hell. I advocate and understand what Dr. Kavorkian has done, but not necessarily his approach. If I had some ghastly terminal disease that would leave me a wrecked shell of a human being, unable to move or to speak or to think, I would want to go out on my own terms, not those of a medical establishment who think they are gods on earth. Why prolong the inevitable? Thorn 10-24-2003, 04:59 PM I have to side with Bambookie on this one. The thought of sex with another woman is not pleasant. A 3-way would be out of the question. Gross. Women are too soft and smooth and round. I prefer hard and hairy and angular! I crave masculine men. Tall. Hairy chest. Long legs. Tight butt. Heavy musculature. Six pack. Big arms. Broad shoulders. Oh crap.where is BSBG when I need him!

Shake it off! Dont think about it while youre at work. Damn. Anyway

Sometimes the idea of a 3-way with another man is interesting. Of course, the vast majority of men out there who are panting for a 3-way with another woman would NEVER have another man in the bed. Its really very hypocritical but expected. Men want to have everything their way when it comes to sex (and everything else, who am I kidding?). In former times, it was actually taught that women shouldnt have pleasure when having sex because it was a sin and would keep them from becoming pregnant. Hows that for a control complex! Recently it has been proven that orgasms actually improve the chances of a woman conceiving. The vagina contracts and causes the cervix to dip forward and literally siphon semen into the uterus. Betcha didnt know that.

By now the men are gagging because they cant think about womens internal sex organs. Nope. Its all tits and ass for them. Pretty funny when you get right down to it.

The thing that stops me about a 3-way is who I would pick. The thought of another man touching me is pretty repulsive, actually. When I think about it, I cant picture another person. Its more a faceless, remote scene in my head. Almost like it isnt really me. When I think about it, its always me doing something to the man, never the other way around. Ive never spoken about it to BSBG. He would definitely not understand or want another man anywhere near him. Hes not really homophobic in the sense that he doesnt like / accept / approve of gay men. Men just dont turn him on in the same way women dont turn me on. I would be dry as a bone with a woman and he would be as limp as a dishrag with a man. Just nothing going on.

Wow. That was weird. Thorn 11-12-2003, 08:49 AM The last few weeks have been really strange. I was pushed out of my job 2 weeks ago Monday. The bitch who had it in for me didnt even have the guts to do it herself she had my new boss do it. After I confronted her about her real motives in our last meeting, Im not surprised. When I walked into the room, I put my security badge on the table in front of the HR flunky and sat down. My boss looked stricken. The HR flunky had to state the obvious and tell me that I probably knew what this was all about. I looked at the boss and asked her if it felt good to be doing other peoples dirty work. No reply. I couldnt keep from smiling and nearly laughed during the whole deal. I think they thought I was going to come back with a gun.

It was classic. I cleaned out my stuff and was home by 10:30. Done and done.

So what am I doing now? Well, not much. The guy from the company I was interviewing with says that other things have come up that he has to take care of before he can concentrate on hiring. Damn! Its so frustrating. More so because my timetable has changed so differently from his. I am still hopeful, but have found a seasonal job to take me through the end of January. It doesnt pay well, but its close to home and will give me the breathing room I need to get my head together. I start training on Monday. They kept looking at me funny and telling me over and over again that it was an entry-level job and only seasonal. I had to keep assuring them that it is exactly what Im looking for. No pressure, no commitment. Im already on BSBGs insurance from his job, so really folks, its fine!

I dont think I am cut out for large corporations and all their political bullshit. I cant put on a fake personality every day and kiss peoples asses. Its just not me. The corporate game is full of that and I just cant do it. When I was driving out of the parking lot for the last time, I felt such an overwhelming sense of relief. I couldnt stop smiling (especially since the HR flunky and the new/old boss carried my stuff out for me).

So what have I been doing with myself? I still go to the gym every morning. I go a bit later and its heavenly. Then I come home to shower and have lunch. Then do errands if I have any. If not, I read or watch movies. I washed a couple of the cars the other day. I told my cleaning lady to take a break for a while, so I am doing the vacuuming and other stuff myself now. I had to call her to ask where the attachments were!! That was funny.

One thing I found out by staying home is that birds smack into my windows an awful lot. The other day I had to help out a stunned nuthatch after she smacked herself silly on the back door. I didnt want the Orange Menace to get her while she was out of it. What a beautiful little bird. After a few minutes of resting in my hands, she flew up to the rain gutter. A few minutes after that, to the top of the roof. She stayed there a while and when I came back she had flown away. It was much better than the day before with the chickadee that I took away from the Orange Menace. It was still alive, but its neck was broken and it died in my hands. Such a tiny little life.

In some ways, I really like staying home and doing my own thing. But sometimes I am bored out of my mind. Plus the money thing will be a problem after a while. BSBG and I dont share money. We never have. He has his income and I have mine. He has his bills and I have mine. He has his investments and I have mine. We each do with our money exactly what we please. We have a joint checking account where we deposit money to pay joint bills. We contribute equally. Like when we bought the older BMW earlier this year we each paid of the price of the car from our individual bank accounts. One of his credit cards serves as the joint card for when we go on vacations or buy appliances and stuff. We pay that off together.

People, especially other married couples who do share money, think this is very strange. Theyre the same ones who have fights about money. We have never fought about money. We rarely even discuss it. But if I stop earning some, we might have to. It would be very weird to be supported by someone. I mean, apart from my parents, no one ever has. I havent needed anyone to. Its a pride thing I admit it. But, it hasnt come to that and probably never will. I always figure something out. And Im not in a lot of debt. If I absolutely had to, I could pay off the bike with funds from my money market account. Thats the only bill I have other than what little is on my credit cards and the household bills. I was in quite a bit of debt in my late teens and early 20s and I learned my lesson.

More later. Off to the gym now. Thorn 11-14-2003, 08:43 AM That judge from Alabama with the 10 commandments deal was removed from office yesterday and I saw him on TV this morning. For a chief justice, hes remarkably inarticulate and makes a circular argument that was picked apart in about 2 minutes from the talking head guy. He deserves to be kicked out of office. He disregarded the law. What a nice example to set. If the law doesnt apply to a chief justice, someone who is supposed to respect and uphold the law, then who does it apply to? He maintains that a judge shouldnt be the one to interpret this law because he cant define religion. That the law isnt valid because it discriminates against his religion.

That makes no sense. First of all, the definition of religion isnt at issue here. What is at issue is that he flagrantly refused to remove the monument from his courtroom as he was ordered to do. Secondly, this is not about whether the law is valid, it is about the fact that he wouldnt comply with it. In one breath he says its not about religion, but about freedom and in the next he says that the law itself discriminates against his religious beliefs. Well, which is it buddy? You cant have it both ways. If this is the best that the state of Alabama can do for a chief justice, its better that hes out. What an asshole.

And all those idiots screaming about how that god needs to be put back into the law and praying on the courthouse steps. What a bunch of blind morons. They dont seem to get it that their god is not the only one out there and that if we admit Judeo-Christian law, we will have to admit Islamic law and Hindu law and freaking every other crackpot religious law there is. I hate to say it but the south is so backwards because of idiots like these.

Another thing that got me riled up this morning is the whole Amber Frey bullshit. I love how shes now being portrayed as this straight-laced, god-fearing, struggling single mom, all around perfect person. How awful its been that shes had to move, that shes lost her job and that she really wants to reconnect with her church because she misses it so much.

Oh boo hoo. Maybe you should have thought about all that before you started fucking a married man with a pregnant wife. What a crock of shit. Shes just another greedy little tart who wanted to steal another womans husband. And hes a heartless asshole who fucking cheated on a pregnant wife. Thats low. I dont know if he killed her or not (most likely he did), but hes still a worthless asshole in my book.

The weather is the other thing making the news. 6 inches of hail in Los Angeles. 10 inches of snow in Buffalo. Floods in the Midwest. Crazy. We have high winds here but thats about it. Nothing major has happened no trees down on top of houses or cars or anything. No power outages. No precipitation.

My little girl kitty Scribble is much better it seems. Shes got a lot more energy and isnt struggling to breathe the way she was. Im not sure whats going on. Maybe its major remission. I mean, I saw her x-rays. She had a huge white mass almost filling her chest cavity. I have enough knowledge of x-rays to know that white means solid and black means not solid. What else could it have been besides cancer? And can a cat with that big of a tumor go into remission as good as this? Would prednisone do that for a cat? For anyone? It didnt for Magnum when he had cancer. Im not complaining, Im mystified. Its made her a much more interesting little force around the house though. Shes always doing something silly (when shes awake that is, lord this cat can sleep!).

Anyway, this is one of my last days of leisure before I start the job. Im heading over to a friends house from lunch. Shes someone from the company I just left, so should have some interesting dirt. There are a few other people I was sad to leave, but not many. Thorn 11-15-2003, 12:48 PM Oh my god kids are awful!! There is no way on earth I will ever want any. Just 4 hours at my friends house with her 8-year-old was enough to drive me to drink. I seriously dont know how people deal with it. The constant motion and talking and noise and pawing and questions and interruptions and sly attempts at disobedience! Were trying to have lunch and the brat is at the table slurping down a bowl of black olives with a spoon. Then she kept pestering me to come and play barbies. After that, she kept hanging on her mother and constantly touching her. It was awful. And tiring. I have never before wanted to come home to my peaceful, quiet, sedate home as much in my life.

When the girls friend came over, I made my escape. Two 8-year-olds are two too many. I wanted to meet my friend&apos;s fianc, but he would have his 9-year-old daughter and his 12-year-old son with him and that would be impossible. Ill bet my friend could see my rising panic and I could feel my mask of its ok slipping. There would be no way I could fake being comfortable in a house with 4 kids. I would like to try and pursue this friendship, but I dont think it will work because of the kids. Although they do have other parents they could be shipped off to, I still have my doubts. Oy vey. Kids ruin my life and I dont even have any! I dont know how you folks with kids stand it.

Okenough about that shit. I am here in my quiet house, on my comfy chair listening to iTunes radio, drinking mulled cider all is well. Beef stew is cooking and Im going to make apple crisp later on.

Oh and we&apos;re going to make the best snack - Make This! You won&apos;t be sorry.

Get some goat cheese and one bulb of garlic

Do not peel it into individual cloves leave it whole
Cut the tips off of the top
Place in a small oven dish or pie plate
Drizzle virgin olive oil over it
Let it absorb and drizzle again use as much as the bulb will hold
Bake for an hour at 350

When its done it will have a paste like consistency (and your house will smell wonderful). Slice some bread (Italian or French crusty bread is best) or get some non-flavored crackers (bread is better because you can toast it). Spread the cheese on the bread and then the garlic paste. Or you can mix the garlic into the cheese and make a spread.

It is HEAVEN, I tell you HEAVEN! Thorn 11-16-2003, 01:57 PM I am very mad at the Orange Menace right now. He had just come inside yesterday and I was trying to get him to play and he got all pissy because the other cat was near and he turned on me with a major hiss and whacked me in the wrist with one of his front paws. His claws were out and he got one in me, but that wasnt the bad part. The blow landed on the top of my wrist near the inside of my arm and there must be a nerve bunch there because it hurt like hell and felt all tingly at the same time all the way up into my hand. That intense feeling lasted about 20 minutes. Now Ive got loss of feeling from the second knuckle of my index finger straight down to the wrist and over into the base of my thumb and up the inside of the thumb. It extends over almost to the palm of my hand by the first knuckle. I can feel it as a kind of tingly feeling like when part of your body goes to sleep and is getting the circulation back. The Orange Menace is a pretty big cat 15 pounds or so, and he has huge paws that pack a wallop. I feel stupid but fuck all he hurt me, the little bastard.


I dont know how long this will last. I hope the full range of sensitivity in my hand comes back at some point. The little jerk better not have permanently injured me. I love him very much, but right now I dont want him to be around me. After it happened I yelled at him and he hid in the basement for the rest of the day. He did come and sleep on the bed though smashed right up against me as usual, so I dont think his pea-brained psyche was permanently damaged. Thorn 11-17-2003, 03:37 PM So for years now, I have really liked the movie True Romance. I mean, whats not to love?

Violence and killing check
Romance check
Christopher Walken check
Elvis impersonator check
Gary Oldman check

So last night I watched Badlands with Sissy Spacek and Martin Sheen its an older movie from the 70s that I heard was really good. And it was.

Except it showed me how unoriginal parts of True Romance was.
Lilting, island-like music throughout the picture especially used to illustrate a mood when there was no dialogue copied (the songs used are different but soooo close)

The two main characters are young, in love and on the run copied

Each of the two lovers do voice-overs that are part inner monologue (mainly about motivations and why they love the other person) and part narration copied

Granted, the stories are very different and so is the outcome of each, but the thread of young lovers on the run is the same and the ways the story is told is very similar. Just goes to show that there is nothing new under the sun.

Anyway, which do I like better? I couldnt say. The acting in Badlands is definitely better, but Sissy Spaceks character is a weak person, which is the complete opposite of Alabama. Martin Sheens character is somehow more sympathetic than is the Christian Slater character, who just seems out to get what he can get, if you know what I mean. And there are very few supporting characters in Badlands and there are tons of them in True Romance. I recommend both, but if youre squeamish about violence and killing, go with Badlands. There is some, but it is much more muted.

So anyway, I just got back from training for my new job. Im supposed to go every day this week from 9-2. Its weird. I havent been in this kind of job in more than 10 years. Theres a time clock thats new for me. Only hour for lunch in a crowded break room right next to a noisy warehouse. No breaks you have to tell your supervisor that you need to step away and log out of the system I feel like Im in prison already! It will be interesting to see how quickly I can adapt. Compared to what I was doing before, it feels really menial. I guess I didnt really think about that aspect before, although I was aware of it, I just didnt dwell on it. Hopefully, I can adapt and it wont be that bad. Its not full time and it doesnt mean I have my cell phone on 24/7 like before! Thats a relief, knowing that when I leave for the day Im done. Thorn 12-03-2003, 06:50 PM Im just sitting here listening to Slade and thinking how great of a band they were. It is such a shame that here in the US we need to have serious rock stars that write songs that always have to mean something. Bands like Slade, Sweet and T-Rex just didnt have the success they had in England. In the 70s these guys were all huge over there. I think Slade had more top British hits than any other band during that time. Sure, glam was kind of silly for the most part, but it was great music for the most part and sadly ignored here in the US (other than David Bowie and he didnt stay glam for long). I dont understand it.

As I was leaving for work today and driving past my yard, I noticed something strange on the top of a chair in the side yard. So I turned around and went back to have a look. I couldnt figure it out. A cat? It looked weird. It was a hawk. I think it was a juvenile Northern Harrier. He was just sitting on the back of the chair and scanning for birds no doubt. I wish I could have stayed and gotten the binoculars, but I had to go. I wonder if he managed to get breakfast? Our many birdfeeders feed more than just the songbirds theyre lunch counters for raptors as well. It kind of makes me cringe a bit, but its awesome to watch.

Last year or maybe the year before we had a Northern Goshawk in the yard and she was hunting doves. Now the goshawk is a much bigger bird than the harrier. She (I think it was a she) was in the aspen trees at the back of the property and suddenly she flew down and into a couple of doves. They took off but she was right after them. In a few seconds there was a poof of feathers and that was that. I didnt see the hawk again but we were down one dove.

Another time, we had a Coopers hawk closer to the house in the pine tree that one of our feeders hangs off of. It was waiting and when a small bird flew by (chickadee or nuthatch or similar) it was after it like it was shot out of a gun. The little bird flew all across and up and down in the back yard, trying to shake the hawk. It stuck to the little bird like they were tethered together. I have never seen anything like it. Incredible. I didnt know who to root for! But in the end, the little bird got away and the Coopers went into a nearby pine to sulk. It sat there for about 10 minutes and then left. By then all of the bird activity had completely stopped. It was an amazing sight.

Another interesting wildlife experience was when I was still with the Leech and was about 19 or 20. The guy he lived with had about 80 acres of land with a smallish river running through it. Across the street another person owned about the same acreage. Abutting the land on the river side, was a large holding for the Boy Scouts and it was over 100 acres. The general area wasnt very populated and so a lot of wildlife lived in the area. So one day, were all pretty stoned and its like 90 degrees out. There was a tree that fell across the river and if you went out on it and hooked your feet around a branch or two, you could hang over the trunk and dip your head in the water. It sounds really goofy but was just the thing for sweaty, wasted people to try.

So there we were, about 5 of us all hanging upside down with out heads in the water. After a few seconds someone says

Is that a bear?
We all try to look where he means, which is really hard because Im wasted and upside down with my head in a river. Finally after what seemed like forever (funny how time does that when youre stoned), I spotted it and try to point.
Yeah. Its a bear.
Someone says
Heh heh.
Someone else says
Cool. A bear.

And we all just continue to hang upside down looking at the black bear about 20 yards downstream. It looked at us, but obviously we werent much of a threat. I mean, seriously, a bunny rabbit wouldnt have thought we were much of a threat! The bear just continued drinking water and then gave us one last look at us and left. Ill bet it was laughing and couldnt wait to tell its buddies about the pack of wasted humans on the log. We stayed like that until our heads were completely numb and then we left too. We didnt even talk about it. Later the next morning, someone even asked the rest of us if it was real or if he was tripping. Since not all of us dropped, we told him it was probably real.

But my most amazing wildlife encounter was about 7 years ago when I went on my first whale watch. We have a lot of them up here, but Id just never gone on one. BSBG and I went with a small company and we left and went out past a huge ledge a few miles off shore to the deep water. There were probably 40 people on the boat. So a couple of hours goes by and the captain gets on the horn to tell us that he just heard from another captain reporting Right Whales about 40 miles off the coast up in the next state and do we want to go. A huge shout went up YES!

So a few hours later, we arrive at the coordinates and see another boat off in the distance. The captain says they should be around here somewhere&amp;hed keep watching the sonar. Then he shouts that the whole fish finder screen is red and that theyre just under the boat and he thinks there are three of them. Im up in the most forward section of the bow that you can get to and all of a sudden there was a huge swell and then I was covered in whale breath. I looked down and saw this enormous and remarkably human looking eye staring back at me. Other people were crying out in awe around me, but they all sounded far away.

This animal was looking at me with intelligence. It pulled away and joined the others. Soon, the third moved off quite some distance from the boat, but two of the whales stayed near. They spy hopped and flipper flopped and breached! It was the most awesome sight I have ever seen. They went no farther than 60 or 70 feet from us the whole time. They were so curious about the boat and what we were doing. The captain said that he couldnt help violating the proximity regulations because the animals were moving to us as fast as he could try to avoid them. They bumped and nudged the boat a couple of times and the feeling of being at their mercy was interesting because its not something we humans normally feel. It wasnt fear I felt, because I honestly did not see any hostility in those great eyes. These animals could have capsized the boat easily, but instead they played with us. They did that for hours, until it was dark and we could no longer see them.

They followed us for a bit and then they were gone. It was wonderful and inspiring and strangely sad at the same time. Here we were, a bunch of humans, looking at roughly 10% of the NRW population and the reason for that is another bunch of humans.

The captain said that their antics were highly unusual for their species. Usually, only Humpbacks and Orcas behaved like this and that Northern Right Whales were normally much more sedate and reserved and almost never interacted with boats or the people on them. Many times they came to touch the boat and to look at us. If BSBG could have hung onto my ankles, I could have touched them as we gazed at each other. There was joy and intelligence in them. When they would breach or play in the water, the sheer joy of it almost made me weep with envy and awe. There is joy in them, Im sure of it. Thorn 12-05-2003, 09:28 AM Today is a bad back day. I didnt even do anything this time and its out big time. I can hardly walk and Im kind of bent over slightly and to the left when I do. Its not a walk at all really, but more of careful shuffle like an octogenarians.

I just broke down and cried after I had to call work and tell them I couldnt give them extra hours like I said I would. I havent cried like that in a long time. Tears of frustration, pain and anger. I feel so useless. My body betrayed me again. Fuck I hate being trapped in it sometimes. If you have full mobility today without pain be happy and appreciate it. Right now I can really sympathize with those octogenarians I mentioned above. The next time I see one moving slowly in the mall or wherever, Im going to remember this day.

My back started to go yesterday actually. When I got into the truck to go to the gym, it jumped right up and said hello. Lifting my left leg for the clutch pedal was painful, but not as bad as it sometimes gets, so I went to the gym and ran 2.5 miles. It was a low-level twinge at that point, so I thought that it would eventually loosen and let go. But when I tried to do some Arnold presses, it really turned up the pressure and I couldnt lift. Unless it hurts, you have no idea just how much your lower back supports you and provides power for just about everything you do. I wish it were my rhomboids that were acting up on me. When they spasm, at least I can still walk like I havent been in a car accident.

Anywayenough about that. I have a job interview. The position was advertised in the local paper of all things and I sent my resume Wed night. I got a call yesterday morning. I knew I would. The position sounds similar to the last 2 Ive had, but in a different industry. Of course like all my other jobs, its hour away which is a hassle, but its one Im used to. Im interviewing on Tuesday afternoon after I finish my shift at the catalog company.

Look at that I said shift. Im already starting to think like that again. I havent worked a shift in so long that I have to leave myself notes to punch in and out so that I dont forget. Crazy. Im kind of excited about doing something else. The job I have now doesnt exactly require me to stretch at all. And it doesnt require any of my specific expertise. It isnt necessarily an easy job, but it doesnt need any creativity or drive to be good at it. You just fix whatever is wrong for the customer and then take the next call.

I miss the money most of all. Even though my last job was at the salary of the job I had previous to it, it was about twice what Im making now at the catalog company. 2 jobs ago, I made more in annual bonuses than the salary Im making now. Oh the dotcom bubble that was a wonderful thing. I knew at the time that I was making more money that I should have been and more than I probably would again (unless I went back into sales), so the next jobs salary wasnt that much of a surprise. Plus I went from a successful private company to a public company dealing with the pressure of the economic fall out. Paltry salaries and stingy bonus structures were standard.

I almost didnt take it, but when they went to the top of the salary range and gave me a bonus guarantee for a set period of time, I caved. I think they did as much as they could to get me. For all of the final suckage that I put up with, the experience taught me a lot and I met a lot of nice people. The fact that my brother still works there (and for the bitch that pulled the political game playing crap on me) makes me a little nervous, but hes a grown up and can deal with it if it happens to him. Thorn 12-06-2003, 09:25 AM My back is still a mess so BSBG had to do errands on his own today. For some reason he hates it. Even though I dont do any of the cooking, he still wants me to be with him for grocery shopping and stuff. Its really funny. Sometimes hell say that we have to leave (we go super early to beat the unwashed masses) and Ill say that I dont want to go and hell reply that well have no food. I think hes serious. Hed stay home too if I didnt go. But today, its obvious that even if the ground were perfectly clear (which it isnt it snowed last night), I should not be out walking around.

Were supposed to get a bunch more snow in the next 36 hours. Its like last year when each storm we had dropped a ton of snow on us. Last year was the most snow Id seen in overall accumulation in years. Snow by itself I dont mind. You just get it out of your way and youre good to go. And if you have any brains in your head at all, you put snow tires on and then even if the roads arent perfectly clear, youre still good to go. But ice thats a different story.

Every year we get a bunch of nitwits in 4WD minivans or SUVs or whatever theyre calling them these days, that think that they can go anywhere and do anything just because they have 4wd. Sorry folks, but ice has no traction so it doesnt matter how many of your wheels have grip theyre all going to slip! BSBG and I keep track of how many we see off the road each time it snows. Idiots.

Then there are the opposite people. The ones who refuse to go over 15 mph in their Ford Excessive because their afraid of the snow. Fuck me running! If its so scary stay the fuck home and keep out of my way. Driving in snow is not a big deal if you know how and arent taking foolish chances. Its a fine line between those two things. Good tires and knowing the basics about vehicle dynamics can make driving in the snow a lot of fun.

The best snow vehicle I have ever driven is a BMW 325ix. We had one a couple of years ago that we drove in the winter (the one we have now is too nice to get salt all over it) and it was awesome. Its 4WD but its rear-biased, so it still drives like a RWD car, but the front wheels will pull you out of just about anything if the back end lets go. Its fun to make the back end let go and play a bit. Its just so stable and so perfect for snow that Id beat just about anything off the line at a stop SUVs, pick ups everything.

Its too bad that BMW had to stop making true 4WD cars. Back when they made the ix, they made them right true limited slip in front and rear. The system they use now is not true 4WD its traction control, all its doing is engaging the brake on the wheel that is slipping. Thats not 4WD. They switched because the system in the ix was too expensive. The 1988 325ix we have now had all the paperwork with it when we bought it, including the original sales receipt. Back then the car was first purchased, it was just over $32,000. Thats a lot of money and less than 1000 of that model year were ever sold in the US. During the 4 years BMW made the car, they sold less than 6000 of them in the US. People who wanted 4WD were buying the much less expensive Audi Quattro and so BMW cancelled the ix. Theyre great cars though.

Wow do I slip into gearhead mode easily or what?? Sorry if I lost any of you. I just love my cars. Speaking of cars (just one last lament and then Ill shut up), I had to put the M3 away last night. We store it for the winter along with 2 or 3 of the bikes. This way I can put the truck in the garage and I dont have to clean it off when it snows overnight. I miss my car in winter. Not that I want to drive it in winter its too nice for the salt, too. I did it one year just to prove it could be done and it wasnt too bad. It wasnt great, but with proper tires, RWD does OK. Most people are morons when it comes to RWD. They always used to ask me in sheer wonderment how I could drive it in snow. Well fuck, it snows in Germany too and if FWD was really better dont you think theyd make their cars that way? The truth is, with knowledge and good tires, RWD does just as well as FWD in snow. Not as good as 4WD or AWD, but it does fine. Sorry about that mini-rant there, but I miss my car.

We seem to be in a snow lull right now. That will mean BSBG has to battle hordes of idiots buying every loaf of bread and gallon of milk in sight like they will be stranded for weeks. A little preparedness is ok, but everyone overdoes it every time. Youd think theyd figure it out after the first couple of times they got stuck with 4 gallons of milk past their expiration dates. I swear the people in this country are getting stupider every year. I hope hes not too crabby when he gets back.

Anywaythats all my ranting for today. Thanks for putting up with me. Heres a happy thought. Ill bake sugar cookies later to cheer us up and make the house smell yummy.

Oh and BSBG just called - he&apos;s doing Christmas shopping because everyone&apos;s too scared to venture out. He loves it! He&apos;s done this before - gone shopping in a blizzard. Mmmm ... presents! Thorn 12-09-2003, 07:54 PM It went fairly well I think. It was very weird interviewing with a manager who is about 10 years younger than me. Oh well. I&apos;ll be very surprised if I don&apos;t hear back for a second meeting.

That&apos;s about all there is to report. BSBG had to go out with some salesman tonight, so I am here fending for myself. Things at this job are getting very busy. The next week or so will be hell because people will be trying to get all kinds of Christmas gifts they should have bought a month ago if they had any sense! But I&apos;ll be nice and courteous and try to help every one of them while secretly calling them names and wishing them coal for Christmas!

Here&apos;s a weird thing - my house has been invaded by bugs. No, it&apos;s not what you think. Every year ladybugs come and hibernate in the cracks of the siding of the house and when it turns warm they stupidly wake up and swarm over the house. Usually it&apos;s in two spots and when it cools off they scramble back to their crevices. I don&apos;t mind them because they control the aphids and other really pesty bugs in the yard.

But this year, they have brought a few friends. Stinkbugs. They don&apos;t actually stink until you squish one, so we avoid that. For years we would see one or two in the fall and early winter but this year we&apos;ve seen a couple dozen. They&apos;re so fun to watch. They&apos;re brown, have flat wings and are about 3/4 of an inch long. They have large back legs that kind of stick up like a grasshopper&apos;s, and long antenae. They prefer to walk and they walk very slowly. They&apos;re bad flyers and make this huge buzzing racket that will scare the crap out of you if you don&apos;t know what it is. They sound like crashing minature kamakazi pilots. They eat pine nuts and are also supposed to hibernate like the lady bugs. Scribble likes to stalk them. Sometimes I find dead ones all curled up and crunchy. Ick. Thorn 12-12-2003, 08:56 AM Waiting to hear from a prospective employer is the worst, isnt it? I know its only been a day, but Im already torturing myself and its keeping me awake at night. Its obsessive but I cant help it. I would be perfect for this job and this job is perfect for me. Its high tech but in a different industry than my previous one, and one that I am even more geeky about. The company is small but growing so I doubt that much of the political, backstabbing, bullshit has crept in. Plus I might have a legitimate and best of all, corporately sponsored reason to go to CES in Las Vegas. I have always wanted to go but never had a chance. Anyway, Ill stop.

Just found out that BSBG has to go to Texas next week from Tuesday to Friday. Major Suckage. Even worse for him because theyre making him fly commercial. Ugh. A day or two without him is one thing, but three nights gets lonely. Oh well, it cant be helped.

Luckily I have Miss Super-friendly Scribble kitty here to keep me company. She was just all over me while I was brushing her and now shes in the window making noises at birds outside. The noises she makes at birds are similar to the ones she makes at flies, but distinct. Cats are weird.

I am savoring my new P.D. James novel and trying to make it last. BSBG brought it back for me last Saturday when I was too fucked up to join him on the rounds of errands. What a sweetie. He made a special trip to B&amp;N for it. I have to make it last because it will be years before I get another one. And since shes 80-something, theres a chance there wont be another one. This could be the last of Adam Dalgliesh. That will be a sad day indeed. Im glad that Dennis Lehane is younger than I am, and that Ill probably be able to read Gennaro/Kenzie books for the rest of my life. If he ever comes out with another one that is. Dont get me wrong I loved Mystic River, but come on Dennis, where are Angie and Patrick and Bubba??

I am absolutely thrilled that GWB and the Pentagon are only allowing coalition countries to bid on the more lucrative contracts involved with the Iraqi rebuilding effort. Hes finally acting like the conservative he campaigned as instead of the liberal he turned out to be. We are completely justified in this action and it is completely fair and logical. If you didnt expend any effort or money to help us with this, then why should you get to profit? Those countries that gave it their supreme effort to block and frustrate us should not get to now make money from their actions. Those countries that have supplied troops, aid and money should be allowed to recoup some of that back through the private sector. It is only fair. You put in, you get out. Simple. And it also sends a message that if you deliberately obstruct us, you wont get anything in the end. Reward your friends, punish your enemies. And the whining assholes actually think they have something to cry about. Fuck you. You didnt help, you get nothing. Youre not entitled to anything. Shut the fuck up.

Damn.

I say that hes acting like a conservative for a change, because practically in the same breath, hes allowed us to send out money to crim-aliens in Mexico. Thats right, you heard me and have probably not heard it anywhere else, but get a load of this. We are now going to send Social Security benefits to Mexican citizens who came here illegally (and are thus criminals), worked and can now apply for and receive Social Security benefits even when they move back to Mexico. Thats right your money is going to criminals in Mexico who dont work and dont support this country in any positive way. Criminals are getting your money. And they dont even have to be here to collect, were conveniently going to mail it to them in Mexico. How about we just put up a big sign that says Come on in well pay you to rip us off! Why dont we just line up and take a few 10s and 20s out of our wallets and give it to each crim-alien who crawls up from the border? What a fucking farce. No wonder the Social Security system is failing and wont pay me a single dime no matter how much of my money they steal now to give to Mexicans. And they somehow expect this newest fiasco to work? The medicare prescription plan will cost your kids and us BILLIONS and we will get nothing. There wont be anything left by the time we become entitled to benefits.

Notice I didnt say eligible. It disgusts me that they now have legislated my charity and have based the receiving of my forced charity on entitlement rather than eligibility. That means that just because someone has reached a certain age, they automatically get my money without consideration of any other facts. That means that someone with more money than me gets to have my money just because theyre older than I am. Oh yeah, that makes sense. Absolutely ridiculous. It makes me sick and if I keep thinking about it Ill just rage. So Im going to stop now and try to remember why on earth I voted for George Bush. For all the change it got me, I might as well have voted for Al Gore. Thorn 12-13-2003, 04:16 PM so what?? We watched Play Misty for Me the other day and I just have to say that Clint was hot. Wow. I never really dug him in the westerns and Harry Callahan just doesn&apos;t do it for me in that way - he&apos;s extremely cool, but the hotness factor is dialed way down (even in the Balaramas). But woah...in PMFM he is off the chart sex-ay. This kind of thing doesn&apos;t happen to me often, what with being married to a body builder, but when it does...I get obsessed.

The last time it happened I went on a John Malkovich kick. There&apos;s just something about him. Even now. I saw Ripley&apos;s Game a while back and he was just mezmerizing. I think it&apos;s the voice and the manner. He&apos;s so quiet and simmering. I watch Mary Reilly over and over because he&apos;s so damn hot as Mr. Hyde. Physically, he doesn&apos;t turn me on, but his presence is smoldering. Damn. In Dangerous Liasons he just melts the screen.

Ed Harris is another one that gets me. He&apos;s got such an interesting face and great blue eyes. I&apos;ve seen many of his movies and he has a fine range as well. But for pure hotness, Ed has my vote. He&apos;s weathered well. I love that in a man&apos;s face. Strong chin and crinkles around the eyes. And strong hands.

I haven&apos;t come across many new/younger actors with the kind of presence these men have. BSBG and I were talking the other day about this. Who will we enjoy watching when Ed, Clint, Gene, Al, Bob, Jack and John stop making movies? Sure, Edward Norton is a fine actor, but the world doesn&apos;t stop when he comes into the scene. Possibly Brad Pitt if he works on it some more. He&apos;s taken on some edgy roles and has made them work, but I don&apos;t think he has enough character to have the gravitas of a Connery. Neither does Depp, who is also a decent actor, but he&apos;s too pretty as well. Possibly Matthew McWhatsHisName has a shot at it. His face could weather well and if his acting improves, he might come close. Maybe Jude Law. Russell Crowe definitely has what it takes. Denzel too.

Oh well. At least we have Heat, Ronin, Dirty Harry, Thunderball. Glengarry GlenRoss, Ripley&apos;s Game, Crimson Tide and Chinatown. Thorn 12-14-2003, 09:22 AM Today is a great day weve captured Saddam Hussein. He was found in Iraq, hiding at the bottom of a tiny hole in the ground. What a long way he had come from all those palaces to a hole in the ground. I love it. On camera he didnt look so dangerous or crazy, more like a senile old man. If he continues to act like that, it will be hard to tell if its genuine. The likelihood that he will play-act the harmless old coot is pretty high. I mean, to maintain a regime like that, you have to be crafty as well as heartless. He will probably figure (and rightly) that he will cut a more sympathetic (pathetic?) figure if he acts like a daft old codger than if he acts like his real self; arrogant, cruel and well, dictatorial. I suppose there is some slight chance that his psyche has been crushed by the fact that his sons are dead and his country has been taken away from him and the people he terrorized and exploited for decades are now out of his grasp, but I doubt it.

But Im sure there will be plenty of easily-duped, bleeding-heart morons who will fall for it and demand that he be treated far better than he deserves. No doubt there will be some protest about his accommodations, his access to the media, his food, his bathroom and all manner of things. The fact that he completely destroyed a once beautiful and fully functioning country will be forgotten. People will forget that he twisted the once promising Baath reform party, into an agency of oppression to fulfill his own sick sense of government. No one will remember how he let the Republican Guard turn into a gang of thugs who preyed on the weak and innocent.

Im not convinced that he had WMD at the ready, but I do believe he tried very hard to get them and had processes in place to manufacture them in country. I also believe that if he could have, he would have struck at the US somehow. The only good thing I can say about SH is that he oppressed equally men and women. Women werent particularly set apart for special oppression honors. He didnt care for religion much and thus, those restrictions placed on women in other Arab countries didnt apply so much in Iraq.

Its interesting how the truly devout Muslims have no concept of live and let live. Not just the ones who take up arms in the extreme fight for what they believe to be right, but the peaceful ones as well. They scorn everything that doesnt line up with their dogma and they truly believe everything is insultingly, injuriously and damnably sinful. It seems to be pretty unique to just their religion, this extreme judgmental attitude. Thats whats so frightening. They cannot separate religion from anything. They only way they see to run things is by their religious code. They cannot set it aside and come up with a way to govern that doesnt involve Allah. They think the ability of Western countries to do this is completely wrong and that it is their duty to see that Allahs way is forced on them. They cant just let others be. Its interesting and scary. I dont know of any other religions that take it this far, except maybe the Catholics during parts of their history. And for a lot of that history, they were battling the Muslims.

The whole thing is weird to me. Arguing about religion is like arguing over who has the best invisible friend.

Anyway. It will be interesting to see what happens in Iraq now that hes captured. Will the insurgents attacks stop? I hope so. It sickens me to see our guys die every day. Saddam deserves to be turned over to the Iraqi government. We have no real claim on him and have no right to decide his fate. The thing of it is, can we trust that enough of the people with power in Iraq really do hate him and what he did enough to punish him and not return him to power? Hopefully someone puts a bullet in his head before that could happen. Thats really the only solution. If he continues to live, hell just serve as a pivot point for violence between those who still want him in power and those who dont. This will be our first whack at an evil dictator, so I hope we dont blow it. Thorn 12-18-2003, 05:36 PM All I have to say is - Christmas is the same day every freaking year. What, were you surprised??? Order your stupid shit earlier! Actually, I cant say this to anyone but I passionately want to about 20 times a day. All these people bitching about the price of air shipping. I cant even fake sympathy for them anymore. Its not my fault youre a dumbass and put off shopping this long. If you dont want to pay for the shipping go to the mall! People are so exasperating.

Still nothing on the job front with the company I interviewed with. I hope it is because they are swamped with the holiday season. I sent a couple of emails, but no reply. Im trying not to dwell on it.

My little cat Scribble is very weird. Every few weeks she changes her hang out spot. It was on a chair in BSBGs junk room. Then it was on the floor in front of the laser disc rack. Then it was behind the couch. Then it was on a chair in the living room. Now its on the floor in front of a bookcase. She also has an unnatural fixation with plastic bags. Yesterday she went in one. What do you have, a death wish? She is insane. And the other one, the Orange Menace, is mad because he chooses not to go out in the morning when I leave and then wants to go out when I get home and I wont let him. Hes off sulking somewhere. I swear, sometimes its like having kids. Theyre such weirdos.

Just had a microwave dinner. It wasnt awful but I really want BSBG back. I miss him and his cooking. Im helpless when it comes to the kitchen. I can make soup, spaghetti and toast. Possibly I could make eggs if I really had to. But apart from that, Im done.

I just read about the sentencing of the Green River killer Ridegway (and I always think of Stan Ridgeway when I hear about this guy). He is quoted as saying that he is sorry for the pain and suffering he caused. No hes not. Hes sorry for getting caught. If they let him out tomorrow, hed do the same thing again. What bullshit. I have always been fascinated by a serial killers ability to completely believe in their lies and their fantasies. They have no grasp of reality, and the extent to which they believe their own twisted perception of life is amazing to me.

Last night I started wrapping presents and ran out of boxes. It never fails that I come home with almost none and end up needing them the next year. I have to go to my moms house to get some. She laughs at me. Right now there are 8 presents for BSBG under the coffee table (no tree this year).

What is with the French President outlawing religious clothing in public schools and agencies? I dont understand his reasoning for it. He doesnt want people to be victims of religious prejudice. If the people in question felt it was happening, wouldnt they have some other means of redress? Couldnt they lodge a complaint or simply stop wearing the clothing on their own? Why does the Government feel the need to intervene and ban it altogether? How communist of you, Chirac. No wonder we hate the French.

I went to the gym and did shoulders today and felt kind of weak. Only could manage about 40lbs on military press. I did front first and then rear and could only manage 8 reps per set for the rears. Damn. I think its because Im not getting enough sleep. Im out cold and the stupid alarm actually wakes me. Usually Im awake before that or kind of half awake. For two days in a row the alarm has woken me straight out of a dream. Luckily tomorrow I get to sleep in. Ill go to the gym and the bank and then to pick up my order at work (which they screwed up part of, thats going to be a joy to get fixed).

When I made the bird feeder rounds today, the string on the suet feeder snapped and I didnt have time to fix it. So I brought it in with me today and now Scribble is sniffing the hell out of it, as if I brought in a live rodent or something. Its funny how incredibly curious this one is. The Orange Menace has his aloof manner down so thick that he couldnt be bothered to investigate something so pass as a suet cage. Scribble though has to check out everything. She goes on everything, in everything and has to know about everything. Im afraid shes going to kill herself one of these days.

Ok. Im done rambling. Ill try to be more interesting next time. Thorn 12-23-2003, 08:50 PM On Queer Eye for the Straight guy, Kyan always despairs of the men who shave too quickly and he cringes when they shave against the grain. How do boys learn to shave, I wondered. I guess their fathers teach them.

But how did my brother learn? My father has had a beard since I was two, three years before my brother was born. We have pictures of him when I was born, and he had some pretty righteous chops, but gradually over the next few months, they grew closer and closer together, eventually meeting in the middle over his chin. In the 70s he also grew his hair long and for a while, was often mistaken for a missing Doobie brother. Once he said that when his hair got very white, he would grow a ZZ top beard. He worked for a guy with a beard like that once, and I have to admit it was kind of cool. Theres an old gent who is usually at the gym at the same time in the morning as me, and hes got a very impressive white beard. If I had the courage, Id ask him if I could touch it. I like the springyness.

There was a dark side to the beard though. See, dad loves babies, always has. And he loves to pick them up and coo at them and cuddle them. Sometimes when he does this, the baby doesnt know what to make of it. At first they are surprised. Then puzzled. Then a little nervous. Then downright afraid and they squinch up their faces and cry. It breaks dads heart. He doesnt want to scare the babies. Its kind of funny to watch the expressions change as the kids process this weird person theyre looking at. Its funnier when they grab two handfuls and pull.

Only once did he shave it off when he desperately took a job after a long period of unemployment. I remember meeting my parents somewhere and wondering just what they hell that strange guy was doing with my mom. As I got closer, I still wondered until SMACK! Thats dad! Oh my god he looks weird. I literally didnt recognize him without the beard. He didnt remain clean-shaven for long because he couldnt stand that company and got another job as soon as he could. Phew I missed the beard, too. He just isnt dad without it.

But how did my brother learn to shave? Its not as though dad could have demonstrated on himself. I wonder if he cuts himself much.

The first time I ever saw a man shave was when I went away for a night in a hotel with one of my first boyfriends. I mean, it just wasnt something I was familiar with and he was pretty taken aback when I leaned against the bathroom doorway and watched him. He thought I was nuts, but Id never seen it done outside of television or movies. I never bought my dad shaving lotion or razors as Fathers Day gifts. I never felt that scratchy roughness on my cheek when he kissed me. I remember as a little girl thinking that my Uncles face felt like sandpaper and that I was glad that dads wasnt.

So now Im married to a man who shaves his whole head every other day. Funny. Sometimes I stand in the doorway and watch him, but these days it&apos;s mostly because his head is covered in shaving cream and I need a giggle. Thorn 12-29-2003, 09:12 PM Lately I have been fairly miserable and last night and today I again broke down into uncontrollable tears. I am simultaneously horrified, embarrassed and relieved by it. My back still isnt right and now its become a hindrance in other areas. Last night, BSBG and I tried to make love but I just couldnt be aroused. This is truly abnormal for me. Normally with him, it doesnt take much and Im into it and panting for more. Its like a switch and he knows exactly how to flip it. I orgasm without direct genital contact. Seriously. Thats why this next part makes me so sick.

Last night I didnt feel anything. It was exactly like I had a crossed wire somewhere. Instead of feeling it where I should when he touches me in a certain place, I just got a spasm in one side of my back and it was almost painful. Nothing aroused me sexually either by being touched or touching him. Then my lower back started to hurt and my neck (I recently somehow got my atlas jammed into the base of my skull and I have almost no range of motion in my neck) really started to bother me. Before that I was just pleasuring him since I was a lost cause. But when the pain built to the intolerable level it eventually reached, I couldnt do it anymore.

I rolled over and curled into a ball and cried. It all came crashing down on me. My man was disappointed. I was a failure. Pain. My body was betraying me again. He might leave me for another woman. My marriage was over. Hell never touch me again. Embarrassment. Disappointment. Anger. Frustration. Humiliation. Remorse.

He says he put his arm around me to comfort me, but I literally have no memory of that. All I remember is blindly running to the bathroom where I curled into a fetal position on the floor and wept. I felt so wretched that I couldnt go back to bed with my husband. I put on some sweats and went to the couch. He didnt come after me and that made me feel even worse. He didnt care. The insensitive lout didnt care. I am miserable and utterly destroyed and he doesnt care. Bastard.

I slept fitfully until 2 when I got up with an intense desire to be in my own bed, husband or no husband. I had weird dreams after that, but nothing that seems connected to my personal failure. When I woke up a little after 5, I got dressed and went to the gym without saying a word to BSBG. I was so humiliated I couldnt face him.

As I drove back I fervently hoped that he would be gone as usual and didnt linger to talk to me. Secretly, in the black part of my heart, I hoped he did. But to my relief he wasnt home and I went about my day as usual.

Except that I started to cry while making my iguana her salad. I nearly cried in the truck on the way to work (and its only an 8 minute commute) and then again shortly thereafter in the privacy of the bathroom. I had not been so brokenhearted no, thats not right. I had not been so sick at heart in 10 years. It was physically weighty and I felt that my life was ending. I was almost glad.

When I came home I loaded the dishwasher and went to bed. I knew this would get his attention and I so desperately needed him to come to me. To look at me. To ask what was wrong. To hold me. To be concerned. To be repentant. To be involved. Partially it was a ploy. The Drama Queen rising. But with this man, I really have to go overboard. He does not understand or even notice subtle changes in my demeanor. I literally have to sulk and be an overbearing jerk. To him its just a little thing, hes that blind to it.

I sobbed for nearly hour straight. The tears just wouldnt stop. I told him that my heart hurt. It literally hurt. Light a tight mass of glue inside my chest choking my emotions. Strangling my soul. Bit by bit he untangled me. He listened and held me and helped me put myself back together. Never have I felt so weak and stupid with him. Never have I shown him that messy part of myself.

He didnt know what to make of it, the poor man. Ive always been very together and strong and almost stoic in my dealing with pain, both emotional and physical. But this burden just became too much last night with my sexual failure. I just couldnt carry it alone anymore. He said he would help me. And he offered to somehow be less himself. Sweet. Impossible, but sweet. I even felt some tears of his own on my face. It would have been romantic in a way if it hadnt been for the 15 pound, purring Orange Menace who kept butting in.

My head is mostly back together. My heart, too. My body on the other hand, this imprisoning shell, is not. But I am going to work on that. I will seek out some help to see if anything can be done to ease the pain and to get me reasonably solid again. In the last few years I can count on one hand the number of days that I have felt good in my body. Its oppressive and finally crushed me flat. I am sorry that he had to witness my breakdown, but he wont leave me - even now. For that I am eternally thankful. Thorn 12-30-2003, 09:28 PM I feel marginally embarrassed by that last entry, but it was cathartic. I got it out and I feel better.

Today the sunrise was so beautiful that I got very distracted in my workout this morning. The sky was deep pink and moved to shades of orange and gold and salmon and it was very calming and somehow reassuring to watch. Like the earth was telling me that it would go on and that I would go on with it.

I have become an iPod junkie. BSBG gave me one for Christmas and he even had it engraved. Every day I have been tied to this laptop uploading CDs to it. I dont have a huge collection of CDs only about 300 or so (my brother has over 700!) so I think they will all fit on this thingwhich is unreal. My father couldnt get over it. The pace of technology has gone past what he knows. The thing I love the most is that I can hit shuffle and its like a radio station that only plays songs I like (and no annoying commercials). The only thing I wish it did was to allow me to remove a genre of music from the shuffle. Like when I only want to listen to classical and suddenly I get Social Distortion in there. And vice versa. I think I will have to create some elaborate playlists for specific types of extended listening. I think in some way it soothes me, makes me calmer to have my music with me all the time. Its weird, I know, but thats how it makes me feel. Right now I am listening to one of my favorite cats on a fence Van Morrison.

Playlist idea just dead people. Oh man. Thats awful, I cant believe I thought of it. I could have some Queen, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Warren Zevon with some Doors, Bobby Darin and Roy Orbison. Shiver. What a great band they have up there now. Entwhistle. Moon. Hendrix. Bonham. Scott. Hillel. Stummer. Janis.

There used to be a contest these couple of local DJs put on Dead or Canadian? They would pick a person (who was one or the other) and people would call in and guess whether they were dead or Canadian. It was hilarious.

Anyway, Christmas went well. Our routine is that we see my sister in law&amp;her family on Christmas eve and have dinner and exchange small presents. Then on Christmas morning we open our gifts here and then go to my parents house where we meet my brother&amp;his wife. We drink mimosas and open our stockings. Then we hang out, eat my moms wonderful pork pie and then open the gifts under the tree. It takes hours and is a lot of fun. Everyone was pleased with their gifts overall. BSBG and I got some duds, but nothing a couple of returns couldnt fix.

New Years eve is very quiet for us. We havent seen a midnight in years and we like it just fine. The year change passes over us silently as we sleep next to each other. This year I think Ill break out some champagne though its our 10th New Year together, so I think its deserved. Because I get gypped out of a turkey dinner that I can actually eat (my other sister in law makes weird stuff and thats where we have Thanksgiving dinner), my mom is cooking for me and my bro and his wife on New Years day. Sister in law is bringing the turkey (she gets one from work) and well bring the wine. Im psyched. It may turn into a new tradition. Like mom making me strawberry rhubarb pie for my birthday. Screw cake. Moms s-r pie is the worlds most perfect food!

AnywayIm very pleased by Burns&amp;Minous blossoming commitment and romance and sad about Aimees torturous ending with Ben. I know how it feels to be on both ends and know just how lucky I am to have BSBG. My heart goes out to both of you.

Brown-eyed-girl moving into your own place is the most scary and liberating experience youll ever have. Do it if you can.

Bambookie girl, Ive said it before and Ill say it again threesomes are icky!

Govtman is a pervert. ;) Thorn 01-09-2004, 08:45 AM No nibbles on the job front. Pretty disappointed about one. It would have been a fun job that I would have been good at. Not all hope is lost but I figure if I havent heard from them in 3 weeks its probably not positive. Damn. Trying to keep my spirits up.

And my head, too. I think I can feel my brain atrophying inside my skull. This job is so mindless and rewardless. I mean that in the sense that I have no sense of accomplishment. Im used to projects and tasks and deals that can be won or completed or have progress marked in some way. Im used to constant change and new challenges. This job is Boring and thankless. And the pinch of the low pay is really doing a number on me. I havent made this little money since I was in high-school. If I dont find a way to earn more money, it will seriously put a crimp in our summer pastimes. I just wont have the money to go to the track or to modify my car or even to buy new tires. Major suckage. Expensive hobbies oy vey.

The dilemma is should I try for a job just for the sake of the money or should I be more selective? The longer I wait, the worse it looks on my resume. Big gaps are difficult to explain without the explanation becoming a liability. Thats worrying. Im afraid that Ill never earn decent money again or have any prospects of an interesting job/career. Not that Im married to what I do, but I have a history with it and 10 years experience.

Well, cant sit here whining must go to the gym.

Ta. Thorn 01-09-2004, 06:15 PM Back again. When I was a little girl, my father used to call me Kristy Minstrel. I think it was because I was always singing. I wasnt particularly musical, at least I dont think so. I remember begging for a musical instrument in grade school, but it was beyond our means. The most we could afford was the plastic recorder I had when I was 8.

Clarinets. Trumpets. Flutes. Saxophones. All were out of reach. I used to envy those kids with the little black cases with the shiny metal latches. They went to band practice. Oh and then later when some of them got guitars I was positively green. I regret now that I didnt buy myself one when I got my first job. My brain was still probably malleable enough to learn music.

It seems like magic to me the fact that people can play music. For those who have read my previous scribblings and are familiar with The Leech, you may remember that he was a musician. A guitarist. Sometimes he would sit on the steps on summer nights and play quietly. I would sit upstairs and listen to the gentle chords rising on the soft air. It was magic. He would drift from something well known (like the opening to Day Tripper), to something esoteric and then to something that just came to him out of the blue. I dont know if he was really any good, but I loved it. It is like another language; music. These combinations of notes and chords, arranged in a way to stir the senses. Magic. It has always enthralled me.

My father hasnt called me Kristy Minstrel in a long time. I remember he would tease me by singing the wrong lyrics to my favorite childhood songs. Weeee all live in a black submarine, a green submarine, a purple submarine. And I would chastise him in my best 5-year-old grown up voice. All of a sudden I would give very much to hear him call me that again and sing Yellow Submarine wrong to me. Thorn 01-10-2004, 10:04 AM Yesterday I forgot to mention that I took Scribble to the vet. Another x-ray showed that the mass in her chest is still there. She has been acting so much better that I must admit I was hoping for a miracle. The only change in the mass is that it is no longer pressing on her esophagus and windpipe, thus shes able to breathe and get the oxygen she needs to remain active. It is pressing on her liver enough to push it out of place. Her stomach, too. The doctors advice was just to keep some prednisone on hand and start her on it again if her symptoms return.

The doctor suggested that it might be benign, but only a biopsy would show that. I dont want to do a biopsy. It would put me on the horns of a horrible dilemma. If the tumor was benign, I dont think I could bring myself to put her through the surgery. Shes such a little cat only 8 pounds, and they would have to cut open her tiny chest and create such physical damage and trauma that I would be heartbroken at being the cause. Im afraid it would kill her more horribly than the tumor. It hurts me just to think about it. If its cancerous, Im not any further along than I am now.

She was a good patient. She stayed right next to me on the bench and only yowled twice. She purred so much that the doctor could hardly hear her heart. At least thats what I told myself. I knew it was the tumor and the x-rays bore that out. Damn. Shes such a sweet and affectionate and lively little girl. Im going to hate losing her. I feel a little bit better knowing that we have extended her life and vastly improved the quality of it in the time she has left. She would have definitely died long before now had we not taken her in. Poor little one. Shes a sweetie.

BSBG is downstairs making a fire in the woodstove. As its in a stupid place and can provide very little in the way of heat for a house this size, we only use it when the temps drop below zero. It helps. Weirdly, I like it. As a child, my parents used wood and coal to heat the whole house. We only used oil for hot water. As a very young child I learned about the responsibility fire imposes on us. We all tended the fires. It was automatic. Every few hours go and look and see what needed to be done. Banking for the overnight was an art.

Our basement was piled high with wood, organized by type and usage. Downstairs stove wood was longer, upstairs wood shorter. Kindling over there. Coal over there. In the fall we would cut and split it and dad had a system so that he always knew which cords had aged enough to use. We would haul it from the back yard and throw it down the cellar steps to someone waiting below to stack it against the walls.

Every other year, dad would get a huge mountain of logs (or sometimes whole trees) delivered. We used to play in the piles sometimes. It was cool and dark and secret in there. We didnt know that just one shift from us would send thousands of pounds of hardwood down upon our soft little bodies. When my parents saw us they had 10,000 heart attacks and I swear Ive never been yelled at like that in my life. I understand now, but then I couldnt figure out what was so wrong. The wood was safe. Trees were havens. Wood gave us heat. How could it be dangerous? Ah, the innocence (stupidity) of youth.

We used to do the same thing with snow. When I was a kid, it snowed a lot more up here than it does now. Accumulation over the winter was several feet and the snow banks in front of the house by the road were sometimes 7 or 8 feet high. Perfect for digging tunnels and making caves and forts. One time when I was about 8, we made a whole rabbit warren, complete with little stools to sit on. Our attempt at a window failed and was the ultimate cause of parental investigation and shutdown of our little world. They made us stay in plain sight after that. The minute any of us would disappear, out they would come to make sure we werent digging a tunnel that could collapse and suffocate us. Parents knew how to take the fun out of anything.

I was a major tomboy when I was a kid. I tried to be a normal girl, but somehow I never got things quite right. I tattooed all my baby dolls with ballpoint pens. I drove Barbies camper in the woods and went 4-wheeling with her Corvette. One day I decided she should take up parachuting and threw her as high as I could. She caught in a tree and there she stayed. Every year her parachute (a handkerchief and some yarn) would get a little more tattered and eventually she fell to earth. Skipper suffered a worse fate. I threw her up onto the garage roof and she stuck. All summer I watched her grow blacker and blacker until she eventually fell off in a mildewy slide. Plop.

After Barbies, I became a fulltime tomboy and raced around the neighborhood with the boys doing boy things. Our neighborhood was complete with a swampy brook behind my house and the rest of the houses on the street, a sand pit down the road, a big hill for skateboarding and two dead end streets with thick woods beyond. Its a wonder any of us lived. Thorn 01-10-2004, 10:12 AM My most spectacular adventure happened when I was 11. A new girl, Joanna moved in around the corner. Everyone called her Jo. She was from England and we became inseparable. We decided to bike slightly outside of our neighborhood to a dead end street. We knew there was a trail leading into the woods at the end of it and thats where we wanted to go. The boys never went up there, preferring the sand pit because they could shoot bb guns.

We stashed our bikes behind some trees and ferns and headed in. The woods were almost bare of undergrowth and the pine needle layers were springy underfoot. We walked for perhaps 15 minutes, stopping to look under rocks and logs. Finally the trees thinned out and we came to a cleared area. There was a dilapidated barn and a handful of smaller out buildings. Jackpot!

We started with the smaller sheds. Pretty ordinary. Rusting tools. A wheelbarrow missing the wheel. Weird equipment whose purpose was a mystery. Then we got to the chicken coop. Inside and out in the little yard beyond it, were about a dozen chicken skeletons. Some were scattered and some were whole. Who leaves chickens? What happened to them? Did they starve? We picked up the little skulls and made chicken noises and laughed to cover up the creepy crawlies we both felt.

On to the barn itself. The big main door was still shut with a rusty hasp padlock so we had to find another way. To our surprise, the people sized door on the opposite side was standing open. It led into a narrow passage with a tack room immediately to one side. Dried and crumbly harnesses, leads and bridles hung on twisted hooks. Layers of dust and spider webs coated all. Next to that were the horse stalls. The opposite wall was solid, having no doors. The first stall was empty but the second wasnt. We shrieked with fright and slammed backwards into the dry and splintery wall. We clutched each other, feeling the goose bumps rise on the others arms.

Leaning against the side of the stall, with its chin hooked over the divider was a fully upright horse skeleton. Some of the smaller bones of the tail and some of the ribs had fallen away, but the rest was still together and somehow, miraculously still upright. The poor beast must have died on its feet. A frisson of terror and sorrow shook both of us and we were speechless for about a minute. Then we moved in closer to examine the dried sinews wrapped tightly around the knees, shoulders and neck. There were bits of fur and skin on the skull and some of it had slid to cover the teeth with their tatters. More had gathered around each desiccated hoof. We were in awe. Never before had I seen anything so beautifully disturbing. We didnt dare touch it for fear of it collapsing.

We moved into the larger part of the barn and it was filled with all kinds of junk. I remember a few old farm machines, some boxes and trunks and strangely, and old birdcage on a crooked stand. Along the walls lining the top of the foundation stones were large glass jugs filled with clear liquid. Moonshine! we squealed and immediately tried to get one open. The smell was enough to back us up quick.

I the center of the large space was a deep, circular concrete pit about 10 or 12 feet deep. It too was filled with junk. Spiky and jagged metal bits bristled at us, rust gently flaking in the shafts of sunlight. We had no idea what it could have been for. Torture? We shivered in the heat. Looking up we saw the hole in the roof that admitted the birds we saw nesting in the rafters. Swallows by the look of them. Bats probably too.

Over to one side there was a ladder leading up to an overhead room. It was set at about a 45 degree angle to the floor and only went up about 12 feet. Despite the missing rungs, Jo needed to go up to the hayloft and check things out. I stayed down with the moldering junk, trying vainly to figure out what each thing was for. In a few minutes I heard a terrible crash and a scream from Jo.

Shed fallen through the floor of the hayloft and landed in the room below. Luckily, that was the part of the barn where they must have kept old feedbags because she landed in a pile of decaying burlap. Stinky but not fatal.

She dusted herself off and caught her breath, but we were done. That final scare was enough to send us on our way. We left the barn exactly as we found it. We said goodbye to the horse and the chickens and the empty birdcage and walked away. We hardly said anything to each other on the way back home and after that we didnt talk about it. We never told anyone about what we found. If the boys heard, they would go and break stuff - we knew it. Somehow the place seemed sacred and not deserving of such disrespectful treatment. There was an aura of captured time and sheltering safety about the place, despite the relics of death.

A few months later, Jos family moved to a town about an hour away and I never saw her again. The whole experience at the barn seemed unreal when I only had myself to validate it. Like a dream. I never went back to change that. Thorn 01-12-2004, 06:17 PM I didnt need to panic about our sex life. Its just fine. Phew. My back is still screwing me up as far as my normal tactical responses, but we have found ah other avenues that are pretty effective. What a relief. After we were done, I told him that I was worried that wed never be able to do that again. He laughed and said that he didnt see any problems there. I really was nervous about it and ashamed of myself. But all is well and Im very happy about it. Not that you care, but hellI dragged you into this stupid scenario, I might as well get you out of it.

Just talked to two old friends in the last few days. One (Red) is living in Virginia and weve been out of touch for a while. She recently ended an engagement to a cop. Ive never known her in a relationship, and I didnt see this one go down, but she says it was ugly. It started out ok but then got worse. First it was his always being broke. Get this he got her engagement ring and gave it to her and then the jewelers called to say they couldnt approve his financing after all and that hed have to pay for it all at once. He said he was maxed out on his credit cards.

You can see this coming cant you. He suggests to my friend that she put the ring on her card and he will pay it. Oh sure, and Ive got a bridge in Brooklyn to sell ya. So now shes paying for an engagement ring for a marriage that will never take place. She cant return the ring, nor can she sell it for its full value. Oy vey. What an asshole.

She also said that he used his police resources to check up on her background. He used her social security number to find all kinds of information about her. He intercepted her emails and looked at her phone logs. As you can imagine, she freaked. His answer when she confronted him about it was that he doesnt trust anyone. Oh yeah, thats just the perfect thing to say to the woman you asked to be your wife. Fuck me running!

The icing on the cake is that she sold her beachfront condo for a house where they could live as well as have room for his two sons from a previous marriage. He didnt contribute one dime and then had the gall to try to bully her into giving him half. She laughed and told him to try. His name is on nothing and he hasnt paid for any of it.

I feel so bad for her. Reds an avid kayaker and when she had the condo, all she had to do was carry her boat from the porch, across the beach and put it in the water. Now she cant take the boat with the little sports car she got at his behest (because he had the SUV to haul her boat and wouldnt a sports car be fun?). What a disaster.

Plus, she got royally screwed where she works (similar to what I went through, but different enough) and she had to take a transfer that pays way less than she was making. Because of that and the increased mortgage on the new house, she has to have a roommate. This woman is almost 50 and hasnt lived with anyone for any length of time since her divorce when she was in her 20s. She says its working out OK, but I can tell she doesnt like the lack of privacy with a roommate.

Shes now dating a Navy Lieutenant and says shes in love all over again. What a nut. I hope she protects herself better this time. Knowing her like I do, she must have seriously been in love to give up so much of her independence for this man. What an undeserving asshole. Shes pretty sanguine about it, saying that the worst misery she can imagine for him is simply his current existence. He trusts no one and has no friends, a ruined marriage and no money and worst of all no Red!

My other friend is slightly older than Red and Ive known her for 10 years. She just recently became a grandmother and now baby #2 is on the way. So much for breastfeeding as birth control! Shes done an about face in her life that is stunning. She was in high technology sales for 15 years or sodid the management thing and the rep thing and wanted a switch. So shes in nursing school and has about a year and a half to go. She wanted something portable that she could work anywhere and make money. Nursing is it for her.

I really admire both of these women. Theyve taken on life with full vigor and they throw off anything negative that tries to bring them down. In some ways, I think Ive gotten away with having to face that kind of adversity. Knock on wood that I wont have to. BSBG has never given one sign that he would ever abuse me or use me like these women have been. I trust him completely, but am not totally vulnerable in the relationship. It didnt happen deliberately, it just happened. I am very lucky.

Oh and my other weird friend Olga in Washington says that they might be able to move back here in Feb/March. Im so psyched. Weve been friends for 25 years and I miss her.

Went to the gym today and destroyed my legs. I am going to be sore! Its good though. I havent made my legs sore in weeks. I did the same to arms last Friday (they still hurt today) and shoulders too. Sometimes I get in a rut with weight and stay at the same level for longer than I really need to. Im pretty cautious about increasing weight dont want to tear a ligament or tendon, but I was due. Now do military press with 50 lbs and upright rows with 60. No wonder my delts hurt! Friday was a good cardio day too I felt like I could have run all day. Must have been my angry death metal work out mix! Thorn 01-20-2004, 08:58 AM Got a phone call from my brother yesterday. It was weird because it was just after I sent him an email at work, but thats not what called to talk about. He said that the bitch that forced me out of my job was laid off yesterday and so was her boss (the architect of my old bosss removal with exactly the same tactics). My brother worked in her dept as well and agrees with me that she was useless and he isn&apos;t sure exactly what she did. One of those. Him, too. Its about time. Between them they have all the scruples of a dead dog. Even though they probably got nice severance packages, its sort of comforting to hear that it happened. The whole what comes around goes around theory proves out once again.

Anyway, it was BSBGs birthday this weekend. He turned 40. Other than the fact that he has a lot of gray in his mustache, he doesnt look 40. His shaved head is sort of confusing for people on his age, so I dont think Im too biased. He certainly doesnt act 40 in many ways. We didnt have a big party or anything (not his style) and this year I didnt get him anything huge (being poor sucks) just a 512 mb jump drive (geek) and baked him some chocolate chip cookies. He liked the cookies. He also gave me his 128mb jump drive. I wish Id thought of this earlier. No not buying him a new one so I can get the old one (although it is a bonus) I mean the jump drive concept.

See, I have always kept a book journal on computer. And like an idiot, I never backed it up and we lost our hard drive last year, so 5 years worth of book journal went up in smoke so to speak. Im so pissed because my memory is so awful that keeping a journal is the only way I can remember anything I read. Once I read the summaries and my comments about the book, I can remember some of it. Without it to aid me though, I cant remember much.

Its like that with a lot of things. BSBG is my memory. He remembers when we have done stuff. He remembers parties and things people said. He remembers things that happen to us and when. I dont. I really have to become immersed in something to remember it at all. My childhood is gone for the most part. High school is gone almost completely. My 20s are almost non-existent. Big holes in the first half of my 30s. I dont think its normal.

Sometimes its very frustrating because other people can spit back details of incidents where I only remember vaguely or very few particulars. Sometimes I think that people think I am a flake because I dont recall some things. Especially when I have a mind like a steel trap when it comes to technical information and specifications. That is a sickness. I absorb and retain great detail when it comes to procedures or how do things as well. For example, I just learned the basics of a new (to me, the program is as old as dirt) computerized order taking and customer service program. I was answering other newbie questions inside a week. Show me once and I wont forget. But try to remember my 30th birthday or 2 Christmases ago forget it. Theyre gone.

I do remember some things but they are isolated like desert islands. Some of the things Ive put down here and in the physical journals Ive kept all my life are like stakes in the ground that mark buried things. I know something is down there, but if you remove the marker, I wouldnt remember where or what. Once in conversation, my mom said something about a painful breakup with one of my first boyfriends. She says that I told her that he told me that he only dated me on a bet with his friends. That they said he couldnt stay with one girl for a whole year and he set out to prove them wrong. That he told me this when he broke up with me. I have absolutely no recollection of it at all.

I remember other things about the relationship; we met in a photography class, he refused to have his own picture taken, he worked as a radio dj, he looked just like Stephen Baldwin, he wore Polo cologne, we had sex on the swings in a playground, his mother would stand at the top of the stairs and yell Im coming down now whenever we were alone in his parents living room, his father had a genuine Eames chair, they kept bees, he drove an old Honda and then bought an old police cruiser and got a vanity plate that said OINK, we used to look for parking kids and scare the crap out of them with that car (the spotlights were the best). He and BSBG share a first name. Mostly I remember this and other stuff because I have the journals from that time in my life.

Thats comparatively a lot more information than I remember about another man I dated, years later. I was about 22 and we had primarily a sexual relationship but we stayed together about a year and a half. My mother says that I told her he brought up marriage to me many times and I always panicked. I dont remember that at all. I remember that he cooked, had a pool and a hot tub. He listened to heavy metal. He worked out at home on a bunch of gym equipment. He drove a 300ZX in summer and bought a POS every winter and sold each of in the spring. He had a soft voice with a rasp to it and looked a bit like Jean Reno (not exactly but similar). We had sex constantly but I cant remember any of the particulars. See what I mean? I have no journal for this time in my life somehow they got lost. Oh something just came to me. I was lying on his couch in jeans and a t shirt that had about a million tiny buttons down the front. In a silly voice he yelled Oh I LOVE buttons! and jumped on me and started undoing them with his teeth. Wow flashback!

I dont knowmaybe its normal. Maybe everyone remembers like this and my mom and BSBG are the freaks for remembering every little detail of everything. Yeah, thats what I think. Theyre the freaks. :loopy: Thorn 01-23-2004, 08:37 AM For the first time I watched an entire State of the Union address. Sure Ive seen pieces of prior speeches, but since I hate Bill Clinton, the less of him I had to stomach, the better. I was not a Bush supporter I voted for McCain in the primary. So much for that. I did notice the sour grapes attitudes of most of the democrats in the audience though. Could Ted Kennedy BE a bigger asshole? He looks dyspeptic 24/7. Maybe he needs an enema. And that lying witch Hillary with that self-righteous smirk on her face I wanted to slap it off of her. The thing that killed me is that every time Bush mentioned not spending money or cutting taxes, none of them cheered, but when he talked about spending my money and taking more of it away to give to other people, they all got excited and cheered. I cant imagine why anyone would vote for someone who wants to legislate more of your personal freedom and separate you from more of your money to spend it on things that you wont benefit from. I dont understand it at all. And to think that some people actually think the world is not a safer place with Saddam out of power and in custody. Lose touch with reality much people? Heads so far up their asses they cant see daylight.

But anywayI really need to stop watching morning news on my days off. Could the widow Atkins whine some more please? WAAAH! You dont like my husband, I demand an apology! WAAAHH! Someone get me my wubby, I need a nap. What a whining baby. So Bloomberg thinks he was fat and didnt like your food and doubts that he died from a simple slip and fall, its not an insult its an opinion. Lady, only you feel insulted by this crap because you see that maybe public opinion is slipping and the money might start to dry up.

It will be interesting to see the long-term effects of the Atkins diet as interpreted by the masses. The fact is that most of the people practicing this diet are clueless when it comes to nutrition in general and only view things in the most simplistic terms. In short, they go overboard and do not maintain a balance. As I foresee it, there will be a few results; memory and concentration problems and cholesterol problems as well as possible kidney damage. The people scratching their heads at that sentence need to do some research.

I did shoulders heavier than ever yesterday 30 lb dumbbell Arnold presses!! Compared to BSBG its nothing but I feel good about it. Maybe its because I was listening to London Calling yesterday. Today is arms and I shall go and destroy them.

My bro came over to get the surprise I got for him and he told me that a bunch more people got let go at my former company. As a slimy organization theyre doing well they offered some folks a sales position so that if they refused, they wouldnt have to give them severance and could deny their unemployment benefits. That is so awful. What gratitude for years of service pumping up the stock price so that the same upper managers that are doing this can get richer. Really makes you wonder why there isnt more violence in the workplace. And of course, bro said that truly useless people are being kept on and people that work hard and make goal and have an actual work ethic are being shown the door. It makes me angry, but theres not much I can do about it. I just hope he isnt one of the future victims.

My own job search has kind of stalled. Im just not motivated. I dont want to get back in the corporate bullshit game. Sure I want to make decent money again, but what I have to go through to do it just disheartens me. I feel like a failure in the sense that Im derailing my career, but I just cant snap out of it. The two jobs I was feeling positive about have not come to fruition for me and that makes it worse. There is no wind in my sails at all for this effort. I just scan and delete most of my emails from Monster. I just cant get motivated. I feel like its a futile effort. That nothing I do for any company will be appreciated and eventually Ill end up on the scrap heap again. Why put myself through that? It seems pointless. I dont know what to do about it. I know I should do something, but what? A headhunter? Just the thought makes me tired.

The thing is, there isnt anything that I would consider to be my overwhelming passion. People dream about a job that they actually enjoy to get up in the morning and to want to go to work and love what they do. I dont think that exists for me. I think I will always be one of those people who have a job that they do because they can and thats it. Nothing blows my skirt up. Thorn 01-27-2004, 08:19 PM Only 2 more days of this mindlessly boring job where I am surrounded by vicious people with little minds and large waistlines (and one more day of this Primary and being surrounded by Democrats). Today was a horror. These people are nuts. They snap at each other and are always defensive and antagonistic. I truly dont know how they stand each other. Only 2 more days. I can handle it.

I picked up my last employee purchase. A really good pair of Asolo hiking boots. I have been meaning to pick up a pair of boots that are better than the ones I have, but I didnt do it last year. The money was the thing and these seemed perfect and I could get them for about $70 less than retail, so what the hell. It makes me want to go hiking right now.

BSBG and I did some this year but not as much as I would have liked to. I would like to go once a month or so. He seems to think thats doable. We have beautiful country here and I have a great Lowe Pro backpack for all my photo gear and theyre both going to waste. Were both in good shape and have similar strides, so we hike well together. He doesnt mind when I stop to photograph things either. Once when I was out on my own, I passed this overgrown driveway with two stone pillars at the end. W hen I walked up the gently sloping gravel road, I came to a strange rock foundation (actually it was curved and only 3 sided, so who knows what it was for) and a burned out shack on the hill above it.

I love finding places like that. One year, I found an old barn made entirely of stone. Inside one room inside I found some receipts for apples the surrounding development had been all orchards once upon a time, and this was the main barn. It was cool. There were tack rooms and horse stalls, a huge elevator system and carriage houses. It had a huge main door in the center of the long main section and a drive way lined on both sides with oaks. Absolutely beautiful. Behind it, about 100 feet from the house was a freestanding chimney with fireplace. I have no idea if it was always freestanding or part of another building that had come down. I took about 3 rolls of film there. Years later I heard that someone bought it and I havent been back. I prefer to remember it the way it was.

The same year I found that, I also found an abandoned house and barn. The house had been abandoned a long time because it wasnt wired for electricity, which had to have come to the area by the 1940s. There were fireplaces in each of the corner rooms and a huge iron stove in the kitchen. The upstairs bedrooms had fireplaces as well. There were decrepit trellises that must have once held flowers but now only held weeds. The most astonishing thing was in the barn. The east facing wall was dominated by a huge window that was easily 2 stories high and probably 10 feet wide. It was made up of many, many panes and curved at the top. Amazingly, not one of the panes was smashed. It was beautiful. The barn was used for livestock since there were feeding and watering troughs in the center with various holding pens and stalls on each side. A nice tack room, too. I still pass by it from time to time and it is still there, and still falling to pieces. I did a bunch of B&amp;W studies of it at the time. One of the dilapidated front porch is my favorite. Someone propped up part of the roof with a two-by-four and the floor and steps were all warped. That one came out quite well.

I have always had a fascination with little shacks on the sides of roads that you see that have no apparent connection to their surroundings. From time to time I have photographed them and had the idea of doing a book about them. My dream is to have different well-known authors do a short story based on a single photograph of an abandoned little shack. That would be cool. Sometimes I go out driving to look for them and photograph them. I always feel slightly foolish doing so though. People must think Im some kind of freak when they drive by this crazy lady in the bushes with a camera and tripod! Still, I do it anyway. Theyre so mysterious. I imagine why someone would have built it and why it was falling down. What happened to the person who used it? I have a weird little collection of these now. Makes me want to get out there.

The other thing I have a lot of photos of are graveyards. In my area of the country, they go back to the 1600s and some of them are quite interesting. Not only the stones (which I love to read and photograph and even have a book on how to interpret the various carvings on them) but the gates and the settings. I spend a lot of time in old graveyards. Theyre very peaceful. They can tell you stories too. One I found several years ago had a colored section in the back in the corner. One stone, which I photographed, was for a man who was a faithful retainer to a local family. He died 50 years before someone put up a marker. Amazing.

If I keep a these kind of memories, I will be raring to go come spring. I can play with my old faithful cameras and try out my new boots!

I still shoot film (transparencies) and my cameras are ancient manuals. They run without batteries (if I could only still remember how to meter in my head) and are very simple. I use all Olympus. Two years ago, my dream was realized. I bought an OM3 with a 90mm f2 macro lens (the worlds sharpest macro lens). It was about $1200 but I had to have them. I also picked up a 35mm f2 lens which I use almost constantly when Im shooting. I dont know how I went all this time without one. I have more stuff than I can conveniently carry, so more often than not I take the OM1 and the OM3 along with the 35mm, 135mm and the 24mm. I use straight lenses almost exclusively. My zoom gets almost no film time. I really should get rid of it, but I keep it around for those situations where Im afraid the lens might be damaged and so then I bring the OM-G and that lens because theyre cheap to replace.

I just drive and see where I end up. Last year I found a house with extensive gardens that is open during the summer for tours. It was pre-season so I hopped the chain and wandered around. It was beautiful. I got some of my favorite pictures of a secret grove of rhododendrons and some hens and chicks growing on the granite steps. I was alone and had all the time in the world for composition and lighting and just enjoying the scenery. I cant think of too many other times where I was more content. Thorn 01-28-2004, 06:44 PM Just have to make a note here for my own records/satisfaction.

I did 3 sets of incline presses with 45 lb dumbbells today. One set with 12 reps and the other with 10. The hardest part is getting the weights where I need them, not the actual lifting part. It sucks having no partner to spot me. I dont know what Im going to do from hereIm not sure I could get 50-pounders into position alone. Oy vey.

My last day is tomorrow and I can hardly wait. Although I will have to figure out something quick since Im short of cash as it is. And we just had to get the truck fixed (radiator and muffler) and the dryer died so we bought a new one. Damn. At least my gym membership is good for another 4 months.

Elvis is making me nervous. Shes gone all mental and spends a lot of time digging and scrabbling around in her enclosure. Shes also not eating much. Her appetite usually decreases in winter, but not this much. Shes dehydrated (her skin is all loose) and shes losing weight (very noticeable at the base of her tail). I think Im going to have to see about force feeding her yogurt. If iguanas stop eating, their gut bacteria dies (like cows and other animals, iguanas rely on a huge gut with lots of bacteria to break down their food). Yogurt can help replenish bacteria and is often used with iglets in captivity to get them started (in the wild they eat adult ig poop and get the bacteria they need that way). Sigh. Its always something.

She could be acting this way because its breeding season and her hormones are acting up she&apos;s turned all orangey on her legs and dewlap so that&apos;s a sure sign, but it&apos;s too early for the no eating thing. Since I dont have a male, any eggs she lays will be infertile. She hasnt laid eggs in about 3 years, but she has. Her first clutch was about 20-25 eggs. Theyre oblong and soft and about the size of your thumb to the first joint. The females&apos; abdomens get so full of eggs that they have no room for food towards the end of the gestation. After they lay the eggs they pig out!

Maybe a nesting box will calm her down and shell eat something. She cant be close to laying yet, its not time. I looked her over and I couldnt see any egg outlines the way I could the last time she was gravid. When she got this way the first time, I had her x-rayed and it was soooo cool to see all the eggs in there. With her spinal deformity (and its not MBD, I am positive), the vet an I thought she might have trouble laying but she did fine. I would have had her spayed at the same time he removed the eggs. Spaying igs is tricky and we would have brought in a doctor who has lots of experience. You can remove all the oviducts but still leave an ovary and the ig will get egg-bound and possibly die from infection. Hopefully it wont come to that.

My last ig was a male and he was much less complicated. All he needed at breeding season was a green towel and some space. Male igs have the largest testes (by percentage of body weight) of any animal on earth and two penises (called hemipenes) and their sex drive is unreal (even to rival GovtMan&apos;s! ;) ). They routinely masturbate during breeding season and will leave little presents if you dont give them a toy. George loved his green towels. I would buy 4-6 green bath towels every year (well would YOU wash them??) and he would drag them around and hump them until they were unspeakably wrecked. He wasnt as aggressive as some males Ive heard of, but it was a good idea to stay out of his way.

It was harder when I got my period during his breeding season. That and wearing red or orangeoh man! Prying a horny 6 foot iguana off your leg is a real work out! He could smell the hormonal change in me and bright colors are very attractive to iguanas especially red and orange since both the males and the females turn orangey during breeding season. But even with all that, I didnt need to deal with an egg box and humidifiers and all that stuff.

Since you cant sex igs until theyre 2 years old or so, when you get a baby its always a crap shoot. I thought Elvis was a boy (obviously) and lookee at my surprise. Still, shes cute and the nest box really isnt too much trouble. :) Thorn 01-31-2004, 12:28 PM Today I was remembering my familys garden when I was a kid. I saw a news segment on how best to keep your vegetable seeds over the winter if you hadnt planted them. I remember my mom had a big shoe box full of Burpee envelopes with seed packs inside. Every year about this time or maybe in February, she would take it down and sort through what she had. Different plants had to be started at different times. Dad would set up grow lights and platforms under the stairs in the basement. The woodstove kept things nice and warm and when we added iron pots of water on top of the stove to evaporate, it was the perfect environment for seedlings. Later in April we would transfer the little plants to the greenhouse in the backyard. I also remember some kind of magazine or maybe it was a series of books called Organic Gardening - it was a bible and mom&amp;dad were always looking up something.

I loved the greenhouse. It smelled so peaty and good. It was warm and almost tropical. Once we grew some catnip and one of the cats got in there, ate the entire plant and promptly passed out in the middle of it. We found her hours later, still comatose. It was the last time we grew catnip.

We grew practically everything; beans, cucumbers, tomatoes, squashes, peas, peppers, lettuce, cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, beets, carrots, radishes and a couple of times potatoes and corn. The deer would come at night and eat the corn, so we stopped planting it. Dad would dump some of the cats litter box into holes to form a perimeter around the garden and that effectively kept out rodents and rabbits. I do the same thing today to protect my perennials. Dad was also a crop rotator and we had more manure and compost than anyone in a 5 mile radius.

Weeding was a dreaded chore. Soooo boring and buggy. I suppose now with the advent of walkmans and iPods, it wouldnt be so bad but back then it was torture. So was picking beans. Other veggies I didnt mind so much but picking beans sucked. It took a long time because the plants are so bushy and its hard to see the beans. But the main reason it sucked was because of the huge number of bugs that liked to eat bean leaves. They would get disturbed and come whizzing out straight at my face. I especially hated Japanese beetles not only did they fly crazily but they also made an awful buzzing noise. Gross. I hate them to this day.

But in the end it was worth it. We have yearly pictures of us at a picnic table piled high with the produce we grew. One of my favorite things was to go into the garden with a knife and salt and pepper shakers and eat cukes and tomatoes right off the vine. Then get a few peas straight from the pods. Dessert was a handful of raspberries and blueberries. We had a peach tree too and in July/August wed have the best little peaches. Mom canned them and in January it was like a little slice of heaven. Pretty much every vegetable we ate all year came from that garden. Looking back, it was one of the best things of my childhood. Thorn 02-02-2004, 09:18 AM Honest. National Ballet Day. 2-2. Get it?

Seriously. It is.

Anyway, I am sick today. A head cold. Picture a person with a tissue up her nose as you read this. I am hardly ever sick but when I get a cold it invariably ends up as bronchitis or pneumonia within a week. Ive had asthma for over 30 years now and had one doctor for most of those years. It got to the point where I knew that I had bronchitis and all I would have to do is tell the staff and they would get me drugs. My old doctor has since retired and the doc I have been visiting for the last couple of years has moved to Dallassooo, I will have to see the doc that took over her practice (probably by the end of the week).

I actually watched the game yesterday and am glad that the hometown team won. I used to watch football all the time until I met BSBG. My mom is a huge football fan (Giants) and Sundays at the house were solid football. Mom could actually sit through 4 games in a row. Then there was Monday night. If I was in bed my sleep would be punctuated by shouts of kill him! or strip the ball! or first in goal to go! or loudest of all, touchdown New York!. In my early twenties I actually went to a local bar to watch the games. I was the only woman.

But then when I met BSBG I stopped watching. I did it because he hates football and the fact that I have to talk to the TV when I watch it. Just try to explain why you have to to an engineeroy vey! :rolleyes: It wasnt a big hardship, not watching football. But I watched part of the AFC championship game and got into it a bit. So I warned him that Id probably watch the Superbowl. It was funny, he stayed in the living room and read gun magazines while listening to Chopin. I stayed in the home theater room and tried not to yell kill him! too much. It was a good game.

We had another Coopers hawk in the yard hunting the birds that come to our feeders. S/he was beautiful and was in a clump of trees about 15 feet from the house. We got a few pictures but they werent that great. But seeing it was breathtaking. S/he dove into a shrub at one point and a little junco dashed out a near miss. I didnt know which bird I felt more strongly about the one who got a way or the one who went hungry. Thorn 02-05-2004, 10:06 AM So I got sucked into Good Morning America today and saw a segment with two women that were being guided through the process of finding Mr. Right. Some woman with a book was on and the two went on dates (but they were very pretty and the guys were babes too, so how freaking hard can it be for any of them, really?) and put this womans advice to work. It was weird but made me think about how I found my Mr. Right.

It all boiled down to me being me. Totally me, not just part of me.

In my other relationships I was only partly me. I fell into the trap of thinking that I needed to continuously show the facet of my personality that initially attracted the man I was with. So with Dan I was always feminine and nurturing and slightly passive. I thought that if I showed the other sides of my personality, that he wouldnt remain attracted to me. It wasnt too awful because it really was me he was experiencing. I wasnt trying to be somebody else. But after a while it became stale because I was bored and I think he was too.

With the Leech I was always strong and independent. I felt like I had to be constantly propping him up and reassuring him and showing him that I didnt depend on him. I didnt want to be a burden because I knew he would collapse under the weight of any need I displayed. But after a while, the strain showed and I did need support and he couldnt handle it (at least I got that part right).

So after that break up, I decided to just be me. I indulged all sides of my personality. I became an athlete. I moved into an apartment alone. I made friends. I learned a new profession. I stopped wearing makeup. I started wearing flattering clothes. I stopped hiding. I didnt have to be an extreme. All aspects of what made me were explored and given outlets. I felt free.

Thats why when BSBG met me it stuck. He found a lot to like, not just a sliver.

I think thats very important to a relationship. People get bored easily if its always the same thing day after day. Theres no discovery, no change. Repetition is boring. Change is stimulating. Depth is more interesting than shallowness. I think thats why we work well together.

AnywayI still have this cold but surprisingly it hasnt become bronchitis or anything else as far as I can tell. The drugs though are making me nuts. I took 12-hour Sudafed stuff for a couple of days but I was stupid and sleep deprived. Seriously I could barely function my brain was so disconnected. I would try to read but gave up because I lost touch with the story. So I just put my iPod on my head and looked at my coffee table books (ooohhh pictures!). I was that dumb. And the things are practically meth by themselves because I didnt sleep much for 3 days! Finally yesterday I broke the cycle and took the last of the NyQuil (we love you, you giant fucking Q!) and slept pretty well last night.

Plus Im soooo bored that I dont know what to do with myself. When Im doped up I can just zone out and watch tv but now that its out of my system, I have to do something. I went on a cleaning binge yesterday until I got hit with a wave of tiredness. Today Ill do some errands. I havent been outside the house for 4 days. I wonder if I still know how to drive. If I thought I was over this cold Id go run some film through my cameras. Im getting the itch again!

BSBG just emailed me and now hes feeling sick. Different symptoms though so who knows what he has. This sucks. I hate being sick. I hate it when hes sick. I repeat; this sucks. Thorn 02-06-2004, 11:14 AM Remember that Monty Python bit? it was almost as annoying as the I Like Traffic Lights song.

I just got a response to a resume I sent for a job. Even this much is uplifting. Its a company Ive heard of before and the job is very much up my alley. Best of all its not in the city, but in a town just next door. Very positive. The contact is supposed to get in touch again on the 10th since hes traveling until then. I hope Im over this stupid cold by then and my nose isnt a dry, cracked red mess!

It looks like a snow globe outside. I may go take the truck out just for the hell of it. I like driving in the snow. Ice sucks but snow can be fun.

Am reading a new author lately, well authors since its a writing team Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child. Not high-brow stuff. Nothing deep but it sure does grab you and suck you in. The one that started it all was The Cabinet of Curiosities and it has all the stuff to keep me interested; bones, old museum secrets, mysterious law-enforcement man, archaeology and murder. The one Im on now is Relic and it is similar except subtract the bones and archaeology and replace with vicious creature and anthropology. The mysterious lawman is in this one too. I had no idea he was a recurring character. I have its sequel, Reliquary, waiting in the wings. Since I have so much time on my hands now I got them both from the library. Also, I finished Cabinet in a day and a half.

The style kind of reminds me of James Herbert in the way the mundane and the supernatural are mixed. To label it supernatural in either case is misleading the monster in Relic is an evolutionary aberration and much of what Herbert writes about has occult overtones but the solutions are very much of this world. I used to read a lot of traditional horror but havent in about 10 years. Its kind of nice to go back into it but not all the way. The shallow end of the pool if you will.

Luckily Ive got me some good books to lose myself in so I wont obsess over this newest job opportunity. Yeah right. Thorn 02-06-2004, 01:08 PM I just got a call from another company I sent my resume to. It&apos;s in a slightly different industry, but basically the same job. Successful phone interview w/national dept head and now they are scheduling a meeting for me with the local office.

Psyche! This was just the boost to the psyche I needed. I was beginning to feel really loser-ish!

Woo hoo! Yay me!! Thorn 02-09-2004, 07:01 PM So today I got a call from the recruiting job woman, but not the woman I was expecting. It was the national manager again to tell me that the local HR woman wouldnt be able to call me today after all because shes still on vacation. I told her that I understood and that tomorrow shell probably be swamped. The manager woman agreed but then said shed send an email to her with some urgency and I should expect a call. Im not sure how much to read into this, but it seems positive to me.

My friend Red is doing much better. She got a really great job with another division of her company. She works out of her home in VA, but also has an office in Arlington. Her territory is Mid-Atlantic States up to NY including NJ. When I told her that my recruiting job prospect territory also included NJ, she said we should find a way to make our trips to NJ coincide so we can meet up. Shes so great shes helping me visualize this job. Shes very psyched about this job and we had a really good talk about working for huge companies (the recruiting firm is gigantic) and how in sales it can work for you.

We also talked about getting back into six-figure incomes again which is our goal. Neither one of us lived much beyond our income, meaning we saved for stuff and didnt get into debt, but theres a certain freedom that you get used to when you make good money and we want it back. It will be funny if were both building territories at the same time but in completely different industries. Back into sales. Its where I belong. Management sucks. Been there, done that, never again. The interesting thing is that the recruiting job comes with a territory already established and functioning. As a matter of fact, the national manager said that I would be perfect for this particular account. Maybe shes visualizing, too.

Like a total girl, part of my visualization of me in this job involved me buying a couple of new suits. When I was Christmas shopping I went into a store and absolutely fell in love with this gorgeous suit. It wont be there now, but Im sure Ill find something. I like wearing suits. When I put on a suit, I know I look good and I just feel together and confident and in control. I usually dont wear them to interviews (too clich), but I think with this one I will. I have one that I can make casual with the right top.

Oh shit there I go again.

Another friend of mine, Busted Knee, is actively looking for a new job. Weve been friends for 10 years. We worked together at one company for 8 years and then I followed him to the company that I just got let go from. Hes still there and getting more and more disillusioned with the place. Hes an MBA and very smart and easygoing. Thats why the sexual harassment thing at work was such a joke to me. No way. I told Red about (all 3 of us used to work together) and she was totally flabbergasted. So between that and something else nasty that someone just did to him, hes desperate to get out. His daughter just turned one. How time flies. I hope he finds a decent place.

The thing is, we were all spoiled by the place we worked so long. It was a small company and growing phenomenally. For the first few years I was there, we all knew each other and hung out in our personal lives and just had a great connection to each other. A mutual friend (the one whos going to nursing school) has said the same thing. Well never recapture what we had there, but we keep trying and keep getting disappointed. Shes right. We didnt know what we had back then. I will always look back with great happiness on my time with those people in that time and place. Thorn 02-11-2004, 09:04 AM My interview with the recruiting company went very well. Theyre impressed so far and have asked me back for a 3rd interview on Monday. This time Ill be meeting with the regional service delivery manager and if that goes well, an account manager. The HR woman and the national sales manager both feel that even without recruiting experience, I am a good fit for the job. This is true. I know how to sell; it is just a matter of learning what Im selling. No sweat.

I spent some time in verbal bondage with one of the recruiters who will be supporting whoever they choose for the account manager position. Christ on a cracker that guy wouldnt shut up. Id ask him specific questions about goals or corporate environment or growth areas and hed go off on a tangent about people and things that happened years ago. Crazy. I was squirming wondering how to bring it to a close. Finally I just had to stand up and put out my hand and thank him for his time and his valuable insight.

An interesting thing is that all the executive management is made up of woman. All of it. Theyre small now that the dot-com bubble has burst, but its still odd. Should be interesting. Theyre also moving to a much smaller area of a building that they used to occupy the whole of. Boy do I know that story. But they made money last year (the corporate parent is a public company, so I looked them up) and thats a good thing. She showed me my office and I was happy until she said I had to share it. Share it??? Oh my. That will be new and different.

We talked salary a bit and the base salary is probably within reason for me to eke out an existence on while building the territory. The whole thing hinges on whether or not I inherit the existing account base or not. If I dont inherit anything, theyll need to pay me a larger base salary until the territory starts producing. If they want me to start from scratch, theyre going to have to support me while I do it. If I do handle an existing base, Id be willing to take a reduced salary in exchange for a producing customer base. If they want me to just keep existing business relationships alive and productive and slowly build, then they dont have to support me as much. The HR lady thought this was reasonable.

One selfish concern is for my morning workouts. The office is far from any of the Golds gyms I can work out at with my current membership. This means precious time will be wasted in driving to and from the house, the gym, and the office. It was great with my last job the gym was literally 5 minutes from the office. My membership doesnt expire until May so if I get this job Ill have to figure something out fast. I asked cautiously about working hours and flexibility and there seems to be some play there so maybe I can make a later start time part of my deal. I wouldnt mind staying until 6 if I could start at 9.

The person who emailed me from the other company didnt get in contact with me yesterday as promised. If I dont hear something this morning, Ill send another email to the guy. Maybe something unavoidable happened, otherwise, its a bad sign. So different from the staffing company. Thorn 02-12-2004, 08:39 AM Just found out that David Bowie is coming to a venue near me in the spring. Oh what a birthday present to me! The problem is, I dont think I know anyone who will go with me. I might have to go alone, just like I did for Stevie Ray. Oh well. Maybe things will change closer to the time tickets go on sale. Just when that is exactly I dont know. I have to try to remember to keep looking for when they go on sale. Its nuts.

I have another job interview on Friday. Its with a different company for a sales position very much in line with my background and expertise. I am positive I can do this job, but am a bit weary of the same old technology game. But hell, a job is a job especially one I could do standing on my head.

So today I am very sore all over from doing heavy lifting this week. My legs and butt are killing me, my chest is sore and soon my lats will be sore from doing back yesterday and I was thinking about skipping the gym today. But I talked myself out of it and put on my gym clothes. Then I fired up the computer and read Deb_u_taunts journal entry and that just made my morning. Shes going to the gym and is working hard so I should, too. Cant be a quitter just because Im sore, I freaking made myself sore! So Im eating a Detour bar (the worlds best protein bar) and will get my ass in gear shortly.

On the whole, I m pretty happy with my body lately. It performed a miracle and kept my stupid cold from becoming bronchitis as usual or worse, pneumonia like last time. That was a first and Im truly grateful. Whatever youre doing body keep it up. I am trying to balance my ambition for physical change with acceptance of certain physical absolutes. In the past, I let it get the better of me and quit working out for a couple of years. Now I am paying the price with my uphill battle to reverse what those 2 fallow years did to me. I doubt I will ever have the relatively small ass I had back then, but I am reasonably ok with the ass I have now. Reasonably. I dont think any woman is actually accepting of her ass.

So I went out with my mom yesterday for some lunch and a bit of shopping. Oh I hate being poor!!! I had to tear myself a way. But I did find some really cool martini glasses for BSBG. Theyre short with a thick base. We have a similar one (used to have two but, smasho!) and he likes it because when he puts it in the freezer, the thick glass base stays cold longer and his drink stays cold longer. But he only has one glass. Now he has 4 more and the best part was they were 50% off and I got them for $7.50! Yay. Plus I exchanged some wine glasses we got as a gift that were too big for my dishwasher. I have enough glasses I have to wash by hand, thank you very much, so I got some different ones that will fit. I dont care that theyre cheap. I dont cry when I drop them on the tile floor.

Ok, now Im rambling on about stupid things. Gotta go. The gym awaits! Thanks, Deb! Thorn 02-15-2004, 10:07 AM I just read one of the most disturbing books Ive ever come across. Its called We Need to Talk About Kevin by Lionel Shriver. The mother of a mass murderer writes to her estranged husband in an effort to understand why their 15-year-old son went off the rails. Even if I were disposed to actually like children, this book would put me off them. It paints a truly evil portrait of this boy. Through the mothers memories we see that Kevin was never a normal child. He rejected her the very instant he was born and he rejected everything else in short order. The father tried to create a perfect 50s family and was completely blind to his sons behavior and effect on people (he had no friends and they had trouble getting babysitters back for a second time and parents would go out of their way to keep their children from him). In the end, I understand why Kevin felt the need to do what he did, but I dont claim to sympathize or condone. His pride in his actions is chilling.

It reminded me of an interview I saw with Jeffery Dahmers father. Little Jeffery had a very normal and affluent upbringing. No abuse or family turmoil. He wasnt neglected or emotionally estranged from his family. He just went crazy. His father wept and blamed himself even though he could point to no evidence of fault. Still, it ate at him and was heartbreaking to watch. Jeffery was a force of nature, not a product of environment. I know that Jeffery wasnt crazy according to the legal definition that says that to be insane you must not know that your actions were wrong. Jeffery knew, otherwise he wouldnt have gone to such lengths to conceal his crimes, but I think his urges to do what he did and his ability to carry them out are hallmarks of mental disease in themselves.

In the novel, Kevins concealment of his true nature (except around his mother who was onto him from birth) is nearly complete. His efforts to appear normal are very calculated and take an enormous amount of effort for him to perpetuate. Each of his lesser crimes are shrouded in a veil to make sure that Kevin comes out the hero or at the very least, an innocent bystander. He devised his final crime in such a way that he would not bear all of the blame. He is not a psychopath he is a classic sociopath.

I wont get into the whole of the plot, but if you like books that challenge the conventional wisdom that it is always purely the fault of a parent when a child goes awry, read it. I read that the authors own agent refused to handle the book and a few publishers rejected it before being accepted. Odd for a writer who has successfully sold books in the past (I have her first in my own library).

On a more positive note; David Bowies Reality CD is outstanding. I didnt care for Heathen as much as I thought I would and was reluctant to buy Reality, but then I played excerpts of each track and changed my mind. Pablo Picasso is probably my favorite track. Pablo Picasso was never called an asshole! Looking for Water is very reminiscent of his older work, but with a modern edge. I only went mental in Newbury Comics, buying only 4 CDs instead of my usual 8-10. Control. Sort of.

My interview on Friday was strange. I knew the guy slightly from my time with another company several years ago. His name had been bugging me because it was familiar and as we started talking about my experience we found that both knew many of the same people. He also used to have an R1100RS just like the one I used to have. So we bonded pretty well, but the interview was still strange. He didnt seem to have many of the answers I wanted like about pay plans and the territory arrangement seems arbitrary. Oh well, he wants me to come back and talk to the president of the company. The guys name is Vince and all I can think of is Rex the Runt and I had to bite my lip. It could be a good opportunity though and the office is about 5 minutes beyond BSBGs, so the commute will be a piece of cake.

But Im getting ahead of myself.

We didnt do anything unusual for Valentines Day. Were fickle. Some years, when we have money we get spendy, when we dont we just have cards and token pressies. A couple of years he totally surprised me once with a gorgeous ruby ring that I had admired and once with a new Hamilton that I had expressed desire for. He remembered both. So in honor of prior Valentines Days I wore them both yesterday. He liked the squatty little martini glasses I gave him and the miniature Detour bars he gave me are great. Then he made us a yummy steak dinner and we had a passable cabernet and watched at totally lame movie that I thought was going to be better. Luckily we both could make great jokes at its horrible music (Zamphir, master of the pan flute!), characters and lack of plot. We were way more entertaining than the stupid film. Then we went to bed and wellyou know! :love: Thorn 02-18-2004, 03:33 PM My mom totally cracks me up. Heres a recent conversation almost verbatim;

Mom I really like some of David Bowies songs.

Me Yeah? Which ones?

Mom Well, I like Roxanne. Thats a good song.

Me Mom, thats The Police not David Bowie.

She is so weird. Shes always doing stuff like this.


On more exciting news the staffing company I interviewed with 3 times has asked for references. So I sent out a bunch of emails today asking if people will agree that Im swell. Some of them have done it before and vise versa, so I dont think it will be too hard to get them to do it again. I always found the concept of references to be weird. Do employers really expect unbiased opinions from these people?? Am I going to find my worst enemy and ask them to talk about me?? But what the hell, this is the way its done.

The CEO a former employer, who is now the COO of another company, has agreed to give me a great reference. Our paths crossed again in my last job and it was great. Hes my work dad. Actually, many of my references are from co-workers from this same old company. We had such a great time together.

There is only one snag I can foresee at this moment. As part of my final interview with this company, I sat with an account manager and picked his brain. This is the person Ill have to share an office with. Im frightened. Two words;

Country






Western

Oh my god. I truly cannot cope. I hope that he is polite enough to ask if it bothers me and considerate enough to resort to headphones when I tell him that c/w sucks. Ive been in this exact situation before. I had to share a cube with someone and thats all she listened to. So she suggested that on alternate days, we switch off. After 2 days of Metallica, Black Sabbath and SoundGarden, she gave up and we agreed to silence. If he suggests that, I believe the same ploy will work I will fill his ears with Rob Zombie, Ministry and Monster Magnet until he relents and ceases to torture me with Hank Williams or Ted Williams or freaking Quick Draw McGraw or whoever! Its good to set the rules right from the outset. I am evil.

So I will work on getting my references together and try not to obsess. Damn. It seems like Ive been at this forever. I need to put some thought into my start time in the morning though and how best to negotiate a 9am start time. Well see. Maybe I shouldnt push my luck, but hell, if you dont ask you dont get. Need to look into gyms in the area, too. Damnam I putting the cart before the horse?

Oh and I forgot to mention something that the guy I interviewed with for the other job told me. We know a lot of the same people and he told me about someone I used to be fairly close to until she went a bit crazy. I worked with her for a while and really tried to be her friend. I think she was mentally and emotionally unstable and this led to some destructive behavior and eventually we didnt hang out or go to lunch together anymore. She had the short end of a divorce stick and 3 kids, one of which had cystic fibrosis. When I knew her she was dating this really sleazy type guy and it was always off again, on again. Always problems. No money. No job. Excessive drinking. He reminded me of the Leech. BSBG&amp;I had them over for dinner and a movie once and it was tedious in the extreme. She had talent but was disturbed so she couldnt apply it well. She also couldnt hold her liquor never a good thing at company functions.

Anyway, she left our employer under less than perfect circumstances and I heard about her for the next few years since its such a small world in this industry. I even ran into her and her boyfriend in the store once and my mom thought he looked like a homeless person. Well, he has a home now. Hes in jail for shaking their baby to death. I was shocked. I dont recall hearing it on the news or anything, and weve unfortunately had quite a few local cases of child murder by boyfriend or spouse. I would have definitely realized who it was if I had heard of it on the news or whatever. Very weird. And tragic.

I just found a business plan that I started in anticipation of getting the job I was going for back in October. How psyched I was for that one too and how it came to nothing. Oh well. I was talking to my friend Busted Knee the other day and he was getting bummed that his job search hasnt had any hits yet. I think his problem is that he cant visualize (theres that word again) himself in any job when he interviews for it. I always do. I picture my daily commute. How Ill decorate my office. What kind of clothes Ill wear. My approach to customers. How Ill close. Doing that business plan was part of visualizing. It helps me but I dont put all of my identity and hopes and dreams into every job prospect. Theres a difference. I think Busted Knee is worried that if he gets excited or enthusiastic about a job and fails to get it, hell be depressed. I told him that he shouldnt think that way. He needs to be selective enough so that each job opportunity lost is a blow, but not so wrapped up in it that he cant go on with his life. He has a hard time doing that.

Part of my visualization included scoping out a gym that is closer to the office. And I found one! It looks nice on the web and its just around the corner from where I may be working. Sweet. It will be much easier than using the gym I go to now. Its too bad that I have 4 months left on my current membership though. The new gym is probably more expensive it looks it.

Me, obsess??? Thorn 02-20-2004, 09:04 AM So I heard from yet another prospective employer. I have an interview on Monday. Interview style can be very telling. With the staffing company, I talked almost non-stop with each of the 3 women I spoke with. They really wanted to know about me. They wanted to hear me speak and formulate answers and describe my work experience. Luckily I interview well and have no problem talking about myself. This latest prospect did all the talking. She described the job, the pay plan, the team structure, the training all of it. But she only asked me one question about me. Not exactly encouraging. They dont want me, they want a body to fill a chair and make calls. Thats not what I want. I want an employer to understand my strengths, weaknesses and goals. To paraphrase Cheap Trick, I want them to want me, not just a warm body who can dial a phone.

So why am I going to the interview? Why not? The base salary sounds like it may be higher than what the current favorite prospect is going to offer, so its a bargaining point. And I can sharpen my interviewing skill and evaluate a company as a prospective future employer even if it isnt for this exact job. The company has been around for a while and is growing rapidly. As a matter of fact, I applied to them for a job a while back. My screwing it up was painful. I was asleep in the hammock out in the yard in the sun and the phone woke me up. Instead of putting them off or letting the machine get it, I actually agreed to a phone interview right then and there. I was a complete moron. I know the person must have wondered how I lived to adulthood. They never called back. I laugh about it now, but at the time I was mortified. But I learned a lesson never agree to a phone interview when still asleep.

Hopefully I hear from the staffing company today with an offer. I hope they dont make me suffer through the weekend not knowing. My Work Dad just emailed me and said hes playing phone tag with my interviewer. So hopefully they can connect sometime today. I havent heard a word from the other guy I interviewed with so my lack of impression with them is growing. What a Mickey Mouse outfit. BSBG and I are going to dinner with some folks he works with and it would be nice to have some positive things to say when asked the inevitable question what do you do?. Right now Im unemployed is not the answer I really want to give. Oh please dont let me hang all weekend.

On a completely different note I got David Bowie tickets!!! Woo hoo!! Im so psyched. I know he wont do many (or any) of my old favorites, but just to get to see and hear his voice. Maybe hell play sax, too. Hes a brilliant alto saxophonist. Not many people know that about him. They see him as a singer only but hes a multi-talented artist he plays guitar, sax and piano. Check out Black Tie White Noise if you want to hear smooth, sexy sax. Its really a great album celebrating his relationship with his wife, Iman. It makes me wonder about the songs he saves for just the two of them. It must be amazing to be married to someone who can sing you love songs.

Scribble is sitting on the table next to me looking out the window at the birds. I think she takes their fluttery flightiness as a personal insult because she makes weird noises at them. Short little meows that seem oddly doglike in their sharp, barking quality. Shes weird. And very needy in the morning. She practically gets on my head and demands attention. The rest of the day she pretty much sleeps but in the am she has to be paid attention to. The Orange Menace is outside bothering the wildlife no doubt.

Had a double mega workout yesterday to make up for my laziness on Wednesday. I ran 3 miles then did back and shoulders then ran another 2 miles, and then did 200 crunches. I felt like I was going to drop when I was done, but I managed to get home in one piece. Today I will run and do arms and probably run a second time and then another 200 crunches. This will be to counteract the food I will eat tonight that I know will be bad for me. But we havent been out to dinner in months so what the hell. Its not like we eat bad food every day. I am frustrated a bit though with the pain in my right wrist and elbow. The pain in my wrist is more severe but is starting to get to the point where it interferes with my lifting. Im not sure what (if anything) can be done.

Lately Ive been watching Magnum P.I. and Keen Eddie. I have come to realize that I am attracted to big men with dimples. What a weirdo I am. Thorn 03-01-2004, 05:53 PM I am unbelievably relieved and happy. Its unreal. An actual job from a Monster.com posting. I will start the 15th if the negotiations go well. The starting salary is just a tiny bit lower than my previous salary, which is ok since Ill be earning commission as well. Plus they are going to pay me a subsidy for the first 6 months so that I can earn some extra money and get ramped up. They must be nervous that I will keep looking for a job that pays more or has generates commission sooner. Interesting. My last employer did something similar - they guaranteed my bonuses for the first quarter.

Of course the first thing I have to do is touch up my wardrobe a bit. I need a couple of new suits and other stuff. Not a ton but something to round out my wardrobe a bit more. Ill be in front of clients more than I was before and so Yeah right, who am I kidding. Im going SHOPPING!

Wednesday I was planning to go check out the nearby gym and Ill pick up my offer letter at the same time.

My self-esteem has just shot up 10 points. I was starting to feel like a real loser with the delay. I know from previous experience that it can take forever to get things finalized but that doesnt really help to allay negative emotions. But now I feel so light, I can practically fly! Thorn 03-03-2004, 09:17 AM Thanks for the congratulations everyone. It&apos;s nice to hear. Or is it read?

So that other company I interviewed with that has the office right near my husbands they emailed me yesterday wanting to set up the 2nd interview. Oy vey.

If given a choice, Id rather have the job that I already have an offer for. Even though the commute will be longer and the learning curve steeper. What to do, what to do? So I sent an email back to the 2nd company requesting an interview this week in light of my offer package arriving today. Well see what happens.

I was such a girl yesterday all shoppy shopping. It was fun though. I didnt get a suit, but it wasnt for lack of trying. Just didnt have what I wanted in my size and the ones that were in my size, I didnt really like. I was looking for a modern, short jacketed navy suit in a material appropriate for spring, summer and fall. No such luck this time. So I consoled myself with some other great stuff I got like 12 things and even some shoes! All very classy and timeless and of a less casual style than what Ive been wearing to work for the last couple of years. Very weird behavior for me. Plus Ive found a couple of things in the latest Lands End catalog that I will order soon.

Ok, enough of that. Today Im getting my offer package and checking out the new gym. I hope its nice and not too expensive (like a shrubbery). Thorn 03-04-2004, 02:46 PM The gym is enormous and expensive. Sigh. Golds gym is soooo cheap. But this is an independent gym and not part of a chain so the price is higher. At least thats what I assume. Theyre probably ripping me off.

Cool things about this gym:
Towel service
Locker rental (and they actually had some open for rental a miracle)
Whirlpool
Sauna
Two locker rooms
Huge cardio area
Its clean
Its brightly lit
Its furnished in a coordinated, modern way
Huge pool w/lap lanes
Close to the office

Not-so-cool things about this gym:
Weight room seems small compared to other areas
Weight room equipment seems older than other types of equipment
No evening yoga

Im going there Monday for a fitness evaluation/body comp. I know my body fat percentage will be higher than I want. Ive been struggling with that a bit lately. Im getting older and it takes more and more to burn it off and its frustrating because my eating habits are so ingrained. Maybe the trainer can suggest something to help.

Ok, enough about that. In reading over my job offer package, I didnt see anything about vacation, sick or personal time. Weird. Ill have to send an email and see what the deal is. BSBG negotiated a 3rd week of vacation when he got his current job, lucky bastard. I probably wont get that lucky. I wasnt the last time.

I emailed the other company and told them that I wouldnt be available to fill the job opening they have. I havent received a response yet even though my missive was unfailingly polite and professional. Im such a weirdo.

Oh Ms. Taunt you are too much! I am so not together. In my head its like Im still 20 years old and still trying to figure out how to be an adult. Sometimes I just say stuff that in like 10 seconds, I regret. And if you saw me at the gym, you would be frightened. Ive been told that I have this really grim (I prefer to think of it as focused) look on my face and because of the iPod I cant hear anyone and its like Im in a trance! I think its funny of course because Im so perverse. Its a wonder BSBG and I ever met. But I think back then the music was better and I didnt have to block it out by means of a personal stereo.

This brings me to my dilemma. Well, not exactly dilemma challenge is maybe a better word. I need to soften my image and be more accessible. I am so intense and so direct and so tall and gargantuan that I know I intimidate people when I dont mean to. Theres a time and place for intimidation, but I find that my normal demeanor can be like this for some people. When I was younger, it didnt bother me but now I can see how its cost me over the years.

In addition to being all those things, Im also quiet. I dont make idle chit chat very easily and people mistake this for snobbishness which it isnt, I just dont have to talk constantly. I remember once someone told me that I needed to change my approach to things; that my directness was coming off as harshness. So I worked on that and made some improvement. Now I need to change my overall demeanor to be softer and more approachable. One thing I did was cut my hair and Ive stopped wearing it pulled back. But I know thats not enough. I need to smile more and learn to make light conversation about nothing. I need to swear less. Thats going to be a hard one I have a terrible mouth on me.

I dont know quite how I got like this so one sided. Ten years ago, I was much more easy-going. Somehow I got it in my head that the only way to be taken seriously was to be tough all the time. I need to balance my toughness with my humor and my sensitivity. I do have a soft side; it just doesnt come out much. I think that Ill be perceived as weak or stupid if I soften up. This is not true because I am not weak or stupid, so how could I be perceived as such? But thats my fear and I need to overcome it.

It goes back to really being me, the way I was when I met BSBG. I felt free and happy and at ease back then. Recently, whenever I went to work, it felt like I was putting on a persona. Like a heavy overcoat, it shielded me from harm. Little did I know that it was also a barrier between me and the people around me. Somehow I got it in my head that I wouldnt be liked/trusted/respected and so hid myself away and rejected them first. Not exactly the way to make things easier in the world.

This is my project. And believe me, it is a big one. With this new job and a small office, I think it can be done. I just have to keep it simple. Smile more, swear less. If I break it down into smaller changes, it wont seem so impossible a transformation. What am I afraid of?? Thorn 03-07-2004, 10:14 AM This coming week is my last week of freedom. In a way, I like the not working thing. Except for the occasional bouts of extreme boredom. And of course the no money part. That sucks. But the sleeping in and going to the gym for 2 hours and hanging around with my weird cats all day thats pretty good. How great this would be with money. Oh but isnt that every Americans dream? To have all the money they need and not have to work for it? Yeah.

Whenever the local MegaBucks or PowerBall gets huge, BSBG goes into a ticket pool with people at work. I indulge a bit of millionaire dreaming at those times. It always comes out the same.

First charter a yacht in the Aegean for as long as it takes for me to see everything.
Second pay off all bills belonging to me and my parents and my bro and his wife and my best friend Olga. Possibly help one or two other family members but thats it.
Third put financial plan into being. Investing and tax sheltering. The works.
Fourth buy real estate. I want a home in the Pacific Northwest and one in New England. Also one someplace warm like an island in the South Pacific or Costa Rica.
Fifth become involved in animal rescue by either starting my own refuge or working with and endowing an established rescue operation.
Sixth buy a Ferrari 355 Berlinetta and a BMW M6.

Of course there would be other ongoing things like travel and motor sports, but those are the basic things I would do first. One can dream.

In a very limited way, I do most of those things now. I travel when I can. Not anywhere far nor in any dramatically luxurious style, but I get out once in a while. I also invest and have done for many years. The retirement account I opened in November with my defunct 401K money has made about $6000 so far. Not too shabby. I have a house. Granted its not a showplace or terribly private, but its ours. I have taken in one stray cat and rescued one iguana so far. I have volunteered at a local ASPCA as well. And I have a 6-year-old M3 that I love dearly and I have an even older Ducati (the only decent Italian vehicle I can afford) and of course, the FLC. So on a smaller scale, Im living out my dreams.

So why have I been so blah lately? I think its from the boredom and also the chase is over. I got the job. I think that pretty much solidifies the fact that Im a born sales person. I need the hunt. I need the chase. The reward is cool too, but kind of flat in a way. Crazy. Even BSBG has noticed my blahness. Im just out of it lately. I have a couple of things to do this week but other than Mon&amp;Tue, my slate is blank. If its nice I will probably get the FLC out, pack up some photo gear and hit the road. With money coming on the horizon, the prospect of using up gas doesnt worry me so much. And I can afford the film processing. That helps. Thorn 03-09-2004, 04:37 PM Despite the crappy weather, my week is starting out pretty well. The body composition analysis turned up exactly the results I expected my body fat % is about 4% higher than Id like it to be. It needs to be in the low 20s. So BSBG and I have come up with a reasonable meal plan for me that cuts my overall calories and sugar intake. And most of the food on it is portable so it shouldnt be an issue to maintain it when Im working.

Its kind of cool having a new routine and a new goal. Another change Ive made is in my weight training. When I first started (10 years ago) I lifted for more reps but somehow in the intervening years, lifting for more weight somehow became my focus. As a result, my physique is more pumped up than streamlined. Changing to a rep-based lift pattern will change this somewhat.

So I went to lunch w/a former coworker today and things havent changed a bit since I left. Not that I expected anything to change. She said that my boss and the other guy from my old dept have struggled ever since to try to do my job. She said they were clueless. I laughed. My boss didnt care to find out what I did, she was too busy getting the big picture (for all the good that did her). Oh well. There is another round of lay-offs coming later this month. I hope my brother will not be part of that.

And heres a piece of good fortune only a woman will appreciate. On my clothes-buying spree last week, I got a great glen plaid skirt with just a tiny bit of red in it. I tried on a red silk blouse but there werent any in my size. Damn. So I bought a pale green blouse to go with other stuff but its somewhat transparent. So I needed a body-hugging camisole and a red silk blouse. On a whim I swing by Macys on my way home today and found a solitary red silk blouse on the clearance rack and its the right size. I almost passed out. This after I found a perfect camisole upstairs. I couldnt believe my luck. It was the very last blouse they had and it was 50% off. Woo hoo! After weeks of dressing way down for my temporary job and lounging around the house, Im kind of psyched to dress nicely again. Plus new stuff does that to you. I feel all girly.

So to wrap up; I have a new demeanor softening plan, a new eating plan and a new lifting routine. This is pretty cool. Things havent been this new in 10 years. It feels great and I really cant wait for results. Thorn 03-17-2004, 07:15 PM So Ive made it through 3 days of my new job. Its been interesting and boring. Interesting because everything is new and different. Boring because the person who is orienting/training me kept getting pulled into other things and wed get interrupted for up to an hour at a time. When youre so new that you have nothing to do and the office is too small to snoop around in, its dull. Plus some important stuff on my computer didnt work right yet.

So tomorrow it will be my first day without my trainer in the office. I will be spending time with the other account manager in the office and with the recruiters. Now that my database access has been provided, Ill be messing around with the program to see what it can do for me. The problem is, theres no documentation or tutorial on how to use it. I was just shown the basics and now Im just going to mess around with it. Its a little off-putting. Ive never had such haphazard training/orientation before. I dont even have network drives mapped or personal folders in Outlook. Its weird.

But the people seem to be great and they have a lot of fun. They think Im crazy though. I didnt have any pizza today (company paid for) because Im on my weight-loss program. So they all scarfed sausage pizza and I had salad and a turkey sandwich. And I had to say no to going out drinking tonight. I almost said yes, but if I cheat tonight it will be that much easier to cheat again. I havent cheated at all so far and I havent missed one workout. Even today when it was a snowy mess this morning.

My office is pretty cool except for the ambient music, which is giving me ear cancer. I have asked him to turn it down and he did, but I can still hear it and have to block it out with my iPod. I think Ill put a plant or two on my windowsill it gets a ton of light as its a north facing window.

Its strange to feel out of my depth a bit though. I havent felt this way since 10 years ago when I first entered into the high-tech industry. Back then, I had no idea what the hell I was doing. Now, Im in a similar position in so far as I dont understand the ins and outs of the technical recruiting. I understand the concepts and what it is, but the process and the terminology are all new. I also dont understand the competition and how to sell our services over that of the competitors. And positioning these services to companies who may not use agencies. And moreBut Ill get there. Im going to continue to work with my trainer and some other people on getting that information. I just havent felt this at sea in a long time. But this too shall pass.

In a way, its good to keep challenging myself and learning new things. I was beginning to stagnate in my other jobs. In this new role, I think I can learn a lot and develop skills that have been latent.

And yes, Ive been smiling more and swearing less! I havent sworn once since I started there (not in the office anyway). And Ive been making an effort at small talk! Im determined to make it work. Thorn 03-18-2004, 06:31 PM So today I found out that even if I put forth 1/10th of the effort I plan to put into this job, they will probably be overwhelmed with my productivity and drive. Im pretty sure the person who had this job did a lot of nothing.

I was messing with the database/program today to compile a list of clients and managers that were contacted in the last 6 months. My thought is that these are still warm and will need to be called first to keep them from getting cold. Contacts older than that are already cold and wont get any colder by waiting a little longer for me to get in touch. I had to ask Hockey Man (my office mate plays hockey every morning I told him about your give blood quote Jpuck and he laughed) if I was using the program correctly because under manager contacts I found only 31 that had been updated in the last 6 months. This means that if she was updating correctly she only called 31 people in 6 months. Sorting by client wasnt much better 69 updates since October 1.

What the hell was this woman doing??? I checked the number of starts she had in the last year and it was a tiny number so she wasnt caught up in managing contractors or job orders or candidates or things like that. WTF?! Talk about failing Sales 101. The funnel is freaking empty! There is nothing even remotely time consuming here.

So now I know that I can be a slacker and probably still succeed at this job.

Not that I plan on being a slacker. Its just funny. Thorn 03-21-2004, 07:12 PM when you&apos;re unemployed - they don&apos;t quite mean so much. Except you get to hang out with your workin&apos; friends.

Ok, so that doesn&apos;t apply, but I LOVE PRIMUS so I put it in.

2 weeks on my low calorie diet and I think its working. I have 2 pairs of Levis that I love. They are admittedly my fat jeans and are a size 12. Even though they are both the same size, one is a shade smaller than the other and hasnt been a comfortable fit for me. Sure I can squeeze into them, but theyre tight. Right now Im wearing them in relative comfort. J Ive been keeping track of what I eat daily and have been hovering right around the 2000-calorie mark. Some days are slightly higher, some lower. Ive cheated twice in the 2 weeks, but nothing too crazy. Saturday and Sunday are my cheat days. I dont go nuts on food but I do drink alcohol both days. Now there are empty calories for you.

So on Friday I get all the way to the gym (20 minutes away) and realize I forgot my pants. Great. If I dont go back home for them, Ill have to wear sweaty gym clothes all day. Not exactly a career booster. So I do a workout and zip home for a shower and my real clothes. Amazingly I made it to the office at 8:30, which is my normal start time. Phew. Nothing like being late during your first week!

Car trouble seems to follow me to new jobs sometimes. When I got my first real job, I was late the first day because my car died on the side of the road. I was pissed and wearing heels and had to walk about a mile to a phone (it was 1993 so no cell phone). Plus this woman came out of her house and yelled at me that I couldnt leave my car there. As if I had any choice in the matter what planet was she from?? So I finally get to a phone and called my mom. When in crisis, always call mom. She picked me up and got me there. Everyone had thought that I wasnt coming in, that my weird supervisor had scared me off already. It was pretty funny but I was mortified. Later I was able to borrow my friends truck because he was DWI and couldnt drive. The only thing I had to do was run his errands or drive him places. No hardship cause we were buds. When I got a new car (the dead one was really too unreliable a 1979 Honda CVCC painted bright green and named Snotball because it also had a leaky sunroof) I locked myself out of it one day at work and one of my new coworkers let me borrow her car to go get my spare keys. In the mean time, everyone had a go at trying to unlock it with coat hangers. Alas, none of them were experienced car thieves and so my trip wasnt wasted. Later I sold Snotball for $300 to a guy whose wife let him have $500 for a new car (generous huh?). He needed the other $200 for a new gas tank, which is all it really needed besides the sunroof.

This job has had one car incident so far. My first day I left my lights on and came out to a dead battery. Luckily, my office mate Hockey Man had jumper cables and I was able to get going. What an impression huh?

So on to week two. I already have 3 meetings on Monday. Theres something I dont miss. Luckily this is not normal, its more orientation stuff.

Busted Knee has been on an interview for a new job. After being thrown under the bus by someone who he thought was a friend and had been protecting, hes had it at my former employer. Hes interviewing for a competitor which reminds me! I have to see if I still have my non-compete from that place. Thorn 03-24-2004, 09:43 PM My new business cards arrived today. I took one and put it with the others. The others are business cards from the past. Most of them are from the company I spent 8 years with. I can look at them and think back on moves and promotions and job changes. There are only two from different companies. Just my weird little habit but it reminds me of where Ive been and where Im going. The only thing constant is me.

Tomorrow Ive decided to make my first client contacts. Actually theres been one already but its not 100% positive I had to put out a little fire and get a contractor back on track. Hopefully the client likes our response and resolution and will continue to work with us. I think she will. But tomorrow Im going to proactively get in touch with some clients the previous rep was working with and see how it goes. Hockey Man will get a laugh its always a little rough the first couple of days.

But eventually Ill get better and I wont even think twice about it. Thats the way it was in my old industry and Im sure this one will be the same. Im talking to many of the same types of people, just about slightly different things.

Something funny another job prospect called me yesterday and sent me an email. I sent my resume to them at the end of Feb. Im going to have to call the guy tomorrow. When it rains, it pours! The position was less of a stretch for me and definitely one with less responsibility and earning potential, but I put in for it with the hopes that the entry-level job would lead to something better.

Another good thing I get paid this week. I wasnt expecting a paycheck until the beginning of April so this is great. Not a moment too soon either I just got my credit card bill from the shopping spree. Yikes! And I just bought myself a new briefcase because the zipper gave out on my old one. I was bummed. Ive had it forever its a Ciao bag from the 80s and was perfect for me. If I could find someone to replace the zipper Id still use it. I think I still have it somewhere.

BSBG had to go to NYC today on an emergency fact-finding trip. Hes so lucky that he works for a company with private planes. He hardly ever has to fly commercial. Im jealous. Its great for me too hes gone less. Usually they can fly somewhere east of the Mississippi and back the same day so hes not gone overnight as much as he would be if he had to fly commercial.

I am absolutely dying for spring. We had a teaser week a while ago, but its been cold lately and has snowed a couple of times. I want flowers and warm breezes and my car. I want birds singing and bumble bees. I want to open the windows in the house. I want to ride my bikes. I want to go for the first hike of the year (my new Asolos are all broken in). I want to drive around with the sunroof open.

Hurry Spring! Thorn 03-25-2004, 08:44 PM At the gym there is this guy who seems to be watching me. I catch him looking at me quite frequently. And not just an embarrassed glance and then eyes away. Its hard to describe. For example, I was doing cable crossovers last week and he was watching me like hed never seen anyone do those before. And then last Friday I was doing reverse grip pull downs (for triceps) and admittedly, if you just had a picture of my arm itself, youd think it was a mans, but the rest of me was fully visible and Im not a steroid freak or anything. I had big arms before I started lifting weights now theyre almost all muscle and pretty well defined (esp when I do reverse grip pull downs) but not much bigger than they have always been. Im naturally muscular. But this guy obviously thinks Im a freak because he keeps looking at me. I have the urge to totally go pose-down on him whenever I catch him. At least its a laugh. One other guy did it one day (during my arm workout) but I havent noticed him since.

And of course there is a group of guys who talk talk talk all the time like a bunch of women. Shut up and lift! Every once in a while I catch one of them looking too, but not as constantly or as obviously as the other guy. Now that Ive spent a couple of weeks in the place, its obvious that Im the most hard-core woman there during my time. Im tall, muscular, strong and I know my way around a gym. At Golds this kind of woman is much more common. In none of the Golds Ive belonged to was I the most hard-core woman lifter during my workout time. Its one of the differences Ive noticed between Golds and this athletic club. Even among the guys, I could only spot one hard-core lifter and one wannabee. Who knows, maybe all the hard-core people go after work. But I doubt it. Before work is a very popular time for the serious bodybuilder.

Oh well. Ill be the resident freak. Thorn 03-28-2004, 03:59 PM I think the diet is working. Although I havent weighed myself recently, Im smaller. Definitely smaller. Of course it could be because Ive been doing abs extra hard lately, but I hope that s not all it is. Ill weigh myself at the end of the week and see.

I took a couple of my toys out to play this weekend. I went for a spin on the R1150RS and in the M3. Woo hoo! I cant even tell you how much I miss my car in winter. Its like withdrawal come springtime when the novelty of the truck has completely worn away and is becoming contempt. BSBG said we could get rid of the truck. I said no, because I really and truly do appreciate the truck and how it saves my car but he gets to drive the WRX all winter and only sacrifices a little performance with studded snow tires. He would feel the same way come April if he had to drive a 115-hp truck all winter!

But now its spring. Well, sort of. We could still get hit with a huge snowstorm. Back in 1997 (I think) we got about a foot of snow on April 1st. Classic. But Im hoping we give that a miss this year and move straight to spring. My daffodils are coming up and so are the crocuses. The finches are back and so are the red-winged blackbirds. Soon the juncos will be gone and the orioles and the waxwings will blow in and out again.

Yesterday BSBG and I went to his sisters for dinner. His parents are up from Florida so they were there too. I swear my SIL needs to be medicated. The actual meal was so rushed that Im not kidding when I say that she took my plate out from in front of me 15 minutes after we got there. My MIL was actually still eating her garlic bread when her daughter asked her if she wanted some pound cake w/strawberries. My BIL kept telling her to chill but she wouldnt. She brought dessert and slapped it down so fast that I could still taste my dinner when I was offered dessert. I declined saying I wanted to digest a bit (spaghetti w/authentic homemade Italian sauce). 15 minutes later, she wrapped up the cake and was going for the berries when BSBG said that I would probably like to finish those off. Unreal! She is totally nuts.

I had my bro and his wife over for dinner just a few weeks ago and the whole thing was completely different. I like relaxed meals with company. Time to talk and savor the meal and the wine. Everybody paces themselves and has enough time to digest and relax. Not SIL she herds you through and kicks you out. Bizarre.

Tonight BSBG is making a roaster chicken and were going to have a leisurely dinner. We were so stressed out when we got home last night that he made us drinks and we watched Cops (self-esteem hour). Mmmm Black Russians! We need some decent vodka though. All we could find was some Grey Goose someone gave us years ago. Need some Stoli or some Ketel 1. I love Black Russians. Have one with some fresh strawberries sometime its like a little piece of heaven. :love:

And I just have to say that I love Turner Classic Movies. I just watched Little Foxes with Bette Davis. It&apos;s one I&apos;ve been meaning to watch for a while now but just haven&apos;t. It was great. Perfect role for BD. She really sunk her teeth into it and I really hated her. At the very end I felt a little sorry for her. Only a little because she brought it on herself. I love BD. Dark Victory always makes me cry like a baby. Jezebel is classic spoiled brat BD. All About Eve makes me want to be glamorous and wicked. And Whatever Happened to Baby Jane is just stunning. Next time you see a BD movie is coming on TCM - watch it. You won&apos;t be disappointed. Thorn 03-31-2004, 07:34 PM All I have to say to Summer is

Bring It On.

I just ordered a new hammock.

Last year I was hammockless. It sucked. I had a great hammock for years and then it just started to fall apart on me and I just never got around to ordering one last year.

I am picky about hammocks.

1. Must have only 2 attachment points at either end. Ive seen them with a single point at one end and two at the other. Not good. Cannot achieve optimal rocking with 3 attachment points.
2. Must be solid no mesh rope stuff. Must be solid so things dont fall out and I dont get waffle ass.
3. Must have pillow. Said pillow can be attached to the hammock or loose Im not too particular about the pillow.
4. Must have moveable stand. This way I can follow the sun or the shade around the yard depending on my inclination.

This new hammock meets all criteria.

So I say to summer.

Bring it!

And on a completely different note Im apparently doing very well at work. I got a call today from my trainer and semi-supervisor telling me that when she ran an activity report in the database, she was very impressed at my efforts so far. To me they arent that spectacular. Which leads me back to the thought that even if I put in a assed effort, it will be great to them. I also got my first job order opportunity today. This means that my client has a job that my recruiters can go to work on finding candidates. I was pretty psyched.

There is another account manager in another office who has only been there a couple of months. After hearing him on the phone in meetings, I didnt get the impression that he was the sharpest crayon in the box. But it was his conversation with Hockey Man today that put me over the edge. He was calling to ask how to put new clients and/or contacts into our database.

What?? Youve been here for months and you havent added a single new contact or client to your list?? What have you been doing?? He also mentioned that he was having a hard time finding prospects to call. What?? Thats sales 101 knowing how to find prospects. From what I know, we were in very similar industries before arriving at our new company. How did he find prospects then, the lead fairy?? Puh-leez. Today I perused 5 sources for prospects and found many. Not just one or two a dozen or more. What a numbskull.

So anywayIm feeling pretty good right now even though its still new to me and I dont know all the ins and outs yet. Im light years ahead of Jethro there.


And it looks like my buddy Busted Knee is getting out of my former employer. Woo hoo! Do the dance of joy. He just told me his salary. Yikes its huge. But better than that, I think we can really help each other with leads and contact sharing and things like that. Weve known each other for 10 years and trust each other. Im very happy that hes getting out. I wish I could be there when he quits. OMG that would be fun! Thorn 04-04-2004, 02:09 PM So this is the time of year when I get annual reports from the companies that I own stock in. They are a riot to read. If any of you get them and just toss them, dont. Read the chairmans letter to the stockholders its a guaranteed laugh.

For example, heres a line from the Kimberly Clark annual report:
No wonder K-C owns more than two-thirds of the worlds pants market.

Theyre talking about freaking diapers!!

And one from Altria;
While PMI (Philip Morris International) will continue to grow organically and through acquisitions, one of its greatest opportunities is China

Damn! Well get those commie bastards one way or another!

Its so funny. I especially like the lets pat ourselves on the back for being such good corporate citizens pages. Where they talk about all their endowment of the arts and support for social programs. Anheuser Busch and Altria are the worst offenders, although Pfizer tries really hard to make sure you know they are changing the world (and peoples lives!) with their pharmaceutical innovations.

And they all use the same words sustainable growth plans, restructuring efforts, capitalization projects, family of products. Its great. Whoever writes this stuff should win prizes.

One thing I have noticed is the lack of female top executives at the companies in which I own stock. The average number of women on boards of directors is 2; the same goes for top management. Somehow I thought we would be better represented. I dont know where I got that idea but perusing the annual reports was a bit of a surprise. Oh and heres a weird one Billie Jean King is not seeking re-election to the board of Altria in 2004. BJK! One of the premier female athletes of our time was on the board of a tobacco company! How weird.

Anywayits worth a laugh to read the shareholder letter. I dont always understand all of the financial data, but I get the major stuff. Only people like my father-in-law actually read the rest of the things. Hes a money whiz and has been an extremely successful investor for 50 years. He also gives a lot of money away. Especially to his former college. So much so that the president of the college went to visit him at home in Florida. Oy. I think my husband worries that hes giving away our inheritance. I try not to think about it. I didnt marry BSBG for his money (well, potential money). If I had, I would have married him a lot sooner than I did.

I dont consider it our money though. Whatever comes will be his. It will be substantial though. Enough so that we wont ever have any major financial burdens (unless we want them) for the rest of our lives. It doesnt seem real even though it is. Weve always gotten along ok. Were not rich nor are we poor. We arent extravagant nor are we miserly. Its strange to think that it could get even better for us. Not so good that we can stop working thats not likely to happen, but so that we dont have to become corporate slaves forever. Well probably be able to stop working full-time in our 50s. That will be heaven.

But until then were both wage slaves. I am feeling more confident and at ease in my new job. Ive had some reasonably successful conversations with the executives I need to reach and have had my first job order come in. I hope that I can have my first start in time for my birthday in June. That would be a nice present. Management seems fairly pleased with my progress so far. I spend my entire day calling potential clients and researching companies. Thats sales 101. On Friday I found out that Jethro had left for lunch at 11:30 and at 4:00 still hadnt returned. No wonder hes sucking wind.

Well, I&apos;m off to watch and episode of Cracker on DVD. I love that series and wish it was still on BBCA. I just got season 2 and can&apos;t wait. The episode I&apos;m going to watch has Robert Carlyle in it. He&apos;s awesome in whatever he does (Trainspotting, Ravenous etc). And of course Robbie Coltrane is awesome. I think he&apos;s a very underrated talent. And if he was originally from here, he wouldn&apos;t be on screen at all. I can&apos;t for the life of me imagine an American show like Cracker casting him in the lead. But he&apos;s perfect as Fitz. Well, enough jabbering about it...I&apos;m off. Thorn 04-10-2004, 07:23 PM At my new health club there is an enormous swimming pool. Many aquatic exercise classes are given there each week. These are popular among the elderly because of the low joint stress aspect of exercising in water. So, three days a week there are a few ladies coming and going from the locker room. Many of them are nice to chat with. One day I took special notice of one old girl in a brightly flowered suit. Her hair was thin and entirely white. She was wrinkled and her skin sagged. She had varicose veins and age spots. She had cankles. She was beautiful.

With her flip-flops and her jaunty step, bathing cap hanging by one pinky. She was beautiful.

Fresh and glowing from the exercise she dripped water all through the locker room. She was beautiful.

I thought to myself that someday that is going to be me. My hair will be silver and Ill have age spots on my hands (I already have one and a few silver hairs). My breasts will deflate and droop. My skin will loose its elasticity and bunch around my knees. My butt will sag. I hope when this happens, someone still finds me beautiful.

I am nearly in tears at the thought of her fragility and her green-sapling hardiness. Please, let me be like her. Let me be interested in life and active in my old age. Let me not be afraid to pass before the judgmental eyes of the young. Let me hold my head up and take part. Maybe someone will think I still have beauty and grace.

I have never been afraid to grow old physically. I know my skin will begin to get crepey. My hair already has a few silver residents. My breasts have begun to change from what they once were. Ive noticed a few spider track veins in my legs. It doesnt scare me so much if my heart stays young. My will to stay in life has to survive. Please dont let me become ill mentally.

My grandmother had dementia a severe reduction of oxygen to the brain brought on by clogged carotid arteries. Had she elected to have surgery in her early 70s, she would probably still be alive. She declined the surgery saying she was too old. She lived more than 10 years after that decision and she didnt even know her own children, couldnt remember the name of her dead husband and forgot who anyone was within minutes of being told. My father told me she had moments of clarity where she would know him and her circumstances and she told him that she knew she was dying and she wasnt afraid.

Dad wouldnt let us see her that way. He wanted us to remember her the last time we saw her. And thats exactly how I see her. It was Christmas and I had given her a gift certificate to Filenes for some new clothes (oh how she loved dressing up). We were talking about the outfit she was wearing and what she wanted to buy the next time she went shopping. She never got to go. She declined rapidly that winter and in spring my aunt couldnt properly care for her in her home any longer and she had to go into acute care. My grandmother would forget to eat or sit freezing right next to the thermostat that she used to turn up just a few weeks before. She forgot how. Sometimes she would wet the bed and lie shivering in it all night because she forgot to call her daughter. It was heartbreaking.

I am afraid of that. Im afraid of it being me. I dont care if my body becomes arthritic (unlikely as it is not a family thing) or weak (also unlikely since I do weight bearing exercise), but if it does, I only hope my mind and my heart stay intact.

I want to be like the lady in the gym. Oh please let me be like the beautiful lady in the gym. Thorn 04-13-2004, 08:55 AM Well maybe not exactly but I am the queen of the goofballs today.

When I was in junior high, we got our first video game system. Intellivision II. We got a bunch of games - Frogger, Pitfall, Burgertime, Some wartime bombing game&amp;Baseball. Because my brother is 5 years younger than me, he had to go to bed earlier and mom and I would stay up till all hours playing games and laughing our heads off. He would yell at us to shut up because he was mad he didn&apos;t get to play with us. I don&apos;t know whatever happened to that game but I just bought one on Ebay.

Yeah I know - how weird but it wasn&apos;t a lot of $. And I just won an auction for a copy of Pitfall (for $1). It will cost me more to ship it than for the actual game! :loopy: But whatever. I&apos;m going to plug it in and play. I&apos;ll invite mom over and we&apos;ll play together just like we used to. I have auctions pending for Frogger and for Burgertime, too. The graphics are classic!

BSBG thinks I&apos;m nuts but I don&apos;t care. He buys weird crap too and for a lot more money that I&apos;m spending. And it makes me feel good to do something so goofy. Sometimes the best thing you can do for yourself is to do something silly and enjoy the hell out of it. With all the bad feelings and sadness in the journals these days, it sounds like a lot of you need to do this. Do something silly and goofy and just a bit irresponsible! Thorn 04-17-2004, 04:20 PM Life sucks then you die.

Its been 5 weeks of calorie restrictions and I have not lost one single pound.

You read correctly.

Not. One. Pound.

Nothing. Zip. Zilch. Nada. Fuck all.

Im pissed. So pissed in fact that I blew my diet all to hell yesterday by indulging in Chinese food, 2 Sam Adamses and a few glasses of wine. Im blowing it today and probably tomorrow too. What difference will it make? I didnt gain any weight when I ate that way and not eating that way did fuck all for my body comp so why the hell not??!! I told BSBG I was giving up and he didnt say a word. Figures. Im so fucking pissed off that I cant really think about it for fear of throwing things and screaming myself hoarse. Like right now I could take this fucking laptop and smash it on the driveway.

I just do not understand it. I exercise 5 days a week for an hour and a half. I ate less. Losing weight is just fucking math what the fuck is wrong with me?? I refuse to go hungry all fucking day either. I get really cranky and headachey and its just not good to stop eating all together. Probably though, thats what it will take for me to lose this 4% bodyfat. Ill probably have to be put into a coma for a month and fed nothing but green tea. That they only fucking way it will come off. BSBG just doesnt understand. He stopped eating yogurt for a month and lost 10 pounds. Fucker. I think Im too old and too far at the end of my fertility stage to lose weight. My body still thinks Im going to drop a brat and that just aint happenin.

Fuck me running I&apos;m so pissed! Thorn 04-20-2004, 04:19 PM What&apos;s with all the censorship on my last post. I used to be able to type F U C K.

The first track day of the year was a bit frustrating. My instructor had no experience with a high-horsepower car and we basically had a tug of war over the race line all day. Seriously the race line varies greatly from car to car depending on horsepower and torque. My car has tons of low-end torque and makes almost 300hp. I do not need to drive the conservative line!!! If you want me to stand on the gas out of turns you need to allow me to track all the way out!! If you make me pinch it off and stay near the center of the track, I cant get on the gas as much. If I do, Ill spin!! Freakin-A, you should know that!

Ugh. The whole day was her telling me to drive the line that she drives in an Audi with the power of my car. Unfortunately my instructor evaluation sheet blew away so I couldnt complain about this miss-match. I have a feeling they assigned me a woman because I am a woman, not because she was a fit for my car type or my driving style. I think Ill send an email and complain. And she had only been on this track twice! Ive been on it about 10 times and shes telling me where the race line is?? Please. Several times BSBG was given an instructor with an identical car to his 4wd Subaru, so I know they pay attention to this to some extent. They just really blew it with me this time.

As a matter of fact, I dont think Ive ever had an instructor with as powerful a car as mine. It makes me wonder if theyre deliberately assigning me someone with a 150-hp car so that if I drive conservatively (cause Im a chick dontcha know), I wont be coached otherwise. Theyre babying me I think. Once a guy I worked with was an instructor and I picked him. Even though he had an older M3 (4-banger) he understood the difference between his car and mine and how each should be driven on the track, and coached me to that difference. This last instructor didnt and it made for a much poorer learning experience.

Not that I didnt learn anything all day I did. I got much smoother in turn 8 and flagged in 11-11a and watched the instructors drive through there and after that I didnt miss it once. So I did learn, but not as much as I might have if I had someone who understood the difference another 120 horses makes. Plus I smoothed out turn 3 and as long as I remember to turn off the traction control, I can power up the hill like Im being fired from a cannon!

The day was perfect (over 80 degrees, dry and windy) and there was no bent sheet metal or body parts. Just a few spins, mechanical failures and loss of fluids on the track. My car performed very wellno fade with the new pads (but I never had any brake fade even with the stock pads) and the tires were sticky as hell and I didnt need to massively over inflate them in order to prevent rolling onto the sidewall. This track is so small that its very hard on brakes and tires. The car is almost constantly in a state of flux and youre constantly managing the balance, throttle, brakes, steering and contact patch. Watkins Glen is a much more relaxed track.

An interesting thing there was a student participating yesterday who looked to be of Indian/Pakistani descent. He was quite tall, probably around 30 and had a wonderful beard. His facial hair was very straight, and it was perfectly combed and groomed with just a few strands of gray amid the near-black. It began on his cheeks and ended just below his jaw line. Very striking and pleasing to the eye. I wanted to ask him about it and touch it but I thought it would be rude (or too nutty). Other than that, he had nothing terribly ethnic about him.

I thought that it was remarkably brave of him to wear it in this post 9/11 age. Most Americans cant tell the difference between Indians, Pakistanis and middle-easterners and wouldnt care that there are differences even if they knew. Ill bet this guy is grabbed out of lines and searched constantly. Ill bet he gets the hairy eyeball from everyone when he goes to the post office or the grocery store or even just getting gas. I understand why its done and probably so does he, but it still must suck.

So now Im back to work and sort of blah. At the gym I kind of floated through my routine. My brain is definitely not fully engaged today. And its freaking hot in this office. Oh a guy just went by on a motorcycleI wish I could be riding. I almost did this weekend but the lure of the new hammock was too great. That thing is awesome. I already fell asleep in it a couple times this weekend. Much snoozing in my future. Thorn 05-02-2004, 12:35 PM Well BSBG finally decided on a new car and theres a black 2004 Subaru WRX STI in the garage. After driving it only once, I can attest to its coolness. The ride is a bit stiffer than in the old WRX, and of course it makes gobs more power, but essentially its the same car. This time a sedan (it only comes in a sedan so there wasnt really any choice). The wing is huge and goofy but again, thats the only way it comes. He is going to have such a great time at the track!

In addition to the STI, we drove an Infinity G35 coupe and an Audi S4. The Infinity didnt make it into the top 2. Its too cushy and not in your face enough. Even though the S4 is high on luxury, it was very much an in your face kind of car. That V8 burble was wonderful and damn is it fast. Not as fast as the STI but damn quick. It was the first car that seriously made me think of trading my M3, it was that sweet. But alas, the salesman didnt try hard enough. Seriously, if he had called and did some selling, we might have done some selling. We were considering selling a couple of motorcycles in order to put a down payment down on the S4 (the only way we wouldnt be car-poor buying the S4 without trading my car). But the guy never called and boy when he does hes gonna be mad. Its his own fault though. And now we dont have to sell anything.

Other than that, nothing much going on. Work is going slowly but its going. Its difficult to build a territory from nothing. I have a meeting in a couple of weeks with a very large medical center attached to an Ivy League school, that we used to do a lot of business with. Hopefully I can revive the relationship and get some opportunity. We have a big meeting this coming week where some of the upper management types are coming to rally the troops. That should be interesting.

Lately its become very clear to me that the sales management staff has no background in sales. They were all recruiters. That is a very different job from account management. Some of the basic stuff that goes into sales is missing and its weird. Ive made a couple of suggestions and one is being aggressively worked on so who knows, I just might get what I want. The thing of it is, I heard about the project from someone else, and its changed from what I originally asked for. So I had to get a hold of that person and explain what I really want as opposed to what they were trying to gather. Like I said, it should be interesting.

I took one of the bikes to work on Friday, and the looks on the guys faces as I strode into the office in full leathers were priceless. Its been a while since Ive worked with people who dont know me, so the moment was terrific. During the week, I look like I should be in a career woman magazine. Tailored suits. Silk blouses. Sleek shoes. Jewelry. Even on Fridays I usually wear khakis and sweaters with boat shoes. The Vansons and Mad Max boots completely freaked them. It was great. Just when people think they have me pegged, I go and screw it up for them. Thorn 05-11-2004, 07:32 PM Sitting here listening to Al Greene&amp;Barry White and sipping a Ketel One martini very dry, using my mastercard bill as a coaster.

This weekend wasnt for relaxing. We took the new car out Saturday and drove around. It wasnt aimlessly. We had an aim. However we were not to hit the target. There is this place on Route 2 in Marshfield VT called Rainbow Sweets Caf&amp;Bakery. We found it a few years ago by accident and have been regular visitors ever since (albeit long-distance regulars). It serves the best pizza I have ever eaten. When a pastry chef with eclectic culinary leanings makes pizza, you better appreciate it.

Its kind of an indescribable place. Under a painted and much faded pink sign with rainbow lettering it has a wide front porch with a railing and rickety chairs, (the building was obviously a residence and the owners still live above the restaurant) and when you enter you are hit with the aroma of fresh pastry and the heat of the ovens. There is a counter to the right with the pastry case. To the left is a low wall parallel to the counter, and it separates the eating area from the kitchen. Lined up haphazardly on this wall are bottles of the types of Italian and French wines you can order (about 10 kinds) and representative beers and sodas. Tattered and flyspecked photographs depicting scenes from the 1890s are tacked to the lower part of the wall and the windows. The eating area is only about 8 feet deep and about 20 feet wide. There are 6 tables. Once I found a dying bumblebee inside and felt very sad for her.

Just behind the pastry counter is an ancient commercial oven with 2 chambers. Just above it is a stuffed moose head of about the same vintage. The kitchen is the same size as the dining area. In the middle of it all stands Bill.

Welcome friends! Were the first words he said to us upon entering. Welcome and come in. Sit and stay a while. Youve found the oasis in the gastronomic wasteland!

We were a bit surprised by this hearty welcome and effusive greeting. But his wide smile and obvious delight at our reactions relaxed us. Besides, who can take offense with a man who makes pastry like the ones we saw before us?

Bill came up to the counter and invited us to drool over his creations. Hes wearing an old sweater with the elbows worn out and his glasses are slightly askew. His hair looks like he just woke up from a nap.

Profiterrole? He asks. Puff pastry with custard and two caramel-covered balls with whipped cream the Sophia Loren of pastry. Or Sean Connery. He added with a sly grin at me.
Lunch first. We say.
To drink?
Waters, please. We grab a seat.
Two Desert Cocktails. Bill says over his shoulder to someone behind him and out of sight.

In a few minutes, two glasses of room temperature tap waters are on the table and were settling into the menu. A thing we hardly needed once Bill told us of the daily special. Moroccan chicken pie. Shredded chicken with saffron and other spices inside a filo dough shell. Greek salad on the side.

The feta is so good we have it trucked in armored cars right from New York City. Bill tells us with a grin. After tasting the salads, we agree. Heaven. But the Moroccan chicken was another slice. Melt in the mouth. So good I cant believe Im in the middle of nowhere Vermont.

Dessert is more than our brains can take. During the meal we chatted with Bill about our motorcycles (which he went outside to admire and came back in with tales of his own BMW /2 which is in the garage next door and was viewed by us on a later visit I should have known it would be Bavarian Cream). I had a slice of German Plum Tart and BSBG had Sophia Loren.

A quick trip to the unisex reveals newspaper clippings from The NY Times an others, praising the works of Bill and his wife from the last 30 years (Bill looked cute in sideburns). We always take home boxes of goodies to go and we try to make them last as long as we can. The shortbread cookies shaped like kayaks with raspberry preserves on top are my personal favorites.

But alas, he wasnt prepared to feed us this past weekend. The sign on the door said Coming May 19th. Thud. I almost cried. While we were sitting stunned and disappointed in the car, he came out and greeted us as though we were his long lost children. They close for a few months in winter and go on vacation, usually to Europe where he finds new recipies. Well just have to make another trip. Go ahead, twist my arm. Thorn 05-13-2004, 07:08 PM So recently it has been discovered that certain US Soldiers had been abusing/humiliating Iraqi prisoners of war. There have been photographs of nude men in black hoods with their hands tied behind their backs, piled on top of each other as if dead and on leashes or with underwear on their heads. I found these images to be somewhat shocking and they didnt make me very proud. Whoever is responsible should be held accountable and punished. In the photos the prisoners looked OK in the physical sense. No bruises or cuts or broken bones. At least not in the shots I saw, and I have to assume there were none because they surely would have showed us those too.

Then two days ago, a video was broadcast of some terrorists holding an American civilian named Nick Berg. The video began with the usual taunts and threats and ended with them beheading him with a dull knife. They said it was in retaliation for the prisoner abuses.

Which is getting the most airplay/sympathy/outrage?

The prisoner scenario of course. The left wing media and politicians are more outraged and angry over the NON-LETHAL treatment of men whom moments before capture were trying to kill our soldiers, than they are over the savage murder of one of their fellow countrymen. Unbelievable. Whats more unbelievable is that everyone seems to think this is OK. What a bunch of assholes. It makes me so angry I can hardly continue to think about it.

What about the treatment of the 4 Americans who were tortured, butchered, dragged through the street and mutilated? These people aren&apos;t condemned or even punished. No one freaked out at their treatment of us. No one put those photos up. Want to know why? Want to know the difference? Because those photos were about murder and death and that&apos;s what those people do. It&apos;s so common that we can&apos;t even comment on it and we certainly don&apos;t show it. The FCC won&apos;t let you see that, but it will let you see a blurry picture of a hairy, naked guy with panties on his head. I&apos;m sorry, we can&apos;t show you real atrocities, happening to our citizens - they&apos;re too graphic. Here, look at this guy on a leash instead. Can no one see that this is not an honorable enemy?

And what about the publication of the photos themselves? Granted, it was not illegal to publish them but neither did it show good judgment or sense. It almost crosses the line to giving aid and comfort to the enemy and it apparently caused the death of yet one more American. I wonder if anyone feels responsible or bad about it at all. I doubt it. None of them really understand the far-reaching aspect of what they say and they dont think beyond their noses.

It reminds me of some statements that the fat, bloated asshole Teddy Kennedy said a month or two back. He announced that the war in Iraq was George Bushs Vietnam. Oh thats just great, Ted. Why dont you just go on Iraqi TV and tell them to hang in there, well lose sooner or later. And then the moron follows it up by saying that our soldiers basically had targets on their backs. Fabulous Ted! Ill bet our soldiers morale went up 50 points with that one.

Doesnt he think beyond his gigantic gut? The enemy hears these things, too. It makes them happy when we tear down our own military and state what a horrible position we are in. They love it when we dont act as a unified country. They love it when we show weakness and obvious gulfs between our leaders and our soldiers. Way to go, Ted. Treasonous pissant.

Why are we continuing to fight this war in such a stupid way? If the Iraqi insurgents showed up with sticks and rocks, would we put down our M16s? Thats basically what were doing by forcing our soldiers to fight this bullshit house-to-house thing. Setting them up for the slaughter theyve been receiving. We need more firepower. If a neighborhood is harboring insurgents and we know it, announce that they better come out or well bomb the neighborhood. When the time limit expires, bomb away. After one or two of these, the neighbors wont harbor these terrorists anymore and well be able to round them up.

But omg, we cant kill civilians can we?? We must have our soldiers killed one-by-one instead. Yes, thats vastly more palatable. How can we value the lives of total strangers over that of the people out there risking their lives for our safety and/or freedom?? Its unbelievable. These people who want our soldiers to continue this cat and mouse bit, Id love them to have to go to the mothers, fathers, husbands and wives of the soldiers they are in such a hurry to get killed. Go to these people and tell them why they value the lives of the foreign enemy above that of their son/daughter/wife/husband. Tell them why having their loved one killed is worth it. Explain to them why it is preferable to have their son/daughter/wife/husband killed than a total stranger in an enemy country. Actually, Id like one of them to explain it to me. Thorn 05-16-2004, 10:29 AM Its raining. Pretty spectacular thunderstorm last night. I love thunderstorms. The power of them and the way they reduce us to the insignificant mammals we really are. Ive never been afraid of them (its just an atmospheric discharge says Dr. Frankenstein). BSBG got the steaks off the grill just before the heavens opened with a terrific deluge. My stupid cat is out in it now. Hes probably under the FLC.

I somehow wrecked my left shoulder and it hurts to do a lot of simple things these days. I have no idea how it got this way, it just began to hurt the other morning. Probably my lifting will be interrupted. Strangely, it didnt hurt until Friday, well after I did anything that used the shoulders in a major capacity. Great.

Work is plodding along. Building a territory from zilch sure is hard. Some days its easy to slip into a slough of despond and frustration, but I try not to let it get to that. I knew the reality of this situation going in. I know what it takes because Ive been there and done it before. Still, I sometimes feel useless and unproductive. Im not used to feeling like a non-producer (I was always in the top 3 sales spots in each sales level I attained) and occasionally it gets to me. Working hard usually means results; in sales it just takes longer.

So, the company is throwing me a bone by giving me the Sun Microsystems account. Im not sure how much of a bone it will be considering they have to lay off 6000 people shortly. Just how Im supposed to get contractors into a place where they need to reduce staff is a mystery. But Ill certainly work it and see whats there. Who knowsmaybe the work some of those 6000 people will be critical enough that theyll take some of them back as contractors. It is less expensive in the long run. Ill also have to check into the status of the people we already have working there, hopefully none of them will be terminated.

This means Im going to have to travel a lot in the upcoming weeks/months. Colorado, California and definitely the offices within driving distance from me. I havent flown since prior to 9/11 so it will be interesting.

My friend Olga is preggers. She told me last week and I dont know what to make of it. She knows how I feel about kids, so I dont think shell be expecting much in the way of enthusiasm. For an environmentalist, she sure has turned her back on her beliefs. In a way its a good thing that shes been physically far from me for so long. Now I wont suffer from her lack of having a life. Its not like Im used to us doing stuff together and going places, and now that she wont be able to for 20 years I wont even feel it. Her husband better hurry up and get a job now. In my opinion hes a worthless bum, but she thinks hes wonderful. The pressure is on now though and he better start acting like a man instead of a child.

They both are connected to the medical field though and Ive offered to see if I can help them out through some client contacts. My meeting with big-medical-school-connected hospital last week got moved to this week, so maybe I can put out some feelers for them. It will mean they have to move to this state instead of a neighboring state, but now that shes pregnant the reason for moving to the neighboring state is moot. Ill do what I can. I want her to be happy and secure, thats the bottom line.

Shes such a nut (and this is why I love her), she writes to me that her boobs are sore, and then says that its about time they have a purpose other than for entertainment! I cracked up. I miss her. Im used to it though.

Busted Knee starts his new job tomorrow. I talked to him a couple of weeks ago and hes pretty psyched. Of course our ex-employer found out where hes going and will probably sue him over his non-compete. He says hes got something that will work against that. I know what it is but its too complicated to write out. It might have success. I hope it does.

My other friend, HTML Girl is breaking up with her fianc. Its been a rocky relationship for a long time now come to think of it; it has been the whole time Ive known her. She told me once that her 8-year-old daughter even told her that the guy was a creep. But they patched it up a while ago and bought a house together and he gave her a beautiful diamond ring. Then just a week ago or so, she says theyre splitting for good and shes buying a condo in the same town where she works. I hope she finds the serenity and security shes looking for. We should get to hang out more this summer when her daughter goes to her dad.

Im so glad that my marriage is stress-free. Hes like my anchor, my rock. Hes always there and Im always glad to see him. Plus were very weird and to us its normal. Its so cool.

It has stopped raining and the Orange Menace has come inside. Such is our life. Thorn 05-20-2004, 05:00 PM Its interesting how the media distorts events. On CNN and in newspapers and local TV station web sites, there are articles about a talk given by Dan Brown, the author of The DaVinci Code. To read these articles, one would suppose that he sat at the lectern and ranted and raved about the Catholic Church and Christianity, dumping on both and slinging insults. He did no such thing. I was there.

Ive always been distrustful of the news media, but now Im even more so. Never before have I been directly involved in the events of a story, and now that I have it has really helped me to understand the spin. They dont want us to know the facts per se, they want us to see the facts as they want us to view them. Thier way.

Because we have an extremely conservative local newspaper, they made Dan Brown out to be the enemy of religion. Hes not the enemy of religion; he just has different ideas about the interpretation of history and the complete obliteration of the feminine divine. Im not a believer of any kind, so maybe this is just me being insensitive.

According to the CNN article, it seems that Mr. Brown gave this talk just to stir up more controversy and get people to buy his book. Maybe thats true, but I think that hes had just about all the publicity and controversy he can manage. Personally, I think it was way out of control. The book is a work of fiction after all, and if people are moved to ponder and discuss religion, and the religious are moved to examine and defend their beliefs, why is this bad?

On a completely different note, Im very frustrated with my job. Frustrated but not despairing. I havent reached the place where I think I cant do this or I hate it, but Im frustrated by my lack of progress. It isnt for lack of trying though. Im making tons of phone calls, but people just arent buying. The market is VERY soft and the territory is very dead. Its harder and harder to last a whole day. Like today I was supposed to meet w/a client but it got changed again and that was a blow to my psyche. Im torn between taking some time off (mental health day) and feeling guilty about it, and suffering through another day knowing my heads not in the game and very little will actually get done. Damn my work ethic.

4:50pm
Still here at work. Ive done very little as predicted earlier. Am listening to When Harry Met Sally. Its the only romantic comedy I actually like. Crystals one-liners are great. Only an hour to go. I think I can fake it for that long.

Tomorrow I may have a sudden illness though. Esp because BSBG is taking the day off. Swine. Thorn 05-25-2004, 07:51 PM These last few days have been miserable weather-wise. Rain, thunderstorms (which I like, actually) cold temperatures (for May), drizzle and gray skies. Im glad that I took Friday off and got to enjoy the last nice day it seems were going to have for a while yet. I didnt do much. Tried to go hike around at a nearby nature preserve, but some beavers got to work and most of the trails were flooded out. Foiled by rodents.

I used to live across from a large lake and we had a family of beavers living almost directly opposite my apartment. Several times during the spring&amp;summer I would see the parents and sometimes, the babies. Once I caught them just after a swim and the little ones were getting a grooming lesson from mom. The sun was catching their fur just right and they were just about the cutest things ever, pressing their tiny paws up and over their heads (starting at the back) and then rubbing their bellies. OMG they were adorable. Every once in a while dad would drive by to inspect and then move off.

There was a heron down that end of the lake, too. He was tougher to observe, and when he flew off in a huff he would make the most gawd-awful noise. It made me wonder if theyre right that dinosaurs evolved into birds.

Im such a softie for nature stuff. On rainy nights, I swerve to avoid toads (not that I wouldnt on dry nights, but I hardly see toads in the road when its not raining). And today I rescued a night-crawler from the parking lot. He was all stretchy and trying in vain to find cover. I picked him up (wriggly little bugger) and put him in the grass. The women in the office think Im nuts. I rescue spiders too when they need it. Once a boyfriend caught me in the garden patting bumblebees. Theyre just so fuzzy and bumbly that I cant help myself.

I hope we can get out to hike this weekend. I want to get in some good ones this summer to prepare for Utah in September. Were going to Bryce Canyon (which isnt really a canyon) and to Zion. Were going to do a modified California/Colorado trip; anchor hotels in each area and branch out from there. Im sure well have enough to occupy us at each end. I cant wait. The photos Ive seen of that part of Utah seem like another planet. Its otherworldly and utterly beautiful.

People are often amazed when I tell them that weve done no traveling outside of the US (unless you count a week in Aruba). Its just that the US is so big and so diverse and so interesting that I want to see most of it before I go outside. So far weve spent time in Colorado, Arizona, Northern New England, upstate NY, South Carolina, Monterey, California and the Great Lakes area. Ive been in the Pacific Northwest but he hasnt, so well probably go there. Then I want to see Death Valley and The Outer Banks. Then maybe more of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Smokey Mountains. BSBG really wants to go to WV because they are supposed to have great roads. Bambookie?? OH and Alaska! The Aleutian Islands look so mystical and safe somehow. Plus Glacier Bay. Gotta go to Alaska.

Then maybe well go outside of the US. The first place I want to go is Greece or Italy, I think. Then England and maybe Russia. Germany too would be cool. Costa Rica is supposed to be beautiful, with many protected areas. Perus mountains and ancient cultures also have allure. Id also like to see Iceland, if nothing else then to get the joke. But it will have to wait a while so much USA to explore.

Recently went on a music-buying binge, both downloaded and CDs. I always feel like I have the weirdest taste when I go to the CD store even though everything I like is terribly mainstream. This time I got some Monster Magnet, Anthrax, Cheap Trick, AC/DC, Warren Zevon and Deep Purple. I tried to find some Gene Vincent, but that will have to be an Amazon purchase. My musical rut doesnt bother me much. I just dont have the patience to wade through the miles of dreck to get to the gems. Lately its been an older, established (and in some cases deceased) artist who catches my ear. Like Robert Palmer. I never really knew much of him other than the popular 80s stuff. Then I played BSBGs copy of Sneakin Sally Through the Alley and wow! It blew me away. I had been content with that up until a couple of months ago when I bought a huge compilation CD.

There was a thread on the Off-Topic forum that asks about divergent musical tastes in a relationship and whether or not its a deal-breaker. BSBG and I have similar tastes but there are glaring differences. In general, music is more important to me than to him. Im always the one who spins vinyl on a weekend evening. Im the one who changes the radio station if something sucky comes on. Im the one with the iPod. I will buy 6-10 CDs to his 1. I flip on VH! Classics and watch All Star Jams. He hasnt gone to one concert since Ive known him.

So yeah, music is important to me. But did I immediately run screaming for the hills when on our 2nd date I discovered not just a Lionel Richie album in his collection, but a Frankie Goes To Hollywood as well? Nope. Everyones entitled to a mistake now and again. Even his U2 and Enya CDs werent enough to drive me off. The rest of his collection had enough overlap to make it OK. We both think that Lazy is the best Deep Purple song ever.

His taste runs a bit less heavy than mine. I regularly listen to Anthrax and Ministry, he doesnt. He regularly listens to Rush and Cake, I dont. Luckily he shares my hatred of Peter Frampton and Fleetwood Mac. Im trying to get him to appreciate the genius of The Clash, Primus and David Bowie, but I fear its a losing battle. He can appreciate them (well, maybe not Primus), listen to me wax poetic about them and pick out their stuff on the radio, but hell never grab one of their CDs on his own and put it in the car. Same with Slade and Corrosion of Conformity. But neither will I volunteer to put on Devo or Thomas Dolby. He has embraced Clapton more fully, however and has a greater affinity for classical of all types.

So our difference is not a deal-breaker. Mostly because our differences are in the same ballpark. If he was into Country-Western or Rap (or vise versa), I think it would be different. Ear cancer! Thorn 05-30-2004, 09:20 AM BSBG is in the kitchen making pancakes. Were having a great weekend so far. Yesterday we hiked up one mountain, across to another and down it. The total distance was about 5 miles and about 2200 feet in elevation, so it sounds more impressive to write it that way than it actually was. There were many people on the trails and we saw 4 dogs. One of them was a 1-year-old Bernese Mountain dog. Those are so cool. Theyve been on our list of future dogs for a long time. Of course, their hair is long and shaggy so its probably as bad a choice as the Alaskan Malamute that I long for.

But Im digressing. The trails we hiked were very wet with runoff from the last week of rain, and my new Asolo boots were great (and Im still very happy with my LowePro camera backpack). I could slog right through the middle and it was fine. The steep parts were very steep (thinking about getting some trekking poles to make it easier and safer) and very rocky. We ate lunch near the top of the mountain on a huge piece of exposed granite, with scrubby trees all around. A few minutes later we hit the summit and the views of the nearby lake and valley were truly beautiful. The mix of greens from the newly leafed trees, the blue sky and white clouds, the misty mountains in the distanceworth the hike. I brought along my trusty OM-3 and shot a little. I have an idea to go back in the fall and see the color change from that same view. It will be stunning. I brought 4 lenses and only used 2. On the summit I was using the 90mm and had horrible visions of losing my footing and have $1200 worth of equipment go smash-o. I waited so long for that body and that lens that I would cry.

Anyway, we came home, had a couple of beers and then he made steaks and we had a lovely Greg Norman cab/merlot. We watched Barcelona which was pretty good in an 80s kind of way. Then we went to bed, made love and fell gently and contentedly asleep. What a great start to a weekend. This is what I live for. It is so simple but so pleasurable. I am so lucky to have found my one. All the drama I made for myself when I was young was worth it. The lessons I learned about relationships and about me made it possible for me to know what I want and recognize it when it came along (who knew it would be bald!?).

So today we have a few errands to run, then lots of oil to change and then were heading to my bros for his annual Memorial Day bash.

One kind of fly in the ointment lately, is the eye symptoms I may be manifesting. Ive probably mentioned that Fuchs Dystrophy runs in my family. Last year my dad had a corneal transplant in his right eye (be an organ donor please!) and is getting the left eye taken care of in July. Hes in his early 60s and the new corneas (which are natural and known as cadaver corneas) will last about 10 years and then hell need them replaced. His sister is having transplants in August because her vision is so bad its beginning to affect her daily life. Well, one of the early symptoms of Fuchs is severe eye dryness, especially when one wakes in the night or first thing in the morning.

Thats whats been going on with me. Lately its felt like sandpaper in my eyes at the times I mentioned above. It hurts like hell and takes longer than it used to for them to tear up and feel better. So this kind of makes me nervous. Much of my physiognomy comes from my dad. I inherited his hair (yes!), his hands, his feet (boo!), his build, his skin and most definitely his eyes. Im worried that I will also need corneal transplants sometime in the future. Granted, it probably wont be for something like 30 years but stilljust thinking about it makes me a little squirmy. Im grateful and thankful that such surgery exists, and it has the lowest rejection rate of any transplant surgery, but still - operating on my EYEBALLS!!! Dad said its very painful and that you have to be sedated to below REM sleep and that shuts down your digestive system; thats just icing on the cake.

But its better than blindness.

So be an organ donor! Lend us your corneasyou wont need them anymore. Ive been an organ donor since my first drivers license. Thats how I figure it, take what you need, I wont need it anymore. When my mothers sister went into acute renal failure, I was tested but I wasnt a match. They never found kidneys that matched her and she died of acute renal failure a few years later. Its really wicked. Her whole body just shut down. Her stomach literally turned into a spongy mass and her veins and arteries started collapsing. It was torture to watch. When she knew death was unavoidable, she told the hospital staff to take out the feeding tube and stop the dialysis. She talked to everyone and told us goodbye because soon, without the dialysis, the toxins would build and she would be delirious and unable to think clearly. The NO RESUSSITATION sign went up over her bed.

She died on my moms wedding anniversary. My mother lost part of herself that day. Now every year she celebrates and mourns at the same time. Its a weird time. And its coming up in about a month.

But the month is also full of good stuff; my dads birthday, my sister-in-laws birthday, fathers day, their anniversary and my birthday (4 vehicles to register!). Basically I go broke. Its fun though.

And today should be fun too. Good food and cool people. Sunshine. Thats all I need. Life goes on. Live it. Thorn 06-02-2004, 10:11 AM David Bowie is a god.

A rock god.

He opened the show with Rebel, Rebel and closed it with the signature Ziggy Stardust. Everything in between was genius. Surprisingly, he only did 3 songs from Reality (and none were Looking For Water which kicks ass). I was hoping for a bit more but the old standards still move me. He did The Man Who Sold the World, Suffragette City, Ashes to Ashes, Im Afraid of Americans, Quicksand, Diamond Dogs, All the Young Dudes, Heroes, Under Pressure, (with Diane the bass player singing Freddys part) and a bunch more. He played for more than 2 hours! Woo hoo!!!

Get this. He just finished The Man Who Sold The World and I said to my friend that it would be so amazing if he would do Station to Station. Two songs later they played it. I was in heaven. Heaven I tell you. Since the set list changes every night, it was pure luck that I got to hear Station to Station. Now if they just did Big Brother it would have been the ultimate. Or Candidate. Or Teenage Wildlife. He could sing to me for days and I would never tire of hearing him. I was sad that he didn&apos;t play sax. He blows a most amazing alto sax. But alas, he stuck to guitar only.

I am so happy to have finally heard him live. What a voice. Im sort of surprised he can still sing as well as he does though, considering how much he smokes. If hes not careful hell end up like Warren.

The opening band was truly bizarre. A bunch of obvious band geeks called The Polyphonic Spree. The name says it all. I think they had one of everything in this band except possibly for bassoon and tuba. No kidding, they had a full sized harp, French horn, trombone&amp;kettle drums! Plus the fiddle and various harpsichord type things. Weird. There had to be 20 of them, each dressed in a different colored robe. It was like there was a sale on mismatched bed sheets and they said hey, we should wear those on stage!&quot;. None of them were over 30 (at least as far as I could see) and you could tell they wish they had been born in 1950 so they could have been real hippies. I bet theyre all programmers during the day theres too frickin many of them to make money on any gig. Oy.

So now Im listening to DB all day. Rock and Roll With Me is on. Now that would have been something to hear live. What a voice. Hes truly amazing. And he can still whip around that stage like hes 25. Pretty good for an old dude. The thing that amazes me most about him is his limitless ability to change himself and to experiment. Many fans dropped him in the 90s because he changed to a harder, more techno sound (Outside&amp;Earthling), but after his stint with Tin Machine, how could they be that surprised? I loved Tin Machine and Earthling is excellent.

The only period that I dont particularly care for is the late 80s. The whole Lets Dance thing was the beginning of a bad time. Its tolerable, but Never Let Me Down was just a travesty of commercialism. Last night someone in the audience had a sign asking him to play Blue Jean. He toyed with them but in the end, he didnt play it. I think hes embarrassed. I mean, with his whole career of awesome music and that moron has to ask for the most inane and bland shit. Please shoot her. Unworthy ears.

Anywayit blew me away and Im still a bit stunned that I was actually there. Thorn 06-06-2004, 07:08 PM BSBG is a magazine junkie. He gets at least 6 car magazines (3 specifically for BMWs), 3 or 4 motorcycle magazines (1 for Beemers), various gun magazines, Widescreen Review and Muscle&amp;Fitness. Some of these I will read; like Car&amp;Driver, M&amp;F and the Bimmer mags. I get a birding magazine (which isnt as stupid as it sounds), dwell and Archaeology. He reads the birding one and occasionally flips through dwell.

Ghosts of magazines past include Cigar Aficionado, Flex, some other bodybuilding mag, various home theater magazines (that were useful when we were building our system), Playboy and probably more that I cant remember.

The latest edition is Cargo. Its Cosmo for men. Young men. BSBG is probably the oldest subscriber by far. Pick one up if you can, its a laugh. Like the fashion magazines for women, its one long, continuous ad. It has nifty sidebars with color-coded fonts and zippy graphics. The thing that got me was the little stickies that are included in the magazine for guys to mark off the pages that feature things they want to buy. Bahahahaha!

But that wasnt the thing that got the biggest laugh. Nope. It appears that they believe there is so much information in their publication; the average guy simply wont be able to remember it all. So when he goes to the store to buy that bottle of wine/computer/digital camera/deodorant, he will be as clueless as he was before he read the magazine. Was the chardonnay the way to go, or the Pinot Grigio? What was the best bang for the buck, megapixels or resolution? Wait a tick, Ive got these handy little cards that I tore out of the back of Cargo, and they have all the information I need to make this purchase!

I can just imagine some dork pulling these little cheat sheets out and trying to appear intelligent and well informed. It almost makes me want to be 15 years younger and dating again, just to see some dude try to hide the thing inside the wine list and keep the waiter from seeing it, or worse, me. Or if I worked in a retail camera store again and some guy took out his little Cargo card to help him through his digital camera buying woes. Oh man

****************************************************************************

I must say that I love iTunes. I just spent the last hour or so downloading songs (Greg Khin, Im such a dork) and making a new playlist. Its great when you only want a few songs from a CD, you pay for what you want and only what you want. I love these things. I did one the other day called Gunplay, which should be fairly self-explanatory. Lots of The Clash in that one. My new playlist is called Groovy (say it like Ash does now) and is all 60s stuff :

Anyway, track day coming up tomorrow. The cars all set. Im a bit anxious to see my instructor assignment now that Ive complained. Whether or not theyve taken anything into consideration or if they care at all. I wasnt overly harsh or accusatory in my critique, but sometimes men take anything negative from a woman as a bitch-fest and just dismiss it as something hormonal. Heres hoping I get a person with a powerful car and tons of track experience. At least the weather is supposed to cooperate. I cant wait. I am determined to kick ass. No one shall pass. Just kidding.

Yesterday we went riding for the first time in weeks. There was dust all over my bike and a huge cobweb behind the rear wheel (of course I relocated the resident spider before I moved the bike). I felt a little ashamed. Just a couple of years ago we rode constantly. We were out every weekend and sometimes during the week, too. Now we just have too much going on and too many things to take care of. Plus we are inherently lazy. Like today Im content to just hang around the house, alternately reading, surfing and doing chores. Am now drinking a Ketel One martini, especially made for me by BSBG.

Im reading a biography of Elizabeth I. She was an amazing woman: strong, intelligent, resolute, shrewd and politic. Everyone underestimated her because she was female. The wisest decision she made was perhaps, her decision to remain unmarried. That was nearly unfathomable for the men of her court. For a woman to remain unmarried would surely poison her bodily and spiritually. It was an unnatural state for a woman and was certainly a sign of some deep, psychological malady. Ha! She knew that marriage would put her at the greatest risk, especially if she became pregnant. Not only was childbirth inherently dangerous, but also the birth of a male heir could further strip her of her power. By remaining single, Elizabeth held onto her power and preserved her health (mental and physical).

It is theorized that her aversion to marriage came from the examples her father gave her. Her own mother, Anne Boleyn was beheaded by her father when she was still a baby. As she grew, the realization that her father, Henry VIII, either divorced or executed almost all of his wives, must have been nearly a physical assault. How could a right-thinking woman put herself in anothers power so completely? Elizabeth stated on more than one occasion that she would rather be a penniless and unwed milkmaid, than a married Queen. Plus her sister Marys disastrous marriage to King Philip of Spain gave her proof that a marriage alliance with a foreign prince or king would further weaken the sovereignty of England. A truly amazing woman. I will tell you more as I read more. Thorn 06-08-2004, 10:58 AM Finally! My instructor yesterday drove a GT2 and not only did she have lots of track time, she is an SCCA racer as well. Woo hoo! I was so relieved. She was a very cool and very competent driver. Fast, too. Unbelievably fast. Damn that GT2 is loud. One of the control guys came over&amp;told her she was running about 110db every lap. Theres a noise ordinance, so its good of them to tell her. I was so bummed that it doesnt have another seat so I couldnt go for a ride with her, but I watched her closely when I was flagging. A GT2 sigh. To be rich.

So how did I do? Well, my line is dead on and I know when I screw up and I know why. My instructor would ask me every time I goofed, which is a good thing. I also keep my head and handle a crisis well yay. There was a spin out just ahead of me in turn 11. This is the final turn of the track where after you apex, you stand on it and launch out onto the front straight. Its a fast turn and fairly technical. Thats where the person was spun out, right in the middle of the race line. I was going over 50mph at the time.

I saw the yellow flag out, the flagger waving maniacally. The next 1/3 of a second I saw the white M3 in the turn. I immediately came off the gas, straightened the wheel and got on the brake, driving over the slight birm and onto the grass. No sheet metal bent, no problem. A bit of an adrenaline surge, but even that was slight.

Later, another instructor came up to me and said that he had a bunch of group 1 drivers (group 1 is the most advanced group) at that turn for the classroom session, and that many of them criticized what I did at that turn. He told them I did the right thing. They complained that I went into the gravel and might have continued on to crash into the wall. Give me a break. I wasnt going fast enough to hit the wall unless I didnt brake at all. And, if I had turned into the corner, I would have probably spun and smashed into the cars that were coming behind me (BSBG among them). How stupid. Group 1 drivers should freaking know better. Anyway, the instructor told me that he defended my decision to drive off course, and told me that if anyone told me otherwise, they were full of shit. It was pretty funny. Of course it was the right thing. No sheet metal was bent, the car was under control at all times and it was the safest way to avoid hitting the white M3 and anyone else. Even without this validation, I felt good about my decision and my instructor backed me up.

My speed was up and my consistency was improved. Im already smooth, so that with consistency = speed. In some turns, I had to track out much farther than ever before because I was carrying so much speed. I was moved up to run group 2 for this event. Hopefully they leave me there. Im not the fastest driver in the group, but Im not the slowest either. By this time next year, I should be going solo. The car was perfect as always. BSBG took a bit of time getting the feel for the STI, but once he got it he was up my butt. I had to let him by. Our driving ability is about equal, so with a faster car, hes got the edge. Its not all about horsepower though, I had guys in E30 M3s passing me because they are better drivers. Someday, that will be me passing an E46 M3.

One thing that was disappointing was the quality of the flagging. It sucked. So many times I went by flaggers and they didnt even look at my car once. Thats their job. Flaggers are there to make sure each car is intact and the track is clear. If something is wrong with either one, they are supposed to let the driver know. Even the couple of people I was flagging with were slackers, just talking to each other instead of watching the traffic. At one point a car was dropping fluid in turn 1 and it took until turn 5 for someone to get their head out of their ass and black flag the guy. Jeez! Control was not happy. And some people were hanging a standing yellow out when they shouldnt be. The whole point of flagging is to serve as a warning, if you hang a yellow out when theres nothing there, how the hell is a driver supposed to know the difference when there is something? Sloppy.

Edit: I just found out that after BSBG&amp;I left the track, the group 1 drivers had two simultaneous spins and they had to be red flagged, which means that all drivers have to get off the track surface while wreckers&amp;ambulances come&amp;attend to the spinners. No one hurt&amp;no sheet metal damage, but definite loss of seat time. Ironic. Thorn 06-09-2004, 08:31 PM I was in high school when Ronald Reagan was president. Sadly, I didn&apos;t pay much attention. I think he was a good man, but weirdly disconnected. He definitely thought that the ends justified the means. Sometimes, this is a good policy because it does away with politically correct BS, but other times it just causes more trouble and spreads disrespect. It&apos;s interesting how blind people can be though, and how revisionist their memory. Someone (I think on the OT board, but it may have been another board I frequent) said that he polarized a nation. Polarized? He won 49 out of 50 states in his reelection, whats the word Im looking for oh yeah, landslide. How can that possibly be construed as polarizing a nation? Good or bad, he was memorable that&apos;s for sure.

Thats why all this lack of respect from the Democrats is just unspeakable. The man was President of the United States. Something they nearly all aspire to be but never could on their best day even if they had 1000 of them strung in a row. Whatever happened to good, old-fashioned manners? If you dont have anything nice to say about someone (especially when theyre dead), shut the fuck up. If Bill Clinton died (and I cant stand the lying thief), he would be entitled to the same dignity and ceremony as Ronald Reagan is receiving today. He was President. It comes with the job. I hope when Jimmy Carter dies, the Republicans act with more decency and tact. I wont hold my breath.

It smacks of so much whining out of fear. Fear that the American public might remember how much they liked old Ron and decide that it would be a shame to remember him by voting for the most liberal senator we have, John Kerry. Fear that when the TV cameras pan over the crowd shots, that we might see a true cross-section of America. Check it out. Black, white, brown, yellow theyre all there.

Say what you like, Ronald Reagan gave us pride back. Jimmy Carter (a good man but a terrible president) basically told us there was no hope. America had lost its edge. We were a beaten people and we couldnt rise above it, we just had to bear up under it. Nice. Thats like if youre a kid and your family is having a problem, and your dad says that theres nothing you can do. Instead, Ron said to us that there was something we could do and he did it. He was a good conservative in many ways.

Didnt believe in AIDS? How come he approved $6 billion in AIDS funding for research? That was more than any other disease, including cancer and heart disease. He lowered taxes because he felt that high taxes (for everyone) were criminal. He strengthened the military (a big job after Carter basically dismantled the Navy, a strange thing to do for an Annapolis graduate).

Did he do everything right? Nope. No human being alive has ever done everything right. Its easy for the powerless and the spiteful to hurl stones.

The split between the parties has really become detrimental to the country as a whole and Im sick of it. Someone from another board I frequent said something like at least when our guys make a mistake, its usually some personal indiscretion, not some global catastrophe.

Our guys? Its attitudes like that that cause needless pain and strife. It polarizes us more than we need to be. What ever happened to compromise? Sticking to ones beliefs is admirable, but at what cost? Lately, neither party can get anything done and when they do, the rival party rapidly undoes it when they come into power. Its true that the philosophies of the parties are opposite, and most likely will never agree, but it seems to me that people are taking it to the extreme. They like to hear themselves talk and rail so much, that people who mildly objected to something were suddenly convinced that they should strenuously object now. Now to compromise is to give in, to weaken and betray your party affiliation. Now, if you cant make your whole and complete idea come to fruition, it is unthinkable to accomplish only some of it. Compromise has become a bad word and its shameful.

We have enough enemies outside of this country, we dont need to make fellow citizens the enemy. Thorn 06-11-2004, 09:53 AM This was on another board and I thought I&apos;d post it here as a snapshot of me at this moment. I hate these things normally, but this one isn&apos;t too obnoxious.

That last week, how you and your teachers just sort of coasted through. No one took anything seriously, they left the windows open during the day, in gym you just stood around or jumped rope or shot hoops, the cafeteria served tater tots with everything, the constantly full trash cans from locker clean-up, the mad yearbook signing scramble. Oh man what a feeling. Your freedom was so close that all you could do all day was dream about what you would do with all your free time. The anticipation of summer vacation was almost sweeter than the vacation itself.

Its the worst when youre a senior in high school. For me, the last month of school was just a big fuck off. We ruled the school and didnt care much about skipping class or taking one extra smoke break on the patio. The only things that they could punish you with were not letting you go to prom or keeping you from graduation ceremonies. Not that I was a particular troublemaker, but that feeling of being king of the hill for a little while was something I remember.

There was also some sense of accomplishment hey, I made it through another year. And if you were moving to another school, you felt sort of sad to be leaving the one you were in for so long. Only in August would the fear of the newness and bigness and upperclassmen come.

We dont have anything like that as adults. When we change jobs, even if its voluntarily, its a weird vibe. When we go on vacation, most of us are going to have more work when we get back (mostly to fix the screw ups people made trying to fill in for you). I wish we had stuff like that as adults. Some yearly period of anticipation and joy and carefree days.

Fridays here at work have a tiny molecule of that. Today 4 of us went to a Japanese steak house for lunch and goofed off for a couple hours. Now were all just being silly and playing the radio too loudly and singing to some of the songs (between actual work). Its nice. The rest of the week were pedal to the metal, so on Fridays its nice to hang loose. We also leave hour earlier than usual its a company thing.

But its still not even close to that last week of school. Thorn 06-13-2004, 06:55 PM How many wives would be able to deal with this? My husband is in the next armchair, reading about surgical speed shooting; techniques for winning or surviving a gunfight, and he has a Sig with him to practice dry firing the techniques therein. He was doing this on the back deck a few minutes ago. It wouldnt ordinarily bother me, but the neighbors were out with their kids and theyre just the type to mindlessly freak out and call the cops. Something I definitely dont need.

Anyway, its been another wonderful, relaxing weekend. Saturday we did errands as usual, and then I was hit with a wave of tiredness and decided against my hiking plan. Instead we drove to Marblehead, MA and did a little wandering in this lovely, old cemetery. I brought my beloved OM3 and shot a little. We saw some ducks. I love ducks. Particularly their feet. Duck are great. And they make quiet little quacky noises when theyre feeding. Its like theyre talking to themselves. Nuthatches do the same thing. Anyway, back to the cemetery.

I love cemeteries. Old cemeteries, that is. Luckily I live in New England and we have some of the oldest cemeteries in the US. I even bought a book that talks about the symbology and how it changed over the course of the few centuries Europeans have been in North America. I took a couple of shots of particularly interesting grave markers. One featured a skeleton with an hourglass and a winged figure with a scythe (representing time) overcoming him. Winged skulls were also popular as were symbols of the sun and the moon and the snake in a circle, eating itself. Its all about the end of our earthly time and the cycle of life. Pretty heady stuff for Puritans.

On either side of this cemetery visit, we did a little shopping. HMS for driving gloves, harness pads and neck supports/protectors. Then down the street, Saucony was having a tent sale and I got some good bargains. On the way back from Marblehead we stopped at REI and I got some trekking poles and he got some Gore-Tex hiking boots.

The Orange Menace is in for the rest of the month. If he werent such an indiscriminate killer of helpless baby birds, I would let him out. But, as it is, I have the death of two fledgling Eastern King Birds on my conscience from a couple of years ago. Theyre nesting in the front yard again and I will not allow their babies to be killed by my stupid cat. Plus, I think some titmice or chickadees are nesting nearby as well because I found an eggshell that could belong to either of them. They have a hard enough time as it is without me and the Orange Menace adding to it. Hes crabby but its better than dead birds. Seriously, I still feel guilty for the last time.

We went riding today. Just a quick 100 miles on some familiar roads. I think I need to adjust my handlebars further. Im having pain on this bike that I didnt on its predecessor. Since the two bikes are practically identical except for the handlebar placement, thats what I attribute my new pain to. The problem is, in order to get the bar backs further back, Ill need new brake and clutch lines. Theres just not enough length in the stock lines. Major pain in the butt.

Am listening to Roy Orbison (Careless Heart is on now). What a magical voice he had. So unique and lilting. And oh the songs! So sad. I only know of two happy Roy Orbison songs Oh, Pretty Woman and Running Scared. Those both end well, but the rest are pure broken hearted misery. It was awful when he died. He was more of an influence on rock and roll than many give him credit for. I think the Black and White concert was genius to honor the man by playing all his best songs with him! What an honor that must have been for the band that stood up with him. The Comedians is on. Another great example of the simple heartache Roy wrote about. It literally have goosebumps right now. His voice gives me shivers.

I am reading a very interesting book called Wicked by Gregory Maguire. It is the story of the Wicked Witch of the West and her childhood, upbringing and homeland of Oz. I have never read the books Frank L. Baum wrote; only saw the movie about 100 times. I kind of like it when another author goes into a tale we all know and turns it on its head. Thats what hes doing here. Oz is a torn country with the Wizard making things worse. Talking animals are fighting for their rights as citizens and cant keep up with how fast their rights are stripped from them. There is a massive drought in Muchkinland and the land next door is being stripped of its ruby riches and its inhabitants driven into camps and starved. I have a feeling Elphaba (the WW of the West to be) will become an agent of good in this story. The author has several other books along the same lines; Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister and Mirror, Mirror: A Novel are a couple more that Ill probably read after this one.

One of my favorite books is called Phantom. Of course its about Erik, who grew up to become the Opera Ghost. It deals with his childhood and gets into his head. When we read TPOTO, we only see Eriks actions and they appear to be diabolical and without consideration. This later author explains some of the whys and wherefores. I dont know if its in print any longer, but if you liked TPOTO as I did, if you read this you wont have your idea of Erik shattered.

Anyway, BSBG tells me that dinner will be ready soon, so Im closing up shop for today. Thorn 06-15-2004, 05:01 PM I am very sad for Minou and Burns, but Im not surprised. That distance is nearly insurmountable at this stage in a relationship. When its new, you need proximity for it to flourish. The whole time Ive been reading about their romance, Ive been cringing at what I could only see as inevitable. As lovely and special as their romance is, they just couldnt to the next level with all that distance between them. One of them would have had to move immediately, and that just didnt seem possible. It is so heartbreaking. Seriously, I felt a little wrenching tug in my chest when I read Minous short post. If only things could have been different for them.

If they still want it to work, one of them has to move. This kind of thing takes physical closeness. Even in the best of worlds, it doesnt work, but this kind of distance is about as far from the best of worlds as I can imagine (providing the two actually like each other). I hope neither will suffer for too long and eventually find lifes love.

My life must be disgustingly boring to read in comparison. BSBG and I have been together just about 10 years and weve had one fight in that time. We are disgustingly in love and happy just to be with each other. Snooze, right? Maybe, but I wouldnt change it for anything.

Just found out I am invited to dinner w/some local Sun folks. Now BSBG doesnt have to feed me tonight. Usually when this happens, he gets himself some fish since Im a non-seafood eater. Hopefully this meeting will be productive. It will be nice to get a tiny preview before I am to go to Colorado next week to meet more Sun people. I sure hope that trip goes well. It will be my first time flying since September 11th. Ive had my share of airport snafus before that and it totally makes me insane. Its almost worse than being stuck in traffic the helpless feeling of being trapped. It makes me come unglued. I swear its the only thing that does. But Im hopeful things will be smooth.

Airport horror story; I was flying home from a couple of days in Texas. Of course the plane goes through OHare and stops for a while. Storm hits and everything is stopped. We at the terminal were all missing the same flight and we sort of became friends chatting, playing cards or whatever. Misery loves company and what else can you do? After a few hours, I got desperate enough to eat airport food, I think it was a hot dog. To make it more bearable, I had a couple of $5 beers. Its a wonder they werent sold out. Outside, the rain was constant and the lightning lit up the grounded planes, making us feel worse.

Then at about the 8th hour of his hell, the gates opened and a bunch of people came into the terminal. All of us sad sacks perked up thinking that perhaps a plane had landed and we had a slight chance of actually getting out of that hole. A more murderous looking bunch of people I have never seen before or since. Quickly we realized that these poor bastards had been on a plane this entire time. None of us dared to make eye contact for fear of immediate, and savage, retribution. At least we had space to move and $5 beers. Those sorry souls were trapped in a hollow metal tube for god knew how long.

Suddenly all of us in the terminal felt a whole lot better about our situation.

Sometimes when Im doing something that I dont want to be doing, like chores around the house, I think about all the women in centuries past who worked like dogs a hell of a lot harder than I do. Then I think how stupid and insignificant my little amount of work actually is. And the fact that if they could do it, so can I, even if it is easy work. I have so many modern conveniences compared to some and I shouldnt bitch. Its so easy to blindly think that our suffering is the worst ever. Or that somehow we should be exempt.

Woo hoo! I just got my first candidate interview request!!! Im so excited!! I can hardly believe it. Thorn 06-17-2004, 04:48 PM Helpless females make me nuts. Some guy I work with just said that his wife called him on the way to work because her check oil light went on. Oh no! Whatever shall I do? What could that mean? Shriek. I better call someone to help me because Im too dumb to learn about anything on my own. Give me a break. Its chicks like that who give us a bad name. Checking oil isnt hard. Its easy to do and its easy to understand and its easy to remedy. Women who are afraid of that need to be slapped. Hard.

Oy. I am in a mood today. I was yesterday too. Work is stressing me out. Some other guy in the office arbitrarily wants my office and is booting me out. Like furniture. Just because he thinks moving one of his guys about 10 feet is going to somehow change things. It shouldnt bother me this much, but it does. Ive been disregarded and told to move. Not asked, not consulted, just ordered. Now I will be in the middle of a noisy recruiting floor and will constantly have to open my bag of SHHH because I spend so much time on the phone trying to build business. Its going to suck, I can tell. There is no sound dampening or privacy whatsoever out there and I really need that. My back will be to the whole rest of the crew and that just puts my nerves on edge. I can tell Im going to have to bring antacids in because the stress is going to do a number on my stomach. I am so wrapped around the axle about it that I cant even get excited about my progress.

I got another job order from a prospect yesterday. I have been doing nothing but cold-calling since I started here, and everything I have worked on so far has been as a result. I have a candidate interviewing at a client today my first one! And now another job order from a new client. It feels very gratifying to finally be producing something. I was really getting down on myself there for a while.

My friend Busted Knee called me the other day to chat about stuff and how were going to work together in the future. Then he says I gotta tell you something. Pause. How can I put this? Pause. Well, I just want to say that if things dont work out there, you have nothing to worry about. Awww. What a sweetie. Isnt he the best? Hes still my work husband. Hed hire me in a minute if I wanted to leave here. He said that we have to keep looking out for each other. Hes right. Were old friends.

My birthday is Saturday and were going to an exotic car show and then into Boston to pick up a case of wine. I dont know if he has anything else up his sleeve. I have been hinting for a bauble and hopefully BSBG got it. He has done very well in the jewelry department. He knows my style and thats the most important thing. This past Christmas was the first time he hasnt bought me jewelry; I got the iPod instead which I use daily and really love. But I get all girly over jewelry. Its my one feminine weakness. Take me to a jewelry store and I turn into a big girl.

The guy who wants to boot me out of my space is also a colossal pig. Always commenting on the hotness factor of any female he sees. He acts like hes 20 instead of 40. Why is it that men think they rate hot women when they themselves are homely, fat or downright fugly? WTF? Theres a guy at the gym that is always scanning to see who is watching him work out. Hes fat and hairy, wears gross sweats and has terrible form. If he moves to a station near me, its all I can do not to move far away. Hes gross but yet thinks hes a god. Its like the opposite of anorexia. Those people think they are fat when they look like concentration camp victims, and these guys think theyve got the body of Brad Pitt when they resemble The Michelin Man. Again I say, WTF? Thorn 06-26-2004, 07:11 PM So I got back from my Colorado trip. On the whole, it was basically a waste of time. Half of the people we were supposed to meet with couldnt make it because of a last-minute meeting they had to attend in California. What we said and did with the other two could have been accomplished on the phone. We spent a total of an hour and a half with these people. What a waste.

But, I did manage to get up to Estes Park and snag some beer. When we were on vacation in CO years ago, we went to the Estes Park brewery and had some of their Raspberry Wheat. It sounds gross, like that Cranberry Lambic crap that Sam Adams makes you take when you buy the sampler pack, but its not. Cranberry Lambic is gross, Raspberry Wheat is heaven. So I wanted some of that to smuggle back home, but they didnt have any in bottles and so I bought some Honey Wheat (called Stinger) instead. Its almost as good. But the RW has sentimental memories attached, so I would have rather got that. I could have tried to find a grocery or liquor store, but that would have meant extra running around that I didnt have time to do. And I probably would have gotten lost.

So on Thursday I went to the Denver Botanic Gardens. Gorgeous. I can only imagine what its like in high summer. I had my OM3 with me and totally had to meter in my head because I took the batteries out (they have this weird habit of draining even while the camera is not in use) and forgot that I had. So when the meter didnt come on, I had to try to remember the sunny 16 rule and meter in my head. Something I havent done since I was about 19 and taking a photography class. Being that all my cameras are manual, I have to do a bit of metering in my head anyway, but thats usually with a baseline reading to work from. And I use the spot meter in the OM3 a lot as well. But this time it was all me and Im a bit nervous to see the slides.

Oh and speaking of slides, I took a couple of rolls into a local shop (not a pro shop so I probably get what I deserve) and asked if they did K-12 processing (Kodachrome). The girl said yes so I hand over both rolls (one E6 process and one K-12). When I come in, theres only one roll processed (the E6). I ask about the other and the woman says they cant do Kodachrome. She actually has to check her list because she didnt know what K-12 was. So my film went out to the lab. That part doesnt bother me, but if they ran it through an E6 machine it will destroy the film. I only hope that whoever takes the film out of the envelopes and mounts them on the plastic things was paying attention and noticed the film canister was RED AND YELLOW and said K-12 PROCESS ONLY on it. I will be incensed if they ruin my film.

Anyway, as soon as I got back to work, Mr. Asshole has to start dogging me about moving my stuff. Cant your giant ego wait while I get settled and caught up? What a prick. I hate his guts. Then he pretends to be all nice and cheery and asking us if we want some dry erase boards. Fuck you. You took my office you ass and now you want me to be all nice to you while Im sitting in the worst possible spot on the floor? What a prick. Now my plant has no window. Fucker. Im so stressed now. I cant stand my position on the floor and I will not have a single comfortable, relaxed moment at work ever again. If my stomach starts up again Im going to have to quit. I cant take a hostile work environment and the number it does on me. And of course my co worker wouldnt let me take the corner because he has more time at the company than me and no one seems to think my well-being of any consideration because Im new. Yah Im whining, but this is the only place I can whine about it. Im so pissed.

Just started seriously looking at accommodations for our Utah trip. Found one really beautiful 4-star inn but its kind of out of the way. Still, for a room with a second floor room that opens into a private balcony with a hot tub Ill drive. We made the plane reservations first class baby! Woo hoo! No car or hotel yet, but that will be next. BSBG has found us great hotels in the past, so I leave that to him. And he says that whenever he rents a car, he gets a reasonable one and then lets them talk him into an upgrade at the counter for short money. Whatever. Just before the trip well head up to the Harry&amp;David outlet and get some premium snacks. We did that for two other road trips and it just makes it that much more special. We have little gourmet picnic lunches during the day - its cool.

Reading about Minous heartbreak makes me remember my own and cherish what I have now. When the Leech and I broke up (both times), I was devastated. I wanted to die. I thought my whole world was at an end. That I would never love again. That there was no one out there who could understand me or want me if they did. It hurt so much it was physical. My chest felt like it would burst with agony.

After that initial agony, I was hardened. Listen to the words to I am a Rock, I am an Island by Simon&amp;Garfunkel. Thats how I felt. Alone and defensive and armored. No one would hurt me again. I wouldnt let myself be that vulnerable again. I was resolved. It was a phase. As soon as I met BSBG, all my careful planning went out the window. I put myself into his hands and hoped that I made a wise choice. I did. Hes in the kitchen right now making dinner. I am thankful every day that I have him and that hes so perfect for me. His arms are strong, his chest is warm and his shoulders are broad, makes even a big, macho chick like me feel safe and small. I am thankful for it every day. I dont know how we clicked, but Im thankful we did. Hes my One.

If I hadnt let myself love again, I wouldnt have this. To love someone and be loved is to become vulnerable. Its a risky position for those who have been wrecked by love in the past, but it is the only way. Also, I needed to love myself before I could accept anyone else doing so. Now I think everyone who doesnt love me is nuts. Whats not to love? Im great. A person would have to be crazy not to love me. That realization took ages, but its here to stay. And Minou (if you read this) a guy would have to be nuts not to love you too, and do whatever it takes to be with you. Burns may or may not be the one, but you have grown and learned and are a better person for having that love in your life. So is he. Your pain will mellow (as you know it does) and you will go on. Your ability love is too big to be confined to just your own heart. Dont tear yourself down, I can tell you dont mean it. Thorn 06-27-2004, 09:58 AM I have finished the book Wicked and it was better than expected. The author turns the whole conception of Oz on its head. At least the movie version, the only version I know. He introduces a political structure that is intense and ugly (wholesale extermination and concentration camp-like places), and a class system that keeps people (and animals) in their places. Also, the characters are more adult-like than the child-like ones we were first introduced to. The Munchkinlanders (not all are small) are largely a sedentary and superstitious lot and are prone to violence. The Wizard is not the kind and slightly bumbling man we meet in the movie. Here he is a conniving tyrant with a cruel streak a mile-wide.

The Wicked Witch of the West is the one who comes alive the most. We meet Elphaba at her birth, which is surrounded by strange portents and happenings. Then her childhood which is difficult but not unhappy. We see her in school with the roommate who despises her only later to find in her a good friend. Later, she has a love affair with a fellow student. Yeah the WWW in a love affair! Then tragedy strikes (the first of many) and she runs. Its really wonderful. I recommend it.

Airports really suck, dont they? Theyve always been a source of stress for me. Too many people. Weird smells. Rushing around. Unfamiliar territory. Lugging bags. Confusion. Not all at once, but I at least have a few of these every time I go to an airport. The flight from Denver to Chicago was delayed on the ground in Denver, so we got in 30 minutes before my next flight was due to take off. Were taxiing down the concourse and I watch the gate numbers B28, B19, B12 OMG hes getting further and further down the concourse. As fate would have it, the flight home was leaving out of gate C30 something. Well, I could still make it from B9 which is where we ended up. We park and those who can, stand up, me included. Then the door wont open. I shit you not, it was stuck. The attendant kept telling someone at the other end of the phone to disarm doors for arrival. The door still didnt open. Seriously, I was in an exit row and was tempted to open that stupid door and have the safety slide inflate so I could get off that stupid plane! Finally after another 4-5 minutes the door opened. Now it was 15 minutes before the flight was to leave. I had to run. I ran all the way to the gate just in time to get in what was left of the line to board. I was lucky. Others missed their connections entirely. That would have really sucked.

As a matter of fact, I had a dark desire to open the exit door during the flight. Just to see what would happen. To make something happen. Something catastrophic that would not go unnoticed. To destroy. I get these tiny, pitch black thoughts fairly often. Like when I&apos;m speeding down the highway I sometimes think of the terrific crash I could bring with just the flick of the steering wheel. Head on. Into oncoming traffic. The pain and misery I could inflict would be on a massive scale. Just by opening this door. Or when I&apos;m in a tall building I could go to the roof and jump off. The freefall. What thoughts would be my last? Of course I never do these things and the urge really isn&apos;t strong at all, but the thought is there. The kernel of destruction. The seed that exists in all of us.

****************************************************************************************** **************************************************

Friday night we met our BMW car mechanic to give him the FLC so he could fix the AC. He put the new AC in last year but it never worked so now he has to fix it. He is an excellent BMW mechanic (this is the first thing weve had done that wasnt perfect). People come from hundreds of miles away just to have him work on their car. Hes done all the mods on my M3. Once when we were at his shop, he asks us to come out back and see something. He had 3 M1s. Three. It was cool. One guy put his on a flatbed from a few states away. So this time our loaner is a ratty 1988 Audi 90, which is actually his personal ride of the moment. We almost got Mary Chapins old 2002 but it needs brake work so we didnt get it. That would have been cool. I havent driven a 2002 in a million years.

The funny thing is, the Audi 90 was the competition for the FLC (an 88 325ix). Both are small cars with four-wheel drive. Both are now 16 years old and while the ix is worth $10K, the Audi can only manage about $1500 bucks. The Audi outsold the Bimmer many times over though, and BMW stopped making the ix after only 4 years. Less than 1000 of the 88s were sold in the US. Price was the issue. But now, the little Bimmer is a collectible while the Audi is a beater.

Our mechanic was also bringing a car to a customer and getting the loaner back. The customers car was a black M6 completely upgraded and gorgeous. I very nearly needed a drool cup. I lust after M6es like nothing else. Sure, theyre heavy beasts and completely impractical but theyre sooooo cool. Long and low and mean looking up front, with huge tires and a hood you could land a plane on. Someday I will have one. I was so jealous of the one that was there. I coveted. BSBG wants an older M5, but I want the M6. Oh boy. Theres a guy who brings his to the track pretty often and its so sweet. A sled, but sweet. Someday.

Freakin-A, I slip into car stuff easily dont I? Sorry if youre sick of it, but its who I am. Im a car snob. The rental in Denver was enough to make me weep. I wont mention what it was, but the brakes, handling, acceleration and overall fit and finish of my 16-year-old BMW are far superior. The tires had no grip and it was truly scary to get it up to highway speeds. And if you turned down the sun visor, it hit the rear view mirror and blocked about an inch of it. WTF? Who designed this thing, Stevie Wonder? Oh may I always own BMWs. They are so over-engineered that it brings the car to a whole new level. Ok. Im done. Back to your regularly scheduled programming.

Yesterday I watched Mary Reilly on DVD and just have to say that the John Malkovich of that era was HOT HOT HOT. The raw power of Mr. Hyde is stunning. He simmers with heat and sexual energy and violence that is barely constrained. The subtle makeup changes from Hyde to Jekyl along with Malkovichs changes in body movement and posture, really make the characters stand out from each other. At first I thought everyone must be blind not to see they were the same man, but now I see how it would be impossible to assimilate. Every time I watch it I pick up on something new like the contact lenses he wears as Jekyl that makes his eyes appear watery and weak. As Hyde his eyes are dark and piercing. The man is so riveting on screen that I almost feel like Ive cheated on BSBG whenever I watch him. I can almost ignore Julia Robertss dismal performance entirely. And the idiotic story. And the complete alienation of the book that this movies source was based on (the movie is based on a book that is based on the Stevenson classic). I think of any actor/actress out there, Id like to meet him. That voice. Hard to believe he&apos;s from Illinois. Ok, Im done now.

Anyway, I am off to a family BBQ today. Were celebrating my dads birthday, fathers day, my parents anniversary, my sister-in-laws birthday and my birthday. There will be strawberry rhubarb pie. Thorn 06-30-2004, 04:37 PM When I was a little girl I used to love to go through my mothers jewelry box. I remember opening the blue velvet lined drawers and marveling at the treasure inside. I would always wind it up to play its song. She had a mother of pearl pin shaped like a smile. And a tiny gold bracelet that was hers when she was a baby. And a locket that I loved to open and close (its a wonder the hinge didnt give out). Her mothers and fathers wedding rings. It wasnt the collection of a rich woman, but I loved it. I couldnt wait to grow up and have my own jewelry box. I do, and it has a fair collection of stuff, but its not the same as going through moms.

The other thing I was fascinated by was her button collection. My mom hand-made the majority of my clothes growing up, so she had tons of buttons. She kept them in an antique basket that belonged to her mother. It was lined with calico. I used to dump them out onto the living room floor and sort them into piles of like buttons. Sometimes she would give me a needle and thread and let me string them into long necklaces. There were some really awful glass ones that I was in love with. They were like jewels. And there were some with little flowers printed on them. And some that looked like flowers. Its such a silly thing but it made me happy.

The final thing I used to rummage through and ransack was her makeup case. She had this big purple, octagonal case made of plastic that was from Lady Finele (sp?). It was hideous and so 1960s, but it had special molded tray with spots for tubes of lipstick and hand cream and stuff like that. Under the top tray was a big open space divided into 3. Down there was the blush, eyeliner and eye shadow (sparkly blue and green of course0. She had these weird long tubes of eye shadow, too like lipstick only longer and skinnier I cant even imagine wearing the stuff, it was so waxy. She didnt let me mess around in there much since I once turned up all her lipsticks with the covers still on. One had a clear cap and you could see the lipstick all smashed into the top of it. When I was a teenager she would laughingly suggest taking revenge on my lipsticks.

So BSBG and I have been thinking about selling some of our motorcycles. We dont ride like we used to and they are gathering dust (literally!). I just registered one that I havent even ridden this year. Its pathetic. I dont know why we dont ride anymore, we just dont. We used to 8,000 - 10,000 miles a summer. Now we havent even managed 1,000 miles a summer for the past two. We used to do track days and group rides with the local BMW club. We used to go out and stay overnight here and there. We used to ride for the sake of riding or with a semi-destination in mind. I feel really conflicted about it. I mean its only stuff. Why do I feel so hesitant to sell it? Why do I feel guilty for abandoning a former passion? Its really strange. It makes no sense for me to hang onto things that I dont use. The R1150RS is only 2 years old and has like 3500 miles on it. I have 3 pieces of hard luggage for it, too. Plus a kind of ratty tank bag and various odds and ends.. I think I would cry though. But I could get about $15,000 for it and I dont owe anywhere near that much on it. I feel tormented.

I also just spied a like-new 180mm f2.8 Zuiko lens for sale at my favorite on-line photo store. Drool. That would be a seriously nice thing to have. I want it but I cant keep buying stuff like I still make six figures. But if I sold a motorcycle I could buy it. Thorn 07-05-2004, 09:39 AM So far the weekend has been pretty good. Saturday we did errands and then not much. Went on a movie buying spree (something we havent done in months) and I just have to say that House of 1000 Corpses is a better song than a movie. Dont misunderstand, I love Rob Zombie but this movie was bad. First of all, it wasnt scary. Sure it had some gross moments, and some creepy type characters but it didnt add up to scary. Secondly, it ripped off Texas Chainsaw Massacre in a big way. The psychotic hillbilly thing is so played that it has almost no potential to scare. And TCM was far more effective. Nope it wasnt scary.

Then yesterday we decided to go hiking. Since we had to drive a couple of hours to go pick up the FLC, we chose a place nearby. It was an up and back trail as opposed to a loop. We prefer a loop, but this loop was too long. It was easy going at first. Moderate grade and a reasonably well-maintained trail. Then we came to a very tall, cascading waterfall. It was absolutely stunning. I didnt think anything like that existed in this weird state. I shot Provia 100 in one camera, and Provia 400 in the other. It was good that I brought the other body because sometimes it was too dark to shoot the 100 without a tripod. I did some basic bracketing, so Im confident that at least some shots will turn out well.

After the cascades the trail became much steeper. In places there were steps made from huge rocks and the whole thing switchbacked upon itself as we ascended. At one point I remarked to BSBG that coming down was going to be a bitch. We stayed pretty close to the river/stream all during the ascent. Our goal was a big pond that was described in the article we read about this particular hike. It seemed it would never come. Then the trail leveled out somewhat and there were many wooden walkways set up over swampy parts. Many times we saw moose prints in the mud. This kind of forest is moose heaven, so I wasnt surprised. I think it was a baby with mom since there seemed to be smaller prints as well.

Finally after what seemed hours, we got to the pond. It was pretty cool. Very quiet (apart from the bullfrogs) and serene. The water was so still it was almost like glass. Many dragonflies. More moose tracks. Close to the waterline, I found a northern pitcher plant. Ive never seen one before and at first thought it was some kind of strange orchid (yes, we do have orchids this far north), but the guide told me what it really was. I got a couple of shots of it, but the clouds were uncooperative, so I dont know how well they will turn out. More moose prints.

After lunch and another dousing with bug spray, we headed back down. At a few places in the trail it was right on the edge of the drop and the whole valley was on view. Very nice, but if you fell youd break every bone in your body. As we neared the stream again, I noticed a little path leading to it. I went down and then right out into the middle of the water on the exposed part of the enormous granite ledge it was running over. It was really beautiful. Many downed trees from the ice storm a few years ago, criss-crossed over the stream like a giant, prickly game of pick up sticks. I loved it. Next to the spot where I put my pack down, we saw these tiny red plants with sticky hairs all over their rounded heads dwarf sundew another carnivorous plant. They were crammed into depressions in the rocks where moss grew and some scant soil collected. At less than 1 inch high, their prey would have to be tiny indeed.

After this, we heard the cascades and I knew the most difficult part of the decent was upon me. At first my knees just said the occasional hello and were a bit sore, but the trekking poles helped take some of the weight off them. Then disaster struck, my left knee, always the worst one, really started to seriously hurt. Sharp, hot stabs of pain whenever pressure let off and the leg straightened. So naturally I let the right knee do more of the work. Bad idea, when that one started giving me the same pain it was agony. But we were 2.5 miles from the car I had to just keep going. At that point it didnt matter what I did, it was all going to cause me the same amount of pain, so I just kept going as fast as I could manage. At a few points the tears were just streaming down my face. I let BSBG get the poles but not my pack as he offered to do so many times. Id be damned if I was going to let him carry my stuff down the mountain. I got it up there and I was going to get it down.

He wanted to stop to let me rest. Bad idea. If I stopped, I would lose it. The frustration, anger and shame would overwhelm me and I would break down completely. Plus, my knees would stiffen up and that would be worse. I had to keep going, hot shards of glass or no. We met an old woman and her cute little dog but I couldnt stop to pet it. BSBG stopped to pee, I kept going. It was endless. Every downhill section was torture. Level or semi-level ground was easier to manage, but those sections were few and far between.

Finally we arrived at the parking area. Only one more downhill section left. Sitting never felt so good. I was too tired to even feel angry at this point. I just longed to take off my boots, change my shirt and drink about a gallon of water. I think I found my limit. Keep it 5 miles or less and watch the elevation gain. Surprisingly, my knees are reasonably ok today. I can get to a standing position without pain and the stairs only elicit minor twinges. The left one sounds like its full of rice krispies though. I used capcasin cream on them last night and maybe that helped. The scenery was beautiful and the time alone without the sounds of civilization was wonderful though, so I dont entirely regret doing it. I just feel bad that I have to slow us down and limit our range. My quads dont feel a thing, and my calves are just a little stiff and sore so its not my overall fitness its my damned, screwed-up knees. Its not like I can train a little harder and beat this thing, its with me forever. I hate it but I dont know anything else. This is the way I am. It sucks though. Its limiting. I hope BSBG doesnt feel cheated. Thorn 07-09-2004, 04:27 PM Today is an I cant deal with it day at work. Im pooped. The bosses are coming out here on Monday and I hope I can find my happy face by then. Its the normal ups and downs of this kind of thing, and Im in a down. I shouldnt be, things are starting to happen, but I am just out of it. No explanation. It will pass.

Went to see George Carlin the other night. Hes lost it. Hes not funny anymore. Hes just crabby and rude. He has a reputation for shocking people and being cynical, but hes trying too hard now. Its like he thinks he has to be rude and crude to reach people these days. Maybe he does, but I didnt laugh all that much. The grumpy old man schtick is really wearing. And the place we went to was a dive. I hadnt been there in about 15 years, so I forgot how bad it is. General admission tickets (the first problem) and a late arrival (the second) do not make for a happy experience. So we wove around the drunks and lowlifes and tried to scrounge 4 chairs so we could sit together (BSBG, my bro&amp;his wife&amp;me). We parked them in a little wedge of space between the bar and the snack stand. All night this drunken nitwit behind us kept yelling stupid things and laughing 10 times louder than necessary. Oh joy.

I only went to the gym once this week. My calves and knees were just too sore, plus I wasnt sleeping great earlier in the week. Today I was too freaking tired to haul my ass out of bed at 5:something in the morning. And I just had a beer at lunch. I am heading down the road to slugville.

My iPod just spun up Because Youre Young from Scary Monsters. The scary thing is DBs heart surgery yesterday. We came freaking close to losing another great too early. I still cry when I hear cuts from The Wind, so I cant take losing another so soon. Now maybe hell consider going smoke-free. Ill bet that business with his shoulder hurting was just his heart saying hey, cut that shit out. Oh what a voice. He cant be silenced yet. There is so much more he has to do. My favorite bit is what he said about it Im so pissed off because the last ten months of this tour have been so fucking fantastic. Hes right. Oh that show was awesome. I hope he comes around again Ill be there in a heartbeat.

Company emails congratulating the birth of someones grandchild really bug me. I mean, why congratulate them? They didnt do anything. And why should the rest of us care? Oy. It s driving me nuts because everyone has to reply to all with their stupid contribution to the general smarminess. Gak.

And GovMan, if you read this. Enough with the sex. We get it. It makes me really sad when the only thing a man can value about a woman is her looks. It is so degrading. Theres nothing wrong with beauty but its shallow and it fades. By fixating on it so completely, youre basically telling the woman that shes worthless if you dont find her attractive. Theres a guy in my office like that and he makes my skin crawl. Hes no fucking prize, but he has to comment on the physical attributes of every woman he sees. Its revolting. So GMan, for me, knock it off! :p Thorn 07-12-2004, 09:16 PM This weekend was pure relaxation. Apart from my failed photography expedition and some errands, we didn&apos;t leave the house. Before it got hot on Sunday I did some major cleaning - the house was really getting messy. After that I had several hours of hammock bliss - shady spot, iPod spinning David Bowie, Bridget Jones&apos;s Diary&amp;some fresh grapes and cherries. BSBG came out and joined me. After a few hours of reading, dozing and bird watching, we got some beers and pistachios. Then did some grillin&apos; and watched an old Gene Hackman movie. Then bed, sex and sleep. Ahh...it was great.

One thing that was funny was when I was driving through this town (on my failed photography quest) and there were a whole bunch of John John supporters with placards at some intersections. They were hootin&apos; and hollerin&apos; at cars and whatnot. No biggie. When I went by I did the finger down the throat barfing move at them. It was funny. Nothing against them but I&apos;m not voting for John John.

I really need to get out and shoot more. With my all-manual camera system, if I don&apos;t keep my skills up, I take lousy pictures. And I don&apos;t want to take lousy pictures in Utah. Surprisingly, the shots I took in Denver came out pretty well. Most of them, anyway. I guess I still can meter in my head if I have to. A miracle I remembered how.

I just did a self-indulgent thing. I ordered a Zuiko 180mm f2.8 lens. These are not made any longer so this one is used (as is a lot of my gear). I dont know why I keep throwing money at this antiquated camera system of mine. I just love it. For what I just spent on this one lens alone, I could have bought a very good digital camera with a big memory card. Hmm. Its just not the same for me though. The optics of the system I use are some of the best ever made the glass in these little digitals just cant compare. Plus, I have drooled over this kind of lens for half my life now. It will make such a nice addition. And I plan to bring it to Utah. Heres what Im planning to take with:
1. OM-3 w/Winder 2
2. OM-1N
3. 24mm f2.8 lens
4. 35mm f2 lens
5. 90mm f2 lens
6. 180mm f2.8 lens
7. Slik slight-weight tripod (my old Bogen is waaaay too heavy)
8. Polarizers, film, shutter release cord, flash, cleaning stuff.

Am leaving behind the OM-G, 50mm, 135mm, 300mm and the 65-200 zoom. I used to shoot the 135 a lot. Its fast and sharp and compact. But now with the 90mm, it seems silly to bring it when its very nearly the same focal length. Plus the 90mm handles very close macro, so its more versatile. I wished I had it on the recent hike, when we found the dwarf sundew plants. I had the 135 with me instead. Oh well.

The plans for Utah are slowly coming together. I found a great little inn, but there are no rooms available (well, the kind of room I want anyway) during the time we want to stay there. So BSBG will go back online in search of alternative plans. I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll find something. It won&apos;t be as special as that little inn&apos;s rooms would have been, but it will be fine. We&apos;ve stayed at really posh places and real dives. Of course I prefer the posh, but I can live with the average too. The dives were done out of desperation and lack of choice.

I am really excited to go. I can hardly wait. BSBG is desperately trying to find us some accomodations - mostly fighting with online reservation pages. Oy vey. Thorn 07-16-2004, 01:56 PM Well yay for me! I got a contractor start yesterday. Hes going to be working with a very large university in Boston. Im so relieved that Ive finally produced something (4 months to the day of my hire date). And I had a candidate interview with another client yesterday. I dont have much hope that hell be hired, but at least its an interview. My boss was here from Tuesday to Thursday and it was nice to have it materialize while she was here. She also heard me on the phone with prospects and thought I did very well. Thats good. Now Im sure she has a better idea of my ability and my style.

The new floor position is putting me back into daily headache land. I told her that, too. She talked to each of us individually because shes nervous about more attrition. One of our recruiters just quit its the third one plus two account managers since Ive been here. When she asked me what I thought of that, I was completely up front. Yes, it gives me pause. It makes me wonder if I made the right decision (taking this job as opposed to staying in my field). She thinks its because of her recruiting model, that the recruiters who have left couldnt hack it; that the change was too much for them. That may be true, but then again it could be indicative of the fact that the model doesnt work well. As this is all new to me, I have no basis for comparison.

Other than that, and another track day coming up, nothing terribly exciting is happening. My friend Olga has given notice at her job in Washington. She hasnt emailed me since, but I suppose that means they have a close date on their house (the last I knew they had 6 offers, 2 that were $20,000 over their asking price). Considering the area they are in, Im not surprised. She was though. When they come back here, they will stay with his parents for a while (the rents are already taking care of their 2 cats and 2 dogs) and then go to Europe for about 2 weeks. Then they will turn their attention to housing and jobs. With the money they will make on the sale of the house, they can afford to do this and I think it sounds great.

Im so happy to have her close by again. Weve known each other for over 25 years. We know so much history about each other that its almost like weve live each others lives. Shes seamless in my existence. Even if we havent seen each other for months, we fall right into our usual goofiness. Its a great comfort that there is someone so constant in my life. Even though shes going to have a brat and Ill probably never see her, Im glad shes coming back.


My right knee has decided to say hello today. Weird pain pattern though. On the outside of the joint, just below the kneecap. Kind of a stretchy, bristly pain if you can even imagine that. Its annoying. It first happened while I was in the shower. If I have to have pain, Id like to have done something to deserve it other than shampoo my hair!

I blasted arms today. I can usually tell if it is tiring to shampoo after.Today I did 3 sets of 21s those will kill you all by themselves, but then I also did incline curls, cable curls (the punch yourself in the head kind), then one armed pull downs (for tris), overhead pull overs (the pull the boat into shore move), triceps pushdowns with the rope, some dips and then some concentration curls. Damn it was good.

Anyway, am hoping for good weather this weekend. Am supposed to get my new 180mm lens in today and I want to play with it! Ive been into photography for 20 years and the urge comes and goes. Sometimes Im intensely into it and other times I barely pick up a camera. Now is one of those intensely into it times I guess. I belong to photography forum on the web and we pick a project every other month or so and that helps keep us fresh. Since I havent been on the site for a while, Im picking an older project called windows. I think it will be perfect for trying out my 180. The current project is marcro though and I have what could be the worlds best macro lens in my possession, so I will probably do some close-up work too. I keep obsessively checking the UPS tracking site to see where my lens is. Im insane. Thorn 07-20-2004, 10:55 AM Woo hoo! My instructor signed me off to solo yesterday! I did 2 sessions alone in the car and all was fine.

Ok, heres how the day went we got there early enough to get garage spaces. We had a feeling it would be a scramble because the weather called for rain pretty much all day. But surprisingly, hardly anyone was there early and it was no problem.

We were both in run group 2 again and this meant we flag first (good to get it out of the way). They assign flagging stations randomly and I got pit out. Never had pit out before so it was something new. Good thing I brought wet weather gear because it rained just about the whole hour and a half and I had to stand in a nice puddle. We got a bit of a late start, what with missing flaggers and faulty radios, but then we got things rolling. I think I did a good job at pit out. You have to be aware of incoming traffic and not send cars right out into the middle of it if at all possible. You hold them and watch and then let them go. BSBG was flagging at the next turn (where they actually enter the track) and he said that it looks like they forgot to teach the newbies how to get on the track and it was kind of dangerous. Flagging overall was a bit better though.

My first run was in the rain. Its not altogether a bad thing though. It keeps you really focused. My tires had almost no grip though and it was treacherous. While flagging it was like watching the newbie run group all day long, thats how much speed was lost because of the rain. I had a couple of slips before I properly gauged the amount of traction I actually had and could adjust throttle and brake accordingly.

My instructor was good though he caught on to my biggest flaw right away and drilled me repeatedly until it started to become automatic. My neck hurts as a result from turning and craning my head to see as far ahead as possible. I wasnt doing that as well as I could have. Driving law #1 look where you want to go. Its natural that your vehicle will follow your sight and its important to look as far ahead on the track as possible. Find the braking point then move to the apex cone, sight it and move on to the track out cone, sight it and then move to the next brake point or apex cone. And so on and so forth. You never look immediately ahead of where your car is, you look a few seconds up the track. Believe me, its harder than it seems. He also taught me to use my peripheral vision more to track the apex cone, while keeping my primary vision 2 cones ahead.

Second run was in the dry (relatively) and it went quite well. My instructor had me run a different line into turn 1 and Im not sure Im all that happy with it. I think I have to mess with it more and change my braking there. When we got back to the garage, he said he was going to sign me off to go solo. Woo hoo! So on the next 2 runs I was alone. The first was relatively dry, the second rainy. I blew turn 6 once early apex- but that was it. A couple of traction issues coming out of turns 11 and 3 gotta watch the throttle but I didnt spin. Im so proud of myself for doing well on my first solo trip. Felt a bit bad that BSBG didnt get signed off at the same time. His instructor waited until the end of the last session to sign him off so he didnt get to do it yesterday. Oh well. He will next time.

Another good thing about running in the wet is the tire wear is reduced. I have probably 2-4 track days left on the set I have. My car is filthy though.

When we got home, I saw that a confirmation letter from the snooty hotel in Utah came. I opened it and noticed that we werent in the room that BSBG had told me we were. I mentioned it to him and he was crushed. It was a surprise. He got us into the room with the second floor and the private balcony with hot tub. I ruined it. Im sad that I did. BSBG is very rarely romantically overt and I spoiled the one moment he thought he could have. Im so bummed imagining how I would have felt when he showed me. Damn. I wish I could go back in time and erase that action. I think he was bummed out. But we do have the lovely room and now I really cant wait to go.

My 180mm lens arrived. Its gorgeous. And incredibly sharp. I think its going to make an excellent choice for Utah.

Saturday we drove to Rainbow Sweets Caf&amp;Bakery and it was heaven. We had Greek salad, pizza and pie. Took home lots of goodies, too. Traffic is pretty steady in there, and we love it when there are newbies. They are always overwhelmed by Bill and his patter. Sometimes its hard to tell if the people are regulars or newbies, he greets everyone effusively and as if they are long lost friends. Hes been in business (handcuffed to the oven as he likes to say) for 29 years and one of the things he says to people is that he s been waiting 29 years for them to come in and that they have been delaying gratification. Hes a riot. At one point a lone woman came in and you could tell she was a bit freaked by him and the general weird atmosphere. He gave her a menu and a desert cocktail and she took forever to figure out what to have. He would look at us when she wasnt watching and roll his eyes that she was taking so long. Too funny. That man is a pastry genius. Has moved on to calling profiteroles Johnny Depp on a plate. More in vogue.

On the way back, we stopped at a little nature trail he recommended and it was really cool. About .2 miles from the road, after a steep climb, we ended up at some cliffs overlooking the valley and the lake. Someone had put up a cut-granite shelter in the shape of an octagon. Exactly why is a mystery no one would sleep there and its too close to the road to for people to get caught in weather. I took some shots but think some are going to be too hazy. It was good to work off some of the win, pizza and pie though.

I feel so bad for the Exiled Existentialist am sending good vibes to your boob! Its interesting that there are boobage wellness specialists and clinics. I never knew it was so specialized (even though I have boobage myself) and its a comfort knowing its there. I hope your recovery is speedy and your breast will soon be back to normal. Thorn 07-21-2004, 04:44 PM At the gym, in a cubby along with a large commercial refrigerator, were 4 unopened cases of beer. 2 Amstel Light and 2 Heineken. Weird.

There are more cases of really atrocious form at this gym than any other gym at which I have worked out.

On the whole, men just arent very flexible (stretchy wise).

Only the truly handsome look good bald.

Companies can be very successful making money on the back of human misery.

The phrase this will put hair on your chest is weird. Esp since am girl.

Meaningless company-wide emails are a serious pain in the ass.

Men act like ninnies over poker and sports. Thorn 07-26-2004, 02:46 PM Just got back from lunch. Lately Ive been going to this little park nearby. Theres a pond and a tiny bit of parking and an even tinier bit of shade. Its nice to get away. I read for a while and then I sometimes take a quick nap. Not today though. Too much happening.

First a guy in a truck with 3 small boys came to fish. He had a cap on the truck with a little vertical door in the back. It was like a fort on wheels. The kids looked to be having fun.

Then a black camry pulled up and a man and woman got out to sit at the picnic table. They both sat on the same side of the table. Radar alert. She sat first, facing the table, he sat second and faced her. He scootched forward until she was sitting between his legs. New relationship alert! She appeared to be upset and he alternately rubbed her back, smoothed her hair and kissed her. It must have worked because they made out just about the whole time they were there. Musta been a very new romance, or possibly an illicit one. An office affair that must be kept secret, and the passionate longings that gripped them all morning simply had to find an outlet?

Then a guy in a white Taurus wagon showed up. He sat in the car for a while and I thought he was just another luncher like me. Then he got out with two SLRs with large lenses attached. With one slung over each shoulder, he walked beyond my sight. If he was after some kind of fauna photography, he would be sorely disappointed what with the 3 boys there. Eventually he reappeared and stopped for a second to talk to the couple who briefly paused in their tonsil hockey to answer him. I thought for a moment he would take their picture but he didnt. After the brief exchange, he got back into his car and drove away.

I wanted to see how the young couple would leave, if she would be all clingy or if she had collected herself, but I had to motor. Thorn 07-28-2004, 08:59 AM Have started the most interesting book. Its called Blindness by Jose Saramago. Its about a sudden plague of blindness and the societal consequences. The opening scene shows a man at a traffic light who suddenly loses his sight. The other people in traffic are at first angry that he isnt moving but then are solicitous when he keeps repeating over and over that he is blind. Eventually he gets home (predictable what happens, but still well drawn) and his wife takes him to the doctor, who goes blind himself later that day. Everyone in his waiting room also goes blind. Eventually, it is reported and the government decides to round up these newly blind people, and install them in an abandoned insane asylum.

This is for the safety of the population at large, but certainly not for the blind people. The sighted are afraid to come into contact with the newly blind, and therefore very little provision is made for them in the institution. They are only allowed to come to the gates when food is delivered (thrice daily) and if they do so at other times, they can be shot with very little warning. If someone dies inside the compound, the blind must bury them outside in the yard. All utensils and extra food must be burnt. No medicine is provided (there is an emergency that doesnt turn out well). They are left on their own to sink or swim. Those who are still able to see, but have had contact with the newly blind, are kept in another wing of the compound. If they lose their sight, they are immediately forced across to the blind wing. No time to gather ones belongings or say goodbye.

Thats where I left off last night. It is brutal. The prose is excellent and well translated from Portuguese. In a way, I cant wait to finish this book, but in another way I can hardly bear to read what must eventually come next. The strong, devious and cruel will come to power and the weak will be exploited and degraded. Its inevitable. Humanity always sorts itself out in this way when there is no ultimate authority. Eventually, according to the jacket, the asylum catches fire and the blind can escape into a now abandoned city.

Some interesting points in this book; No one has a name. No one has a physical description (why would they need them?). Dialogue is not presented in the usual sense, indented and in quotations. Specific pieces of speech are often not attributed. Its interesting and has a unique rhythm that requires you to really focus while reading. This is not a skimmer! It won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1998.

In a way, I love these kinds of books. The post-apocalyptic society is one that fascinates me. Plagues fascinate me. The social dynamic we have now is such a thin veil over our true natures. We pretend otherwise, but who are we kidding? We are a brutal and cruel species. We lie. We cheat. We steal. We are aggressive and strive for dominance. We are not far from our animal nature at any moment. I think I would do well (apart from physical problems) in that kind of society. Im pretty indifferent to a lot of human suffering, so I think Id be able to preserve myself and the things important to me. It would be hard to be that vigilant all the time though. To have no safety net or security but what I could provide (or somone I trust could provide). It would be a very hard and probably very short life. But Ill probably never know. And I&apos;m weirdly torn about that. Thorn 07-30-2004, 10:19 AM Lately Ive been feeling pretty angry and down. Some of it is PMS and some of it is the job and some of it is BSBG (he just doesnt know when I need support). Mostly its PMS and the job. This market is so soft that I am not getting anywhere and its getting to me. Yesterday I could have cried right here at my desk. I just didnt want to go on dialing for futility. Even when a couple of people answered their phones, I hung up because I just wasnt in the right frame of mind to speak to them. That made me more depressed. And then I started feeling sorry for myself. Yeah, that was productive.

Still, I dont know if I can stick it here. Companies just arent growing substantially and they dont have a lot of money. Some are still laying off workers. How in hell am I supposed to grow business with a market like this? And the one client who actually needs people is impossible to satisfy. Ive given them resumes of people that run the gamut of skill level and experience but still they dont want to take any of them. I dont know what else to do. What the fuck do they want? I cant keep doing this. I dont think it should be this difficult. Plus, the new team leader is driving me crazy. Hes an ex-army guy who still thinks hes in the army and treats everyone like they are 10 years old. A couple of times things have gotten a bit intense between us during the group meetings. People remarked on it and now I look like Im being difficult. Im not being difficult, I just object to dealing with senseless tasks and layers put into processes that dont accomplish anything, and actually slow me down.

And I recently found out that the guy who took my office is now being re-assigned and will now be here even less than he was before. Joy.

And the girl who sits next to me is obsessed with her upcoming wedding. As are all brides, I know but I hate that crap and its driving me nuts. The stupid dress, the bridesmaids dresses, the hall, the favors, the music, the photographer, the menu fuck! Do this shit on your own time. Do it somewhere I cant hear you. A year of this will seriously make me insane. The other day, she and another woman coworker were going on and on and on first thing in the morning I had to leave. I hid in the conference room and tried not to wish them ill. Great you fat sow, you got a man now get it over with quick before he changes his mind that would be my advice to her.

Yah, thats harsh but heres the deal. She moans about her weight at least 3 times a day. Yesterday, she saw a picture of herself from a few years ago and began wailing about how skinny her arms were. So yesterday what does she have for lunch? Chinese. A Styrofoam container bigger than her head. Dont cry to me about your weight when you eat enough for 3 people. Dont complain to me that youre fat when you refuse to exercise (me run? I hate running, its so hard.) Either do something about it or shut up and stay fat. You cant have it both ways. If I didnt go to the gym 5 times a week for an hour and a half, Id be fat too. If I ate massive portions of fat-laden food, Id be fat too. I recognize this fact and I have disciplined myself to avoid the middle aged woman ass and buh-bye arms.

So yeah, I really want to be here. Plus Im cramping and taking ibuprofen like its candy.

On another message board, I expressed the view that maybe not all diseases need to be cured. That opened a shitstorm I can tell you. My point (which was lost on everyone) is that we are now the only species that doesnt follow the law of nature, which is the survival of the fittest. I know Ive gone into this before, but my views are the same. We are weakening the genetic makeup of humanity every time we produce another defective baby. This includes me and most of my family. Were not good examples of humanity.

Case in point, my dad just had his second cornea transplant surgery the other day. Now he has 2 cadaver replacements that will last approximately 10 years. He was in a lot more pain with this one than the first one though, and that sucked. Hes on better drugs now and can open that eye. Its still cloudy but will clear as the swelling reduces and the cornea begins to heal. The earliest symptom of the disease has begun to show up for me, so Im pretty sure this surgery is in my future. Not exactly what I need right now. So Ive gotten some lubricating ointment to put in my eyes at night (they are so dry in the morning that it literally feels like I have sandpaper in there). Dad says that using it can prolong my own corneas and postpone the need for transplants. It only helps a little so I might have to try some thing else though.

Anyway, it will probably be too muggy to do much at all this weekend except stay inside with the air conditioning on. This is ok with me since I just got some slides back and most of them sucked. Some were ok, but weirdly those were mostly the ones from Denver where I had to meter in my head. The most disappointing ones are of the waterfall that I hiked in misery down from. I was hoping they would be better. It makes me feel so stupid because Ive been taking pictures long enough so that I should know better.

Last weekend we went to a point on the bay and walked around looking at stuff. It was a nice walk (no stress on joints) and a really pretty area. I shot the 180 for the first time boy that is one sharp lens. We saw herons and a red-tailed hawk (too far away for good photos) and more poison ivy than Ive ever seen before. We literally had to step over fronds of it in the path. Paranoia just about did us in. Had we known we would have worn long pants. As a precaution, we immediately took showers upon arriving home. No symptoms yet, so I dont think we touched any. Ive never had poison ivy and I&apos;m not exactly yearning for the experience.

BSBGs parents 60th anniversary party went really well. His mom cried and couldnt make her little speech. My nephew in law flew in from Philly and brought his girlfriend I was so glad they are still together. Everyone that came knew them but not necessarily each other so it was an interesting mix. My parents came and sat with us and some other folks. Mom said she liked the other couple at the table (some convoluted relative of my father in laws) so they werent too tortured. My family thing is next weekend, so plenty of time to work that in!

Anyway, I guess I better do some actual work sometime today. Hopefully things dont get so bad that I have to listen to Reservoir Dogs again. Thorn 08-03-2004, 11:09 AM Last night I watched a program about osteogenesis imperfecta. The disease the bad guy in Unbreakable had. Well, apparently he had a really mild form of it because they showed a few people who had really bad cases and it was painful to watch. Whenever I watch a show like this I think how lucky I am not to have anything more serious than spina bifida occulta, asthma and fuchs dystrophy. While a pain in the ass, none of these things keeps me from doing what I want. None keep me in a wheelchair. None keep me in constant pain. None keep me down. I will try to remember that the next time one of them acts up.

If theres one thing I know I have though, its dense bones. I have been a serious milk drinker since childhood and although I have cut back now, I supplement. Also, the weight training considerably promotes bone density. My mom has neither been a milk drinker nor a weight lifter and she now has a mild case of osteoporosis. She has joined Curves and is taking supplements, so at least she wont lose much more but the damage is done.

I have only broken a bone once in my life. It sucked. I was about 14 and hit a rock while roller skating and down I went. I distinctly remember sitting on the pavement kind of dazed. As I got up I thought everything was ok. Then I looked at my left arm. It looked like someone had built a step out of it. Both the radius and the ulna broke just where your watch strap goes and the short ends were stacked on top of the long ends. I freaked. Only then did the pain actually materialize (can anyone say psychosomatic?)

We had to wait in the hospital for hours. Literally hours. I dont know what else was going on (huge car crash? Shooting? Stabbing?) that took precedence, but they ignored me for too long. When someone finally came to look at me, I was past shock and almost comatose. Of course they had to touch it and that made me scream. So they shot me up with a local pain killer and we waited. The doctor touched my arm. I screamed. They tried a different anesthesia and we waited again. The doctor touched my arm. I screamed. The tried yet a third medication and we waited some more. The doctor touched my arm. I screamed. This was the point where they gave up. They told my mom she would have to step outside so that they could strap me down and set my arm. Awake. Without anesthesia. Joy.

It was the worst pain ever. I was lucky that the break was clean and no surgery was required, but at least then I would have been unconscious. Even all my dental work was less torturous than the bone setting. And the weird thing is, Novocain works on me. Why didnt they shoot me up with that? It would have been something at any rate.

My car&apos;s check engine light came on. Hopefully it&apos;s not serious. No symptoms to speak of, just the stupid light. Am irritated and have to take it for a diagnostic later on today. They plug it into a computer and it spits out a code that they look up the meaning of. *Edit* It is a camshaft sensor. No biggie. Having it fixed on Monday.

On the job front, another old-timer has given notice. WTF? I dont know what to make of all this. Im told its the money and the model change. They cant cope with the changes and want more money. Apparently what they want is out there so they leave. Still, it makes me a little nervous. Back to the did I make the right decision question. In my gut, I think I did. And I really need to give this more of a chance. A year is a legitimate try for me. If things are still at a standstill in April, then Ill have to reevaluate. Im told that his business will come to me, which will be helpful but its not the same as doing it myself. Much of what he has he inherited anyway so I dont feel like Im taking the leavings of a superstar, but its weird. In addition to that, Im taking his spot on the floor. Its a bit more sheltered and private and I wont feel like fish in a bowl quite as much as I do now. My boss is worried and gave me a preemptive talk me down from the ledge call. I will give this a chance. I need to in order to maintain my self-respect. If I dont I will always wonder.

More news happening instantaneously the big asshole in this office has also given notice. OMG. What the hell is happening? Is the boat sinking and Im just too stupid to know any better? I really dont want to look for a new job. *Edit* After careful consideration, I&apos;m not shedding any tears over this.

And I just found out that my oldest sister in law (BSBGs oldest sister) has a tumor on her neck that needs to be removed. Not sure if its malignant or benign but she needs surgery. This totally sucks. She must be so scared. Luckily her mom is up here and can be of support to her, and her daughter is on break from college so she will help, too. I hope its not cancer. Please let it not be cancer. I seriously am going to cry now. Thorn 08-06-2004, 02:28 PM All this wedding talk is making me want to throw up. Some part of the computer system is down so 5 people are sitting in the middle of the office talking about fucking cakes and halls and flowers and DJs. I dont know how Im going to stand this for the next 9 months. Then shell probably get knocked up and Ill have to listen to that. OMG! This sucks so bad. Sorry Bambookie, but I really have no stomach for this stuff. It makes me crazy. I know its important to the bride but to me it just makes me want to scream. How is this for hypocritical shes getting married in a church that she only joined to get married in it. What is wrong with people?

OMG, she just brought in the most hideously tacky collection of fake flowers to fashion into bouquets for herself and her bridesmaids. They are truly horrendous. Gak!

I have my girly moments too like right now my fingernails are immensely long and painted a purpley color. I havent done my nails in years. Years. But now I just feel like it and dug out all my nail stuff (theres a ton because I used to have nail polish on all the time when I was younger). I think this is my most girly moment. Except for when BSBG gives me jewelry.&lt;eyeroll&gt;

So Im all moved over into my corner spot. Its not my old office but its better than being in the middle of the floor. No headache yesterday for the first time in days. And I can play my iPod a bit louder than usual. I heard that a manager is going to handle the departing sales guys territory until a replacement can be hired. That makes me angry. If they are going to give a whole working (and paying) territory to a total newbie, I will pitch a fit. I got nothing. Youd think if they wanted it managed they would give it to me now rather than having someone half-heartedly keep track of things. I dont want to appear greedy, but this really does irk me.

And it doesnt make good business sense. Continuity is going to be key. We cant drop the ball and get out of contact with people. As a company we cant let things get fallow. And if clients have to talk first to the AM, then a manager and then another AM, it can be more disruptive than if the manager step is skipped and they just move to a new AM. Strange. The president is going to be out here next week and I think I will bring this up with her. Plus theres a bunch of business thats going to go by the wayside when Mr. Ego leaves. Maybe they want me to be involved with that somehow. Doubtful though, since if they did I presume they would want me to work with Mr. Ego before he leaves. Who knows?

Am in a better frame of mind these days. I told you it was mostly PMS. When I was younger, I never had PMS. Only in the last say, five years, has it reared its ugly head. Very strange. You guys dont know how lucky you are to have your hormones in a steady state. Us chicks are always in a state of flux. It seems the older I get, the more extreme my hormone swings get. I can only dread menopause; what will it be like to have a near absence of hormones? Will the lack make me crazier or calmer? My mom is still on hormone replacement therapy despite the new studies that say its bad for you. She is willing to take the risk for now. She doesnt want to become a dried up, wizened old thing just yet. Its amazing how quickly women diminish after our hormones shut off. Thats what I dread the most. That I will be less strong, less flexible, less active and less alert than I am now. Ick. I may opt for the hormone thing too. Unless of course the women on it now all drop dead or grow another leg or something.

One of the men from a firm my husband works closely with is retiring. Hes about 55 and is just done with it. The aggravation got to him and he just cant stand to think about another 10 years. He and his wife are moving to the Keys. They are both certified and experienced divers so theyre toying with the idea of opening a dive shop and teaching. Wow. I am impressed and somewhat jealous. I hope that BSBG and I are in such a position 20 years from now. I wish them all the best and hope they succeed. BSBG is bummed because there will be no one good for him to work with at this company. One of the technical guys left a few months ago, the other just gave his notice and the sales manager is a scumbag. Joy. He has to work with this company because no one else makes the substance he needs for his companys product. Oh well. But I am a bit envious of the retiring couple. In 20 years that would be so nice to do.

Also gotta chime in about the sexy older guy thing. They just dont make men the way they used to. I think Ive lamented this in my journal before. Give me Sean Connery (of similar age) over BenAffleck any day! Seriously, the boys they have now are just that boys. They are not men. They are too pretty and too surgically enhanced to possibly compete with the likes of Tom Selleck and Jeff Bridges.

BSBG is 40, I am 36 and totally into the horny all the time phase. Even while having my period, I want sex. I didnt think I could get worse than I was in my 20s, but Im worse. Or better depending on how you look at it. BSBG has no trouble keeping up. I didnt know him when he was in his 20s, so I cant compare his sex drive from then to now. All I know is, when Im ready, hes ready. The thing about it is, these days, I dont need long, drawn out sessions the way I used to. Now Im happy and satisfied in a much shorter period of time (say an hour) and so we can still get a good nights sleep. Thats the best of both worlds for me. Sex and sleep. Joy!

Also, I find that I dont need the immense variety that I used to, either. I think its because I have more of a hair trigger (oh lord that was bad) than I used to. Somehow it makes me think Im more male than female in my response to sexual stimulus. Or that somehow I have become more man-like in this response. I used to need the flowers and the candles and the big build up. Now its more direct if we do this, then this, then WOW. I think its hormones changing on me (oy were back to that!).

Anyway, this is making me too {ahem} unsettled, so Im going to get my mind out of the bedroom until I get home. Thorn 08-09-2004, 04:15 PM Just got a call from one of my old managers, lets call him Humphrey Bogart because he reminds me of Bogart. I worked for him 2 companies ago and hes the one who had to tell me I was being laid off. We got along really well and I liked him as a person and as a manager. I think it upset him more that I was being laid off. He got my number from Busted Knee.

Anyway, hes been dying to start his own business for a long time now and has had more than one false start. Finally hes got a real start. Hes begun a corporate team building company you know where managers get their teams together to bond and get to know each other over the pool table. Or if you have a cross-functional team from work and want them to get to know each other and have your kick-off meeting off-site, youd you see him. It sounds perfect for him and I think hes really happy. I hope it works for him. He just got some nice press in a local paper about 2 weeks ago, so hopefully thats a good omen. As Im alone in the office, I didnt think anything of chatting for about hour with him.

Saw just about my whole extended family over the weekend (3 out of 9 cousins&amp;their families didnt show). It was a bit tedious but not as bad as I thought. Were a terribly stand-offish bunch and weve never been close. We just sort of separate into clans and sit around and talk. Most of my cousins are breeders, so there were a bunch of kids running around. They were pretty good most of the day (only one got sick and barfed all over). I think my mom is nutty. She complains that one of her sisters-in-law doesnt talk to her, but I didnt see mom running over to make nice either. Ugh. I refuse to get involved. The whole thing wound up at about 4:00 and we went home. I have a feeling its going to turn into a yearly thing now. About time in a way. Weve all basically lived within 50 miles of each other all our lives and the only time we see each other is at Christmas or when someone dies. We hardly know each other. Considering the trials Bambookie is going through, maybe its better this way. Hang in there girl. The burden of family is usually worth it in the end.

It looks so nice outside today but I cant go to the park for lunch-time siesta because my car is in the shop. Lord knows how Im going to get back to get it. Ill have to see if someone from the office can run me over. I hate doing that. But I dont really have much choice. I feel kind of helpless without a car.

Finished the book Blindness (I read 2-4 books at a time so sometimes it takes me a while to finish one). It was really brutal and frightening. I cant even imagine trying to live in the world without being able to see. Of course, all of society collapse and chaos ensues. All industry fails - water, electricity, transportation, manufacturing, government, sewage, medicine all are inoperable and out of reach. Food and water become paramount, but how can blind people locate food and water? Private property is a thing of the past. Names dont matter anymore. What people did for a living doesnt matter. What they look like doesnt matter. Time holds no significance what is the difference between midnight and noon to a blind person?

In one laughable scene, some criminals take charge of the food ration at the asylum where the government has interned the first blind people, and they demand all the valuables from the other inmates. For what? What purpose could a gold watch possibly serve to a blind person? Of course when this source of funds ran dry, they demanded women. The men on the other side were fed by the women being raped and sodomized. One of them had the temerity to bitch about it and he was silenced rather quickly.

It really made me think about the boundaries of humanity. I mean the things that keep us human. The nice things. The polite things. The clean things. If we all went blind, would we shit in the streets and eat garbage like the people in the book? If we all went blind, would we huddle together in a church and then scatter like frightened birds if a person mentioned something about past authority? After a day of scavenging, would we readily play musical apartments, or would we cling to the idea of a fixed home? How long would each of us remain sane? At what point would the thought of eating raw meat no longer make us retch? Rancid food?

Never before had I thought about how sight gives us our identity, both as an individual and a species. If we had evolved without sight, that would be one thing. Ive heard of theories that propose that it is because so much of our brain is devoted to sight, it caused us to evolve bipedally. The theory suggests that we stood up to be able to better see predators. After that, sight became the prominent sense by far. Without it, we would definitely not be at the top of the food chain though. That probably would have been a good thing.

Anyway, that book was heavy. Often I had to put it down for a few days because it was too much. I think at the library tonight, I will pick up some lighter fare for the brain. After I pick up my car. Tis done. The kid who drove me to work really liked my car. Whats not to like? It rocks. Recently saw some headers that are very tempting. When I replaced my exhaust, it was just cat back but headers ooh could be interesting. I cant tempt myself too much by researching it now. I must pay for my vacation (airfare bill just came) and my 180mm lens. Cant rack up too much debt. I like having new stuff but big credit card bills just make me depressed. I feel smothered by them. So a little discipline now will keep me out of trouble.

Am listening to Live Frogs Set 2 by Les Claypools Frog Brigage. Holy crap. They recreate the entire Animals cd. That is probably my favorite Pink Floyd album of all time and they do an amazing job with the material. Of course theres Les amazing bass and funky vocals (not lead) but the other musicians are just as talented and reproduce the epic note-for-note. Its cool. Also picked up Tin Machine II which wasnt released in the US. Very different from the first Tin Machine even with only 2 years in between. Also downloaded some Tony Carey from iTunes. I checked on Amazon and it was like $25 (import) so $9.90 from iTunes was a baaa-gin. Its very different from his usual soft ballad style, but I like it.

Oh and I picked up another Patrick McGrath. I love his work. This one is titled The Grotesque and I cant wait to get into it. Ive read Spider and Asylum and thought both were subtle, creepy and well done. McGrath isnt everyones cup of tea, but if you like atmospheric books with twisted characters that do strange things, give him a read. Thorn 08-12-2004, 09:18 AM Sometimes I really get exasperated with members of my sex. They drive me crazy with their mindless fears. Spiders. Bats. Frogs. Snakes. Bees. Moths. Even worms! What is with you people? My mother for example, shes afraid of moths. Moths! Could there be a more harmless creature than a moth? They dont bite. They dont sting. They are not poisonous. They do not carry the threat of disease. They are just fluttery and fuzzy. Yet, my mother will shriek like an alligator just crawled up out of the toilet whenever she sees one. Even outside. Its stupid. I love her but its stupid.

And yesterday a woman I work with was on about spiders. Of all the irrational and illogical things to be afraid of. If youre afraid of bugs, why be killing the very thing that will reduce the bug population on a daily basis? Besides, the woman is about a million times bigger than the spider whos really in danger here? Insane.

The only living thing I really have a weird reaction to are hornets and wasps. Strange since I actually will sit in the garden and pat bumblebees. Anyway, wasps and hornets give me a little jolt of fear/adrenaline whenever I see them. This doesnt transform me into a withering, screeching female though. I will calmly dispatch it or if it can be put outside, Ill do that. I think its the same reaction as other women have to bugs, but the response is much more intelligent. I dont have to go get a man to save me. Why cant other women act like this? No wonder we have such a reputation for helplessness.

I am not a wanton destroyer of small lives, either. I recently heard about a treatment for arthritis that involved controlled bee stings. Bees die when they sting. They are basically disemboweled. I dont know if I could do it. I would feel terrible. Who am I to kill a bee in such a horrific way? When I had those funny slow-walking bugs in the house over the winter, I couldnt kill them. Who am I to just decide they should die for no reason? Why should they have less of a right to exist than I do?

This is a totally strange thing for me since I am a rampant carnivore. I have never witnessed what goes on in an abattoir, but I have heard and I understand it to be a traumatic and scary place for the animals about to be slaughtered. Somehow this doesnt touch me. I dont know why I have two minds about this. I will go out of my way to rescue worms from puddles when it rains, and then go have a hamburger. I felt sad for bees killed in the pursuit of pain relief, but yet just got through eating a chicken dinner. It doesnt make sense, but there it is. We humans are just complicated muthas.

No word about BSBGs sister with the tumor. Supposedly she is going to specialists this week to determine the best course of treatment. Hopefully we hear something soon and that its not bad news.

I just gotta say that while its not great literature, the Pendergast books from Lincoln Child&amp;Lee Preston really suck you in. I am reading Still Life with Crows and I can barely put it down. It was the same when I read Relic, Reliquary&amp;The Cabinet of Curiosities. Strangely though, I tried reading a book written by one of them on his own and I couldnt stand it and put it down unfinished (life is too short to read bad books). Thorn 08-18-2004, 02:57 PM Years ago I was working for a company and we were very small; growing rapidly but small. I was in sales and worked in a big cube farm with all the other sales people. We knew all about each others clients and deals and personal lives. People who worked in a sales region together got to be especially close. Me and Pothead got pretty close. Our cubes were next to each other or across from each other no matter how many times we moved. I would answer his pages if he was on the phone and vise versa. We went to lunch often; sometimes alone, sometimes in a group. After a few months of this, people began talking about us. Apparently, we were having an affair. Sure he was a cutie, but not totally my type and I had BSBG.

This cracked us up and we would do things to encourage this rumor. I would bring him something off the printer and he would say thanks luv. He would take a message for me and I would yell smooches over the wall at him. Sometimes when caught in a restaurant booth alone together we would spring apart (even if we werent that close together) and act all guilty like.

Our respective spouses werent the least bit phased. He was a devoted husband and father to 2 girls. I had BSBG. A couple of times our respective fams would get together during a company function or similar (he was the guy who threw up after skydiving) and there was never any tension or the least bit of jealousy. Crazy. If people really knew either of us, they wouldnt have believed it or started the rumor in the first place. But you know how people love to talk.

A while later, I started really hanging with Busted Knee and it was then known that I had dumped Pothead for Busted Knee. This was before BK met the woman who would become his wife lets call her BooBoo Kitty because shes a klutz. When he did meet here, one of their first dates was to a party at a co-workers house. Everyone from the company came and brought spouses or whatever. BSBG and BooBoo Kitty got along great. BBK kept drinking and eventually started feeling up BSBG. It was pretty innocent hes a body builder and she never knew a man with muscles like that so she couldnt keep her hands off him. Busted Knee and I stranded BSBG with her and laughed ourselves silly from a distance. Never once did any feelings of jealousy or resentment come up. The rest of the company thought something else was going on. Like she was getting back at me for sleeping with BK before she met him. Insane!

Later, when we were invited to their wedding, those same people were confused at why I would be invited. Who invites their fiances ex-lovers to the wedding after all? They were even more appalled when BBK and BSBG would be deep in conversation at various parties we all attended. They got along great. Busted Knee and I got along great. We referred to each other as our Work Husband and Work Wife just as our CEO was our Work Dad. What was the problem? Eventually, people stopped assuming we had slept together, or had any romantic attachment to each other at all. We still laugh about it.

Never in a million years could I have an affair. Its just not in me. Im not a cheater. I am loyal. I am respectful. Most of all, I am in love.

I really dont understand the dynamic of cheating. I mean the trust aspect. Lets say youre having an affair with a married person. You want that person to leave their spouse and marry you. How can you trust them? If they cheat on their current spouse, what makes you safe from that? Once a cheater, always a cheater.

I also think for women to cheat with a married man, its a double slap. Its bad enough that some men treat women like dirt, but a woman facilitating that is just disgusting. Shes doing herself a disservice as well as the poor wife being cheated on. Its humiliating and degrading and ruins a persons ability to trust forever. We shouldnt do that to each other. What is the woman getting besides somebody elses unfaithful husband?

Does it make her feel powerful? That she can take a man away from another woman? Does it make her feel sexy to be so bad? What does she get? No one to spend Christmas with. No one to spend Thanksgiving with. No security. No recognition. She gets none of the benefits that go with being part of a couple. I dont understand. I want total involvement from my man. He needs to be wrapped up in me completely. No sharing. When he gets involved with me he is an active partner, not biding his time. Not thinking about his other responsibilities. Not finding excuses to be able to be with me. I dont want scraps, I want the main course.

I have no idea where this came from. I was just thinking the other day and wanted to get it out. Thorn 08-20-2004, 03:39 PM One thing that really gives me the creeps is people behaving like pigs at a banquet. It only ever happens in movies and music videos. You know what I mean; a whole load of people are gathered around a long table laden with candelabras, fruit, heaps of bread, wine, plates of meat and flowers and other junk. And then they all dig in with their hands and start tearing the bread and grabbing fistfuls of turkey legs. They throw each other fruit and the bones over their shoulders. More wine is spilled than drunk and occasionally a cat or dog or rodent will scamper down the table, weaving in between all the candles and bowls and debris created by the feast.

Ick. That really makes me cringe. Not so much now as it used to. I remember when I was a teenager and first saw the INXS video for The One Thing and it completely grossed me out. Sure Michael Hutchense was dreamy and the music was cool, but the video was fucking stomach-turning. Gak. I even squirm a little when I watch the dinner scene in The Dark Crystal and its only stupid puppets! I am so weird.

And now for something completely different; http://www.angryalien.com/
I love the bunnies! My favorite I think is Exorcist. But I love Alien, too the aliens have bunny ears! They should try to do Reservior Dogs. I think that would be great.

While Im on the subj of internet cartoons, here are two more favorites; http://www.illwillpress.com/vault.html and http://www.oddtodd.com/cartoons.html
And although Foamy disapproves of using the internet to watch internet cartoons, I wholeheartedly agree with him about the racing cars in a circle 500 times. Oy. Its the wrestling of motorsports. Give me Formula 1 any day. Michael Schummacher won again for Ferrari. His brother drives for Williams and crashed earlier, leaving team BMW in 4th place overall. The most amazing thing to me is that the Ferrari Schummacher drives had no mechanical failures for something like 50 races in a row. I cant remember what the average for the other teams was; something like 34 failures or similar. That is amazing.

Ok, ok, Ill shut up about cars already.

There are two orb-weavers living on my house. One in front and one above one of the garage doors. I feel bad for her because her web gets wrecked every day when BSBG takes the car out. Sometimes they will wreck their own webs and start fresh daily, but not always. The last few evenings Ive watched them build their webs. They are so methodical and precise. First they lay the support lines. Very strong silk that is not sticky. Then they put in the spokes, also very strong and non-sticky. Last, working from the outside in, they run the cross lines in ever tightening circles until they reach the center of the web. They do it very delicately, attaching a drop of silk from the spinnerets and then using a rear foot to pick it up and stretch it to the adjacent spoke. These are the sticky lines and even these girls have to be careful because they can get stuck in their own webs. They step only on the support lines. Its fascinating to watch and the webs are beautiful.

When it gets full dark, I sometimes get behind the webs with a flashlight and wait until dinner is attracted and gets caught. Then the real action begins she darts out from the center and throws a loop of very sticky and very strong silk to snare the bug. Then she sits back to wait. The bug will still struggle and kick and she wont risk injury by staying too close. When the bug is tired out, she moves in and wraps it up tight. Sometimes she digs in right then and there and sometimes she waits until later. After the struggle and subsequent wrapping, she will sometimes snip out the damaged part of her web and fill it in a bit, removing dinner to her larder beforehand.

In the corner of the same garage door with the orb-weaver is another kind of spider. Not an orb or a grass spider or the kind that infest my garage, it looks more like a wolf spider but I couldnt see it well enough to tell. My collection grows. I really miss the big old girl I had on the front stoop a few years ago. She was huge a different species of orb-weaver (not a garden spider, one of which I had in the garden this year but she disappeared) and she build the biggest webs. Caught a ton of bugs every night. Not all spiders build orb webs, some look like they put away a fifth of JD before embarking on web weaving. Scribbly messes but they do the job.

I love spiders. Can you tell? Thorn 08-27-2004, 09:50 AM Its been quiet lately and thats why no post.

Were leaving for Watkins Glen at the ass-crack of dawn on Sunday. Its a long drive and the one back will be worse. After the 2nd day of driving, we leave and head straight home. Well be lucky to get home by midnight. My ass is going to be so whipped that work the next day will be a joke. But I cant take another day off or Ill be screwed for the rest of the year; one more track day in October and Id like to take a day in December around Christmas. I absolutely HATE having only 2 weeks vacation. The US is so weird, we make all these advances in labor saving devices like computers and robots and such, and still work ourselves to death trying to do twice as much as before. No wonder we all have high blood pressure and have more drugs for mood elevation than for the common cold! Insane. What the hell are we doing to ourselves? Theres hardly any time to be freaking healthy or relaxed.

I do what I can the gym helps and the fact that I told my boss that 12-14 hour days are out. Im already away from my house for 12 hours a day, thats enough. She should take a look at herself. Shes got a serious heart condition for which shes had surgery and diabetes so severe she has to carry a little cooler of meds with her at all times. She hardly eats and looks to be very underweight. But yet she travels extensively, works constantly and smokes. While trying to convince me to put in longer hours, she actually said that she might lose her boyfriend because she works too much. Oh sure, that will convince me to work myself to death. Weird.

On another board there is a discussion/fight over some comments that a guy made about not being attracted to fat women. Of course, fatties and non-fatties alike gave him shit. WTF? The man cant help what gives him wood and what doesnt. Doesnt it all come down to that? But instead of letting him express his sexuality, they all accused him of being against fat people. I dont think he can help it, whether its through societal conditioning or genetic structure, fat chicks just dont get him excited.

Part of his rationale was also that hes a sponsored, competitive bicyclist and would need someone as highly athletic as he is. Generally thats going to be a thin, muscular type woman. So what? If athletics or sports are a huge part of your life, whats wrong with going after the type of person who at least superficially might be into the same things you are? If they arent after getting to know them, you move on. But what are the odds of him finding a person to match him amongst the fat women? How many of them would he have to go through before he could find someone he thought he could live with? Ill be a lot more than of the thin women. Its just the law of averages. But of course they beat him up for this statement against the logic of it. Sure there might be exceptions, but theyre bound to be few and far between. Plus then theres the whole lack of wood thing on his part, so were back where we started.

It seemed like a silly argument. None of us can help what we are attracted to physically.

My two orb-weaver girls are gone. Im so bummed. Theres a girl of a similar species in the tree out in front of my office building though. I watched her for a few minutes yesterday but its not as good as having my own private spiders. I know, Im nuts.

You girls out there have got to love yourselves!! Stop it with needless flaw obsession. Im a tallish, muscular girl with a giant nose and insane hair and I dont care that Im not a 56, 110 lb blonde wisp of a thing with blue eyes and a tiny ski jump on my face. It took me until I was about 18 to get to this place though. Yeah, Im not every mans cup of tea but I dont think Id want to be. How could I ever be sure the man loved me for me and not just my looks? What would happen when those looks faded? What would happen to me? I think that many of these girls are in for a world of hurt when they realize they have nothing holding up their self-esteem except their looks. Good looks are transitory and are a poor hook to hang your self-image on.

I like me the way I am. That doesnt mean I still dont think I could improve. I need to lose about 4% body fat (still!) and Im making an effort to do that. But if I dont, Im not going to sink into the depths of depression, shroud myself in sack-cloth and hide from the world. Life is hard enough without self-hatred on top of it. That shit gets old ladies and gentlemen.

Anywayheres to a crash-free couple of days at the Glen. Thorn 08-31-2004, 03:01 PM Misery
Guilt
Shame
Anger

Can&apos;t write more now. Thorn 09-03-2004, 06:01 PM Right now Im supposed to be at the track. Right now Im supposed to be in NY. We are supposed to be with the Audi club and driving on a great track. Instead Im home and miserable and guilt-ridden. This weekend has had the worst streak of bad luck.

First, the prescription I asked my doctor to call in on Friday wasnt called in and I had to deal with the on-call doctor to get it done. Plus, Im still paying the fucking deductible, so it was $75.

Then BSBG goes to help his crazy father cut down a tree that doesnt need cutting down. The old man is completely nuts and would do it himself if BSBG didnt come over. Out of guilt, he went. About 20 minutes later I got a call from my MIL who tells me that the tree has come down onto the telephone pole out front. The fire department had to come because it caught fire for a few minutes and rained down sparks. Poor tree. No one had any business killing it and it serves them right. So while his dad hid in the house, BSBG stayed outside with the cops, FD and eventually electric company guys who got the tree down. I really hope they send him a bill so he stops with this stupid, unnecessary tree killing. Technically I guess its BSBGs fault for cutting where dad said to cut, but we still blame dad.

But his stupidity wasnt to be the last of it. My turn would come.

As we exited one major throughway onto another, with me behind BSBG in my car. I misjudged him and thought he was going out onto the road after his stop. I checked traffic and hit the gas. Slam. Right into the back of BSBG. Another car had come out onto the road where I couldnt see. I thought he was going when he came off the brake, but he wasnt, he was inching. I managed to wreck both of our cars at the same time.

My misery hasnt left me since. A good Samaritan (and car nut) helped us out. My front airdam is destroyed and it had to be removed (with difficulty) before I could drive home. I cried just about the whole hour and trip. I ruined our weekend. I wrecked our cars. Even though we paid for it, we wouldnt be able to go to the track event. We had hotel reservations as well that wed pay for and not use, too. I was so sick at heart that I just wanted to pass out and be unconscious for a while. I am now out about $1000 just on the lost weekend alone. I wouldnt let him bear that cost and have paid him for the school and for the hotel.

He didnt even get mad. He didnt yell. He didnt call names. He didnt castigate. I almost wish he had. He did say that I should appreciate his stoicism, his lack of emotionality at a time like that though. As he said, he easily could have hit the roof 47 times in the first hour. It wouldnt have helped but it would have been understandable.

I felt (and still feel) so wretchedly unhappy and guilty and angry about it. I was happily listening to the stereo and didnt pay attention to what was happening right in front of me. I honestly thought that his getting off the brake and moving slightly was him going into the street. I didnt see the car he could see and was only checking traffic. I made an assumption and now we have two wrecked cars and Im slammed with increased insurance rates. I feel ill.

I couldnt go into work today but I will tomorrow. My car is drivable but looks bad. His is also drivable, but the trunk doesnt stay closed on its own. Talking to the insurance company was interesting. They are both going into the body shop Wed. My stupidity knows no bounds.

And as icing on the cake, Im cramping like crazy and am eating advil like crazy. Thorn 09-03-2004, 06:53 PM Ok, sorry for putting that ear cancer into your head. Get over it!

The cars are at the shop and I am fulfilling my penance. Im driving the rental. Its torture. I deserve it. This will last two weeks.

I was so miserable and feeling so bad about myself that I couldnt bring myself to tell you all what Id done. Instead I left a weird cryptic entry. The Drama Queen rising. But I did feel wretched. I didnt sleep well for two nights. I still feel guilty and stupid and hate the loathsome rental.

I have to commend the local Audi club they are going to refund us the cost of the school. They dont have to and its extremely nice and unexpected. Good thing too, we have a deductible and the FLC needs tires (dry rot).

I just went in the yard to check on my last remaining orb web weaver and found a beautiful blue jay feather in the grass. I wish I hadnt. nearby, I spotted more feathers but obviously from a different bird. I went closer and found part of a wing. The rest of the skeleton came to light with a little work with a stick. An Eastern Kingbird. Fuck. I kept the Orange Menace in for weeks just to prevent this kind of tragedy. I am so upset. It has to be the remains of a fledgling since the adults dont go on the ground (at least not that I have observed). Resolved; next year he shall stay in past the fourth of July. I know its instinct, but I wont have it. I can prevent it.

Now the yard has been invaded by grackles.

So the week started out shitty, but it ended well. I have a contractor starting a new job as soon as I can get the paperwork done. This is not an existing client, its one I found on my own. Its only for a month, but the profitability of the deal is excellent. I got the job late Thursday night, put it in the system Friday morning, got a candidate before lunch, sent it to the manager, he talked to the candidate (who is perfect) around 3:30, got an email from the manager at 4:30 saying they want to sign him up. Damn! That was excellent. We did so well and Im so proud. I know we impressed the hell out of the manager, too. Hes been looking for a consultant like this for a month and bang we get him the person he wants in just a few hours. If only they all could go like this.

For those following Deb_U_Taunts new journal (and have made it though the gauntlet of the password and all), she recently wrote something about a euphemism to use for her daughters genitalia. We all had this as a kid, so this isnt so funny. What is funny is her choice of word po-po. My mom used this exact word to describe, not my childish genitals but my brothers! I laughed when I read her story because its weirdly the same word and an almost identical use. I hope her little girl doesnt really have a po-po! :eek:

We are planning only one thing for this long weekend a hike somewhere in the mountains. Nothing too ambitious, I dont want to end up a weeping, hobbling, wreck, but something around 5 miles. He wants to try out his new pack for the first time and his boots for only the second time. I know my pack and boots are good but will use them nonetheless. Utah trip is coming fast. I am so excited. I just got in a half dozen rolls of film for the trip some Fuji Provia 100 and some Kodachrome 64. K-64 is awesome stuff and hopefully I can do it justice.

One of my recruiters and I had lunch (over a couple of Sapporos at our favorite Japanese steak house) and were talking about travel in the US. He agrees with me that people should really spend some time looking around here instead of just dismissing it and heading abroad. He lived in Montana for some time, and thats another place I want to see. The US is so huge, and so diverse that I want to see it all. Utah looks like another planet.

Anyway, I really like this guy. Hes interesting and smart and has a wry sense of humor. Hes really witty and genuine. Strangely, hes single. I feel bad about that somehow. If I were single, he would attract me. I could probably bench press him, but he would attract me. Not physically so much, but his personality. I like talking with him and he makes me laugh. I wish another woman would see what I see. He seems a little lonely.

Now dont start in on me Im not romantically attracted to him (or physically). He is becoming a friend. I like him. We get along and find many of the same things funny and agree about music a lot. Not for one second do I think he thinks of me in any way except as a friend and co-worker. Get yer minds out of the gutter you pervs! Thorn 09-06-2004, 09:44 AM Weekend is going nicely. Saturday did a whole lot of nothing (after normal errands). Just hung out in the hammock and finished two books. BSBG read magazines in the lounge chair. It was great since most of the neighborhood was gone and it was very quiet. No screaming brats, no lawn mowers, no loud music. Just peace and quiet. And the Orange Menace came to hang out a few times, too.

Yesterday we went hiking. Our first choice of trails was like freaking Disney Land too many people (with kids, ick) and mountain bikes. We should have known by the size of the parking lot. So, we bailed out of there and went up the road a bit to another trailhead. We checked the book to see what it was about an up and back kind of trail, as opposed to a loop (more interesting), but we thought it would be better despite that so we went. We found a way to make it a modified loop and Im really glad we did. On the way back it came close to the little river and then the river dropped down into this tall, canyon-like area. So we found a way down there and it was great.

Granite rocks rising on either side, the brook itself strewn with tumbled boulders. I decided that the best pictures looking upstream were to be had if I unzipped the bottom part of my pants (they convert to shorts) and waded barefoot through the stream to this rocky shoulder. Damn the water was cold, and those egg-sized rocks on the bed are hard to walk on. But I got to the other side and I think I will have some good photos from it. I am so glad I finally got a portable tripod. There would have been no way for me to get these shots without it. Even the fact that now I can no longer use my camelback and have to use a regular water bottle, I wont hike without it.

After that, we decided to go and see the cars at a stop along the Vintage BMW Marathon route. BMW sponsors the event and collectors of Vintage Bimmers drive their wonderful, old cars about 2500 miles and 13 states on the eastern seaboard. When we got there, only a few old bikes had arrived two R90s-es, and an R69S (which is a beautiful motorcycle and one I drool over every time I see one). We hung out and chatted with a few club folks we knew and some we didnt. We ate some snacks and finally at about 6:45, they started to arrive.

Oh what a feast for the eyes! Pre-war 328s. Two 507s, possibly the most stylishly beautiful BMW ever. A handful of 2002s (one, a turbo!). Some 3.0 CSIs (one meticulously restored and was my favorite) these cars to me represent what a BMW is. The details on this car are a delight and the whole thing is so perfectly crafted that I cant take my eyes off them. I would love to have one. The only cars that didnt qualify as vintage (30 years old at least) were the 4 Z1s. These were the predecessor of the Z3 and not imported to the US (DOT and other safety regulations prevented it). They looked a little dated (only 15 years old) but were definitely cool. All lined up they would have made a great picture if the light hadnt already gone.

Being at this event made my feelings towards our own FLC even more apparent. And coincidentally, Id just talked to BSBG about them on Friday night. We were trying to figure out what we should sell. Money is getting a bit stretched and we dont ride like we used to, so I was leaning towards selling some bikes. He had brought up selling the FLC before, so I wanted to head him off. I explained that I think our having and keeping the FLC is our tiny contribution to the preservation of BMW.

Unlike many of the people we met yesterday, BSBG and I are not rich. We cant afford a pre-war 328 or a 507. But we can maintain this one little 325iX. Were doing our bit to preserve a little piece of the marque we love so much. Seriously, being there last night among so many people (so many of them German) whose passion is the BMW motorcar made me feel a part of something wonderful. I got a warm little glow looking at all those cars and feeling the love and respect for them that their owners and other admirers had. Were a twisted little family, us Bimmerphiles.

We met a man and his wife (Wolfgang and Anna) who have traveled the world on his BMW motorcycles. New Zealand, Alaska, New Foundland , Europe everywhere (he even said Alaska was boring!). We met Dave who has over 100 BMW motorcycles; a collection bigger than BMWs. Another guy, John, from the deep south, has been all over doing these kinds of events and owns over 20 2002s. Now these people are hardcore. We were absolute lightweights in comparison. But we aspire.

We aspire. Thorn 09-07-2004, 11:59 AM Last year at this time, I was at my old job (hating it), dealing with the first day of a new boss and the first day of a world without Warren Zevon.

Today I have had a full year of a world without Warren Zevon, have a new job and got another contractor start today. I&apos;m sad and happy at the same time.

So the iPod is spinning WZ all day today (and I&apos;m sure to get teary when certain tracks from The Wind play).



Grab a hold, grab a hold, grab a hold of that fistful of rain.
Grab a hold, grab a hold, grab a hold of that fistful of rain. Thorn 09-09-2004, 05:26 PM Strange days. Spending less and less time with the online community that I used to be addicted to. Many of us oldtimers are gone and the newbies are just idiots. The board isnt a dedicated to a particular pursuit or topic type board, so people can post a thread about anything. Lately its been the same old drivel. Political arguments. Name calling. And not even funny name calling. Its boring. The thing is, I need the distraction during the day and I cant find a replacement. I dont really fit in with the board here, either so maybe I need a new spot for this thing as well. Mostly I have it here because its convenient and easy to use. Some of the other journals are interesting but honestly I have zero to do with improv. Ludicrous for me to keep this here and take up server space and bandwitdth. Kind of selfish, too. I think like Bambookie, I am going a-hunting.

No other news. Still driving the punishment car. Its hell.

No plans for weekend. Knowing BSBG, hell probably begin organizing for our vacation. He makes lists (in Excel no less) of his packing and arranging and such. My sister in law does the same thing. My bro and I laugh at them but also appreciate the uber-organizer skills.

Sucks to be in Florida right now. But in a really wicked way a piece of me is glad. That states whole ecosystem has been destroyed and polluted because of the masses of people who have flocked there, not to mention the hordes of tourists. I have relatives and friends who live there too, but hey they are guilty too. My weirdo father wants to move there for the winters and I really hope hes changed his mind.

Besides, I really like weather. It puts humanity in its place. Im so glad theres at least one thing that we cant control or contain or interfere with. The most we can do is stand in its path and try not to get blown away. Even when a big blow comes up this way, I feel humbled in its presence. Its like Im finally in an element where I feel simply alive again. Not as a human with an agenda and a BMW, but as a creature, a being, a simple organism. I kind of like that feeling. For short periods though, I think I would go insane if I had that frame of mind all the time. Still Florida people, duck and cover! Thorn 09-10-2004, 02:01 PM It&apos;s been a nice group here but it&apos;s time for me to go. I never did belong and have trespassed too long. One thing of value though in this experiment - I like this way of expressing myself and I like the people I have met. I&apos;ve found a new home for my bizarre musings and non-exciting tales. If you want to know where that is, drop me a pm and I&apos;ll send you the link.

I&apos;ll be checking back in to read my regulars - Minou, Govt Man, Old Lady, Sehra, MamaJen, Burns, JPuck, Gypsy, Tenth, EE and others I can&apos;t think of at this exact moment. Bookie and Deb - I already know where you goils are at. If anyone knows where Brown_Eyed_Girl went to, let me know.

And now a word from Warren Zevon -
Don&apos;t let us get sick
Don&apos;t let us get old
Don&apos;t let us get stupid, all right?
Just make us be brave
And make us play nice
And let us be together tonight

Love and Laughter,
