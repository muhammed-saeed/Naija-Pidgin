Better than a Restaurant
 How (and why) to dine in on better, cheaper, healthier versions of your favorite dishes. Article By: Ronne Freedman Whether you&apos;re watching your waistline or watching your bottom line, you might want to think twice before grabbing your favorite fast food or sitting down to a big plate of comfort food at your favorite restaurant. With a little planning and a few minutes in your kitchen, you can make your favorite foods taste better, cost less and be a lot healthier.
 Restaurant resolution 
Many Americans are cutting down on restaurant visits, especially to expensive places. 
When we do dine out these days, a lot of us look for deals — of which there are plenty. Some happen to be great (think prix-fixe menus and early-bird specials) 
while others may seem very tempting but have hidden costs (think big portions of 
fattening, inexpensive comfort food). They&apos;re sure to pack on the pounds and, in 
the long run, there is nothing cheap — or comforting — about being overweight and 
in poor health.

One great strategy: Make your favorite comfort foods in your own kitchen. Here 
are some simple, delicious and economical recipes and ideas to help you get the 
job done.

 Favorite foods 
 Fried chicken 
Besides these wonderful recipes for Oven-Fried Paprika Chicken and Chicken Fingers with 
 Ranch Dressing , here&apos;s how to make my favorite fried chicken: Starting 
 with chicken cutlets, paint on honey mustard and dip them in egg white, 
 then fresh bread crumbs (make your own with toasted bread — it&apos;s cheaper). 
 Spray a skillet generously with olive-oil cooking spray, add about 2 teaspoons 
 olive oil, heat to medium-high (pan must be hot) and add chicken. &quot;Fry&quot; 
 about 5 minutes per side. There&apos;s just enough oil to make a crust.
 
 Burgers 
Here&apos;s how to make your own with a whole lot less fat: Mix lean ground beef 
 with lean ground turkey or chicken breast to get luscious beefy flavor for 
 fewer PointsPlus ™ values. Grill or broil your patties on a preheated 
 rack or slotted broiler pan so the fat drips away from the meat. And top 
 with reduced-fat bacon and lower-fat cheeses such as Jarlsberg, shaved Parmesan 
 or queso blanco. Check out these recipes for Italian Turkey Burgers , Greek Style Cheeseburgers and Juicy Hamburgers to get you thinking.
 
 Fries 
Using everything from carrots to zucchini, we created a batch of veggie 
 fries recipes that are so good and so good for you.

If your heart&apos;s set on spuds, this recipe for smashed potatoes is not 
 to be missed.
Parboil small, unpeeled potatoes until fork tender. Place 
 dots of olive oil on a cookie sheet. Smash each potato on a spot of oil. 
 Drizzle with a little more oil on each potato and add salt (a little crushed 
 rosemary on top is great, too). Then roast the potatoes in the oven for 
 about 45 minutes. Heat leftovers in the oven the next day for extra-crispy 
 goodness.
 
 Pasta 
Keep a large selection of whole-wheat pasta and canned tomatoes in your 
 pantry and you&apos;ll never be without the makings of a delicious meal. You 
 can pay top dollar for spaghetti with tomato sauce at a restaurant or buy 
 two boxes of dried pasta and a jar of sauce for the same price or less.

If you can spare 15 minutes, you can create wonderful dishes like Italian Sausage and Pepper 
 Pasta , Pasta with Butternut 
 Squash and Sage , Spaghetti 
 with Creamy Spinach Sauce , Penne with Vodka Sauce , and Spaghetti with Turkey Meatballs to name a few.
 
 Pizza 
Don&apos;t think slices or pies — think tortillas or raw pizza dough or crust, 
 available at your grocery store or your local pizza shop. Roll it out (or 
 just push it into a rimmed cookie sheet) and top with your favorites: chopped 
 fresh mozzarella, fresh tomato and basil, or maybe low-fat pesto and crumbled 
 goat cheese. Bake in a hot oven for 10 or 15 minutes. For inspiration, have 
 a look at our Pizza Quattro 
 Stagioni and Grilled 
 Pizza with Crispy Mushrooms and Shallots .
 
 Chinese/Asian 
You only need a few kitchen basics to start: low-sodium soy sauce, rice 
 wine vinegar, mirin or honey, garlic, ginger, peanut oil and sesame seeds. 
 It also helps to know the technique of stir-frying. &quot;A Cut Above&quot; columnists 
 Mark Scarbrough and Bruce Weinstein devoted a recent column to this topic . In the meantime, if you&apos;re looking for a simple vegetable stir-fry, 
 Scarbrough and Weinstein can help:

&quot;If you really want to get basic, you can make a stir-fry from 2 cups 
 each of 2 different vegetables (broccoli florets, diced zucchini, snow peas, 
 chopped bok choy or thinly sliced cabbage) and 1/4 cup bottled Asian black 
 bean sauce,&quot; they advise. &quot;Spray the wok with nonstick spray, heat it up over high heat, 
 toss and stir the veggies for a few minutes until crisp tender and pour 
 in the bottled sauce, stirring to coat (2 servings, each with a PointsPlus value of 3).&quot;

Here are a few of our favorite Asian-influenced recipes:
 Chicken Fried Rice , Citrus Beef Stir-Fry with 
 Carrots , Miso-Glazed 
 Cod , Chicken Pad Thai , Vegetable Dumplings , Thai Coconut-Pineapple 
 Rice , Pork Lo Mein 

 

 Costs 
Not only will you get more raw ingredients for your money, they&apos;ll also be higher 
quality than what you&apos;d get at a fast-food restaurant. And although you may 
need to buy a few packaged and bottled items like soy sauce, spices and pasta 
for your recipes, these goods will keep in your pantry or fridge for a long time and be good for several meals.

Shop wisely: Take advantage of sales and stock up on staples even though you 
might not need them for today. You&apos;d be surprised what you can whip up with dried 
pasta, canned tomatoes and beans, and a few fresh items like lemons or limes, onions, 
milk, eggs and bread. The more you cook, the better your selection of staples will 
be, making it easier to cook a variety of recipes without going out to the store.
