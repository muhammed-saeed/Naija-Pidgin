Since I have no similar experience with that, I would like to find out some basic info about that. Can someone provide me with that? I will be very grateful.

 Posted: 12/26/07 - 00:57     Post subject: Hello, there. I think starting a fast food business is an excellent idea. Americans like spending money on that kind of food, so I think a person can make good money in that field. But, it won’t be easy. The competition is rough and you will have to struggle for your position. I suggest you to study market well. See who your target customers are. Also, don’t be afraid of being innovative and creative. Talk to someone who has recently started with similar business. I hope you will manage with all of that. I will keep my fingers crossed.

 Posted: 04/22/09 - 14:28     Post subject: I want to start a food business and so do some of my friends. But the problem is that a new fast food business in the market today is not as easy as some people think. Though it can be lucrative since people love fast food. But you have to think about competition like Mc Donalds and other chains. And of course other small businesses who are in this market too. I suggest anyone thinking of going into a food busijness to research the market and see how people are running their businesses. I recently bought a book from amazon called How to start and run a fish and chip shop or burger bar. As I like fish and chips and it seems that it is the only book ever written on the topic. I purchased it and has taught me a lot about a fish and chip/burger business, its very good. If you are going to start a restaurant, then another book may be more suited. If it is a small fast food business, I suggest people do some studying before entering this market.

 Posted: 04/23/09 - 08:35     Post subject: Well this is very interesting topic, I was just reading some text about fast food franchise. It seem interesting and pretty good business if you ask me.
Like Burgerinventor said the best way is to find some book on this topic.
I know a someone that has opened a really small fast food place, and he is doing fine. Not shore but I think that he has two or three employees.
If you don&apos;t have a lot of money try with something small and see how that will go and then if everything is good, expend your business.

 Posted: 07/10/09 - 04:48     Post subject: Starting a fastfood business Hi,
I read your topic and it is also a interesting topic. I think modern people are like fast food. So, decision is yours. I think at first you study your market and select a good place. Then contact some experience fast food business man and collect some advice about this business and see how people are running their businesses. Then start your fast food business. In starting period you maintain your shop neat and clean.You maintain your good drilling&apos;s with customers as well as possible and keep region able price in your fast food.

McDonald&apos;s has the clown, Wendy&apos;s has the little girl, Burger King has the King and so forth. Maybe what you could offer is fast food coupons.

 Posted: 08/12/09 - 18:40     Post subject: I read a book called Bootstrap Business a few weeks ago and I remembered your post here. The book is focused on helping people like you and me start a business from virtually nothing and make it profitable. The book was written to help new entrepreneurs start their own business. It functions as a business survival guide rather than a boring text book. The authors wrote it using their own life experiences to give you examples of how things worked and didn&apos;t work for them. After they wrote the book, they realized that there was only one way to prove their methods. So they started a company using only 5,000 dollars from their own pockets and within the first year their company became a multi-million dollar generating company. I just thought that if you were still interested in starting your own company you might want to look into it.

This names have been in the business for a while. You can also offers coupons to get people to your restaurant so that people would think that you are cheaper and better than the other brands.

Goodluck with your restaurant

You may want to consider the trend of moving towards healthier food choices. Look at it as a way to do your part towards the greater good.
