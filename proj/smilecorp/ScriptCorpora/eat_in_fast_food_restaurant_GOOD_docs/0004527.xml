 ROY C MEGARGEL &amp; MEGARGEL, TEXAS &amp;THE BIRTHPLACE OF PEPSI! NEW BERN NC 
 

 
 

 
 WELCOME 
 Corporate Timeline 

 1 898 
 1923 Caleb Bradham Invented Pepsi Cola and began growing 
 the company, bankrupt when Sugar prices dropped after WW1 

 1923 1931 Roy Megargel Bought Pepsi and 
 made a go, he moved the syrup manufacturing facilities to 
 Richmond Virginia. He began to put much of his own money into 
 the venture, but the stock market crash of 1929 proved too 
 much, he did manage to hang on 2 more years but in 1931 he was 
 bankrupt. 

  1931 1938 Charles Guth An Executive of 
 the Loft Candy Company with 138 stores, bought Pepsi because 
 he was angry that Coke refused him a discount for all his 
 stores, he built the company and became successful, however he 
 did it by using materials, money and personnel resources that 
 belonged to Loft Candies. 

  1938 1941 Walter Mack - The board of Loft 
 Candies hired Walter Mack to take on Charles Guth which he did, 
 Loft Candies was restored and in payment Mack took over Pepsi. 

 1941 1950 Walter Mack In 1941 Walter Mack 
 took the company Public. 

  1950 1959 Alfred Steele - Arriving at Pepsi 
 after defecting from an alienating position at Coca-Cola, Steele 
 immediately began a highly involved rehabilitation process at 
 the battered soft drink maker. Steele installed a more 
 autonomous management structure, instituted an extensive 
 advertising campaign that helped Pepsi grow out of its&quot;poor 
 man&apos;s cola&quot;image, and created a vending machine business for 
 Pepsi. All of these changes allowed Pepsi to gain a great deal 
 of market share, predominantly at the expense of Coca-Cola, and 
 grow income from $1.6 million in 1950 to $11.5 million in 1958. 

  **1959 1961  Emmett OConnell says one account I 
 have read. Other accounts say it was Herbert Barnet. I have 
 not found anything definitive either way yet. However, from the 
 accounts I have read it is my personal belief is that Barnet 
 became CEO when Al Steele died in 1959 and that he installed 
 Emmett OConnell as president until his death in 1961  

 **1961 1963  Herbert Barnet. Its been said 
 that while Herb continued with the daily chores of running the 
 company, he was more of a helmsman than a captain. He wasnt 
 someone accustomed to the limelight. 

  ****note**** Not much is documented during this 
 period 1959 to 1965, its possible this was on purpose as it was 
 assumed and rumored that Al Steeles widow, famed film star Joan 
 Crawford now owned and ran the company. While this was not 
 true, she did in fact have a seat on the directors board and 
 used her celebrity to promote and advertise Pepsi.

 1963 1965 Donald M Kendall (Pepsi) according 
 the book The Cola Wars Donald M Kendall ranks as Historys 
 greatest Pepsi Cola salesman.  

 1965 1986 Donald M Kendall (In 1965 
 co-founded the merger between Pepsi and Frito-Lay that emerged 
 as PepsiCo) Kendall secured PepsiCo&apos;s rapid growth through 
 effective management and diversification. During his tenure, 
 PepsiCo&apos;s Frito-Lay became the leader in salted snack foods, and 
 its Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken chains 
 gained worldwide popularity making PepsiCo the second largest 
 fast-food company in the United States. 

 1986 1996 D Wayne Calloway - Calloway is 
 credited with streamlining PepsiCo&apos;s organization, empowering 
 its employees at all levels, and generating substantial growth. 
 Under his leadership, Calloway organized PepsiCo into three 
 major business units: soft drinks, snack foods, and fast food 
 restaurant operations. By divesting of non-core businesses and 
 encouraging risk-taking throughout the organization, Calloway 
 posted phenomenal growth figures. He generated a fourfold 
 increase in revenues from $8 billion to $32 billion and grew 
 PepsiCo&apos;s market capitalization from $7 billion to $46 billion. 

 1996 2001 Roger Enrico - Enrico helped to transform PepsiCo through a 
 number of major initiatives including the spin-off of its fast 
 food restaurant chains (Tricon), the acquisition of Tropicana, 
 and the initial public offering of its bottling business. 
 Through these efforts, Enrico repositioned PepsiCo as a 
 diversified player in the snack and beverage industry, which 
 enabled it to gain significant market share and post improved 
 profitability numbers. During his tenure, Pepsi-Cola and 
 Mountain Dew were the second and third largest soda brands, 
 Aquafina was the number one bottled water, and Tropicana was a 
 leader in the juice category. 

 2001 2006 Steve Reinemund - Through constant innovation and savvy moves like 
 the $14 billion acquisition of Quaker Oats Co. Reinemund, 56, 
 has created a nimble, $27 billion food and beverage giant. Every 
 year, PepsiCo adds more than 200 product variations to its 
 global portfolio of brands that includes Frito-Lay snacks, 
 Pepsi-Cola sodas, Gatorade sports drinks, and Tropicana juice. 
 Many are aimed at wooing ethnic tastes as well as satisfying 
 health-conscious consumers. But Reinemund&apos;s greatest achievement 
 is in developing people more than products. While some rivals 
 are mired in management challenges, PepsiCo has developed one of 
 the deepest executive benches in Corporate America. Moreover, 
 the diversity of that bench has proved to be an asset in tapping 
 new markets. As Reinemund puts it:&quot;To be a leader in consumer 
 products, it&apos;s critical to have leaders who represent the 
 population we serve.&quot;He personally takes a major role in 
 mentoring and teaching staff
