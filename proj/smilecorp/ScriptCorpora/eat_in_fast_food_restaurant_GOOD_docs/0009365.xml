Re: &quot;smearing&quot;

Ah yes Kellie, I do remember the &quot;smearing&quot; tradition. The only time I
got a bit of it was I was the older one. Walking home from Chief Joseph
with a girlfriend in the dress I had made in Home Ec. and a brand new
light weight sweater a 6th grader came charging at us from his front
yard. He always was one to be a brat. He only got a bit on the back of my
neck, but my new sweater got it. My mom was none too happy and thankfully
the lipstick came out. I never did it to anyone but I know several who
they went overboard with the lipstick on. Traditions... something to look 
back on, huh?

Thank you very much for the entry and web-site for the &quot;log cabin&quot; 
in Portland. In 1953 I was lucky enough to attend the National Scout
Jamboree in California. Our group from Richland boarded a special train
in Kennewick and the first leg of the journey took us to Bonneville Dam
where we toured the facility and boarded a large rusty steel barge which
we rode down the river to Portland. On docking, we got on buses and,
complete with police escort, we were taken to the log cabin and a rose 
garden. I don&apos;t remember if they were together but I believe they were. 
Following the visit, we were escorted to our waiting train and continued 
our journey. I remembered the building but in later years was never able 
to find anyone who knew where it was so I could return. The site gave me
that opportunity; thanks for sharing.

Re: Lancasters

My recollection is that Lancasters was on the GWWay side of the Uptown 
shopping center south of Penney&apos;s. This was one of my Mother&apos;s favorite 
stores. We called it our &quot;Wish Store&quot;. Mom fell in love with a Schumann 
(German) china pattern. The china was scalloped in shape with a pretty 
pastel pink, green, yellow and cream mottled background bordered in gold. 
The focal of the design was an off center splash of flowers accented in
gold with gold leaves. Mom scrimped on groceries and saved any extra
money she could get her hands on (I hid my allowance from her too - just
Joking) to buy this china. She bought it a piece at a time over many
months, maybe even years until she acquired a complete set of this china.
Every Christmas, Birthday and Mother&apos;s Day we kids pooled our money to
buy another piece of the china. Then one day a new lamp appeared on those
glass shelves in Lancasters. Even though it was electric it was styled
after the old fashioned hurricane (oil) lamps. It was about 30 inches in
height. The bottom globe could be lighted separately from the top and 
the top globe was illumined by a 3 way light bulb. You guessed it, the
pattern and colors of the lamp were almost the same as the china pattern
except the switch and base on which the two globes sat was of ornate
brass instead of gold. This set off another scrimp and save campaign
until that lamp was finally taken home to light our home. I remember
well going with Mom to drool over the beautiful lamp and pieces of china.
Bless Mother&apos;s heart. When she went home to be with the Lord, she left
the set of china and the hurricane lamp to me. Every special dinner
occasion at our house is graced with Mom&apos;s china and the lamp has a
special place in our living room. Both are reminders of what a special
and determined Mom I had.

Re: Grandparents

I am a little late writing about having grandparents in Richland, 
so please bear with me. I am one of the lucky ones who had their
grandparents living close by. 

My dad&apos;s family had been hard hit by the depression as had most. My
grandfather Worley found work in Seattle in the early &apos;40s working for an
engineering firm. Seattle was a long way away from home when home is in
Colorado. In 1943 he had heard about a need for engineers in this place
called Hanford. He ended up working on the B Reactor. My grandmother and
their youngest daughter moved to Grandview. When duPont left after the
War and GE came in as the primary contractor, GE would not hire &quot;Pop,&quot; as
we called him.

At age 65 he was too old. Rather than retire he started Worley Surveying
and Engineering in Kennewick. In the early &apos;50s my grandmother and
grandfather moved to Kennewick. Unfortunately my grandmother died in 1955
at age 65. Much too young as we all know. However, Pop lived a long and
productive life. He died in March of 1972, two months before his 88th
birthday. He had played nine holes of golf that day, gone to the office
to sign his payroll checks and was sitting in front of the TV watching
the 5:00 news doing the crossword puzzle when he had a massive heart
attack. 

I miss both of my grandparents to this day. I realize how lucky I was 
to have them so close by. Worley Surveying and Engineering in Kennewick
exists to this day.

Hello Sandstorm, I sent an entry earlier this week using the link in the
Sandstorm; but I suspect you didn&apos;t receive it. So here it is again:

Kathy Wersen Alder (&apos;64) has moved from California to an adult foster
care home in Portland, OR. Kathy has progressive supranuclear palsy, a
horrible disease with similarities to Parkinson&apos;s disease. There is no
treatment and no cure. For more info you may go to:
http://www.psp.org/what_psp.asp

She moved to Portland to be near her sisters Becky Wersen Fletcher (&apos;65)
and Linda Wersen Hoffman (&apos;66). She would love to hear from her friends.
Kathy doesn&apos;t use e-mail. Please send light hearted cards or notes 
(think Amelie!) to: Kathy Alder [address removed for Kathy&apos;s privacy. 
Send me an email and I&apos;ll send you her address. -Maren]. Kathy has a 
wonderful sense of humor. She might not be able to reply in kind, but I 
will be sure to let you know that she received your mail. 

You may also e-mail me at the address below and I will deliver the
message. My office is close to Kathy&apos;s residence and I have lunch with
her on the days I&apos;m not traveling.

Re: Fats Domino

That is some good trivia on Fats Domino coming to the roller rink in
1957. The discussion of the bands coming to the rink in the &apos;60s has been
rehashed a few times. A fellow younger Bomber who I talk music with all
the time went recently to the Richland Roller Rink with another Bomber
who has a connection to the place. The room in the back has a wall with
lots of signatures on it from some famous or not so famous. It&apos;s a
storage room with some parts of the walls covered but some still visible
where apparently the musicians probably dressed. He took some pictures
and you could still see some of the names and some were faded. It
included the Animals, Jefferson Airplane, Them (possibly with Van
Morrison), Country Joe and the Fish, and others. A lot of names of
probable northwest or local bands. Some of those bands still tour today
and some never made it. I just remember in the mid &apos;60s I wanted to see
Paul Revere and the Raiders there and I couldn&apos;t go. I still love music
and go to concerts and buy music and now see how hard some of the old
acts toured to make it. They hit about every small town in America then.

Re: Bomber Mascot Page http://alumnisandstorm.com/Mascot.html I&apos;m not aware if you still bother to read emails concerning your
&quot;Bombers&quot; mascot page. However, I would like to inform you that the
Frederick [Oklahoma] &quot;Bombers&quot; do have a mascot and have for over 20 
years. Your remark about the Bomber Bowl, rubbed me the wrong way. If 
you would have done thorough research, you would have found out that 
the mascot is a Bomber airplane vehicle and was adopted by the school 
around 25 years ago. The Bomber &quot;Bowl&quot; you mentioned is mearly the name 
given to the Football Stadium. I am aware however of the fact your 
website hasn&apos;t been updated since 2005. Considering this, I felt you 
needed to know about our mascot.

Re: Fats Domino and other concerts

Artist signatures on the wall at the Roller Rink, thats
interesting. That wall might be worth some money.

I just got a reminder from Larry Aeschliman (&apos;60) of all the
good entertainment at the Kennewick Social Club up in the
Highlands. He mentioned Duane Eddy and the Bluewoods. I think I
remember Conway Twitty, or was that an impersonator? I also
remember being there on a few occasions but I dont remember the
names of the bands. Anyone want to throw in a memory of an early
rock&amp;roller at either place? We would love to hear about it.
Also my parents were not real impressed with the reputation of
the Social Club, I think I remember one fight between two guys
one night; but otherwise, I don&apos;t recall any problems when I was
there. Was it a bad environment for an impressionable young
mind? Of all the woes I have encountered in life I can not
associate any of them to the music or the environment of those
days. Comment from anyone?

Re: Kathy Wersen Alder(&apos;64)

was saddened to learn of Kathy&apos;s illness. I remember Kathy from
steno in Mrs. Burns&apos; class, our Senior year. she was a neat gal
and always had a smile on her face and willing to help everyone,
no matter how trivial the task seemed to be. we didn&apos;t &quot;run&quot; in
the same circles, but it is so sad to think that a devastating
illness is &quot;robbing&quot; another classmate of their independence. I
walk with a cane, and sometimes use a motorized scooter, due to
arthritis in my hip, but at least I am still able to have my
independence--can&apos;t imagine having to be &quot;robbed&quot; of so much at
our young ages. just not fair!

Re: High School Football

Well, I really know it&apos;s September. Friday night they cut from
the 9th inning of the Seattle Mariner baseball game on the radio
to the local high school football pregame report. School doesn&apos;t
even start until the 6th, but football season got into full
swing across the state last night. From what the sports&apos; guy on
the radio said on Thursday the preseason #1 in 4-A is Pasco.
Have they opened their new high school yet?

(Second comment, a few hours after my previous post.)

The local FSN station was covering the Texas game and the
sideline reporter showed viewers a couple of interesting
&quot;gadgets&quot;. One was a pill that all the players took before the
game that has some kind of sensor in it so they can monitor the
players&apos; body temperature. Another was like the &quot;cool suits&quot;
racecar drivers wear. They wear a special shirt under their
jersey that has several connections built into it. While on the
sidelines they can attach hoses to them and circulate a cooling
agent through them. It&apos;s better than having &quot;overheated&quot; ball
players where it&apos;s too hot to be playing football.

Re: Back to school in the &apos;50s!
 
Thinking back what we took with us the first week of school. Usually the
first day the teachers had a list of items for us to bring. The basic
items for grade school then was the &quot;3 ring binder&quot; with large rule
paper, ruler, pencils, pink eraser; I&apos;m sure I&apos;ve left something out. 
It was very simple then. Remember pictures of President Washington and
Lincoln in each classroom with an American flag? I can still see the
alphabet near the ceiling of each classroom. We had &quot;blackboards&quot; 
then; we saw the first green boards at Carmichael. Our Mom wrapped 
the sandwiches in wax paper with a small used jar for fruit; put into 
a brown paper bag. Now parents can buy Oscar Meyer &quot;lunchables&quot; at the 
grocery store. 

Now you see some parents taking their kids to the electronic stores for
I-pods, calculators, computers, or what ever. And that doesn&apos;t even
include their own cell phone. How things have changed.

I remember seeing Fats Domino back in the late &apos;50s or early &apos;60s, but I
always thought it was at the Social Club in Kennewick. Maybe it was at
the Roller Rink. But I do remember it being a good show.

My friends&amp;I went to a lot of dances at the Social Club&amp;we had a 
good friend, Pam Fleming, that had moved from Richland to Pasco in our
sophomore year. She introduced us to a lot of the kids from Pasco, so 
we got to know a lot of the kids that went there&amp;we had great times!! 
I think probably our greatest thrill as &quot;teeny boppers&quot; was getting to
meet the Fleetwoods of &quot;Mr. Blue&quot; fame. The girls from the group were
standing behind the bar/fountain area&amp;we started talking to them&amp;talked them into getting Dave Troxel, their male singer to come out&amp;talk to us&amp;sign autographs!! At that time, we all loved their music&amp;what a thrill that was for us. If I remember correctly they were from
Tacoma&amp;I still love their music today!! And that&apos;s my 2 cents worth.

Re: Fun

I&apos;m reminded of all the good times that had at Zip&apos;s. There was the time 
that Lew Lloyd tried to circle the food parking area that we all tooled 
when we were looking for friends. Well, not to get off the track Lew was 
(from what I&apos;ve been told) going to try and go all the way around the 
tooling area at 60 MPH. Well Arlene&apos;s Flower Shop got in the way and he 
plowed that cherry &apos;56 Ford into the side of the shop and took off, what 
a night. And the night that Ron Hansen jumped into that jacked up &apos;57 
Chev with the straight front axle. He was in one of the food take out 
parking slots and backed out. Only problem was Louie&apos;s nice yellow &apos;Vette 
was parked right behind him. I think the cracks went all the way to the 
back of the car, oh what a night. The night that everyone was looking for
Pete, that pretty much emptied Zip&apos;s when someone said they had seen him.
Great times from Richland Hi. What has happened to the things that we
had, now the kids have to go out in the desert, they can&apos;t hang out at
the drive ins. No more drive ins, no more good Zip&apos;s drive ins, A&amp;W;is gone, but I did have great times at Richland Hi. Now the school

My good friend Dave Priebe, DDS (&apos;57) sent this to me, probably
to dig me a bit on our Col-Hi Class of 1956&apos;s 50th reunion.
Anybody remember their parents or relatives saying things like
this?

Wally [Erickson (&apos;53)], you forgot your Big Chief tablet.

The Fleetwoods were from Olympia; Fleetwood was the name of the
telephone exchange back then. Too bad even the oldies stations
around here don&apos;t play late 50&apos;s or even early 60&apos;s except a few

Re: Club-40 attendance cancellation

Well, yesterday I was sitting in the Torbett McDonalds having
coffee with Bomber dads Carl Frick and Lloyd Chalcraft (a
typical day) when Bob Frick (&apos;60) joined us. Shortly afterwards,
who was to join us? Bomber dad Loris Brinkman and son George
(&apos;60) and his wife Betty Neal Brinkman (&apos;62). The boys, George
and Bob, regaled themselves with lies about their days on the
Bomber hoops teams of 1958-1960 (both were fair-dinkum players)
while the Bomber dads set out to tell their own stories.

Anyway, it came out that while George and Betty had signed up
for this year&apos;s Club-40 activities, more pressing matters
presented themselves: it is Loris&apos;s 95th birthday and he wants
to go fishing at Twin Lakes -- starting Friday -- so it is off
to Twin Lakes that Clan Brinkman goes. George and Betty send
their regrets.

Re: Kennewick Social Club

I don&apos;t know if it was called the Kennewick Social Club, but I
do remember exactly where you are talking about. What a
wonderful place. I didn&apos;t see Fats Domino, but I did see Bobby
Vee. I&apos;ve been in love ever since! (The nights have a thousand
eyes, and a thousand eyes ....) I can remember going there so
many times with my friend Carole Longston (&apos;63) and several of
her friends. It was nice of her to include me since I was the
youngest in the bunch, being a part of the Class of &apos;64. Carole
and I lived just a few houses apart; she on Harrington Road and
I lived on the lower ditch road. That was when there was Zip&apos;s
Drive Inn, the Flumes, floating down the Yakima River, and the
irrigation ditch. The Bootery was the other shoe store that had
x-rays for shoes. It was right across the alley from Robinson&apos;s,
facing GW Way. I&apos;m surprised we all don&apos;t glow in the dark.

I think one of my favorite memories is of Holly Anderson and me
floating down the Yakima River. Thinking we would not be spotted
we confiscated my little brother&apos;s 6-foot rubber dinghy, filled
it to the brim with food, extra clothes, soft drinks, mirrors,
towels, lipstick, you name it, we had it. Now this dinghy was
meant to hold one small little boy and nothing more than a 20-
pound dog. Between my house and Twin Bridges there was only one
deep spot in the Yakima and we were in it when Holly saw several
guys from our class (last names seem to me, at my rather old,
old, age to be Reynolds, Bailey, Adrian, Brown, Alberts, and
Chapman(?), if I am leaving anyone out please raise your hand).
They were standing on the road and again in the one high spot
from the road to the river. Not wanting anyone to see us without
make-up, our size 6 bathing suits since we were sooooo fat (I&apos;d
die for that suit and body today), and our messy hair, we
promptly sank the boat. Boy did we look fine then. We lost
everything except the boat and the two of us. I think we would
rather have lost the two of us.

Someone wrote in several months ago and said she thought those
of us who lived in Richland in the 50&apos;s and the 60&apos;s had all the
fun. Well, you can have fun anywhere but those of us who had the
privilege of living in Richland right after the War through the
60&apos;s did indeed live in a very special time and place. Although
we didn&apos;t realize it at the time, we lived in a town that will
never be duplicated again. It was a marvelous little city in
which to be raised. Uptown must have been one of the very first
malls -- ever. Remember the Friday night movies, the licorice
seat, and always the Spudnut Shop afterwards? When I look at
Richland now I realize that the town that I grew up in and the
town I loved is gone. It was an historic place and I wonder why
it has been bulldozed down and let go. Were the grade schools so
bad that they had to completely razed? They would have made
wonderful apartments, or condos, or places for small shops, or
many, many other things. Granted, we can build better and larger
homes today. But, for us, our alphabet homes were everything. I
thought everyone everywhere had alphabet homes. We all had good
back yards, we all had grocery stores, drug stores, and a gas
station in our neighborhood. Our Jr. High Schools carried so
many wonderful memories. Chief Jo against Carmichael. Carmichael
was the best three years of my life.

At Carmichael I had the best teacher I have ever had, including
college. Her name was Nina Johnson. She could have taught
algebra to my dog. Unfortunately, my sophomore year was the year
for geometry. My teacher might have been able to do every
geometry problem on the face of the earth, but she could not
have taught my dog to sit. The real difference between teaching
and doing. The most special thing about Richland is that if you
didn&apos;t meet someone in grade school or junior high you always
met them in high school. You got to know everyone at one time or
another. It may be Richland High now but it will always be Col-
Hi for many of us. It&apos;s too bad we had to be teenagers to go
there. I like the movie &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot; and have great
fantasies while I&apos;m watching.

To: Carol Converse Maurer (&apos;64)

I&apos;ve always called the Class of &apos;64 the &quot;Magic Class of &apos;64&quot;.
Magic is one of my favorite words. It just came from me. If I
remember correctly, I think we used it at our last reunion. The
Class of &apos;64 will always be magic. I am ever to thankful that I
was part of this incredible group of friends. I&apos;m also very glad
you met my grandfather. He was a special kind of guy. What kind
of work did your father in-law do that he would have met Pop?

My best to all,

re:back to school in the 50&apos;s

I remember taking the 3-ring binder, but I also remember the
large pencils for those in the &quot;lower&quot; elementary grades(they
were fat and had a huge eraser on the end); also remember the
&quot;Indian&quot; tablets---had a picture of an Indian chief on the
front(think we had to use these til we were in 3rd grade);
scissors that were blunt--couldn&apos;t be pointed/sharp; ruler; the
big, pink eraser; also remember when we got into junior high
and we had to have a protractor and a compass(when I first saw
that on the list, I thought they meant an actual compass, which
I couldn&apos;t figure why I&apos;d need one of those for Math
class........*grin*); first time we were allowed to buy
&quot;college-rule paper&quot;; and we were allowed to use ink pens with
the disposable cartridges--think they were made by PaperMate---
my favorite color was turquoise and we are actually allowed to
use it! *grin* also remember the pictures of Presidents
Washington and Lincoln(are they allowed to do that, now?)and
the written alphabet above the blackboard(my youngest daughter
is a second grade teacher and she has the alphabet above her
&quot;blackboards&quot;, too, but now, they are &quot;white boards&quot;--
blackboards cause too much dust--not sure which is worse, the
dust from the chalk or the smell of those markers they use for
those boards!!); also remember the chemical symbols in Science
class(they were at the top of the ceiling)---IF you were
&quot;smart&quot; enough, you&apos;d look around the room for the chemical
symbol during the tests(*grin). also remember saying the
&quot;Pledge of Allegiance&quot; each and every morning, before starting
class--we would stand at our desks, with our hands over our
hearts, and recite the pledge. I think the innercom would be
turned on, and the principal would announce that the pledge was
going to be cited. remember the &quot;PeeChee&quot; with the
multiplication tables on the inside cover? if it hadn&apos;t been
for that chart, am sure I would never have remembered my &quot;times
tables&quot;. *grin*

re:what has happened to things we had

I have fun memories from Zip&apos;s, too. also A&amp;W---we;have an
A&amp;W;here in Bakersfield, but it isn&apos;t the same----it is in
connection with another fast food restaurant---no carhops, just
a drive-through, but they STILL make the BEST rootbeer floats!
we do have a Sonic, and when they first opened, the girls came
out to your cars on rollerskates, but they don&apos;t do that
anymore----too many spills and falls, so now, they just walk to
your car with the tray and hook it onto the window---just not
the same! I miss all the things from my teen years and really
believe that my kids and grandkids are missing out on a lot, but
no way to turn back the hands of time, so just have to keep my
memories alive and bore them with all the tales of my youth!
*grin* do have &quot;one, bright spot&quot;, though----my 12-year old
granddaughter LOVES &quot;American Graffiti&quot; and &quot;Grease&quot; and wishes
she &quot;had been there, done that&quot;. *grin*

Maybe that&apos;s why I don&apos;t remember the &quot;Big Chief&quot; tablet?? I do
remember the &quot;Pee Chee&apos;s&quot; in high school. I&apos;m not sure about our
desks in grade school ... didn&apos;t they have holes in the top of
the desk for the &quot;ink bottle&quot;; or am I thinking about another
grade school earlier somewhere else? Playing tag on the &quot;monkey

&gt;&gt;From: Bill Witherup (&apos;53)

As a writer interested in the labor movement, I would like to
read entries from those who came back and worked at Hanford, in
whatever capacity, and what some of their experiences were,
either pro or con, with whichever craft union one might have
belonged to.

As most of you know who were in Richland in the early days, we
children were not privy to what our parents did at Hanford. My
first union job was during the summer of 1953 when my father got
me a job with the Laborers and Hodcarriers union (which still
exists in Pasco). Sometimes I help to teach a course in Labor
Heritage at the Laborers and Employers Training Center in
Kingston, Washington, and there are usually laborers from the
Pasco local, or from the Spokane local. The experience of having
grown up in Richland and/or Pasco and Kennewick, also included
the facts that our parents who worked at Hanford belonged to the
craft unions, unless they were in management. Thus our standard
of living was pretty good. I would guess that the children of
merchants and postal employees also had parents who earned a
decent living.

By the way, the little review in Seattle Times of AMERICAN
WORKING-CLASS LITERATURE, which includes an essay of mine,
misconstrues a little bit my relationship with my father. I
loved my father (and mother) very much as can be shown if you
were to read the obituary poem to my father in &quot;Down Wind, Down
River: New and Selected Poems&quot;, which I had with me at the 50th
reunion in 2003.

Cordially to all,

I enjoyed reading all that you said in the 9/6 Sandstorm. Soooo
very true. The 50s and 60s were such special times for us and
very unique at the time. I, too, wish that they didn&apos;t have to
tear down all the old buildings that hold so many memories to
us. Here, in Eureka, they try to save all the old homes and
commercial buildings. There was a time back 20 years ago, I
guess, that they did tear down, but the people stood up to be
heard. The City Fathers listened. I guess some cities don&apos;t
listen.

My ex-father-in-law worked for the City of Richland for many
years. That&apos;s how your dad and he knew each other I think. I
could be wrong though.

a short 8-week battle with a very aggressive form of cancer. His
last weeks were spent at home with his family and they will all

Hey there Bombers and Bomberettes ...

Looks like I will just miss the Club-40 events and the All

Berlin for some coffee Saturday AM, but might have to cancel
(dang it, Bill). I was going to head south after our visit. But
now, I&apos;ve been called to shoot video Sat, Sun, and Mon. Don&apos;t
know the time or place (somewhere in Richland) yet, but the
subject is fun. As you guys know, I sometimes shoot depositions
for the record. This time, it is a practice deposition. We&apos;ll
shoot, play back, shoot again for three days. Could be fun.

Now, we expect to head south Tuesday AM. I hope y&apos;all have a
great Club-40 and a explosive Bomber luncheon.

Meanwhile, I still struggle with a pond in the back yard that
doesn&apos;t want to hold water! Dang!! I thought this would be easy.
I mean, if Pappy Swan can have a pond by accident with elves ...
well ... I&apos;ll keep working at it.

Hope to see you in late October when I&apos;m back in town for a week
or so.

I never thought of a Big Chief tablet as being a new fangled
writin&apos; and printin&apos; do-hickey. I had assumed that they had
been around for years. Red background cover with the profile of
a Native American in feather headdress printed in black,
newsprint paper pages, wide lines. I can&apos;t remember if they had
the lines with the dotted centerline as a guide for lower case
letters. We kids in the fifties had it easy and didn&apos;t even know
it.

Speaking of such things: does anyone remember using the small
hand-held slate/blackboard things that students used to practice
writing and ciphering (two of the three &quot;R&quot;s)? I have seen them
in movies and in museums but I have no idea when they went out
of style. Were they called &quot;laptops&quot; or maybe &quot;blackberries&quot;?

&gt;&gt;From: Donna Bowers Rice (GMC &apos;63)

I have an interview Friday to go over the draft sent by ORAU
where my father&apos;s exposures to cancer were found to be less than
50% of the cause of his death for the Hanford Employee
Compensation Fund. I have done a lot of research and reading
(over 40-50 yrs. of ICRU/ICRP Journals and several Health
Physics journals) on this subject. I am by no means an expert
and I have found little if any help from labor unions, the
government, or anyone in my search. What I am struck by is the
gap between the ICRU physicists that make your measuring devices
for documenting radiation exposure and the physicists that use
their instruments to measure with. The ICRU people lament the
fact over and over again that there are not enough cancer
subjects to make sure their instruments measure correctly --
they say that no threshold should be assigned and that LNT does
not mimic the current cancer deaths of radiation.

I am watching as so many of you are turned down by the DOE for
cancer deaths here in Richland and elsewhere -- what a huge
group of statistics they are denying (better than the one time
drop of the bombs in Japan which is used as the probability
basis for the math for deaths caused by radiation AND for which
there is an ongoing reevaluation as the deaths increase over
time).

My father&apos;s cancer was skin cancer and of course the deaths in
Japan were not many due to skin cancer so they originally gave
it a 0 value multiplicand, which was later changed in the 80&apos;s
to 1, as more and more Japanese succumbed to cancer. Skin cancer
can show up 20 years after the fact. My dad died of a hangnail 7
years after he had a moderate + exposure to that thumb. A split
in his thumbnail erupted into a crusty, exudative lesion that
was found to be amelonotic melanoma (less than 5% cure rate)
which spread throughout his body to several organs and bone and
he succumbed 1 1/2 years later at age 59 to lung cancer. I don&apos;t
know too many people that have died of a hang nail. Genetically
he should have been long lived, his dad died at 78, his mom at
94, and his brother is still alive at 86. I might also tell you
he worked in an area where weapons grade plutonium was separated
and he had six over-exposures besides his regular chronic
exposure.

Using the Monte Carlo method as the basis for the math analysis
is just as it is named -- &quot;Russian Roulette&quot; -- for those that
died too early. During my reading, I found several things out:
1) dosimeters of the 50&apos;s, 60&apos;s, and 70&apos;s had a limited ability
to measure all radiation in all directions causing serious
underestimations of exposure; 2) quadratic equations are fine
for high energy exposures, but not for low level, chronic
exposures; 3) the TIME of exposure is absolutely critical (they
only caught the overages of radiation at lunch and at the end of
the day so that means if the accident happened one minute after
entering the plant that the over-exposure could have lasted for
up to 4 hours) which verifies their theory that high radiations
treatment to kill cancer does not cause cancer as that radiation
is supremely time sensitive; 4) distance is a factor they ignore
in worker radiation exposures; 5) in vivo analysis of PU239 has
been found to be suspect both because they used no trace
isotopes and because when it is deposited in fibrotic tissue it
does not clear to other tissues so you would not get high levels
in urinalysis; 7) neutron doses were not counted and caught
correctly (they use fast neutrons to kill tissue tumors at
present) and particularly in my case in the extremities neutron
dosimetry was poor -- as of 1991 a 3-level skin dosimeter was
recommended -- ours at best was 1-level and caught penetrating
radiation only and not all of those due to angulation -- the
deaths at Chernobyl taught us that one; 8) the &quot;nuclear soup&quot;
that the rods were placed in was extremely highly radioactive
and defied analysis from plant to plant as to just what
nucleotide was the most damaging (and my dad worked with this).

When you are denied compensation it is usually due to not enough
whole body radiation BUT cancer mutagenisis is on a cellular
level so why are we letting these people turn us down due to
poorly based mathematics and incomplete radiation analysis? I
would appreciate any comment prior to my call on Friday morning
and I keep wondering when the government is truly going to
stand up for its people.

For any of you who are going through this analysis for their
parents, you can no longer read the ICRU Journal online, you
have to be a physicist member, but reading through the years is
absolutely fascinating.

During a recent trip to Richland, I had the chance to do some
basement scrounging at a fellow Bomber&apos;s parent&apos;s house. (I love
basement scrounging.) One of the fun things I found were four
old dial telephones with WHitehall numbers. Hope these pictures
bring back memories of growing up in Richland.&lt; AlumniSandstorm.com/htm2006/Xtra/Any/060827-Valentine-00.html &gt;Also had to do the Spudnut shop while I was there; went for

Re: John Sams (&apos;71WB-RIP)

My dad let me know of John&apos;s passing last night. John did not
attend RHS -- rather he was a Lewis and Clark (Spokane)
graduate. We used to see him at Regionals and kidded each other
about the typical high school rivalry stuff. Although he did not
attend high school with us, he always considered himself a
Richland resident -- maybe not a Bomber -- but he was close
enough in my book. We would inevitably call him to come down to
our class reunions -- and most of the time he did -- so I
nominate John for honorary inclusion in the Bomber Fraternity.
We tried to call him on August 10th (last month) to come down to
our 35th reunion but we could not reach him. I guess now I know
why. I want his family to know that he was remembered and talked
about by those of us who knew him just weeks before his untimely
passing.

I was lucky enough to attend Christ the King with John and live
in the same neighborhood. We spent many hours (like most
Richland kids) playing basketball and dreaming of growing up to
play for Dawald. His dad built the boys (Mike, Chuck, and Dick)
a great basketball court in the backyard and it sure got a
workout through the years. One of the unique aspects of Richland
back in the 60&apos;s and 70&apos;s had to be the preponderance of GREAT
backyard courts -- most were half court or bigger and complete
with striping and great backboards. I can count five in my
extended neighborhood we played on a regular basis.

I also got to play with John on our first foray into organized
baseball -- Richland City League. We played for the Amber
Chiefs. I don&apos;t remember that we won many games but we sure had
a heck of a lot of fun. We went on to play little league
together, as well as Christ the King sports (touch football,
basketball, and baseball). I was never the athlete that John was
but we hung together anyway.

Childhood friends and memories are some of the most special we
get to have and most of my formative years (1-8th grades) were
spent with John as one of my best friends. I&apos;m not sure if any
of the Sams remember me but I DO remember all of them -- from
Mike to Patty. All of you are in my thoughts and prayers during
these difficult days. I know John is in a better place --I can&apos;t
make the memorial but I will down a Scotch or two Saturday night
in his honor.

By the way -- it was 3 years ago yesterday that we lost one of
the nicest guys Richland has ever known Big G (George Dana
(&apos;70RIP)). Hope you had a beer for him, Mike (Franco and Hogan
both (&apos;70)).

Any of my fellow CK classmates that read this -- please send me
your e-mail address, so I can keep in touch. Next year will be
our 40th year since &quot;graduation&quot; from CK. Maybe we can get
together like we did for our 25th.

I have done library research for a clinical psychologist here in
Seattle, who was formerly a cytologist, and lived down-river
from Hanford at The Dalles. His thyroid went down when he was
age 8. He knows as much about the effects of radiation on
mammalian biology as anyone. He might be able to explain to you
how such cancers as your father had, metastasize. His name is
Frederick Wayne Nelson, and his practice is here in Seattle
[contact Bill for further information -Richard]. We did
together over ten years of research on radiation effects from
Hanford, though the literature itself has not been published.

Re: Pappy&apos;s memories of SHHSBTs

Tom, I remember well the &quot;small hand-held slate/blackboard
things&quot; (SHHS/BTs). The acronym is pronounced somewhat like a
librarian hissing at noisy students. As you described, students
used them to practice writing and ciphering (two of the three
&quot;R&quot;s). Actually, in my case, it was all three &quot;R&quot;s, &apos;cause the
teacher and I had to be able to read what I had &quot;writ and
ciphered&quot; in the little one-room Kansas schoolhouse of my very
early years.

It is with some sadness and pain that I remember them, though.
You see, the small SHHS/BTs were, in their day, &quot;high tech&quot;
precursors to today&apos;s &quot;Blackberries&quot; and, in the buzz words of
those yesterdays, they were simply ... &quot;the berries&quot;! Today,
only the students whose parents can afford to provide their kids
with laptops and Blackberries have it easy. The rest, having
only large cumbersome desktop computers, are at a distinct
disadvantage ... like myself in the distant days of my more
diminutive decades. The latter &quot;almost&quot; qualify (under today&apos;s
standards) as members of the select group of students within our
and previous generations who had to walk to school, uphill...
both ways (in raging blizzards, year-round).

I was one of those poor unfortunate souls whose Kansas farm
family could not afford to equip me with &quot;The Berries&quot; (an
SHHS/BT) so I had to do my writing and ciphering on a coal
shovel with a good sturdy &quot;clinker&quot; from the cinders in the
shaker box beneath the coal stove. We couldn&apos;t afford chalk, so
I always got marked down in penmanship because the teacher had
great difficulty reading my black letters and numbers on a rusty
shovel.

By now, if some of you younger Bombers are failing to follow
this ... it&apos;s OK, it&apos;s a generation gap thing. Anyway, there I
would be, writing and ciphering my homework on my coal shovel by
the light of flickering flames coming from the door of the
potbellied stove (by kerosene lamp during more prosperous
times). I remember one time when Gramps heard me muttering
memorizations of &quot;pi r^&quot; and he said, &quot;Boy, what are they
teachin&apos; ya at thet thar school? Any fool knows that pie are
round and cornbread are square!&quot; Lugging my daily homework
(uphill through the snowdrifts) to school was (by today&apos;s
expressions) ... &quot;a real bummer&quot; and like &quot;carrying a load&quot;.
Furthermore, it actually placed a greater financial burden on my
parents than those of the SHHS/BT-owning students because we
often were required to turn in our homework but not get it back
for a few days. So, dad had to buy, beg, or borrow several ...
coal shovels. Man, even in the grades, when I had homework in
several subjects, I felt like a college student ... carrying a
real full load.

We probably all, at one time or another, used the excuse, &quot;My
dog ate my homework!&quot; It never worked for me. The teacher knew
my family and the fact that I had no dog in those days. I always
had an excuse though; I could say with some validity that I had
to dig my way through the uphill snowdrifts and my homework
rubbed off of the shovel. I did, however, have a pet turtle.
Turtles don&apos;t eat much, but they could conceivably nibble a lot
of holes in paper. It was a moot point anyway since I did my
homework on shovels.

Wait a minute ... I didn&apos;t have a pet turtle. It was a pet
rooster. My memories delude with the decades. I hated that
rooster. I got him as a pet baby chick at a feed store in
Wichita when my mom and Aunt Elsie won the Grand Prize singin&apos;
&quot;Yippee Ki Yea&quot; on Country Clem&apos;s Radio Show. They won 50 baby
yellow chicks and the feed store guy threw in a baby black chick
for me. Trouble was, that chick grew into a mean and nasty, low-
down, ambushin&apos;, and back-floggin&apos; rooster. He would lie in wait
for me as I wandered about, muttering to myself, in the
barnyard. The stork had just arrived with my much younger
sister, so I had to play by myself or with the cows and
chickens. That dang rooster did not play nice! When I least
expected it, he would race across the barnyard, jump up and grab
my by the seat of my britches with his feet, and flog the
dickens outta me with his wings. I always went runnin&apos; to the
farmhouse screamin&apos; bloody murder with the rooster floppin&apos; and
crowin&apos;. Did I mention that I hated that rooster?! But, I got
even. When I got a little older, I would sneak up and drop
Gramp&apos;s ol&apos; WW-I &quot;Doughboy&quot; helmet over him. He always looked
like a two-legged turtle running around. See, I get my stories
confused nowadays. Gramps finally had enough of that ruckus and
that rooster went to &quot;hen house heaven&quot; as he was too tough to
eat.

So, in retrospect, I am in complete sympathy with today&apos;s non-
laptop/Blackberry-owning students. And, maybe I actually had it
easy, shoveling my homework to school. Lugging those desktops to
and from school today, must be another full load. Of course,
nowadays most of the kids have cars and I was barefoot, and ...,
and ....

I hope everyone has a wonderful time at Club-40 this weekend. I
am sorry I can&apos;t attend, but the boat is calling my name at the
San Juans, and we will be sailing off tomorrow by this time for
a week of R&amp;R;, I hope!!

I have been driving a lot in the state in the past month, and
the smoke from the forest fires seems to be everywhere. I just
feel like our beautiful Washington is burning up. I keep hearing
that these forest fires are under control; hope so.

It looks like things are looking up for my MIL. She is finally
starting to feel settled in independent living in Wenatchee, and
just had another doctor&apos;s appointment and, thankfully, she will
not need to have any surgery!! And she has finally decided to
sell her house with the million dollar view of the Columbia
River in Brewster, so things are moving forward.

My husband has been guest preaching in Tieton, at the Methodist
church, and we will be there on Sundays at least through the end
of the month.

I am looking forward to the San Juans, but I still am thrilled
to go by Vantage, as I do almost weekly as I go down to see my
mother in assisted living in Kennewick. In fact, this week I got
to see my brother, Roy (65) and his family also, and my 89-year-
old uncle Bob and his wife, Louise. And I got to spend time with
Elsie Walker again. She is certainly a role-model for all of us
in growing older gracefully.

Hey Vic,

That was a nice piece about John Sams. He was a really neat guy.
All of the family were. They were good friends of ours from the
neighborhood and school.

I knew John since he was only a year older than me. Dick was a
friend of my brother Mike and our whole family. We had one of
those basketball courts. It&apos;s funny how many of us CK kids still
feel the passing of one of our friends so deeply. John worked
with my sister Shannon and he was one of the nicest and politest
people that I knew. May his family always know that he is in our
thoughts and prayers and know that he is playing ball with some
of the kids from the neighborhood right now. Also he&apos;s up there
with his dad, mom; and my dad, Danny, and some real cool other
people.

Take care and God Bless.


Hi Mike and Mary,

My thoughts and prayers go out for you and your family. I sent a
card to Dick, but it&apos;s for the whole family. Mary and Patty,
Chuck, and extended families. I&apos;m thinking about you and hope
you all know he&apos;s doing okay now and hoping you have the
strength to carry on his legacy. I can&apos;t be at the memorial
because I have to go to Spokane to see Danny&apos;s cousins, or I
would be there. Take care and just think what a neat group of
people came from our neighborhood.. There must of been about 60
kids at least in just our little corner of the world. Great Days

Re: Sept 8th item from Donna Bowers Rice (&apos;63)
 [her father&apos;s cancer]

Donna&apos;s story reminded me of something I&apos;d long since forgotten
about. I worked at Hanford as a Radiation Monitor for about 3
years, from 1981-84 -- mostly in the 300 Area labs. First of
all, let me say that I am NOT suggesting her dad did this! But
his story made me wonder about a few of the people I used to
work around.

I remember that many times I would enter a lab and discover that
one of the technicians (an &quot;old-timer&quot; who&apos;d been there for
years) had &quot;forgotten&quot; to wear his dosimeter(s) while working in
a glovebox or a hood. I&apos;d find his badge (which also held the
whole-body dosimeter) hanging on a chair, or swung around to his
back, and his finger-ring dosimeters lying on a counter or desk.
When I&apos;d confront him about it he&apos;d act like it had been
unintentional, and put the dosimeters back on. After reporting
him to his and my supervisors, I learned the real reason: he
didn&apos;t want his true exposure to be recorded because that often
meant he&apos;d get pulled from the lab (due to exposure limits that
were administratively imposed) for several weeks at a time. The
guy told me that he didn&apos;t care, because &quot;it takes 30-40 years
for that kind of cancer to develop, and I&apos;ll be dead by then
anyway!&quot; I couldn&apos;t believe it! I heard stories of other such
technicians who did this as well, but most of the people I
worked with were very careful and diligent about wearing the
dosimeters.

I also remember a younger guy who would purposely expose himself
to beams of radiation (when a door or port to a hot cell or
glove box was opened) by standing in front of it in a Superman
pose. I think he thought it impressed the women (yes! -- your
obnoxiously arrogant and ignorant actions are just so enticing
to us). We RMs hated working with him, and would routinely
report him to supervision. I think he finally got fired. I
wonder if any of those techs ever developed cancer ... they KNEW
the rules -- and the reason for them - but blatantly ignored
them anyway.

We were contacted by the Dept. of Labor about Clarence&apos;s cancer.
We were asked to begin the process of filing a claim due to his
work in the &quot;hot&quot; labs at Hanford. I just wanted to say they
have been responsive in a very timely manner. They sent us the
forms to complete, called within a week for the phone interview,
and we heard from the Seattle office within a week after that
requesting additional information. They told me they now have a
system set up to deal with these claims and are acting upon them
in a timely manner. This is a far cry from those who have filed
claims in prior years, only to wait years to hear anything from
anyone again. This may lead to absolutely nothing as far as a

Re: Hanford and Radiation

To start, I&apos;m very sorry for the loss of your father at such an
early age. My dad also worked at Hanford and was a radiation
monitor for many years; he had the opportunity to go all over
the state at times to check radiation levels as compared to
those of Hanford&apos;s. He had told me many times that the findings
that he had were that levels at Hanford were lower over all than
those of other levels around the state, a lot from natural
causes. He also worked in a lot of very hot spots. (I remember
him telling me of the time that he had to go to, I believe,
Idaho Falls, that had a reactor blow and help clean up. He also
told that in that incident of having to retrieve a body that had
been impaled on the ceiling and of how they had to retrieve that
person, going through the steps of one guy taking in a ladder
and then coming right back out and that he was over his limit
when he got out and the steps followed in the retrieval of that
person, with all the guys that helped having received their max
levels.)

My dad knew of all the bad things that could happen in the job
that he did, but he chose to do the job anyway, because he like
most all of the people that worked at Hanford, thought that it
was for the country. My dad also wanted his body donated to
Hanford to be studied after his death, by the way my dad died
when he was 57. His thoughts were that he was doing his part,
probably as was your father. I had worked out at Hanford off and
on during my working years as a carpenter, and I felt as my
father did, I was proud to do my part, as little as it was.
Also, my father-in-law died at an early age from cancer of the
liver, he also worked at Hanford for many years. My thoughts are
that our parents did what they thought was the thing to do at
the time, was it the correct thing had they known after all was
said and done, maybe not. I guess that my point is that we can&apos;t
always go back and try and be compensated. I&apos;m sorry that a lot
of our parents passed away earlier than we would have liked, I
know that I feel that way, because I miss my dad and father-in-
law, but then, life goes on.

Hey there Bombers and Bomberettes...

Hope y&apos;all that are old enough enjoyed Club-40. I&apos;ll make it
one of these days. I was in the lobby of the Hampton Inn just
Saturday, meeting with Bill Berlin; he qualifies for Club-40.
Noticed quite a few old Bombers zoomin&apos; around. Course, they
were much older than me, so I didn&apos;t know any of them/you.

Speaking of Bill Berlin; quite an engaging fellow with a
colorful history and present. We had, in my humble opinion, a
very pleasant visit over a cup-o-joe.

And on the much older than me subject, I really enjoyed Pappy
Swan&apos;s post Saturday about the old fashioned Blackberries of
days gone by. I have never had a Blackberry or a Personal Slate
Board for that matter, but in my school days, quite a number of
raspberries were cast in my general direction. By the way, Pappy,
I think you overlooked giving credit where credit is definitely
due ... the boyfriends of those in-betweener girls. You know,
the ones who don&apos;t carry PSB&apos;s (or shovels), but their families
can&apos;t afford more than an iPod Shuffle. I mean, just think about
it ... having to carry TWO desktops, monitors and daisy-wheel
printers to and from school, uphill and into the wind (both
ways) through inclement weather, etc., well ... you get the
picture. No wonder the schools are turning out record breaking
sports jocks every year. The kids may not be so hot at WASL, but
they can lift twice their body weight in computer peripherals and
not lose a beat!

Train Whistles ...

Now you guys (a non gender-based reference to all you folks)
know I don&apos;t wax reminiscent very often. I rarely even wax my
car and NEVER my legs. And I can&apos;t even spell the &quot;R&quot; word. But
I&apos;ve been wanting to post this little tidbit ever since I came
back to the Tri-Cities (or did I already?). I grew up on Cedar
Ave, just two blocks east of the shelter-belt. West of it is, of
course, the By-Pass Highway and a ways farther west is the train
tracks. Now that is the item I speak to today. Well ... not
exactly the train TRACKS, but more the train WHISTLES. Like, do
they ever change those things? I swear, they still go running
back and forth every day at the same times as they did when I
was a kid. And they sound just the same. Is there some federal
ruling by OSHA or somebody that a train whistle must have that
same certain frequency and timbre? Does the company that built
train whistles in the late fifties own the patent and still
control the pitch? Isn&apos;t that a monopoly? Or is that a bored
game with little pink houses that all look the same (and have
alphabet letters for descriptors)? Like ... I sit on my back
deck in Pasco and hear the SAME train whistles today that I
heard the day I snuck out my bedroom window with my pack of
clothes in a blanket to run away from home with Mary Cordella
McFall! We used the train whistle to let us know it was time to
make our move and head for our Great Escape down the shelter
belt. By the way, we got almost to the Yakima River bridge at
the &quot;Y&quot; where we had to leave the cover of the verdant
undergrowth and forestation and got picked up by one of
Richland&apos;s finest and toted to the Police Dept. Come to think of
it, that siren didn&apos;t sound like the ones today. In fact, that
was actually a &quot;black and white&quot;. Do you hear what I&apos;m sayin&apos;?
Like, they don&apos;t even have cabooses anymore, but the whistles
sound the same!!!!

Well, not that they remind me of by-gone times or anything like
that. So, where am I going with all this? Just off to San Diego.
Maybe I&apos;ll see ya in October. I&apos;m doing a wedding up in
Leavenworth ... sounds like fun.

Re: Frontier Tavern

It looks like the Frontier Tavern is history. It&apos;s being gutted
out and fixed up and the sign says it will be a candy and/or a
chocolate store. Last time in there about two years ago it was
pretty run down. The ceilings were a mess and the bathrooms
horrible. I don`t know how far back that place goes as it is a
really old building. No Mike, it was never a Denny`s. I would
like first dibs on the old sign that says Frontier Tavern with
the covered wagon on it or the sign below that says parking in
the rear.

Hey Pappy,

I, too, was wondering what the &quot;little ones&quot; have been up to.
Since your much younger sister Marilyn didn&apos;t see them while she
was sunning by the pond I figured they must still be out of town
in their little Tomcat?!

Speaking of snowdrifts, Richland got its fair share when I was
growing up. In the 8th grade it had snowed most of the night. I
had to walk from Torbett and Thayer to Chief Jo in thigh-high
snow. Of course there were no pants allowed and my snow boots
only came about half-way up my lower leg. No one had gotten out
and shoveled their walks at that time of morning so I think I
was the trailblazer along Torbett and Stevens. Now my mail
carrier drives from box to box along a single row at my
apartment complex and doesn&apos;t even get out of her truck unless
she is leaving packages at the office (talk about lazy).

Re: Class of 1956 50th Class Reunion and Club-40

First let me thank profusely all of those who organized, so very
well, both events. Seeing so many of my classmates of 50 years
(or more) was priceless and we listened to both CD&apos;s on our way
home. My wife Sandra graduated from Franklin HS in Seattle in
1957, so the music was from her era too. She was so impressed
with the turnout for both the Class of &apos;56 and C-40 and the
organization that went in to those events.

Whilst I touched base with so many people from my class, I
missed so really key people ... my cousin Bev Jochen (&apos;52), Gus
Keeney, Pappy, Em Dow, to name a few. I was not able to track
down Harvey Chapman (&apos;56) because he moves too fast and with a
broken foot I was not too mobile. We had to leave early from a
couple of events because my foot kept swelling up due to all of
my walking and standing activity. I have only been walking a
couple of weeks but I wanted to be upright for the Reunion and
C-40, but there was a price to pay.

Can you believe Carol Brimhall Smith&apos;s voice? She was always the
thespian in school with more artistic talent in one finger than
I had in my whole body. The only instrument I could play was the
radio, but I was amazed she is still in such &quot;great voice&quot;. Good
to see my &apos;56 buddies Bob Roller, Joe Ben Hodges [right?], Vern
Huskey, Bernie Qualheim, Bill Hartley, John Irwin and too many
to mention and get to meet Jeff Michael [&apos;65] in a semi-business
meeting at my hotel on Saturday.

I am sure glad I came over and whilst moving back to or living
in the Tri-Cities is not my cup of tea, I can see why a lot of
you live there or want to come back. Just the same I missed some
&apos;56 classmates that I used to hang with ... like, John Cowan,
Bob Koger, Bill Weston, Jim Green, Jim Crose, and certainly
those that have passed on to the Big Col-Hi in the sky. All in
all, it was a very emotional time for me and I greatly
appreciated it too.

Bomber best,

Re: Our Future is growing up...are we off the hook yet????

Well here it is....there we were....17 and full of
ourselves...we had the answers to all the questions....a year
later, Ricky Warford (&apos;65) and I would be sitting on the curb of
Mac Hall shaking our heads in horror....we knew nothing were
equipped for nothing and were being sent out into the world of
the big people....Well the birthday boy is beginning to
encounter the same feelings we had back then...his dad and I
were buds since we were 15 and have remained so ever
since...I&apos;ve watched him grow and turn into a stand up guy with
the same work ethic and determination his dad has....he has
always been part of the gang...so much so that once when we were
having our Sunday sorry 7 breakfast and were told that the
birthday boy couldn&apos;t eat where we were eating because he was
not 21 we all got up and went to another eating
establishment....don&apos;t tell us one of us is unwelcome.........he
went with Roy (&apos;63) to pick up the big bomb which we proudly
display at our reunions....he is another generation and he and
those with him are our future....soon we will look to him for
the answers we thought we had so long ago....Thanks to all the
young men and women who carry on our proud heritage as
BOMBERS.......Thanks to this young man for being my pal...just
like his older brother and his Pop Doc 40..........HAPPY

Re: Reunion planning - Class of &apos;97

Hello from Southern California! I hope things are well with
everyone.

I am -- at least for now -- the main (pretty much only) planner
for my 10 year reunion next year. I know, I know, 10 years isn&apos;t
that much for most of you. Unfortunately, I am not living in the
Tri-Cities area and could use some help and/or recommendations
for places or vendors or anything that may be useful in planning
an event. The tentative dates are mid/late July or early August.
Also, is there a contact at RHS that helps with reunions, or are
alumni pretty much on their own? I was not in student
government, so I have no idea if the class has any money
anywhere or really how to get started.

Thanks for any suggestions. Feel free to send me an e-mail
directly, or if you wish, post to the Sandstorm.

Go Bombers!

Hey gang! Kudos to Robert Carlson, Ann Thompson, Judy Willox,
Dona Belt, and all the rest. Super.

The Club-40 party was fantastic! It was certainly the largest
ever. Being so big, we had a bit too much on Friday night, but
heck, that is better than too little.

I still claim the best ever was the 1951. In those days we had a
hospitality room, and the Class of 1951 cleaned out all our
provisions. It was like an alligator in a chicken coop. They
have proven to be one of the best classes ever.

I had a dance with the wonderful Maren Smyth, a tricky two step,
each of us with only one arm, my other with a coke, and Maren&apos;s
with a camera. She is some hoofer, and I am going to ask for a
couple of spots in Dancing with the Stars.

RE: Club-40

On a happier note, we enjoyed Club-40 last weekend. Friday night
we were entertained (I was more than entertained -- I was
delighted) by a young man who tap danced. Now when I think tap
dance, I think Lawrence Welk ... However, this youngster did the
cutest routine. I must have taken 5 pics of him dancing. Then a
little girl played the shadow while Bill Johnson sand &quot;Me and My
Shadow&quot; and it was great. Club-40 had a raffle, but I didn&apos;t win
anything -- oh, yeah, that&apos;s right -- I didn&apos;t buy any tickets
(they were sold out by the time I got there). Someone said
something nasty Friday night and it just stunned a lady from
Sacramento.

Saturday was the swing band -- so good, and there was a couple
who have obviously danced together a very long time. It was a
pleasure watching them. My friends Maren Smyth (&apos;63-&apos;64), Jean
Armstrong Reynolds (&apos;64), Dena Evans Harr (&apos;64), Larry Holloway
(&apos;64), and Barb Eckert Holloway (&apos;61) were there and it was a
nice evening together. Maren came all the way from Louisiana,
Jean from Arizona, Dena from Oregon; the rest of us live here. I
took lots of pics both nights.

Maren, I think you should stay another month!

-Deedee Willox Loiseau (&apos;64) ~ Burbank, WA. Yes, there is a
 Burbank in Washington. lol At Club-40 a lady asked me
 where I was from. When I said Burbank, she started
 telling me where she used to live in California. She
 was amazed that there was a Burbank in Washington.

yearbook from Barstow class of 52 as a must see must have...you
can fool me once son but not...uuuuuuuh...not 28 times.....well
maybe 28 times but NOT 32 times! But I must say that Dave
Hanthorn (&apos;63) turned me on to some great &quot;Cruizin&apos;&quot; CDs and I
owe him bigtime...he mentioned the one from &apos;64 since it
featured &quot;KJR Seattle channel 95!&quot; but they have them from 55
thru 69....each featuring a different DJ from a different
town...that got me thinkin about the Real Don Steele Who played
second fiddle to Lynn Bryson (&apos;57) when we were kids...then
moved to Yakima then to Portland, LA and Syndication as &quot;Live
from the 60s&quot; one of my favorites of all time.........I have now
managed to snag a bunch of the original Live shows from a former
DJ in Pasco....

So...No more funny stuff, Gary!

I -- having been a professional writer-editor -- am just a bit burned
that my overly long bio in the 50th reunion booklet was edited so
thoroughly that it (a) didn&apos;t made sense any more and (b) totally whacked
off my mention of having gone back the UW for a certificate in poetry-
writing a couple of years ago.

I don&apos;t know, maybe my ramblings about dogs, kids, etc. were more
important than the work and dedication (not to mention publication) that
I put into going back to school at age 60. I, however, have cut copy all
my life and would have liked the chance to have done so this time. The 
fact that poetry was way at the top of my bio should have been a clue to 
its importance.

In this electronic age, is there a problem in sending back a too-long
entry to the writer for thoughtful editing? Giving a word-count in
instructions would have helped, as well.

This, of course, is not to detract from all the hard work the committee
put into the reunion. It&apos;s a huge undertaking and I applaud those who
gave it their time and energy.

I actually left Richland the summer before my senior year, but because I
grew up in Richland I will always consider myself to be part of the class
of &apos;79 from Col-Hi.

I have a story that I thought some might find amusing. I got married at
the very end of my junior year and my husband Bill whisked me away to the
east coast in Massachusetts, (it took me years to learn how to say it and
spell it,). 

I entered the local high school in Westfield as a senior. Imagine my
surprise when I discovered that Westfield High was called the Bombers!!
Their colors are black and red. http://alumnisandstorm.com/Mascot.html Westfield is #14 on the list of &quot;other Bombers&quot;

I have tried over the years to figure out what their mascot was, but
no one seemed to know. But it appears that the B-17 bomber is the mascot,
I only found this out when my son joined the wrestling team. 

I just thought that some might enjoy this story. I miss Richland and I
haven&apos;t been very good with keeping in contact with people I grew up
with. But I do enjoy the stories on the Sandstorm, and it proves to my
kids that I&apos;m not making up stories, for instance, Chili and Giant
Cinnamon Roll lunch day. They didn&apos;t buy the stories though about walking
to school in two feet of snow up hill both ways! Thanks for letting me
share. http://www.k12.westfield.ma.us/whs/welcometry2.html -Denise Payne Sitler (&apos;79wb)

Re: Club 40
 
The weekend began with so many familiar faces whom have attended Club 40
before. One of the funs of attending every year. This was the sixth
weekend for me since induction of the class of 1960 in the year 2000. 
Bob Carlson, aka Mike Clowes (&apos;54), president and Ann Thompson, aka Anna 
May Wann (&apos;49) get a loud hurrah for their ever present work. Goes for 
the board and volunteers also. Provides a great place for many who are 
meeting for the first time in 40 or more years. The original group of 
Bombers who started Club 40 certainly knew what they were doing 19 years 
ago. Club 40 is going into their 20th Anniversary. How about some history 
from our Upper Class Dick McCoy (&apos;45) and Ann Wann Thompson (&apos;49) and 
whoever helped the beginning of Club 40? You must have been a hoot with 
all the kick off.

So many highlights of the weekend or any Bomber get-together is meeting
the Bombers who write into the Sandstorm. More stories.

Re: Mrs. Donna Foust Burroughs

Maren and I began talking about going to Mrs. Foust&apos;s home together to 
see her all these years during a reunion. Did not happen. Early this 
summer I sent in pictures of Spalding classes. Again Maren and I began 
talking about seeing Mrs. Foust again. Decided having her attend Club 40 
would be a good thing. Finally I told Maren when I found her address that 
I would just go to her home and invite her. As written by me earlier in 
the Sandstorm I did and she accepted. On the corner next door to Mrs. 
Foust is the ranch house where the Jewelry sign was already in the yard. 
Home still owned by Mrs. Leonora Jackson. From there spun into Mrs. 
Jackson and her daughter Mary Jackson Richards (&apos;66) would attend also. 
Many things transpired with my contact with Mrs. Foust from there. Maren
Smyth (&apos;63 and &apos;64), Jan Bollinger Persons (&apos;60) and myself took care of 
fees (Thanks Jan, you were missed). President of Club 40, Bob Carlson, 
aka Mike Clowes (&apos;54) introduced her on Friday night. From there was 
students as you can see by the pictures who had her as a teacher. Very 
unusual for a teacher to have four students with them at once after all 
these years. http://richlandclub40.org/Reunions/2006/mjh-0829.html [Look, Patti! There are SIX students in the picture!!! -Maren]

Went by to see Mrs. Foust on Tuesday after Club 40. She was still elated. 
This also was the week of her 78th birthday. 

Re: All Bomber Lunch - West Richland 9/9/06
 http://alumnisandstorm.com/Lunches/Current-ALL/00.html

What a great time for a luncheon. We had Bombers from as far away as
Guelph, Ontario, Canada which was Betty Neal Brinkman (&apos;62). The chatter 
of all the Bombers probably could have been heard at a distance. When I 
got up to speak for announcements it took a while to get everyone quiet. 
From what David Mansfield (&apos;59) said about the bull horn guess they never 
did quiet down. Usually we do announcements and introductions but with 
this group they wanted to talk and that is what they did. Attendees: 
Gloria Falls Evans (&apos;58) and spouse Jim; Mary Rose Tansy (&apos;60) Utah; 
Glen Rose (&apos;58) - spouse Carol is away taking care of grand children; 
Maren Smyth (&apos;63&amp;&apos;64) Gretna, LA so glad to have her with us;
Marilyn Swan Beddo (&apos;63) Utah; George &quot;Pappy&quot; Swan (&apos;59) and spouse 
Jeanne; Pat Doriss Trimble (&apos;65) and spouse for a short while;
Della Bean Ferris; Marie Ruppert Hartman (&apos;63) our great photographer 
whom we appreciate so much for taking pictures and sending them in. 
Brenda Bean Church (&apos;59) and spouse Doug; Ralph Bean (&apos;58) and spouse 
Barbara, Spokane; Betty Neal Brinkman (&apos;62) Guelph Toronto, Canada;
Bonnie Allen (&apos;59), Neill Creek, WA; David Mansfield (&apos;59) Eugene, OR:
Marilyn &quot;Cookie&quot; Baird Singletary (&apos;60); Dave Rhodes (&apos;52) and spouse 
Alice; Rosalie Geiger Hughes, Boise, ID; Lora Homme Page (&apos;60); 
Carol Chartrand; Barbara Isakson Rau (&apos;58); Ruth Miles Bruns (&apos;59) and 
spouse Henry, Goldendale, WA; Fred Klute (&apos;58), John Irl French (&apos;51),
Western WA;, Ann Thompson, aka Anna May Wann (&apos;49), Treasurer of Club 40
from Western WA; Barbara Stokesberry (&apos;60); Jean Williamson Dreher (&apos;49), 
Moses Lake area; Daryl Johnson (&apos;73) and spouse Deanne, celebrating their 
first anniversary this week; John Browne, Jr. (&apos;61) Vashon Island, WA; 
and Vera Smith Robbins (&apos;58). Bombers kept coming so I missed that a lot 
of you did not put your class year or whether spouse. Tried to put in as 
many that I knew the year.

A Bomber said during the luncheon &quot;we are out growing the place&quot;. I
believe this is true with the numbers last month and this. We had about
fifteen more because of Club 40. Some who normally attend we&apos;re off at
reunions and so forth.

I am excited about the growth and hope it continues every month. JD
Diner holds approximately 50 in the room we are in. Also enjoyed
introducing my 16 year old cousin who is dating Jamie (small world
story). Jamie (&apos;07) is our waiter (excellent waiter who can deal with
all of us Bombers) and mother Hanna owns JD diner. Best coffee shop in
the area by my opinion. I have gotten to know Breanna Boak (&apos;08) and more
of my cousins since returning to the area. Many you wouldn&apos;t know they
are my cousins because of our last names. Breanna&apos;s grandfather is my
Uncle Jim Boak which many of you might know from Hanford. His wife and my
Aunt are Kay Boak who worked in Uptown Thrifty for about 30 years. I have 
found many Bombers who know her since I returned. Many cousins from both 
sides of the family here but most wouldn&apos;t know are my cousins because of 
last names.

Re: Marketing class RHS

Breanna and Jamie emailed me tonight that the class is still needing
many more recipes for their cook book which will be sold by Christmas
time. The teacher has given them another week and half to get them in.
Let&apos;s show the teacher and students what the Bombers can do. You can 
send the recipes to my email address: waterbird7@msn and I will make 
sure they get them.

I have a dial phone in my living room. A couple of months ago my 
neighbor&apos;s phone was not working, so he came over and used my phone to 
call the repair service. While he was here his 15 year old son came 
looking for his dad. After careful scrutiny of the phone from just about 
every angle he said &quot;That&apos;s really cool, how does it work?&quot;.

The phones were packed and mailed on Friday evening... I appreciate the 
money you sent for the phones but I returned your checks in the boxes 
with the phones... the phones are on me... I hope you enjoy them. 

Does anyone out there in Bomberland know when they quit using WHitehall
and started using 94?

Re: Sending Pictures to the Sandstorm

To Maren:

After reading the various reactions to the whip-lashing one Bomber got
for not following the rules for sending pictures, I want to personally
thank you for not hanging me out to dry the first time I sent pictures.
As I remember you responded by email to me personally, not via the Alumni
Sandstorm, and explained (in decent language) that I needed to send
pictures to a different address and that I needed to identify the people.
For new users of this forum and even newer users of digital cameras, its
easy to make a mistake. So... Thanks Maren for not making me feel like
a bumbling fool who couldn&apos;t read or follow directions. I know how
frustrating it must be to have to repeat instructions, but sometimes 
new readers aren&apos;t aware of the &quot;rules&quot;.

Re: Thank-You&apos;s Abound
To: Bob Carlson, aka Mike Clowes (&apos;54)

Thank you my Dear President for the wonderful praise you left for me in
yesterday&apos;s Sandstorm. And thank you for ever being present when I may
need help with things, including the &quot;store&quot;. I always said that we make
one heck of a team, and this years reunion soundly proved that! Other
then the usual, &quot;Oh oh, where do I sit?&quot; routine, it all went very well.
As you stated, that is always gonna happen unless we have the accurate
account by the registrations. Hint, Hint: Register people. It really does
help us all. :o)

To: Connie Dean O&apos;Neil, Derrith Persons Dean, Marsha Lawell Hathcox, 
 Kaye Ivers, Rita Brackenbush Sevcik (The classy &apos;60&apos;s Gals)

The biggest heartfelt thanks I can muster up to you gals, for all the
help you provided for the &quot;store&quot; that weekend. It is the generous time
and help of you all that made my weekend the greatest and allowed me to
enjoy my 45th reunion. THANK YOU SO MUCH!! And the Club also thanks you
for all the help with the registration desks this year! You are all
great!

Also my thanks to those of you who volunteered their time and help in
the tearing down and loading the trailer Sunday. I know I am going to
miss someone here, as my attention was elsewhere it seems. But thank you
to Pete Overdahl (&apos;60), Danny and Marjorie Qualheim Haggard ( &apos;57) and
Larry (&apos;57) and Dona McCleary Belt (&apos;54) for their help. If I missed
anyone, forgive me, as you are no less thanked then those above.

And then, thank you to those of you who volunteered their help. Barbara
Isakson Rau (&apos;58), Fred Klute (&apos;58) and Barbara Stookesberry Long (&apos;60).
And again, if I missed anyone here, you are no less thanked then those
mentioned.

Finally, thanks to all the committee members of the three classes
honored this year; 1951, 1956, and 1961 for their diligence in bringing
together their successful reunions and joining the club reunion this
year.

Class of &apos;56--what a resounding success! Class of &apos;51-- you pulled it off 
well, and Class of &apos;61--I love ya guys! Shall we start planning for the
50th? ;o)

Last, but certainly not least, a big thank you to all the classes this
year who had reunions and allowed me to bring the &quot;store&quot; and be a part
of them. These were the classes of 1966, 1971, 1976, 1986 and, of course
the classes who joined us at the Club 40 Reunion weekend; 1951, 1956 and
1961.

A BIG thank you to you all for helping to keep the success of the Club 40
&quot;store&quot; going.

Bomber Cheers and Love to All,
-Judy Willox (Classic Class of &apos;61) ~ Richland ~ where the weather is 
 cooling fast and Autumn is on it&apos;s way. And I love it!! And 
 &apos;tis the season to &quot;GO BOMBERS&quot;!!

Who ever it was last year that said that Dean Heiling (&apos;63) looked like 
Kevin Federline should be ashamed of themselves. Our Dean Heiling, who 
does now have a gotee and a blond wife, is the poster child for perpetual 
youth, but he doesn&apos;t look anything like Kevin Federline. OK, maybe a 
little if the light is right and you&apos;ve been locked up in his wine 
cellar, but he would never wear one of those stupid hats.

Happy Birthday [on 9/21] Dean, &quot;You da&apos; Man&quot;

This is just a quick note to let my fellow Bombers know that my Dad 
and I will be living in Gig Harbor, WA. I have taken a job as Office
Manager/Real Estate Agent with Vision Realty. The office is located on
the Harbor.

Dad, Richard C. Baker came to Hanford in 1943. He and my Mom lived in
Yakima until 1945 when a house became available for them in Richland at
1511 Mahan. In 1948 we moved to 1738 Davison. Dad built a home at 2044
Hudson in 1961. That house will now be sold.

We are moving to be closer to my children and grandchildren. Rich, his
wife and 3 of my grandchildren live on the southern end of Key Peninsula.
Angela and her family live in Virginia. Dan and his family are in the
process this week of moving to Boise, ID. Angela and Dan will now be only
a direct flight away.

We leave Richland with many memories. This will be a new adventure which
we are looking forward to. My number will be in the phone book if you are
coming thru Gig Harbor or just email me.

Hi Bombers and Bomberettes!

Check-in and catching-up as it has been a full summer!

One of the highlights was having Marilyn Swan Beddo (&apos;63), Pappy&apos;s much 
younger sister, visit us for a week here at our home and then travel 
through California stopping at the Sequoias, the Gold Country, Yosemite 
and the Redwoods. In the Gold country we stopped to see another Bomber
from our class, Judy Shibly Cozad (&apos;63), and hubby Jerry (NAB) and had 
a wonderful visit with them. We not only saw their dream home but stayed 
in their Captain&apos;s Quarters which is like a B&amp;B;, were treated to a day in
the gold country and the play &quot;Joseph&apos;s Amazing Tech. Coat&quot;. Then we met
up with some other Bombers from our class on the Oregon coast. We had 
a great time. There is nothing like getting together with Bombers and
sharing our childhood memories and laughing till all hours! Bombers are
the Best!

(Maren, can you fix this. So sorry, don&apos;t know how to do that yet, and
have been meaning to e-mail you anyway. How much do I owe you, what is
your new address and how are you doing since last year. So sorry I am
late with all of this but last year was a tough time and I am just now
trying to catch up)

By the way, my husband and I spent some time looking around the Columbia
Gorge area. Can anyone give me some info. or insight to a great place to
live around the Portland area and coast in that area. Pros and Cons?

Re: Fairs

Larry Mattingly (&apos;60) mentioned the Alaskan Fair. Does anyone go to the
Benton County Fair anymore? I use to love it when I was at home. I have
come to the conclusion as I get older that some things just never cease 
to amaze me, a few of them are, fireworks, seeing a deer, the smell and
scent of a new baby and the Fair! Now there is more of course, I just
mentioned a few, but these things just never grow old. Anyway, even
though living in L.A. has it&apos;s draw-backs, I have to say that the Pamona
Fair is one of the best! We had so much fun taking our two new little
grandkids to see just the baby animals, eat, go on the rides, eat, go see
the honey-bees and pony-rides, eat and get ice cream. That&apos;s is all we
did. We are going back just for us!

Re: School Days

My mother use to wake me up every first day of school and sing &quot;School
Days, school days, good old golden rule days&quot;! I loved school! I loved
getting a new box of colors, although I envied the kids that could afford
the big box with all the colors. I remember the first time I walked into
Spalding School. There was a lot of wood and it all seemed like it was
gleaming and it smelled so good. The rest of my school years were spent
at Jason Lee and that was a brand new school. We didn&apos;t have the wood 
and we did have white chalk boards but we had our own auditorium, gym, 
art room and a music room. Does anyone remember the Standard School
Broadcast? Every Thursday morning (correct me if I am wrong) we listened 
to that.

Re: The Kennewick Social Club

I went there a few times. The first was for the class of &apos;61 graduation
nite. I was going with Ronnie Miller (&apos;61) and his class had their party
there. But the most special time there was the night Jimmy Clayton was
suppose to be there. Does anyone remember that night? He didn&apos;t show up.
Got sick, I think. But I had a wonderful time. I changed clothes with
Mary Napier (&apos;63) that night. She didn&apos;t like her dress, and I loved it. 
I danced all night and it seemed for us girls in the class of &apos;63 the 
songs were made just for us that year. We were just 16 and there were so 
many songs out there like &quot;Happy Birthday Sweet 16&quot;, &quot;You&apos;re 16, You&apos;re 
Beautiful and You&apos;re Mine&quot; etc. etc. etc. Mary gave me the dress! Where 
is Mary, does anyone know?

To: Donna Bowers Rice (&apos;63) and others who have written in their concerns 
 over the Hanford compensations.

I would just like to say it would be my guess and some first hand
knowledge that many people have received some compensation and choose 
not to disclose it. First of all it is personal, second, it is somewhat
controversial. When we were growing up our parents wanted what went on 
in the family to stay in the family at least mine did. So there a lot of
things that I talk about today that my parents chose to keep quiet about.
It is a sad thing for everyone who lost loved ones due to abuses or
mistakes made by their work but like Roy said, his father, my father,
were doing what they chose to do and knew the dangers or accepted it as
what they had to do in life. My father was a patrolmen. I was so proud 
of him. He always wore a gun (in those days) and I felt so protected.

Well I have said enough must get back to gardening and dieting. I&apos;d like
to blame Marilyn for the weight gain but she said I couldn&apos;t! So for now
from the little house in La Mirada where we are having some Indian Summer
Day&apos;s without the brilliant blue skies. It&apos;s is hot!

Maren, Does anyone out there in Bomber land know how the primary process

can cast a primary ballot? I have heard so much grumbling about the
process in the state of Washington.

Wherever you move, keep in mind State Income Taxes. Oregon will tax your
pension (if you are fortunate enough to have one) and Washington has no
State Income Tax. Yet. If you want to live in the Portland area (with the
rain) you might want to consider living in Vancouver, WA. Portland is
just a hop, skip and a jump over the river. Paul (Knutson &apos;59) and I love

&gt;&gt;From: Sandy Carpenter Lee (&apos;61)

To: Roy Ballard (&apos;63)

Roy,

I don&apos;t know you from school, but was in the Class of &apos;61. In answer to
your question regarding voting, I too was concerned and almost didn&apos;t
want to vote in the primary election. I wrote to our County about it and
got back this reply:

 Dear Mrs. Lee;

 Thank you for taking the time to let us know of your frustration
 on the pick a party Primary Election system. The purpose of the
 Primary Election is to nominate candidates for the General
 election in November. Although candidates are not elected in the
 Primary, they are voted on to move forward to the General
 Election. 

 The blanket primary that was enjoyed by this state for so many
 years was declared unconstitutional by the courts in 2004. The
 decision by the courts has been appealed and upheld more than
 once. This is the third primary election Snohomish County has
 done under this system.

 Please know that any choice you make on your ballot is secret
 and private. There is no way for anyone to know how you have
 voted. You may choose to skip the party section on your ballot
 and only vote in the non-partisan area. You may also choose not
 to return your ballot. I appreciate your concerns with the
 primary election system; I hope I have been able to help answer
 your concerns. 

 Sincerely, 
 Wendy Mauch
 Election Supervisor, Snohomish County Auditor&apos;s Office

I was glad to hear that we will not have this concern in the general
elections. It is none of their business, and I don&apos;t like having to
specify either. It completely takes away our privilege of voting for 
the individual, rather than the party. Hope this helps.

Re: Living near Portland

To: Donni Clark Dunphy (&apos;63)

Donni, you asked about pros and cons of areas to live around Portland,
Or. and the Columbia Gorge. We live in Vancouver and love it. We have
lived in Oregon, but the tax structure is not good for retirees, because
of the high property tax and state income tax. You can get a lot more
house and property for your investment in Clark County and it is even
better just north in Cowlitz County. You may consider looking at homes in
Kalama, which is just a few miles north of Vancouver&amp;Portland and close
to Longview&amp;Kelso.

Good luck and let us know if you are in the area so we can get together
for a visit.

Re: Primary Election

Re: Roy Ballard (&apos;63)

Roy:
 
Primary elections in which one can vote for whomever he or she wishes,
regardless of party affiliation, are known as open primaries. They were
ruled unconstitutional a couple of years ago. The decision was not
totally without merit because primary elections are held so that the
various political parties can choose their own candidates. Your time to
vote across party lines is in the general election - where it would be
wise for you to do so if you want to return this country to a sound
footing.

Re: Richland&apos;s historic buildings

Thank you, Gary Behymer (&apos;64) for the link to Richland&apos;s historic houses
in the 9-21-06 Alumni Sandstorm. I enjoyed that and the home page which 
is the website for the East Benton County Historical Society. There are 
more pictures and stories for the entire area than I could absorb in a 
sitting. I live only about a mile and half from the museum and have never 
visited it. Isn&apos;t that pitiful! However, I have seen the inside of the 
1908 home at 529 Kennewick Avenue, where our friends and co-grandparents
of 3 grandchildren live. It is so beautiful! This is the home page link 
which shows that home among others in Kennewick&apos;s historic homes: http://www.owt.com/ebchs/ I used to visit the library at 89 Lee Boulevard, which building dates
from 1909. And, of course, The Richland Theater was a favorite place to
go for our group of about a dozen girls. The nights at that time were so
non-threatening, MaryAnn Burnett Gray (&apos;51) and I sometimes would walk
each other home across town. She lived uptown in an &quot;A&quot; house between
Symons and Thayer on Johnston, I lived way downtown on Douglass in a &quot;B&quot;.

Re: Teenage Embarrassment

I remember an embarrassing event that resulted when my mother and Mrs.
Vera Robinson, our friend and neighbor, mother of Bob Robinson (&apos;51-RIP)
hatched a scheme that I would be Bob&apos;s first date. We would go to the
movies. I guess I was more experienced, although it couldn&apos;t have been
very. I never dated as I remember until I was a sophomore, so it might
have been that year. He was nice, like my brother, and considerably
smaller than me. It would have been okay although I felt awkward at the
theater with schoolmates looking at us, but our too-interested mothers
were worse. 

Re: The Codger Pole

This is an addendum to my earlier-today post. I just opened the other
link http://www.roadsideamerica.com/tour/nw1.html Gary Behymer (&apos;64)
provided in this morning&apos;s Alumni Sandstorm. It&apos;s just great!! It&apos;s a 
travel log of unusual places and sights throughout the state and it 
explains what the Codger Pole is that Gary lives near.

Re: Sooooooooo many birthdays!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 9/23/06

Holy Bombers Batman... we gots a ton of birthdays... looks like I slipped
up on JoAnne Bucholtz (&apos;65) yesterday the 22nd... sorry kiddo... but HB
none the less... today we have an upperclassman wearing his Weejuns... or
maybe his wing tips... or his black Converse... he always was so swaaave
in his dress and Terry Davis (&apos;65) idolized him... maybe he was wearing
Bates floaters (is that the right time frame?????... only thought of them
because I ordered an official pair of USMC desert boots (with their own
emblem on the heel... when I was in Vietnam we couldn&apos;t get ANY boots
and certainly not with an emblem on them... anyway, this particular pair
is made by Bates... I believe their are two companies that make the
official boots... whoooptee doo... ) sooooooooo the other two birthday
boys I&apos;ve known since grade school... one very early and one since 6th
grade... the guy since 6th grade is an &quot;official&quot; Sorry 7, which only
means he was in the original picture way back when... since some of the
Sorry 7 are not Official born-in-Richland types official kinda loses its
meaning... but I won&apos;t go into that again... the big kid taught me all 
I know about trolling for sophomores as seniors... he has allowed me to
join in on many of the big kids&apos; games (paint my nose red and call me
Rudolph)... now if he only looked like Mary Lou Watkins (&apos;63) I would
really be jumpin&apos; for joy... but he cool he cool so I&apos;m very happy and
privileged to call him a pal... the kid who is since 6th grade is coming
to Vegas with a bunch of other Sorry 7s to drive some of my hot rods to 
a rock-a-billy car show out at the race track the weekend of the 13th... 
I haven&apos;t seen much of the early grade school guy since hi school but
I know he&apos;s out there being a Bomber with the rest of us... he has a
different name tho and not to pry but there are several guys who have
different last names than in school out there from several classes and
I&apos;d love to get the inside skinny on those... so since I&apos;m at a laptop
(and having a heck of a time typing on it) since my computer blew a fuse
in the office (getting someone to put in a new receptacle is kinda like
getting stuff done from the gubmint... so who knows when it will be
fixed... if not by Monday the secret electrician will fix it himself)...
I&apos;ll sign off now and wish JIMBEAUX HAMILTON (&apos;63), STEVE SIMPSON (&apos;65),
AND GEORGE ZELINSKI HORN (&apos;65) A VERY HAPPY BIRTHDAY IN THE 23rd!!!!!!!!!

Re: Party Declaration for Primary

I have lived in other states where you had to &quot;declare&quot; a party
affiliation to vote in the primary. I never did like it but I felt an
obligation to vote. In one such place I couldn&apos;t remember which party the

Re: Howard Chitty Gymnasium

At the Richland School Board meeting on June 13th, 250 signatures were
presented to start the process of naming the Carmichael Middle School gym
in honor of Howard R. Chitty. The Richland School Board has now invited
more input at their 26th September meeting.

I can&apos;t imagine any reader of the Sandstorm who hasn&apos;t heard of Mr.
Chitty. He was a Richland icon. He taught at Carmichael for 29 years
(1954-1982). He loved working with students both in and outside of 
school hours. He introduced many of us to lifetime sports such as golf,
swimming, bowling, skating and fishing. He brought both the wrestling 
and golf programs to Carmichael, coaching both of those in addition to
football, j.v. basketball and baseball. He even initiated the Letterman&apos;s
Club and ran the school store!

Outside of school, Mr. Chitty began a conservation camp for kids. And
I&apos;m sure I&apos;m not the only Bomber who learned to swim at the Chitty&apos;s
&quot;Swimland&quot;! His dedication, dynamic personality and enthusiasm touched
many of our lives. Naming the gym for him would pay tribute to a man who
dedicated his life to inspiring thousands of future Bombers.

The Chittys are now gathering letters from those of us who knew Howard
Chitty and can share how he influenced our lives. You can mail your
personal letter (before September 23rd) to:

 The Chitty Family
 1415 Judson
 Richland, WA 99354
 or email: HowardChittyGymnasium@Charter.net Those letters and messages will be presented at the School Board meeting
on September 26. Also, anyone is welcome to attend the School Board
meeting on September 26, 2006 at 8:15 PM at the Richland Administration
Office. At that time, a community committee could be formed to review
public opinion before making a recommendation to the School Board.

The Howard R. Chitty Gymnasium would commemorate more than three decades
of significant athletic contribution to the Richland community. Thanks in
advance to all of you who can take the time to remember an exceptional
teacher and coach by sending your words of endorsement.

Re: Primaries

To: All those who are concerned about &quot;picking a party&quot; in the primaries.

In Washington State we used to pick candidates for partisan offices
during the Party caucuses and not in primaries at all. The &quot;purpose&quot; 
of the Primary is to pick the candidates who will run in the General
Election where you do not have to pick a party. Some people believed 
that if all the voters could vote in a State Primary (rather than have 
to attend precinct caucuses to determine their candidate) there would be
greater voter participation in the Primary. I guess, what I&apos;m saying is,
just pick a party and VOTE! You&apos;ll have an opportunity to cross over and
choose from all the parties in the General Election if you so choose. I
know it is confusing to some people but it really does make sense, at
least to me.

Re: The Oyster Run

Sunday was the annual Oyster Run here in Anacortes and estimates of
upwards of 16,000 motorcycles were in town for the event. Man, some guys
really have a lot of money in their bikes and others just ride their
&quot;dogs&quot; but everyone has a great time. They actually BBQ oysters for the
event, (they go well with beer), thus the name. There are a couple of
events during the day but mostly it is just about seeing motorcycles,
taking to the owners, eating (anything that goes well with beer) and
having a great time. It was the usually boring Anacortes weather, upper
70s, lots of sun and no clouds and a great day to ride (and drink beer).
Lots of Canadians come down, or over, for the event, eh. The ferry from
Sidney, B.C. to Anacortes yesterday (Saturday) was full of motorcycles
from Victoria and Vancouver Island. Even saw a couple of guys I had not
seen in several years since I lived in Victoria and whom I used to ride
with (and drink beer). What is really cool is that there is not a lot of
trouble, no added police and in general just a good time. I got up at
5:00 AM to...you guess...and bikes were starting to come in that early,
or maybe they were just going home.

I used to oil up, wash up and polish up my old Harley softtail roadster
but with a broken foot, that was not going to happen so I lent it to the
neighbor kid. He had it looking like it was right off the showroom floor
in a few hours and this AM (Sunday) he was off to the event at 7:30 AM.
I told him he could have all the oysters he could eat (but no beer) 
and I would be checking him out around 11:00 AM. Folks from all over
Washington, Oregon, Idaho, British Columbia, Alberta, Alaska and
California were there. A lot of people tour the Northwest this time 
of the year and center on the Oyster Run during their travels.

Re: OK, now for the Washington State Elections mess.

The Constitution says &quot;one man, one vote&quot;, not &quot;one man, one Republican
vote&quot; or &quot;one man, one Democrat vote.&quot; What drove Washington State to do
the party line vote in the primary was a law suit by the two idiot major
parties and they made it stick with the idiot WA Supreme Court, who
couldn&apos;t pick their noses let alone make a Constitutional decision. The
two Parties did not like the cross-over voting that went on during the
Primary because they could not get a firm handle on who was for each of
them and who was not. A lot of voters simply did not vote during the
Primary, I am one, in protest of being forced to declare for one party or
another. Usually I am fairly conservative and seek out more middle-of-the-
road candidates but this time there was no middle of the road. What this
effectively does in Washington State is to control any new party or a
party that feels that the partisan politics of the GOP or Dems is not for
them, but it is coming. I am hearing of the formation of the All American
Party, or something like that, so if anyone knows anything about it, let
me know. Maybe I will start it, who knows.

Re: Primary Election

I want to make a couple of small corrections to my explanation of the
primary election in Washington State that appeared in the Sept. 23
Sandstorm:

The type of primary we had prior to this year was called a &quot;blanket
primary&quot;. The &quot;blanket primary&quot; was struck down in the State of 
Washington by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals based on a decision by 
the U.S. Supreme Court in a prior case from California.

Other than those two corrections, my explanation seemed to &quot;pass muster&quot;
with a former Attorney General of the State of Washington, and a (now
retired) prominent Seattle attorney who is very knowledgeable about the
legal case (of course being lawyers they wanted a lot more legal detail
in the explanation, but I will spare you that).

Like I said before, I hope my explanation helps you understand the change
a little better.

Re: Party Caucuses
 
Missy, sorry to differ with you, but the party caucuses were not used to
pick party candidates for office (except, indirectly, the Presidential
candidates). The way the caucus system worked, the parties held precinct
(neighborhood level) caucuses, at which anyone could participate, but had
to proclaim their allegiance (at least for that one night) to the party
holding the caucus. At these precinct caucuses, delegates would be chosen
to attend the district and/or county caucuses. Sometimes (but not always)
people that wanted to run for these delegate spots would have to proclaim
which Presidential candidate of that party they were backing. At the
district and/or county caucuses delegates would be chosen to attend the
state convention. Almost always, the people that ran for delegate to the
state convention would have to declare their preference for Presidential
candidate. Finally, delegates at the State Conventions would chose the
delegates to the National Convention, and people running for those 
spots always had to declare their Presidential preference. I know from
firsthand experience that this is how the caucus system worked, since 
I went through that very process in 1976 when I had the honor of being
elected an alternate delegate to the Republican National Convention in
Kansas City.

For all State, County, and local partisan and non-partisan races, we have
used the &quot;blanket primary&quot; system up until this year to select candidates
to run for public office in the &quot;general&quot; election in November.

There have been some efforts made here in Washington to do away with the
Caucus System to select the Parties&apos; Presidential Candidates and replace
it with a Presidential Primary, but as far as I know (and I may be
incorrect here) we will still be using the Caucus System in 2008, and
will have a primary election like the one we had this year to select each
parties&apos; candidates for all the other elected offices.

It&apos;s been interesting reading all of the entries about the &quot;blanket&quot;
primary and the party primary. The Ninth Circuit Court did rule that the
open primary was unconstitutional due to the case here in California.
When Davis was running for his second term, he was behind in the polls 
to the mayor from L.A., a Republican moderate, but ahead of another
Republican, Simon... The Democrats encouraged everyone, Republican and
Democrat to vote for the 3rd place, Simon, therefore making Davis the
favorite if he were to run against Simon. That&apos;s exactly what happened,
in a close race, many Democrats voted for Simon, the two Republicans
combined for something close to 70% of the total vote, and Simon
won... and the rest is history... Davis won handily over Simon in the
main election. So, in this case anyway, it makes sense to have a split
primary... but it is tough on us Independent voters.

Re: Your response to Missy Keeney (&apos;59) about Primary Elections

Sorry Dave. I agree with most everything you send to the Sandstorm but
you completely missed the boat on this one. You are much too young to 
use personal experience to challenge what Missy was saying. Check out the
&quot;HistoryLink.org&quot; link below for an excellent summation of the history 
of how the MAJOR PARTIES HAVE SELECTED THEIR CANDIDATES FOR THE GENERAL
ELECTIONS IN WASHINGTON STATE SINCE 1889 STATEHOOD TO PRESENT. (If the
link doesn&apos;t work, Copy&amp;Paste it into your Browser Address Box.) http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=5738 In summary, &quot;From 1890 to 1907, candidates ... were nominated by party
conventions or by petition.&quot; These laws were similar to most other states
at the time. In 1907, the State Legislature implemented a &quot;Open&quot; Primary
Election System (where Party Affiliation is disclosed at time of voting
by choosing the ballot of ONE party) to encourage the public to take over
this process from the Party Bosses. This is essentially the system we
have returned to for the last year or so after the &quot;Blanket&quot; (see
definition below) was thrown out in court. 

By definition, other Primary systems were &quot;Closed&quot; (party affiliation
must be declared at the time of Registering to Vote) and the &quot;Blanket&quot;
(able to vote for either party in each race - adopted by the Washington
State Legislature in 1935, the only state to do so until recently in 
Alaska). The point of all 3 of these systems is to select CANDIDATES for 
the General Election. The problem with the &quot;Blanket&quot; is that it is not a
system for the Parties to select their own but merely served as a kind of
&quot;Preliminary Election&quot; and allowed many abuses (deliberate &quot;cross-overs&quot;
to try&amp;select &quot;weaker&quot; candidates to run against their chosen people,
etc.). Considering the purpose of the Primary is for the PARTIES to
narrow their candidates, the only question I had for years was how the
&quot;Blanket&quot; system survived challenge as long as it did. Even more absurd
is the concept of the &quot;Top Two Blanket&quot; as if that had anything to do
with the Parties selecting their candidates for the General. In fact in
many races, Democrats would be frozen out of the General Election in
Eastern Washington and Republicans would be frozen out in King County.

rE: Elections

I am thinking that it is time to have a change to the election process.
Each office should have a box labeled &quot;None of the others&quot;. If &quot;None 
of the others&quot; wins the vote, then all the parties must choose someone 
else for their party and a new vote will be taken for those offices that 
had &quot;None of the others&quot; win the election. This could go on until the
political parties actually submitted a candidate that the voters actually
wanted to vote for. I know that in some cases, this could go on for quite
a long time (based on pasT elections) but maybe the major political
parties would get the idea and get someone to run that actually was a
good candidate.

I almost always vote in the general elections but each it is getting
harder and harder to cast a vote in some races because all the candidates
are not up to my standards. I think our political system is in crisis and
needs a major shake up.

I am glad to see the discussion about primaries. I lived in Indiana for
many years, where from time to time I was involved in managing precinct
elections and I saw the evils of an open primary system. There a voter at
the May primary asked for the ballot of one of the two parties when she
or he signed in at the polls. We knew that a lot of people selected the
ballot of a party other than the party they one normally identified with 
so they could vote for the weaker candidate and thus skew the general
election in November in favor of the person they really favored. I found
it frustrating that there was really nothing we could do about this
&quot;cross-over&quot; vote. In my opinion, a closed primary (you select the party
when you register to vote and you must change the registration in advance
of the election if you wish to vote for the other party&apos;s candidates) is
the best way to do things, as that does impact (probably not as much 
as I would hope) the ability of party bosses to control the choices of
candidates. I realize that prevents the &quot;Independents&quot; from casting a
vote, but the primary is a device for party voters to have a say on their
parties&apos; candidates, not simply a &quot;pre-election.&quot;

blankie and the school furnishes the graham crackers and milk... the 9th
Circus (if you knew some a those guys and gals you&apos;d see that wasn&apos;t a
typo)... said they were unconstitutional because not all blankies are
created equal and some kid&apos;s feelings were getting hurt because their
blankies were not as new and fresh as others and it might stunt the
growth of the little psychies of the children with the JC Penny blankies
and allow the children with the Neiman&apos;s blankies to artificially excel
over the others... as such... nobody could bring their own blankies any
more and they all hadda use official Washington State blankies issued by
the state to each school district. Naturally there was no moola in the
state budget for blankies and so the kids all hadda take naps on the cold
hard floor. As none of the children were able to have their blankies and
there was no suitable substitute... all of the children suffered from
Blankie withdrawal but did it pretty much equally so it was ok... A party
primary is kinda like a party college... like I remember Playboy used 
to vote ASU one of the highest ranking party schools in the nation... a
party primary is where the kids don&apos;t have to take naps at all... they
just lie there whispering to each other &quot;are you asleep?&quot; and giggling so
the teacher is the one who suffers in that case but since they all suffer
equally it is ok too.So... next topic...

Re: Old Motorcycles

It&apos;s funny how reading the Sandstorm brings back old memories. Things you
haven&apos;t thought about for 20-30 years or more. Usually I just smile to
myself, but after reading Ed Quigley&apos;s (&apos;62) entry about motorcycles that 
don&apos;t start, I just had to share my experience with an old Triumph. 

The summer I got home from the service I bought an old Triumph
Bonneville. Besides leaking a lot of oil, it was hard to start. It once
took me an hour and a half to get it started by pushing it up and down
the hill on Newcomer road. Not too long after I bought it, a friend 
called and asked me to go on a ride with him next Saturday morning. When 
he said that he wanted to start at 6am I knew I could never get my bike
running in time, so I told him I wouldn&apos;t go. I must have got my arm
twisted pretty good because I reluctantly said I would go. That Friday
night I started pushing the bike down Newcomer until it started. I rode
it up into our backyard, filled it up with gas and let it run all night
long. The next morning it was still running and we had a great ride. A
few weeks later I sold it to a kid in Kennewick. 

Triumphs were notorious for leaking oil. There was a joke that you could
take a clean fresh block of steel, stamp the letters &quot;Triumph&quot; into it
and oil would leak out of it. I never thought that was very funny, but I
have to admit it wasn&apos;t far from the truth.

Hey Bombers, just wanted to say thank you to all who sent me information
about where to live in the great Northwest! I will keep that information, 
be in touch and who knows maybe some day we will join you in that area.

I wanted to let everyone know just in case you missed it that while I 
was up in Washington I picked up the Premier Issue of the Mid-COLUMBIAN. 
A brand new magazine about Eastern Washington. It had several stories on 
the Richland area and the mailing address to order it is none other than 
West Richland. It is

 KIONA Publishing, Inc., P.O. Box 5605, West Richland, WA 99353-4027

Just thought with all the wonderful Bomber stories out there and how many
of you love to write that you wouldn&apos;t want to miss this read and write!

Well, Well, Me thinks that one great person has finally got the whole
thing right on the primary problem... Hurray for David, no offense to
anyone, but I thinks David&apos;s address on the whole subject seems to be 
the correct one. Everyone seems to think that we all cheat when it comes 
to voting, me thinks that!!!!!! Just like the Washington Supreme court 
and there decision on unions and the money that they spend without a vote 
of the members. Uh, Oh we got another subject if anyone wants to chime

other bikes... So here&apos;s my two cents. There is nothing that compares
with the sounds Harleys make... that rumbling sound... and then that
screaming eagle sound... and of course for us Harley babes, there is
nothing like the vibrations... need I say more?? Good... good... good

My husband and I have been married 21 years, 20 of which we&apos;ve been
hauling his Triumph and his Harley around wherever we move even though
they don&apos;t work. My 13-year-old son has been hearing his father promise
to take him for a ride on the Harley when he &quot;fixes it this Spring/
Summer/Fall&quot; because &quot;that&apos;s my next project.&quot; I&apos;m sure my son will be 
buying his own motorcycle (preferably a brand that runs) before he ever 
gets to ride on his dad&apos;s Harley. Well, I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll be blasted by all 
you Harley-lovers out there, but my experience with them hasn&apos;t been 
very good!

Re: Patti Crigler Cole (&apos;59) and her Harley

I can attest to Patti&apos;s expertise on her &quot;never fail&quot; Harley... Carl and 
I rode with her and Billy to the Mid-Atlantic reunions a couple of years
ago and there was neither a problem with her bike nor Billy&apos;s. They
always started up and stopped on command. Of course at my age, a three
wheeled Gold Wing Honda is the way to go... and keep upright. There is 
an after manufacture accessory that can make a Gold Wing &quot;sound like&quot; a
Harley. We passed that one up, too expensive, but it was tempting! Can 
you picture it???? Two old duffers on a trike coming along side a 
rumbling Harley Hog and switching on their &quot;Harley&quot; exhaust system?? 
Kazooooom! Rumble Rumble! Imagine the look on that Harley riders face! 
Oh well, maybe he wouldn&apos;t even hear it...

Re: Big Screen Movies

I seldom go to see movies in theaters anymore. Generally, I&apos;ll wait until
they&apos;re available on VHS or DVD. But, every so often, a movie comes along
that just begs to be seen on the &quot;Big Screen.&quot; &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; 
and &quot;Open Range (among a few others),&quot; made my personal list for that
category. I added another one to that list, this past weekend. It was so
good, in my opinion, that I went to see it again today.

It&apos;s called, &quot;Flyboys,&quot; and is based upon the true story of the
Layfeyette Escadrille of WW I, the name that the French gave to a unit of
American flyers. Those flyers voluntarily came to fly for France, prior
to the U. S. entering the war. It is well done. Even the special effects
are pretty realistic. But then, how many Nieuports and Fokker Triplanes
are still around for use in a film? Now, I like flying and I like to read
true accounts of aerial combat. So, even though it is &quot;Hollywood,&quot; it
gives a visual experience of what those Knights of the Air went through
flying wood and fabric (with no parachute) in the infant days of flight.
Oh, and there is a bit of a love story that fits nicely. I&apos;m no critic,
but I give it two thumbs up (since I only have two). 

Re: Want to try shooting?

On another subject for those of you living in or near the Tri-Cities,
there will be an &quot;Open House&quot; at the Rattlesnake Mountain Shooting
Facility this Saturday 9/30 from 9:00am -- 3:00pm. It is sponsored by the
Tri-Cities Shooting Association in association with Benton County Parks.
The TCSA Ranges are located on highway 225 between Benton City and Horn
Rapids Dam Park. If you or your family members like to shoot rifles,
pistols, or shotguns (or would like to learn how to), all shooting
disciplines will be up and running. There will be a hunter sight-in at
the High Power Range, trap shooting, regular shooting at the Rose Iris
Public Range, a cowboy action shooting match, shooting of .22 rifles 
at our plinking range (bring your own or use ours), Mountain Man
muzzle loader shooting, and practical pistol shooting. There will be free
demonstrations, shooting, prizes, and refreshments. And, there will be a
drawing for a chance at five free memberships and five gift baskets! I
will be the Range Officer on the trap range. For more information go to http://www.tcsa.info/ -George &quot;Pappy&quot; Swan (&apos;59) ~ Burbank, WA where now I lay me down to sleep

New form of primaries: Voting equipment: a pasture large enough to lay
flat enough placards (of identical size and shape) one each for all or
any prospective candidates. Better yet let the candidates themselves be
confined laying (so they couldn&apos;t move either into or away from the
line of fire thus skewing the results) in the pasture. Then let loose a
recently overfed cow, horse, goat, whatever; (except donkeys or elephants
because of the obvious party affiliations) into the pasture. Letting
nature take it&apos;s course the winners and losers would be chosen in a truly
unbiased process. Now comes the difficult choice: are the candidates that
are first hit on the regular ballot or eliminated. There are several
schools of thought on this very subject. Surely there is a court
somewhere that would probably love to make a determination on the
constitutionality of a hit or a miss. The smell would, however, remain
as sweet. 

I know, where was I in 1776 when this kind of critical thinking was
sorely needed. I must have been doing something else.

I had to laugh when I read Shawn Schuchart Mabley&apos;s (78) little blurb 
on dragging around her husband&apos;s things that don&apos;t work. I share your
frustration, Shawn, as we have hauled around a l931 (I believe) Model A
that hasn&apos;t run since l984, if memory serves me right, and have even paid
for covered space to keep it in, when it wasn&apos;t available in our garage.
It sits there now under it&apos;s canvas cover, so people can keep asking what
is under that cover I guess. And I don&apos;t even hear getting it running
under my husband&apos;s current list of &quot;to do&quot; projects... need I say more.

Re: Motorcycles

Ok Ok I have had enough, where did all you guys get your scooters, I have
been riding since I was 14 we started in the shelter belt with a Hodaka
90 and rode all over the place. When and if I had a bike that wouldn&apos;t
run I or my Dad fixed it and off I went. My wife and I now ride all over
on our old Harley and we have NEVER walked home, we have broken down once
or twice but here is the interesting part about scooters, in over 40
years of riding I can&apos;t ever remember being broke down and having another
rider pass me by, it does not matter where I have been they always stop
and help you get going. I ride a Harley and have been helped by Honda and
BMW riders before, likewise I have helped many a rider of any make bike.
Ask yourself when the last time you stopped for a broken down car on the
road!!!! All bikers are somehow tied by a special bond that unless you
ride you will never know or understand and Harley Riders are the cream of
the crop when it comes to helping. Here in Denver area we have Banditios
and H.A. and Sons of Silence and all famous for there deeds but they will
all stop to help a fellow rider every time!!!! P.S. did you know that
bikers give more $ and gifts to charity than ANY other group in the USA,
just a side note.

Re: Motorcycles
 
Larry, you are so right about motorcyclists helping each other. My mother
and I were in North Carolina visiting grandkids several years ago when I
had a bad flat tire (on the car!). Got the spare on, but couldn&apos;t drive
back to Virginia on the spare. It was late on a Saturday afternoon and we
were to leave for Virginia the next morning. We went to a tire shop...
the only one in town. They were really busy and the guy told me there 
was no way they could help me until Monday until he saw my Harley bumper
sticker. He asked if I rode a Harley and I said &quot;Yep!&quot; He put me ahead of
everyone else and I was out of there in an hour. Moral of the story: Get
a Harley bumper sticker whether you ride or not!

You&apos;re also right that LOUD pipes save lives!!! We have seen deer pay
Hondas no never mind when they pass, but when a Harley passes with the
loud pipes, they take off!

Re: Motorcycles. . .

Well, Linda McKnight Hoban (&apos;65) mentioned the sound of a Harley, and I
have to admit that I&apos;ve never owned one, but HAVE definitely &quot;lusted&quot;
after that &quot;sound&quot;, ever since seeing &quot;The Wild One&quot; starring Marlon
Brando, back in 1954 at the Village Theater, for 12 (consequently, the
same movie that instilled in me a love of leather jackets!)! In a fit of
madness once, I even contemplated toting a boom box with the sound of a
Harley blasting out of it. I got my first piece of &quot;jap scrap&quot;, a 125 cc
Honda CB92R, the summer of my senior year ($400 or so), and immediately
replaced the mufflers with a set of megaphones that you could hear for
blocks! I&apos;ve had a bike of one flavor or another, most of my life. The
ONLY time I&apos;ve been road-sided was a few years ago when I got a new tire
in Kennewick, and they installed the wrong size inner tube, pinching it
between the tire and the rim, and causing a blow out at 60 mph, west of
Prosser; thank God it was the REAR tire, as there were 2 up, and I think
it added a few grey hairs to both of our heads (only on the sides of
mine, darn it!), and I came pretty close to needing a change of
underwear. . . Nothing like being on a bike that suddenly starts acting
like a snake! Until the Harley step-up to the Evolution engine, back
in the &apos;90s (?) though, I&apos;m pretty sure that their showrooms were the
ONLY showrooms that I&apos;d ever been in, where BRAND NEW bikes had cardboard
under them, to catch the oil leaks!

As for the biker brotherhood, Larry Crouch (&apos;71) is right; everybody
pretty much seems to be willing to lend a hand to others when problems
occur. And I still love both getting and giving &quot;salutes&quot; from other
bikers! Do you remember the &quot;You meet the nicest people on a Honda!&quot; ad
campaign that pretty much transformed the biker image, back in the &apos;70s? 

By the way, do any of you happen to know when the Annual Antique
Motorcycle Event on Vashon Island takes place?
