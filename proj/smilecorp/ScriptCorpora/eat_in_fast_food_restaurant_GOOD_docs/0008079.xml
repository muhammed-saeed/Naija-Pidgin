Onward with Reverse: Private reverse mortgages Published on: Jul 31 2011 - 11:56pm Where about 98 percent of all reverse mortgages are done through reverse mortgage specialty companies and are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), a few are done by mortgage companies without the FHA guarantee.

When I started school, all those years ago, I was registered in first grade since there was no kindergarten. My mother was required, as were all, to present my birth certificate to be sure that I was six years old. It wasn’t a question of citizenship—only age. I went to three elementary schools and three high schools all in Kentucky, Tennessee and Alabama. At each transfer my records went with me to place me in...

High Desert SingersSierra JazzDave Perry, Director Our View: Does AYP matter anymore? Published on: Jul 31 2011 - 8:04pm The natural reaction to news that almost one-half of the school districts in the area failed to meet the federal Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) standard is disappointment.
Let the wailing and nashing of teeth begin.
Cynics will point the results as more evidence that young people today are failing us. That they spend more time on Facebook than doing their Algebra homework. They will argue that teachers aren’t doing their job and...

Commentary: Social Security is not the young paying to support the old Published on: Jul 31 2011 - 6:37pm With dismaying regularity, the would-be subverters of Social Security charge that the system is nothing more than a federal government-run Ponzi scheme that makes Bernie Madoff look like an amateur. They typically claim that, once retirees recover whatever they and their employers have contributed over the years, Social Security pays retirees with money taxed away from the actively employed. And they allege the vicious cycle will continue when...

It began as the ‘morning star’ in Palominas Published on: Jul 31 2011 - 12:38am Early every day, 21-years ago, when the large 7-Up sign would light up outside the Trading Post in Palominas, neighbors knew Brenda and Matthew Pratt were open for business.
The brightly lit sign was the“morning star”that brought friends and customers to the restaurant for great food and a daily revival of barbs and banter highlighting the start of another day.
On Aug. 2, 1991, the lighted sign was replaced by a dinner...

A quote taken out of context is a strategy of the Left Published on: Jul 31 2011 - 12:01am There is a strategy of the far Left today to discredit and to marginalize legitimate words and deeds, turning a legitimate story into an illegitimate story. The goal is to win at all cost. Recently a statement I made to an Arizona Capitol Times reporter that was intentionally marginalized and twisted by a far left blogger. The Arizona Daily Star picked up the marginalized and twisted quote and used it; portraying it in its illegitimate form. The...

The intrusion of yet another Charter-Presidio de las Sierras, prompts me to respond to the flyer sent to all city residents.
Charter schools have diluted, and in many cases, absconded with funds public schools could dearly use to educate all students. The Berean Academy fiasco is only the latest in several cases of funds stolen from public education. Charters are not public schools, but take public...

The Herald’s July 19 editorial titled“Prayer rally is too exclusive and too political”was highly disappointing.

The politics of American intelligence Published on: Jul 11 2011 - 12:01am Back on June 26 the Herald published my guest opinion about how one can unmask politicians who are presumptive liars, dullards, or ignoramuses. One clue is they keep talking about“common sense.”I argued, mostly through example, that no such thing exists unmoored from a specific context, such as age, education, socio-economic status, religious belief (or disbelief), and so on.
