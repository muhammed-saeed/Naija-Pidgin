As the name implies, this place makes Greek and Italian food. I don&apos;t particularly like Greek food, so I can&apos;t comment other than saying that I see lots of Greek people there... so I guess the food is good.

However, that is during the day. At night, it is a sit-down restaurant. The restaurant has zero atmosphere. It has metal, formica-topped tables and booths with pleather seating. It... More
