 A small town in Germany? 

 Advantages: Compact, cultured, loads to do
 Disadvantages: Limited&quot;old town&quot;, some may find it lacking vitality


...elements and a focus on how West Germany developed in the post war years. It may sound a little stuffy but its not; of all the museums in Bonn this is probably the best one to take children to. It&apos;s fun and varied and highly enjoyable.

We broke up our days sightseeing with numerous stops for drinks and for lunch. Bonn has a diverse restaurant scene with the area around the August Macke Museum being full of Chinese, Indian and Turkish restaurants. Closer to the centre there are the usual fast food joints but also a good number of traditional eateries; they can be a little pricey and the set menus are the best value. Basically if you see a group of businessmen going somewhere for lunch it should be a good bet. The menu will have a choice of starters and main courses as well as a daily pudding; there should be something for everyone...

...The Mint Restaurant - Essential Information

16 Academy Street 
Coatbridge
Lanarkshire
ML5 3AU

01236 441191
www.navantaverns.com

The Mint Restaurant is part of the Navan Tavern Group of restaurants. This group offers two restaurants in Glasgow, one in Motherwell (my home town) and The Mint. The Mint is located up a side street from the main shopping area of Coatbridge. Street parking is available. It is very easy to find if you know your way around Coatbridge. The exterior of the restaurant is homely and welcoming.

The Mint is a family run establishment and they claim to offer home cooked food in a stylish and relaxed environment. The restaurants has a function room upstairs which offers tribute evenings and meals. They also cover weddings and other events. The main restaurant is accessed via a ramp and the inside...

Review of Mint Restaurant &amp;Bar, Coatbridge 
 
   Harvester Restaurants 

 Advantages: Always one close by, quick turn out, children are welcome and catered for.
 Disadvantages: Toilets can be quite disturbing, not all dishes taste as good they are described.


...Harvester Restaurants

Restaurant Reviewed: Stag and Hounds
Winchester Road
 Basingstoke 
Hampshire 
(next to Comet and Home Base)


The Harvester chain of Restaurants have over 2000 outlets across the United Kingdom and owned and operated by Mitchells and Butlers, who claim to be the UK&apos;s leading operator of managed pubs, bars and restaurants. Harvester claim to offer healthy eating, drinking and entertainment in one reasonably priced outlet. 

**** Parking and Getting a Table *****

As with most of the Harvester&apos;s I have visited, there is usually ample free parking at the rear of the establishment. However on Saturday evenings and Sunday lunch times these places are heaving with customers, so avoid the crowds, go early and if possible ring and reserve a table. The Stag and Hounds is no exception but fortunately...
