What is your let&apos;s-save-the-environment practice?
 This year Earth Hour is on Saturday, 27th March, 2010 between 8:30 pm and 9:30 pm. But trying to save the environment is not restricted to just one hour. Surely, most of you religiously follow tips to help conserve energy and natural resources. At our Yahoo! office in Bangalore, we religiously switch off lights in areas that we do not currently use. How do you protect the earth?

 Best Answer - Chosen by Asker
 ~I use both sides of the paper and don&apos;t waste it
~if I see a running tap, I close it
~I&apos;ve a few potted plants, whom I care for
~We are gradually installing energy efficient appliances in our home
~We make it a point that no light or fan is left opened when not in use
~When its time to use air conditioners, then we make it a point that no doors or windows are left opened and also that no one keeps on entering or exit-ing the room frequently
~Whenever possible we open the glass windows and wooden doors, and let the netted doors closed, this way room becomes airy w/o letting in mosquitoes
~Cleanliness is maintained in our house because in an unclean room it feels rather more to open AC
~We make it a point that no round of washing machine goes waste, i mean we not let 5-6 clothes to be washed in a machine having the capacity to wash 20 clothes
~instead of using a shower or bath tub, bathing with bucket is muck more sustainable, because recycling that water consumes a lot of energy

 I adopted very simple but very effective lifestyle practice that can be used by others&amp;by all.

&quot;CONSUME LESS&quot;

Whatever I do, I try to consume less (misuse less)- in this way I save money&amp;health for me&amp;environment for my kid.
Some example-
During every work I try to reduce my consumption-
-less toothpaste, less shampoo&amp;soap, room temperature water for bath in the morning,
-more raw vegetables, sprouted seeds&amp;salads in food (saves fuel),
-whenever possible walk more,
-during driving- I keep moderate speed&amp;low AC or off AC- whenever possible,
-in office- less electricity (AC, fan, light), less use of stationary (I&apos;m using my pen since it&apos;s price was half of the present price),
-before taking buying decisions for new gadgets- I first try to get old one repaired or exchange it for new (my present cellphone is obsolete model but still working perfectly).
-usually refuse plastic bags during shopping, (I carry my own plastic bag&amp;reuse it as many times as possible),
- I try to go to bed early&amp;keep AC&amp;fan at moderate settings or off (if possible).
- Now a days I&apos;m trying to reduce number of my cloths.

DECLARATION - I&apos;m a doctor by profession- My lifestyle is my choice not compulsion; but to save the health (my health, mother earth&apos;s health along with my patients health) is my compulsion.

 I do it everyday, i play my part by choosing the BMTC bus as my option instead of picking up my bike for my college. But, i don&apos;t think we can make any change until we together make an effort to change our habits. In out Bangalore, most of the office going people prefer to go by their own car where they could use the Bus but they prefer their class and standard as a higher priority. Because of this we can see a great increase in the number of cars on the roads resulting in increase in the emission of gases harmful for the environment rest is covered by our traffic jams because of the constructions of the Metro&apos;s tracks and flyovers there too there is hardly sm1 who cares for switching off their engine when they are struck in traffic or on a traffic signal. We cannot change anything until we realize that problem is not with others but within us.

 to save energy is not ! hour program but yes its a brilliant step initiated.
my current practices are:
1. minimal use of plastic bags in kitchen&amp;toilets.
2. i have minimized use of my vehicle. i prefer walking with an umbrella to near by areas both day&amp;night.
3. using recycled papers that r available in market for paper work.

these are the serious things i am pursuing other than thinking off.

 I recycle, use reusable cloth shopping bags, switch off lights when not in use, and if I go to a fast food restaurant and want to sit down and eat, I don&apos;t put a plastic lid on my drink. I think today I&apos;ll take my own coffee cup to work so I don&apos;t use a throw-away paper one. I also set a bookmark to therainforestsite.com (link below) so I remember to click every day.

 I have had energy efficient T-5 lighting installed in several hundred thousand square feet of space owned by our company. In terms of quirky personal habits, I am a water nut: I turn off the water when brushing my teeth and when soaping up in the shower (unless the bathroom is cold!).

 Earth ? Now its a tough question. Because...we were too late to protect the earth. Only we have the chance to reduce the effects of co2 emissions. what Copenhagen did? Nothing Developed countries blamed the developing countries. we blame the developed countries. US blame the reason for India and china.But in survey19.5% of co2 emission was created in USA and next is Europeans. But if u take India(110 million )and China (120 million) have population. But the co2 emission rate is 4.5 (India) and 4.6(China). Why they are blaming us??
Before solution, first we make awareness regs global warming and other hazards..first is awareness....we don&apos;t want experience....we need change...but one thing is sure i said..we(this generation) see the end of .......... So be prepare and be updated...for those things...still i think or search the solution.... not only me....god..tooooooooooo......

 I like to go door to door collecting all the polystyrene in the neighborhood and on Earth Day I pile it up and burn it in my back yard. All the neighborhood kids race over to my house just roast marsh mellows on the open fire. Someone always brings a few old tires and waste oil, just for fun.

 Getting Biofuels Right Factsheet

Turn off appliances when you are not using them. Up to 30% of power used by TV&apos;s is used while they are turned off, so buy power strips and just flip the switch on the power strip, because they use far less energy while turned off.

Lower the thermostat by a few degrees in winter. An extra layer or blanket will not only keep you cozy but will help to reduce your electricity bill significantly.

Install ceiling fans instead of air conditioning units to keep rooms comfortable in warm weather.


Keep windows and doors closed properly to avoid the loss of heat in winter.
Open the windows in summer. The cross breeze will often keep you cool and flushes out stale air (indoor air is often more highly polluted than the air outside). Importantly, the use of fresh air to cycle through your home saves the cost of running an air conditioner.


Switch to compound fluorescent lightbulbs. They last longer and consume one-quarter of the energy. Lately, LED lamps have started to pick up the pace too -- they are up to ten times as effective as fluorescent, and totally blow incandescent bulbs off the charts.

Turn off the lights. Always turn off the lights when you are not using them. Rooms that are lit with nobody in them are wasteful.

Buy rechargeable batteries for devices used frequently.

Avoid Creating Trash. Avoid disposable products, such as plates, cups, napkins and cutlery. Use reusable towels and dishwashing cloths in place of paper towels and disposable dish sponges.

Prefer showers over baths. Showers use less water. Don&apos;t forget to install an efficient showerhead.

Use soaps and detergents that contain no phosphates. Use a mixture of water and vinegar to wash your windows. Wash clothes in cold water to avoid consuming energy to heat the water. On sunny days, use a clothes line instead of a clothes dryer. Your clothes will smell fresher and the sun&apos;s rays ensure that germs are successfully sizzled.

Install low-flush toilets in your home. These use 1.6 gallons per flush, instead of 3.5 gallons, cutting water consumption by more than half.

Use recycled paper in your home office and printer. Double side your printing and give scrap paper to the kids or turn it into note paper for the phone table.

Turn off the computer every day. Even if it feels like it is not making much of a difference, it is. You also reduce any risks of overheating or shortcircuiting by turning computers off overnight.

Plant native species. They need less watering, are hardier (hence, less products needed to protect them) and they attract the local wildlife.

Compost. Compost the kitchen scraps and create beautiful garden matter to encourage better plant growth. Make sure the heap is warm and well-turned. Read a few books about composting. It&apos;s rare to find someone highly skilled in the area! Remember, soil is a living thing, it should not be powdery and dead. Life comes from the soil, and therefore the soil should be kept alive. Avoid highly invasive tilling if at all possible, but be sure to keep the soil aerated.

Buy a fuel-efficient car if you are changing cars. Choose a compact car over an SUV. SUVs burn almost twice the amount of gas as a station wagon and yet can still carry around the same amount of passengers.

If you&apos;re really serious about going all-out green, consider living without a car -- not only it&apos;s green, but could also save you a lot of money!
