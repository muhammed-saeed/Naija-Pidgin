Top 10 Worst Fart-Producing Foods

​ Farts stink, they certainly do,
the more that you smell em&apos;, the worser for you,
the more you release em&apos;, the better you feel,
so be sure to fart after every meal.

Here&apos;s our Top 10 list of the worst fart producing foods on the planet.

​ 
 10. French Food 

Sure the French gave us the Statue of Liberty, but that doesn&apos;t mean they don&apos;t secretly hate America.

All those sauces on the plate may end up sauces in your pants.

 Cheesy French onion soup , steak and fries, mushrooms, frog legs, fatty duck, goose liver, butter snails, tripe a la mode...Never take a date to a French restaurant unless they really like your ass.

Literally.









 
 
​ 
 9. Smoked Oysters In A Can 

First of all, these are canned in cottonseed oil , an industrially produced food type product valued for its cheapness that can also be found in mayonnaise and crisco.

In many cases, the oysters are farm raised, which sounds nice, but is ugly when it comes to the amount of oyster shit they&apos;re swimming in. Welcome to fart city.

​ 8. Collard Greens With Ham Hocks and Bacon 

This one is delicious, but deadly. Collards are a bitter, fiber-intense super green that have a very distinkt smell when you cook them.

Add on some fatty meats and you&apos;ve got the recipe for building your own fartopolis.

​ 7. Biscuits and Gravy 

Some say that gravy originated in ancient Egypt. What do you think Tut&apos;s revenge was when they opened his tomb? A 3,000 year old fart.

 Gravy is something like a thickened, semi-liquid version of everything that causes farts in the first place, concentrated, and lumpy.

Sop it up.

​ 6. Brazilian Rodizio or Churrascaria 

These all you can eat meat fests include items like steak wrapped in bacon, turkey wrapped in bacon, and maybe even bacon wrapped in bacon.

Servers magically appear tableside whenever you run out of food and restock your plate. They cut the meat directly off a giant skewer.

Eating more than your fill is encouraged and sides like salad, rice and beans, pineapple, and cooked bananas keep everything moving.

On the way home, drive with the windows down. The burps and farts from a night out like this may be with you for days.

I had been craving collards every night for about a week. God, I had no idea the fumes they could create! Unfortunately my new boss found out. I paralyzed her! I think she was too embarrassed to tell anyone that she had been pooted upon! But she stopped talking! LMAO
 
This is such a good article. Taught me a lot about farting, food and other things. Who ever wrote this should get a pay raise.
 
The loudest and longest I ever farted was after consuming a Fiber One bar.
 
EW EW EW girls shouldn&apos;t fart
 
I must tell you b4 you read this...I wasn&apos;t trying to find this article...I was looking for something else...&amp;stumled upon it, it is GOOD (FUNNY) reading though...LOL 
ENJOY ! Hee, hee, hee =))
 
Thanks, Dustin.
 
Brazilian Rodizio looks awesome. I gotta get me some of that.
 
NEVER eat five corn-on-the-cobs. Farts cease being funny when you are crippled with gas.
 
lol, I just love good ole fart producing foods.

The omnipotent fart bomb... for those friends who really need to suffer the wrath!!!!
Instructions:
1) Prime the mortar...drink plenty of beer the night before, low end domestic will suffice.
2) The explosive: half dozen (or more) pickled eggs from a gas station
3) Ignition source: undercooked baked beans 4 hours prior to contact with target
4) Unleash the gates of hell...
* Scent...for a disturbing twist, consume amino acids or protein shakes w/eggs

you can prevent farts from chickpeas/hummus if you make it yourself! it is the husk/shell of the bean that makes you fart. So, boil the beans for about 20 minutes, then pour half the juices into a measuring cup and the rest out. Rinse the beans in cold water in a colander, then take up handfuls and scrub between your hands -- the husks should slip right off! Drop the scrubbed ones into a clean bowl, and repeat until you&apos;ve done. You don&apos;t have to get ALL of them, though; as long as most of them are removed, you should be ok.
 
A-damn-men sister!
 
Yes I do agree on French Onion soup. Pizza definately. Cheese Fries (aka Chaze Froys) from Outback Steakhouse are hell on the gut. All those potato starches + cheese + the bacon bits + the ranch-dressing dip = hot&amp;steamy for the entire evening.
 
CHICKPEAS!!! They&apos;re the worst!
 
I don&apos;t buy this. Where did they come up with these? Very few of them sync up with personal experience. Maybe it depends on the person. 

Tofu and soy milk definitely give me some of the worst gas esp. if I eat it often. Brussel Sprouts, cauliflower, and broccoli not on there?
And I think many of the things listed cause gas when eaten in excess. Greenbean casserole? Never had a problem with it. Curry? I think it is the lentils or garbonzos--Oh there&apos;s another guaranteed fart food!
 
Who eats any of this?
 
A MI ME GUSTA TIRARME MUUUCHOS PEOS,LO MEJOR ES DESAHOGAR LOS INTESTINOS!!!
 
Beans, bananas, boiled eggs, and BEER! Oh yeah, and pizza!
 
Only starches and sugars cause gas. I saw it on manswers. Since I&apos;ve been doing Atkins I never fart, except when it&apos;s just about time to drop a deuce. But on my cheat days if I eat potatoes, mashed, fried, sweet etc, I fart non-stop. If I drink milk? Clear the room!!!!
 
lol rapeseed oil.... but on a lighter note, There are proper ways to extract essential oils from your product that is less damaging to your product, without using heat but still pressing.cold water ice extractions filtered through a set of different micron screens.
 
French food is the best food I can think of. I eat it as much as I can as often as I can. Can&apos;t tell you it makes me fart more. That is rubbish. Dig
 
&quot;Steak and Fries&quot;is Belgian Cuisine, not French.
 
Nice article!!! But you forgot the&quot;nuts&quot;: whole nut, macadamia nut, peanuts, pitacchio, almond, cashew, chestnut, coconut, pecan etc.
Also, everything&quot;whole&quot;is very fart-inclined: whole (brown) rice, whole wheat, etc.
 
Basically don&apos;t eat anything.....american , french,brazilian,indian ...hmm what esle??
 
Search:&quot;I&apos;m a vegetarian (but I eat meat)&quot;
 
...the Top Ten BEST, don&apos;t you mean?
 
After leaving Fogo De Chao (spelling?), I was called&quot;stinky mon&quot;by a cab driver. Why I chose not to put down the window first while we were sitting in traffic is beyond me. I died a little inside with that comment, as true as it may have been.
 
its crazy the tofu bias out there - aint that farty tim. try a steak for farts
 
You missed out tofu... that stuff is like distilled farts.
 
French food in general? Now that&apos;s a bias that you have, idiot.
 
I think I speak for everybody when I say,&quot;Who the fuck eats pickled eggs from a gas station!?&quot;
 
This is the best post to ever grace the pages of this blog. Hilarious! Though it is not a food, I&apos;d like to add Guinness to the list. I drank about 8 of them last night before hopping a flight from LAX to Newark early this morning. I thought I could bury a fart in my airplane seat without it escaping at 10,000+ feet. I was wrong and everyone within a 5-8 row blast radius paid a heavy price for that miscalculation.
 
All those sauces on the plate may end up sauces in your pants. HA

this is GENIUS.
 
Jacob this article rates a ten. Morgan Spurlock could not do better with a Supersize fart book. Please keep the tens a gas by bringing to the public&apos;s attention that farts are a cause of global mourning.

Thank you for describing cottonseed oil accurately:&quot;industrially produced food type product,&quot;or as Michael Pollan might say,&quot;an edible food-like substance.&quot;If we stopped consuming so many industrially processed oils like corn oil, cottonseed oil, rapeseed oil, and soybean oil, we&apos;d be a much healthier nation. These oils are all extracted using hexane in a high-heat and high-pressure environment, turning them into rancid trans fats that are unhealthy for us. Industrial processors have to bleach and deodorize the oils with more chemicals after extraction just so we don&apos;t wretch from the stench. 

Let&apos;s return to the wisdom of native cultures and consume cold- and expeller-pressed oils like extra virgin olive oil, coconut oil, and avocado seed oil.
