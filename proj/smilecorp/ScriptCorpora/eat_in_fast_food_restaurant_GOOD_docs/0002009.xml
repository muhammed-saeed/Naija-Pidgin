Easy way to &quot;go paperless?&quot; Maybe for you but not me

Published: Monday, January 16, 2012, 2:20 PM   Updated: Monday, January 16, 2012, 2:27 PM 
 By Brad Flory | bflory2@mlive.com The Jackson Citizen Patriot 
 Follow 7 Share close Digg Stumble Upon Fark Reddit Share Email Print Saturday&apos;s column about refusing to &quot;go paperless&quot; by receiving bills over the Internet instead of in the mail brought a helpful suggestion from several readers. 
 &quot;Sign up to have your bills paid automatically,&quot; these people said. &quot;The money comes out of your bank account and you don&apos;t have to do a thing.&quot; 
 This may work fine for many people, but not me. 
 It&apos;s not that I distrust Discover Card and the phone company and Consumers Energy. The problem is, I do not trust myself. 
 Mostly, I don&apos;t trust myself to have enough cash in my checking account when creditors automatically help themselves. Secondarily, when I do have money in the bank, I do not trust myself to notice how much they remove until I overdraw the account. 
 For me, automatic bill-paying would not be easy. It would be a prescription for bounce fees. I imagine I am not alone.
