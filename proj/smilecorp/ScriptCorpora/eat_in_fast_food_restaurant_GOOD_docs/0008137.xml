The High Cost of Fast Food Convenience
 June 6th, 2009• Related • Filed Under •by trisha  Filed Under: 1 Tags: calories • diet • fast food • healthy menu items • spending Tweet 
 When fast food first came on the scene, it offered consumers an easy, convenient and affordable dining alternative. This billion dollar industry has grown and evolved over the years offering much more than the traditional hamburger and french fries. Americans have long had a love affair with fast food, however it is a trend that may see change in the future. Two areas where consumers are becoming increasingly vigilant in their lives include finance and health. The following information regarding the fast food industry may come as a surprise to some consumers looking to improve their health or curb unnecessary spending.

Fast food franchises have not ignored consumer demands and have made the effort toward healthier menu options.

 Processed food. Regardless of their best intentions, the huge demand for fast food items prevents most franchises from providing fresh food made to order (regardless of their marketing). Almost all of the items you purchase at a fast food restaurant is processed. In order to maintain consistency throughout the franchise, food is prepared in gigantic factors and then distributed to different locations. Since much of the flavor is destroyed in processing, they then have to add artificial additives to give the food taste. For consumers trying to watch their waistline or just eat healthier, fast food can sabotage your best efforts. Of course moderation is key to a healthier lifestyle so one trip to the drive through will not wreak havoc on your diet, however one trip per week or more could certainly have a negative impact. It is believed over consumption of fast food is contributing to the growing number child and adult obesity in our nation. Chicken has long been thought to be a healthy alternative, however unless you avoid fried chicken it actually has more calories and fat than burgers. Considering the huge popularity of chicken nuggets and children, parents should consider how much fast food their kids are eating. Fast food restaurants will likely include calorie information in the future to those who want to know how many calories are in the items they are eating. Until then you can always go to your favorite fast food chain’s website to find nutritional information or inquire at the store. Remember portion control as well when dining out. Most meals in the US, fast food meals included are simply much larger than you need. Avoid super sizing and eat only until you are full. 

It is unlikely that Americans will give up their love affair with fast food, however consumers should make the effort to educate themselves about what they are eating. Nutritional information is readily available if you are willing to look. While it may be easy and convenient to hit the drive through for lunch or a take home dinner, it could cost your health in the long run if you are not paying attention to what you eat.

Now that you know what to look for when ordering you have a bigger question to consider.  Is it worth it to pay more money for food that is potentially unhealthy?  We are all looking for ways to save money and with many menu items (dollar menu excluded) rising upward in price, one must consider if grabbing a meal at the drive through is actually better than just buying the ingredients to prepare a nice dinner at home.  Some areas of the country are reporting the cost of going to a fast food restaurant close to $10 per person, meaning a family of four will spend $30-$40 for fast food.

Choose you menu items carefully, avoid over consumption and alternate between fast food and other dining options to reduce your out-of-pocket costs and negative health consequences.
