Howdy, HG! 

   

Do you know the nutrition info on the iced coffee drinks at McDonald&apos;s? They are so good, but I&apos;m afraid they have tons of calories hidden in them. 

   

Thank You!

Hi there, McCoffee! 

   

 I have received soooo many emails about these iced coffee drinks. And, truth be told, I hadn&apos;t even heard of them or seen them. That&apos;s because they&apos;re a test item and their availability is limited (and we don&apos;t have them in L.A.). The McDonald&apos;s website doesn&apos;t list nutritionals for them, so I called one of my pals who works for Mickey D&apos;s to get the lowdown on these things. Here&apos;s the scoop; the Iced Cream Coffee has 220 calories/11g fat for the 32 oz. and 160 calories/8g fat for the 24 oz., the Iced Hazelnut Cream Coffee has 200 calories/11g fat for the 32 oz. and 150 calories/8g fat for the 24 oz., and finally, the Iced Vanilla Cream Coffee has 220 calories/11g fat for the 32 oz. and 180 calories/8g fat for the 24 oz. They&apos;re not exactly low-cal or low-fat, but even 24 ounces (the smaller size) is a LOT of coffee! Remember, it&apos;s super-easy to make awesome iced coffee drinks at home , so think carefully before indulging in one of these.


 
 
 

Dear Hungry Girl,

 

I am trying to change my lifestyle. My doctor has recommended I try a low-fat diet. I&apos;m stuck in a rut. I&apos;m leading a very hectic life, and I usually eat fast food. Where do I start?

 

Desperate for Low-Fat 
 
Dear Desperate, 

   

 Good news! The days of not being able to eat good-for-you meals on the run are over. You no longer have to worry about not having healthy (and delicious) options at pretty much any fast food restaurant. The key is to be armed with the info you need. For starters, become best friends ASAP with your web browser; be a Google fiend and start visiting the websites of all of your local fast food places -- Wendy&apos;s , Subway , McDonald&apos;s , Burger King , Taco Bell , etc. Each and every one of those chains has very detailed nutritional info online, so you can see exactly what you&apos;re getting into when you go there. There are also some very simple rules to follow when eating fast food. Don&apos;t assume all salads are healthy (they SO aren&apos;t -- especially the dressings...yikes!), avoid french fries, don&apos;t eat anything fried, skip the shakes, never get anything that&apos;s served with &quot;special sauce,&quot; and stick with meals consisting of straight protein, veggies, fruits, etc. I spend lots of time visiting fast food restaurants and picking out the best guilt-free stuff, so you may want to read the &quot;Chew&amp;Tell&quot; reviews on the HG site for McDonald&apos;s, BK, Taco Bell, Wendy&apos;s, KFC, and more . You can pretty much design a guilt-free meal at any fast food restaurant in the country. It&apos;s EASY!
