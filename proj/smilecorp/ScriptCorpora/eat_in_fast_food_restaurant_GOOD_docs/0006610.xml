I went to Fatburger in Las Vegas late one night. I was expecting typical diner food. I did not feel like a beef burger, so I ordered the turkey burger.  I swear I heard trumpets and caught a glimpse of heaven when I bit into this burger. The burger was huge, however after the first bite it rapidly disappeared.

The best turkey burger ever.

I&apos;m happy to learn there is a Fatburger about an hour from me. I hope their turkey burger is good as the one in Vegas.

One of the best burgers I&apos;ve ever eaten.  I must admit.. I was in Vegas and a bit under the influence!  I decided to take on the XXXL Challenge and demolished the burger.  I am now &apos;King of All Carnivores&quot;, or in other words The Burger King.

Grab yourself a FAT BURGER.

A bit on the expensive side for a fast food place, but the quality of food makes up for it if you aren&apos;t a fan of McJunk (and I am not).

After a night out at the clubs, or working dealing with all of the myriad people out at night, sometimes one has to tear into something as substantial as a XXL to make it all worthwhile.

The burgers are good and made to order, the shakes are decent (I like the Maui banana the best), and nothing tops off a giant meal like fat fries (eat them quickly as they are best while hot).

Good concept and nice menu set up, just wish the quality of the food had been a little better. The burgers were alright but nothing special. They were a bit dry and not too flavorful but the toppings I picked helped make up for it. I topped my medium sized burger with cheese, bacon, an egg, and the obligate onions/lettuce/mayo combo. I absolutely LOVE getting a fried egg on my burger because it adds a nice rich creaminess to the experience. I was underwhelmed with the toppings offered but the standards they do offer (and the fried egg, of course) will be enough for most people.

I tried their skinny fries but felt they were bland and boring, and I wasn&apos;t into their super thick onion rings either. If I were to go to Fatburger again I&apos;d probably try their dogs or chicken sandwiches just to see how they stack up but I think if you&apos;re in a pinch and hungry late at night while passing by, it would be worth it to grab something here.

Though you are in Vegas, so if you&apos;re not too intoxicated or tired to walk a little farther then you&apos;ll probably find better options within a block.

I liken Fatburger to a more indulgent In-N-Out. It&apos;s fresh made-to-order burgers kicked up a notch (i.e. fat).

Firstly, how do you pass by a place called Fatburger and not be curious? Needing a quick sustenance snack, I stopped in to find burgers ranging from Small to XXXL. &quot;Ummm yes I would like a small please.&quot; Many have tried to finish the XXXL in one sitting I was told by my enthusiastic cashier. How could they? It&apos;s the size of a baby&apos;s head! The slightly larger than a slider Small Fatburger was more than enough for my snack. It was juicy and I love that you know it was made fresh and cooked on the flattop right after I ordered it.

If you&apos;re wandering along the strip, especially late at night, you might want to pop by Fatburger if you&apos;re looking for some nosh. Heck go buck wild and add bacon, cheese, and a fried egg while you&apos;re at it.

Fatburger provides a solid quick-service style burger open 24 hours on the Strip right across the street from the Monte Carlo.

When I went there you could choose from small through XXXL for the burger size. I heard from a friend that their used to be only 3 sizes. I think that kind of simplicity would have be nice since I was quite baffled about which size to order. The burgers are all cooked to order which is nice but may cause a little bit of a wait. Cheese, chili, bacon, and egg are all chargable upgrades for the burger while other condiments are available for no additional charge.

I was talked into the medium size burger. I added cheese, bacon, and a fried egg. It was too big. I got to the awkward point in my meal where I was satisfied to be done eating but only had a little bit of burger to go. I decided to avoid feeling the gut bomb and just tossed it. Along with my burger I ordered the skinny fries which turned out were not really all that skinny. I mean, they were pretty much standard size fries. I think I would have been better off if I topped them with chili or ordered the fat fries or onion rings instead. Lesson learned.

All in all, it is a decent option for late night eats. Especially if you want to avoid the more notorious fast food burgers, and of course, you have at least $10 to burn on a quick bite.

(They need to season up the fries a bit more though. VERY plain.)

But, overall..good place to eat after some drinkin&apos; :D

Sooo delicious. Nom nom nom. Comes in tiny to super large portions. Do you know how cute a tiny hamburger bun is? I do. It&apos;s adorable. This food was what I needed after drinking so much.

The guy at the counter was super fast and focused. Not something you see much these days. I&apos;d say fair prices considering where you are.

Beware of the bathrooms.

Vegetarian burgers are an option.

We pulled up to the front of Fatburger and there was only 4 parking spaces which were like 15 minute zones. As there was a security guard watching the place, I asked her if we could park there and she said go right ahead.

Anyway, I went in to order some take out and I picked out a Large Fatburger. The menu was easy to understand and when I got my food it tasted great.

I&apos;ll be back for some more the next time I&apos;m in Las Vegas.

Fatburger--or more specifically, Kingburger--I am coming back to Vegas to eat you! And I am adding bacon and cheese and homemade onion rings to your 8 ounces of juicy, fat deliciousness too. Nine years it&apos;s been since I had the biggest, juiciest fast food burger ever. And just for the record: Fatburger kicks In-N-Out to the curb!

While in Vegas, I ate Fatburger 4 times.....my heart still hurts. Looking back on it, it was totally worth it. The only thing I can say is that the burgers are freaking slamming, especially after having some beer flavored drinks.

The burgers range all the way from medium to XXXL and I went with a medium every single time (make fun of me if you want). If you are feeling tough, go ahead and get the XXXL. My buddy did it and almost died on the spot from cholesterol overload...but he did say it was freaking awesome. Overall it&apos;s a slam dunk for fast food and maybe the sloppiest/greatest burger I&apos;ve had....while in Vegas. BOoM!

OK,
So you know how you go to a fast food joint and the burgers on the menu behind the counter are shown all nice and big and juicy, but when you order it, it turns out to be an overcooked, undersized, nothing remotely close to a sandwich even worthy of being called a reasonable facsimile thereof? Well, Fattburger has mastered this process...inversely. The picture on the menu did not even begin to do justice to the mammoth, gigantic, huge, swollen, bloated mass of beef served greasily to me between the two unfortunate slices of bun forced to bear the weight of this thing. To make matters worse (or better, depending on one&apos;s POV), I had an additional patty, avocado and bacon added to the behemoth.

The ride back to the hotel was arduous. The aroma of the fried beast filled the car, beckoning to my hunger to stagger at the next red light and take a large bite from this beefy buffet. Wisdom prevailed, however, as I knew that once the beast was unleashed, it would go neither quietly nor cleanly back into its now saturated paper encasing. Must hurry.
Barely, but successfully, I transported the package to my room, bag intact, where it was stripped down to its full, naked, delicious elegance. At last, we are alone, you and I. Come.

With all my hunger, I was still not able to finish. &quot;Fatt&quot; does NOT accurately describe the girth of this burger. Try as I might, a happy plate (bag rather) was not to be. Stomach capacity exceeded. Digestion activated. Food coma eminent. Not to worry. With a refrigerator and microwave readily available, we shall meet again very soon. Abdominal pain setting in. Oh Lord, please let me make it thru the night.

If you find yourself in Vegas, be sure to treat yourself to a Fattburger. I warn you, though. Do not underestimate this sandwich, for it is Fatter than its Fatt namesake. Also, I don&apos;t recommend more than one within a six month period. Your heart and grandkids will thank you.

Just OK. I think it is a little bit pricy for the quality. It reminds me of an expensive In-N-Out. I liked the topping choices, and I liked the fry choices. I had a medium burger and fat fries! Wait time was a little long for a dead afternoon, but the burger was satisfying.

Worst experience ever.. I ordered the &quot;fat salad&quot; and recevied shredded taco lettuce with an abused looking tomato on top. I thought it was a joke.  In addition, I FOUND A PICKLE IN MY SALAD!!! EWWWW! IM F@#KING ALLERGIC!.. I was sooo infuriated. i politely asked the employees did pickles come with the salad, they laughed and replied &quot;no&quot;. i showed them what I found, and they laughed even more (i didnt find anything funny).  so I took a picture (please see uploaded post of salad w/pickle--if the following has not already been deleted by their request) for my own evidence, and the manager excuse was &quot;it gets pretty busy, so our cooks can be clumsy&quot;  im standing there puzzled like really?!?!!? did you just say that to a customer?!?!?!?! I recevied a refund, and will never return.

&quot;Brunched&quot; at FatBurger after a late start to the day (who the hell is waking up early in Vegas anyway?!).  FATBURGER!!!  YUMMMMMYYYY!!!!

I remember ordering and the cashier suggesting I go all the way after I mentioned that I didn&apos;t want relish on my burger.  Thank you, Mr. Cashier!  The flavors on this &quot;fast-food&quot; burger go together like crazy!  The burgers are grilled to order and all of the toppings are fresh - probably because nothing gets a chance to sit around here.  The joint is jumping, we could barely find seats!

But back to the burger.  Just so fresh....and tasty......and not fast-foody, unsure of the meat species at all!  Fatburger is definitely all beef all the time.

And PLEASE don&apos;t get me started on the skinny chili cheese fries.  OMGeee!!!  I&apos;m about to go on record as saying they were the best I&apos;ve ever had...  At least definitely in recent memory.  Deliciously tart lemonade too.  Mmmm!!!

Dernit, now I&apos;ve gotta make my way down to the one on South Beach.  Excuse me for a moment...

Some friends and I were getting ready to go back to our room and needed some food in a hurry. We were looking for an alternative to McDonalds when we ran into this gem.

The burgers were made to order (much appreciated). But the most impressive item at Fatburger is their chili cheese fries! I ordered fat fries while my friend ordered the skinny fries with chili. I had absolutely no issue trying to eat every delicious chili covered fry on his plate! I&apos;ve been dreaming of them ever since.

Well done Fatburger, well done.

This place is great.  Open 24 hours,  they welcome all sorts of fun ppl just looking to have a good time and don&apos;t want the party/good times to stop while grabbing a bite.

The staff here are fun and hilarious, from cashier, to ppl serving food, to ppl calling out orders.

Had a laugh w/the cashier, the lady calling out the orders wouldn&apos;t let me have my food unless  I yelled my order out or yelled where I was from, lol.  Lucky I had all my friends w/me to give a shout out to OC, represent!  Customers made the wait fun!

The wait&apos;s kinda long, but like I said the staff and customers make it fun.  Thumbs up for ppl who love what they do!

It&apos;s just a burger(I had turkey)...made to order, which is a little different for fast-food.

Either than that I see no difference from Nations, Mickey D&apos;s, Burger King etc.

Yea I&apos;ll suggest it, but it won&apos;t be my first choice.

Need some grease and a cheaper option on the strip?  You need to try a Fatburger!  They have really fresh ingredients for a fast food joint.  They have some decent milkshakes as well.  There are a plethora of options that you can add to your burger as well.  Check out the menu and mix and match something that would fit you!

Don&apos;t waste your time in McD&apos;s or any of the other fast food places.  The only fast food restaurant I&apos;d recommend in Vegas is In N Out but that&apos;s off the strip.

The most awesome thing about this Fatburger is that they open 24 hours. We got hungry once at 2:30 am and decided to walk there. My 1st experience there&apos;s funny. When I walked in, I was greeted with non-stop rap songs. Also, there are so many ghetto people in there too, all shady looking. I thought we&apos;re gonna get robbed, shot or something lol.

The burger itself is really greasy. You can order the size you want (from S - XXXL) and can pay extra for additional cool toppings, such as chilli and fried egg (I&apos;d recommend these). The burger comes with mustard, mayo, relish, shredded lettuce&amp;tomatoes. The burger as a whole&apos;s pretty good. I like the toppings that they put in there.

Conclusion: The burger&apos;s pretty good. About the same with 5 guys, but definitely can&apos;t beat In-N-Out.

Me:  &quot;Fatburger?  Never heard of them!&quot;
One of my friends suggested, &quot;I hear they&apos;re pretty good.&quot;
We decided to try it.

Both my friends and I agreed.  This might be a good burger if you&apos;re drunk, but it was pretty bad while sober.  While my friends ordered their own combinations I went with the medium Fatburger deal omitting cheese and onions on my burger and choosing the fat fries over the skinny fries.

Although this place looks and operates very much like a fast food place it is not.  The burgers are cooked to order so definitely expect a wait for your food order to be called.  If you order a soft drink it&apos;s self serve.  That part I liked about Fatburger because I can control how little ice and how much soft drink actually goes into the cup.

However, back to the burger.  My number was called and a worker delivered the burger tray to me.  The first thing I noticed was how small the burger ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_… ) was compared to how large the portion of steak fries were.  I love thick fries which is why I selected the Fat Fries over the skinny ones.  These were a huge disappointment even though they were nice and meaty and fried to a perfect golden yellow color.  The fault was in the oil which tasted old, and because of that the fries didn&apos;t taste fresh.  You&apos;d be surprised how big a difference there is just by changing the oil in a fryer.

The burger was not good either.  The burger patty was so overcooked no moisture existed within the meat.  I might have been happy had there even been a glistening of grease within, but nope, chewing cardboard is probably the best comparison.  The shredded lettuce while crisp had the odd taste of being stored in a refrigeration unit badly in need of a box of baking soda.  I don&apos;t mind that they use pickle relish instead of pickle slices but even that tasted old.  It&apos;s kind of like when you go to Costco and stock up on too much of something and store it until the taste begins to waver.  The pickle relish did not have a fresh snappy taste to it.  The only ingredients which tasted fresh were the tomato slice, the bun and the mustard.

At the least the service was good and the workers are friendly.  I can honestly say I won&apos;t be back at a Fatburger restaurant anytime in the foreseeable future.

Big, fat, and juicy!
Nothing can ever go wrong with a Fatburger after a long day &apos;n night in the casino playing your favorite game. The juiciness of the meat is just mind blowing.
You won&apos;t get any better burger on The Strip!
It&apos;s fast food, but still a little bit pricey (but hey, it&apos;s Vegas!)
They&apos;ll shout out your name loud (mostly during rush hour), so watch out!

Fast food served slow!  Be ready to wait at least 20 min after ordering and be sure to double check your orders if taking togo.

And, where&apos;s my hubby&apos;s bacon?  I still haven&apos;t heard the end of the $1 charge that never materialized.  Take it from us if you want your fries skinny, you have to ask because they&apos;re not going out of their way to clarify your desires.

I love the decor of the Fat Burger with its counter seating and old timey feel. The prob is that a meal is just about $10 for a burger, fries, and drink. That&apos;s outrageous for fast food in my opinion.

They are currently running an interesting promotion where you buy a meal, and they give you a second burger for free. I guess if you have a hungry friend along who can cope with sharing your fries and drinking water, this would be a great cheap date place! ;-)

Best thing I ate here were the fries, Picked the skinny ones, as opposed to the steak fries. Very crispy outer shell and only slightly salty. A very clean natural flavor.

The burger patty was tasteless as seems to be the M.O. for fast food joints these days with their overcooked meat. Nothing at all special about the burger.

Overall, I&apos;d rate In N Out higher than the Fat Burger, since there is no equal to In N Out&apos;s Animal Style topping combo.

We happened to notice Fatburger when going down the Vegas strip.  There aren&apos;t any near where I live so I was happy to give it a try. I was happy I did. I had a KingBurger with everything on it and a side of homemade onion rings. The burger was awesome. Big...Juicy...Messy....Perfect!!!  The onion rings were great too.

Alright, fine, Fatburger gets a slight upgrade.

I never end up here on my own accord; I get dragged here by *boys* wanting a Fatburger at midnight. *They* don&apos;t have to worry about being accosted by dudes who think they&apos;re in a rap video (fyi: fake bling--not so cute.) *They* don&apos;t have to worry about their burger being too pink&amp;not being able to eat it. Whine, whine, whine. My sincerest apologies.

I ordered a veggie burger topped with a fried egg&amp;bacon--I&apos;ve definitely had better, but at least it was edible, unlike my previous experiences here. Burger was overwhelmed by toppings (mustard, mayo, pickles, lettuce, tomatoes.) The steak fries (Fat Fries) were good.

I&apos;ll eat here if I&apos;m forced, but I&apos;m not going to be happy about it *pouts&amp;folds arms over chest*

Fatburger is the African-American version of Johnny Rocket&apos;s.

In order to create a Fatburger, you take the Johnny Rocket&apos;s old school diner feel and replace the Elvis, Roy Orbison, and Jerry Lee Lewis with the Aretha Franklin, Al Green, and the Jackson 5. The music here has me &quot;all shook up,&quot; but it has my, &quot;r-e-s-p-e-c-t.&quot; I love it.

Fatburger also takes the complicated Johnny Rocket&apos;s menu, eliminates 75 percent of it, and makes you focus on how you want your burger and what kind of fries you want. Ordering is like, &quot;A-B-C, easy as 1-2-3.&quot;

You first pick the size of your burger. By size, it means in terms of patty size (2.5, 5.3, 8, 16, and 24 ounces). I am not sure who can eat a 2 pound burger, but until I weigh 400 pounds or I am high on government grade grass, I&apos;ll stick to the 5.3 ounce patty. Plus, there&apos;s only so much meat I can fit in my mouth.

You then pick the toppings. The burgers come loaded with fresh lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and pickles (unless you say otherwise), but you get to add to your &quot;Fatburger&quot; experience with four extra toppings: cheese, bacon, chili, and/or an egg. Personally, I always roll with cheese and bacon. But under the influence of Las Vegas, I have added chili and an egg and it while it was different, it was still delicious. Yum. Burp. Fart.

If you want fries, you get two options: skinny fries or fat fries. The former is thin and crispy, and the latter are more like steak fries. Honestly, they are both really good. This is like having to choose between Betty and Veronica. And just like Archie, I can&apos;t truly commit to either option.

So I pick one or the other on each visit, but never both at the same time. You have to keep your options open and never let them know you are savoring both. Now that&apos;s &quot;true playa&quot; status, right there. Ya feel me?

Also, the milk shakes shakes are wonderful. You have try one at least once. They have five different flavors: chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, Maui-Banana, and Oreo Cookies&amp;Cream. You can&apos;t go wrong with either, but I suggest the vanilla, strawberry, and cookies&amp;cream options. They are just so thick and creamy. That&apos;s what she said.

In addition to all of this, the service is stellar. But since it&apos;s set up is not a sit down restaurant, you don&apos;t need to tip. I guess Fatburger eliminated the tipping from Johnny Rocket&apos;s too. So you are left with great burgers, at a good price, in a cool environment.

Needles to say, I&apos;m a fan of the African-American Johnny Rockets: Fatburger.

My friends and I were walking along the strip when we overheard some guys talking about Fatburger. One of the guys mentioned a fried egg that they on your burger, so we were determined to try it at that moment! When we finally arrived at Fatburger, we were hesitant about entering cause it looked kinda shady, but we finally built up the courage.

Their menu doesn&apos;t really offer much to choose from. The only unique option that they have is the fried egg. I had the medium burger with skinny fries. I opted out of the fried egg since it didn&apos;t seem appealing to me anymore. The burger wasn&apos;t bad, but it seemed like a poor In-N-Out imitation. The skinny fries were crispy even though we walked all the way back to our hotel room before gorging. Overall, it was decent and cheap. I&apos;d definitely choose Fatburger over the McDonalds next door though.

Fatburger is legendary! Open 24 hours on the Las Vegas strip, get the fat fries and a double king Fatburger with the works, what else could you possibly ask for in life?

The jukebox inside is great, the workers yell out in harmony to thank you if you leave a tip.

Fatburger is heaven in the desert!

What burger eater doesn&apos;t enjoy a big messy Fatburger?!?

The burgers are cooked to order and offered in a bunch of different sizes with different topping options too.  Probably one of my favorite drunk food choices on the strip.  (kinda hard to get to tho, if I can remember right).
This spot is open 24 hours and every time I&apos;ve been, it&apos;s been filled with a bunch of drunk customers and funny burger flippers.

Throw a fried egg on my XXL burger with a side of Fat Fries and I wont need to eat for the rest of the day!

Fatburger, get the large burger with bacon, a handful of fresh veggies and a fried egg, your heart will hate you but you won&apos;t regret it.

After a late night of partying on the strip, my girlfriend and I, along with a buddy of mine, decided to check out FatBurger for a late night snack.

The atmosphere was really nice, its a fast food joint that looks like a diner serving up burgers made to order, pretty crafty!

Ordered their large 8oz burger with the works, cheese, fried egg and bacon with a side of fries.

I know it sounds like a lot but you live once, and you know what they say, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas!

Burger was tasty but way too greasy, even if I were to take out the egg and bacon, by the time I got back to my hotel the bag was already soaked with grease.

It&apos;s awesome for those who want to try something new, they open 24/7 on the strip so its very convenient for those looking for a late meal.

I&apos;d come back again if I&apos;m hungry but definitely not something that I&apos;d choose as a first option.

This place is definitely not as great as everyone makes it seem.
I would choose In and Out Burger ANYDAY. The burgers are extremely small for their price. It was almost $5 for a small burger that was the size of a microwavable burger you would get at AMPM. I was soooo disappointed when my guy friends ordered and ate the entire thing in about 3 bites. I had ordered the medium sized meal for a little over $10 and that included a burger twice the size as the small (yet about the same size of a regular in and out burger), steak fries and a medium drink. This was by far the most expensive fast food that I have ever purchased and tasted like I could get it at my neighbor&apos;s BBQ next week. They did not have any special sauces so I was bewildered to see how this was considered a top place to go to late at night. Particularly because there is a McDonald&apos;s next door and dollar menu was looking mighty fine after this disheartening meal. If you wanna save some money as well as have a good meal, I&apos;d suggest you walk 10 feet away to the Mcdonald&apos;s next door and have a feast.

A coworker recommended we check out Fatburger while in Las Vegas, and it did not disappoint!

Conveniently located right on the strip, Fatburger is a small, loud, busy place.  You literally have to grab the first table or counter seat that opens up.  When your food is ready, a runner calls out the number and you just wave them over.  They bring you your food which is a nice touch for a fast food joint.

The burgers were great!  Greasy in a good way, with fresh toppings.  My husband and I tried both the skinny fries and onion rings, the latter of which really impressed me.  A little expensive but definitely worth it.

Nasty. Plain and simple.

I am sure this is the place to grub when you&apos;re drunk and don&apos;t notice the paint flakes from the chipped-up floor mingling in with your burger, or the caulking from the broken bathroom sink in your fingernails.

The inside of this place is worse than a gas station.  You&apos;d think from the money they pull in from this place they could get a new floor put in and redo the bathroom... WTF?!?

25 minutes to get a burger when we went at 7pm... I could get a starter and entree in that time from 90% of restaurants out there.  Despite that, the burger came out cold. Fries are frozen crap etc etc.

Stay the hell out of this place.

It&apos;s a good burger. I decided I wanted the fried egg on it after I&apos;d already ordered and it was too late to add it. They were nice about (charging me for and) making me an egg all by itself so I could put it on the burger myself.

Yes, I am eating that burger in my picture, whoa!

History
 
 Established in 1952 

In 1952, Lovie Yancey created something unique. A culture. A phenomenon, if you will. She created the biggest, juiciest hamburgers anyone had ever seen. So obviously, there was only one name for them - Fatburger.

Half a century later, while other places are just discovering taste, we&apos;re still making hamburgers the way she did. Fresh lean beef, not frozen patties. Cooked-to-order, just the way you want it, every time.

Now here&apos;s just a few things to make you drool over your keyboard: onion rings made from real onions. Hand-scooped, real ice cream shakes. Great tasting chili. And fries cooked in 100% cholesterol-free oil. All served with a smile. Fatburger. Distinctive seasonings and attitude since 1952.
