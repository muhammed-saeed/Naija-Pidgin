There has been much attention given to recent unemployment statistics. The Los Angeles Times&apos; reporter Pat Benson reported that &quot;Economists say claims need to drop to no more than 375,000 for a sustained period to make a dent in the unemployment rate, which fell to 8.5% in December, the lowest in nearly three years.&quot; However, this statistic that seems somewhat optimistic, is based on incomplete data, and a lack of accounting for real world situations and circumstances that the work force faces.

There are a great number of working young people in this country that although they retain some form of employment, they do not bring home enough money to pay all of their living expenses, not to mention have anything left over to save for their retirement. The numbers of people who are &quot;under&quot; employed are rarely taken into account when mentioned on the political pulpit, or in the corporate dominated media.

When this kind of data is compiled, they almost never factor in such variables as scale of pay versus living expenses for a given region. This is a significant factor since it is estimated by the United States Department of Labor that although the much touted unemployment rate as of January 2012 is at 8.5% , there are factors such as a mien salary base, where although an individual is employed, they do not make enough money to pay their weekly, monthly or yearly living expenses. This is a prevalent situation in a vast expanse of young workers in the United States. Do to their short work histories, which translates into a lack of experience, and often a lack of on the job problem solving skills, employers often base the salary of younger workers below that of what is necessary in a given region to pay for housing, fuel, electricity, medical coverage, food, clothing, personal hygiene products and a nominal amount for &quot;incidentals&quot;



 The New York Daily News reported that there were 24,000 new unemployment claims that the paper attributed to post holiday unwinding of seasonal jobs &quot;The holidays exaggerated the strength of the economy and now we&apos;re back to reality,&quot; said Milton Ezrati, senior economist at money management firm Lord Abbett&amp;Co.

The reality is that employment is not the only problem. It&apos;s gainful employment many Americans are lacking. When politicians (especially those on the campaign trail) speak about &quot;getting Americans back to work&quot;. The media in this country often talks about how the unemployment rate has &quot;some people&quot; optimistic. The &quot;some people&quot; they are referring to, certainly can&apos;t be the 20 year old young women working in a fast food restaurant making $300.00 a week before taxes who has a $750.00 dollar rent, $260.00 car payment, and $100.00 phone bill. It most definitely couldn&apos;t be the college student taking 18 credit courses for 8 hours a day then going to work for 8 more hours just to find him or herself $8000 in debt by the end of the year. The &quot;some people&quot; often talked about as the wise one&apos;s who shall not be named, ( most often by the commentators at Fox News ) could not be those who struggle in a job that doesn&apos;t pay enough to support them and their families, nor can they find a job that will.

These people simply can&apos;t afford to quit working and get better training and/or education so they are qualified to search for better paying employment. They are trapped in their current position by the very real and immediate need to put food on the table. Simply put, most Americans would rather work at a dead end job making something, rather than not working at all and risk being homeless. The intrusive, judgmental, bureaucratic welfare system in America is a non-choice for many who see it as state control over the intimacy and sanctity that was once the American family.

There has been a move by the Obama administration to regulate and rectify one finite aspect that plagues the young portion of the American workforce. In June of last year legislation was introduced to avail more oversight on the for-profit career preparatory programs to yield more gainful employment. This is meant to force the flourishing &quot;online&quot; colleges and trade schools to follow through with &quot;as advertised&quot; job placement which is &quot;gainful&quot;. According to an article in the Washington Post , &quot;the rule effectively would shut down for-profit programs that repeatedly fail to show, through certain measures, that graduates are earning enough to pay down the loans taken out to attend those programs.&quot;

As is the case with many Americans, students often graduate from these programs with far too much debt and far too little earning power. The fact of the matter is that this legislation isn&apos;t really about helping young workers attain meaningful and impacting employment, it is simply about money. For-profit schools receive about $1 of every $4 spent on federal Pell grants for students in financial need . That totaled more than $7 billion in the last school year - up from nearly $1 billion a decade earlier.

The debt that is accumulated by these &quot;employed&quot; people can be staggering; In relative terms. A $40,000 debt may not seem insurmountable. But one must remember to put it into context. It is the fact that most of this debt belongs to student loans that were lent out by companies like Fanny Mae. According to a USA Today article , the average debt per person in America is approximately $30,000. Now if you are a person making $70-$80,000 per year and have no children or older parents to care for, then this is a debt that you can manage through structuring the payments so that you pay a certain percentage on the interest and some on the principle. Relatively speaking you can do this with little difficulty and in a timely manner.

However, if you are making less than $20,000 a year as roughly 60 million Americans are, (and about 100 million Americans are earning less than $40,000 per year) and you have acquired $30,000 in debt, you will most likely never be able to pay the debt off. Just on the interest alone you will be required to pay, on average, 3/4 or 75% of the $30,000 in interest alone, which brings the total to $52,500 you have to pay back to the bank. In real day to day terms, you will most likely make an effort to pay out of obligation and pride. There is a good chance that you will soon be faced with a choice

1.) Make the payment on the loan and go to the local soup kitchen with your family for meals for the month. 2.) Do not make the payment and feed your family, but in the process damage your credit rating, put other loans such as your car, or home in jeopardy due to the damage done a non-payment ,as well as ensure that any possibility of future loans for things such as your child&apos;s education, wife&apos;s operation, ect;… will be rejected. These are the very real circumstances that are faced by tens of millions of Americans on a daily basis. This is the real truth that mainstream media and politicians alike, just do not understand, or more likely, just do not care.

Although a drop in the unemployment numbers makes for great rhetoric for politicians as well as fodder for the evening news, the truth is that these numbers mean very little to those of us who live in the real world. There are too many Americans who trudge through the daily grind of menial jobs knowing full well that when pay day arrives, they will only be able to slow the inevitable slide ever further into a mounting debt.
