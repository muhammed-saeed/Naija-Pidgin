I cannot express how much I LoVe this place! It&apos;s my all time favorite spot to go to for either a mellow glass of wine, catching up with friends or a night out of good wine, food and ambience.
The inside feels like a European livinging room. Modern yet cozy. The owners are both gems and super sweet and attentive.
I love that they have a dj playing on Friday and some Saturday&apos;s, which is a nice touch and adds to the ambience without feeling like a club inside.
Prices are very reasonable, and they have great specials every day from happy hour to nightly specials.

Cannot think of one thing there is to not LoVe about Voyou!!!

A friend was visiting San Diego and we had gone to Starlite for dinner but it was too packed and loud. So we wanted to go somewhere to catch up without straining to hear each other over loud music.
Voyou is really interesting. I would say it is homey - except that they were playing techno music and I don&apos;t listen to techno at home - so maybe comfortable is a better word for it. A hip living room with lots of wine.

Our french waiter was very nice, didn&apos;t rush us at all even though we were sitting there for two hours with our one bottle of pinot. :)

After strolling around Hillcrest, I decided to Yelp a place with happy hour. This came up on the first of the list and surprisingly, it was Happy Hour all night on Tuesdays. YES!

The place is very small, but I love the ambiance.

Minus one star because they advertise &quot;late night kitchen&quot; on the website, but when we were trying to order appetizers, the French bartender said the kitchen was closed. I was fairly disappointed because of the aroma from the food of the people next to us had already made my tummy quiver.

Such a small cozy wine bar.

A friend&amp;I wanted to go out for drinks&amp;apps. This place was a perfect find, happy hour specials 4-7pm&amp;a sweet French bartender that runs the whole place, a PLUS.

We accidentally crashed a baby shower, opps :) the place is really tiny so if there is a private party being held, you pretty much join in on the fun (but no one minds).

After about 8pm a DJ comes in, plays lounge music, not loud at all so you can definitely continue sipping wine, eating bruchetta&amp;gossiping with friends.

Perfect place for a start-up date or just a fun spot to grab a glass a wine with friends after a long day of work!

Cheers :)

This is the perfect spot for a small party, or a few drinks, or an evening out. The space is cozy, intimate and inviting. The owner is generous, offering great service and really amazing happy hour deals. I just had an event there and it was so wonderful, partly because of the owner&apos;s flexibility - I recommend this wine bar for any small (30 people or less) event.

I still haven&apos;t been able to try the food, but I will be back for sure for both food&amp;drinks - I&apos;m already looking forward to my next visit!

P.S. The bathroom is so nice and so clean.  :)

Happily becoming a regular here. Medina and Renault are the gems of this cozy cocktail bar along with Hessey whom you will find sitting at the end table every Friday evening. Bring a friend. Enjoy their prosciutto plate. Happy hour specials everyday from 4-7p. $3 customized vodka shots. Need I say more?

Free drinks + big boobs= a good deal.

My friends and I were out on the town for a pre-Halloween/birthday party, and a large-breasted woman dressed as the Mad Hatter promised us free shots if we came inside Voyou. Hence, free drinks + big boobs= a good deal.

There were not many people in here at all. There was a guy dressed up as Bret Michaels who just sort of stared at us and didn&apos;t say much. Then there was a gorgeous drag queen dressed in a 1950s airline hostess outfit who just sort of stared and offered us a crooked smile. There was also a lesbian Evel Knievel who seemed to be friends with the owners, and her friend (or girlfriend, not in costume) who was very friendly, chatted with us, and who also seemed to know the owners rather well. My friends were a bit creeped out by the people, but I liked them, as they were anything but ordinary.

The owners are a French couple, and they seem very cool. But the guy seemed annoyed we were promised free shots. However, after our shots he offered a few more on the house at no charge, after hearing it was our first time at VoYou and that my friend had just moved to the area and that it was his birthday.

The interior of this place is cozy and contemporary, and there is a nice little patio. I really like how they decorated the inside.

I will try this place again (for food). The fact that they went out of their way to attract new business by giving us free drinks shows that they are confident people will like what they have to offer, and that the free booze is a good trade-off.

This wine bar is real small and cozy. It is a little tough to find parking...

I really liked how the server was French and I had a hard time understanding him but he was able to recommend a lot of good wines from France. Food he recommended was great too. We got a meat and cheese plate and I ended up being too full to finish my entree. I would definitely go back!

&apos;Tis not Tria, my Philly wine/beer/cheese love.  However, it&apos;s alright.

So, this joint is teeny.  Like, can sit 10 people teeny.  And there appear to only be 2 people on staff (one of whom is French and adorable).

We stopped in for dinner and drinks and...&apos;salright.

The wine was actually quite good, and I liked that they let us sample our selections before committing.  However, I was not a fan of their crappy plastic stopper system for keeping wine (it will go bad fast), and I really, really prefer wine glasses with stems, particularly in wine bars.  Don&apos;t make me go all Sideways here...

Anyway.

The food was fine.  The ahi burger was tasty--if a bit overcooked--and the rosemary bombarded fries were killer tasty.  My duck crostinis weren&apos;t so much, though.  The duck was properly cooked, but very, very, very tough--unpleasant and unpretty to eat.  Also swimming in garlic with a side of undercooked, hard beans.  Breath mints, anyone?

I&apos;d definitely go back...the vibe was pleasant and I have a feeling that the cheese and meat platters are the place to be versus the &quot;regular food.&quot;  However, for the price point, they&apos;re nowhere near 5 stars for me.

Je t&apos;adore, Voyou!

It&apos;s been far too long since I&apos;ve made it in, but I opened a Yelp account and this was the first place that came to mind.  Didier (my one and only man-crush... don&apos;t tell Marisa M.) offers first-rate service, a wide variety of beers (bottles only), delicious food, an excellent wine list, thorough knowledge of the wines he offers, and great deals on happy hours, kir royals, mimosas, etc.

I&apos;m a wino, and my favorite part of this wine bar - aside from Didier&apos;s friendly smile and conversation - is the reasonable prices, particularly on wine by the bottle.  Virtually every bottle (excluding the Chateau Ste. Michelle Riesling, which is overpriced everywhere outside the grocery store) is less than double it&apos;s retail price, some significantly less than that.  That&apos;s very cheap for a wine bar, especially one with the ambiance and charm of Voyou.  À bientôt, j&apos;espere!

Charming wine spot run a French fella from Brittany.

OK, so it was my bday officially and we got a great table for the group.
The cheese plate, charcuterie, tiger prawns with rice and housemade slaw, and the swiss gruyere mac &apos;n cheese were all delicious!  Most importantly, good wine selections.

A definite plus to an already fun and great eats studded neighborhood for dates or a casual meet up.

This place is decent. Never packed which is good because you get great service...not so good for the owner though. We got a caprese plate and a couple of glasses of bubbly and chilled for a while.

Will I be back ? maybe.

p.s. make sure you don&apos;t get overcharged. -2 stars.

Very cute little wine bar! When the other reviewers said it was small, they weren&apos;t joking! It feels like you&apos;re in someone&apos;s apartment, but that gives it a very warm, cozy feel. There is a little patio that overlooks 5th which is great for people-watching and enjoying some fresh air.

The owner, Didier, was working behind the bar and serving the place, which was nice because he really cared what was going on.

The happy hour special on the night we went (Wednesday)was $2 off all glasses of wine, so that was awesome. The menu wasn&apos;t huge and the website leaves much to be discovered, which is the only reason I didn&apos;t give it 5 stars. However, the food they did have was delicious!

Overall, definitely worth checking out!

Love Voyou! It&apos;s small, intimate and cozy with style.
Food is fantastic and the wine selection is very good with reasonable prices.
The two owners are French and as far as I know they are the only two people working there. One is the chef and the other does the serving.
So yes, sometimes it takes a minute or two for Didier to get over to your table, and yes sometimes he&apos;s zipping around. Just sit, relax and enjoy the ambiance of this great little wine bar.

Great little wine bar, very chill and non-pretentious.  Has a feel of a converted living room, something I find to be a refreshing change from the post-industrial wine bar trend going around town.  It only sits 20 people max (I think), but creates enough privacy without giving up intimacy and comradely amongst patrons.
The selection of wines isn&apos;t large, which is good, it makes for easier choices, especially since the selections are all good.
I found service to be impeccable and non-intrusive.  Towards the end of the night, the wine I ordered didn&apos;t have enough to fill my glass to the waiter&apos;s desire, so rather than open a new bottle and waste it, the almost full glass was complimentary.  It&apos;s little touches like these that makes me want to come back again.

My friends and I passed  Voyou on our way to Hash House and noticed the sign for $3 mimosas. After putting our name down for HH and given an hour+ wait we went back to Voyou for drink.

Im only giving three stars since we just had mimosas. Place was small, but very cute. We sat outside and enjoyed the sun and our drinks. There was a large group in before us and after salivating over the menu and then seeing their food come out we will def be returning.

We loved that they played,  I guess you&apos;d call it &quot;mellow-house&quot; aka drug music as my friend said :)

Voyou saved me on a Friday afternoon when my sister was desperate for a drink after picking me up from the airport. It was before 5 so all the usual suspects weren&apos;t open yet. As we walked by, we saw the sign for Happy Hour - $5 wine/cheese/charcuterie. There is no resisting such a deal so we strolled in and were greeted by the charming Frenchies that own Voyou. They were super charming and helpful - we ordered a the HH special cheese and charcuterie, my sister had a glass of syrah and i had a Royal Kir.

The portion of the special plates were perfect - three tastes each of cheese and charcuterie. I did not ask for an explanation of what was on the plates but one of the cheeses was one that I really like - a boucheron. That in itself was worth the $5 and the other 2 cheeses were also enjoyable. The charcuterie was proscuitto, a salumi and possibly sopressata or something of the sort. Also all good.

I was definitely charmed by the atmosphere and the simple, yet tasteful food and wine. Definitely gonna put this on my list for early happy hour spots.

Tiny and intimate, this place is just a little wine bar, French style, up charging for a few tiny pieces of cheese and bread. The wine is very good and the atmosphere is really friendly, especially if you speak French. I wouldn&apos;t come here again, but it&apos;s a nice spot to hit up if you&apos;re looking for a place to chill.

Top 3 words: Cute, Unpretentious (is that a word?!), Delicious

Yup, those are the first 3 words that come to mind when thinking of Voyou. I&apos;ve passed by this little corner wine bar many times and never given it much thought (well to be fair I had no idea what it was). I came here yesterday night to celebrate a friends birthday and boy was it just the cutest thing I&apos;ve seen in a while.

Setting: Outside patio and inside seating. Very dim lights with lots of large hurricane candles. Very romantic, cozy atmosphere. It&apos;s not a huge place but the seating is very flexible with square block cushioned chairs that easily move and configure to the party size. Love the wine hanging out in the racks in open sight.

Food: (things I tried - Tuna Tartare, Bruschetta, Tuna medallion encrusted in bleu cheese).
- TUNA TARTARE: yummy! even though I&apos;m not a big fan of olives that olive tapendate on the tuna tartare was really quite balanced. Good sized appetizer you really get quite a bite to share in my opinion.

- BRUSCHETTA: Very interesting! It was almost like a pizza in that there was melted cheese on top. PLUS it came with anchovies! If you are a big anchovy fan (which I am - I love true ceasear salads with anchovies) then this is a must try.

- TUNA MEDALLION + BLEU CHEESE: *DROOL* this was so good! 3 people at our table of 7 ordered it and were all pleased. It comes with wonderful couscous on the side. You get 2 nice sized tuna medallions. The bleu cheese is truly a wonderful addition to the tuna. A balsamic reduction finishes this off. Really delicious I&apos;d totally get this again.

As for wine, I would just this is personal taste. I think everyone was really happy with the wine they ordered.

Service: super nice, love the french accents, sweet and quite attentive. We had a bit of a wait for the check but I&apos;ll just chalk this up to how europeans like to let you eat and enjoy yourself rather than rush you out the door.

Overall I&apos;m really excited to have tried this place. I need to come back for happy hour of course.

This is the cutest, little French wine bar I&apos;ve been to in San Diego. I would have never found it if I wasn&apos;t invited here by my French neighbor to help her celebrate her birthday. I only stopped by for a couple of glasses of sparkling wine and a slice of cake and fell in love with the cozy, intimate ambiance of this place. The service was good and friendly. I was told this place is where French expats like to go. I need to go back to try their food.

Happy hour = $5 wine glass from 4-7pm

Nice little bar owned by a couple of French guys or what sounded frenchie like. Definitely a cleaner place for a hole in the wall joint. Everything looks brand new, straight from the Ikea store or some European modern motif. That, and they had techno music playing too.

But this place has the best view of Pennsylvania and 5th street. Just sit out in their patio and see for yourself.

So I went with the L&apos;orval Chardonnay 2008 from France. For $5, I couldnt complain, but the serving was eh..petit...oui oui...yah small.  I still liked it while enjoying the scenery of Hillcrest.

Dog friendly - pretty cool having pets walking around in this place.

Why hello there Voyou...

You&apos;re definitely the sexiest new biz to open up in the neighborhood!

I dropped by the all-new Voyou for a late light lunch (and day-drinking, natch) after running a pile of errands.  Apparently the grand opening is in progress as I type these words, but I can tell already that this place is going to enter my regular rotation.

Did I mention that Voyou is sexy?  The cozy cottage-like exterior belies the sleek, modern, and loungy interior, which features lots of blacks and whites.  The entire staff appears to have been brought over from France, and they&apos;re seriously knowledgeable about the libations served here (and gorgeous to boot).

For lunch, I had the avocado and cucumber soup.  The soup was perfect in every way.  Light, refreshing, packed with flavor, with just a hint of spiciness.  The nectar of the gods, maybe?  It was served with a couple slices of the most intensely flavorful rosemary bread that I&apos;ve ever tasted.  Please Voyou -- I need to know the name of your baker, because I am crushin&apos; already.

I washed down the soup with a French chardonnay, which was the ideal accompaniment.  The server was kind enough to provide a complimentary amuse-bouche, consisting of salmon tartare on toast.  I adored this little bite, especially since I&apos;m a big salmon fan.  The salmon was melt-in-your-mouth perfect.

Oh, Voyou -- such a tease!  I&apos;ll be back shortly to see what else you have to offer.

Gotta try the burger and the pork shank.  My wife loves the charcuterie plate. The Duck crostini is nice too.  Good wine list for imports (not just CA wines).

Wow, what a surprising little hole-in-the-wall.

Voyou is a wine bar in the middle of Hillcrest. I&apos;m not really one for the trendy hipster-type places, but Voyou hits the nail on the head. The cozy atmosphere and ambiance is perfect, especially for a little after work happy hour.

The prices are quite reasonable and the food is surprisingly delicious. I ordered the turkey and brie sandwich, but unfortunately they were out of turkey at the time. No matter, I was offered a ham and prosciutto sandwich instead. After one bite, I completely forgot about the turkey and brie as my taste buds were exploding from the deliciousness. Nice.

Voyou has a great selection of wine and even craft beers I&apos;ve never heard of (which is a good thing... new and exciting beers always have my interest).

Service is exceptional. Didier was the guy running the place, and I&apos;m fairly sure he&apos;s the owner. Either way, the welcoming service was definitely refreshing. I even had the chance to brush up on my French by coming here!

For sure a good time, and for sure will be coming back next time I&apos;m in the area. I approve... keep up the good work, Didier and Voyou!

Rarely give a five star, it should be mentioned, but this place is well-deserving. Although touted as a &quot;wine bar&quot;, we went for the food, and were very surprised at how amazing it was. My lady and I ordered the Tuna Medallions (just really well done), Chicken Cordon Bleu (nice choice) and the Mac and Cheese (Seriously, seriously great. One of the best meat-free mac and cheeses in San Diego). It was all well presented, and the main meals featured scalloped (or perhaps au gratin) potatoes that were insanely good. I NEVER eat sides of potatoes. But here, I couldn&apos;t help it, really.

Great wine list, and definitely not too expensive. No $15 wine glasses here, thankfully.

The service was great, conversational and really friendly.

We ate on the patio, which is a bit tight, but nice. The place itself is a great modern room, with a cozy vibe and cool aesthetic. Really should be packed, considering how good it is. It&apos;ll get there soon, I&apos;m sure, but in the meantime, I&apos;d consider becoming a regular.

A sleek and sexy new wine bar is always a welcome addition to my neighborhood!  Especially when it&apos;s only 2 blocks from my house!  I had dinner here with my friend last weekend, and really had a great time.  The atmosphere is very chic and relaxing, and the staff are very friendly.  The owner took time to stop and chat with us.  I love the patio overlooking 5th avenue, it&apos;s DEFINITELY an awesome place to sit and have a glass of wine and watch the cars drive by, waving to all your friends and neighbors as they pass!

They have a great wine selection, I enjoyed a nice sauvignon blanc from New Zealand.   We shared the cheese plate, beef skewers, and some salmon/seafood wrap that was similar to a sushi roll.    The cheese was an excellent selection, I enjoyed every single one of the 4 cheeses they provided.  The beef skewer was very tasty, as was the salmon roll!  All in all, the food definitely tasted like it was prepared by a gourmet chef.

My only complaint is that the portions are a bit petite - for example they only give you one piece of beef (albeit a large one) on the skewer, that makes it difficult to share with friends because you have to cut it in half.

I wouldn&apos;t necessarily come here if you&apos;re REALLY hungry, as you will spend a lot of money, but if you want to enjoy a few glasses (or a bottle) of wine with friends, and snack on some food, this is definitely the place!

Total cost was about $60 bucks with tip for 2 glasses of wine and 3 tapas.

All in all, a welcome addition to my hood!  BTW, for those who don&apos;t like cigarette smoke, they do allow smoking on the patio, and I did notice that it kind of drifted inside of the restaurant since it&apos;s an &quot;open patio&quot;.  If this is a concern, I would sit up at the bar so you&apos;re not so close to the patio doors.

Perfect little wine bar for a drink before dinner or while just walking around on a nice evening.  The place is so cute.  It feels like you are in someone&apos;s house, the little balcony is perfect to sit on a nice night and people watch, and even the bathroom is adorable.  Plus the staff is so sweet.  I love their accents (I think they are all really French).
The wine list is big so there is something for everyone.  The price range is very affordable.  Also, there is a very generous happy hour and on Sunday there are $3 mimosas all day- and I&apos;m sure they are better than the crap they serve at Baja Betty&apos;s.
I should mention that there is also a food menu, small plates, desserts that you can get, but I haven&apos;t tried it yet.  Maybe next time.

We came here Saturday night and sat outside drinking delicious wine.   Lots of fun people watching. The wine was fantastic, reasonably priced ($10 for a glass of luscious zinfandel).  Also had a creme brulee, which was presented very nicely and was quite good. The stools were a bit wobbly (even more than they were supposed to be), so that might be a bit scary if you&apos;d had too much wine.  Can&apos;t wait to come back to try more menu options.  Wonderful service.

I really like this place. It is cozy on the inside and great for people watching on the deck/bar seats. The wine and food was very good. The cheese plate and the scallop dish were both really good and fresh. The service was great and it would be a perfect spot for a date or to meet a few friends for some light bites and drinks. Overall great spot and I will be returning.

Wait where am I again?! Anyone who has ever doubted time travel needs to come to Voyou! I felt like I was right back in Europa!! I absolutely LOVED this place! My friend and I split the duck breast on crustini app with a bottle of an Argentinian Malbec! I uploaded a photo. We enjoyed our evening in a warm intimate ambiance of white and black furnishings, candle light, and the warm breeze of a summer night coming in through the patio. Service was impeccable as well! I will be back time and time again!

i love this place! it&apos;s a cute tiny wine bar, good to seat maybe 20 people at most. the decor is super cute, hardwood floors with white leather cubed seats and tables that are at a comfortable height. it&apos;s very chill! the intimacy you have in this place is unbelievable.. because it&apos;s small and quaint, its really easy to meet other people.. and everyone here is super friendly!

my girlfriend and i got a bottle of wine (Camelot) for $30. we had the ham and cheese appetizer - which was YUMMY! it reminded me of the french pastries that are buttered to perfection, not too much or too little, but just right.. and the asparagus tart (which wasn&apos;t too tart at all - believe me I&apos;m not a &apos;tart&apos; person, and i liked it!). we also shared an Angus burger which was yummy too..

this super charming place is one you definitely have to try! the wine selection is small, but i prefer it that way so it doesn&apos;t get too overwhelming.

AND!! the french &apos;waiter/owner/only person working&apos; could talk and say anything to me all day!  everytime he stopped by our table i would mention random things just to keep him talking, i LOVE his accent!

There are a lot of great things about Voyou, including the decor, unique modern tableware, and a perfect location, but it failed to live up to my expectations.  When we sat down, we were happy to see Kir Royale on the menu...something rarely found in San Diego restaurants.  Truthfully, I was cold and uncomfortable most of the time that I was there. It is great that they have a smoking porch, but with the door open in the small restaurant, I was forced to keep my coat on....and was still cold.  They did close the door once the rest of the customers who had been going in and out finally left.  I was also a bit uncomfortable on the seats without backs, and found it awkward to have an intimate conversation. Anyway, we started with the duck crostini, which I don&apos;t remember too much about.  Aside from the cheese platters (which we didn&apos;t want that night), there really wasn&apos;t a lot on the menu to munch on along with our wine. Or friend joined us late, and ordered the Caprese, which they were out of that night.  The service was leisurely, but almost so much that it was difficult to order food and pay our check.  All in all, it is a cute spot, but best to go on a warm night...and maybe share a cheese platter.

Love this place, possibly new favorite wine bar! its kinda trendy, and modern, i like the house music playing not so obnoxiously as some places. Great atmosphere, small and intimate, perfect for a date. and Dieter (?spelling, sorry!) was very helpful and personable! good fresh mimosas! interesting wine, they have a good organic pinot! I love the seating, inside and out

i just love that it was small and not LOUD like some. just awesome ambiance. great new addition to the neighborhood. welcome :)

and for a wine bar, their selection of food is interesting, not extensive. but fine quality. Seriously not one bad not note
