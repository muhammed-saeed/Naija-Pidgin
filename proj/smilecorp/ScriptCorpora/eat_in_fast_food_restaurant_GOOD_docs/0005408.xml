 Please be aware! - Our research shows that a regular movie on netflix/apple tv is 1 - 1.5 Gb of traffic for a standard movie. An HD movie can use up to 7 Gb of traffic. This works out to about the same amount of bandwidth that a console game may use. We highly advise not using HD mode when streaming content as this can use up significantly more bandwidth than normal content.
