Question
 Denise 
A trip through a drive-up window of any leading fast-food restaurant is useful in understanding concepts?

A trip through a drive-up window of any leading fast-food restaurant is useful in understanding concepts
such as total quality management (TQM), just-in-time (JIT), and continuous improvement (CI).
Each restaurant can be viewed as a small manufacturing center. List two fast-food restaurants you are
familiar with in the first column of the following table (e.g., McDonald’s, Taco Bell, Burger King,
and KFC). Record in the table how each company is putting each of these lean business concepts into
action, both favorably and unfavorably.
