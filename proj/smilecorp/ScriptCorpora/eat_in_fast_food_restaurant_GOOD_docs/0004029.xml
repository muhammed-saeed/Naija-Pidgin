 May 11, 2010 Likes it Food vs. Face A friend and I decided to pop in on an old networking colleague of ours who has now moved on to much more mellow pastures at The Heights Cafe in Huber Heights. I&apos;m pretty sure the place... More from Food vs. Face

 May 19, 2010 Really likes it The Heights Cafe is a great coffee stop by Lucia Jameson ( 6 reviews ) Very happy to see The Heights Cafe open in the olds Conn&apos;s location. The coffee is very good and the lemon meringue pie is to die for. This will go on my list of regular stops in the Dayton area 2 out of 2 found this review helpful May 13, 2010 Likes it Pie in the Sky by mimi ( 3 reviews ) Visited The Heights Cafe three times since it opened two weeks ago and I have to say I&apos;m addicted to the Peanut Butter pie and the Cafe Mocha. I found out that they use Bowman Landes turkey which is a local farm and I&apos;m all about keeping it local. 2 out of 2 found this review helpful March 15, 2012 Likes it Mobile review by James Vincent Santilli III ( 1 review ) Great little place! Fantastic, home-like feel and food. Consistently good quality for great value. Too bad they&apos;re not open on sundays! August 16, 2010 Likes it Great local shop by Jessie ( 7 reviews ) This place is hiding in a little plaza and we are glad we stumbled upon it! Had the best reuben there and the people are so nice and helpful! The hours are a bit strange so unfortunately we wont be able to go often. 2 out of 2 found this review helpful July 21, 2010 Really likes it Nice Place by mary ( 1 review ) My sister Shani and I visited this Cafe yesterday and after visiting their Facebook I become aware of Urbanspoon so I decided to tell how much we liked this little cafe. Shani had a HUGE Club sandwich and I had the best Veggie Omelet.I tasted a few of Shani&apos;s potato chips and they were very good and made&quot;in house&quot;as I was told. The ladies working were all so nice and the cafe itself was clean and relaxing. I was surprised to see that they sold books there and I later learned that the books are from the Dayton Metro Library and all money for the books goes back to the library. I left with a Frozen Hot Chocolate and I must confess that I will be back again this week for another Frozen Ht Chocolate and a piece of Peanut Butter pie which was calling to me. ;) I give this place Two Thumbs Up. 2 out of 2 found this review helpful December 28, 2011 Yummy by Ben ( 6 reviews ) I was in town visiting and looking for a place for a bite to eat, some coffee, and some wifi. The heights cafe had it all. I had the western omelet. it was delicious. coffee was good and friendly service. i recommend! August 4, 2010 Likes it Very good! by Kelly ( 1 review ) Whenever I eat there It is always between the Hampton, the turkey dip and the french connection. And the coffee is my favorite. I love the chocolate covered cherry drink ESP hot or blended! 2 out of 2 found this review helpful July 29, 2010 Almond Joy Mochas by Chris C. ( 1 review ) In response to a couple reviews down: this is a CAFE, not a sit-in restaurant. No one in Huber knows what a cafe is, apparently. The only thing you can do is adapt and accept it. Also, the size of the place isn&apos;t to blame. Now for a good review: I&apos;ve had breakfast and lunch here and both were delicious. My guilty pleasures are the home-made chips and peanut butter pie... The staff is very friendly and they seem to know me by now! 2 out of 2 found this review helpful September 30, 2010 Likes it The Tops!!! by Huber Girl ( 1 review ) Must say upon first entering the Heights Cafe that I was pleased with what they&apos;d&quot;done with the place&quot;. The atmosphere is a very drop in, relax, sit and chat, read a book , surf the internet one that we have been lacking up here. That being said, of course I assumed the food/berverage menu would be a disappointing. Much to my suprise, most of the menu items are well prepared and quite good. The prices could of course be a tad lower, but this is not McDonalds by a long shot. I have returned many times since their opening, taking friends from work or the neighborhood. In all cases they were very happy. Welcome to the neighborhood Heights Cafe&apos;. 2 out of 2 found this review helpful September 8, 2010 Likes it Coffee&lt;3. by Karri. ( 4 reviews ) I popped in today to grab a cup of coffee. I&apos;ve found nothing but swill around and have relegated myself to only drinking coffee that I brew myself since moving to Huber. The coffee is amazing, the staff is superb and it&apos;s just an all-around perfect environment. I also like that they have bulk cream, sugar, etc and real utensils available to help reduce waste. You&apos;re more than welcome to bring your own mug. I hate going to prepare my coffee and being required to open about 34 packets of sugar and 16 pc&apos;s of cream. It&apos;s my new favorite place in Huber. Hands down. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful June 16, 2010 Likes it Best in Huber Heights by Ginny T. ( 1 review ) The Heights Cafe is more than a coffee shop, stop on by and try any of the menu items for lunch or breakfast and you will be pleasantly surprised and your tastebuds will thank you. My husband and I have been there for breakfast and I have been there for lunch several times now and it is my favorite place in Huber to eat out! Great food, friendly staff, and Chef Jeff is fantastic!!! 1 out of 1 found this review helpful July 23, 2011 Likes it Excellent Cafe by Ben ( 1 review ) This cafe is the epitome of why I love trying small, local restaurants. Heights Cafe has a relaxed atmosphere and a menu a step above the standard greasy garbage you find at national chains. Look past the strip mall it&apos;s located in and stop by for a great sandwich with a slice of pie. July 19, 2011 Likes it Mobile review by Jason ( 1 review ) This place is great. I recommend the turkey dip sandwich, Pat&apos;s Mistake to drink, and the peanut butter pie to share for dessert. What a great place and what great people. January 20, 2011 Likes it Mobile review by Alisha Hacker Gross ( 2 reviews ) The Heights Cafe is always a treat. Delicious coffee drinks, good food and very friendly staff. Jeff stops and says hi to us everytime we visit. Their roast beef sandwich is amazing and their Peaches n praline pancakes are out of this world ( I always ask for extra peaches.). Whether your having lunch with friends or having a quiet breakfast with your husband, this a great choice. I just wish they were open on Sundays so all of us at St. Pete&apos;s could enjoy a great breakfast at this fabulous place! August 13, 2011 Likes it Shirley by Shirley ( 1 review ) The first time I visited The Heights Cafe was with a group. I was very impressed! Clean, Friendly and what a cute layout inside. Topping it off and was I happy was the food. I had a Corned Beef sandwich the best I have ever had. Today I went back ...had a great breakfast and a corned beef sandwich to take home. Way to go Huber Heights. January 13, 2011 Likes it Mobile review by Brandon Boldt ( 1 review ) We had an amazing breakfast here (served all day)! Very filling and tasty! July 2, 2010 Doesn&apos;t like it Don&apos;t waste your time or money!! by foodlover97 ( 5 reviews ) I ordered a BLT that was $7 and expected a fantastic sandwich. It was something I could&apos;ve made at home. My daughter got the pancakes. The topping was good, but the pancakes were thin and not fluffy, the topping made them soggy. Did not like the atmosphere. You have to stand in line and place your order like it is a fast food restaurant. There isn&apos;t enough room at the register, so you are cramped in line trying to read the menu and order your food. We will NOT be recommending this restaurant to our friends, nor will we go back. 1 out of 6 found this review helpful
