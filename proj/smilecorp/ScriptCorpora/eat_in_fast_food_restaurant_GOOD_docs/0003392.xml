Jollibee Corporation in the Philippines

· 5 Comments 
 


When I think of Jollibee, usually all I can think about is the mouth watering Yumburgers or ChickenJoy. But in reality, it takes so much more than just food to make Jollibee. If you’re curious about business operations for both the Jollibee Philippines division as well as Jollibee International, then hopefully this article will help out a little bit.

 Acquistions in the Philippines 

The corporation is actually known as Jollibee Foods Corporation. Oh and if you thought that Jollibee was the only fast food chain operated by this coporation, boy are you in for a surprise. To me, it seems like JFC owns a majority stake in all of the Filipino fast food niches. Do you ever eat at Chow King? I know I love the halo-halo there, but did you know that in the year 2000, JFC acquired Chowking! That’s right, all the delicious oriental style fast food from Chow King is operated at a high level by the same corporation as Jollibee. Oh and that’s not all. Seems like Jollibee Foods Corporation has the idea that diversification is key to its future, and I think they’re on the right track. JFC also bought out the popular fast food pizza restaurant known as Greenwich Pizza. Additionally, in 2005, Red Ribbon Bakery became part of JFC. Keeping with the baking theme, JFC acquired the French cafe and bakery known as Delifrance. The division of JFC that handles business inside of the Philippines is known as Jollibee Philippines.

 Acquisitions outside of the Philippines 

JFC has holdings in several other Asian countries including China and Taiwan. There’s a Chinese fast food chain named Yonghe King in mainland China (based in Shanghai) that is owned and operated by JFC. Another Chinese restaurant chain named Hongzhuangyuan was acquired on September 21, 2007. This chain has 33 locations in Beijing and was purchased for the amount of US $50.5 million.

Wow! I sure was surpised when I learned about all those acquisitions. It’s interesting to note that when I walk into any of the chains above that they’re owned and operated by the same corporation. I’m glad that Jollibee has a great track record with the Filipino community and that in addition to the amazing Jollibee stores in the Philippines, they can offer us a variety of  different foods ranging from pizza, oriental food, coffee and baked goods. Yum!

There is no doubt that Jolibee is the best Filipino fast food but hope they can improve their drive-thru services.
It’s loosing the main purpose of driving-thru if customers are made to wait for 15-25 minutes.
Most of the time I just cancell my order the moment the sales person tells me that I have to park upfront and wait. Driving-thru should be an order-pick up-and go thing.
Just a suggestion, maybe you need another hotline number like the delivery who can take advance order by phone so customers can just drive-thru to pick up their order.
I tried calling the 87000 number, but they said that the number is for delivery only.
Hope you can improve this very useful service for busy people like me.
Thank You.
