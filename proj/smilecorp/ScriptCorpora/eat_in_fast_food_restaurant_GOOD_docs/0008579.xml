 Taste Of The Nation Posted by Audie Metcalf on Jun 7, 2010 
Hey Guys!

We wanted to give a quick shout-out to Michael, for his work with Taste of The Nation in Culver City yesterday - all proceeds for this organization went toward fighting childhood hunger. Michael was there doing a cooking demo - showing folks how to make a hearty meal for 8 people, with ingredients totaling only 10 dollars!

Take a look at some photos from the event HERE .

Start following Taste of the Nation&apos;s blog , too! As it happens, at the very top, you can click on this link to be catapulted directly to Michael working his magic with liquid nitrogen.

Enjoy!

I went with my husband to the Taste of the Nation.  It was so much fun, will definitely go next year!  We got to watch Michael&apos;s cooking demo and try amazing food and drinks.  We wanted to sample Michael&apos;s food, but I guess I&apos;ll have to wait until my birthday!

 Your Guilty Pleasure Winner! Posted by Audie Metcalf on Jun 4, 2010 
Hey Guys!

Well, I&apos;m both hungry and nauseated after reading about all of your Guilty Pleasures ! But like everything in life, one particularly nauseating and delicious Pleasure stood out like a beacon among your frostinged crackers, peanut butter and pickle sandwiches and Krispy Kreme bread puddings.

And the winner is...

 General Tso !

Read his rhapsodic and semi-insane review here!

 Surely the most horrible and culture-destroying trend in casual  dining is the recent panoply of &quot;ethnic&quot; fast-food joints that have  raced from this country&apos;s coasts to its interior like so many exotic  stomach-viruses. God bless the family that goes out for &quot;Mexican  food&quot; only to end up at Taco Bell. Now they have so many other great  styles of food to never experience properly!

That said, I love me some Panda Express Orange Chicken.

Panda Express Orange Chicken is a study in contradictions; bright  orange, like a traffic-cone,  yet I&apos;ve a strong suspicion no actual  oranges were used in its preparation. Nugget-like in it&apos;s  constitution, yet often plagued by gristle. And let&apos;s face it, it  smells like an Ambulance-chaser&apos;s armpit, yet tastes as sweet and  divine as a closing argument from Clarance Darrow.

Any resemblance to actual Chinese food is almost coincidental. But traditional cuisine  dressed in the garish pageantry of a fast food restaurant,  presided  over by grinning pandas and seasoned with the tears of generations of  assimilation and struggle,  is singularly American. And seeing it  there, in my Styrofoam container, waxy and smothered in syrup, I  thank  God I was born into a place that can come up with something as  beautiful, and as monstrous, as this.
 
Thanks, General Tso . That was truly vile.

Check in with us on Monday for another fun and far less disgusting assignment! Have a great weekend everyone. Eat your vegetables!

 Gulf Coast Seafood Posted by Bryan Voltaggio on Jun 3, 2010 
I wanted to take a moment to address the horrific BP oil spill. At VOLT , there have been a lot of questions and comments surrounding how the spill will affect seafood. I have fielded several calls from guests, media, and peers about how it has affected our menu.

I am currently not purchasing gulf fish or shellfish for the menu and was not leading up to the event. However, I have been keeping a close watch as to how this may impact the way guests choose their seafood. The largest consumed product associated with the Gulf waters that finds its way to our plates is shrimp. A favorite during summer months, however I learned only 7% of what Americans consume is harvested from the gulf. I have been using a local source for shrimp in the restaurant - Marvesta Shrimp Farm . They are located on the Eastern Shore of Maryland in Hurlock and have been a great source for sustainable product. I am waiting for Marvesta Shrimp farm to open back up their operation; they slowed production in order to improve the farm in order to gain a green rating from Monterey Bay Aquarium for sustainability. But once production resumes, I will be working with them to bring shrimp back on the menu.

Another large concern that I was recently made aware of was that this spill could and likely will greatly impact the summer spawning season for Atlantic Blue Fin Tuna. They spawn in the deep waters off the Gulf Coast near where the disastrous spill occurred. The population of this fish is already highly threatened and this could add more stress to the re population of the Tuna. Between now and then I will not be adding Gulf Fish and Shellfish to my summer menu. With all of the obvious concerns that are associated with such a disaster, be sure you are asking all the right questions of your local fishmonger.

Good luck, everyone.

Cheers.

-Bryan

 Rocking the Liquid Nitrogen: Praise For Michael Voltaggio! Posted by Audie Metcalf on Jun 2, 2010 
 

 

 Hey Guys,

I wanted to take a moment to highlight Jonathan Gold and the great praise he gave to Michael today. In an Ask Mr. Gold piece for the LA Weekly, a reader asked for Southern California restaurant recommendations. Here&apos;s what Mr. Gold had to say about Michael :

&quot;At the Langham , Michael Voltaggio is rocking all the gelling agents and liquid nitrogen you could wish.&quot;

Not only is it a nice compliment, it also happens to be true! We appreciate the kinds words Mr. Gold, and agree with your recommendations.

If you have a great LA restaurant recommendation, please tell us in the comments!

 Thanks, everyone!

 Give Us Your Guilt! Posted by Audie Metcalf on Jun 1, 2010 
 

Hey Guys,

Admit it, you watch TV while eating Chocolate Chip Butter Sandwiches, and that&apos;s...OK.

What are Chocolate Chip Butter Sandwiches, you ask? Why, naturally it&apos;s two slices of crustless Wonder Bread smeared with soft butter, with smashed Soft Batch Chocolate Chip Cookies inside.

What else COULD it be?

Ok, that&apos;s my dirty (but delicious) laundry. Now, what&apos;s yours?! The Voltaggios want to read about your favorite Guilty Pleasures, whether it&apos;s Deep Fried Twinkies, Mayo-Drenched Fries, Bacon-Wrapped Cheese Cubes - we want to hear about it!

Go to the GUILTY PLEASURES forum thread and post away! Ideally, we&apos;d love a photo to go along with your post as well! We&apos;ll go through them and the Voltaggios will choose their stand outs, and I&apos;ll post them on the Homepage on Friday!

Oh, and for the record, there is no guilt when it comes to food - no matter how many sticks of butter the recipe asks for. No one eats this junk all the time (please don&apos;t eat this junk all the time) but as a little treat, well, life is for the living.

Happy posting!

-Audie

 Microwave Recipes Winner! Posted by Audie Metcalf on May 28, 2010 Hey Guys!

Thanks for all your Microwave Submissions! The Voltaggios have gone through your delicious dishes and selected a simple but elegant chicken dish. Who doesn&apos;t want a quick and easy new way to prepare a chicken breast? That&apos;s correct. No one doesn&apos;t want that.

Thanks to Becky Turner , AKA, Southern Belle for the winning recipe!

Here it is:

 6 boneless, skinless chicken breast, halved
1 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 teaspoons Worcestershie sauce
1/2 teaspoon. celery salt
1 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt, optional
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3/4 cup seasoned dry bread crumbs
1/4 cup chopped pecans

Rinse and dry chicken breasts. Mix sour cream, lemon, Worcestershire, and spices. Add chicken, coating each piece. Let stand, covered, in refrigerator overnight. When ready to cook, remove coated chicken ,and roll in crumb/nut mixture, coating evenly. Arrange 4 breasts at a time in &quot;circle fashion&quot; in a shallow baking dish, thickest portion to outside. Cook on High power (100%) for 6 minutes per pound, or until juices run clear. 

Chicken? In a microwave? And not just to re-heat your Kung Pao? Incredible!

Be sure to check back on Tuesday for another fun contest.

Thanks everyone, and enjoy your Memorial Day!

 JAR Posted by Audie Metcalf on May 27, 2010 
 

Hey Guys,

I recently attended Suzanne Tracht&apos;s cooking class in her surprisingly small kitchen in Jar. She made us a Pea Puree with herb salad, leg of lamb and scalloped potatoes - every bite was smart, balanced, delicious. Suzanne is a no-nonsense chef who completely incorporates the marketplace and season into her simple but perfect menu.

Since we&apos;re not only huge Voltaggio Brothers fans, but also foodies, I thought some of our Los Angeles comrades would be interested in attending one of Suzanne&apos;s classes. She hasn&apos;t set the exact date quite yet, but another one will be coming up in June so be sure to get on their mailing list to find out details. In the meantime, you can drool over her menu, or better yet, stop in and try her mind-bogglingly tender Pot Roast and Banana Cream Pie - my favorites.

Take a look at the menu HERE .

If you&apos;ve already been, let us know your thoughts, and if you decide to stop in, let us know that, too! I&apos;d love to hear what you think. Oh, and be sure to share exactly what you ordered so we can all food-geek out together here on the site!

Thanks, everyone!

 With A Cherry On Top Posted by Audie Metcalf on May 26, 2010 
 

Hey Guys!

If you&apos;ve visited your local Farmer&apos;s Markets lately or even the produce section at your finer gourmet grocer, you&apos;ve seen beautiful, fresh cherries which are finally creeping into season! These antioxidant-packed stone fruits are insanely delicious and usually my favorite recipe for them is as follows:

1. Buy one pound of cherries.
2. Wash one pound of cherries.
3. Eat one pound of cherries.

However, as is true with vegetables, roasting really brings out the cherry&apos;s bittersweet bite. Try this simple recipe:

 INGREDIENTS: 

7 cups cherries, stemmed but not pitted
1 tablespoon olive oil

 STEPS: 

Preheat oven to 400F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Place cherries on baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil and toss to coat. Bake for 35 minutes, or until your cherries split. Let the cherries cool for at least 20 minutes, and then squeeze pits. Refrigerate until ready to eat.  

Some cherry-picked ideas:

Tossed together with almonds, butter lettuce and other soft lettuces, and goat cheese and dress with your favorite slightly sweet dressing.

Instead of strawberries, use roasted cherries with your shortcake recipes.

Cherries pair beautifully with duck.

Instead of the standard chocolate, heat up your cherries in a sauce pan and pour over vanilla ice cream. Simple, perfect.

You can substitute cherries for almost any of your trifle recipes which call for fruit - especially those that also have chocolate.

Happy Cherry Season, everyone!
