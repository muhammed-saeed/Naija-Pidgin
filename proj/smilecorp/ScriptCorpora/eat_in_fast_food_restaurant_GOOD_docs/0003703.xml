Black is sophisticated and artistic. 

 Black ranges from sinister to sophisticated . It can be arty or malevolent. It is appropriate in dress for funerals and formals. It is the symbol of countercultures from Bohemians to bikers.

 Decorating with black : Black is a color that should definitely be used in moderation. Too much black is oppressive. On floors, black shows every piece of dust. As an accessory, black can be elegant in towels or leather sofas. When used in contrast to another color, black can be very dramatic, as in a granite counter top paired with blonde wood cabinets in the kitchen. Used outdoors, black trim on a white house is a statement of power.

Black and white together is the definitive pairing of the balance of opposites. In the home, too much of this high-contrast combination can be numbing unless another color is introduced. Fortunately, against the minimalism of these two colors, even a little color stands out in bright relief. Consider yellow towels in the bathroom, or a brilliant Georgia O&apos;Keeffe poppy print on the wall of the living room. Suddenly, the room sings.
