 Chinese Foods That Are High in Protein 

Chinese dishes supply adequate dietary protein, because they contain important protein sources such as chicken, beef, pork, duck or seafood. Tofu, commonly used in vegetarian Chinese cooking, contains protein from non-animal sources. Chinese dishes also contain large amounts of carbohydrates in the form of thickening starches, noodles or rice, and some dishes contain large amounts of fat. When eating Chinese food, you can tailor your food choices to fit into your diet, whether you&apos;re emphasizing or limiting protein.
