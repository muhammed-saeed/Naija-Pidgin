Braised Goat SERVES

Serve with a rice pilaf. Adapted from&quot;How to Roast a Lamb: New Greek Classic Cooking,&quot;by Michael Psilakis.
 
Ingredients for Braised Goat:

 2 1/2 lbs goat meat, bone in and cut into 4 pieces salt and freshly cracked black pepper 3 tablespoons blended oil (90 percent canola oil, 10 percent extra-virgin olive oil) 5 medium garlic cloves, coarsely chopped 1/2 large Spanish onion or 
 1/2 sweet onion, coarsely chopped (1 cup) 1 medium carrot, peeled and coarsely chopped (3/4 to 1 cup) 2 celery ribs, coarsely chopped (1 cup) 3 tablespoons tomato paste 1 cup dry red wine 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 2 teaspoons dried greek oregano 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 4 quarts water 5 large sprigs fresh thyme 2 sprigs fresh rosemary 1 tablespoon roasted garlic (homemade or store-bought, see NOTE) 3 fronds fresh dill, chopped (1 tablespoon) 3-4 fresh mint leaves, finely chopped (1 tablespoon) extra-virgin olive oil 

Preparation of Braised Goat:
 
 Season goat with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium high heat until very hot; add goat pieces and sear until golden brown on all sides, about 20 to 30 minutes; transfer meat to a plate. Pour out most of the oil in saucepan, then add garlic, onion, carrot, and celery; cook, while stirring, until softened, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook an additional minute. Deglaze the pot with the red wine and vinegar (use a wooden spoon to loosen any brown bits that may have stuck to the bottom). Continue cooking until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 20 minutes. Mix in oregano, mustard, water, thyme, and rosemary. Return goat meat to the pot, season with about 1 1/2 tablespoons salt and fresh pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium low, partially cover, and cook for 2 1/2 hours; skim off any scum that accumulates on the top. Transfer goat meat and vegetables to a serving platter, discarding any cooked herbs. Increase heat under pot and reduce pan juices, stir in roasted garlic puree, chopped dill, and mint. Drizzle the pan juices over the goat and vegetables, then drizzle with extra virgin olive oil. NOTE: To roast garlic, lop off the top of a head so that its cloves are exposed a bit. Drizzle with olive oil and wrap tightly in aluminum foil, then roast for about 40 minutes in a 400-degree oven. Squeeze the cloves into a small bowl and mash to form a puree.

 Burger King Original Zesty Sauce 
I love Burger King&apos;s Zesty dipping sauce, offered with their onion rings... which used to be somewhat palatable (no further comments about the rapidly diminishing quality and portions of today&apos;s fast food restaurant chains...). On each BK visit, I would routinely purchase additional Zesty sauces so I could take a good supply home with me... until the simple solution came when I opened my last remaining packet...&quot;I can make this myself at home!&quot;... And I did...

 Chicken, Prosciutto, Mortadella&amp;Artichoke Terrine 
This great dish I originally had in a small South Carolina restaurant and absolutely fell in love it it. We had it for lunch one day and it was totally amazing. With a little help from the waiter, who also worked in the kitchen, he was able to give me a couple of parts I couldn&apos;t figure out and after a couple of tries, I came up with what ... I think is pretty close. First off it certainly is not difficult even though it sounds like it, it is NOT quick cooking, that I admit, but it certainly ISN 
 Cornbread Spicy Sausage Stuffing/ Dressing 
Sausage loaded dressing. Recipe #407287 was used to flavor the stuffing but your favored poultry seasoning will work fine. This makes enough to stuff the bird and have a casserole for crisper dressing. Leftovers can be frozen for future use.
