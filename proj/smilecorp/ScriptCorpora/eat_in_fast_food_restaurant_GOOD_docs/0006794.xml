 Description: 
 FIELD OF THE INVENTION 

This invention relates to a terminal and system for home or office initiated purchase payment transactions, bill payment transactions and other electronic transactions.
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 


Currently point of sale terminals have become common at such locations as: Carl&apos;s Jr., a fast food restaurant, Hughes grocery markets, and ARCO gas stations. To operate these point of sale terminals the user is prompted to insert his or her debit ATM (automatic teller machine) card or credit card into a terminal card reader located at the site of the purchase and then is prompted for his or her PIN (personal identification number) and then the user enters the amount of the purchase or the amount of the purchase may be automatically supplied by the register at the Carl&apos;s Jr. or the pump at the ARCO station. If approved by a remote host computer, funds are automatically transferred from the user&apos;s account to the merchant&apos;s account. Alternately, if the purchase is made with a credit card, then the amount of the purchase is automatically debited to the user&apos;s credit card. These point of sale terminals located at a merchant are designed to have a limited function and are convenient to use for that limited function; however, to be more useful it is necessary to have a system and terminal with additional functions.

Various portable terminals are in the prior art; however, they have various limitations. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,050,207 discloses a portable automated teller machine with transducers to couple to a host bank computer via a telephone handset of any phone. It allows the user to securely access bank and bank accounts and to securely effect either interaccount transfers or bill payments; however the device has no alphabetic keyboard, printer or magnetic card reader. U.S. Pat Nos. 4,689,478, 4,652,698, 4,536,647, and 4,454,414 for portable terminals have some of the same limitations.

U.S. Pat No. 4,341,951 has a mechanism for printing on a vendor voucher, but assumes that the terminal is portable and taken to the merchant, which is highly inconvenient and negates the concept of electronic shopping.

The current devices are not convenient or general purpose enough. For example, there is generally no convenient way to enter alphabetic data on these terminals. They are optimized for numeric data such as PIN and amount data. An example, is the popular VERIFONE, which like the devices above has a touch tone type keypad with the ten digits and &quot;*&quot; and &quot;#&quot;. As is normally the case on telephones touch tone keypads, letters are associated with each digit. For example, the letters &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; are associated with the digit &quot;2&quot;. It is possible to enter a letter by going into an alphabetic mode and by pressing the &quot;2&quot; key once, twice or thrice to pick a letter to enter; however, this is very inconvenient, and therefore limits the usefulness of these terminals.

The user in the home needs more functions than the typical point of sale terminal or VERIFONE provide. For example, most individuals pay monthly bills by writing checks and mailing or delivering them. It would be desirable to have a terminal in the home that could provide this function in a convenient manner. It would also be desirable to have the ability to pay for purchases immediately upon selecting an item to purchase, for instance an item in a catalog. This would speed delivery for the consumer and provide better cash flow for the merchant. Also, it would be more convenient and secure if the user did not have to give a credit card number directly to an operator or salesperson.
 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 


It is therefore the object of this invention to provide a terminal and system to allow debit and credit card holders the ability to conveniently perform various transactions from their home or office. The terminal is a single device, which has an alphabetic QWERTY keyboard, a numeric touch tone type keypad, miscellaneous other keys, a magnetic card reader, a display, a printer, a modem, and a serial port.

The terminal firmware supports various financial transactions including: purchase payment, bill payment, and settlement review. The terminal supports initialization, encryption, transaction generation, transaction transmission and data reception from a host system and receipt printing. Encryption of the PIN is performed with a derived unique key per transaction (DUKPT) algorithm.

A local data base including a transaction log and a profile list are maintained in the terminal memory. The transaction log stores purchase payment transaction information and is accessible as a stack with the most recent transaction on top of the stack. The profile list has entries for each specific bill pay account.

 DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS 


Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly, to FIG. 1, there is shown a top view of the terminal 10 in accordance with the invention. The terminal has a display 12, a qwerty alphabetic keyboard 14, a numeric keypad 16, and a magnetic card reader slot 54. Miscellaneous keys include: YES/ENTER key 18, NO/CANCEL key 20, CLEAR key 22, SEND key 24, up key 26, down key 28, left key 30, right key 32, ENTER key 34, rubout (Rub) key 36, space key 38, delete (DEL) key 40, insert (INS) key 42, parenthesis key 44, shift key 46, and alt key 48. A set of miscellaneous symbols 49 are available on the upper row of qwerty keys by using the alt key 48. Also available are the &quot;-&quot;, &quot;.&quot; key 50 and the &quot;/&quot;, &quot;,&quot; key 51.

FIG. 2 is a sectional side elevation view of the terminal. In FIG. 2 the magnetic card reader slot 54 between the qwerty alphabetic keyboard 14 and the numeric keypad 16 is evident, as is paper slot 52. Also shown in FIG. 2 are the locations of the printer 56, liquid crystal display (LCD) module 58, alphabetic keypad module 60 and numeric keypad module 62.

The display 12 in one embodiment is a liquid crystal with 20 characters×4 lines and is a supertwist, reflective display with black foreground on yellow/green background. Scrolling through the display is accomplished by using the left key 30, right key 32, down key 28, and up key 26.

The printer 56 is fed paper from a paper roll, which would be attached to the terminal. In one embodiment the printer would be a thermal type with a 7×5 character dot matrix. The printer can be implemented with a SEIKO MTP-201.

The magnetic card reader positioned alongside magnetic card reader slot 54 is a hand swipe, bidirectional type, and conforms to A.B.A. track II standard and can be implemented with a MAGTEK 21006505 I.C.

The overall system is shown in FIG. 3. The host system 80 is the engine that receives the terminal requests and manages the bank link interactions and consists of computers, modems, and communication drivers. Message traffic is predominantly initiated from the terminal 10 located in homes or offices. Transaction requests are connected to the host system 80 processing center through terminal line handler processes 82. The terminal line handler 82 process translates the terminal message format to an internal format used within the host system 80. These standardized messages are then passed to the transaction monitor 84 process, which determines the requirements of the request. If a PIN needs translation the transaction monitor 84 requests this from the security line handler 86, which is connected to a host security module 88 that performs all PIN translations. A PIN is always encrypted for transmission between secure zones. Encryption can be performed with a Racal Guardata RG6000.

The bank line handler 90 presents the request messages to the authorizing institution, which may be via debit network interface 92 to a debit networks 94, after translating the internal message format to the proper format. The response of that request is then sent directly back to the terminal line handler 82 process for return to the terminal 10. There is a bank line handler 90 for each link to each bank including the debit network, which could for example, include: EXPLORE, CIRRUS, INTERLINK, and PLUS.

The transaction monitor 84 process is responsible for all message switching decisions and required disk input/output for the host system 80. The transaction monitor 84 accepts requests from the terminal line handler 82 and bank line handler 90 and initiates requests to the security line handler 86 and bank line handler 90. It verifies the terminal, merchant and card as appropriate and will perform any standing processing required by the host system 80.

Additional message traffic can be initiated by the financial institution in the form of network control messages and key management requests. Requests are generated by batch processes and from customer and merchant support functions. These requests are channeled to the appropriate locations and replies are returned depending on the type of transaction being performed.

The terminal initialization 102 process provides terminal initialization of customer information. Merchant and customer service 100 provides the following information: transaction detail that can be inquired on by a merchant or a terminal; date and time; merchant setup information; and terminal setup information.

The batch processing 96 system provides settlement initiation to the associated bank line handler 90 processes and reports for the host system 80 can also be created from this process.

FIG. 4 is a functional block diagram of the terminal 10. A microprocessor unit 110, which can be implemented as an INTEL 8096, has interfaces with the remainder of the functional elements via three interfaces: an interface to a modem 146, address and data bus 112 and input/output bus 114.

The modem 146 comprises an analog front end 144, which is linked to a DAA 145 that is an interface that isolates the analog front end 144 from the phone line 148. The modem 146 is coupled to phone line 148 and has the following protocols: CCITT V.22 bis with 2400 bps synchronous and asychronous and 1200 bps synchronous and asynchronous; CCITT V.22 A&amp;B with 1200 bps synchronous and asynchronous; Bell 212A with 1200 bps synchronous and asynchronous; and CCITT V.21 / Bell 103 with up to 300 bps asynchronous. The analog front end 144 can also drive a speaker 150.

The address and data bus 112 is decoded by a memory mapped I/O decoder 116, which determines the sources and destinations for the address and data bus 112 including: memory 118, which has both random access memory (RAM) and read only memory (ROM) and has a plurality of banks selected by bank select 117; qwerty alphabetic keyboard 14, numeric keypad 16 and miscellaneous keys 122, which are enabled via select 124; and display 126, which is enabled via select 128. The memory 118 has 64K bytes, which is allocated to the program for the microprocessor unit 110 and the transaction log 119 and profile list 120.

The input/output bus 114 communicates via multiplexer 140 and multiplexer 134 to printer 138, magnetic card reader 132 and serial interface 130. The RS232 serial interface is 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, or 9600 baud, and has a XON-XOFF feature available.

Power is supplied by power supply 152, which uses normal wall power and a backup 3 volt lithium battery for non volatile memory support.

The terminal 10 requires software initialization for key information, dynamic customer dependent information and host initiated updates. After final assembly and test the terminal 10 is injected with the encryption key and terminal number. The Key injection is done by external connection to a Remote Key Injection Facility (RKIF), which is a secure device to inject the key information needed for handling PIN data. The base derivation key is the key used as a seed for injection into the terminals from the RKIF.

After purchase there are a series of functions that the terminal performs for initialization with the host system 80. First, the customer supplies customer information to the host system 80. On connection to the host system 80 via modem 146, the host system 80 reads the terminal serial number and validates it. Then the host system 80 loads the terminal with the customer name and address.

The terminal can then be updated based on information available to the host during the course of another transaction. For example: (a) the terminal 10 initiates a call to the host system 80 for another function; (b) host system 80 completes original transaction and notifies terminal that additional information is available, such as: changes to existing customer information; additions and deletions to the bill payment profiles; or software modifications in areas that are not protected.

The terminal is protected from undesired software changes by detecting any difference between a calculated checksum and a stored checksum. If there is any difference, then the following actions take place: the internal encryption key is erased; most of the internal software is erased or destroyed to be made unfunctional; the display is set to ask the user to call customer service in a unique way; and the terminal will initiate one call and notify the host of the current state and report the terminal number. Other software checks include a check code included with all merchant numbers, which is validated prior to acceptance and validation that all amount entries are within range and any entry outside of that range must be reentered.

The terminal maintains internal counters and status registers that are available to the host when requested at the end of a normal transaction. They include: total number of transaction requests; total number of encryptions; total number of approved transactions, which is a called a sequence number: last retrieval reference number received by the terminal: total dollar amount and transaction count for current date: and total dollar amount and transaction count for the last N days, where N could be 7 days for a week. The sequence number internal counter can be stored in memory 118 and is incremented by the microprocessor unit 110 when a transaction is approved. The sequence number can be used to track each approved transaction for the terminal.

The terminal manages a local data base including a transaction log and a profile list. Each of these are as large as the memory permits. The characteristics of these data bases are as follows:
 ______________________________________ 1. TRANSACTION LOG CONTENTS - The transaction structure contains all the information for purchase payment transactions. (1) date mm/dd/yy time hh:mm (2) amount: $&lt;amount&gt;(3) account #:&lt;account number&gt;/expire date (4) terminal#:&lt;terminal number&gt;(5) merchant #:&lt;merchant id&gt;(6) trace#:&lt;trace id&gt;(7) item#:&lt;purchased item identifier&gt;(8) account:&lt;account type&gt;savings, checking (9) sequence#:&lt;sequence number&gt;(10) authorization number:&lt;authorization number from host&gt;&lt;approved or denied&gt;(11) reference#:&lt;retrieval reference number&gt;(12) merchant name:&lt;merchant description&gt;STRUCTURE - This file is a stack with the most recent transaction on the top. 2. PROFILE LIST CONTENTS - The profile structure contains: (1) profile number (2) profile merchant name (3) amount to send (4) amount last sent (5) date last sent (6) next date to send (7) response (approved/denied) (8) card issuing authorization number from host (9) retrieval reference number (10) sequence number of last transaction STRUCTURE- The profile list will always be stored in prifile number order. ______________________________________ 




The profile number is selected by the host to signify a specific bill pay account. It references both the merchant number and also the merchant internal account for that user. The profile number is translated in the host to provide the merchant with the user specific information needed to credit the customer&apos;s account once a bill is paid.

The retrieval reference number is generated by the host to aid in tracking a transaction within the processing system. The retrieval reference number is built of the least significant digit of the year, the gregorian date and a sequence number that is reset at the beginning of each day and incremented for each transaction served by the host system 80.

The terminal 10 and host system 80 supports several types of transactions. The purchase payment transaction requests an authorization for a purchase from the selected merchant. FIG. 5 charts steps 159 to 188 for a purchase payment transaction and FIG. 6 is a purchase payment transaction receipt. The bill payment transaction provides a means for reviewing bill payment type transactions by inspecting the profile list and then initiating the actual money transfer to the selected merchants in the profile list. FIG. 7 charts steps 191 to 222 for a bill payment transaction and FIG. 8 is a bill payment transaction receipt. FIG. 9 charts steps 227 to 244 for a settlement review transaction and FIG. 10 is a settlement review receipt.

The purchase payment transaction is begun by communicating with a merchant and selecting an item. This could be done over the phone or from a catalog. Then payment is sent via the purchase payment transaction.
