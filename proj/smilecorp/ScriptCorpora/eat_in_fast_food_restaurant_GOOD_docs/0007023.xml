 wolram Feb6-08, 12:53 AM Is it because their lives are so busy they can not sit down to a proper meal, even then do they call a proper meal some thing that is out of a packet or tin.
I think most fast food tastes disgusting, years ago fish and chips were a Friday night treat
but now the vendors have lost the art, it seems to me they only wrap them in two layers of paper to soak up all the grease rather than keep them warm.
A burger from a fast food place only tastes of the relish, what is in the so called beef burger
i guess is any thing but lean beef.
When on very rare occasions i go to the supermarket, i see trolleys piled high with packets and tins of so called food, i would not call it food i would call it a concoction of ingredients that sellers can legally pass on as food, it seems modern man expects to eat gunge that has passed through a grist mill and needs the services of a chemist to add flavour, and may be the packaging costs more than the ingredients.
But i have worked in the food industry for over 20yrs so please keep tucking in or i will be jobless. Greg Bernhardt Feb6-08, 12:56 AM I agree most fast food tastes like trash. However I would say I eat fast food three times a week (3 meals). It is a matter of convenience. Usually it&apos;s ordering a sub/hoagie or getting a chicken sandwich at Wendys or KFC. Andre Feb6-08, 04:51 AM Occasionally I go to a shop of a certain large &apos;fast food chain&apos; to get a six inch parmesan tuna sandwich with lettuce, tomatoes, banana peppers, pickles, oignons, no sauce.

it&apos;s fast, delicious and not that unhealthy. Jimmy Snyder Feb6-08, 06:23 AM Our earliest ancestors were hunters who took a dim view of prey that was easy to catch. Easy to catch meant the animal probably was sick and not safe to eat. They prefered fast food and MacWendy King is just the modern manifestation of that preference. This is why when you don&apos;t eat fast food, it&apos;s called fasting. This is true even if you eat sloes. In short, the early bird catches the worm, food for thought for both birds and worms. hypatia Feb6-08, 06:40 AM The worm that sleeps in, lives! But hes missed breakfast, so he goes to McDonalds and eats a sausage biscut, which leaves him feeling rather like his uncle...Sluggish.
I do tend to eat fast food breakfast, a bagle with a scrambled egg on it, or a yogurt and fruit bowl. Their are healthy choices at most fast food places these days. Jimmy Snyder Feb6-08, 06:48 AM Sluggish.
So instead of worming his way out of sticky situations, he slugs his way out? hypatia Feb6-08, 06:58 AM Of course he does, he&apos;s a heavy weight! Moonbear Feb6-08, 07:11 AM What amazes me is how many people have simply not learned to cook! They get fast food because they don&apos;t know how to make a homecooked meal...and don&apos;t realize it would take less time to prepare than the drive to the fast food place. I had a student visit with me last month to shadow me, and she stayed at my home for two weeks. I made homecooked dinners for us, even with the busy schedule we had. She didn&apos;t know how to cook much, and was amazed at how simple it was to make very tasty meals (I taught her how to make a few of the dishes so she could go back to school and amaze her roommates). I think it&apos;s a shame when parents haven&apos;t passed on to their children the skill of how to cook, and of course these people who don&apos;t know how to cook will never be cooking for their kids either. Those are the people then end up at fast food restaurants every day.

Add fast food meals to the sedentary desk jobs so many people have, and we suddenly know why they all are getting so obese. The fast food chains have also completely distorted portion sizes. Wendy&apos;s actually dropped their smallest size fries and sodas about a year ago. Now a small is what used to be a medium. All the other sizes have increased too. Younger people are astonished when I explain to them that a small soda and fries, when I was a kid (i.e., what my parents would order for themselves), used to be the size of what is now a children&apos;s meal. And they no longer even have anything resembling what we used to get in a children&apos;s meal (by the time I was a teen, the children&apos;s meal was already increased in size to be a regular adult portion small fries and soda...when I&apos;d go out with my high school friends, we&apos;d order the kid&apos;s meal because it was plenty big enough for us). If you presented a children&apos;s meal to an adult as a full-portion meal now, they&apos;d look at you like you were crazy. scorpa Feb6-08, 07:15 AM I don&apos;t like fast food, i think most of it tastes horrible and a lot of it isn&apos;t cheap either! I only get it if I am in a bind and am so hungry I don&apos;t want to skip a meal....probably once every month or two. Kurdt Feb6-08, 07:22 AM I quite like the chicken burgers from fast food places like KFC and McDonalds. I rarely have fast food though. Perhaps once a month.

I thought that just represented good value for money.

Well yes a sarnie is a sarnie where ever it is eaten, i meant cooked fast food as in burgers,
kebabs, fish and chips etc.
And i agree with MoonB on portion sizes, it amazes me where some people put their food,
it seems all most impossible they could shovel so much in with out exploding.
I see another trick for selling in supermarkets getting more prevalent, the buy 2 for 1 or
4 for 3 etc, these may seem a bargain but it is just a ploy to get you eating some thing more regularly than you would normally. lisab Feb6-08, 10:33 AM ...it seems all most impossible they could shovel so much in with out exploding.

If they&apos;re soaking the grease out of the food, then they truly have lost the art of fast food. There&apos;s nothing quite like a bag of hamburgers from White Castle where, if you&apos;re a regular customer, they&apos;ll even toss in a little extra grease free of charge!

Extra grease on your hands is good. I never had my steering wheel suddenly lock up in the middle of driving even once when I used to eat at White Castle! :biggrin:

(Of course, back then, they didn&apos;t have steering wheels that locked up when the ignition key was removed, either. :frown:) jim mcnamara Feb6-08, 11:49 AM What amazes me is how many people have simply not learned to cook!&lt;snip&gt;
One member of our household has a Master&apos;s Degree in Culinary Arts - done in France.
He worked as a sous-chef and chef for several years. Guess what he eats for half of his meals... aww you figured it out :smile:

My daughter is married to another formally trained chef. Guess what he eats really often?

My youngest son has worked with these two chef-types and has learned a LOT about cooking. All he wants to eat is Taco Bell. Or frozen dinners.

It is cultural, imbued via the cute TV ads for children. All of these people are under 35, so they are all TV generation. My wife and I can go for months without burgers, pizza, KFC, etc. But I&apos;m not a TV generation kid. jim mcnamara Feb6-08, 11:54 AM In terms of grease, Rut&apos;s Hutt in Clifton NJ wins. Hands down. They deep fry hot dogs - Try a&quot;ripper&quot;. They change to frying oil once a year whether it needs it or not.
You can tell how far into the grease-change cycle you are by the intensity of your heartburn.
When I was at Rutgers, THAT was greasy fast food. Mk Feb6-08, 01:00 PM Back to the original post:

Why do I eat fast food?

It tastes good and gives calories. Same reason and the only reason why I eat food. turbo Feb6-08, 01:24 PM There was an old fellow in town who had a&quot;diner&quot;in a small trailer, and he made the tastiest cheeseburgers ever. He made them very thick and he basted them with lard from the grill as they cooked. He&apos;d scrape up the melted lard with his spatula and drizzle it on the top of the burger. lisab Feb6-08, 01:30 PM There was an old fellow in town who had a&quot;diner&quot;in a small trailer, and he made the tastiest cheeseburgers ever.

:rofl: Mmmmmm, an extra-greasy cheeseburger in a trailer...now that&apos;s what I call livin&apos;!

(Scary thing is, it&apos;s almost lunch time here, so that actually does sound good - yikes!) BobG Feb6-08, 01:54 PM That&apos;s the problem with the Carl&apos;s Jr commercials. They just don&apos;t get fast food. The character in the commercial is always dripping ketchup and mayonnaise. They&apos;re never dripping grease.

That&apos;s why I never eat there. Jimmy Snyder Feb6-08, 02:38 PM That&apos;s the problem with the Carl&apos;s Jr commercials. They just don&apos;t get fast food. The character in the commercial is always dripping ketchup and mayonnaise. They&apos;re never dripping grease.

I choose 1 and 4 turbo Feb6-08, 03:17 PM :rofl: Mmmmmm, an extra-greasy cheeseburger in a trailer...now that&apos;s what I call livin&apos;!

(Scary thing is, it&apos;s almost lunch time here, so that actually does sound good - yikes!)I helped a friend clean out a shed full of junk and he said he&apos;d treat me to lunch - just pick the place. I picked that little trailer and had a great time watching him grimace as the old fellow drizzled melted lard on our burgers. Despite the apparent unease, he enjoyed his burger after the first bite. Luckily, the old fellow was generous with paper napkins. Mmmmm, grease! Ivan Seeking Feb6-08, 11:16 PM Just heard this one.

According to McDonalds, the weight of the sesame seeds on the Big Macs sold each year in the US exceed the weight of two Boeing 747s. CaptainQuasar Feb6-08, 11:33 PM I actually prefer the way fast-food burgers, particularly McDonalds, are made. Very thin patties, diced onions, cheese placed while it&apos;s still on the grill. Whenever I have people&apos;s home-made burgers they always make them ridiculously thick, it&apos;s like eating a meatloaf sandwich to me. The whole putting lots of lettuce and tomato on a burger, I don&apos;t get it; if you wait a few minutes too long the thing is lukewarm. Lukewarm lettuce, yum.

Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I don&apos;t like steaks. Beef barbecue I can do but I just really don&apos;t like steaks. I eat a fair amount of vegetarian food too, though I&apos;m not a vegetarian. My arteries could stop bullets, I&apos;m sure.⚛ gravenewworld Feb6-08, 11:35 PM The funny part is the fact that people are quick to dump all over fast food chains, but in reality your favorite local non-chain restaurants probably serve up more fat and calories from a dinner there than a meal that you could get at a fast food restaurant. Yeah that caesar salad, with pasta and chicken, and a glass of wine probably set you back 2200+ calories. wolram Feb7-08, 01:16 AM It may be i am just to tight to go to restaurants or buy fast food, well may be once in a blue moon, if i do i go to a transport cafe ,there is usually one or two in each town, they may only serve fry ups but 9 times out of 10 the food will not be over greasy, these places soon
loose customers if the food is not up to scratch.
If i do go out for a proper meal it is to a place recommended to me, if i do not like what they serve i never go back. Contrapositive Feb7-08, 09:39 AM Yeah that caesar salad, with pasta and chicken, and a glass of wine probably set you back 2200+ calories.

Can you maybe provide a source for this claim? I find it very hard to believe a salad and chicken have more fat than a Big Mac. Evo Feb7-08, 09:50 AM Can you maybe provide a source for this claim? I find it very hard to believe a salad and chicken have more fat than a Big Mac.I believe it.

A ceaser salad covered in cheese and olive oil, chicken with a sauce full of cream and butter and restaurant portions are bigger than fast food portions ( only the fries and soda are supersize ).

I see the same thing, girls order the ceaser salad or baked potato (with butter and sour cream) instead of fries because they are on a diet. CaptainQuasar Feb7-08, 10:02 AM Can you maybe provide a source for this claim? I find it very hard to believe a salad and chicken have more fat than a Big Mac.

He said more than a salad and chicken. I&apos;m imagining one of those huge plates of pasta, slathered in a cheesy cream sauce, with a chicken breast on top, a drenched crouton-filled generously Parmesaned Caesar salad on the side, and a glass of some sweet wine. And that&apos;s the kind of restaurant that probably puts bread out beforehand and pitches appetizers to you too. Beats out a Big Mac no problem on both fat and calories, maybe even an entire mega-sized combo meal.

Y&apos;know how if a restaurant has no prices on the menu it turns out to be really expensive? The same principle applies for restaurants that aren&apos;t telling you how many calories are in anything.⚛ Contrapositive Feb7-08, 10:25 AM I believe it.

I don&apos;t eat very much per day because people don&apos;t need very much per day. It&apos;s usually one main meal, and then some assorted snacks and drinks the rest of the day. I try and go for big calories since I only eat once per day. Works fine for me, and according to most longevity studies, lower calorie consumption in captivity equals longer lifespan.

There is a low-fat big mac? But okay, you could compare McDonald&apos;s chicken salad to Applebee&apos;s Salad, Mesquite Chicken w. Dressing. McDonalds&apos; Southwest Salad with Grilled Chicken has 9g of fat (with or without dressing it doesn&apos;t say, but I&apos;m assuming not because it goes on to list dressing info on the same page).

True. But this is as close as you&apos;re going to get. gravenewworld Feb7-08, 11:08 AM Non-chain restaurants won&apos;t have their calories listed so you have to guesstimate. It isn&apos;t hard at all. A serving size for a peice of meat is the size of a deck of cards. A serving of pasta would probably be about two fistfuls of pasta. The average portions in American restaurants are OBSCENE. A glass of wine sets you back almost 200 calories alone. Eat a few slices of bread that they give you that is another 200-300 calories right there (assuming you skip butter). Caesar salads are supposed to be made with olive oil, but many many many places make caesar salad dressings with mayo instead. A restaurant sized caesar salad (that is not non fat) that is loaded with croutons and cheese will set you back another 400 calories (to be conservative). Restaurants in the US will typically give you almost half a box of pasta or more for a dinner. The pasta alone sets you back 400+ calories (being conservative). Include the huge amount of chicken you would get and that would be another 300-400 calories (being conservative). This is completely ignoring what type of sauce you get. A cream or white sauce would add on a ridiculous amount of calories and fat. Even if you get a red tomato sauce, the sauce is probably loaded with an entire days worth of sodium. So yeah that puts you in the range of 2000 calories for a single meal from a restaurant by being even conservative.

Restaurants, both chain and non-chain, give you much much bigger portions of food than fast food places and many times the items on their menu deliver more fat and calories than food from a fast food joint. Pyrrhus Feb7-08, 11:24 AM I&apos;m not a health nut. I go to the gym 4 to 5 times a week, i lift weights and i do cardio (ride my bike). I like the muscly look, but that doesn&apos;t stop me from eating hamburguers, ice cream and etc... The idea always is to keep an eye on what you are eating. If most of your intake is high in saturated fat and in general not healthy, plus you don&apos;t exercise regularly then it is a problem.

Frankly, i prefer a steak with its appropiate side dish and a glass of wine over any&quot;fast food&quot;:smile: gravenewworld Feb7-08, 12:08 PM I&apos;m not a health nut.

Don&apos;t get me wrong I love fatty stuff too like homemade pies, cookies, and ice cream. The whole key to managing weight is simply exercise and portion control. If I know I am going to eat ice cream after dinner then I will eat half the amount of meat and skip carbs and pretty much eat just the most nutrient dense foods which are mostly vegetables. turbo Feb7-08, 12:18 PM Before reading the quotes below, ask yourself if a Whopper with cheese is a less-healthy meal than the Garden Salad with Ranch dressing and garlic toast.

Are you sure about that? The page I linked to on the BurgerKing web site has the exact same product name as the first salad you mentioned - see how they&apos;re both called&quot;TenderCrisp&quot;?

I see you have your own survival skills. Go forth, great hunter!⚛ Gib Z Feb8-08, 03:59 AM I eat fast food at least once a day, everyday of the week except sometimes on Saturdays. It obviously isn&apos;t the best tasting or nutritious thing in the world but

1) Its quick. It doesn&apos;t get squashed or leak in your bag, its served hot.

2) Depending on what you get, it can actually taste ok.

3) It&apos;s just everywhere, when your hungry you grab a tiny snack.

I know theyre all pretty pathetic reasons, but those are mine. I&apos;m not even slightly overweight, but it may be because I burn all that fat off with my basketball regime, everyday at least 2 hours. wolram Feb8-08, 09:15 AM So why is there not fast food fish, like the famous crab cakes or cod slappers?

Well, it&apos;s not just regular fat. Saturated, trans-fat, and high levels of sodium are terrible for your body. All the preservatives probably aren&apos;t very good for you either. CaptainQuasar Feb8-08, 10:43 AM So why is there not fast food fish, like the famous crab cakes or cod slappers?

There is. That Long John Silver&apos;s place in the U.S. (God, every single thing on their menu tastes so horrible... what the heck do they put in their frialator oil? Or maybe it&apos;s the breading? Blech.) and fish&amp;chips chains in Canada and the UK.⚛ turbo Feb8-08, 11:00 AM Here in Maine you can&apos;t go anywhere without bumping into a place that sells fast-food seafood. Fish sandwiches (usually with breaded deep-fried haddock filets), lobster salad rolls, clam rolls (made with battered deep-fried clams), shrimp rolls etc. Almost every road-side take-out place offers seafood sandwiches and/or seafood baskets with french fries or onion rings. Almost every bit of it is deep-fried with the exception of the lobster, which is loaded with mayo when it is made up as lobster salad. Eat a steady diet of that stuff and you&apos;ll be sweating Crisco. mgb_phys Feb8-08, 11:17 AM I suspect this is another Scottish invention coming to America soon.

Yeah you could burn off the calories from fast food, but that still doesn&apos;t mean you are healthy just because you aren&apos;t overweight. Eating fast food all the time over a long period is bound to build up plaque in your arteries which could cause heart attacks, raise your blood pressue, and mess up your triglycerides and cholesterol levels. No matter how much excercise you do you won&apos;t be able to avoid those consequences if you eat fastfood all of the time.

We have those here in Canada, usually only at the festivals though, there will be a booth set up that sells them. turbo Feb8-08, 02:52 PM Another fat-laden monstrosity is deep-fried breaded ice cream. That gustatory travesty started creeping into Maine about 25 years ago as a specialty dessert served at&quot;Mexican&quot;restaurants. It seems that all the&quot;ethnic food&quot;restaurants up here have to offer&quot;novelty&quot;appetizers, meals, and desserts that would never be offered in the countries whose food the menu purports to offer. The best Mexican food I ever had was in a restaurant consisting of a row of joined shacks on the causeway between Tampa and Clearwater. I&apos;d just ask the waitresses to bring me whatever food the kitchen staff was having on their lunch breaks. The food was almost always out-of-this-world.

:rofl: Yeah, years ago, Chi-Chi&apos;s started that fried ice cream trend. Now I&apos;ve seen it in various other places...green tea ice cream tempura in a Japanese restaurant for example (it resembles green tea ice cream in a Twinkie shell, the best I can describe it...tasty, but obviously not the least bit authentic, and not something I think I could survive eating more than once a year).

Deep fried cheesecake




OMG they are soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good. All the deep fried ice cream, deep fried oreos, deep fried snickers bars, and deep fried cheese cake are good. The key is just moderation.

I always wonder how they are able to deep fry ice cream and cheesecake without it melting. wolram Feb8-08, 05:44 PM Moderation? just looking at them piles on the pounds. gravenewworld Feb8-08, 06:15 PM Moderation? just looking at them piles on the pounds.

That&apos;s why you only eat one of them and share it with someone else.

I happened to go on a trip to Texas the week after I saw that online and I actually drove out to the restaurant that serves it. It was dee-lish. They thought I was nuts to have traveled there from Boston for it. wolram Feb8-08, 08:01 PM I happened to go on a trip to Texas the week after I saw that online and I actually drove out to the restaurant that serves it.

I know its not good for me :( I just do it anyway&gt;.&lt;&quot;sigh. When I&apos;m at home, I think about it and realise its not good for me. But when I&apos;m out with my friends, the current issues are the only ones i think about :( Those current issues being time constraints, convenience etc etc binzing Feb8-08, 09:25 PM Often the best restaurants are very modest places. Another good sign is a cat or dog, especially if they&apos;re sleeping. hypatia Feb9-08, 12:39 AM I&apos;m really very glad I can not eat deep fried foods. But if I could, I&apos;d go for that deep fried Snickers! binzing Feb9-08, 12:41 AM I&apos;d prefer a deep-fried Milky Way better. turbo Feb9-08, 12:45 AM Tip: If you want the best Mexican food, go to a place where the parking-lot seems full (especially with pickup trucks with landscaping tools) and ask the waitress what&apos;s the best meal today. Don&apos;t try to schmooze her like many southern waitresses will do to you - be respectful and nice and ask what she (or the kitchen staff) thinks is the best meal of the day. You might end up with rice and beans and an enchilada - who knows? Chances are, your meal will be a lot better than you could get ordering off the menu.

I once tried ordering off the menu at a rustic Cajun place in Louisiana, and the waitress grinned at me. I asked if my French was bad and she said&quot;No, your French is very good, but your Cajun sucks!&quot;I asked her to order for me and just bring me a good meal, and I was VERY happy with it. smashingtime Feb9-08, 12:57 AM lol does subway count as fast food? it&apos;s good and i don&apos;t feel as gross after eating a subway than i would after eating mcdonald&apos;s or something. turbo Feb9-08, 01:05 AM lol does subway count as fast food? it&apos;s good and i don&apos;t feel as gross after eating a subway than i would after eating mcdonald&apos;s or something.It&apos;s fast food, but you can make LOTS healthier choices there than at a lot of fast food outlets. If you get a 6&quot;all-vegetable sub without oil or dressing or cheese, you&apos;ll have an OK meal with low fat and low sodium. It might not taste as good as something you could make for yourself at home, but it will be relatively healthy.

My wife takes salads to work. Lettuce, onions, tomatoes, peppers, etc. She doesn&apos;t use any commercial dressing - instead, she spices the salad with my home-made bread-and-butter pickles and my home-made hot chili relish. 0 fat, low carbs, low salt, and a lot of flavor. gravenewworld Feb9-08, 10:22 AM It&apos;s fast food, but you can make LOTS healthier choices there than at a lot of fast food outlets.

Not all fats are bad, in fact it has been shown that diets very low in fat don&apos;t really have any benefits either. You only really want to stay away from saturated and trans fats. Healthy fats like mono and polyunsaturated fats are good for you. I use extra virgin olive oil on almost everything. Fats from things like nuts and fish are also good.

http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/295/6/655Very true, but the fats used in fast foods are usually not very healthy. I use butter, olive oil, and peanut oil for cooking. Fast foods like French fries might actually be healthier for you if they were fried in lard, especially since lard can be kept much hotter without smoking and the fries would crisp faster and absorb less fat. wolram Feb9-08, 11:42 AM The best tasting chips are fried in beef fat, years ago one could buy (scratchings) the little bits of batter that came away whilst frying the fish, i think this stopped when modern oils were substituted i remember well Bolton&apos;s fish and chip van, one could tell when it was in the village by the glorious smell. turbo Feb9-08, 12:02 PM When I was a kid, I&apos;d sometimes peel and cut potatoes for a neighbor that owned a take-out stand, and she&apos;d&quot;pay&quot;me with French fries. She had two big fryolators - one for all the breaded foods like fish, clams, etc, and the other for French fries only. Everything was cooked very hot and fast in lard, and the spot was a favorite stop for Canadian tourists on their way to Old Orchard Beach for vacation. vBulletin®v3.8.7, Copyright©2000-2012, vBulletin Solutions, Inc.
