 Start-up says health care reform begins on the plate 
 
Start-up with backing from Groupe Danone undertakes health care reform by using a simple, low-tech premise: Eat healthier food to become healthier. Idea is to help companies move employees to better diets that, the logic goes, will reduce medical needs, thus cutting costs. Food is cheapest, simplest, most pleasurable way to deal with health, says head of Full Yield. Study shows that 75 percent of country&apos;s $2.5 trillion in health care spending addresses increasingly prevalent chronic diseases: obesity, Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cancer.

 Diabetes rates likely to double, may exceed all projected Medicare costs

Researchers&apos; estimates based on stable obesity rates. Greatest growth in obesity has been among obese diabetics who are getting heavier, but focusing solely on overall obesity rates minimizes the magnitude of a massive public health problem, says researcher.

 Experts rethinking nature of alcohol and addiction 
 
Humans rarely reach point of powerlessness over alcohol, addiction experts say. Many drinkers can evaluate habits and, using knowledge about genetic and behavioral risks of addiction, change them if necessary. Even some people with alcohol-use disorders, they say, can cut back before it disrupts education, ruins careers and damages health. Data suggest there are two forms of alcohol disorders: one in which the need for a drink takes over a person&apos;s life, and form in which people drink heavily for a period but then cut down and recover.

 Opinion: Health care new battlefront for more food industry rules 
 
Nevil C. Speer
 
Agriculture under siege from unrelenting campaign bent on denigrating our mission to feed the world; new front of battle is personal and global connotations (or lack thereof) for all types of food - McDonald&apos;s hamburgers, bean sprouts - and/or production systems. Anti-agriculture activists, food police potentially have new venue - health care - for uniting; convergence enables them to leverage ideology, impose new regulation.

 Pesticides, pollution in food supply linked to obesity epidemic 
 
Environmental chemicals may well account for good part of obesity epidemic, especially in those under 50, and may cause spike in infant obesity rates. Certain hormone-mimicking pollutants throughout food chain act on genes in developing fetus, newborns to reprogram precursor cells into lifelong fat cells, and they may alter metabolic rate, turning body into physiological Scrooge, research shows. Other research reports that the more pesticides children were exposed to as fetuses, the greater their risk of being overweight as toddlers; children exposed to higher levels of PCBs and DDT-related chemical before birth were fatter than others.

 Opinion: Losing ability to tax &apos;entertainment&apos; edibles 
 
Idea that junk foods (those high in salt, fat and empty carbohydrates but low in nutrients) can escape tax category of entertainment products like cigarettes or booze gives unfair tax and price advantage to non-nutritious edibles over real food. Joining feds&apos; scheme that harmonizes provincial and federal sales taxes means Ontario is giving up a cost-neutral way to shift behavior toward healthier choices, lower medical expenses. &apos;Pseudo-foods&apos; account for about 31 per cent of supermarket sales.

 Difficulty of diet changes hinders prevention as reform goal 
 
Despite broad consensus that it&apos;s cheaper to keep people healthy than to treat them for disease, rewards often fail to match costs of widespread testing and monitoring people with chronic diseases. Obstacles: Much of money spent on disease prevention goes for healthy people, and taking up regular exercise or eating healthier food is difficult, expert says.

 Opinion: Reform health care by preventing diet-related chronic disease 
 
Treating diet-related chronic disease accounts for 75 cents of every health care dollar, or $1.65 trillion in 2007, and 83 percent of Medicaid, 96 percent of Medicare. Nearly half of Americans have one or more chronic diseases; productivity loss is $1 trillion-plus per year.
