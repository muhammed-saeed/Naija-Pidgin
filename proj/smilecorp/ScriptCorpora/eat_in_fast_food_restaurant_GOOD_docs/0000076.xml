Stories

 Since many of you know Herb and Lenore Miller I 
pass this notice of her death..
  
Herb got credit (and very wealthy) from the Finney and Miller Basic and 
 Intermediate Accounting Textbooks (Professor Finney at the University of 
 Chicago was much older than Herb and died in the early years of the F&amp;M 
 editions). 
 However, our good friend 
 Herb readily admits that Lenore&apos;s contributions to these textbooks was 
 enough to warrant co-authorship status (although she refused this full 
 honor). Lenore knew a lot about accounting. She worked on much of the 
 end-of-chapter material.

Both Herb and Lenore were expert bridge players. They have one daughter 
 Barbara who I think earned a doctorate in religion from Harvard.

Both Herb and Lenore grew up in Iowa. Lenore actually grew up in Humboldt 
 which is quite near where I grew up in North Central Iowa. Humboldt/Dakota 
 City may be best known as the hometown (more accurately close by in Dakota 
 City) where Harry Reasoner was allegedly murdered late in his own life ---
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Harry_Reasoner 

Herb and Lenore were very generous to good causes.

When I was finishing up my doctorate Herb was a visiting professor at 
 Stanford. He and Lenore are the main reason that I started my accounting 
 faculty career at his home base of Michigan State University (where I then 
 met their very, very close friends James Don and Clara Edwards).

One of Lenore&apos;s favorite stories was when later in life she got an offer to 
 join the accounting faculty at a university and Herb would then tag along as 
 an unemployed husband. She did not accept the offer and later followed Herb 
 to the University of Georgia after James Don became director of the 
 accounting program and eventually Dean of the college of business.

My life is so blessed with fond memories of great friends.

Accounting Hall of Fame ---
 http://fisher.osu.edu/departments/accounting-and-mis/the-accounting-hall-of-fame/ 

Congratulations to the latest inductees into the Accounting Hall of Fame. On 
August 8, 2011 the following well known scholars and researchers will be 
inducted into the Accounting Hall of Fame:

 Gary John Previts
Reed K. Storey 

I&apos;m very sorry indeed that I will miss the induction breakfast on August 8 
(Dan Jensen is kind enough to invite me every year even if we&apos;re not blood 
relatives). Following her 14th spine surgery, Erika will not be able to get on 
an airliner for at least six months. And I will not leave her by herself in this 
recovery period. Sorry to miss this ceremony and the other networking that takes 
place at the AAA Annual Meetings. In my case there are fewer and fewer 
professors that I know at these meetings and more and more new faces that look 
awfully young.

I&apos;m especially sorry that I will miss Hall of Famer Steve Zeff&apos;s plenary 
session (Professor Zeff is the speaker chosen for the Presidential Address by 
current AAA President Kevin Stocks) ---
 http://fisher.osu.edu/departments/accounting-and-mis/the-accounting-hall-of-fame/membership-in-hall/stephen-addam-zeff/ 
Steve will be focusing on the history of the IASC/IASB. I would rather he 
focused on the failings of accounting research over the past five decades ---
 &quot; Research 
on Accounting Should Learn From the Past &quot;
by Michael H. Granof and Stephen A. Zeff 
Chronicle of Higher Education , March 21, 2008
Scroll down at http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/TheoryTAR.htm#Appendix01 

 Steve will also make a 
short presentation in a concurrent session following his plenary speech. That 
session will allow the audience to sneak in questions about how academic 
research could be doing a better job in helping the IASB. It seems obvious to me 
that if accountics research is to help the IASB then accountics research should 
first be validated with replications ---
 http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/TheoryTAR.htm 
I can sneak the replications topic into anything at any time --- even a Sunday 
School Picnic. 

The Category&quot;Recent Inductions&quot;has not been brought up to date by Dan 
Jensen at
 http://fisher.osu.edu/departments/accounting-and-mis/the-accounting-hall-of-fame/recent-inductions/ 

In 2010 there was only one inductee --- former Comptroller General and 
Deficit Fighter David Walker
Dan has not yet added David Walker to the list at
 http://fisher.osu.edu/departments/accounting-and-mis/the-accounting-hall-of-fame/membership-in-hall/ 
I think it&apos;s time to remind Dan to bring the site up to date for 2010 and 2011.

In 2011 the inductees will be Gary and Reed as noted above.
Good choices.

What has gone wrong with CPA auditors? --- http://cpawatch.org/CPAsGoneWrong.htm 
 
 Question
What is&quot;the&quot;major difference between medical research and accounting research 
published in top research journals? 

Answer
Medical researchers publish a lot of research that is&quot;misleading, exaggerated, 
or flat-out wrong.&quot;The difference is that medical research eventually discovers 
and corrects most published research errors. Accounting researchers rarely 
discover their errors and leave these errors set in stone ad infinitum because of a combination of factors that discourage replication and retesting of 
hypotheses. To compound the problem, accounting researchers commonly purchase 
their data from outfits like Audit Analytics and Compustat and make no effort to 
check the validity of the data they have purchased. If some type of rare 
research finding validation takes place, accounting researchers go on using the 
same data. More commonly, once research using this data is initially published 
in accounting research journals, independent accounting researchers do not even 
replicate the research efforts to discover whether the original researchers made 
errors ---
 http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/TheoryTAR.htm 

Nearly always published accounting research, accounting research findings are 
deemed truth as long they are published in top accounting research journals. 
Fortunately, this is not the case in medical research even though long delays in 
discovering medical research truth may be very harmful and costly.

 MUCH OF WHAT MEDICAL RESEARCHERS CONCLUDE IN THEIR 
STUDIES IS MISLEADING, EXAGGERATED, OR FLAT-OUT WRONG. SO WHY ARE DOCTORSTO A 
STRIKING EXTENTSTILL DRAWING UPON MISINFORMATION IN THEIR EVERYDAY PRACTICE? 
DR. JOHN IOANNIDIS HAS SPENT HIS CAREER CHALLENGING HIS PEERS BY EXPOSING THEIR 
BAD SCIENCE. 

&quot;&quot;Lies, Damned Lies, and Medical Science,&quot;by David H. Freedman, Atlantic , 
November 2010 ---
 http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/11/lies-damned-lies-and-medical-science/8269/ 
Thank you Chris Faye for the heads up.
 
 . . . 

 But beyond the headlines, Ioannidis was shocked at 
 the range and reach of the reversals he was seeing in everyday medical 
 research. Randomized controlled trials, which compare how one group 
 responds to a treatment against how an identical group fares without the 
 treatment, had long been considered nearly unshakable evidence, but they, 
 too, ended up being wrong some of the time. I realized even our 
 gold-standard research had a lot of problems, he says. Baffled, he started 
 looking for the specific ways in which studies were going wrong. And before 
 long he discovered that the range of errors being committed was astonishing: 
 from what questions researchers posed, to how they set up the studies, to 
 which patients they recruited for the studies, to which measurements they 
 took, to how they analyzed the data, to how they presented their results, to 
 how particular studies came to be published in medical journals. 

 This array suggested a bigger, underlying 
 dysfunction, and Ioannidis thought he knew what it was. The studies were 
 biased, he says. Sometimes they were overtly biased. Sometimes it was 
 difficult to see the bias, but it was there. Researchers headed into their 
 studies wanting certain resultsand, lo and behold, they were getting them. 
 We think of the scientific process as being objective, rigorous, and even 
 ruthless in separating out what is true from what we merely wish to be true, 
 but in fact its easy to manipulate results, even unintentionally or 
 unconsciously. At every step in the process, there is room to distort 
 results, a way to make a stronger claim or to select what is going to be 
 concluded, says Ioannidis. There is an intellectual conflict of interest 
 that pressures researchers to find whatever it is that is most likely to get 
 them funded.

 Bob Jensen&apos;s threads on what went wrong with&quot;accountics research&quot;can be 
found at
 http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/theory01.htm#WhatWentWrong 
 
Arrogant professors often assume that practitioner journals mostly publish 
fluff. In reality, practitioner journals often publish technical jargon papers 
for which academic experts are nonexistent or very rare finds by journal 
editors.

One of the great myths in academe is that academic research journals are more 
technical than practitioner journals. In reality sometimes academic journal 
editors cannot find a professor to referee a technical paper such as a very 
technical paper in insurance accounting, international tax accounting, ERP, 
XBRL, or many of the esoteric subtopics in FAS 133.

In reality, practitioner journals sometimes publish articles that are deemed 
too technical for academic accounting research journals. I mentioned previously 
that I submitted a rejoinder article to Issues in Accounting Education on 
accounting for derivative financial instruments for which the Editor could not 
find a single professor to referee the article. The IAE Editor then found to 
technical practitioners in Big Four firms to referee my paper --- http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/CaseAmendment.htm  

As a second illustration, two of my best technical submissions were turned 
back by academic journal editors with comments that they were too narrow and too 
technical for their academic readership. I then found a practitioner journal 
that had both papers refereed by Wall Street experts --- http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/Resume.htm#Published

 I have thought about what practice focused 
 accounting research would comprise and I have some difficulty seeing what it

 of some new building material. Medicine benefits by study of new drugs or 
 surgical techniques and so on. But accounting happens at the level of the 
 particular. Each accounting problem is unique to itself. Accounting is the 
 process by which double entry is applied to produce a representation of what 
 happened (or what might happen I suppose). 

 Short of the academic actually participating in the 
 messy practice of accounting I dont see how they can contribute to the real

 the academics and their students to help me? 
 
June 12, 2011 reply from Bob Jensen
 
Hi Robert,

Research is defined as a contribution to new knowledge whereas 
 scholarship is the mastery of existing knowledge.

You raise three questions of interest.

 The most important question is whether research on professional 
 problems is making a valuable contribution to the practice of 
 accounting? Obviously there have been valuable and monumental changes in 
 the practice of accounting such that it&apos;s obvious that somewhere at some 
 time new knowledge (research) contributed to those changes in accounting 
 practice. Otherwise accountants would still be sitting on 
 three-legged stools making journal entries and postings with quill pens .

  The second question is whether academic researchers made the seminal 
 contributions to valuable contributions to the practice of accounting?

  The third question is whether academic accounting researchers made 
 valuable additions to seminal contributions to of practitioners and 
 researchers in other academic disciplines?

  

 The most important question is whether research ( new 
 knowledge ) on professional problems is making a valuable contribution to 
 the practice of accounting? 
The answer to the first question is a resounding yes, although the&quot;value&quot;of&quot;new knowledge&quot;contributions varies greatly by topical area. Where would 
 tax practice be today without research on international and domestic 
 taxation, including legal and economic research? Where would accounting 
 information systems (AIS) be today without research on design, software, 
 security, hardware, etc. be without research? In your specialty, where would 
 forensic accounting be today without research on how and why frauds and 
 other types of cheating take place?

 

 The second question is whether academic researchers 
 made the seminal contributions to valuable contributions to the practice of 
 accounting? 
The second question is difficult and in some cases impossible to answer 
 unless a&quot;eureka moment&quot;actually transpired that led to improvements in 
 accounting practice. In most instances those monumental&quot;eureka moments&quot;just did not happen as research accumulated like bricks being added to a 
 building. Or the&quot;eureka moments&quot;transpired so far down at the foundation 
 level that they&apos;re sometimes forgotten when adding bricks to the upper 
 walls. For example, we can trace computer hardware back to the&quot;eureka 
 moment&quot;of the conception of a transistor (Shockley) and millions of other 
 Eureka moments in science and engineering technology taking place over the 
 past 100 years or even further back in time if we want to delve into the&quot;eureka moments&quot;in electricity.

On occasion we&apos;ve identified some&quot;eureka moments&quot;to accounting 
 practices. Bob Kaplan traces ABC costing back to such a moment in a John 
 Deere factory. Dale Flesher traced dollar-value LIFO back to a practitioner. 
 But those eureka moments are seldom identified since more often than not 
 changes in accounting practice are rooted in new knowledge in underlying 
 disciplines of science and engineering and the social sciences, including 
 economics. When there&apos;ve been&quot;eureka moments&quot;leading to changes in 
 accounting practice, those moments are almost never attributed to 
 academic researchers. Understandably they arise from practitioners 
 themselves seeking ways to improve their job functions and contributions.

Many changes in accounting practices are rooted in new knowledge of 
 financial contracting. Although options contracts can be traced back to the 
 Roman empire, things like interest rate swaps are rooted in an IBM contract 
 in the 1980s. And a defeasance contract can be traced back to an Exxon 
 contract in the 1980s. Major contributions to practice such as the 
 Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model can be traced to seminal moments of 
 academic researchers, but these seminal moments more often than not took 
 place outside the discipline of accounting.

Many&quot;eureka moments&quot;in fraud can be traced back to the perpetrators 
 themselves who dreamed up frauds that the rest of the world had never 
 dreamed of before the frauds actually transpired. Sometimes the clever 
 thinkers had not even finished high school.

The pickings are pretty slim when if we try to award&quot;Walker Prizes&quot;to 
 accounting professors who made&quot;eureka moment&quot;seminal contributions to 
 changes in accounting practice. As I stated above, changes in accounting 
 practice came more from bricks being laid in a building than where one brick 
 is designated as a cornerstone. The American Accounting Association has made 
 five&quot;Seminal Contributions to Accounting Literature Awards&quot;over the years, 
 but I doubt that most practitioners can name even one of the seminal 
 literature pieces, although some might&apos;ve expected Bob Kaplan to get an 
 award for his work in ABC Costing. But Bob will be the first to admit that 
 the seminal contribution to ABC Costing came from unknown practitioners in a 
 John Deere plant. The other recipients, including the Ball and Brown 
 initial award, built upon earlier research with seminal contributions in 
 economics and finance ---
 http://aaahq.org/awards/awrd2win.htm 
In any case, the changes in accounting practice that took place due to these 
 particular seminal contributions are very difficult to link. Practitioners 
 most likely would not have made any of these seminal research award.

 

 

 The third question is whether academic accounting 
 researchers made valuable additions to seminal contributions of 
 practitioners and academic researchers in other academic disciplines? 
If we confine ourselves to those contributions that changed practice, we 
 must conclude that academic accountants have their names etched into parts 
 of bricks put into practice buildings. Often the incremental value of 
 academic accounting research is mixed into the clay and mortar along with 
 other ingredients such that&quot;Walker Prizes&quot;would be very difficult to award 
 in terms of a what a particular author contributed to a particular brick in 
 the wall of practice. Certainly tax professors have added ingredients to 
 changes in accounting practice. AIS professors like Bill McCarthy have added 
 ingredients to changes in AIS practice. The academic works of some 
 professors like Mary Barth have added ingredients to accounting standards 
 even if we cannot point to a particular contribution that stands out above 
 all other contributions.

If we examine the American Accounting Association&apos;s Notable Contributions 
 to Accounting Literature Award we find few if any such awards that can be 
 linked to specific changes in practice --- http://aaahq.org/awards/awrd3win.htm 

Most practitioners (more than 99%) probably cannot name a single winner 
 of the NCAL Award and randomly picked academic accounting teachers probably 
 cannot do much better if pressed to name the title and/or author of one of 
 the literature pieces that won the monetary NCAL Award. Most of these awards 
 have been accoutics research awards chosen by accountics research 
 professors. Some NCAL Award winning articles, especially before 1979, were 
 actually aimed at changing accounting practice but the changes are generally 
 difficult to trace into practice. There are no Nobel Prize winners here 
 where practitioners can remember the importance of the literature piece.

Many of the contributions of academic accounting researchers have been 
 important in theory even if they did not have marked impact on practice. My 
 best example here is the 1976 NCAL Award to Yuji Ijiri. The contributions of 
 Yuji to accounting practice in the Year 2080 may be more appreciated by 
 practitioners than it is in the Year 2011 in part because as of 2011 Yuji&apos;s 
 contributions are just not yet practical for practitioners. The same might 
 be said for Carl Devine and many of the other recipients of this prize.

Very few NCAL Award recipients had immediate and marked impact on 
 practice, although the contribution of Eric Lie is an exception. Regulators 
 pounced upon his findings and changed practice immediately. Sadly he is a 
 finance professor receiving an accounting prize for an article published in 
 a non-accounting journal. Such is life on occasion when awarding a Notable 
 Contribution to Accounting Literature.

 In Conclusion 
In conclusion Robert, I would have to argue that accounting practice has 
 changed greatly in the past 700 years due to new knowledge, and new 
 knowledge was generated mostly by some type of research. More often than not 
 it was not accounting practitioners or academics who made the seminal 
 contributions. And more often than not the seminal contributions were 
 probably made by accounting practitioners vis--vis accounting professors, 
 but it is naive to deny that accounting professors did not make research 
 contributions that added to the clay and mortar going into the brick walls 
 of accounting practice.

My best example of changes in accounting practice is XBRL that is now 
 having and will soon have an even more monumental impact upon accounting 
 practice. If we try to provide seminal awards to developers of XBRL where do 
 we start since XBRL builds upon so many research contributions leading up to 
 XBRL ---

Charles Hoffman, a CPA practitioner, should probably get seminal credit 
 for making the leap from XML to the XBRL reporting system. But since Charlie 
 made his seminal contribution, many academic researchers in accounting and 
 outside accounting have made valuable contributions to this evolving change 
 in practice in accountancy.

It&apos;s new knowledge that leads to change Robert, and new knowledge is 
 research!
And research contributions are only seldom identified&quot;eureka moments.&quot;

 Question
Remember the days when Professor Abe Briloff was scouring annual reports and 
publishing red flags in Barron&apos;s about departures from GAAP and GAAS that 
sometimes immediately affected stock prices of companies, warnings that might 
otherwise have been overlooked by analysts less diligent than Professor Briloff 
and his students? ---

Barron&apos;s is still scouring quarterly and annual reports for red flags without 
the aid of Professor Briloff who is now over 90 years old and blind.

&quot; Barron&apos;s Red Flags: Do They Actually Work? &quot;by Tim Loughrana;

 Abstract
Investors are often concerned that managers might hide negative information 
 in filings. With advances in textual analysis and widespread document 
 availability, individuals can now easily search for phrases that might be 
 red flags indicating questionable behavior. We examine the impact of 13 
 suspicious phrases identified by a Barron&apos;s article in a large sample of 
 10-Ks. There is evidence that phrases like unbilled receivables signal a 
 firm may subsequently be accused of fraud. At the 10-K filing date, phrases 
 like substantial doubt are linked with significantly lower filing date 
 excess stock returns, higher volatility, and greater analyst earnings 
 forecast dispersion.

 Question
How are human beings more than the sum of their parts?
 Try applying Industrial Revolution cost accounting discoveries to this 
factory.

Jensen Comment
At first this seems totally unrelated to accounting, but there is an analogy 
here in the sense that much of managerial/cost accounting evolved from the 
industrial revolution and its factories as did the depiction of the human body 
as a factory. Factories of virtually all types are of interest to researchers in 
cost accounting and systems analysts.

The timing of this is even more interesting as we are in the dawn of a new 
era where parts of the human body in human parts factories.

I admit it&apos;s a bit far out, but that&apos;s one of the joys of being an accountant 
staring at mountains. I can afford the luxury of empty-headed daydreaming about 
the future of human beings and cost accounting.

Of course this also relates to the great debate over whether computers like 
HAL 9000 will one day think like humans and eventually become more creative than 
humans.

How long will it take to build a&quot;human&quot;factory that simulates the evolved&quot;human&quot;factory?

 Bob,

The model depicted by Fritz Kahn is a very partial model
(only anatomical aspects and physiological aspects only
at a very high level). In this model, the whole is a
sum of the parts. To be more than that, the model should
also exhibit evolution, learning,...

Work in that area goes by the name&quot;artificial life&quot;. Some

 Question
What are two of the most Freakonomish and Simkinish processes in 
accounting research and practice? 

 Accounting researchers may want to track Freakonomics 
publications along with the works of Mikhail Simkin at UCLA 

 Freakonomish and Simkinish processes in auditing pracice 
The IASB and FASB are moving us ever closer into requiring subjective 
evaluations of unique items for which CPA auditors have no comparative 
advantages in evaluation. For example, CPAs have no comparative advantage in 
estimating the value of unique parcels of real estate (every parcel of real 
estate is unique). Another example would be the ERP system of Union Carbide that 
has value to Union Carbide but cannot be dismantled and resold to any other 
company.

The problem with many subjective evaluations is that the so-called experts on 
those items are not consistent in their own evaluations. For example, real 
estate appraisers are notoriously inconsistent, which is what led to many of the 
subprime mortgage scandals when appraisers were placing enormous values on tract 
housing as if the real estate bubble would never burst. And placing a fair value 
on the ERP system of Union Carbide is more of an art than a science due to so 
many unknowns in the future of that worldwide company.

 Freakonomish and Simkinish processes in accounting research 
Secondly, accounting researchers may want to track Freakonomics and the 
related works of Mikhail Simkin at UCLA. Professor Simkin made quite a name for 
himself evaluating subjective evaluators and in illustrating the art and science

&quot; Measuring The Quality Of Abstract Art: Abstract artists are only 4 per 
cent better than child artists, according to a controversial new way of 
evaluating paintings, &quot;MIT&apos;s Technology Review , June 14, 2011 ---
 http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/26882/?nlid=4597 
 
 Here&apos;s a bit of mischief from Mikhail Simkin at the 
 the University of California, Los Angeles. 

 Simkin has a made a name for himself evaluating the 
 relative performance of various groups and individuals. On this blog, we&apos;ve 
 looked at his work on the performance of congress , physicists and even World War I flying aces. 

 Today, he turns his attention to abstract artists. 
 For some time now, Simkin has a run an online quiz in which he asks people 
 to label abstract pictures either real art or fake. It&apos;s fun- - give 
 it a go .

 One average, people answer correctly about 66 per 
 cent of the time, which is significantly better than chance. 

 Various people have interpreted this result (and 
 others like it) as a challenge to the common claim that abstract art by 
 well-know artists is indistinguishable from art created by children or 
 animals. 

 Today, Simkin uses this 66 per cent figure as a way 
 of evaluating the work of well known artists. In particular, he asks how 
 much better these professional artists are than children. 

 First, he points out the results of another well 
 known experiment in which people are asked to evaluate weights by picking 
 them up. As the weights become more similar, it is harder to tell which is 
 heavier. In fact, people will say that a 100g weight is heavier than a 96g 
 weight only 72 per cent of the time. 

 &quot;This means that there is less perceptible 
 difference between an abstractionist and child/animal than between 100 and 
 96g,&quot;says Simkin. 

 So on this basis, if you were to allocate artistic 
 &apos;weight&apos; to artists and gave an abstract artist 100g, you would have to give 
 a child or animal 96g. In other words, there is only a 4 per cent difference 
 between them. 

 That&apos;s not much! 

 Simkin goes on to say this is equivalent in chess 
 to the difference between a novice and the next ranking up, a D-class 
 amateur.

Jensen Comment
I did not see FAS 157 recommendations on how to capitalize and annually adjust 
the value of collaboration as an asset.

Investors who rely upon the balance sheet sums of IFRS-FASB fair values as 
surrogates of economic value are missing the big picture as much as our 
accounting standard setters are helping to mislead those investors. AC Littleton 
emphasized that historical cost accounting is not valuation whereas exit value 
accounting is valuation.

 &quot; 8 Simple Ways To Share Data Online ,&quot;by 
David Strom, ReadWriteWeb , June 17, 2011 ---
 http://www.readwriteweb.com/biz/2011/06/8-simple-ways-to-share-data-on.php 
 
 If you have to jointly 
 author a spreadsheet with a colleague, what is the first thing that you do? 
 Email it back and forth. This can be painful, particularly as you try to 
 keep track of your partner&apos;s changes and hope the emails transit back and 
 forth across the Internet. Add a third or fourth person, and things get 
 worse. Luckily, there is a better way, and a number of Web-based service 
 providers have stepped up with tools to make spreadsheet sharing a lot 
 easier than sending attachments. 

 We&apos;ve written about a 
 few of them, including Longjump and Hyperbase (one of our products of the 
 year for 2008), but I have tried a bunch others, and will show you what is 
 involved and how they stack up. 

 The process is very 
 straightforward: you either copy and paste data or take your spreadsheet and 
 upload it to the service, after creating accounts for you and your 
 collaborators. Then you can make changes via your Web browser, no other 
 software is required. Some of the services allow for more bells and 
 whistles. Setup time is minimal; your data is properly protected by the 
 service and safe from harm. And you don&apos;t need to learn any Web/database 
 programming skills either. 

 For many people, the 
 spreadsheet is still one of the most popular low-end database applications. 
 The rubric of a table of rows and columns is easily understood and can 
 easily be used as a way to view records and fields of a database. Plus, you 
 don&apos;t need to design special reports to view your data entries, and you can 
 easily sort your data without having to create data dictionaries or other 
 database structures, just use the appropriate Excel commands. Having a 
 specialized service that can share this data makes it easier to collaborate 
 too, whether your partners are across the office or on the other side of the 
 world. As long as they have an Internet connection, they are good to go. 

 There are eight different 
 services currently available, in order of increasing cost:

 When you decide on the 
 particular service, it pays to read the pricing fine print. There are 
 discounts for annual subscriptions on most services, and some such as 
 Smartsheet offer additional discounts for non-profit and educational 
 institutions. All of these services have 14 day or 30 day free trials to 
 get started, so you can get a feel of what is involved in manipulating 
 your data and how easy it is to make changes, produce reports, and 
 receive notifications.

Jensen Comment
Major delays are caused by divergent rules on revenue recognition. But there are 
other hangups, particularly in accounting for derivative financial instruments 
and hedging activities. The FASB does not agree with the IASB on portfolio 
hedging, netting rules, embedded derivatives, hedge effectiveness testing, and 
other chuck holes in the road to convergence. As I mentioned to Tom Selling, 
accounting standards convergence is like laying of fiber optic cable where the 
last mile costs more than all the other miles combined.

Bob Jensen is opposed to accounting standards convergence because, once the 
honeymoon is over, the IASB may no longer be as responsive to particular needs 
of any one of the 160 nations of the world, including the United States. The 
U.S. gets a lot of attention during the convergence courtship, but when the 
honeymoon is over we&apos;re likely to be ignored or worse --- like being pounced 
upon by our enemies.

I also do not like the loosey-goosey subjective nature of principles-based 
IFRS standards (whatever they are?) erasing the bright lines of FASB standards. 
A prime example of this is the loosey-goosey nature of hedge effectiveness 
testing under IFRS vis-a-vis the bright lines of FAS 133.

However, the IASB can win me over if it puts income statement comparability 
on a higher plane than balance sheet comparability, but that has the same 
chances as finding beautiful ice castles in hell. Neither the IASB nor the FASB 
can even define net income other than that meaningless number left over when 
balance sheet changes in fair values are netted out. Bob Herz recommends that we 
stop displaying this number in financial statements along with deleting 
aggregations in general.
 
 Question
What do CFO&apos;s think of Robert Herz&apos;s (Chairman of the FASB) radical proposed format for financial statements that have more disaggregated financial 
information and no aggregated bottom line? 

 As we moved to fair value accounting for 
derivative financial instruments (FAS 133) and financial instruments (FAS 157 
and 159) coupled with the expected new thrust for fair value reporting on the 
international scene, we have filled the income statement and the retained 
earnings statement with more and more instability due to fluctuating unrealized 
gains and losses. 

 I have reservations about fair value reporting 
--- http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/Theory01.htm#FairValue 

 But if we must live with more and more fair 
value reporting, the bottom line has to go. But CFOs are reluctant to give up 
the bottom line even if it may distort investing decisions and compensation 
contracts tied to bottom-line reporting. 

 Before reading the article below you may want to first read about radical 
new changes on the way --- http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/Theory01.htm#ChangesOnTheWay 
 &quot;A New Vision for 
 Accounting: Robert Herz and FASB are preparing a 
 radical new format for financial, CFO Magazine , 
 by Alix Stuart, February 2008, pp. 49-53 --- http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/10597001/c_10711055?f=home_todayinfinance 
 Last summer, McCormick&amp;Co. controller Ken Kelly sliced 
 and diced his financial statements in ways he had never 
 before imagined. For starters, he split the income 
 statement for the $2.7 billion international 
 spice-and-food company into the three categories of the 
 cash-flow statement: operating, financing, and 
 investing. He extracted discontinued operations and 
 income taxes and placed them in separate categories, 
 instead of peppering them throughout the other results. 
 He created a new form to distinguish which changes in 
 income were due to fair value and which to cash. One 
 traditional ingredient, meanwhile, was conspicuous by 
 its absence: net income. 

 Kelly wasn&apos;t just indulging a whim. Ahead of a public 
 release of a draft of the Financial Accounting Standards 
 Board&apos;s new format for financial statements in the 
 second quarter of 2008, the McCormick controller was 
 trying out the financial statements of the future, a 
 radical departure from current conventions. FASB&apos;s 
 so-called financial statement presentation project is 
 ostensibly concerned only with the form, or the&quot;face,&quot;of financial statements, but it&apos;s quickly becoming clear 
 that it will change and expand their content as well.&quot;This is a complete redefinition of the financial 
 statements as we know them,&quot;says John Hepp, a former 
 FASB project manager and now senior manager at Grant 
 Thornton. 

 Some of the major changes under discussion: 
 reconfiguring the balance sheet and the income statement 
 to follow the three categories of the cash-flow 
 statement, requiring companies to report cash flows with 
 the little-used direct method; and introducing a new 
 reconciliation schedule that would highlight fair-value 
 changes. Companies will also likely have to report more 
 about their segments, possibly down to the same level of 
 detail as they currently report for the consolidated 
 statements. Meanwhile, net income is slated to disappear 
 completely from GAAP financial statements, with no 
 obvious replacement for such commonly used metrics as 
 earnings per share. 

 FASB, working with the International Accounting 
 Standards Board (IASB) and accounting standards boards 
 in the United Kingdom and Japan, continues to work out 
 the precise details of the new financial statements.&quot;We 
 are trying to set the stage for what financial 
 statements will look like across the globe for decades 
 to come,&quot;says FASB chairman Robert Herz. (Examples of 
 the proposed new financial statements can be viewed at 
 FASB&apos;s Website.) If the standard-setters stay their 
 course, CFOs and controllers at every publicly traded 
 company in the world could be following Kelly&apos;s lead as 
 soon as 2010. 

 It&apos;s too early to predict with confidence which changes 
 will ultimately stick. But the mock-up exercise has made 
 Kelly wary. He considers the direct cash-flow statement 
 and reconciliation schedule among the&quot;worst aspects&quot;of 
 the forthcoming proposal, and expects they would require&quot;draconian exercises&quot;from his finance staff, he says. 
 And he questions what would result from the additional 
 details:&quot;If all of a sudden your income statement has 
 125 lines instead of 25, is that presentation more 
 clarifying, or more confusing?&quot; 

 Other financial executives share Kelly&apos;s skepticism. In 
 a December CFO survey of more than 200 finance 
 executives, only 17 percent said the changes would offer 
 any benefits to their companies or investors (see&quot;Keep 
 the Bottom Line&quot;at the end of this article). Even some 
 who endorsed the basic aim of the project and like the 
 idea of standardizing categories across the three major 
 financial statements were only cautiously optimistic.&quot;It may be OK, or it may be excessive.&quot;says David 
 Rickard, CFO of CVS/Caremark.&quot;The devil will be in the 
 details.&quot; 

 Net Loss From the outset, corporate financial officers 
 have been ambivalent about FASB&apos;s seven year-old 
 project, which was originally launched to address 
 concerns that net income was losing relevance amid a 
 proliferation of pro forma numbers. Back in 2001, 
 Financial Executives International&quot;strongly opposed&quot;it, while executives at Philip Morris, Exxon Mobil, 
 Sears Roebuck, and Microsoft protested to FASB as well. 

 (Critics then and now point out that FASB will have 
 little control over pro forma reporting no matter what 
 it does. Indeed, nearly 60 percent of respondents to 
 CFO&apos;s survey said they would continue to report pro 
 forma numbers after the new format is introduced.) 

 Given the project&apos;s starting point, it&apos;s not surprising 
 that current drafts of the future income statement omit 
 net income. Right now that&apos;s by default, since income 
 taxes are recorded in a separate section. But there is a 
 big push among some board members to make a more 
 fundamental change to eliminate net income by design, 
 and promote business income (income from operations) as 
 the preferred basis for investment metrics. 

 &quot;If net income stays, it would be a sign that we 
 failed,&quot;says Don Young, a FASB board member. In his 
 mind, the project is not merely about getting rid of net 
 income, but rather about capturing all income-related 
 information in a single line (including such volatile 
 items as gains and losses on cash-flow hedges, 
 available-for-sale securities, and foreign-exchange 
 translations) rather than footnoting them in other 
 comprehensive income (OCI) as they are now.&quot;All changes 
 in net assets and liabilities should be included,&quot;says 
 Young.&quot;Why should the income statement be incomplete?&quot;He predicts that the new subtotals, namely business 
 income, will present&quot;a much clearer picture of what&apos;s 
 going on.&quot; 

 Board member Thomas Linsmeier agrees.&quot;The rationale for 
 segregating those items [in OCI] is not necessarily 
 obvious, other than the fact that management doesn&apos;t 
 want to be held accountable for them in the current 
 period,&quot;he says. 

 Whether for self-serving or practical reasons, finance 
 chiefs are rallying behind net income. Nearly 70 percent 
 of those polled by CFO in December said it should stay.&quot;I understand their theories that it&apos;s not the be-all 
 and end-all measure that it&apos;s put up to be, but it is a 
 measure everyone is familiar with, and sophisticated 
 users can adjust from there,&quot;says Kelly. Adds Rickard:&quot;They&apos;re treating [net income] as if it&apos;s the scourge of 
 the earth, which to me is silly. I think the logical 
 conclusion is to make other things available, rather 
 than hiding the one thing people find most useful.&quot;

June 23, 2011 reply from Jagdish Gangolly
 
 Bob, 

 The years 1770-72 were also infamous for another 
 reason. The East India Company which had earlier used the grant given to it 
 by the Mughal emperor Akbar to the city of Calcutta had established its 
 control over Bengal. Its disastrous tax and other policies, compounded by 
 drought, led to the death by starvation of 10 million people. 

 Warren Hastings, who was the Governor General, was 
 later impeached (for corruption) and later acquitted by the British 
 Parliament. He was later made a Privy Councillor, a rather strange honour 
 for one who stood like a Greek hero, counting the British tax revenues 
 (which multiplied), while 10 million human beings died of starvation. 

 Venkat&apos;s lament about Alexander Fordyce&apos;s 
 absconding for half a million pounds debt is a petty matter relative to the 
 death of 10 million people caused by Hastings and his cohorts at the same 
 British East India Company. 

 Sen asks a profound rhetorical question why there 
 have been no famines in India since the British left. Democracy does not 
 permit it. 

 Edmund Burke&apos;s speech in the British Parliament in 
 the impeachment proceedings is, in my opinion, one of the finest pieces of 
 writing in the English language. Here is a snippet: 

 _________________________________________________ 

 My Lords, the East India Company have not arbitrary 
 power to give him; the King has no arbitrary power to give him; your 
 Lordships have not; nor the Commons, nor the whole Legislature. We have no 
 arbitrary power to give, because arbitrary power is a thing which neither 
 any man can hold nor any man can give. No man can lawfully govern himself 
 according to his own will; much less can one person be governed by the will 
 of another. We are all born in subjection -- all born equally, high and low, 
 governors and governed, in subjection to one great, immutable, pre-existent 
 law, prior to all our devices and prior to all our contrivances, paramount 
 to all our ideas and all our sensations, antecedent to our very existence, 
 by which we are knit and connected in the eternal frame of the universe, out 
 of which we cannot stir. 

 This great law does not arise from our conventions 
 or compacts; on the contrary, it gives to our conventions and compacts all 
 the force and sanction they can have. It does not arise from our vain 
 institutions. Every good gift is of God; all power is of God; and He who has 
 given the power, and from Whom alone it originates, will never suffer the 
 exercise of it to be practised upon any less solid foundation than the power 
 itself. If, then, all dominion of man over man is the effect of the Divine 
 disposition, it is bound by the eternal laws of Him that give it, with which 
 no human authority can dispense neither he that exercises it, nor even those 
 who are subject to it; and if they were mad enough to make an express 
 compact that should release their magistrate from his duty, and should 
 declare their lives, liberties, and properties dependent upon, not rules and 
 laws, but his mere capricious will, that covenant would be void. The 
 acceptor of it has not his authority increased, but he has his crime 
 doubled. Therefore can it be imagined, if this be true, that He will suffer 
 this great gift of government, the great, the best, that was ever given by 
 God to mankind, to be the plaything and the sport of the feeble will of a 
 man, who, by a blasphemous, absurd, and petulant usurpation, would place his 
 own feeble, comtemptible, ridiculous will in the place of the Divine wisdom 
 and justice? 

 The title of conquest makes no difference at all. 
 No conquest can give such a right; for conquest, that is force, cannot 
 convert its own injustice into a just title by which it may rule others at 
 its pleasure. By conquest, which is a more immediate designation of the hand 
 of God, the conqueror succeeds to all the painful duties and subordination 
 to the power of God which belonged to the sovereign whom he has displaced, 
 just as if he had come in by the positive law of some descent or some 
 election. To this at least he is strictly bound: he ought to govern them as 
 he governs his own subjects. But every wise conqueror has gone much further 
 than he was bound to go. It has been his ambition and his policy to 
 reconcile the vanquished to his fortune, to show that they had gained by the 
 change, to convert their momentary suffering into a long benefit, and to 
 draw from the humiliation of his enemies an accession to his own glory. This 
 has been so constant a practice, that it is to repeat the histories of all 
 politic conquerors in all nations and in all times; and I will not so much 
 distrust your Lordships&apos; enlightened and discriminating studies and correct 
 memories as to allude to any one of them. I will only show you that the 
 Court of Directors, under whom he served, has adopted that idea that they 
 constantly inculcated it to him, and to all the servants that they run a 
 parallel between their own and the native government, and, supposing it to 
 be very evil, did not hold it up as an example to be followed, but as an 
 abuse to be corrected that they never made it a question, whether India is 
 to be improved by English law and liberty, or English law and liberty 
 vitiated by Indian corruption. ... ...

 2010 PCAOB Annual Report --- http://www.iasplus.com/usa/pcaob/2010annualreport.pdf 
 
Registration
 
The number of accounting firms registered with the PCAOB 
 grew slightly in 2010. At the end of the year, 2,397 firms were registered 
 with the PCAOB, including 1,503 domestic firms and 894 non-U.S. firms 
 located in 86 jurisdictions.

In 2010, registered firms began filing annual reports and 
 special reports on certain events.
 
Inspections
 
In 2010, the PCAOB conducted inspections of nine public 
 accounting firms that performed more than 100 audits of public companies 
 traded in U.S. markets. Inspectors examined portions of more than 350 audits 
 performed by these firms. The PCAOB also inspected 245 firms with 100 or 
 fewer public company audit clients, including 64 non-U.S. firms located in 
 20 jurisdictions.

In the course of those inspections, PCAOB staff examined 
 portions of more than 600 audits.
 
Standards
 
In 2010, the Board adopted a suite of eight standards 
 related to the assessment of and response to risk in an audit. The standards 
 address many fundamental aspects of the audit, from the initial planning 
 stages through the evaluation of audit results. Continued fallout from the 
 financial crisis, as well as an increase in certain non-U.S. companies 
 seeking capital in U.S. markets, prompted the PCAOB to alert auditors to 
 existing standards relating to public companies use of unusual 
 transactions; disclosure of potential liabilities related to mortgages and 
 foreclosures; and reliance on the work of other firms or assistants engaged 
 from outside the firm, including those based in non-U.S. jurisdictions, 
 where the PCAOB may be barred from inspecting firms.

The Board also proposed new standards for confirmation 
 procedures by auditors and for communications with audit committees. In 
 2010, the Board laid the groundwork for possible changes to the auditors 
 report. PCAOB staff began a comprehensive outreach program to gather 
 information from investors, preparers, issuers and auditors about the 
 content and format of audit reports and the implications of potential 
 changes.
 
Enforcement
 
In 2010, the Board initiated 15 formal investigations, 
 conducted a number of informal inquiries and continued investigations that 
 began in prior years. At the end of December 2010, the PCAOB was engaged in 
 23 formal investigations. PCAOB investigations are, by law, confidential and 
 nonpublic.

The Board issued seven settled disciplinary orders in 2010, 
 imposing sanctions ranging from censures to bars on association with 
 registered accounting firms, as well as monetary penalties.

Other disciplinary proceedings were approved by the Board in 
 2010 and are in active litigation. Unlike similar auditor proceedings 
 brought by the SEC, Board disciplinary proceedings are nonpublic as required 
 by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
 
SEC Oversight
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act gives the Securities and 
 ExchangeCommission oversight authority over the PCAOB.

&quot; Haile Reviews Shaviro&apos;s Decoding the U.S. Corporate Tax ,&quot;by Paul Caron, Tax Professor Blog, June 23, 2011 ---
 http://taxprof.typepad.com/ 
 Andy Haile (Elon) has published  Book 
Review , 2 Elon L. Rev. 287 (2011) (reviewing Daniel N. Shaviro (NYU), Decoding the U.S. Corporate Tax (Urban Institute Press, 2009)): 
 Is it possible to make a book about reforming the 
 U.S. corporate tax accessible and interesting? Daniel Shaviro does a 
 credible job of both in Decoding the U.S. Corporate Tax . While tax 
 policymakers and professors constitute the most likely audience to read and 
 appreciate the book, Professor Shaviros entertaining writing style makes 
 the book a useful primer for anyone interested in understanding the 
 theoretical foundations (or lack thereof) of the existing corporate tax as 
 well as possible future directions for the tax. 
 
 House Sales Tax in the Health Care Bill ---
 http://www.snopes.com/politics/taxes/realestate.asp 
 
Mixture of True and False Information That the Obamacare Legislation 
 Kicks in a 3.8% Sales Tax

False: Health care legislation imposes a 3.8% sales tax on all 
 house sales in the United States

True: Health care legislation imposes a 3.8% transactions tax on 
 profits over the capital gains
         The calculation is really 
 quite complicated
 
Question
Does this transactions tax apply to profits that are plowed back into another 
house?

Jensen Comment
Although New Hampshire has a no sales tax on most items other than restaurant 
and hotel bills, it does have a formidable sales tax on the prices paid for real 
estate. Typically, 7% of the price is paid by the buyer and 8% is paid by the 
seller, although who pays what can be negotiated in the sales contract. This 
came as a surprise to me after I made an offer to buy the mountain cottage where 
I now live.

 
 
 Capture of Regulators by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ,&quot;by Nobel 
Laureate Gary Becker, Becker-Posner Blog , June 12, 2011 ---
 http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/2011/06/capture-of-regulators-by-fannie-mae-and-freddie-mac-becker.html 
 
 Political economists describe the process whereby 
 government officials end up being the servants rather than the masters of 
 the firms they are regulating as the capture by the industry of their 
 regulators. When regulators are captured, much of what they do is motivated, 
 consciously or not, by a desire to help the companies they are regulating, 
 even when the social goals that the regulators should pursue are very 
 different. 

 A famous illustration of capture is given by the 
 way airlines were regulated under the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) from 
 1940 to 1978. Large airlines of those times, like American and Delta, 
 naturally had a strong incentive to try to keep new airlines from entering 
 the industry. As a compliant ally of the airline industry, the CAB did not 
 approve one new interstate airline during this almost 40-year period. Many 
 airlines entered the industry when President Carter abolished the CAB, and 
 some of the old standbys, such as Pan Am and Eastern, ceased operations 
 because they could not adjust to a competitive environment. 

 An economically disastrous example of the capture 
 theory is provided by the disgraceful regulation of the two mortgages 
 housing behemoths, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, before and leading up to the 
 financial crisis. In their fascinating recent book, Reckless Endangerment, 
 Gretchen Morgenson and Joshua Rosner explore in great detail how Fannie Mae 
 used political connections and intimidation of anyone who stood in their way 
 to gain a highly dominant position in the residential mortgage market. The 
 authors show that various government officials, including congressmen and 
 presidential cabinet members, closed their eyes to what these two 
 government-supported enterprises (GSE) were doing. They allowed them to take 
 on enormous risks, while publicly defending their behavior as not being 
 highly risky. 



 Fannie Mae was created in 1938 as a government 
 enterprise that purchased mortgages from banks that loaned money to 
 homebuyers. It eventually became a private investment company regulated by 
 the government, where investors expected that the government would help out 
 if these companies got into trouble. By the beginning of the crisis in 2008, 
 Fannie and Freddie held or guaranteed about half of the United States $12 
 trillion of assets in the residential mortgage market. In September 2008, 
 both Fannie and Freddie were taken over by the federal government when they 
 became insolvent. The loss to taxpayers is likely to be in the hundreds of 
 billions of dollars because many of the mortgages are subprime and of little 
 value. 

 Reckless Endangerment shows how the chief executive 
 officers of Fannie Mae furthered the reach and reduced the regulatory 
 control over their company by assiduously courting congressmen, Fed 
 officials, the Congressional Budget Office, high-level officials of the U.S. 
 Treasury, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and major 
 economists. The prominent and well informed congressman, Barney Frank, gets 
 especially sharp criticism for his continual support of Fannie and Freddie 
 while he was initially a member, and later chairman, of the House Financial 
 Services Committee, the powerful committee charged with oversight of the 
 housing and financial sectors. Barney Frank remained an unwavering supporter 
 of Fannie and Freddie until 2010, when he admitted that they should have 
 been more closely regulated. In a bit of irony, he is a principal author of 
 the 2010 Dodd-Frank act that attempts to reform the financial sector mainly 
 by giving even greater discretion to the regulators. 

 Fannie and Freddie had so much money and political 
 power at their disposal that it became risky for anyone to oppose what they 
 wanted: large increases in their holdings of subprime and other mortgages, 
 with no questions asked. Different government agencies that were supposed to 
 either regulate or oversee these GSEs ended up as advocates instead. 
 Well-known economists wrote favorable articles downplaying the riskiness of 
 the holdings of Fannie and Freddie. These articles were sometimes published 
 in journals or other publications sponsored by these companies. 

 A few government officials were brave enough to 
 risk the wrath of Fannie and Freddie. The authors give particular praise to 
 June ONeill (I am proud to say she is a former student of mine), who was 
 then head of the Congressional Budget Office. A member of her staff wrote a 
 report that was critical of the degree of risk to taxpayers from the assets 
 held by Fannie and Freddie. These companies tried to get June to suppress 
 the report- she refused- and then a few members of the House of 
 Representatives in cahoots with Fannie and Freddie subjected her to vicious 
 attacks when she steadfastly defended the report in testimony before 
 Congress.

&quot; Capture Theory and the Financial Crisis ,&quot;by Richard Posner, Becker-Posner Blog , June 12, 2011 ---
 http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/2011/06/capture-theory-and-the-financial-crisisposner.html 
 
 The phenomenon of regulatory capturethe 
 transformation of a regulatory agency into an anticompetitive tool of the 
 regulated industryis real, but I think Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are more 
 accurately regarded as examples, though no less unlovely, of something else: 
 a capitalist-socialist hybrid. They were not regulatory agencies; until they 
 collapsed during the financial crisis of 2008 and were taken over by the 
 federal government, they were private corporations that had been chartered 
 by Congress to promote home ownership. Their status as GSEs 
 (government-sponsored enterprises) created an expectation that the 
 government would guarantee their debts. This expectation enabled them to 
 borrow at lower interest rates than other private corporations. They were 
 supposed to promote home ownership by buying or guaranteeing home mortgages. 
 They did that; they also pioneered mortgage securitizationin effect turning 
 mortgages into bonds, which are more liquid than mortgages and so could be 
 sold all over the world, bringing more capital into the U.S. residential 
 real estate market, thus promoting home ownership, just as Congress wanted. 
 Because of the low interest rates they paid, Fannie and Freddie were 
 immensely profitable until the financial crisis brought them down. 

 As Becker points out, Fannie and Freddie were 
 effective in obtaining congressional and presidential assistance to ward off 
 threats to their activities and their profits. But I dont think that that 
 assistance, unseemly as it was, and perhaps corrupt as well, was the basic 
 problem of Fannie and Freddie, or the cause of their collapse; nor do I 
 think their collapse was of any great consequence for the nation. 

 I dont think there was ever a good reason to 
 promote home ownership over renting (so I would favor the abolition of the 
 deductibility of mortgage interest from federal income tax). It ties up a 
 lot of the capital of individuals and reduces labor mobility. Maybe it makes 
 for more responsible citizens by giving people a property interest, but 
 there must be better candidates for federal largesse. And even if there were 
 a good reason for government to promote home ownership, federal chartering 
 of mortgage institutions would not be a sensible means of implementation. 
 Are the external benefits of home ownership, if any, so great that the 
 mortgage-interest tax deduction is not subsidy enough? True, the lower the 
 interest rates that Fannie and Freddie paid to borrow money, the riskier the 
 mortgage loans they would agree to underwrite by buying or guaranteeing the 
 loans, but home ownership is not promoted in any meaningful sense by the 
 granting of mortgages to people likely to default. 

 Conservative critics led by Peter Wallison of the 
 American Enterprise Institute lay on Fannie and Freddie a significant 
 measure of blame for the housing bubble of the early 2000s and the ensuing 
 financial crisis of September 2008. But these critics have not persuaded me. 
 Private banks like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs and Countrywide bought 
 mortgages, securitized them, and sold interests in them (these firms also 
 bought mortgage-backed securities created by other financial firms)a 
 sequence wholly separate from the activities of Fannie and Freddie. It was 
 an immensely profitable activity, so there is no reason to think that had 
 there been no Fannie and Freddie the volume of mortgage-backed securities 
 would have been less than it was. Whether a market has X firms or X 1 firm 
 is unlikely to affect the volume of market activity. I dont think Fannie 
 and Freddie took more risks than their competitors; the difference is that 
 they were more deeply committed to the housing market (that was their 
 mission) than most other firms, so less likely to survive a housing bubble. 

 The financial crisis might actually have been worse 
 without Fannie and Freddie. They collapsed and were simply taken over by the 
 federal government. Had their debts instead been debts of Morgan and Goldman 
 and other private banks, those banks might have collapsed and been taken 
 over by the federal government as well, providing daunting challenges to the 
 governments ability to run the banking system. The cost to society of the 
 governments taking over Fannie and Freddie is hard to estimate. The 
 takeover resulted in a transfer payment to creditors of Fannie and Freddie 
 from (ultimately) the federal taxpayer. Had there been no Fannie or Freddie, 
 other mortgage companies would have had more debt, and the owners of that 
 debt would also have been bailed out by the federal government, in all 
 likelihood. 

 Congress would do well to abolish Fannie and 
 Freddie. But it wont. The constellation of political forces that supports 
 subsidizing home ownership is too strong.

 With online data security being at the forefront of

 service Dropbox is now coming under fire for the way they handle customers 
 files. 

 Christopher Soghoian, PhD and security researcher 
 for the University of Indiana recently sent a letter to the U.S. Federal 
 Trade Commission stating that the companys security practices do not live 
 up to their advertised claim 
 . . . 
 The company claims to have 25 million users who 
 save up to 200 million files to their servers daily. 

 After reading through the complaint, Dropboxs 
 original statements about their security levels seem glaringly inaccurate 
 compared to the reality theyve admitted. I would be surprised if the FTC 
 didnt levy a fine on the company in addition to requiring refunds to 
 customers.

 Dah --- On Rebooting My Wireless Router 
Even though I recently purchased a high end Windows 7 Dell laptop, I&apos;ve very 
disappointed in the speed of the machine relative to my old reliable Dell XP 
machine. For example, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, and IE are all much 
slower on the new machine even though I took pains to delete apps that were 
slowing the browsers down.

Last week my old and reliable XP laptop kept losing its wireless Internet 
connection. I thought it was the computer since my same home wireless router was 
still serving the Windows 7 computer reliably. I took the XP laptop to the local 
company (Amanoosic) that installed my wireless system, and their technician 
could find nothing wrong with my XP computer in his office. But when I brought 
it back home it was still being flaky about holding its Internet connection. 
Then I performed the dah task of rebooting my wireless system by simply pulling 
the power plug for 30 seconds. That solved my Internet connection problem on the 
XP computer.

I should&apos;ve known better since I sometimes had to reboot my old hard-wired 
router to restore Internet connections. I guess I was misled since my new 
wireless router was working fine with my newer Windows 7 laptop. At least that&apos;s 
my excuse for today.

 FrontPage --- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontpage 
Yesterday I paid $199 to order a complete&quot;new&quot;in-the-box 2003 version of 
FrontPage that Microsoft has not sold in years. I have a 2003 version on my XP 
machine but lost the installation disks when I retired from Texas to New 
Hampshire in 2006. Around 2006, Microsoft replaced FrontPage with Microsoft 
Expression Web. I assumed EW would be better than FrontPage --- wrong! From the very beginning EW has been ten or more times slower than FrontPage for 
various tasks, especially when loading and saving large files that are more than 
2 Mb in size. FrontPage will load and save such files in seconds whereas EW 
takes 5-30 minutes to load and save a large htm file.

Hence, even though I have EW Version 4 on my new Windows laptop, I plan to 
uninstall it and replace it with the much faster and much older FrontPage. 
Microsoft admits it has been deluged with complaints about the slowness of EW 
and promises to have some fixes later in the year, but I&apos;ll only believe that 
when I put it to the test after Microsoft upgrades EW for more speed with large 
htm files. Microsoft might succeed in making EW more effective and efficient. 
Most readers probably do not recall that the early versions of FrontPage would 
not even create or load a large htm file. Then as if by magic, FrontPage became 
the best or one of the best programs for creating, loading, and saving very 
large htm files.

Both FrontPage 2003 and EW 4 are poorly coded according to computer 
scientists (who generally think almost everything from Microsoft is badly 
coded). But I&apos;ve not yet found a better HTML editor for large htm files than 
FrontPage. Many of my htm files are in the 3 Mb to 19 Mb range and most of them 
do not even have pictures and other multimedia since I&apos;m trying to keep size 
down when possible.

I know I should split my large htm files into fragments, but this makes word 
searching terribly inefficient for users of my htm files.

If people tell me they are MS Office users and ask my advice about creating 
htm files for their Web servers, I advise them to first look into creating MS 
Word doc (or docx) files for storage and editing. Then any file (large or small) 
to be sent to a Web server can be saved as an htm file. But this was not an 
option back in the 1990s when I commenced many of my large htm files. In those 
days it was not possible to also save a doc file as a htm file using MS Word.

 Accountants are Blameless --- Really! 

From the Tax Professor Blog on June 14, 2011 --- http://taxprof.typepad.com/ 
 
Tax Court Rejects Private Equity Manager&apos;s &apos;Blame the Accountant&apos; 
 Defense
 The Tax Court yesterday denied the request of Stephen G. Woodsum , founding managing director of Summit Partners , a private equity firm, to waive a 
 $104,000 penalty assessed by the IRS for his failure to report on his 
 return $3.4 million of income from the termination of a swap transaction 
 by Deutsche Bank for which he received a Form 1099-MISC. The Tax Court 
 forcefully rejected his attempt to escape the penalty by blaming his 
 accountant for the underreporting. Woodsum v. Commissioner , 136 T.C. No. 29 (June 13, 
 2011): 
 Mr. Woodsum terminated the swap ahead of its 
 set termination date because his watchful eye noted that it was not 
 performing satisfactorily as an investment. That is, when his own 
 receiving of income was in question, Mr. Woodsum was evidently alert and 
 careful. But when he was signing his tax return and reporting his tax 
 liability, his routine was so casual that a halfmillion- dollar 
 understatement of that liability could slip between the cracks. We 
 cannot hold that this understatement was attributable to reasonable 
 cause and good faith.

How do you value lewd pictures sent to you by Rep. Weiner?

 The practice was especially visible last week when 
 ABC News ran an exclusive interview with Meagan Broussard, one of the women 
 who was sent lewd photos by Anthony Weiner, after the network paid her about 
 $15,000 for photos. ABC said it&apos;s extensive reporting, including the 
 interview, led to Mr. Weiners admissions about his online behavior.

Jensen Comment
Seriously, how do you report fair value of an asset that deflates very quickly 
in value after the balance sheet date even though it had much higher value on 
the balance sheet date --- such as lewd photos paid for just before the 
fiscal-year cutoff on June 30, 2011?

Does FAS 157 cover this serious post-date valuation aspect of fair value 
accounting?
What if the valuation deflation is very hard to predict at the time the audited 
financial statements are released to the public?

50 Fantastic Accounting Blogs --- http://www.onlineaccountingdegree.org/best-accounting-blogs 

Jensen Comment
I applaud the sites that made the Top 50. However, I question the bias of the 
OnlineAccountingDegree.com site itself. It&apos;s sponsored by For-Profit 
universities that do not have AACSB accreditation when, in my viewpoint, 
students should first seek out online accounting degree programs in 
AACSB-accredited universities. Go to at http://www.onlineaccountingdegree.org/ and do a search for online accounting 
degree programs. None of those listed will have the quality mark of AACSB 
accreditation. All will be For-Profit online accounting degree programs.

No mention is made that in state-supported AACSB universities, the cost per 
credit hour may be much lower and the quality more reliable than accounting 
programs linked in For-Profit of the online accounting courses at  http://www.onlineaccountingdegree.org/ 
For example, the accounting programs listed in a search of&quot;accounting programs&quot;does not even list the online accounting degree programs available from AACSB 
accredited universities.

It should also be noted that Texas will not even allow candidates to sit for 
the CPA examination unless they&apos;ve had at least five accounting courses onsite 
such that graduates of fully online programs cannot even sit for the CPA 
examination.

My advice to prospective online accounting students is to first look for 
distance education accounting degree programs in AACSB universities such as 
flagship state university programs such as those the University of Connecticut, 
Wisconsin, Maryland, Massachusetts, etc.

My favorite example of what I consider For-Profit university frauds are the 
For-Profit online accounting doctoral programs listed at http://www.onlineaccountingdegree.org/ 
If you want to embarrass and online accounting doctoral program, ask who will be 
advising the dissertations and look carefully to see if the curriculum is at all 
comparable to an accounting doctoral program at an AACSB accredited university 
---
 http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/Crossborder.htm#CommercialPrograms 
 The fact of the matter is that graduates of these non-AACSB online accounting 
doctoral programs do not face the same academic job market alternatives that are 
available only to AACSB university accounting graduates .

In my judgment there is no respectable online accounting doctoral program in 
North America and probably will not be one until an accounting program in an 
AACSB-accredited university commences to offer an online accounting doctoral 
program. There are respectable online doctoral programs in other disciplines 
such as education, but there are none in accounting.

for the company that chose these winners, OnlineAccountingDegree.com at

 Accounting Doctoral Programs 

May 3, 2011 message to Barry Rice from Bob Jensen
 
Hi Barry,

Faculty without doctoral degrees who meet the AACSB PQ standards are 
 still pretty much second class citizens and will find the tenure track 
 hurdles to eventual full professorship very difficult except in colleges 
 that pay poorly at all levels.

There are a number of alternatives for a CPA/CMA looking into AACSB AQ 
 alternatives in in accounting in North American universities:

The best alternative is to enter into a traditional accounting doctoral 
 program at an AACSB university. Virtually all of these in North America are 
 accountics doctoral programs requiring 4-6 years of full time onsite study 
 and research beyond the masters degree. The good news is that these programs 
 generally have free tuition, room, and board allowances. The bad news is 
 that students who have little interest in becoming mathematicians and 
 statisticians and social scientists need not apply --- http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/Theory01.htm#DoctoralPrograms  

As a second alternative Central Florida University has an onsite doctoral 
 program that is stronger in the accounting and lighter in the accountics. 
 Kennesaw State University has a three-year executive DBA program that has 
 quant-lite alternatives, but this is only available in accounting to older 
 executives who enter with PQ-accounting qualifications. It also costs nearly 
 $100,000 plus room and board even for Georgia residents. The DBA is also not 
 likely to get the graduate into a R1 research university tenure track.

As a third alternative there are now some online accounting doctoral 
 programs that are quant-lite and only take three years, but these diplomas 
 aren&apos;t worth the paper they&apos;re written on --- http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/Crossborder.htm#CommercialPrograms  Cappella University is a very good online university, but its online 
 accounting doctoral program is nothing more than a glorified online MBA 
 degree that has, to my knowledge, no known accounting researchers teaching 
 in the program. Capella will not reveal its doctoral program faculty to 
 prospective students. I don&apos;t think the North American academic job market 
 yet recognizes Capella-type and Nova-type doctorates except in universities 
 that would probably accept the graduates as PQ faculty without a doctorate.

As a fourth alternative there are some of the executive accounting 
 doctoral programs in Europe, especially England, that really don&apos;t count for 
 much in the North American job market.

As a fifth alternative, a student can get a three-year non-accounting PhD 
 degree from a quality doctoral program such as an economics or computer 
 science PhD from any of the 100+ top flagship state/provincial universities 
 in North America. Then if the student also has PQ credentials to teach in an 
 accounting program, the PhD graduate can enroll in an accounting part-time&quot;Bridge Program&quot;anointed by the AACSB --- http://www.aacsb.edu/conferences_seminars/seminars/bp.asp  

As a sixth alternative, a student can get a three-year law degree in 
 addition to getting PQ credentials in some areas where lawyers often get 
 into accounting program tenure tracks. The most common specialty for lawyers 
 is tax accounting. Some accounting departments also teach business law and 
 ethics using lawyers.

Hope this helps.

Case Western has a very respected accounting history track in its PhD

 except at the dissertation stage.

 The Realities of High Corporate Tax Rates in States Like Illinois and the 
Realities of Rotten Governmental Accounting 
The same thing that drives corporations to set up sham corporate headquarters 
off shore (to keep profits out of reach of the IRS) also drives corporations to 
flee states that impose high corporate tax rates (like Illinois, New York, New 
Jersey, and California) to states that took on less unfunded entitlements 
burdens (like Texas and North Carolina). 

&quot;Illinois Tax Firesale: A case study in high corporate rates and 
special favors,&quot; The Wall Street Journal, June 9, 2011 ---
 http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304474804576370102955207570.html#mod=djemEditorialPage_t 
 
 Illinois gained nationwide notoriety in January 
 when Governor Pat Quinn signed into law a 67% hike in the personal income 
 tax rate while lifting the corporate tax rate to 9.5%, the fourth highest in 
 the nation. How is that working out? 

 The good news is that corporate tax receipts in 
 Springfield are up by about $300 million amid the economic recoverythough 
 the state comptroller&apos;s office announced in April that the state still faces 
 $8 billion in unpaid bills. The bad news is that, according to the state&apos;s 
 Department of Commerce, Illinois has already shelled out some $230 million 
 in corporate subsidies to keep more than two dozen companies from fleeing 
 the state. And more are on the way. 

 The ink was barely dry on the new taxes before 
 major employers announced their unhappiness. The equipment giant 
 Caterpillar, the spinal cord of the Peoria economy, says the higher business 
 and personal income taxes will cost the company and its 23,000 Illinois 
 employees $40 million a year.&quot;I want to stay here, but as the leader of 
 this business I have to do what&apos;s right for Caterpillar when making 
 decisions about where to invest,&quot;CEO Doug Oberhelman said in the wake of 
 the tax increase, adding that Illinois&quot;is not favorable to business.&quot; 

 Caterpillar has long built new facilities outside 
 Illinois to avoid the United Auto Workers, most recently in Texas. And after 
 the Quinn tax hike, at least six statesfrom Virginia to zero income tax 
 South Dakotaoffered lower costs if the firm relocated. Caterpillar is 
 staying put for now. 

 When the cellphone business Motorola Mobility 
 hinted this spring that it might leave for San Diego, Mr. Quinn bounced into 
 action.&quot;I know how to work with the big businesses,&quot;he declared to the 
 media, as he rushedtaxpayer checkbook in handto keep the company in the 
 state. Motorola pocketed $100 million in tax incentives last month to stay 
 in Libertyville. 

 Mr. Quinn&apos;s latest quest is to keep Sears in the 
 state. In May, the retailerbased in Hoffman Estates with some 6,000 
 workershinted that it may look for a new home because of expiring tax 
 breaks. The suitors include Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and 
 even New Jersey.&quot;We will sit down with the Sears people,&quot;Mr. Quinn 
 promised.&quot;I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll work something out.&quot; 

 No doubt he will, since in two years in office Mr. 
 Quinn has doled out corporate welfare to at least 80 firms, costing the 
 state nearly $500 million, according to a tally by the Chicago Tribune. Late 
 last year Navistar, the commercial truck engine maker, secured $65 million 
 in handouts. Continental Tire nabbed $19 million. Even deal-of-the-day Web 
 business Groupon, which is preparing an IPO to raise $750 million, grabbed 
 $3.5 million in tax credits to stay in Chicago. U.S. Cellular got a $7.2 
 million package to keep its headquarters in the Chicago area, while Chrysler 
 received an&quot;investment package&quot;worth $62 million for its Belvidere 
 assembly plant .

Some states suffer worse from unfunded long-term entitlements obligations --- 
like Illinois and California made promises they may not be able to keep for 
retired state worker and teacher pension and medical plans relative to North 
Carolina that has much more conservative fiscal management.

Some state governments have made entitlements promises that they may just not 
be able to keep. Governmental accounting has been a game of shadows and mirrors 
and wonderland dreams.

Voters are just beginning to realize how the accounting profession aided and 
abetted the deceits of lousy fiscal management in local, state, and national 
government

&quot; Escape From Illinois, Cont:. Now the Chicago Merc wants relief ,&quot; The Wall Street Journal , June 15, 2011 ---
 http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303848104576383872937102498.html#mod=djemEditorialPage_t 
 
 The line of businesses looking for tax relief in 
 Illinois keeps growing, with the latest plea coming from the owner of the 
 iconic Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade. CME Group 
 Executive Chairman Terrence Duffy told a shareholders meeting last week that 
 Illinois Governor Pat Quinn&apos;s 30% hike in the corporate tax rate enacted in 
 January will cost the company $50 million this year.&quot;We don&apos;t want to leave 
 Chicago,&quot;Mr. Duffy said, but&quot;we have to do what&apos;s right for our 
 shareholders.&quot;A spokesman confirmed that the company is exploring all 
 options to save money. 

 We reported last week that dozens of major Illinois 
 firmsfrom Caterpillar to Motorola to Searsare in open rebellion in the 
 wake of Springfield&apos;s $6 billion revenue grab and new 9.5% corporate rate, 
 fourth highest in the U.S. Mr. Quinn has already carved out some $230 
 million in special tax breaks this year to save companies from his own tax 
 policies and keep these firms from fleeing. 

 Our guess is that Mr. Duffy&apos;s statement is also an 
 attempt to bargain for better tax treatment, and it&apos;s hard to blame him. The 
 Chicago Tribune reports that CME pays 8.9% of its income in state tax, while 
 most businesses pay well below 7% and many pay no tax at all thanks to rich 
 deductions. Mr. Quinn says he&apos;s having an&quot;ongoing conversation&quot;with CME, 
 and we&apos;ll bet a February pork belly contract that he&apos;ll deliver the bacon.

the room looking exactly like they did when they first walked in (maybe a little 
sleepier). I think this is one of the reasons that teachers sometimes become 
mediocre. The results seem the same regardless of their efforts. They dont get 
the positive reinforcement for their work that comes from seeing a tangible 
output. In fact, Ill go so far as to say that I believe this has had negative

From Deloitte&apos;s IAS Plus on June 3, 2011 --- http://www.iasplus.com/index.htm 
 3 June 2011: IFRS Foundation publishes proposed IFRS Taxonomy 
 &apos;common-practice&apos; enhancements 
 
 
 The IFRS Foundation has published 
 for public comment an exposure draft of the IFRS Taxonomy 2011 
 interim release: common-practice concepts . 

 The proposed interim release 
 contains supplementary tags for the IFRS Taxonomy that reflect 
 disclosures that are commonly reported by entities in their IFRS 
 financial statements. The supplementary tags are intended to enhance 
 the comparability of financial information, and are consistent with 
 IFRSs and with the XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting 
 Language) architecture of the IFRS Taxonomy 2011. 

 The supplementary tags result 
 from the IFRS Foundation previously announced i ntention to extend 
 the IFRS Taxonomy. This was partially a response to United 
 Statements Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) concerns about the suitability of the existing 
 IFRS Taxonomy 2011 for US filing purposes, together and the outcomes 
 of an pilot XBRL study . The SEC has issued a &apos;no action&apos; letter in which it states 
 foreign private issuers that prepare their financial statements in 
 accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB are not required to 
 submit XBRL information to the SEC until it endorses an IFRS 
 Taxonomy it considers suitable. 

 The proposals are open for 
 comment until 2 August 2011.

&quot; Third Phase of XBRL Implementation Takes Effect June 15 ,&quot; Journal 
of Accountancy , June 7, 2011 ---
 http://www.journalofaccountancy.com/Web/20114207.htm 
 
 The third 
 phase of the SECs XBRL implementation program takes effect June 15, with 
 nearly all public companies using U.S. GAAP now required to submit data in 
 the fully searchable, digital format. 

   

 Over the 
 past two years, the largest SEC reporting companies have begun submitting 
 financial information in XBRL. The first phase, which took effect in 2009, 
 required companies with a worldwide public equity float of $5 billion to 
 file in XBRL; the second phase, for the next-largest tier of public 
 companies, took effect in 2010. 

   

 XBRL allows 
 computers to read financial information and use it in analytical tools, much 
 like barcodes applied to merchandise are used for computerized inventory 
 controls. In order to create an XBRL submission, filers must select tags 
 from the U.S. GAAP taxonomy that best represent their financial reporting 
 concepts. 

   

 The 
 selected tags are then attached to the filers financial information by 
 software programs or third-party service providers to complete the XBRL 
 submission. XBRL helps to provide investors access to financial information 
 in a form thats ready for analysis and can help companies automate checks 
 on the data quality in their reports. In addition, XBRL has helped companies 
 enhance and streamline their reporting process. More and more companies are 
 realizing this benefit and, as a result, there is demand to adopt XBRL 
 across other reporting streams. Two bills currently are pending in the U.S. 
 Congress S. 904 and H.R. 1745, the Jobs, Opportunity, Benefits and 
 Services Act of 2011 that designate data reporting standards such as XBRL 
 be used for the reporting of certain information under the Social Security 
 Act. 

   

 In a 
 companys first year of XBRL compliance, each amount in the primary 
 financial statements is tagged in XBRL, and each note to the financial 
 statements and certain financial schedules is individually tagged as a block 
 of text. In the second year of compliance, more detailed information is 
 required, including: each accounting policy, each table and each amount in 
 the notes and financial schedules also must be tagged separately in XBRL. 

   

 The only 
 companies the XBRL rules do not apply to are investment companies registered 
 under the Investment Company Act, business development companies and other 
 entities that report under the Exchange Act and prepare their financial 
 statements in accordance with Article 6 of Regulation S-X, according to the 
 SEC. In addition, since the SEC has not yet approved the taxonomy for 
 foreign private issuers that report under IFRS, these companies will not be 
 required to submit XBRL exhibits. 

   

 For new 
 XBRL filers, the rules include two permissible grace periods: a 30-day grace 
 period for a companys initial, basic tagged submission and, in the 
 following year, a 30-day grace period for a companys initial, more detailed 
 tagged submission. The rules also include modified liability provisions for 
 the first two years a company is required to provide XBRL submissions. The 
 modified liability provisions are eliminated on Oct. 31, 2014. 

   

 For more 
 information on XBRL filing, see the final 
 rule on the SECs website, visit xbrl.org/us or see the EDGAR 
 Filer Manual .

 A Pair of Grumpy Old Accountants Ask a Question About Accounting Leadership Where Are the Accounting Profession&apos;s Leaders? By: Anthony H. Catanach Jr. and J. Edward Ketz SmartPros , May 2011 http://accounting.smartpros.com/x71917.xml These are the concluding remarks by Tony and Ed: 
 Tom Selling has gone so far 
 as to suggest that part of the audit model problem might be that: 
 
 auditors might be 
 good at verification of things which are capable of being verified, and 
 very little else. 
 
 If Tom is right, then we may 
 be closer to the edge of the fall than we realized, and too late for even 
 credible leadership to help. 
 
 Jensen Comment
I still don&apos;t see why financial statements cannot have multiple columns with the 
first column devoted to measurement that auditors can verify such as amortized 
historical costs. Then we can add more columns as verification drifts off into 
the foggy ether of fair value accounting and changes in earnings that may or may 
not ever be realized (e.g., not ever for held-to-maturity assets and liabilities 
that will not be liquidated until maturity). 

 As to leadership, don&apos;t look to our academy for 
leaders in the profession. Academe was overtaken decades by accountics faculty 
who really do not make many if any significant contributions to practitioner 
journals, the AICPA, the IMA, and other professional bodies except in certain 
specialized subtopics like AIS, history, and tax ---

 Accounting Scholarship that 
Advances Professional Knowledge and Practice

The Accounting Review doi:10.2308/accr.00000031 Accepted Manuscript posted 
online October 2010
 Abstract   Full Text: [ PDF  (152 kB) ] 
 
 Recent accounting scholarship has used statistical analysis on asset prices, 
 financial reports and disclosures, laboratory experiments, and surveys of 
 practice. The research has studied the interface among accounting 
 information, capital markets, standard setters, and financial analysts and 
 how managers make accounting choices. But as accounting scholars have 
 focused on understanding how markets and users process accounting data, they 
 have distanced themselves from the accounting process itself. Accounting 
 scholarship has failed to address important measurement and valuation issues 
 that have arisen in the past 40 years of practice. This gap is illustrated 
 with missed opportunities in risk measurement and management and the 
 estimation of the fair value of complex financial securities. This 
 commentary encourages accounting scholars to devote more resources to 
 obtaining a fundamental understanding of contemporary and future practice 
 and how analytic tools and contemporary advances in accounting and related 
 disciplines can be deployed to improve the professional practice of 
 accounting. 2010 AAA 
 
 Although all three speakers provided inspirational presentations, Steve Zeff and 
I both concluded that Bob Kaplans presentation was possibly the best that we 
had ever viewed among all past AAA plenary sessions. And weve seen a lot of 
plenary sessions in our long professional careers. 

 Now that Kaplans

overstress the importance that accounting educators and researchers watch the

&quot; Accounting Giant KPMG LLP Faces $350 Million Gender Discrimination Class 
Action ,&quot; PR Newswire , June 2, 2011 ---
 http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/accounting-giant-kpmg-llp-faces-350-million-gender-discrimination-class-action-123021028.html 
 
 Although KPMG LLP one of the&quot;Big Four&quot;accounting firms publicly touts its commitment to diversity and equal 
 opportunity, the numbers tell a different story entirely. Women comprise 
 about half of KPMG&apos;s employees, but are conspicuously absent from the top 
 leadership positions. The Company&apos;s 20-member global executive team and 
 24-member global board each have only one female representative. Similarly, 
 women are only 18% of all KPMG Partners compared to nearly 50% of all 
 employees. 

 Aiming to put an end to the systemic gender 
 discrimination at KPMG, a former female Senior Manager filed a $350 million 
 class action discrimination lawsuit against the company today in the U.S. 
 District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Plaintiff, Donna 
 Kassman, lives in New York and worked in KPMG&apos;s New York office for 
 seventeen years before resigning as a result of gender discrimination. 
 Plaintiff Kassman and the class are represented by Janette Wipper, Siham 
 Nurhussein, and Deepika Bains of Sanford Wittels&amp;Heisler, LLP. 

 KPMG is an audit, tax, and advisory services firm 
 headquartered in Netherlands with U.S. offices headquartered in New York 
 City. In 2010, KPMG reported global revenues of $20.63 billion. 

 Plaintiff Kassman alleges that KPMG engages in 
 systemic discrimination against its female Managers, including but not 
 limited to Managers, Senior Managers and Managing Directors. The lawsuit is 
 intended to change KPMG&apos;s discriminatory pay and promotion policies and 
 practices, as well as its systemic failure to properly investigate and 
 resolve complaints of discrimination and harassment. The Plaintiff is filing 
 this action on behalf of a class of thousands of current and former female 
 employees who have worked as Managers at KPMG from 2008 through the date of 
 judgment. 

 KPMG promotes fewer women to Partner (18%) than the 
 industry average (23%) and fewer women to Senior Manager (35%) than the 
 industry average (44%).&quot;Across the accounting industry, women are 
 conspicuously absent from leadership positions; but at KPMG, women fare even 
 worse,&quot;said Janette Wipper.&quot;As soon as women come within reach of 
 partnership, the Company&apos;s male-dominated owners find ways to block their 
 advancement,&quot; 

 Despite Plaintiff Kassman&apos;s long tenure and stellar 
 performance, KPMG refused to promote her along the partnership track. Ms. 
 Kassman&apos;s supervisors repeatedly told her throughout 2008 and 2009 that she 
 was next in line for a promotion to Managing Director. Around the time Ms. 
 Kassman was to be promoted, however, two male employees complained that she 
 was&quot;unapproachable&quot;and&quot;too direct,&quot;thinly-veiled gender-based criticisms 
 designed to derail her career advancement. Based on these unfounded, 
 discriminatory comments, KPMG removed Ms. Kassman from the promotion track, 
 subjected her to numerous hostile interrogations, and advised her to meet 
 with a&quot;coach&quot;to work on her supposed issues. Instead of disciplining the 
 two male employees for their campaign of harassment, KPMG rewarded them by 
 putting them up for promotion. 

 KPMG&apos;s female Managers are not only under-promoted, 
 but underpaid as well. In one particularly egregious act of discrimination, 
 KPMG slashed Ms. Kassman&apos;s base salary by $20,000 while she was on maternity 
 leave because she was paid&quot;too much.&quot;KPMG cited no business justification 
 for slashing her salary. When Ms. Kassman complained about the salary cut, 
 her male supervisor asserted that she did not need the money because she&quot;ha[d] 
 a nice engagement ring.&quot; 

 &quot;Unfortunately, Ms. Kassman&apos;s story is completely 
 representative of the treatment of women at KPMG,&quot;Siham Nurhussein said.&quot;Ms. Kassman repeatedly complained up the chain of command about the gender 
 discrimination and harassment she was experiencing, and the Company reacted 
 with neither surprise nor concern. Her supervising Partner told her 
 matter-of-factly that her male colleague might have a problem working with 
 women, and the Office of Ethics and Compliance told Ms. Kassman that men had 
 ganged up on women at KPMG before. KPMG not only tolerates gender 
 discrimination, but displays an active interest in perpetuating it.&quot;

 Bob, 

 I dont want to be too philosophical here, but your 
 story below is about males behaving badly and you frequently send out emails 
 about auditors behaving badly. Couldnt someone ask where did the 
 teachers/professors fail? You and I and many other professors on this list 
 have been teaching for a long timeso these bad people were very likely 
 our students. How come we didnt put them on the correct ethical path? Or 
 weed the bad apples out?

 June 6, 2011 reply from Bob Jensen 
 
Hi Glen,

You ask the question that&apos;s been asked and&quot;answered&quot;over and over for 
 the past few decades. I personally think that there&apos;s only a limited benefit 
 that comes from increased focus on ethics in accounting curricula, although 
 I certainly don&apos;t think it&apos;s topic that should be neglected in any 
 accounting, auditing, systems, or tax course. Ethical behavior or lack 
 thereof is far too complex to expect educators to solve the problem any more 
 than we can expect preachers to eradicate sin in their congregations.

I was forever impressed with a presentation years ago by long-serving 
 audit senior executive and later accounting professor Bob Sack, a 
 professional that I truly admire with extensive and varied service to the 
 American Accounting Association.

Bob contends that perhaps the major solution to the problem is the&quot;tone 
 at the top&quot;as set by both the example and the policies set by by executives 
 at the very top of the organization. However, I think the alleged behavior 
 of this latest huge lawsuit against KPMG illustrates that the tone at the 
 top is certainly important but not enough. Most certainly alleged bad 
 behavior within KPMG runs totally counter to the tone at the top of KPMG and 
 all other large auditing firms and most smaller auditing firms.

Of course we must note the American legal tradition of not being guilty 
 until confessions transpire or being declared guilty in a court of law. 
 There are perhaps some sides of this particular lawsuit that have not yet 
 been disclosed in the media.

There are a growing number of interesting references to gender and ethics 
 course materials and literature cited at the AAA Commons. I really recommend 
 accounting teachers and researchers to use these categories in the Commons.

Of course there is still evidence of glass ceilings in auditing firms, 
 but experts (not me) on gender and minority issues admit that the issues are 
 far more complex than despicable bias.

I certainly invite more messaging on the AECM from experts on these 
 issues as long as we keep in mind that the dust has not really settled on 
 this particular KPMG lawsuit.

Everybody is also waiting breathlessly for the U.S. Supreme Court ruling 
 on Wal-Mart. Is this a genuine grievance or a legal lottery or both? It&apos;s 
 the&quot;both&quot;part that disturbs me the most when and if the punitive damages 
 are more of a jackpot for the lawyers than the plaintiffs.

Respectfully,
Bob Jensen

 PCAOB Snags KPMG Yet Another Time (this time for a client named Motorola 
with dubious revenue recognition to meet an earnings target) 

 The oversight board said a significant portion of 
the companys earnings for the 2006 third quarter came from two licensing 
agreements that were recorded during the last three days of the quarter. One was 
the Qualcomm deal that wasnt signed until the fourth quarter. The board also 
cited other deficiencies in KPMGs review of Motorolas accounting for the 
transactions. 
&quot;Dirty Secrets Fester in 50-Year Relationships,&quot;byJonathan Weil, Bloomberg 
News , June 9, 2011 ---
 http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-09/dirty-secrets-fester-in-50-year-relationships-jonathan-weil.html 
 
 Another financial scandal. Another cover-up by 
 regulators. Four years ago, inspectors for the auditing industry&apos;s chief 
 watchdog discovered that KPMG LLP had let Motorola Inc. record revenue 
 during the third quarter of 2006 from a transaction with Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) , even though the final 
 contract wasnt signed until the early hours of the fourth quarter. Thats 
 no small technicality. Without the deal, Motorola would have missed its 
 third-quarter earnings target. 

 The regulator, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board , later 
 criticized KPMG for letting Motorola book the revenue when it did. Although 
 KPMG had discussed the transactions timing with both Motorola and Qualcomm, 
 the board said the firm failed to obtain persuasive evidence of an 
 arrangement for revenue-recognition purposes in the third quarter. In other 
 words, KPMG had no good reason to believe the deal shouldnt have been 
 recorded in the fourth quarter. 

 The oversight board didnt tell the public that 
 this happened at Motorola, though. The maker of wireless- communications 
 equipment, now known as Motorola Solutions Inc., didnt restate its earnings 
 for the period in question. And theres no sign the Securities and Exchange 
 Commission ever followed up with an investigation of Motorolas accounting, 
 even though it oversees the board and had access to its findings. 

 All of this is business as usual for Americas 
 numbers cops. Since the boards creation by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002, its inspectors have 
 found audit failures by large accounting firms at hundreds of U.S.-listed 
 companies. Yet its policy is to keep the identities of those clients secret. 

 Issuer C 

 Likewise, in August 2008 when the board released 
 its annual inspection report on KPMG, it referred to Motorola as Issuer 
 C in the section on the auditors work for the company. For what its 
 worth, Motorola paid the firm $244.2 million from 2000 to 2010. 

 This is the third column Ive written revealing the 
 name of a client whose accounting practices were a subject of a major 
 auditing firms inspection report. Motorola is the biggest yet. I hope a 
 whistleblower comes forward someday to leak many more. This is information 
 investors need to know. 

 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act authorizes the oversight board to disclose such confidential and 
 proprietary information as the board may determine to be appropriate in the 
 public portions of its inspection reports. So its the boards call whether 
 to disclose clients names, although the SEC could overrule it. The board 
 never does, bowing to the wishes of the accounting firms. 

 Identity Revealed 

 Motorolas identity was disclosed in public records 
 last month as part of a class-action shareholder lawsuit against the company 
 in a federal district court in Chicago . The 
 plaintiffs in the case, led by the Macomb County Employees Retirement 
 System in Michigan , filed a transcript of a September 2010 
 deposition of a KPMG auditor, David Pratt, who testified that Issuer C was 
 Motorola. KPMG isnt a defendant in the lawsuit. 

 Pratt also identified the Motorola customers cited 
 in the boards inspection report. Its his deposition that allows me to 
 describe the reports findings using real names. 

 The oversight board said a significant portion of 
 the companys earnings for the 2006 third quarter came from two licensing 
 agreements that were recorded during the last three days of the quarter. One 
 was the Qualcomm deal that wasnt signed until the fourth quarter. The board 
 also cited other deficiencies in KPMGs review of Motorolas accounting for 
 the transactions. 

 Making the Numbers 

 Motorola booked $275 million of earnings during the 
 2006 third quarter as a result of the Qualcomm deal, according to estimates 
 by the plaintiffs in the shareholder suit. The plaintiffs allege that all of 
 it was recorded in violation of generally accepted accounting principles. 
 Thats 28 percent of the net income Motorola reported for the quarter. 

 A Motorola spokesman, Nicholas Sweers, said the 
 companys accounting complied with GAAP, and that the financial statements 
 for the periods covered in the inspection report have never been the subject 
 of an SEC investigation. He declined to discuss details of Motorolas 
 accounting, citing the litigation. A KPMG spokesman, George Ledwith, 
 declined to comment. So did an oversight board spokeswoman, Colleen Brennan, 
 and an SEC spokesman, John Nester .

 The story doesnt end there. Last week the boards 
 new chairman, James Doty, gave a speech in which he said the board should consider 
 setting mandatory term limits for 
 auditors at public companies. To prove his point, he cited two instances 
 that were galling in their simplicity where auditors have failed to 
 exercise the required skepticism and have accepted evidence that is less 
 than persuasive. 

 Making a Match 

 One of his examples matched the fact pattern of 
 KPMGs 2006 review at Motorola exactly. PCAOB inspectors found at one large 
 firm that an engagement team was aware that a significant contract was not 
 signed until the early hours of the fourth quarter, Doty said. 
 Nevertheless, the audit partner allowed the company to book the transaction 
 in the third quarter, which allowed the company to meet its earnings 
 target.

&quot; KPMG UK Report Shows Libyas Qaddafi Held Billions in US and UK Banks ,&quot;by Lisa Chapman, Big Four Blog , May 28, 2011 ---
 http://www.big4.com/blog/kpmg-uk-report-shows-libya%E2%80%99s-qaddafi-held-billions-in-us-and-uk-banks-76 
 
 In the Big Four world, truth sometimes appears to 
 be stranger than fiction. A tale of how the Big Four firm KPMG is involved 
 in a global financial intrigue is revealed by globalwitness.org which has 
 obtained papers which were prepared by KPMG UK on Libyan leader Col. Muammar 
 el-Qaddafis ill-gotten and stashed wealth. 

 First, globalwitness.org has obtained a leaked full investment profile of Libyan 
 Investment Authority for the period ending June 30, 2010. http://www.globalwitness.org/sites/default/files/LIA.pdf 

 This report appears to be prepared by KPMG UK. 

 The New York Times notes, The document, 
 independently verified as authentic by The New York Times, is a summary of 
 the Libyan Investment Authoritys investments, created for the fund by the 
 London office of the KPMG consulting firm and dated June 30, 2010. 

 And it is clear from this document that Qaddafi 
 stashed $53 billion of Libyan oil revenues, with some big amounts with HSBC, 
 Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, HSBC Holdings and Socit Gnrale. Goldman Sachs 
 held $43 million in 3 accounts and HSBC held $292.69 million in 10 accounts. 
 LIA also invested $1 billion in structured financial products through 
 Socit Gnrale and JPMorgan Chase; and in Central Bank of Libya, the Arab 
 Banking Corporation and the British Arab Commercial Bank. The fund held 
 large investments in top multinationals such as General Electric, 
 Halliburton, Schlumberger, Caterpillar, BP and Nokia, and United States 
 government bonds. 

 While this amount is mind boggling, it was not 
 immune from market downtrends, the report notes that total market value of 
 the funds investments fell 4.53% from $55.9 billion in March 2010 to $53.3 
 billion in June 2010. 

 The investments appear to have been legal at the 
 time, although the United Nations, the European Union and the United States 
 in February imposed targeted financial sanctions against the assets of 
 Colonel Qaddafi and his family. The United States also froze the assets of 
 Libyan government-owned and controlled entities. 

 Global Witness, which issued a statement on its 
 website, said, However the Libyan people could not know where it was 
 invested or how much it was, because banks have no obligation to disclose 
 state assets they hold. Global Witness asked both banks to confirm that they 
 held funds for the state-owned Libyan Investment Authority, and whether they 
 still hold them. They both refused, with HSBC citing client confidentiality. 
 Numerous other banks and financial firms are listed including Societe 
 Generale, UniCredit and the Arab Banking Corporation. 

 Global Witness then pummels the banks.It is 
 completely absurd that banks like HSBC and Goldman Sachs can hide behind 
 customer confidentiality in a case like this. These are state accounts, so 
 the customer is effectively the Libyan people and these banks are 
 withholding vital information from them, said Charmian Gooch, director of 
 Global Witness. 

 KPMG does not appear to be involved in any 
 malfeasance or accused of any misdemeanor, as far as these public reports 
 go, though it appears to have been the author of this leaked investment 
 portfolio report. 

 How KPMG will be specifically affected by any 
 fallout will be interesting to see .

 Experiential Learning in Tax Courses 
&quot;Towards a Better 
Tax Law Student (and Professor),&quot;posted by Chris Brummer, The Conglomerate , 
May 31, 2011 ---
 http://www.theconglomerate.org/2011/05/towards-a-better-tax-law-student-and-professor.html 
 
Heather Fields delightful essay, Experiential Learning 
in a Lecture Class: Exposing Students to the Skill of Giving Useful Tax Advice, 
kicked off our corporate law camp with a welcome examination of how to improve 
courses such that students can translate theory into practice, and in doing so 
emerge from courses as not only better educated, but also better lawyers. 

This is, of course, a dilemma facing not only tax 
lawyers, but corporate professors as well, especially as we seek to improve our 
students prospects on what is at times a challenging legal market. Professor Field focuses in the article on modules that can be incorporated into 
lecture courses in order to help students begin to see how they can turn their 
growing substantive knowledge into what she calls useful tax advice. Specifically, she seeks to generate new forms of experiential learning whereby 
students can begin to provide, while in school, understandable advice that 
comprehensively addresses the clients economic objectives (including, but not 
limited to the clients tax objectives) and that gives the client a clear 
appreciation of the benefits and risks of a tax-related business decision.  Ultimately, her approach involves weaving key documents and real-world 
quandaries into classroom sessions through experiential problem sets and 
negotiationssomething unfortunately rare in the profession (how many times do 
contracts students actually see a contract?). In doing so, she develops a 
cutting edge pedagogical approach to tax law that keeps an eye on substance and 
theory, with another on real world (and realistic) legal training. 

Professor Field thus not presents a vision as to what 
law students should be learning (and how they should learn it), but also what 
the role of the law professor should be in a world of increasing market 
pressures.  Curricular change, as many professors can attest, can be difficult 
to achieve in a world of procedural roadblocks and faculty voting requirements. What I found refreshing is that the paper offers a blueprint as to what 
specifically professors can do individually to deliver value for students, 
regardless of the institutional sclerosis that may hamper larger school reforms.
 
 

Jensen Comment
One of the most difficult elements in experiential courses 
is evaluation of learning and assignment of grades. If testing and grading is 
standardized across multiple students in multiple learning circumstances, 
students tend to focus on what it takes for a grade rather than learning unique 
to experiential learning. If grading is adapted to each experiential learner 
there are limited benchmarks for grading and grades tend to become quite lenient 
for students who really put in genuine effort. Some of the most popular 
experiential learning courses are internships where students work for employers 
and then are graded by their college professors who coordinate the internships 
and evaluate the assigned internship course projects. Instructors should monitor 
employers to make sure that students are assigned to meaningful projects and are 
not just&quot;gophers&quot;doing mostly mundane tasks.

One of the most interesting experiential international accounting course was 
implemented on a trial basis in the late 1990s by Sharon Lightener at San Diego 
State University ---

This is an interesting Website for various things, 
including consumer frauds:
 reviewandjudge --- http://reviewandjudge.org/HOME.htm 

I don&apos;t know just why, but this site also has a link to having any Website 
you choose evaluated for age, popularity, and a Google love rating. For example, 
I keyed in my home page at
 http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/ 
Note that for some reason you have to 
delete the http:// part of the above URL to get this to work. Thus to make it 
work I key in only www.trinity.edu/rjensen 
I got 5.0/5.0 stars for age of the Webpage 
(I&apos;ve been maintaining this page for over 15 years), 3.5/5.0 stars for 
popularity, and 3.5/5.0 stars for a Google love rating.

In order to put it to a comparison test, I know that sociology professor Mike 
Kearl has one of the most popular academic Websites served up by Trinity 
University. When I keyed in
 www.trinity.edu/mkearl 
the results were 5.0/5.0 stars for age 
of Mike&apos;s Webpage, 3.5/5.0 stars for popularity, and 3.5/5.0 stars for a Google 
love rating.

Either Mike and I are running neck and neck or there&apos;s something suspicious 
going on here. So I read in Jim Mahar&apos;s popular finance professor blog (after 
removing http://) at
 financeprofessorblog.blogspot.com/ 
He is doing much worse than Mike and 
me, although I think he has, in my viewpoint, one of the best finance blogs on 
the academic Web.

Next I read in the very popular blog maintained by economics Nobel laureate 
Gary Becker and famous law professor Richard Posner (after removing http://) at
 uchicagolaw.typepad.com/beckerposner/ 
Becker and Posner also fared worse 
than Mike and me except that they did get a 3.5/5.0 Google love rating.

Next I typed in Lady Gaga&apos;s home page (after removing http://) at
 www.ladygaga.com/bornthisway/ 
the results were  4.0/5.0 stars for popularity, and 3.5/5.0 stars 
for a Google love rating.
Yikes! Mike and I are doing almost as well with our 
dull academic sites as the site that links to many photos and videos of Lady 
Gaga in her underwear.

Next I read in the ABC News home page (after removing http://) at
 http://abcnews.go.com/ 
the results were 5.0/5.0 stars for age of the ABC News page, 5.0/5.0 
stars for popularity, and 4.0/5.0 stars for a Google rating.
Guess Mike and I 
aren&apos;t as popular as ABC News, but we&apos;re close, and this makes me slightly 
suspicious.

Next I read in the Stanford University home page at
 www.Stanford.edu 
the results were 5.0/5.0 stars for age of Stanford&apos;s home page, 4.5/5.0 stars for 
popularity, and 4.5/5.0 stars for a Google rating.

Next I read in the Harvard University home page at
 www.Harvard.edu 
the results were 5.0/5.0 stars for age of Harvard&apos;s home page, 4.5/5.0 stars for 
popularity, and 4.0/5.0 stars for a Google rating.
The bottom line is that 
Google loves Harvard a little less than Stanford, but Google&apos;s love for Harvard 
and Lady Gaga are identical.

One thing about which I&apos;m certain --- this Web site rating site does is not 
based upon number of hits. In no way do Mike and I get hit as often as Lady 
Gaga, Stanford University, and Harvard University.

 
 
&quot; Controversial Journal Rankings in Australia Affect Research Funds and 
Careers ,&quot;by Jennifer Howard, Chronicle of Higher Education , May 8, 
2011 ---
 http://chronicle.com/article/Controversial-Journal-Rankings/127417/ 
 
 When Anna Poletti found out she&apos;d had an article 
 accepted by the journal Biography: An Interdisciplinary Quarterly, the young Australian scholar of life writingautobiography, biography, 
 letters, and other forms of recorded experiencewas thrilled.&quot;It got me a 
 whole lot of attention in the field,&quot;she says, because Biography is highly regarded by her peers. 

 It is not so esteemed, however, by the Australian 
 government. A new journal-ranking planwhich helps the government determine 
 how research money is doled out to universitieshas dropped Biography from the highest ranking, A*, to a lowly C. Judged that way, an association 
 with Biography looked like more of a career killer than a coup. 

 &quot;I am actually dragging down the overall score of 
 my unit by publishing in a C journal,&quot;says Ms. Poletti, a lecturer in 
 English at Monash Universityher first tenure-track job. 

 The ranking is part of an overall evaluation system 
 devised by the Australian Research Council, an agency that finances 
 scholarship and innovation in the country through grants and through advice 
 to other government departments. At stake is a share of about $1.63-billion 
 (U.S.), which supports a multitude of activities including academic 
 research, says Margaret M. Sheil, chief executive officer of the council. 
 The system, called Excellence in Research for Australia, helps the 
 government decide how much goes to a given research unit at a university. 

 Journal rankings are not just an Australian 
 phenomenon. Scholars worldwide are tangling with what Ms. Poletti calls&quot;the 
 culture of audit.&quot;The United States does not have such a ranking system, 
 but U.S.-based researchers and journal editors find their work drawn into 
 such assessments anyway. 

 Biography, for instance, comes out of the 
 University of Hawaii&apos;s Center for Biographical Research. Around the worldin 
 Britain, South Africa, New Zealand, and elsewherecash-strapped governments 
 are experimenting with schemes to measure the quality of the academic 
 research they pay to support. 

 In Europe, the European Science Foundation is about 
 to release a new round of journal rankings as part of its 
 European Reference Index for the Humanities. Ms. Sheil, who talks regularly 
 with assessors in other countries, has recently traveled to the United 
 States to discuss Australia&apos;s evaluation system.

Do to the reaction of professors in Australia, this 
 initiative to rank journals was later abandoned.
 
 Journal Ranking Site: Eigenfactor 
 
 Eigenfactor ranks journals much as Google ranks websites. 
 It is somewhat similar to Thomson Scientific&apos;s (ISI) Journal Citation Index 
 (JCI), though it&apos;s dataset is larger. 

 Some points to note:
* JCI only looks at the 8000 or so journals indexed by Thomson Scientific 
 while potentially any journal could be included in Eigenfactor.
* The JCI is calculated based on the most recent 2-year&apos;s worth of citation 
 data; Eigenfactor is based on the most recent 5 years. 
* In collaboration with journalprices.com , Eigenfactor 
 provides information about price and value for thousands of scholarly 
 periodicals.
* Article Influence (AI): a measure of a journal&apos;s prestige based on per 
 article citations and comparable to Impact Factor. Eigenfactor (EF): A 
 measure of the overall value provided by all of the articles published in a 
 given journal in a year.
* The Eigenfactor Web site also presents the ISI Impact Factors, so it&apos;s 
 possible to compare the
ISI&apos;s&quot;Impact Factors&quot;with Eigenfactor&apos;s&quot;Article Influence&quot;
* Both simple and advanced searching is available:&quot;You can search by 
 partial or full journal name, ISSN number, or you can view a selected ISI 
 category, only ISI-listed journals, only non-ISI-listed journals or both 
 listed and unlisted.&quot;
* Eigenfactor is Free! 
 
 From the Eigenfactor 
Web site: 
 Eigenfactor provides 
 influence rankings for 7000+ science and social science journals and 
 rankings for an additional 110,000+ reference items including newspapers, 
 and popular magazines. 
 Borrowing 
 methods from network theory, eigenfactor.org ranks the 
 influence of journals much as Google&apos;s PageRank algorithm ranks the 
 influence of web pages. By this approach, journals are considered to be 
 influential if they are cited often by other influential journals. Iterative 
 ranking schemes of this type, known as eigenvector centrality methods, are 
 notoriously sensitive to&quot;dangling nodes&quot;and&quot;dangling clusters&quot;-- nodes 
 or groups of nodes which link seldom if at all to other parts of the 
 network. Eigenfactor modifies the basic eigenvector centrality algorithm to 
 overcome these problems and to better handle certain peculiarities of 
 journal citation data. 

 Different 
 disciplines have different standards for citation and different time scales 
 on which citations occur. The average article in a leading cell biology 
 journal might receive 10-30 citations within two years; the average article 
 in leading mathematics journal would do very well to receive 2 citations 
 over the same period. By using the whole citation network, Eigenfactor 
 automatically accounts for these differences and allows better comparison 
 across research areas. 

 Eigenfactor.org is 
 a non-commercial academic research project sponsored by the Bergstrom lab in 
 the Department of Biology at the University of Washington. We aim to develop 
 novel methods for evaluating the influence of scholarly periodicals and for 
 mapping the structure of academic research. We are committed to sharing our 
 findings with interested members of the public, including librarians, 
 journal editors, publishers, and authors of scholarly articles. 

 The Eigenfactor Web site --- http://www.eigenfactor.org   
 
In my opinion citation indices are quite unreliable since for-profit journal 
publishing houses often urge paid editors and referees to push for citations to 
journals they publish. Hence, the bibliography of many research papers becomes 
somewhat artificial.

 For academic accounting research journals see the following (slow 
loading):
 http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/theory01.htm#JournalRankings 

At the AAA annual meeting in San Francisco in August, 2005, Judy Rayburn 
addressed the low citation rate of accounting research when compared to citation 
rates for research in other fields. Rayburn concluded that the low citation rate 
for accounting research was due to a lack of diversity in topics and research 
methods:

 Accounting research is different from other business disciplines 
in the area of citations: Top-tier accounting journals in total have fewer 
citations than top-tier journals in finance, management, and marketing. Our 
journals are not widely cited outside our discipline. Our top-tier journals as a 
group project too narrow a view of the breadth and diversity of (what should 
count as) accounting research .
Rayburn [2006, p. 4]
As quoted at http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/395wpTAR/Web/TAR395wp.htm 
Her data was derived from a Texas !&amp;M study headed up by Ed Swanson. 

Journal rankings greatly affect tenure and promotion decisions and annual 
performance evaluations in virtually all top North American universities. Many 
universities, however, have customized rankings developed by their own faculty 
members. For example, the University of Texas at Dallas has a very unique 
ranking system in its college of business that results in its program ranking in 
the top 10 in the nation with respect to research (I&apos;m not certain if UT Dallas 
still publishes this controversial ranking system that, in my viewpoint, cherry 
picked the journals to receive highest priority).

For a specialized finance journal ranking system see

 More on Where Accountics Research Went Wrong 

June 10, 2010 reply from Richard Sansing
 
 Dan, 

 I&apos;m confident that you can answer the question you 
 posed, but since you asked me I will answer. 

 The TAR article by Fellingham and Newman,&quot;Strategic considerations in auditing&quot;, The Accounting Review 60 (October): 
 634-50, is certainly a compression of the the audit process. I find it 
 insightful because it highlights the difference in alpha and beta risks when 
 auditors and clients are thought of as self-interested, maximizing agents. 

 Richard Sansing 
 
June 11, 2011 reply from Bob Jensen
 
Hi Richard,

Has there ever been an audit that measured Type II (Beta) error?? Do you 
 have some great examples where Type II error is actually measured (or 
 specified) in TAR, JAR, or JAE articles?

There are only a few, very few, books that I keep beside my computer work 
 station inside the cottage. Most of my books are on shelves in my outside 
 studio that&apos;s now more of a library than an office. One of my prized 
 textbooks that I always keep close at hand is an old statistics textbook. I 
 keep it beside me because it&apos;s the best book I&apos;ve ever studied regarding 
 Type tI error. It reminds me of how quality control engineers often measure 
 Type II error, whereas accounting researchers almost never measure Type II 
 error.

In one of my statistics courses (Stanford) years ago from Jerry 
 Lieberman, we used that fantastic Engineering Statistics textbook book 
 authored by Bowker and Lieberman that contained OC curves for Type II error.

In practice, Type II errors are seldom measured in statistical inference 
 due to lack of robustness regarding distributional assumption errors 
 (notably unknown standard deviations) , although quality control guys 
 sometimes know enough about the distributions and standard deviations to 
 test for Type II error using Operating Characteristic Curves. Also there are 
 trade offs since the Type I and Type II errors are not independent of one 
 another. Accounting researchers take the easy way out by testing Type I 
 error and ignoring Type II error even though in most instances Type II error 
 is the most interesting error in empirical research.

Of course increasing sample sizes solved many of these Type I and II 
 inference testing problems, but for very large sample sizes what&apos;s the point 
 of inference testing in the first place? I often chuckle at capital markets 
 studies that do inference testing on very large sample sizes. These seem to 
 be just window dressing to appease journal referees.

What might be more interesting in auditing are Type III and Type IV 
 errors discussed by Mitroff and Silvers in their 2009 book entitled Dirty 
 Rotten Strategies (ISBN 978-0-8047-5996-0). Type III errors arise from 
 skilled investigation of the wrong questions. Type IV errors are similar 
 except they entail deliberately selecting the wrong questions to 
 investigate.

I think Fred Mosteller in 1948 was the first to suggest Type III error 
 for correctly rejecting the null hypothesis for the wrong reasons --- http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/sugi30/208-30.pdf  

Has anybody ever tested Type III error in TAR, JAR, or JAE?

 course that didn&apos;t deter anyone from continuing to tell this story or at 
 least seek to tell richer, more insightful stories.    The second involves another notable 
 contribution paper published by W&amp;Z, the famous Market for Excuses 
 paper. As Charles Christensen and later Tinker and Puxty demonstrated 
 the paper was incoherent from the start since it was self-contradictory 
 (among many other flaws). The paper may have been good libertarian 
 politics but it was not very good science.   My third anecdote involves a comment I 
 wrote for Advances in Public Interest Accounting many years ago. It was a comment on a paper by Ed Arrington. In that comment I used a 
 widely cited P/A paper (one that made Larry Brown&apos;s list in his AOS 
 classic papers paper) as an example to illustrate the ideologicial 
 blinders that afflict too many accounting researchers; we always tend to 
 find what we are looking for -- perhaps because the insightful 
 compressions we are looking for have to be consistent with Demski and 
 Zimmerman&apos;s views on the way the world should be (it certainly isn&apos;t the 
 way the world is). One comment I made on this P/A paper pertained to the 
 statistical analysis and it was, basically, that the statistically 
 significant variables really explained nothing and that there was no 
 story there.    To seek assurance I was on some kind of 
 solid ground I took my comments and the paper to a colleague who was an 
 econometrician (a University of Chicago Ph.D). Back in those days there 
 was no college of management at NC State, only the department of 
 economics and business, which was comprised of all economists except one 
 finance prof and the folks in accounting. Three days after I gave him 
 the material he called me into to his office to assure me I was correct 
 in my interpretation and he made a gesture quite profound, given the 
 metaphor about waste baskets. He picked up the paper (published in one 
 of the premier journals) and threw it in his waste basket. He said,&quot;That is where this paper belongs.&quot;  My issue with TAR, etc. is just 
 this -- even the 10% of papers we do publish aren&apos;t very good&quot;science&quot;(which is not definitive of a&quot;form&quot;that scholarship must have).      Paul Williams

 &quot;Its hardly news that the near meltdown of 
Americas financial system enriched a few at the expense of the rest of us. 
Whos responsible? The recent report of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission 
blamed all the usual suspects Wall Street banks, financial regulators, the 
mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, 
 and subprime lenders which is tantamount to blaming 
no one. Reckless Endangerment concentrates on particular individuals who 
played key roles. 

 The authors, Gretchen Morgenson, a Pulitzer 
Prize-winning business reporter and columnist at The New York Times, and Joshua 
Rosner, an expert on housing finance, deftly trace the beginnings of the 
collapse to the mid-1990s, when the Clinton administration called for a 
partnership between the private sector and Fannie and Freddie to encourage home 
buying. The mortgage agencies government backing was, in effect, a valuable 
subsidy, which was used by Fannies C.E.O., 
 James A. Johnson, to increase home ownership while 
enriching himself and other executives. A 1996 study by the Congressional Budget 
Office found that Fannie pocketed about a third of the subsidy rather than 
passing it on to homeowners. Over his nine years heading Fannie, Johnson 
personally took home roughly $100 million. His successor, Franklin D. Raines, 
was treated no less lavishly....&quot;

 Question
Is California really going to require 44 semester credits in accounting, 24 
credits in business-related courses, and an added 10 credits in ethics courses 
for CPA licensure candidates? 

&quot; California to Unveil New CPA License Requirements ,&quot; Accounting 
Today , May 31, 2011 ---
 http://www.accountingtoday.com/news/California-Unveil-New-CPA-License-Requirements-58558-1.html 
 
 The California Board of Accountancys Accounting 
 Education Committee and Ethics Curriculum Committee plan to hold a joint 
 meeting to unveil their proposals for the 30 additional hours of 
 education necessary for CPA licensure in California, beginning Jan. 1, 2014. 

 The Accounting Education Committee has been working 
 on a framework for the 20 semester units of accounting study, while the 
 Ethics Curriculum Committee has been working on a framework for the 10 
 semester units of ethics study. These additional hours were the result of 
 the California Legislatures passage of Senate Bill 819 in 2009. The new 
 requirements are designed to enhance consumer protection by strengthening 
 the competency of applicants as practitioners.

Jensen Comment
At present it&apos;s apparently possible in California, unlike in some other states, 
to take the CPA examination with only a 120-credit Baccalaureate 
degree such that the 150-credit requirement only applies for licensure in 
California. I had a student in Texas who got an accounting undergraduate degree 
and then beat the Texas law by flying to California to take the CPA examination 
because Texas would not allow him to take the CPA Examination without another 30 
credits. He passed all parts on the first sitting in California, although he did 
not attempt to use that as a basis for a CPA license in Texas. He instead went 
on to become one of the top Law School graduates at the University of Texas. 
He&apos;s probably chasing ambulances now instead of CPA clients. 

 Under Current Regulations 
Anyone applying for California CPA licensure for the first time (this includes 
candidates who have never been licensed anywhere as well as CPAs licensed 
out-of-state)and cancelled California licensees applying for reissuance must 
pass the exam (Ethics Exam 411) for Professional 
Ethics for CPAs (PETH). The CalCPA Education Foundation is the exam&apos;s only 
state-designated provider as well as the largest provider of continuing 
professional education for California CPAs.&quot; 
 http://www.calcpa.org/Content/educationfoundation/candidates.aspx 
I wonder if this is more for purposes of selling CPE credits than for raising 
the ethical quality of California CPAs?

Added Jensen Comment
Texas has formidable course requirements to sit for the CPA examination plus a 
150 semester credit requirement just to sit for the CPA examination in Texas 
(not just for licensure). In addition, Texas now requires that at least 15 of 
those credits (usually five semester courses) be taken onsite in an effort to 
restrict the number of courses that can be taken online even from AACSB 
accredited distance education programs like the University of Connecticut online 
accounting program. This also blocks out-of-state CPAs, like those from 
Connecticut, seeking licensure in Texas if they earned 150-credit distance 
education degrees without having the required onsite credits for designated 
accounting courses.
 
&quot; Number of Accounting Grads Hits New High ,&quot;AICPA, CPA Trendlines , 
May 27, 2011 ---
 http://cpatrendlines.com/2011/05/17/record-high-accounting-grads/ 
 
 Newly minted accountants have some of the brightest 
 job prospects in the nation, with nearly 90 percent of accounting firms 
 forecasting the same or increased hiring of graduates this year compared 
 with 2010, and nearly three quarters, 71 percent, of the largest firms 
 anticipating more hiring an indicator of a rebounding economy. 

 Thats according to survey results in the 2011 
 Trends in the Supply of Accounting Graduates and the Demand for Public 
 Accounting Recruits report by the American Institute of Certified Public 
 Accountants. The report shows record numbers of accounting students and 
 graduates, but also hints at a potential challenge for the profession: 
 demand for new talent eventually could outpace supply. 

 Opportunities in the accounting profession 
 continue to expand as the needs of firms and businesses grow ever more 
 complex and global, said Jeannie Patton, AICPA vice president for students, 
 academics and membership. As the U.S. and global economies recover, and as 
 seasoned professionals begin to retire in unprecedented numbers, its even 
 more important to guard against a talent shortage. Employers increasingly 
 want graduates with advanced degrees at the same time colleges, facing 
 budget and other constraints, are restricted in their capacity to train all 
 the students who want to join our profession. 

 The AICPA report echoes findings from the U.S. 
 Bureau of Labor Statistics, which expects accountants to experience much 
 faster than average employment growth in the coming years. The bureaus 
 2010-2011 Occupational Outlook Handbook estimates 22 percent growth in 
 accounting and auditing jobs in the decade between 2008 and 2018, adding 
 that job candidates with professional designations, particularly CPAs, and 
 graduates with masters degrees have the brightest outlook. 

 All told, 226,108 students were enrolled in 
 undergraduate or graduate accounting programs during the 2009-2010 academic 
 year, 6 percent more than in 2007-2008, the last time the AICPA conducted 
 its survey. A record 68,639 students graduated with accounting degrees in 
 2010. Nearly 4 in 10 accounting graduates hired last year by CPA firms had 
 masters degrees, compared with 26 percent in 2008. By contrast, 43 percent 
 of graduates hired had bachelors degrees, down from 56 percent in 2008. 

 The shift reflects growing complexity and 
 globalization of the accounting industry. And against that backdrop, 
 colleges and universities are struggling to keep up. According to the AICPA 
 report, a growing number of accounting programs are rejecting qualified 
 applicants because they dont have capacity to accept them. The increase 
 likely is due to budget constraints at universities brought on by the 
 economic downturn and a shortage of academically qualified professors as 
 many longtime teachers reach retirement.

 Dennis Huber gave me permission to share his 
 article at
   http://www.bus.lsu.edu/ accounting/faculty/lcrumbley/ jfia/Articles/FullText/2011_ v3n2a1.pdf     &quot; Does The American Accounting 
 Association Exist? An Example of Public Document Research ,&quot;by Wm. 
 Dennis Huber, Journal of Forensic&amp;Investigative Accounting , Vol. 
 3, Issue 2, Special Issue, 2011
 The purpose of this 
 article is, in part, to illustrate and educate what forensic accountants do 
 and how they do it with a step-by-step process. It demonstrates the kinds of 
 simple research in which forensic accountants should engage and should help 
 educate forensic accountants in the use of one of the basic tools of 
 investigation public records research using databases that are freely 
 available. More information can, of course, be obtained from fee-based 
 services, but one does not have to use fee-based services. This research can 
 serve as a basis for showing forensic accountants where to look, what to 
 look for, how to assemble various documents to tell a story, and how to 
 arrive at conclusions based on the evidence obtained. Conducting a forensic 
 accounting investigation typically leads to more questions as more facts are 
 uncovered, which then leads the forensic accountant down other paths to 
 discover other facts, and so forth, until a more complete picture is formed. 
 This approach uses the American Accounting Association (AAA) as an example, 
 looking at the AAA from a forensic accountants viewpoint. 

 
 
 A Rejoinder from the American Accounting Association 
 Executive Committee 
 
 Dear AAA Members, 

 Over the last 12 months, many of you have received a 
 series of emails from Dr. Larry Crumbley and Dr. Dennis Huber , sent from their personal email lists. These messages raise 
 questions related to governance procedures and the legal standing of the 
 American Accounting Association, unfairly maligning individual volunteers, 
 and impugning the integrity of the Association. Allegations and misleading 
 information have also been sent to organizations outside the AAA. As has 
 been reported publicly in the AAACommons and based upon everything we know 
 today (and have known since these e-mails began), we can categorically state 
 that there is not, nor has there been, a problem threatening our 
 organization&apos;s legal existence . Representatives of the State of 
 Illinois, the State of Florida, legal counsel, and our audit firm have 
 confirmed that there is no credible basis for any legal claim against the 
 Association. 

 As an organization focused on scholarly interchange in 
 accounting, it is our objective to promote a common set of values: 
 integrity, objectivity, a sense of community, transparency, respect for 
 others and high ethical values and standards. We are confident that these 
 values have been upheld, and that accusations aimed at the organization and 
 its member leadership are unfounded. To assure members of transparency and 
 access to details, you&apos;ll find below a brief summary and a link to a 
 detailed timeline and collection of source documents. 

 The&quot;silver lining&quot;in this situation has been our 
 discovery of an administrative error, which caused no damage to the 
 organization, its members, or any other party, but was necessary to resolve 
 and has been dealt with. At no time during this process have questions or 
 concerns about our legal status, or tax-exempt status been raised by 
 representatives we have worked with in Illinois or Florida. Officials in 
 both states as well as our attorney and auditors note the obvious good faith 
 in which the organization has operated, filing 990s, and regular annual 
 audits with audited financial reports published to members, etc. 

 We have been working over the last three weeks or so on a 
 matter Karon Beyer, Bureau Chief in the Florida State Department described 
 as an&quot;administrative hiccup&quot;that, while not ideal, is not uncommon in 
 member-based non-profit organizations. In summary: 

 As reported publicly in the AAACommons back in April, 
 the Association was incorporated in the State of Illinois in 1935, 
 maintaining incorporation there until 1996 when as a result of failing 
 to file an annual report the association&apos;s incorporation was dissolved.  Incorporation is not required, and the AAA continued 
 to operate in accordance with its bylaws until reinstating its corporate 
 status in June 2011.   The fact that the AAA had lost its incorporated 
 status was discovered by AAA leadership in 2002. Apparently, the advice 
 given to the AAA at the time for how to correct the situation was to 
 create an entirely new corporate entity by filing new articles of 
 incorporation, rather than reviving the 1935 corporation. That approach, 
 while not generally the preferred way to re-establish corporate status, 
 could have been viable had the assets, liabilities, memberships, etc. of 
 the 1935 entity been transferred to this new corporation, but that 
 transfer never occurred.  As a result, the AAA continued to operate as the 1935 
 entity, albeit unincorporated. The 2002 corporate entity never become 
 operational, existing as nothing more than an empty entity since its 
 creation.  Also in 2002, AAA mistakenly&quot;corrected&quot;its 
 registration in the State of Florida, paying a penalty of $2,100 to 
 refile and realign our registration in Florida as a foreign entity with 
 the errant 2002 entity in Illinois. Florida required that the 
 Association use what they label a&quot;Fictitious Name&quot;or&quot;Cross Reference 
 Name&quot;, because at that time the name&quot;American Accounting Association&quot;was already in use. The AAA chose&quot;American Accounting Educator&apos;s 
 Association&quot;doing business as American Accounting Association per state 
 filing requirements. AAA leaders in 2002 were unaware that a confusing 
 duplicate entity had been created in Illinois.  When the situation came to light in late April, the 
 Executive Director immediately contacted Executive Committee leadership, 
 the association&apos;s attorney, and the association&apos;s auditors. Our attorney 
 contacted the State of Illinois, and began their regular process for 
 addressing the issue (the cost of $251 total for completing the process 
 is an indication of the minor level of concern from the State of 
 Illinois). Our attorney provided the necessary forms, and the 
 Executive Director completed those forms per the unanimous vote of the 
 AAA Executive Committee during its strategic planning retreat in late 
 May. Then implementing the procedure recommended by the State of 
 Illinois we revived our 1935 corporate status while dissolving the 2002 
 entity. No membership vote was required to effect these actions, 
 including dissolving the 2002 entity since it was a mistakenly created 
 entity with no assets, members, etc. Illinois verifies that this process 
 has been completed, our 1935 corporation revived, the 2002 entity 
 dissolved, and our good standing confirmed. We are in process of filing necessary paperwork to 
 align our Florida registration with the appropriate Illinois corporation 
 which should involve a filing fee of about $52.50. There will not likely 
 be a fine, as the Florida State Department&apos;s Bureau Chief noted that 
 this is a simple and common administrative correction and we have 
 obviously been registered and filing appropriate annual reports, 990s, 
 etc. She provided all necessary forms to withdraw our current 
 registration in Florida to the incorrect Illinois entity, and qualify to 
 be properly filed in Florida in alignment with our revived 1935 
 corporation in Illinois. 

 During the early part of this series of questions it was 
 possible to respond relatively quickly to questions raised by Dr. Huber and Dr. Crumbley about balloting and 
 governance, and early responses to questions raised were posted publicly in 
 the AAACommons, as has been all the work of our recent governance review 
 (see FAQs at http://commons.aaahq.org/ hives/eb01c0adea/summary ). 

 The tone of more recent communications has made responding 
 quickly more difficult. Messages questioning the integrity of the AAA and 
 its volunteer leaders and staff have been sent to our exhibitors, our 
 auditor, the press, and the States of Illinois and Florida. These messages 
 point to Dr. Huber &apos;s charges published in the Journal of Forensic&amp;Investigative Accounting (an independent journal 
 with no affiliation with the AAA or its Sections, edited by Dr. Crumbley and 
 published by Louisiana State University). The journal&apos;s website (as of June 
 17, 2011) abstract page lists&quot;AAA Attorney&quot;under the Dr. Huber &apos;s name as author. AAA attorneys were not in any way involved in 
 the writing of the article, nor are the section&apos;s included in the article 
 under the sub-heading&quot;AAA Attorney response&quot;responses quoted from or 
 written by the AAA Attorney. These escalating challenges, and our increased 
 need to respond to them through a deliberative process in communications, 
 has created a significant distraction for the AAA staff and volunteer 
 leaders, draining resources, time, and funds. 

 Responding to the need for deliberative process in 
 communications related to escalating challenges has become a significant 
 distraction, draining resources of time, focus, and funds. 

 Members can find a compiled a list of source documents and 
 details related to the issues raised by Dr. Huber and Dr. Crumbley on the AAACommons http://commons.aaahq.org/ hives/b5e22ebcfb/summary . You 
 will need your user name and password to log into the AAACommons. If you 
 have any questions, please feel free to contact any one of us. 

 Finally, we affirm that we have the utmost confidence in 
 our professional and volunteer leadership serving throughout this period. In 
 particular, Dr. Sutherland, prior volunteer leaders, and the Governance 
 Review Task Force have worked tirelessly to make sure that our Association 
 operates with the highest standards and that members are treated with 
 respect and consideration. Allegations against their actions and character 
 are unwarranted and should not be allowed to go undisputed.  

 Volunteer leaders contribute an enormous amount of time, 
 energy, and ideas to the Association. More than 150 colleagues are serving 
 today as officers of our Regions, Sections, and the AAA, and many more serve 
 in committee and other important roles. They do so because they believe in 
 the AAA and its work. While we may have differing individual views on how 
 best to achieve what we wish for in the organization, we are confident that 
 our leaders and community have upheld the shared values of the American 
 Accounting Association.

 Accounting, Finance, and Business Graduate Average Salaries are Neither in 
the Top Nor the Bottom Top Ten 

&quot;Major Decisions,&quot;by Kevin Kiley, Inside Higher Ed , May 24, 
2011--- Click Here 
  http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/05/24/georgetown_study_of_salaries_for_different_majors_finds_big_discrepancy_women_and_minorities_in_low_paying_fields 

Jensen Comment
I always advised my students that things other than starting salaries were often 
more important. For example, in accounting the most important factors are client 
exposure (clients often make the best offers to auditors and consultants), the 
professional nature of interesting work, and the amount and quality of the 
training are more important for the long haul than starting salaries.

Advancement opportunities are also very important. Consideration should also 
be given to travel demands (good news to some graduates and bad news to other 
graduates) and pressures such as compensation based upon sales commissions or 
other pressure cookers.

Also give consideration to the numbers of opportunities and the locations of 
where those opportunities take place. Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering 
graduates are paid well, but they are relatively few in number and face only a 
limited number of job opportunities and locales. One of my closest friends has a 
son who graduated as an engineer from Maine Maritime Academy and received all 
sorts of opportunities in the Merchant Marines. However, after recently getting 
married the romance of being stationed aboard Far East merchant vessels lost a 
lot of its appeal with his young and pretty wife living on a horse farm in 
Conway, New Hampshire. If he&apos;d instead become a N.H. CPA he could probably have 
great opportunities in the Mt. Washington Valley and live each day on the farm.

And in some cases health and pension plans can be very important. Any career 
that provides a lifetime pension after only 20-30 years of service provides a 
tremendous opportunity for double dipping later in life. Consider running for 
the U.S. Congress where a short four-year stint can get you a lifetime pension 
with great medical benefits for a lifetime. Of course there&apos;s a lot of crap to 
wade through getting nominated and elected.

To me the most important factor is independence and freedom of time control 
such as those freedoms afforded to college professors. If I had it to do all 
over again I would get a PhD in accounting (since accounting PhDs are in such 
short supply for the tremendous needs of the market). I guess in the 1960s I was 
the maggot that was dropped by a soaring bird into the sweetest manure pile 
around.

Francine discusses strategies used by large auditing firms to avoid paying 
overtime, often in conflict with both state laws and auditing standards. CPA 
firms are not unique in seeking out ways to avoid overtime pay laws. Similar 
ploys are taken by hospitals and medical clinics paying residents and 
universities paying adjunct faculty and graduate students.

 How Accountants Hide the Pension Bomb in the Public Sectors 

&quot; The Hidden State Financial Crisis: My latest research into opaque 
state financial statements suggests taxpayers will be surprised by how much 
pensions are underfunded .,&quot;by Meredith Whitney, The Wall Street Journal , 
May 18, 2011 ---
 http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703421204576329134261805612.html?mod=djemEditorialPage_t 
 
 Next month will be pivotal for most states, as it 
 marks the fiscal year end and is when balanced budgets are due. The states 
 have racked up over $1.8 trillion in taxpayer-supported obligations in large 
 part by underfunding their pension and other post-employment benefits. Yet 
 over the past three years, there still has been a cumulative excess of $400 
 billion in state budget shortfalls. States have already been forced to raise 
 taxes and cut programs to bridge those gaps. 

 Next month will also mark the end of the American 
 Recovery and Reinvestment Act&apos;s $480 billion in federal stimulus, which has 
 subsidized states through the economic downturn. States have grown more 
 dependent on federal subsidies, relying on them for almost 30% of their 
 budgets. 

 The condition of state finances threatens the 
 economic recovery. States employ over 19 million Americans, or 15% of the 
 U.S. work force, and state spending accounts for 12% of U.S. gross domestic 
 product. The process of reining in state finances will be painful for us 
 all. 

 The rapid deterioration of state finances must be 
 addressed immediately. Some dismiss these concerns, because they believe 
 states will be able to grow their way out of these challenges. The reality 
 is that while state revenues have improved, they have done so in part from 
 tax hikes. However, state tax revenues still remain at roughly 2006 levels. 

 Expenses are near the highest they have ever been 
 due to built-in annual cost escalators that have no correlation to revenue 
 growth (or decline, as has been the case recently). Even as states have made 
 deep cuts in some social programs, their fixed expenses of debt service and 
 the actuarially recommended minimum pension and other retirement payments 
 have skyrocketed. While over the past 10 years state and local government 
 spending has grown by 65%, tax receipts have grown only by 32%. 

 Off balance sheet debt is the legal obligation of 
 the state to its current and past employees in the form of pension and other 
 retirement benefits. Today, off balance sheet debt totals over $1.3 
 trillion, as measured by current accounting standards, and it accounts for 
 almost 75% of taxpayer-supported state debt obligations. Only recently have 
 states been under pressure to disclose more information about these 
 liabilities, because it is clear that their debt burdens are grossly 
 understated. 

 Since January, some of my colleagues focused 
 exclusively on finding the most up-to-date information on ballooning 
 tax-supported state obligations. This meant going to each state and local 
 government&apos;s website for current data, which we found was truly opaque and 
 without uniform standards. 

 What concerned us the most was the fact that fixed 
 debt-service costs are increasingly crowding out state monies for essential 
 services. For example, New Jersey&apos;s ratio of total tax-supported state 
 obligations to gross state product is over 30%, and the fixed costs to 
 service those obligations eat up 16% of the total budget. Even these numbers 
 are skewed, because they represent only the bare minimum paid into funding 
 pension and retirement plans. We calculate that if New Jersey were to pay 
 the actuarially recommended contribution, fixed costs would absorb 37% of 
 the budget. New Jersey is not alone. 

 The real issue here is the enormous over-leveraging 
 of taxpayer-supported obligations at a time when taxpayers are already 
 paying more and receiving less. In the states most affected by skyrocketing 
 debt and fiscal imbalances, social services continue to be cut the most. 
 Taxpayers have the ultimate voting rightwith their feet. Corporations are 
 relocating, or at a minimum moving large portions of their businesses to 
 more tax-friendly states. 

 Boeing is in the political cross-hairs as it is 
 trying to set up a facility in the more business-friendly state of South 
 Carolina, away from its current hub of Washington. California legislators 
 recently went to Texas to learn best practices as a result of a rising tide 
 of businesses that are building operations outside of their state. Over 
 time, individuals will migrate to more tax-friendly states as well, and job 
 seekers will follow corporations.

Jensen Comment
Some accountants naively assume that the new IASB-FASB agreement on fair value 
accounting will make pension obligations more transparent, especially if the 
GASB follows suit. What they don&apos;t really understand is that obligations that 
are not recognized in the first place are not going to be made more transparent 
with fair value accounting if they&apos;re hidden in the first place. For ten years 
Arnold Swartzenagger disclosed four kids and hid a fifth kid from his wife and 
the rest of the world. With pensions it&apos;s more like disclosing one kid and 
hiding four from the world.
 
Hi Pat,

 In Theory, Exit Values Often Should not be Disaggregated from&quot;In Use&quot;Factors 
 Although there are many flaws in the present mixed attributes conglomeration 
of valuations of assets and liabilities, I just do not see that valuation of 
non-financial assets at their worst possible exit value usages for the sake of 
consistency makes any sense. Especially 
troublesome are non-financial fixed assets that have high&quot;in use&quot;values and low exit values. 
For example, ERP information systems, factory robots, computers, etc. may lose 
most of their exit values the moment they are put to use even though their 
expected lives may be ten or more years. Maybe I&apos;m just an old has been who 
clings to the importance of the income statement vis-a-vis the balance sheet.

Exit value changes are pure fiction for held-to-maturity items, especially 
debt, where transactions costs of often preclude cashing in before maturity 
preclude taking advantage of changes in exit values. For example, a company that 
has $100 million of collateralized debt outstanding cannot t usually take 
advantage of short-term reductions in interest rates due to the transactions 
costs of paying off or calling in that debt prematurely and paying the 
transactions cost of issuing new collateralized debt. I was really sorry to see 
the IASB and the FASB abandon the concept of held-to-maturity since in many 
instances the HTM classification in FAS 115 prevented a lot of fiction movements 
in earnings that will never be realized.

I don&apos;t view&quot;in use&quot;net present value accounting necessarily more 
subjective than exit value estimations for items that have very unique values 
such as valuations of each of the Days Inns hotels where appraisers may differ 
greatly as the valuation of each and every hotel. I would in fact probably 
consider estimations of discounted net cash flows of a given hotel as probably 
being as reliable or even more reliable than real estate appraiser estimates of 
exit value (due largely to reasons mentioned below for in-use factors).

For nearly a century accounting theorists have advocated that&quot;in use&quot;valuation is preferable to exit valuation that ignores usage. One reason is that 
appraised values of items like real estate may move up and down with market 
movements that are will never be realized by a going concern that intends to 
keep using its assets like factory buildings irrespective of transitory shifts 
in local markets affecting exit values but not operating profits of the firm. 
Also there&apos;s a possibility that exit values of things factory buildings remain 
relatively constant while the economic values of the firm fluctuate up and down. 
Reporting stationary exit values in the presence of wildly changing&quot;in use&quot;economic values can be misleading for going concerns.

 In Practice, Exit Values Often Cannot be Disaggregated from&quot;In Use&quot;Factors 
The IASB naively assumes that exit values can be estimated apart from&quot;in use&quot;factors. This is very, very often just not the case and this greatly complicates 
estimation of exit values. Let me begin with a real-world case that took place 
in Littleton, NH around the turn of the century. I will treat this as a 
hypothetical case simply because I&apos;m not familiar with the actual numbers. But 
the case actually transpired.

For decades Market B (a medium-sized super market) pretty much had a monopoly 
for Littleton-area residents. It operated out of an old but functional building. 
Suppose the 1999 and 2000financial statements read as follows:

   Market B
1999
 Net Book Value Market B
1999
 Exit Value Market B 
2000
 Net Book Value Market B
 2000
 Exit Value Land $100,000 $1,000,000 $100,000 $1,000,000 Building $210,000 $2,000,000 $200,000 $0 

In use factors affected the 1999 exit value estimation of $2 million because, 
if the land and building were put on the market, bidders for this real estate 
would be other supermarket investors taking advantage of the monopoly status of 
Market B. They could buy this real estate before year 2000 and immediately set 
up shop as a monopoly supermarket.

Note that&quot;in use&quot;factors affected the real estate appraisal values since 
the buyers all had the same use in mind for the building. And there were quite a 
few potential buyers since Market B was very profitable as a monopolist.

In Year 2,000 Market S built a $10 million building literally adjacent to 
Market B. Potential supermarket buyers lost all interest in buying the Market 
B&apos;s building. The land still had serious value, but the old building was worth 
virtually zero (or negative) in alternate uses because of its age, condition, 
and costs of remodeling for alternate uses.

In 2001 Market S buys the Market B real estate for $1,000,000 and pays to 
tear down the Market B building that in 1999 was valued at $2,000,000 by 
independent real estate appraisers who had a pretty good idea of what the 
building was worth as long as there were outside buyers of the building to be 
put&quot;in use&quot;as a monopoly supermarket in the Littleton vicinity.

In 1999, would the new IASB exit value standard require a valuation of $0 
since there was no alternate value of the building other than the value in use 
as a supermarket monopoly? In fact, if Market B had built a new building 
elsewhere it probably would have torn down the old building in 1999.

Actually this is very close but not identical to what happened when Buxtons 
had a supermarket monopoly in the Littleton vicinity. Then the giant Shaws 
supermarket chain built a huge supermarket literally next door to Buxtons. 
Buxtons quickly went out of business, and there were zero buyers interested in 
buying the building as a supermarket to compete with Shaws next door. Shaws 
bought the Buxton real estate and now leases about 10% of the building space to 
a drive-in bank. The remaining 90% of the building has been vacant for a decade.

In use factors repeatedly affect real estate values. One of my closest 
friends down the road owns rental properties scattered about northern New 
England. A few years back he competed with a number of other bidders willing to 
pay in the range of $1 million for a small office building in the mill town of 
Rumford, Maine. My friend acquired the building with a high bid of $1.2 million. 
Virtually all the buyers intended to keep leasing the building to the Veterans 
Administration that had an&quot;in use&quot;office operation in that building since 
World War 2 ended.

My friend invested more in the building to keep the VA happy as a tenant, 
including the cost of a new elevator. In 2002 my friend seriously considered an 
offer of $1.5 million to sell the building and mistakenly refused the offer. 
This was affected by&quot;in use&quot;factors since at the time nobody expected the VA 
to move out of the building.

But the paper mill towns in northern New England were hit hard times in the 
past decade. The Rumford economy took a nose dive, and one of its shopping malls 
became totally vacant. In 2009, the VA announced its intentions to move to the 
vacant mall. Now my friend has a building with negative economic value in a 
struggling mill town having great excess capacity for office space. My friend at 
the moment is seriously considering letting his investment go for taxes since 
the prospects of getting rental income in excess of property taxes appear to be 
nil for the foreseeable future.

Interestingly, real estate appraisers still estimate the building to be worth 
$800,000, but there are zero buyers for a building at its appraised value.

How does the new IASB standard deal with situations where appraised values of 
real estate are relatively high when there are no buyers willing to take on the 
property taxes?

Sometimes real estate has to be taken over by towns for taxes before those 
towns will lower the property taxes enough to attract buyers. This greatly 
complicates exit value estimations of real estate.

It&apos;s not hard to find millions of more examples where&quot;in use&quot;factors affect 
appraised values, especially in real estate.

 Questions
Although all 50 states are in deep financial troubles, what state is in the 
worst shape at the moment and is unable to pay its bills?
Hint: The state in deepest trouble is not California, although California is in 
dire straights! 

 How did accountants hide the pending 
disaster? 

 Watch the Video
This module on 60 Minutes on December 19 was one of the most worrisome episodes 
I&apos;ve ever watched
It appears that a huge number of cities and towns and some states will default 
on bonds within12 months from now
&quot;State Budgets: The Day of Reckoning Steve Kroft Reports On The Growing 
Financial Woes States Are Facing,&quot;CBS Sixty Minutes, December 19, 2010 ---
 http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/12/19/60minutes/main7166220.shtml 
 
 The problem with that, according to Wall Street 
 analyst Meredith Whitney, is that no one really knows how deep the holes 
 are. She and her staff spent two years and thousands of man hours trying to 
 analyze the financial condition of the 15 largest states. She wanted to find 
 out if they would be able to pay back the money they&apos;ve borrowed and what 
 kind of risk they pose to the $3 trillion municipal bond market, where state 
 and local governments go to finance their schools, highways, and other 
 projects. 

 &quot;How accurate is the financial information that&apos;s 
 public on the states? And municipalities,&quot;Kroft asked. 

 &quot;The lack of transparency with the state disclosure 
 is the worst I have ever seen,&quot;Whitney said.&quot;Ultimately we have to use 
 what&apos;s publicly available data and a lot of it is as old as June 2008. So 
 that&apos;s before the financial collapse in the fall of 2008.&quot; 

 Whitney believes the states will find a way to 
 honor their debts, but she&apos;s afraid some local governments which depend on 
 their state for a third of their revenues will get squeezed as the states 
 are forced to tighten their belts. She&apos;s convinced that some cities and 
 counties will be unable to meet their obligations to municipal bond holders 
 who financed their debt. Earlier this year, the state of Pennsylvania had to 
 rescue the city of Harrisburg, its capital, from defaulting on hundreds of 
 millions of dollars in debt for an incinerator project. 

 &quot;There&apos;s not a doubt in my mind that you will see a 
 spate of municipal bond defaults,&quot;Whitney predicted. 

 Asked how many is a&quot;spate,&quot;Whitney said,&quot;You 
 could see 50 sizeable defaults. Fifty to 100 sizeable defaults. More. This 
 will amount to hundreds of billions of dollars&apos; worth of defaults.&quot; 

 Municipal bonds have long been considered to be 
 among the safest investments, bought by small investors saving for 
 retirement, and held in huge numbers by big banks. Even a few defaults could 
 affect the entire market. Right now the big bond rating agencies like 
 Standard&amp;Poor&apos;s and Moody&apos;s, who got everything wrong in the housing 
 collapse, say there&apos;s no cause for concern, but Meredith Whitney doesn&apos;t 
 believe it. 

 &quot;When individual investors look to people that are 
 supposed to know better, they&apos;re patted on the head and told, &apos;It&apos;s not 
 something you need to worry about.&apos; It&apos;ll be something to worry about within 
 the next 12 months,&quot;she said. 

 No one is talking about it now, but the big test 
 will come this spring. That&apos;s when $160 billion in federal stimulus money, 
 that has helped states and local governments limp through the great 
 recession, will run out. 

 The states are going to need some more cash and 
 will almost certainly ask for another bailout. Only this time there are no 
 guarantees that Washington will ride to the rescue.

 &quot; Public Pensions Cook the 
Books: Some plans want to hide the truth from taxpayers ,&quot;by Andrew Biggs, The Wall Street Journal , July 6, 2009 --- http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124683573382697889.html 
 
 Here&apos;s a dilemma: You manage a public employee 
 pension plan and your actuary tells you it is significantly underfunded. You 
 don&apos;t want to raise contributions. Cutting benefits is out of the question. 
 To be honest, you&apos;d really rather not even admit there&apos;s a problem, lest 
 taxpayers get upset. 

 What to do? For the administrators of two Montana 
 pension plans, the answer is obvious: Get a new actuary. Or at least that&apos;s 
 the essence of the managers&apos; recent solicitations for actuarial services, 
 which warn that actuaries who favor reporting the full market value of 
 pension liabilities probably shouldn&apos;t bother applying. 

 Public employee pension plans are plagued by 
 overgenerous benefits, chronic underfunding, and now trillion dollar 
 stock-market losses. Based on their preferred accounting methods -- which 
 discount future liabilities based on high but uncertain returns projected 
 for investments -- these plans are underfunded nationally by around $310 
 billion. 

 The numbers are worse using market valuation 
 methods (the methods private-sector plans must use), which discount benefit 
 liabilities at lower interest rates to reflect the chance that the expected 
 returns won&apos;t be realized. Using that method, University of Chicago 
 economists Robert Novy-Marx and Joshua Rauh calculate that, even prior to 
 the market collapse, public pensions were actually short by nearly $2 
 trillion. That&apos;s nearly $87,000 per plan participant. With employee benefits 
 guaranteed by law and sometimes even by state constitutions, it&apos;s likely 
 these gargantuan shortfalls will have to be borne by unsuspecting taxpayers. 

 Some public pension administrators have a strategy, 
 though: Keep taxpayers unsuspecting. The Montana Public Employees&apos; 
 Retirement Board and the Montana Teachers&apos; Retirement System declare in a 
 recent solicitation for actuarial services that&quot;If the Primary Actuary or 
 the Actuarial Firm supports [market valuation] for public pension plans, 
 their proposal may be disqualified from further consideration.&quot; 

 Scott Miller, legal counsel of the Montana Public 
 Employees Board, was more straightforward:&quot;The point is we aren&apos;t 
 interested in bringing in an actuary to pressure the board to adopt market 
 value of liabilities theory.&quot; 

 While corporate pension funds are required by law 
 to use low, risk-adjusted discount rates to calculate the market value of 
 their liabilities, public employee pensions are not. However, financial 
 economists are united in believing that market-based techniques for valuing 
 private sector investments should also be applied to public pensions. 

 Because the power of compound interest is so 
 strong, discounting future benefit costs using a pension plan&apos;s high 
 expected return rather than a low riskless return can significantly reduce 
 the plan&apos;s measured funding shortfall. But it does so only by ignoring risk. 
 The expected return implies only the&quot;expectation&quot;-- meaning, at least a 
 50% chance, not a guarantee -- that the plan&apos;s assets will be sufficient to 
 meet its liabilities. But when future benefits are considered to be riskless 
 by plan participants and have been ruled to be so by state courts, a 51% 
 chance that the returns will actually be there when they are needed hardly 
 constitutes full funding. 

 Public pension administrators argue that government 
 plans fundamentally differ from private sector pensions, since the 
 government cannot go out of business. Even so, the only true advantage 
 public pensions have over private plans is the ability to raise taxes. But 
 as the Congressional Budget Office has pointed out in 2004,&quot;The government 
 does not have a capacity to bear risk on its own&quot;-- rather, government 
 merely redistributes risk between taxpayers and beneficiaries, present and 
 future. 

 Market valuation makes the costs of these potential 
 tax increases explicit, while the public pension administrators&apos; approach, 
 which obscures the possibility that the investment returns won&apos;t achieve 
 their goals, leaves taxpayers in the dark. 

 For these reasons, the Public Interest Committee of 
 the American Academy of Actuaries recently stated,&quot;it is in the public 
 interest for retirement plans to disclose consistent measures of the 
 economic value of plan assets and liabilities in order to provide the 
 benefits promised by plan sponsors.&quot; 

 Nevertheless, the National Association of State 
 Retirement Administrators, an umbrella group representing government 
 employee pension funds, effectively wants other public plans to take the 
 same low road that the two Montana plans want to take. It argues against 
 reporting the market valuation of pension shortfalls. But the association&apos;s 
 objections seem less against market valuation itself than against the fact 
 that higher reported underfunding&quot;could encourage public sector plan 
 sponsors to abandon their traditional pension plans in lieu of defined 
 contribution plans.&quot; 

 The Government Accounting Standards Board, which 
 sets guidelines for public pension reporting, does not currently call for 
 reporting the market value of public pension liabilities. The board 
 announced last year a review of its position regarding market valuation but 
 says the review may not be completed until 2013. 

 This is too long for state taxpayers to wait to 
 find out how many trillions they owe. 
 
 &quot; Whither Berkeley? 
Whither California? &quot;by J. Edward Ketz, SmartPros , November 
2009 ---
 http://accounting.smartpros.com/x68185.xml 

 When people ignore 
economic realities and are foolish enough to make and adhere to ill-conceived 
and faulty budgets, well, they get what they deserve. Take California, for 
example. 

 The state has greatly 
reduced its cash infusions to the University of California system, and recently 
the universitys regents voted to increase fees (Californias code word for 
tuition) 32%. This has led to a strike at Berkeley and to student 
demonstrations and to the take-over of some buildings there and at Santa Cruz. 
This planned tuition hike comes on the heels of layoffs and furloughs and salary 
cutbacks of many university employees. 

 Recently, the 
Academic Senate at Berkeley voted to end financial support for the Department of 
Intercollegiate Athletics. The Senate even had the gall to ask the Athletics 
department to repay a loan of $5.8 million. Nothing is sacred anymore! But 
nothing to fearI bet the regents will save Berkeley football before it saves 
the classics department. 

 The state of affairs 
at Berkeley will be watched all over because many other public universities are 
not much different. It is only a matter of time when they too will be faced with 
the question of how to endure economic sacrifice. 

 But, it wont be all 
bad. Such difficult times provide moments when society can rethink its goals and 
strategic priorities. How many research universities do we really need in this 
country? How many administrators do we really need to protect the interests of 
Croatian students or to assist those who wish to preserve the heritage of Bon 
Jovi or to supply counselors for those trying to give up Law and Order? And does 
every town with a population of at least 1,000 really need a branch campus? 

 The state of 
California itself is much worse off than Berkeley. Given the states penchant to 
provide welfare to everybody who can generate a creative excuse for an 
entitlement, it was only a matter of time before the states budget was so out 
of whack even Alec Baldwin and Barbara Streisand could acknowledge it. 

 State legislators and 
governors over the last 10 to 20 years are to blame. Not only do they not 
understand the word NO when it comes to spending, they were very short-sighted 
when it came to revenue generation. They thought the dot-com slush funds would 
continue to be created out of nothing, though physics and economics indicate 
otherwise. They then did want virtually every politician doesthey are so 
without original ideas!they raised taxes on corporations and rich people. 
Unfortunately, the legislators and governors forgot that corporations and rich 
people can move, and indeed enough of them have left the state, leaving 
California in serious trouble. 

 The woes are so great 
that it is easy to predict that California will become the first state in U.S. 
history to declare bankruptcy. I put the odds at least at 50 percent in 2010. 

 Then the fun begins. 
California, before or shortly after entering Chapter 11, will ask for help from 
Washington. While the Obama administration and the Congress likely will 
administer CPR to the state finances, they really should just admit that the 
state is insolvent. The moral hazard is huge. If Washington provides assistance, 
there will be 49 states that will quickly follow suit. 

 The bankruptcy 
process itself will be interesting because nobody will know what to do with a 
state. Creditors might try to win concessions about the states budgeting 
process or membership to state agencies that make economic decisions. They will 
also attempt to rewrite existing contracts. 

 The biggest effect 
will be on bond yields. Any bankruptcy will shoot rates up and this will make 
future governmental borrowing hard and expensive for all governmental units. 

 Taxpayers will face a 
major nightmare. Taxes will skyrocket for those who are not fortunate enough to 
be retired. Maybe taxpayers will even wake up and realize that they have elected 
nothing but economic idiots for quite some time. But what do you expect from a 
state that thinks actors actually know something? 

 I just love 
California dreamin.

&quot; AIG Share Sale Aids Ohio Firefighters Burned by Stock Losses ,&quot;by Noah Bahayar , Business Week , May 24, 2011 ---
 http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-05-24/aig-share-sale-aids-ohio-firefighters-burned-by-stock-losses.html?link_position=link21 

American International Group Inc. investors including 
Ohio firefighters are being compensated for stock declines dating to Eliot 
Spitzers 2004 probe as the insurer raises funds to move beyond a U.S. rescue.

AIG will use $550 million from a share sale scheduled for 
today to pay for a settlement reached last year in a securities- fraud case 
brought by investors led by Ohio pension funds. The bailed-out insurer and U.S. 
Treasury Department are selling 300 million shares to replace government funds 
with private capital. The sale would raise about $9 billion at yesterdays 
closing share price, with two-thirds going to Treasury.

Chief Executive Officer Robert Benmosche, 66, has been 
working to resolve legal disputes tied to probes by Spitzer, who won a $1.64 
billion settlement with AIG in 2006 when he was New York attorney general. 
Benmosche needs to attract private investors as Treasury seeks to lower its 
stake in the New York- based insurer from 92 percent.

The new shareholders, after day one of this share sale, 
they absolutely want a clean slate, said Roddy Boyd, author of Fatal Risk: A 
Cautionary Tale of AIGs Corporate Suicide. AIGs management has enough 
competitive pressures out there, having sold their crown jewels, that they dont 
need things weighing on the share price.

AIG has slipped 38 percent this year through yesterday in 
New York trading as the insurer was forced to add $4.2 billion to reserves after 
disclosing a shortfall in February. Benmosche, AIGs fifth CEO since 2005, has 
sold the companys biggest non- U.S. life insurance units to help repay the 
bailout.

Better Trajectory

The 2006 settlement resolved Spitzers allegations that 
AIG misled investors, faked bids and cheated workers compensation programs. The 
deal, which Spitzer said would send AIG off on a better trajectory, failed to 
restore investor confidence in the firm and fueled the insurers disputes with 
other states, rival insurers, investors and ex-executives.

Record losses in 2008 cast doubt on whether AIG could 
compensate investors hurt in 2004, said Thomas A. Dubbs, senior partner for 
Labaton Sucharow LLP and lead counsel for the Ohio funds, which provide for the 
retirement of firefighters, police officers and teachers. In 2010, as AIG 
returned to profit and struck a deal to regain independence, Benmosche agreed to 
settle the case for $725 million, with an initial $175 million payment.

Raising the rest through the share offering was a 
creative and outstanding result, given that in the fall of 2008, many people 
believed AIG might not survive, said Dubbs.

The agreement also covered public pension funds in New 
Mexico, Mississippi and California. The group said AIG had fraudulently inflated 
results, causing the share price to plummet when the deception was uncovered.

Restoring the Value

The accord allows AIG to continue to focus its efforts 
on paying back taxpayers and restoring the value of our franchise, said Mark 
Herr, a spokesman for the insurer. AIG will use remaining proceeds from its 
portion of the share sale for general corporate purposes, the company said May 
11.

AIG resolved legal disputes in 2009 with former CEO 
Maurice Hank Greenberg, who was forced out during the Spitzer probe. The 
insurer agreed to reimburse as much as $150 million in legal fees for Greenberg 
and ex-Chief Financial Officer Howard Smith.

State insurance regulators and AIGs rivals said the 
Spitzer settlement didnt account for all of the firms deception in 
shortchanging workers compensation pools and demanded additional funds. 
Benmosche agreed in December to pay $100 million in fines and $46.5 million in 
taxes to a group of state regulators.

 Financial Accounting, Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Securities and 
 Exchange Commission 

 SUMMARY:  Ernst&amp;Young (E&amp;Y)&quot;was 
 censured by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and 
 will pay $1.5 million to settle charges that it compromised its 
 independence through work it did in 2001 for clients American 
 International Group Inc. and PNC Financial Services Group.&quot;Regulators claimed AIG hired E&amp;Y to develop and promote an 
 accounting-driven financial product to help public companies 
 shift troubled or volatile assets off their books using 
 special-purpose entities created by AIG.&quot;PNC accounted 
 incorrectly for its special purpose entities according to the 
 SEC, who also said that&quot;PNC&apos;s accounting errors weren&apos;t 
 detected because E&amp;Y auditors didn&apos;t scrutinize important 
 corporate transactions, relying on advice given by other E&amp;Y 
 partners. 

 QUESTIONS:  
1.) What are&quot;special 
 purpose entities&quot;or&quot;variable interest entities&quot;? For what 
 business purposes may they be developed?

2.) What new 
 interpretation addresses issues in accounting for variable 
 interest entities?

3.) What issues led to the development 
 of the new accounting requirements in this area? What business 
 failure is associated with improper accounting for and 
 disclosures about variable interest entities?

4.) For 
 what invalid business purposes do regulators claim that AIG used 
 special purpose entities (now called variable interest 
 entities)? Why would Ernst&amp;Young be asked to develop these 
 entities?

5.) What audit services issue arose because of 
 the combination of consulting work and auditing work done by one 
 public accounting firm (E&amp;Y)? What laws are now in place to 
 prohibit the relationships giving rise to this conflict of 
 interest?

 TOPICS:  Auditing, Regulation, Sarbanes-Oxley Act, SEC, Securities and 
 Exchange Commission

 SUMMARY:  &quot;A combination 
 of mergers, fewer U.S. IPOs, lower listing costs abroad and a shift in how 
 investors and stockbrokers do their jobs has driven down the number of U.S. 
 stock listings by a startling 43% since the peak in 1997-all during a period 
 when the number of listings outside the U.S. has more than doubled.&quot;The 
 article begins by describing the LinkedIN Corp. executives participation in 
 ringing the opening bell on May 26; the ringing of the closing bell was done 
 by the head of Sybase in honor of a golf tournament, but that company is no 
 longer listed on the NYSE because it has been taken over.

 CLASSROOM APPLICATION:  Questions 
 ask students to understand the overall scenario described in the article as 
 well as the impact of regulation on companies undertaking listings on U.S. 
 stock exchanges. The article could be used in any course covering 
 regulation, such as auditing, and the role of stock exchanges, such as a 
 financial reporting class.

 QUESTIONS:  
1. ( Introductory ) Overall, what has been the trend in new listings 
 (initial public offerings, or IPOs) on U.S. stock exchanges as described in 
 this article?

2. ( Introductory ) Access the interactive graphic related to the 
 article. What are the locations of the stock exchanges competing for major 
 listings that are depicted in the graphic? Describe the trend in activity on 
 each of these exchanges and in total for the time period covered.

3. ( Introductory ) What recent merger agreement has been made by the 
 company that owns the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)? What is the strategy

&quot;U.S. Falls Behind in Stock Listings,&quot;by Aaron Lucchetti, The Wall Street 
Journal on May 26, 2011 ---
 http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703421204576329400112880300.html?mod=djem_jiewr_AC_domainid 
 
 Executives from LinkedIn Corp., reveling in their 
 enormously successful initial public offering last Thursday, rang the New 
 York Stock Exchange&apos;s opening bell. Big money, big smiles, the kind of 
 moment that made the NYSE the Big Board. 

 The day&apos;s closing ceremonies told a different tale: 
 The head of Sybase, in honor of a golf tournament it sponsored, rang the 
 bell to end the day&apos;s trading. The firm, having been taken over by a 
 European company, is no longer listed on the Big Board. 

 The steady decline in the number of stocks listed 
 in the U.S. finally reached the point this year where both of the nation&apos;s 
 big stock exchanges took dramatic actionNYSE Euronext agreeing to a foreign 
 takeover, and then Nasdaq OMX Group trying unsuccessfully to bust that up 
 and take over the NYSE itself. 

 A combination of mergers, fewer U.S. IPOs, lower 
 listing costs abroad and a shift in how investors and stockbrokers do their 
 jobs has driven down the number of U.S. stock listings by a startling 43% 
 since the peak in 1997all during a period when the number of listings 
 outside the U.S. has more than doubled. 

 The result is some 3,800 fewer companies trade on 
 the U.S. exchanges today than in 1997, according to consulting firm Capital 
 Markets Advisory Partners. Abroad, there are nearly eight times as many 
 listings as in the U.S., with Hong Kong, China and India among the leading 
 venues. 

 &quot;We&apos;re losing the ecosystem that has helped buoy 
 the U.S. economy over decades,&quot;said Kate Mitchell, co-founder of Scale 
 Venture Partners, a Silicon Valley venture-capital firm. 

 The U.S. exchanges aren&apos;t competitive for some 
 large global IPOs, according to Nasdaq Chief Executive Robert Greifeld.&quot;You 
 see companies such as Prada who in the past would list here in the States,&quot;he said in April, blaming in part a&quot;fractured message coming out of the 
 U.S.&quot;as the two exchanges compete fiercely against each other. Italy&apos;s 
 Prada SpA plans to list in Hong Kong. More From Deal Journal 

 NYSE&apos;s Niederauer on the Decline Nasdaq&apos;s Greifeld 
 on Global Competition for Stock Listings 

 U.S. exchanges will certainly continue to attract 
 some big IPOs. U.S. exchanges remain a draw for companies in industries such 
 as social media, where U.S. investors are willing to pay a high price 
 because they see a burgeoning profit opportunity. Looming in future years 
 are public offerings from companies like Facebook Inc., Groupon Inc. and 
 Twitter Inc. that are expected to be as splashy as LinkedIn&apos;s debut or more 
 so. 

 Large consumer-product companies with many of their 
 employees in the U.S. also tend to be more loyal to a U.S. stock listing. 
 And several smaller IPOs are on tap soon, such as Spirit Airlines and 
 Freescale Semiconductor Holdings. 

 But NYSE Euronext CEO Duncan Niederauer has 
 acknowledged that the heyday of U.S. exchanges in listing newly public 
 companies is long gone. It is one reason he has fought for the deal to be 
 acquired by Deutsche Brse AG, he said in an interview last month. 

 NYSE executives say that being more global will 
 make them more attractive for emerging-market companies looking to list 
 their stocks somewhere in addition to their home markets, and also will 
 position the NYSE to be a better partner for exchanges in emerging economies 
 that want a joint venture or merger. 

 &quot;The capital markets are global just like every 
 other industry,&quot;Mr. Niederauer said.&quot;No matter what happens in the U.S., 
 there are 5,000 more public companies in China&quot;coming to the market in the 
 next 10 to 15 years. Mr. Niederauer is expected to be the head of the 
 combined NYSE-Deutsche Brse if the deal is approved by shareholders and 
 regulators. U.S. antitrust officials blocked Nasdaq&apos;s bid for the NYSE this 
 month. 

 One of the leading reasons for U.S. exchanges&apos; 
 difficulty in gaining more listings is a prolonged slump in U.S. initial 
 public offerings. The annual supply of U.S. IPOs since 2000 has averaged 
 just 156, down 71% from the pace in the 1990s, according to Capital Markets 
 Advisory. 

 Some U.S. start-ups that in the past might have 
 turned to a U.S. exchange when they needed capital now list abroad, where 
 fees are lower and they don&apos;t face costs such as complying with the 
 Sarbanes-Oxley corporate-governance law. 

 Other closely held companies get capital by 
 borrowing, rather than going public, amid today&apos;s historically low interest 
 rates. 

 And many more private companies now simply sell 
 themselves to a larger company. In technology, especially, cash-rich 
 behemoths like Google Inc. and Intel Corp. are on the prowl, making offers 
 that start-ups and entrepreneurs find hard to resist. 

 Skype Technologies SA filed for an IPO last August 
 and was headed for a listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market, but this month the 
 Internet phone company instead decided to sell itself to Microsoft Corp. for 
 $8.5 billion. 

 A Bay Area technology company called BigFix Inc. 
 worked on an IPO for nearly three years and had even selected a Nasdaq 
 ticker symbol. But amid a choppy stock market last summer, plus an earlier 
 hiccup in the company&apos;s growth rate, it dropped the plan and accepted a 
 buyout offer from International Business Machines Corp.

&quot; Updating A Security Program ,&quot;by Jerry Trites, IS Assurance , 
June 11, 2011 ---
 http://uwcisa-assurance.blogspot.com/ 
 
 Companies that have a security policy (don&apos;t all of 
 them?) need to update it regularly. This has been a basic precept of good 
 security. But in modern times, it still is not always done and the times 
 point even more than ever to the need for it. 

 Ernst&amp;Young has released a document called&quot;Information Security in a Borderless World&quot;in which it points out, based 
 on a survey, that many companies feel their security risk has increased. The 
 reasons relate to the increasing incidence of global attacks, the increase 
 in cloud computing and the use of mobile devices. On the latter, the study 
 points out that banning mobile devices will actually increase security, 
 contrary to the instincts of some companies.

Win Some and Lose Some: Some Good News for Ernst&amp;Young
&quot; High Court Denies Suit Against E&amp;Y Over Time-AOL Deal ,&quot;by Samuel 
Howard, Law360.com , June 13, 2011 ---
 http://www.law360.com/topnews/articles/250918/high-court-denies-suit-against-e-y-over-time-aol-deal 
Thank you Caleb Newquist for the heads up!
 
 The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear 
 an appeal brought by an AOL Inc. investor alleging that Ernst&amp;Young LLP 
 approved tainted financial statements related to Time Warner Inc.&apos;s merger 
 with AOL. 

 In rejecting the petition for certiorari, the high 
 court dashed AOL investor Dominic Amorosa and co-petitioner attorney 
 Christopher Grays claims that the Second Circuit failed to properly apply 
 the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 when it dismissed 
 the fraud suit in February. 

 The decision brings an end to 2003 suit claiming 
 that Ernst&amp;Young, the independent auditor for AOL, Time Warner and the 
 merged company, engaged in fraud and abetted the companies&apos; fraud when it 
 issued audited financial statements approving the companies&apos; allegedly 
 faulty accounting. 

 &quot;My client and I believe that the certiorari 
 petition raised significant and unsettled questions of law concerning an 
 &apos;opt-out&apos; securities plaintiffs right to pursue individual claims under the 
 Securities Exchange Act and state law,&quot;petitioner Christopher Gray said.&quot;While we are disappointed with the denial of certioriari, obviously not 
 every case can be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court on the merits and we look 
 forward to moving on to other matters.&quot; 

 The Second Circuit found that Amorosa had failed to 
 state a claim for loss causation because none of the events he identified as 
 corrective disclosures addressed AOLs accounting practices or in any way 
 implicated Ernst&amp;Youngs June 1999 audit opinion. 

 The petitioners argued that the high court 
 previously established that a corrective disclosure explicitly reflecting 
 the alleged false statement is not required state such a claim. 

 Amorosa and Gray also challenged the Second 
 Circuit&apos;s finding in its Feb. 2 dismissal that SLUSA preempted Amorosa&apos;s 
 state law claims. 

 SLUSA defines cases that are to be considered 
 preempted as covered class actions cases that seek damages for more than 
 50 people and that are joined, consolidated or otherwise proceed as a single 
 action but it does not preempt state law claims in individual securities 
 lawsuits like Amorosa&apos;s, the petitioners argued.

 The sportswear retailer values both commodities for 2010 to be in the region of 94.4m (81.9m) .


 Trucost worked on collating the data with PwC organising 
and reporting the findings as well as valuing the commodities. The Puma board was hoping to complete the environmental P&amp;L 
alongside its annual report however, it missed the deadline and has released the 
information as a standalone statement. In future the annual report will contain 
the environmental information as part of its financial statements.

 http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/Seven_things_CEOs_boards_should_ask_about_climate_reporting/$FILE/Seven_things_CEOs_boards_should_ask_about_climate_reporting.pdf 
 
 1. Who issues sustainability reports? 

 More than 3,000 companies worldwide, including more 
 than two-thirds of the Fortune Global 500. 

 2. Why report on sustainability if you don&apos;t 
 have to? 

 Increasingly, external stakeholders such as 
 institutional investors expect it. Reporting can also bring operational 
 improvements, strengthen compliance, and enhance your corporate reputation. 

 3. What information should a sustainability 
 report contain? 

 Reports should contain key performance indicators 
 relevant to the reporters industry. Four principles for deciding what to 
 include are materiality, stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability context, 
 and completeness. 

 4. What governance, systems and processes are 
 needed to report on sustainability? 

 Governance requires a high-level mandate and clear 
 reporting lines. Also needed: robust systems and processes that help 
 companies collect, store and analyze sustainability information. 

  5. Do sustainability reports have to be 
 audited? 

 Not yet. But they are being more closely monitored 
 than ever before. As this trend continues, users of sustainability 
 information will come to expect that the information has been validated by a 
 reliable third party. 

 6. What are the challenges and risks of 
 reporting? 

 Sustainability reporting presents many challenges, 
 including data consistency, striking a balance between positive and negative 
 information, continually improving performance and keeping reports readable 
 and concise. 

 7. How can companies get the most value out of 
 sustainability reporting? 

 Sustainability reports should be mandatory reading 
 for all employees, and can be a valuable tool for communicating with 
 external audiences as well. Setting targets in the form of KPIs also forces 
 the organization to meet publicly stated goals, which makes reporting an 
 accountability tool.

&quot;Word Power: A New Approach for Content Analysis&quot;
by Narasimhan Jegadeesh (Emory University - Department of Finance) and Andrew Di Wu (University of Pennsylvania - The Wharton School)
SSRN, April 2011
 http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1841786 
 
 ABSTRACT:
We present a new approach in financial content analysis to determine the 
 strength of various words in conveying positive or negative tone. We apply 
 our approach to quantify the tone of 10-K filings and find a significant 
 relation between document tone and market reaction for both negative and 
 positive words. Previous research has not been successful using positive 
 words to quantify tone. We find that our measure of positive and negative 
 tone is significantly related to filing period returns after controlling for 
 factors such as earning announcement date return and accruals, while the 
 earlier approaches in the literature are not. In addition, we find that the 
 appropriate choice of term weighting in content analysis at least as 
 important, and perhaps more important, than a complete and accurate 
 compilation of the word list. We find that the market underreacts to the 
 tone of 10-Ks, and this underreaction is corrected over the next two weeks. 
 
 Teaching Case on Fair Value Accounting Standards 

From The Wall Street Journal Accounting Review on May 20, 2011
 &quot;Fair Value&quot;Accounting Guidelines Tweaked 
 by: Michael Rapoport 
May 14, 2011
 Click here to view the full article on WSJ.com 
  
 TOPICS:  Advanced 
 Financial Accounting, Fair Value Accounting, Fair-Value Accounting Rules, 
 International Accounting, International Accounting Standards Board, 
 Valuations

 SUMMARY:  In furthering 
 their convergence effort, the FASB and IASB are changing promulgated 
 standards to provide a more consistent definition of fair value. As 
 described in the article, most of the specific changes are relatively minor 
 but are designed to achieve improvements in convergence.&quot;Perhaps the most 
 significant changes [result in requirements for companies to] disclose more 
 about the processes and assumptions they use in their level 3 valuations.&quot;Changes also require disclosure of any movements of securities between 
 Levels 1 and 2 of assets subject to fair value measurements.

 CLASSROOM APPLICATION:  The 
 article is useful to introduce the topics of convergence and/or fair value 
 measurement in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. 
 Instructors wishing to direct their students to investigate the Accounting 
 Standards Update (ASU) in the U.S. and the promulgated IFRS 13 may wish to 
 delete the remainder of this paragraph from student assignments. The 
 Accounting Standards Update on which this article is based is No. 2011104, 
 Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value 
 Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs. The 
 international authoritative guidance is IFRS 13, Fair Value Measurement.

 QUESTIONS:  
1. ( Advanced ) Describe the process of convergence of U.S. and 
 international accounting standards. What factors are driving this 
 convergence effort?

2. ( Introductory ) How significant were the changes to U.S. GAAP 
 discussed in this article? How significant were the changes to IFRS? Explain 
 any difference in your answers between the two.

3. ( Advanced ) What is fair value? Why must promulgated accounting 
 standards include a definition of this concept?

4. ( Advanced ) How is fair value measured under U.S.GAAP and IFRS?

5. ( Advanced ) What are the three levels of measuring fair value 
 under U.S.GAAP and IFRS? What new disclosures must be made in U.S. GAAP 
 reporting about assets measured at fair value? Identify your source for this 
 information. Explain what benefits you think will be provided by these 
 disclosures

6. ( Advanced ) When is this new standard to be applied by firms 
 reporting under IFRS? How will this accounting change be handled? Identify 
 your source for this information.

&quot;&quot;Fair Value&quot;Accounting Guidelines Tweaked.&quot;by: Michael Rapoport , The 
Wall Street Journal, May 14, 2011 ---

 Accounting rule makers tweaked their guidelines for 
 valuing assets based on market prices, a move that will bring U.S. and 
 international accounting rules closer together and will require companies to 
 disclose more about how they value their most exotic assets. 

 The changes adopted by the Financial Accounting 
 Standards Board and the International Accounting Standards Board will 
 provide a more consistent definition of&quot;fair value,&quot;which is the market 
 value or the closest approximation of it. Though most of the specific 
 changes are relatively minor and won&apos;t affect the core aspects of how 
 companies calculate fair value, the move better aligns U.S. and global 
 accounting rules on asset valuation. 

 Perhaps the most significant changes affect 
 companies&apos; disclosures about their&quot;Level 3&quot;assets, which are the risky, 
 illiquid securities valued using a company&apos;s own estimates and models rather 
 than market prices. Companies will have to disclose more about the processes 
 and assumptions they use in their Level 3 valuations. They will also have to 
 discuss what might happen to the company&apos;s valuations if the factors they 
 are using were to change. 

 Companies will have to disclose any movements of 
 securities between the other two classes of fair-value assets: Level 1, 
 those valued strictly using market prices, and Level 2, those for which a 
 blend of market prices and a company&apos;s own models are used. 

 The fair-value changes are part of the rule makers&apos;&quot;convergence&quot;project, their attempt to bring U.S. and international rules 
 closer together in an effort to standardize the accounting rules used 
 world-wide. The Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to vote later 
 this year on whether U.S. companies should switch to using international 
 rules altogether. 

 Most companies will adopt the fair-value 
 measurement changes in early 2012.

Jensen Comment
This article, perhaps appropriately, does not go into the ins and outs of 
choosing a major upon arrival at a college or university. With a few exceptions, 
this is perhaps a good idea except in certain majors where there prerequisite 
first-year courses are essential such as in engineering and pre-med. For 
accounting, the prerequisite first courses can usually be delayed until the 
sophomore year. But the above article really does not deal with choosing a major 
early on before students learn a lot about education and careers during their 
first year on campus. Much of what they learn comes from informal interactions 
with students who are in their second, third, fourth, and higher levels of 
study. I think it&apos;s a mistake for general curriculum teachers to try to sell 
students on particular types of majors or particular types of politics. Let 
students sort these things out for themselves as they advance through the first 
and even the second years of study.

This article does talk about debt loads. I personally think that students in 
the first term of college should learn about personal finance, tax issues, and 
debt risk since many of them will make horrible mistakes in college and after 
college.

&quot; The Risks of Quantification ,&quot;by William Byers, Harvard Business 
Review Blog , May 18, 2011 --- Click Here  
 http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/05/the_risks_of_quantification.html?referral=00563&amp;cm_mmc=email-_-newsletter-_-daily_alert-_-alert_date&amp;utm_source=newsletter_daily_alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=alert_date 
 
 Quantification describing reality with numbers 
 is a trend that seems only to be accelerating. From digital technology to 
 business and financial models, we interact with the world by means of 
 quantification. 

 While we all interact with the world through 
 more-or-less inflexible models, mathematics contributes to this lack of 
 flexibility because it is seemingly precise and objective. Even though 
 mathematical models can be very complex, you can use them without 
 understanding them very well. A trader need not really understand the financial engineering models that he may use 
 on daily basis . This uncritical acceptance amounts 
 to the assumption that reality is identical to our rational reconstruction 
 of reality for example, that the economy or the stock market is captured 
 by our latest model.

Hitting the bottom line is certainly easier when you know with precision 
 what that bottom line is. Numbers give you this precision, making you feel 
 more secure about where you are going higher revenues, lower costs. 
 Defining the risk of an unlikely event may make us feel like we&apos;ve dealt 
 with the threat. This is part of the contribution of the &quot; quants &quot; on Wall Street, people with doctorates in math and 
 physics. They bring with them a culture of quantification that they carry 
 over from the mathematical and physical sciences and then apply to economic 
 and financial situations. The complex mathematical models that they use may 
 be brilliant, but the better they are the greater their potential is to 
 misrepresent the actual, human situation that they are looking at. Because 
 they give people like CEOs and politicians the idea that everything is 
 understood and under control, these models often have the perverse effect of 
 generating new, unanticipated problems. 

 What we misunderstand is that introducing 
 mathematics and quantification into any situation subtly changes that 
 situation and this needs to be taken into account. We are attached to our 
 analytic and computational tools and have become blind to their limitations. 

 Consider the following four issues: 

 Statistical models are all based on 
 the notion of randomness, but no one can really understand randomness. Many people use the word random without realizing that random means what 
 it says randomness cannot be predicted or controlled. A model of 
 randomness is no longer true randomness. Because they are logically consistent, 
 mathematical models screen out ambiguity. Ambiguity is real, 
 but business and financial models have little to no room for it. 
 Ambiguity arises whenever there are two (or more) courses of action that 
 are equally important yet conflict with one another. For example, we 
 need nuclear reactors to solve some of our energy needs and to mitigate 
 global warming. At the same time, nuclear power, as we see from Japan, 
 comes with huge downsides. This same ambiguity is at the heart of most 
 policy and business decisions, but mathematical models have taken out 
 the ambiguity. Putting a situation into numbers 
 enforces the belief that things are linear and events are necessarily 
 comparable since for any two numbers one is larger and one is 
 smaller. Suppose that you modeled teaching on a scale that goes from 1 
 to 10. You would conclude that a teacher with a score of 8.3 was better 
 than one with 6.8, but this would inevitably ignore all kinds of 
 qualitative factors. Models simplify things by ignoring certain aspects 
 of the situation, but we can never be sure which factors should be 
 included and which should be omitted. Any system that involves human 
 behavior, like economics or finance, is inherently self-referential. We are all participants in, not just observers of, these systems. 
 Self-referential systems are notoriously difficult to control and 
 predict because they are often chaotic, not deterministic. Most 
 mathematical models do not take this element of self-reference seriously 
 and anyhow chaotic systems, by definition, cannot be predicted. 

 How do we make use of the realization that 
 uncertainty is inevitable and our best models have blind spots? Simple 
 acknowledgment that uncertainty is unavoidable already changes things in a 
 fundamental way. However, this acknowledgment must be authentic and must 
 overcome our psychological aversion to uncertainty. Uncertainty tends to 
 make situations more complex and, therefore, projects more costly another 
 reason why it tends to be ignored or downplayed.

&quot; Can Value Be Brought Back to the Auditor&apos;s Report? A Tale of Two Systems ,&quot;by Jim Peterson, re:Balance , May 19, 2011 ---
 http://www.jamesrpeterson.com/home/2011/05/can-value-be-brought-back-to-the-auditors-report-a-tale-of-two-systems.html 
 
 Is it the best of times, in the struggle to 
 re-introduce value into the traditional auditors report or the worst of 
 times? The age of wisdom or the age of foolishness? 

 Latest to join the Dickensian-length of characters 
 is the International Auditing and Assurance Board, which on May 16 released 
 its consultation paper, Enhancing the Value of Auditor Reporting: 
 Exploring Options for Change ( here ).

 Compared to the others, whom to list takes up three 
 full pages of its appendix, the IAASB brings the essential combination of 
 intelligence and technical skills. Well it should, charged with the 
 promulgation of international standards on auditing (ISAs), thus conversant 
 with such abstruse but centrally relevant topics as the auditors 
 responsibility for published information other than financial statements 
 (ISA 720), and use of emphasis of matter and other paragraphs in an 
 auditors report (ISA 706).  

 Among the most prominent of those heard from, and 
 least likely to offer substantive contributions, is the United Kingdoms 
 upper legislative chamber, whose Economic Affairs Committee has this spring 
 gotten its lordly knickers in a twist over the bogus suggestion of a malign 
 influence of international accounting standards on the crisis-era reporting 
 of the British banks ( here ), and also prodded the UKs Office of Fair Trading into 
 an inquiry as to the market dominance of the Big Four ( here ) yet another tedious exercise destined to yield

 Deferrals

 SUMMARY:  &quot;Sony Corp. 
 warned it expects to post an annual loss of $3.2 billion, reversing a 
 previous prediction of a return to profitability as the Japanese electronics 
 giant struggles to recover from the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. Sony 
 said it would take a $4.4 billion write-off on a certain portion of deferred 
 tax assets in Japan, in what would be the company&apos;s third straight year of 
 red ink....Sony said that under U.S. accounting standards, a third straight 
 year of losses from the part of the company&apos;s operations based in Japan-due 
 partly to the yen&apos;s strength-raised questions over the validity of its 
 deferred tax assets in Japan.&quot;

 CLASSROOM APPLICATION:  The 
 article is excellent for class use to cover deferred tax asset valuation 
 allowances but it also touches on supply chain issues. The article is as 
 well useful to discuss management forecasts (guidance), interim and annual 
 reporting practices in Japan, foreign private issuers&apos; filings on Form 20-F, 
 and Sony&apos;s use of U.S. GAAP. One question also asks the students to consider 
 whether the effects of the Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami should be 
 expected to be treated as extraordinary under U.S. GAAP. By the time 
 students answer this last question, the company should have made its filing 
 on Form 20-F which will allow for verification of the assessment.

 QUESTIONS:  
1. ( Introductory ) Summarize your understanding of the announcement 
 that Sony has made and that is reported in this article. For what time 
 period is the company reporting? In your answer, comment on the usual fiscal 
 year-end date for Japanese companies.

2. ( Introductory ) What is a deferred tax asset? What is a deferred 
 tax asset valuation allowance?

3. ( Introductory ) For what reasons did Sony Corp. record deferred 
 tax assets? Why must the company now write them down by establishing 
 valuation allowances? In what reporting period will the company show the 
 charge for this write down as a deduction in determining net income?

4. ( Advanced ) Why does this deferred tax asset write-down become an&quot;admission that the March disaster has shattered its [Sony&apos;s] expectations 
 for a robust current fiscal year&quot;?

5. ( Advanced ) Access the Filing on Form 6-K which describes the 
 investor briefing regarding the revision of management&apos;s forecast of 
 consolidated results that is reported on in thie article. The filing is 
 available at http://www.sec.gov/Archives/ edgar/data/313838/ 000115752311003320/a6733820. htm Explain your understanding of the importance of the taxable income shown by&quot;Sony Corporation as an unconsolidated unit and its consolidated tax filing 
 group companies in Japan&quot;to the loss that will be reported by Sony.

6. ( Advanced ) Why does Sony focus on the impact of the Japanese 
 taxable income on accounting under U.S. GAAP? In your answer, comment on the 
 financial reporting requirements for companies traded on U.S. stock 
 exchanges.

7. ( Introductory ) What was the impact of the&quot;Great East Japan 
 Earthquake&quot;on sales and operating profits in the last fiscal year? In the 
 current year?

8. ( Advanced ) Do you think that the impact of the earthquake and 
 tsunami described above will be give extraordinary item treatment under U.S. 
 GAAP? Support your answer.

 Sony Corp. on Monday said it expects to post a $3.2 
 billion net loss for the just-ended fiscal year, blaming a $4.4 billion 
 write-off on a certain portion of deferred tax assets in Japan, in what 
 would be the company&apos;s third straight year of red ink. 

 The write-off is an admission from the 
 entertainment and electronics conglomerate that the March 11 earthquake and 
 tsunami has shattered its expectations for a robust current fiscal year. 
 While the disaster&apos;s direct impact on the company&apos;s operating profit wasn&apos;t 
 large, the post-quake outlook put Sony in a position where it had to set 
 aside reserves of 360 billion yen on certain deferred tax assets in its 
 fiscal fourth quarter. 

 Sony lowered its net outlook for the fiscal year 
 that ended in March to a loss of 260 billion yen from the profit of 70 
 billion yen it forecast in February. In the previous fiscal year, the 
 company racked up a loss of 40.8 billion yen. 

 The company, however, said it predicts a return to 
 profitability for the current business year through March 2012. 

 Sony said that under U.S. accounting standards, a 
 third straight year of losses from the part of the company&apos;s operations 
 based in Japandue partly to the yen&apos;s strengthraised questions over the 
 validity of its deferred tax assets in Japan. But until March, Sony saw no 
 need to write off the assets. 

 &quot;Until the quake hit, we had been counting on a 
 considerable recovery in earnings,&quot;in the current fiscal year, Sony Chief 
 Financial Office Masaru Kato said at a news briefing. 

 But conditions have changed drastically since the 
 earthquake and tsunami. In the wake of the disaster, Sony temporarily shut 
 10 plants in and around the quake-hit region. All but one of those plants 
 have since resumed operations, at least partially. 

 Sony said the disaster siphoned off 22 billion yen 
 from the company&apos;s sales and 17 billion yen from its operating profit in the 
 just-ended business year. 

 The company left its forecast for operating profit 
 unchanged at 200 billion yen, but lowered its revenue outlook to 7.18 
 trillion yen from 7.2 trillion yen. 

 Sony didn&apos;t disclose what it expects for the fiscal 
 fourth quarter, but according to a Dow Jones Newswires calculation, it is 
 estimated to have posted a net loss of 389.2 billion yen for the 
 January-March quarter. That compares with a loss of 56.57 billion yen a year 
 earlier. 

 Like other Japanese auto and electronics makers, 
 Sony continues to face uncertainties because its recovery prospects are 
 partially dependent on parts and materials suppliers, many of which have 
 also been affected by the quake. 

 &quot;The supply-chain situation should recover 
 significantly in the second half of this fiscal year,&quot;Mr. Kato said. 

 In the current fiscal year, Sony estimates that the 
 quake is likely to have a negative impact of about 440 billion yen on sales 
 and 150 billion yen on operating profit, mainly through supply-chain 
 disruptions. 

 Despite the quake&apos;s expected impact, Sony said it 
 expects that its revenue will increase this fiscal year, and that its 
 operating profit will be about the same as the previous fiscal year.

 To the Point: A 
U-turn on straight-line lease expense 

Today, the FASB and the IASB reversed course on their tentative decision to 
introduce lease classification and straight-line rent expense into their new 
accounting model for lessees. The Boards have decided to go back to their 
exposure draft approach of requiring lessees to recognize interest expense using 
the interest method and separately amortize the right-of-use asset (generally on 
a straight-line basis). This approach accelerates lease expense for today&apos;s 
operating leases. Our To the

 TOPICS:  Mergers 
 and Acquisitions

 SUMMARY:  &quot;Microsoft made 
 an unsolicited bid for the Internet company last month and clinched its deal 
 late Monday....&quot;The price, including taking responsibility for Skype&apos;s 
 outstanding debt, totals $8.4 billion.

 CLASSROOM APPLICATION:  The 
 article is useful for introducing business combinations but also includes 
 discussion of EBITDA and operating profit versus net income as well as the 
 fact that the cash Microsoft will use otherwise might stay overseas and be 
 unavailable for investment. Microsoft has most of its huge cash balance held 
 in overseas locations and would be subject to repatriated earnings tax in 
 order to get access to it.

 QUESTIONS:  
1. ( Introductory ) What was the Microsoft stock price reaction to 
 this announcement that it will buy Skype?

2. ( Introductory ) What are two questions about the value of this 
 investment to Microsoft? In your answer, address the question of how 
 Microsoft can justify a purchase price of $8.5 billion when the company is 
 not making a profit.

3. ( Advanced ) Skype is&quot;EBITDA positive but doesn&apos;t have net 
 income,&quot;says Nick Wingfield, a WSJ Reporter, on the related video. What 
 does this statement mean?

4. ( Advanced ) Why might Skype have operating profit but not net 
 income? In your answer, define these two financial terms.

5. ( Advanced ) Skype&apos;s previous owner, EBay Inc.,&quot;...bought Skype 
 in 2005 for around $3.1 billion but took a $1.4 billion charge for the 
 transaction in 2007 after it failed to produce hoped-for synergies.&quot;What 
 type of a write down do you think this was? Why does this write down have 
 implications for the current Microsoft purchase?

6. ( Introductory ) Where is the cash that Microsoft will use to make 
 this purchase? Why is the cash not available to Microsoft in the U.S.? How 
 might the tax implication of using that cash impact the price Microsoft 
 would be willing to pay for Skype?

&quot; Microsoft Dials Up Change ,&quot;by: Nick Wingfield, The Wall Street

 Microsoft Corp. racked up a whopping $8.5 billion 
 phone bill to buy Skype SARL even though there were no signs of other 
 serious bidders for the provider of free online video and voice chats, as 
 the software giant moved aggressively to ramp up its growth. 

 Microsoft made an unsolicited bid for the Internet 
 company last month and clinched its deal late Monday, nixing a planned Skype 
 public offering and short-circuiting any talks with competitors such as 
 Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. 

 Steve Ballmer, Microsoft&apos;s chief executive, 
 defended the price in an interview, saying the dealthe biggest in his 
 company&apos;s 36-year historywill let Microsoft&quot;be more ambitious, do more 
 things.&quot; 

 While Facebook, Google and Cisco Systems Inc. had 
 shown interest in Skype, Microsoft was by far the most determined buyer, 
 people familiar with the matter said. 

 The price tagthree times what Skype fetched 18 
 months agois a sign of just how hungry Microsoft is for growth 
 opportunitiesespecially in the mobile-phone and Internet markets. Those 
 missed opportunities are increasingly worrisome to Microsoft investors as 
 traditional profit engines, like its Windows software, are showing signs of 
 slowing. 

 The Skype deal is a gamble by Mr. Ballmer that he 
 can succeed where those that have gone before him have failed: using the 
 phone-and-video-calling service to make money. Microsoft&apos;s ambitious goal is 
 to integrate Skype into everything from its Xbox videogame console to its 
 Office software suite for businesses. 

 Microsoft also hopes Skype can jump-start its 
 effort to turn around its fortunes in the mobile-phone market, an area where 
 it has lagged far behind Apple Inc. and Google. Phones running Microsoft 
 software were just 7.5% of the smartphone market last quarter, according to 
 Comscore Inc. 

 he Skype purchase comes as the technology 
 industry&apos;s momentum is increasingly being fueled by consumers, with the 
 explosive rise of social network Facebook, now at more than 600 million 
 global members, and devices such as Apple&apos;s iPad and iPhone reshaping the 
 cellphone and computer markets. 

 That has pushed many big tech companies that had 
 largely relied on businesses for growthfrom Dell Inc. to Ciscoto seek ways 
 into consumer technologies. 

 Some of those moves haven&apos;t paid off, however. 
 Cisco, for example, recently shut down the division that made its Flip video 
 cameras, just two years after acquiring the business. 

 Whether Microsoft can make a Skype acquisition 
 workespecially at such a rich priceis a question mark. EBay Inc. bought 
 Skype in 2005 for around $3.1 billion but took a $1.4 billion charge for the 
 transaction in 2007 after it failed to produce hoped-for synergies. 

 EBay decided to shed the business, and sold a 70% 
 stake in Skype to a group of investors led by private-equity firm Silver 
 Lake Partners about 18 months ago. The deal valued all of Skype at a $2.75 
 billion. 

 Mr. Ballmer said Microsoft and Skype have far more 
 in common than Skype had with eBay since both companies are in the&quot;communications business.&quot;He said communications technologies have been&quot;the backbone&quot;of Microsoft&apos;s growth in recent years and that Skype has&quot;built a real business,&quot;with more than $860 million in 2010 revenue. 

 &quot;I think our case for why to bring this together 
 comes from a very different place,&quot;he said. 

 Overall, Skype has more than 170 million active 
 users and 207 billion minutes of voice and video conservations flowing 
 through its service. But despite its widespread use, it has been slow to 
 convert users into paying customers and generate meaningful profits. It had 
 a net loss of $7 million last year.

&quot; Rating Agencies Face Crackdown ,&quot;by Ben Protess, The New York 
Times , May 18, 2011 ---
 http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/05/18/rating-agencies-face-crackdown/ 
 
 Securities regulators are out to tame the credit 
 rating agencies, crucial Wall Street players at the center of the financial 
 crisis. 

 The Securities and Exchange Commission proposed 
 sweeping new rules on Wednesday to overhaul the rating business 
 regulations that would force tougher internal controls, potentially curb 
 conflicts of interest and even mandate that the agencies periodically test 
 the competence of their employees. 

 These rules are intended to help investors and 
 other users of credit ratings better understand and assess the ratings, 
 Mary L. Schapiro, chairwoman of the S.E.C., said at a public meeting on 
 Wednesday. It is a massive proposal, she said of the plan, which spans 
 more than 500 pages. 

 The S.E.C.s five commissioners unanimously agreed 
 to advance the proposals, which are now open for public comment for 60 days. 

 The agencys Republican commissioners indicated, 
 however, that they would push for some changes. The proposals could be life 
 threatening to small rating agencies, Kathleen L. Casey, a Republican 
 commissioner, said at the public meeting. 

 A rating agency, for instance, would have to take 
 on the costs of periodically administering performance exams that would 
 test its credit analysts on the credit rating procedures and methodologies 
 it uses, according to a summary of the proposal. 

 The proposals stem from the Dodd-Frank Act, the 
 financial overhaul law enacted last year. The S.E.C. has already proposed 
 new policies under Dodd-Frank that would strip references to credit ratings 
 from rules that govern securities offerings. 

 The rating agencies in recent years became a target 
 in Washington, as regulators and lawmakers blamed them for feeding the 
 mortgage bubble by awarding top grades to bonds backed by subprime 
 mortgages. The investments later soured, driving the economy to the brink. 

 A Congressional panel that chronicled the crisis 
 called the largest rating agencies Standard&amp;Poors, Moodys Investors 
 Service and Fitch Ratings essential cogs in the wheel of financial 
 destruction. 

 The problems, critics say, stem from an inherent 
 conflict of interest plaguing the rating agencies business model. 

 Banks and corporations that issue debt must pay the 
 rating agencies to assign their bonds a letter grade. In the lead-up to the 
 crisis, the rating agencies had a heavy hand in the mortgage bond business, 
 as they advised big banks how to earn a top triple-A grade. In a quest for 
 profits, the critics say, the agencies compromised the integrity of their 
 ratings. 

 The S.E.C.s proposal intends to mitigate some of 
 those conflicts, which have long hurt the industrys reputation. 

 The plan would prohibit analysts from issuing a 
 rating if they also marketed their rating agencys products or services. 
 Small rating agencies can apply for an exemption from this rule. 

 The proposal also takes aim at the revolving door 
 between the rating agencies and Wall Street firms that seek the grades. 

 Under the plan, the rating agencies would have to 
 examine whether their former analysts awarded overly rosy ratings to a firm 
 that later hired that person. In such cases, the rating agencies would have 
 to promptly determine whether the credit rating must be revised. 

 Ms. Casey said that this proposal threatened to 
 cross the line into dictating the substance of credit ratings. I am 
 concerned.

 How to Get AAA Ratings on Junk Bonds 

 Pay cash under the table to credit rating agencies Promise a particular credit rating agency future multi-million 
 contracts for rating future issues of bonds Hire away top-level credit rating agency 
 employees with insider information and great networks inside the credit 
 rating agencies 

By now it is widely known that the big credit rating agencies (like Moody&apos;s, 
Standard&amp;Poor&apos;s, and Fitch) that rate bonds as AAA to BBB to Junk were 
unethically selling AAA ratings to CDO mortgage-sliced bonds that should&apos;ve been 
rated Junk. Up to now I thought the credit rating agencies were merely selling 
out for cash or to maintain&quot;goodwill&quot;with their best customers to giant Wall 
Street banks and investment banks like Lehman Bros., AIG., Merrill Lynch, Bear 
Stearns, Goldman Sachs, etc. ---
 http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/2008Bailout.htm#Sleaze 
But it turns out that the credit rating agencies were also in that&quot; hiring-away &quot;pipeline.

  Wall 
Street banks and nvestment banks were employing a questionable tactic used by 
large clients of auditing firms. It is common for large clients to hire away the 
lead auditors of their CPA auditing firms. This is a questionable practice, 
although the intent in most instances (we hope) is to obtain accounting experts 
rather than to influence the rigor of the audits themselves. The tactic is much 
more common and much more sinister when corporations hire away top-level 
government employees of regulating agencies like the FDA, FAA, FPC, EPA, etc. 
This is a tactic used by industry to gain more control and influence over its 
regulating agency. Current regulating government employees 
who get too tough on industry will, thereby, be cutting off their chances of 
getting future high compensation offers from the companies they now regulate . 

 The 
investigations of credit rating agencies by the New York Attorney General and 
current Senate hearings, however, are revealing that the hiring-away tactic was 
employed by Wall Street Banks for more sinister purposes in order to get AAA 
ratings on junk bonds. Top-level employees of the credit rating agencies were 
lured away with enormous salary offers if they could use their insider networks 
in the credit rating agencies so that higher credit ratings could be stamped on 
junk bonds.

 were, in some cases, riskier than ratings suggested, according to former

should not be dupes ,&quot; Reuters, May 13, 2010 ---
 http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE64C4W320100513 
 
 THE PROFIT INCENTIVE 

 In fact, rating agencies sometimes discouraged 
 analysts from asking too many questions, critics have said. 

 In testimony last month before a Senate 
 subcommittee, Eric Kolchinsky, a former Moody&apos;s ratings analyst, claimed 
 that he was fired by the rating agency for being too harsh on a series of 
 deals and costing the company market share. 

 Rating agencies spent too much time looking for 
 profit and market share, instead of monitoring credit quality, said David 
 Reiss, a professor at Brooklyn Law School who has done extensive work on 
 subprime mortgage lending. 

 &quot;It was incestuous -- banks and rating agencies had 
 a mutual profit motive, and if the agency didn&apos;t go along with a bank, it 
 would be punished.&quot; 

 The Senate amendment passed on Thursday aims to 
 prevent that dynamic in the future, by having a government clearinghouse 
 that assigns issuers to rating agencies instead of allowing issuers to 
 choose which agencies to work with. 

 For investigators to portray rating agencies as 
 victims is&quot;far fetched,&quot;and what needs to be fixed runs deeper than banks 
 fooling ratings analysts, said Daniel Alpert, a banker at Westwood Capital. 

 &quot;It&apos;s a structural problem,&quot;Alpert said.

Morgan: International Tax Law as a Ponzi Scheme 
 Ed Morgan (University of Toronto, Faculty of Law) 
 has posted International Tax Law as a Ponzi Scheme , 34 
 Suffolk Transnat&apos;l L. Rev. ___ (2011), on SSRN. Here is the abstract : 
 This paper explores the extent to which 
 international tax law is more than the sum of its parts. It does so by 
 examining three recent legal/policy decisions. The 2006 judgement of the 
 Tax Court of Canada in MIL Investments decided that a statutory 
 general anti-avoidance rule of interpretation does not operate to bar 
 the practice of treaty shopping for corporate residence; the 2008 
 judgement of the United States Tax Court in Jameison determined 
 that the alternative minimum tax credit limitation trumps the 
 Canada-United States tax treaty foreign tax credit as the last-in-time 
 enactment; and the Internationally Agreed Tax Standards issued by the 
 OECD seek to implement a coordinated international standard for tax 
 reporting. These decisions demonstrate that although tax treaty networks 
 and a centralized OECD structure have been put in place, the 
 interpretation and application of these instruments reflect much 
 international law thinking in that they invariably circle back to 
 unilateral state policy.

Are profit-seeking corporations hopeless sociopaths?
&quot; Business-School Leaders Debate Corporate Responsibility ,&quot;by Katherine 
Mangan, Chronicle of Higher Education , May 1, 2011 ---
 http://chronicle.com/article/Business-School-Leaders-Debate/127361/ 
 
 The nation&apos;s financial meltdown and the sweeping 
 regulatory overhaul it sparked are providing business schools with plenty of 
 sobering teaching material about ethics, corporate social responsibility, 
 and the unintended consequences of financial reform, according to 
 participants at the annual meeting here of AACSB International: the 
 Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. 

 The meeting, which wrapped up on Saturday, included 
 spirited discussions about the role that business schools play in society 
 and the lessons they should be passing on to the next generation of 
 corporate movers and shakers. 

 More than 1,300 business educators and leaders from 
 53 countries and territories attended the meeting of the association, which 
 accredits 620 institutions worldwide. 

 &quot;This isn&apos;t just a teachable moment about the 
 financial crisis,&quot;said Robert Glenn Hubbard, dean of Columbia Business 
 School and a former chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers 
 under President George W. Bush.&quot;It&apos;s a teachable moment about how you 
 connect the dots&quot;so another crisis doesn&apos;t occur. 

 In addition to offering courses in corporate 
 governance and ethics, business schools are struggling to educate students 
 about the financial-overhaul legislation, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform 
 and Consumer Protection Act (HR 4173), that was enacted last year. 

 Many of the business educators here were skeptical 
 about the value of the legislation, which mandated comprehensive regulation 
 of financial markets and greater openness about complex investments called 
 derivatives. 

 Franklin R. Edwards, director of the Center for the 
 Study of Futures Markets at Columbia Business School, called the legislation&quot;a hodgepodge of regulatory initiatives&quot;that puts regulators in charge, 
 despite their failure to protect consumers in the past. 

 &quot;If I had to grade it as a professor, I&apos;d be giving 
 it a D-plus,&quot;he said. Misgivings About Graduates&apos; Behavior 

 In another session, Ira A. Jackson, a visiting 
 scholar at the Legatum Center for Development and Entrepreneurship at the 
 Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said business schools should feel&quot;humbled&quot;by the role they may have played in the crisis. Their former 
 students were among the people selling&quot;grenade loans&quot;to their competitors, 
 hoping they would blow up on them, he said. 

 &quot;Those were our graduates. Why weren&apos;t they 
 figuring out how to help working-class people afford homes in a responsible 
 way?&quot;he said. 

 Arguing against him in the debate-style panel was 
 Aneel G. Karnani, an associate professor of strategy at the Ross School of 
 Business at the University of Michigan. Mr. Karnani explained why he 
 dismisses the idea that corporations should be socially responsible as&quot;useless&quot;and even&quot;dangerous.&quot; 

 Noting the slew of angry letters he received after 
 an essay he wrote appeared in The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Karnani said that 
 arguing against the idea that companies have a duty to act in the public 
 interest&quot;is kind of like coming out against motherhood and apple pie.&quot;Putting the Onus on Regulators 

 Mr. Karnani said business schools should stop 
 demonizing government and regulation and recognize that the fiscal crisis 
 was caused not by a lack of ethics but by a lack of regulation. Publicly 
 held businesses should just follow rules set by the government and not try 
 to solve the world&apos;s social problems if doing so cuts into their profits, he 
 argued. 

 He added that corporate social responsibility is&quot;fundamentally undemocratic&quot;because company officials decide what values 
 they are going to promote instead of letting the government and voters 
 decide. 

 Mr. Jackson countered that students are demanding 
 that business schools take a more proactive approach.

 Ernst&amp;Young 
 Technical Line: Hedge 
accounting - is convergence possible? 

April 30. 2011
The FASB and the IASB have not attempted to jointly address the differences in 
their proposed hedge accounting models. This week, the FASB began reviewing 
responses to questions it had asked constituents about the IASB hedging 
proposal. The FASB is expected to consider that input as it continues its 
deliberations on its own model. Meanwhile, the IASB has moved forward separately 
with its own redeliberations.

Our Technical Line publication compares and contrasts the two hedging proposals 
and explains how we believe some of the novel concepts the IASB model introduces 
would work. We also offer our thoughts on how certain aspects of the proposed 
IASB hedging model should be incorporated into the FASB version. 
Jensen Comment
There&apos;s an old saying when cable companies are bringing fiber to households:
&quot;The last mile costs more than all the other miles.&quot;

The FASB and IASB may well have delayed the most controversial issues in 
standards convergence to the&quot;last mile&quot;items in that convergence like 
convergence on hedge accounting standards. At the moment there are quite a few 
big differences such as hedge accounting for embedded derivatives (that was 
abandoned by the IASB) and hedge accounting for portfolios where hedged item 
risks within a portfolio differ from hedging contract risks. These are not small 
pebbles in the convergence stream.

 Jensen Comment
The IASB cannot seem to distinguish between simplified accounting rules and 
 ambiguity as if ambiguity and subjectivity equate to greater transparency.


The fact is that financial risk and hedging contracts have become 
 exceedingly complex. The IASB thinks they are so complex that auditors and 
 their clients should be allowed to report these contracts according to 
 judgment/judgement rather than bright lines. This is exactly like replacing 
 all the speed limit signs in school zones with signs that read&quot;Please Drive 
 Safely.&quot;


The best illustration of replacing&quot;standards&quot;with ambiguity arises is the 
 absurd new IFRS rules for assessing hedge effectiveness. If you want to find 
 illustrations of how identical contracts are accounted for differently by 
 auditors and their clients in financial statements, this is the best, but 
 certainly not the only, place to look.

Thanks Tom! 
 Accounting Doctoral Programs 

PQ = Professionally Qualified under AACSB standards
AQ = Academically Qualified under AACSB standards

May 3, 2011 message to Barry Rice from Bob Jensen
 
Hi Barry,

Faculty without doctoral degrees who meet the AACSB PQ standards are 
 still pretty much second class citizens and will find the tenure track 
 hurdles to eventual full professorship very difficult except in colleges 
 that pay poorly at all levels.

There are a number of alternatives for a CPA/CMA looking into AACSB AQ 
 alternatives in in accounting in North American universities:

The best alternative is to enter into a traditional accounting doctoral 
 program at an AACSB university. Virtually all of these in North America are 
 accountics doctoral programs requiring 4-6 years of full time onsite study 
 and research beyond the masters degree. The good news is that these programs 
 generally have free tuition, room, and board allowances. The bad news is 
 that students who have little interest in becoming mathematicians and 
 statisticians and social scientists need not apply --- http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/Theory01.htm#DoctoralPrograms  

As a second alternative Central Florida University has an onsite doctoral 
 program that is stronger in the accounting and lighter in the accountics. 
 Kennesaw State University has a three-year executive DBA program that has 
 quant-lite alternatives, but this is only available in accounting to older 
 executives who enter with PQ-accounting qualifications. It also costs nearly 
 $100,000 plus room and board even for Georgia residents. The DBA is also not 
 likely to get the graduate into a R1 research university tenure track.

As a third alternative there are now some online accounting doctoral 
 programs that are quant-lite and only take three years, but these diplomas 
 aren&apos;t worth the paper they&apos;re written on --- http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/Crossborder.htm#CommercialPrograms  Cappella University is a very good online university, but its online 
 accounting doctoral program is nothing more than a glorified online MBA 
 degree that has, to my knowledge, no known accounting researchers teaching 
 in the program. Capella will not reveal its doctoral program faculty to 
 prospective students. I don&apos;t think the North American academic job market 
 yet recognizes Capella-type and Nova-type doctorates except in universities 
 that would probably accept the graduates as PQ faculty without a doctorate.

As a fourth alternative there are some of the executive accounting 
 doctoral programs in Europe, especially England, that really don&apos;t count for 
 much in the North American job market.

As a fifth alternative, a student can get a three-year non-accounting PhD 
 degree from a quality doctoral program such as an economics or computer 
 science PhD from any of the 100+ top flagship state/provincial universities 
 in North America. Then if the student also has PQ credentials to teach in an 
 accounting program, the PhD graduate can enroll in an accounting part-time&quot;Bridge Program&quot;anointed by the AACSB --- http://www.aacsb.edu/conferences_seminars/seminars/bp.asp  

As a sixth alternative, a student can get a three-year law degree in 
 addition to getting PQ credentials in some areas where lawyers often get 
 into accounting program tenure tracks. The most common specialty for lawyers 
 is tax accounting. Some accounting departments also teach business law and 
 ethics using lawyers.

Hope this helps.

Bob Jensen

PS
Case Western has a very respected accounting history track in its PhD 
 program, but I&apos;m not certain how many of the accountics hurdles are relaxed 
 except at the dissertation stage.

 Dear Friend of the CAQ: 
 I am pleased to share with you the CAQs 
 newest publication, the In-Depth Guide to Public Company Auditing . 
 The booklet is designed for investors and 
 others interested in understanding the external audit process for public 
 companies and role the audit plays in our capital markets. 
 The In-Depth Guide to Public Company 
 Auditing provides more detail about the audit process than the 
 CAQs 2009 Guide to Public Company Auditing, which serves as an 
 introduction and overview of public company auditing. 
 The CAQs continuing dialogue with 
 individual investors indicates that many in the marketplace do not fully 
 understand the scope of the audit process and the responsibilities 
 placed on public company auditors. We hope the In-Depth Guide to 
 Public Company Auditing will help to bridge that information gap. 
 The new Guide also will inform 
 our future investor education activities. Last month, we launched the 
 For Investors section of our Web site, www.TheCAQ.org , 
 which provides information about auditing and links to financial 
 literacy resources. Additional investor education activities are planned 
 in the coming months. 
 The Guide can be accessed at http://www.thecaq.org/ publications/In-Depth_ GuidetoPublicCompanyAuditing. pdf . 
   
 A s 
 always, I welcome any feedback you may have about CAQ publications.

 Dear Bob --

With thanks for your posting about my thoughts on the Doty speech -- and a 
 couple words of further observation for your thoughts.

First on the PCAOB&apos;s track record to date, it is important I think not to 
 measure by inputs, but by results. No grown-up would argue in favor of the 
 the history of state-level and AICPA oversight as a satisfactory set of 
 bench-marks, but the absence of beneficial impact on the tumultuous events 
 of the last four years suggests that the question&quot;where were the 
 regulators?&quot;remains appropriate. Counting the number of reports issued on a 
 miniscule sample of the audits of public companies is a little like the 
 police commissioner who claims success for hiring a bunch of new cops, 
 without counting the actual impact on the crime statistics.

As for&quot;hitting the ground running,&quot;the agency record on the international 
 front itself is instructive -- the time and money wasted through the early 
 years of frustrated foreign-firm registration and inspection are abysmal. 
 Meanwhile although a blip on the government screen, the agency operates with 
 a budget (and a salary structure!) that are disproportionate and out of line 
 with its record.

(And, by the way, I accept that I am probably in a minority in my hostility 
 to the entire adventure in internal controls reporting -- where the eventual 
 cost to the profession for issuing those clean reports on companies whose 
 own opinions are being litigated even today has yet to be reckoned. Again, 
 the nuanced issue is not a matter of what&quot;has been done,&quot;but what the 
 results might have been had something else been done, including leaving the 
 post-Enron era to the cyclical cleansing that I think would have been 
 inevitable without the cost and disruption the SarBox imposed.)

While it may not always come across, I will assert a perspective different 
 from that of McKenna, Turner, Levitt and the other unremitting critics of 
 the profession, whose antagonism seems in my view to seek nothing less than 
 the collapse of the large-firm organizations: namely, that on a career&apos;s 
 worth of engagement with friends, partners and clients in the profession, I 
 try to promote the goal of achievable and sustainable delivery of assurance 
 value to the community of users. It is, unfortunately, necessary to be blunt 
 to the point of lack of diplomacy to say that leadership in all sectors has 
 -- following the basic DNA of each of the players -- been sadly lacking in 
 both vision and execution.

Well -- enough. Thanks again and as always I welcome the dialog.

Best regards -- 

 Jim

 Burglar Bars
  Hi Jim,

I agree to a point, but what I admire most about 
 the PCAOB is the organization&apos;s willingness, 
 from the very beginning, to tackle the myth that 
 a more expensive audit from a Big Four firm is 
 necessarily a superior audit and the myth that 
 the Big Four firms always place investor 
 interests ahead of their clients&apos; interests. In 
 many cases the Big Four audits are mostly 
 conducted by fresh college graduates that are 
 about as effective as Keystone cops going 
 through the motions.

In a way, the PCAOB took over where Abe Briloff 
 left off. Abe also only examined a minuscule 
 portion of the public financial statements and 
 found an even smaller proportion of Big Eight 
 audit failures and evidence of lack of 
 independence.

But one-by-one Abe&apos;s anecdotal disclosures of 
 audit failures added up over the years to a 
 point where the accumulated record was far more 
 influential than most any fine or lawsuit. The 
 Big Eight went after Briloff because over time 
 his revelations really did knock them off their 
 high horses. The same thing is happening with 
 the PCAOB audit inspections. Please give them a 
 little more time!

I think Briloff and now the PCAOB are doing more 
 to improve audit professionalism than most any 
 other single thing apart from multimillion 
 losses in court settlements.

And I don&apos;t think we can wipe off the SOX 
 successes with a sweep of the pen until we 
 actually study the evidence of these successes 
 and failures. Unfortunately, the biggest SOX 
 successes are like auditing successes in general 
 --- successes in ex ante prevention 
 rather than ex pos t correction. After 
 SOX, how many clients really invested a 
 significant amount of time and money in 
 improving internal controls so as not to be 
 caught up with weaknesses that might be 
 discovered later on in CPA audits? I think the 
 investments were huge.

To me the real benefits of SOX and auditing in 
 general are in the prevention benefits, and 
 these are literally impossible to evaluate in 
 terms of failures that would&apos;ve happened had 
 there not been prevention efforts.

 It&apos;s a lot like the security bars (with fire 
 escape locks) on all windows and doors of our 
 former San Antonio home. 
San Antonio has an extremely high number of car 
 thefts and home burglaries. In part, this is due 
 to the high number of undocumented poor young 
 men in San Antonio who sneaked across the Rio 
 Grande and cannot find suitable jobs. Drug 
 addictions also are heavily to blame, because 
 hard core addicts will take great chances to get 
 money for street narcotics.

We won&apos;t ever know the true benefit versus cost 
 of our burglar bars in San Antonio. What we do 
 know is that we never had a burglary when over a 
 third of the other homes in our upscale 
 neighborhood, including those with electronic 
 security, were burglarized. One captured burglar 
 said he skipped our house because of the bars. 
 Instead he hit our immediate neighbor&apos;s home and 
 was hauling off possessions of our dear friends 
 when police arrived at the scene. How many 
 other burglars passed on by our house while 
 seeking out homes without bars on the windows 
 and doors?

Burglar bars are a lot like investments in 
 internal controls in that the unmeasurable 
 preventative benefits most likely greatly exceed 
 the costs. SOX made companies think more about 
 the effectiveness of their preventative internal 
 controls.

Respectfully,
Bob Jensen

 Keeping up with the standard-setting activities of 
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International 
 Accounting Standards Board (IASB) (collectively, the Boards) on their many 
 joint projects can be challenging. But with several major projects in active 
 stages, its important that you consider the potential effects of new 
 standards on your company. The Boards recently revised their work plans, 
 announcing delays on certain projects, but are still scheduled to complete 
 work on many of these projects in 2011. 

 This publication is designed to give you a snapshot 
 of key developments from a US GAAP perspective each month, along with our 
 observations about the potential implications for companies. We also include 
 references to other Ernst&amp;Young publications that provide more background 
 and detail on the projects and proposals. These publications are available 
 at ey.com/us/accountinglink. 

 The following discussion is based on our 
 observations of the standard setter meetings. The Boards are actively 
 redeliberating many of these projects, making tentative decisions that may 
 be different from earlier decisions and those in the exposure drafts (EDs). 
 At this point, the Boards decisions and our observations are all subject to 
 change.

&quot; State Audits on the Increase ,&quot; NexusNegiotuator , May 6, 2011 
---
 http://www.nexusnegotiator.com/blog/state-audits-on-the-increase/ 
 
 Say the word audit and most people will 
 immediately link it to the IRS. But were seeing an increase in state 
 audits, as state governments try to replace missing revenues. Were also 
 hearing that these audits can be unpleasant and difficult experiences. 

 Audits are on the increase in California, New York, 
 New Jersey, and Idaho. California announced in late 2010 that it had 
 Californias tax collection agencies are getting an additional $226 million 
 to hire more auditors and tax collectors and pay for new enforcement 
 initiatives, including hiring attorneys in other states to assist with 
 cross-border nexus collections and researching land records to find 
 out-of-state property owners. 

 In New York, restaurant owners recently complained 
 about state auditing methods that frequently changed, or created unrealistic 
 sales projections, on which companies were then assessed uncollected sales 
 tax. Owners also complained of confrontational auditors and unprofessional 
 behavior. 

 In Illinois, officials recently announced the 
 addition of 50 new auditors, bringing the state total to just under 200, to 
 help with the increasing audit workload. And Connecticut announced it would 
 be increasing the number of audits conducted in 2011 by 10% over previous 
 years rates. 

 As states look to increase audits, one of the areas 
 they are specifically targeting is out-of-state taxpayers who have created 
 nexus for themselves in some fashion. For example, many states closely 
 examine land records, looking for owners with out-of-state addresses, or 
 companies that are not also registered as land-owners with the state. In 
 addition, there are some states, including New York, where the failure to 
 file a return can be a red flag. The state is looking to establish that 
 someone has truly severed all ties to the state, rather than simply claiming 
 a new principal residence elsewhere and continuing to maintain property 
 in-state. 

 As financial pressure on states continues to 
 increase, so to will the number of audits. If you think you may have a 
 possible connection to another state, now is the time to act. There are 
 options available, including a negotiated settlement between you and a state 
 that can limit fines and penalties and unpaid taxes. However, once a state 
 finds you, your negotiating power is limited. Talk to your CPA or tax 
 advisor right away, and take the necessary steps. 
 
 The Newness Versus Rigor Tradeoff: The&quot;rigor&quot;bar has been 
ratcheting up for the last 20-30 years 

&quot;FMA Decisions Are Out,&quot;The Unknown Professor, Financial Rounds , May 
3 ---
 http://financialrounds.blogspot.com/ 
 
 . . . 

 This tale of two papers reminds me of a piece I 
 read a while back (unfortunately, I can&apos;t recall its title). It discussed 
 how there&apos;s a trade-off in research between&quot;newness&quot;and&quot;required rigor&quot;. 
 In other words, if you&apos;re working on a topic that&apos;s been done to death (e.g. 
 capital structure or dividend policy), you&apos;ll be asked to do robustness 
 tests out the yazoo. On the other hand, if it&apos;s a more novel idea, there&apos;s a 
 lower bar on the rigor side, because the&quot;newness&quot;factor gets you some 
 slack on the rigor side. 

 In general, however, the&quot;rigor&quot;bar has been 
 ratcheting up for the last 20-30 years, regardless of the&quot;newness&quot;factor. 
 To see this, realize that the average length of a Journal of Finance article 
 in the early 80s was something like l6 pages - now it&apos;s more like 30-40. As 
 further (anecdotal) evidence, a friend of mine had a paper published on 
 long-run returns around some types of mergers in the Journal of Banking and 
 Finance about 9 years back. They made him calculate the returns FIVE 
 different ways.

Question
What clunkers erroneously got cash for clunkers?

Answer
 In 473 cases, the tax agency erroneously allowed 439 
prisoners who were in jail the entire year, 16 dead people and 18 children under 
the age of 15 to claim just over $1 million in deductions. 

&quot; Audit: IRS Erroneously Gave Out $151 Million In Auto Tax Breaks ,&quot;by 
Kristina Peterson, Dow Jones Wires via Nasdaq.com, June 8, 2011 ---
 http://www.nasdaq.com/aspx/stock-market-news-story.aspx?storyid=201106080015dowjonesdjonline000005&amp;title=auditirs-erroneously-gave-out-151-million-in-auto-tax-breaks 
 
 The Internal Revenue Service stumbled in handling a 
 tax incentive designed to promote automobile sales, handing out more than 
 $151 million in erroneous deductions, as well as 473 credits given to people 
 who were imprisoned, dead or underage, a Treasury Department report said 
 Wednesday. 

 The IRS missed 4,257 individuals who claimed more 
 than $151 million in undeserved tax deductions as part of the 2009 stimulus 
 package program designed to boost automobile sales, according to an audit 
 released Wednesday from the Treasury inspector general for tax 
 administration. 

 In 473 cases, the tax agency erroneously allowed 
 439 prisoners who were in jail the entire year, 16 dead people and 18 
 children under the age of 15 to claim just over $1 million in deductions. 

 The tax incentive was designed to boost vehicle 
 sales by allowing taxpayers up to a certain income level to deduct some 
 state and local taxes from buying a car, light truck, motorcycle or motor 
 home between February 2009 and January 2010. The deduction expired Dec. 31, 
 2009, and hasn&apos;t been extended. 

 Problematically, the IRS doesn&apos;t require 
 individuals to supply independent documents proving that they bought a car 
 that qualified for the tax deduction, leading them to permit the tax break 
 in error at times, the report found. When auditors looked at a sample of 150 
 tax returns of individuals who applied for the deduction, they only found 
 records that 65 of those people had actually purchased a qualified vehicle 
 that year. 

 Even when the IRS does flag suspicious accounts, it 
 doesn&apos;t always take the proper steps to decide whether the person deserves 
 the deduction, the report concluded. 

 &quot;It is imperative that the IRS address the 
 weaknesses identified in this report,&quot;J. Russell George, the Treasury 
 inspector general for tax administration said in a statement.&quot;These are 
 taxpayers&apos; dollars, and the [IRS] must ensure that only those who deserve 
 this and other tax benefits receive them.&quot; 

 The IRS agreed to review all of the cases flagged 
 by the report.

 http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/Theory01.htm#EMH 
 
 

 Warren 
Buffett did a lot of almost fatal damage to the EMH 
If you really want to understand the problem youre apparently wanting to study, 
read about how Warren Buffett changed the whole outlook of a great 
econometrics/mathematics researcher (Janet Tavkoli). Ive mentioned this 
fantastic book before --- Dear Mr. 
Buffett . What opened her eyes is how Warren Buffet built his vast, vast 
fortune exploiting the errors of the sophisticated mathematical model builders 
when valuing derivatives (especially options) where he became the writer of 
enormous option contracts (hundreds of millions of dollars per contract). Warren 
Buffet dared to go where mathematical models could not or would not venture when 
the real world became too complicated to model. Warren reads financial 
statements better than most anybody else in the world and has a fantastic 
ability to retain and process what hes studied. Its impossible to model his 
mind. 
 I finally grasped what Warren was saying. Warren has such a wide body of 
 knowledge that he does not need to rely on systems. . . . Warrens vast 
 knowledge of corporations and their finances helps him identify derivatives 
 opportunities, too. He only participates in derivatives markets when Wall 
 Street gets it wrong and prices derivatives (with mathematical models) 
 incorrectly. Warren tells everyone that he only does certain derivatives 
 transactions when they are mispriced. 
 Wall Street derivatives traders construct trading models with no clear idea 
 of what they are doing. I know investment bank modelers with advanced math 
 and science degrees who have never read the financial statements of the 
 corporate credits they model. This is true of some credit derivatives 
 traders, too.

October 28, 2009 reply from Paul Williams [Paul_Williams@NCSU.EDU ]
 
 Bob, et al,
I never cease to marvel at the powers of rationalization defenders of sacred 
 institutions can muster. The above characterization of EMH was certainly not 
 the version pedaled by its accounting disciples (notably Bill Beaver) back 
 in the late 60s and early 70s. An accounting research industry was created 
 based on a version of EMH that was decidedly more certain that securities 
 were&quot;properly priced.&quot;[Why else do studies to debunk the Briloff effect?]. 

 Given the interpretation offered above,&quot;Information Content Studies&quot;make no sense. The whole idea of this 
 methodology was that accounting data that correlated with prices implied 
 market participants found it useful for setting prices based on publicly 
 available data, which implied such prices were the ones that would exist in 
 an idealized world of perfectly informed investors. Thus, this data met the 
 test of being information and was to be preferred to other&quot;non-information&quot;to which the market did not react. 

 But now we are told that this latest version of EMH 
 does not justify such sanguinity because&quot;...the prices in the market are 
 mostly wrong...&quot;, thus prices are not an indicator of the value of data, 
 i.e., just because there is a price effect we still don&apos;t know if that data 
 is truly&quot;information.&quot;Think of the millions and millions of taxpayer 
 dollars that have been wasted over the last forty years subsidizing people 
 to search for something that is indeterminate given the methodology they are 
 employing. 

 And for this the AAA awarded Seminal Contributions. 
 Jim Boatsman had an ingenious little paper in Abacus eons ago titled,&quot;Why 
 Are There Tigers and Things,&quot;that cast serious doubts on the whole 
 enterprise of&quot;testing&quot;market efficiency. It addressed the issue Carl 
 Devine harped on about needing an independent definition of&quot;information.&quot;And this is related to the logical slight of hand EMH required of surmising 
 there is a way to know what the&quot;true&quot;price is since we glibly talk about 
 over and under and mis-priced securities. 

 But there is no way to know this, since security 
 prices are CREATED by the institution of the securities market. There does 
 not exist a natural process against which market performance can be 
 compared.&quot;Market value,&quot;which is what a price is, is a value established 
 by the market. The market is all there is. To paraphrase NC&apos;s current 
 governor&apos;s favorite expression,&quot;The price is what it is.&quot; 

 It isn&apos;t over or under or mis or proper or anything 
 else, other than what a particular institution created by us at one moment 
 in time determines it is. If we lived in a society in which mob rule settled 
 issues of justice, it would make little sense to argue that someone the mob 
 hung was&quot;not guilty.&quot;Of course he was guilty, because the mob hung him!!

 A Fundamentals Approach to Valuing a Business 

In the great book Dear Mr. Buffett , Janet Tavakoli shows how Warren 
Buffet learned value (fundamentals) investing while taking Benjamin Graham&apos;s 
value investing course while earning a masters degree in economics from Columbia 
University. Buffet also worked for Professor Graham.

The following book supposedly takes the Graham approach to a new level 
(although I&apos;ve not yet read the book). Certainly the book will be controversial 
among the efficient markets proponents like Professors Fama and French.

 Purportedly a Great, Great Book on Value Investing

 OMG Did I Die&amp;Go to heaven?
Just Read, Applied Value Investing , My Favorite Book of the Past 5 
 Years!!
Listen To This Interview! 

 I have a confession, I might have read the best 
 value investing book published in the past 5 years! 

 The book is called Applied Value Investing By Joseph Calandro Jr. In 
 the book Mr. Calandro applies the tenets of value investing via (real) case 
 studies. Buffett, was once asked how he would teach a class on security 
 analysis, he replied, case studies. Unlike other books which are 
 theoretical this book provides you with the actual steps for valuing 
 businesses. 

 Without a doubt, this book ranks amongst the best 
 value investing books (with SA, Margin of Safety, Buffetts letters to 
 corporate America, and Greenwalds book)&amp;you dont have to take my word for 
 it. Seth Klarman, Mario Gabelli and many top investors have given the book a 
 plug! 

 Here is an interview with the author of the book, Applied Value Investing ( I recommend listening to this). Who knows perhaps 
 yours truly will interview him soon.

 P.S. 

 A fellow blogger and friend will soon post a review 
 of this book ( hint: Street Capitalist !).

U.S. auditing firms are roaring tigers compared to Chinese auditing firms
 Chinese Firms Need to Open Up Books 

 Question
What do Trojan Horse viruses, listed Chinese companies in the U.S., and many 
for-profit universities have in common? 

Answer
They all entered by way of the back door. Trojan viruses are known for the the 
sneaky way they gain back 
door entry into computer systems. Many for-profit universities bought 
regional accreditation (especially from the lax Northwest Acceditation Commission ) by purchasing small, failing, and nearly 
bankrupt non-profit colleges that had shaky lingering accreditation due mostly 
to laxness of the accrediting agencies). And here&apos;s how Chinese companies 
entered into U.S. capital markets by way of the back door:
 
  In the U.S., Chinese companies have used reverse 
 mergers to gain access to the benefits of public listing without having gone 
 through the rigorous regulatory process of an initial public offering. 
 Further, Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong and other worldwide markets 
 are allowed to use auditors from mainland China in producing financial 
 statements for submission in fulfillment of listing requirements. However, 
 China has no agreement with international regulators to allow supervision 
 over the audit function in the country.&quot;In testimony to U.S. lawmakers this 
 past April, James Doty, the PCAOB&apos;s chairman, called the group&apos;s inability 
 to inspect the work of registered firms in China &apos;a gaping hole in investor 
 protection.&apos;&quot;

 SUMMARY:  In the U.S., Chinese companies have used reverse mergers 
 to gain access to the benefits of public listing without having gone through 
 the rigorous regulatory process of an initial public offering. Further, 
 Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong and other worldwide markets are 
 allowed to use auditors from mainland China in producing financial 
 statements for submission in fulfillment of listing requirements. However, 
 China has no agreement with international regulators to allow supervision 
 over the audit function in the country.&quot;In testimony to U.S. lawmakers this 
 past April, James Doty, the PCAOB&apos;s chairman, called the group&apos;s inability 
 to inspect the work of registered firms in China &apos;a gaping hole in investor 
 protection.&apos;&quot;

 CLASSROOM APPLICATION:  The article may be used in an auditing class 
 to relate the role of the PCAOB and the audit function to investor 
 confidence in financial markets. It also may be used in an international 
 accounting class to discuss current issues faced in globalization of 
 financial markets.

 QUESTIONS:  
1. ( Advanced ) What is the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
 (PCAOB)?

2. ( Advanced ) What role does the PCAOB play that provides critical 
 support to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulators 
 over U.S. markets?

3. ( Introductory ) What is the difference between the role the PCAOB 
 fills with respect to U.S. publicly-traded companies and the role it can 
 play regarding Chinese companies listed in the U.S.?

4. ( Advanced ) What is a&quot;reverse merger&quot;? How can this transaction 
 avoid difficult requirements associated with an initial public offering 
 (IPO)?

5. ( Introductory ) How do stock markets react to the uncertainty 
 created by the current situation for Chinese companies with shares listed 
 outside of their home country? What does it mean to say that these companies 
 should&quot;open their books&quot;to resolve this uncertainty?

6. ( Introductory ) Refer to the related video. Who will get&quot;left 
 behind&quot;as China moves to higher value added production as its economic 
 focus? How does that possibility compare to the situation we face in the 
 U.S.?

&quot;Chinese Firms Need to Open Up Books,&quot;by: Peter Stein, The Wall Street 
Journal, June 20, 2011 ---
 http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304453304576391273351090918.html?mod=djem_jiewr_AC_domainid 
 
 Poor access to information is a major culprit in 
 the selloff of China&apos;s overseas-listed companies. If China hopes to limit 
 the damage, it needs to open up. 

 The Securities and Exchange Commission is 
 investigating accounting and disclosure issues at a number of U.S.-listed 
 Chinese companies that acquired backdoor listings through so-called reverse 
 mergers, and even top-name Chinese companies are inviting new scrutiny. 
 Renren Inc., a social-networking site that launched its shares to much 
 fanfare in early May, now trades at about half its IPO price. Renren itself 
 stirred controversy when it lowered the growth rate of its user base without 
 explanation in its IPO prospectus and the head of its audit committee 
 resigned just before the listing. 

 Shares of Toronto-listed Sino-Forest Corp. have 
 plunged 80% since late May after a short seller alleged problems in the 
 forestry company&apos;s accounting, which the company denies. Hong Kong-listed 
 Chinese companies, too, are drawing new scrutiny over their accounting. 

 Not all Chinese companies are shady. But investors 
 are right to ask: How do you know which aren&apos;t? 

 One answer is access to information. Auditors need 
 it to be sure a company&apos;s business is as good as management says it is. So 
 do regulators who oversee the auditors. 

 In the case of Chinese companies, however, there 
 are no arrangements that allow the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
 Board, the U.S. government&apos;s accounting regulator, to inspect the work of 
 accountants in China. So the PCAOB can&apos;t really know whether that work is 
 reliable. Using U.S. accountants doesn&apos;t help because they outsource the 
 real work to accountants in China anyway. 

 In testimony to U.S. lawmakers this past April, 
 James Doty, the PCAOB&apos;s chairman, called the group&apos;s inability to inspect 
 the work of registered firms in China&quot;a gaping hole in investor 
 protection.&quot; 

 The limited ability of Hong Kong regulators to 
 access information on Chinese companies has long been a risk factor for the 
 city&apos;s stock market, the primary venue through which foreign investors buy a 
 piece of China. That ability suffered a new blow late last year when the 
 local exchange agreed to let mainland Chinese companies listed in the 
 territory use mainland auditors. As part of the new arrangement, Hong Kong&apos;s 
 Securities and Futures Commission secured a promise that it would be able to 
 examine records of auditors for companies it wants to investigate. 

 &quot;Clearly the test will be when we have a live case 
 to go through,&quot;Martin Wheatley, the outgoing head of the SFC, recently said 
 in an interview. That hasn&apos;t yet happened. 

 Concerns about the transparency of Chinese 
 companies put one Hong Kong-listed stock through the wringer last week. On 
 Tuesday, Standard&amp;Poor&apos;s withdrew its ratings for long-term corporate debt 
 of a major Chinese packaging manufacturer, Nine Dragons Paper (Holdings) 
 Ltd., after its analyst complained of being unable to get senior management 
 to answer questions about the company&apos;s business. The stock plunged more 
 than 17% after S&amp;P&apos;s move, though it regained much of the loss the next day, 
 when Nine Dragons said it was willing to cooperate with S&amp;P and respond to 
 requests for information.

Jensen Comment
Sometimes we think it might be nice to send these listed Chinese companies out 
the back door on the horse they road in on, but then we must face the reality 
that China is our banker that keeps the deficit-ridden United States afloat. 
It&apos;s wise to send your banker back out on the horse he rode in on.

It would seem that listed Chinese companies would have audits conducted by 
large international CPA firms in order to attract investors suspicious of 
Chinese accounting and auditing. Capital market efficiency is not entirely dead.
 
&quot; (Francine) McKenna Covers The Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting ,&quot;by 
Francine McKenna, re:TheAuditors , May 3, 2011 ---
 http://retheauditors.com/2011/05/03/mckenna-covers-the-berkshire-hathaway-annual-meeting/ 
 
 There are many ways journalists, investors, and 
 Warren Buffett himself refer to the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting, held 
 in Omaha, Nebraska. These short-cuts and sobriquets add a larger-than-life 
 aspect to what is typically, for almost any other public company, a rather 
 perfunctory affair. Barring any significant controversy, expected or 
 unexpected, no one that doesnt absolutely have to show up at an annual 
 meeting usually makes the trip. 

 I had the good fortune to spend some time on 
 Saturday with the New York Bureau Chief of The Economist Matthew Bishop. 
 Hes a UK native and co-author of the book Philanthrocapitalism. This was 
 also his first time at the Woodstock for Capitalism. 

 (Thats what Warren Buffet calls the event in his 
 Annual Letter to Shareholders but I think this Buffettism is oxymoronic.) 

 Bishop told me that in the UK there used to be much 
 higher attendance at shareholder meetings, usually for the banks. This 
 reliable audience consisted mainly of retirees because the companies served 
 a lovely lunch in the City. When that stopped, most budget-minded pensioners 
 no longer attended. 

 Every once and a while someone calls me a gad-fly 
 with regard to audit industry reform. I dont much like that term because it 
 makes a buzzing sound in my ears. When they also mention fabled 
 shareholders activist Evelyn Y. Davis in the same breath, I warm to the 
 label. You can still count on her to stir up a fuss at an Annual Meeting. 

 Ms. Davis is a corporate governance legend. Heres 
 her tombstone. 

 The Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting draws a huge 
 crowd because it features several hours of the wit and wisdom of Berkshire 
 Hathaway CEO and Chairman Warren Buffett and his friend and Vice Chairman 
 Charlie Munger. To say that Buffett, Munger, and Berkshire Hathaway have a 
 cult-like following would be a significant understatement. 

 The atmosphere is a Buffett-a-palooza a term 
 used across the board by   major 
 media as well as   bloggers. 
 
 Jeff Harding at The Daily Capitalist : I like the fact that our 
 society elevates people like Buffett and Munger to celebrity status. 
 After all, we dont have kings to adore. We Americans like and respect 
 money and we admire people who  make money. Ask de Tocqueville 
 who was amazed at the audacity of poor people who thought they could 
 elevate themselves through diligence and hard work. We may love our 
 athletes and movie stars, but we  listen to the ultra wealthy. 
 
 This year there was more interest than ever in the 
 Berkshire meeting because of the Sokol affair .

The Wall Street Journal ,  The 
 New York Times , The Motley Fool , and assorted others such as WalletPop Canadas Neil Jain live-blogged 
 the meeting, which ran from 9:30am until 5:00pm. The most complete 
 transcript of the Q&amp;A Ive seen can be found here: Notes from the Berkshire 
 Hathaway 2011 Annual Meeting , prepared by a 
 soon-to-be graduate who calls himself The Inoculated Investor. 

 Understand The formal Annual Meeting with a legal 
 recording of the votes on resolutions in the proxy, election of the slate of 
 Board of Directors and confirmation of the auditor Deloitte was 
 conducted during the last half hour of the day. The rest of the meeting was 
 a Q&amp;A session with Buffett and Munger, the two of them alone on a bare stage 
 in front of 40,000 people. It was an example of high performance art, 
 including Buffett playing straight man to Mungers snappy jokes until Munger 
 finally nodded off about 4:30pm or, more accurately, carbo-crashed on 
 stage, after munching constantly all day on Sees peanut brittle .

Ill let the New York Times Michael de la Merced set the tone:
 
 9:26 a.m. | Ladies and gents, take your seats 

 Its almost showtime. A gravelly announcer 
 who sounds awfully similar to that guy from all the movie trailers 
 tells of those who have gathered for one gloriously capitalistic 
 weekend. He further intones, All roads led them to Omaha before the 
 big finish: Youve arrived at the Berkshire Hathaway shareholders 
 meeting. The movie will begin in 10 minutes. 
 
 Press were asked to arrive and check in between 
 5:45am and 6:30am. Yes, three hours in advance of the start time. It was a 
 good thing, too, that I already had my press pass .

&quot; Koss suit against former auditor (Grant Thornton) to proceed ,&quot;by 
Doris Hajewski, Journal Sentinel, June 22, 2011 ---
 http://www.jsonline.com/business/124389194.html 
Thank you Caleb Newquist for the heads up.
 
 Koss Corp.&apos;s lawsuit against the company&apos;s former 
 auditor, Grant Thornton, will move forward in Cook County, Ill., according 
 to a ruling from a judge in Chicago this week. 

 Koss accuses Grant Thornton of gross negligence for 
 not uncovering the $34 million embezzlement by its former vice president of 
 finance. Sujata&quot;Sue&quot;Sachdeva is serving an 11-year sentence in federal 
 prison for the crime, which came to light in December 2009 when American 
 Express notified Koss of the fraud. 

 Grant Thornton had sought to have the Cook County 
 action dismissed. 

 In other litigation related to the embezzlement, a 
 fairness hearing is scheduled Friday in Milwaukee County on a proposed 
 settlement for a derivative lawsuit against the Koss board of directors, 
 Sachdeva and Grant Thornton. The agreement, reached in May, calls for the 
 dismissal with prejudice of claims against individual Koss directors. Claims 
 against Grant Thornton and Sachdeva would be dismissed without prejudice, 
 meaning they could be refiled 

 The suit didn&apos;t seek money for shareholders but 
 asked the court to order corporate governance reforms at the company and for 
 any money paid by defendants in that case to be paid to Koss. 

 Koss also has suits pending against firms that were 
 involved in payments using embezzled money. 

 A Maricopa County court is considering Koss&apos; 
 request for reconsideration of the dismissal of its complaint against 
 American Express. Koss claims Amex should have notified the company sooner 
 when it discovered Sachdeva was using company money to pay her bills. 

 In another suit pending in Milwaukee County Circuit 
 Court, Koss claims that Park Bank was lax in issuing checks to Sachdeva from 
 company accounts and not detecting the fraud.

&quot; Online Courses Should Always Include Proctored Finals, Economist Warns ,&quot;by David Glenn, Chronicle of Higher Education , May 10, 2011 ---

 Online economics students do not absorb much 
 material from homework and chapter tests during the semesterperhaps because 
 they expect to be able to cheat their way through the final exam. That is 
 the lesson from a study that Cheryl J. Wachenheim, an associate 
 professor of agribusiness and applied economics at North Dakota State 
 University, will present in July at the annual meeting of the Agricultural 
 and Applied Economics Association. 

 Ms. Wachenheim is no enemy of distance education. 
 As The Chronicle reported in 2009, she continued to teach her 
 online courses even during a National Guard deployment to Iraq. But she has 
 noticed that her online students perform much worse than their 
 classroom-taught counterparts when they are required to take a proctored, 
 closed-book exam at the end of the semester. 

 In her studya previous version of which appeared in the Review of Agricultural Economics Ms. Wachenheim looked at the 
 performance of students in six sections of introductory-economics courses at 
 North Dakota State. In online sections whose final exam was unproctored and 
 open book, students exam grades were roughly the same as those of 
 classroom-based students who took proctored, closed-book finals. But online 
 sections that were asked to take proctored, closed-book final exams 
 performed at least 15 points worse on a 100-point scale. 

 Ms. Wachenheim fears that students in those 
 unproctored online sections really werent learning much, even though their 
 grades were fine. In self-paced courses, many students appeared to cram most 
 of the homework and chapter exams into the final week of the semester. Few 
 of them bothered to do the ungraded practice problems offered by the online 
 publisher. 

 Then there is the question of cheating. Ms. 
 Wachenheims study did not gather any direct evidence, but she reports 
 anecdotally that students have told her how they work in groups to compile 
 huge caches of the publishers test-bank questions. She quotes one student 
 as saying, We may not learn the material, but we are guaranteed an A. 

 Ms. Wachenheims findings parallel those of a 2008 study i n the Journal of Economic 
 Education. That study found indirect evidence that students cheat on 
 unproctored online tests, because their performance on proctored exams was 
 much more consistent with predictions based on their class ranks and their 
 overall grade-point averages.

Jensen Comment
Since proctors are easily distracted and often miss peeking at cribbed notes and 
angled vision and pass the trash kinds of cheating, well placed videos can often 
be better than proctoring, especially when set up in individual cubicles.

&quot; What use is game theory? &quot;by Steve Hsu, Information Processing , 
May 4, 2011 ---
 http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2011/05/what-use-is-game-theory.html 
 
 Fantastic interview with game theorist Ariel Rubinstein on 
 Econtalk. I agree with Rubinstein that game theory has little predictive 
 power in the real world, despite the pretty mathematics. Experiments at RAND (see, e.g., Mirowski&apos;s Machine Dreams ) showed early game theorists, 
 including Nash, that people don&apos;t conform to the idealizations in their 
 models. But this wasn&apos;t emphasized (Mirowski would claim it was deliberately 
 hushed up) until more and more experiments showed similar results. (Who 
 woulda thought -- people are&quot;irrational&quot;! :-)

Perhaps the most useful thing about game theory is that it requires you to 
 think carefully about decision problems. The discipline of this kind of 
 analysis is valuable, even if the models have limited applicability to real 
 situations.

Rubinstein discusses a number of topics, including raw intelligence vs 
 psychological insight and its importance in economics (see also here ). He has, in my opinion, a very developed and 
 mature view of what social scientists actually do, as opposed to what they 
 claim to do.

accounting firm BDO. The suitfiled Thursday in federal court in Dallassays BDO 
did not only aid and abet the $7 billion dollar fraudit was a co-conspirator. 
BDOs cozy relationship with the Stanford Financial Group was steeped in 
conflicts of interest and required ongoing deceptive and duplicitous 
manipulation of the facts to allow the Ponzi schemes exponential growth for 
over a decade, the complaint says. The result of this deception is the loss of 
thousands of investors life savings.

 A History of Entrereneurship

  Who 
Are The Entrepreneurs: The Elite or the Everyday Man? A History of 
Entrepreneurship 
 
 We trace the social positions of the men and women 
 who found new enterprises from the earliest years of one industrys history 
 to a time when the industry was well established. Sociological theory 
 suggests two opposing hypotheses. First, pioneering entrepreneurs are 
 socially prominent individuals from fields adjacent to the new industry and 
 later entrepreneurs are from an increasingly broad swath of society. Second, 
 the earliest entrepreneurs come from the social periphery while later 
 entrepreneurs include more industry insiders and members of the social 
 elite. To test these hypotheses, we study the magazine industry in America 
 over the first 120 years of its history, from 1741 to 1860. We find that 
 magazine publishing was originally restricted to industry insiders, elite 
 professionals, and the highly educated, but by the time the industry became 
 well established, most founders came from outside publishing and more were 
 of middling stature mostly small-town doctors and clergy without college 
 degrees. We also find that magazines founded by industry insiders remained 
 concentrated in the three biggest cities, while magazines founded by 
 outsiders became geographically dispersed. Finally, we find that 
 entrepreneurship evolved from the pursuit of a lone individual to a more 
 organizationally-sponsored activity; this reflects the modernization of 
 America during this time period. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of 
 grounding studies of entrepreneurship in historical context. Our analysis of 
 this old new media industry also offers hints about how the new new 
 media industries are likely to evolve.

 CLASSROOM APPLICATION:  The article is excellent for use in 
 managerial accounting classes to discuss planned production in support of 
 sales strategy and the particular need for target costing in this situation.

 QUESTIONS:  
1. ( Introductory ) Why is Ford focusing on its planned auto sales in 
 Asia and India?

2. ( Advanced ) What is target costing? Why is that strategy 
 particularly important in Ford&apos;s growth strategy described in this article?

3. ( Advanced ) What other factors must the company consider as it 
 designs&quot;from the ground up&quot;models for China and India&quot;to sell at low 
 prices&quot;?

4. ( Advanced ) Summarize Ford&apos;s production capacity issues in the 
 Asia-Pacific region. How do these issues contribute to difficulties in 
 planning production and estimating product costs?

&quot;Ford Ramps Asian Car Plans,&quot;by: Jeff Bennett, The Wall Street Journal , 
June 17, 2011 ---
 http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304186404576390024237701428.html?mod=djem_jiewr_AC_domainid 
 
 Ford Motor Co. believes it can earn a&quot;competitive 
 return&quot;in China and India even as it rolls out a string of new cars in 
 those markets that will sell for much lower prices than the vehicles it 
 sells in North America and Europe. 

 Over the next four years, Ford plans to expand to 
 15 from five the number of vehicles it sells in China. Some of the new cars 
 will sell for less than $14,500, Ford&apos;s Asia Pacific and Africa President 
 Joe Hinrichs said on Thursday. In India, Ford will sell eight models, up 
 from three, with some selling for under $8,500 like its Figo subcompact, he 
 said. 

 Auto makers often find it difficult to make money 
 on small, inexpensive cars because of it can cost hundreds of millions of 
 dollars to develop a new model from the ground up. 

 But Mr. Hinrichs said Ford is confident it can 
 profitably sell low-cost cars in China and India by sharing the basic 
 designs with other Ford units around the world, increasing the company&apos;s 
 economies of scale.&quot;We are making money there now and we can continue to,&quot;Mr. Hinrichs said at Ford&apos;s Dearborn, Mich., headquarters.&quot;It&apos;s all about 
 the scale and the cost base.&quot; 

 Ford last week set a goal of increasing its global 
 automotive sales by 50%, to eight million vehicles a year by 2020, with the 
 bulk of the gain coming from the Asia-Pacific region. During the same 
 period, the company also hopes to improve global automotive operating 
 margins to about 9% from 6.1% last year. 

 Mr. Hinrichs said Ford needs to develop new models 
 that sell at low prices to be able to expand rapidly in Asia. Vehicles with 
 sticker prices below $14,500 make up about 70% of the market in China, and 
 while those under $8,500 account for 70% of the Indian market, according to 
 Ford. Ford&apos;s best-selling vehicle in China today costs about $16,500; in 
 India, its top seller costs about $7,600. 

 Brian Johnson, an automotive analyst at Barclays 
 Capital, said it will be a challenge for Ford.&quot;If Ford can leverage the 
 global engineering and the locally-tailored content to produce a cheap, but 
 reliable product, then there is room for them to succeed,&quot;he said. 

 Local Chinese and Indian auto makers&quot;don&apos;t have 
 the global scale&quot;that Ford can leverage, while some other western car 
 companies are not yet moving quickly into low-cost cars, he added. Tata 
 Motors made a splash in India in 2009 when it began selling its small Nano 
 car for about $2,500 although the vehicle ran into some problems when a 
 faulty switch led to fires in three cars. 

 Mr. Hinrichs took over Ford&apos;s Asia-Pacific region 
 in late 2009 and was given the additional duties as China chief executive 
 last year. Ford expects 45% of the global industry automotive sales to come 
 from Asia-Pacific by 2020, dwarfing the more mature Americas market&apos;s 25%. 

 Last year, Ford began building the $7,600 Figo at a 
 plant in Chennai, India. It developed the car by starting with an older 
 version of the Fiesta originally designed for the European market. Ford 
 modified the vehicle and stripped out about $1,000 in cost to sell it at a 
 much lower price in India, Mr. Hinrichs said. 

 Ford&apos;s forthcoming models for China and India will 
 be designed from the ground up to sell at low prices, Mr. Hinrichs said. 

 One hurdle facing Ford in Asia is production 
 capacity. Demand is outstripping supply despite $3.4 billion in plant 
 construction or expansions projects that Ford has announced in China, India, 
 Thailand and Africa. 

 Construction on one of those new investments, an 
 engine plant in Chongqing. China, began on Thursday. When open in 2013, the 
 $500 million plant will enable the Changan Ford Mazda Automobile joint 
 venture to double its output to 750,000 engines a year.

Hi Patricia,

Texas Instruments has a special relationship with TCU. You should explore 
various TI resources, including visiting speakers, TI home office tours, and 
access to various TI software and databases. For example, you might seek out TI 
experts on XBRL, SSARS 19, and Sox Section 404 on internal control auditing.

In answer to your question about auditing research courses, there&apos;s a Lule 
University of Technology auditing research syllabus at
 http://www.nordicaccounting. org/2010/05/seminar-in- auditing-research/ 

You might take a look at the various seminars available from the Institute of 
Internal Auditors ---
 http://www.theiia.org/iia- training/seminars/ 

A major module in the course should be SSARS 19 ---
 http://www.edzollars.com/ SSARS19.pdf 

If TCU has a student license to PwC&apos;s Comperio, I would devote a major 
component of an auditing research course to Comperio (which also has the FASB&apos;s 
Codification) --- http://www.pwc.com/comperio 

Even if your students cannot all access Comperio, I recommend it for yourself 
when teaching virtually all accounting and auditing courses. You may find 
this the best teaching and research resource you&apos;ve ever encountered .

Best if luck in your move to the land of the Horned Frogs.

Now comes my serious advice to you:

 Preparing for a new auditing research course is not nearly as difficult 
 as learning how to do high speed reverses and twirls in the Texas Two-Step. 
 I suggest that you spend most of the summer learning the Texas honky tonk 
 dances before you make your big move to Fort Worth ---

  Fort Worth interior decorators don&apos;t make money innovating. How many 
 ways can you decorate one big room with long horns over the fire place and 
 stuffed taxidermy heads on all four walls --- wild boar heads, deer heads, 
 eagle heads, hawk heads, turkey heads, horned frog heads, and the head of 
 the feral hog you turned on a spit last Easter?

  My best advice for you, Pat Walters, is to give your students a wide 
 array of course project options at TCU. A team project for football players 
 could be having to alphabetize a box of Alpha-Bits cereal. If they can&apos;t 
 handle this, try a package of M&amp;Ms.

  Instead of moving your household goods from New York to Texas, fill the 
 54-foot moving van with bottles of water. You can get a 1,000% markup on the 
 water and buy all new household goods. Sadly, you will eventually find 
 yourself short of water. Think beer --- beer&apos;s probably cheaper than water 
 in Fort Worth supermarkets.

 Nine Things That Will Disappear in our Lifetime ---
 http://s3.zetaboards.com/Tranquility/topic/7489553/1/ 

Jensen Comment
I&apos;m not so sure some of them will disappear so much as be transformed, e.g., 
music and television. And the Post Office may survive as a parcel carrying giant 
that competes with UPS and FedEx.

 Can you think of other things that are likely to disappear? 

 Will hard copy books disappear? Will campus and town library stacks disappear and become coffee and 
 cyber cafes? Will we one day simply check out specially-loaded eReaders from our&quot;libraries?&quot; AIDs? (a recent edition of the Economist says that eradication of AIDs 
 has become technologically feasible, more so than cancer)? Capitalism (as socialism takes over the private sector)? The FASB (as condorsement initiatives fail and IFRS wins lot, stock, and 
 barrel)? Standardized college admission tests like the SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, MCAT, 
 and LSAT (on grounds that they discriminate beyond knowledge)? Tenured teachers and professors (tenure&apos;s not entirely a bad thing to 
 eliminate)? Tenure in legislatures (term limits are probably a good thing)? Houses of worship (apart from mosques, houses of worship are already 
 pretty empty in Europe)?
In the U.S., Christian worship is heavily being transformed from traditional 
 synods to evangelical theater with music bands alongside the acting 
 preachers. Cemeteries (as part of land reclamation for farming, forests, and 
 high-rise buildings for the living instead of the dead)? Congressional boners on Twitter (or will there always be Weiners)? Circumcision (San Francisco is leading the way with a ballot 
 initiative)? Jews in San Francisco (if the circumcision-ban ballot initiative 
 succeeds)? The United States of America (which might be sold to pay off a miniscule 
 part of its foreign debt) 

 
 
From Maureen (who lives on the outskirts of Boston)

The geographical center of Boston is in Roxbury. Due north of the center we 
find the South End. This is not to be confused with South Boston which lies 
directly east from the South End. North of the South End is East Boston and 
southwest of East Boston is the North End.

Harvard Bridge The bridge connecting Boston and Cambridge via Massachusetts 
Avenue is commonly known as the Harvard Bridge. When it was built, the state 
offered to name the bridge for the Cambridge school that could present the best 
claim for the honor. Harvard submitted an essay detailing its contributions to 
education in America, concluding that it deserved the honor of having a bridge 
leading into Cambridge named for the institution. MIT did a structural analysis 
of the bridge and found it so full of defects that they agreed that it should be 
named for Harvard.

This is all true

Information on Boston and the Surrounding Areas:

There is no school on School Street, no court on Court Street, no dock on 
Dock Square, and no water on Water Street. Back Bay Boston streets are in 
alphabetical awddah: Arlington , Berkeley, Clarendon, Dartmouth, etc. So are 
South Boston streets: A, B, C, D, etc. If the streets are named after trees 
(e.g. Walnut, Chestnut, Cedar), you are on Beacon Hill. If they are named after 
poets, you are in Wellesley.



Massachusetts Avenue is Mass Ave. Commonwealth Avenue is Comm Ave. South 
Boston is Southie. The South End is the South End. East Boston is Eastie. The 
North End is east of the former West End. The West End and Scully Square are no 
more; a guy named Rappaport got rid of them one night. Roxbury is The Burree, 
Jamaica Plain is J.P.



How to say these Massachusetts city names correctly (Say it wrong and be 
shunned).

Worcester : Wuhsta (or Wistah) Gloucester : Glawsta Leicester: Lesta Woburn: 
Woobun Dedham : Dead-um Revere: Re -vee-ah Quincy: Quinzee Tewksbury : Tooks ber 
ry Leominster : Le-min-sta Peabody: Pee-ba-dee Waltham : Walth-ham Chatham: 
Chaddum Samoset: Sam-oh-set or Sum-aw-set, but nevah Summerset!

Definitions:

Frappes are made with ice cream; milkshakes are not. If it is carbonated and 
flavored, it is tonic. Soda means CLUB SODA. Pop refers to DAD. When we want 
Tonic WATER, we will ask for TONIC WATER. The smallest beer is a pint.&lt;BR&gt;Scrod 
is whatever they tell you it is, usually fish. If you paid more than $7/pound, 
you got scrod. It is not a water fountain; it is a bubblah. It is not a 
trashcan; it is a barrel. It is not a spucky, a hero, or a grinder; it is a sub. 
It is not a shopping caht; it is a carriage. It is not a purse; it is a 
pockabook.

They are not franks; they are haht dahgs; franks are money used Switzahland.



Police do not drive patrol units or black and whites; they drive a crewza. If 
you take the bus, your on the looza crooza. It is not a rubber band; it is an 
elastic. It is not a traffic circle, it is a rotary.&quot;Going to the islands&quot;means going to Martha&apos;s Vineyard or Nantucket.

The Sox = The Red Sox The Cs = The Celtics The Bs = The Bruins The Pats =The 
Patriots



Things not to do:

Do not pahk your cah in Hahvid Yahd. They will tow it to Meffa (Medford ) or 
Summahville (Somerville) . Do not sleep on the Common. (Boston Common) Do not 
wear orange in Southie on St. Patrick&apos;s Day.

Things you should know:

There are two State Houses, two City Halls, two courthouses, and two Hancock 
buildings (one is very old; one is relatively new). The colored lights on top 
the old Hancock tell the weatha:&quot;Solid blue, clear view.&quot;&quot;Flashing blue, 
clouds due.&quot;&quot;Solid red, rain ahead.&quot;&quot;Flashing red, snow instead.&quot;(except in 
summer, flashing red means the Red Sox game was rained out! Most people live 
here all their life and still do not know what the hell is going on with this 
one. Route 128 South is I-95 south. It is also I-93 north. The underground train 
is not a subway. It is the T, and it does not run all night (fah chrysakes, this 
ain&apos;t Noo Yawk). Order the cold tea in China Town after 2:00 am; you will get a 
kettle full of beer.



Bostonians: think that it is their God-given right to cut off someone in 
traffic. Bostonians: think that there are only 25 letters in the alphabet (no Rs, 
except in id). Bostonians: think that three straight days of 90+ temperatures is 
a heat wave. Bostonians: refer to 6 inches of snow as a dusting. Bostonians: 
always bang a left as soon as the light turns green, and oncoming traffic always 
expects it.. Bostonians: believe that using your turn signal is a sign of 
weakness. Bostonians: think that 63 degree ocean water is warm. Bostonians: 
think Rhode Island accents are annoying.

No NURSING HOME FOR me!!!

No nursing home for us. We&apos;ll be checking into a Holiday Inn!

With the average cost for a nursing home care costing $188.00 per day, there 
is a better way when we get old and too feeble. I&apos;ve already checked on 
reservations at the Holiday Inn. For a combined long term stay discount and 
senior discount, it&apos;s $59.23 per night. Breakfast is included, and some have 
happy hours in the afternoon. That leaves $128.77 a day for lunch and dinner in 
any restaurant we want, or room service, laundry, gratuities and special TV 
movies. Plus, they provide a spa, swimming pool, a workout room, a lounge and 
washer-dryer, etc. Most have free toothpaste and razors, and all have free 
shampoo and soap. $5 worth of tips a day you&apos;ll have the entire staff scrambling 
to help you. They treat you like a customer, not a patient. There&apos;s a city bus 
stop out front, and seniors ride free. The handicap bus will also pick you up 
(if you fake a decent limp). To meet other nice people, call a church bus on 
Sundays. For a change of scenery, take the airport shuttle bus and eat at one of 
the nice restaurants there. While you&apos;re at the airport, fly somewhere. 
Otherwise, the cash keeps building up.

It takes months to get into decent nursing homes. Holiday Inn will take your 
reservation today. And you&apos;re not stuck in one place forever -- you can move 
from Inn to Inn, or even from city to city. Want to see Hawaii? They have 
Holiday Inn there too. TV broken? Light bulbs need changing? Need a mattress 
replaced? No problem.. They fix everything, and apologize for the inconvenience.

The Inn has a night security person and daily room service. The maid checks 
to see if you are ok. If not, they&apos;ll call an ambulance . . . or the undertaker. 
If you fall and break a hip, Medicare will pay for the hip, and Holiday Inn will 
upgrade you to a suite for the rest of your life.

And no worries about visits from family. They will always be glad to find 
you, and probably check in for a few days mini-vacation.

The grandkids can use the pool. What more could I ask for?

So, when I reach that golden age, I&apos;ll face it with a grin.

A while ago a new supermarket opened in Topeka, KS. It has an automatic water 
mister to keep the produce fresh.

Just before it goes on, you hear the sound of distant thunder and the smell 
of fresh rain.

When you pass the milk cases, you hear cows mooing and you experience the 
scent of fresh mowed hay.

In the meat department there is the aroma of charcoal grilled steaks with 
onions.

When you approach the egg case, you hear hens cluck and cackle, and the air 
is filled with the pleasing aroma of bacon and eggs frying.

The bread department features the tantalizing smell of fresh baked bread and 
cookies.

I don&apos;t buy toilet paper there any more.

 Davidson Turns Over a Tough Job to Goats 

 Kudzu is out of control on Davidson College&apos;s paths

 the kudzu, the college has rented 30 goats, which have been tasked with

 to rent the goats, which eat 12-18 pounds of kudzu a day.

 Concerns That Academic Accounting Research is Out of Touch With Reality 
 
 
 I think leading academic researchers avoid applied research for the 
 profession because making seminal and creative discoveries that 
 practitioners have not already discovered is enormously difficult. Accounting academe is threatened by the 
 twin dangers of fossilization and scholasticism (of three types: 
 tedium, high tech, and radical chic) 
From http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/395wpTAR/Web/TAR395wp.htm   

 Knowledge and competence increasingly developed out of the internal 
 dynamics of esoteric disciplines rather than within the context of 
 shared perceptions of public needs, writes Bender. This is not to 
 say that professionalized disciplines or the modern service 
 professions that imitated them became socially irresponsible. But 
 their contributions to society began to flow from their own 
 self-definitions rather than from a reciprocal engagement with 
 general public discourse. 

   

 Now, there is a definite note of sadness in Benders narrative as 
 there always tends to be in accounts of the shift from Gemeinschaft to 
 Gesellschaft . Yet it is also 
 clear that the transformation from civic to disciplinary 
 professionalism was necessary. 

   

 The new disciplines offered relatively precise subject matter and 
 procedures, Bender concedes, at a time when both were greatly 
 confused. The new professionalism also promised guarantees of 
 competence certification in an era when criteria of intellectual 
 authority were vague and professional performance was unreliable. 

 But in the epilogue to Intellect and Public Life , Bender suggests that the process eventually went too far. The risk now is precisely the opposite, he writes. Academe is 
 threatened by the twin dangers of fossilization and scholasticism 
 (of three types: tedium, high tech, and radical chic). The agenda for the next decade, at least as I see it, ought to be 
 the opening up of the disciplines, the ventilating of professional 
 communities that have come to share too much and that have become 
 too self-referential.

OnThe Role of the Accounting Profession in Preventing Another Financial Crisis

 Where were the auditors when over 1,000 banks failed in 2008 and 2009?
 http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/2008Bailout.htm#AuditFirms 

When we lavish praise for accomplishments we must be careful that we are 
simply overlooking the failures that critics for years have tried and tried and 
tried to get those in power to try to correct. The SEC has acted shamefully in 
some instances (Madoff, hedge funds, and financial risk accounting) and the FASB 
fumbled many opportunities to save the horses before they bolted from the barn 
(e.g., off-balance sheet financing in banks).

More importantly, I think both the FASB and the SEC earn low grades in 
learning the lessons from Enron. Consider the following lessons to be learned at 
the turn of this century that are still with us a decade later because of FASB 
and SEC failures of accomplishment. And I&apos;m ashamed to say that all too often 
members of this Academy get low grades for not doing more to help students learn 
these lessons:

Frank Partnoy and Lynn Turner contend that Wall Street bank accounting is 
an exercise in writing fiction : Watch the video! (a bit slow loading) Lynn

Watch the video!
 We cannot take great pride in an FASB that allows this kind of financial 
reporting fiction writing to take place in our largest banks in the nation (or 
any U.S. banks for that matter) . Members of the FASB 
and SEC should hang their heads in shame when they watch the above video. 

How can the FASB take pride in allowing Lehman Brothers to follow the FAS 140 
rules to the letter in an effort to cloud transparency and deliberately deceive 
investors and creditors about financial risk? How can the SEC take pride in 
letting Lehman and Ernst off the hook for such deliberate deceptive accounting?

How can the SEC take pride in giving Enron the green light to deceptive 
accounting?
Here&apos;s part of a letter written by the then President of the Financial 
Executives International:
 
 
 
 &quot;We&apos;re The Front Line For Shareholders,&quot; by Phil 
 Livingston (President of Financial Executives 
 International), January/February 2002 --- http://www.fei.org/magazine/articles/1-2-2002_president.cfm   
 At FEI&apos;s recent financial reporting conference in 
 New York, Paul Volcker gave the keynote address and 
 declared that the accounting and auditing profession 
 were in a&quot;state of crisis.&quot;Earlier that morning, 
 over breakfast, he lamented the daily bombardment of 
 financial reporting failures in the press. 

 I agree with his assessment. The causes and 
 contributing factors are numerous, but one thing is 
 clear: We as financial executives need to do better, 
 be stronger and take the lead in restoring the 
 credibility of financial reporting and preserving 
 the capital markets. 

 If you didn&apos;t already know it and believe it deeply, 
 recent cases prove the value of a financial 
 management team that is ethical, credible and clear 
 in its communications. A loss of confidence in that 
 team can be a fatal blow, not just to the 
 individuals, but to the company or institution that 
 entrusts its assets to their stewardship. I think 
 the FEI Code of Ethical Conduct says it best, and it 
 is worth reprinting the opening section here. The 
 full code (signed by all FEI members) can be found here . 

 . . . 

 So how did the profession reach the state Volcker 
 describes as a crisis? 

 The market pressure for corporate performance 
 has increased dramatically over the last 10 
 years. That pressure has produced better results 
 for shareholders, but also a higher fatality 
 rate as management teams pressed too hard at the 
 margin. The standard-setters floundered in the issue de 
 jour quagmire, writing hugely complicated 
 standards that were unintelligible and 
 irrelevant to the bigger problems. The SEC fiddled while the dot-com bubble burst. 
 Deriding and undermining management teams and 
 the auditors, the past administration made a 
 joke of financial restatements. We&apos;ve had no vision for the future of financial 
 reporting. Annual reports, 10Ks and 10Qs are 
 obsolete. Bloomberg and Yahoo! Finance have 
 replaced the horse-and-buggy vehicles with 
 summary financial information linked to breaking 
 news. We&apos;ve had no vision for the future of 
 accounting. Today&apos;s mixed model is criticized 
 one day for recognizing unrealized fair value 
 contractual gains and alternatively for not 
 recognizing the fair value of financial 
 instruments. The auditors dropped their required skeptical 
 attitude and embraced business partnering 
 philosophies. Adding value and justifying the 
 audit fees became the mandate. Management teams 
 and audit committees promoted this, too. Audit committees have not kept up with the 
 challenges of the assignment. True financial 
 reporting experts are needed on these 
 committees, not the general management expertise 
 required by the stock exchange rules. 
 
 
 
 

 

The FASB and IASB do not hold up well against their most vocal critics, in 
which case I am more proud of the critics than I am of the people who could&apos;ve 
done more but caved in to pressures of industry and Congress to do less.

I think Tom Selling and others are correct in what I think is resistance to 
the course set by the FASB and the SEC to turn standard setting over to the IASB. 
We are being lulled into complacency by all the efforts of the FASB and IASB to 
jointly write convergence standards. The rest of the world has been silent while 
the U.S. for a time makes the IASB look puppets on our strings attached approach 
to convergence, but once we&apos;ve made the final commitment there are 90+ nations 
of the world that will voice screaming complaints about continued U.S. condorser 
influence on the IASB. ]

Lastly, sometimes Tom Selling does not know when to back off. He&apos;s been wrong 
to personally attack Bob Herz for no good reason that I can figure out. Let 
bygones be bygones and more importantly, in true academic spirit, admit to your 
own mistakes.

But without our critics like Tom, Lynn, and sometimes me those having the 
power, authority, and responsibility might be lulled into complacency. I&apos;ve 
recorded many tidbits that show a mismatch between the lavish praise this 
profession bestows upon itself in the midst of failures it glosses over all too 
often In the years of building up my picture of this profession, I now 
conclude that the picture is quite ugly to date and is probably going to become 
more horrid before it gets better ---

Hi Linda,

While you were enjoying your wine last night on the prairie I gave some 
thought to possible content of your Socialism Accounting Course at Nebraska.

One module in that socialism course might ask students for creative 
suggestions for redesigning Nebraska&apos;s entire School of Accountancy curriculum 
if the U.S. became a socialist state and ended all financial capital markets, 
commodities markets, real estate markets, insurance markets, etc. We might even 
describe this as the dream of Paul Williams, Zafar Khan, and possibly even you 
Linda.

Virtually all accounting content based upon a market economy will have to be 
replaced. In fact, the entire curriculum will probably be changed to a series of 
governmental accounting and auditing courses.

 

Here are some changes and possibly some constants in the curriculum.

 Change the Pacioli Equation from A=L+E to A=G 
In Principles of Accounting all accountancy based upon market resource 
allocation would have to be modified. There would be no L for Pacioli&apos;s famous 
equation since there are no lenders seeking to profit from loans to companies. 
Obviously, there can no longer be an E in this equation since there are no 
equity markets under a full socialism economy that does not allow profits (and 
perhaps has a 100% tax rate on profits that might somehow arise). The new 
equation would be A=G and all accountancy courses based upon capitalism&apos;s 
markets would have to be replaced with governmental accounting and auditing 
courses.

 Surprisingly, CPV Analysis Might Remain in the Curriculum 
Initially one might think that there cannot be CPV Analysis if there are no&quot;profits&quot;in the economy and perhaps not even prices in a socialism resource 
rationing economy. But Lange prices can be used to implement demand and supply 
in place of capitalism&apos;s market resource allocations. Lange prices were invented 
by the famous Polish socialist Oskar Lange ---
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Lange 

Years ago when I took Alan Manne&apos;s Operations Research Economics course in 
Stanford&apos;s doctoral program, we were required to eliminate market-driven prices 
and build a dynamic linear programming model to derive Lange prices to implement 
Central Planning Board (CPB) desired resource rationing. For example, in 
capitalist markets factories and their customers make pricing decisions based 
upon demand and supply markets for spikes (really huge nails) versus brads (tiny 
little nails). Oskar Lange devised a scheme for setting socialism prices so that 
a Polish war would not be lost for want of a single horseshoe nail.

The idea was that the CPB&apos;s resource allocations could be implemented using 
Lange prices in place of market prices. Factory managers and hardware store 
managers could then make production and purchase decisions based upon CPV 
analysis using Lange prices. This lends efficiency to socialism rationing since 
CPB rationing can be implemented without massive and complicated rationing 
schemes --- the pricing scheme that&apos;s so efficient in capitalism can thereby be 
utilized for decentralized demand and supply decisions using Lange prices. Of 
course any&quot;profits&quot;that accrue to factories and stores will probably be taxed 
later on at 100% since any profit incentives would turn factories and stores 
into sociopaths.
 
 In this book, Lange advocated the use of market 
 tools (especially the neoclassical pricing theory) in economic planning of 
 socialism and Marxism. He proposed that central planning boards set prices 
 through&quot;trial and error&quot;, making adjustments as shortages and surpluses 
 occurred rather than relying on a free price mechanism. If there were 
 shortages, prices would be raised; if there were surpluses, prices would be 
 lowered. Raising the prices would encourage businesses to increase 
 production, driven by their desire to increase their profits, and in doing 
 so eliminate the shortage. Lowering the prices would encourage businesses to 
 curtail production in order to prevent losses, which would eliminate the 
 surplus. Therefore, it would be a simulation of the market mechanism, which 
 Lange thought would be capable of effectively managing supply and demand. 
 Proponents of this idea argue that it combines the advantages of a market 
 economy with those of socialist economics. 

 By this idea, Lange also argued that a state-run 
 economy could at least be as efficient as - if not more efficient than - a 
 capitalist or private market economy. He argued that this was possible if 
 the government planners used the price system as if in a market economy and 
 instructed state industry managers to respond parametrically to the 
 state-determined prices (minimize cost, etc.). Lange&apos;s argument was one of 
 the pivots of the Socialist Calculation Debate with the Austrian School. 

 His works provided the earliest model of market 
 socialism. 
 
Of course the big problem socialism will then face when taxing all of the&quot;profits&quot;derived from Lange prices is that managers lose their incentives to be 
efficient. Why try to work harder to save money when all the profits will be 
confiscated? I recommend, Linda, that you pass over that stumbling block in 
socialism, although it was truly one of the worst problems when the Soviet Union 
was operating under socialism. The factories and stores were notoriously 
inefficient except where efficient black markets evolved that were (gasp) 
capitalist in nature.

 Change from XBRL to GGRL 
The purpose of XBRL is to aid security analysts and investors and creditors in 
making investment portfolio decisions. Since there are no investment portfolios 
under socialism, there is no more need for an eXtensible Business Reporting 
Language as we know it today. However, the CPB may still want to tag 
transactions to aid in socialism&apos;s resource allocations. Accordingly, XBRL will 
probably give way to an entirely new system of tagging known as Glorious 
Government Reporting Language tags.

 No More Consolidation Accounting
 Virtually everything we teach in the Advanced Accounting course will have to 
be replaced. There will be no equity-exchange mergers and acquisitions. And 
there will be no profit incentives to purchase and sell subsidiaries. All 
factory mergers and divorces become flat-out CPB decrees.

 No More Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
Since there are no more futures, forwards, swaps, and options markets, it&apos;s 
pointless to teach accounting for derivatives and hedging activities. Not having 
to teach FAS 133 and IAS 39 and IFRS 9 should make accounting professors jump 
for joy.

 

 No More Lease-Versus-Buy Accounting 
There really is no more need for Lease-Versus-Buy accounting or even lease 
accounting in general since the government owns all the assets.

 

 Conclusion 
By now I think you get the idea, so I won&apos;t belabor my discussion of curriculum 
changes any further. Socialist schools of accountancy, however, face an even 
bigger problem. If all workers in an egalitarian system receive identical wages 
or rations, what is the incentive to study 22 boring courses in governmental 
accounting and auditing?

That&apos;s a problem that socialism theorists have never been able to solve with 
the Marxist Labor Theory of Value. Presumably a symphony cellist who studies 
intensely for 14 years in music school should earn the same monthly wage as a 
brain surgeon who studies intensely for 14 years in medical school. But that may 
lead to a great over supply cellists and an enormous under supply of brain 
surgeons.

At this point the pleasant dream of Paul Williams turns into a nightmare.
It may turn out that socialist economies might actually have to pay brain 
surgeons 1,000 times more than they pay cellists. But that has all sorts of 
ramifications when a poor cellist living in a tent by a stream looks up to a 
beautiful dacha at the top of the hill where a brain surgeon lives. This is 
probably another problem you should avoid in your Socialism Accounting Seminar, 
although it was an enormous problem in the Soviet Union when top surgeons and 
elite Communist Party members got all the nice country dachas.

Hence this all may be academic in a purist egalitarian Marxist system where 
nobody elects to major in boring old accounting or brain surgery unless wage 
differentials and (gasp) even black market profiteering returns to the socialism 
economy. There&apos;s no need for an accounting curriculum if there are no accounting 
students. It&apos;s much more fun to major in humanities or perhaps not even bother 
with school. Oh what a nightmare this is truly becoming for any egalitarian 
purist.

 

&quot; A Requiem for Marx ,&quot;by Frank E. Manuel, university professor emeritus at 
Brandeis University, in the spring issue of Daedalus 
 http://chronicle.com/article/A-Requiem-for-Marx/82253/ 
 
 For the suffering of Karl Marx the exile, we can 
 feel compassion; for his elaborate theoretical system, benign doubt and 
 perhaps selective approval; for the abominable practices instituted in his 
 name, loathing. A requiem for Marx cannot ignore the iniquities of his 
 offspring -- prophets and messiahs must share the blame for the excesses of 
 their followers -- but the banner that he unfurled need not be interred with 
 his bones. Even a skeptical utopian like myself can still believe in the 
 worth of t he guiding principle: from each according to his abilities, to 
 each according to his needs

 Recall that Lehman opted to record sales of poisoned securities in a 
questionable arms length sale to former employees in what was literally a 
situation where 100% of the sold securities would be returned at 5% or 8% higher 
prices.


As Lehman auditors, Ernst&amp;Young is now contending in a lawsuit that they had 
no choice to account for these as sales under FAS 140 even

 To the Point: Repo accounting amendments finalized 

 The Financial 
 Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) 
 today amended its guidance on accounting for repurchase 
 agreements. The amendments simplify the accounting by 
 eliminating the requirement that the transferor demonstrate it has adequate collateral to fund 
 substantially all the cost of purchasing replacement assets. As 
 a result, more arrangements could be accounted for as secured 
 borrowings rather than sales.

The attached To the Point summarizes what you need to 
 know about the new guidance. It is also available online. 
 
 
 
&quot; Fatal Risk: The Must-Read Story Of AIG&apos;s Downfall ,&quot;by John Hemton, Business Insider , April 18, 2011 ---
 http://www.businessinsider.com/fatal-risk-the-must-read-story-of-aigs-downfall-2011-4 
 There are dozens of books on the financial crisis: I 
 have read many of them and the Kindle samples for just about all of them. 
 There are only two I would recommend: those are Bethany McLean and Joe 
 Noceras excellent All the Devils are Here   and the much more 
 specifically detailed Fatal Risk from 
 Roddy Boyd. Roddy&apos;s book is solely concerned with the failure of AIG.

Both books start without any strong ideological preconceptions and let the 
 facts woven into a good story do the talking - and both wind up ambivalent 
 about many of the major players - with many players having human weaknesses 
 (gullibility, delusion, arrogance etc) but committing nothing that looks 
 like a strong case for criminal prosecution. Reading these you can see why 
 there are so few criminal prosecutions from the crisis. And you will also 
 see just how extreme the human failings that caused the crisis are.

&quot;Did Cisco Slip on Flip or Was Flip a Flop?&quot;by Rita McGrath, Harvard 
Business Review Blog , April 18, 2011 --- Click Here 
 http://blogs.hbr.org/hbr/mcgrath/2011/04/did-cisco-slip-on-flip-or-was-flip-a-flop.html?referral=00563&amp;cm_mmc=email-_-newsletter-_-daily_alert-_-alert_date&amp;utm_source=newsletter_daily_alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=alert_date 
 
 So riddle me this: A business that generates an 
 estimated $400 million in revenue, with 550 employees, and which sells an 
 iconic product that was regularly praised as a model of innovation, is going 
 to be shut down. In an analysis of Cisco&apos;s decision to shut down its Flip 
 video recorder division, the New York Times reported April 12, 2011, 
 that the networking giant had finally given up on a business that, at one 
 point, was destined to bring it to relevance in consumer markets (along with 
 networking gear company Linksys). The company was purchased just two years 
 ago for $590 million. 

 The story is a familiar one. Large organization 
 swallows up innovative smaller one, resulting eventually in the departure of 
 the acquired company&apos;s leadership, complaints that the large organization 
 doesn&apos;t understand what the small one is all about, lack of attention and 
 commitment to developing the small company&apos;s future technology, and eventual 
 disappearance of the small firm. It happens in technology all the time. 

 Theories on why Flip ...uh... flopped , abound. Did 
 smartphones with easy Internet access make its functionality obsolete? Is 
 running a consumer business simply not in the DNA of a company whose heart 
 and soul revolve around networking gear for corporate customers? That might 
 be an argument that Geoff Moore would make, in his well known distinction 
 between complex operations and high volume businesses (he&apos;s long said it&apos;s 
 extremely difficult to house both under a single corporate umbrella). Or 
 maybe analysts just hated Cisco&apos;s consumer strategy, and the company 
 struggled for too long to justify the acquisition. Or maybe they concluded 
 that the product had no future and just decided to bail, without even 
 attempting to find a buyer for the business. 

 One other theory is that, under the parental 
 umbrella, Flip was not really able to continue to develop the string of 
 innovations that would allow it to go beyond being just a small video camera 
 that would make it more relevant to people&apos;s lives. People that loved Flip 
 really loved it. And sales were up 15% over the prior year. Flip was also 
 the best-selling camcorder on Amazon. Despite these signs of relevance, the 
 good news was insufficient to keep it from the corporate chopping block. 

 Whatever the reason, the prognosis for using 
 small-company acquisitions to change the DNA of large, established ones 
 hasn&apos;t historically been very good. I guess we&apos;ll add the story of Flip to 
 that history.

I always read the Jr. Deputy&apos;s articles from beginning to end just to find the 
dirty words. Other readers like me will be disappointed in this article if they 
are primarily seeking dirty words. Sometimes I have to read through the reader 
comments she posts to find the dirtiest words. Her Jr. Deputy Accountant Blog dirty word posts are at http://www.jrdeputyaccountant.com/ 
The dirtiest words Adrienne can think of is&quot;Bernanke article&quot;which I think she 
views as tantamount to the fermented vomit of a brainless yak.

Adrienne writes a lot about the CPA examination, although I&apos;m not sure she&apos;s 
ever taken it. In her youth, however, she worked for a company selling CPA 
review materials. Actually she does have some good ideas about the CPA 
examination --- such as putting limits on the number of times failing candidates 
can retake the parts they keep failing.

Francine is pretty well known to subscribers of the AECM as a critic of the 
auditing profession and accounting firms in general ---
 http://retheauditors.com/ 
She also publishes regularly in her Forbes blog and plays Twick or Tweet 
on Twitter. I view her as an attack dog who&apos;s also a very good writer and knows 
more about the warts and festering boils of this profession than most anybody in 
international accountancy.

As a retired accounting professor, Dr. Bailey is a&quot;part-time&quot;Senior Policy 
Advisor to the National Policy and Strategy Group-Institutional Acceptance at 
Grant Thornton LLP. ---
 http://business.fullerton.edu/centers/ccrg/board/bailey.htm 

My very good friend Andy has been an accounting/AIS professor at various 
flagship universities, including the Universities of Maine, Purdue, Minnesota, 
Ohio State, Queensland, Illinois, and Arizona. At Illinois and Arizona he was 
also the accounting programs director. He also notched his gun as a former 
Deputy Chief Accountant at the SEC. I gave him his first job at the University 
of Maine, but then I whisked off for two years in a think tank on the Stanford 
Campus so that we did not have a lot of interaction together on the Maine 
campus. Andy is also a former President of the American Accounting Association 
and former Editor of The Accounting Review and the International 
Journal of Accounting .

Is is fair to pit an attack dog against a poor guy who can&apos;t keep a job?
My sympathies have always been with Andy&apos;s ever-loving and faithful wife Irene 
who, for most of her long-time marriage to Andy, hardly had time to unpack and 
then repack the boxes. Andy and Irene also have an absolutely brilliant prodigy, 
Drew, who does advanced research in physics.

In the Mckenna-Bailey debate on May 13 Francine will no doubt be on the 
attack with respect to auditing professionalism (read that lack thereof), and I 
expect Andy to provide some defense from perspectives learned while consulting 
with Grant Thornton. However, Andy is known as an advocate of accounting 
profession reforms. In 2008 he gave me permission to serve up one of his long&quot;letters&quot;(actually Andy has never written a short paper or short letter in his 
life).

Francine will bring up some bones that Andy won&apos;t like during the debate.

&quot; The Logic of Cutting Corporate Taxes ,&quot;by UC Berkeley Business 
Professor Laura D&apos;Andrea Tyson, The New York Times , April April 8, 2011 
---
 http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/ 
Full Article --- http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/08/the-logic-of-cutting-corporate-taxes/#more-106953 
 
 Corporate taxes - or rather their absence - have 
 jumped to the top of the news in recent weeks, even drawing humorous 
 commentary from Jon Stewart and Bill Maher. Many Americans are outraged to 
 learn that some profitable American corporations pay little or no taxes in 
 the United States, especially when corporate profits enjoyed their fastest 
 growth ever in 2010. 

 Shouldnt the government raise the corporate tax 
 rate to require corporations to contribute their fair share to deficit 
 reduction and to enhance the progressivity of the tax system? The answer is 
 no. 

 In todays world of mobile capital, increasing the 
 corporate tax rate would be a bad way to generate revenues for deficit 
 reduction, a bad way to increase the progressivity of the tax code and a bad 
 way to help American workers and their families .

 After the 1986 tax overhaul, the United States had 
 one of the lowest corporate tax rates among the advanced industrial 
 countries. Since then, these countries have been slashing their rates both 
 to attract investment by American and other foreign companies and to 
 discourage their own companies from shifting operations and profits to 
 foreign locations offering even lower tax rates. 

 The resulting race to the bottom in corporate tax 
 rates has made the United States a less attractive place for both domestic 
 and foreign investments, and that has encouraged American multinational 
 companies to shift more of their income abroad, in ways permitted by the 
 United States tax code. 

 The United States now has the highest corporate tax 
 rate of all developed countries - and is alone in its attempt to impose 
 taxes on the worldwide income of its resident corporations. All other 
 developed countries and most major emerging countries have adopted a 
 territorial system that exempts most foreign income of their resident 
 corporations from taxes.

&quot; Study Finds a Big Gap Between College Seniors&apos; Real and Perceived 
Learning ,&quot;by Peter Schmidt, Chronicle of Higher Education , April 11, 
2011 ---
 http://chronicle.com/article/Study-Finds-a-Big-Gap-Between/127087/ 

Jensen Comment
Students that face licensure examinations shortly after graduating, such as the 
CPA Examination, Nursing Examination, etc. often purchase review course 
materials or even enroll in post-graduate licensure examination coaching 
courses. These review materials and coaching courses can be both informative and 
misleading. If students find that their college courses left enormous gaps in 
what they need know for licensing examinations it might be a rude awakening in 
terms of their perceptions about what they learned for their chosen careers. But 
they should carefully examine the real intent of curriculum they chose in 
college and how well the college accomplished the goal set out in that 
curriculum.

The Other Side of the Coin
If graduates feel that they learned over 90% of what they need to know for their 
licensing examinations, their perceptions may be misleading about what they 
should&apos;ve gotten out of a college degree. College education is supposed to focus 
on much more than career training. If their particular colleges were strong on 
training and weak on educating then they may have been short changed for the 
long haul. For example, if an accounting, nursing, pharmacy, or engineering 
degree program provides terrific technical training courses for graduates who 
are lousy writers, terrible public speakers, and who learned almost nothing in 
color book history, literature, mathematics, and language courses, then there 
may indeed be a&quot;big gap between real and perceived learning.&quot;

Students who scored much higher on their SAT/ACT tests in high school than 
they did on their GRE or related graduate school admissions tests should 
question the value of college to their&quot;real learning.&quot;

&quot;FASB Addresses TDRs (Troubled Debt Restructurings), Heads Up from 
Deloitte, April 6, 2011 ---
 http://www.iasplus.com/usa/headsup/headsup1104tdr.pdf 
 
 Yesterday, the FASB issued ASU 2011-02 , which clarifies when a loan 
 modification or restructuring is considered a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). 
 The accounting for and disclosures about troubled assets (e.g., loans and 
 receivables)2 continue to be important to financial organizations as well as 
 to their investors and regulators. Recent focus has been on modifications3 
 made to loans. Under U.S. GAAP, when a loans terms4 have been modified, the 
 creditor (i.e., the lender) must evaluate whether the modification 
 represents a TDR. Possible effects of a conclusion that a modification is a 
 TDR include the following: 
 
 A lender may need to perform a different 
 impairment measurement analysis. 5 

 A lender would have to provide additional 
 financial statement disclosures. 6 
 
In evaluating whether a modification of a loan represents a TDR, an 
 entity must use judgment to determine whether (1) the debtor (i.e., the 
 borrower) is experiencing financial difficulty and (2) the lender has 
 granted a concession to the borrower. The complexity of this evaluation, 
 coupled with the increasing number of loan modifications, notably for 
 residential mortgages but also for commercial real estate loans during the 
 past year, prompted the FASB to develop additional guidance and clarify 
 existing TDR requirements. The ASU is intended to result in more consistent 
 identification of TDRs by lenders.
 
Key Provisions
 
Is a Debtor Experiencing Financial Difficulty?
 
 The ASU amends ASC 310-40 to include the indicators 
 from ASC 470-60 that a lender should consider in determining whether a 
 borrower is experiencing financial difficulties

The FAQa page discloses many items that should be carefully considered.

First, the program is not an online program. It is a residency program.

Second, the cost is very high --- nearly $100,000 plus room and board. No 
 tuition relief is given for Georgia residents.

Third, virtually all AACSB schools with accounting doctoral programs have 
 financial aid in a combination of teaching and research assistance that 
 pretty well eliminates tuition costs and defrays much of the room and board 
 cost. I don&apos;t think this a atypical DBA program is as generous in its 
 tuition, room, and board allowances (if there are any at all).

This program is a three-year program that is much lighter on research 
 education and hands-on research guidance. It&apos;s not at all clear that the 
 accounting programs in major universities will consider graduates from this 
 program to be fully qualified for the rigors of tenure track appointments 
 that have heavy research and publication requirements.

Since virtually all accounting programs in AACSB accredited schools are 
 4-6 year residency programs with GMAT admission requirements, I think this 
 3-year program without such requirements will make graduates second class 
 citizens unless they have some wonderful added credentials in government or 
 industry experience such as four-star generals or former CEOs of Fortune 500 
 companies or PhD degrees in science or humanities prior to entering this 
 program.

I&apos;m always dubious of graduate programs that do not require GRE, GMAT, or 
 equivalent admission test requirements.

It would seem that this program is designed to be a cash cow aimed at 
 continuing education of executives. As such is is more like some of the 
 European executive doctoral programs that do not pretend to compete with 
 rigorous research-oriented doctoral programs. Accordingly, I doubt that 
 graduates will find many opportunities in major U.S. universities having 
 research-oriented tenure track programs in accountancy.

Graduates in this program might have to apply for jobs as PQ faculty 
 rather then AQ faculty. PQ faculty often teach full time without being on 
 tenure tracks.

April 12, 2011 reply from Dana Hermanson
 
 Bob, 

 A colleague passed along the postings about the KSU 
 DBA program, and I wanted to share a few perspectives. I have been teaching 
 in the program for two years, have two of my students at the dissertation 
 stage, and have two more of my students at the end of their first year. I 
 also have taught the broader group of accounting and business DBA students. 

 When I first became involved with this program, I 
 had some uncertainties about a new program&apos;s potential quality level, focus, 
 etc. - concerns similar to some of those in your posting. Those 
 uncertainties have been resolved in a very, very positive manner, such that 
 I feel very good about our program and its potential contribution to 
 accounting academe. 

 In terms of the program, it is definitely not 
 designed to be like the European programs (continuing ed for executives), 
 but it also is not a traditional 4-6 year PhD program (frankly, the 4-6 year 
 commitment keeps most interested people out of accounting academe). The 
 program is 3 years, probably 30 hours per week, research focused, and 
 designed primarily for people with significant business experience (15-25 
 years) who want to become AQ faculty at KSU-type schools (or at less 
 research-intensive places). My understanding is that we dont use the GMAT 
 because it does not tell us much about the academic potential of students 
 who are older (e.g., 40-55 years old). 

 We already are beginning to place students in AQ, 
 tenure-track faculty positions in AACSB accredited schools - not R1 schools, 
 but places with a balanced emphasis on research and teaching. We believe 
 that this is a segment of the market that is crying out for AQ faculty, as 
 the large PhD schools often serve mainly each others&apos; needs for faculty. In 
 addition, such&quot;balanced&quot;schools appear to greatly value professional 
 experience - both for classroom purposes and for producing relevant 
 research. 

 I have found the DBA students to be outstanding, 
 far above what I expected. They bring years of experience, know what the 
 relevant questions are, and catch on very quickly. They are generating 
 working papers, and one of my students already has a publication, as well as 
 a dissertation grant from the IIA and a research grant from the IMA. I 
 expect their dissertations to lead to several significant publications, and 
 I am working on other projects and papers with the students as well. 

 As far as the financial side, the program is 
 expensive, but my understanding is that it&apos;s not a cash cow. We are keeping 
 the student #s consistent with our ability to serve them well. We involve 
 both KSU research faculty (in accounting, people such as Audrey Gramling, 
 Divesh Sharma, Vineeta Sharma, Dennis Chambers, Sri Ramamoorti) and Global 
 Scholars in the program. For example, Jeff Cohen at Boston College is 
 serving on a dissertation committee with me, as is Todd DeZoort at the Univ. 
 of Alabama. Both are leading researchers in the auditing field. 

 I hope this additional information is helpful. The 
 KSU DBA is a new model, and I am very excited to be working in this program. 
 And, I can assure you that I would not be involved in this program if I 
 thought it lacked rigor and quality. I also would have no interest in 
 working in a program that was not focused on producing AQ faculty who will 
 be productive researchers and excellent teachers.

Thank you for the update Dana.

May I post your comments on the AECM?

Is financial aid available to attract minority students? The program 
 seems well-suited to those students being helped by the KPMG Foundation 
 since it&apos;s designed to be completed in three years.

However, the KPMG Foundation&apos;s minority students, along with your 
 targeted-market executives, are not likely to have the mathematics, 
 statistics, and economics pre-requisites for doctoral program research 
 courses.

Do you offer these research preparation courses and does this add to the 
 three years of study? In a traditional 4-6 six year program these quant 
 courses are typically taught in the early years and are often the reason 
 these programs take 4-6 years.

It would also seem that your accounting DBA students must be CPAs or CMAs 
 before they are admitted to the program in order to complete the program in 
 three years. In the typical 4-6 year program students weak in accounting 
 background, such as former math and economics majors, must take 
 undergraduate financial, auditing, and tax courses before truly 
 matriculating into the graduate accounting courses.

Is your program attracting many Asian students who are typically strong 
 in math and weak in US financial, auditing, and tax courses? How long would 
 these applicants typically take to complete your DBA program?

Thanks,

Bob Jensen

Addendum
 
 Dana&apos;s answers are included below (I.m still 
 getting used to my new T-mail system that does its best to hide some 
 replies to messages). 

 It appears that the KSU DBA program with a 
 concentration in accountancy manages to maintain a three-year target 
 primarily by only admitting candidates who could teach accounting on a 
 PQ basis before earning the DBA, by admitting candidates who are not 
 seeking tenure track positions in R1 research universities (and thereby 
 minimizing the quantitative methods courses and doctoral theses required 
 in other North American accounting doctoral programs), and by targeting 
 executives not in need of financial aid like nearly all accounting 
 doctoral candidates in other North American accounting doctoral 
 programs. 

 It would appear that this DBA program prepares 
 accounting professors much, much better than the AACSB Bridge Program 
 except for bridge candidates who already have both strong accounting 
 backgrounds plus quantitative methods backgrounds such as CPAs who also 
 have mathematics, statistics, or social science PhD degrees and want to 
 bridge into AQ teaching and research in accounting programs.

 My understanding is that there is not financial

 through the KSU Financial Aid office to explore their options. Also, my 
 guess is that the KSU DBA students are, on average, much more senior 
 than the people coming through the KPMG program. However, I will look 
 into this and would welcome the chance to collaborate with KPMG. 
 
&gt;&gt;However, the KPMG Foundation&apos;s minority students, along with your&gt;targeted-market executives, are not likely to have the mathematics,&gt;statistics, and economics pre-requisites for doctoral program research&gt;courses.&gt;&gt;&gt;Do you offer these research preparation courses and does this 
 add to the&gt;three years of study?&gt;In a traditional 4-6 six year program 
 these quant courses are typically&gt;taught in the early years and are often 
 the reason these programs take 4-6&gt;years.&gt;
 
 We have a heavy, hands-on quantitative methods 
 sequence in the early part of our program. All students take this 
 sequence, and it is part of our 3 year program. Joe Hair (a leading 
 quant methods person in marketing, formerly at LSU) has designed this 
 sequence and teaches much of it. In addition, the students get more 
 discipline-specific quant training in the seminars. 

 To date, the accounting students have 
 gravitated primarily toward auditing and corporate governance research 
 topics, where our faculty is concentrated, and many of the students are 
 pursuing behavioral/experimental research. As a result, the quantitative 
 dimension is less overwhelming than if the students were pursuing 
 traditional financial accounting research targeted at TAR and JAR, which 
 often involves very advanced econometric techniques. I have been careful 
 to communicate to the students the strength of our faculty (mainly 
 auditing and governance but coming on strong in financial with some 
 recent hires) and the challenges of competing at the top-tier level in 
 financial accounting research. I encourage them to think about their 
 backgrounds, professional contacts, etc. and leverage those to produce 
 unique research. This is the strategy I have used personally. 
 
&gt;&gt;It would also seem that your accounting DBA students must be CPAs or 
 CMAs&gt;before they are admitted to the program in order to complete the 
 program in&gt;three years. In the typical 4-6 year program students weak in 
 accounting&gt;background, such as former math and economics majors, must take&gt;undergraduate financial, auditing, and tax courses before truly&gt;matriculating into the graduate accounting courses.
 
 Yes, the students are exceptionally strong in 
 accounting (they certainly know more accounting than I do!). For 
 example, one of the Cohort 1 accounting students is a former CEO and 
 CFO, has an MBA from Columbia Univ., and currently serves as an audit 
 committee chair for a public company. Another Cohort 1 accounting 
 student was a CPA firm partner for many years and has recently served as 
 a bank director and audit committee member. She has taught as a lecturer 
 at a university for the past several years. The third Cohort 1 
 accounting student has worked in a variety of financial management and 
 systems positions with the University System of Ga. See http://coles.kennesaw.edu/graduate/dba/student-profiles.htm 
 for additional information on the students. These students have all the 
 practical accounting expertise they need, and we are teaching them to do 
 research on questions of interest to them. 
 
&gt;&gt;&gt;Is your program attracting many Asian students who are typically 
 strong in&gt;math and weak in US financial, auditing, and tax courses?&gt;How 
 long would these applicants typically take to complete your DBA program?
 
 To date, this has not been the profile of our 
 students, as our students are those with 15-25 years of business 
 experience looking to transition into academe (several have been 
 teaching as lecturers in recent years and see the need to become AQ). I 
 would expect that an international student with limited exposure to U.S. 
 accounting would be much better served in a traditional Ph.D. program. 
 Our program is designed for people with significant accounting practice 
 experience. 
 
&quot; CAQ Reacts to SECs SOX Section 404(b) Study ,&quot; Center for Audit 
Quality , April 25, 2011 ---
 http://www.thecaq.org/newsroom/release_04252011.htm 
 
 The Center for Audit 
 Quality (CAQ) issued the following statement from Executive Director Cindy 
 Fornelli regarding the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions (SEC) Study 
 and Recommendations on Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 For 
 Issuers With Public Float Between $75 and $250 Million, as required by the 
 Dodd-Frank Act: 

 I am pleased that the SECs Office 
 of the Chief Accountants thoughtful study recommends retention of Section 
 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act for companies whose market capitalization 
 is between $75 and $250 million. Section 404(b) requires independent 
 auditors to attest to managements assessment of the effectiveness of its 
 internal controls over financial reporting (ICFR). 

 The study concluded that costs of 
 Section 404(b) compliance have declined and financial reporting is more 
 reliable when the auditor is involved with ICFR assessments. Importantly, 
 the study found that investors generally view the auditors attestation on 
 ICFR as beneficial. Finally, we are happy to see that there is no conclusive 
 evidence linking the requirements of Section 404(b) to listing decisions of 
 the studied range of issuers. 

 The CAQ, joined by the Council of 
 Institutional Investors, filed a comment last September with the SEC fully 
 supporting retention of 404(b). We hope this study will effectively 
 discourage further discussions around ways to dilute the investor 
 protections contained in Sarbanes-Oxley.

 http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/audit-quality-at-risk-in-canada-regulator-warns/article1990133/ 
Thank you Jerry Trites for the heads up.
 
 Canadas accounting firms are facing growing pressure from 
 companies to cut their audit fees despite a warning it could lower the 
 quality of financial disclosure. 

 Brian Hunt, chief executive officer of the Canadian Public 
 Accountability Board, said companies in Europe and the United States have 
 been demanding auditors make significant cuts to their annual fees, and the 
 trend has shown up in Canada since the economic crisis in 2008 and 2009. 

 A lot of folks are feeling the company is under 
 pressure, and one way we can save is to reduce the audit fee, Mr. Hunt said 
 in an interview Monday. The audit committees [of boards] are just asking 
 for an arbitrary 30- or 40-per-cent cut. What audit committees have to do 
 is step back and think about what theyre doing. 

 Mr. Hunt said CPAB, which inspects Canadas audit 
 firms annually, has no problem with companies negotiating lower fees in a 
 competitive market, but said some companies have demanded cuts of up to 
 one-third in their annual audit fees, sparking concern that audit quality 
 will suffer. 

 Audit firms cannot easily slash their services 
 because they must meet acceptable standards or risk being sanctioned by CPAB, 
 Mr. Hunt said. Instead, to absorb the lost revenue they will reduce staff 
 training or hire fewer young auditors. 

 The result, he said, is that a companys audit may 
 not suffer in the first year, but quality will degrade over time with 
 reductions in training and staff.

 Responding to shareholder criticism, General 
 Electric Co. agreed to put new conditions on two million stock options 
 granted to Chief Executive Jeff Immelt a year ago. 

 The options, which GE says were valued at $7.4 
 million when granted in March 2010, will now only vest if the company 
 successfully boosts its industrial businesses and delivers shareholder 
 returns, including stock appreciation and dividends, that are as good or 
 better than those of the Standard&amp;Poor&apos;s 500-stock index. 

 &quot;Some shareholders have expressed the view that 
 additional performance conditions should be applied to Mr. Immelt&apos;s 2010 
 stock option award,&quot;GE said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange 
 Commission. 

 The move underscores the pressure on Mr. Immelt to 
 get the company growing again, as well as shareholders&apos; increasing clout 
 regarding matters of executive compensation. GE&apos;s decision comes ahead of 
 the company&apos;s annual meeting next week, when shareholders will cast a 
 nonbinding vote on GE&apos;s pay practices. 

 The options grant was unusual for GE, which last 
 granted Mr. Immelt options in 2002 and afterward shifted to equity awards 
 based on measurable performance targets. The company said the 2010 award was 
 intended to&quot;increase the equity-based portion of his compensation&quot;and to 
 express confidence in the CEO. 

 Institutional Shareholder Services, which advises 
 mutual funds and other shareholders about how to vote on corporate matters, 
 criticized the grant for not being sufficiently pegged to GE&apos;s performance. 

 In light of the new conditions, ISS dropped its 
 objections and recommended that shareholders vote to support GE&apos;s pay 
 practices. 

 Under the new terms, 50% of the options will vest 
 only if the company pulls in cumulative industrial cash flow from operating 
 activities of at least $55 billion between the start of 2011 and the end of 
 2014. The other half will vest only if GE&apos;s total shareholder return is 
 equal to or better than that of the S&amp;P 500 over the same period. 

 Mr. Immelt is one of just 10 CEOs who got more than 
 one million options last yearincluding two who received bigger grants than 
 his, according to an analysis of the latest proxy statements by Hay Group 
 for The Wall Street Journal. The consultancy looked at 320 CEOs of major 
 U.S. corporations, of whom 232 received option awards in 2010.

&quot; Ernst&amp;Young must face class action over Broadcom&apos;s option backdating ,&quot;by Carol J. Williams, Los Angeles Times , April 14, 2011 ---
 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/money_co/2011/04/ernst-young-broadcom-options-backdating-scheme-class-action-appeals-court.html 
 
 A federal appeals court Thursday reinstated a 
 class-action lawsuit filed by Broadcom Corp. investors against Ernst&amp;Young, saying the auditors should have known about an option-backdating 
 scheme at the Irvine tech company. 

 A lower-court judge had dismissed the case against 
 Ernst&amp;Young after concluding the plaintiffs hadnt shown that the auditors 
 knew that the value of Broadcoms stock was probably inflated by the 
 companys manipulation of its financial statements. 

 Thursdays ruling by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of 
 Appeals in San Francisco reversed that dismissal and scolded Ernst&amp;Young 
 for not acting to stop the $2.2-billion backdating scheme. 

 Ernst&amp;Young&quot;apparently accepted management at 
 its word, never received requested documentation and issued an unqualified 
 opinion on the accuracy of Broadcoms financial statements,&quot;the 9th Circuit 
 panel ruled in overturning the lawsuits dismissal by U.S. District Judge 
 Manuel L. Real in Los Angeles. 

 Ernst&amp;Youngs audit&quot;amounted to no audit at 
 all,&quot;the appeals court said. 

 A spokesman for Ernst&amp;Young declined to comment

 Issues in Computing a College&apos;s Cost

April 7, 2011 reply from Bob Jensen
 
Hi Francine

I think the title put on this by Huffington Post is 
 misleading. The&quot;worth&quot;of somebody in a profession must focus as 
 much or even more on the worth of the benefits of that person 
 vis-a-vis the cost. My wife had four (soon to be five) very 
 expensive surgeries from one of the outstanding spine surgeons in 
 the world. We can aggregate the cost of this Boston surgeon&apos;s 
 billings, but how in the world would we ever measure his benefit or 
 worth?
 http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/Erika2007.htm 

Incidentally he&apos;s also one of the most important surgical residency 
 teachers in the shadows of the Harvard Medical School. Residents 
 seek him out because he&apos;s such a superb teacher. How do we 
 measure the value of his contributions to the future surgeries 
 performed by all the surgical residents who&apos;ve worked closely with 
 this surgeon?

Similarly we can aggregate the cost of having Dennis Beresford for 
 14 years at the University of Georgia. But how in the world would we 
 ever measure his&quot;worth?&quot;How do we measure the value of his 
 contributions to all the accounting students who&apos;ve worked closely 
 with this remarkable professor of accountancy?.

Of course we could also argue that the benefit of 23-year old Ms. 
 Kinder teaching kindergarten in South Chicago is invaluable. About 
 the only way we have of comparing a unique Harvard spine surgeon 
 with a kindergarten teacher is how much it takes to replace them 
 with professionals having comparable skills. I would argue that Ms. 
 Kinder can be replaced for a whole lot less money than my wife&apos;s 
 very uniquely qualified spine surgeon.

However, comparing their annual compensation is only a very, very 
 rough way to measure&quot;worth&quot;to society. Like you, I hesitate to 
 conclude that the&quot;worth&quot;of Stanley O&apos;Neal was the $160 million it 
 took to get him out the door. Compensation is confounded by a whole 
 lot of factors other than societal&quot;worth.&quot;
.
 &quot;Stanley O&apos;Neal who is leaving Merrill 
 Lynch after giving it a big fat gift of a $8 billion dollar 
 write-off thanks to risky investments. The board just can&apos;t help but 
 feed this obesity epidemic. They&apos;re giving him $160 million plus in 
 severance for his troubles as he heads for the door. At some point, 
 the nation&apos;s corporations, or most pointedly, their corporate 
 boards, will realize throwing money at their CEOs is probably not 
 the best idea&quot;

parts. First assign the case below. Then assign student teams to write a case on 
how to compute the cost of a given course, graduate in a given program, or a 
comparison of a the cost of a distance education section versus an onsite 
section of a given course taught by a tenured faculty member teaching three 
courses in general as well as conducting research, performing internal service, 
and performing external service in his/her discipline.

TOPICS: Contribution Margin, Cost Management, Managerial Accounting


SUMMARY: The article describes a contribution margin review at Texas A&amp;M 
 University drilled all the way down to the faculty member level. Also 
 described are review systems in place in California, Indiana, Minnesota, 
 Michigan, Ohio and other locations.
CLASSROOM APPLICATION: Managerial concepts of efficiency, contribution 
 margin, cost management, and the managerial dashboard in university settings 
 are discussed in this article.


QUESTIONS:
1. (Introductory) Summarize the reporting on Texas A&amp;M University&apos;s Academic 
 Financial Data Compilation. Would you describe this as putting a&quot;price&quot;on 
 professors or would you use some other wording? Explain.

2. (Introductory) What is the difference between operational efficiency and&quot;academic efficiency&quot;?

3. (Advanced) Review the table entitled&quot;Controversial Numbers: Cash Flow at 
 Texas A&amp;M.&quot;Why do you think that Chemistry, History, and English 
 Departments are more likely to generate positive cash flows than are 
 Oceanography, Physics and Astronomy, and Aerospace Engineering?

4. (Introductory) What source of funding for academics is excluded from the 
 table review in answer to question 3 above? How do you think that funding 
 source might change the scenario shown in the table?

5. (Advanced) On what managerial accounting technique do you think 
 Minnesota&apos;s state college system has modeled its method of assessing 
 campuses&apos; performance?

6. (Advanced) Refer to the related article. A large part of cost increases 
 in university education stem from dormitories, exercise facilities, and 
 other building amenities on campuses. What is your reaction to this parent&apos;s 
 statement that universities have&quot;acquiesced to the kids&apos; desire to go to 
 school at luxury resorts&quot;?

 Letters to the Editor: What Is It That We Want Our Universities to Be?

 Carol Johnson took the podium of a lecture hall one 
 recent morning to walk 79 students enrolled in an introductory biology 
 course through diffusion, osmosis and the phospholipid bilayer of cell 
 membranes. 

 A senior lecturer, Ms. Johnson has taught this 
 class for years. Only recently, though, have administrators sought to 
 quantify whether she is giving the taxpayers of Texas their money&apos;s worth. 

 A 265-page spreadsheet, released last month by the 
 chancellor of the Texas A&amp;M University system, amounted to a profit-and-loss 
 statement for each faculty member, weighing annual salary against students 
 taught, tuition generated, and research grants obtained. 

 Ms. Johnson came out very much in the black; in the 
 period analyzed—fiscal year 2009—she netted the public university $279,617. 
 Some of her colleagues weren&apos;t nearly so profitable. Newly hired assistant 
 professor Charles Criscione, for instance, spent much of the year setting up 
 a lab to research parasite genetics and ended up $45,305 in the red. 

 The balance sheet sparked an immediate uproar from 
 faculty, who called it misleading, simplistic and crass—not to mention, 
 riddled with errors. But the move here comes amid a national drive, backed 
 by some on both the left and the right, to assess more rigorously what, 
 exactly, public universities are doing with their students—and their tax 
 dollars. 

 

 As budget pressures mount, legislators and 
 governors are increasingly demanding data proving that money given to 
 colleges is well spent. States spend about 11% of their general-fund budgets 
 subsidizing higher education. That totaled more than $78 billion in fiscal 
 year 2008, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers. 

 The movement is driven as well by dismal 
 educational statistics. Just over half of all freshmen entering four-year 
 public colleges will earn a degree from that institution within six years, 
 according to the U.S. Department of Education. 

 And among those with diplomas, just 31% could pass 
 the most recent national prose literacy test, given in 2003; that&apos;s down 
 from 40% a decade earlier, the department says. 

 &quot;For years and years, universities got away with, 
 &apos;Trust us—it&apos;ll be worth it,&apos;&quot;said F. King Alexander, president of 
 California State University at Long Beach. 

 But no more:&quot;Every conversation we have with these 
 institutions now revolves around productivity,&quot;says Jason Bearce, associate 
 commissioner for higher education in Indiana. He tells administrators it&apos;s 
 not enough to find efficiencies in their operations; they must seek&quot;academic efficiency&quot;as well, graduating more students more quickly and 
 with more demonstrable skills. The National Governors Association echoes 
 that mantra; it just formed a commission focused on improving productivity 
 in higher education. 

 This new emphasis has raised hackles in academia. 
 Some professors express deep concern that the focus on serving student&quot;customers&quot;and delivering value to taxpayers will turn public colleges into 
 factories. They worry that it will upend the essential nature of a 
 university, where the Milton scholar who teaches a senior seminar to five 
 English majors is valued as much as the engineering professor who lands a 
 million-dollar research grant. 

 And they fear too much tinkering will destroy an 
 educational system that, despite its acknowledged flaws, remains the envy of 
 much of the world.&quot;It&apos;s a reflection of a much more corporate model of 
 running a university, and it&apos;s getting away from the idea of the university 
 as public good,&quot;says John Curtis, research director for the American 
 Association of University Professors. 

 Efforts to remake higher education generally fall 
 into two categories. In some states, including Ohio and Indiana, public 
 officials have ordered a new approach to funding, based not on how many 
 students enroll but on what they accomplish.

This case is one of the most difficult cases that managerial and cost 
accountants will ever face. It deals with ugly problems where joint and indirect 
costs are mind-boggling. For example, when producing mathematics graduates in 
undergraduate and graduate programs, the mathematics department plays an even 
bigger role in providing mathematics courses for other majors and minors on 
campus. Furthermore, the mathematics faculty provides resources for internal 
service to administration, external service to the mathematics profession and 
the community, applied research, basic research, and on and on and on. Faculty 
resources thus become joint product resources.

Furthermore costing faculty time is not exactly the same as costing the time 
of a worker that adds a bumper to each car in an assembly line. While at home in 
bed going to sleep or awakening in bed a mathematics professor might hit upon a 
Eureka moment where time spent is more valuable than the whole previous lifetime 
of that professor spent in working on campus. How do to factor in hours spent 
in bed in CVP analysis and Cost-Benefit analysis ? Work sampling and 
time-motion studies used in factory systems just will not work well in academic 
systems.

In Cost-Profit-Volume analysis the multi-product CPV model is 
incomprehensible without making a totally unrealistic assumption that&quot;sales 
mix&quot;parameters are constant for changing levels of volume. Without this 
assumption for many&quot;products&quot;the solution to the CPV model blows our minds.

Another really complicating factor in CVP and C-B analysis are semi-fixed 
costs that are constant over a certain time frame (such as a semester or a year 
for adjunct employees) but variable over a longer horizon. Of course over 
a very long horizon all fixed costs become variable, but this generally destroys 
the benefit of a CVP analysis in the first place. One problem is that faculty 
come in non-tenured adjunct, non-tenured tenure-track, and tenured varieties.

I could go on and on about why I would never attempt to do CVP or C-B 
research for one of the largest universities of the world. But somebody at 
Texas A&amp;M has rushed in where angels fear to tread .

 Computing a College&apos;s Cost of a College 
Degree: 
This illustrates problems managerial accountants face when estimating various 
types of costs in industry 

&quot;What Does a Degree Cost?&quot;by Doug 
 Lederman, Inside Higher Ed , May 19, 2009 --- http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/05/19/degree 
 
 College tuition 
 prices keep rising. State budgets are stagnant or shrinking. And 
 policy makers, from President Obama on down, are increasingly 
 calling for increases in the number of Americans who get some higher 
 education or training. 

 Those factors have 
 led more state legislators, trustees and others to argue that, to 
 accomplish the latter goal given the former circumstances, colleges 
 are going to have to lower what they spend to produce the average 
 credential they award. But any discussion of lowering the&quot;cost per 
 degree&quot;must start with a more fundamental question: What does a 
 degree cost to produce now? 

 That question 
 may be basic, but it is not simple, as a new report from the Delta Project on 
 Postsecondary Education Costs, Productivity, and Accountability 
 makes clear. The paper, prepared by Nate Johnson, associate director 
 of institutional planning and research at the University of Florida, 
 lays out a range of possible approaches to calculating the cost of a 
 college degree and then calculates them using a rich set of data 
 from the State University System of Florida, where Johnson formerly 
 worked. 

 The paper shows that 
 it is distinctly possible to come up with such a figure, but the 
 wide variation in the numbers -- based on institution type, program, 
 degree level, and other factors -- suggests that the answer will 
 depend in large part on how the question is framed. And that 
 decision is a surprisingly value-laden one, says Johnson.&quot;You frame 
 the question one way if you are only interested in students who 
 graduate, and another way if you want to know the cost for people 
 who go to college and don&apos;t complete,&quot;he says.&quot;The point is, this 
 is not just a data question. It&apos;s a question of what it is that we 
 want from our colleges and universities.&quot; 

 The broad work of 
 the Delta Project and its founder, Jane Wellman, is to analyze the&quot;spending side&quot;of the higher education cost and price picture; the 
 group has released a series of reports that try to document the 
 interplay of colleges&apos; revenues and expenditures, and how those 
 trends affect what they charge to students. The new study, which 
 grew out of Johnson&apos;s work in Florida, he says, aims to develop a&quot;common language,&quot;if not a common format, for focusing the 
 discussion about how one might measure the cost of a degree in a 
 particular institution, system or state. Toward that end, Johnson 
 proposes several possible ways of calculating the average cost of a 
 degree. 

 The analyses are 
 based on data showing that the Florida university system incurred an 
 average of $288 in direct and indirect instructional expenditures 
 per credit hour, with wide variation by level ($188 for lower 
 division undergraduate, $537 for master&apos;s, etc.), institution ($240 
 for an upper level undergraduate credit at the massive University of 
 Central Florida, $677 for the same credit at the 700-student New 
 College), and field of study ($159 in family/consumer sciences, $509 
 for natural resources/conservation). The analysis counts only those 
 expenditures derived from state appropriations and student tuition, 
 excluding endowment and other funds. 

 The first estimate, 
 which Johnson calls the&quot;catalog cost,&quot;calculates what a college 
 would spend to educate a student who fulfills the&quot;catalog 
 requirements&quot;of the average degree to the letter -- no more, no 
 less. (The equation: cost per credit hour x instructional 
 expenditures/credit hours.) The average cost is $26,485, with 
 institutions within the Florida system ranging from $22,440 to 
 nearly double that. Johnson also found significant variation by 
 field because of vastly different requirements and program length, 
 with mechanical engineering averaging $37,870 vs. $27,159 for 
 elementary education. 

 The catalog method 
 is easily understood, but it&quot;does not reflect actual student 
 behavior,&quot;Johnson notes. More accurate in gauging how students 
 actually maneuver through institutions, he writes, is the&quot;transcript method&quot;of cost analysis, in which the total number of 
 credit hours students take are multiplied by the cost per credit 
 hour, and then divided by the number of degrees awarded. The average 
 freshman who entered a Florida system university and graduated in 
 2003-4&quot;attempted&quot;131 credits, including failed or withdrawn 
 courses and subtracting for any AP or dual enrollment courses that 
 reduced their course requirements. 

 The average&quot;transcript cost,&quot;then, was $31,763; converting to 2006 dollars, to 
 make parallel to the figures from the&quot;catalog cost&quot;analysis, 
 Johnson writes, the average figure is $33,672. (The 2003-4 figure 
 for mechanical engineering was $47,257.) 

 Both the catalog and 
 transcript cost methods factor into the calculation only those costs 
 incurred by students who actually graduate. The third major 
 analysis,&quot;full cost attribution,&quot;examines the entire amount that 
 an institution or system spent on instructional purposes to achieve 
 an&quot;aggregate level of degree completion.&quot;The equation looks like 
 this: all credits taken at an institution over three years x the 
 three-year average cost per credit hour/three years of degrees. 

 Not surprisingly, 
 because all courses taken by all students would be allocated to the 
 smaller proportion who actually earned degrees, this produces the 
 highest cost per degree number; $37,757 in 2002-3 dollars, 
 equivalent to $40,645 in 2005-6, Johnson writes. This analysis grows 
 less predictable and valid the more narrowly it is drawn, he adds, 
 because programs with high attrition, or into which many students 
 transfer late in the game, can have their figures drastically 
 altered. The overall high and low for the Florida university system, 
 for example, were $170,831 for&quot;multidisciplinary studies&quot;and 
 $21,473 for parks and recreation, and the variation by degree level 
 was enormous: $33,425 for a law degree, $259,781 for an M.D., and 
 $121,725 for a doctorate. 

 So which is the most 
 accurate assessment of what a university spends to educate a 
 graduate? The catalog cost of $26,485, the transcript cost of 
 $33,672, or the&quot;full cost&quot;$40,645? The last is&quot;probably closer to 
 an answer&quot;to the question that policy makers are increasingly 
 asking now, about&quot;what would we have to spend to get more 
 graduates,&quot;though that assumes that colleges maintained their 
 current enrollment and expenditure levels, he notes. 

 But the other key 
 point, Johnson says, is that the choice of how you measure cost 
 depends, to an extent, on how you perceive the role of colleges. 
 Using the&quot;full cost&quot;measure, he asserts, more or less says that 
 most of what a university does is designed to educate students, and 
 that&quot;all of those costs could be attributed to the cost of 
 producing college graduates,&quot;as overhead, he says. 

 &quot;If you highly value 
 research or public service,&quot;though,&quot;you could almost say that the 
 graduates are free -- a byproduct&quot;of what you spend on those other 
 purposes.

&quot;Dollars Flow Back Into Tech,&quot;by: Spencer E. Ante and Don Clark, The Wall

 Two of the world&apos;s largest technology vendors 
 surprised Wall Street by posting surging sales and profits in the 
 first-quarter, and signaled brighter days ahead. 

 International Business Machines Corp. and Intel 
 Corp. both saw a big boost in spending from businesses, especially on 
 servers and machines used in corporate data centers. 

 IBM logged the highest revenue growth the company 
 has seen in 10 years, adjusting for currency fluctuations. Its quarterly 
 revenue rose 7.7%, as demand for a new mainframe computer lifted hardware 
 sales 19%. 

 Intel had a strong quarter, including a 34% jump in 
 profit and revenue growth of 25%. The company benefited from sales of chips 
 used in server systems and other hardware for computer rooms, and revenue 
 rose 32% in that business. 

 But Intel sales also rose 17% for chips used in 
 personal computers, contradicting estimates by two market research firms 
 last week and a perception that sales of Apple Inc.&apos;s iPad are sapping 
 demand for notebook machines. 

 &quot;Notebooks are very good,&quot;said Paul Otellini, 
 Intel&apos;s chief executive, in an interview. While there was some weakness in 
 retail sales in the U.S. and Europe, he said, that shortfall was&quot;more than 
 offset&quot;by better-than-expected results from business and consumer customers 
 in other emerging markets, which include China and Brazil. 

 Shares of Intel jumped 4.9% to $20.84 in late 
 trading, while IBM shares fell 2.4% to $161.47. 

 Demand from enterprises was bolstered by comments 
 by corporate technology chiefs, who said they are increasing their focus on 
 mobile products and Web-based services. 

 Monte E. Ford, chief information officer of AMR 
 Corp., parent of American Airlines, said most of the company&apos;s tech spending 
 has gone towards building services that help employees and customers, such 
 as its wireless applications for smartphones and tablets. 

 &quot;The consumer is dictating where we go and what we 
 are doing,&quot;said Mr. Ford, noting AMR&apos;s overall budget was similar to last 
 year. 

 Sales continue to surge for smartphones and gadgets 
 from Apple Inc., which is expected to report a revenue leap of nearly 73% on 
 Wednesday. Chips from Intel and disk drives from Seagate Technologywhich 
 Tuesday reported an 82% drop in quarterly earningshaven&apos;t been used much in 
 such products. 

 But sales of large computers, including the server 
 systems that run websites and other corporate functions, are seeing solid 
 demand as companies set up or expand online applications.

&quot; Inflation Actually Near 10% Using Older Measure ,&quot;by John Melloy, CNBC , April 12, 2011 ---
 http://www.cnbc.com/id/42551209 
 
 After former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker 
 was appointed in 1979, the consumer price index surged into the double 
 digits, causing the now revered Fed Chief to double the benchmark interest 
 rate in order to break the back of inflation. Using the methodology in place 
 at that time puts the CPI back near those levels. 

 Inflation, using the reporting methodologies in 
 place before 1980, hit an annual rate of 9.6 percent in February, according 
 to the Shadow Government Statistics newsletter. 

 Since 1980, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has 
 changed the way it calculates the CPI in order to account for the 
 substitution of products, improvements in quality (i.e. iPad 2 costing the 
 same as original iPad) and other things. Backing out more methods 
 implemented in 1990 by the BLS still puts inflation at a 5.5 percent rate 
 and getting worse, according to the calculations by the newsletters web 
 site, Shadowstats.com. 

 Near-term circumstances generally have continued 
 to deteriorate, said John Williams, creator of the site, in a new note out 
 Tuesday. Though not yet commonly recognized, there is both an intensifying 
 double-dip recession and a rapidly escalating inflation problem. Until such 
 time as financial-market expectations catch up with underlying reality, 
 reporting generally will continue to show higher-than-expected inflation and 
 weaker-than-expected economic results in the month and months ahead. 

 The pay-site and newsletter by Williams, an 
 economic consultant for the last 30 years to companies, has gained a cult 
 following among bloggers hungry to criticize Bernanke these days. The 
 mission statement of the newsletter, according to the site, is to expose and 
 analyze flaws in current U.S. government economic data and reportingnet of 
 financial-market and political hype. 

 Investors are anxiously awaiting the release of 
 Marchs CPI reading on Friday. The consensus estimate from economists is for 
 an annual inflation rate of 2.6 percent. 

 Given ongoing inflation problems with food and the 
 spreading impact of higher oil-related costs in the broad economy, reporting 
 risk is to the upside of consensus expectation, said Williams, citing a 10 
 percent jump in gasoline prices in March, in the note. 

 While the federal government would have us believe 
 the numbers are rather tame, our own personal gauge leads us to believe 
 inflation is running between 5 percent to 6 percent annually, wrote Alan 
 Newman in his latest Crosscurrents newsletter that refers to Williams 
 statistics.

&quot; Why People Pay Income Taxes ,&quot;by Casey B. Mulligan, The New York 
Times (Economix), April 6, 2011 ---
 http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/06/why-people-pay-income-taxes/?ref=business 
 
 Millions of taxpayers are filling out their tax 
 returns over the next several days. Economists are still not sure whether 
 taxpayer honesty or fear of the Internal Revenue Service explains why 
 taxpayers income reporting is pretty accurate. 

 But with the Treasury spending more than ever, 
 its important to know why people pay their taxes and what will continue to 
 motivate them to pay in the future. 

 Its difficult to get exact numbers on income tax 
 cheating, but I.R.S. studies (read about them and other tax-evasion analysis 
 in Prof. Joel Slemrods paper) suggest that reporting of wages and salaries 
 is so high that the Treasury receives 99 percent of what it would if all 
 taxpayers were honest about that income (see Page 2 of this I.R.S. report). 

 You might think that people pay taxes merely to 
 stay out of trouble with the I.R.S. But 99 percent of people are not audited 
 by the I.R.S., and even the remaining 1 percent are penalized only about 10 
 percent of the amount underpaid. (The I.R.S. is, however, increasing its 
 audits of the wealthy.) 

 From a financial point of view, underpaying taxes 
 looks like a high expected return investment: a 99 percent chance of keeping 
 the, say, $10,000 that you underpaid the Treasury and a 1 percent chance of 
 having to pay the $10,000 plus a $1,000 penalty (on average, you get $9,790 
 for every $10,000 you hold back from the Treasury). 

 Some economists have tried to reconcile low 
 penalties with high compliance, arguing that people obey the tax laws for 
 non-economic reasons people want to be honest and pay their share. Or 
 perhaps individuals dont understand that any one persons tax payment is 
 not critical to the functioning of our government, while the aggregate of 
 millions of tax payments are. 

 To the extent that much of the Treasurys revenue 
 arrives because taxpayers are honest, public policy might not want to take 
 honesty for granted. For example, the Treasury may receive less revenue over 
 time if taxpayers increasingly distrust government because they perceive 
 their tax dollars are wasted. 

 Theres some truth to the honesty theory (Ill 
 write next week about a study of integrity and tax compliance), but tax 
 compliance still responds to incentives. When the probability of audit 
 falls, compliance falls. 

 Its difficult for the I.R.S. to verify many types 
 of business income: as a result the amount of proprietor, rent and royalty 
 income that is reported is actually less than the amount unreported. 

 Nanny taxes - self-employment taxes paid for 
 household employees - are another type of tax on which many people cheat, 
 and enforcement on this front is weak. Though on this and other tax issues, 
 high-profile people - like political appointees - should beware. 

 Among those whose failure to pay various taxes were 
 widely publicized were Tom Daschle, President Obamas nominee as secretary 
 of health and human services; Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, and Zoe 
 Baird, President Clintons nominee for attorney general.

&quot;W ho Cheats on Their Taxes? &quot;by Casey B. Mulligan, The New York 
Times (Economix), April 13, 2011 ---
 http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/13/who-cheats-on-their-taxes/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss 

Jensen Comment
Note that there&apos;s a huge difference between&quot;cheating&quot;and playing by the rules 
to minimize/avoid taxation. Cheating is especially common in trades where cash 
is paid without filing W-2 or 1099 forms such as paying house cleaners for a few 
hours work per week, hiring day laborers off the streets, cash tipping, paying 
guys who plow snow from your driveway, and crime dealings, including drug 
dealings and prostitution. The IRS has made it increasingly more difficult to 
under report income. For example, most casinos now withhold taxes from 
significant winnings, although some players may walk away without reporting 
small winnings. House cleaners now may want to have their earnings reported for 
Social Security purposes.

Tax cheating and most financial crimes could be eliminated in a cashless 
world of all-electronic transfers, but don&apos;t hold your breath for our 
legislators to agree to that solution to crime. Too many of them might might be 
prevented tax cheating and crime in a cashless society. Smart criminals now are 
either avoiding bank accounts or laundering money before depositing it into bank 
accounts.

Tax cheating is much less of a problem in the U.S. than in most other nations 
such as Greece and Italy where tax cheating is virtually a way of life. Studies 
show that most U.S. taxpayers have greatly exaggerated fears of full tax audits, 
which is comes as a delight to tax collectors who better understand the real 
odds of being audited. Of course there are those pesky partial audits and the 
things taxpayers can do to increase the odds of a partial audit such as taking a 
huge deduction for a home office. Many people are likely to overpay taxes out of 
fear of audits such as people who qualify for more deductions than they actually 
declare simply to avoid the stress of worrying about letters from the IRS.

&quot; How to Pay No Taxes Eleven shelters, dodges, and rollsall perfectly 
legalused by America&apos;s wealthiest people ,&quot;by Jesse Dricker, Business 
Week , April 7, 2011 ---
 http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_16/b4224045265660.htm?link_position=link2  
 
 For the well-off, this could be the best tax day 
 since the early 1930s: Top tax rates on ordinary income, dividends, estates, 
 and gifts will remain at or near historically low levels for at least the 
 next two years. That&apos;s thanks in part to legislation passed in December 2010 
 by the 111th Congress and signed by President Barack Obama. 

 &quot;This is clearly far and away the most generous tax 
 situation that&apos;s existed,&quot;says Gregory D. Singer, a national managing 
 director of the wealth management group at AllianceBernstein (AB) in New 
 York.&quot;It&apos;s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.&quot; 

 For the 400 U.S. taxpayers with the highest 
 adjusted gross income, the effective federal income tax ratewhat they 
 actually payfell from almost 30 percent in 1995 to just under 17 percent in 
 2007, according to the IRS. And for the approximately 1.4 million people who 
 make up the top 1 percent of taxpayers, the effective federal income tax 
 rate dropped from 29 percent to 23 percent in 2008. It may seem too 
 fantastic to be true, but the top 400 end up paying a lower rate than the 
 next 1,399,600 or so. 

 That&apos;s not just good luck. It&apos;s often the result of 
 hard work, as suggested by some of the strategies in the following pages. 
 Much of the top 400&apos;s income is from dividends and capital gains, generated 
 by everything from appreciated real estateyes, there is some leftto stocks 
 and the sale of family businesses. As Warren Buffett likes to point out, 
 since most of his income is from dividends, his tax rate is less than that 
 of the people who clean his office. 

 The true effective rate for multimillionaires is 
 actually far lower than that indicated by official government statistics. 
 That&apos;s because those figures fail to include the additional income that&apos;s 
 generated by many sophisticated tax-avoidance strategies. Several of those 
 techniques involve some variation of complicated borrowings that never get 
 repaid, netting the beneficiaries hundreds of millions in tax-free cash. 
 From 2003 to 2008, for example, Los Angeles Dodgers owner and real estate 
 developer Frank H. McCourt Jr. paid no federal or state regular income 
 taxes, as stated in court records dug up by the Los Angeles Times. 
 Developers such as McCourt, according to a declaration in his divorce 
 proceeding,&quot;typically fund their lifestyle through lines of credit and loan 
 proceeds secured by their assets while paying little or no personal income 
 taxes.&quot;A spokesman for McCourt said he availed himself of a tax code 
 provision at the time that permitted purchasers of sports franchises to 
 defer income taxes. 

 For those who can afford a shrewd accountant or 
 attorney, our era is rife with opportunity to avoid, or at least defer, tax 
 bills, according to tax specialists and public records. It&apos;s limited only by 
 the boundaries of taste, creativity, and the ability to understand some very 
 complex shelters.

&quot; Slippery People: Corporate Governance at Berkshire Hathaway ,&quot;by Francine McKenna, re:TheAuditors , April 24, 2011 ---

 Warren 
 Buffet announced the sudden resignation of his heir apparent, David Sokol, 
 on March 30, 2011. Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, fundamental style value 
 investors , law professors , and the 
 business media have been talking about it ever since. However, Buffett doesnt want us to question him further and 
 is not willing to say anything more 
 
 I have 
 held back nothing in this statement. Therefore, if questioned about this 
 matter in the future, I will simply refer the questioner back to this 
 release. 
 
 The 
 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting is typically a marathon of openness and 
 transparency. Buffet has been known to stay on stage at the revival-style 
 event, this year scheduled for April 30, for up to eight hours. But 
 Berkshire Hathaway has an Achilles heel. Buffetts storied forthcoming 
 manner is not going to carry over to this case: 
 
 Alice Schroeder , author 
 of The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life: ORIGINALLY 
 I didnt think Buffett was going to entertain questions on this subject 
 at the meeting. I think hell talk about it for maybe five or ten 
 minutes in a statement at the beginning of the meeting, much of which 
 time will be a recap of what happened. He could then cite litigation as 
 a reason for why he cant have an open-ended discussion and take 
 questions. 
 
 Ive 
 written several articles about this case because it fascinates me to see an 
 iconic figure stumble. Call it schadenfreude . 
 Or just call it my natural cynicism. Either way, Im gratified that my first 
 hunch its not a case of insider trading but one of an agent/fiduciary 
 taking advantage of his trusted position to benefit himself first has been 
 ratified. 

 On April 
 4: I wrote, The Gnome of Nebraska: Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway, and Self-Dealing ,  for 
 Forbes: 
 
 When 
 asked by CNBC what hed learned from the controversy over the transaction, Sokol 
 responded: 

 Knowing 
 today what I know, what I would do differently is I just would never 
 have mentioned it to Warren, and just made my own investment and left it 
 alone 

 According to Professor Macey, thats called usurping a corporate opportunity , and its 
 a violation of an officers duty of loyalty t o 
 a corporation. 
 
 On April 11 , Professor Stephen Bainbridge reconsidered his and others idea that this was 
 an insider trading case. His reconsideration is based on, reportedly, an 
 email from his co-author Bill Klein. 

 Professor 
 Bainbridge doesnt mention that I sent him an email on April 8 in response 
 to his March 30 post discussing the insider trading theory and drawing his 
 attention to my April 4 th post at Forbes. I asked him to 
 consider the possibility that Sokol had usurped a corporate opportunity 
 and breached his fiduciary duty to Berkshire Hathaway. Bainbridge never 
 responded to me. 

 Bainbridge 
 does not expand on the agency, fiduciary duty, and usurpation theories until 
 April 20, after the shareholder derivative lawsuit is filed against Sokol 
 and the Berkshire board for breach of fiduciary duty. The suit also asks for 
 disgorgement of Sokols gain on his investment of Lubrizol stock. 

 In the 
 meantime, I wrote quite a few more more posts at Forbes and on this site, 
 including one about the lawsuit. 

 My posts 
 and links to my opinions were as follows: 

 April 4: My first post included this 
 quote: 
 
 So, 
 what, you might ask, is wrong with Sokol taking a little bit of the 
 action ahead of his typically successful dealmaking for Berkshire 
 Hathaway? After all, as he told CNBC, Charlie Munger did it .

 Jonathan R. Macey of Yale, 
 in his 1991 article , Agency Theory and the Criminal Liability of Corporations , tells us:

 [C]orporate 
 actors do not engage in criminal activity to benefit the firms for which 
 they work but to benefit themselves. In some, but not all cases, these 
 activities will benefit the firms for which the corporate actors work. 
 But the basic motivation for the behavior is self-interest. 

 Professor Macey told me he doesnt think this is an insider trading 
 issue at all unless Sokol failed to disclose his interests and his 
 trading to Berkshire, according to their policies. 

 I 
 agree .

 Teaching Case on Preferred Stock Shares, Warrants, and Dividends 

From The Wall Street Journal Accounting Weekly Review on April 28, 2011
 Deal Journal: Warren Buffett&apos;s Profit on GE Investment: $1.2 Billion 
 by: Shira Ovide 
Apr 22, 2011
 Click here to view the full article on WSJ.com 
  
 TOPICS:  Advanced 
 Financial Accounting, Dividends, Financial Statement Analysis

 SUMMARY:  &quot;In the 
 financial crisis, Warren Buffett loaned out his halo of respectability to 
 prop up sentiment about Goldman Sachs Group, Dow Chemical, General Electric 
 and other blue-chip companies.&quot;He invested nearly $3 billion in GE in 
 exchange for preferred stock and warrants issued together.

 CLASSROOM APPLICATION:  The 
 article is useful to cover a live example of issuing preferred stock and 
 warrants, typically covered in a second semester intermediate financial 
 accounting course. Questions also ask students to access the GE financial 
 statements (2010 Form 10-K on its investor relations web site) to examine 
 the presentation of the stock and warrants in stockholders&apos; equity and the 
 preferred stock dividends deducted in calculating earnings available for 
 common shareholders in the statement of earnings.

 QUESTIONS:  
1. ( Introductory ) According the news article, Warren Buffet&apos;s 
 Berkshire Hathaway invested $3 billion in GE during the height of the 
 financial crisies. What types of securities did GE issue to Berkshire 
 Hathaway? What are the terms of that issuance?

2. ( Advanced ) Summarize the accounting for the combined issuance of 
 preferred stock and warrants.

3. ( Advanced ) Access the GE 2010 annual report available through 
 GE&apos;s investor relations web site at http://www.ge.com/investors/ financial_reporting/index.html Click on 
 Form 10-K 2010, locate the balance sheet and Note 15. Shareowners&apos; Equity. 
 Describe how the preferred stock and warrants issued to Berkshire Hathaway 
 are presented in the GE financial statements.

4. ( Introductory ) Return to the Statement of Earnings (Income 
 Statement) in the 10-K filing. How are the preferred dividends that are 
 described in the article presented in this statement?

5. ( Advanced ) Based on the discussion in the article, do you think 
 these dividends have been paid? Comment on the deduction of dividends to 
 determine&quot;Net earnings attributable to GE common shareowners&quot;given your 
 answer to question 3 above.

 In the financial crisis, Warren Buffett loaned out 
 his halo of respectability to prop up sentiment about Goldman Sachs Group, 
 Dow Chemical, General Electric and other blue-chip companies. Those bets 
 came with some heavy costs for the companies, and produced handsome profits 
 for the Oracle of Omaha. 

 GE reiterated today it plans to repay Buffett by 
 October for his $3 billion investment in the conglomerate, an agreement 
 struck in October 2008 when the financial world was coming apart at the 
 seams. 

 As in other reputation-bolstering investments 
 Buffett made during that stretch, GE agreed to pay the Oracle a 10% annual 
 dividend, or $300 million a year in GEs case. 

 The numbers-loving Buffett carried around a coin 
 changer in his schoolboy days, and probably could tell you that his GE 
 dividend amounts to $9.51 a second. (That buys about 41% of a sirloin dinner 
 at Buffett hangout, Gorats Steak House.) 

 When GE pays Buffett back, they will owe him 10% 
 more than he paid, or $300 million on top of his $3 billion payback. Plus, 
 Buffett will have accumulated $900 million in cumulative dividends, assuming 
 GE repays the preferred-stock investment in October. All told, Buffetts $3 
 billion investment will generate a total profit of $1.2 billion. Not too 
 shabby. 

 Now the bad news: Buffetts investment also 
 entitled him to buy 134.8 million shares of GE common stock at an exercise 
 price of $22.25. With GE stock languishing below $20 a pop, those stock 
 warrants are worthless for now. But fear not. The warrants were good for 
 five years, and GE shares can always move up and give Buffett an additional 
 windfall (or move down and permanently deny Buffett the cherry atop his 
 sundae of GE profit). 

 Buffett already has been repaid for other 
 investments he made during the financial crisis, including his purchase of 
 Swiss Reinsurance debt, and his $5 billion preferred investment in Goldman 
 Sachs. And Buffett, with a net worth of $50 
 billion , has sounded downright downbeat about it. 

 Goldman Sachs has the right to call our preferred 
 on 30 days notice, but has been held back by the Federal Reserve (bless 
 it!), which unfortunately will likely give Goldman the green light before 
 long, Buffett wrote in February, in his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway investors .

 Since then, Goldman has indeed repaid Buffett, who 
 can count roughly $3.7 billion in profits on his investment , including the value of his in-the-money warrants on Goldman stock. His Swiss 
 Re investment padded Buffetts wallet by roughly $1 billion .

&quot; Colleges Spend Far Less on Educating Students Than They Claim, Report 
Says ,&quot;by Robin Wilson, Chronicle of Higher Education , April 7, 2011 ---
 http://chronicle.com/article/Colleges-Spend-Far-Less-on/127040/ 
 
 While universities routinely 
 maintain that it costs them more to educate students than what students pay, 
 a new report says exactly the opposite is true. 

 The report was released today by the Center for 
 College Affordability and Productivity, which is directed by Richard K. 
 Vedder, an economist who is also an adjunct scholar at the American 
 Enterprise Institute and a Chronicle blogger . It says student tuition payments 
 actually subsidize university spending on things that are unrelated to 
 classroom instruction, like research, and that universities unfairly inflate 
 the stated cost of providing an education by counting unrelated spending 
 into the mix of what it costs them to educate students. 

 &quot;The authors find that many colleges and 
 universities are paid more to provide an education than they spend providing 
 one,&quot;says a news release on the report , &quot;Who Subsidizes Whom?&quot; 

 The report&apos;s authors used 
 data from the U.S. Education Department&apos;s Integrated Postsecondary Education 
 Data System, or Ipeds, to conclude that more than half of students attend 
 institutions that take in more per student in tuition payments than what it 
 actually costs them to deliver an education. 

 The chief reason 
 universities inflate the figures on what they spend to educate students, 
 says the report, is that institutions include all of their spendingwhether 
 it is directly related to instruction or notwhen calculating what it costs 
 them to provide an education. In reality, says the report, depending on the 
 type of institution, it can cost universities much less to educate students 
 than what the institutions bring in through tuition charges. 

 &quot;This study finds that 
 education and related spending is only a portion of many institutions&apos; 
 budgets,&quot;says a news release on the study,&quot;and that many schools spend 
 large amounts on things unrelated to educating students.&quot; 

 The report uses Dartmouth 
 College as a poster child to illustrate the gap between the actual costs of 
 providing an education and what an institution says it spends. On its Web 
 site, the report says, the Dartmouth College Fund maintained that while the 
 institution charged undergraduates about $50,000 each in academic 2009-10, 
 the college actually spent about $104,400 per student. While the center&apos;s 
 report notes that Dartmouth indeed spent more over all per student than what 
 it took in through tuition payments,&quot;this does not mean that students are 
 being subsidized because not all of that spending is used toward 
 specifically educational purposes.&quot; 

 For example, says the 
 report, Dartmouth said it spent $37,000 per student on&quot;academic support,&quot;$24,000 per student for research, $15,000 for&quot;institutional support,&quot;and 
 $12,000 for&quot;student services.&quot;But, says the report,&quot;very little of that 
 $88,000 is properly attributed to the cost of providing an education.&quot; 

 A spokesman for Dartmouth 
 said it is legitimate for institutions to count research expenditures as 
 part of instruction. Dartmouth faculty members are&quot;renowned as 
 teacher-scholars who involve their students in their scholarship,&quot;said the 
 spokesman.&quot;Discovery of knowledge is a key part of Dartmouths fundamental 
 mission and a liberal-arts education.&quot; 

 The report criticizes colleges for stating that 
 they subsidize their students&apos; education, saying&quot;conventional wisdom is 
 often wrong&quot;in that regard .

 Early History of Mathematics and Calculating in China 
 The best general source for ancient Chinese mathematics 
is Joseph Needham&apos;s Science and Civilisation in China , vol. 3. In this 
volume you will learn, for example, that the Chinese proved the Pythagorean 
Theorem at the very latest by the Later Han dynasty (25-221 CE). The proof comes 
from an ancient text called The Arithmetical Classic of the Gnomon and the 
Circular Paths of Heaven. The book has been translated by Christopher Cullen in 
his Astronomy and Mathematics in Ancient China: The Zhou Bi Suan Jing. Needham 
also discusses the abacus, or suanpan (&quot;calculating plate&quot;).

 Abstract
An entry which appears on some medieval charge and discharge statements 
 is the respite. This paper shows some of the forms a respite might take 
 and how different ways of accounting for it may affect the balances of 
 those statements. It examines in particular the significance of respites 
 in the building accounts of Tattershall Castle 1434-72 and suggests that 
 the nature of these respites was misinterpreted by Myatt-Price (1966). 
 It concludes by considering Ross&apos;s explanation of respites in the 
 fifteenth-century Talbot Household Accounts (Ross 1968) .

 Why the Research Paper Isn&apos;t Working 
Im in love with this idea. I have long agreed with Richard Larson who wrote way back in 1982 that the 
research paper as taught in college is an artificial genre, one that works at 
cross-purposes to actually developing respect for evidence-based reasoning, a 
measured appreciation for negotiating ideas that are in conflict, or original 
thought. Im honestly a bit amazed that anyone was surprised by the results of 
the Citation Project study, also presented at the 
conference, that found students skimming 
the surface . This is a problem that existed long 
before the Internet, but has only grown more obvious as students are asked to do 
more documented expository writing than ever before. (This finding was published 
in a national study published in the CCCC&apos;s journal in 
2008; subscription required.)

 http://chronicle.com/article/Teaching-in-the-Postdoc-Space/127150/ 

Jensen Comment
Teaching postdoc students in formal programs is not common in accounting due to 
that fact that the shortage of accounting PhD graduates means that virtually all 
of them find jobs in tenure track positions. Their worry becomes one of getting 
tenure rather than in getting a job in academe.

But in the humanities and sciences, a undersupply of academic job openings 
presents all sorts of problems for PhD graduates.

An increasingly popular postdoc alternative for humanities and science 
graduates is the AACSB&apos;s Bridge Program that attempts to provide bridges into 
business and accounting tenure track positions for prospects who did not earn 
their doctorates in business or accounting ---
 http://www.aacsb.edu/bridge/graduates.asp 

The above article about&quot;Teaching in Postdoc Space&quot;has some good pointers 
that can be extrapolated into our Bridge Programs.

&quot; Business majors spend less time preparing for class

Survey of Student Engagement: Nearly half of seniors majoring in business say 
they spend fewer than 11 hours a week studying outside class .&quot;

&quot; Business Educators Struggle to Put Students to Work .&quot;By David Glenn,

 Paul M. Mason does not give his business students 
 the same exams he gave 10 or 15 years ago.&quot; Not 
 many of them would pass,&quot;he says . 

 Mr. Mason, who teaches economics at the University 
 of North Florida, believes his students are just as intelligent as they&apos;ve 
 always been. But many of them don&apos;t read their textbooks, or do much of 
 anything else that their parents would have called studying.&quot;We used to 
 complain that K-12 schools didn&apos;t hold students to high standards,&quot;he says 
 with a sigh.&quot;And here we are doing the same thing ourselves.&quot; 

 That might sound like a kids-these-days lament, but 
 all evidence suggests that student disengagement is at its worst in Mr. 
 Mason&apos;s domain: undergraduate business education. 

 Business majors spend less time preparing for class 
 than do students in any other broad field, according to the most recent 
 National Survey of Student Engagement: Nearly half of seniors majoring in 
 business say they spend fewer than 11 hours a week studying outside class. 
 In their new book, Academically Adrift: Limited Learning on College 
 Campuses, the sociologists Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa report that on a 
 national test of writing and reasoning skills, business majors had the 
 weakest gains during the first two years of college. And when business 
 students take the GMAT, the entry examination for M.B.A. programs, they 
 score lower than do students in every other major. 

 This is not a small corner of academe. The family 
 of majors under the business umbrellaincluding finance, accounting, 
 marketing, management and&quot;general business&quot;accounts for just over 20 
 percent, or more than 325,000, of all bachelor&apos;s degrees awarded annually in 
 the United States, making it the most popular field of study. 

 Brand-name programs, like the Wharton School of the 
 University of Pennsylvania and the University of Notre Dame&apos;s Mendoza 
 College of Business, among a few dozen others, are full of students pulling 
 70-hour weeks, if only to impress the elite finance and consulting firms 
 they aspire to join. But get much below Bloomberg BusinessWeek&apos;s top 50, and 
 you&apos;ll hear pervasive anxiety about student apathy, especially in&quot;soft&quot;fields like management and marketing, which account for the majority of 
 business majors. 

 Scholars in the field point to three sources of 
 trouble. First, as long ago as 1959 a Ford Foundation report warned that too 
 many undergraduate business students chose their majors&quot;by default.&quot;Business programs also attract more than their share of students who 
 approach college in purely instrumental terms: as a plausible path to a job, 
 not out of curiosity about, say, Ronald Coase&apos;s theory of the firm. 

 &quot;Business education has come to be defined in the 
 minds of students as a place for developing elite social networks and 
 getting access to corporate recruiters,&quot;says Rakesh Khurana, a professor at 
 Harvard Business School who is a prominent critic of the field. It&apos;s an 
 attitude that he first saw in M.B.A. programs but has migrated, he says, to 
 the undergraduate level.

One of the reasons I did not continue teaching after reaching retirement age is 
that I got fed up with students who wanted to argue their ways to A-Grades

 In late February, Charles Fergusons film Inside 
 Job won the Academy Award for Best Documentary. And now the film 
 documenting the causes of the 2008 global financial meltdown has made its 
 way online (thanks to the Internet Archive). A corrupt financial industry, 
 its corrosive relationship with politicians, academics and regulators, and 
 the trillions of damage done, it all gets documented in this film that runs 
 a little shy of 2 hours. 

 To watch the film, you will need to do the 
 following. 1.) Look at the bottom of the film. 2.) Click the forward button 
 twice so that it moves beyond the initial trailer and the Academy Awards 
 ceremony. 3.) Wait for the little circle to stop spinning. And 4.) click 
 play to watch film. 

 Inside Job (now listed in our Free Movie 
 Collection) can be purchased on DVD at Amazon. We all love free, but lets 
 remember that good projects cost real money to develop, and they could use 
 real financial support. So please consider buying a copy. 

 Hopefully watching or buying this film wont be a 
 pointless act, even though it can rightly feel that way. As Charles Ferguson 
 reminded us during his Oscar acceptance speech, we are three years beyond 
 the Wall Street crisis and taxpayers (you) got fleeced for billions. But 
 still not one Wall Street exec is facing criminal charges. Welcome to your 
 plutocracy

 TOPICS:  Accounting

 SUMMARY:  The WSJ held a 
 conference for business and government leaders to examine&quot;...what&apos;s holding 
 women back in the workplace-and set out an action plan for creating new 
 opportunities.&quot;Participants highlighted in the article include Chief 
 Executive of PepsiCo Indra Nooyi; retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day 
 O&apos;Connor; Marissa Mayer, the first woman engineer at Google; and actress 
 Geena Davis among other highly accomplished women. The program involved 
 presentation results of research by McKiney&amp;Co. , panel discussions, and 
 presentation of task force recommendations for action to solve issues. The 
 focus of this article is an interview with Indra Nooyi about what she did to 
 get to the top. The article begins with a summary of the McKinsey research 
 essentially saying that&quot;...at each stage of [corporate] advancement, men 
 have at least twice the odds of advancing as women&quot;and asks,&quot;How the hell 
 did you do it?&quot;

 CLASSROOM APPLICATION:  The 
 related video is essentially repeated in the printed article, so this video 
 could be used in a classroom viewing followed by the questions. It is a 
 useful discussion for any business class, particularly entry level 
 accounting classes often taken by all business majors or in MBA classes.

 QUESTIONS:  
1. ( Introductory ) Ms. Nooyi says that to reach the top, women must 
 obtain P&amp;L management responsibilities as men do. What does the term&quot;P&amp;L&quot;mean? What does it mean to have&quot;P&amp;L responsibility&quot;?

2. ( Introductory ) What are the functions that Ms. Nooyi says are 
 critical? How do those functions relate to business school education?

3. ( Introductory ) What does Ms. Nooyi say were her biggest 
 sacrifices to advance has she has?

4. ( Advanced ) Do you think that the statistics regarding women&apos;s 
 advancement in corporate America will change? Support your answer.

5. ( Advanced ) Do you think this interview and other articles 
 contain important lessons for men as well as women? Explain your answer.
 

 SMALL GROUP ASSIGNMENT:  
The questions may be discussed in classroom groups following viewing of the 
 Nooyi interview with reporting out, perhaps also including proposed 
 solutions. These solutions then might be compared to the recommendations 
 found in the related WSJ articles covering the conference.

&quot;View from the Top,&quot;by: Alan Murray and Indra Nooyi, The Wall Street 
Journal , April 15, 2011 ---
 http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704013604576247630655985522.html?mod=djem_jiewr_AC_domainid 
 
Task-force participants at the conference had no end of recommendations 
 for addressing the challengesand opportunitiesfacing women in the economy. 
 Give women more bottom-line responsibilities. Hold CEOs accountable. Recruit 
 outside the regular channels. And so on.

To get insight into those issues, The Wall Street Journal&apos;s Alan Murray 
 turned to one of the highest-ranking women in corporate America: Indra Nooyi, 
 chairman and chief executive of PepsiCo. Here are edited excerpts from the 
 discussion.

 MR. MURRAY: McKinsey research, building on Catalyst research, 
 shows this pipeline in corporate America. The majority of entrants are very 
 high-qualified womenbut at each stage of advancement, men have at least 
 twice the odds of advancing as women. How the hell did you do it? 

 MS. NOOYI: I ask myself that question every day. 
 Especially recently, I&apos;ve been looking back and thinking about all of the 
 trade-offs and sacrifices I&apos;ve had to make to get here. My second daughter&apos;s 
 going off to college this September, and I say,&quot;My God, I missed so many 
 things about her growing up.&quot;Hopefully, my two daughters will be in an 
 environment where it&apos;s going to be easier for them.

 

 MR. MURRAY: Are you suggesting that it could have been 
 easier, and you still could have achieved the pinnacle you achieved? 
 
 INDRA NOOYI &apos;The 
 harder the business, the bigger the turnaround, put your hand up 
 and say&quot;I want to do it.&quot;&apos;   
 MS. NOOYI: From a family 
 situation, I wanted it all, and it wasn&apos;t easy. But I lucked out in one way. 
 I had a husband who said,&quot;You&apos;re going to have true gender equality.&quot;He 
 was working, I was working, but we juggled our schedules. I also had 
 tremendous support from the extended family. 

 On the professional side, I had mentors who gave me 
 feedback. For example, I&apos;m a pretty honest and outspoken person. So, you sit 
 in a meeting and somebody presents a three-year, five-year plan. Typically, 
 a lot of the men in the room would say,&quot;You know, that&apos;s very interesting. 
 But maybe you could think about this slightly differently.&quot; 

 I just said,&quot;That&apos;s crap. This is never going to 
 happen.&quot;I&apos;m sure they were all thinking that, but they were saying it in a 
 much more gentle way. I&apos;d come out of the meeting, and one of the guys would 
 pull me aside and say,&quot;You could have said the thing slightly differently. 
 Maybe not the way I said it. Maybe not the way you said it. There might have 
 been a middle ground.&quot; 

 I was very happy that these mentors stepped up and 
 gave me feedback on how to interact in a world that is predominantly male. 
 How can I keep my authenticity, yet adapt to the environment? 

 

 MR. MURRAY: Can you have an example of 
 where you didn&apos;t make the compromise on authenticity? 

 MS. NOOYI: If my kids called in 
 the middle of a meeting, I took the call. I never said,&quot;Mom&apos;s not 
 available.&quot;I said,&quot;Excuse me, my kids need to talk to me.&quot; 

 The Leaky Pipe 

 MR. MURRAY: How do you account for the 
 fact that the pipeline is, to use the adjectives that have been used here, 
 leaky, blocked, broken? 

 MS. NOOYI: I think the pyramid 
 starts narrowing for everybody, but disproportionately for women because the 
 pipeline wasn&apos;t as rich as it needed to be coming up. 

 I think there might be three reasons why that&apos;s so. 
 One, just law of numbers, there weren&apos;t enough women in the pipeline. 
 Second, as you move up the organization, there are so many trade-offs and 
 sacrifices to be made. Many women opted out. Third is the environment in 
 many companies, because it&apos;s more male dominated. It&apos;s changing now, but the 
 senior men belong to the older generation who talk differently and act 
 differently. 

 Let&apos;s say Alan Murray made a presentation, and it 
 was awful. The guys would go to Alan Murray, thump him on the back and say,&quot;Alan, buddy, what happened? You screwed up, man.&quot;And Alan says,&quot;You think 
 so? Tell me what I did wrong.&quot;There&apos;s a locker-room conversation that goes 
 on. 

 When a woman makes a presentation that&apos;s not so 
 good, the men say,&quot;She screwed up, God, she did.&quot;That&apos;s not locker room; 
 that&apos;s heckling the woman. 

 Women need to go to women and say,&quot;Hey, that 
 presentation wasn&apos;t very good. Let me tell you how you could have done it 
 better.&quot;But there&apos;s a reverse problem. When women give women feedback, 
 women don&apos;t take it well. So, there&apos;s a funny psychological issue we need to 
 address. Women can be better mentors to women, and women should be more 
 willing to accept women mentors. 

 The Bottom Line 

 MR. MURRAY: Let&apos;s take a look at the 
 list of priorities. Number one was that too many women are in support roles. 
 In order to see women advance to the top, they needed to be put in positions 
 where they could develop responsibility for the bottom line. 

 MS. NOOYI: Punching the ticket 
 that you&apos;ve done P&amp;L management makes a huge difference. But roles like 
 finance or HR or marketing are now critical to the functioning of a company. 
 You can actually exert your influence from those roles. So, ask for a P&amp;L 
 role, get it out as soon as you canand then figure out how to get into a 
 critical function. But make sure that as you do this job, you expand your 
 own definition of that job. 

 MR. MURRAY: Another recommendation was 
 to hold CEOs accountable for hiring women in the top jobs and making sure 
 pay was at an equal level. 

 MS. NOOYI: I agree with all of 
 that, especially the pay parity, which is something we can fix right away. 
 The thing to be very careful about, though, is that if you don&apos;t fix the 
 issue of getting talented women in the pipeline, you can&apos;t fix the 
 top-management issue overnight. That&apos;s a formula for disaster. You put women 
 in there, and they don&apos;t succeed, and then it&apos;s a worse situation for women. 

 

 MR. MURRAY: Another idea was to promote 
 women on potential. A phrase that&apos;s been repeated around here for the last 
 few days is that men are promoted for potential, and women are promoted on 
 performance. The implication is that there&apos;s a higher hurdle that women have 
 to meet. 

 MS. NOOYI: I think that&apos;s changed 
 a lot. The sensitivity, the awareness of these issues is rising, but I think 
 we ought to keep the pressure on. As long as there are no women in the 
 C-suite, these kinds of discussions won&apos;t happen.

 David Warsh ,&quot; A Recent Exercise in Nation-Building by Some Harvard 
Boys ,&quot; EconomicPrincipals.com, March 27, 2011 ---
 http://www.economicprincipals.com/issues/2011.03.27/1248.html 
Thank you Robert Walker for the heads up.
 
 It was worth a smile at breakfast that morning in 
 February 2006, a scrap of social currency to take out into the world. 
 Michael Porter, the Harvard Business School management guru, had grown 
 famous offering competitive strategies to firms, regions, whole nations. Earlier he had taken on the problems of inner cities, health care and 
 climate change. Now he was about to tackle perhaps the hardest problem of 
 all (that is, after the United States wars in Afghanistan and Iraq). 

 He had become adviser to Moammar Khadafys Libya. 

 There at the bottom of the front page of the Financial Times was a story that no one else had that day, or any other 
 a scoop. It turned out that Porter and his friend Daniel Yergin and the 
 consulting firms which they had respectively co-founded and founded, Monitor 
 Group and Cambridge Energy Research Associates, had been working for a year 
 on a plan to diversify the Libyan economy away from its heavy dependence on 
 oil. Their teams had conducted more than 2,000 interviews with small- and 
 medium-scale entrepreneurs as well as Libyan and foreign business leaders. 
 (Both men are better-known as celebrated authors: Porter for Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors 
 and The Competitive Advantage of Nations , Yergin for The Prize: the 
 Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power and The Commanding Heights: the 
 Battle for the World Economy .) 

 The next day Porter would present the 200-page 
 document they had prepared in a ceremony in Tripoli. Khadafy himself might 
 attend. The FT had seen a copy of the report, which envisaged a 
 glorious future under the consultants plan. If all went well, it said, then 
 by 2019 the 50th anniversary of the military coup that brought Col. 
 Khadafy to power Libya would have one of the fastest rates of business 
 formation in the world, making it a regional leader contributing to the 
 wealth and stability of surrounding nations. 

 . . . 

 We now know that Khadafys son bribed his way into 
 his PhD from the London School of Economics (LSE); that Monitor Group had 
 been paid to help him write his dissertation there (much of which apparently 
 turns out to have been plagiarized , anyway); that the Libyan government 
 was paying Monitor $250,000 a month for its services; that, according to The New York Times , Libyas sovereign wealth fund today owns a portion 
 of Pearson PLC, the conglomerate that publishes the Financial Times and The Economist; that the whole deal quietly fell apart two years 
 later. 

 Sir Howard Davies resigned earlier this month as 
 director of the LSE after it was disclosed he had accepted a₤1.5 million 
 donation in 2009 from a charity controlled by Saif Khadafy. 

 It turns out that Monitor also proposed to write a 
 book boosting Khadafy as one of the most recognizable individuals on the 
 planet, promised to generate positive press, and to bring still more 
 prominent academics, policymakers and journalists to Libya, according to 
 Farah Stockman of The Boston Globe . She did a banner job of 
 pursuing the details she found in A Proposal For Expanding the Dialogue Surrounding the Ideas of Moammar 
 Khadafy , a proposal from Mark Fuller in 2007 that 
 a Libyan opposition group posted on the Web. 

 Among those enlisted were Sir Anthony Giddens, 
 former director of the LSE; Francis Fukuyama, then of Johns Hopkins 
 University; Benjamin Barber, of Rutgers University (emeritus); Nicholas 
 Negroponte, founder of MITs Media Lab; Robert Putnam and Joseph Nye, both 
 former deans of Harvards Kennedy School of Government. Nye received a fee 
 and wrote a broadly sympathetic account of his three-hour 
 visit with Khadafy for The New Republic . He also told the Globe s 
 Stockman he had commented on a chapter of Saifs doctoral dissertation. 
 (When The New Republic scolded Nye earlier this month, after Mother Jones magazine disclosed the fee, Nye replied that his original 
 manuscript implied that he had been employed as a consultant by Monitor, but 
 that the phrase had been edited out). 

 . . . 

 Im not going to hold my breath waiting for Porter 
 to give some evidence of contrition about his mission to Tripoli. Sir Howard 
 Davies may have resigned as director of the LSE (The short point is that I 
 am responsible for the schools reputation and that has suffered), but 
 being a Harvard professor apparently means never having to say youre sorry. 
 Perhaps instead the university will find some way to rein in on its 
 professors more self-serving ambitions.

&quot; PwC India Affiliates Settle with SEC, PCAOB Over Satyam Audit Failures ,&quot;By Caleb Newquist, Going Concern , April 5, 2011 ---
 http://goingconcern.com/2011/04/pwc-india-affiliates-settle-with-sec-pcaob-over-satyam-audit-failures/ 
 
 The affiliates Lovelock&amp;Lewes, Price Waterhouse 
 Bangalore, Price Waterhouse&amp;Co. Bangalore, Price Waterhouse Calcutta, and 
 Price Waterhouse&amp;Co. Calcutta must pay $6 million to the SEC, $1.5 
 million to the PCAOB and are barred from accepting U.S.-based clients for 
 six months. The SEC fine is the largest ever levied against a foreign-based 
 accounting firm in an SEC Enforcement Action and the PCAOB fine is the 
 largest in the regulators history. PW India must also establish training 
 programs for its officers and employees on securities laws and accounting 
 principles; institute new pre-opinion review controls; revise its audit 
 policies and procedures; and appoint an independent monitor to ensure these 
 measures are implemented. The SECs press release stated that the failures 
 were not limited to Satyam, but rather indicative of a much larger quality 
 control failure throughout PW India.

   Jim skillfully tells it like it is in this almost laughable 
settlement
&quot; The PCAOB Settlement in Satyam: PwC Agrees to Fall on its Pen-Knife ,&quot;by 
Jim Peterson, re:Balance , April 6, 2011 ---
 http://www.jamesrpeterson.com/home/2011/04/the-pcaob-settlement-in-satyam-pwc-agrees-to-fall-on-its-pen-knife.html 
 
 . . . 

 From the PwC perspective, meanwhile, the chance for 
 a cheap exit from a major problem would have been a no-brainer. Consider: 

 First, an enforcement ding on the Satyam 
 engagements had to be coming, sooner or later. From the PCAOBs order 
 which PwC agreed not to contest the Indian engagement teams on the audits 
 from 2005 through 2008 basically did not: 

 Adequately audit the companys cash positions Control the confirmation process on bank 
 balances or accounts receivable Pursue indications of inconsistent information 
 or control weaknesses Follow PwC global directives on audit 
 execution Inform or advise higher-level quality 
 oversight personnel Document the work actually done (or not) in 
 the work-papers, until subsequent back-dating while already under 
 regulatory scrutiny 

 So a strategic decision not to defend the 
 indefensible indicates early recognition of a step toward sustainable 
 credibility.  

 As for the sanctions PwCs undertakings on future 
 practice quality, staffing, training and internal oversight are no more than 
 necessary for an enterprise with aspirations to professionalism; the 
 two-year presence of an outside monitor only adds one more stranger to the 
 list of foreign intruders imposed on its Indian practice; and the six-month 
 restraint on new SEC clients runs only to the settling Indian firms, so does 
 not inhibit either the global network or its other Indian affiliates. 

 And, lastly, the financial impact of the fines on 
 the massive PwC network is no more than a dime added to a roll of nickels. 

 For good measure, with the weeks news cycle 
 dominated by military activities in Libya and a threatened government 
 shut-down in Washington, and subsidiary attention to post-earthquake Japans 
 nuclear hazards and Silvio Berlusconis bunga bunga trial, the entire 
 story will drop off the media screen in less than no time. 

 Predictably, critics of the accounting profession 
 who are unwilling to settle for less than the scalps of the Big Four leaders 
 nailed to an enforcers door will make their outrage known. 

 But they will fail to acknowledge that both the 
 regulators and PwC itself are only acting in full accordance with their 
 respective DNA. 

 So once again, this settlement points up the 
 challenge to the long-term achievability of a valuable, sustainable 
 assurance function, to serve the issuers and users of the financial 
 information of global-scale companies: the terms of the discourse are 
 revealed as hopelessly inadequate.

 &quot; Earnings 
effects of personality, education and IQ for the gifted ,&quot;by Steve Hsu, 
MIT&apos;s Technology Review , April 2, 2011 ---
 http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/post.aspx?bid=354&amp;bpid=26600&amp;nlid=4315 

 Thanks to a reader for pointing me to this recent paper by Heckman and 
collaborators, which makes use of data from the Terman study of 
gifted individuals (minimum IQ of 135 on the Stanford-Binet).

Of the personality factors, Conscientiousness and Extraversion had the largest 
(positive) effect on lifetime earnings -- see figures below. See here for more 
on Big 5 personality factors and a link to a personality test. 

 
 The Effects of Education, Personality, and IQ on Earnings of High-Ability Men 

 This paper estimates the internal rate of return (IRR) 
to education for men and women of the Terman sample, a 70-year long prospective 
cohort study of high-ability individuals. The Terman data is unique in that it 
not only provides full working-life earnings histories of the participants, but 
it also includes detailed profiles of each subject, including IQ and measures of 
latent personality traits. Having information on latent personality traits is 
significant as it allows us to measure the importance of personality on 
educational attainment and lifetime earnings.

Our analysis addresses two problems of the literature on returns to education: 
First, we establish causality of the treatment effect of education on earnings 
by implementing generalized matching on a full set of observable individual 
characteristics and unobserved personality traits. Second, since we observe 
lifetime earnings data, our estimates of the IRR are direct and do not depend on 
the assumptions that are usually made in order to justify the interpretation of 
regression coefficients as rates of return.

For the males, the returns to education beyond high school are sizeable. For 
example, the IRR for obtaining a bachelor&apos;s degree over a high school diploma is 
11.1%, and for a doctoral degree over a bachelor&apos;s degree it is 6.7%. These 
results are unique because they highlight the returns to high-ability and 
high-education individuals, who are not well-represented in regular data sets.

Our results highlight the importance of personality and intelligence on our 
outcome variables. We find that personality traits similar to the Big Five 
personality traits are significant factors that help determine educational 
attainment and lifetime earnings. Even holding the level of education constant, 
measures of personality traits have significant effects on earnings. Similarly, 
IQ is rewarded in the labor market, independently of education. Most of the 
effect of personality and IQ on life-time earnings arise late in life, during 
the prime working years. Therefore, estimates from samples with shorter 
durations underestimate the treatment effects.
  

 
 Here are a couple of interesting excerpts from the 
paper: 
  

 
... Our third contribution is to show how the effect of personality on earnings 
varies through-out the mens working lives. We find that without access to long 
follow-up data, the estimated effect would be understated. Note that even though 
the Terman sample has a restricted range of IQ, there is substantial variation 
in personality. In fact, the Terman men do not differ from the general 
population in terms of personality.

... note that even when controlling for rich background variables, IQ maintains 
a statistically significant effect on lifetime earnings. Even though the effect 
is slightly diminished from the un-controlled association of the first column, 
it is still sizable. Malcolm Gladwell claims rather generally in his book 
Outliers that for the Terman men, IQ did not matter once family background and 
other observable personal characteristics were taken into account. While we do 
not want to argue that IQ has a larger role for the difference between 50 and 
100, for example, than for the difference between 150 and 200, we do want to 
point out that even at the high end of the ability distribution, IQ has 
meaningful consequences. [The syntax of this last sentence is strange.

were Sells award winners including the gold medalist. The gold medalist could 
take a test with the best of them but she couldnt carry on an intelligent

students, accounting is not about solving problems; its about identifying the 
problem to be solved. Im sure some of the smartest PhDs youve known in your

 American Express has a full-page ad in todays 
 Times offering a savings account yielding 1.15 percent. 

 These days that is a good rate, a fact the people 
 of my generation find astonishing. Such amazingly low rates cause great 
 anxiety for those who saved money in the past and now find it yields so 
 little. 

 I did a little arithmetic. My son is an 18-year-old 
 college freshman. If he puts $100 into such an account now, and rates remain 
 constant, he will have doubled his money in time for his 79th birthday 
 party. 

 Of course, if you are investing for a child in 
 kindergarten, there is still hope. A $100 investment today would double 
 about the time he or she goes on Medicare.

&quot; Book Indicates Wrigley Faithful Care More About Beer Prices Than Winning: 
Chicagoist ,&quot; Chicagoist , April 4, 2011 ---

Thanks to Jim Mahar for the heads up.
 Leave it to a University of Chicago economist to lend 
 credence to the belief that Wrigley Field is a background to being the 
 World&apos;s Largest Beer Garden 81 times a year. Booth School of Business 
 Finance Professor Tobias&quot;Toby&quot;Moskowitz is one of the co-authors 
 of the new book Scorecasting . Moskowitz and Sports Illustrated senior writer Jon Wertham a nalyzed 
 economic data related to baseball at Wrigley Field in relation to attendance 
 and found that, more often than not. the one factor that tended to lead to decreases in attendance was increases 
 in beer prices , even as tickets to Cubs games 
 became more expensive. 
Per the University of Chicago magazine;
 From 1984 to 2009, attendance was more than four 
 times more sensitive to beer prices than to winning or losing. That 
 sensitivity is evident at the concession stand. A beer at Wrigley Field, 
 Scorecasting reports, costs just $5, cheaper than everywhere except at 
 Arizona Diamondbacks and Pittsburgh Pirates games. 
 Tickets to Cubs games, on the other hand, have 
 followed a different trajectory. Since 1990, prices have increased 67 
 percent (the league average is 44.7 percent). Only the New York Yankees 
 and the Boston Red Sox command more. 

 Yet people have continued to pay Wrigley 
 Fields escalating cover charge, filling the stadium to 99 percent 
 capacity. Across town at US Cellular Field, ticket prices and attendance 
 rise and fall based on White Sox wins and losses, but the same beer will 
 run you a buck-fifty more than at Wrigley .

Jensen Comment
This illustration might be used to portray the enormous gap between CPV analysis 
in the real world versus the pathetic simplification assumptions we make for CPV 
models in our cost and managerial accounting textbooks.

Firstly, the single product models where only one product bears the fixed 
cost almost never arise in the real world except in maybe for farmers who only 
grow one crop such as Kansas wheat or Idaho potatoes. But this leaves our 
students unprepared for the real world where they rarely encounter 
single-product firms.

Secondly, when we teach multiple-product CPV analysis we make the totally 
unrealistic assumption that product/sales mix ratios are constant over the 
relevant range. This leaves our students unprepared for the real world where 
they rarely encounter fixed product/sales mix ratios even in a relatively narrow 
relevant range.

The above Wrigley Field CPV problem from the real world illustrates a 
situation where two products, beer and park seating tickets, share common fixed 
costs but do so in a complicated way that makes the assumption of a fixed 
product/sales mix ratio is totally inappropriate. Pricing is especially 
complicated because at low seating prices we have more patrons who potentially 
but not necessarily will buy more beer. But at low beer prices we will 
apparently sell more seating tickets, but this becomes complicated by so many 
other factors. Demand appears to be more elastic to beer pricing than to ticket 
pricing according to findings in the above article. Add to this the park 
attendance complications caused by Cubs rankings in the National League, 
popularity of certain stars that emerge such a leading home run hitter, weather, 
unemployment, traffic, parking, and other factors affecting park attendance and 
beer drinking.

It might be of great value if some accounting professors collaborated to 
write a case about Wrigley Field CPV analysis leading up to pricing decisions 
and other variables that we commonly analyze in CPV analysis such as operating 
leverage.

It might be of great value if readers would tell us how they go beyond the 
textbooks to prepare students for real world complications of CPV analysis.

&quot; Programs that grow the next generation of global leaders ,&quot;by Dan 
Black, Americas Director of Campus Recruitment, Ernst&amp;Young, Ernst&amp;Young 
Faculty Connection, Issue 32, April 2011 ---
 http://www.ey.com/US/en/Careers/EY-Faculty-Connection-Issue-32---Programs-that-grow-the-next-generation-of-global-leaders 
 
 Our 141,000 people are part of a global network 
 that spans more than 140 countries, and working effectively in a global 
 marketplace is one of our key priorities. It helps foster our inclusive 
 culture, and promotes global assignments and working on cross-cultural 
 teams. That is why we offer a wide range of programs and experiences for our 
 interns, new hires and early-career professionals to build their global 
 mindsets. 

 The good news is that todays college students are 
 the most global generation to date. Research among the attendees of the 
 Ernst&amp;Young 2010 International Internship Conference shows that 88% have 
 traveled outside their home country and 36% have studied abroad. These 
 business leaders of tomorrow are hungry for international experience, and we 
 at Ernst&amp;Young are passionate about providing the tools they need to 
 develop a global mindset. 

 We begin providing this training long before the 
 students are hired. Our upcoming Emerging Leaders Summit , a pre-internship 
 conference for high-performing college sophomores and juniors, includes 
 workshops designed to build students global intellectual, psychological and 
 social capital, the building blocks of a successful global mindset. 
 Opportunities for international geographic mobility begin with overseas 
 assignments in the Global Student Exchange Program , an exciting 
 opportunity for Ernst&amp;Young interns. Internships start in the students 
 home office locations, then four weeks abroad at another Ernst&amp;Young 
 office. Participants then return and complete their internship back home. 
 Flights, housing and work visas costs are paid for by Ernst&amp;Young. In 
 addition, Ernst&amp;Young was the only Big Four organization to hold an International Intern Leadership Conference in both 
 2009 and 2010. Attended by nearly 1,400 students from over 13 countries last 
 year, the conference allows students to meet their intern counterparts from 
 around the world, an invaluable first step to creating their global 
 networks. 

 We are also very excited to announce a new 
 experience geared towards helping our younger employees on their journey 
 towards developing a global mindset. Our Global Exchange Program has been extended to offer 
 second and third-year employees short-term international rotations, allowing 
 more of our professionals to experience geographic mobility earlier in their 
 careers. Already enjoying several years of success in our Europe, Middle 
 East, India and Africa areas, the Americas pilot of this program will link 
 people in our more junior ranks from Brazil, Canada and the US so that they 
 can team internationally on select high-profile clients.

 In the thick of tax season, most certified public 
 accountants are chained to their desks grinding out returns. 

 Doug Stives, a CPA from Red Bank, N.J., went skiing 
 in Utah. 

 &quot;I always dreamed of coming here for peak 
 conditions,&quot;he said in mid-March between runs at Snowbasin Resort. 

 The trip is among the many perks that have accrued 
 from his decision, in 2006, to become, in effect, The Most Tax-Efficient Man 
 in America. The experiment has led to a new career, frequent travel and 
 obsessive documentation of expenses, such as a $6 hot dog he recently bought 
 in the Philadelphia airport. 

 The&quot;aha&quot;moment came to him, he says, after a 
 college approached him about a teaching gig and he realized he could put 
 into practice many of the tax strategies he had learned over the decades. 

 Step One was to change jobs. Mr. Stives had been a 
 partner for 36 years at The Curchin Group, an accounting firm. By accepting 
 an offer to teach tax and accounting courses full-time at the Leon Hess 
 Business School of Monmouth University in New Jersey, he was able to tap 
 into a broad array of tax-free employee benefits not available to him at the 
 firm. 

 Step Two was the formation of Doug Stives LLC, the 
 separate consulting business to which he attributes an impressive array of 
 expenses. In general, people who are employees and have side businesses are 
 often in the best position to maximize the tax code&apos;s benefits, say experts. 
 Mr. Stives calls this&quot;the best of all worlds.&quot; 

 The result, says Mr. Stives, is that while he earns 
 less than 75% of his earlier pay, he takes home almost 90% as much. And he 
 says he reaps another $40,000 a year in tax-free benefits from his college 
 gig. Among other things, the school adds to his 401(k) contribution and 
 provides tax-free, discounted health plans for Mr. Stives and his wife, plus 
 disability insurance. As a partner in the accounting firm, he had to fund 
 such expenses himself. 

 Not that all is perfect now. One peeve: dealing 
 with what he calls&quot;airline nonsense&quot;long lines, rising fees and canceled 
 flights. But overall, he says,&quot;my quality of life is so much higher.&quot; 

 His wife of 40 years, Elizabeth Stives, agrees.&quot;We 
 travel so much now for his business,&quot;she says.&quot;Next is Lake Tahoe.&quot; 

 Mr. Stives, 64 years old, says he&apos;s too miserly to 
 focus solely on maximizing deductionsa practice he calls a&quot;rookie&apos;s 
 mistake.&quot;In 2010, for example, he spotted a bonanza in&quot;bonus depreciation&quot;for large SUVs used in a business, but didn&apos;t need another car.&quot;Sometimes 
 my cheapness overcomes my love of tax savings,&quot;he says.&quot;My wife will tell 
 you I got her on sale.&quot; 

 Instead, he says, he uses the tax code&apos;s many 
 quirks as the means through which he can live a fuller life.

Free Faxing Service
&quot; HelloFax Makes Faxing Painless (Even without a Fax machine) ,&quot;by Ryan

 http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/hellofax-makes-faxing-painless-even-for-profs-hacker/32518?sid=wc&amp;utm_source=wc&amp;utm_medium=en 
 
 The very idea of faxing a document seems outdated 
 to me. I suspect that many ProfHacker readers wouldnt willingly fax 
 something were there any option to submit it electronically. Nevertheless, I 
 find myself needing a fax machine several times a year. Whats more, the 
 things that must be faxed are, inevitably, essential documents: 
 often tied to my finances or academic records. 

 So I was thrilled when Lifehacker recently posted (yes, Lifehacker 
 again!) about HelloFax , a service that allows you to fax 
 documents straight from your computer. Once you register for an account with 
 HelloFax, you simply type in the destination fax number, upload your 
 document, sign it electronically (if you want to), and send it. HelloFax 
 sends you an email when the fax is delivered (or if the delivery fails). 
 When you log into HelloFax, you can see the status of all of your faxes, and 
 resend faxes that failed. 

 Since I read Lifehackers post, Ive scanned and 
 then faxed three separate documents using HelloFax. Each time the service 
 was easy to use and my documents were delivered safely. With a free account 
 you can send up to 5 pages per month (about all I ever need). HelloFax also 
 offers paid accounts for more frequent faxers.

&quot; Bribery and the Gathering Storm Over Compliance ,&quot;by Peter J. 
Henning, The New York Times (DealB%k), April 1, 2011 ---
 http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/01/bribery-and-the-gathering-storm-over-compliance/ 
 
 While insider trading cases have been attracting 
 much of the financial headlines, there is another issue that will have a 
 much greater impact on corporate bottom lines: bribery. 

 The British Ministry of Justice has announced 
 guidelines for the implementation of the far-reaching Bribery Act of 2010, 
 which goes into effect on July 1. Meanwhile, while the Securities and 
 Exchange Commission is set this month to announce rules required by the 
 Dodd-Frank Act to encourage whistleblowers to disclose information about 
 corporate misconduct, most likely including violations of the Foreign 
 Corrupt Practices Act. 

 The Bribery Act is sure to drive up the costs of 
 compliance programs for American companies doing business in Britain, while 
 the Dodd-Frank Acts whistleblower provisions may well render those programs 
 superfluous, even though they will still be required by the Sarbanes-Oxley 
 Act. 

 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits 
 individuals and companies from paying bribes to foreign officials to obtain 
 or retain business in the country. It also requires corporations that file 
 reports with the S.E.C. to maintain accurate books and records in accordance 
 with the accounting rules. The law, first adopted in 1977, has grown in 
 importance over the past decade as the Justice Department, working with the 
 S.E.C., has brought a number of cases against multinational companies for 
 corrupt payments, resulting in millions of dollars of fines and penalties. 

 Britains Bribery Act is broader in some respects 
 than the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, most importantly applying to any 
 type of bribery, not just payments to foreign officials. The Bribery Act 
 makes a company liable for the actions of those associated with a 
 commercial organization, including any employee or agent who acts on its 
 behalf, and the organization is strictly liable for any failure to prevent 
 the bribery. 

 For American companies, a key facet of the Bribery 
 Act is its application to any organization that carries on a business in 
 Britain. The Ministry of Justices guidance is not particularly helpful on 
 the scope of the law, noting that it would not apply to foreign company that 
 did not have a demonstrable business presence in Britain, and that a 
 company is not necessarily liable if it lists its shares on a British 
 exchange or maintains a subsidiary in the country. Rather than explaining 
 what the law does cover, the guidance simply describes what might fall 
 outside the Bribery Act, while noting that the courts will finally decide 
 the issue. This provides little clarity about the scope of the law. 

 The Bribery Act provides a defense for a company 
 accused of a violation if it can show it had in place adequate procedures 
 to prevent an associated person from engaging in bribery, something the 
 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act does not recognize as a basis to avoid 
 liability. The Ministry of Justice outlined six principles for preventing 
 bribery that should guide companies in adopting or expanding a compliance 
 program to help establish a defense to a charge. The principles focus on 
 adequately assessing the risks of a violation and implementing a 
 sufficiently rigorous program of prevention and monitoring. 

 While almost every publicly traded American company 
 already has a compliance program in place, the potentially broad scope of 
 the Bribery Act is likely to require companies doing any substantial amount 
 of business in Britain to devote even greater resources to preventing 
 bribery of any type, not just that involving foreign officials. Compliance 
 is not cheap, of course, which means the lawyers, accountants and outside 
 consultants who specialize in this field will see an uptick in business.

 &quot;The Big Screw Up&quot;: An&quot;Ugly&quot;PCAOB Audit Inspection Report of KPMG 
Bermuda 

&quot;Dirty Little Secret Unravels in Bermuda Blunde r ,&quot;by Jonathan Weil, Bloomberg , March 30, 2011 ---
 http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-30/dirty-little-secret-outed-in-bermuda-blunder-commentary-by-jonathan-weil.html 
 
 One of the long-standing raps on the auditing 
 profession is that too many of its practitioners suffer from a check-the-box 
 mentality, where rigid adherence to mindless rules obscures their ability to 
 see the bigger picture. 

 For once, that mindset has worked to investors 
 advantage. 

 Two weeks ago, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board released 
 its triennial inspection report on the 
 Hamilton, Bermuda-based affiliate of KPMG , the Big Four 
 accounting firm. And it was an ugly one. In one of the audits performed by KPMG- Bermuda , the board said its inspection staff 
 had identified an audit deficiency so significant that it appeared the firm 
 did not obtain sufficient competent evidential matter to support its opinion 
 on the issuers financial statements. 

 This being the hopelessly timid PCAOB, however, the 
 report didnt say whose audit KPMG-Bermuda had blown. Thats because the 
 agency, as a matter of policy, refuses to name companies where its 
 inspectors have found botched audits. It just goes to show that the PCAOBs 
 first priority isnt to protect the interests of investors, as the boards 
 motto goes. Rather, it is to protect the dirty little secrets of the 
 accounting firms and their corporate audit clients. 

 Thats why it gives me great pleasure to be able to 
 break the following bit of news: The unnamed company cited in KPMG- 
 Bermudas inspection report was Alterra Capital Holdings Ltd. (ALTE) , a 
 Hamilton-based insurance company with a $2.3 billion stock- market value, 
 which used to be known as Max Capital Group Ltd. 

 One Client 

 You see, just like their checklist of instructions 
 told them to do, the folks who wrote this report were kind enough to 
 disclose the number of U.S.-listed companies that KPMG-Bermuda had as audit 
 clients at the time it was inspected. That number, the report said, was one. 

 The report also said the boards staff conducted 
 their inspection in November 2009, and that the audit deficiency they found 
 was the failure to perform sufficient procedures to test the estimated fair 
 value of certain available-for-sale securities. Armed with those data 
 points and some stock- screening software, I quickly found KPMG-Bermudas audit report on Alterras 2008 financial 
 statements, dated Feb. 19, 2009. 

 Alterra actually was one of two U.S.-listed 
 companies for which KPMG-Bermuda signed an audit report that year. The other 
 one got acquired before the agencys inspection work began. And of the two, 
 Alterra was the only one that classified any of its securities as 
 available-for-sale. 

 Big Screw-Up 

 Its when you look at Alterras financial 
 statements that the magnitude of KPMG-Bermudas screw-up becomes apparent. 
 Available-for-sale securities are the single biggest line item on Alterras 
 balance sheet. They represented almost half of the companys $7.3 billion of 
 total assets as of Dec. 31, 2008, and a little more than half of its $9.9 
 billion of total assets at the end of last year.

 Questions
Is it possible to eliminate a $1.5 trillion deficit by increasing rates for 
taxpayers earning more than $250,000 per year?
Is it possible to eliminate the above deficit by increasing tax rates for all 
taxpayers? 

Answers
In theory no to Question 1 and yes to Question 2, but in reality, closing the 
Federal spending gap with tax rate increases would be a total disaster on the 
economy to a point where the government might take in less rather than more tax 
revenue.

Firstly the answer is no unless you more than double what the poor and middle 
class pay in taxes. And since nearly half the households in the U.S. do not pay 
any Federal income tax, Congress would probably have to figure how to squeeze 
blood out of turnips. This would have an extremely adverse impact on middle and 
lower income families already deep in debt to to pay medical, housing, and 
education expenses.

Secondly, the answer is no if you anticipate that most taxpayers that have 
any form of savings would probably stampede to invest in tax free alternatives 
such as tax free municipal bonds and bond funds. This would be a disaster for 
business firms seeking capital.

Thirdly, many taxpayers now paying something into the U.S. Treasury would be 
thrown out of work and impact on the economy would be far worse than the Great 
Depression of the 1930s.

But if we could wave a magic wand and prevent all the dynamic reactions to 
tax rate increases, one solution would look something like this --- keeping in 
mind that all of this is pure fantasy since the dynamic reactions really cannot 
be prevented. From Paul Caron&apos;s TaxProf Blog on April 18, 2011 ---

Jensen Comment
Professor Blinder&apos;s main criticism is that the Ryan Plan is too long term and 
does not do enough to reduce the trillions in deficits over the next decade. But 
like most progressives he offers zero hints as to what will be a&quot;better game in 
town&quot;to reduce deficits now. Presumably he wants to confiscate the incomes of 
people now making over $250,000 per year, but he really doesn&apos;t want to discuss 
a proposed game plan for tax increases because he secretly knows this will not 
be enough to make much difference on the deficits and probably will be highly 
dysfunctional in terms of unemployment. Secretly he most likely supports his 
Princeton colleague&apos;s, Krazy Krugman&apos;s, solution of printing dollars to reduce 
deficits and pay for my wife&apos;s forthcoming very expensive surgery.
 

Zimbabwe showed Ben Bernanke, Alan Blinder, and Paul Krugman the way to 
reduce government deficits. Why can&apos;t they convince the rest of us that printing 
presses are the answer to deficit reduction?
 

And, if we keep redefining inflation by taking more and more commodities and 
services out of the calculation, things won&apos;t look so bad while were printing 
$15 trillion dollars for starters.

Eventually, the&quot;Core&quot;CPI might only include empty houses and vacant yachts.

April 20, 2011 reply from Bob Jensen
 
Hi Louis and Linda,
I probably would never do research on privileged budget items because it is 
 so complicated and confounded with externalities.


When it comes to government spending, one has to first distinguish those 
 budget items that are discretionary versus non-discretionary. To do this we 
 need some type of criterion. One criterion to consider is whether or not a 
 contract would make the item binding in court. As I mentioned previously 
 many retirement contracts allow beneficiaries to take breaches of contract 
 to court, which is why Congress does not mess with cutting military 
 pensions.


There are, of course, gray zones. Presumably Congress can choose to add 
 surtaxes to all pensions that it pays, including military pensions and 
 Social Security. Or it can choose to tax medical benefits that it pays such 
 as taxes on usage of Veterans Hospitals or taxes and higher deductibles on 
 Medicare claims.


Another gray area that makes non-discretionary budget items somewhat 
 discretionary is already being practiced in Medicare. You can keep allowing 
 less and less for medical services such that claimants can only get cheap 
 and inferior doctors. For example, the 
 surgeon who performed my wife&apos;s surgeries three and four under Medicare 
 would not do surgery Number 5 because he stopped accepting any Medicare 
 patients. This means by law 
 that he cannot accept patients who are eligible for Medicare even if they 
 are willing to pay his fees from private funds. May wife had to find another 
 surgeon in another state.


Under the Romney Care&quot;universal&quot;health insurance plan in Massachusetts, 
 some hospitals discovered the plan was not paying enough to cover 
 out-of-pocket expenses, especially malpractice insurance premiums. So those 
 hospitals dropped the services that had the highest malpractice insurance 
 premiums. Read that as meaning that those hospitals dropped obstetrics 
 departments and refused obstetrics services to all women. These women can 
 still find hospitals that offer such services but the distances are further 
 and the lines are longer and the services are not nearly as good in many 
 instances.


Also the outstanding orthopaedic hospital in Boston where my wife now has 
 spinal surgeries dropped its emergency room services. An externality of 
 Romney care was reduced medical services for all patients, including those 
 that have premium medical insurance plans from employers. Those on premium 
 plans have fewer choices for emergency rooms and trauma centers because of 
 Romney Care.


There&apos;s a huge difference between General Motors and the government when it 
 comes to budget cutting. General Motors cannot print money and reached a 
 point where it was impossible to meet pension and health care contracts with 
 retirees. In that case the bankruptcy court modified the contracts. In the 
 case of government pensions and medical benefits for retirees, rather than 
 declare bankruptcy our Federal government will probably just print the money 
 needed to honor the contracts. Welcome to Zimbabwe.


Our state governments like California are in more of a bind. State 
 governments might have to declare bankruptcy and have the bankruptcy courts 
 restructure retirement contracts. At one time Canada came close to losing 
 its national government in favor of provincial governments that would, among 
 other things, print their own currencies. This is no longer entirely out of 
 the question for our 50 states in the United States who would like an option 
 to print their own currencies.


As far as&quot;privileges&quot;within government budget items deemed discretionary, 
 the top privileges typically go to public safety. Police, fire, and National 
 Guard budgets are being cut somewhat but they are protected from enormous 
 cuts by fears in the minds of voters. As far as Federal government military 
 budgets are concerned, an extremely expensive item in budgets is for 
 advanced warfare and defense technology. However, not many voters are 
 willing to fall behind our enemies on warfare technology, including 
 technology for blocking communications --- such as when an unnamed 
 advanced-technology nation allegedly shut down the nuclear centrifuges in 
 Iran.


Another extremely expensive budget item is our CIA, but not many voters will 
 accept CIA budget cuts on the premise that&quot;ignorance is bliss.&quot;


It&apos;s one thing to point out research about tax increases and spending cuts 
 on a very broad scale, but when it comes to specifics it becomes an 
 explosive debate that can be political suicide. We now have two choices with 
 trillions in budget deficits. We can raise taxes and make huge spending 
 cuts. Or we keep putting off remedies like we&apos;ve done for the past two 
 decades at reach a point where it&apos;s no longer possible to save the patient.


Some professors in ivory towers might think it is possible to totally 
 eliminate our international fighting force in favor of a beefed up domestic 
 police force. But the unfunded expenses of past wars will continue to linger 
 over our heads. And it&apos;s questionable how many terror attacks this nation is 
 willing to experience with an impotent international fighting force for 
 prevention of future attacks.


But I really don&apos;t want to get into the question of line item budget cuts. 
 This is also probably too explosive for the AECM in terms of politics. We 
 can, however, debate broad issues like whether it&apos;s possible to tax 
 ourselves out of trillion dollar deficits with very little serious budget 
 cutting.

&quot; How a big US bank laundered billions from Mexico&apos;s murderous drug gangs ,&quot;by Ed Vulliamy, The Guardian , April 3, 2011 ---
 http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/03/us-bank-mexico-drug-gangs 
|Thank you Robert Walker for the heads up.
 
 As the violence spread, billions of dollars of 
 cartel cash began to seep into the global financial system. But a special 
 investigation by the Observer reveals how the increasingly frantic warnings 
 of one London whistleblower were ignored 

 On 10 April 2006, a DC-9 jet landed in the port 
 city of Ciudad del Carmen, on the Gulf of Mexico, as the sun was setting. 
 Mexican soldiers, waiting to intercept it, found 128 cases packed with 5.7 
 tons of cocaine, valued at $100m. But something else more important and 
 far-reaching was discovered in the paper trail behind the purchase of the 
 plane by the Sinaloa narco-trafficking cartel. 

 During a 22-month investigation by agents from the 
 US Drug Enforcement Administration, the Internal Revenue Service and others, 
 it emerged that the cocaine smugglers had bought the plane with money they 
 had laundered through one of the biggest banks in the United States: 
 Wachovia, now part of the giant Wells Fargo. 

 The authorities uncovered billions of dollars in 
 wire transfers, traveller&apos;s cheques and cash shipments through Mexican 
 exchanges into Wachovia accounts. Wachovia was put under immediate 
 investigation for failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering 
 programme. Of special significance was that the period concerned began in 
 2004, which coincided with the first escalation of violence along the 
 US-Mexico border that ignited the current drugs war. 

 Criminal proceedings were brought against Wachovia, 
 though not against any individual, but the case never came to court. In 
 March 2010, Wachovia settled the biggest action brought under the US bank 
 secrecy act, through the US district court in Miami. Now that the year&apos;s&quot;deferred prosecution&quot;has expired, the bank is in effect in the clear. It 
 paid federal authorities $110m in forfeiture, for allowing transactions 
 later proved to be connected to drug smuggling, and incurred a $50m fine for 
 failing to monitor cash used to ship 22 tons of cocaine. 

 More shocking, and more important, the bank was 
 sanctioned for failing to apply the proper anti-laundering strictures to the 
 transfer of $378.4bn a sum equivalent to one-third of Mexico&apos;s gross 
 national product into dollar accounts from so-called casas de cambio (CDCs) 
 in Mexico, currency exchange houses with which the bank did business. 

 &quot;Wachovia&apos;s blatant disregard for our banking laws 
 gave international cocaine cartels a virtual carte blanche to finance their 
 operations,&quot;said Jeffrey Sloman, the federal prosecutor. Yet the total fine 
 was less than 2% of the bank&apos;s $12.3bn profit for 2009. On 24 March 2010, 
 Wells Fargo stock traded at $30.86 up 1% on the week of the court 
 settlement.

Disability Entitlements: Being Declared Disabled has More Benefits Than 
Working
Between the ages of 0 and 200, disability pay and medical payments go on

The system is racked with fraud
Cost averages $1,500 annually for each and every taxpayer in the U.S.
&quot;College Enrollment Fell Slightly in 2010,&quot;by Catherine Rampell, The New 
York Times (Economix(, April 9, 2011 ---
 http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/09/college-enrollment-fell-slightly-in-2010/ 
 
 In the worst economic times of the 1950s and 60s, 
 about 9 percent of men in the prime of their working lives (25 to 54 years 
 old) were not working. At the depth of the severe recession in the early 
 1980s, about 15 percent of prime-age men were not working. Today, more than 
 18 percent of such men arent working. 

 Thats a depressing statistic: nearly one out of 
 every five men between 25 and 54 is not employed. Yes, some of them are 
 happily retired. Some are going to school. And some are taking care of their 
 children. But most dont fall into any of these categories. They simply 
 arent working. Theyre managing to get by some other way. 

 For growing numbers of these men, the federal 
 disability program is a significant source of support. Disabled workers 
 men and women received $115 billion in benefits last year and another $75 
 billion in medical costs. (Disability recipients become eligible for 
 Medicare two years after starting to receive benefits.) That $190 billion 
 sum is the equivalent of about $1,500 in taxes for each American household. 

 Yet disability usually goes unlargely uncovered by 
 the media. Lately, it hasnt . Motoko Rich of The Times and Damian Paletta of The Wall Street Journal have 
 both written richly detailed articles recently .

 You can play amateur psychologist with new revelations from Bernie Madoff 
behind bars 

&quot;From behind bars, Madoff spins his story,&quot; by David Gelles and Gillian 
Tett, Financial Times, April 8, 2011 ---
 http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/a29d2b4a-60b7-11e0-a182-00144feab49a.html?ftcamp=traffic/email/regsnl//memmkt/#axzz1JVhNNEee  
 
 We are cruising through North Carolina on a foggy 
 morning in late March, heading up to its rural north. Our route takes us 
 through swampland shrouded in a thick mist; spruce trees and an occasional 
 pink dogwood line the interstate. Butner, population 6,391, is our 
 destination. 

 The town is home to a vast federal prison complex 
 that includes a hospital, a minimum security unit and two medium security 
 facilities. Since July 14 2009, arguably the most notorious inmate at FCI 
 Butner Medium I has been Bernard Lawrence Madoff, the disgraced New York 
 financier who orchestrated a $65bn Ponzi scheme, among the biggest financial 
 frauds of all time. He is prisoner 61727-054. 

 When the Madoff scandal broke in 2008, a Financial 
 Times reporter learnt that two acquaintances of his were close to the 
 Madoffs and passed along an invitation for any member of the family to speak 
 with the paper. For more than a year, there was silence. Then, early last 
 December, the reporter received an e-mail from Madoff himself. Following 
 sporadic correspondence, and at very short notice, a message came from the 
 prison: Madoff would meet with the FT. 

  It is only the second time he has agreed to 
 meet a reporter in prison. But as we drive north, we wonder if this man who 
 built his career on lies will tell us the truth. Or when we get to the 
 prison, will he simply vanish like all those billions in his Ponzi scheme? 
 Crossing rusted train tracks, we drive a couple of miles and arrive at the 
 main intersection of this one-traffic-light town. 

 Butner revolves around the prison. Its centre is 
 just a clutch of convenience stores and a petrol station. In search of 
 strong coffee we consult an iPhone: the nearest Starbucks is 18.4 miles 
 away. Instead, we go to a diner and order the classic southern fare of 
 biscuits and grits. The coffee is terrible. 

 . . . 

 Exactly when the Ponzi scheme started is actually a 
 matter of dispute. The trustee seeking to retrieve assets for Madoffs 
 victims, Irving Picard, says the fraud began as early as 1983. But Madoff 
 denies this, telling us that in the 1980s, at least, he was making plenty of 
 legitimate trades. [The prosecutors] came up with this idea that I came up 
 with this whole legitimate business to come up with this fraud, he says. 
 That is wrong. In the end I left $1bn on the table. I had access to any 
 Swiss bank and offshore bank in the world if I had wanted to stash money. 
 But it wasnt about the money. 

 To hear Madoff say it was not about the money 
 strikes us as improbable. He spent lavishly on his lifestyle; after the 
 fraud was revealed, authorities uncovered $75m in a Gibraltar bank account 
 and millions in jewelry and luxury goods. These were reminders of how much 
 Madoff personally had to lose. He was on the board of Yeshiva University and 
 a regular at charity balls in Manhattan. He and Ruth holidayed in Monte 
 Carlo, where she liked to shop. 

 We ask why he didnt just hand the money back to 
 investors. After all, he says that in 1992 he was already a fairly wealthy 
 man, since the market-making operation was performing well. Ego, he 
 explains. Put yourself in my place. Your whole career you are outside the 
 club but then suddenly you have all the big banks Deutsche Bank, Credit 
 Suisse all their chairmen, knocking on your door and asking, Can you do 
 this for me? 

 [I was] under a lot of pressure a lot, he 
 mutters. And I was embarrassed. It was the first time in my life that 
 something hadnt worked. I was just dumb. Dumb! Starting in the early 1990s 
 there were no trades. It was just paper. But let me tell you, he adds 
 forcefully. It looked real. 

 Once the Ponzi scheme was under way, it required a 
 constant influx of new cash. Madoff began taking on clients referred to him 
 by existing ones, who were inclined to keep their money parked with him 
 because of the steady returns. At some point Madoff never makes it clear 
 exactly when the real trading ceased altogether, and he began forging 
 trade records for clients. And he says Picower, Chais, Levy and Shapiro 
 his big four clients knew something was amiss. They were complicit, all 
 of them, he says. 

 Madoffs accusations cannot be corroborated. None 
 of the four families has been charged with criminal wrongdoing. Picower is 
 dead, and his estate settled for $7.2bn; his lawyers maintain he was not 
 aware of the fraud. Levy is dead and his family settled for $220m. Chais is 
 dead; his family denies any wrongdoing and has not settled. And Shapiro, the 
 only one still alive, settled for $625m but denies any wrongdoing and has 
 not been accused by authorities of being complicit. In the words of his 
 lawyer, Mr Madoff is a liar. These latest statements are no more believable 
 than all the other lies that Madoff told his investors and the authorities 
 for decades. 

 On its surface, the fraud looked real enough to 
 attract a steady stream of new investors, and not just from the US. 
 According to Madoff, there were rich clients on both sides of the Atlantic 
 eager to use his services to dodge local regulations. In France, for 
 example, wealthy clients initially invested with him in order to avoid rules 
 that prevented them from exporting francs. 

 I did it for all of them so many important 
 people from France and elsewhere, says Madoff. That woman from LOral, 
 Christian Dior, so many I even impressed myself. They came up to my office 
 to meet me. They really wanted to deal with me. The woman from LOral 
 Madoff refers to is Liliane Bettencourt, one of Europes richest women. 

 The returns on Madoffs funds were not 
 extraordinarily high, running at about 10 per cent; however, they were 
 steady, which appealed to conservative European investors. Clients were also 
 reassured by the apparently close ties that Madoff enjoyed to respected 
 French and Swiss banks, such as Union Bancaire Prive. 

 Not everybody in Europe was keen to deal with the 
 fund: Socit Gnrale, for example, stayed away. But most investors seemed 
 impressed by Madoffs black box. Some also suspected that Madoff might be 
 using inside information to give him an edge. That added to his allure. 
 The Swiss thought this they are the most suspicious of all, Madoff says, 
 revealing a dislike that may stem from his Jewish heritage and the actions 
 of some Swiss banks in relation to Nazi Germany. Slimy people. 

 In the US, Madoff used his powerful network of 
 contacts across the wealthy Jewish community to lure money. By this time, 
 Madoff had moved into the very heart of the financial club he once 
 scorned. He was appointed the chairman of the Nasdaq index, to the board of 
 the Depository Trust&amp;Clearing Corporation, and was vice-chairman of the 
 NASD, his industrys self-regulatory body. 

 This did not prevent the regulators from watching 
 him. In 2002 I had a contact with the SEC, who were concerned that I was 
 front-running, he recalls, referring to the practice of using insider 
 information to inform trades. I started laughing to myself I knew I 
 wasnt because I wasnt doing the trades. Some of his rivals also asked why 
 his returns were so steady. Harry Markopolos, a fund manager, was so 
 suspicious that he filed reports to the SEC in 2000, and again in 2005, 
 suggesting that Madoff was running a Ponzi scheme. Markopolos was the 
 biggest idiot in the world, recalls Madoff, displaying his first flash of 
 anger, blinking hard again. He had a hedge fund that couldnt make money 
 and his clients abandoned him [so he called the regulators]. 

 But the regulators did not crack down. The 
 regulators get calls all the time, Madoff says. They didnt investigate 
 because I had the reputation at the time for being the gold standard. I had 
 all the credibility. Nobody could believe at that time that I would do 
 something like that. Why would I? Stupidity that is why. But remember that 
 when people asked me about the strategy, it made sense. I was big, 
 credible. 

 . . . 

 As we leave the prison, we are still not sure where 
 the truth ends and his lies begin. What we know is that this is a man who 
 mercilessly ran a Ponzi scheme for at least 16 years, corrupted the 
 financial system, destroyed lives and bankrupted families and charities. 
 Yet, in the flesh, Madoff spins a credible tale of how a renegade 
 entrepreneur conquered Wall Street and was drawn into crime by 
 personalities and forces he could not control. It sounds almost convincing; 
 or at least no more absurd than many of the other stories we hear every day 
 in western finance. 

 The fact that so much of Madoffs story is so 
 commonplace on Wall Street the tax shelters, black boxes and mysterious 
 returns is what allowed him to go undetected for so long. And this is why 
 Madoff has sent chills through investors at every level. If the most 
 sophisticated minds in finance were easily duped through an elementary 
 scheme run by one of their own, how can anyone with money invested in the 
 modern financial system know who to trust? This bedevilling question is why 
 Madoff cannot be ignored, even as he languishes in a North Carolina prison.

&quot; An Honest Services Crisis: Professional Poison and a Chicago Connection ,&quot;by Francine Mckenna, re:TheAuditors , March 30, 2011 ---

 Where do bad folks go when 
 they die? They dont go to heaven where the angels fly. 

 This guest post is by Mark OConnor, CEO and 
 Cofounder of Monadnock Research . 

 Phyllobates Terribilis , the golden poison dart 
 frog (not to be confused with, or metaphorically associated with  Nectophrynoides 
 Deloittei ), is the second most toxic creature on 
 earth. Hold him in your hand and youll barely feel hes there. But touch 
 him and your heart will stop within minutes. This little guy normally sports 
 a coat of batrachotoxin, an alkaloid neurotoxin, sufficient to quickly kill 
 up to 10 mature adults. But take him out of his element and hes just a cute 
 harmless yellow frog a frog with a latent capability to process poisonous 
 plants and insects, and secrete deadly neurotoxins. 

 Things are not always as they appear. 

 Every time I hear allegations of professional 
 services misconduct involving a Chicago accountant, consultant, or lawyer, I 
 send Francine McKenna an email. The title of my first missive on the subject 
 in August 2009 was, Are You Living at Ground Zero for Criminals in 
 Suits? 

 It appears to be a worry that Francine and I share. 
 There also appears to be no other metro area on earth with such a high 
 concentration of indictments and lawsuits in the last 10 years. We can only 
 hope its an aberration. In Chicagos defense, the city is also within an 
 hours flight of a corporate headquarters concentration that has few rivals. 
 Professional services is big business in Chicago. I would expect it to be 
 one of the professions most active news hubs. I just wish it was better 
 news for clients and the consulting profession. 

 Our interest at Monadnock 
 Research is primarily consulting and advisory 
 services. The Big Four, off and on, have had some of the largest global 
 consulting practices across most categories. Later Ill share our view of 
 the unique operational and strategic levers of the Big Four firms. But first 
 Id like to provide some background on the numbers from a recent piece of 
 our research ( Vol 
 IV, No 9 ), and what I would characterize as 
 todays honest services crisis. 

 Fiscal 2010 Big Four Consulting and 
 Advisory Services Revenues 

 

 Global non-audit advisory services reported by the 
 Big Four firms, including tax, again broke the $50 billion (USD) mark in 
 fiscal 2010 after retreating briefly in 2009, a 3.23 percent increase. Total 
 non-tax advisory services of Deloitte, KPMG, PwC, and E&amp;Y were $27.8 
 billion, an increase of 8.1 percent over 09. Deloitte tops the rankings as 
 the largest global provider of advisory, including tax, with $14.9 billion, 
 edging out PwCs at a little under $13.3 billion. E&amp;Y was third with $11.19 
 billion and KPMG finished its fiscal year with $10.72 billion.

 Hedge Funds Had Bets Against Japan 
 by: Gregory Zuckerman and Tom Lauricella
Date: Mar 15, 2011 
 SUMMARY: The catastrophe in Japan has placed renewed focus on the country&apos;s 
 already fragile economy-and brought unexpected profits to investors who have 
 long bet that the nation eventually will be dragged down by its debt 
 problems. 

DISCUSSION: 

 What is a hedge fund? How is a hedge fund different from mutual 
 funds or individual investing? What type of investor would invest in 
 such funds? What are the risk levels involved with investing in hedge 
 funds? How did these hedge funds &apos;bet against Japan&apos;? Why did some 
 investors think it wise to invest this way? How has the earthquake in 
 Japan impacted this type of investment? What were the issues facing Japan before the earthquake? How has the 
 earthquake changed the situation? What is the long-term outlook for 
 business in the country? What are Japan&apos;s borrowing levels? How would 
 this impact investment in the country by businesses? By individuals? 
 
&quot;Hedge Funds Had Bets Against Japan,&quot;by: Gregory Zuckerman and Tom 
Lauricella, The Wall Street Journal, March 15, 2011 ---
 http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703363904576200990107993916.html?mod=djem_jie_360 
 
 The catastrophe in Japan has placed renewed focus 
 on the country&apos;s already fragile economyand brought unexpected profits to 
 investors who have long bet that the nation eventually will be dragged down 
 by its debt problems. 

 In recent years, a chorus of voices has warned that 
 Japan is facing an inevitable crisis to be brought on by a stagnant economy, 
 a shrinking population and the worst debt profile of any major 
 industrialized country. 

 Hedge-fund managers from Kyle Bass of Hayman 
 Advisors LP in Dallas to smaller firms like Commonwealth Opportunity Capital 
 have made money since the earthquake on long-held bets on Japan&apos;s government 
 and corporate bonds. 

 Though the economic toll of the earthquake is far 
 from clear, the immediate response in the financial markets has been a 
 decline in stock prices, with the Nikkei Stock Average down 7.8% in two days 
 (including Friday, when the quake hit near the end of the trading day). The 
 price for insuring against a default by Japan on its government debt, a 
 popular way to position for a financial crisis in Japan, has jumped. But in 
 a move that runs counter to the expectations of some long-term Japan bears, 
 the yen has strengthened on expectations that Japanese investors and 
 corporations will be buying yen as they bring money home in coming weeks and 
 months. 

 The price for insuring $10 million of Japanese 
 sovereign debt for five years in the credit-default-swap market soared to 
 $103,000 on Monday, from $79,000 on Friday, according to data provider 
 Markit. 

 Reflecting the skepticism about Japan&apos;s outlook, 
 even before the disaster, the net notional amount of Japanese debt being 
 insured in the swaps market had surged to $7.4 billion from $4.1 billion a 
 year ago, according to data from the Depository Trust&amp;Clearing Corp. 
 through March 4. The number of contracts outstanding has more than doubled. 

 Fresh DTCC data are due on Tuesday and will include 
 only the early effects of the earthquake. 

 Credit-default swaps of many corporate bonds have 
 become even more valuable, rewarding those that bet on them. Among the 
 biggest moves was in Tokyo Electric Power Co., owner of the nuclear-power 
 plants crippled by the earthquake. 

 Commonwealth Opportunity Capital, a $90 million 
 hedge fund in Los Angeles, made a profit of several million dollars on Tokyo 
 Electric on Monday, from an investment of less than $200,000. The annual 
 cost of protecting $10 million of Tokyo Electric&apos;s debt jumped to $240,000 
 on Monday from $40,700 on Friday. 

 &quot;Nobody wants bad things to happen to people,&quot;said 
 Adam Fisher, who helps run Commonwealth Opportunity Capital. He said the 
 firm has been betting against Japanese corporate bonds for two years.&quot;But 
 it shows how fragile that heavily levered nation is; there&apos;s very little 
 margin for error.&quot; 

 Betting against Japan has been a losing proposition 
 for many investors for years. Despite all the debt problems, bond prices 
 have continued to move higher partly because deflation, not inflation, has 
 been the concern. Also, domestic investors own most of the government&apos;s debt 
 and have been reluctant to sell. 

 But now, facing at least a short-term hit to the 
 economy from the earthquake and the likely need to issue more debt to pay 
 for reconstruction efforts, Japan is seeing its problems magnified. 

 &quot;Japan&apos;s choices are very, very bad,&quot;said John 
 Mauldin, president of Millennium Wave Advisors.&quot;Japan has an aging 
 population, which is saving less, their savings rate will go negative 
 sometime in the next few years at which point they will have to 
 significantly reduce their spending, increase taxes or print money or some 
 combination of the three. 

 &quot;In the grand scheme of things, does the earthquake 
 technically move it up further? Yes, but they were already well down the 
 path.&quot;

Jensen Comment
Note how long positions on national debt are often a losing proposition unless 
they are hedges. In hedging situations these gains and losses are offset by 
gains and losses on the hedged items to the extent that the hedging contracts 
are effective. For example, a hedge fund might invest in U.S. Treasury bonds 
paying a fixed rate. There is no cash flow risk on interest payments or 
repayment of the face value of the bonds. However, there is value risk since the 
price of these outstanding bonds in the financial markets goes up and down 
daily. The hedge fund can lock in fixed value by entering into a fair value 
hedge such as by entering into a plain vanilla interest rate swap in which the 
fixed-amount interest payments are swapped for variable rate payments. The value 
of the bonds plus the value of the swap is thereby locked into a fixed value for 
which there is no value risk. However, when hedging value risk the investor has 
inevitably taken on cash flow risk. It&apos;s impossible to hedge both fair value 
risk and cash flow risk. Investors must choose between one or the other.

Hedging against debt default entire is an extreme form of fair value hedging 
and is usually done with a different type of hedging contract. Here the investor 
is not so much concerned with interim interest payments (or interim changes in 
value due to shifts in market interest rates) as he/she is concerned with 
possible default on payback of the entire principal of the debt. In other words 
it&apos;s more like insurance against a creditor declaring bankruptcy to get out of 
repayment of all or a great portion of debt repayment.

Credit Default Swap --- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_default_swap 
 
 A credit default swap (CDS) can almost be thought 
 of as a form of insurance. If a borrower of money does not repay her loan, 
 she&quot;defaults.&quot;If a lender has purchased a CDS on that loan from an 
 insurance company, the lender can then use the default as a credit to swap 
 it in exchange for a repayment from an insurance company. However, one does 
 not need to be the lender to profit from this situation. Anyone (usually 
 called a speculator ) can purchase a CDS. If a borrower does 
 not repay his loan on time and defaults not only does the lender get paid by 
 the insurance company, but the speculator gets paid as well. It is in the 
 lender&apos;s best interest that he gets his money back, either from the 
 borrower, or from the insurance company if the borrower is unable to pay 
 back his loan. However, it is in the speculator&apos;s best interest that the 
 borrower never repay his loan and default because that is the only way that 
 the speculator can then take that default, turn it into a credit, and swap 
 it for a cash payment from an insurance company. 

 A more technical way of looking at it is that a credit default swap (CDS) is a swap c ontract and agreement in which the 
 protection buyer of the CDS makes a series of payments (often referred to as 
 the CDS&quot;fee&quot;or&quot;spread&quot;) to the protection seller and, in exchange, 
 receives a payoff if a credit instrument (typically a bond or loan) experiences a credit 
 event . It is a form of reverse trading .

 A credit default swap is a bilateral contract 
 between the buyer and seller of protection. The CDS will refer to a&quot;reference entity&quot;or&quot;reference obligor&quot;, usually a corporation or 
 government. The reference entity is not a party to the contract. The 
 protection buyer makes quarterly premium paymentsthe&quot;spread&quot;to the 
 protection seller. If the reference entity defaults, the protection seller 
 pays the buyer the par value of the bond in exchange for physical delivery of the 
 bond, although settlement may also be by cash or auction . A default is referred to as a &quot; credit 
 event &quot;a nd includes such events as failure to pay, 
 restructuring and bankruptcy. [2] Most CDSs are in the $10$20 million range with maturities between one and 
 10 years. 

 A holder of a bond may buy protection to hedge 
 its risk of default. In this way, a CDS is similar to credit insurance, 
 although CDS are not similar to or subject to regulations governing casualty 
 or life insurance. Also, investors can buy and sell protection without 
 owning any debt of the reference entity. These naked credit default swaps 
 allow traders to speculate on debt issues and the creditworthiness of 
 reference entities. Credit default swaps can be used to create synthetic 
 long and short positions in the reference entity. Naked CDS constitute most of the market in CDS. In addition, credit default swaps can 
 also be used in capital structure arbitrage. 

 Credit default swaps have existed since the early 
 1990s, but the market increased tremendously starting in 2003. By the end of 
 2007, the outstanding amount was $62.2 trillion, falling to $38.6 trillion 
 by the end of 2008. 

 Most CDSs are documented using standard forms 
 promulgated by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) , although some are tailored to meet specific needs. 
 Credit default swaps have many variations. [2] In addition to the basic, single-name swaps, there are basket default swaps 
 (BDS), index CDS, funded CDS (also called a credit linked notes), as well as 
 loan only credit default swaps (LCDS). In addition to corporations or 
 governments, the reference entity can include a special purpose vehicle 
 issuing asset backed securities .

 Credit default swaps are not traded on an exchange 
 and there is no required reporting of transactions to a government agency. During the 2007-2010 financial crisis the lack of 
 transparency became a concern to regulators, as was the trillion dollar size 
 of the market, which could pose a systemic risk to the economy. In March 2010, the DTCC Trade 
 Information Warehouse (see Sources of Market Data ) announced it would 
 voluntarily give regulators greater access to its credit default swaps 
 database 
 
 Credit Default Swap (CDS) 
This is an insurance policy that essentially&quot;guarantees&quot;that if a CDO goes bad 
due to having turds mixed in chocolates in a diversified portfolio, the&quot;counterparty&quot;who purchased the CDO will recover the value fraudulently 
invested in turds. On September 30, 2008 Gretchen Morgenson of The New York 
Times aptly explained that the huge CDO underwriter of CDOs was the 
insurance firm called AIG. She also explained that the first $85 billion given 
in bailout money by Hank Paulson to AIG was to pay the counterparties to CDS 
swaps. She also explained that, unlike its casualty insurance operations, AIG 
had no capital reserves for paying the counterparties for the the turds they 
purchased from Wall Street investment banks.

What Ms. Morgenson failed to explain, when Paulson eventually gave over $100 
billion for AIG&apos;s obligations to counterparties in CDS contracts, was who were 
the counterparties who received those bailout funds. It turns out that most of 
them were wealthy Arabs and some Asians who we were getting bailed out while 
Paulson was telling shareholders of WaMu, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch to 
eat their turds.

 Forged mortgage paperwork mess: the next housing shock and toxic mold 
threats? 

I have written tens of thousands of tidbits over the years. Aside from my 
tidbits on wars, deficits/entitlements, and unemployment, I think my most 
depressing tidbits are on the corrupted real estate deed registries of virtually 
all counties in the 50 states if America. The major reason for this corruption 
is that, after the subprime bubble burst in 2008, megabanks and Wall Street 
brokerage houses lost track of mortgage paperwork on millions of real estate 
parcels. These banks/brokerages then forged new copies of the mortgages, often 
with fictitious names of bank officials where the loans originated. When these 
properties were then foreclosed or otherwise resold to new buyers, the forged 
mortgages became part of recorded deeds, thereby corrupting the deed registries 
across the entire United States.

 If there was a question about whether we&apos;re headed 
 for a second housing shock, that was settled last week with news that home 
 prices have fallen a sixth consecutive month. Values are nearly back to 
 levels of the Great Recession. One thing weighing on the economy is the huge 
 number of foreclosed houses. 

 Many are stuck on the market for a reason you 
 wouldn&apos;t expect: banks can&apos;t find the ownership documents. 

 Who really owns your mortgage? 
 Scott Pelley explains a bizarre aftershock of the U.S. financial 
 collapse: An epidemic of forged and missing mortgage documents. 

 It&apos;s bizarre but, it turns out, Wall Street cut 
 corners when it created those mortgage-backed investments that triggered the 
 financial collapse. Now that banks want to evict people, they&apos;re unwinding 
 these exotic investments to find, that often, the legal documents behind the 
 mortgages aren&apos;t there

Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO) or Structured Asset Backed Security 
(CABS) --- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateralized_debt_obligation 

Registered deeds keep legal track over the years of all real estate in the 
United States. Often the owners have taken out mortgages that give lenders 
priority claims on the real estate ownership when owners default on mortgage 
lending contracts. It&apos;s important to note that names of mortgage investors, 
along with the property owners, are written into the recorded deeds. Before a 
buyer purchases real estate the chronological records of recorded deeds on the 
property are generally searched by legal experts who then certify and sometimes 
insure that the buyer will have a clear title to the purchased property.

If mortgages referenced in recorded deeds are forged, the recorded deeds are 
thereby corrupted. Present owners accordingly do not have clear titles to the 
purchased real estate. This includes John and Jane Doe now living in their home 
at 123 Main Street. It also includes Fannie Mae, Freddie Mack, Goldman Sachs, 
Bank of America, JP Morgan, and most of the other megabanks inside and outside 
the United States. All are waiting for former owners to file lawsuits claiming 
damages because of forged documents (including lawsuits from owners who simply 
abandoned their houses because they could not make the mortgage payments and 
those that got forced out by foreclosure proceedings).

The FDIC claims that probably the only way out of this mess is for the large 
banks and brokerages who in one way or another are responsible for the document 
forgeries to pay tens of billions into a&quot;clean up fund&quot;to be administered by 
the government to make claimants accept cash settlements and relinquish their 
rights to sue over forged or missing documents. This may be the only way to 
clear the titles to registered deeds, including the deeds on millions of empty 
homes that now cannot be sold until the titles are cleared of the forged 
recorded paperwork.

 

 A Summary of How This Mess Came About 

 1. 
The main cause of this mess roots back to a time when banks and mortgage 
companies that initially approve mortgage contracts commenced selling all their 
mortgage investments to downstream investors like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Bear 
Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, and virtually all the large 
international banks and Wall Street brokerages. Some like Bank of America did 
not directly buy many of these downstream mortgages but later inherited millions 
of mortgages such as when Bank of America bought the troubled Countrywide and JP 
Morgan bought the troubled Wachovia as part of the TARP deals engineered by the 
U.S. Treasury Department. It took until 2011 for the FDIC to finally 
mandate that original lenders must retain&quot;some skin&quot;in the mortgages sold 
downstream (currently at least 5% of the financial risk skin). That was not the 
case when the subprime bubble burst in 2008.

 


 2. 
Another leading cause was the common 1990s practice of issuing subprime interest 
rate mortgages where interest in the early years was below prime rates with a 
clause that higher rates would eventually kick in several years down the road. 
Even current owners were tempted to abandon their fixed rate mortgages and 
refinance with subprime mortgages with the intent of flipping their homes before 
the higher rates kicked in with payments they could not afford. The plan was to 
sell their houses at huge gains and move up the hill to bigger houses and better 
neighborhoods. All of this was predicated on the assumption that the price 
bubble in real estate would never burst. But in 2008 it did burst and millions 
of home owners could no longer make their mortgage payments when the subprime 
rates gave way to double-digit rates. Low income people defaulted in droves, but 
higher income people also defaulted. Some very high income people bought 
mansions on the hill at subprime rates hoping to turn those mansions over for 
enormous profits as long as housing prices in America kept going up and up. CBS 
Sixty Minutes captured the essence of what happened when the bubble burst.
 
 CBS Sixty Minutes featured how bad things became when poison was added to loan 
portfolios. This older Sixty Minutes Module is entitled&quot; House of Cards &quot;--- http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=3756665n&amp;tag=contentMain;contentBody 
This segment can be understood without much preparation except that it would 
help for viewers to first read about Mervene and how the mortgage lenders 
brokering the mortgages got their commissions for poisoned mortgages passed 
along to the government (Freddie Mack and Fannie Mae) and Wall Street banks. On 
some occasions the lenders like Washington Mutual also naively kept some of the 
poison planted by some of their own greedy brokers.
The cause of this fraud was separating the compensation for brokering mortgages 
from the responsibility for collecting the payments until the final payoff 
dates.

 3. 
The eventual downstream owners of these risky subprime mortgages invented a way 
of diversifying default risk by putting together and selling portfolios of 
mortgages known as Collateralized Debt Obligation portfolios. Buyers included 
many wealthy investors in the Middle East and Asia. Forest Gump describes a CDO 
portfolio as a box of chocolates with mostly small pieces of good mortgages with 
a few turds thrown in (small pieces of mortgages are likely to go into default 
by owners who cannot afford their mortgage payments). Note that a CDO portfolio 
does not 100% of any mortgage investment. Rather it contains like a 1% piece of 
a mortgage spread over 100 CDO portfolios. This is important because this 
slicing and dicing shredding of financial risk is where much of the original 
paperwork got lost .

 Mortgage Backed Securities are like boxes of 
chocolates. Criminals (bankers and brokers) on Wall Street and one particular U.S. Congressional Committee stole a few 
chocolates from the boxes and replaced them with turds. Their criminal buddies 
at Standard&amp;Poors rated these boxes AAA Investment Grade chocolates. These 
boxes were then sold all over the world to investors. Eventually somebody bites 
into a turd and discovers the crime. Suddenly nobody trusts American chocolates 
anymore worldwide. Hank Paulson now wants the American taxpayers to buy up and 
hold all these boxes of turd-infested chocolates for $700 billion dollars until 
the market for turds returns to normal. Meanwhile, Hank&apos;s buddies, the Wall 
Street criminals who stole all the good chocolates are not being investigated, 
arrested, or indicted. Momma always said:&quot;Sniff the chocolates first Forrest.&quot;Things generally don&apos;t pass the smell test if they came from Wall Street or from 
Washington DC.

Steve Kroft examines the complicated financial instruments known as credit 
default swaps and the central role they are playing in the unfolding economic 
crisis. The interview features my hero Frank Partnoy . I don&apos;t know of 
anybody who knows derivative securities contracts and frauds better than Frank 
Partnoy, who once sold these derivatives in bucket shops. You can find links to 
Partnoy&apos;s books and many, many quotations at http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/FraudRotten.htm#DerivativesFrauds 

For years I&apos;ve used the term&quot;bucket shop&quot;in financial securities marketing 
without realizing that the first bucket shops in the early 20th Century were 
bought and sold only gambles on stock pricing moves, not the selling of any 
financial securities. The analogy of a bucket shop would be a room full of 
bookies selling bets on NFL playoff games.
See&quot;Bucket Shop&quot;at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_shop_(stock_market) 

 

 5. 
So where does mortgage/deed forgeries enter into the picture.
It turns out that the Wall Street brokerage houses and megabanks that ended up 
downstream with the mortgages and then sliced and diced them into new 
securitization instruments called Mortgage Backed Obligation (MBO) portfolios 
completely lost track of the millions original mortgage paper work that they 
were shredding into millions of MBOs. Then when owners defaulted on their 
original subprime mortgages the megabanks and brokerages, gasp, could not find 
the original paperwork. Even worse, when responsible homeowners sold their homes 
and wanted to pay off their mortgages the megabanks and brokerages also could 
not find the original paperwork.

Horrors!
What&apos;s a megabank to do when new deeds have to be recorded and the current 
recorded deeds/mortgages cannot be located. What the megabanks essentially 
did was forge new paperwork . Not wanting to implicate their own employees in 
this fraud they hired sleazy mortgage servicing companies who in turn hired high 
school kids at minimum wage to forge thousands of names per hour (including 
forged notary public signatures). The megabanks now claim they did not know 
these forgeries were taking place, but if you believe this I&apos;ve got some ocean 
front property in Arizona and the Brooklyn Bridge that I would like to sell to 
those megabanks.

To see how all of this forgery really took place watch the following:

So where does this leave us now and why is this so serious? 

This leaves us with millions of corrupted deed registries containing 
references to forged documents. Current owners do not have clear titles to their 
properties, including megabanks holding corrupted titles to vacant homes.

Currently 13% of all the houses in America are vacant, including millions of 
double wides in mobile home parks and millions of mansions in every county of 
the United States. Owners, including megabanks, of these vacant houses do not 
have clear title do to forged documents. The houses cannot be sold with 
corrupted titles such that they sit vacant year after year.

Mold takes hold in the walls and ceilings of vacant homes that are not 
properly cooled and dehumidified in hot summer months and warmed in frigid 
winter months. The mold spreads more and more until it reaches toxic levels 
where real estate inspectors will not allow the homes to be sold. The bull 
dozers have to push through those double wides and even those mansions on the 
hill.

Now lawyers are hovering like vultures to commence the lawsuits on behalf of 
former owners such as owners thrown out of foreclosed houses and new owners who 
do not have clear titles to properties purchased in good faith ---
 http://wgroup.ning.com/ 

The FDIC is proposing a forged document cleanup fund where the megabanks 
responsible for using forged paperwork put up tens of billions of dollars into a 
fund to pay off the damaged former owners so that titles can be cleared on 
millions of homes now having corrupted deeds on file due to those forgeries. 
It&apos;s a little like how the BP fund in being administered for oil spill damages 
to employees and businesses along the Gulf Coast, only the forged mortgage fund 
has to be much, much, much larger.

What a mess!
 
&quot; Auditors negligent in Castor Holdings collapse, judge rules ,&quot;by 
Bertrand Marotte, The Globe and Mail , April 15, 2011 ---
 http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/auditors-negligent-in-castor-holdings-collapse-judge-rules/article1987707/  
Thank you David Albrecht for the heads up.
 
 A Quebec Superior Court judge has ruled that the 
 auditors for a real-estate-investment company at the centre of a 
 $1.6-billion financial collapse were negligent, ending a 12-year legal 
 battle by investors in Montreal-based Castor Holdings Ltd. 

 The whole team at our firm feels incredibly 
 exhilarated, said Mark Meland of Fishman Flanz Meland Paquin LLP, one of 
 the lead lawyers acting for the investors in Castor, which collapsed in 
 1992. 

 Its a big, big win. 

 Despite the epic length of the case, which is 
 believed to be the longest trial in Canadian history, Fridays ruling is not 
 likely to be the last word. Prior to the result, both sides said an appeal 
 was expected, no matter who won. 

 The Castor litigation, which is also believed to be 
 the largest auditors negligence case in Canada, could end up having broader 
 implications for the auditing profession across the country. 

 Many shareholder lawsuits against auditors don&apos;t 
 get very far because of previous court decisions that auditors cant be held 
 professionally responsible for misrepresentations by clients, said 
 Toronto-based forensic accountant Al Rosen. 

 Friday&apos;s decision may help bolster the case for 
 auditors&apos; responsibilities in situations where fraud or other financial 
 irregularities occur, he said. 

 I hope it wakes up the rest of Canada, but I&apos;m not 
 expecting any immediate change, he said. Perhaps it will encourage 
 lawmakers to pass tougher legislation. 

 Castor was the creation of German-Canadian 
 businessman Wolfgang Stolzenberg, who is on the RCMPs wanted list for 
 alleged fraud and believed to be living in Germany. 

 Following the collapse, a group of investors 
 including major European banks, Chrysler Canada Inc.s pension fund and two 
 Canadian credit unions filed lawsuits totalling about 
 $1-billion against Coopers&amp;Lybrand, Castors auditor, allegedly it failed 
 to properly audit the company. 

 Their case has dragged on for more than 16 years, 
 12 of them in court, and included the filing of more than 18,000 exhibits. 

 In a hefty 752-page decision released Friday, Madam 
 Justice Marie St-Pierre of the Quebec Superior Court ruled that Coopers&amp;Lybrand failed to perform its professional services as auditors, in 
 accordance with generally accepted auditing and accounting standards . 

 She said Coopers&amp;Lybrand also issued faulty 
 opinions concerning Castors financial situation. 

Continued in article
 

Jensen Comment
&quot;The judgment concluded that Castors audited financial statements for 1988, 
1989 and 1990 were materially misstated and misleading, and that Coopers&amp;Lybrand periodically issued other faulty opinions on its financial position from 
1988 to 1991.&quot;


This judgment reveals how slowly the wheels of justice often move. What would be 
the benefit versus cost of restating Castor&apos;s financial statements for 1988, 
1989 and 1990?


Are there any pending cases from the 19th Century or the stock market crash of 
1929?

 Bob Versus Steve on What Needs to Be Done to Improve The Accounting 
Review 

 

Hi Steve,Kachelmeier

Thank you for stepping out of your customary role as a lurker. I&apos;m glad you took 
the horse you rode off on and returned to the AECM pasture.

As I recall, you and most other members of the accounting academy do not 
really understand the origins of the term&quot;accountics&quot;as explained in
An Analysis of the Evolution of Research Contributions by The Accounting 
Review: 1926-2005, bu Jean Heck and Bob Jensen, Accounting Historians 
Journal , Volume 34, No. 2, December 2007, pp. 109-142. Jean generated the 
data and I did the analysis.
 
Accountics is the mathematical science of values. Charles Sprague [1887], 
 quoted in McMillan [1998, p. 1]

      Charles Sprague, an accounting professor at 
 Columbia University (then called Columbia College), coined the word 
 accountics in 1887. The word is not used today in accounting and 
 has some alternative meanings outside our discipline. However, in the early 
 20th century, accountics was the centerpiece of some unpublished lectures by 
 Sprague. McMillan [1998, p. 11] stated:

 These 
 claims were not a pragmatic strategy to legitimize the development of sophisticated bookkeeping theories. Rather, this development of a science 
 was seen as revealing long-hidden realities within the economic environment 
 and the double-entry bookkeeping system itself. The science of accounts, 
 through systematic mathematical analysis, could discover hidden thrust of 
 the reality of economic value. The term accountics captured the 
 imagination of the members of the IA, connoting advances in bookkeeping 
 that all these men were experiencing. 
 

By 1900, there was a journal 
 called Accountics [Forrester, 2003]. Both the journal and the term 
 accountics had short lives, but the belief that mathematical analysis and 
 empirical research can discover [the] hidden thrust of the reality of 
 economic value (see above) underlies much of what has been published in TAR over the past three decades. Hence, we propose reviving the term 
 accountics to describe the research methods and quantitative analysis 
 tools that have become popular in TAR and other leading accounting 
 research journals. We essentially define accountics as equivalent to the 
 scientific study of values in what Zimmerman [2001, p. 414] called agency 
 problems, corporate governance, capital asset pricing, capital budgeting, 
 decision analysis, risk management, queuing theory, and statistical audit 
 analysis.

      The American 
 Association of University Instructors of Accounting, which in December 1935 
 became the AAA, commenced unofficially in 1915 [Zeff, 1966, p. 5]. It was 
 proposed in October 1919 that the AAA publish a Quarterly Journal of 
 Accountics . T his proposed 
 accountics journal never got off the ground as leaders of the AAA argued 
 heatedly and fruitlessly about whether accountancy was a science. A 
 quarterly journal, The Accounting Review , was subsequently born in 
 1925, with its first issue published in March 1926. However, its 
 accountics-like attributes did not commence in earnest until the 1960s. 

       Practitioner involvement, in 
 large measure, was the reason for changing the name of the association to 
 the AAA by removing the words of University Instructors. Practitioners 
 interested in accounting education participated actively in AAA meetings. TAR articles in the first several decades were devoted heavily to 
 education and to accounting issues in particular industries and trade 
 groups. Research methodologies were mainly normative (without mathematics), 
 case study, and archival (history). Anecdotal evidence and hypothetical 
 illustrations ruled the day. The longest serving editor of TAR was 
 the practitioner Eric Kohler, who solely determined what was published in TAR between 1929 and 
 1943. In those years, when the AAA leadership mandated that TAR focus 
 on the development of accounting principles, publications were oriented to 
 both practitioners and educators [Chatfield, 1975, p. 4]. 

       Following World War II, 
 practitioners outnumbered educators in the AAA [Chatfield, 1975, p. 4]. 
 Leading partners from accounting firms took pride in publishing papers and 
 books intended to inspire scholarship among professors and students. Over 
 the years, some practitioners, particularly those with scholarly 
 publications, were admitted into the Accounting Hall of Fame founded by Ohio 
 State University. Prior to the 1960s, accounting educators were generally 
 long on practical experience and short on academic credentials, such as 
 doctoral degrees. 

      A major catalyst for 
 change in accounting research occurred when the Ford Foundation poured 
 millions of dollars into the study of collegiate business schools and the 
 funding of doctoral programs and students in business studies. Gordon and 
 Howell [1959] reported that business faculty in colleges lacked research 
 skills and academic esteem when compared to their colleagues in the 
 sciences. The Ford Foundation thereafter provided funding for doctoral 
 programs and for top-quality graduate students to pursue doctoral degrees in 
 business and accountancy. The Foundation even funded the publication of 
 selected doctoral dissertations to give doctoral studies in business more 
 visibility. Great pressure was also brought to bear on academic associations 
 like the AAA to increase the scientific standards for publications in 
 journals like TAR .

 

 TAR BETWEEN 1956 AND 1985: THE NURTURING OF ACCOUNTICS

      A perfect storm for 
 change in accounting research arose in the late 1950s and early 1960s. First 
 came the critical Pierson Carnegie Report [1959] and the Gordon and Howell 
 Ford Foundation Report [1959]. Shortly thereafter, the American Assembly of 
 Collegiate Schools of Business introduced a requirement requiring that a 
 certain percentage of faculty possess doctoral degrees for business 
 education programs seeking accreditation [ Bricker and 
 Previts, 1990]. Soon afterwards, both a doctorate and publication in 
 top accounting research journals became necessary for tenure [Langenderfer, 
 1987].

      A second component of 
 this perfect storm for change was the proliferation of mainframe computers, 
 the development of analytical software (e.g., early SPSS for mainframes), 
 and the dawning of management and decision sciences. The third huge 
 stimulus for changed research is rooted in portfolio theory, discovered by 
 Harry Markowitz in 1952 as the core of his dissertation at Princeton, which 
 was published in book form in 1959. This theory eventually gave birth to the 
 Nobel Prize-winning Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and a new era of 
 capital market research. A fourth stimulus was the availability of the CRSP 
 stock price tapes from the University of Chicago. The availability of CRSP 
 led to a high number of TAR articles on capital market event studies 
 (e.g., earnings announcements on trading prices and volumes) covering a 
 period of nearly 40 years.

      This perfect storm 
 roared into nearly all accounting and finance research and turned academic 
 accounting research into an accountics-centered science of values and 
 mathematical/statistical analysis. After 1960, there was a shift in TAR , 
 albeit slow at first, toward preferences for quantitative model building 
 econometric models in capital market studies, time series models in 
 forecasting, advanced calculus information science, information economics, 
 analytical models, and psychometric behavioral models. Chatfield [1975, p. 
 6] wrote the following:

   Beginning in the 1960s the Review published many more articles by 
 non- accountants, whose contribution involved showing how ideas or methods 
 from their own discipline could be used to solve particular accounting 
 problems. The more successful adaptations included matrix theory, 
 mathematical model building, 
 organization theory, linear programming, and Bayesian analysis.
  

 TAR was not alone in 
 moving toward a more quantitative focus. Accountics methodologies 
 accompanied similar quantitative model-building preferences in finance, 
 marketing, management science, decision science, operations research, 
 information economics, computer science, and information systems. Early 
 changes along these lines began to appear in other leading research journals 
 between 1956-1965, with some mathematical modeling papers noted by Dyckman 
 and Zeff [1984, p. 229]. Fleming et al. [2000, p. 43] documented additional 
 emphases on quantitative methodology between 1966 and 1985. In particular, 
 they noted how tenure requirements began to change and asserted the 
 following:
 
    The 
Accounting Review evolved into a journal with 
demanding acceptance standards whose leading authors were highly educated 
accounting academics who, to a large degree, brought methods and tools from 
other disciplines to bear upon accounting issues. 

  

 Challenge to You Steve 
Now that the AECM has you back, I would like to offer you a challenge as the 
outgoing Senior Editor of The Accounting Review :
 

1. I think it would be very interesting to have someone with your 
 outstanding reputation to examine all the articles published in TAR over the 
 past 20 years and identify those (with some documented evidence) that had a 
 significant impact on the practice/profession of accountancy and auditing. 
 As an example, I would suggest Eric Lie&apos;s study of option backdating that 
 won the 2007 AAA Notable Contributions to Accounting Award even though it 
 was published in Management Science and not an accounting journal. 
 The research also resulted in Eric becoming one of Time Magazine&apos;s Top 100 Most Influential People in the World. Eric is probably the only 
 accounting, finance, or business professor in history to make the Top 100 
 list reserved for important people like President Obama and Lady Gaga.


2. In relation to Task 1 above, it would be interesting to identify those 
 articles that should&apos;ve had more impact or will eventually have more impact, 
 in your opinion, on the practice/profession of accountancy and auditing. I 
 cannot think of a single person more suited for this type of review than you 
 Steve.


Keep in mind that your review will face critical tests by Bob Jensen, Paul 
 Williams, Bob Kaplan, Steve Zeff, Sue Ravenscroft, Jagdish Gangolly, Ken 
 Merchant, and various others.
 
 Accountics Controversies 
On the subject of accountics, I think many accounting faculty, students, and 
practitioners of all political persuasion find common ground for criticism of 
accountics research but the reasons vary.

Paul Williams believes deeply in the self-serving Conspiracy Theory that the 
quants, many of them not even well-versed in accounting, literally took over the 
R1 universities, the leading accounting research journals, the doctoral 
programs, the American Accounting Association, and to some extent the AACSB 
itself. He also believes they succeeded beyond their wildest dreams.

Some of the objections of Paul Williams and Jagdish Gangolly are summarized at
 http://www.trinity.edu/ rjensen/TheoryTAR.htm#Comments  
Paul has also published on this topic in some of the publications listed at
 http://www.poole.ncsu.edu/ index-exp.php/directory/ dossier/paul-williams/  
(he&apos;s much better looking than the unfortunate picture shown in the above 
document)

I am less inclined to accept the&quot;conspiracy theory&quot;as much as I would call it 
a&quot;Epidemiology Theory&quot;that applies to both professors of accounting and 
finance as well as many economists. The evolution of the rise of the accountics 
monopoly is summarized at
 http://www.trinity.edu/ rjensen/395wpTAR/Web/TAR395wp. htm   
Also see the Granof and Zeff summary at
 http://www.trinity.edu/ rjensen/TheoryTAR.htm# Appendix01  

Bob Kaplan really hit the nail on the head in his plenary address in August 2010 
in San Francisco. I was pleased to overhear you inviting Professor Kaplan to 
submit his remarks to The Accounting Review (while you were still the Senior 
Editor) ---
 http://www.trinity.edu/ rjensen/TheoryTAR.htm# Appendix01  
 

 Bob Kaplan Said It Best With His Epidemiology Analogy 
Sophisticated mining of large epidemiology databases is important in medical 
school research, but it only constitutes five percent or less of the research 
conducted in medical schools. Most of the research in medical schools. Medical 
schools are more focused on the micro-level research of improving medical such 
as improving how to transplant a pancreas or to reconstruct a badly damaged 
spine.

Now why do I call it a&quot;Epidemiology Theory&quot;rather than a&quot;Conspiracy Theory.&quot;
The greatest contribution scientists make comes from where they&quot;labor&quot;in their 
laboratories generating data and testing theories and hypotheses. Accounting and 
finance&quot;scientists&quot;do not collect data in laboratories for capital markets 
research using mostly macro databases purchased from data generating 
corporations such as the CRSP databases, the Compustat databases, the 
AuditAnalytic databases, etc.

Epidemiology Theory = identify a sophisticated mathematical and statistical 
model and then seek out hypotheses suitable to study purchased data to fit the 
model irrespective of the value of the ultimate findings in the world. The 
result is the glorification of accountics research on the basis of the tractors 
rather than the harvests. It&apos;s much more difficult to find an important problem 
in the world and then build a model (tractor) to attack a problem of genuine 
interest to the practicing accounting profession, creditors, and equity 
investors.. 

In the R1 top accounting schools, unlike medical schools, epidemiology-like 
studies (read that studies rooted in purchased macro databases) constitutes 
perhaps 80% of the research with another 19% focused on highly artificial 
behavioral experiments that fail to excite the world of practicing accountants. 
Bob Kaplan argues that most (say 99%) of the academic accounting research 
published in our leading accounting research journals is really not focused on 
the needs of the profession and is of little interest to practicing 
professionals. Although he does not say so, I would probably exclude some of the 
AIS research, XBRL research, and tax research from this broad generalization.

 The bottom line is that accounting research schools 
are not serving the research needs of the profession in the same manner that 
medical schools and other professional schools are serving the research needs of 
their professions. 

 
Hence accounting and finance&quot;scientists&quot;really did not have to&quot;labor&quot;very 
hard in laboratories in order to generate their data. The behavioral accountants 
had to generate data but they most often took easy routes such as using student 
surrogates for decision makers. Analytic accountants simply assumed whatever was 
necessary to construct complicated mathematical models built on quicksand.

The problem with

This is not to say that accountics researchers were lazy in all respects. They 
worked very, very hard at building their tractors to farm their data using 
purchased seed for data. But the problem was that when it came time for harvest, 
the accountics farmers&apos; contributions were mostly in developing innovative parts 
for their tractors. That was where their creative contributions were mostly 
centered. Their harvests were trivial and/or otherwise uninteresting because 
researchers just could not figure out how to study really interesting problems. For example, it would be really interesting to work hand-in-hand with the new 
healthcare law to build cost models and AIS software that excite the corporate 
world facing the uncertainties of health care costs under the new legislation.

In fact, nearly all their harvests turned out, and continue to turn out, in TAR, 
JAR, JAE, and CAR are so uninteresting that even accountics researchers do not 
usually find accountics research outcomes to be interesting enough to exactly replicate. Unlike their colleagues in the physical sciences, the social 
sciences, and even business management, accountics researchers replicate their 
findings so infrequently that calling accountics researchers&quot;scientists&quot;is 
really a sick joke. Accountics researchers assume that once one study is 
published it is truth that does not need to be challenged or is not important 
enough to challenge ---
 http://www.trinity.edu/ rjensen/TheoryTAR.htm  

An thus accountics researchers are selling research outcomes that almost nobody 
is interested in in terms of the outcomes. Other accountics researchers pour 
over the results and cite the research publications a great deal, but their 
interest is in the tractors and not the harvests.

The accounting profession has epsilon interests in the rather naive and 
simplistic findings in TAR, JAR, and JAE. Accountics researchers have great 
interest simply because they know that they must use the complicated tractors to 
pull themselves into job offers from top universities, promotions, tenure, and 
income. But it&apos;s the tractors that are doing the pulling rather than the 
harvests.

You, Steve, have been the most wonderful journal editor in terms of willingness 
to correspond privately with me. You&apos;ve made many efforts to show me where an 
accountics study was, at least in some sense, replicated. You&apos;ve tried to show 
me where real-world experimental subjects were used rather than students and 
where the findings should be of interest to the profession.

But your evidence is far from overwhelming Steve. I take credit, along with Paul 
Williams, Bob Kaplan, Steve Zeff, Sue Ravenscroft, Jagdish Gangolly, and various 
others, for directing your attention to the issue of lack of replication of 
accountics studies and lack of interest in the accountics harvests.

I should spend more time improving the above message before hitting the Send 
Button, but my Erika is nagging me to get the burlap and mulch winter blankets 
off her many roses. Uncovering roses is a bit like accountics research --- both 
are prickly tasks.

Welcome Back to the AECM Kotter
 
April 28, 2011 reply from
 Wow -- a pretty long post there, wouldn&apos;t you say Bob? Assuming that AECM
subscribers do not want to read a 1,153 line reply to your 1,153 line post,
I&apos;ll try to keep this succinct and just hit the big points.

1. &quot;Accountics&quot;

BOB&apos;S COMMENT: &gt;As I recall, you and most other members of the accounting academy 
 do not
&gt;really understand the origins of the term&quot;accountics&quot;as explained 
 in
&gt;An Analysis of the Evolution of Research Contributions by *The 
 Accounting
&gt;Review:* 1926-2005, bu Jean Heck and Bob Jensen, *Accounting 
 Historians
&gt;Journal*, Volume 34, No. 2, December 2007, pp. 109-142. Jean 
 generated the
&gt;data and I did the analysis.

  
  STEVE&apos;S RESPONSE:
As I acknowledeged about a year ago, I do understand that you did not
invent the term&quot;accountics,&quot;and that its origins were not intended to be
sarcastic or perjorative. I also understand the rich history that followed
the first use of that term, as aptly summarized in your article.
Nevertheless, I assert that your persistent use of the term&quot;accountics&quot;
apart from its historical context carries a sarcastic or perjorative
connotation in a contemporary context. You say that The Accounting Review
publishes accountics. I say that The Accounting Review publishes
accounting research. The difference is that I sense your preference
for&quot;accountics&quot;is to convey the notion that the research we publish is
overly narrow and quantitative. I do not share that view. 
  
 2. Bob&apos;s challenge 

BOB&apos;S COMMENT
&gt;*Challenge to You Steve *
 
 &gt;Now that the AECM has you back, I would like to offer you a 
 challenge as
the
  &gt;outgoing Senior Editor of *The Accounting Review*:
  I think it would be very interesting to have someone with your
&gt;outstanding reputation to examine all the articles published in TAR 
 over
the
&gt;past 20 years and identify those (with some documented evidence) 
 that had a
&gt;significant impact on the practice/profession of accountancy and 
 auditing.

  STEVE&apos;S RESPONSE:
That does indeed sound like an interesting project, though I have limited
time to pursue it. I seem to recall that some task force somewhere was
doing exactly this. Maybe someone out there knows the specifics? As for
me, most of my evidence is admittedly anecdotal, like the Hunton and Gold
study (TAR, May 2010) I referenced at last year&apos;s AAA meeting that changed
the way a major accounting firm implements fraud brainstorming.

More generally, however, I submit that we are too hard on ourselves
regarding the direct relevance of our research to change practice. Like
the substantial majority of accounting professors, I directly impact scores
of future practitioners each year. I call them&quot;students.&quot; In my auditing
classes this spring, I have directly incorporated the following research
studies, among others:
* Lennox and Pittman (TAR, 2010): Evidence that when the UK went to a
voluntary system for audits of privately held companies in 2004, companies
that continued to secure audits saw their credit ratings improve, whereas
companies that discontinued auditing saw their credit ratings worsen.
* Goodwin and Gul (TAR, 2009): Companies with more short-term debt,
ceteris paribus, actually are LESS risky to audit, as measured through
audit fees (helps me to explain the second-order effects of audit risk).
* Kachelmeier and Messier (TAR, 1990) and Messier, Kachelmeier, and Jensen
(AJPT 2001): Rather than using statistical decision aids in an input-
output manner, auditors back into statistical parameters to rationalize
smaller sample sizes.
* Bowlin (TAR, 2010): Auditors who back off&quot;low risk&quot;areas in terms of
unintentional errors entice companies to put the fraud in those areas, such
that those areas do not remain&quot;low risk&quot;for long (e.g., HealthSouth).
* I could name a few others, but I promised I would keep this brief. I
think you get the point. I impact practice by using research to help
future practitioners become better auditors. 

 3. Critical tests 
  
BOB&apos;S COMMENT:
 
 &gt;Keep in mind that your review will face critical tests by Bob 
 Jensen, Paul
&gt;Williams, Bob Kaplan, Steve Zeff, Sue Ravenscroft, Jagdish Gangolly, 
 Ken
&gt;Merchant, and various others.
&gt;
 
  STEVE&apos;S RESPONSE:
I get enough critical tests from two individuals known as Reviewer A and
Reviewer B, so thanks, but no thanks. 
 

 4. Bob baits Paul one more time: 
 
 
 BOB&apos;S COMMENT:
  
 &gt;Paul Williams believes deeply in the 
 self-serving Conspiracy Theory that
the
&gt;quants, many of them not even well-versed in accounting, literally 
 took
over
&gt;the R1 universities, the leading accounting research journals, the
doctoral
&gt;programs, the American Accounting Association, and to some extent 
 the AACSB
&gt;itself.

  STEVE&apos;S RESPONSE:
Some months back, Paul told me to&quot;never, ever, ever call it a 
 conspiracy
theory.&quot; And there you go and do so yourself. Paul, if you&apos;re reading
this, I didn&apos;t do it. 

 5. Maybe Bob ought to look at The Accounting Review more 
 often. 

BOB&apos;S COMMENT:
  &gt;Bob Kaplan really hit the nail on the head in his plenary address 
 in August
&gt;2010 in San Francisco. I was pleased to overhear you inviting 
 Professor
&gt;Kaplan to submit his remarks to The Accounting Review (while you 
 were still
&gt;the Senior Editor) ---
&gt; http://www.trinity.edu/ rjensen/TheoryTAR.htm# Appendix01 

  STEVE&apos;S RESPONSE:
Um, Bob -- we published that in the March 2011 issue. Where have you been?
 
 6. Bob&apos;s familar&quot;replications&quot;mantra: 
  
BOB&apos;S COMMENT:
 
 &gt;In fact, nearly all their harvests turned out, and continue to turn 
 out, in
&gt;TAR, JAR, JAE, and CAR are so uninteresting that even accountics
researchers
&gt;do not usually find accountics research outcomes to be interesting 
 enough
&gt;to exactly replicate. Unlike their colleagues in the physical 
 sciences,
the
&gt;social sciences, and even business management, accountics 
 researchers
&gt;replicate their findings so infrequently that calling accountics
researchers
&gt;&quot;scientists&quot;is really a sick joke.
  S TEVE&apos;S RESPONSE:
I don&apos;t think we&apos;ll ever converge our thoughts on this one Bob, but the key
term in your call for&quot;exactly replicating&quot;research is the
word&quot;exactly.&quot; To borrow an analogy I have used before (which in turn I
stole from Nobel laureate Vernon Smith), if you want to replicate my
assertion that it is currently 3:58 p.m., I submit that a poor replication
is to ask to see my watch and verify that my watch says it is 3:58 p.m. A
far better replication is for you to look at your own watch, which might
(presumably) say that it is currently 4:58 p.m. Then you would try to
reconcile the difference, which might lead to your discovery that we are in
different time zones. That&apos;s called an incremental contribution. Those
sorts of replications happen all the time, and we publish them regularly. 

 7. Bob&apos;s oversimplification: 
  
BOB&apos;S COMMENT:
 
  Accountics researchers assume that once
&gt;one study is published it is truth that does not need to be 
 challenged or
is
&gt;not important enough to challenge ---
&gt; http://www.trinity.edu/ rjensen/TheoryTAR.htm 
  STEVE&apos;S REPLY:
I disagree. We publish articles all the time that challenge prior
assertions. That&apos;s how science progresses. To say that accounting
research is without controversy or challenge within the literature is a
gross oversimplification, as any reasoned perusal of the contemporary
literature will reveal.

 8. Bob&apos;s olive branch to Paul: 
  
 BOB&apos;S COMMENT:
  
 &gt;But your evidence is far from overwhelming 
 Steve. I take credit, along with
&gt;Paul Williams, Bob Kaplan, Steve Zeff, Sue Ravenscroft, Jagdish 
 Gangolly,
&gt;and various others, for directing your attention to the issue of 
 lack of
&gt;replication of accountics studies and lack of interest in the 
 accountics
&gt;harvests.

  
  STEVE&apos;S REPLY:
I again return to the irony that, for all the political bickering between
you and Paul W. that apparently has led Paul to swear off future
participation in AECM, you find such common ground in criticizing
accounting research. As I said before (though with an embarrasing typo in
the word&quot;aisle&quot;), if we could get both aisles of Congress to find the same
common ground you have offered to Paul on your disdain for what you call
accountics, then maybe accounting research could really make a difference.
It might even help folks to find a way to balance the budget without
raising taxes or cutting needed programs. 
 
 9. Bob realizes that he has typed 1,153 lines: 
 
 
BOB&apos;S COMMENT:
 
 &gt;I should spend more time improving the above message before hitting 
 the
Send
&gt;Button, but my Erika is nagging me to get the burlap and mulch 
 winter
&gt;blankets off her many roses.

  And my editorial assistant and students are nagging me 
 to do my job. Gotta
go.
 
 10. Bob&apos;s peace offering: 
&gt; 
 Welcome Back Kotter 

 
 
 Steve&apos;s reply.

No promises on that Bob. These replies can get pretty time consuming, and
time is a precious commodity. Also, I did promise Paul W. last August that
I would butt out and let him have the last word, and I hate to rush back in
just because Paul has become disillusioned. Fair is fair. I&apos;ll continue
to read posts from time to time and will reply if I think I have something
to say, but I will not be dragged into a dysfunctional mud slinging contest
like last summer.

Best regards,

Steve 
 
Hi Steve,Kachelmeier,

Thank you for the very fast and informative reply.

I also thank you for accepting my challenge. I think the references that you 
listed in your reply are probably the only references published in TAR that are 
of possible interest to practitioners.

A study I that I would really like to see conducted would be to generate a 
random sample of AICPA members (I don&apos;t really care if portion of those sampled 
also teach accounting). Each member of the sample would then be cold called to answer the following questions:

 Can you recall any TAR, JAR, or JAE articles published over the past two 
 decades? Can you recall any TAR, JAR, or JAE article so published that impacted 
 the practice of accounting? Can you recall any prize-winning AAA Notable Contribution to the 
 Accounting Literature book or article? 

I would then like to compare the outcomes of the above study with an 
identical cold calling study of a random sample of AAA members.

My priors are that the cold calling outcomes in both studies would be similar 
to what happened when Katie Couric asked Vice Presidential Candidate Sarah Palin 
to identify the Supreme Court decisions that disappointed Candidate Palin ---
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rXmuhWrlj4 
You must watch the last half of the clip to see an example of what my proposed 
cold calls might sound like.

Let me say that I&apos;m well aware of when TAR published Professor Kaplan&apos;s 
plenary session remarks, because I instantly alerted the AECM to both the 
availability of Kaplan video in August 2010 and the TAR publication of those 
remarks in March 2011. I view this Kaplan commentary as significant for its 
content and for what I assume is a rare TAR Senior Editor invitation to publish 
a commentary that does not pass through the usual double blind refereeing 
process.

 Disconnect between what the TAR Senior Editor and Associate 
Editors define as&quot;accounting research&quot;versus the TAR Referees 
I think it is first of all important to note the apparent disconnect between 
what the TAR Senior Editor and Associate Editors (herein called&quot;editors&quot;) 
define as&quot;accounting research&quot;and what the team of 500+ TAR reviewers will in 
fact accept for publication in TAR. Our accounting doctoral programs over the 
past three decades may have produced a generation of cyborgs that rarely accept 
certain subsets of&quot;accounting research&quot;in TAR&apos;s double blind refereeing 
process.

Here&apos;s a quotation from then TAR Senior Editor Steve Kachelmeir replying to a 
message I wrote about the dearth of commentaries and discussions published in 
TAR ---  http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/TheoryTAR.htm 
 
 No, no, no! Once again, your characterization 
 makes me ( Steve Kachelmeir) out to be the 
 dictator who decides the standards of when a comment gets in and when it 
 doesnt. The last sentence is especially bothersome regarding what 
 Steve tells me is a requisite for his allowing TAR to publish a 
 comment. I never said that, so please dont put words in my mouth. 

 If I were to receive a comment of the 
 discussant variety, as you describe, I would send it out for review to 
 two reviewers in a manner 100% consistent with our stated policy on p. 
 388 of the January 2010 issue (have you read that policy?). If both 
 reviewers or even the one independent reviewer returned favorable 
 assessments, I would then strongly consider publishing it and would most 
 likely do so. My observation, however, which you keep wanting to 
 personalize as my policy, is that most peer reviewers, in my 
 experience, want to see a meaningful incremental contribution. (Sorry 
 for all the comma delimited clauses, but I need this to be precise.) 
 Bottom line: Please dont make it out to be the editors policy if it 
 is a broader phenomenon of what the peer community wants to see. And the 
 peer community, by the way, are regular professors from all varieties 
 of backgrounds. I name 574 of them in the November 2009 issue. 

 Steve Kachelmeier 
 
Hence it just so happens that many submissions that the TAR editors will be 
put out for review as accounting research do not pass the double blind 
refereeing process. My operating definition is that, except in rare instances, 
TARs referees will not accept any submission that is not an accountics 
submission. My operating definition of an accountics submission is one that 
contains mathematical equations and/or statistical inference tests . A few 
years back I had my graduate assistant pour through every article in TAR for the 
past two decades and classify each article that was not an accountics article. 
The listing of non-accountics articles was very short.

Here&apos;s what I concluded is the way TAR refereeing process has really worked 
for more than two decades:
 
 - TAR editors filter out submissions deemed not to be 
 accounting research or not being worthy of double blind refereeing
= Subset of submissions sent out for double blind refereeing

- Exact scientific replications of studies published in TAR--- replications 
 that are rarely even sent to TAR referees for double blind refereeing
- Accounting research field studies rarely accepted by TAR referees
- Accounting research surveys rarely accepted by TAR referees (even if they 
 contain statistical inference tests)
- Accounting research case method studies rarely accepted by TAR referees
- Accounting research commentaries/discussions rarely accepted by TAR 
 referees
- Accounting research history studies rarely accepted by TAR referees
- Submissions that do not contain mathematical equations and/or statistical 
 inference tests --- submissions rarely accepted by TAR referees
= Subset of accountics submissions that TAR referees deem eligible for 
 publication in TAR

- Accountics submissions deemed not worthy of publication in TAR by referees
+ AIS submissions that pass through a special set of AIS referees for TAR 
 (these are very infrequent submissions)
+ Certain tax and law submissions that pass through a special set of 
 specialist referees for TAR (these are very infrequent submissions)
+ Memorial articles about selected deceased accounting educators and 
 practitioners
+ Submissions invited by TAR editors that do not pass through the usual 
 double blind refereeing process
+ Conference proceedings published by TAR that do not pass through the usual 
 double blind refereeing process
= Set of articles published by TAR over the past two decades 
 
Not only can&apos;t I recall a single exacting scientific replication being 
published by TAR, I can&apos;t recall a single publication in TAR, JAR, JAE, or CAR 
that was ever deemed worthy as an exacting replication by independent accounting 
researchers. There have been assorted replications that have not been exacting 
in a scientific sense --- such as extensions of capital markets studies that 
tend to confirm or deny some earlier published studies, but since the 
replications were not exacting the original authors tend to deny criticisms of 
their original work. I can&apos;t recall a single exacting scientific published replication of a published behavioral accounting experiment.

 Can anybody recall a single TAR, JAR, or JAE author 
who admitted to errors discovered by other researchers in subsequent replication 
studies? 

As a cynic, I might suggest a gaming strategy where some errors are made 
intentionally in a study that got accepted by TAR, JAR, or JAE. Then the authors 
can get a second hit in TAR, JAR, or JAE by subsequently writing about their 
errors and oversights. Hey two hits are better than just one. But that does 
sound a bit too unethical even for accountics researchers.

The following is from the 2010 TAR Annual Report published by then Senior 
Editor Steve Kachelmeier:

Jensen Comment
Because of the high numbers publications of field studies, case studies, 
 survey studies, and other studies published in other accounting research 
 journals we know that such these types of accounting research studies are 
 prolific.

My contention is that over the past three decades that are very few 
 submissions of field studies, case studies, survey studies, and other 
 studies because authors of such studies now 
 consider submitting such&quot;accounting research&quot;studies to The Accounting 
 Review to be a waste of time and submission fee money . This 
 is entirely the point being made by Bob Kaplan and Zeff/Granoff ---
 http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/TheoryTAR.htm#Appendix01 

Hence when Steve Kachelmeier claims that TAR publishes&quot;accounting research&quot;then I think he needs to be more specific as to what types of&quot;accounting 
 research&quot;is rarely submitted and published in TAR. TAR most certainly is 
 not friendly to all types of accounting research.
 
 

Now let&apos;s compare Kachelmeier&apos;s above 2010 table with the following 
table written by TAR Senior Editor Gary Sundem&apos;s table of submitted manuscripts 
(1982-1986)::
 
 Leading accounting professors lamented TARs preference for rigor over 
 relevancy [Zeff, 1978; Lee, 1997; and Williams, 1985 and 2003]. Sundem 
 [1987] provides revealing information about the changed perceptions of 
 authors, almost entirely from academe, who submitted manuscripts for review 
 between June 1982 and May 1986. Among the 1,148 submissions, only 39 used 
 archival (history) methods; 34 of those submissions were rejected. Another 
 34 submissions used survey methods; 33 of those were rejected. And 100 
 submissions used traditional normative (deductive) methods with 85 of those 
 being rejected. Except for a small set of 28 manuscripts classified as using 
 other methods (mainly descriptive empirical according to Sundem), the 
 remaining larger subset of submitted manuscripts used methods that Sundem 
 [1987, p. 199] classified these as follows: 

 292        General Empirical 

 172         Behavioral 

 135        Analytical modeling 

 119         Capital Market 

  97         Economic modeling 

  40        Statistical modeling 

  29        Simulation 
 
The following is a quote from an earlier 1993 Presidents 
Message by Gary Sundem,
 
 Although empirical 
 scientific method has made many positive contributions to accounting 
 research, it is not the method that is likely to generate new theories, 
 though it will be useful in testing them. For example, Einsteins theories 
 were not developed empirically, but they relied on understanding the 
 empirical evidence and they were tested empirically. Both the development 
 and testing of theories should be recognized as acceptable accounting 
 research.

 ABSTRACT:
The persistent malaise in accounting research continues to resist remedy. 
 Hopwood (2007) argues that revitalizing academic accounting cannot be 
 accomplished by simply working more diligently within current paradigms. 
 Based on an analysis of articles published in Auditing: A Journal of 
 Practice&amp;Theory , I show that this paradigm block is not confined to 
 financial accounting research but extends beyond the work appearing in the 
 so-called premier U.S. journals. Based on this demonstration I argue that 
 accounting academics must tolerate (and even encourage) dissent for 
 accounting to enjoy a vital research academy. 2009 American Accounting 
 Association 

June 15, 2010 reply from Paul Williams [Paul_Williams@NCSU.EDU ]
 
 Bob,
Thank you advertising the availability of this paper in API, the on line 
 journal of the AAA Public Interest Section (which I just stepped down 
 from editing after my 3+ years stint). Joni is one of the most 
 (incisively) thoughtful people in our discipline (her paper in AOS,&quot;Making Up Users&quot;is a must read). The absence of dissent is evident 
 from even casual perusal of the so-called premier journals. Every paper 
 is erected on the same premises -- assumptions about human decision 
 making (i.e., rational decision theory),&quot;free markets,&quot;economic 
 naturalism, etc. There is a metronomic repetition of the same 
 meta-narrative about the&quot;way the world is&quot;buttressed by exercises in 
 statistical causal analysis (the method of agricultural research, but 
 without any of the controls). There is a growing body of evidence that 
 these premises are myths -- the so-called rigorous research valorized in 
 the&quot;top&quot;journals is built on an ideological foundation of sand.

this document stimulates academic accounting research that is more focused on 
the needs of the business world and the profession (which was the main theme of 
Bob Kaplans outstanding plenary session on August 4 in San Francisco).

 In Conclusion 
STEVE&apos;S RESPONSE:
 As I acknowledged about a year ago, I do understand that 
you did not
invent the term&quot;accountics,&quot;and that its origins were not intended to be
sarcastic or pejorative. I also understand the rich history that followed
the first use of that term, as aptly summarized in your article.
Nevertheless, I assert that your persistent use of the term&quot;accountics&quot;
apart from its historical context carries a sarcastic or pejorative
connotation in a contemporary context. You say that The Accounting Review
publishes accountics. I say that The Accounting Review publishes
accounting research. The difference is that I sense your preference
for&quot;accountics&quot;is to convey the notion that the research we publish is
overly narrow and quantitative. I do not share that view. 

Jensen Reply
I will gladly stop using the term&quot;accountics&quot;when you provide me with a better 
term for that subset of&quot;accounting research&quot;that TAR mostly publishes. TAR 
most certainly does not encourage authors to submit manuscripts covering some 
subsets of accounting research methodology.

 As another challenge for some subscriber to the AECM I would 
like to see a listing of all articles in TAR over the last 20 years that do not 
contain a single equation or a single statistical inference test. Perhaps then 
we can help Steve come up with a better term than&quot;accountics&quot;to describe the 
subset of accounting research that TAR referees find acceptable to a significant 
degree. 

I do thank you Steve for being the most communicative TAR Senior Editor in 
recent history.

And I thank you for being my friend.

April 29 reply from Steve Kachelmeier
 Hi Bob --

I could try to refute your third round of points, mainly by questioning
whether what an association journal publishes should be driven by editorial
fiat vis-a-vis a fair evaluation of the submissions we receive by peer
reviewers in the areas of those submissions. I think you know my views on
this. But more importantly, in the very eloquent words of Jagdish Gangolly
(from his post on this thread yesterday),&quot;I think on any public forum it
  is important at some stage 
 for the debaters to agree to disagree. Once that
point has been reached it is perhaps best to move on.&quot;

  I agree to disagree and move 
 on.

Take care,

Steve 
April 30, 2011 reply from Bob Jensen (on my birthday)

Thanks Steve Steve Kachelmeier,

I know you are very busy winding down your senior editorship of TAR and your 
courses for this semester. Thank you for taking the time and trouble to 
counterpoint my points.


Readers interested in Steve&apos;s earlier replies to my questions can go to:
Appendix 5: &quot;Steve Supports My Idea and Then Douses it in Cold Water&quot;
 http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/TheoryTAR.htm#ColdWater  


One of the most noteworthy rebuttals to Steve&apos;s positions can be found in:
&quot;Accounting Scholarship that Advances Professional Knowledge and Practice,&quot;by 
Robert S. Kaplan, The Accounting Review , March 2011, pp. 367-383
I recommended this article to the AECM at the time it was published and gave a 
glowing account of the Kaplan Video that was made available at the AAA Commons 
in August 2010.


Someday I would really like to see Steve present counterpoints to the Kaplan 
article. Other accountics professors in the world seem to have ignored it.


The one point that I raise for which Steve has no answer is that to get an 
article published in The Accounting Review in the past two decades that is not 
an accountics 
paper is harder than passing a camel through the eye of a needle. An
accountics paper 
is one that contains mathematical equations and/or statistical inference tests.


Just to confirm my position for the nine recent editions of TAR, I scanned all 
the articles from January 2010 to May 2011. All articles are
accountics 
articles. No article without equations and/or statistical inference tests has 
passed through the double blind refereeing of TAR in 2010 and to date in 2011 
except for Kaplan&apos;s 
article cited above for March 2011. But this hardly counts since it was an AAA 
Annual Meeting Presidential Address and did not have to pass throughTAR&apos;s double 
blind reviewing process. If it had done so, I suspect that it too would have 
been rejected by the TAR referees.


It will be interesting if TAR will remain an
accountics-only 
journal under the forthcoming editorship of Harry Evans.


In its Editorial Policy, The Accounting Review does invite commentaries 
that will be subjected to double blind refereeing. I would have to dig much 
deeper into TAR&apos;s 
history to find a commentary that passed
TAR&apos;s double 
blind refereeing filter.


My recommendations for making TAR more scientific are discussed at
 http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/TheoryTAR.htm  
Therein I propose some ways to encourage replication of TAR articles that are 
now virtually accepted as TRUTH without being subjected to replication or 
commentary.


Steve argues that this is not the case, but he has no counterpoint for over 98% 
of the articles published in TAR over the past two decades. Those articles were 
accepted by the accounting academy as TRUTH or they were were simply ignored as 
not being worthy of replication.


Have a good rest this summer Steve. You&apos;ve earned a rest, and I do fully 
recognize that being Senior Editor of TAR requires long hours of volunteer 
labor, heavy stress when dealing with contentious authors and referees, and for 
several past editors has been truly hazardous to health. I&apos;m very glad your 
survived your years of service to TAR and to the accounting academy.


And after your rest, I hope you will carefully read or re-read the articles 
cited at
 http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/TheoryTAR.htm  


Respectfully,
Bob Jensen

April 30, 2011 Challenge to Bob Jensen from Steve Kachelmeir
 
 MY CHALLENGE TO BOB:
I will try to keep this brief, but I cannot simply ignore what you
characterize as a&quot;noteworthy rebuttal,&quot;although my reading of Kaplan
(2011) doesn&apos;t leave me with that impression at all. Rather than
defensively indulge your continual bashing of what we publish under your
hand-waiving generalization of&quot;accountics,&quot;here is a challenge I have
for you. Please cite the five most prominent specific examples
of&quot;accounting scholarship that advances professional knowledge and
practice&quot;that you think TAR should have published over the last ten years
but did not (or would not) publish because TAR is so narrow and insistent
on equations.

The ground rules are simple. First, I ask that you not cite commentaries
about accounting research. Rather, I want to see actual articles that
advance professional accounting knowledge and practice, as advocated by
Bob Kaplan and interpreted by you. Second, the cites should be actual
articles published in other (presumably more open minded) academic
journals within the last ten years -- please don&apos;t cite relics from
several decades ago. I presume that these contemporary articles exist,
because you often assert that those who write them are simply intimidated
against submitting to TAR, so they presumably go elsewhere with their
insights. For each of your five examples, it would be helpful to have a
sentence indicating the article&apos;s meaningful impact on the profession in
terms of advancing professional knowledge and practice. Ideally,
practicing CPAs would have heard of your examples and would have been
influenced by them in their practice of accounting. It would also be
helfpul to have a sentence explaining your reasoning as to why TAR would
not have considered the article, were it to be submitted to TAR.

Again, keep it to contributions published in 2001 and later -- that gives
you ten full years. So Bob Kaplan&apos;s proposals of the balanced scorecard
and activity-based costing do not qualify, and in any event, TAR has
published several articles on both of those topics over the last decade
and earlier.

Feel a little like Sarah Palin, Bob? Maybe not -- I&apos;m looking forward to
your reply.

Steve 
 
April 30, 2011 reply from Bob Jensen
Hi Steve,
Since I&apos;m preparing to make three trips to Boston starting tomorrow, I will have 
to do this quickly without really preparing (a Sarah Palin) in that sense since 
I&apos;m not going to take time to carefully prepare.

I will simply list five from the set of my all time favorites that I think TAR 
referees would&apos;ve rejected. Some of my all time favorites were accountics papers 
that I think TAR referees would&apos;ve published had the paper been submitted to 
TAR. For example, Eric Lie&apos;s AAA Award winning paper was published in Management 
Science, but I think that it would&apos;ve sailed through the double blind TAR review 
process. I will not list my favorites like this.


 Number One 
My all time favorite is Bob Kaplan&apos;s paper which TAR did publish, but no thanks 
to the TAR referees. I think those accountics TAR referees would&apos;ve rejected 
this paper like they did reject the award winning (we even got a monetary prize) 
paper by Heck and Jensen eventually published by the Accounting Historians 
Journal ). 

  &quot;Accounting Scholarship that Advances 
 Professional Knowledge and Practice,&quot;by Robert S.
 Kaplan, The Accounting Review , March 2011, pp. 367-383
 I recommended this article to the AECM at the time it was published and 
 gave a glowing account of the Kaplan Video that was made available at the 
 AAA Commons in August 2010.
 
This paper is important because it stresses the how top accounting research 
 journals have virtually ignored the needs of the accounting profession while 
 playing in Plato&apos;s cave. I think this is the best accounting research paper 
 published in the past three decades even though I do not agree with some of 
 the garbage remarks of Kaplan about fair value models. 

 Number Two 
Virtually all research publications of Abe Brilloff, most of which were published 
by Barons . These were great non-accountics detections of accounting and 
auditing flubs. There was not a ghost in hell chance that TAR referees would&apos;ve 
published these highly creative non-accoutics research articles:

  
 E. RICHARD CRISCIONE , 
 Abraham J. (Abe) Brillofff: A Biography , 
 Studies in the Development of Accounting Thought, Volume 11 ( Bingley, 
 U.K.: JAI/Emerald Group, 2009, ISBN: 978-1-84855-588-4, pp. xxi, 258.

 Number 3 
One of my all time favorites is a case study published in Issues in 
Accounting Education . Since it was a case study it had a miniscule (epsilon) 
chance of being accepted by TAR&apos;s accountics referees.


I also liked this paper because it showed the idiocy and inconsistencies of 
mathematical model valuations of the firm vis--vis more subjective valuations 
by valuation experts. Valuation experts usually roll their eyes when somebody 
mentions&quot;academic&quot;valuation models like rooted only in the past financial 
statements, such as Residual Income Models, Free Cash Flow Models, and Modified 
IRR models: 
 &quot;Questrom vs. Federated Department 
 Stores, Inc.: A Question of Equity Value,&quot;May 2001 edition of Issues in 
 Accounting Educati on, by University of Alabama faculty members Gary 
 Taylor, William Sampson, and Benton Gup, pp. 223-256. 

 In spite of all the sophistication 
 in models, it is ever so common for intangibles and forecasting problems to 
 sink the valuation models we teach. I have more to say about intangibles at http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen//theory/00overview/theory01.htm#TheoryDisputes   

 A question I always ask my students 
 is: What is the major thing that has to be factored in when valuing 
 Microsoft Corporation? 

 The answer I&apos;m looking for is 
 certainly not product innovation or something similar to that. The answer 
 is also not customer loyalty, although that probably is a huge factor. The 
 big factor is the massive cost of retraining the entire working world in 
 something that replaces MS Office products (Excel, Word, PowerPoint, 
 Outlook, etc.). It simply costs too much to retrain workers in MS Office 
 substitutes even if we are so sick of security problems in Microsoft&apos;s 
 systems.  How do you factor this&quot;customer lock-in&quot;into a Residual Income 
 or FCF Model? Our models are torpedoed by intangibles in the real world. 
 
 

 Number 4 
Nearly all the TAR articles on employee option valuations are rooted in the 
Black-Scholes Model, but the BS model for employee stock options is truly BS 
since it overvalues employee fears that options will tank before they will be 
exercised. I know you have a cynical attitude toward normative&quot;accounting 
research&quot;published in the Journal of Accountancy , but the practical lattice model proposed in the following JA paper beats all the previous TAR 
publications on options valuation all to hell as far as valuation of employee 
stock options is concerned.

I personally think this JA publication would&apos;ve been flat out rejected by TAR 
referees.

 W. Briggs, Journal of Accountancy , December 2005 --- http://www.aicpa.org/pubs/jofa/dec2005/baril.htm 
 This is one of the best articles for accounting 
 educators on issues of option valuation! 

 Research shows 
 that employees value options at a small fraction of their Black-Scholes 
 value, because of the possibility that they will vest underwater. --- http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3014835

 Up Stock Options,&quot;by Frederick Rose, Stanford Business , November 
 2004, pp. 21 --- http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/bmag/sbsm0411/feature_stockoptions.shtml   

 
 
 Number 5
 My Number 5 choice is really a book, but I think that each and every 
chapter of the book would be rejected by TAR referees if they were submitted to 
TAR as articles. I first learned of this book from Miguel at my beloved Simoleon 
Sense blog:
 
 Purportedly a Great, Great Book on Value Investing
 From Simoleon Sense , November 16, 2009 --- http://www.simoleonsense.com/ 
 
 OMG Did I Die&amp;Go To heaven?
Just Read, Applied Value Investing , My Favorite Book of the Past 
 5 Years!!
Listen To This Interview! 

 I have a confession, I might have read the best 
 value investing book published in the past 5 years! 

 The book is called Applied Value Investing By Joseph Calandro Jr. In the book Mr. Calandro applies the tenets of value investing via 
 (real) case studies. Buffett, was once asked how he would teach a class 
 on security analysis, he replied, case studies. Unlike other books 
 which are theoretical this book provides you with the actual steps for 
 valuing businesses. 

 Without a doubt, this book ranks amongst the 
 best value investing books (with SA, Margin of Safety, Buffetts letters 
 to corporate America, and Greenwalds book)&amp;you dont have to take my 
 word for it. Seth Klarman, Mario Gabelli and many top investors have 
 given the book a plug! 

 Here is an interview with the author of the book, Applied Value 
 Investing ( I recommend listening to this). Who knows perhaps yours truly will interview him 
 soon. 

 Miguel 

 P.S. 

 A fellow blogger and friend will soon post a 
 review of this book ( hint: Street Capitalist !). 
 
 Conclusion 
I timed myself Steve. From the time I read your challenge (I&apos;ve been outside 
cleaning out my pond) to me to the time I hit the Send button on this 
message it took six minutes (about as close to a Sarah Palin cold call as I 
could get). There are of course many other references that I can think of that 
are equally suited for the challenge. But since you wanted only five and a speed 
reply, I submit the above five to meet your challenge.

By the way I thought of these references in less than a minute. The other 
five minutes was spent trying to look up the exact citations.

Thanks for the interesting challenge.

Now the ball is in your court to find five TAR articles that would be more of 
relevance to practitioners.

Respectfully,
Bob Jensen

 

Hi Steve,

Perhaps in my haste I misunderstood part of the challenge. I thought it was to 
be to find examples of my favorite publications that I&apos;m 99% certain that TAR 
referees would&apos;ve rejected.
 

 Number One 
 
Kaplan&apos;s paper published in 16 pages is more than a commentary and, at 
 least in part, is a research paper on fair value measurement and another 
 section on risk measurement. Because these sections do not have equations 
 you probably do not consider them research.

Kaplan&apos;s paper also has a section entitled&quot;Accounting Research 
 1968-2010,&quot;but because that&apos;s accounting history you probably don&apos;t 
 consider it research because it is historical research. Sadly this section 
 does not have equations. Sigh!

In total, I consider Kaplan&apos;s paper to be more of an accounting 
 history research paper than a commentary . Commentaries generally have a 
 more narrow focus and are often a critical review of a particular 
 publication or person.

 
 
 Number Two 
 
All right since you exclude the works to Abe Brillofff to be before 2001 to 
 be eligible, let me choose one great piece of work after the Year 2000.

How about
 Brillofff, A. J. 2002. 
 Beyond the Brilovian critique: A Brilovian rejoinder. Accounting and the 
 Public Interest (2): 94-96. 

I&apos;m not certain that the above particular article has a traceable impact 
 to practice, but the similar works of Brillofff over the years have had more 
 impact on practice than TAR. For example, I doubt that a change in corporate 
 share prices on the NYSE can be traced to the release of a single TAR paper. If so, I&apos;d like to hear about it.

 
 
 Number Three 
 
Even if this was a case published in IAE, is accounting education 
 research excluded from publication in TAR just because it is in the area of 
 education? 

Actually this case is written more like a research case.

I stick buy my contention that this is a research article that would not 
 stand a chance of being published in TAR because it was a case. Yipes, it 
 even has equations. But if the equations are in a case the TAR referees 
 would probably reject the submission.

 
 
 Number Four 
 
Immediately after I hit the first Send button I sent out a second version 
 with the citation.

I personally think this JA publication would&apos;ve been flat out rejected by 
 TAR referees.
 
&quot;How to Excel at Options Valuation , &quot;by 
 Charles P. Baril, Luis Betancourt, and John W. Briggs, Journal of 
 Accountancy , December 2005 --- http://www.aicpa.org/pubs/jofa/dec2005/baril.htm 
 This is one of the best articles for accounting 
 educators on issues of option valuation! 

Research shows that employees value options at a 
 small fraction of their Black-Scholes value, because of the possibility 
 that they will vest underwater. --- http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3014835 
 
 
 
 Number Five 
 
I did not realize that you would be so picky about whether the research 
 was published in a chapter of a book versus an article other than a TAR 
 article.

John Read --- http://www.johntreed.com/Aboutauthor.html 

I still stick by the case book I placed in Number 5. This is great 
 research and is highly regarded by finance professors as well as investors 
 and analysts.

 
 
 Number Five Alternate 
 
If you insist on having an alternate for Number Five, I choose the Heck 
 and Jensen paper below:
An Analysis of the Evolution of Research Contributions by The Accounting 
 Review: 1926-2005, (with Jean Heck), Accounting Historians Journal , 
 Volume 34, No. 2, December 2007, pp. 109-142.

This is an accounting history research paper that was flatly rejected by 
 TAR, But it won a monetary prize from the Accounting Historians Journal so 
 that must count for something.

And I have had enough feedback from practicing accountants (many of whom 
 are on the CPAs-L listserv) to know that it has had a fair amount of 
 practitioner readership around the world.

 
 
End Note
If I don&apos;t reply to your messages quickly, it&apos;s because my wife will be having 
her 14th heavy duty spine surgery on May 12 (to replace some rods, hooks, bone 
fusions, cables, and screw)s. Tomorrow we leave on our first of three trips to 
Boston, and my attention will be diverted from the AECM of a few weeks.

This will no doubt be a relief to many AECM subscribers now busy with grading 
final exams and term projects.

Respectfully,

Bob Jensen

 A few thoughts on this interesting exchange: 

 Topic #1: Replications in accounting research 

 Although I think Bob is right -- there are very few 
 published replications in accounting research -- here is a very interesting 
 and well-done one, which I very much enjoyed reading:

 Topic #2: 

 Here are three excellent Accounting Review papers, 
 all of which are relevant to both accounting practice and are strong 
 scholarship:

 including Steve K), authors, and reviewers for creating this set of 
 excellent work. Now let&apos;s do what we can to see much more work, with 
 relevance to both practice and theory, published in (if possible) or out (if 
 needed) of accounting journals.

Another Dan Stone Reply (regarding finding research articles relevant to 
practitioners)
 
 Gosh this isn&apos;t much of a challenge. Have a look at 
 AOS over the past 10 years for high-quality research that deeply engages 
 with the professional practice of accounting.

 Dan, 

 So your reply to the challenge to identify specific 
 research examples that have directly impacted the practice of accounting is&quot;anything in AOS&quot;? I have nothing against AOS and won&apos;t try to dispute your 
 claim that AOS articles are broadly relevant to practice, but if one wants 
 to generalize to that degree, I certainly could say the same for The 
 Accounting Review and many other journals. For a more detailed analysis that 
 doesn&apos;t just laud&quot;see anything in&lt;name of my favored journal&gt;,&quot;I 
 recommend reading Moehrle et al.,&quot;The Impact of Academic Accounting 
 Research on Professional Practice: An Analysis by the AAA Research Support 
 Task Force,&quot;Accounting Horizons, December 2009, pp. 411-456. Those authors 
 did an outstanding job identifying a 15-page reference list of practice- 
 relevant academic research studies, with several recent specific examples 
 that have impacted the practice and regulation of accounting from The 
 Accounting Review and other&quot;accountics&quot;journals. If one adds to that the 
 studies that can indirectly impact future practice through our teaching (as 
 Bob J. did with one of his examples), the list is quite impressive indeed. 

 Dan, let me say in closing that I do appreciate 
 your earlier post that cited three recent TAR articles you found relevant. I 
 especially agree with you that Hunton and Gold (TAR, May 2010 issue) is 
 about as practically relevant as one can get. The results of that study 
 changed the way a major public accounting firm implements fraud 
 brainstorming. 

 Best,

 Although nearly all management and accounting 
 journals are accessible by
issue through various data base providers (JSTOR, Proquest, etc.), I provide
an alphabetical listing of articles and place them into topic bibliographies
as well. The idea is to provide a more convenient way to search for articles
by author, by journal, and by topic than searching one issue at a time.
MAAW&apos;s TAR bibliography stops at the five year wall for JSTOR links
(1926-2005), but the AOS bibliography is fairly current 1976-2010.
Links to the these and other Journal Bibliographies are on the following

 An Analysis of the Contributions of The Accounting Review Across 80 
Years: 1926-2005 --- 
 http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/395wpTAR/Web/TAR395wp.htm 
 I have two accountics questions that I don&apos;t have time to answer due to 
Erika&apos;s pending heavy duty spine surgery this month. I also don&apos;t want to 
challenge Steve with these questions since he has good reason for a summer break 
when coming off the stressful senior editorship of The Accounting Review (TAR).


Besides, I doubt whether Steve wants the answer to Question 1 made public.


 My Question 1 
 Among all the accepted submissions that were 
most likely double blind refereed in TAR between May 31, 1991 and May 31, 2011, 
what proportion were not accountics articles? 


I define an accountics article as one that contains mathematical equations 
and/or statistical inference tests.


Please exclude articles published in TAR that are suspected of not passing 
through double blind reviews.
These include the following:

  1. AAA Plenary Session papers such as those TAR publications of Kaplan, 
 Hopwood, and Palmrose.
2. Memorial articles
3  Articles by TAR Editors or authors acting in official capacities such as 
 AAA staff and committee chairs.
  
 
 My Question 2 
 Can anybody recall a single TAR, JAR, or JAE author 
who admitted to errors discovered by other researchers in subsequent replication 
studies?
Or put another way, is there a TAR, JAR, or JAE author who no longer considers 
the findings as truth subject to cautions admitted in the article? 




 Jensen Comment on Briloff and Bias Against Publishing Anecdotal 
Evidence 

Anecdotal Evidence --- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anecdotal_evidence  

I think a bias toward accountics articles came about after the 1950s as a 
reaction against anecdotal evidence in the new age of scientific research in 
accounting, finance, and business. An individual piece of anecdotal evidence, 
such as any one of Abe Briloff&apos;s Barron&apos;s cases, is terrible evidence for 
many broader questions. One of the main problems is that anecdotal evidence can 
be cherry picked to&quot;prove&quot;a broader point..

 

Accordingly, I think that after 35 years of publishing normative research, 
case method (anecdotal), and historical (often anecdotal) research, The 
Accounting Review (TAR) editors and referees over reacted in avoidance of 
normative, case, and history studies in favor of accountics research. One might 
argue that many analytical TAR studies using mathematics were glorified 
normative or anecdotal fictions, but I will avoid this issue at the moment. It 
might be best for the moment to to think of accountics research as empirical 
research subjected to statistical inference testing.

 

For example, suppose we had a working hypothesis that Big Eight accounting 
firms are letting a serious number of audit clients get away with GAAP 
violations because the firms are favoring client relations over investors. Such 
a hypothesis, in my viewpoint, is not amenable to scientific research. It is 
amenable to anecdotal research, but anecdotal research pointing to poor quality 
Big Eight audits, where errors may have arisen due to non-independence, can be 
cherry picked.

 

Exhibit A in my first comment is the entire set of Barron&apos;s articles 
published by Abe Briloff, mostly in the 1970s. Professor Briloff and his student 
assistants poured over thousands of financial statements in search of accounting 
and auditing flubs of Big Eight accounting firms. He and his team found many 
real doozies. As George Foster pointed out in a JAR article, Briloff&apos;s 
reputation became so huge that Briloff&apos;s Barron&apos;s articles were impacting 
NYSE stock prices.

 

In turn the Big Eight firms allegedly declared war on Professor Briloff by 
lobbying the AICPA to dirty his reputation ---
 http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/Theory01.htm#Briloff 

 

Any single one of Abe&apos;s articles is virtually an anecdotal case study and was 
cherry picked in the sense that Abe did not write about the many, many times he 
could find nothing wrong with financial statements audited by Big Eight firms. 
But one-by-one his anecdotal negative evidence began to pile up that Big Eight 
firms were seriously allowing bad things in audits getting clean opinions by the 
Big Eight.

 

The bottom line is that Abe Briloff was perhaps the first researcher to knock 
the sickeningly arrogant Big Eight audit firms off their high horses regarding 
quality of and independence of Big Eight audits. For this he almost got his CPA 
license revoked.

My point is that there are just some things that are not amenable to 
scientific/accountics research. It is then where accumulated anecdotal evidence 
from a succession of case studies begins to take on more importance.

 

Anecdotal evidence is very important for discovering possible hypotheses to 
be studied scientifically.

The following is a quote from an earlier 1993 Presidents 
Message by Gary Sundem,
 
 Although empirical 
 scientific method has made many positive contributions to accounting 
 research, it is not the method that is likely to generate new theories, 
 though it will be useful in testing them. For example, Einsteins theories 
 were not developed empirically, but they relied on understanding the 
 empirical evidence and they were tested empirically. Both the development 
 and testing of theories should be recognized as acceptable accounting 
 research.
 &quot;Presidents Message,&quot; Accounting Education News 21 (3). Page 3. 

 
 
 My main main 
point in this first comment is that there is great value from anecdotal case 
studies and history studies that now get rejected by TAR referees because these 
referees no longer value the importance of case studies and history research to 
scientific research. 

 

 Jensen Comment on Valuation in the Real World 

As a second example of where TAR referees now go wrong is in the area of 
valuation, particularly equity valuation and real estate valuation. TAR referees 
have repeatedly glorified authors of theoretical valuation models such as 
Residual Income models, Free Cash Flow models, and modified IRR valuation 
models. But professionals who actually do valuations in the real world tend to 
either laugh at such models or use them only in a very small way to the 
valuation process in practice.

 

One problem with valuation research in the real world is that it is typically 
anecdotal research. Each company&apos;s equity or each building is so unique and so 
confounded with intangibles, that it&apos;s very difficult to scientific research on 
valuation vis-a-vis analytical research such as case method research.

 

But TAR referees now have such a bias against publishing case studies that 
TAR just does not publish articles on how valuation takes place in the real 
world.

 

This is why I consider the following quotation from Simoleon Sense so 
important:

 
 
 Purportedly a Great, Great Book on Value Investing
 From Simoleon Sense , November 16, 2009 --- http://www.simoleonsense.com/ 
 
 OMG Did I Die&amp;Go To heaven?
Just Read, Applied Value Investing , My Favorite Book of the Past 
 5 Years!!
Listen To This Interview! 

 I have a confession, I might have read the best 
 value investing book published in the past 5 years! 

 The book is called Applied Value Investing By Joseph Calandro Jr. In the book Mr. Calandro applies the tenets of value investing via 
 (real) case studies. Buffett, was once asked how he would teach a class 
 on security analysis, he replied, case studies.  Unlike other books 
 which are theoretical this book provides you with the actual steps for 
 valuing businesses . 

 Without a doubt, this book ranks amongst the 
 best value investing books (with SA, Margin of Safety, Buffetts letters 
 to corporate America, and Greenwalds book)&amp;you don&apos;t have to take my 
 word for it. Seth Klarman, Mario Gabelli and many top investors have 
 given the book a plug! 

 Here is an interview with the author of the book, Applied Value 
 Investing ( I recommend listening to this). Who knows perhaps yours truly will interview him 
 soon. 

 Miguel 

 P.S. 

 A fellow blogger and friend will soon post a 
 review of this book ( hint: Street Capitalist !) 

 
 
Hell would probably freeze over before TAR referees would accept any of the 
anecdotal cases written by Joseph Calandro if Calandro were to submit any one of 
these cases to TAR or an article on the history of real world valuation 
processes.

 

I think it&apos;s time for TAR referees to reconsider their biases against 
anecdotal evidence.

 

 Jensen Comment on Validation and Replication 

 It&apos;s also time that TAR referees consider the lack of validation of the 
many accountics (scientific) articles that are never validated ---
 http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/TheoryTAR.htm 

 

 Can anybody recall a single TAR, JAR, or JAE author 
who admitted to errors discovered by other researchers in subsequent replication 
studies?
Or put another way, is there a TAR, JAR, or JAE author who no longer considers 
the findings as truth subject to cautions admitted in the article?

I have no idea who put this together, but it is good!!

Long ago and far away, in a land that time forgot, Before the days of Dylan , 
or the dawn of Camelot. There lived a race of innocents, and they were you and 
me,

For Ike was in the White House in that land where we were born, Where navels 
were for oranges, and Peyton Place was porn.

We learned to gut a muffler, we washed our hair at dawn, We spread our 
crinolines to dry in circles on the lawn..

We longed for love and romance, and waited for our Prince, And Eddie Fisher 
married Liz , and no one&apos;s seen him since.

We danced to &apos;Little Darlin,&apos; and sang to &apos;Stagger Lee&apos; And cried for Buddy 
Holly in the Land That Made Me, Me.

Only girls wore earrings then, and 3 was one too many, And only boys wore 
flat-top cuts, except for Jean McKinney.

And only in our wildest dreams did we expect to see A boy named George with 
Lipstick, in the Land That Made Me, Me.

We fell for Frankie Avalon , Annette was oh, so nice, And when they made a 
movie, they never made it twice..

We didn&apos;t have a Star Trek Five, or Psycho Two and Three, Or Rocky-Rambo 
Twenty in the Land That Made Me, Me.

Miss Kitty had a heart of gold, and Chester had a limp, And Reagan was a 
Democrat whose co-star was a chimp.

We had a Mr. Wizard, but not a Mr. T, And Oprah couldn&apos;t talk yet, in the 
Land That Made Me, Me. We had our share of heroes, we never thought they&apos;d go, 
At least not Bobby Darin, or Marilyn Monroe.

For youth was still eternal, and life was yet to be, And Elvis ;was forever 
in the Land That Made Me, Me.

We&apos;d never seen the rock band that was Grateful to be Dead, And Airplanes 
weren&apos;t named Jefferson , and Zeppelins were not Led.

And Beatles lived in gardens then, and Monkees lived in trees, Madonna was 
Mary in the Land That Made Me, Me.

We&apos;d never heard of microwaves, or telephones in cars, And babies might be 
bottle-fed, but they were not grown in jars.

And pumping iron got wrinkles out, and &apos;gay&apos; meant fancy-free, And dorms were 
never co-ed in the Land That Made Me, Me.

We hadn&apos;t seen enough of jets to talk about the lag, And microchips were what 
was left at the bottom of the bag.

And hardware was a box of nails, and bytes came from a flea, And rocket ships 
were fiction in the Land That Made Me, Me.

Buicks came with portholes, and side shows came with freaks, And bathing 
suits came big enough to cover both your cheeks.

And Coke came just in bottles, and skirts below the knee, And Castro came to 
power near the Land That Made Me, Me.

We had no Crest with Fluoride, we had no Hill Street Blues, We had no 
patterned pantyhose or Lipton herbal tea Or prime-time ads for those 
dysfunctions in the Land That Made Me, Me.

There were no golden arches, no Perrier to chill, And fish were not called 
Wanda , and cats were not called Bill.

And middle-aged was 35 and old was forty-three, And ancient were our parents 
in the Land That Made Me, Me.

But all things have a season, or so we&apos;ve heard them say, And now instead of 
Maybelline we swear by Retin-A. They send us invitations to join AARP, We&apos;ve 
come a long way, baby, from the Land That Made Me, Me.

So now we face a brave new world in slightly larger jeans, And wonder why 
they&apos;re using smaller print in magazines. And we tell our children&apos;s children of 
the way it used to be, Long ago and far away in the Land That Made Me, Me.

The tailgating woman was furious and honked her horn, screaming in 
frustration, as she missed her chance to get through the intersection, dropping 
her cell phone and makeup.

As she was still in mid-rant, she heard a tap on her window and looked up 
into the face of a very serious police officer. The officer ordered her to exit 
her car with her hands up.

He took her to the police station where she was searched, fingerprinted, 
photographed, and placed in a holding cell.

After a couple of hours, a policeman approached the cell and opened the door. 
She was escorted back to the booking desk where the arresting officer was 
waiting with her personal effects.

He said, &apos;&apos;I&apos;m very sorry for this mistake. You see, I pulled up behind your 
car while you were blowing your horn, flipping off the guy in front of you and 
cussing a blue streak at him. I noticed the &apos;What Would Jesus Do&apos; bumper

 Concerns That Academic Accounting Research is Out of Touch With Reality 
 
 
 I think leading academic researchers avoid applied research for the 
 profession because making seminal and creative discoveries that 
 practitioners have not already discovered is enormously difficult. Accounting academe is threatened by the 
 twin dangers of fossilization and scholasticism (of three types: 
 tedium, high tech, and radical chic) 
From http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/395wpTAR/Web/TAR395wp.htm   

 Knowledge and competence increasingly developed out of the internal 
 dynamics of esoteric disciplines rather than within the context of 
 shared perceptions of public needs, writes Bender. This is not to 
 say that professionalized disciplines or the modern service 
 professions that imitated them became socially irresponsible. But 
 their contributions to society began to flow from their own 
 self-definitions rather than from a reciprocal engagement with 
 general public discourse. 

   

 Now, there is a definite note of sadness in Benders narrative as 
 there always tends to be in accounts of the shift from Gemeinschaft to 
 Gesellschaft . Yet it is also 
 clear that the transformation from civic to disciplinary 
 professionalism was necessary. 

   

 The new disciplines offered relatively precise subject matter and 
 procedures, Bender concedes, at a time when both were greatly 
 confused. The new professionalism also promised guarantees of 
 competence certification in an era when criteria of intellectual 
 authority were vague and professional performance was unreliable. 

 But in the epilogue to Intellect and Public Life , Bender suggests that the process eventually went too far. The risk now is precisely the opposite, he writes. Academe is 
 threatened by the twin dangers of fossilization and scholasticism 
 (of three types: tedium, high tech, and radical chic). The agenda for the next decade, at least as I see it, ought to be 
 the opening up of the disciplines, the ventilating of professional 
 communities that have come to share too much and that have become 
 too self-referential.

 Knowledge and competence 
 increasingly developed out of the internal dynamics of esoteric 
 disciplines rather than within the context of shared perceptions 
 of public needs, writes Bender. This is not to say that 
 professionalized disciplines or the modern service professions 
 that imitated them became socially irresponsible. But their 
 contributions to society began to flow from their own 
 self-definitions rather than from a reciprocal engagement with 
 general public discourse. 

 

 Now, there is a definite note of sadness in Benders narrative 
 as there always tends to be in accounts of the shift from Gemeinschaft to Gesellschaft . Yet it 
 is also clear that the transformation from civic to disciplinary 
 professionalism was necessary. 

   

 The new disciplines offered relatively precise subject matter 
 and procedures, Bender concedes, at a time when both were 
 greatly confused. The new professionalism also promised 
 guarantees of competence certification in an era when 
 criteria of intellectual authority were vague and professional 
 performance was unreliable. 

 But in the epilogue to Intellect and Public Life , Bender suggests that the process eventually went too far. The 
 risk now is precisely the opposite, he writes. Academe is 
 threatened by the twin dangers of fossilization and 
 scholasticism (of three types: tedium, high tech, and radical 
 chic). The agenda for the next decade, at least as I see it, ought to 
 be the opening up of the disciplines, the ventilating of 
 professional communities that have come to share too much and 
 that have become too self-referential.
