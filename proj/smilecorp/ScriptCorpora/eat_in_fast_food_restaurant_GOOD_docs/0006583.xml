 PARENTING ISSUES CAPTURED THE HEADLINES 

 Published On 06-29-2012 , 6:22 PM 

                         Teenagers Make Granny Cry                      
  
 Grandma Karen Klein, the 68-year-old bus monitor from Greece, New York, was bullied until she cried and just couldn’t hold up to the middle school teenage passengers who taunted her. Is that the story? 
 
“She just needed a little bit of Madea to put those kids in their place,”said one soul sista from the‘hood who went on to add how she woulda been upside some heads.

Madea, the movie character played by Tyler Perry, doesn’t put up with unruly kids, and in one scene on board a school bus she jumps over a seat to beat a young disrespectful loud-mouth student“upside his head.”

But let’s not be so fast to condemn the mild-mannered grey-haired granny who took the taunting and never answered back.
  Fact is, school districts have policies for those who ride the bus chaperoning students, and those policies let employees know they haven’t got a voice - not confronting the student seems to be the behavior pattern expected.   Job versus attitude? Getting the paycheck will most likely beat Madea’s character every time.  
What would I have done? With a policy that says students rule, I could never have taken the job.  Kids don’t get the last word in my world. In fact, I’m not quick to let‘em have the first word.
              Sandusky Guilty of 45 of 48 Child Sexual Abuse Counts   
Jerry Sandusky, the Penn State Assistant Athletic Coach found guilty on 45 out of 48 sexual abuse counts was a verdict that hopefully will reach the untold number of injured souls who have suffered at the hands of child predators.
 We keep hearing the victims pretty much felt“Nobody would believe a kid.” Yesteryear’s secret must no longer have a safe place to hide. Today’s reality means parents not only are challenged to listen up but they are, hopefully, put on notice to own up. Because most often childhood sexual abuse is happening at home and not in Sandusky’s locker rooms or showers at Penn State University. 
Too powerful to fall? Sandusky fell and so can Uncle George, Dad and the rest of the bunch who’ve been having their way with our sons and daughters.

Too young to know what someone is doing to them?  Never too young.  Parents who were unaware this kind of predatory behavior existed should have learned a huge lesson with the Sandusky trial and verdict.

                                  Nobody would believe a kid? Parents better.

 WHAT TO DO WITH THE KIDS? 

 Published On 06-08-2012 , 11:00 PM 

Schools let out for summer vacation each June, just as they start back up in September.
 
 But too many parents ponder the same question around this time every year: What to do with the kids?

My friends with the fat income know that in June their pre-teens will visit the fraternal grandparents in Wisconsin, as they&apos;ve done every even year since they were in third grade. In the odd-numbered years, the maternal grandparents get their turn.

This is an honored family tradition that provides time for the elders to learn all about the youngsters in the family.

These friends are one of the many families I know who don&apos;t see their children&apos;s schools as the fall, winter and spring babysitter. They also are high on the parental responsibility chart for creating weekday activities in the home that take place if an adult isn&apos;t there when the school day comes to an end.

After-school programs? Aren&apos;t they really just more baby-sitting for those parents who aren&apos;t assuming their responsibility?

It isn&apos;t the fat-income folk who need these services, some folks will argue, and these critics make sure to include in their discussion the need single and working parents have for adequate supervision for their children during those crucial hours when they&apos;re still on the job or stuck on the freeway trying to get back home.

I&apos;m not so sure it is the luxury of a fat income that creates annual summertime visits with the grandparents or weekday activities in the home. Rather, I suspect it is the ability to plan and organize.

It is not a bad idea, no matter the household budget, to raise kids who understand what it means to come home each day after school and take on some responsible activities until Mom or Pop gets there.

Long before the term“latch-key kid”caught on, there were some simple rules for being at home before the parents got there: Don&apos;t open the front door if someone rings the bell or knocks; no playing/ hanging outside; no friends over; your snack is in the refrigerator under the dish on the top shelf; start on your homework; do your chores.

While Wisconsin isn&apos;t in the works for every family, what about the children who have grandparents just on the other side of the freeway?

“That&apos;s just not going to work because kids don&apos;t want to be around old people, and my parents say my kids are disrespectful because they speak up,”explained Ms. Mom, who was sitting in the front row during a parent workshop I conducted.

What to do with the kids?

If you can&apos;t send‘em to Wisconsin for the summer or somewhere on the other side of the freeway, teach &apos;em some respect sprinkled with a cupful of responsibility.

 TOUGH TIMES REQUIRE TOUGH CHANGES 

 Published On 06-02-2012 , 12:37 PM 


Times are tough and some folks recognize that their everyday spending habits need to be reigned in.
 It sounded as though the woman was saying something about the economy was in trouble. She was strolling down a grocery aisle pushing an overloaded shopping cart while, of course, chatting on her cell phone.
Instead of her hands being on the cart handle, one was holding the electronic gadget to her ear and the other had an opened-out flyer that touted the store&apos;s special prices for the week. This woman was slowly and miraculously guiding the cart with her hips and part of her upper torso.

Quite a dance and quite a sight to behold. But her cell phone conversation topped the physical performance.

On the canned food aisle, where I spotted her, she was telling her phone buddy, the cans looked about the same, but then she exclaimed that every one she reached for seemed smaller than her last purchase.

Ms Shopper didn’t bother to read the label that would have confirmed her suspicion, because two full ounces were indeed missing from what used to be, and the price had not lessened to reflect this diminished amount but had instead increased.

Canned goods didn’t make it into her cart which was pretty much filled with non-nutritional items. There was lots of bottled juice; well, let me correct that statement, there was lots of fruit juice cocktail touting something like 12% juice.

The juice cocktail was listed with the specials in the weekly flyer, but it wasn’t really much of a bargain when its 12% juice content is compared to a bottle of 100% juice.

Just as the shopper slapped her last can of corn back on the shelf she sent a loud burst of profanity into her phone.

One of her beautifully-decorated 1/2-inch acrylic nails chipped off a finger on the hand that was holding the flyer and that was moving items around on the shelf.

The economy is tough on folks and it’s even tougher for folks who are faced with the dilemma of having to arrange priorities and to cut corners when they’ve spent a lifetime doing as they please.

The cost of repairing that broken nail is considerably more than the increased amount for the can of corn.

The cost of maintaining those nails may be pretty close to what the grocery bill is for the month.

Now, the cell phone unnecessary chit-chat is another cost too many folks haven’t yet realized they could live without.

Yup, the packages in the markets are smaller and the cost is higher. No, juice cocktail is not the same as juice.

But If we don’t start paying closer attention to what we’re spending our little bit of money on, the trouble our national economy is in will be nothing when compared to the havoc we’re creating in our own households.

 PASADENA POLICE CHIEF PROTECTS HIS MEN - YOU ASKED FOR MORE 

 Published On 04-01-2012 , 5:30 PM 

I’ve gotten many emails asking for more about the shooting death of Kendrec McDade,

The teenager was first shot by a police officer who was sitting on the driver’s side of the squad car. The distance between the murderer and the unarmed teen was approximately 10 feet.

The second officer, who was on foot, opened fire shortly after his partner in the patrol car fired.

The scene was a dark street. The officers did not have lights nor did they activate the patrol car system that would have recorded the incident.

Pasadena Police Chief Sanchez addressed the community regarding this incident on Saturday, March 31st. The gathering took place at New Revelation Baptist Church which is located in the‘hood just around the corner from the murder scene.

 
 One of the many troubling things the Chief said was that the incident was a very sad one for the City of Pasadena and for the family. This is the order in which, my notes say, he mentioned the sadness of the tragedy.

The only part of the orderly gathering that had a ring of striking a meaningful chord was when the moderator read the first question on a card from the audience and jumbled what the question was. She read,“Are the officers still on parole?” 

A light amount of applause, but she quickly corrected things and asked if the officers were still on patrol/duty.

No, they are on paid administrative leave was the answer.

Other answers:

1) Officers are trained to shoot to STOP ( I has sent my question“Why did they shoot to kill?”)

2) Not an often used tactic/manuever, but Pasadena officers are trained to fire from their squad car

The 9-1-1 tape was played where the caller reported being burglarized by two men both with guns. Unfortunately, and as the police would have it, there are those in the community who want to blame the 9-1-1 caller who was wrong BUT who did not pull the trigger and who is not paid by taxpayers to&quot;protect and serve.&quot;

Far too many questions were answered by the Chief stating“the investigation will show. . .”Or by saying,“We’re involved in an investigation. . . .”

The meeting was a sham. The Mayor opened by welcoming us all. It could have been a city redistricting meeting held at city hall. There were approx 200 people in attendance including several city council members, city manager and a lot of well behaved self-proclaimed community activist. I stayed for an hour and left 15-20 minutes before the event of support for the officers concluded.

The City of Pasadena is full of shit! Oh, the police report lists the officers as victims - which I believe, in part, means they cannot be named in a civil lawsuit.

Boy, I kinda wish my mother had protected my bad behavior in such a manner.

Please follow the links for a full report on the Chief’s meeting in the local Pasadena Sun and The Pasadena Star News.

 PASADENA POLICE MURDER BLACK TEEN 

 Published On 03-31-2012 , 8:21 PM 

 

Kendrec McDade, suspected of armed robbery, was shot dead by Pasadena police officers last Saturday night as he was, it is reported, running from them.

Two officers opened fire on the young man from Azusa, one from his squad car and the other while engaged in a foot pursuit. The officers claim to have felt threatened when, they allege, McDade reached into his waistband.

No weapon was found on McDade, nor has a weapon been found at the crime scene on Sunset Avenue near Orange Grove Boulevard in Northwest Pasadena - the &apos;hood.

Maybe the officers felt threatened, as a 911 call reported that a person fitting McDade&apos;s description and a 17-year-old partner in crime brandished a gun while robbing the victim who placed the call.

But most surely, in our supposedly civilized society, the penalty for such an act isn&apos;t death on the street but instead an arrest, a trial, and, if found guilty, a prison sentence.

Is shoot-to-kill the kind of skilled training our police officers receive? Or is shoot-to-kill supposed to be an acceptable practice in Northwest Pasadena?

When McDade told his family he was headed out to Pasadena that fateful Saturday, it was just to be another weekend night in the &apos;hood.

Like any other young person his age, he probably had plans for the next day. As for those who loved him most, his family, they certainly had no plans for receiving that dreadful middle-of-the-night call every black family with a young male in the household knows might come their way.

But McDade may well have been up to no good. And furthermore, he shouldn&apos;t have been running when the officer was pursuing him on foot and must have surely yelled for him to halt.

Ah, so many of our young people are up to no good when they&apos;re out on Saturday night—or any other night, for that matter.

And so many of our young people don&apos;t do what we tell them to do and so often seem to think they can get away with, well, whatever.

But the price of doing wrong, being young, being foolish and being a black male shouldn&apos;t be a death sentence at the hands of those who are sworn to protect and to serve.

“This had nothing to do with his color,”a friend, who doesn&apos;t look like me, proclaimed about this Pasadena incident as he and I talked about the Trayvon Martin killing in Florida.

In the eyes and thought patterns of those of us who dwell in the vicinity of the killing—Northwest Pasadena—just about every incident of this magnitude is racial, and it doesn&apos;t much matter how much good the various Pasadena police programs do in the community.

This shooting is every black family&apos;s nightmare: a late-night call, a drive to an emergency room, disbelief, tears, a talk with the coroner&apos;s office, a death certificate and funeral arrangements.

This is any community&apos;s nightmare: a victim who lied about a suspect brandishing a weapon, the police responding like they&apos;re in a war zone, and the local folks pretty much fed up.

 BEING YOUNG IS NO GUARANTEE FOR BEING FIT 

 Published On 03-15-2012 , 8:24 PM 

I dropped by the emergency room at Huntington Memorial Hospital the other night. Actually it was the wee hours of the morning—3 a.m., to be exact.
                                                                      
My daughter, Brandi, was in tow. She didn&apos;t really believe her inability to breathe was cause for medical assistance, but she knew from past experience that treatment at the hospital would get her back to normal.

She wasn&apos;t alone in her quest for relief. The nurse informed us the evening easily could have been labeled Asthma Night. Fifteen patients had already shown up because they had trouble breathing.

The weather has been crazy, for sure, feeling like winter one day and summer the next.

“Flowers don&apos;t really know they&apos;ve been blooming early,”said my cheerful next-door neighbor as she clipped a few for an arrangement on her dining-room table.

But Brandi, the others who went to Huntington Memorial that night and all the other people who&apos;ve sought treatment don&apos;t think of the early-blooming flowers in the same gleeful manner as my neighbor.

With the multitude of triggers that can bring on an asthma attack, blaming the changing weather, early-blooming flowers and the pollen in the air is selling the story somewhat short. But seeing so many patients checking into the emergency room at the same time makes a mother think the weather is the likely cause of the nighttime rush.

Nine hours in emergency with doses of steriods. antibiotics and inhalants did not crack Brandi&apos;s wheezing. After four days in the hospital, I wonder if, at last, she understands that being asthmatic is a serious health issue.

There&apos;s something about young folk—and I hear this story from too many other parents—that makes them think life and wellbeing are guaranteed.

The elderly gentleman who arrived in the emergency room on a stretcher, wheezing and wearing a breathing mask, received his life-saving treatments and walked out of the place.

“What!”said a wheezing and a somewhat dismayed Brandi.“I&apos;m younger and so much more fit.”

One morning I thought to take some beautifully blooming flowers from my yard when I went to visit her, since she refuses to make that important connection between asthma attacks and the causes that can trigger them.

But since parenting requires the adult to exhibit so much more sense than the offspring, I simply showed up at bedside with a smile and pleasant conversation.

Am I worried about the young lady? Of course I am.

But concern aside, one of the more difficult parenting tasks is making sure that our young people understand their bodies and what is required to stay healthy.

Younger and more fit? Youth is no guarantee of good health, and being fit doesn&apos;t automatically come with being young.

 A TASTE OF REALITY 

 Published On 03-02-2012 , 9:44 AM 

 I&apos;m a strong supporter of protest rallies, sit-ins, boycotts and the like. 
 
These kind of movements have been instrumental in focusing much-needed attention on social ills. More importantly, they are often the power behind needed social change.

But Pasadena City College students protesting against the college because the California state budget shortfall has limited the number of available classes doesn’t speak much to the social problem of a budget crisis. Instead, and unfortunately, the students’actions at last week’s board of trustees meeting speak more to the seldom-discussed issue of spoiled young people.

When education is handed free to our kids in their younger days, we parents pretty much neglect to help them realize the pot of gold they’re being given.

Our kids want this and they want that, and as parents, we stand guilty of providing, without explaining the idea behind the old-time expression that money doesn’t grow on trees.

I suspect the PCC student protesters have missed the stories about kids who never had their own textbooks but had to share with classmates. Classes for these poor students never got cancelled because only one classroom housed many grades and all subjects.

A one-room schoolhouse is not a figment of imagination. It’s where many of us have come from. We have not forgotten what a special privilege it was not to be working the soil on the family farm, but instead to be learning how to read.

Plenty of folks will surely admonish me for focusing on stuff from long ago, saying it has no meaning for today’s youth. There’s a lot to be said in support of student activism, and a lot more to be said against stuff from the past.

However, the days of old may well have an influence on the adults who manage the budget cuts that PCC students are protesting.

“How would you feel if your graduation date was delayed because the classes you needed were not there?”my annoyed daughter, who attends PCC, asked.

My answer:“In 1942, I never knew exactly how my young Japanese friends felt when they were hauled off to relocation camps in the middle of enjoying the freedoms afforded all the rest of us in the neighborhood.”

“You never make much sense when you tell old stories,”my daughter sighed.

But my world has no room for concern about students not graduating from junior college on schedule, not when I know how almost overnight, my neighbors, the Shimizuno family, and other Japanese Americans on the West Coast, lost jobs, businesses, homes, education opportunities, relationships and their standing in the community.

Being offered fewer classes and not being able to graduate as planned may be the elixir PCC students have never had the chance to taste. The student protesters need a strong dose of historical reality to help them recognize they’ve been living the good life.

 ARREST THE PARENTS 

 Published On 02-16-2012 , 7:25 PM 

When it comes to parenting, it seems a practical idea to know where your kid is. According to local police, it’s even better to know where your kid isn’t.

 
 
Pasadena Police Lt. Thomas Delgado told the Sun in a Feb. 12 story that teen involvement in burglaries is highest during the school year and tapers off in the summer.

“Anytime you have kids that are being truant or ditching class from school, you’re going to have an increase in thefts in the community,”Delgado said.

Since burglaries increase because too many sons and daughters decide against showing up at school, and instead break into homes and cart off loot, parents need to recognize that this directly stems from their lack of proper supervision.

Parenting, like any other on-going commitment, works best when children understand the consequences of dereliction of duty.

I’ve heard the same excuse over the years from parents when it comes to ensuring that our young people do the right thing:“I can’t make her/him do that.”

I have repeatedly gotten a question about my own daughters:“How did you get her to do that?”

It is less work to establish rules in the home, and enforce them, than it is to interrupt a work day to go to the police department and collect a kid who has been arrested. That arrest journey doesn’t end with the trip to the station, either, because then there are court dates and the need for a lawyer.

Common sense—and I’m almost afraid to use the term—tells us that when parents don’t do their job, law enforcement and the judicial system must do theirs.

And about the loot the kids bring home after playing hooky, breaking in and removing it from someone else’s residence?

They stash it at home in the bedroom parents never raid because that would be an invasion of their child’s privacy.

According to police, burglars often intend to pawn the items they take, but sometimes teenage girls look for purses or clothes they decide to keep.

Duty requires that all parents know what’s in their home. A new purse? Where’s the sales receipt? No sales receipt, no purse.

I conduct parenting workshops. Some of those workshops are at a women’s prison. An incarcerated mom once asked if any of my kids had gone to prison.

“My kids called me the warden,”was my answer.“They knew what lock-up would be like.”

For parents who don’t know their kids are cutting class, there is no excuse. For parents who allow stolen goods to be brought into their home, that is dereliction of duty.

While Delgado advises residents not to make it easy on would-be intruders, I’m looking for someone in an official capacity to throw the book—some charges—at the parents of teens who break the law.

 PCC IS THE PLACE TO GO 

 Published On 12-09-2011 , 4:12 AM 

 
 
Pasadena City College Lancer Marching Band Kicks Off Every Rose Parade. 

A close friend with a flourishing business is currently enrolled in a Television and Radio Department class at Pasadena City College. He told me something about needing to learn the art of the voice-over.

Though this gentleman is classified as a senior citizen, and one who has earned several college degrees, he has not been placed in a special class for those who’ve already been around the block a few times. Instead he has the opportunity, as do younger students, to learn in a multi-generational environment.

Then there’s the story of the disappointed parents of the son who wasn’t, for whatever reason, shipping off to the Ivy League college of the family’s dreams.

“Huh?”they responded when the suggestion of Pasadena City College was floated their way.“But, but…”they stammered throughout a conversation on the merits of attending our local community college.

Just about every Pasadena local can give directions to Pasadena City College, but few talk about all that this learning institution offers. There’s much to take in.

For starters, while searching for what to do over the holidays, going for a walk around the campus grounds with family members both young and old can be a winner.

One good stop is the campus art gallery’s new exhibition,“The Shape of the Universe: Recent Deep Space Photography,”which runs through Feb. 9. For sure, Jet Propulsion Laboratory is not the only space act in town.

Take a rest stop at Galloway Plaza, which offers an opportunity to appreciate just how fortunate our community is to have local philanthropist Bill Galloway, who supports the college.

To the south of the plaza, take in the Boone Sculpture Garden, containing pieces donated by the Hixon Foundation, yet another sign of local philanthropy at work.

Then to the north is the fabulous Shatford Library, named for local attorney, civil rights activist and former college trustee Walter T. Shatford.

Oh, you know all about these things. Yes, lots of us know the campus like, well, the back of our hands. But too many people haven’t got a clue.

Enrollment figures from fall 2010 give us a quick look at who’s got their minds focused on what the place has to offer. Out of 32,000 credit students and 8,000 noncredit students, African Americans account for a shameful 6.5%.

Is that just too bad for them? There’s that theory that says, Them that’s got shall get and them that’s not, oh, well.

But maybe before it is time to enroll a relative in college, families underrepresented on the Pasadena City College campus—African-Americans, that is—should recognize the power of this local resource and introduce Pasadena City College to their children as the place where academic achievement is a reality for the young and the old.

 PARENTS TO BLAME FOR EXISTENCE OF BOOT CAMPS 

 Published On 11-10-2011 , 1:22 PM 

Headlines across the nation are focusing on teen boot camps, thanks in part to Pasadena programs run by Keith Gibbs (known to many as“Sarge”) and Kelvin McFarland.

 
 
A video depicting a scene allegedly from their program, showing a teen wearing a car tire around the neck and being yelled at by adults in Army fatigues, aired on national news and set off the fury. Additional stringent tactics were involved in the episode. While Sarge has been under scrutiny for some years, I haven’t heard any complaints directed toward the parents who raise kids they can’t manage and who foolishly believe in any proposal that has even a scant promise of reining in their wayward children.

Parents shoulder the blame for teen boot camp programs, not the camp operators who have, in true American tradition, found a way to make a buck off those who abdicate to a higher authority.

Parents who, for whatever reason, don’t know how to raise decent children have created an industry replete with a wide range of programs portending to correct problems that the parents themselves have created and allowed to fester throughout their children’s growth years.

The kids being sent to boot camp didn’t just start having problems the month before mom or pop signed‘em up.

The kids being sent to boot camp were most likely a good bit of trouble early on. Unfortunately, too many times the bad stuff we see in our kids’behavior is attributed to anything other than our own parenting practices.

Who are the parents seeking such drastic discipline measures as a boot camp under someone else’s design and marching orders?

They are the ones who, with a bragging tone to their declaration, will say,“I can’t do a thing with him.”

But both law enforcement and prison officials will do plenty with the kids whose parents never taught them exactly who is in charge.

Who are these parents?

They are the ones who, without a flicker of understanding of their own responsibility in the matter, will say of their teenage daughter,“She just doesn’t come home at night, and I can’t make her.”

Before this daughter became a teenager, she should have been made to understand who sets the rules and who is required to follow them.

The focus of wrongdoing ought not to be on boot camps. The focus ought to be on teaching parents how to do their job, which would in large measure eliminate the need for programs that provide intervention services.

The kids sent to boot camp eventually return home to the same undisciplined environment that produced their troublesome behavior.

Home needs to be a place where, among other values, children learn respect for authority and learn they must follow rules created in their best interest.

As parents, we have lots of lessons to learn ourselves. One is that our children reflect that which we, as role models, present to them.

 RIDING FAST ON RED BULL 

 Published On 08-29-2011 , 11:57 AM 

 
 Television show,&quot;Family Guy&quot;has an episode focusing
on Red Bull!
 
The recent arrest of 21-year-old Eric Petrossian in South Pasadena for the theft of Red Bull caused the city’s police department to put out a bulletin, hoping to find whether there is a link between this crime and others in nearby cities involving this controversial drink popular with young adults and then there&apos;s my twenty-something daughter who thought to give the product a try.

“The stuff isn’t good for you,“I said to my daughter after she had stocked a few of the attractive red and royal blue cans in our refrigerator.

“What?”she replied with absolute astonishment.“It just takes like apple juice—well, with sort of an aftertaste.”

But unlike apple juice, a can or two of Red Bull a day is not likely to keep the doctor away.

Instead, visitors to the official Red Bull website learn that“for more than 23 years, Red Bull has been giving wings to people across the globe who want to be physically and mentally fit. Red Bull becomes part of their life: during study sessions, intense work days and late nights out, while on the road, and playing sports or video games. In short, Red Bull vitalizes body and mind in virtually any situation of our daily life.”

New reports tell us that Petrossian may have been planning on marketing his collection. The stuff costs about two bucks a can, and, I suspect, buyers with hopes of finding a better life in a can are plentiful.

Sounds like drugs to me.

The animated television show“Family Guy,”where my twentysomething says she first heard of Red Bull, has portrayed this life enhancer as a definite upper.

The lead character, Peter, after consuming the energy drink, talks fast, takes on new challenges and becomes an entirely different person. Even a flower planted outside Peter’s house, after having a can of Red Bull poured on it, is able to jump out of the earth, walk across the street and steal a car.

The consumption of this beverage is about as troublesome as the wave of Red Bull thefts that South Pasadena police are checking out.

Some people, according to articles on the product, rely so heavily on Red Bull to get them through their day—as the website suggests they ought to do—that it borders on addiction.

In 2008, a number of German states ordered retailers to stop selling Red Bull Cola (another company drink) after it tested positive for cocaine. While the levels were too low to cause health risks, the discovery raised awareness about what goes into these types of products.

South Pasadena Police Det. Richard Lee has said his department is looking for a common thread in the recent thefts.“For some strange reason,”he said,“they’re just in demand.”

Not a lot of sophisticated investigative work is required to figure out that reason. My daughter will be happy to provide the detectives working the case with a link to the“Family Guy”episode showing yard plants hijacking cars and Peter behaving like a mad man.

The not-so-strange reason, I suggest, is simply one of getting high. The not-so-strange reason, I suggest, is drugs.

 KIMBERLY WIMBERLY HAS GONE TO COURT FOR ALL BLACK STUDENTS

Kimberly Wimberly, who lives way down south in Arkansas, is nobody’s country girl. The young lady recently graduated from McGehee Secondary School earning the highest grade point average in her class.

Most often this classification is known to crown such a student as the class valedictorian. The word is defined as an academic title conferred upon the highest-ranked student among those graduating from an educational institute in the United States.

McGehee Secondary School doesn’t seem to be quibbling about Wimberly’s top-ranked placement, and most of us recognize that Arkansas is, indeed, located in the good ol’USA.

While the state was part of the Confederacy, the Civil War settled that concept of whether it was part of a separate entity. Arkansas is, and has been for over 100 years, located in the United States of America.

But something’s amiss as Wimberly has submitted a complaint to the U.S. District Court for Arkansas’Eastern District which claims she was named the school’s valedictorian and then later given co-valedictorian status with a white student who had lower grades. The complaint further claims she was stripped of the original status because she is black.

Oh, you say, there goes one of them, again, yelling racism whenever things don’t go their way. What truly can be the matter with having this honor split between as many graduating students as possible?

In a school with a 46% black student population, Wimberly’s had to kick some butt to reach the top and having done so, this academic honor she rightly believes ought to be hers.

Kick butt? Her complaint also argues the school district habitually withheld from black students access to challenging classes.

Come on now, what’s that supposed to mean? To clarify for those who would pose the question, the answer is in just about every inner-city school district across the nation.

On the first day of every school year, there was just one question I asked all of my six children throughout their junior and senior high school years: How many white kids are in your class?

If they had to think about their answer, my next statement was; : See your counselor and change the class.

A high number of black students in a class spelled doom, whereas a high number of white students meant we could expect a challenge - a high level of work and expectations.

Kick butt means Wimberly had to, with little help from teachers or counselors, find those advance placement classes on her own and with the help of her home support group.

Cry wolf? I don’t think so. Cry racism? Answer for yourself why the black student with the top grades became a co-valedictorian.

Superintendent of Schools in Arkansas, Thomas Gathen, has told CNN that&quot;. . . This is strictly an academic issue and a policy issue, not a racial issue.”

Perhaps, but officials who are pretty much tight-lipped at this point saying they’ve not been served with court papers, aren’t saying having co-valedictorians is not an anomaly and a search of their records will show us this is how it is always done at McGehee Middle School.

However, anything short of the school’s past selection process reflecting this (and I’ve got faith in Wimberly and her support team doing their homework before going to court) looks to me like white folks are at it, again.

 TAKING THE &apos;LAZY&apos; OUT OF THE DAYS OF SUMMER 

 Published On 06-26-2011 , 8:08 AM 


FAR too many parents are at a loss when it comes to managing their kids now that summer vacation is here.

This type of late June through early September frenzy speaks loudly about schools being seen as babysitters.

These months, when programmed academia has come to a halt, can be the opportunity we parents have been missing out on all year long. These summer days can be that part of the year when we find out, in case we haven&apos;t been keeping up, just what exactly our youngsters have and have not been up to when it come to learning.

Did our elementary student write any kind of report this past year? If so, unless the paper was an A+, a brief review will most surely produce a few loopholes that time spent in the local library can help fill in the missing points to the product.

While not every parent has the know-how to help improve the project, there are great people working at the library who can assist.

But let&apos;s be clear, this is a parent-child project with a little help from the staff who are not be seen as the summertime babysitters.

Often, parents speak proudly of their offspring sleeping late into the afternoon, which means, according to the in-charge adult who permits this inactivity, there&apos;s really not much need for any summer-time plan.

Oh, to plop these city-dwelling, late-sleeping teenagers down on the farm where their grandparents grew up in an environment when the work day started before dawn.
 Oh, to see these days ahead of us as an opportunity to help our children be better prepared for September when it rolls around much quicker than we thought it would get here. 
And why can&apos;t the teenagers spend a little time doing the academic work they never did last school year?

Myron, who didn&apos;t do so well in math class and did about the same in social studies and history, would benefit greatly from some parental summertime scheduling.

While schools are certainly on the chopping block for not delivering what they are mandated to do - educating children - there&apos;s a few things parents ought to recognize as our responsibility.

With knowledge available at the click of a computer, online search, there&apos;s no place for lazy days of summer.&quot;Geez,&quot;my own kids used to declare,&quot;can&apos;t you let up and give us a break?&quot;

There&apos;s only one answer and maybe I got it from my grandparents, even though they did not grow up on a farm,&quot;Your whole life is a break.&quot;

Summer boredom shouldn&apos;t exist. Summer activities shouldn&apos;t be built upon whatever programs the recreation departments and other organizations offer.

Surely we parents are creative enough to establish age appropriate schedules, projects, chores and cost-free entertainment.

Last weekend, two kids in my neighborhood had a blanket on their front lawn and a large picnic basket. They stretched out for close to an hour nibbling on snacks and chit-chatting with each other.

Some parents paint their own picture for the kids, others may not, as yet, understand they&apos;ve got the power to make the lazy days of summer a unique and meaningful experience.

 IT WAS SWEET WHEN DAD CAME MARCHING HOME 

 Published On 06-18-2011 , 12:45 AM 


MY dad marched off to World War II when other dads in our neighborhood were left behind.

How come Mr. Pickett, father of two, got drafted? As best I can remember, and there&apos;s no one left in our family or our circle of old-time friends who can say differently - my mother had filed divorce papers.

Well, anyway, that&apos;s what dad claimed. But history tells the story somewhat differently. Initially, it is true that fathers weren&apos;t part of those called up for duty, but I&apos;ve read because of the rise in war casualties, married men and fathers were added to the list of drafted men.

So, no matter my mother&apos;s flagrant actions, Mr. Pickett was destined for that trip overseas aboard a UnitedStates carrier to fight the Germans and the Japanese.

Did he bring back war stories? Maybe so, but I never heard any. But he did return with some specials that no other kids on our block had privy to.

My older sister and I got loaded into the old Ford car without automatic windows, air conditioning or a mapping system and off we went to Fort MacArthur in San Pedro.

War meant a lot of changes in life and one of those was the rationing of just about everything. Having a candy bar was pretty much unheard of and both Baby Ruths and Milky Ways became no more than a thought of days gone by.

But not after Dad came home and took us to San Pedro. I guess it was the commissary where returning soldiers could buy lots of things. I had no name for the place and didn&apos;t really need one- for me it was the candy store.

There was something magic about being the only kids on the block who had boxes of the sugar treats when no one else had any, because their dads weren&apos;t returning from duties overseas.

During the days of rationing, I remember the man standing outside the Coliseum in Exposition Park who sold me a penny piece of bubble gum for a dime - and I was glad to get it.

With Dad back home and frequent trips to Fort MacArthur providing more candy than my mother would allow us to eat, magic was in the air - or so I thought.

Butch Edmonson from down the street, my father announced one day, would probably like some of our candy to share with his brothers and sisters.

But Ms. Edmonson hadn&apos;t filled any divorce papers. Mr. Edmonson had not been shipped off to fight in France and Germany. Young Shirlee Pickett wanted to know, but knew better than to ask, how come their kids should share what soldiers&apos; families got?

My father had a strange way of reading my thoughts. Maybe because we were both Capricorns. However he came to see things, I didn&apos;t get to go to San Pedro again and our supply of candy strangely disappeared from the sacred storage spot.

By the way, my mother&apos;s plans for divorce must have gotten squelched as my younger sister, born in 1947 and classified as one of the many born as a result of returning soldiers, was clear evidence of a marriage no longer on the rocks.

 GOOD GOLLY, MS MOLLY, YOU EAT WHAT? 

 Published On 06-11-2011 , 10:22 AM 


For the sake of anonymity, I&apos;ll just refer to my one-time neighbor as Ms. Molly. I&apos;m not going to list the names of her children, either. I guess this goes without saying, for to call the offspring by name would reveal the true identity of the woman who was supposed to be in charge.

Ms. Molly had five kids and one dog. It is amazing how pets have come to occupy a spot in some of our lives that often gets more attention than the humans.

Pinky, as I came to call the neighbor&apos;s poodle because it wore this color clothing more often than anything else, was only fed gourmet, organic dog food because, well, just because.

Pinky&apos;s, unlike the children&apos;s, dietary needs were a top consideration for my neighbor although she did put a bit of planning into the acquisition of what the kids would eat.

Monday was drive-thru at McDonald&apos;s, Tuesday was Jack in the Box, Wednesday was The Colonel&apos;s, Thursday was leftovers and Friday was a sit-down meal inside Carl&apos;s Jr.

&quot;What?&quot;she always demanded of me when I would ask about this kind of dinner schedule.

Vegetables?&quot;There&apos;s lettuce and tomato on the burgers and potatoes are still in that category,&quot;was her constant remark when this conversation came up.

Fries, burgers and a shake were the standard food fair. But Pinky the poodle was not allowed to partake of any leftover fast-food junk because, well, just because.

The dog went to the veterinarian for regular check-ups, immunizations and whatever else pampered pets are seen for. During these visits, Ms. Molly shared with me that she was given sound professional advice as to what her dog should and should not eat. Plain and simple, she explained, only organic, balanced meals.

The government regulates and inspects what people eat, and fast-food restaurants would not get permits to operate if they were serving bad food, according to my one-time neighbor, who also believed a shake was milk for the day and a strawberry one answered the call for the day&apos;s fruit.

She didn&apos;t outright call me Old Fuddy-Dud, but by suggesting I haven&apos;t kept up with the times, or fast food, I got the definite impression my thoughts on what kids should and shouldn&apos;t eat weren&apos;t very current.

Ms. Molly moved away before McDonald&apos;s began serving oatmeal for breakfast, but she only went there for dinner, anyway.

What did her kids eat for breakfast? She said she didn&apos;t really know because they were eligible for the free breakfast and lunch program at their school and her only responsibility was to provide dinner.

I suspect this mother isn&apos;t alone in her belief that whatever we&apos;re sold in an eatery is good for us or it wouldn&apos;t have passed inspection. However, her calculation regarding a strawberry shake being something beyond red-colored sugar I hope is her own concept of what her kids are gulping down.

Talking with Ms. Molly, mother of many, made me wonder where we actually learn what and how to feed our children. If the veterinarian brought this dog owner to understand it was only to be fed certain food, what was the pediatrician not talking about?

 WHICH KID IS THE BEST? 

 Published On 06-04-2011 , 8:56 AM 


The former boy&apos;s baseball coach said too many moms thought they could demand special treatment for their sons.

&quot;They wanted this and they wanted that,&quot;and Coach went on to explain how too many of these moms thought they had a say when it came to what position their kid was to play on the team and when he should play.

When they don&apos;t have parents providing them with examples of how life really works, young people cannot be expected to grow up to be responsible adults.

Perhaps the rules have changed. Perhaps that old adage about how cheaters never prosper no longer has relevance. Maybe it never did.

The attitude that&quot;my boy is the best pitcher on this team, so put him in, Coach&quot;goes along with the pushy mom who believes her daughter, by any means necessary, is destined to be crowned queen of the beauty pageant.

From my early parenting years, I remember Michelle Mason, the dark-haired, blue-eyed little girl who was the daughter of the woman my mother worked for.

Mrs. Mason, according to my mother, the maid, on a daily basis told Michelle she was prettier than any little girl anywhere. Michelle, our family heard, spent hours in the mirror brushing her hair and practicing how to smile. She changed her outfits, shoes included, several times a day.

The little girl constantly repeated, in the same tone of voice, the words her mother pounded into her head.

Life went well until Michelle&apos;s first day at the exclusive private school when she looked around and saw many other pretty girls. She got off the school bus in tears.

Of course it was the maid&apos;s job to soothe the childhood heartache.

Life got more complicated at the Mason home when my brother went to work with my mother one summer day and was invited, by the son who was the age of my brother, to swim in the family pool.

The young man of the house couldn&apos;t keep up with the colored kid&apos;s strong kick and arm strokes in the water and was left by the edge of the pool.

Like his sister, he couldn&apos;t believe he wasn&apos;t the best. He demanded answers.

Back in the day, many of us in the African-American community learned a whole lot from the folks who ran the homes our mothers lived in.

While the Masons didn&apos;t set the standard for how kids on the other side of the tracks were raised, their method was certainly discussed, dissected and found to be lacking in responsible parenting.

My mother was known for holding conversations beginning like this:&quot;Oh, no you will not, not with my grandchildren.&quot;

Of course we&apos;ve known some people of color who are just as shortsighted when it comes to raising kids as the Masons were. This kind of parenting nonsense has no income level or ethnicity attached to it.

The coach didn&apos;t tell me if he&apos;d been coaching a team for the haves or the have-nots because none of that mattered.

What matters most is that we, as parents, provide our children with both a clear view of the world they are going to live in and the tools they will need to excel.

 UH, DID MARIA&apos;S MOTHER FORGET SOMETHING? 

 Published On 05-20-2011 , 9:27 PM 


There are many conversations mothers should have with their daughters, which causes me to be puzzled with the Maria Shriver story, because well-heeled husbands sleeping with the household help (or others) is one of those mother-daughter little chit-chats.
 This latest keep-it-going media frenzy is not really what we would call news in my community. 
White men like Maria&apos;s husband, Arnold, have been sleeping with the household worker women since back in slavery days, as my mother told her daughters in those conversations I was naíve enough to believe all mothers conducted.

A look at history takes us back to ancient times, when men of power took to the sheets with whomever they chose.

How come high-society Shriver missed, in her upper-class upbringing, what we who lived on the other side of life came to know as the way things were? Weren&apos;t there a few previous womanizing scandals in the Kennedy family - Maria&apos;s family?

Shriver isn&apos;t the only one on the upper-crust list who&apos;s had a husband fooling around with the help, and she isn&apos;t the only one with a hubby who fathered a child out of wedlock.

I heard from my mother that my great-great-grandmother, who was freed from slavery at the age of 12, grew up in the master&apos;s house because she was the master&apos;s child.

And what have I told my daughters? I keep my family&apos;s old-time stories alive. I am also able to include, in this oral tradition of ours, the stories that have emerged from the latter day slavery system: live-in household help.


While much hoopla is being made of Arnold&apos;s housekeeper-mistress and mother of his so-called secret son wanting to be Maria - wearing Maria&apos;s clothes, her jewelry and dressing her son like Maria dressed her son - again, this isn&apos;t news for those of us who know the backstory on the help.

Throughout my growing-up years, I overheard stories being discussed about live-ins my family knew trying to explain their way out of a caught-you situation when they forgot to take off whatever costume they were using for that day&apos;s fantasy while the Missus was away.

Many of the wealthy women in Maria&apos;s family and in their circle of friends most certainly came home on some occasion and found the help wearing a necklace, bracelet, earrings or maybe even fancy lingerie that wasn&apos;t theirs.

Masquerading as the Missus is not uncommon. Help has long identified with the family they work for, and quite often the status the help enjoys in their own community is derived solely from the status of their employer.

I&apos;m shocked to hear, from this current story of rich and powerful men doing what they&apos;ve done throughout the ages, that their wives are allegedly clueless regarding this historical practice.

Was Maria really clueless? Didn&apos;t her mother tell her any of the stories my mom told me?

Even if her mom said nothing, surely she was bright enough to make a few observations of her own about the philandering practices of the Kennedy men.

 THE MILLION MOM MARCH TO CHINO 

 Published On 05-06-2011 , 11:12 PM 


I&apos;ve got tears in my eyes! Not because of a touching Mother&apos;s Day card, or an elegantly wrapped gift, but then again, maybe that&apos;s what the burst of emotion is really all about.

Mother&apos;s Day gifts come in strange and different ways. I learned from my own mom, a long time ago, that the special day doesn&apos;t have much to do with shopping for stuff. I also learned to believe in sharing with others whatever quality of life I&apos;ve come to enjoy that others haven&apos;t had the same opportunity to experience.

It&apos;s the incarcerated mothers program run by Talk About Parenting with Shirlee Smith, our nonprofit organization, and the community&apos;s response to it that&apos;s keeping the tears flowing.

Last week I wrote about the project kicking off this weekend at California Institute for Women in Chino and made mention that the funding we&apos;d been promised had dried up.

Since then, we&apos;ve received checks, small and large, from so many of you. We&apos;ve received donations online and I&apos;ve teared-up every time I open an email.

Meta McCullough, long-time local community activist, telephoned to say she had set aside a small cash donation but didn&apos;t have transportation - could I pick it up?

We were told by state Sen. Carol Liu&apos;s aide, when it was determined her office wasn&apos;t going to fund the project that was a year in the making, that we should consider calling the women&apos;s prison to cancel.

But there are over 125 women at the prison on the wait list. The current class is at capacity level with 25 participants.

We should have cancelled? No funding being the reason?

No way.

My mother was a domestic, and growing up there were scores of stories about maids and rich ladies.

For instance: A rich lady asked Bertha, the maid, to come into her room, close her eyes and only open them when fingers snapped.

When Bertha opened up, Ms. Lady was modeling a full-length fancy fur coat.

&quot;Hm, Ms., where you get that?&quot;

&quot;I met a man with a million dollars.&quot;

Long about a month later, Bertha asked Ms. Lady back to the maid&apos;s room and asked that she close her eyes and await the finger snap.

When told to open, Ms. Lady exclaimed,&quot;Bertha! Where? How did you get that?&quot;

Bertha smiled, modeled to the left and then to the right, smiled again, and replied,&quot;I met a million men with a dollar.&quot;

Next time elections roll around and I&apos;m asked to mark my ballot for one of our trusted politicians, I&apos;m going to write in&quot;community partnerships&quot;- for it is truly the million men and women with the dollar who are delivering. It is the community that cares about the mothers behind the wall.

The overwhelming response and support has been a Mother&apos;s Day joy that I and the rest of our team will take to Chino.

This full year of development for a much-needed program for mothers has been a challenge well worth the experience of a lifetime - thanks to all of you for believing in what I do.

 MOTHERS SHOULDN&apos;T BE FORGOTTEN 

 Published On 04-30-2011 , 8:38 PM 

When we hear a mother say about visits to the prison from her kids,“I was overwhelmed wondering what I would say to them . . .my fear is being forgotten,”we know where our services belong.

Our non-profit organization, Talk About Parenting with Shirlee Smith, is headed inside the walls of California Institute for Women (CIW) in Chino where the inmate total is 2,597. While the facility doesn’t keep records on the number of those who are mothers, general statistics regarding women in prison say 80% of them are.

U.S. Department of Justice says female inmates have increased 843% in the last 3 decades. California’s female population is reported as the fastest growing in the nation.

With the assistance of California State Senator Carol Liu’s office, we’ve been working on our project for over a year

“Well, they’ve done the crime they’ve got to pay with time,“said one long time supporter of the parenting classes we’ve been doing on the outside.

From Pacific Palisades to South Central Los Angeles, I’ve spent ten years working with parents who have nannies raising their kids and also with those who can’t afford after school care to handle the hours between when the kids get home and when the adults return from work.

I’ve worked with foster parents and I’ve worked with those whose children are in the“system”who must attend classes in order to regain custody.

Another doubter of the benefit for mothers in prison learning something about communication skills, role modeling, safe home environments, helping children succeed and positive environmental influence, said the only thing a parolee was thinking about would be a place to live, food to eat and securing employment.

Gloria Barrios, a member of the our prison project team, a current California state certified rehabilitation counselor and former inmate at California Institute for Women, doesn’t think that’s quite the case and we’ve taken her word over the naysayer’s.

She knows the ropes; she served ten years on the first incarceration and later, as a parent, served two years and thought constantly of the 3 kids she’d left behind and how, if ever, she could make up the time lost.

Incarceration was one thing being single, she says, but it was a different story as a mother experiencing what she had deprived both she and her kids of.

Last summer, Barrios was back on the familiar“yard”with the senator&apos;s legislative aide, Randall Sampson, CIW Community Partnership Manager and myself as we paid the first visit to the site where we will kick off the six-week program starting Mother’s Day weekend.

But now we’ve encountered another kind of naysayer. Just when we’re all set to go, we&apos;ve learned funding isn&apos;t going to be available. With the state’s fiscal crisis, the prison system has been forced to cut hundreds of millions of dollars from education programs. Our budget is miniscule.

We’re going to the big house, anyway. We’re not going to forget the stories we’ve heard or the need we know exists because we also know that the betterment of mothers that of their children is at stake, here.

Maybe you, or some contact you have, agrees with us that mothers should not be fearful of being forgotten and one of the steps toward remembrance is being able to know what to say to your kid.

Talk About Parenting with Shirlee Smith is a non-profit charitable organization, donations are tax-deductible, and can be made through pay pal here on the website, or mailed to P.O. Box 40547, Pasadena, CA 91114.

 WHAT&apos;S A BLOGGER WITHOUT READERS? 

 Published On 04-17-2011 , 7:37 PM 


Without you, the readers, who provide me with your view, this would be a lonesome pursuit.

I have a policy of not using the next week to follow up on the topic of the previous week, even when a large number of responders want more of the same, which was the case when I wrote about little girls and push-up bras.

Most times the emails regarding subject matter stretch from adamant support of my opinion to those who declare I&apos;m a nut and say they&apos;re going to contact however many editors it takes, at the newspaper where this blog appears on the opinion page, to get me removed from the spotlight of appearing in the newspaper.

But when it came to making pre-teens sex objects, the views I received were 100 percent in my corner. The members of the general public were also outraged and made their views known, which caused the store selling the padded bras to change their marketing pitch.

No such luck with my whining about the increase in tickets being issued to drivers. No official word has been issued pertaining to letting motorists get by with even the slightest infraction.

One police officer took the time to ask me if I were suggesting he and the rest of the force not do their job. He further posed the question: Should the motorist driving a car with a broken tail light be allowed to continually operate a vehicle that is not in compliance? See his comment below.

Often readers simply use the form at the end of this blog to post their comments others send me emails and every one that comes my way is answered. No, there is not a staff person with an assignment of handling reader concerns.


For those who are surprised that the thank you for writing response is directly from me, I remind them that this is not the big time.

I do the work here. I also do the house and yard work at my home. I wash clothes, mop floors, pull weeds, pay the bills, grocery shop and all of the other on-going responsibilities.

The lady at the beauty shop, an avid follower of my words of wisdom, as the called them, remarked last week about my intelligence.

&quot;Not intelligence,&quot;I responded and explained my view to her of what she cited as intelligence.

The reason she hung onto every word, I said, was that what she read pretty much echoed what she thought - it&apos;s just she didn&apos;t have the opportunity to formulate her position and then have somewhere to express it.

Did she see any sense in that analysis?

She seemed to be taking a stab at digesting my suggestion and I&apos;m not sure how convinced she was, as it seems to me, a lot of people aren&apos;t too eager to share with the broader public that which they might express at the dinner table.

For me, anywhere I happen to be is the dinner table and I&apos;m thankful for such an opportunity. But again, the biggest thanks is to readers and in particular those who take the time to send their comments.

 CHRIS BROWN IS BAD NEWS 

 Published On 03-25-2011 , 11:09 PM 


Can&apos;t the media find a legitimate role model for our youth? Chris Brown, the baby-faced, tattoo-chested entertainer, is the latest inappropriate-behaving chump being crammed down our throats, if we&apos;re stupid enough to still watch the evening news - and, unfortunately, many of us do.

For the smart ones who&apos;ve missed this week&apos;s crazies, Brown, after an interview on&quot;Good Morning America,&quot;trashed the dressing room, broke out a window and ripped off his shirt.

Is this what we should be calling news?

He got mad as hell because he was asked by the show&apos;s co-host about beating up his ex-girlfriend, Rihanna, who, back when the incident happened, filed a domestic assault case against him.The interview went along calmly enough, with Brown dodging the question, like anyone has a right to do, continually repeating the seemingly rehearsed lines that were promoting his new album.

It was afterward in the dressing room that he went ballistic.

This kind of immature behavior should, first of all, not be tolerated in a civil society. But more importantly, there is no responsible explanation for the media continuing to parade this tragic example of a supposedly successful young man in front of our youth.

&quot;GMA&quot;interviewer Robin Roberts says Brown is welcome if he ever wants to return.

News reports also say the music industry people don&apos;t seem to think Brown&apos;s behavior will have any negative impact on his album sales. 


Such great rewards for such bad behavior.

Increased sales and a standing invitation on a network show makes one kinda wonder how much of the trashing of the room, breaking out the window and ripping off the shirt is actually related to&quot;letting off steam,&quot;as Brown later explained as the cause of it all.

Though he says he felt the interviewer was wrong to bring up his past troubles, Brown has now apologized and claims to be disappointed in his actions.

Think how many young people are marveling at this behavior that only a celebrity can pull off with no consequences.

Think how many young people already believe they can trash the classroom, curse out the teacher and keep on truckin&apos;.

There are members of the youth brigade who have kicked their foot through the door at home and now they&apos;ll be quick to say at least there was no shattered glass in the yard or on the street outside from a window they broke.

There ought to be constant media coverage about the young person who studied hard and finally got an A grade on the history exam after a semester of C&apos;s and D&apos;s.

Surely there&apos;s some young person who, against the odds, has applied to a prestigious university and been accepted.

I met a young man last week whose parents were migrant farm workers. He had a college degree and was directing his life toward even higher educational goals.

How, with such humble beginnings, could he cast his aspirations among the stars? He said his father always told him he could accomplish something great.

This role model for our youth isn&apos;t undressing down to his tattooed chest promoting a music album on the backs of young people who are gullible enough to believe he, Chris Brown, can lead the way.

 SOME KIDS GET BREAKS, OTHER KIDS GET BROKEN 

 Published On 03-18-2011 , 8:22 PM 


Los Angeles County Fifth District Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich keeps Brandi on her toes. What&apos;s a man of his importance got to do with some kid staying focused?

&quot;Hmmm,&quot;Brandi mused thoughtfully as we exited the Kenneth Hahn Hall of Administration in downtown Los Angeles and headed for the parking lot.

She&apos;s usually quite the chatterbox as long as the iPod isn&apos;t in her ear, but following this meeting with&quot;Uncle Mike,&quot;quiet prevailed.

When Brandi finally broke the silence, way after we were headed north on the Pasadena Freeway, she revealed the cause for the long and thoughtful interlude.

&quot;I&apos;m just really going to always do good. I have to do my best because everybody thinks I can - even Uncle Mike.&quot;

Then came the kicker:&quot;Every time I sit at his long table and he talks to me about how I&apos;m doing I think he cares because he could be doing something else.&quot;

Have you mentored a kid lately? It&apos;s surprising the kind of difference it makes when there&apos;s an adult - other than the regular family folk - who take an interest.

Brandi met the supervisor at the lighting of Christmas Tree Lane way back when she was in pre-school.

He picked her up, held on tight and they did the count together for several years. A busy man, he managed to attend her pre-school graduation and an art exhibit she had at the Flintridge Foundation.

And on a regular basis Brandi, the former foster kid who has now aged out of the system, meets with the supervisor in his conference room.

The 9-year-old we know took his scooter apart and couldn&apos;t figure how to put it back together. His uncle, real uncle, is an auto mechanic but said he didn&apos;t have time to help his nephew.

The kid wanted to hang out and watch this relative work on cars in his back yard but it was a no-go.

&quot;Kids today,&quot;complained Uncle,&quot;ain&apos;t `bout nothin&apos;, they just wanna hang around and get in the way asking dumb kinda stuff. Shouldna took that scooter apart, anyway. It ain&apos;t even that hard to put back together.&quot;

This was a harsh approach, seemed to me, but Uncle said I didn&apos;t know the whole story about his trouble-making nephew - just a no-good kid! Ouch! A 9-year-old is not a no-good kid. But if the rest of the family is anything like Uncle, they sure know how to create a no-gooder.

Some kids get the breaks, and other kids get broken.

But it doesn&apos;t have to be that way. We all need to make time to meet with a kid at our long conference table, backyard mechanic shop, kitchen stove or wherever we can share some care.

For many of Brandi&apos;s younger years she really thought the lights on Christmas Tree Lane, here in Altadena, were partially the results of her brilliance. For all of Brandi&apos;s older years and for years to come, she will know that somebody who didn&apos;t really have to cared about her progress in life.

Now, if there&apos;s a backyard mechanic anywhere out there reading this column, I know a 9-year-old boy who needs some fixing, as does his shiny silver scooter.

 TEACHING KIDS MONEY MATTERS 

 Published On 03-12-2011 , 9:28 AM 


The kid saw the incident as someone stealing her tennis shoes that she left on top of the lockers. Her mother saw it quite another way. The young lady had to purchase replacement shoes for having, as her mom called it, lost the shoes.

Carelessness with one&apos;s possessions means that, in this family, the household budget isn&apos;t going to foot the bill for the kid not taking care of her belongings.

A harsh way to raise a kid or a practical avenue for developing responsibility, you may ask? Maybe it&apos;s one in the same thing because responsibility doesn&apos;t come easy and when it comes to helping our offspring get a handle on matters of money, harsh lessons become winners.

How much should a parent dole out for high grades on the school report card? Which chores around the house earn the biggest bucks?

Too many parents really believe they should pay their kids to do what is required of them. The good grade is the pay-off for doing good school work. The biggest chores around the house are done by parents, 24-7, in their quest to raise decent kids and their pay-off doesn&apos;t come in dinero but instead they will eventually see their offspring become responsible adults.

Maybe it&apos;s our American culture that dictates life being measured by the dollar and this being the tool, then we think the only way to appreciate our kids is to heap money on them which all too often we don&apos;t really have.

&quot;Shopping? but she just went shopping last weekend and the weekend before that,&quot;exclaimed the aunt who was now caretaker of her teenage niece.

&quot;But that&apos;s what she does every weekend,&quot;explained the daughter, but also cousin to the shopaholic who now lived with the family.

Daughter, thinking she had now entered into a new lifestyle, was ready for the mall excursion until the longtime family rule surfaced and the new household member heard: No shopping unless a budget was presented, approved and a need for the item was fully demonstrated.

Call it Operation Crazy Parents if you choose, but talking recently with Tim Mayworm, executive director of Journey House, a place where foster youth who are no longer in the system can get a handle on life, this crazy stuff would be a good thing to spread everywhere.

Mayworm described conversations with young people who didn&apos;t understand why they would need to return to work after receiving their paycheck and what was the purpose of not spending all of the money in one day.

Mayworm&apos;s charges have had absolutely no growing up life experiences when it comes to money and it is unforgivable the foster and kinship care system has allowed this to happen.

And kids in our society who have parents dumping money in their direction without attaching a responsibility component may be only a few steps ahead of our young adults the child welfare system has created.

The country&apos;s economic downturn, something too many parents are pretending doesn&apos;t exist, may eventually make paying for chores and getting good grades a budget cut whether the kids approve of it or not.

 WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BLACK TIGER MOMS? 

 Published On 02-25-2011 , 10:23 PM 


Here&apos;s a thumbs-up for Amy Chua, still stirring up controversy with her book,&quot;Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother,&quot;which lays out what too many are calling a mean-streak way of raising kids.

So count this as a last-minute contribution to Black History Month, which in a few days will fade into March, which celebrates Women&apos;s History. One of the many people who stop me in parking lots, supermarkets, the library or elsewhere to talk about my perspective on raising kids wanted to know why I hadn&apos;t devoted space in February, the month devoted to us.

What&apos;s the Tiger Mom&apos;s style of forcing children into excellence got to do with black history? The quest for excellence in raising our offspring isn&apos;t limited to a specific culture, but some minorities in America have been acutely aware of the consequences for anything less.

Apparently forgotten by many of today&apos;s foolish black parents is the rule we old-timers were raised on: If you&apos;re black, you&apos;ve got to get up earlier, stay up later and do the job - whatever it is -a whole lot better.

We may not have been forced into ballet, violin or piano lessons, as Chua did with her daughters, but black children were continually drilled on the importance of respect, obedience and the reasoning of being seen and not heard. Education was to be the cornerstone of our progress.

It was not our parents&apos; understanding that future generations would become the reason the prison system is our country&apos;s fastest-growing industry - and in economic hard times.

What ever happened to the harsh realities of life under our own black Tiger Moms? No whining. No excuses. No&quot;teacher didn&apos;t like me so I have a bad grade.&quot;No sleepovers. No talking back. Like Chua&apos;s daughters, in later years, there was to be no TV, computer games or other distractions from schoolwork.

Our parents didn&apos;t necessarily think we would be the conductor of the symphony or the local pharmacist, veterinarian, pediatrician or dentist, but they drilled the importance of doing our best. Chua bypasses doing one&apos;s best and goes all out for excellence.

Mr. Moulton, our next-door neighbor in Los Angeles on West 36th Street, was a postal employee. Two doors down lived LaMar Hill, a student at USC whose parents owned the local mortuary. Across the street lived Juliet Ball, who had small roles in Hollywood movies. We lived around the corner from legendary tap dancer Bill&quot;Bojangles&quot;Robinson and we lived downstairs from Harvey Brooks who was a jazz pianist.

Our neighbors worked hard at whatever they did and they helped the children in the neighborhood get the message - hard work is what we were expected to do.

My black history shows me that something has drastically changed for the worse, and it isn&apos;t because of white folks, discrimination or racism.

We&apos;ve lost our Tiger Moms to a society we&apos;ve let convince us to obey our offspring, not set rules, spend more money buying Chinese hair than books for our kids and spend more time finding a new boyfriend than visiting the school. We&apos;ve gone far beyond&quot;no sleepovers&quot;and changed the face of that activity to allowing the boyfriend or the girlfriend to come on over and sleep in our teenager&apos;s bed.

Black History Month? The true celebration is yet to come.

 FINANCING HIGHER EDUCATION 

 Published On 02-11-2011 , 8:29 PM 


The Pasadena City College Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid will be holding what they call,&quot;Financial Aid Saturday,&quot;today from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. on the campus located at 1570 E. Colorado Blvd., in the L Building, Room 114.

Kim Miles, assistant dean of Financial Aid and Scholarships Services, says attendees will have access to financial aid staff who will assist them with applications and in obtaining information about financial aid programs at a variety of universities and colleges.

Is this the opportunity, as the saying goes, of a lifetime? Some would agree because they recognize their inability to know all of the negotiations that it takes to successfully make it through the college maze.

And there is no embarking on a higher educational pursuit without the money to pay for it.

The folks who know this without a doubt will show up at Room 114 long before the door actually opens. These are the folk, parents with their kids in tow, who haven&apos;t missed educational opportunities in the years prior to applying for college.

Then there&apos;s the&quot;others.&quot;Probably the very people for which this event was planned because over the years, while they claim to seek higher learning, they never seem to follow the process for getting there.

Deadline for filing applications? Yo, what&apos;s up with that? Birth certificate. Last year&apos;s income tax return. Proof of residence. Transcripts. Oh, uh!

Last year, PCC distributed over $28 million in financial aid through work-study, grants, loans fee waivers and scholarships.

Today, the professionals will be there to answer questions about the Board of Governors fee waivers, enrolling at PCC, and inquiries about federal, state and local aid.

Parents and students shouldn&apos;t miss this opportunity to learn all about finances for higher learning whether through one-on-one questions or by attending a workshop.

Hey, why not try both of these approaches.

Oh, it&apos;s Saturday and Jerome, the son, likes to sleep late and, geez, Dad&apos;s been working all week so they won&apos;t be taking in this financial aid session ...

But then there&apos;s that family, Mom, Dad and the two high school kids who are first in line at Room 114, seem to never sleep late or miss any educational opportunities.

Later in life, some years down the academic road, families like Jerome&apos;s will call the Mom, Dad and the used-to-be high school students really, really lucky because they&apos;ve achieved so much.

Achievement isn&apos;t luck; it&apos;s a lot of hard work and a whole lot of getting up early even if it&apos;s on a Saturday morning.

Kim Miles and her staff are looking for you. And the event will continue until 1 p.m. today, even if you don&apos;t arrive bright and early at Room 114.

Kim Miles and her staff are looking for me and my kid who is in her second year at the college. Will we be lined up in front of Room 114? Uh, my student said,&quot;Me and my friend have our own plans for hanging out this Saturday.&quot;

Some kids just don&apos;t get it. But should their parents let them get away with being stupid?

 LIFE IN THE &apos;HOOD 

 Published On 01-29-2011 , 1:14 AM 


&quot;They didn&apos;t do a very good job when they put in a fence for me, but the guys need the work. I wouldn&apos;t think of complaining because when I look at it, I&apos;m a whole lot better off than before they came,&quot;said one of the locals I spoke with who wasn&apos;t really satisfied with the work provided by the Alta Pasa Community Improvement Center.

Susie Nemer, deputy for Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael Antonovich, Fifth District, seemed surprised when I asked who provided oversight for the agency and handled complaints.

She said the center doesn&apos;t get many of those and added that most of the work they do is standard and routine - like providing handicap ramps.

&quot;Oh, please tell me you didn&apos;t really give a complaint to the supervisor&apos;s office!&quot;another resident dissatisfied with the fix-it program exclaimed after she&apos;d told me why&quot;our&quot;people know better than to speak out.

&quot;There&apos;s payback,&quot;she said, and wanted to know where I grew up since I didn&apos;t understand the workings of the `hood.
 &quot;Retaliation ain&apos;t no joke,&quot;was the way someone else phrased it and wanted to know exactly what fool would bite the hand that fed them. 
I talked to lots of folks who&apos;d been serviced by Director Ron Matthew&apos;s Alta Pasa agency who behave in a manner I suspect he&apos;s become accustomed to.

But when my kid wants to know how come people can break down our back gate, come on the property and stomp down shrubs we&apos;ve grown for long before her lifetime, hack off the tree that shielded our home from miscreants hanging out in the alley behind us, what&apos;s a parent supposed to say?

In the past, I guess I&apos;ve been guilty of taking the route others in the `hood have taken. I even provided a glowing five-star evaluation of the agency&apos;s work that later crumbled just about a week after the ink dried on my signature.

Yes, I let the supervisor&apos;s office know that the program that Los Angeles County funds sent workers onto my property without a walk-through with me, without my signature for the work we had talked about being done. The most horrifying part is it all happened without me being home.

&quot;You don&apos;t have the power,&quot;said another `hood dweller.

Generation after generation, we pass onto our children the image of being powerless, of wrongdoing being just the way things are. We don&apos;t call a spade a spade because they are usually people of color that we are outing.&quot;They are so-called friends who we&apos;ll see in church next Sunday or in the supermarket on Monday.

It&apos;s apparently OK to whisper back and forth, though. It&apos;s OK to exchange horror stories on the grapevine. But it&apos;s not OK when you live in my community to speak up for what&apos;s right and to speak against what&apos;s wrong if it pertains to a person of color.

How did the drug dealers and the gang bangers take over the `hood? Way back when, didn&apos;t anyone see something going wrong?

My kid&apos;s not out in her back yard anymore because we live on an alley and are, now, the only house on the block without privacy. Should I support her being conditioned to believe this is just how things are?

Or shouldn&apos;t this agency be made to measure up and provide the kind of respect, excellence, professionalism and service it undoubtedly convinced its funding agency it was capable of delivering&quot;.

 WINNING FRIENDS? 

 Published On 01-22-2011 , 1:59 PM 


Dale Carnegie and his influential best-selling masterpiece,&quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People&quot;was often quoted back in the days when I grew up.

Norman Vincent Peale was another notable author whose viewpoints,&quot;The Power of Positive Thinking,&quot;got bantered around by the elders in my family.

But my way of seeing life, for many in my family was, and still is, a source of confusion.

Carnegie, my parents always reminded me when I was as a teenager, stressed the value of no criticism, condemnation or complaints.

Fine and dandy for getting along with friends, but what, I wanted to know, was how this philosophy worked in regard to the girls vice principal sending our school&apos;s Girls League vice president to the conference in Palm Springs instead of me, the president?

My mother always explained things in a kind and very gentle way, but all too often in cases like this, her message was simple: The problem was with me.

There was something in my growing years about smiling. Smiles will win every time, mom lectured, and in the case of the Palm Springs conference, Mom harped on the sweet, accommodating smile and pleasant personality of Rachel Duran, the officer under me in the Girls League.

I didn&apos;t smile then and I don&apos;t smile that much now. Yes, back then, like now, I have complaints, condemnation and criticism.

My family members said I was sullen, questioning and entirely too direct. They tried with a variety of discreet social-interaction techniques to help me through my troublesome way of life - but without much success.

When readers send an e-mail chewing me out for a position I&apos;ve taken, it&apos;s like my response when my mom explained to me the valid reasons the girls VP had for selecting Rachel instead of me.

I did and I do stand by my positions.

But like the great philosophers, Carnegie and Peale, who had so much influence in the lives of my elders, I&apos;m a strong supporter in the belief in listening to the other person&apos;s point of view - I respect that.

For all of the readers, and there were plenty, who wrote last week saying I should not have taken the Tucson shooter Jared Loughner&apos;s parents to task for his actions, I certainly agree that as parents we are not responsible for the actions of our adult children.

However, as parents, we should - that doesn&apos;t mean that we do - have the ability to observe our child&apos;s behavior and in some way spot characteristics that just don&apos;t fit the scale of normalcy. And that&apos;s what I said.

One e-mail suggested kids have a way of hiding who they actually are. Really? In the case of the shooter, for 22 years?

&quot;Don&apos;t be so quick to judge,&quot;another writer said and went on to discuss the difficulties of detecting a child&apos;s mental health symptoms.

I neglected to smile on this one, but I did understand his point of view - he didn&apos;t know who he was writing to. As a mother of a child who went through a mental health crisis as a teenager and the mother of a foster child who carries a stiff diagnosis, when I write about responsibility of observing and knowing our children, I don&apos;t write to win friends - maybe I&apos;ll influence a few people - maybe.

 LOOKING BACK 

 Published On 01-01-2011 , 11:25 PM 


RINGING in the new year with resolutions, promises and an eye to the future seems the way to go, according to how this day has been organized in the past.

&quot;Don&apos;t look back,&quot;a New Year&apos;s Eve party reveler once told me back during my teenage years.

Why not, when both the best and worst of 2010 have a lot of influence on 2011? Without taking stock of what Father Time brought about, how&apos;s a future plan supposed to get developed?

The best of 2010? School districts began removing soda machines from school campuses. I remember the day when I first spotted the monster machine on the Pasadena High School campus and later asked my daughter what all it housed.

&quot;Oh, no,&quot;she responded with a voice filled with annoyance and then went on to exclaim&quot;You&apos;re not going to complain about that are you?&quot;Anyway, hooray for whomever got that movement going.

The best of 2010? Dr. Hugh Chee, a fabulous children&apos;s dentist, who recently filled two cavities for my daughter, Brandi, while explaining the entire process as he worked.

While we&apos;ve heard an apple a day is said to keep the doctor away, Brandi&apos;s adding to that by finding that drinking sodas every day sends your teeth to the dentist, where you&apos;re gonna have to pay.

A movie theater with reclining chairs, blankets, pillows and food service? That is a bit on the upscale side for my usual way of movie watching at the two-buck Academy Theater on Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena. Well, that&apos;s the matinee price; please add another buck for showtime after 6 p.m.

So for the best of 2010, the Academy is there for providing movies everyone can afford and free parking to boot. But I must say that also on the best list is the Gold Class Cinema in Old Pasadena - expensive, yes, but worth every dollar spent. A real treat, with comfort, excellent service and great food.

Looking back, my 2010 was filled with lessons learned. And I might as well let it be known that the party reveler who suggested I never do this was an ex-boyfriend who had dumped me for the cutie he was spending that New Year&apos;s Eve with.

&quot;Consider the source,&quot;Mrs. Wilson, my mother&apos;s good friend, always warned. While the strategy behind&quot;never look back&quot;was, I believe, really meant for the young man&apos;s safety while at a party in the unexpected company of a dumped, angry and hostile black girl, his words have stuck with me through time.

It was good enough that the young man had a bad time constantly looking over his shoulder - looking back - making sure Ms. Hostile was going about her business.

Maybe everyone looks back.

My best of 2010 has a lot to do with my 2011: No soda machines on school campuses; Dr. Chee continuing to provide patients with the good service kids need from their dentist; Brandi remembering a soda a day can create cavities; the Academy keeping its commitment to provide movies at a low price and the Gold Class being there when it&apos;s time, and my budget allows, for a special treat.

No worst of 2010 to be mentioned here, even though great lessons were learned from them, too.

 HOME ALONE FOR CHRISTMAS 

 Published On 12-25-2010 , 2:22 AM 


MY father was a waiter and for many years served patrons at a very upscale, elite Beverly Hills restaurant.

We didn&apos;t get to see much of him on Christmas Day because he spent most of the morning sleeping due to coming home late after the Christmas Eve night shift.

When he did awaken, he showered, shaved, slicked down his kinky hair, put on his fancy black pants with the satin stripe down the sides, his pleated-down-the-front white shirt and then his satin cummerbund with the small horizontal folds in it. Of course he also put on his highly polished black shoes.

He was ready for his gig and didn&apos;t have much time to check out the presents his kids had opened.

Christmas at our house was a high-priority work day due, in part, to the extra pay being offered to those in the servant class who were willing to give up their own holiday in order to make it better for people who had the money to pay for service.

My mother was a domestic and worked for the Whitneys, a wealthy family who lived in the San Fernando Valley. She, with my grandmother, was expected to cook the Christmas feast, serve the family and then clean up. Year after year, they followed this routine, which included packing up the leftovers from the dinner and bringing them back home to our side of the tracks.

Back in those days, the restaurants allowed workers to take the leftover food, so Dad brought home some high-quality dinner as well.

Most of my younger years, my older sister and I spent Christmas alone waiting for our parents to return.

Sometime we were at the Whitney house, holed up in the maid&apos;s room after collecting a wagon-load of too many presents they had for us from under their giant tree. We would have preferred our small house, small tree and our parents there rather than somewhere working.

Ungrateful? Maybe. But the Whitneys proved to be just as ungrateful for the years we gave them our mother. Because once my sister and I became older and bold enough to let my mother know how much we&apos;d appreciate having her home for Christmas, they were indignant when she gave up the pay to stay home with her children.

Of course Mom said she thought, like so many parents do, that the extra money earned on these Christmas forays would be more important, based on the reasoning of what she could buy us.

Now, Dad&apos;s check and his tips were another story; the rent had to be paid and he was the main breadwinner.

There are probably some current-day youngsters whose parents aren&apos;t with them on this holiday because of an opportunity to earn money for rent, food and maybe some presents at the after-Christmas sales.

Times are tough and tough decisions have to be made. Parents, please remember to help your children understand that the time will come when you&apos;ll be there with them, but for now life isn&apos;t exactly what the storybooks say.

But if you&apos;re gathering the extra pay just to buy them the latest electronic gadget or a pair of fancy fashion boots, from my perspective, I say your kids would rather have you than what that money can buy.

 MASON HOLLAND ISN&apos;T ALONE IN SLAMS TO THE MAT 

 Published On 12-18-2010 , 7:31 AM 


I&apos;M told just about everybody&apos;s been reading the story and watching the video of Mason Holland, the basketball player at DeSoto County High in Arcadia, Fla., who was called for a technical after pushing an opposing player as they ran up the floor and then confronts the referee as well, pushing him and tossing him to the floor.

Holland got suspended from his team and from school. But I suspect this isn&apos;t his first display of a need for anger-management therapy.

Well, here&apos;s another hard to believe story that&apos;s not on YouTube or making headlines anywhere.

While this one isn&apos;t about anger management it is human frailties that should be addressed, in part, because we rely on school officials to do the right thing.

This story is started with a report of sexting and seems to have ended without a resolution for the rumors spread. It&apos;s a long and detailed set of circumstance, however, it&apos;s my job to make it short by leaving out the juicy details.

It all began with a telephone call to Ms. Mom from by the principal of the high school her daughter attends. Mom was told that the secretary from a local elementary school had called this principal saying mom&apos;s daughter was sending nude pictures to boys. The principal asked, after Mom said she didn&apos;t believe this had happened, to go through the daughter&apos;s phone to view the evidence.
 So the principal had never seen the pictures and was only relying on what she&apos;d been told. 
Where I come from we call this several things. The printable one is&quot;He said, she said, you did!&quot;School officials should not be caught up in this kind of stuff with a principal of a high school relying solely on the word of someone&apos;s unverified report and then alarming a parent.

Unlike the spontaneous suspension of Holland from his team and his school, no action was taken on this gossip stuff, which happened in October and was reported to Pasadena schools administrators.

While the gossip surrounding the girl, the boy, the texting, the secretary who started the nonsense, the principal who might have investigated the story before she called Mom, and the more intriguing characters who emerged as integral links to the episode, may not seem the equivalent of a body slam, Mom thinks differently.

While conducting her own investigation into these unsavory and unproven allegations against her daughter, Mom says she was told her actions were harassment - a body slam, indeed.

While the man at school district headquarters who is in charge of this kind of stuff has allegedly been doing an investigation, Mom hasn&apos;t heard a peep from him.

Mason Holland got what he deserved for his actions on the basketball court. But he should have been receiving help for his mental disability along with the basketball coaching he was getting for his physical abilities.

Neither Mom nor her daughter have gotten from our school district what they deserve, which is that respect parents ought to have when they expect to have official intervention with matters involving their children.

Principals and secretaries can, of course, be guilty of behaving in an unprofessional manner - should their behavior be ignored? Parents can go overboard when their child has been wrongly accused, but shouldn&apos;t school officials do the investigating, get the straight story and report that to the parent?

Names have been withheld, as this story isn&apos;t about the individuals. Instead it is about the way a school district allows such stuff to happen without addressing the problem.

Yeah, I think Mom got body-slammed, but the story isn&apos;t new - it&apos;s just one more parent on the mat.

 THE SPIRIT OF THE SEASON 

 Published On 12-10-2010 , 10:33 PM 


I got called the Grinch because of questioning the good of dreaming of a white Christmas and for suggesting Rudolph&apos;s sleigh mates were bullies.

I also was on record stating my annoyance with the parent of the kid who after opening all of his presents went to bed crying because the gadget he&apos;d requested wasn&apos;t under the tree.

I&apos;m as much a supporter of the season as anyone else. Well, maybe I should say that with some amount of moderation. At my age, I ought to be allowed a decent amount of withdrawal since I no longer have young children to provide for.

Didn&apos;t I hear somewhere, over the years, that Christmas is really for the kids? I followed that line and decked our halls with boughs of holly, strung lights on the tree and snuck wrapped presents from their hiding place late on Christmas Eve for what seems like a hundred years.

Presents for the kids consisted of clothes I made for the Barbie dolls. A Mary Poppins doll made from a McCall pattern. A felt cowboy hat and a vest with too much fringe is another fond memory of Christmas past.

Baking even happened in my now unused kitchen. Remember the old term from scratch? Yup, made cookies from scratch; flour, baking powder, sugar, eggs, butter and probably some other ingredients that haven&apos;t found a place in my cupboard since the Pillsbury Dough Boy took over.

One of the comments I received, which carried with it a distinct air of annoyance, suggested leave the kids alone and allow them to enjoy the spirit of the times.

One cannot be an opinion writer and take offense at how readers interpret the printed word, and so my reply was polite, to the point and firm:&quot;Sir, you are so correct, but nowadays are we sure kids have the slightest clue about the spirit?&quot;

It is&quot;give me, give me&quot;all year long. It is&quot;I want this and I want that,&quot;all year long. And somewhere in the 12 months preceding the big day that&apos;s supposed to be all about the spirit, our over-indulged offspring have collected more than the law should allow.

The economy is wreaking havoc on lives. Jobs have been lost. Unemployment checks aren&apos;t measuring up to the amount of the job pay. Homes have been foreclosed upon and living with relatives or friends is hard for all involved.

But still I hear parents worry about what to give the kids. I hear them talk about Christmas past and how their tree was loaded with just about every kiddie trinket one could imagine - not to mention the stylish clothes for the teenagers wrapped up in boxes from high-end retail stores.

The Grinch? Maybe just a woman with a very different lifestyle. For years, I lived on a welfare budget and our Christmas reflected the monthly income. I had no trouble sharing with my children the limits of our monetary existence and they are no worse off because of this.

At my home, sometime there are presents and sometime we get along just fine enjoying the spirit of being together.

 I DON&apos;T KNOW WHAT I&apos;M SINGING ABOUT 

 Published On 12-04-2010 , 12:42 AM 


THE sounds of KOST, the self-proclaimed official holiday radio station, which seems to be playing every Christmas song ever recorded, has the music of the holidays flooding every room in our home.

While it&apos;s nice to have holiday surround-sound, the constant hearing of the same old tunes has put me to thinking about what I&apos;ve been humming all these years in a mood of total acceptance, as if it were a good thing.

I&apos;m thinking now that Bing Crosby&apos;s crooning of&quot;White Christmas&quot;actually imposed the wrong tone for those of us who grew up in sun-filled Southern California.

Los Angeles had no snowfall for holiday winter sleigh rides. As kids, we didn&apos;t really know what snow was until many of our parents herded us onto buses run by a company called Asbury Rapid Transit to take us to see and experience the white stuff.

Back then, I really wanted to dream along with Bing about Christmas being white. It wasn&apos;t until last week, when Brandi and I were sitting around the living room heater in socks, slippers, longjohns, robe, fur hats and tight-fitting warm gloves, trying hard to make each other understand the meaning of 37 degrees, that I realized Christmas being white was nothing to sing about.

Brandi has a beautiful voice. I hum because, well, I just hum. She was singling along with Bing until I interrupted at the point of&quot;and children listen.&quot;

Forget the cold of a white Christmas vs. our warmer holiday - as an old lady, the song now had a more meaningful message.

If a cold white Christmas had children&quot;listening&quot;when I know they never do, then that kind of winter temp was definitely well worth its low degrees.

&quot;Where the treetops glisten, and children listen, to hear sleigh bells in the snow ...&quot;

Brandi repeated and completed the phrase. It seldom pays to cut people off mid-sentence, or, in this case, prior to the completion of the lyrics.


A very wrong understanding on my part!


I still had Rudolph to dissect. While he with his red nose was not around when I grew up, in later years, his antics were a big hit for my kids.

But now with the current focus on bullying, these lyrics are a ripe example of what we&apos;re supposed to be teaching our kids to rise above.

This thing about the other reindeer laughing and calling him names until Santa needed him, after which the other unkind reindeer just loved him, puts a kink in our lecture against bullying. In this tune, we joyously laud four-legged creatures exhibiting the behavior we&apos;re working to correct.

&quot;Think about this example we&apos;re presenting to our children,&quot;I said to another daughter, Phoenix.

But she, like Brandi, didn&apos;t agree with my point. Phoenix reminded me that the animals had nothing to do with how they were portrayed. Then with a laugh she questioned my ability to separate fact from fiction.

Maybe it&apos;s time to either turn off the Christmas tune station or simply listen, hum along and stop seeing an underlying issue in every song.

 CASH: NO CHANCE TO SHOP BEYOND OUR MEANS 

 Published On 11-26-2010 , 8:09 PM 


Now that Black Friday has officially kicked off Christmas shopping, maybe as parents it&apos;s time to not just examine our budgets when it comes to spending, but to also make a careful examination of our relationship to this practice of giving gifts and what gifts we ought to bestow upon our offspring.

My friend from Terry, Miss. remembered getting a fresh red apple as her one and only gift one year when finances weren&apos;t going well for her family.

That story happened back in 1940 when our parents weren&apos;t ashamed of what it was they had to offer children.

You get what you get, seemed pretty much the philosophy of growing up back then, and tagged on to that way of thinking was an unmentioned truth - and you best be grateful for whatever.

One recent Christmas morning, a friend called for some quick advice regarding a troublesome situation that was unfolding.

Her son had unwrapped his many presents from under the tree but put each one aside as he dug for the next. Having opened them all, not finding the electronic gadget he had announced to everyone that he wanted, he stormed to his bedroom in tears.

&quot;What&apos;s a mom to do?&quot;she pondered and then, foolishly, decided I would have the magic answer as to where she could dash out and find what store wasn&apos;t sold out so she could go buy it before he emerged from his bedroom.

Did she realize just whom she was calling? I think in her desperation she simply was calling anyone who might know where the elusive treasure might be hiding.

A puzzled sounding&quot;Oh,&quot;emitted from her end of the phone when I exclaimed perhaps the ungrateful kid&apos;s unwanted gifts should be re-wrapped and taken to a homeless shelter for families.

What to buy the children for Christmas? There&apos;s no one philosophy that fits all unless, perhaps, it&apos;s that practical bit of wisdom that gets thrown about:&quot;To thine own self be true.&quot;

However, the trouble with this is we&apos;ve lost sight of self. When it comes to gifts for the kids, it&apos;s pretty much about what they&apos;re demanding.

My friend&apos;s parents down in Mississippi may well have been the last of the Mohicans being true to their circumstances.

For a lot of families, life, nowadays, is a jolt back to the past of shopping with cash - and there isn&apos;t much of that. Credit cards have been maxed out or cancelled so there&apos;s no chance, as I hear from parents, of actually shopping beyond one&apos;s means.

This economic downturn just might be the chance for parents to level with the kids by teaching them some important truths about money, credit, gifts, advertisers and keeping up with Roberto, Jamal and John.

While an apple probably didn&apos;t give my friend Christmas gift bragging rights, it seemingly gave her, as I listened, an ability to understand love and caring isn&apos;t measured by bows, wrappings or what&apos;s in the package.

 STUDENTS WHO CAN&apos;T READ, KIDS WHO DIE 

 Published On 11-19-2010 , 8:17 PM 


Why, many local folks ask, haven&apos;t I addressed the issue of school closures in the Pasadena Unified School District? This is pretty much the same kind of inquiry that comes my way about the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services.

&quot;You can get a clear picture and scope of the budget problem if you make an appointment and talk with Superintendent Diaz,&quot;a local inquirer suggested when I tried diplomacy in getting out of his attempted conversation about school closures.

Why do I compare Pasadena schools to Children and Family Services? To put it simply, I see them both as questionable institutions run by people who collect paychecks but who don&apos;t seem to understand their mission and responsibility to the children in their charge.

Some time ago I called into a local television show on which Superintendent Edwin Diaz and Tom Selinske, the board president at the time, were guests. I called them crooks and was, of course, disconnected.

I would relish the opportunity to give my opinion on school closures, rising test scores, newly initiated immersion programs, budget issues, teacher evaluations and whatever else the district throws at the public to help justify the issuance of their salaries - but why bother?

Like tackling the problems surrounding children in out-of-home placement who are managed by a cadre of social and mental-health workers and who are being raised by non-caring, incompetent relatives or foster parents, there is no collection of thoughts or words to address this problem, either.

I have spent close to 40 years writing about children not being educated. I have spent that same amount of time writing about children dying while under the supervision of Los Angeles County&apos;s so-called protective services.

But the public isn&apos;t anymore ready to call the leaders of our school district the crooks that they are, any more than the host of that television show was ready to delve into the accusation. And the same can be said about foster care.

I haven&apos;t the power to bring the crooks to justice and the truth of the matter produces the fact that the power in my pen doesn&apos;t do much to convince readers that we have children - victims who need justice - so there&apos;s no real reason to keep writing the same thing for 40 years.

It&apos;s been suggested that I have turned a deaf ear because my latest kid is no longer a PUSD student and she has become of age to be emancipated from the foster-care system.

What&apos;s a writer to do? Since I write because I have something to say I can&apos;t do that when I&apos;m at a loss for words.

Students who can&apos;t read, no matter what spin the school district tries to sell the public on, and children who die while under the protection of Los Angeles County, no matter the follow-up investigation, suffer at the hands of those in charge.

 WACKY OR WISE? YOU TELL ME 

 Published On 11-13-2010 , 1:16 AM 


WHILE some readers may think I&apos;m pretty wacky, I suspect there&apos;s many who support my get-tough parenting philosophy who may not be willing to nod in agreement and most certainly aren&apos;t willing to lose their home-grown popularity by initiating any of my standards.

On&quot;The Mother Love Show,&quot;coming up next Tuesday, Nov. 16 from 2-3 p.m. at www.latalkradio.com , I&apos;ll be talking tough and saying that parents are the problem, not the kids. I&apos;m inviting all of you to call in to 323-203-0815 and put me in my place.

My fifth-grade teacher thought I should see my place as behaving like my congenial, likeable and effervescent older sister Beverly Pickett.

Beverly smiled. I growled. My older sister always seemed to say what people were happy to hear. If you&apos;re a reader of this column, you know that I&apos;ve not been blessed with that ability.

Until her dying day, just over a year ago, Beverly was trying to help me overcome my affliction of telling it like I see it.

My malady has been with me since childhood. And way back since Mrs. Warren, my 5th-grade teacher at 37th Street elementary school in Los Angeles, told me I was going to have a hard way in life, it seems I&apos;ve been desperately trying to fulfill her prophecy.

Mrs. Warren did offer me a way out. She said life would get better as I grew older and changed.


I may have changed, but just a little bit, and only for a little while until I got married and then had six children and then became a single parent.

Talking tough and being tough came with the territory - it was them or me. When one of mine pronounced I wasn&apos;t being fair, I could only answer back by saying,&quot;Life&apos;s not fair and growing up is supposed to prepare you for being a grown-up.&quot;

When they wanted to challenge my authority, and of course they always did, I simply asked how old they were and then asked them to tell me how old I was. In my house, age trumps.

A time-out? What a treat that would have been. Instead of a time-out there was always a job needing to be done. Maybe it was a floor to be mopped or the yard to be raked. In my house, it was called time in the trenches.

Are parents ready for what I have to say? Yes and no. I&apos;ve learned from listening to parents in my workshops over the last 16 years that the adults pretty much enjoy telling their disaster stories that need fixing, but don&apos;t really want to spend the fix-it energy.

I&apos;ve launched a public crusade to be everywhere I can, seeing how close I can come to making my fifth-grade teacher&apos;s prediction become a fact by continually putting parents on notice that they ought to be in jail and not their malfunctioning offspring. I suspect life is going to get as hard for me as Mrs. Warren said it would when callers start putting me in my place on the Mother Love broadcast.

 HEY MAMA, TRY SHOOTING FROM THE HIP 

 Published On 10-22-2010 , 8:00 PM 


LAST week I received a group e-mail with a subject line heralding&quot;need advice from family elders.&quot;Being the eldest of the family elders, I sprang to attention, ready to address the need.

It seems the 12-year-old great-niece was overheard mumbling, under her breath, out of earshot, she thought, calling her mom the&quot;B&quot;word.

She&apos;d just celebrated at a big-time splashy birthday party and sometime thereafter was asked to take out the trash. Hence the poorly executed utterance.

When mom heard the five-letter insult, she asked, and asked kind of nicely, just who the girl was calling that name.

The 12-year-old responded as kids will by claiming she was actually directing the name-calling to some girl at school she didn&apos;t like.

Uh-huh!

Mom said in the e-mail that the kid hadn&apos;t even taken the time to exercise her manners and apologize by the following day and instead went about her business in the usual fashion of wanting this and demanding that.

I sent my piece of advice, in which I did not inquire as to whether a funeral parlor had already been selected. The parents, I suspect, weren&apos;t too enthralled with what I thought was a very measured approach. The response I received said they were collecting all input and thought it best to approach the matter in a three-step plan.

Death, funeral and the repast?

Then came more e-mails. An aunt gave some advice, making sure the parents acted in a loving, non-judgmental way.
What? I thought our job as parents was to be judgmental - if we aren&apos;t, just who else is going to put our little darlings on the right track?
Then an e-mail came from one of the child&apos;s grandmothers who offered up that the girl had many issues she had to deal with.

And while all of this nonsense called collecting of wisdom is taking place, little Ms. Foul Mouth is continuing to live the good life awaiting the decision on how to handle the trash-talking event.

When I grew up we were prepared for parenthood, in part, because we knew how to operate on the instinct sometimes called mother wit.

When the baby was tumbling out of the high chair, we didn&apos;t call on the elders - we just knew to catch the kid.

We never had to wonder what to do if our kid called us a foul name, because when I raised kids, they knew I carried no life insurance policy on them, and that there would be death with no splashy party or flower-filled funeral service.

Am I talking abuse? No , I&apos;m talking figuratively. I&apos;m talking about parents understanding sometimes we&apos;ve got to shoot from the hip and not ask dumb questions such as&quot;Who are you calling the B word?,&quot;setting the kid up to lie and then being afraid to dispense with justice.

Oh, the darlings probably call us all kind of names under their breaths. All power to the silence. But when this disrespect becomes audible, the game changes and we stop the mess when it happens.

 PARTIES. CURFEWS. GUNSHOTS AND DEAD TEENS 

 Published On 09-11-2010 , 12:43 AM 


DOMINIQUE Peatry, 14, of Lancaster, attended her last house party this past Labor Day weekend.

Early Sunday morning, homicide investigators report that sometime around 1 a.m. she was shot dead at the hip-shaking event.

The gunmen didn&apos;t just take down Dominique. Six other revelers, ranging in age from 13 to 26, were injured but are expected to survive.

On Aug. 28, The Desert Sun reported the teenager shot and killed the previous weekend at a Coachella party was now identified as 16-year-old Angel Raul Bernal.

And looking out of state, the Chicago Sun-Times reported on Aug. 29 that 17-year-old Adolfoi Guijardo-Soria was killed by a gunshot while attending a block party.

These are just a small sampling of the stories involving teens killed at weekend parties. There&apos;s not much reason to list any more of them because the circumstances are the same and only the names and ages of the victims change.

How devastating for the families and friends who believed their teenagers were out for a night of fun and frolic. But these tragedies go beyond the loss of life and the pain the family and friends suffer.

Herein lies the bigger picture:

In simple and straightforward parent talk, the answer to&quot;Can I go to the party&quot;requires answers to the following from the teenager: Who is giving it? The address? And provide me with the name and telephone number of the parents.
 In the Lancaster scenario, I want to know who stood at the door and thought it was OK to let
 13-year-old kids into the place to party with adults who were in their late 20s? And how come no one seemed to know there&apos;s a curfew for kids and that was many hours before the gunfire erupted at 1:00 a.m.?

Am I blaming the victims? I certainly hope not, but I am seeing these weekend murders as something that a small amount of parental oversight might work toward providing funeral homes with less business.

Parents have a responsibility when the teenager believes her or she, like&quot;all the other kids,&quot;ought to be at the party.

As my mother, the nuisance lady, used to say,&quot;I&apos;m not all the other mothers&quot;and the answer is you&apos;re not going. The nuisance lady would call the party house with her list of questions.

Does this kind of parental behavior actually work? Not all the time, but it puts teenagers on notice that your eye is on the prize.

Ms. Nuisance was policing all her kids&apos; activities and that was long before guns and drugs were standard operating procedures in the world of young folk.

When I had kids, I expanded on the concept of being a nuisance. My offspring knew that whatever party they were given permission to attend, I was going to drive past to watch who was going in, and if there were the slightest appearance of a wrong crowd, I would park, go in and mine would have to come out.

This kind of watchdog behavior doesn&apos;t have to be repeated or even carried out (just the thought of it) because no one wants his or her mother with her hair uncombed, wearing her bath robe, ringing the doorbell at a party.

Times are dangerous and house parties are no exception. Are parents going to monitor them?
 Of course not.

 IT&apos;S NOT WHAT YOU KNOW BUT WHO YOU&apos;RE RELATED TO 

 Published On 09-03-2010 , 7:33 PM 


DALLAS Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson is an absolute disgrace. Over the years, she has continuously awarded Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Scholarships to her relatives and to relatives of her district director. Now exposed, she claims she was unaware of rules against this.

According to the foundation&apos;s annual reports from 2005-2008, Johnson awarded 11 scholarships a year and each of those years, three or four of the winners were to her and to her aide&apos;s children, grandchildren or nephews.

Johnson&apos;s excuse is shameful, insensitive, insulting and unbelievable. As a nine-term elected official in a public trust position who served as chair of the Black Caucus Foundation and on its board of directors, who does she expect will believe her story that she was ignorant of the rules?

In defending herself, Johnson says had there been more worthy applicants, she probably would not have given the scholarships to relatives.

In a full display of how high and mighty she sees herself, she announced in an interview with CNN&apos;s Anderson Cooper that she had repaid the $31,000 from her personal funds and she is ready to move on.

Continuing, she implied there was no real news in this story because she had made a simple mistake and the scholarship awards are a very minor part of what she does.

Being peppered with questions concerning her awardees lying on the application in signing that they were not related to anyone affiliated with the Congressional Black Caucus, Johnson ran for cover telling Cooper she knew nothing about the application and concluded by saying those records were missing from her office.

How dare this black woman claim the lack of worthy applicants? Did she take her elected self or send members of her staff out into the district she represents to knock on doors and find families?

Did she or her staff visit the high schools where she claims she sent the scholarship information to pump up the need for their seniors to apply?

Of course not.

Johnson, like too many black folk who think they&apos;ve made it but still have the chance to help others, don&apos;t want the lower socio-economic kids contaminating the world they&apos;ve come to believe is theirs.

The congresswoman isn&apos;t alone in parceling out academic goodies to her relatives. School administrators and teachers do the same on a regular basis.

Ask them how their kids got full scholarships to Harvard, Stanford, Yale and other best of the best institutions of higher learning and you won&apos;t hear them say the information came across their desk and they kept it for themselves rather than informing the public.

I&apos;m glad the Texas congresswoman has been outed and has shown her true self with the arrogant attitude and insensitive and unbelievable excuses.

But I&apos;ll only be satisfied if it helps students and their families become more diligent in uncovering the many opportunities that are available to them and then show a willingness to expose those who, like Johnson, are keeping the goodies for them and theirs.

 BACK TO SCHOOL SHOPPING FOR WHAT? 

 Published On 08-27-2010 , 10:57 PM 

According to the National Retail Federation&apos;s 2010 back-to-school survey, the average American family will spend $606 on clothes, shoes, supplies and electronics, compared to $548 last year and $594 in 2008. Total spending on school-aged children in grades K-12 is expected to reach $21.35 billion.

I didn&apos;t find results of any survey charting how much time American parents would spend shopping at their kid&apos;s school for the education plan and policies pertaining to academic proficiency. It&apos;s an all-too-acceptable edict that clothes make the student.

A quick stop by the closet in an American kid&apos;s room prior to the annual end-of-summer spending ritual will usually yield a floor full of shoes, a rack full of clothing and a backpack or two crammed into a corner.

Turning attention in the room to the chest of drawers, there will be T-shirts and other items, some still with price tags attached, that have never been worn. Back-to-school shopping ought to start at home.

Drag the so-called worn-out backpacks from out of the corner and take `em down to the shoe repair shop to get the handles and straps strengthened and the whole thing cleaned up.

But the kid wants a new one with a favorite television character splashed in gaudy colors from top to bottom and sometimes even with a water bottle to match.

Get real, shoppers. Recheck that list you&apos;ve created and start scratching off the wants and stick with the needs.

Growing feet most certainly need a pair of new shoes. But where the high cost of footwear enters the picture isn&apos;t always the individual price - it is the many pairs our offspring think they should own. What self-respecting high school young lady wants to wear the same shoes no matter the outfit?

And how many parents, no matter the condition of the household budget, defy this trend? Whether standing in the unemployment line or hiding from the neighbors as the repo man hauls away the SUV, parents tend to believe they&apos;re required to be part of the retail federation&apos;s survey results.

Let&apos;s miss the madness this year and contribute to a small dip in the anticipated $21.35 billion spending spree. Let&apos;s create a scenario of shopping at the school for what Julio, Jamal and Johnny and their female counterparts really need.

Schools are open prior to the first day of classes, which provides every parent the opportunity to make the acquaintance of those in charge of academic progress either by drop-in visit, appointment or phone call.

Develop a list of questions based on what you forgot to find out last year and just like the conversation that usually takes place regarding shopping for clothes, consult with the offspring about their academic wants and needs.

Keep this going all year long. It will be time well spent with results guaranteed. It&apos;s a different way of preparing for the school year. It&apos;s real money saved. it&apos;s children very annoyed.

Guaranteed? I have four adult children, all university graduates, and Brandi, my 19-year-old, attends junior college.

 WHAT ABOUT DR. LAURA? 

 Published On 08-20-2010 , 9:22 PM 


DOES Laura Schlessinger speak for white America? The well-known and controversial syndicated radio host and author may be, in her latest diatribe, giving us all a walk down Race Avenue, Anytown, U.S.A.

Nita Hanson, radio code name Jade, an African-American woman from Colorado Springs, who is a regular listener to the program and happens to be married to a white man, called Schlessinger with a question on a racial issue.

Hanson didn&apos;t get any useful advice, but listeners that day - and now everyone across the country - were given the opportunity to examine the question of race in America.

Much has been made of Dr. Laura&apos;s spouting out the&quot;N&quot;word 11 times while referring to rappers&apos; and black comedians&apos; constant use of the derogatory term. She was upset about the word being holy ground for anyone of non-color to walk on.

Hmm, political correctness doesn&apos;t allow this topic to cross the color line. White folks in personal conversations aren&apos;t going to risk the trouble it might cause them in a friendship to talk about this double standard.

But what about it?

What if I always wrote what I really thought in the moment? Should I be willing to risk the baring of my true soul when it comes to being black in white America?

Talk-show hosts don&apos;t have the benefits of a delete key. They get on a verbal roll and can&apos;t edit as they go. They don&apos;t know where a conversation with a caller is going when they get into it and what they say is exactly who they are. The old expression&quot;the truth will out&quot;has real meaning here for Dr. Laura.

I edit as I go. Eliminate entire paragraphs. Reword and rewrite. Think and then maybe choose another phrase.

Do I put into print everything I think? Please! But I most certainly have personal conversations where the edit button isn&apos;t available. Do I have conversations about race that I would never put into print? Most certainly.

While I usually don&apos;t comment on letters to the editor in the newspaper regarding my column, a recent one questioning my statement&quot;the need to interpret white America for our offspring&quot;can&apos;t be ignored because it fits too well with this discussion.

The writer advises:&quot;Smith should stop talking about race and start talking about anyone who is unemployed, who&apos;ve lost their job, who is low income, or generally needs help. People need to look at a person&apos;s character, not their color, religion or ethnicity.&quot;

The black parents who don&apos;t continually talk to their children about race in America are not fulfilling the responsibility of preparing them for the real world.

Black parents, as well as others, shouldn&apos;t take the Dr. Laura controversy as one woman&apos;s ranting - we all need to examine it for the deeper meaning.

To believe race doesn&apos;t matter in America is, simply put, wishful thinking.

To believe Dr. Laura&apos;s words aren&apos;t actually what a lot of white Americans think is, simply put, some more wishful thinking.

 KEEPING TODDLERS AT THE GATE 

 Published On 08-13-2010 , 9:38 PM 

KIDS could be getting sick from eating food intended for their pets. These kibbles and bits aren&apos;t meant for human consumption. And most picky pet owners wouldn&apos;t be caught dead feeding their little animal darlings most of the brands the rest of us bring home for our dogs and cats.

So have our kids created a new junk food craze?

I think kitchens are for the cooks and for those who wash the dishes unless it&apos;s mealtime and then all members of the family sit down at the kitchen table unless, of course, they use a dining room.

While this seems a common sense formula, a report from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests otherwise. Apparently it&apos;s not just the cooks and dishwashers hanging out in the family meal prep center.

Babies crawling around the floor in their sagging paper diapers and pulling pots and pans from kitchen cupboards seems a rather common occurrence in many a home.

There are the toddlers who run amuck pulling at the cat&apos;s tail as the feline crunches on the dry tidbits in its dish that sits just next to the kitchen back door.

Or maybe our little toddler is busy kicking at the dog while it laps from the water pan that sits underneath the bottled water cooler.

How come these underage cooks and dishwashers have the run of the place?

The parent, who asked for my advice when it came to keeping her kid from being underfoot when she was trying to prepare meals, defied all logic.&quot;Oh, I have one of those gates you&apos;re talking about and it is across the doorway,&quot;she responded.

Well, then, how come her little boy was still underfoot? The mom explained in great detail that he cried, had tantrums, and rolled on the floor right next to the gate that blocked his entrance to what was supposed to be forbidden territory.

And so she, to keep the peace, let him in. While this kid had long passed the crawling or toddler stage and may not have been a candidate for nibbling the pet food, his mother&apos;s inability to keep him out seems to be a prevailing problem for those moms with the young ones who hang out in close proximity to the pet food.

While many health warnings have been issued over the last few years that relate to dry pet foods being an under-recognized source of salmonella infections in humans, too many parents seem to have missed the red flags.

Missing the warnings is about the same as missing the common sense approach as to who belongs in the meal prep room. For the safety of all the little kids, put the crawler in the high chair, buy a gate and keep the toddler on the far side of it.

A few simple suggestions families ought to practice when it comes to having four-legged creatures in the home: 1. Wash hands after contact with them and their food and bowls 2. Regularly clean their bowls and feeding areas and don&apos;t do this in the kitchen sink or in the bathtub.

Now will this will stop the older kiddies in the household who yield to temptation and taste that stuff their animals so readily gobble up?

It&apos;s time for this conversation with the family to take place, whether it happens at the kitchen table or in the dinning room. Let&apos;s just do it.

 WITH TEEN DRIVING, STORY IS SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE 

 Published On 07-30-2010 , 10:58 PM 


MY older sister always talked about what she called three sides to every story - his, hers and the part left out.

There are probably many other titles for this adage, but the clear point is each person has a version, and all too often those versions hold the teller of the tale in the best light.

Such turned out to be the case of Ms. Mom who called me for advice concerning her 14-year-old son going with his friend to an amusement park about an hour&apos;s drive from their home on the freeway.

Big concern, said mom, was the friend&apos;s 17-year-old brother who would be, along with his same-aged girlfriend, driving the car.

&quot;They just don&apos;t have that much behind-the-wheel experience,&quot;Ms. Mom announced and went on to say she just had a bad feeling in her gut.

&quot;That&apos;s a long way from home,&quot;she continued, and asked me what I thought.

Well, first off, if you sense trouble, if your stomach or your head is saying,&quot;Maybe not,&quot;then you&apos;ve already got the answer. But the caller insisted she really wanted to approach this outing logically.

Was the 14-year-old too young for such an excursion unaccompanied by an adult?

Do you know the older brother? Is he a responsible kid? Does he have insurance and what do you know about the parents?

What does your husband have to say about the excursion, I wanted to know.

&quot;He told me to ask you,&quot;she responded.

Passing the buck is a great strategy, so I asked Sherry Goodloe, a AAA instructor for its Teen Driving Program.

I asked a lot of other people, too.

Most, including myself, thought that given the positive response to the insurance question and the fact that the older brother was said to be extremely responsible and that the two families were familiar with each other, the kid should get to go.

But Sherry, not just knowledgeable in teen driving issues but an extremely wise woman, focused on that bad feeling Ms. Mom had in her gut. That is what every mom is supposed to go with.

It trumps everything else.

Back to the adage of three sides to every story: Turns out Ms. Mom was kinda running a game - as folks often do when they claim they need advice. Ms. Mom didn&apos;t give all the details, which included a very important one - she&apos;d already told the kid he couldn&apos;t go and she was simply wondering if she&apos;d made the right decision.

This brings up another important parenting process - consistency. It also turns out Ms. Mom didn&apos;t tell her son no because she was concerned about the long drive taking him far from home or because of the responsibility level or of the driver&apos;s experience.

In a lengthy follow-up conversation, it came out that her kid had not been behaving as he should&apos;ve in a multitude of situations and he didn&apos;t deserve the trip to the amusement park.

Three sides to every story? The kid didn&apos;t get to go - Ms. Mom was consistent but he never heard it was about his past behavior. But how come I had to hear a round-about version about an issue we parents ponder all the time?

And the answer to all of this has to be that elusive third factor - the truth is in the middle.

 STAYING COOL &apos;OLD LADY&apos; STYLE 

 Published On 07-16-2010 , 10:58 PM 

GRANNY Pickett kept the house dark.&quot;Another of her &apos;old lady&apos; behaviors,&quot;&apos; I reasoned. 
I whined to my mother about these absurd conditions and, as most young folk will do, threw in what I thought was the winning argument which was something about my friends didn&apos;t have to creep through their homes trying hard to see.

Every summer my mother gave the same steady and consistent answer reminding me we lived in Granny Picket&apos;s home and she ran it the way she saw fit.

Old people and non-combative parents who didn&apos;t stick up for their kids was my reasoning on this hot weather issue.

The curtains, drapes and shades are closed in my home during these days of triple digit temperatures. That daily breeze I knew my father&apos;s mother was depriving the family of because she closed all windows at 5 a.m. each morning, is forbidden from entering the domicile I administer.

Nobody told me, in days gone by, that the air is coolest at night and that&apos;s why the windows were opened but closed when the hot air was all we would get come daytime - but no breeze.

I had to respect my grandmother; no back talk, no eye rolls, courteous at all time and obedient no matter what her position on any matter. But geez!

&quot;Your cats need a frozen wash cloth on their bodies,&quot;was the new edict from me this summer for Brandi&apos;s lifeless looking cats, Mali and Cowcat.

I didn&apos;t get any teenage-to-old-lady attitude. The cloths were soaked in water, placed in the freezer and removed as soon as ice crystals formed.

From the cats&apos; I-can&apos;t-move position in separate corners of the kitchen floor, one pet shifted her tail and the other one simply opened both eyes as `old-lady cool&apos; got placed on their panting bodies.

If the cats could benefit from this innovation, why couldn&apos;t their owner, mused my thinking teenager, but then she quickly voiced concern about a brain freeze.

This hot weather ain&apos;t easy on one&apos;s body. But sitting at our kitchen table under the ceiling fan, turned up to maximum, adorned with silly looking ice-crystal wash cloths on our heads in a room with the windows closed and the shades drawn, we were doing our best.

It was then that I remembered the warnings from every elementary school teacher I have had:&quot;Now, children,&quot;they said during every heat wave,&quot;using those little paper fans you&apos;ve made is not helping you to be cooler because you&apos;re using energy.&quot;

What if someone were to tell us the ice caps we&apos;d made were doing us more harm than good?

What if the next morning I discovered the cats were no longer with us because they&apos;d been chilled to death?

Like we students who tuned out our grade school teachers, Brandi and I were ready to defy the odds. Something has to help us through this siege of too hot weather.

As for my grandmother, as usual, the old folks know what they&apos;re talking about. Brandi found her words of wisdom on the Internet listed under&quot;how to survive the heat.&quot;

 PUBLIC COMMENT TAKES THE BACKSEAT TO PUBLIC DEBATE 

 Published On 07-04-2010 , 9:36 PM 


EVERY kid of mine has had to suffer through my storming down to a local school board meeting to let the elected officials who sit behind what I call the curved desk in comfy leather chairs hear my side of the story.

Did whichever kid of mine it was at the time want to be there with me? Of course not. But as I was quick to let my young household members know,&quot;If it wasn&apos;t that I had kids, and was your mother, I wouldn&apos;t even know this was going on.&quot;

That was usually followed by a short&quot;Just get in the car and shut up.&quot;

I&apos;ve even been down to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to give those politicians my point of view.

Were they interested? Did they care? Of course not.

However, I&apos;m a firm believer that the people should utilize the item called public comment on the agendas of boards that serve the public and I most certainly wanted my offspring to recognize their civic responsibility.

The unique quality of this public comment feature is that it is just that - a chance for the public to be heard.

For the many times I seized this opportunity, and had my children bare witness, there was never a time those who were forced to hear my three-minute tirade gave argument, comment or attitude.

I was always listened to and thanked but I never thought for a moment these servants of the public wanted to hear what I had to say, considered my viewpoint or were pleased that I had taken the time to stand before them.

Sometimes in life the tables turn. So when serving on the Altadena Library Board of Trustees and listening to a room full of constituents present their concerns regarding the library&apos;s plans for expansion, it was our job, I thought, to listen and be polite. Well, maybe also ask a question for point of clarification - but listen.

&quot;How come nobody even talked to you?&quot;one of my kids wanted to know, way back in the day, after a trip down to a school board meeting.

&quot;Public comment,&quot;I answered dryly.&quot;Not public debate.&quot;

But things weren&apos;t that way on that night at the library meeting because the locals never got to know the difference between comment and debate because the trustees soundly put them in their place.

But wait. These people were who I am. Like me, they came from their homes because they had concerns.

Maybe they weren&apos;t articulate. Maybe they weren&apos;t dressed just right. But just maybe their point of view wasn&apos;t what the trustees wanted to hear.

But these locals were me, in days gone by, addressing the Board of Supervisors. These people were me, some many years ago with a kid in tow, blasting members of the local school board.

The concerned locals didn&apos;t get the respect that is supposed to be afforded them when they provide their opinion

The old folks in the neighborhood where I grew up preached that you&apos;re judged by the company you keep and this old-time value system expands, for me, to mean that I am judged by the boards on which I serve.

I was walking in the wrong shoes.

While the trustees accepted my resignation without an exit interview, folks around town keep asking the why. But I suspect the folks whose comments were turned into a debate at that meeting know quite well Shirlee Smith was out of place in the company she was keeping.

 VOTE TO MAKE SHIRLEE THE NEXT OPRAH 

 Published On 06-18-2010 , 9:22 PM 

IT&apos;S a Saturday morning and I&apos;m in Laguna Niguel, having lined up at 4 a.m. in a Kohl&apos;s parking lot. I have no idea how many people are here ahead of me. What number am I?
Wrist bands won&apos;t be passed out until 8 a.m., but with people flying in from all over the world for this event, a quick journey down the 5 freeway in no traffic and a mere four-hour wait to secure my place in history is something I plan to handle with ease.

Actually, at my age standing in line is not quite done with ease. So I&apos;ve got with me a folding camping chair, a small cooler on wheels, a huge sun hat, a book, a camera and a daughter who is diligent enough to have accompanied me.

&quot;A chance of a lifetime&quot;read an online post from someone who was flying in from Europe.

&quot;It all runs quite smoothly,&quot;someone else posted, who had lined up in Texas.

then there was the video clip of this Texas bunch. Replay after replay and I still never spotted any gray-haired grannies in the crowd of hopefuls - not even one.

&quot;Maybe I should shave off a few of my years and claim to be younger,&quot;I said to Brandi as I filled out the application for this chance of a lifetime.

&quot;For all you know,&quot;she responded,&quot;they&apos;re looking for a granny.&quot;

Great response from a kid I teach to be honest and to be proud and happy with who she is.

But, I reasoned to myself, women are pardoned for lying about their age. Being of bad memory, I couldn&apos;t have kept up the lie, and liars have to have a memory.


Anyway, I&apos;d have had trouble doing the mathematical calculations when the application asked for ages of children. My oldest is 53 - if I shaved down my years, I would have had her somewhere around the age of 10.

Thanks, Brandi. A gray-haired granny is what they&apos;ll get.

I actually owe Brandi some more thanks because she made the video and edited it into a three-minute clip and uploaded it with the Flip camera the Flintridge Foundation awarded our nonprofit organization through a capacity-building grant. So thank you, Flintridge.

In Christmas colors, with a few poinsettia plants in the background, you&apos;ll find me working with a group of parents (they&apos;re off camera - no need for releases this way) attending one of my most popular workshops,&quot;Your Kids - Your Money.&quot;

I&apos;m hoping I will also get to thank all of you readers for visiting our uploaded video clip and voting for me in the Oprah competition for having a show on her new network,OWN.

&quot;Talk About Parenting with Shirlee Smith&quot;has been a cable show produced at the city of Pasadena studios since 1994.

If you vote and tell your friends to vote for my common-sense parenting approach, and if I make it through the casting call/audition, we just might all have a chance to witness the birth of a no -nonsense parenting message gone national.

Here&apos;s the website where you can vote: http://myown.oprah.com/audition - put in my name and you&apos;ll see the clip and please click on the green check mark for me.

 THE TEENAGE GIRLS ARE TO BE COMMENDED 

 Published On 06-11-2010 , 9:17 PM 


WHILE the arrest of James Norkin, the sex-offender parolee accused of groping a teenage girl on an Orange County bus, is being heralded as quick action by the authorities, I believe a good portion of that praise belongs to the girl, the friends who were with her and their families.

According to news reports, the alleged victim boarded the bus with two friends. During their ride to Laguna Niguel, the accused grabbed a seat next to them and as the girls tell it, continually touched one of them inappropriately.

The friends yelled for him to stop and managed to take a picture of the attack on a cell phone. The teenager who was being groped was, it&apos;s reported, too scared to move.

Norkin pretended to be sleeping, but fortunately the teenagers were alert, grasped the reality of the situation and did the right thing.

The Orange County bus system caught Norkin on surveillance cameras and these videos were quickly broadcast on news outlets where the sex offender&apos;s parole officer spotted him, which led to the quick arrest. But without the girls&apos; actions, I think Norkin would still be molesting females. Instead, within a few days he was sent back to Chino State Prison.

&quot;I&apos;d-a slapped him upside his head,&quot;announced one belligerent teenager with whom we were discussing the incident.

&quot;What if he had a weapon?&quot;asked her friend.&quot;Then what?&quot;

What to tell our young women? Remain silent? Don&apos;t move? Have cell phone ready?
Only travel with a buddy? Maybe.
Don&apos;t ride the bus? Don&apos;t sit next to men? Don&apos;t sit next to anyone? Stand in the aisle? Getting to sound kind of silly.

Just what&apos;s a female passenger to do? Carry a legal-size container of pepper spray or Mace?

This matter of being molested on public transportation is nothing new. It just doesn&apos;t always make the front page, and more times than not it doesn&apos;t get reported.

But when we talk to those who ride public transportation or when we do just a small amount of research we find that females being embarrassed about the incident is a huge factor that allows these perverts to keep on doing what they do.

According to one story, standing in the aisle is no safer than being seated. One woman rail commuter was standing in the crowded aisle in front of a man. There were plenty of passengers surrounding her on all sides and a friend less than a few feet away, but no one was aware of the molestation that was happening to her.

I don&apos;t suspect the teenagers riding the Orange County bus had a series of training classes, so what might have led them to handle the situation in the manner that they did?

What is it that they&apos;ve heard or experienced in their young lives that brought them to do the right thing?

Our belligerent teen kept citing some Tyler Perry movie in which the main character, whose name escapes me, got on a school bus and beat a misbehaving kid over the head.

&quot;I ain&apos;t takin&apos; nothin&apos; offa nobody,&quot;the teen maintained - no matter what the best way is to handle an encounter with a molester while riding public transportation.

 GET &apos;EM TO THE LIBRARY 

 Published On 05-21-2010 , 10:02 PM 

 
All too often people, old and young, will stay away from all things unfamiliar.

There are a lot of folks from my generation who refuse to have anything to do with a computer or a digital camera.

Why?

Well, I hear lots of reasons from my contemporaries but, in general, all of their conversations tend to support that age-old business of not knowing how to access and work with that which they dismiss.

My friend&apos;s teenage foster son in no way resembles the old-timers. His hair is neither grey nor thinning. Instead, his hair is thick, shinny and combed into spikes I think is called a Mohawk.

When I talked to him about his coming to Tuesday&apos;s event celebrating National Foster Care Month at the Altadena Library, he shuffled around, didn&apos;t look me square in the eye and mumbled several comments about not being into libraries.

His foster mom said she&apos;d thought about&quot;the place&quot;being a good spot for homework, but for as long as the young man had lived at her home she hadn&apos;t been able to convince him.

Exactly what does it take to get a young teenager into the library?

Well, I&apos;d like to say going there with the kid and working through the process of acquiring a card, searching the stacks, signing-up for computer time, and examining everything else that&apos;s available.

Sounds simple but it ain&apos;t.

Just because we&apos;ve acquired parenting status doesn&apos;t mean we&apos;ve reached familiarity with all things available.


Tuesday&apos;s event at the Altadena Library will help get Foster and Kinship caregivers and their charges on the same page. The event will include a brief tour conducted by Cassandra Stearns and Heather Fichow and the children and young adult librarians. They have put together a selection of fiction books for foster youth and a wide range of resources for caregivers to check out. Links to all this information can be found on the library web site at www.altadenalibrary.org .

All libraries in Los Angeles County provide a Foster Youth Library Card program that encompasses special features. Applications will be available at the event for youth and their caregivers and foster parents who are being asked to please bring placement papers for verification.

Los Angeles County Fifth District Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich&apos;s Foster Care Deputy, Helen Berberian; Steve Sturm with the Department of Children and Family Services Education Division, and local attorney, Joe Hopkins, will be there as well to deliver brief welcoming remarks.

Pauline Dutton, principal librarian, has developed welcome letters with a focus on programs available to assist students and help them get the best from their use of the facility.

&quot;Uh, the library,&quot;my friend&apos;s teenager mumbled when it began to look like she&apos;d have him in tow come next Tuesday.

&quot;It ain&apos;t happenin. It&apos;s a bore,&quot;he grumbled.

Life is what you make it, and only those who aren&apos;t used to being at the library could share this kid&apos;s commentary.

Will they come?

Well, Dutton asked me how many I was expecting. Even with my best guess, all I could answer was,&quot;I haven&apos;t the faintest idea.&quot;

We&apos;re serving refreshments and have a few items to raffle off. We&apos;ve asked for RSVPs to know how many plastic plates to provide, but . . .

Are you a foster or kinship caregiver? Come to the Altadena Library, 600 East Mariposa St., on Tuesday, 6 p.m., to celebrate National Foster Care Month. Let us know you&apos;re coming by calling 626-296-2777 or e-mailing me at: shirlee@talkaboutparenting.org

 WHAT&apos;S THE GOOD OF A PRESIDENTIAL PROCLAMATION? 

 Published On 05-07-2010 , 11:07 PM 


&quot;NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2010 as National Foster Care Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month with appropriate programs and activities to honor and support young people in foster care, and to recognize the committed adults who work on their behalf each day.

&quot;IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.&quot;

It&apos;s been pointed out in numerous conversations that I&apos;ve been privy, to, and it can also be found in some publications that not too many of our presidents have recognized foster care in this manner. Praise for Obama has been a definite part of the conversation. But I&apos;ve been unable to show great enthusiasm because I&apos;ve not been able to interpret the message.

Just exactly what does this &apos;NOW, THEREFORE&quot;verbiage translate into?&quot;Calling upon all Americans,&quot;means what Mr. President?

Want to know something? Google it. I wanted a definition - I got Wikipedia.

A presidential proclamation in the United States is&quot;an instrument that states a condition, declares a law and requires obedience, recognizes an event or triggers the implementation of a law (by recognizing that the circumstances in law have been realized).
&quot;In short, presidents&quot;define&quot;situations or conditions on situations that become legal or economic truth. These orders carry the same force of law as executive orders - the difference between the two is that executive orders are aimed at those inside government while proclamations are aimed at those outside government.
The administrative weight of these proclamations is upheld because they are often specifically authorized by congressional statute, making them&quot;delegated unilateral powers.&quot;Presidential proclamations are often dismissed as a practical presidential tool for policy making because of the perception of proclamations as largely ceremonial or symbolic in nature. However, the legal weight of presidential proclamations suggests their importance to presidential governance.

I&apos;m going for the piece in this definition that claims&quot;these orders carry the same force of law as executive orders.&quot;If memory serves me right, and it does because I checked myself with various Internet sources, President Gerald Ford&apos;s 4311 Proclamation granted a pardon to his onetime boss, Richard M. Nixon.

That was heavy stuff. Nixon was let off the hook for the bad Watergate criminal acts he orchestrated. But was this an executive order since it was, as Wikipedia says, inside government? Whichever, it put in place something that was historical and significant.

Now about this National Foster Care Month proclamation that calls upon all of us to do ... what? Oh, something about programs, activities and observations.

The public can do updates on Wikipedia and I&apos;m considering rearranging the sentence that refers to the equal powers, executive orders and proclamations. But maybe not, since my scholarly endeavors don&apos;t lead me in the direction of knowing these things.

I do know Nixon got cleared and I do know I&apos;m still looking for the power behind this Obama proclamation.

Maybe the power is coming. Maybe I&apos;m reading things wrong. I do that a lot now that I&apos;m old and some (my kids) say feeble.

 NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH 

 Published On 04-30-2010 , 10:19 PM 

MAY 2010 is National Foster Care Month. But, then, we had the same designation in 2009 and the same in previous years.
During this month the need for loving and permanent homes gets emphasized and the large numbers of children and youth in out of home placement is spelled out. We&apos;re told of the achievements these young wards of the court can make when someone dedicated to maximizing their potential steps to the plate and answers the call to make someone else&apos;s kid their very own.

&quot;That&apos;s not such an easy thing to do,&quot;I&apos;ve been told. This kind of reasoning is, most times, followed by a variety of statements that seem to try qualifying the depth of hardship encountered when making someone else&apos;s kid our own.

While I most certainly understand the headaches encountered in working with the county Department of Children and Family Service&apos;s paperwork, overbearing social workers, the Children&apos;s court system, problems the foster children have, and having to be involved with their birth parents, these are not the difficulties mentioned in the back-up explanatory conversation regarding&quot;...not such an easy thing to do.&quot;

While quiet conversations I&apos;ve had with people involving my own role as a foster parent have provided honest and oft times soul wrenching testimony to people&apos;s inability to spread the love; more importantly it has brought to the forefront a deep-rooted problem with parents in our society.

Too many of us only care about our own. Too many of us don&apos;t care that the kids in the back of the classroom can&apos;t read as long as our own Julio, John or Jerome, sits up front and masters the assignments.

The gang problem isn&apos;t mine because my kid is home at night under my watchful eye - seems to be the position too many parents want to quietly shout.

Bringing someone else&apos;s problem kid into their own well or even poorly regulated home environment brings about the hardship. The problem is not with the foster care system but with their own inability to see that not the whole world but just a small piece of it could be in their hands.

Too many good people don&apos;t realize the non-reading kid at the back of the classroom, the gang-banger who lives down the street and the foster kid who languished in a group home and then became homeless may well be the kid packing iron whose randomly fired stray bullet wipes out the life of their own kid who had the best of everything.

How do we get well-meaning members of the public to get past this? How do we get well-meaning members of the public to realize they can overcome their own selfish viewpoint that only their kids belong at the top of society&apos;s doing-well list?
 I need you to tell me.

 WHO IN THE WORLD IS SHIRLEE SMITH? 

 Published On 04-24-2010 , 12:01 AM 


I received an e-mail that said the writer was shocked to find I was a&quot;local&quot;person. This, he said, became clear to him only when I mentioned taking part in a local election.

Never thought I was a mystery woman or that where I hang my hat wasn&apos;t clear.

Fortunately, my photo appears here on the web site, or might I even be mistaken for someone of a different ethnicity?

Does where I live or where I come from really matter? Is my racial background of any matter to the public?

Another e-mail from a regular correspondent thinks my ethnicity is so important that he suggested I remove my picture from everything.about me. The writer believes that&quot;too many people don&apos;t get a chance to find out what you have to say because they see a picture of a black woman.&quot;

I live in Altadena on the west side of town, where I&apos;ve been since 1974. I came to this end of Los Angeles County in 1965 and lived in Pasadena until I moved to UCLA Married Student Housing in 1969.

I came to the San Gabriel Valley from Boyle Heights where my parents grew up and where they raised their four children.

My paternal grandmother owned a home on a street that was a hill near First Street and Evergreen Avenue.

My biggest wish while attending Roosevelt High School was that I could live in the projects because Aliso Village and Pico Gardens had some of the coolest black kids I had ever met.

My wish sorta came true when my mother, who didn&apos;t like living with her mother-in-law, applied for city housing. She was approved, but to my dismay, we moved to Basilone Homes in the San Fernando Valley.

My father wasn&apos;t about to be housed in converted army barracks, which the Valley projects were. I came to realize that, unlike me, he understood the stigma attached to living in the projects.

Why this background disclosure? Maybe because another reader e-mailed asking exactly who do I think I am writing&quot;the way you do?&quot;

From Boyle Heights to Pasadena to UCLA to Altadena and from Basilone Homes - and I forgot to mention the USC neighborhood of my childhood - I&apos;ve had the opportunity to digest quite a spoonful of&quot;people flavor&quot;and that&apos;s, in part, who I am.

I count among my friends some who have served time in the big house and also some of those who sit on the bench wearing black robes and pronouncing prison sentences.

Among my life-learning lessons were the undergraduate and graduate years at UCLA and 15 years on welfare as a single parent of a whole bunch of kids.

&quot;Who do I think I am?&quot;I never really think about it, so it&apos;s really left on the readers&apos; shoulders to arrive at their own conclusion.

With or without a photo, there&apos;s no mistaking my writing is from a viewpoint that clearly comes from my ethnicity.

While I enjoy hearing from readers and answer all correspondence, I don&apos;t often devote my writing to telling about Shirlee - maybe once every decade.

 DON&apos;T JUDGE UNTIL YOU&apos;VE WALKED IN HER SHOES 

 Published On 04-16-2010 , 9:39 PM 

 
Failed adoptions are common occurrences all across America. But thanks to nurse Tory Hansen, the public has come to know the horrors that face far too many people who simply step forward wanting to do the right thing by providing an orphaned child love, care, a home and a family.

Newspaper headlines and television commentators have been grabbing the public&apos;s heartstrings with inflammatory words describing Hansen&apos;s returning her 7-year-old adopted son to Russia, his country of origin.

The return of the boy has been described as heartbreaking and horrific. We&apos;ve heard how he was unwanted and rejected by Hansen and sent unaccompanied on an international flight from America to Russia.

Indignant Russian authorities claim she&quot;broke all procedures.&quot;They stand by their adoption procedures and in answer to Hansen&apos;s claim that the child is&quot;mentally unstable&quot;and these problems were not disclosed to her during the adoption process, officials say the boy&apos;s only disability is that of being flat-footed.

Russians do admit a slight bit of stubbornness, but they claim this is&quot;not a problem for loving parents.&quot;

Let me have a quiet word with those who&apos;ve been suckered in by the reporting of this story and by the castigation of Hansen for doing what adoptive and foster parents in this country do on a daily basis.

I suppose the difference is American kids don&apos;t take a long flight alone and their returns don&apos;t garner national attention.

But what would drive well-intentioned adoptive parents to turn kids back to the agencies they worked with to acquire them in the first place?

What nonsense the Russians utter when they want us to believe the boy&apos;s only disability is that of being flat-footed.

Some years ago, I chaired the Los Angeles County Adoption Commission and learned that department workers gave the same kind of glowing reports regarding the children in our system.

As a foster parent, I only accepted newborns, because I could ask the hospital where I picked up the infants for summary discharge papers and learn a little something about the medical condition.

Otherwise, for older children,&quot;confidentiality&quot;restricts any exchange of vital medical and psychological information.

Do I know what I&apos;m talking about?

I became guardian of the foster child I had cared for since she was a newborn when she was to be adopted, at the age of 3, by a well-meaning single parent.

As a foster parent, I was not allowed to discuss her. The department, wanting to boost its numbers, certainly wasn&apos;t talking. Fortunately for Brandi, her attorney stepped in to urge me to apply for guardianship. As he and I both knew, that saved her from being returned to the system once the adoptive mom learned the true medical and psychological issues she had on her hands and was unprepared to handle.

For those who haven&apos;t walked in Tory Hansen&apos;s shoes, it might be a good idea not to follow the media mania and cast stones. It might be a good idea to not think of her as a woman who couldn&apos;t handle responsibility but instead to think about her as a woman having no idea what her responsibility was going to be.

I&apos;m thinking she is a worn-down woman desperate to maintain her own sanity.

I&apos;ve been there and fortunately I have been blessed enough to have avoided desperate measures.

 MY MOTHER IS NOT COMING BACK 

 Published On 04-10-2010 , 2:53 PM 

I once belonged to the AARP. I think most seniors find them to be an organization worth joining. Then there&apos;s the League of Women Voters. Yes, as so many civic-minded individuals do, I joined their ranks even though my membership was a hefty $75 a year. Unfortunately, a tight budget dictated I not keep my place on the roll-call sheet.

And back when my oldest kid first went to kindergarten, I was even a member of the Malabar Street School PTA.

These are highly respected organizations, so when they tell the public something is A-OK we tend to take `em at their word. But, hold on, not so fast this time around.

My mother passed away many years ago, or she would be agonizing in her room at Altadena&apos;s Scripps Home and not going to breakfast because, according to her, the seniors at her table in the dining room would be casting accusatory glances that said,&quot;That daughter of yours is at it again.

&quot;Why must you write the things you write?&quot;my mother used to ask, though I sensed an odd sense of pride hidden in the reprimand.

My mother would be voting Yes on Measure CC, the parcel tax for the schools in Altadena, Pasadena and Sierra Madre, because she loved children, education, AARP and the LWV. She never talked much about the PTA.

The ballots are soon to be in our mailbox. A Yes vote is clear. If you own property, you&apos;ll pay an extra $120 per year to go to the local schools. Some might think they are casting a No vote if they just toss the ballot into the trash can. But that will not count as a No - has to be marked and mailed in.

My mother believed in a few questionable causes during her lifetime. There was the handsome young man at the bus stop who tried to convince her to go with him to her bank. Of course he was credible, she asserted; he was wearing a white shirt, tie and very nice business suit.

Mom wouldn&apos;t hear me when I said she was fortunate to not have taken his ride, as it was a scam. She accused me of trusting no one and it wasn&apos;t until an officer from the Pasadena Police Department&apos;s Crime Resistance Involvement Council came to our home and provided the info that she was willing to accept the truth.

But what about trusting this Measure CC scam because the endorsers have been believable and trustworthy in the past?

In life, we should all take the responsibility of asking questions and not just taking the word of well-dressed, handsome young men.

Here&apos;s one for the endorsers: Why did the drafters of this measure cause money to be spent on a separate mail-in election when they could have placed it on the June ballot?

Here&apos;s another: Which low-income seniors are eligible for the so-called exemption and what is the measure of their poverty status if the parcel tax passes, costing property owners $120 for the next five years?

If my mother were still with us, she&apos;d stand tall, be politically correct, not ask questions and vote Yes on this foolish measure and not being a homeowner it wouldn&apos;t even matter to her tight budget because she wouldn&apos;t be paying.

Mom&apos;s not coming back, but the young man is still waiting at the bus stop and he&apos;s happy to find you. This time around he&apos;s wearing an AARP, LWV or PTA lapel pin.

 WIN OR LOSE,VOTING AGAINST SCHOOL TAX 

 Published On 03-21-2010 , 12:01 AM 

 
IF you aren&apos;t registered, you can&apos;t vote. Some folks will rub their forehead in a weary gesture and want to know,&quot;What now?&quot;

What I&apos;m talking about might only make sense if you live in Altadena, Pasadena or Sierra Madre. But if you&apos;re interested in schools, you&apos;ve heard of new efforts in your district and mine to tax us more for them. The vote I&apos;m talking about is one you&apos;ll be asked to make soon, no matter where you live in California.

To continue: If you&apos;ve moved since the last time you placed a mark on the ballot, yup, you need to register. Your vote counts.

Now, when you don&apos;t vote, those who understand their civic responsibility and who keep up with the issues will, indeed, vote, thus making the choice for you. In other words, their choice becomes your choice.

And now, the Pasadena Unified School District, my favorite rip-off artist, wants your&quot;yes&quot;vote in favor of a parcel tax on a mail-in ballot with a May 4 deadline.

The tax would apply to 59,000 property owners in Pasadena, Altadena, and Sierra Madre, and is expected to pull in more than $7 million a year for the next five years.

Thanks to state cuts, our school district is said to be on the path of eliminating teacher positions, losing Advanced Placement classes and shutting down extracurricular activities without this voter bailout.

As a taxpayer and property owner in Altadena, I&apos;m not willing to give these bureaucrats who make up the administration down on Hudson Avenue the parcel tax cost of $120 a year to continue their programs that don&apos;t educate all students.

It&apos;s unfortunate that teachers will lose jobs. But it&apos;s equally unfortunate that so many teachers have not been doing their job.

Advanced Placement classes shutting down is also unfortunate. But too many folks from my side of town never knew such amenities existed.

I&apos;m not willing to vote for Measure CC to keep extracurricular activities in place. I&apos;m not willing to give the folks down on Hudson the opportunity to get a hold of my $120 for five years for many reasons.

One of those is because the folks on Hudson aren&apos;t trustworthy. They tell the public one thing, when the truth is so often something else.

In the case of this request for our hard-earned money, according to PUSD Chief Finance Officer John Pappalardo, this tax won&apos;t even come close to meeting the budget gap.&quot;Until you get into the $300-plus range on the tax, we will be way short of what we need,&quot;Pappalardo said in a recent news article.

Since it isn&apos;t enough, when and how will they come back for more? And why are we being asked to supply a bandage when cancer is the problem? Probably a really simple answer like the property owners would go for the smaller amount but balk at what Pappalardo seems to think is needed.

Many of the good and committed people of this district have joined together to fight for this tax believing, I suppose, that the district does a good job and can be trusted. Equally as important, good people don&apos;t want to see teachers in the unemployment line.

The chances that I&apos;ll be out-voted are high, because those who support the measure are those people who mark their ballots every time there is an election.

But with this May 4 mail-in, those folks who rub their forehead and ask&quot;What now?&quot;will be, by the time they wake up, too late to join me in voting&quot;no&quot;on Measure CC.

 WAS BARACK OBAMA TALKING TO PARENTS? 

 Published On 01-30-2010 , 11:32 PM 

PRESIDENT Barack Obama&apos;s State of the Union address was longer, I hear, than any other from a United States president in our nation&apos;s history. In that lengthy speech from Wednesday night, the man dispensed a bit of parental advice among his many words detailing where the country is and where it should be going.

While his words on education didn&apos;t really call us rulers of the household clan by name, but whenever I hear education reform mentioned it includes parents without so much as saying so.

 Advice? I think so.

 But Obama phrased it differently -&quot;reform&quot;was the word he used. But can there really be educational reform&quot;that raises student achievement, inspires students to excel in math and science,&quot;without putting parents on notice?

That&apos;s what I see as advice.

OK, the pundits in their ongoing analysis of what the president said don&apos;t quite see things my way as they were too busy reporting on how the focus groups perceived the speech, and how many Republicans in the chamber slept, didn&apos;t applaud or jump to their feet like the Democrats did.

 I&apos;m not surprised. When has my viewpoint been mainstream? When&apos;s the last time I saw things the same way as those who are paid handsomely to shape public opinion?

How are we going to, as Obama proclaimed,&quot;turn around failing schools that steal the future of too many young Americans, from rural communities to inner cities?&quot;While President Obama spoke emphatically about higher education, students cannot get there without a concrete foundation and that begins at home.

 Parents you&apos;ve been advised. Are you listening?

What must we think the man in the White House was talking about when he said:&quot;In the 21st century, one of the best anti-poverty programs is a world-class education. In this country, the success of our children cannot depend more on where they live than their potential.&quot;

Reform can be seen as the answer and the word, but I&apos;m going to claim that like charity beginning at home, recognizing a child&apos;s potential begins in the same place.

 It was advice to parents but it was couched in the words,&quot;... the best anti-poverty program is a world-class education.&quot;I took that to mean stop letting the lack of money and where one lives be the excuse for parents not making sure their kids have a good education.

Maybe I was reading into the State of the Union address something the president had said when he was on the campaign trail in Beaumont, TX.&quot;It&apos;s not good enough for you to say to your child, `Do good in school,&apos; and then when that child comes home, you got the TV set on, you got the radio on, you don&apos;t check their homework, there is not a book in the house, you&apos;ve got the video game playing.&quot;

OK. OK. I give! I&apos;ll call it parents being advised to reform.

 HAITI SHOULD HELP US TEACH OUR CHILDREN 

 Published On 01-23-2010 , 10:32 PM 

AS a kid growing up during World War II, I didn&apos;t understand my mother&apos;s constant commentary about the hungry children in Europe. Fact is, I didn&apos;t really understand anything about Europe and the battles being waged there. And hungry children were as foreign, to me, as the bombing of Pearl Harbor.

 My sister and I both thought we were clever when we suggested our crust of bread we were leaving on our plate be boxed and mailed overseas.

Back in 1943, there were no television crews continually sending images of bombed cities, crumbling buildings or starving children. As I saw it, starving children was just a mechanism my mother thought might work to help us see how God had smiled on our household by providing food.

We said the same blessing before every meal:&quot;Lord, we thank you for this food, in Jesus&apos; name, amen.&quot;And every adult at the table - paternal grandmother, father and mother - didn&apos;t let us leave the table without our plates being clean.

 Were my mother&apos;s children thankful for their food? Did they care about the children in Europe?

 Are today&apos;s young people having it easier when it comes to understanding the plight of hungry children in Haiti? Why not? After all, they&apos;ve got constant news coverage of the earthquake disaster.

 Are today&apos;s young people feeling the pain of the injured and orphaned wandering the streets without anyone to provide care?

 As parents, we have a responsibility to help our children begin to understand what they&apos;re seeing and hearing on television. We need to emphasize how the whining we hear from them in no way measures up to the plight of the children in Haiti.

 While American parents are battling with funky teenage sons to take a shower, teenage boys in Haiti haven&apos;t had one in over a week and showers are probably not in the works anytime soon.

 While American daughters can&apos;t wear their purple sweater because they don&apos;t have any shoes to match, Haitian daughters wear what&apos;s on their back because that&apos;s all they&apos;ve got.

 Now is the time, if ever there was one, for all of us to realize how truly blessed we are. If we look at this continuous news coverage for more than the images and the on-the-spot reporting, there are plenty of important life lessons coming at us across the air waves.

 We will dig into our pockets and encourage our children to shake some coins from their piggybanks to send a family donation, large or small, to one of many Haiti relief funds and then say to ourselves,&quot;We&apos;ve done our part.&quot;

Maybe we&apos;ve been given a unique opportunity to correct the indulgences we&apos;ve ushered in as a way of life - no matter high income or low income. Is this tragedy a wake-up call for the rest of us?

 How many parents will take to heart what nonsense it is for their daughter to want more shoes, when the kids in Haiti are losing their feet?

How to raise grateful American children who understand they are blessed? I don&apos;t believe, even though our children have visual images of the suffering, that the lesson is going to be learned any better than what my mother&apos;s speech about the children in Europe accomplished.

My sister and I thought making a donation of bread crust was a smart retort. I suspect today&apos;s children will think pretty much the same.

If only there were the opportunities to round up our nation&apos;s ungrateful young&apos;uns and airlift them to Haiti and for each one we drop, we bring back a Haitian youngster. Don&apos;t suggest what I wouldn&apos;t be willing to do myself? You&apos;re right! But my 18-year-old would be the first kid on the American helicopter.

 SHIRLEE IS THE KEYNOTE SPEAKER:HAVE WE ARRIVED? 

 Published On 01-17-2010 , 7:53 AM 

I&apos;M not too sure that the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday on Monday will help the public see the light. While it is the only national holiday honoring an African American,&quot;Uh, who?&quot;comes the quick response from our black, white and brown young people. Give `em a long stare mention Martin&apos;s name and then the response becomes,&quot;Oh, yeah, yeah, that guy.&quot;

To be fair about the matter, a mention of Presidents Day, celebrating Abraham Lincoln and George Washington, would probably draw pretty much of the same commentary.

 I did a Jay Leno&quot;Man on the Street&quot;kind of survey the other day at a McDonald&apos;s where high school kids were stopping in on their way home from school. Surprisingly, there was some amount of knowledge expressed when I asked why no school on Monday.

 &quot;King had a dream. No, a speech about a dream,&quot;followed by chuckles.

&quot;We&apos;re honoring whatever he did a long time ago.&quot;

&quot;How much time do you have, `cause I can tell you?&quot;

 Does it really matter that the nation is honoring an African American? Who do my people think they are that this day should be for one of them? This holiday is for everyone. Trouble is too many of my people don&apos;t know who they are and when it comes to Martin Luther King Jr. - not the man but his deeds - we can more quickly talk about and identify with Kobe Bryant and Beyonce.

 Sports and entertainment have for years, now, replaced the quest for equality and civil rights that King and so many others fought for. Black folk have arrived. We&apos;ve won the battle. Racism doesn&apos;t exist. Opportunity is ours. The dream, whatever it was, has become a reality. Whatever reason should anyone harp on the past and dig up what used to be?

 Black folks have arrived. We&apos;ve got a black family in the White House. We lined up at the polls, marked our ballots when the sun was just coming up. We cheered and celebrated when the results came that night in November of 2008. Millions of black folk braved the cold to see for themselves America&apos;s first black president&apos;s inauguration.

 Down the freeway in Los Angeles on Monday there will be a parade on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard sponsored, in part, by the Congress of Racial Equality.

In Pasadena, at Jackie Robinson Park on North Fair Oaks Avenue, is an event sponsored by the Martin Luther King Community Coalition, with student essay contest winners, speeches and church choirs.

Celebrations are going on everywhere and they are not happening because King&apos;s fight has been won or because black folk have arrived. Instead they are happening to provide opportunities to renew the commitment, to renew the struggle and to assess the gains.

 &quot;Making The Dream A Reality&quot;is the theme at the Jackie Robinson Park event and as the keynote speaker, I don&apos;t plan to pull any punches when it comes to helping those in attendance recognize Barack Obama in the White House is not a case of the referee counting to 10 and signaling that black folk have scored a knock out.

This event begins at 8:30 a.m. with breakfast and a film. Program begins at 10 a.m. See you there.

 IVANA DESERVES PROPS, NOT CUFFS 

 Published On 01-02-2010 , 6:45 PM 

WITH Nigerian terrorist, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, padding his undies with enough explosives to take down American Airlines flight 231 from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas Day, I would have thought Ivana Trump would have been seen as heroic when, just a day after this incident, she acted to protect her fellow first-class passengers on a flight from Palm Beach International Airport to New York City.

 Not quite the case. Ivana, unlike the passenger on the Amsterdam flight who tackled Umar and is now being heralded as a person exhibiting a high level of personal responsibility, she&apos;s being called an erratic troublemaker.

This 60-year-old socialite did what many irresponsible citizens fail to do whether riding on a plane, shopping in a supermarket or dining in a restaurant and, for this, security removed her from the flight. Ivana reportedly screamed at some misbehaving children who were running in the aisle of the plane as though, I suspect, they might do at a local park or in their own back yards.

 Further, it is said that she also cursed at a baby who continually cried - crying perhaps due to a load of human explosives packed in the underwear, which the parents neglected to detect much like the lack of security commitment in Amsterdam.

While&quot;childhood terrorist&quot;are in no way as dangerous or as menacing as those, like Umar, who act with the intent of taking out human life, they most certainly should be contained, watched and monitored as they are, indeed, a threat to a person&apos;s peace and tranquility.

I do not understand why Ivana was escorted from the airplane and not the parents and their unruly children. News reports say Ivana was asked to calm down but instead she became belligerent.

Oh!

 Belligerence should not trump unruly children. Why didn&apos;t the other passengers join the responsible one in trying to make the flight a peaceful one? Why didn&apos;t the flight attendant do something about children using the aisle as their personal playground? With or without explosives concealed in its underwear, a crying baby is a heck of an attack on a passenger&apos;s right to the pursuit of peaceful flight.

 Before I&apos;m accused of telling only half a story, let me add that Ivana, the ex-wife of Donald Trump, also cursed and screamed at crew members and other passengers and she turned down the opportunity to voluntarily get off the plane.

 I wasn&apos;t there. I didn&apos;t witness the incident, but the news reports haven&apos;t offered up enough to convince me that the culprit in this scenario was the somebody who was&quot;angered,&quot;the descriptive word others used, by bad kids.

 It&apos;s high time airport officials do their real job of sniffing out terrorists who board planes with the intent of bringing them down and stop roughing up old women who don&apos;t like crying babies and misbehaving kids. I hope Ms. Ivana sues the pants off of all those airline employees and security folk who treated her with such disrespect for simply having acted in a responsible manner.

 THE ANSWER IS BLOWING IN THE WIND 

 Published On 12-28-2009 , 9:06 AM 

SO much for us to be grateful for in a year when prosperity for so many friends, relatives and fellow countrymen is hard to come by.

To have awakened Christmas morning in a house with a roof that wasn&apos;t leaking, with company coming for dinner or an invitation to celebrate the holiday at someone else&apos;s table was truly a blessing.

To have watched the youngsters gleefully snatching and then opening their presents from under the tree is a memory to cherish. Grabbing the digital camera and catching these memories, downloading them into the computer and then sending them to everyone no matter where they live - near or far - is truly a bit of technological genius.

 Grandparents, those who&apos;ve bitten the bullet and joined the computer age, marveled at their ability to press a button or two and have the younguns,teenagers, toddlers and newly arrived infants staring at them from their own homes but now on laptop, desktop or from those other newfangled screens.

 What did you get for Christmas?

Tuning my ear to the wind, as the old folks in my family called it, I continually hear a different answer blowing around and the message I&apos;m catching isn&apos;t just coming from those who&apos;ve lived long enough to collect enough gifts to stock their own small store, but it is coming from many families with young crumb-snatchers.

 Christmas had a new meaning in a lot of households. From the sound of things, this great holiday may well be returning to days of old.

 &quot;Spending time together was our goal,&quot;said one mother of teenage girls who reported the days of new clothes, accessories and trinkets had given way to absolutely no presents. Instead it&apos;s about having shopped for the dinner and spending Christmas morning preparing it, which mom always did by herself while the&quot;girls&quot;opened, swooned, tried on and then modeled their new stuff.

 &quot;My husband had to work, so it was going to be a pretty quiet day around the house, but last week my 13-year-old suggested we volunteer for the morning at one of the shelters and that&apos;s what we did,&quot;reported another head of family seeing the holiday with a different spirit than how it once was.

 Christmas at her house, this mom reported, has always been a huge self-centered experience. While the younger child had a million questions about them volunteering, she was happy to answer all that she could, but the experience itself, she said, settled for him the good of giving help to others.

 Christmas has passed, but we aren&apos;t yet through with ourselves. The end of the year is closing in and the resolutions we quietly make are waiting to be finalized. Will we change the course of history - our own and our children&apos;s? If I read the wind correctly, the answer is blowing in a historical direction.

 Happy New Year!

 &quot;WHAT&apos;S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT?&quot; 

 Published On 12-19-2009 , 7:52 PM 

Thanks to Elin Woods, Tammy Wynette&apos;s record-breaking 1968 country tune,&quot;Stand By Your Man&quot;has found a resting place.

&quot;Surely you can find something in the Tiger Woods story that relates to parenting,&quot;was the terse post on my Facebook page following last week&apos;s writing that I thought would clarify my position with the ongoing saga of the golfer&apos;s infidelity.

 So this piece is bowing to public pressure as I continually hear from readers. While the majority of the correspondence thanks me for not adding another voice to the story and a telephone call from a neighbor from long ago in Boyle Heights said she was&quot;grateful&quot;for my stance, here I am lending my voice to a wife who is exhibiting Tina Turner&apos;s&quot;What&apos;s Love Got To Do With It&quot;philosophy.

 As the mother of five daughters, I applaud the spunk of Elin, the former Swedish model and au pair, who married the golfer in October 2004 and is now the mother of his two children. I&apos;m pretty tired of philandering husbands with wives, including Hillary Clinton, standing by their side. I suspect the stance of women who do this has more to do with advantages and positioning than it has to do with love.

 As for Elin, walking away with more millions than this low-income writer knows how to count, the advantage and positioning don&apos;t add up to staying with the player who has, as folk on my side of town would say, dissed her. Is it the millions of dollars that drive my viewpoint on this matter? Where&apos;s the parenting lesson I&apos;ve been challenged to find?

 At this time of year, long, long ago, one of my daughters was dropped at my house in the early afternoon of a very bad weather day while her then live-in boyfriend drove to San Diego to deliver a Christmas present to his son. Mr. A said he would make a turn-around and be back within a few hours to enjoy Christmas festivities at my home.

 As the day wore into night, as the rain poured and lightning flashed and long after all of the other guests had packed up their gifts and left, daughter began to cry hysterically and made the mistake of asking me what I thought of her significant other. Before answering, I did warn her that she might not want to hear my very honest position. She was in a weak and vulnerable position, and let me add she had just recently been discharged from the hospital following back surgery.

What did I think of Mr. A? Well, it wasn&apos;t Mr. A who my thoughts centered on. The problem was my daughter, who put up with his escapades time and time again. I drove her home while the storm was still raging. He returned from San Diego and his ex-wife three days later.

 I don&apos;t know what lessons Elin&apos;s mom, Barbara Holmberg, a politician, preached to her daughter, but this young lady most certainly has not stood by her philandering man nor should the rest of our daughters. I&apos;m humming Tina&apos;s&quot;What&apos;s Love Got to do With It&quot;and my daughters, all of them, are joining in.

 Mr. A? Of course he kept up his nonsense with a host of other women. And then one day, after devoting 15 years of her youth, my daughter walked away from a life of material comforts she thought were so important that she stayed with the jerk.

 NOT TAKING THE TIGER BY HIS TAIL 

 Published On 12-12-2009 , 6:46 PM 


THE big question I get from readers these days is,&quot;What about Tiger Woods?&quot;It is my practice to respond to every e-mail or snail-mailed letter that I receive.

Most folk who&apos;ve been following my parent missives through the years know pretty much what kind of issues I prefer to comment on. Others, and certainly those who want to hear my take on the golf great, haven&apos;t as yet found my rhythm.

Asked one e-mailer, whom I haven&apos;t answered yet,&quot;Are you ignoring what you ought to be writing about because you maybe think it is a bad something for an African-American woman to write about?&quot;

I am not assigned a topic nor am I assigned what point of view to take on the topic, which I have chosen for the week.

In the early days, back to the `70s , when I wrote a column in the Pasadena Star-News the topics would be classified as social issues, which is very broad and might have encompassed a point of view on the current Tiger Woods media nonsense.

For some years I did not have a column, but when I returned about five years ago, the category I pitched to the editors was parenting. My chosen topics in this category are quite often a news story involving families.

Another misnomer about this golden opportunity, I have, of sharing my views in the newspaper , is that I was selected from a pool of talented journalists with fancy degrees from places like USC, where I&apos;m frequently called an alum simply because I&apos;ve lived in Los Angeles County all my life.

Do not ask me to explain how our members of the public come to make assumptions of this kind.

I have a degree in sociology from UCLA. But how did the newspaper pick me? It didn&apos;t. Back in the day I began by writing (constant) letters to the editor. One day, at a luncheon held at Brookside Clubhouse, I sat next to the late Charles Cherniss, the former Star-News editor, and I mentioned I would like to write a column.

His response:&quot;Send me 10 and we&apos;ll see about that.&quot;I took him 10, within two days, and was told that he gave me his standard response but I was the first to step up to the challenge.

Why have I come back to write about parenting and how do I pick what to write? Parents are pretty much an ignored bunch of people when it comes to their trials, tribulations, faults, successes, dreams and points of view. While I certainly don&apos;t represent all of the above, I write to provide my commonsense approach to issues that parents face.

Picking the week&apos;s topic is no easy matter. I keep my ear to the wind - listen hard and concentrate steadily on what I hear parents talking about. I depend on the news and develop an angle that hasn&apos;t been presented, which usually turns into the commonsense angle. Also, readers make suggestions and I follow up on those.

Let me add, the editors of the paper who run my column (which becomes this blog on my website) hold the power of rejection! But thus far, every topic has passed muster - or, more to the point, has passed the current editor&apos;s scrutiny. This doesn&apos;t mean the paper shares my views.


And, here on the webisite, you&apos;ve got the instant opportunity to include your reponse. The newspaper readers have to send in an email and hope and wait for it to be printed.

Here on the website there ain&apos;t no oversight and no one who can decide NOT to run what I write!

 PARENTING ADVICE? MAYBE. 

 Published On 11-22-2009 , 4:51 PM 

If my usual parenting advice is what readers are looking for, this column may not quite hit the mark. Well, maybe some insights into the mighty responsibility of raising young&apos;uns:
As my married daughter and parent of two sons recently said during a telephone conversation that hit on inappropriate childhood behavior - attitudes never straightened out that morph into inappropriate adult lifestyles -&quot;Some kids are just left to grow and others get raised.&quot;

I call her comments insights. I don&apos;t think of them as advice because what she&apos;s laid down doesn&apos;t actually supply the one, two, three of how to raise kids.

I don&apos;t suspect too many folks think of me as a Dear Abby. If called anything, the name game would probably put me closer to&quot;That Shirlee.&quot;
 Jen and Barb invited me to fill their TV guest spot on&quot;The Jen and Barb Show&quot;to provide advice on children&apos;s bedtime. 
They were warned by me that I wasn&apos;t really what they wanted. They insisted. When all was said and done, there were no feelings of&quot;Dear&quot;;&quot;That Shirlee&quot;was most surely the final result. 
No, I&apos;m not too hard on myself. I saw the final version of the show and most of me was left on the edit room floor.

Does this column dispense advice or does it provide a common-sense approach to raising children instead of letting them just grow on their own?

Such was the problem with the&quot;How to Get Your Kids To Bed&quot;episode.

A philosophical common-sense approach to raising children encompasses bedtime, health, education, honesty, discipline and everything else associated with producing children who become responsible adults.

Not enough parents are willing to stop to make an honest assessment of their own rules and recognize it isn&apos;t someone else&apos;s advice that&apos;s needed.

Instead, what&apos;s necessary is for them to establish their very own concrete development plan.

Back in the day, parents were advised to let their babies cry. Then a complete turnaround from the so-called experts said never just let the baby cry.

What to do when depending upon the so-called parenting experts?

School officials advise parents to help Julio and Johnny with their schoolwork and to be involved with the classroom teacher. Health officials advise regular trips to the pediatrician and to make sure Tamika and Rosella have their immunizations.
 This is clearly advice based on sound research. 
Neither Jen nor Barb will be able to brand me responsible when, in later years, their or their viewers offprings&apos; therapists tie the prevailing troublesome mental health issues to bedtime advice provided by&quot;That Shirlee.&quot;

Bedtime? Establish one and stick to it. Maybe my kind of talk is just plain ol’common sense that some people want to call advice.

 XMAS GIFTS YOUR KIDS WILL CRY FOR 

 Published On 11-19-2009 , 10:40 AM 

I am not the Grinch and this blog most certainly is not about
stealing Christmas. Having said that, readers are most likely set for
some kind of non-traditional nonsense that only The Captain, as one of
my daughter&apos;s boyfriends named me, would put forth in print.

In Dr. Seuss&apos;s&quot;The Grinch Who Stole Christmas,&quot;little Cindy and all
of the Whoville inhabitants rejoice and exhibite the holiday spirit
even though the green guy with the Santa outfit had packed his sled
and
driven off with all of their gifts he&apos;d gone down the chimneys and
stolen from under their decorated trees.

In life, people in America have seen much harder times. While there&apos;s
bound to be some adjustments needed in many households this year and
while the troublesome economy is the back story to our money
troubles,
sometime limited amounts of cash and closed credit are actually
blessings in disguise.

Once upon a time, right here in America - the land of milk and honey -
parents didn&apos;t pack so many gifts under the decorated tree that their
children spent most of the morning unwrapping them rather than
enjoying
them.

Once upon a time, right here in America - in a place called Terry,
Miss. - my friend told me she and the rest of the kids in the family
got a fresh apple on the big morning. That was it. That was their
Christmas and they were thankful.

Just a few years ago, right here in the land of the Rose Parade- a
place called Pasadena, another friend was troubled because after her
son opened up all of his gifts, and the electronic gadget he had
wanted
so badly wasn&apos;t in the collection, he went to bed crying.

Mom needed all of her friends to help because her trouble stemmed from
her having looked everywhere for the gadget but it was sold out. She
was asking me to please, if I heard of anywhere it was in stock, to
let
her know, as the boy really had to have one.

This year news reports tell us favorite toys and gadgets will not
remain on the store shelves very long because merchants are stocking
smaller numbers of items so gift givers will need to shop early.

Well I haven&apos;t found any grocers warning that apples will not be
available in the produce section. This past week, fresh crisp Fujis
were only 58 cents per pound at Food 4 Less, and at Smart and Final,
Red Delicious apples were three pounds for just $1.49.

Of course there are the other regulars we know of such as Granny Smith
and Golden Delicious; in fact, there are over 7,000 varieties of
apples
throughout the world.

I suspect my friend Arlene from Mississippi more than likely had one
of
the apples we&apos;re all pretty familiar with - but the McClain clan,
about
a dozen kids, were all thankful.

Am I advising apples instead of gadgets this year? Well, back to the
concept of lack of cash, no credit and blessings in disguise. Giving
apples does fit the concept. Also, the many varieties of this fruit
gives the giver a unique shopping experience when it comes to
selection: size, shape, sweet, tart, crisp or even soft, and it gives
the ungrateful child recipient the chance to have a tantrum and to, we
can only hope, stay in bed for the day, having cried their self to
sleep.

Signed, The Captain

 PARENTS ARE THE TEACHER OF THE YEAR 

 Published On 10-31-2009 , 9:28 PM 


ON Nov. 3, Tuesday coming up, remember to vote and remember to take the kids with you to your polling place.

If you&apos;ve voted by mail, I sure hope you included the youngsters, well, teenagers too, in the process.

My neighbor, seeing a local candidate&apos;s lawn sign at my house, wanted to know,&quot;Yo, what&apos;s up with this?&quot;

Quiet as it may be kept, in communities across the nation, it is time once again to act as involved and responsible citizens.

VOTE!

But why involve the children who aren&apos;t eligible to mark a ballot before they are 18 years old and registered to vote?

But they can vote and the little ones are thrilled with the opportunity. Polling places have a practice machine and while the&quot;pretend ballot&quot;doesn&apos;t make it into the all-important ballot box, youngsters enjoy the exercise in democracy.

Do the kids actually know what they&apos;re doing? Well, that depends on their age and the household environment we parents provide.

Will teens actually be willing to accompany a parent to the polls? How many of us vote before heading to the job site or vote heading back home at the end of the workday?

The big thought is how many of us drop a teen at the school campus in the morning and may well pick them up at the end of the day?

As parents, we know that willingness is all too often a concept quite foreign in the life of those between the ages of - readers, please put in your own numbers on this one.

Exercises in the democratic process are something we owe our children long before the concept gets presented to them in school.

While&quot;My house, my rules&quot;ought to be the order of things; democracy should have a place in every household allowing children to help make decisions with their vote.

Conversation at the family dinner table can most certainly include some vocabulary building activity that would include candidate, ballot box, election, registrar of voters, register to vote, politician and the list goes on.

The women&apos;s suffrage movement gets a big round of discussion, and why not have the teenagers, who spend so much time on the Internet, anyway, do a little research and lead some dinnertime conversation with their findings?

When did African Americans gain the right to vote and what did they do to gain this right?

With this type of conversation, the kids will undoubtedly mutter their universal and often heard comment:&quot;Boring.&quot;

But it&apos;s not our job as parents to be the entertainer of the year. It&apos;s our job to prepare our children for the responsibility of adulthood.

It&apos;s our job to run our household in a manner that recognizes we, as parents, are the first teacher - we should be the teacher of the year.

Find out everything you need to know - so you can tell it to the kids - by visiting The League of Women Voters-sponsored website at www.smartvote.org .

Oh, and there&apos;s room at your polling place for strollers - your children are never too young to go with you on election day.

 MY SISTER BEVERLEE BRUCE 

 Published On 09-19-2009 , 10:57 PM 


My earliest memory of my big sister Beverlee Bruce is that of total trust, admiration and constantly being cheated out of my Chocoletto candies.

But with the telephone call last Sunday from NYPD precinct No. 32 that delivered that message that no one wants to get, the funny Chocoletto story, along with the trust and admiration, took on new meaning.

Beverlee Bruce - Pudge, as I called her - has passed away. Transitioned, as some refer to it. But no matter the phrasing, she isn&apos;t with us anymore.

What happened? People from places all over the world, where she has traveled, are asking that question. We only know that she was found on the floor of her Harlem apartment.

Bruce, as I also called her, was in Pasadena last year and attended a Michelle Obama event.

Politics and academics were her lifelong forte. She began by being a favorite of her teachers in elementary school because she always worked hard and did well. Later, at Roosevelt High School in Los Angeles, she always held a student body office.

I tried to be the copycat little sister. Well, not when it came to working hard and doing well in school, and because of this teachers were extremely disappointed in what they must have thought should be a family tradition.

But when it came to school politics, I was a winning candidate on any ballot, simply, I confess, because the name Pickett (and it didn&apos;t matter which one) was already established.
 Copycat? 
She got married. I got married. She had one kid, I had a houseful, and that&apos;s when I became Shirlee and not Beverlee&apos;s little sister. She went the academic route and I took the parenting path.

She&apos;s gone too soon, many of her friends have said. Well, she did claim she would live to be 100, but it seems she missed her mark by 26 years. And as my mother would say,&quot;Oh, not in charge, eh?&quot;

Too soon? Not by Beverlee&apos;s long list of accomplishments. The following is an excerpt from the tribute the International Rescue Committee she served on will place in The New York Times:

&quot;Beverlee Bruce was a social anthropologist, development specialist and educator with significant experience in Africa and the Caribbean, where she designed, implemented and evaluated rural community development projects. She served in Liberia as U.S. Peace Corps director and as chief technical advisor for the United Nations Self-Help Village Development Project. She taught at the City University of New York, Temple, Harvard - where she earned her Ph.D. - Northeastern and Howard universities as well as at the University of Massachusetts, UCLA, the University of Liberia, Marymount Manhattan College and Wellesley College. She had also served as a program director at the Social Science Research Council. At the time of her death she was on leave from the Center for the Study of Ethnicity and Race at Columbia University.

&quot;Beverlee joined the Women&apos;s Commission Board in 1991. On becoming its chair in 1995, she joined the IRC board, serving until 2007, when she became an Overseer. She was for a number of years chair of the Program Committee, and in that role provided invaluable advice to members of the IRC&apos;s program staff and frequently visited IRC programs around the world.&quot;

Now, about the famous Chocoletto story that is known word by word by every member of our family, looks like I&apos;ll have to save it for my tribute at Bruce&apos;s memorial service, to be held in early October.

 THE STAPLES CENTER - WHAT ABOUT THE MONEY SPENT? 

 Published On 07-07-2009 , 11:23 PM 

I’ve been telling the kid in my household the American economy is in a downward spiral and everything we do and don&apos;t do, nowadays, will represent this fact of life.

She tries to understand.

On a daily basis, there are issues covered by the media that support what I’ve been preaching, and for the families my non-profit organization works with who have lost jobs, who have had to move in with relatives because they&apos;ve lost homes and who have been forced to feed their children by lining up at soup kitchens, they don&apos;t need news coverage to help them with reality.

In the midst of this financial downturn we have“Remembering Michael Jackson,”the Los Angeles Staples Center super colossal event.

All that money - the taxpayers&apos;, the Jackson family&apos;s and wherever other funds came from is just astounding.

Will the talking heads who represent the worldwide media outlets that covered this massive display of money call this as it is? Or will they conjure up the explanation that their coverage and the millions of dollars spent are simply a response to public emotion and demand?

Calling it for what it is won’t be easy.

That Michael Jackson was loved for his talent and for his contribution to the entertainment industry is indisputable. From all over the world his fans came to Los Angeles by the thousands for the purpose of saying goodbye to an icon.

The Andre Crouch Gospel Choir singing&quot;Going to See the King,&quot;and the opening words of Rev. Lucious Smith of Pasadena&apos;s oldest African-American church, Friendship Baptist, set this truly remarkable and well-arranged Hollywood production into a funeral mode.

Complaints? What about the money spent?
Criticism? But it was a respectful, well planed and well executed event.

But my last week’s newspaper column on the King of Pop’s death drew criticism from many readers because I said for my young African-American children who grew up in the `70s, Michael Jackson was their Barack Obama. This was true for many young African-Americans of that era.

But now, for my youngest daughter who has come of age with the historical election of an African-American president of the United States of America, who attended that presidential inauguration, this&quot;Remembering Michael Jackson&quot;event has indeed amplified another aspect of the historical significance of who her people are.

The homeless? The foreclosed homes just down the street and around the corner from where so many of us live? The constantly climbing jobless rate? The tight budgets so many of us have been forced to put in place?

The reality in life is that entertainment is something completely different from our day-to-day grind.

Entertainment is the chance to pack up our troubles and leave the worries behind.

Was the Michael Jackson Remembrance worth the money spent? Should the dollars have been given to homeless shelters, soup kitchens and individuals who are in foreclosure?

For the critics, I ask, what other kind of memorial would have been fit for the King of Pop? What other kind of event should  have been televised around the world?

Was the remembrance entertainment or was it the traditional final farewell? 

Maybe it was a little of both, but for those few hours at The Staples Center, those who watched most probably weren’t thinking about their current economic status.

People got to pack up their troubles, put away somewhere and join in the celebration of Michael Jackson’s life.

As my budget-conscious teenager said about the Obama inauguration that we attended back in January,&quot;What a great big show with a budget I don&apos;t know how to figure out. But anyway, are we paying for it?&quot;

 MICHAEL JACKSON KING -WHAT ABOUT POP? 

 Published On 07-05-2009 , 10:23 AM 

WHILE many folks feel we&apos;ve had more than too much of the Michael Jackson coverage, with all aspects of the King of Pop&apos;s life being repeatedly pored over by the media, I&apos;m pretty much like so many people I’ve heard from who are awaiting the somebody who will put an end to the shameful reporting, mainly speculation, regarding the biological origin of the man&apos;s children.

Often when a person dies, no matter how awful the deeds they may have committed during their lifetime, there seems always to be a grace period where all we hear is the good.

This kind of grace period has prompted many a joke. In my family, the one that passes down through the generations is about the widow who, with her children, sat in the first row of pews in the small Baptist church listening to her late husband&apos;s eulogy.

By the time the presenter had spent a good 15 minutes preaching, the mother nudged one of her sons and whispered,&quot;Willie, Willie, tip up there and see if that&apos;s yo’daddy in that casket.&quot;

No such eulogies being delivered on this deathwatch by news people eager to uncover any clue that might help them show that Jackson doesn&apos;t truly have any little Willies.

Most of us have heard more Baby Mama and Baby Daddy dramas then we actually want to admit to, and for all of them that we&apos;re acquainted with, the bottom line is always the same: It is the children who suffer.

The media needs to leave the children out of their witch hunt.

I don&apos;t believe Prince Michael, Paris and Prince Michael II, who is also known as Blanket, are following news reports and are now saddened and troubled because they&apos;ve learned that Michael Jackson may not be their dad.

But I do believe there are multitudes of children throughout the world who have believed one person was their biological father when in reality it was only mom who knew the real truth to be otherwise.

All children deserve respect - they are not responsible for the deeds of their parents.

I don&apos;t believe the public&apos;s right to know trumps the Jackson children&apos;s right to privacy. I do believe Jackson&apos;s mother, who may well be the person to have permanent custody of these children, is the person with the responsibility, when and if she determines it should be done, to tell them of circumstances surrounding their birth.

How dare members of the media take it upon themselves to work at uncovering that which is not news but is instead hurtful and damaging to the innocent?

Is Michael Jackson really the pop? Did Debbie Rowe, the alleged mother of Michael&apos;s two oldest children, undergo artificial insemination? Was the sperm donor her old boss, Michael&apos;s dermatologist? If Jackson wasn&apos;t the biological father, shouldn&apos;t he have legally adopted these kids? Do the kids look anything like African-American people are part of their ancestry? Does the public really have a right to know?

It doesn&apos;t matter how these questions are answered. We can look around and find lots of families and raise lots of questions about them. But we don&apos;t do that because it isn&apos;t our business.

And the media? It isn&apos;t their business, either.

 JACKSON WAS OUR BARACK OBAMA OF THE 70&apos;s 

 Published On 06-26-2009 , 11:54 PM 

Seems just about everyone has something to say about the death of Michael Jackson.

Not only does everyone have something to say, but we are also being fed first-hand accounts from his fans as to how they came to love Michael and follow his every move.

While few have been able to conquer the young man&apos;s moves, we&apos;ve all, young and old, black and white, marveled at how a body could do what this super talent did with his.

Like the others, I&apos;m going to add my story to the list of tales being told.

The Jackson Five was how my children came to meet Michael. Well, not personal or up close, but close enough, because we decided the dynamic kid with his kinky hair combed high on his head looked pretty much like our 3-year-old Pia.

Living in the UCLA Married Student Housing during the 70s, there weren&apos;t many around who looked like us. And there were even fewer who looked like our baby girl who, while she probably didn&apos;t look like Michael, but her hair sure did. 

So when the kids in our courtyard would ask Pia about her hair - back then there weren&apos;t too many little kids with piled high kinky locks called a natural - we told her to answer,&quot;I&apos;m like Michael Jackson.&quot;

Those were the days. The Jackson Five days. My son, Paul, even had one of those vests like the famous brothers wore with the extra-long fringe at the bottom hemline. Paul&apos;s was purple suede with really, really long pieces hanging from the waist to the bottom hemline.

The Jackson Five were just about everywhere we went. Or maybe we went anywhere we could find them. Way beyond my slim budget, I scrimped on other things and bought box seats at the Hollywood Bowl and took all of my five kids to see the young group.

Then there was Africa.

The lyrics,&quot;A, B, C, 1, 2, 3, you and me,&quot;blasted off the 45 rpm record at a home in Accra, Ghana when, with my oldest daughter and I visited there in 1972.

The hospitable young teenager, in an effort to entertain my daughter when we had been invited to her home for dinner, asked what records Pamela would like to hear.

Pamela, being equally as well mannered, said it didn&apos;t really matter and the choice should be that of our host. But later she told me she was prepared to hear that&quot;awful African Highlife music&quot;she hated.

What words filled that living room so way across the world on another continent?&quot;It&apos;s easy as 1, 2, 3, that&apos;s how easy love can be.&quot;It was the Jackson&apos;s&quot;ABC,&quot;spinning on the record players so very far from home.

But just like a typical American in a foreign land, my astonished daughter said,&quot;But just how did you get that? How do you know about the Jackson Five?&quot;

He was just a kid and Michael Jackson with his unbelievable talent was breaking boundaries and creating magic. Michael was, for my children, the Barack Obama of the `70s. We smiled when we saw him. We danced to his melodies and he made us proud to be who we were. And for my youngest little girl, Pia, it made her hairstyle the best one in the sand box over there in the UCLA Married Student Apartments on Sepulveda in West Los Angeles.

While our box seats so long ago at the Hollywood Bowl don’t equal our very recent standing on our feet for hours at Obama&apos;s inauguration, young Michael Jackson was a source of pride who sent my children the message:&quot;You can do it.&quot;

 LAPD DETECTIVE STEPHANIE LAZARUS - GETTING AWAY WITH MURDER? 

 Published On 06-14-2009 , 12:59 AM 


THE recent arrest of veteran LAPD Detective Stephanie Lazarus for the 1986 murder of Sherri Rasmussen on the surface doesn&apos;t have anything to do with parenting.

But these days, in just about every hot news story that hits the airwaves and printed pages, there exists a golden opportunity to preach the gospel to the kids we&apos;re in charge of raising, and this cold-case story offers up a whole lot of conversation.

As a youngster, when my parents confronted me for one of my many wrongful deeds, they frequently felt compelled to start their too-long lecture with,&quot;You probably thought you&apos;d gotten away with murder - but not in this house!&quot;

I hadn&apos;t pulled a trigger or bludgeoned anyone to death, as Lazarus is accused of doing, but my folks were busy establishing notice that deeds don&apos;t go undetected and while all of the evidence may not have been available to them at the time of my misstep, time would prove to be the condemning factor.

&quot;Ugh, she&apos;s a sicko,&quot;remarked my teenager as we watched news coverage of Lazarus appearing in court wearing her orange jail suit.

&quot;Why would she do something so mean and, yeah, she thought she got away with it,&quot;said my teenager, who wasn&apos;t looking for an answer and who was probably hoping I wouldn&apos;t offer up some conversation on murdering one&apos;s romantic rival.

While it appears there are many factors contributing to Lazarus allegedly getting away with murdering her ex-boyfriend&apos;s wife,
Sherri, the story also has many lessons worth preaching about. But for me, the sermon is this: Time is the condemning factor, but jealousy and rivalry both offer the opportunity for serious discussion.

Cheating on the history exam may not be detected when the test is taken, but what did the student get away with when it came to knowing the subject matter?

Parents work to help their children recognize there is so much more to the game than winning, more to the class than having the grade they didn&apos;t earn and, as authorities allege in the case of Detective Lazarus, a better way to life than killing off the competition.

Remember Tonya Harding, the figure skater who in 1994 conspired, just before the Olympic Winter Games, to have someone injure skater Nancy Kerrigan so she couldn&apos;t compete? Harding got her comeuppance when she was banned for life by The U.S. Figure Skating Association.

Jealousy and rivalry seem to be imbedded in this column no matter how hard I stress the lesson of time being the condemning factor.

I admit both can cause anti-social actions, but, parents, when it comes to delivering the important lesson of&quot;do wrong and you&apos;ll be caught in the long run,&quot;we&apos;re preaching about more than these two factors.

Cheating on the history exam has little to do with either of these. In my book, they have more to do with the desire to do wrong and get away with it.

I think it helps our young people understand more than just the difference between right and wrong when we promise them they aren&apos;t going to get away with murder in our house or in the broader society.

 AMERICA&apos;S KILLING FIELDS 

 Published On 05-23-2009 , 11:33 PM 

The names? Can&apos;t remember. Doesn&apos;t so much matter, anyway, because there are so many and by the time this column gets into print there will be many more added to the list.

Where did it happen? That doesn&apos;t matter so much, either, because it happens everywhere and by the time you read this a street corner in another city somewhere across America will bare witness to the on-going slaughter.

At every crime scene there&apos;ll be a make-shift memorial with stuffed animals, flowers, candles and pictures of the victim - a vibrant and smiling very young black man.

Sometime the victim will be presented to us in his evening best - maybe it is a rental, it being a recent photo from his high school prom.

Another scene will provide the on-lookers photos of the young black male victim in livelier days standing with his&quot;homies&apos; flashing gang signs.

News reporters at the crime scene operate from the same script - no matter which city. No matter which victim. No matter which makeshift memorial is in the background.

The public is fed weeping testimonials from relatives - mom, if they can get her on camera. Then there are the voices from the community, people who are fed up with the violence in the neighborhood demanding something be done.

Are the men who pull the trigger, whether police officers, rival gang members or just dummes with a gun, part of a widespread fraudulent insurance scheme?

&quot;My baby was just standin&apos; at the bus stop and they shot him dead,&quot;says one tearful mom.

Another one, not tearful at all, swinging her umbrella at reporters in front of a courthouse, yells and screams,&quot;My boy didn&apos;t do it!&quot;

Who did do it?

And who are we expecting to clean up our American killing fields?

The feds busted up organized crime, didn&apos;t they? I remember being glued to our 1950s television screen watching Elliot Ness and the&quot;Untouchables&quot;clean up cities all across America.

Most surely, states now have commissions that are charged with studying the problem and making recommendations.

At the local level, mayors hold press conferences regarding the positive direction their forces are moving in, while the next news segment provides us with yet another dead body.

The community activists, though they march and demand something be done, don&apos;t actually seem to know what to do.

Then there are the weeping relatives of the victims and the belligerent relatives of the perpetrators of the crime.

The media needs to stop parading the grieving families before the cameras, since most of them don&apos;t realize they are not obligated to provide interviews.

And the killers? There used to be a community service ad that said,&quot;Use a gun - go to jail.&quot;That doesn&apos;t mean much these days. So how about:&quot;Your kid uses a gun - you, too, go to jail.&quot;

 MOM&apos;S DAY BRUNCH OR WORLD PEACE 

 Published On 05-10-2009 , 8:56 AM 

This piece isn&apos;t going to be anywhere near what&apos;s generally written about Mother&apos;s Day celebrations. While mom often expects to receive presents and special treatment, this year, with an economy producing new horror stories by the day, a slightly different approach for us all just might be in order.

Will moms appreciate what I have to say? Will those who feel compelled to shower us with gifts take me to task? I suspect the answer to both questions to be a resounding yes.

But I also expect that after a few days, this predicted reaction from readers would give way to some additional thought about the matter.

There&apos;s a lot of folk who plain don&apos;t have the money they used to have and while they may still have an active credit card or two, good sense is screaming out in a loud reminder that&apos;s saying,&quot;Don&apos;t do it - not this year.&quot;

What about those who will claim they can&apos;t let go, even though they can&apos;t afford the traditional gathering at mom&apos;s favorite restaurant to gobble up the good stuff?

Maybe folks ought to try asking mom what her advice is when the going gets tough. Depending on her age, I suspect she&apos;s got some sage advice. Better yet, try asking Granma what she&apos;s got to say about credit card spending and going out to dinner when the next paycheck isn&apos;t guaranteed.

I suspect the gray-haired lady has plenty of chatter on this matter.

&quot;Credit cards?&quot;she&apos;s apt to screech and then launch into a story about revolving credit at the department store where you had to pay the entire balance when the statement came due and how not even Clifton&apos;s Cafeteria in downtown Los Angeles had such a thing as a credit card, even though it had a program to feed the poor.

Granny also knew a whole lot about living within one&apos;s means. But then who wants to listen to old folks when they talk that old-time stuff?

And old-time stuff can take us way back to 1870 with the country&apos;s first Mother&apos;s Day celebration, which was initiated by Julia Ward Howe. While it was about celebrating motherhood, it also focused on world peace.

A lot has changed since the 19th century. While we&apos;ve all helped tomorrow&apos;s holiday become a $14 billion industry, our current economic realities just might lead us back to the good old days.

Actually we haven&apos;t strayed that far in the 139 years since Howe got things going, because world peace is as elusive now as it was then. Back in 1870, history tells us Howe wanted mothers to protest the killing of each other&apos;s sons.

This Mother&apos;s Day, as they&apos;ve done for so many others, Code Pink, a women&apos;s peace group, will hold activities across the country calling for our troops to come home from Afghanistan and Iraq&quot;so that no more mothers will suffer the unbearable grief of losing a child to these wars.&quot;

In Washington, D.C Code Pink will bind knitted squares, made by women across the country, to form a quilt with the message&quot;We will not raise our children to kill another mother&apos;s child&quot;and string it on the White House fence. Then they&apos;ll circle the White House in a children&apos;s march for peace.

With our troublesome economy, perhaps former gift givers and the recipients can now put their focus on life - what I really believe is most important to all mothers. Where&apos;s the mother who wouldn&apos;t trade a present and an out-to-dinner treat for the life of a child - even if the economy was rocking?

 &quot;A KNOWN TROUBLEMAKER!&quot; 

 Published On 04-04-2009 , 6:29 PM 

  “That woman Shirlee Smith is a known troublemaker,”said the woman who was sitting at the table next to mine. It was a loud stage whisper, which was, I suspect, intended to be a quiet piece of information aimed to enlighten her companion who was perched in the seat next to her.
   If, before I left home that morning, I hadn’t practiced being on my best behavior, I would have turned around, given Ms a friendly smile, raised my fist in a black power salute and said,  “Right on Sister and power to the people.”
  Troublemaker? I hadn’t heard that one since my early days in Pasadena, back in 1967, when the PTA at Washington Elementary School wanted to know why I wore my hair in a natural/afro and referred to Negroes as African Americans.
   Fortunately for all concerned, I missed the meeting where I was listed on the agenda under new business.
   In defense of the lady at the next table and of the PTA members, my mother, Bernice Smiley, who, as a resident at Scripps Home in Altadena, told me that on the days my column appeared in the newspaper she would miss going to breakfast because she didn’t know what“trouble”I was stirring up for the day and she might be uncomfortable sitting at the table while the other senior residents had read what I was“lighting into”that day.
  My mother’s husband, even on his sick bed, provided lectures to me all based upon his, as he put it, concern for my safety and well-being because I didn’t know how to“make nice.”
   However, my father, Eugene Pickett, never seemed to have a problem with my behavior. Maybe that’s because we were born under the same lunar sign and rather than me being trouble my father simply understood Capricorns.
  My column last week on military recruiters in the schools brought many a reader to send me their views on the issue. One reader said I was a racist with a chip on my shoulder for writing that recruiters targeted African Americans and Latinos.
   If my mother had had her way with things, I’d be the person she tried to mold me into and that means I would behave quite properly for the public as my older sister has always done.
   Nobody has ever called her, the eldest of the Pickett daughters, a troublemaker. She may well have been labeled racist since, back in the day, she wore an“afro”and had a boyfriend who sported a black leather jacket, as did Huey Newton’s Black Panthers.
  No apologies offered, here. I am who I am. Racist? Not hardly. Troublemaker? A resounding yes, if it means I stir things up, make people uncomfortable with the way things are, say what a lot of folks are thinking but don’t say and that I proceed regardless of public opinion.
   I assure you my mother put her best into raising responsible children but I don’t think she ever came to realize she wasn’t responsible for my views on society. But then maybe she had a bigger hand in it then I realized before now because she and my father stressed compassion, honesty and individuality.
  I suspect the problem with my views on society that disturb so many people is not that I take a position that isn&apos;t nice, that isn&apos;t what they want to hear or consider but, instead, it is that I have wrangled my way into a position that gives me a platform to express them.

 KCAL 9&apos;s PAT HARVEY DEAD WRONG 

 Published On 03-22-2009 , 11:24 AM 

Nowadays, with the economy tanking, lots of folk are providing the public with suggestions on how to stay afloat. Turn on television news and on just about every local channel there is a segment on watching your money with investments, car repairs, real estate, credit cards, grocery shopping and meal planning.

I haven&apos;t learned much from tuning in because most of what they yack about has either nothing to do with me, I&apos;ve been there and done that or they are dead wrong on the advice.

It&apos;s strange watching the country turn to the life I&apos;ve lived for more than the number of decades I&apos;m going to put into print.

Investments? Human capital is what I learned growing up and have incorporated into my life style. What&apos;s that, and who is my broker? Putting time and deeds into helping others has no monthly tally sheet, but it&apos;s what everyone can do whether they have money to set aside or have income that just covers necessities.

I have, as yet, to hear this one on the evening news.

On the car-repair plan, I think they&apos;ve actually provided viewers with conversation on how to park the money guzzler and ride public transpiration. But what these on-the-spot segments are missing, because the camera and reporter only followed the script, is the personality adjustment that is required when encountering so many of the unsavory characters that inhabit the rails and street routes.

What I&apos;ve seen tends to cover real estate (as if I&apos;d know) fairly well.

If you&apos;ve found snags in the coverage, let me know. Conversation about credit cards has told viewers the basics such as paying in full, the charges that have now been put to the consumer and where to go for help. (I&apos;d ask where were these reports over the years when consumers were using plastic as if they had the cash to back their purchases?)

But here&apos;s the kicker. Pat Harvey on KCAL 9 News and her giggling co-anchor informed viewers that taking the children grocery shopping with you was a bad idea because the kiddies caused us to spend more money due to their asking for things or putting things into the basket.

Taking the children on the grocery-shopping expedition is one of the best ways to bring the youngsters, no matter what age, into the conversation about money. And what better time for them, if you haven&apos;t already introduced them to budgets, menus and shopping list, than now?

What nonsense to perpetuate the concept that&quot;the children would cause you to spend more money!&quot;

Such bad information being given to the public. Here&apos;s something useful to say:&quot;We&apos;re not going to buy that.&quot;Here&apos;s another useful one:&quot;Did you bring your own money for that?&quot;

But neither of the phrases will be needed, and of course this depends on the children&apos;s age, if you all sit together, plan out the budget, the menus and make a list that follows what&apos;s going to be eaten - snack included - and each child can have a list for specific areas of the store.

Does it work? You betcha. Remember, I spent many years raising five kids on food stamps and welfare. None of this is new to me. The grocery store plan teaches many money-management skills, and the best part of the plan means the kids will soon be begging not to go grocery shopping because, as I&apos;ve heard over the years,&quot;It&apos;s no fun!&quot;

Knowing what I know about the bad parenting advice from KCAL 9, I&apos;m now suspicious about the rest of the survival info the news channels are so busy peddling.

 HER EXCELLENCY,ELLEN JOHNSON-SIRLEAF,THE PRESIDENT OF LIBERIA BE COMIN&apos; TO TOWN 

 Published On 03-14-2009 , 10:35 PM 

&quot;Where’d you get that from?”is a common enough query, especially if it’s a hot piece of news circulating through the hood.
 
 Now, when it comes to inquiring in a more sophisticated or professional way, the wording changes to“What’s your source?”

In this last scenario, one is expected to provide documentation, reliable references, and, after all of this, the acceptance just might not be forthcoming because some of the sources were third party.

 But getting back to the hood–that’s where I come from and that’s where I hear it all. Not to discount the official news wires, but as my late father always said about communication,“There’s the telephone, television and then,&quot;  he said, &quot;there&apos;s tell-a-woman.”
 
 My version of the news in the hood is if I hear it once, I’m interested. When I hear it a second time, I know there’s something to the story. When it comes to me a third time, bingo, it’s reliable.

I first got the information from local community activist Jon Brookhart who was born in Liberia. Sounded hot enough that the big-time folk in the city would have the details.
Sometimes, with a piece of information like Brookhart was telling me, details are

 A telephone call to U.S. Congressman Adam Schiff’s office here in town didn’t produce the results I needed. Nope, they knew nothing.

Hm, but I know Brookhart to be a reliable source and the folks at Schiff’s office most certainly are as reliable.

Undaunted, I called the office of the Pasadena Mayor but was told there was nothing on the calendar,

 Joe Hopkins, publisher of the Pasadena Journal, was the next source. Success, yes.   He’d heard and knew a small detail because his wife, Ruth, is a sorority sister of the visiting dignitary, and her organization is possibly putting on a reception.

As I tell everyone, don’t discount sources in the hood. The only thing missing at this point was the when.

 The final source proved my dad’s formula of” tell-a-woman.&quot;    I contacted my sister in New York who formerly served as Peace Corp Director in Liberia and is, like Brookhart, pretty much in the know and in contact with folks back on the continent and their representatives who are here in the states.

Originally I was thinking the visit would be this month, which is Women’s History Month. Well, no, the words coming from the Liberian Embassy in Washington D.C., passed on to me by my sister, are that the official visit is in April with no details just yet.

 Her Excellency, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, the President of Liberia, will, indeed, be visiting in Pasadena.

Apparently the big-time folk don’t get the news any too early, but we little folks in the hood have most definitely been trained to keep our ears to the wind.

 INAUGURATION - PICTURES AND REPORT 

 Published On 01-25-2009 , 11:01 AM 


“Start at the beginning,“Brandi advised, when I declared it was impossible to write something short but all ncompassing about our trip of a lifetime to the 2009 inauguration of President Barack Obama.

I pointed to the framed black and white picture of me at the age of 2 years with my great-great-grandmother that hangs on my bedroom wall and said to Brandi,“That’s pretty much the beginning for me and there’s not enough space to go back that far.&quot;

Grandma had been freed from slavery when she was 12 years old.

“You know what I meant,”Brandi responded with typical teenage annoyance and went on to suggest the beginning was when the actual inauguration ceremony started.

I generally experience trouble when someone else, anyone else, tells me how to write.

While Brandi and others fit into the category of meaning well, it’s not so easy to conduct the orchestra if you’re not familiar with the sounds the instruments make. Meaning, by comparison, that my would-be helpers haven’t a clue as to what all is bubbling in my head.

Our trip had many request from the public. The one to bring back plenty of pictures topped the email, telephone and personal messages in the weeks and days before Brandi and I left Pasadena. Wind-chill factor and 18-degree weather aside, we’ve got‘em!

“Where ya’all coming’in from?&quot;was pretty much the question of the day as we encountered whatever portion of the millions of people in attendance that we
came into contact with.

Talk about bragging. Never before had I thought to be proud to announce I was born in Southern California, had never lived anywhere else, and that when we left town the temperature in Pasadena was somewhere around 85 degrees.

Of course we asked others where they were from but really didn’t care that much because all conversation was conducted with a fat neck scarf not just
wrapped around the neck but arranged to cover the mouth and nose with the only parts of the face unclothed being the eyes.

Brandi had some research to do for the trip in order to familiarize herself with some of the unknowns she would encounter. Wind chill factor was one something she didn’t have time to tackle.  But as we all know, experience can pretty much trump book learning.

And if anyone needs the full disclosure on what wind chill is and how you survive it, Brandi’s your person to talk with.

A full report on the trip ranked right up at the top of the list with the request for pictures. I’ve got the report.

But I can only write so much so here’s the deal: On February16, President’s Day, you’re invited to a small event where Brandi will share her experience, we’ll put pictures up on the screen and I’ll give the full
report–and I do mean full. Details will be posted on the homepage and calendar here on the site. Or call 626-296-2777/ email-shirlee@talkaboutparenting.org

 AH, BUT IT&apos;S A LONG DRIVE TO NEBRASKA 

 Published On 11-22-2008 , 2:47 PM 

WITHOUT a full look at the reasons older children were abandoned at hospitals in Nebraska under that state&apos;s safe haven law, one would think the parents who did this were pretty awful.

That may not be the case.

Safe haven laws that are on the books in all 50 states have been enacted to protect infants from being in harm&apos;s way when born to a mother who, for whatever reason, can&apos;t care for her baby.

Safe havens are designated places such as hospitals and fire stations where the infant can be dropped off without any questions asked.

Nebraska has been the only state enacting this legislation without stipulating a cut-off age and using the word child instead of infant, thereby laying themselves open for parents to abandon their kids - no matter what age.

The law took effect in July and since that time, of the children who have been abandoned, none were infants. Instead the children range in age from 1 to 17.

Nine of the children were left by their father who did this after the sudden death of his wife. The father, Gary Staton, said he just fell apart and didn&apos;t think he could raise the kids.

A 15-year-old was left by his aunt who was his guardian because, she said, even with medication she was unable to manage his behavior problems. Death was involved in this case also, as the teen&apos;s mother had died and the father was an absent one. It was this set of circumstances that led to the aunt becoming legal guardian.


What these cases clearly demonstrate is that families are in trouble. And the significant role that death seems to have played in perpetuating the actions of Mr. Staton and the guardian aunt can&apos;t help but raise the question of inadequate family services.

Where&apos;s the help in Nebraska? Where&apos;s the help in California and in every other state? Where&apos;s the help for parents, no death involved, who just can&apos;t cope?

Nowadays, confronting misbehaving teens about their unacceptable deeds and actions is simply met by them with a stone-eyed stare and a so-what attitude.

Punishments? Please! For too many parents, these have become weapons of the past.

The boy who stole from the department store while shopping with his mother had no remorse when apprehended by security guards; even when in-store cameras caught him in the act he still steadfastly denied he&apos;d taken the merchandise.

&quot;I&apos;d like to beat his butt,&quot;she said with a few expletives. At 16 years old, forget that as a remedy.

&quot;I wish security had arrested him and he could have cooled his heels in juvenile hall,&quot;she soon determined.

Nothing like juvenile hall to learn new tricks and run into old&quot;homies&quot;who aren&apos;t on the street anymore.

Ah, Nebraska. It&apos;s a long drive but could it be an answer for the miscreants in households all across America.

A parent from Council Bluffs, Iowa, drove across the state line to deposit her 14-year-old girl at a safe haven site in Nebraska. Apparently it was the state legislature that forgot to include a residency requirement.

Unfortunately for all of us who house belligerent, miscreants with raging hormones, the Nebraska lawmakers closed the loopholes last week and will only be accepting infants. No children allowed.

Oh, yeah, I did say many of those who dropped off their children weren&apos;t necessarily awful parents and now let me add this to the story - many of us who&apos;d like to drop ours off somewhere aren&apos;t awful, either.

Parents need help.

 GET &apos;EM REGISTERED TO VOTE 

 Published On 10-19-2008 , 8:26 AM 

DID our high school teachers and administrators remember to get students who are or will be 18 on or before Nov. 4, registered so they can vote?

Maybe the civic teachers, government teachers and all the other entities on high school campuses who are there to help teach our youth civic responsibility, are getting this done. If not, they ought to wake up because they only have one more day.

I&apos;ll admit it&apos;s pretty much the family who should see to it that their kids know about the voting process. But what about the kids who live with parents, uncles, aunts and a whole bunch of others who just don&apos;t bother?

I recently listened to someone pose a pretty nasty rhetorical question referring to people who don&apos;t vote.&quot;Who should be concerned?&quot;the man muttered, and then looked at the rest of us who were part of the small group of people he was with. He kept going with another slammer by concluding with the following:&quot;Don&apos;t you know people create their own destiny?&quot;

But where&apos;s a kid supposed to find out about placing their mark on the ballot if their parents, relatives or other adults around them don&apos;t bother to participate in the process?

Youths have an ongoing opportunity to learn civic responsibility in school because they&apos;ve got student government. How does the student body president get that position if votes aren&apos;t cast?

Does every kid on campus take part in student elections? Of course not. Does every kid on campus care who&apos;s serving on the school council? I&apos;m sorry to say, but the answer is heck, no!

Who should be concerned?

Since it was a rhetorical question, I was never expected to provide an answer. Others in the small group left the matter alone as well.

My grandmother, a staunch Republican, never missed marking her ballot in every election she was allowed to vote in. Was her dedication because of involvement in high school elections?

Granny Picket never went to high school, but she knew women fought for the right to vote and she knew African Americans had to fight, also.

But far too many of today&apos;s young people haven&apos;t got a clue when it comes to anything beyond texting, MySpace and iPods.

&quot;The right to vote?&quot;would most probably be their rhetorical question they wouldn&apos;t want an answer to.

Parents aren&apos;t expected to teach their children history, algebra or foreign languages, so maybe it shouldn&apos;t be left to them to teach civic responsibility.

Come on folks, it&apos;s not too late to register in California for the Nov. 4 election, but the deadline is Monday at midnight.

Pick up a registration post card at any library or post office. If you live in Northwest Pasadena you&apos;ll find them at barbershops, beauty shops, Hopkins Village, self-service laundries, Berry&amp;Sweeney Pharmacy, Arco service station snack shops and the Fair Oaks Car Wash.

For those in charge of our high school campuses, if you haven&apos;t been getting the students registered, do it on Monday.

Parents, if you thought it was someone else&apos;s responsibility, think again.

No register, no vote.

 FLOORED IN THE FAST FOOD LINE 

 Published On 10-05-2008 , 11:53 AM 

&apos;GOT what she deserved,&quot;was the consensus of the group.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot;said a quiet lady who was sitting on the sideline and who hadn&apos;t ventured to join in the conversation until things were all summed up.

&quot;I don&apos;t know about all of that,&quot;she continued slowly and thoughtfully. Finally she ventured to question the judgment of the two men and three women who said the teenager who was knocked to the floor at a fast-food restaurant by a male customer needed to learn a lesson.

&quot;Seems his actions were plain ol&apos; illegal. You can&apos;t just walk around punching people in the face,&quot;the quiet lady finally said.

But there was no turning around the judgment of the group.

One of the men said,&quot;A punch is a natural reaction for dissing someone.&quot;

Another man said,&quot;Teenagers nowadays are completely out of hand.&quot;

Witnesses at the scene of the punch reported the 16-year-old had&quot;cussed&quot;the man who walked into the restaurant while she stood in line with friends.

Then there&apos;s the opinion of the seasoned high school teacher who deals with belligerent teens on an hourly basis. She failed to see the&quot;hooray the girl had it coming&quot;point of view.

&quot;Violence is violence, no matter how it gets packaged,&quot;the teacher said while trying hard to figure out how any adult would act in such a manner and she was further trying to understand a point of view that said&quot;cussing&quot;someone meant getting floored.

The surveillance video was on the news this past week as the cameras caught most of the this amazing action at the fast-food place. But will the Los Angeles police be able to catch the suspect?

Witnesses, it is said, described what he was wearing but that was as far as they went.&quot;Hey, folks on Crenshaw Boulevard (the street where it happened) don&apos;t remember seeing anything when somebody gets shot dead so who&apos;s gonna speak up when some smart-mouth teenager gets what her momma should a been giving her all this time?&quot;said a man from the group.

There&apos;s more going on in this story than meets the eye of those cheering and claiming the teenager may now have learned a needed lesson.

Yes, her momma shoulda been teaching her not to disrespect anyone. But what, let us ask, should the man&apos;s momma have been teaching him?

One piece of this pie that seemed not to have all the ingredients in it when the group chewed on it, was the two young boys who came into the place with the suspect and who he quickly escorted out when he left.

Can&apos;t help but wonder about all the abuse the young kids have in life. Not a good story.

Me? In truth, I wasn&apos;t too sorry the girl had been floored and that&apos;s because, like the group, I&apos;m pretty damn sick of surly, rude, disrespectful teenagers wearing clothes that are too tight, or hanging off their butts, talking all kind of trash and thinking no one has the right to corral them - including parents, teachers, police and probation officers.

Unfortunately, as a reasonable person, I have to agree with the high school teacher and the woman who wouldn&apos;t go along with the&quot;she deserved it&quot;group.

But somehow deep down I can&apos;t help but know that in some kind of way something has to be done to put today&apos;s marauding, undisciplined teenagers in check with their&quot;can&apos;t touch this&quot;attitude that&apos;s prevalent whether they are in line, riding the bus, standing on the street corner or walking through their parent&apos;s homes.

Where&apos;s Bill Cosby? He knows how to give &apos;em hell!

 PUMP UP YOUR KIDS FOR THE ELECTION 

 Published On 08-24-2008 , 8:06 AM 


TITLE on my e-mail was a simple WOW with an exclamation mark. Born in 1965 just before Watts - in the first Los Angeles Riot - went up in flames, my daughter who lives in Colorado exclaimed she&apos;d received credentials to attend the Obama acceptance speech in Denver.

As a kid, she and her sister used to stand outside supermarkets with a clipboard full of voter registration post cards getting people to sign-up for their civic duty. 

 Did they want to do it?
 
As parents, do we ever really know how they&apos;re going to respond to the early pressures we put on them? Maybe I should have called it guidance and not pressure.

The youngest of my crew, who is a senior in high school, sat glued to the television set the other night watching CNN&apos;s&quot;McCain Revealed.&quot;&quot;This is very interesting,&quot;she announced beckoning me to join in on the viewing.

Brandi, my youngest, isn&apos;t a Senator McCain supporter but she certainly came to recognize credentials matter and that while he may not be her pick, he can&apos;t be discounted.

There&apos;s a lot to learn in front of the boob tube these days.

The time has come for parents to seize a unique opportunity that can help in guiding the young members of their households into politically active individuals - no matter the age and no matter the choice of political party.

Politically active isn&apos;t meant to mean protest, flag burning (as in the 1960s) or student marchers. Politically active in the simplest of terms means being aware of the process and the first step
 can be to treat the kids to the up-coming political conventions - both of them. 
Boring, the teenagers will no doubt complain. But how many of us complain that government classes are no longer available in the high schools? And how many of us have bothered to pick up the slack at home?

The kids may not yet be 18-years-old, the required age for voting, but it&apos;s not too early to get them pumped up.

Bring home a few registration post cards and let them see what they&apos;ll need to do when they reach the magic age. Boring you just might hear them say, but that&apos;s pretty much their usual comment.

Boring may well be accompanied by,&quot;My vote won&apos;t count, anyway.&quot;

But ask the children, once they&apos;ve seen the hordes of delegates at the conventions via live television coverage, why they think all those people are participating in the process if their vote doesn&apos;t count.

Boring? Our offspring seem to always think they should be entertained. But if they keep the remote tuned to the conventions they&apos;re apt to see some of their favorite celebs.

Voting is a family affair. If you don&apos;t they probably won&apos;t. Get pumped up for the November election - now - and while doing so let&apos;s spread the enthusiasm throughout the household and beyond.

Wow!

The daughter in Colorado who once rolled her eyes and grumbled because she had to stand outside supermarkets getting people registered to vote is now claiming she feels she&apos;s about to be part of history.
 Boring! She exclaimed way back when but now she&apos;s headed for Denver and the biggest excitement of her life.                    -30-

 Unusual Suspects 

 Published On 08-13-2008 , 9:54 PM 

While the YWCA’s mission to eliminate racism and empower women is, indeed, lofty, the steps they are taking pretty much depend on the rest of us.

The forums, workshops and other programs developed by them to address these selected issues all too often, like so many opportunities, everywhere, suffer for lack of participants

Denise Jones, chairperson of Pasadena Y’s Racial Justice Committee, today’s guest on Talk About Parenting with Shirlee Smith LIVE, didn’t make a big to do about the“unusual suspects,”as we came to call those folk who never show up for the events staged for their benefit.

Unusual Suspects? Well, they came to be named such because most programs and events are pretty much attended by the same people and the Y doesn’t stand alone in this. one. 

How many organizations hire outreach coordinators to beat the bushes to find the very sleeping souls their mission and projects are made for?

While Jones wasn’t in the guest seat to carry on about who comes to the programs and who doesn’t, it was ME who jumped on the chance to hammer away at parents for allowing their teenagers to sleep-in on Saturday mornings rather than join in for something beneficial.

I apologized to Jones for going on a tangent but then I took back my“I’m sorry”because I meant every word I hurled at parent and caretaker viewers.

Yes, I demanded, for whatever good it didn’t do, that parents get Jerome and Jantell out of bed on Saturday mornings and make sure they come home early on Friday night so they can do something that stimulates their intellectual and educational growth.

Maybe the Unusual Suspects don’t participate because they don’t feel welcome. Maybe they don’t participate because t hey really aren’t w elcome.

What’s your take on social service organizations mainly serving the Usual Suspects?

During viewer call in, Racial Justice Committee chairperson Jones talked Alice, from Riverside, though her concerns about the dismantling of affirmative action in California. While Jones said her committee worked mainly with local issues she was willing, she said, to have it on the committee agenda for discussion.

 JACKSON REALIZED THE SHOE FIT 

 Published On 07-11-2008 , 10:58 PM 

Who would have thought longtime civil rights activist Jesse Jackson&apos;s lengthy relationship with microphones hadn&apos;t taught him a thing or two?

And one of those things, I would think, would have been: You never really know if the the mic is on or off.

Thing two for those in the public domain, as Jackson has been for more than 40 years, is simple - anything you say can , and most certainly will, be held against you.

Jackson is a disappointment, as people expect so much more from those, like him, who in society carry the weight of having made a mark in history for contributing to the good of humanity - and this man has done that with his years on the front line fighting the often rhyming message for equality.

While Jackson has quickly apologized for having whispered to a fellow guest on a Fox interview set that Obama talks down to black people and that he would like to cut off the presidential hopeful&apos;s testicles, I don&apos;t believe there&apos;s any real remorse for this viewpoint - only remorse for having been stupid enough to get caught in one more precarious position regarding fatherhood.

It&apos;s said the whisper, the condemnation, was about Obama&apos;s Father&apos;s Day message from the pulpit of a black church in which Obama said black fathers needed to recognize fatherhood is a responsibility that goes far beyond impregnating a woman. Obama talked further about absentee fathers - fathers who are AWOL.

Talking down? Irresponsible fathers in the black community were the very topic of conversation that made headlines a few years back when, as a married man, Jackson fathered a child out of wedlock.

Talking down? America doesn&apos;t need leadership that doesn&apos;t address issues, no matter the color, head-on.

Now if John McCain, the Republican candidate, had said exactly what Obama said that morning from the pulpit, he would have been branded a racist with no hope in sight for explaining what he meant.

If Bill or Hillary Clinton had dared tell the truth about missing black fathers, they too would still be attempting to clear the air.

The lack of parenting has become a social problem, no matter the color, income or social status of the family.

Should Obama be telling Americans how to parent? Is parenting going to be a plank in his presidential platform?

This isn&apos;t the first time the Democrat has addressed the lack of parenting as an issue. Back when he and Hillary were battling for the party&apos;s nomination, he said parents needed to turn off the television.

I guess back then Jackson didn&apos;t have a whispering opportunity to claim Obama was talking down to parents - all parents.

Talking down? Jackson hasn&apos;t had much of a chance to explain himself other than issuing the apology. He could work his way out of this one by simply saying that, in his viewpoint, talking down simply means telling the truth.

Now, about irresponsible fathers and Jackson&apos;s out-of-wedlock child - I guess the old expression about the shoe fitting has just been too much for him to bear or wear.

About cutting off Obama&apos;s testicles, there&apos;s no out for Jackson on this one unless he stays with the excuse of truth and admits what really bothers him is this black presidential hopeful has got more nerve than he did when he sought our nation&apos;s highest office back in 1984.

Jackson, who like Hillary&apos;s husband Bill is pretty much known for his sexual misdeeds, might know that he&apos;s given the public a full view of his sick nature and fade, at last, from the arena of social commentary.

Somewhere, somehow, there has got to be somebody who can help Jackson understand his&quot;I am Somebody&quot;is no longer a working slogan. Who will help Jackson fade into oblivion?
Black families are in serious trouble and Obama is to be applauded for taking Bill Cosby&apos;s tell it like it is position into the political arena.

Maybe a Department of Parental Responsibility is worth considering. More government meddling? Maybe, but somethings got to bring Americans to their senses when it comes to protecting our children and that means helping parents understand their responsibility.

 A MOTHER&apos;S DAY REMINDER: DON&apos;T FORGET THE HUMOR 

 Published On 05-10-2008 , 12:36 AM 

Back in the day when I was doing stand-up comedy, a significant part of my routine was my Mother’s Day special.

The concept of once a year good treatment for us, when we toil 24/7 all the other days, gave me fodder for a great comedic approach to a celebration orchestrated by merchants.raking in the dollars.

I haven’t had an on-stage Mother’s Day gig since Brandi joined my household seventeen years ago but thanks to KABC and KLOS talk radio’s Spotlight on the Community I got a chance to grab the microphone and help mothers make sense out of nonsense.

With Nelkane Benton, the station’s Community Relations Director and Cynthia Fox, on- air personality, we had one of those conversations that went beyond the advertised jewelry, household appliances and electronic specials.

Comedy? Nelkane opened the conversation remembering her mother as being humorous. I closed the discussion advising listeners that without humor raising kids was a tough boat to row.

Comedy? The broadcast booth isn’t exactly the Ice House stage and as adept as Fox and Benton are at keeping a conversation rolling, that atmosphere wasn’t anything like a room full of people staring from the darkness of a dimly lit room demanding, by body language, that they be made to laugh.

Making sense out of nonsense is defined by me as commonsense advise and that’s this year’s Mother’s Day Special coming to the public compliments of talk radio.

What’s a mom to do with a young child who doesn’t behave at a restaurant? What an appropriate discussion point for a day when restaurants are overbooked with family members of all ages and with eating establishments, everywhere, beginning to create policies against serving “children.”

This one was commonsense and not comedy. Every parent needs a workable strategy for helping kids understand the proper behavior for wherever they’re going. I talked about adequate preparation before arriving at the destination.

What about that old neighborhood spirit of every mom being everyone else’s mom? There’s no such thing as a neighbor anymore they are simply called the“people”next door and they’re probably moving next week, anyway, so no real reason to want to meet them?.

Maybe it’s time for moms to be a little more inclusive. Maybe our kid isn’t the cutest and or smartest one on the block or in the classroom. Maybe it’s time to recognize once we start labeling who is cute it means we’re seeing some other child as ugly.

Maybe, if you’re the mother of the smart kid, you just might encourage helping the kid who hasn’t quite caught on, just yet. Maybe moms could start spreading the warmth and inclusion that was once an integral part of who we were.

My Talk About Parenting with Shirlee Smith Spotlight on the Community interview with Cynthia Fox and Nelkane Benton will broadcast on 780 KABC–AM, radio Saturday, May 10, 6::00 a.m. and on Sunday, May 11. KLO 95.5–AM at 6:000 a.m.

The interview can also be heard on the stations website via podcast beginning Monday, May 12th, which is the more reasonable optiion. Who among us is up on the weekend at the crack of dawn.

Come to think of it, the interview does end on a comedic note. From back in the day when I did my stand-up Mother’s Day Special, I brought back the line,“We all would have said, not tonight dear”when Fox asked if mothers envisioned the huge responsibility involved with raising kids.

 HISTORY REPEATS 

 Published On 02-14-2008 , 12:00 AM 

Among those listed on the tattered and torn copy of a slave sale document that hangs on my wall, (for a good price) are families - husbands, wives and their children. The conditions for sale indicate the separation of the little ones from mothers and fathers and the separation of wives from husbands; this to be determined at the buyer’s pleasure.

Noted on“Public Sale of Negroes Announcement”which was held March 5th, 1833, at Potters Mart in Charleston South Carolina, are the attributes and talents of each of the unnamed chattel.

The first listing says,“One Negro, a very valuable blacksmith, a master of his trade and in his prime.”

Another listing is for a valuable Negro woman accustomed to all kinds of housework, a good plain cook an excellent dairymaid, who also washes and irons. She, it says, is the mother of four children ranging from a 13-year old daughter to an 11-month-old infant. Two of the children, the document says, will be sold with the mother, the others separately or“as best suits the purchaser.”

Hanging next to the Potters Mart Document is an enlarged picture of a small girl sitting on a front porch in Austin Texas next to her maternal great-great grandmother who was freed from slavery at the age of twelve.

Was my Granma ever on the auction or sale block? My family never knew the answer because they didn’t allow Granma to talk about her life on the plantation, which was deemed a shameful part of our past. But the family does know that she was a house servant who also cared for the master’s children.

Talk or no talk, Granma somehow passed along her talents and attributes which were pretty much the same as the Negro woman’s listed for sale that day at Potters Mart for both my mother and her mother grew to become accustomed to all kinds of housework and they also did washing and ironing for white people.

Slavery prepared a lot of African American women for life as domestics. The trade was handed down. In the early days they“stayed on the place”leaving their children to be cared for by elders who were not spry enough to take on the demanding chores associated with keeping white homes in perfect order.

I was farmed out, along with other children, to a wonderful older couple we all called“Uncle Bob and Aunt Grace.”  My mother’s day off was on Thursday and that’s when I saw her.

In 1865 the Emancipation Proclamation freed black people from slavery but seventy years later, when I was born, our families were still being separated

Yes, times have changed. But take a long look at the foster care system where Children’s Courts–all across the country–have become the present day Potters Mart from 1833 in South Carolina.

No more slave sale documents instead we have court decrees removing and separating children from their families who are then, by the systems own terminology, emancipated when they turn eighteen.  

And, yes, we even have a new slave master, still white but now in powder form called crack-cocaine.


 Slave memorabilia can be found on-line at numerous websites. Try: www.littleafrica.com/slaves Learn more about African American children in foster care at www.nysccc.org/Conferences/ 2006Conf/2006ConfHandout/Color.htm Google Negro domestics and Negro live-in maids

 PARENTS RAISING KIDS FOR JAIL TIME 

 Published On 12-31-2007 , 12:00 AM 


The so-called cute little 3-year-old sat across from me. While I was trading stories with other adults at the table, she, with a strong arm and an accurate aim, pitched a tennis ball that hit me dead center in the chest.

&quot;Who threw this?&quot;I demanded as I grabbed the ball, which was rolling on the floor.

&quot;He did, Grandma,&quot;she said, pointing to her young cousin who was sitting at the table&apos;s end.

&quot;He did, Grandma,&quot;she repeated while blinking her eyes, smiling demurely and striking a facial pose that she felt assured would work cute-kiddie magic.

&quot;No, no,&quot;said the cousin, who went so far as to explain how and where the cute kiddie had procured the weapon.

The cousin could not have done the throwing - he was at the wrong angle - but my grandkid was in the perfect spot.

She held to her lie, blinking her big eyes and smiling innocently with each denial and finger-pointing accusation.

I&apos;m not one to be suckered in by game-playing children. When I told the parents of this behavior, the mother stared me down with an air of&quot;leave my kid alone&quot;and the father, my grandson, said with a nervous giggle,&quot;Oh, she&apos;s a charmer.&quot;

Everywhere we go these days, we hear how kids have changed. Kids haven&apos;t changed, but their parents sure have.

Parents think their kids are cute, but the judge ain&apos;t gonna have that same opinion when they appear in the court of law.
 Parents are doing a disservice to their children.
 &lt;br&gt;  As my friend who is a family counselor, put it,&quot;Today&apos;s parents are abusing their children psychologically by not handing them a dish of reality.&quot; 
A friend whose grandson was recently arrested for mugging someone reports his mother, her daughter, has condoned and has made excuses for his criminal behavior and anti-social behavior beginning when he said the preschool teacher was picking on him.

When our kids steal at home and we ignore the theft, pretending it&apos;s just growing pains and kids testing the limits, we&apos;re setting them up for the fall. If they&apos;re stealing at home, taking money from the cookie jar, they&apos;re just practicing to get to the teacher&apos;s purse at school.

&quot;Not in my house, baby. Ain&apos;t nothin&apos; comin&apos; through that front door I didn&apos;t buy,&quot;said one irate friend with a son who brought home a bottle of expensive men&apos;s cologne he had no money to buy.

Dress `em in a sandwich board that says on both sides, in giant-sized letters,&quot;I&apos;m a thief.&quot;

In defense of their inappropriate behavior, today&apos;s young&apos;uns are quick to offer up,&quot;All the kids do it!&quot;Now, if you&apos;re buying this one and determining your kids&apos; actions don&apos;t need to be corrected, I&apos;d like to also sell you some ocean front property in Arizona.

They start young by tossing balls and blaming someone else for the deed. They start young because the parents think the little monsters are charming. They get old, and parents say kids have changed and they can&apos;t do a thing with them.

The criminal justice system is going to do something with all of these unruly kids. The prison industry is one of the fastest-growing businesses in the country, and guess who&apos;s making it profitable?

 OMAHA NEBRASKA MALL MASSACRE 

 Published On 12-09-2007 , 12:00 AM 

Since the Virginia Tech campus killings last April, administrators of America’s institutions of higher learning are stepping up efforts to make their campuses safe by, in part, ruling out applicants with troublesome backgrounds like that of Cho Seung-Hui the Virginia Tech shooter.

Maybe the emphasis shouldn’t simply be on eliminating students from the admissions process whose records indicate past mental health or criminal problems, but instead these academic institutions ought to be formulating plans that would provide services for the millions of our citizens who are living on the edge.

What does it really mean for college campuses to be safe when The Westroads Mall in Omaha Nebraska is not?

What if the new polices being proposed that include some kind of examining of a student applicant’s record had been in place at Virginia Tech and Cho had not been admitted.

With Cho’s very sick interpretation of life and of his place in society, wouldn’t he still have been living on the edge? With no college campus in his gun sight, might he have simply decided to shoot up the shopping mall in his own hometown blowing away 32 innocent people like he did at Virginia Tech?

When the snooty academicians get to sorting through the applications, exactly what clear measure can they use to adequately determine who is of sound mind and, of course, the learned crew of judges will not only rule on the severity of any particular case, they will also, as they already do, decide who will be able to make it through their great halls of learning. 

But Robert Hawkins, the 19-year-old Omaha shooter who was rejected by the military and fired from his job at McDonalds was not planning a next step of enrolling in the University of Nebraska.

Both Hawkins and Cho were mentally ill and there was no safety net provided either of them. These two are not alone. We see their likeness everyday in another body being called by another name and we also see their female counterparts on the streets of major cities and on the byways of small towns and rural areas.

They’re turning tricks in dimly lit alleyways, they’re pumping their veins with deadly stuff and they’re doing meth like there’s no tomorrow. And for the Virginia Tech and the Westroads Mall victims there really are no tomorrows. Tomorrows for the victims will never come.

But tomorrows can be given to the mentally ill in our society, but there must be a plan, there must be a safety net. America must stop letting the Chos and the Hawkins fall through the cracks.

Institutions of higher learning need to leave their ivory tower, recognize the severity of mental health problems in our society and then provide leadership in addressing these issues. The academicians can, instead of focusing on their own institutions of higher learning, chart the path for making our society a safer one.

 IF YOU CAN&apos;T BEAT THE XMAS PRESENT GAME, THEN WHAT? 

 Published On 12-02-2007 , 12:00 AM 

Having just heard Bing Crosby crooning the popular tune, “It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas,”made me all too pleased that the Advent Calendar in our household was ready and waiting for it’s first little window to be opened yesterday morning.

The season seems to provide our little ones, big ones and even some adult children a special CIA assignment of searching to find whatever Christmas packages might be stored in unconventional places or under the tree.

How many of us learned the lesson of no real surprise on the big day because the kids had unwrapped the boxes, examined the contents, wrapped’em up, stuck back under the tree and as a final step produced fake oohs and ahs on the 25th?

Of course, some parents decide to just have pretty packages, with nothing in them, under the tree but this action produces the big-time investigative work. This forces the kids to go under the beds, in the closets, in the car trunk, up on the SUV luggage rack, under the kitchen sink, into the dirty-clothes hamper and even set-up a sneak run over to the neighbor’s house.  We hide and the kids find.

But Smart Smith, or should I simply call myself Sylvester the cat, wasn’t going to be out done with Christmas kids getting the last laugh. So I simply, with a chuckle and an I’ll-show-you attitude, stuck the wrapped packages under our tree with numbers not names. But my house little Tweety birds, just like in the cartoon they’d seen too much of, outwitted me on this one, too.
 
My rank as Captain of the house platoon meant nothing once the darlings discovered the game would be over once they broke my numbered military code.
 
It took only the opening of one package per number and whamo they knew which of them each numbered gift suited best.

But like the Grinch who stole Christmas, I thought up a plan and I thought it up quick. I went to Vroman’s Bookstore and made a new kind of shopping before Christmas pick.

Actually, the plot didn’t unfold all that quickly. It took a few years to get ahead of my little Chickadees.  And before I found my answer on the bookstore shelf, I had abandoned the idea of shopping anytime before the after Christmas sales.

But the Advent Calendar I discovered at the bookstore, beautifully decorated with twenty-four little doors and windows containing surprises when opened, stemmed the tide and quelled the need to invade the sanctity of what was wrapped-up for the big day.

Maybe my kids just got too old to keep figuring out how to outwit this old cat, but to this day every one of them welcomes December with an Advent Calendar in their home.

And Brandi, who hasn’t yet escaped Captain Sylvester, has a calendar, this year with tiny little chocolates behind each window. But these calendars come with pictures, toys, fruit and a wide range of surprises. They also come in a wide range of prices - 99 cents to hundreds of dollars.

If you haven’t gotten yours, it’s probably not to late.  If not this year, there’s always next year and for Christmas 2008 you even have time to make your own.

 HOW MUCH HURT DID THE BOUNTY HUNTER CAUSE? 

 Published On 11-10-2007 , 12:00 AM 

My sister has a doctoral degree in anthropology from Harvard University. She has taught at numerous prestigious universities across the country and for many years she served as a Peace Corps director in Liberia.

&quot;The Doctor,&quot;as I often call her, is well educated, highly respected and travels in what society would call good academic, international and social circles.

But when her son&apos;s white girlfriend gave birth to his child, she sounded worse than Dog the Bounty Hunter, who was recently tape-recorded by his son, Tucker, using the N-word in reference to the young man&apos;s girlfriend, who is black.

My nephew didn&apos;t bother to document his mother&apos;s ranting. Nor did any other member of our family try to make public her racial intolerance.

Would&quot;The Doctor&quot;have been put on administrative leave had the news leaked out? Would the public have cared about her position in this matter of being the grandmother of a bi-racial child?

I doubt the National Enquirer would have been interested in the story. My nephew would have been hard put trying to collect the $15,000 Dog&apos;s son was paid for the betrayal, according to an interview with Dog on Larry King.

Truthfully, what harm has Dog the Bounty Hunter actually caused? He, like the rest of us who haven&apos;t been outed, said what came to mind.

Does this man&apos;s use of the N-word actually give a clear portrayal of his racial tolerance level?

The conversation surrounding this story should not be focusing on the word. Instead, we should be talking more about the very sad relationship the man has with his son.

For so few pieces of silver, this young man, just recently released from prison, set his father up as a result, maybe, of a troubled childhood caused in part by the absence of his father.

But instead we&apos;re all weighing in on the word itself. In a clip from&quot;The View,&quot;that I saw, co-host Sherri Shepherd claimed she was very hurt that Dog would use that word.

Let&apos;s get real. Please. As black people struggling to establish ourselves in this troublesome society, we&apos;ve got a hell of a lot more to be hurt about than Dog using a word we use in private on a regular basis.

Let&apos;s get hurt about the rappers who&apos;ve taken the N-word to new lows. Let&apos;s get hurt with the teenagers taking their cue from the rappers, who can be heard everywhere greeting each other with,&quot;What&apos;s up, my n-----.&quot;&apos;

If American institutions were not so preoccupied with the business of creating and then ignoring the racial divide, there would be real dialogue about racism and the establishing of a process for eliminating it, instead of continually devoting headline stories focused on the word alone.

I don&apos;t watch Dog&apos;s show, but on the occasions that I&apos;ve happened to catch parts of it, I never noticed that he was catching only African Americans and turning them over to law enforcement. So, it isn&apos;t Dog who is filling up our prisons with black men.

Why isn&apos;t Shepherd from&quot;The View&quot;hurt about the absence of men in her community? Why isn&apos;t she hurt about the racial disparity prevalent in our criminal justice system?

Suspending Dog&apos;s A&amp;E show,&quot;Dog The Bounty Hunter,&quot;is totally inappropriate and smacks of those in charge waiting to see how Al Sharpton will play this one.

Will Dog&apos;s misspeak be called a slap at the black community? Will my people march?

Let&apos;s hope not.

Dog is apologizing everywhere. He says he&apos;s even taking training. My sister held her ground and never spoke to her grandchild, and in later years hasn&apos;t yet spoken to her great-grandchildren. Neither of these instances are isolated cases in America, but which of them causes the real hurt and truly reflects the mess our society is really in?

 CANDY VERSUS SAFETY 

 Published On 10-31-2007 , 12:00 AM 

There&apos;s got to be some safe places for youth to dress-up, parade around and grab onto an identiy that won&apos;t belong to them the next day. Roaming the streets and knocking on doors for that elusive treat has become a hazardous activity that, year after year, I hear parents express their concern about. So, why are so many parents still putting their children in harms way?

Local recreation centers, schools, youth organizations, churches and families putting on their own Halloween parties are answering the challenge BUT what about the slow learners? Is it the call of the candy?

I’m continuously bamboozled by the way people behave. Constantly reflecting on issues in our society that seem to have a clear-cut solution, I’m left in the dark, bamboozled, by the public’s determination to not catch on.

I’m probably not stating my case very well because I’m actually meaning to say I realize I’m not at all getting to the point. But this is because I’m truly bamboozled and therefore having a time saying what must be said.

This column is about Trick or Treat. Maybe not. Maybe it’s really about giving kids candy. Then again, I think I’m going to write about childhood obesity. Okay, I think I see clarity here, if I can just escape this mental fog and tie these elements together I might produce a coherent piece of work.

Here goes.

In line at Target last week, I stood behind a woman buying $300 worth of candy. “The kids in my neighborhood–the cutest little goblins–love the Milky Way bars,”she said with a satisfied smile coming, in part, from her very ruby red lips that looked as though they were already made up for the costume ball.

By the time she made the comment her goodies, or obesity sensors, were already bagged up and I wasn’t able to tell if it was all Milk Way bars, but this small detail has little to do with the $1.55 billion that will be spent on candy this year as reported by the National Retail Federation.

Back in the day, as my grandson likes to describe my growing up years,“Trick or Treat”simply meant the kids were supposed to get a treat/goody or they would deliver a prank/trick.

Modern times vs. medieval times has put the“Trick”in the hands of the smiling shoppers
who will be offering up that $1.55 billion cache of sugar.

It seems to me, since the word trick, is defined as a cunning action or plan that is intended to cheat or deceive, if we believe the reports on the alarming rate of childhood obesity in our society, isn’t the giving of candy to children an act of deception?

Let’s say we don’t want to believe the reports that say 17% of our American kids between the age of 2 and 19 are tipping the scales with pounds they shouldn’t be lugging around, all we have to do is watch the lines for goodies at the movie theater, see the“wadddlers”strolling the local mall or take a look at our own families.

In my way of thinking, if we as a society were concerned about kids and obesity we’d stop tricking them by giving them candy and calling it a treat.

The smiling shopper wouldn’t connect any of my words with the“cute goblins”that come to her door and she would probably wonder what I would expect her to do for Halloween. 

Bamboozled? Yes, why are we still feeding kids candy?

 TOY RECALLS ARE A BLESSING IN DISGUISE 

 Published On 10-21-2007 , 12:00 AM 

I saw one of my favorite little characters on television nightly news the other night and the reporter, who flopped him around in front of the camera for all to see, wasn’t giving up any respect for this icon that for decades has been the apple of many a child’s eye.

Well, maybe I should say banana of the eye, since it was a stuffed Curious George the monkey character from the age-old stories by Margaret Rey that was being mucked over and having his plastic face pinched and distorted and all because some motley and uncaring manufacturer made him with materials harmful to children.

While somewhere around 21 million toys have been recalled since this summer, believe me when I say there is much for the consumer to gain by toy shelves in retail stores being less cluttered and in some stores just about empty.

For those who agonize over what seems to be on going recalls with a different toy being paraded before the news cameras on a regular basis there is actually good news at hand.

I was in our local Vroman’s Book Store children’s department the other day and as usual the shelves and tables were crowded with wonderful reading material for young people of every age and I’m quite positive this scenario is repeated at Borders and Barnes and Nobles the big chain places.

Forget about Elmo, Big Bird, Barbie and what ever is the“I got to have”item this Christmas season. Choice is on the consumer’s side for once. This is the year to figure it out.  This is the year to get to the bookstore.

While 50% of U.S. toy sales happen between now and December, this is the year to change those stats and take your money to the bookstore where both you and the recipient of your gift will gain long-range returns.

Books for Christmas? It works. I know. As a parent of five offspring, toy stores weren’t my hangout.

 Like most kids, each of mine had very distinct interest in life. One loved embroidery and believe me the shelves at Vroman’s were filled with books that fit her needs.

Another child liked trains and no I didn’t buy railroad sets (I didn’t have that kind of money) but I did buy books about trains and railways and there was even one book I purchased on how to build your own cars and tracks.

My household met Curious George through books, which are still on my shelves, and if this sounds like the Middle Ages, the time before the electronics surge, when my family gathers old time treasurers like “Wind in the Willows,” “Alice in Wonderland,” “Christopher Robin and Pooh Bear,”get pulled off the shelf for viewing.

This year, when you go shopping in the children’s department at the bookstore, ask for help. Those wonderful people who sit at the desk know just about every item on the shelves. All they need to know is the age and interest level of the person/persons you’re buying for and your good deed will be done without long lines and frustrated shoppers trying to grab everything you were just getting ready to select. 

Here’s a quick hint; don’t get these presents gift wrapped because you’re gonna want to read them many times yourself before you give them away.

 MILITARY RECRUITERS GETCHA IF YOU DON&apos;T OPT OUT 

 Published On 09-08-2007 , 12:00 AM 

There’s a little known section of the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) legislation that was approved by Congress back in 2001.

No, the public probably doesn’t need to know all aspects of this controversial action that on the surface claims to focus on educating all children, but shouldn’t parents at least be aware that Section 9528 targets their kids for recruitment by the military?

Okay, some really alert parents have known about this all these years, but then there are the rest of us.

Every school year, all school districts that receive federal funds go about the business of following the law, which imposes requirements regarding the disclosure of student directory information to military recruiters.

Section 9528 of NCLB requires school districts receiving federal funds to disclose names, addresses and phone numbers of high school students to military recruiters upon request.

And there is an important clause to this section that keeps the information out of the recruiter’s hands and it states, “Unless individuals adult age students or parent of minors request that the information not be released without prior written consent.”

Huh? 
 
This discriminatory law, discriminatory because it does not include private schools or wealthy school districts, further requires that a district notify parents of the option to request their child’s information not be released without their consent.

Uh, huh!

Districts follow the law and send letters home contained in fall registration packets, however they generally are not read, signed and therefore not returned, thereby placing minority student’s information in the hands of recruiters.

These letters most frequently begin with information about President Bush and the Congressional approval of the legislation, which isn’t of much interest to a busy parent filling out too many required forms. 

Then comes the warning to parents which sometimes reads: If you fail to sign and return this form, it will be assumed that you have authorized consent for your child’s information to be given to military recruiters upon request.

How many of those in charge of high school students have noticed these letters, signed and returned them? Not too many of us because we never heard about NCLB Section 9528. Or, admittedly, on my part, even saw such correspondence.

Did I sign our letter last year? Of course not. I didn’t even know a trick called“You’re In, If you don’t opt out, was being played

Did I sign this year? You betcha. 

How many parents, guardians or caregivers of high school students didn’t know this was going on? How many others, like myself, have added this very important piece of paper to the dump pile?

It’s not too late. Find the letter, sign it and get it to back to the school. If you’ve already registered, call the school and ask to have the “Military Opt Out Letter”sent to your home unless you are that parent who wants the military recruiters trying to meet their quota by showering your offspring with promises.

 DO SOMETHING 

 Published On 08-23-2007 , 12:00 AM 

Time to act. Time to do something. This week’s blog on the shooting death of 16 year-old Ebony Huell has prompted comments, here, that sound like folks believe in action.

Reese says the“Underground”club, which is located in the hood and where 16 year-old Ebony Huell was shot to death, should not have been allowed there.

Bruce says people would do something about the unsavory conditions teens are faced with but they don’t know what to do.

Both Borad and Jones say they are glad not to be teenagers in today’s crazy world.

Yesterday someone said to me“Life probably won’t really get better, that is to say people taking responsibility, until some kind of major catastrophe hits‘em in the head.“

My breakfast companion went on to add that with the biggest catastrophe the country had ever experienced the leader of the land told us all to go shopping. And I guess this is what everybody has been doing since 9/11.

Reese, do you think people of sound mind and dedicated community spirit knew about the club?

If we know somethin’ain’t right, aren’t we supposed to work to fix it?

Reese, tell us five (5) easy to spot issues that you’ve noted but thought,“Oh, well.”

Everybody else, please let’s hear about the girls with too short skirts, boobs hanging out and midriffs bare all the way to the panty line. 

A reader of my newspaper column frequently reminds me I haven’t highlighted the sexual come-on from youngsters who don’t even realize they’re advertising. Or do they?

Jones, what’s just one thing from life, when you were a teenager that we could bring back? Give us just one good memory that has a chance of working in 2007.

Borad, if you were raising a 10 year-old in 2007, what kinda life would you provide that you think other parents just aren’t doing.

Cooper, you raised the issue of teenagers, weekend outing opportunities and the cost associated with them.  Explain your position in a little more detail.

Talk about not knowing what to do–this morning I received a call from a parent who knew a teenager who witnessed the shooting on Lincoln Ave. This teenager reported after Ebony was hit with the bullet everyone just stood around looking“Not Knowing What To Do!”

Someone in the crowd finally thought to call Ebony’s mother who came to the scene. Ebony was shot close to 11:00 but the ambulance wasn&apos;t called right away and didn’t arrive until 12:00 and she died, says this young man, at the hospital two hours later.

Might she have survived the gunshot to the head, if those standing around had known what to do? 

We don’t have that answer and don’t really need it. The big question, here, is are all of us who have an ounce of sense going to continue standing around watching the wounded or are we going to sound the sirens, race to the scene and do something to save the teens?

Can we do something? What about the rest of you on this Blog list who haven’t been called upon by name?

 TROUBLE IN THE LAND 

 Published On 08-21-2007 , 12:00 AM 

    Ebony Huell has, unfortunately, become the talk of Pasadena. The 16 year-old who was shot to death last Friday night on the sidewalk outside a teen party on Lincoln Ave. in the“colored”section of town wasn’t of any concern to most people prior to her violent death.
    Many are talking about parents who allow their children to attend parties when they didn’t bother to check out the details of the gathering. And, of course, this line of chatter then focuses on why was Ebony permitted to shake her hips at a foot stomping event in the first place.
    Isn’t this kind of conversation getting pretty close to what’s called blaming the victim? Isn’t this pretty much asking about the locks on the barn after the cows have gotten loose?
    Why all the questions surrounding Ebony, her parents and the extended family when we already know most of those in charge of today’s children would fail a due-diligence test if one were given.
    It’s easy to sit on the East side of Pasadena, far from the“colored”section, and ask about parental responsibility and supervision.
    It’s even easier for those who sit in Northwest Pasadena (the colored section) and think their kids are safe because they are watchful parents.
    Ebony’s parents, whether watchful or negligent, did not pull the trigger that fateful Friday night.       Ebony’s parents grieve for their daughter in the very same way those of us who have lost a child to a traffic accident, a birth defect, a health issue or any other act of fate that took their life and left us grief stricken.
    It’s easy to keep the Ebony Huell chatter going but conversation in no way equals concern. Trouble stalks this land, and Ebony was simply a victim of what we all have helped to create.
    As individuals we’ve helped create the trouble and we’ve done that by knowing things aren’t right in our society; down the street, around the corner and on the other side of town. While knowing this, we’ve gone about our personal business of protecting our own but doing nothing to make things better for our neighbors.
     Should Ebony have been at the Hollywood Bowl enjoying the Diana Krall jazz concert where my 16 year-old went that night with her older sister? 
    Should Ebony have been out to dinner at the restaurant in East Pasadena where my friend spent the evening with her 16 year-old twins?
    Ebony and many other young people spent that Friday night in their own comfort zone. Maybe it was at a hip-shaking house party that lacked a chaperon.     
    Maybe it was at a local alley smoking pot. Maybe it was at a friend’s house lounging on the leather couches in the family entertainment center while the adults were in the Bahamas.
    Kids in every neighborhood are about the business of doing what we wish they weren’t doing.  
    If Ebony hadn’t been at the party, wouldn’t someone else’s kid have taken the bullet to the head?
    Well, it wouldn’t have been your child and it wouldn’t have been my Brandi, but shouldn’t we see all children as ours?
    If the lifestyle isn’t good enough for yours or mine, shouldn’t we individually and collectively be working to improve the lifestyle for all children?   
    The chatter surrounding the death of Ebony Huell doesn’t actually have much to do with her or her family because this tragedy is really more about the rest of us.

 ANOTHER KILLING - ANOTHER MEETING 

 Published On 08-14-2007 , 12:00 AM 

   There was another shooting in my town - Pasadena the city of roses. There will be many more. There was another meeting. There will be many more.
   No one at the crime scene ever reports having heard any questions being asked before the weapon was fired.
   In every incident, nearby residents seem able to report hearing gunshots.“I was sitting at my table and then bam-bam-bam,”goes the usual account.
   Eyewitnesses to the violence? It’s almost like everyone in the crowd is blind. Identification of the shooter? It doesn’t seem to happen often enough.
   Cause of the crime? Retaliation? Drug deal gone sour?
   The shootings are all the same. Well, the victims have different names and so do the shooters.The location varies but basically there&apos;s nothing really new?
   Most people at the recemt meeting, like at all the other meetings, had questions to ask. Many of those who didn’t ask questions had a mouthful of comments to make;“The music our kids listen to is violent,”“We need to value pregnant women and the life they are carrying.”
   Solutions were offered at the meeting. Some folk thought the answer to the violence in the‘hood could be contained by local churches playing an active outreach role. Of course there was the usual finger pointing with declarations that the city and other entities are not providing adequate activities for“at risk”youth.             Solutions, of course, included jobs, jobs and more jobs which would give the“at risk”youth self esteem and equally as important it would give them change in their pockets to, in my way of seeing things, afford them the opportunity to acquire some of the many unnecessary trinkets American consumers are programmed to purchase.
   I can’t help but wonder what the unidentified shooters would think about these meetings. Afterall, these culprits seem to have plenty of answers. They seem to do some kind of homework because they know all about creating a crime scene without asking any kind of questions when they get to the death spot.
   Jobs? I suspect these youth are employed, albeit in an underground culture, and are not looking to show up at an early morning hour (early for their lifestyle) to perform a bunch of menial task that require them to wear clothes that don’t fit their way of dressing.
   These youth, who are the focal point of the constant community meetings but who are not in attendance, are earning more money selling drugs than the rest of our youth who are not“at risk.”
   How did these gang bangers, thugs and hoodlums come to take over our, streets, alleyways and front lawns causing us to ask for them back?
   One answer is the rest of us have successfully managed to keep them from joining the American main stream and now when they don’t’behave like“proper folk,”we come together asking what’s wrong with“these kind of people and how do we get them on the right track?”
   We want to know how to fix things. We want to know just how to keep our streets safe. But we don’t want to admit that we, as individuals, contributed to the mayhem. It’s easy to look to the police department to provide programs for youth and to catch the criminals. It’s easy to expect churches to do outreach and save the sinners. But it’s hard for us to admit that as residents of the‘hood’we’ve failed in our job of making our community a community.

 WHO&apos;S MINDING THE KIDS? 

 Published On 07-11-2007 , 12:00 AM 

You tell me who should be arrested in the troublesome story of the ten and twelve year old girl kidnappers.

While this lawless caper took place in a distant land called Enid Oklahoma, a place most of us have never heard of, the parental involvement in the scenario is not different to what I hear all of the time from adults who are in charge of raising children.

The kidnappers, who are sisters, walked into a neighbor’s house and snatched the 3 year-old victim from his bed while the rest of the household slept. A ransom note was left demanding $200,000 for the safe return of the child.

While this fool-hearty but criminal conduct of the youngsters can be seen as a story it isn’t really what matters in his tale of youngsters running afoul of the law.

Daddy, the father of the girls, thinks his kids should not be in juvenile hall and should not have any charges filed against them.

I agree. Daddy should be the one arrested for the act of raising juvenile delinquents and his daughters should be placed in protective custody because he is definitely a harmful influence.

What brought these two youngsters to walk into someone’s home and perform this stupid but dastardly deed and not be able to determine their actions would bring about dire consequences?

The answer is Daddy.

This man, father to one of the girls, appeared in a television interview proclaiming, “why prosecute two girls who didn’t know no better. It was unfair the girls were arrested for the kidnapping. There’s a lot of kids doing the same thing. They’re getting away with it. It’not right.”

This kind of child-raising philosophy is rampant throughout our land. And while not often verbalized in a television interview it is the kind of thinking that produces the wretched children who have permeated our society.

While we are annoyed with lazy, disrespectful, disobedient, lawless, foul-mouthed youth, it’s their parents, who are just like Daddy, at whom the finger should be pointed.

My mother and her friends had the saying,“Show me who your friends are and I’ll tell you who you are.”Let’s change that to“Show me who your kids are and we’ll know who you are!”

It wasn’t that Daddy’s girls didn’t know no better, it was that Daddy’s girls didn’t believe they had to do the right thing. And why not? Daddy has never held them accountable for their actions and in their immature way of thinking they believed life was like Daddy.

The parents of underage kids, who commit crimes, need to face jail time for raising kids based on a philosophical framework that says the little darlings can do no wrong and are not responsible for their actions.

Harsh? In Enid Oklahoma, as elsewhere, ten and twelve year-old kids aren’t responsible for their upbringing. Since they aren’t, who is?

 PARIS HILTON LIVES NEXT DOOR 

 Published On 06-12-2007 , 12:00 AM 

   Is there anything to be gained from the incessant media coverage of Heiress Paris Hilton receiving a jail sentence from a judge for violating conditions of her probation, checking into the facility, being let out by the sheriff, having to go back to court and crying for her mommy when sent back to the slammer? Yes, a whole lot.
   While just about everyone claims to be sick of the Paris headlines and the games being played, as parents we need to take a close look at the deviant behavior being exhibited by this young lady and ask ourselves how much of what we’re seeing is what we foster in our own households on a smaller scale but only smaller because our net worth isn’t comparable.
   Think how often our kids feign illness so not to handle their responsibilities and how many times we let them get by with this, we rationalize, just to keep the peace? 
   Pouting, not eating and claiming depression is a well thought out and highly practiced tactic used by many of our offspring when not getting their way.       Nothing new with Ms Hilton’s game.
Her hoodwinking the county sheriff into sending her home is the same game our daughters are known to play when they get dad to go against what mom has put her foot down about.
   Violating probation? While the outside officials may not impose them, probation violations happen in every home everyday and without consequences.       Many times parents admonish their kids due to some breaking of household rules, issue conditions to be met, and then drop the ball.
   The honest parents will readily admit that the terms of probation they set are all too frequently not adhered to.
   We’re a nation raising little Paris Hiltons but without the celebrity status, media coverage or family contacts. Paris Hilton lives next door, just down the street or right in our very house.
   We say we’re sick of Paris but she’s done nothing more than what we foster and tolerate in our homes. We need to be sick of what we’re doing to our own kids. 
   The debate regarding the fairness of the jail time given the Heiress isn’t different to kids declaring their parents aren’t fair. Isn’t this fairness game one we’ve all heard thrown around as a supposedly legitimate issue to raise?
   Parents hear this one just about everyday and if they’re a parent on the ball with an amount of chutzpa they’re answering back,“life ain’t fair!”
   On being sent back to jail by the judge, that courtroom scenario is definitely one that can’t be compared to the misdeeds of the rest of us parents. I’m not sure young adults, without family money and connections, would have the mind set to go into court and cry loudly, as Paris did, for mommy. This aspect of our young jailbird’s behavior must belong only to the rich and famous.
   I keep hearing the question,“Who cares about her, anyway?” This is usually followed by the comment,“I can’t believe you’re even into that story.”
   Think about Little Paris Hiltons in households across the land and think about what our American parents are doing to create them. Then ask yourselves,“Shouldn’t we all care?”

 COLORED CHICKS RUIN THE DAY 

 Published On 04-06-2007 , 12:00 AM 

Little girls with ruffled dresses, hair filled with bows and curls, shinny new shoes and baskets filled with spring time goodies hanging from their small arms –it must be Easter time.
   Little boys wearing suit, tie, white shirt, stiff shoes that hurt their feet and a basket full of spring time boy goodies –it is Easter time.
   All across America, live rabbits, somehow dubbed Easter Bunnies, will be presented this coming Sunday to many of our little darlings.
   Then there’s this year’s innovative colored live Easter Chicks who come in lavender, baby blue, pink, lime green and whatever color Mom wants to pick to match the rest of her holiday splendor.
   Instead of, or perhaps coupled with, the traditional hunt for hidden colored eggs, the kiddies will also chase colored chicks and the winner will not have to be the kid with the most eggs but the kid whose eggs match the chirping chicks that have been piled into the Easter basket.
   Where’s Dad in all of this? Doing a lot of chauffer duties and scratching his head wondering about all of this nonsense but not daring to open his mouth because he has noticed over the years that Easter stuff is serious business.
   There’s all kind of chauffer requirements for him because, among a million other things, Mom, on Saturday, will have to have her hair and nails done and while she had an appointment, everyone knows beauticians and manicurist are usually behind schedule, but that the days leading up to Easter Sunday are a virtual nightmare.
   Mom will be in the salon on her cell phone, holding on with the one hand that’s already been painted with pale pink laquer (color to match the cutiest chirping chick she purchased and that is still hidden in the garage) and she will be carefully instructing Dad to pick up the little boy’s suit from the cleaners where it’s being altered.
   While Dad, is waiting at the cleaners, because the suit isn&apos;t going to be ready when he gets there, hysterical Mom will call again announcing the neighbor has called and told her there’s a bunch of young colored chicks parading around in their driveway.
   Dad with visions of sexy young African American teenage girls (colored chicks) having invaded his upscale neighborhood will rush from the cleaners back to the homefront to see for himself what’s going on and what the neighbors are thinking of him.
   On the night before Easter, the little girl’s dress will be pressed and hanging on the back of a chair. Socks and underpants to match will be placed in the seat of the chair next to a pair of shinny shoes and the Easter Bonnet, that the hair dresser provided when she couldn’t get the kid’s blonde curls to bob up and down exactly as mom had directed.
   The cleaners closed while dad was seeing to the colored chicks and so the little boy will have no outfit to wear. Dad and son will have to stay at home for the day. Hey, it&apos;s not all bad, maybe these two will spend some of their time together talking about the true meaning of Easter.

 LIFE AIN&apos;T EASY 

 Published On 04-05-2007 , 12:00 AM 

One of my grandmothers had a quince tree in her backyard and every year she picked them, canned them and I suppose even ate the fruit I wouldn’t touch.
Quince? I never saw them for sale at the store and so this homegrown stuff was strange pickings and most certainly not for me.
   I heard things like an“apple a day will keep the doctor away,”but while quince belong to the same fruit family I didn’t even believe the little diddy about the apple, anyway.
   Furthermore, while I was told to eat my vegetables, and I did do that, I was never brought to understand the power of eating the right foodstuff.
   Most certainly I knew that candy caused cavities and the family made sure the children in the household did the right thing when it came to teeth. Due, in part, to the lack of sugar stuff, I never had a cavity until I was mid-twenties and carrying out my own reckless disregard for doing the right thing.
   Sometime during the war years, that is WWII, my family had what was called a Victory Garden. Unlike my grandmother’s homegrown quince, the carrots, lettuce, string beans and corn were familiar items and I had no trouble consuming what I could walk out the back door and gather.
   Junior high school curricula dictated that girls take a cooking class. Unfortunately it had nothing to do with nutrition and Ms Klopp (ugh) my teacher wasted hours of our time running us through the steps of measuring and cooking oatmeal.
   Of course, we never were led to understand the nutritional value of the gooey hot cereal.
   Have things changed? Fortunately my older children, last one graduating somewhere in the mid-80’s, didn’t have to take cooking in school but there were no mandatory nutrition classes.
   Have things changed? I haven’t heard of any required nutrition classes during her my tenth graders years of schooling but I have heard about the junk food machines available on campus. Should nutritional knowledge come from the home? Of course, however, the parents generally don’t know any more about good nutrition than what they learned, themselves, growing up. 
   We can make a few changes.
   Fresh fruits and vegetables? “I buy canned everything because it is cheap,”said one mother. Another said,“I don’t bother, my kids don’t eat their vegetables or fruit and they wouldn’t even know the difference.”
Fresh fruits and vegetables can be expensive but they don’t outweigh the cost of cakes, pies, cookies, soda pop, potato chips and candy.
   I bought strawberries from a man who brings them to the city directly from organic growers. Biting into the berries is like biting into an orange when it comes to the juice that drips. In my house the cookie jar has lost out to the berry basket. And for the cookies, my father knew what he was talking about when he always cautioned,“A moment on the lips means a lifetime on the hips.”
   Moving away from the bad stuff is a difficult transition, but who ever said life was easy?

 TURKEY SQUABBLE 

 Published On 12-01-2006 , 12:00 AM 

Whatever squabbles emerged at this year&apos;s turkey gathering of relatives can&apos;t equal the allegations of criminal intent and the filing of a police complaint regarding the alleged assault on a Muir High School football player following this year’s Turkey Tussle at the world famous Pasadena Rose Bowl.
    The parents of the football player provided me with a tape of the incident for our Live Talk About Parenting with Shirlee Smith show. The purpose of the tape was to provide the viewing public an accurate account of what the parents said was attack on their son, Phillip Morrow, #24, who was hit in the face by an unknown assailant dressed in black.
   The family’s tape clearly documents this incident.
   There were many camera crews on the field that night including a company shooting a documentary on“cross town rivalry.”But after everyone&apos;s footage was reviewed, frame-by-frame, no one turned up #24 and the man in black. 
   The crew members searched long and hard for the incident following the local newspaper&apos;s front page story on the assault.
   Talk About Parenting Live with Shirlee Smith made it to the airwaves with the only camera proof of the parent’s charges. But alas, all that was supposed to glitter turned out not to be gold.
   Callers to the show, teenagers among them, believed the“hit/push”or whatever they saw on the tape, was not done in malice. Every caller said they found the action by the man in black to be part of what regularly happens on the filed after any game.
   Viewers who then logged on to the website to“vote”in the campaign that asked a series of questions related to the incident, unanimously voted in favor of this not being cause for parental, criminal or legal concern.
   Callers to the program really wanted to know where the parent was coming from. We got the mother on the telephone.
   “Yes,”she said she agreed the physical contact with player #24 was not unusual behavior at a football game. “It happens all the time,“she said and went on to declare she objected to it ever happening and because it always happens doesn’t make it right.
   We also learned from mom, that the tape she had provided us didn’t actually show the first time #24 was hit by the spectator and that security needs to be tight enough at games to keep those on the sidelines from entering the field. She declared it was a dangerous activity.
   Mom felt some one of the many camera crews on the field had this footage but wouldn’t make it available to her. I happily explained the reasons any owner of such a camera shot wouldn’t be hiding the exclusive goods.
    Is this the end of the Scuffle at the Tussle? Is this the end of the gobble squabble?
   UPDATE! since the airing of the show, mom has provided a print out from a web blog that backs up her story about available camera footage of #24 being struck in the face mask.
   More to come, maybe, at a later date.
   Don&apos;t forget to vote at the top of the home page.

 STUDENT&apos;S WINNING ESSAY PUTS HER ON A FLOAT IN THE 2007 ROSE PARADE 

 Published On 11-22-2006 , 12:00 AM 

 Congratulations Christina! 
      
      Thanks much for submitting your winning essay.
          Christina will be riding on the city of Alhambra&apos;s float in the Rose Parade.


                    One of Six Winning Essays for the 2007 Rose Parade Essay Contest 

                                                                     Good Nature 
 

 In the midst of a chaotic world plagued with poverty and war, it’s difficult to find a positive influence to rely on. Fortunately, I’m not one of the many deprived of such an influence. I have my parents and teachers to motivate and encourage me. It’s their good nature that will help mold me into someone future generations can look up to. 
  I always thought that my mom’s compliments on my writing were her way of trying to boost my self-esteem. I told her this and she simply replied,“If I didn’t believe in you and think that you were really good at writing, I’d just tell you to drop it and try something else”. Without knowing it, she has taught me how important honesty is in a good-natured person.
  Growing up, I never really thought of my teachers as people. But as I grew older, I began to look at them as positive role models. I’ve discovered that their speeches, lectures and scolding have purposes—to help their students make the right decisions in school and in life. They could have chosen to do anything else with their lives, but they chose to help us kids. I now recognize their desire to help and teach as characteristics of good-natured people.
  Without the good nature of my parents and teachers, I wouldn’t be the person I am today. They have shown me what a difference it can make in someone else’s life to be honest, selfless, and so much more.

 KEEP THE FAMILY CONVERSATION CURRENT 

 Published On 11-12-2006 , 12:00 AM 

    I’m generally amazed when astonished parents discover their student is able, in some meaningful way, to discuss current events.
   “I just couldn’t believe he knew so much about the invasion of Iraq and even had a view point regarding the whole controversy,”said one mother who seemed to be a well-informed person, herself.
   A father told me his daughter knew much more about the propositions on the California ballot than he did. He went a little further in his confession by shamefully explaining, and in painful detail, how he dodged joining any conversation where he would be“out-ranked”by a middle school kid.
   Current events, as they get labeled in the classroom, weren’t meant to be just a school thing. How can any household that includes young growing minds, actually function without constant talk that includes the news of the day, week or month.
   Pops, in his confession, said he didn’t really spend conversation time with his two children, both in middle school, other than finding out about their school day. Of course, he didn’t get far with that because, his kids like so many others, generally said nothing had happened. 
   Our young people love to report just another dull day on the elementary school playground or on the middle and high school campus even though at recess Juan was knocked unconscious when he ran into a poll and on the middle or high school campus fifteen squad cars surrounded the place during the afternoon hours.
   Kids know a lot more than they are willing to talk about. But how very discouraging when they know something about current events and the parents aren’t willing to have a conversation about important social issues.
   Who said current events only belonged in the classroom? Try trumping the classroom by having round table discussions at home and let the teachers be surprised when your kid heard it at home, first.
   Pasadena’s had just about the biggest real news item of the year. Well, that means if you join me in discounting the Rose Parade as news. And while All Saints Church got worldwide attention when the IRS decided to investigate them regarding a sermon delivered by the Rev. George Regas, Senator John Kerry’s recent remarks at Pasadena City College regarding who serves in the military has been an item much more far reaching.
   When it comes to having conversation at home about issues that surround us, Kerry’s remarks hit home because every family knows someone in the military and it may even be a relative. And before Kerry spoke, did any of us think our loved one, neighbor or friend was, well to paraphrase Kerry’s remarks,“kinda dumb?”
   Kerry’s slip of the lip and his afterward explanation as to what he meant to say are so closely aligned to kids in the home and their “covering buttocks”routine followed by them wondering how parents see through their nonsense is a slam-dunk parent–child discussion topic.

 MEDIA FOCUS ON ADOPTION IS SKEWED 

 Published On 10-25-2006 , 12:00 AM 

November is National Adoption month here in America. When we compare media coverage of our own children needing permanent families with that given to one-year old David Banda from Malawi who is being adopted by Madonna, the lack of attention is going to be downright shameful.

Why would I say this? Over the years, I’ve watched the tepid and routine media coverage given children in foster care and have recently become resentful of this foreign focus.

Whether or not the“Material Girl”should be adopting the African boy is an issue for many people including the child’s father who originally was said to have given his total approval but now says authorities failed to explain the permanent conditions stated in the documents he signed. The father cannot read.

But what makes the needs of orphaned Malawians a bigger headline than America’s over 500,000 children in foster care who need permanent homes?

Is it because millions of Malawi children are without families, adequate food, homes or health care in one of the world’s war ravaged and poorest countries?

Probably not.

Most of us realize the media attention we’ve endured over recent weeks had very little to do with any of these troublesome issues or even had much to do with David Banda, for that matter.

I’ve read comments claiming Madonna’s adoption has focused much needed world attention on Malawi’s severe problems but I haven’t read anywhere how that translates into financial and other aid the country needs.

Rescuing Baby Banda from a life of poverty isn’t exactly what Malawi needs but perhaps the 3 million dollars Madonna has pledged to help 900,000 orphans in the country is on a better track. This pledge, and others like it, ought to be what the public is learning more about–if there are pledges being made.
 
Yes, all children deserve the best life can offer, but maybe helping the people of Malawi take care of their own is a more humane and culturally sensitive way to approach the country’s problems.

We’ve got folks right here in Altadena, Dorothy Garcia and Tom Harding who’ve taken this kind of approach to African health and poverty issues.  They work with a group of women in South Africa and have helped them establish a business promoting and distributing their cultural artwork .

Neither Garcia or Harding have star power but they do have a commitment to helping the women in the South African township maintain their culture and at the same time provide for the children.

Adoption is a wonderful commitment and across America, everyday, ordinary people are rescuing children from the child welfare system and providing them good homes. Ordinary people frequently have to wait many months to obtain custody of an adoptee that, most times, is much older than Banda because the majority of children in foster care are much older, thereby, presenting a larger parenting challenge.

Let’s see how much coverage this year’s National Adoption Month,“Answering the Call,”with a focus on adopting teens gets in the media. And just in case it doesn’t get constant or even adequate commentary over the air waves, mark your calendar and tell others we even have a National Adoption Day coming up November 18th.

 JONBENET RAMSEY OVERKILL 

 Published On 08-17-2006 , 12:00 AM 

If you formerly disagreed with those of us who said the news we&apos;re fed is basically crap and that these over rated media conglomerates fail to provide people with the issues and events they need to know about, the breaking story of the last two days has surely brought you to see the light.

I suspect none of you on this Blog List actually believe what the media gives the population. You&apos;ve most likely been sick of coverage before now, but with the recent capture of the Kiddie Super Model&apos;s alleged killer, disgust and stomach churning amonst the population out there has pretty much reached epedimic level.

This&quot;breaking&quot;story, with pundits, reporters and rolling of old film footage has taken us to an unprecedented level of tawdry entertainment.

And that&apos;s about all the news is these days - entertainment and bad entertainment at that.

But one thing that stands clear and different to the pounding and crazy beat of every media outlet is the dignity and common decency displayed by JonBenet&apos;s family.

Her father spoke in support of justice and cautioned against a guilty verdict pronounced by the media prior to the suspect going to trial.

JonBenet&apos;s aunt eloquently stepped away fomr the CNN reporters questions by giving a brief and tasteful condemnation of the circus environment that is taking place.

This family exudes a level of decency that puts reporters at a loss when it comes to responding to them. 

But is there any news out there? Surely there is something important going on that we, the public, ought to be hearing about.

Maybe it&apos;s just me and the public needs and wants what we&apos;re getting including information about the prime suspect&apos;s life and behavior in grade school.

How do we stop this madness?

You&apos;re right. The answer is simple. Turn off the boob tube. When reading the newspaper, just start at page 5 and miss the latest (repeat) information on the murder suspect.

Maybe tomorrow it will be over because the media fools will have realized the confession has come from a sick man looking for all the publicity he can get.

Oh, Lord help us, the media will continue to grind this story whether their headline reads truth or folly.

 ONE MORE GADGET TO SNATCH 

 Published On 08-15-2006 , 12:00 AM 

Recent news tells us iPod theft is on the rise. The media has gone all out to give Apple some un-paid for promotion for their trendy little gadget. A gadget that’s little in size but far from the same in price.

And parents, as usual, are in a quandary.

Solutions to these kinda things are really quite simple and can be handled with a quick two-letter word–NO.

“Ah, Ms Smith, you say that but all the kids have iPods so after the first one was stolen, I had to buy him another one.”

Yup, right from off her boy went the earphones; the pod, the carrying case and I can’t remember the other component that helped mom, who earns minimum wage on two different jobs, loose close to five hundred bucks.

Buy another one? Why?

Because all the kids have‘em!

All the kids really do have‘em because the have-nots are stealing from the ones who bought‘em.

How to keep your kid’s iPod safe from the culprit have-nots? Simple, just say no. Don’t buy or let them buy one in the first place. This way, you’ll never have to have a conversation about a second place purchase. I’m talking about that replacement the “Ah, Ms Smith woman,”was moaning about.

I know a thing or two about iPods. Yes, my 15-year-old has one AND only because she received it as a Christmas gift.

One thing I’ve learned is the gadget serves the teenage purpose of tuning out parents.
The next point of information is recognizing the imaginary need for the quarter of a million accessories to be had because once the basic unit is acquired their little eyes of desire continually crave more.

Beyond the accessory lunacy comes the upgraded models and for our offspring who are constantly programmed to buy, buy, buy, they can’t help but want the latest“what’s in”model.

I suspect by now there are more iPod models than there are Harry Potter books. Which, by the way, cost only a fraction of the price for the cheapest iPod. A book has got to be a better investment than a plug in the ear.

Well, I guess maybe I’m wrong since we’ve had no news involving thefts of Harry Potter books or thefts involving any books kids ought to be reading.

What’s a parent to do? 

(1) Don’t buy an iPod–no theft here
(2) If your kid must have one, than it should never leave the house- no theft here
(3) If you can’t hold the line about it leaving the house and it goes out and gets stolen it  shall not be replaced - no two thefts here.

 IS McDONALD&apos;S FOR EVERY BODY? 

 Published On 07-30-2006 , 12:00 AM 

The other morning, Saturday to be exact, I tried pulling my red Oldsmobile into my local McDonald&apos;s drive-thru. The place in the&quot;hood&quot;was jammed. SUV&apos;s hanging out into the street.
   Kiddie heads were popping up from the front and second row seats and even a few vehicles were sporting young ones in car safety seats.
   &quot;Hm,&quot;I mumbed to myself as I thought about safety seats but unsafe food. Oh, well, that&apos;s the hood I reasoned circling past the Golden Arches and heading to the freeway and the affluent community of La Canada Flintrdige just minutes away from my hometown of Altadena.
   The well-heeled moms on the other end of the freeway, just like all the ones with the fake Chinese hair where I live, were lined up at their McDonald&apos;s in the same brand of flashy super-sized Sport Utility Vehicles I had just encountered in the &apos;hood.&apos;
   What was going on?
   Big and little, old and young, blond and brunette white skinned kids were, just like their dark skinned counterparts, waiting eagerly for their early morning treat from the international king of fast food restaurants.
   What were all of these children doing up so early, dressed and out ?
    The moms I used to know never let their kids out of bed that early on a weekend. Back when I did the parenting routine for a house full of crumb snatchers, the name of the game was sleep LATE and breakfast is called brunch. If you&apos;re not asleep, pretend. If your&apos;e awake, READ.
    I thought briefly to park and observe this&quot;Mom and Them&quot;routine but decided against it because I was sure those with the purchased Chinese hair I had seen in the hood were the same women I saw shortly afterwards but in whiteface wearing bangs and shoulder-length bobs and flips.
   McDonald&apos;s is for everybody. Never mind the neighborhood. Never mind the income level. Never mind the education level. Never mind the old adage,&quot;You are what you eat.&quot;
   I wasn&apos;t going to wait in the long line; I was only there for a bag.
    A bag of what?
    Just a bag. 
   For my wonderful Brandi, who was indeed home and still asleep, I had a present and needed the perfect wrapping for  &quot;Chew On This,&quot;the book by Eric Schlosser the author of&quot;Fast Food Nation.&quot; 
   The gift is quite a hit in our house. Will it be enough to kill the craving for McDonald&apos;s fries , Big Macs and toy trinkets?
    From all the&quot;ughs&quot;I hear as she turns the pages and from the&quot;You won&apos;t believe this ,&quot;type of comments I&apos;m hearing, she&apos;s not quite as happy as she used to be or as McDonald&apos;s wants the rest of us to be.

 MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS IN PRE-SCHOOLER&apos;S DEATH 

 Published On 07-10-2006 , 12:00 AM 

Rita Foster?  Folks in my hometown are beginning to wonder if that’s the real name of the 4-year-old child who was hit and killed by a bus in front of her apartment complex as she rode down the steep driveway into a busy street.

Things just aren&apos;t adding up. 

Akua Jitihadi, the person sometime referred to as the foster mother, but according to Pasadena Police spokesperson, Janet Pope Givens, the woman is, in actuality, a caregiver with full guardianship.

Folks in my hometown are also beginning to wonder how much of Akua (which is African meaning a girl child born on Wednesday in Akan) Jitihadi’s claims are accurate.

Someone please correct me here, but if this caregiver, who the police department declares bares no fault in the tragedy, is indeed the full guardian, does that mean when MTA pays out a settlement she will collect for being negligent?

Why would I call a grieving caregiver negligent? Because I believe she was. (please read previous blog- Parent Should Be Held Responsible in Pre-schooler&apos;s Death) 
 
No, of course the bus driver wasn’t at fault but MTA will write and send a check for pain, suffering and related expenses. But who will it be sent to?

Where is the birth mother? Will she be the collector?

What connection does the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services have to this case? Will they collect on the death? 

Speculation is running rampant throughout the community suggesting the department is“laying low”because they don’t want another“child death”on their records.

If this is a case of full guardianship, was it obtained through Children’s Court or
otherwise?

Does full guardianship mean no oversight meaning; quite simply, a caregiver is on their own with no rules, regulations or requirements.

“This just doesn’t set right with me,”said one parent who attended the Vigil held last week but requested her name not be used. “It’s been claimed the little girl was allowed to play outside at that late hour because it was too hot in the house, but the adults were in the house. What’s going on here?”She asked in annoyance.

Another parent who came to the vigil with her two young foster children told me the tragedy sent out a wrong message when it came to foster care because most people believe“these parents”don’t care about the kids, anyway, which she said certainly is not an accurate statement in her case.

This parent captured the essence of conversation in our so-called city of roses. All over my town, the conversation goes just like she said. “But wasn’t the little girl a foster child? Uh, huh, it figures!”

The Pasadena Police Department holds a mighty important role in this matter. Why do they claim the caregiver bares no fault? Do the police hold the ticket to the disbursement of the MTA check?  

Forget about the money. In plain simple terms, why should the police bother to investigate a matter that, quite frankly, doesn’t really matter to anyone? Who really cares that 4-year-old Rita Foster isn’t around anymore to play outside without adequate supervision because it’s too hot in the house?

I’ve heard a happy file is a closed file. No questions to be asked. No overtime hours to be assigned and paid for. No follow-up needed.

Case Closed.

 DAVID SANDERS QUITS POST AS LOS ANGELES COUNTY DIRECTOR OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES 

 Published On 06-29-2006 , 12:00 AM 

Everyone&apos;s favorite department, which is also fondly called&quot;The Kid Snatchers,&quot; will be looking for a new commandant. 
   Everybody&apos;s buddy, David Sanders, Ph.D, ain&apos;t hanging in like his predecessors did. Sanders knows a few things Anita Bock and Peter Digre learned the hard way. Given enough time, a director&apos;s lack of direction for this troubled instituion will become obvious to all.
   I remember working with (well actually against) Peter Digre and his charismatic approach to not getting anything done for the children. I published many articles calling his hand. As a member of the Los Angeles County Commission for Children and Families I always had questions regarding the faulty reports he provided. 
   As usual, I was the&quot;odd man&quot;out. Rather than seeing any merit in my criticism of this man I was instead seen as hostile, belligerent and fault-finding.
    Peter was eventually sent on his way, hopefully he isn&apos;t out there somewhere ruining the lives of children in another county somewhere.
   Then came Bock who, as a guest on our show, rattled on incoherently about programs and policies that had nothing to do with the children who died under her watch.      
   She, like Digre, got sacked!
   The almost identical departure styles of these former custodians of the most vuneralbe in our society is the lesson learned by Sanders; hang around long enough and you&apos;ll be outed by your own bad deeds.
   While the higher-ups, those holding the power to oust these folk, wait a whole lot longer than those of us who are powerless to do more than point a finger, the big boys eventually see the light.
   And smart David Sanders, Ph.D, ain&apos;t waitin&apos; for that to happen.
   Is Sanders leaving the children of Los Angeles County to spend more time with his family (like the folks in trouble always say)? No one said he retired from public service.
   Is Sanders leaving because he needed a better paying job?
   Maybe the guy is taking a position somewhere else that will allow him to serve children better.
   Anyway, Sanders be done.
   Okay, Board of Supervisors, who gets hired for the next commandant in charge of the Los Angeles County Death Camps?

 HOW MANY KIDS ARE IN FOSTER CARE? 

 Published On 05-03-2006 , 12:00 AM 

A simple answer to this question is; too many! But what&apos;s to be done to decrease the numbers? Some would suggest adoption. Others might say placement with relatives and then there&apos;s that bunch of hard heads that say let&apos;s teach parents how to parent. Oh, we&apos;ll never get them all to see the light, but if just some heavy emphasis were placed on getting the folk, who delivered all these little bundles of questionable joy into this world, to understand what their real job was, maybe life would be better for the kids. Parents spend a whole lot of time and money on cars, parties, clothes and entertainment. Let&apos;s redirect this energy and get &apos;em to learn about creating a good life for their kids. Okay, we&apos;ll always have some troublesom families, but even though it might put the social workers and the rest of their cohorts out of business, the emphasis on learning to be a parent would surely decrease the reported 518,000 children in foster care.

 Disproportionate Number of African Americans in the System 

 Published On 04-29-2006 , 12:00 AM 

With such an overwhelming number of African American children in foster care, a quick thinking person might determine my folks don&apos;t know how to raise their kids. But let&apos;s please ask that you give the matter a little more thought and not be caught thinking too fast. Who was the entertainment personality who had her baby in her lap while driving the SUV through traffic? It is a law that all children up to 8-years of age be in a child restraint seat/seat belt and in the back seat of any car. There weren&apos;t any officers at the scene hauling the kid away and calling on Children&apos;s Services to house the kid while mom was investigated. But that would have been the case in South Central Los Angeles, the hood, just 15 miles away from the ritzy neighborhood where the incident took place. You get my point! Different strokes for different folks. How come so many African American children are in foster care?

 20,000 Young Adults Age Out of Foster Care Every Year 

 Published On 04-29-2006 , 12:00 AM 

    Aging out of foster care is a most outrageous concept and practice. Biologiclal parents aren&apos;t afforded the luxury of waving a fond farewell to their offspring once the kids have reached the golden magical old-age of eighteen, so why should foster parents have this chance to turn their backs on kids who aren&apos;t prepared to survive on the mean streets of America? 
    Back in the day, at 18 years of age girls were getting married and the boys they married had some sorta job at the packing plant or maybe the post office. Rent was cheap and so was just about everything else. That ain&apos;t the case these days. 
     And further more, all too often, kids in foster care haven&apos;t done well in school or had classes that are job preparation. Nor are these kids apt to have been with families who took care to help them through real life hurdles. Kids in foster care are usually struggling against all odds and have medical or mental issues to boot. AND then they get booted out the door at eighteen as the final slap on the butt. 
    You think maybe this ain&apos;t quite true. Think again. I know too many foster parents who had no problem, after raising the kid for ten to fifteen years, booting &apos;em. 
    Aging out is a bad practice that ought to get the BOOT. 
    Foster parents need to be committed to preparing children for the real world and keeping the youngun&apos;s under the household wing until they&apos;re ready for flight!
