 In America, fast food has become our comfort food. We eat it while driving, watching television or sitting at the computer—all without doing much physical activity . It doesn’t help that moderation has been replaced by over-sized portions, either.

However, there’s a way to fit fast food into your life without derailing your diet. But we first have to learn how to make it work for us—not against us. Not all fast food is bad, and there are plenty of choices we can make at most fast-food restaurants to support a healthier lifestyle.

Here are 10 tips to keep in mind as you visit your favorite fast-food restaurant:

1. Eat slowly and listen to your body signals. You’ll feel satisfied with a smaller portion after 20 minutes or so, which is how long it takes for your brain to realize that you’re full.

2. Instead of a foot-long submarine sandwich, go for the 6-inch sub. Ask for whole-wheat bread instead of white bread, and use mustard instead of mayo to cut fat and calories.

3. If you’re going to indulge, one slice of cheese pizza will satisfy your craving and keep calories and fat at a minimum.

4. Salads are healthier when you use fat-free dressing or no dressing. Otherwise, your salad, dressed with high-calorie, high-fat toppings, does more damage than a jumbo hamburger with all the fixings.

5. Low-fat and low-sodium soups warm you up and satisfy hunger on a chilly day.

6. Basic bean burritos are a much better option than“loaded”tacos.

7. Double burgers are double trouble; they’re loaded with excess fat and calories. Choose a junior or regular hamburger with mustard, lettuce and tomato (hold the cheese, please).

8. Grilled chicken sandwiches and wraps are another great meat option.

9. One egg on an English muffin or bagel is a great way to start the day. Try some hotcakes with fruit and/or yogurt for another healthy (and tasty) breakfast option.

10. Have a plan before you enter a fast-food restaurant; it will help defend you against the sensory overload and subsequent sabotage. Remember: If we fail to plan, we plan to fail.
