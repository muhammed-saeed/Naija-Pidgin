Chapter Four: The Killer General
====

What? Jennifer asked in horror and disbelief as she stood in her
bedroom, looking at her fathers, an expression of horror on her face.

Daniel hid a grin. Ever since the two men had found out that
Jennifer had kissed a boy, he had been working overtime to try and curb
Jack&apos;s protective instincts. He&apos;d at least managed to persuade
his husband that he didn&apos;t need to pay the boy a visit, nor did he need
to sic Teal&apos;c on the young man. It had taken a bit more time to
convince his lover that Jennifer didn&apos;t need a chaperone
twenty-four/seven.

As for Daniel, he wasn&apos;t convinced that Jennifer&apos;s illness was a result
of one short kiss, especially since their daughter claimed it was a
closed-mouth kiss. While Jack inwardly had a few doubts himself,
he found it easier to blame his daughter&apos;s would-be suitor.

This is not up for discussion, Jennifer, Jack informed her, giving
the teenager a stern look.

It won&apos;t be that bad, Jen, Daniel tried to reassure their eldest
child.

The rebellious teen just looked at him with disbelief as she argued,
Not that bad? You want me to invite Peter over for dinner one
night, with all eleven of us, and you think it won&apos;t be that
bad? She shook her head. If he isn&apos;t scared off by the
idea of having dinner with thirteen people ...

If he&apos;s scared off that easily, then he isn&apos;t worth knowing, Jack
growled as he stood, toying with a CD case that had been setting on
their daughter&apos;s desk. ~How can she listen to this stuff?~

If he isn&apos;t scared off by that, he will be by Dad&apos;s interrogation,
Jennifer retaliated. Flailing her arms about to accentuate her
pleas, she looked Daniel and whined, Daddy, you know how intimidating
Dad can be.

~I do my job well,~ Jack thought, looking pleased with himself as he
flipped over the CD to read the song list. ~These are
songs? Looks like a foreign language to me.~

Standing with his hands in his pants pockets, Daniel rolled his eyes at
his lover&apos;s smug expression and reiterated, Jen, I won&apos;t let Dad
interrogate Peter, but we do want to get to know him.

And tell him that if he so much as touches you again ... Jack mumbled.

Dad! Jennifer exclaimed, plopping down at the end of her full-sized
bed.

Jack, stop it! We&apos;ve already had this conversation, the younger
man warned. Daniel turned his attention back to the distraught
teenager. ~I can see the wheels turning in your head, Jennifer,
but nothing is going to change our minds.~

~This has to get their attention,~ Jennifer thought, scooting back a
bit on her bed, bringing her left leg to rest atop the bed. What
about Toto? I thought you didn&apos;t want strangers in the house
until Bean Sprout is born?

Daniel chuckled, Nice try, Jen, but we weren&apos;t planning on taking
Peter into the den. The monitors will be disconnected and put out
of sight for the duration of his visit. To be clear, what we&apos;ve
said is that we are going to limit the number of guests we have at one
time, and you know when we have guests, the den is locked.

The younger man shrugged slightly. He and Jack had sworn to keep
the den locked anytime they weren&apos;t in it, but the practicality of
doing that had worn out only a few days into their resolve. They
trusted their children not to enter the den, so while the doors were
always drawn to keep the pets out, it wasn&apos;t normally locked, except
when company was in their home.

Can&apos;t we leave it for a bit longer? Jennifer begged. ~Dad will
kill him before Peter gets out three words.~

No, Jack answered firmly, not willing to give an inch on the
subject. ~The sooner this kid sees what he&apos;s up against, the
sooner we&apos;ll be rid of him.~

Daniel nodded in agreement and explained, I&apos;m sorry, Jen, but this
really isn&apos;t up for negotiation. We would like to meet Peter, and
if you won&apos;t ask him to dinner, we will.

~Gawd, that would be worse!~ Jennifer lay back on her bed,
putting her hands over her face as she complained, He&apos;ll never speak
to me again.

What&apos;s it going to be, Jennifer? Jack asked, putting the CD down and
walking to the edge of her bed.

The teen sighed, I&apos;ll ask him. She sat back up, shaking her
head. It&apos;s so embarrassing.

Not yet, but it will be, Jack threatened, smiling smugly as Jennifer
again lay back down, her head still shaking back and forth at the
unfairness of it all.

Jack!

The older man gave his husband an unrepentant shrug and walked out of
the bedroom, leaving Daniel alone with the girl. He sat on the
side of the bed and glanced back over his shoulder at the
still-groaning girl.

Jen, I know this has been a difficult few weeks, but I hope you
remember that we love you, and we&apos;re going to do whatever we have to in
order to protect you from ...

You don&apos;t need to protect me from Peter, Jennifer whined.

I wasn&apos;t going to say anything about Peter, Daniel rebutted.

You weren&apos;t? Jennifer sat up, scooting forward to sit on the
side of her bed, next to her younger father. Then from whom?

From yourself, Daniel responded, looking her straight in the
eye. Jen, you&apos;re sixteen years old, and you think you know
everything. You don&apos;t, and until you&apos;re at least eighteen, Dad
and I are going to protect you as much as we can.

Daddy, I know what you&apos;re saying, but I&apos;m not a child, the girl
argued.

You lied to us. You went behind our backs, and you&apos;re paying the
price for that, Daniel admonished.

Yeah. Mono isn&apos;t fun, Jennifer bewailed, her shoulders sagging
slightly.

Daniel sighed in exasperation, I wasn&apos;t talking about that.

Then what are you talking about? a perturbed Jennifer queried.

Trust, Jen -- our trust, Daniel answered, his eyes boring into his
daughter&apos;s. Try looking at the bigger picture, the one beyond
your being sick and being punished for having an attitude last
month. If you had trusted us from the start, would any of it have
happened?

It was one little kiss, Jennifer defended, shuffling her feet against
the floor.

Sighing, Daniel stood and walked to the doorway, where he looked back
at their daughter and pointed out, Jen, you&apos;re looking at one
moment. You&apos;ve kept this boy to yourself for a long time
now. There have been lots of little hints and signs that he&apos;s
been a part of your life, but you haven&apos;t shared any of that with
us. Trust, Jen ... from the beginning, not just the kiss. Think about it, he urged as he turned and left the girl alone.

~Crap!~ Jennifer sighed as she lay back down again, staring up at
the ceiling. Parents, she lamented aloud. They just
don&apos;t understand teenagers!

====

What do you think, Munchkins? Jack asked, holding up four shirts at
the clothing store. Powder blue, navy blue, midnight blue, or
sky blue?

Jack and the Munchkins were on a shopping excursion for Daniel, whose
birthday was fast approaching.

Daddy says he needs new brown shirt, Jonny commented, pointing over
at some brown and tan shirts nearby.

Or lavender, Aislinn added.

Jack coughed, Well, Daddy really needs something blue.

Little Danny scoffed at his father&apos;s words and said, Daddy have
drawers full of blue shirts, Dad.

Well, you can never get enough of a good thing, Jack stated happily.

~Mmmm.~ Little Danny looked down at his navy shirt and scrunched
his nose. Then he asked, Dad, why do I have so many blue clothes
like Daddy?

Because ... never mind, Jack answered. We&apos;ll get all four.

Daddy only needs one shirt. He told me so, Aislinn said as she
swayed, clutching her pink dress.

Jack refuted, Yeah, well, I like to spoil Daddy, and it&apos;s his
birthday.

Jonny snickered and said to his siblings, Dad likes Daddy in
blue. You look like Daddy, Little Danny, so you have to wear
blue, too.

The little boy pondered the situation, then nodded, saying an
understanding, Okay.

Choosing to ignore his namesake&apos;s remarks, Jack instructed, Come on,
Munchkins. We have more shopping to do for Daddy&apos;s birthday.

And Katie, Little Danny reminded his father. It&apos;s Katie&apos;s
birthday too.

We&apos;ll get her lotsa toys, Little Danny, Jonny reassured his
brother. Then the youngster grinned mischievously and asked, Do
Katie&apos;s toys need to be blue, too, Dad?

Cheeky devil, Jack chided as he gave a mock glare at Jonny, who
looked extra pleased with himself.

We could make all Daddy&apos;s presents blue, Aislinn suggested.

Yeah, both boys agreed.

Jonny and Little Danny grinned at that idea and began making
suggestions of &apos;blue&apos; presents that they could get Daniel. Jack
imagined Daniel&apos;s expression at being presented with blue birthday
gifts and cringed.

We could get Daddy some blue bubblegum, Jonny recommended.
 
And a blue-tongued lizard, Little Danny suggested. They&apos;re
Australian; that&apos;s where Dad and Daddy went for their honeymoon, and
they&apos;re the largest members of the skink family, and they have dark
blue tongues. They ...

Jack shook his head at the facts falling from his son&apos;s tongue and
quickly interrupted, We aren&apos;t getting Daddy a lizard, Little
Danny. For one thing, we already have a lizard.

He doesn&apos;t have a blue tongue, though, Dad, Jonny pointed out.

We could paint it blue, Aislinn suggested.

I don&apos;t think Bogey would like that, Ash, Jack opined, attempting to
quickly derail that suggestion.

But we could, the little girl argued.

But we won&apos;t, Jack insisted.

But we could, Aislinn said again.

Yeah, we have paint in the garage, Jonny recalled.

I&apos;m good at painting, Aislinn added.

We are *not* painting Bogey&apos;s tongue blue, Jack reiterated.

Why not? Little Danny asked.

Yeah, why not? Aislinn inquired.

Ice cream! Jack called out.

Yah! the Munchkins cheered, each snickering at their successful plan
to get an extra ice cream treat from their father during the outing.

====

Did you enjoy your day, Love? Jack asked when the lovers were in bed
in their deluxe suite in their Boston hotel.

Both were on their backs, looking up at the ceiling. Jack&apos;s arm
was around Daniel&apos;s shoulders, and their heads were leaning against
each other&apos;s. The blanket and bedspread were mussed, only
covering their bodies, naked from their recent lovemaking, from their
waists downward.

Silly question, Daniel replied, turning his head to face Jack and
settling more comfortably against the older man&apos;s arm. It was
the perfect day.

I wasn&apos;t sure how you&apos;d like the oatmeal waffles, Jack chuckled.

Daniel grimaced, then laughed, I loved them.

Jack&apos;s fingers ran lightly through Daniel&apos;s slightly shaggy hair as he
replied, The best you&apos;ve ever had, right?

Ricky and Jenny made them. Did you see their little faces?
Daniel asked with misty eyes.

Angel, I was tempted to help them out, but they were insistent. They worked very hard to make that breakfast for you this morning,
Jack informed his lover. How was the coffee?

Actually, that really was pretty good, but I&apos;ve never had Pepsi
Arabian Mocha before, Daniel admitted. Making a funny face as he
stared back up at the ceiling, he added, I don&apos;t think I want to have
it again, either.

The things parents digest for their kids, Jack chuckled in amazement.

Food of love, Jack, Daniel softly spoke. Nothing tastes better
anywhere.

I know, Jack agreed, remembering his own moments of eating food
prepared by the children that weren&apos;t up to chef&apos;s standards, but yet
had been the best tasting food ever because of the one crucial
ingredient in its preparation -- love.

Maybe we should call and wish them goodnight? Daniel asked hopefully,
missing their brood terribly.

Jack glanced at the clock, saying, It&apos;s only eight-thirty in the
Springs.

Eagerly, the parents made the phone call, happy to chat with all of
their children for a few minutes before returning to their special
birthday trip. After the breakfast prepared by the Spitfires that
morning, all of the brood had surprised Daniel with presents, and then
Daniel and Katie had shared a birthday cake, designed in the shape of a
bone. It worked for Daniel who had frequently dug up human bones,
and for the young beagle, who loved any kind of bone. Afterwards,
as he had so often done over the years, Jack spirited a surprised
Daniel away for a quick but enjoyable weekend in Boston.

Boston had always been a favorite of the two, ever since they&apos;d gone to
a scientific gathering years ago and Daniel had first learned to make
snow angels. Of course, it was winter then, and this was summer,
but, still, the lovers had a special fondness for the historic
Massachusetts city.

With the time difference between their home and Boston, they&apos;d spent
the afternoon walking the cobblestone streets and enjoying a romantic
dinner before returning to their hotel for a cozy evening
together. Daniel didn&apos;t know what Jack had on the calendar for
the weekend, but he knew that whatever it was, he&apos;d be having a
wonderful time because no matter what they did, they&apos;d be lost in their
nation of two.

====

Monday afternoon, with her parents back underfoot after their weekend
away, Jennifer sighed and stared at the phone. She&apos;d been putting
off asking Peter over for dinner, and her parents had finally lost
patience with her. Her cell phone had been temporarily returned
for the purpose of making the call, and she&apos;d also been given a list of
possible dates for the dinner. Her parents had instructed her not
to leave her room until she&apos;d made the call, with a firm reminder that
only *one* call was to be made, and that it had better be made before
dinnertime that night.

A knock on the door had her snatching up the phone in case it was one
of her fathers coming to check on her progress, but a whispered, Jen?
put her mind at rest.

Come in, Bri.

Brianna came in and gave her sister a sympathetic look. The two
sisters had gotten over their fight of a few weeks ago, but were still
inclined to tread gently around each other.

Have you called him yet? Brianna asked.

Jennifer shook her head, saying, What am I supposed to say, &apos;Hi,
Peter, my fathers want you to come over so they can interrogate
you. When do you feel like coming?&apos;

Brianna grinned and then responded, I think there are better ways to
ask him; and you need to trust Daddy, Jen. He won&apos;t let Dad go
too bananas.

The older girl just snorted as she imagined all kinds of tortures Jack
might inflict on her young beau.

Anyway, I came in to give you a heads up. Dad just got back from
the movie with the Munchkins and Spitfires, so I think you&apos;re out of
time. Brianna gave the older teenager an encouraging grin and
observed, Peter likes you, Jen; I don&apos;t think you need to worry.

Thanks, Bri, Jennifer spoke in appreciation.

Once Brianna had closed the door behind her, Jennifer took a deep
breath and began dialing Peter&apos;s number.

====

How&apos;s Bean Sprout? Jack asked, walking into the den later that night.

Bigger, Daniel announced with a smile, placing a bookmark between the
pages of the book he&apos;d been reading and then closing it. By half
an inch!

Way to go, Toto! Jack said, leaning over to kiss the rubbery pouch
that was protecting their unborn child.

Jack, we&apos;ve avoided the issue for weeks, Daniel said, abruptly
steering the conversation towards the topic of naming their unborn
child.

What&apos;s wrong with a little avoidance? Jack asked, flopping down in
Daniel&apos;s desk chair since his husband was in the recliner.

Nothing, when it&apos;s short term, but it&apos;s July now, Babe, and we have to
start thinking about names for our baby.

Our baby, Jack sighed, sitting back in the chair and smiling. Diapers. Two a.m. feedings. Crying, crying, and more
crying.

I can&apos;t wait, Daniel eagerly proclaimed.

Me, either. Want me to get the baby book out? Jack asked
excitedly, recalling the hours they&apos;d spent perusing the book when
attempting to come up with names for the Munchkins and the Spitfires.

Daniel moved his head back and forth slightly as he considered options,
finally determining, Jack, whatever we name this baby, it has to be
special. I mean, all names are special, but this one has to be
...

Special? Jack chuckled.

Sometimes, O&apos;Neill ... Daniel began.

Always, Jackson, Jack laughed, temporarily getting out of the chair
and leaning over to kiss his soulmate. Danny, what happened with
the Munchkins and the twins?

Daniel laughed, We named them on the spot.

So much for planning and researching, Jack confirmed. We&apos;ll
know when Bean Sprout is born what his, or her, name should be.

Nodding and smiling, the younger man replied, I guess you&apos;re
right. For all the time we spent debating on what to name the
children, in the end, the names were just ... in our hearts.

Let&apos;s trust our hearts, Jack urged. They haven&apos;t let us down
yet.

No, they haven&apos;t, the younger man agreed, smiling. So, Jack,
about this dinner with Peter Hamilton ...

I&apos;ll behave, Jack promised.

It&apos;s important to Jennifer, Babe. Please remember that, Daniel
requested.

I will, Danny. Hey, the Munchkins are doing better with their
pronouns. Have you noticed?

Yes, they&apos;re better. They&apos;re still going back and forth, but it
takes time to learn the English language, Daniel stated.

We could teach them Italian, Jack said with a leer. As he moved
over to join his husband in the recliner, he whispered, La mio bello
stella cadente.

I love being your falling star, Daniel replied as he caressed Jack&apos;s
left cheek.

My *beautiful* falling star, Jack corrected.

Ti amo, per sempre e sempre, Jack, Daniel spoke softly. Tu sei
la mia volpe d&apos;argento, e ti amo cosi, tanto tanto.

Jack smiled and, as his hand slipped inside Daniel&apos;s maroon shirt, he
replied, Qui nella nostra nazione di due, il mio cuore batte solo per
te. Tu riempi i miei polmoni di aria, tu fai diventare caldo il mio
sangue.

Daniel leaned in for a tender kiss and then whispered, Quando i miei
occhi si fissano nei tuoi, mi sento cosìcompleto. Vedo solo
l&apos;amore, Jack. Sei cosìsexy. Le mie labbra hanno fame
delle tue.

Letto?

Letto, amore mio, Daniel agreed.

As the lovers kissed, David took hold of Little Danny and Jonny and
pulled them quickly to his bedroom down the hall.

Hey! Jonny protested.

They&apos;re going to bed; that&apos;s what they just said. What were you
two doing listening to Dad and Daddy talking mushy stuff? David asked.

Ewww, Jonny said with a grimace. Were they talking mush,
Little Danny?

Little Danny shrugged, answering, I don&apos;t know that language.

It&apos;s Italian, David clarified, adding, And, yes, they were talking
mush, lots of it.

What did they say? Little Danny asked, wanting to learn the new
language.

Oh, stuff like Dad being Daddy&apos;s silver fox and loving him forever and
always. Dad said Daddy made his heart beat ...

I thought blood makes a heart beat, Jonny refuted.

Not with love, David answered. Daddy said Dad was sexy, and
his lips were hungry.

Huh? Jonny asked.

Never mind. You two better get back to bed before they find out
you&apos;re still up, David advised.

What about you? Jonny challenged.

I had to use the bathroom, so I had an excuse for being up, David
intelligently replied.

Oh, Jonny groaned. We&apos;d better go back to bed, Little Danny.

I still don&apos;t understand about hungry lips, Little Danny sighed as he
headed for the door.

David chuckled, not really wanting to think about hungry lips, either.

====

Sorry, Muffin, Jenny said the next morning, picking up the ball that
sat between the huge dinosaur&apos;s legs. She ran back to the
basketball hoop and tried again to make a basket, cheering when she
made it this time. Continuing a conversation with her sister that
they had begun a few minutes ago, the redhead said, Ash, Dad &apos;n&apos; Daddy
will say &apos;kay.

Say &apos;and&apos;, Jenny. Dad and Daddy say we hafta say and, not &apos;n&apos;,
Aislinn reminded.

Ash, Dad *and* Daddy will say &apos;kay, Jenny repeated with a frustrated
sigh.

I don&apos;t know, Jenny, Aislinn sighed. I really want her,
though. She&apos;s so cute, but Dad already said no yesterday.

Ask Daddy, Jenny suggested conspiratorially with a covert smile.

Aislinn smiled in understanding, confidently expressing, Daddy will
convince Dad!

Daddy &apos;vince Dad of &apos;nthing, Jenny stated, trying for another basket
but missing and giving out an agitated grunt in response.

Aislinn walked over to the green dinosaur that stood in the corner of
the game room. She sat down on the floor between Muffin&apos;s legs
and commented, I don&apos;t know what to name it.

Jenny looked at Muffin, thought about all of their family pets, and
brightly responded, I know!

====

Ash, a guinea pig? Daniel questioned doubtfully as his daughter
fidgeted on his lap as they sat on the sofa in the living room.

Susie said I could have one of the babies. Pleeeeeeease,
Daddy! It&apos;s just a little guinea pig, the little girl pleaded.

Daniel sighed, not sure how to say &apos;no&apos; since some of her siblings
already had pets they thought of as their own.

I&apos;ll see what Dad thinks, Daniel promised.

Aislinn frowned and bowed her head, doing a great imitation of the
patented &apos;Danny Pout&apos;.

Ash? Daniel prompted.

Dad will say &apos;no&apos;. It&apos;s okay, Aislinn said, dismissing her
father&apos;s promise. I don&apos;t need a pet. Getting off
Daniel&apos;s lap, she began to sniffle. She walked to the stairs,
purposely looking back at Daniel and doing a loud sniffle. A tear
fell from her eye. I&apos;m not special like Jonny and Little Danny.
It&apos;s okay.

As the little girl began to walk up the stairs, as if going to her
death, Daniel gave her a glare. He let out a groan as he stood up.

Ash, wait up! Daniel requested.

Just as he reached the stairs, the little girl bounced back down, and
with a smile asked, Yes, Daddy?

You&apos;re a little con artist, you know that? Daniel accused softly as
he knelt down and put his hands on her waist.

Aislinn smiled, saying, I didn&apos;t really mean what I said, but, Daddy,
I really want her. Jenny even helped me name her! Pleeeeease!

Okay, Princess, Daniel acquiesced. I&apos;ll work on Dad for you.

Oh, thank you, Daddy, Aislinn emotionally replied, throwing her arms
around her father.

~Gawd, she&apos;s a perfect little miracle, and she&apos;s got me doing
cartwheels. Oh, well. Life could be worse.~ Daniel
smiled. You&apos;re welcome. As Aislinn hurried upstairs to
play in her room, Daniel thought, ~Now, how am I going to convince Jack
that we need another pet? Seduction -- that&apos;s the answer!~

====

~There&apos;s Little Danny,~ Brianna thought, seeing the young boy sitting
on the floor. He was next to the sofa, facing the monitor that
fed into the den. The young girl had just come downstairs to see
if she could find some siblings to play with. Seeing the
youngster, she was about to say something, but paused at his
expression. ~Wonder what he&apos;s doing?~ she asked herself as she
observed her brother frowning at a piece of paper and muttering to
himself. ~I&apos;ll ask him to play. We can ...~

Brianna&apos;s thoughts came to an abrupt halt when Little Danny, unaware of
her presence, spoke aloud, his words causing the girl to freeze in her
tracks.

... can&apos;t include them; not genetic sisters and brothers. .. maybe
...no.

Brianna stared at her younger brother, hurt welling up inside
her. She had never thought Little Danny viewed the adopted
Jackson-O&apos;Neill children as being different from his &apos;real&apos; brothers
and sisters. Just the month before he had proven himself to her,
but had he changed his mind?

~I must have messed up. He doesn&apos;t really think of me as his
sister. He&apos;s just being nice,~ Brianna sorrowfully thought.

Her heart breaking, Brianna turned and retreated to her room.

Meanwhile, in the living room, Little Danny continued to work on his
project, oblivious to what had happened. The youngster chewed on
the end of his pencil thoughtfully and then decided that he&apos;d have to
consult someone, even if it would mean ruining his surprise.

~Unless ...~

Little Danny eyed the phone and then looked around the room. He
crept into the kitchen and looked out into the yard where both his
parents were playing with Ricky, Jenny, Lulu, Chenoa, Aislinn, and
Jonny. Then he looked at Bijou who had been told to &apos;keep an eye
on him.&apos;

Dad and Daddy won&apos;t mind if I call Aunt Janet will they, Bij? the
young boy asked.

The beagle looked at him, wagged her tail, and went back to the living
room. Taking this as approval, Little Danny grinned and picked up
his pieces of paper and the phone. He took everything upstairs
and waited for Janet to answer.

The boy grinned when he heard her official, Doctor Fraiser, greeting.

Hi, Aunt Janet!

Little Danny! Janet smiled, then frowned unsure whether a
Munchkin phoning her was a good or a bad sign. Fortunately, she
didn&apos;t have to wonder for long as the small boy immediately launched
into a description of his &apos;secret project&apos;, finishing with his
all-important question.

I don&apos;t know what to do, Aunt Janet. Jeff, Bri, Lulu, Jen,
David, and Noa are family, but I know genetics doesn&apos;t work that way,
but then I wondered whether Dad and Daddy could have a gene that made
them pick girls or boys, then maybe I could include them anyway &apos;cause
they&apos;re family, and I can&apos;t leave them out, so can I keep them in and
still have a scientific answer?

~Wow. How does he breathe?~ Janet wondered. She listened to
Little Danny as he repeated his request in more detail, again ending
with the question. Janet had a sinking feeling and wondered how
she was supposed to answer. She really didn&apos;t want to destroy the
little Munchkin&apos;s excitement and enthusiasm, but she didn&apos;t want to
mislead him, either. ~Okay, Janet, think! There has to be a
way out of this. Hey, maybe that&apos;ll work.~

Aunt Janet? the little boy called out, eager for her response.

You know, Little Danny, I think you&apos;re right. We don&apos;t know
everything about genetics, especially human genetics, and, so, for all
we know, there might be a gene that guided your fathers in choosing
your adopted siblings. I think you should include them in your
calculations, Janet advised.

Thanks, Aunt Janet. I didn&apos;t feel good &apos;bout leaving them
out. Remember, it&apos;s a secret. I want to surprise them, the
boy told his favorite doctor.

I won&apos;t tell a soul, and don&apos;t worry, Sweetie. Your parents will
definitely be surprised, the physician opined. ~Horrified, too,
probably, but definitely surprised.~ She shook her head in
amazement, then laughed at the mental picture she got of Jack and
Daniel staring at their son in shock as he announced that Bean Sprout
was a girl. She had to give the youngster credit. His
reasoning was very logical, albeit fundamentally flawed. ~Even
little geniuses aren&apos;t infallible.~

====

Promise me you won&apos;t ask Peter embarrassing questions! Or call me embarrassing names. Or do anything embarrassing, Jennifer begged as she nervously followed her older father around the kitchen while he prepared dinner for their brood.

Jennifer was nervously following Jack around the kitchen as he prepared
dinner for their brood.

I don&apos;t know, Jen. I thought I&apos;d start off the evening by
calling you my lil&apos; pumpkin, or maybe Jennikins, then move on to asking
him whether he&apos;s a virgin and what he believes about sex before
marriage, and maybe finish up the evening by showing him your baby
photos, Jack jovially quipped.

Caught up in her dismay at Jack&apos;s words, Jennifer missed the teasing
grin on her father&apos;s face and just stared at him in horror. Jack
was totally unprepared for her next reaction which was to burst into
tears and flee from the room.

Jack? Daniel came into the kitchen, a questioning look on his
face. Why did Jen just run past me in floods of tears, muttering
about how she&apos;d be alone for the rest of her life? At the guilty
expression on his husband&apos;s face, Daniel sighed, What did you say to
her, Jack?

Danny ...

Jack!

I was just teasing! Jack defended as he hunched both of his shoulders
in innocence. Seeing Daniel&apos;s glare, Jack went into exposition
mode. Okay, she walked in and ...

Once Jack had explained, Daniel didn&apos;t know whether to laugh or shake
his head in disbelief. He ended up doing both and moved to
embrace his soulmate.

I was just teasing her, Danny. She knows I wouldn&apos;t really say
any of those things, Jack sighed.

I know you were just teasing, Babe, and so does Jen, but I think we&apos;d
better lay off the teasing until after the dinner. She knows that
we won&apos;t intentionally embarrass her, but let&apos;s face it, they&apos;re both
going to be pretty embarrassed by the situation without us even having
to do or say anything. Daniel kissed his husband and grinned, asking,
If you were Peter, wouldn&apos;t you be embarrassed and scared?
 
Jack chuckled, Yeah, I guess so.

Anyway, there&apos;s something else we need to talk about, Daniel told his
soulmate.

Uh, uh, that sounds ominous, Jack replied a bit hesitantly.

Daniel grinned, answering, Síy no.

Linguists! Jack raised an eyebrow in question and asked, What
now?

Well, uh, Daniel stuttered, has Ash mentioned a guinea pig recently?

Daniel, we are *not* getting another animal for this zoo, Jack stated
firmly.

Ash really wants her, Daniel commented.

Daniel ...

Jack, Daniel spoke softly as he cozied up to his husband. He
slid his hand down Jack&apos;s chest as he gazed at his Silver Fox&apos;s body
with lust. Gently, he moved his hands to Jack&apos;s back, pulling up
his lover&apos;s shirt to caress the skin at the base of Jack&apos;s back. Ash, uh, really, really, really wants a guinea pig.

Daniel ...

Daniel moved closer, nibbling on Jack&apos;s upper lip. Then he kissed
his husband, his hands slipping down inside Jack&apos;s pants.

Dan...ny ...

Another kiss elicited a moan from Daniel&apos;s crumbling lover. By
the time, the younger man began nibbling on Jack&apos;s ear, the hardened
general was doomed ... and hard.

One little guinea pig, Babe, Daniel requested.

One ... just one, Danny, Jack agreed, melting like butter in a hot
frying pan.

Smiling from his victorious seduction, Daniel stated, I&apos;ll go tell,
Ash.

Daniel turned around, intentionally wiggling his hips in a manner that
left a still-dazed Jack even more out of it. Suddenly, Jack
snapped back to reality.

Hey, what about ...?

What about what, Big Guy? Daniel asked, his wanton eyes looking deep
into Jack&apos;s.

You can&apos;t just leave me like this! Jack exclaimed, looking down at
his bulging mid-section.

Daniel smiled and replied, Sorry, Babe. No time for, uh, you
know.

But, Angel, do you really expect me to stand here now and ... and
cook? Jack asked incredulously.

Why not, I just cooked with sizzzzzling perfection, if I do say so
myself, the younger man said smugly.

With a blink, Daniel disappeared from Jack&apos;s view.

What happened to that scared little puppy I first met at the SGC?
Jack asked, again looking down at his groin which was definitely in
need of attention. Oh, crap!

====

No, Jack said calmly a bit later.

But, Dad ... Jennifer pleaded as they stood in the kitchen as Jack
continued to work on the evening meal.

No, Jack repeated strongly.

Daaaaad!

No, the girl&apos;s father said again.

Why not?

I can see your belly button *and* your ribs. Put something
decent on, Jack ordered.

DAAAADDYYYYYYYY! Jennifer whined as she turned and ran in search of
her more understanding and tolerant father.

====

No, Jen, Daniel said as he put on a new shirt, not happy with the one
he had on before.

But, Daddy, Jennifer sighed exasperatingly, having spent five minutes
pleading with her younger father for support.

Daniel chuckled, then replied, Jen, you have a lot of lovely outfits
in your closet. Go pick one out that you know Dad and I will
like. Hearing his daughter&apos;s groan, Daniel closed the gap
between them and gave her a kiss on the cheek. It&apos;s one dinner,
one night, wearing one outfit that your parents can love.

It&apos;s not one night, Daddy, Jennifer complained. I&apos;m a prisoner
of the Jackson-O&apos;Neill Dress Police.

Laughing again, Daniel said, Look at it this way. The more you
cover up, the less chance Dad will shoot him.

Giving Jennifer a knowing look, Daniel walked out of the room.

Oh, gawd, he&apos;s right, Jennifer lamented as she turned and hurried to
her room.

====

The time had come for Peter Hamilton to arrive at the Jackson-O&apos;Neill
homestead. Jack and Daniel had gathered together ten of their
children for some last minute reminders.

Best behavior, Daniel ordered.

Munchkins? Jack called out.

We be good, Jonny spoke on their behalf.

*We&apos;ll* be good, Daniel corrected.

We&apos;ll be good, Jonny repeated.

Good, Daniel responded with a smile.

Spitfires? Jack called out, looking at them with a serious expression
on his face.

We un&apos;erstand, Jenny affirmed, looking at Ricky, the two nodding
their heads in agreement.

Mavericks? the silver-haired man questioned the newest members of
their brood.

Well, first we thought we&apos;d get a frog ... Seeing Jack&apos;s
hardened expression, Brianna smiled and said, We&apos;re only kidding.

Mouseketeers? Jack asked as he faced David and Chenoa.

We&apos;re one for all, and all for Jen, Chenoa answered.

Daniel advised, Don&apos;t forget. This is very important to
Jennifer. No funny stuff. No spiders. Bogey stays in
his cage. Calico does not get to eat on the table. No field
mice in our pockets. No kidding about kissing.

Geez, Daddy, Aislinn whined.

Smiling, the archaeologist continued, You all know what we mean. Be good.

Oh my gosh! It&apos;s him! Dad, Daddy, it&apos;s him! Jennifer
called out excitedly from her perch at the front window where she&apos;d
been waiting for over twenty minutes.

Relax, Jen. He puts his pants on one leg at a time just like the
rest of us, Jack teased.

I know, Jennifer sighed as she walked into the living room.

How do you know? Jack accused, his parental protectiveness rivaling
his Mr. Jealousy in aggression.

Jack, be calm, Daniel warned. Hearing the knock on the door,
Daniel instructed, Brood, please stay here in the living room. Jennifer, your dad and I will accompany you to the door. Let&apos;s
go.

====

Brianna sighed as she watched Jennifer and her parents walk over to the
door. Her sister always seemed so confident, so sure of her place
in the family. She looked at the Munchkins and wondered why she&apos;d
had to overhear Little Danny earlier.

~Ignorance is bliss,~ the tomboy told herself.

Bri, are you okay? Little Danny asked, having seen his older sister&apos;s
disturbed expression.

The teenager looked down to see Little Danny&apos;s soulful eyes looking up
at her with concern.

Fine, Brianna snapped. She was determined not to spoil this
evening for Jennifer, but she really didn&apos;t want to talk to her little
brother at the moment. It hurt too much, especially because it
was Little Danny. After their little running away episode the
month before, she&apos;d felt particularly close to the little genius; now,
his words earlier in the day had wounded her to the core. She was
really trying not to bring up her old defenses again, but it was a
struggle.

No, you&apos;re not, Little Danny refuted.

Brianna gritted her teeth, counseling herself to ignore the child.

Unfortunately, Little Danny seemed to be in his stubborn mode, and he
pulled on her hand, asking again, What&apos;s wrong, Bri?

Little Danny was frowning, and if Bri didn&apos;t know better, she&apos;d swear
he was genuinely concerned about her.

~Yeah, right, Bri, fell into that trap before, didn&apos;t you?~

Unconsciously, the girl&apos;s old shields began reforming as she wondered
if the whole family had just been fooling her.

Please, Bri, you can tell me. You&apos;re my big sister, Little
Danny told her.

Sadly, that was exactly the moment that Brianna lost her internal
battle, resulting in former defenses springing back into place. The young girl went on the attack.

Well, you&apos;re not my little brother. I wouldn&apos;t want a little
know-it-all like you as family, anyway. You really had me fooled,
Little Danny, and what kind of a stupid name is Little Danny anyway ...

Bri!

Brianna looked up to see Jeff glaring at her, a horrified expression on
his face. His attention had been focused on the twins, but the
venom in Brianna&apos;s voice had captured his attention.

What in blazes is the matter with you? Jeff asked.

Brianna glared back, then scowled down at Little Danny who was looking
up at her in shock, a hurt expression in his blue eyes as fat tears
rolled down his cheeks.

Nothing, Brianna spat. Just telling the little brat a few home
truths.

David, watch the brood, Jeff instructed as he tugged on Brianna&apos;s
good arm, pulling her over to the mantle.

Hey, let go, Brianna said, struggling to get free.

Bri, what&apos;s this all about? Jeff asked.

And just who do you think you are? Brianna challenged.

I&apos;m your big brother; now tell me what has you acting like a sniffling
... brat! Jeff ordered.

I found out the truth, that&apos;s all, Brianna spat angrily, folding her
arms.

Jeff looked over at the door where Jennifer was just taking stock of
herself one final time.

Bri, don&apos;t ruin this for Jen. We only have a minute here. Talk specifics, Jeff firmly requested.

I&apos;m not his sister. I heard him say so, Brianna revealed in a
raised whisper.

I no say that, Little Danny argued, dropping back into child-speak
from his strong emotions..

Eavesdropper! Brianna accused venomously as she looked down at her
little brother.

Bri, I love you. You my big sister. Why you mad at me? a crying
Little Danny asked.

The tears began to soften the tomboy&apos;s shield of armor as she
confessed, I heard you, saying all those things this afternoon. You said I wasn&apos;t your sister.

No, Bri. You no un&apos;erstand, Little Danny said, reverting more
and more to toddler speak as he began to feel vulnerable.

Okay, Jeff said, leaning down and picking up Little Danny.

Bri, Little Danny says you misunderstood whatever he said. Now,
considering he&apos;s crying and that he&apos;s probably the most honest one of
all of us, how about giving him the benefit of the doubt until we can
straighten this out. They&apos;re opening the door, Jeff noted,
motioning over to their parents and a beaming Jennifer.

Bri, love you, Little Danny sniffled.

I love you, too, Brianna admitted, looking away from her little
brother. I know what I heard.

No, Bri, was fig&apos;ring su&apos;prise. I tell now, though, the child
declared vulnerably.

Bri! Jeff warned, glaring at her.

Oh, all right. Come on, you little pip squeak. I believe
you, Brianna said, taking Little Danny from Jeff. You&apos;re too
big for this, she said.

I love you, Bri, Little Danny sniffled as his arms wrapped around her
neck.

~This had better be one heck of a surprise!~ Brianna silently
thought. I love you, too. Let&apos;s dry those tears before Dad
and Daddy get mad at me.

They no get mad. I &apos;tect you, Little Danny promised, still
upset by all that was happening.

Brianna smiled, suddenly noticing the more child-like speak.

~He&apos;s scared. He&apos;s scared because ... geez, I must have
misunderstood.~ Suddenly, Brianna squeezed her little brother to
her tightly. I&apos;m sorry, Little Danny. I guess I
overreacted. I can&apos;t wait to hear about your surprise.

I tell you now. It ...

No, you tell me when you tell everyone else. After all, we&apos;re
all family, right? Brianna questioned, a little smile on her face.

Right, the little boy affirmed, smiling, feeling better at last.

====

At the front door, Jennifer gave her parents one final reprimanding
glare and opened the door.

Hi, Jen. These are for you, Peter Hamilton proclaimed as he
greeted Jennifer. With an embarrassed smile, he handed over a
dozen roses, saying, I hope you like them.

Jennifer beamed and kissed him on the cheek.

**Jack!** Daniel reprimanded as he grabbed a hold of Jack&apos;s belt to
prevent his husband from moving in between the two teenagers.

**She kissed him, Danny!**

**On the cheek, Jack, to say thank you. Now behave yourself.**

Taking hold of Peter&apos;s hand, Jennifer ushered him in the door and began
the introductions.

Peter, I&apos;d like you to meet my parents, Jennifer said proudly. Dad,
Daddy, this is Peter.

It&apos;s nice to meet you, Peter, Daniel graciously spoke. He
smiled and stepped forward to shake the teenager&apos;s hand. Welcome
to our madhouse.

It&apos;s nice to meet you, Mister Jackson-O&apos;Neill, Peter said as he shook
Daniel&apos;s hand, darting a nervous look at Jack whose smile looked more
like a grimace.

*Doctor* Jackson-O&apos;Neill, Jack corrected.

Peter coughed and then bravely turned to face Jack, extending out his
hand as he said, It&apos;s nice to meet you, too, General Jackson-O&apos;Neill.

**At least he got our names right.**
 
**Jack! Give Peter a chance,** the younger man urged.
 
**He gave our daughter mono,** the unhappy older father argued.
 
**Actually, Jack, that is not a foregone conclusion,** Daniel
noted. **She could have shared a glass with someone, and for that
matter, we never even inquired as to if anybody she knew has had
mono. We just assumed she got it from kissing Peter. Maybe,
uh, we should ask Peter about his health.**

**Why are you defending him, Danny?**

**I am *not* defending him, Jack. I&apos;m keeping an open mind, and you stop condemning him, at least until we are certain he deserves it,** Daniel warned.

**I am certain,** Jack proclaimed.

**Oh, so, please don&apos;t confuse you with the facts because you&apos;ve
already made up your mind,** Daniel angrily replied. **Is that
what you&apos;re saying?**

**Danny ...**

**Jack, would you like to sleep on the couch for, say, the next week?**
Daniel asked, wanting to end the non-verbal discussion.
 
**That&apos;s blackmail,** Jack mentally whined.
 
**Really?** Daniel asked innocently, but sharply.
 
Jack snorted at Daniel&apos;s feigned innocence and finally stepped forward
to shake Peter&apos;s hand.

Well ... Jennifer said nervously.

Well ... Daniel said, looking at the children. Jen, the brood.

Oh, I&apos;m sorry, Jennifer said, leading Peter into the living
room. Peter, this is ... she began as she introduced her suitor
to her siblings.

====

So? Jennifer asked her parents, bright-eyed, just moments after Peter
had left their home.

So ... what? Jack answered.

Dad! What did you think? Isn&apos;t he just so ... so ...

Oh, he&apos;s definitely so ... OUCH! Jack glared at his husband who
had just rendered a sharp jab in Jack&apos;s abdomen. What was that
for?

Jen, he seemed very nice, and he certainly conducted himself as a
gentlemen, Daniel stated, though he was exchanging warning glances
with Jack as he spoke.

So we can go out on a date? Jennifer&apos;s eyes darted back and
forth between her parents. Oh, please. You saw how nice he
was.

Jen, we&apos;ll talk about it, Daniel replied.

Okay, but he&apos;s asked me to go out Saturday night. Please say
&apos;yes&apos;. Friday&apos;s my last night of being grounded, Jennifer
sighed. Seeing her parents just staring at each other without
saying a word, she reluctantly stated, I&apos;ll be upstairs. I
promised Noa and Lulu I&apos;d read them a story, so I&apos;m going to change and
then go to their room. Excuse me.

As soon as Jennifer disappeared from their sight, Jack said, Daniel, I
don&apos;t want to hear it.

We can&apos;t keep her locked up, Daniel pointed out.

We&apos;ll talk about this later, when ears aren&apos;t burning, Jack said,
motioning towards the hallway where he knew Jennifer was trying to
listen in from the short stairwell that led to her room.

I need to call Yazid anyway, Daniel replied.

Jack nodded and noted, Tell him one month, Danny. We can&apos;t
afford to spend any longer on it than that.

Daniel smiled at his husband, saying, I&apos;m really proud of you, Babe.

Thanks, Love, Jack said, acknowledging the praise of his hard work in
learning the ropes for their archaeological company.

====

The herd settled for the night? Jack asked much later that night,
looking up from his spot on the roof deck.

Jack, they&apos;re our children, not cattle, Daniel countered.

Sometimes ...

Jack!

They&apos;re beautiful, Angel, Jack intoned with love.

Daniel sat down in front of Jack, took his hands in his, and requested,
Talk to me.

She&apos;s going to get hurt, the older man stated softly. Danny, I
want to tell her &apos;no&apos;, but I know what you&apos;re going to say, and I know
all about her arguments, and, in the end, I have no choice but to give
in.

You didn&apos;t like him, Daniel observed.

I&apos;ve seen a thousand characters just like him in my time. He&apos;s
slick. He waltzed in here to put on a show. He wanted to
impress Jen and pacify us. It was one long act, Jack stated.

He ...

Danny, from the moment he tried to look embarrassed when handing Jen
the flowers, and did you see those? the older man asked, changing his
train of thought. What&apos;s a boy doing bringing a teenage girl red
roses, and not just red roses, but pristine red roses.

I noticed that, Daniel admitted. But we know he&apos;s well off,
he noted, trying to give Peter the benefit of the doubt.

That boy is Eddie Haskell -- one smarmy, ingratiating little punk.
&apos;My, what a lovely home you have, Doctor and General Jackson-O&apos;Neill&apos;,
Jack said, mocking the young man&apos;s conversation. &apos;And what a
lovely family, too. Jennifer&apos;s told me how you adopted a total of
six children and still volunteer at the shelters&apos;, Jack said,
grimacing. He was so slick that I&apos;m surprised he could walk
without falling with all that oil dripping down his body.

I know, Daniel sighed, squeezing Jack&apos;s hands softly. Peter
did everything right, too right.

He wasn&apos;t real, Jack insisted. He was a phony ...

She&apos;s sixteen, Babe, and, if we keep this tight of a rein on Jen, I&apos;m
afraid we might lose her, the younger man confided as he interrupted
his lover&apos;s ranting.

~We shouldn&apos;t have let her have a sixteenth birthday,~ Jack thought,
referring to their daughter&apos;s May birthday. Verbally, he sighed a
reluctant, Yeah.

So when her grounding restriction is over, we let her go out with
him, Daniel spoke softly.

And we let her be hurt, Jack choked out.

It&apos;s part of life.

Jack stared at Daniel and shook his head, insisting, You don&apos;t like
this any more than I do.

No, I don&apos;t, the younger man firmly replied, his eyes dull from the
aching of his heart.

C&apos;mere, Danny, Jack requested, pulling his lover to him.

Neither spoke anymore for quite a while. Dinner had been a
smashing success, only their guts, intuition, and experience were
telling the two men that trouble was definitely on the horizon.

====

Bean Sprout, there are several types of walnuts, David explained as
he lectured Bean Sprout through the communication system. There&apos;s the English walnut, also called the Persian walnut. They&apos;re native to Asia and Europe. That&apos;s what we usually
eat. It&apos;s easy. We just crack the shell and then remove the
nut kernel. Hmm, love these. The most valuable type,
though, is the Eastern Black Walnut because they use it for wood. It&apos;s considered the best quality hardwood for furniture. Personally, I&apos;d rather eat a walnut than sit on one, he chuckled.

Don&apos;t forget to tell Bean Sprout the technical specs, David, Jack
teased as he walked by the living room headed for the kitchen.

David continued, Okay, Dad thinks you should know the scientific
jargon, so walnuts are part of the small Juglandaceae family,
containing roughly sixty species, twenty-one of which are placed in the
genus Juglans. The name
&apos;walnut&apos; comes from a French term. Actually, it&apos;s one of those
messed up things, but walnut comes from &apos;gaul nut&apos;. Okay, the
genus is divided into four sections -- the Juglans ...

As he entered the dining area, Jack thought, ~Whoa, not that
technical!~ He chuckled softly, ~I definitely need to watch what
I say to David.~ Jack suddenly frowned, turning his head back
towards the living room as he asked out loud, A Juglan?

====

Daniel, you and the general have made the right choice, Sam stated
that afternoon, leaning forward against her worktable in her lab at the
SGC. Jen isn&apos;t a little girl anymore, and falling in love and
being hurt is just part of getting older. She shrugged in
amazement at her own words, feeling a little bit like a
hypocrite. Man, listen to me. I got hurt and ran for
years.

It&apos;s hard, Sam, Daniel responded, standing against a shelf with his
hands in his pockets.

Sam cocked her head back and forth and supposed, Maybe Peter will
surprise you. You said he was nice.

Too nice. Gawd, I sound like Jack, Daniel lamented.

Daniel, Jennifer&apos;s smart. Trust her, Sam advised, tapping her
pencil against the table.

Thanks, Sam, Daniel acknowledged before returning to his duties at
the SGC.

====

Sara, I know she&apos;s sixteen, but that doesn&apos;t mean she knows
everything. Truth is, Jack said, leaning forward on the balls of
his feet, she doesn&apos;t know anything.

It was early afternoon, and Jack was picking up Chenoa and Lulu from the Wilson home. He took the opportunity to solicit his ex-wife&apos;s opinion about Jennifer and Peter Hamilton.

Jack, Sara responded, smiling as she crossed her living room to stand
closer to her ex-husband. She&apos;s a young woman.

She&apos;s a child, Jack practically whined.

Jack, Sara gently reprimanded, putting her hand on Jack&apos;s right
cheek. Let her grow up. What&apos;s important isn&apos;t whether
Peter turns out to be genuine or not, but that when Peter, or the next
boy, or the next one after that, or maybe the one after ...

I get the idea, Jack replied brusquely.

What *is* important, Sara continued with a smile, is that when she
does get hurt, you and Daniel are there for her; and Jack, when it
happens, do *not* tell her &apos;I told you so&apos; and do *not* yell at her for
making a bad choice. If you do, you&apos;ll push Jennifer away, and
you&apos;ll regret it for the rest of your life.

Jack sighed and moved away, walking to the patio doors and looking out
at Chenoa and Lulu, who had spent the morning playing with Angela.

Jack, you want Jennifer to trust you, to know that she can come to
you, Sara intuitively surmised. I realize it&apos;s difficult to
stand by and watch her get hurt, but it is her life, and the sooner you
realize that fact and acknowledge that she has a right to live it in
her own way, the easier it will be.

Sara, I want to knock that kid seven ways from Sunday. He&apos;s
messing with her head, Jack spoke agitatedly as he watched the three
girls playing tag.

You don&apos;t know that for sure, Sara reminded Jack gently.

He&apos;s smooth, Sara. Jack turned around to face the blonde. Remember Brian Holmes?

How could I forget, Sara mused with a chuckle. Seeing Jack&apos;s
glare, she looked down and smiled nervously. Jack, I only went
out with him once.

And that was one time too many, if you recall, Jack lightly
barked. Two minutes later and ...

Suddenly, Sara laughed, and her eyes brightened.

What? Jack asked sharply.

Oh, Jack. All these years later, and you&apos;re actually jealous of
someone who meant absolutely nothing to me. Tell me, how does
Daniel survive? the blonde inquired brightly.

Jack sighed, I was never jealous.

Of course not. Sara chuckled. You know, you never really
were. As strange as it sounds, I think you&apos;re more jealous now
than you were then.

I *was* jealous; I just didn&apos;t want you to know, Jack admitted as he
sat down on the sofa.

Oh, Sara responded softly. That old military bravado thing,
she assumed, sitting down next to Jack.

Sara, I knew you wouldn&apos;t fall for that jerk. He was plastic,
and you were always better than those jocks and all-for-show
types. You were trying to make me jealous, and you know it, the
general accused.

Sara laughed as she confirmed, I needed to do something to get your
attention, Jack O&apos;Neill. You were taking me for granted.

I hadn&apos;t looked at another woman, Sara, the man seriously told the
woman.

Oh, and what about that jet plane you were so proud of? Sara
challenged.

Jack leaned back, smiling at Sara, who leaned back, too.

With a girlish smirk, the blonde questioned, It worked, didn&apos;t it?

I asked you to marry me, didn&apos;t I? Jack chuckled, happy that she&apos;d hatched the plan all those years ago. Sara, this isn&apos;t Jen playing a game. You knew what you were doing; she doesn&apos;t, but I swear to you, that Hamilton kid is a mirror of Brian Holmes.

Then just be there for her, and, Jack, if the time comes, and you need
a woman&apos;s touch, feel free to call me.

Jack leaned over and placed a chaste kiss on Sara&apos;s lips.

Thanks, Sara. Right now, I think I&apos;d better collect the girls
and head on home. Danny&apos;s promised me a surprise, Jack informed
his one-time love.

Oh, dare I ask? Sara said with twinkling eyes.

Jack grinned mischievously, sufficiently answering his ex-wife&apos;s
question, and moved to call his daughters from their playtime outside.

====

Boys, trust me on this one, Janet told Jack and Daniel at lunch the following Tuesday.

The group was at McDonald&apos;s with the Munchkins and the Spitfires. The older members of the brood were elsewhere for a few hours. At
the moment, the five youngest J-O kids were playing in the indoor
playroom at the fast food restaurant.

But, Doc ... Jack began.

Jack, Janet interrupted. I have experience in this area -- my
daughter, remember?

Jack smiled, and Daniel exclaimed, Gawd, she&apos;s married and with child.

Yes, and ask Sam, if you want, but neither of us were thrilled when we
found out she and Dom had been kissing.

That rite of passage thing, Jack recalled quietly.

That was their first kiss; of course, they wanted sparks to fly, but
not blow things up, Janet chuckled. Look, Cassie and Dom have
more or less been together since that time, but they&apos;ve had their ups
and downs. I think they both looked around a little, but, the
truth is, that rebellious age is the one Jen&apos;s at now. There were
times I wanted to pull my hair out, but you know, I was pretty lucky,
and you two are with Jen as well. Make the rules, and as long as
she abides by them, let her go.

I knew raising children wouldn&apos;t be easy, Daniel commented. It&apos;s just ... we don&apos;t have experience with this.

No one ever does, Daniel. There isn&apos;t a handbook on raising children, you know, Janet smirked lightly.

Are you sure, Doc? I recall Daniel spending an entire paycheck
on books and magazines before the Munchkins were born and ...

Jack, don&apos;t go there, Daniel mildly warned, earning tiny laughs from
both Jack and Janet.

Anyway, trust your instincts, the petite woman advised. The
hard part will be when Jen does what Cassie did, the redhead declared.

What&apos;s that? both men asked their friend.

When she decides to test you by testing the rules, Janet answered,
adding assertively, and it will happen. Punish her when she does
go outside the line, but as long as she abides by the rules you set
down for her, you have to let her make some decisions on her own. Besides, you can&apos;t stop her from being hurt, which is what you&apos;re both
so worried about. What you want is for Jen to come home, to you,
when that hurt does happen. You want her to know that if she&apos;s
made a mistake, home is a safe place and not a battle zone.

Remembering his conversation a few days earlier with Sara, Jack sighed,
No &apos;I told you sos&apos;.

Exactly, Janet confirmed and then checked her watch. Guys, I
have to get over to the hospital and make my rounds, but, smile. It&apos;ll be okay. Jen will be okay. She&apos;ll have a few bumps
and bruises along the way, but when it&apos;s all said and done, she&apos;ll be
fine. After all she has the two of you for parents.

Thanks, Doc, Jack said.

Janet ...

Daniel, when she needs a female ear, call me, Janet advised and then
waved good-bye to the children as she exited the restaurant.

He brought her daisies the day after the dinner, Jack grumbled, quickly pointing out, Not ones picked in a field, but from the florist, in perfect eye-catching condition.

And he escorted her to the college prep seminar yesterday that we
allowed her to go to with him, Daniel noted.

Their *date*, Jack said, practically coughing the word that Jennifer
liked to use about their trip to the college, went okay.

Daniel chuckled, Jen was on Cloud 9, Babe. He was the perfect
gentlemen, according to her. Maybe we&apos;re wrong.

Jack stood, pulled out his keys, and responded, No, Danny, we&apos;re not
wrong. He&apos;s playing a game, just waiting for the perfect time to
make his move.

I wish you were wrong, Daniel sighed, taking a final sip from his
coffee cup.

So do I.

====

Daniel was sitting in the gazebo with David, Little Danny, and Aislinn
across from him.

We&apos;ll start with a few basic phrases, Daniel said. He paused,
asking, Are you three sure you want to tackle another language?

All three nodded, eager to learn more. Jack and Daniel had
wondered if they were pushing the children too much as far as learning
so many different languages went, but most of the children were eager
to learn. These three had gotten together and approached Daniel
about learning Swedish. They would then help to teach their
siblings informally.

Let&apos;s not worry about inflection or tone today. I&apos;d rather you
concentrate on the phrases themselves. Tomorrow, we&apos;ll repeat
these same exercises, but we&apos;ll focus more on the proper accent and
method of speech. Here&apos;s the first one, Daniel stated, looking
down at the worksheet he&apos;d prepared for the children. Vad r klockan? he asked.

Vad r klockan? the three children repeated.

Which means? Daniel prodded.

David answered, What time is it?

Daniel checked his watch, replying, Klockan r tio.

Ten o&apos;clock, Aislinn clarified, seeing Daniel&apos;s unspoken question.

Very good, Daniel praised. Okay, next up is ...

The foursome continued their foreign language studies for the next
half-hour before adjourning for playtime.

====

Jennifer&apos;s big night had come. It was the very first weekend
following her month of being grounded, and she was being allowed to go
on her first official date with Peter Hamilton. As a precaution,
Jack and Daniel had also given her back her cell phone, with strict
orders that it was to be used to call one number only -- theirs, if
necessary.

I&apos;m so excited. How do I look, Bri? Jennifer asked eagerly.

Awesome, Jen, Brianna said as she tossed the baseball into her
mitt. She was dressed in her usual tomboy attire as she sat on
the corner of Jennifer&apos;s bed, watching her sister primp in preparation
for her first official date with Peter Hamilton. ~She looks
great, but I&apos;m never going to spend three hours getting ready for a
date. Goodness!~

Jennifer was wearing a very sophisticated red dress. She had
spent hours shopping for something that would pass Jack&apos;s inspection
and still impress Peter. It was rather form fitting, had a
low-cut back, and a high cut bodice front suspended from a strip of
fabric around the neck, like a collar. Lantern sleeves extended
over the upper back with criss-cross tubes of fabric and ended in cuffs
at the wrist.

Jack had exploded when Jennifer presented the dress for &apos;inspection&apos;.

 //Flashback//
It&apos;s too short! Jack bellowed.

It is not! Jennifer argued, looking down at her dress. It&apos;s
exactly three inches above my knee, precisely the same length as the
dresses and skirts I wear to school every day.

It shows too much! Jack argued. ~School dress code isn&apos;t strict
enough anyway.~

Like what? I am not showing one tiny bit of cleavage or my belly
button. I have blouses that show more than this dress, Jennifer
insisted as she held the dress in front of her.

What are those strappy things? Didn&apos;t they have enough fabric to
make solid sleeves?

It&apos;s called a lantern sleeve, Dad. It&apos;s a legitimate style,
Jennifer explained.

**Only if you want to look like fifty bucks an hour,** Jack
communicated.

**Jack, stop it,** Daniel warned via their non-verbal
communication. **Jen&apos;s right. There is nothing wrong with
her dress.**

**It&apos;s a chair dress, Danny,** Jack observed.

**What?**

**It&apos;ll make every man in the room want to see it across the back of a
chair!** the older man clarified.

**Jack, you can&apos;t expect her to wear a floor length flannel night gown
on a date.**

Jack silently replied, **I wish they made a male chastity belt. Hey! There&apos;s an idea; we could market it to doting fathers of
dating daughters.**

**What would you call it -- &apos;the meat locker&apos;? Jack, get a
grip!** Daniel advised his agitated lover.

**I intend to, on my shotgun,** Jack sarcastically intoned as their
non-verbal conversation continued.

**Jack, tell your daughter she is a lovely young woman. She
really made an excellent choice, Babe. Don&apos;t spoil this for
her,** the archaeologist warned, his eyes threatening his bear of a
soulmate.

**I want another inch on that dress,** Jack maintained.

Almost as if she had heard the words, Janet, who had gone shopping with
the teenager, suggested, How about this? Jen, let&apos;s let the hem
down one inch. Janet moved so her back was to Jack and
Daniel. She mouthed, Trust me.

Jennifer groaned her agreement.

**Jack, that&apos;s a good compromise. Jen&apos;s a good girl; we have to
trust her,** Daniel insisted.

Fine, Jack sighed, then smiled. It is a beautiful dress,
modest and still very attractive. Good choice. He crossed
the room, gave Jennifer a kiss, and said, Have a good time,
Sweetheart.
//End of Flashback//

 I hope Peter likes this, the sixteen year old said as she studied her
figure in the mirror.

It&apos;s a good thing Aunt Janet lowered the hem, or Dad wouldn&apos;t let you
out the door, Brianna chuckled, remembering Jack&apos;s look at first
seeing what he called the &apos;over-my-dead-body&apos; fitted evening dress.

Not going there tonight. I&apos;m thinking all good thoughts. Peter&apos;s taking me to dinner at some fancy restaurant, Jennifer happily
crooned.

Which one? Brianna asked, taking the ball out of her glove.

Shrugging as she primped in front of the mirror, Jennifer answered,
I&apos;m not sure.

Better get sure, Jen. Dad will ask, Brianna pointed out.

Peter will tell him when he gets here. I&apos;m not worried,
Jennifer spoke confidently.

====

Jack, no! Daniel argued forty minutes later as Jack prepared to walk
out the door.

Daniel, I feel it. Every bone in my body is telling me that he&apos;s
going to ... to ...

To what, Jack? Daniel interrupted.

Jack groaned and returned to the living room where David and Ricky were
and barked, Kids, upstairs -- now!

Uh-oh, David silently commented. Come on, Ricky. I&apos;ll
tell you about Waffle Rock.

Hey, Jack called out at his fleeing children. I&apos;m sorry. Dad&apos;s a little ...

Loopy! Ricky answered. Dad get loopy when Jen go out.

Go on, Jack said, trying to smile a little. When the children
were out of sight, Jack looked over at Daniel and spoke softly, I&apos;m
sorry, Angel. I didn&apos;t mean to shout at you anymore than I meant
to dismiss the kids like that.

I know, Daniel replied softly and then closed the gap between
them. Jack, I think we should wait a little while, and then we
should call the restaurant and make sure they are where they&apos;re
supposed to be. That&apos;s being responsible, but we&apos;re not going to
get into the car and follow them.

Jack nodded and headed outside to play with the beagles for a little
while and, Daniel knew, to simply collect his thoughts.

====

Jack and Daniel were snuggled together on the sofa, but it was a
tentative time. Both wore frowns on their faces. The
youngest of their children were asleep. Jeff, David, and Brianna
were in the game room.

The lovers had verified that Peter and Jennifer were at the restaurant
and having dinner. They also knew that afterwards the two were
supposed to go for a drive and possibly to a friend&apos;s house. It
was a bit vague, and the parents had agreed on the condition that
Jennifer phone in after an hour or so. The teenager had called
upon leaving the restaurant as scheduled, but now ninety minutes had
passed. Nervous anxiety filled the air.

Danny ...

Not yet, Daniel insisted, putting his hand over the phone Jack was
holding. We have to give her a bit of freedom to choose, Daniel
stated decisively. She knows the rules, and that we&apos;ll act if
she breaks them.

And what if something&apos;s happened? Jack asked.

We do what we agreed on. If Jen doesn&apos;t call us in two hours, we
call. That&apos;s what we said, Jack, the younger man reminded.

Fine, but ... Just then the phone rang. The lovers shared
an apprehensive look, and then Jack answered the phone. Hello,
he spoke calmly.

Dad, Jennifer spoke firmly. Would you or Daddy come and pick
me up, please?

Princess, are you okay? Jack asked as he stood up.

Yes, Dad, Jennifer replied, her voice trembling slightly. I&apos;m
at Peter&apos;s house, outside. Please come get me.

One of us will be right there, Jack spoke with a sense of urgency,
glad he and Daniel had insisted on having Peter&apos;s address and phone
number before letting Jennifer go out on the date.

Jennifer disconnected the call just as Daniel stood.

Jack?

She says she&apos;s fine. I knew that idiot ... Jack took a
giant breath and added, She&apos;s at that kid&apos;s house.

I&apos;m on my way, Daniel intoned, giving Jack a quick kiss and heading
for the door.

Jack walked around the room for a minute. When he heard the door
close, he stared at the photos on the mantel. The entire family
was there, including the family&apos;s surrogate moms. Jack looked at
his watch.

~Sara&apos;s probably up, but Mark&apos;s been out of town for a couple of days;
I don&apos;t want to interfere with that. Carter&apos;s the closest, but
they&apos;re newlyweds.~ Jack dialed the number he&apos;d decided on. ~We&apos;ll start with the Doc.~

Hello, Janet greeted, stifling a yawn.

Doc, doing anything important? Jack asked without saying &apos;hello&apos;.

What&apos;s going on? Janet listened to a few brief details and got
Jennifer&apos;s estimated time of arriving home. I&apos;ll be right there.

Not having time to dress, Janet threw on a robe, pulling it tight, and
then slipped on a pair of comfortable sandals. Within two
minutes, she was in her car and headed for the Jackson-O&apos;Neill
residence.

====

Daniel drove up the long driveway to the huge mansion in Broadmoor
Bluffs, one of the most exclusive parts of Colorado Springs.

~Wow. The Hamiltons sure aren&apos;t hungry for hamburger,~ Daniel
thought as he stopped the car in front of the huge entrance.

Jennifer was sitting on the front steps, her arms crossed in front of
her. Seeing Daniel in his sports car, she stood, adjusting her
sweater. When Daniel stopped, she walked to the car, like a queen
ascending to her throne. She glided in effortlessly, like a woman in
complete and utter control of herself and everything around her.

~Peter could be watching,~ the shattered young teen thought. ~I
won&apos;t give him the satisfaction of seeing me cry, or rushing to the
car, or thinking that he was anything more to me than a thousand other
boys who wanted to date me. I&apos;ll cry when I get home, and I&apos;m all
alone.~

For just a moment, Daniel stared at her, taking in every inch that he
could see of her and her dress. Then he drove away.

After a couple of minutes, Daniel quietly asked, Are you okay, Jen?

Jennifer nodded as she looked blankly out the window, eventually
answering, I&apos;m fine, Daddy. Hurting inside, but just wanting to
forget the night had ever happened, she added politely, Thank you for
coming to get me.

Thank you for calling, Daniel softly replied, grateful that their
daughter felt secure enough to trust them in this way.

The remainder of the ride home was done in silence.

====

~Breathe. I can&apos;t breathe.~ As Daniel turned off the car,
Jennifer quickly jumped out, running into the house. Without even
looking, she called out, I&apos;m fine, Dad. Please leave me alone.

Jen! Jack called out as he sprinted to the hallway, only to be
stopped by his lover.

She&apos;s fine, Daniel promised.

Did he touch her? Jack asked, ready to find the brute of a boyfriend
and teach him a lesson if necessary. ~Then I&apos;ll let T have a go,
then Lou ...~

I don&apos;t know, but she&apos;s not hurt, Daniel noted. Her dress is
intact; her hair was messy, but that&apos;s all. Let&apos;s give her a few
minutes, okay?

~I don&apos;t want to, but ...~ Jack thought as he nodded and then
told Daniel that he had sent Jeff, Brianna, and David to their rooms
for the night.

Babe, is that Janet&apos;s car in the driveway? Daniel inquired, having
noticed the car parked behind Jack&apos;s truck when he and Jennifer had
returned.

She&apos;s ... Jack stopped his words as Jennifer suddenly flew by
the couple, going up the stairs. Bird&apos;s Nest?

Bird&apos;s Nest, Daniel echoed in agreement. Janet?

She said that&apos;s where Jen would go. Looks like she was right,
Jack observed.

Jack nodded towards the sofa, so the two worried fathers sat down,
quickly joined by two equally worried beagles.

====

Jennifer hurried up the stairs to the special place that was only for
the female members of the Jackson-O&apos;Neill family. Now wearing her
purple sweats, she stopped, letting out a gasp when she saw Janet
seated on the bench.

Janet was still wearing her own pajamas, the robe a little looser
around her now. In front of her was a tray with hot chocolate,
some wafers, and a few chocolates.

Come sit down, Sweetie, Janet urged, patting the space next to her.

The teenager sat down, clenching the edge of the bench seat until
finally she began to sob.

Oh, Aunt Janet, Jennifer cried, tumbling over into Janet&apos;s warm and
understanding embrace. I feel so miserable.

It&apos;s okay, Jen. It&apos;s okay, the petite woman soothed, rubbing
Jennifer&apos;s back in support.

I thought he was special, Jennifer sniffled.

Not the prince he made himself out to be, huh? Janet prodded gently.

No, he&apos;s just a toad in prince&apos;s clothing, and to think that I kissed
him! Jennifer spat, pulling back a little and wiping her mouth with
the back of her hand.

You&apos;ll kiss a few toads before you find a true prince, the petite
physician sighed. Here, Honey. I brought a whole box of
tissues, Janet said, reaching for the box next to her and handing out
a few tissues to the upset teen. Now, first things first, are
you hurt?

No, he didn&apos;t hurt me, Jennifer assured, still crying.

Okay, Janet said. Let&apos;s have some hot chocolate.

Not ice cream? Jennifer tried to tease, though her heart wasn&apos;t
really in it.

Jen, your fathers may think ice cream is the answer to all of life&apos;s
troubles, but for a woman, there&apos;s only one thing, Janet stated.

Chocolate, both females stated, tiny chuckles escaping as they each
took a chocolate treat.

====

So, it was perfect -- the restaurant, the drive, just everything, but
then suddenly everything changed, Jennifer explained a while later.

Do you want to tell me about it? Janet coaxed gently.

Jennifer hesitated for only a moment before nodding her head and
saying, Yes. It was such a beautiful night for a drive. We
just talked, Aunt Janet. Then he said he wanted to show me
something.

Oh, boy, Janet reacted with a hesitant chuckle.

I thought he was going to show me ... I don&apos;t know what I thought,
but, boy, was I surprised when we ended up at his house. Aunt
Janet, his family is filthy rich, and they live in this ... this
palace; at least, it feels like a palace. Anyway ...

Jennifer told Janet how they&apos;d driven up to Peter&apos;s house, and the boy
claimed he wanted to give her the grand tour. His parents,
however, were nowhere to be found. The only person she saw was a
butler who had offered her a drink.

A drink, Aunt Janet. I mean he was holding up liquor
bottles. I don&apos;t understand it. His parents let him do
that? the girl asked in disbelief.

I don&apos;t know, Sweetie, Janet answered. Maybe he has a deal
with the butler.

Jennifer had refused the drink, but accepted the invitation to go on
the grand tour. The rooms were beautiful, many full of priceless
antiques and luxury items.

And this is my room, Peter had told Jennifer of the large, well-kept
room.

It&apos;s very nice. Maybe we should go back downstairs now,
Jennifer had suggested, feeling it was a bit inappropriate for the two
of them to be alone there.

It hadn&apos;t worked. Peter took her hand and sat her down on the
bed. He proceeded to make advances on her, which Jennifer tried
to laugh off, unwilling to believe the worst.

I thought he knew I wasn&apos;t like that, Aunt Janet. I kept telling
him &apos;no&apos;, but he kept pawing me. I told him &apos;no&apos; so many times, I
began to feel like it was a recording. He&apos;d leave me alone for a
minute, and I&apos;d think everything was okay, but then his hands would ...
I&apos;m not ready for that, Aunt Janet. I don&apos;t want to get pregnant
at sixteen. When I make love for the first time, I want it to be
real. Maybe it won&apos;t be with the person I marry, but I want to
know it&apos;s more than a fling or hormones, Jennifer confided, beginning
to cry again.

That&apos;s a smart choice, Jen, Janet affirmed as she held the teenager&apos;s
hand.

Jennifer sniffled and took a bite of a Godiva chocolate for comfort
before saying, He got angry, started talking about how much he&apos;d
invested in me. Gawd, I&apos;m not a stock portfolio.

Janet let out a snort as she replied, To some men, women are nothing
but property.

I won&apos;t let a man treat me like that, Jennifer stated decisively.

Is that what you told Peter? Janet inquired.

Jennifer let out a snort as she recalled the nightmarish experience.

 //Flashback//
Peter, stop! I told you &apos;NO&apos;! Jennifer ordered in a raised
voice.

Come on, Jen. You know you want me. I&apos;ll show you a good
time. You don&apos;t want to be a virgin forever, do you? Peter asked
as he attempted to move his hands up Jennifer&apos;s dress. Come on
... Jen ... he spoke enticingly, moving to kiss her.

As Peter&apos;s lips brushed Jennifer&apos;s, he slid one hand up her
thigh. Jennifer stood up and darted away, turning away from
Peter. Though her heart was aching, she was determined not to cry.

I thought you understood, the teenage girl stated, regret in her
voice and sadness in her eyes.

Peter walked up behind her and put his arms around her, his hands
roaming, starting at her waist and working their way up. As Peter
attempted to squeeze her breasts, Jennifer&apos;s breathing hitched.

That&apos;s it! Jennifer stated firmly, having had enough of trying to
excuse Peter&apos;s actions.

Jennifer used a move that Teal&apos;c had taught her. The
well-executed jab, kick, and push landed Peter on the other side of the
room, sitting on the floor and shaking his head.

If you don&apos;t lay off me, you won&apos;t ever have to worry about using your
wedding tackle again because my two dads will have it stuffed and
mounted on the wall. I&apos;m going home now, Jennifer declared,
grabbing her sweater and handbag and walking out.

Two minutes later, as she stood on the large front porch, Peter came
outside and requested, Jen, let me drive you home.

Making sure there was plenty of distance between her and Peter,
Jennifer responded, Do you think I&apos;m stupid? I&apos;m not getting in
a car alone with you! My father is picking me up, and if I were
you, I wouldn&apos;t be out here to face him when he arrives.
//End of Flashback//

 I didn&apos;t know who was coming to get me, but I figured it was safer for
him inside. Jennifer was leaning into Janet&apos;s hold as she
finished her story. I trusted him, Aunt Janet. It hurts so
much.

Janet brushed back Jennifer&apos;s long strands of hair that hung in front
of her face and said gently, I know, but the good news is, it won&apos;t
hurt for long.

Did anything like this ever happen to you? Jennifer asked, wondering
if Janet could possibly really understand.

Smiling with wisdom, the physician answered, Oh, yes, and more than
once.

Would you tell me? Jennifer asked quietly.

Janet smiled, nodded, and proceeded to tell Jennifer a couple of her
own experiences as a teen in love.

====

Trust me, Jack, the archaeologist requested. Check on the
children. I&apos;ll meet you in our bedroom in a little bit.

Danny ...

Love, please trust me on this, Daniel pleaded.

Reluctantly, Jack nodded and moved to do the nightly check on their
brood.

Meanwhile, Daniel went to the kitchen and took out the final
ingredients to his special surprise. Like Jack, he&apos;d had a hunch
that tonight would be the night their daughter&apos;s heart would be
broken. If not, it would have made a great dessert for two over
the weekend.

A few minutes later, Daniel quietly climbed the steps to the Bird&apos;s
Nest and said, Knock, knock.

Daddy! Jennifer said, a tiny smile on her face.

I&apos;ll turn around and leave if ...

No, Daddy, please don&apos;t, Jennifer said, standing up and walking to
her father. She gave him a kiss on the cheek and, seeing the tray
he carried, asked, What&apos;s that?

Heaven in your mouth, Daniel replied.

What? the teenager quizzed.

Daniel, Tiramisu? Janet asked hopefully.

Yes, Daniel confirmed.

Having served a portion to each of them, Daniel urged his daughter to
take a bite.

Oooooooh, mmmmmm, gawd! Jennifer exclaimed. Oh, that&apos;s ...

Heavenly, all three said at the same time.

Daniel stayed for a few minutes before excusing himself, but as he
started to go down the stairs, Jennifer called out and ran after
him. Throwing her arms around him, the teen said, Thank you for
loving me and trusting me. I don&apos;t know how you&apos;ve kept Dad under
control, but thank you so much, Daddy.

Daniel embraced her, pulling her close and rubbing her back in soothing
circles as he quietly replied, You&apos;re welcome. If you need us
...

Daddy, I always need you and Dad, Jennifer promised with a smile.

Goodnight, Princess, Daniel said, smiling as he backed away.

====

The next morning Jack was preparing breakfast when Jennifer walked into
the kitchen.

Morning, Jen, Jack spoke as nonchalantly as he could.

Good morning, Dad, Jennifer said, adding, and thank you.

You&apos;re welcome, Jack responded softly, keeping one covert eye on the
teenager. Two minutes passed before he lightly interrogated,
Jen, just one thing. Do I need to kill him?

Jennifer actually chuckled as she turned to face her dad and answered,
No, Dad, you don&apos;t. You&apos;ve taught me well. You don&apos;t need
the shotgun.

You sure? Jack quizzed.

He had roaming hands, but he&apos;s the one who ended up on his six as I
walked out the door. Okay? Jennifer asked, hoping her father
would let it go for now.

Okay, Sweetheart, Jack spoke with a calming expression on his
face. ~I&apos;ll slip out later and break his neck.~

I love you, Dad, Jennifer said as she whisked by him, giving Jack a
kiss on the cheek as she did so.

Jack smiled as he replied, I love you, too, Jen.

A minute later, Daniel entered the kitchen smiling as he announced,
Toto grew another half-an-inch, Babe.

Yeah? Jack queries, beaming, his joy overtaking his murderous
thoughts for the moment..

Yeah! We need to, uh, you know today ... Daniel shyly reminded.

And after we you know, maybe we can really you know, Jack smirked
seductively.

I&apos;d like that. Daniel looked over his shoulder towards the
living room. She&apos;ll be okay.

Yeah, she will, Jack agreed. I talked to the Doc earlier this
morning on the phone. She promised me Jen wasn&apos;t hurt,
physically. I tell ya, Danny, that kid had better steer clear of
our daughter, if he knows what&apos;s good for him.

Daniel nodded, then said, We don&apos;t know his story, Jack.

Daniel ...

Jack, he didn&apos;t hurt her. From the tiny bit Jen said last night,
once he finally got the message, he backed off. It could have
been worse, Daniel stated. ~Though if it had, I would have
broken his neck,~ he thought, allowing his own fatherly protectiveness
to temporarily gain control of his mind.

Jen made some smart choices last night, too, Jack admitted.

She&apos;s earned our trust and our respect. Jack, she&apos;ll tell us
what happened in a few days; she just needs us to give her some space
right now, Daniel remarked.

I know. Half-an-inch, you said? Jack asked, smiling.

Wanna come see? Daniel asked, grinning.

I love you, Angel!

I love you, too, my Silver Fox! the younger man replied as he took
Jack by the hand and led him up to the den to visit with their unborn
child.

====

Bri, watch the twins, Jeff advised that afternoon as he climbed out
of the swimming pool. They&apos;ve been talking about diving into the
deep end.

Not without Dad and Daddy here, Brianna astutely replied, referring
to their parents who were at the offices of J-O Enterprises for a
couple of hours.

I&apos;ll be back in a few minutes, Jeff told the tomboy. I just
want to change and get my history book.

Okay, Jeff, Brianna acknowledged, getting up out of the chaise
lounge. I think I&apos;ll play it safe and distract them, she mused
about the dive-happy twins.

Probably a good idea, Jeff chuckled as he walked away.

====

Having changed and collected the book in question, Jeff was heading
back towards the pool when the tiny beep went off, indicating someone
was at the front door. He checked the security system and saw it
was a delivery person.

Yes, who is it? the teenage boy asked over the intercom.

Delivery from Bette&apos;s, the female announced.

I need your name please, Jeff requested as he opened the phone book,
quickly turning to the yellow pages.

Eileen. Hey, I&apos;m in a hurry, the college-aged girl called out.

One minute, please, Jeff replied. He picked up the phone and
dialed the phone number of Bette&apos;s. When a woman answered, he
said, Yes, this is the Jackson-O&apos;Neill residence. I need to
verify that you sent a driver to our home with a package.

Uh, let me see ... yes, we did -- a five-pound box of chocolates for
Jennifer Jackson-O&apos;Neill, the woman said as she stared at her computer
screen.

And the name of the driver and her description, please, Jeff asked.

Eileen, short shoulder-length hair, brown eyes, and she&apos;s wearing a
green shirt with our logo on it, the woman elucidated.

Thank you very much, Jeff said, hanging up and moving to the
door. As he did so, he called out, Jen, it&apos;s for you!

What did you do? Take a trip? Eileen laughed as she handed over
the box. Someone has an admirer, the girl said.

Not me, it&apos;s ...

What is it, Jeff? Jennifer asked.

Looks like delectable calories time, Jeff chuckled, handing his
sister the box.

Wow, that&apos;s a big box, Jennifer observed as she stared at it,
noticing the card that was affixed to the center.

They&apos;re our best chocolates. Sign here, please, Eileen
requested, holding out an electronic clipboard.

Dad and Daddy maybe? Jennifer asked, pulling out the card.

Jeff began to sign, when Jennifer pulled on his arm, saying, Jeff,
don&apos;t.

Why? the boy asked.

With a serious expression, Jennifer said, I don&apos;t want these.

You&apos;re kidding? Eileen asked in shock.

Take them back, please, Jennifer said. Jeff ...

Okay, Sis, Jeff said. He shrugged and spoke, I&apos;m sorry,
before closing the door. He trailed after his sister,
concerned. Jen, who were they from?

Jennifer turned around and answered, A pretender. She sighed,
He couldn&apos;t even say he was sorry, Jeff. The card just said,
&apos;Sweets for the sweet, and you&apos;re mine.

Peter Hamilton? Jeff asked, upset at what he was hearing.

Gawd, Jennifer sighed as she turned around. Oh, Jeff, don&apos;t
tell Dad or Daddy I said that.

I won&apos;t. Jen, are you okay? I need to get back to the
twins at the pool, but ...

I&apos;m fine, Jennifer promised with a hesitant smile. She took a breath, saying, I think I&apos;m going to go listen to Beyonce or something.

~Or something?~ Jeff mused.

Oh, wait, I can&apos;t. I forgot, Jennifer sighed about her loss of music-listening privileges which still had one more week to go. I guess I&apos;ll go read a book, she said with a shrug as she headed upstairs, desperate to forget about the fiend named Peter Hamilton.

====

I&apos;ve got you now, Babe, Daniel chuckled as he played a meld of three
five-cards onto the game table in the rec room a couple of days later.

Nearby, David was working on homework, Ricky was playing with his
deluxe Etch-a-Sketch, Brianna was watching a classic hockey game replay
during which her hero, Wayne Gretzky, had been amazingly superb, and
Jenny was going back and forth, watching Jack and Daniel as they played
gin.

Think again, Dannyboy, Jack quipped as he displayed his own meld, a
higher value set of four aces.

Ouch! Daniel winced as play continued.

Jenny looked at her daddy&apos;s hand and then at her daddy, scrunching her
nose for a minute. She ran over and studied Jack&apos;s hand
again. Shrugging, she returned to Daniel&apos;s side.

====

Gin! Jack laughed. Gotcha again, Love, he said jovially.

You sure did, Jack, Daniel admitted. You are the king of gin!
he declared a couple of minutes later after doing the final tally,
giving Jack the victory for their game playing on this night.

Just fetch me my throne, Jack teased as he stood up. Ice
cream? he called out to those assembled.

Yes! came the rousing answers.

As Jack headed for the hospitality room, Daniel gathered up their
cards. As he did so, he noticed their redheaded daughter staring
at him suspiciously.

Jenny, is something wrong? Daniel asked.

Why did you let Dad win? Jenny asked, completely surprising the
archaeologist.

Daniel looked back nervously at his husband and then brought his
fingers to his lips in a shushing motion.

Daddy, you threw &apos;way good cards, Jenny chastised.

Did I? the man answered weakly.

Jenny noted, You always do. I think you let Dad win.

Shhh, Daniel whispered. Leaning forward, he said, Jenny, it&apos;s
our secret, but Dad always wins at gin.

Why, Daddy? You had best hands, Jenny insisted.

Well, I didn&apos;t know that ... for sure, Daniel responded slyly. I wasn&apos;t thinking about the cards. That&apos;s my fault.

Why, Daddy? the little girl quizzed quietly.

I was distracted. When Dad and I play gin, I&apos;m always
distracted, Daniel explained.

No understand, Jenny said, shaking her head.

When Dad and I play gin, I think about your dad, and how much I love
him and how happy we are. I think about how handsome he is, how
his smile makes me light up inside. I remember times we&apos;ve spent
together; things he&apos;s done to make me laugh. I think about ...
Daniel continued.

Why no think about cards? Jenny asked pointedly.

Because Dad always wins at gin, Daniel stated simply. Always,
Jenny. It&apos;s just something that doesn&apos;t make sense.

He doesn&apos;t win at chess, Jenny pointed out.

No, I ... I don&apos;t get distracted when we play chess, Daniel told her.

Jenny considered their discussion and then took a big breath, saying,
Oh, you let Dad win gin &apos;cause you win chess all time.

Daniel anxiously shushed her again, but Jenny rambled on, having just
made a huge discovery.

I know, Daddy! You &apos;tracted me yesterday, Jenny accused.

The archaeologist smiled weakly, remembering how he had brought in
Jenny&apos;s favorite DVD for viewing, telling her they could watch it when
she and Jack had finished the game. The excitement disrupted her
attention just enough so that Jack won the game.

Jenny ...

Jenny giggled, Dad always win gin!

Smiling, Daniel nodded and said, Yes.

Not cheating?

Only if you&apos;re paying attention and do it on purpose, Daniel informed
her.

Jenny grinned, saying, When play Dad at gin, I think &apos;bout ice cream
or Donald Duck or Dad getting in trouble or ...

That&apos;s my girl, Daniel encouraged.

Laughing, Jenny added, Not be &apos;tracted when we play, Daddy, &apos;kay?

Okay, Princess, Daniel said.

Ice cream&apos;s ready! Jack announced, walking in with a tray to the
delight of everyone and not noticing the wink Daniel gave their
youngest daughter.

Moments later, as he began to take his first bite of his orange
sherbet, Daniel stopped, his spoon halfway in his mouth. He
blinked several times and looked over at Jenny, who was giggling with
Ricky about something as they enjoyed their ice cream.

Danny, you okay? Jack asked, recognizing the guppy look of shock on
his husband&apos;s face.

I&apos;m ... fine, Daniel answered.

You sure? Is the sherbet okay? a concerned Jack inquired.

It&apos;s great. I&apos;m, uh, just thinking, and you know me when I ...
think, Daniel stammered, relieved when Jack nodded and got distracted
by a question David asked him. Glancing over at Jenny, the
younger man thought, ~When did you learn how to play gin so well, and
how did you know I had the winning cards, and how do you know that I
always let Jack win?~

Danny, your sherbet is on your shirt, Jack pointed out.

Looking down, Daniel smiled nervously and gave his lover a shrug,
saying, I guess I got a little distracted.

By what? Jack asked.

Our children, Babe, our very surprising children, Daniel answered
with a smile before digging into his orange sherbet.

====

The next day, as Jack was working on his truck, a florist drove
up. He wiped his hands and smiled, figuring they were from his
lover.

~Well, it was just a thought,~ Jack silently groaned when told they
were for his daughter. As he signed for them, he called out,
JENNIFER, FRONT AND CENTER!

You&apos;re, uh, loud, Sir, the delivery man unnecessarily pointed out.

But I get a fast response, Jack smirked.

Dad? the teenager called out as she hurried toward her father.

See! Jack said quietly to the driver. Flowers! he exclaimed
to his daughter about the huge flower arrangement that included dozens
of red roses and orchids.

That&apos;s an understatement, Jennifer responded without a smile. Did you buy them for me?

No, Jack answered and then realizing from her expression that his
daughter wasn&apos;t thrilled about the flowers.

Dad, read the card, please, the girl asked.

Jack pulled out the card and read aloud, For the prettiest girl in
Colorado Springs or the world. He sighed, They&apos;re from
Hamilton.

Send them back, Jennifer instructed harshly. He has a lot of
nerve sending me things all the time without even apologizing. I
don&apos;t want them, she spoke, turning around and running into the
backyard.

Jack sighed, Sorry. Here&apos;s something for your time, as he took
out a five dollar bill and handed it to the driver.

If my wife got these, she&apos;d be in seventh heaven, the man said as he
headed back to the truck.

Since they&apos;re already paid for, give them to your wife, Jack
intoned. Tell Mister Hamilton I said it was okay.

Unsure of the motivation, but deciding not to look a gift horse in the
mouth, the man nodded and smiled before getting back into his delivery
truck and leaving.

~Good thing your wife isn&apos;t my daughter or those flowers would be in
the trash faster than you can say &apos;dirtbag&apos;; Hamilton, you have no
class,~ Jack thought as he returned to his truck.

====

The entire family was sitting in the living room waiting for Little
Danny to come down from his room with his &apos;surprise&apos; for the family.

**Should we be worried here, Danny?**

**Yes.**

**Daniel! You&apos;re supposed to say no and reassure me,** Jack
bemoaned with their special communication.

**Sorry, I&apos;m all out of reassurance,** a clueless Daniel replied.

At that moment, Little Danny came into the room lugging a large piece
of cardboard behind him. Bringing it around in front of him, he
grinned triumphantly and declared, According to my figures, Bean
Sprout will be a girl! We&apos;re having a sister!

The reviews were mixed, Jonny leading the groans while Aislinn led the
cheers. Jack simply stared as Daniel did his patented guppy
imitation.

The young boy turned to the chart he&apos;d made which listed all the
members of the family. The boys&apos; names were written in orange,
and the girls&apos; names clashed nicely in bright purple.

See, first we got Ricky and Jenny, which means Bean Sprout could
equally be a boy or girl. Then we got us Munchkins, and since
Jonny and I are both boys that would make Bean Sprout more likely to be
a boy, Little Danny reasoned, pausing for a breath.

Happily, the child didn&apos;t notice the rather stunned and horrified look
on his parents faces as they realized that he actually understood quite
a bit about genetics.

Little Danny continued, Then I talked to Aunt Janet, and she &apos;greed
that Dad and Daddy probably have a gene that helps them decide whether
to pick a boy or girl. So, with this gene on their tadpoles ...

The inventive boy brought up another piece of cardboard that had a
drawing of a &apos;tadpole&apos; on it. Inside the rather large tadpole was
clearly printed &apos;Girl/Boy choosing gene&apos;.

Jack looked at his husband expectantly, and, sure enough, Daniel was
turning a nice shade of pink.

So with this gene, it changes everything, Little Danny
explained. Since Noa, Lulu, Bri, and Jen make four girls, and
David and Jeff only two boys, it means Dad and Daddy are more likely to
have girls. So, Bean Sprout should be a girl!

Happily, Little Danny stood back and waited for the family&apos;s
reactions. Jonny pouted and muttered something about being
outnumbered by girls already. However, then he saw Aislinn&apos;s face
and decided running would be a good idea. Aislinn, Ricky, and
Jenny took off in hot pursuit.

Meanwhile, Chenoa and Lulu were talking about how they&apos;d teach Bean
Sprout to dance while Jennifer, Jeff, and David grinned at the happy
Munchkin and congratulated him on his creative reasoning. Brianna
leaned forward, smiling in amazement at her little brother.

Uh, Little Danny, that was ... very ... interesting, Daniel finally
commented.

Very! Jack added. And, you say Aunt Janet helped? Seeing the boy&apos;s happy nod, he spoke, Remind me to thank her. ~A little advance warning would have been nice.~

Daniel stared at his lover, then returned his eyes to look at his son,
who was still waiting for their response.

Daddy, I worked long time on this, the little boy stated, a bit
disappointed at the response.

Daniel quickly stood and went to their son, kneeling down with a smile
on his face. He pulled the boy&apos;s sweater taut as he considered
his words.

Do you know what is really wonderful about birth? Daniel asked.

What?

Surprise. Science is a wonderful tool, Daniel proclaimed.

Wonderful, Jack added. Cream of the crop; can&apos;t do without it.

Rolling his eyes as he ignored his husband, Daniel continued, Science
is oftentimes our best guess, but it&apos;s never one-hundred percent.

Don&apos;t let Carter hear you say that, Jack quipped, earning laughter
from the four oldest children who understood what was being said.

Science told us that Mommy was only going to have one baby; that&apos;s
what Dad and I thought, but Doctor Sylvia and Mommy knew that she was
going to have twins, Daniel explained.

You talking about Ricky &apos;n&apos; Jenny? Little Danny asked.

No, I&apos;m talking about you, Jonny, and Ash, Daniel clarified.

Ash was a surprise, Little Danny stated confidently, now remembering
the story.

But science said she wasn&apos;t there. Little Danny, science is only
a guide, but it&apos;s not irrefutable; uh, I mean, it&apos;s not always right,
especially, uh, since there is an ... alien device involved, Daniel
elaborated.

Bean Sprout isn&apos;t a girl? Little Danny asked, his disappointment
evident.

Daniel shrugged, answering, I don&apos;t know, and that&apos;s wonderful,
because I want to be surprised. I want our miracle to be whoever
they are, boy or girl. Does it really matter to you?

Oh, no, Daddy. I just want a baby to play with, Little Danny
answered.

I&apos;m very proud of you for working so hard on this, but don&apos;t be sad if
Bean Sprout is a boy, okay?

I won&apos;t be, Daddy, Little Danny promised, after which he found
himself scooped up into his father&apos;s arms.

We love you, Daniel spoke, earning himself a huge smile from his
namesake.

Little Danny, this was the surprise you were working on? Brianna
asked a few minutes later as everyone went about their business.

The little boy nodded, saying, See, Bri, it was important to include
everyone, but I didn&apos;t know how to do it at first. I had to call
Aunt Janet about the genetics.

Oh, Brianna sighed.

I&apos;m sorry, Bri, the child stated. I didn&apos;t mean for you to
think the wrong thing.

It wasn&apos;t your fault, Brianna responded, smiling and squeezing her
brother&apos;s rosy cheeks. I just made an assump... oh.

Brianna looked around the room, a light dawning as she stood silently.

Bri? Little Danny asked.

Chuckling, the tomboy advised, Little Danny, assumptions are
definitely dangerous. I made a bad one, and *I* am the one who is
very sorry. I thought you were excluding me when all along you
were just trying to include me. Thank you, she softly intoned.

Love you, Bri! the small child exclaimed, wrapping his arms around
her.

Love you, too, you little squirt, Brianna replied jovially. Hey, let&apos;s go play air hockey. We can do that one handed!

Okay, Bri! Little Danny responded gaily, leading the way to the game
room.

~Geez, Bri, you did the same thing you accused Jennifer of doing last
month -- jumping to conclusions. Growing up sure is hard,~
Brianna thought as she followed her younger brother into the game room.

====

With just a couple of days left in July, Jennifer entered the study,
where she&apos;d been summoned to minutes earlier by her parents, leaving
the brood under the supervision of Jeff and Brianna. Seeing Jack
motion, she shut the door behind her and then took a seat in between
her parents as they sat on the sofa.

So, Daniel stated.

So, Jack repeated a bit more emphatically.

Soooo, Jennifer echoed as she clasped her hands together, having no
clue why she had been &apos;called in&apos; to the study.

Jen, Jack began, it&apos;s been almost six weeks since we took away your
toys.

They aren&apos;t toys, Jennifer refuted.

Any comments? Daniel prodded.

You mean besides I&apos;m sorry and admitting I had a bad attitude? the
teenager asked.

Daniel smiled and said, Yes. Anything else?

Jennifer shrugged, saying, Daddy, you were right. I was upset
with myself, and I wasn&apos;t looking at the big picture. All I knew
is that a while back, I had seen someone who looked a little like
Prince Charming to me. I didn&apos;t know him, but I wanted to. Then, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, he noticed I was alive.

~You filled out a little more,~ Jack skeptically thought about
Hamilton&apos;s motives as he listened.

Jennifer confessed, I was afraid if I talked about him that it might
jinx it. Then, when we met in the park that day, I knew I was
doing something wrong. Not in meeting him, she clarified,
looking first at Daniel and then at Jack. But in not telling
you. I felt guilty, but at the same time, I felt wonderful, she
confided, smiling at the memory.

As Daniel took their daughter&apos;s right hand in his, Jack ran his hand
along her long hair. Both were signs of support and caring.

I told Bri because I had to, or I&apos;d ... I&apos;d burst, Jennifer
confessed. Then she tattled, not to be mean, but because she was
scared.

I&apos;m glad you recognize that now, Daniel interjected softly, a smile
on his face.

I do ... now, the teenager affirmed. But then I got hurt.

Because she tattled, Jack assumed, referring to Brianna telling him
about the kiss in the park.

No, Dad, Jennifer said calmly. Staring him in the eye, she
explained, It was because I&apos;d had my first kiss, and when you found
out, you treated me like I was some ... some whore from Babylon or
something. I&apos;m your daughter, Dad. You should know me
better than that.

Jack swallowed, his emotions threatening to overtake him from the
sincerity he saw in Jennifer&apos;s eyes. Of course, he wasn&apos;t
thrilled by her strong language, either, but, right now, her language
wasn&apos;t the issue.

Jen, Jack ...

Interrupting his supportive husband, Jack spoke, Jen, I trust you;
it&apos;s the boys like Hamilton I don&apos;t trust. You&apos;re a beautiful,
sweet, innocent girl, and I want you to stay that way. He paused
briefly, then admitted, Daddy believes you may have contracted mono
from a contaminated object; I concede that&apos;s possible and that with the
nature of the kiss, maybe even probable. The problem is that we
don&apos;t know for sure one way or the other.

I&apos;m glad you&apos;re acknowledging that, Jack, Daniel told his husband.

Yes, there&apos;s that, but I still believed then that Hamilton was a jerk,
and what I want you to understand, Jennifer, is that there&apos;s nothing I
could have said about Hamilton at the time that would have made you
think he wasn&apos;t anything but that Prince Charming you mentioned a
minute ago.

Probably not, Dad, but maybe, knowing that, you could have just been
there for me, like you were after he ... I mean when ... Jennifer paused to get a handle on her emotions. When she was
ready, she more calmly and tenderly suggested, Maybe knowing that,
Dad, you could have been there for me, but without the grizzly bear.

Jack fingered through the strands of the teenager&apos;s hair and then
dropped his hand to her shoulder, his thumb caressing gently as he
said, Jen, I am sorry that I jumped the gun. I want to make it
clear that the clichéI mentioned before is true. I trust
you, but I don&apos;t trust the boys. You&apos;re just going to have to
bear with me while you grow up because my number one instinct will
always be to protect you from the wolves.

I didn&apos;t think Peter was a wolf, Jennifer whispered, swallowing from
the emotion as she bowed her head and leaned over onto Jack&apos;s
shoulder. I&apos;m sorry, Dad.

Me, too, Princess, Jack said, giving her a kiss on the forehead as
his arm wrapped around her.

Looking over at Daniel, Jennifer softly apologized, I didn&apos;t mean to
mouth off so rudely, Daddy. I was upset. That&apos;s not an
excuse; it&apos;s just how I felt.

Daniel squeezed her hand and suggested, Let&apos;s discuss your privileges.

Okay, Jennifer agreed.

Twenty minutes later, the parents returned all of Jennifer&apos;s
possessions, reminding her that, They who giveth can taketh away again
at any time.

====

Jen, Jeff sighed as he walked inside their house the next morning.

What&apos;s wrong? Jennifer asked from her spot on the sofa where she was
reading to Jenny.

A courier is outside, the boy informed her.

Not again! Jennifer sprang up off the sofa, apologizing to her
sister for being a little rough, and stormed outside, joining her
father in the driveway. Daddy, what is it now?

I don&apos;t know, Princess, Daniel answered, holding the package.

Is it from him? the teen inquired.

You&apos;ll have to open the package; there&apos;s no indication on the
outside, Daniel observed as he handed her the package.

Please wait, Jennifer asked the courier.

Look, I just need a signature and ... the courier replied.

It&apos;ll just be a minute, Daniel told him, walking over a few feet to
where Jennifer was opening the package.

Pulling out a small box, Jennifer sighed, recognizing the
wrapping. Curious as to the contents, though, she opened the gift
box, shaking her head.

It&apos;s beautiful, isn&apos;t it? Jennifer asked.

Very, and very expensive, Daniel noted about the diamond bracelet.

He&apos;s trying to buy me. I don&apos;t understand, Daddy. If he&apos;d
just ... but he doesn&apos;t ... he&apos;s ... he&apos;s trying to buy me, the girl
emotionally spoke. He just doesn&apos;t get it, that I&apos;m not for
sale. Then, with her anger mounting, she closed up the package,
walked over to the courier, and stated, Return to sender. Thank
you.

Daniel brushed by his daughter as she hurried inside, trying not to
cry, but not succeeding. He pulled out a ten-dollar bill and
said, Thank you for waiting.

Nodding, the courier left the home, package in hand.

~You&apos;re not over him, Jen,~ Daniel regretfully sighed.

====

Later that day, Daniel, Aislinn, and Jenny arrived at Susie Smith&apos;s
home to collect their new guinea pig.

There, Daddy! That&apos;s Shortcake! Aislinn exclaimed.

Shortcake? Daniel asked.

Isn&apos;t she beautiful, Daddy? Aislinn asked.

Lookie, Ash. She a fur ball, Jenny observed as Shortcake
briefly curled up against the back of the cage.

Thanks, Mrs. Smith, Daniel said as he put down the cage he&apos;d brought
with him to transport the newest Jackson-O&apos;Neill pet. Ash is
really excited.

No, thank *you*, the woman responded a bit mischievously.

Daniel could tell this wasn&apos;t her first foray into finding baby guinea
pigs homes.

Can I get her now? Aislinn asked Mrs. Smith.

Yes, Ash, you may. You remember how we did it when Janey came to
pick up her guinea pig? Mrs. Smith asked.

Yes, Ma&apos;am.

Carefully, under the adults&apos; supervision, Aislinn took Shortcake out of
the Smiths&apos; cage and put her into the one Daniel had brought. Then, slyly, Aislinn said, And we take Strawberry, too?

What? a clueless Daniel asked. Uh, who?

They sisters, Daddy. Can&apos;t sep&apos;rate sisters! Aislinn
claimed. See -- Strawberry&apos;s upset!

Strawberry? That&apos;s, uh, the other guinea pig? her father
inquired.

We like strawberry shortcake, Aislinn explained, adding, and they&apos;re
sisters, so I get Shortcake and ...

And I get Strawberry &apos;cause I like berries better than Ash does,
Jenny explained.

Yeah, Daddy, I like the cake better, Aislinn quickly agreed.

Ash, I only talked Dad into one guinea pig, Daniel stated, trying to
ignore the remaining guinea pig who was running frantically around the
cage.

But look, Jenny argued. She&apos;s so cute. Hi, Strawberry,
Jenny greeted and giggled at the same time while sticking a finger
inside to briefly tap against the furry creature who seemed almost to
purr against Jenny.

Mrs. Smith stood by quietly, watching Aislinn and Jenny work Daniel
over. In front of her eyes, the confident man was becoming a
mound of mush.

Daddy, Shortcake need her sister. See, she&apos;s unhappy, too,
Aislinn observed, pointing at the young guinea pig who was at the edge
of the cage, acting like she was trying to get out.

Ash, no! Daniel said, trying to put his foot down. Now thank
Susie and Mrs. Smith, and let&apos;s go home.

Yes, Daddy, both girls sighed and did as they were told, though each
also put on their best &apos;Danny Pout&apos; faces.

As they were walking out, Daniel heard what he swore were cries. He turned back to see the lone animal in the Smiths&apos; cage, standing on
its hind legs against the wires, emitting piteous squeals, obviously
upset at the impending separation. Hearing the cries in stereo,
Daniel looked inside the travel cage Aislinn was holding, only to see
Shortcake doing the same thing, straining with one tiny paw to reach
her sibling through the bars. Their cries seemed to be full of
pain.

I can&apos;t do it, Daniel sighed in defeat. Ash, go get
Strawberry.

YAH! times two were the little shouts heard from Aislinn and Jenny.

~Gawd. I&apos;m actually feeling a guinea pig&apos;s pain. I&apos;m a helpless pile of
mush!~ Daniel looked at Mrs. Smith and shrugged, saying, What&apos;s
a father to do?

====

Dad, look! Aislinn said brightly as they entered the living room
where Jack was checking the fish tank, a routine check that he or
Daniel did regularly to make sure everything was fine, which it
was. This is Shortcake, the little girl said, holding up the
cage.

And this is her sister, Strawberry, Jenny introduced, adding, She&apos;s
mine.

Daniel! Jack responded with a glare towards his spouse.

Ash, be very careful taking the cage upstairs, and remember, do not
open the door until I get upstairs to help you get the guinea pigs into
their new home, Daniel instructed.

Okay, Daddy, Aislinn said as she carefully and slowly walked up the
stairs.

With the children finally out of sight, Daniel turned to face Jack and
said, I couldn&apos;t leave the second guinea pig there, Jack. She
got all upset. So did Shortcake. She was the last one,
Babe, and she would have been all alone.

Daniel, we don&apos;t need a second guinea pig. I didn&apos;t want the
first one, for crying out loud, Jack argued.

That&apos;s exactly what they were doing, Jack, Daniel informed his
husband.

What, Daniel?

Crying out loud, Daniel explained.

You crumbled, Danny! an exasperated Jack accused.

I ...

You should have held your ground. You should have ... Jack
ranted, his words cut off by his lover.

Babe, you would have given in, too, Daniel said, looking
sorrowful. They were begging me, and those little guinea pigs
were crying.

Guinea pigs do *not* cry, Jack intoned pointedly.

How do you know? You weren&apos;t there! Daniel exclaimed in his
defense.

Daniel!

Well, okay, technically, you&apos;re right. They didn&apos;t cry, they
squealed -- horrible, pitiful squeals -- and besides, both Ash and
Jenny used &apos;the pout&apos; on me. Between them and the pigs, I was a
goner, Daniel admitted.

Daniel.

Jack ... Jack! Daniel rubbed his thumb against his chin. He wet his lips, and then he looked at his lover and said, Jack, we
never leave anyone behind, even if they *are* a guinea pig!

With a smile, Daniel turned and walked upstairs, leaving his husband
stunned and silent in the living room.

Oh, for crying out loud, Jack mused as he turned and stared at the
fish tank. Then, he chuckled. That&apos;s my Danny -- always a
genius! Looking over towards the kitchen, he added, Mmm. Strawberry shortcake. Sounds good; think I&apos;ll go have some.

Chapter Five: Acting Out!
====

After dinner on Monday evening, Jack strolled out onto the Aerie, the
bigger and highest of their two roof decks. He found his lover
there, self-hugging as he stood by the railing overlooking their large
backyard. The moonlight shone against Daniel&apos;s silky hair,
causing Jack to shiver in wanton lust for a moment.

Gently, Jack wrapped his arms around his lover and placed a kiss on his
neck, smiling inside when he heard Daniel&apos;s sweet moan in
response. Jack let out a contented sigh as he, too, looked out
over the yard where several of their children were playing under the
watchful eyes of their older siblings.

 Whilst August yet wears her golden crown,
Ripening fields lush - bright with promise;
Summer waxes long, then wanes, quietly passing
Her fading green glory on to riotous Autumn.
 
Daniel tilted his head to glance back at his husband, asking, What was
that?

Just something I heard somewhere, the older man responded. It&apos;s been a good summer so far.

It has, Daniel concurred, nodding slightly as he let his head settle
into the crook of Jack&apos;s neck. More, he requested softly.

Jack smiled and then recited:

 August rushes by like desert rainfall,
A flood of frenzied upheaval,
Expected,
But still catching me unprepared.
Like a match flame
Bursting on the scene,
Heat and haze of crimson sunsets.
Like a dream
Of moon and dark barely recalled,
A moment,
Shadows caught in a blink.
Like a quick kiss;
One wishes for more
But it suddenly turns to leave,
Dragging summer away.
 
The younger man sighed happily as he whispered, My poet.

For you, Angel. Are you okay? Jack asked, wondering if there
was a reason for the self-hug.

Yes, I&apos;m okay, Babe. Sometimes, though, I feel like I have to
pinch myself to make sure that all of this is real. I mean, gawd,
we are so blessed, Jack. We already have so much, and soon, we&apos;re
actually having a baby. Daniel turned around to face his Love,
running his hands up and down Jack&apos;s chest. Sometimes, aren&apos;t
you afraid you&apos;ll wake up and find out it&apos;s not ... real?

Jack nodded as he looked downward, his eyes drawn to the laughter of
their playing children. Daniel, too, glanced back at the noise,
smiling when he saw the game of tag progressing. Their children
were happy, and it showed.

Yeah, Danny, sometimes I pinch myself, too, Jack admitted. Then I do this, he added, leaning in for a kiss. That&apos;s when I
know it&apos;s all real.

And August has far to go, Daniel replied before kissing his soulmate
again. Jack ...

With a grin, Jack tapped his lover on the butt and challenged, Tag,
you&apos;re it! Catch me if you can! as he sprinted down the walkway to the
original roof deck.

You ... Daniel called out to his fleeing lover, giving chase.

Laughing, the two decided to join their children in some restful play.

====

Noa, come here, please, Daniel requested, sitting down in his
recliner in the den later that night.

Am I in trouble, Daddy? the curly-haired girl asked as she climbed up
to sit in Daniel&apos;s lap.

No, Princess. I just want to talk a minute, Daniel replied,
smiling.

Okay, Daddy, Chenoa said as she settled into place, leaning against
her father&apos;s right shoulder.

Princess, we need to talk about what&apos;s going to happen when Bean
Sprout is born. I know we&apos;ve discussed it once before, but it&apos;s
been a little while, and I thought we should chat about it again,
Daniel told the five-year-old girl.

What about Bean Sprout? Chenoa asked.

Well, Bean Sprout will be very tiny when he or she is born, and, uh,
Dad and I want the baby to be close to us, Daniel stated quietly.

Bean Sprout can share my room with Lulu, Daddy. We have lots of
space, Chenoa said about the not-so-big nursery that had been
converted to a small girl&apos;s bedroom. It now held two beds, Noa&apos;s
three-quarter-sized one and a twin bed for Lulu, a dresser for each
girl, and Noa&apos;s tea set, leaving very little unoccupied space.

We could do that, Daniel said, quickly adding, but it would be
crowded, Noa. The baby requires a crib, a changing table, and a
chest of drawers. That, uh, doesn&apos;t leave a lot of room for you
and Lulu.

Chenoa fidgeted slightly, but then offered, Lulu and I can share a
bed, Daddy.

Daniel placed a kiss on his daughter&apos;s forehead. She had a real
need to be both close to Jack and Daniel as well as to David. He
had wanted to take another shot on having her agree to move to the
spare room that was upstairs, but it didn&apos;t look like she was anxious
to do that.

Are you sure you don&apos;t want the spare room by your other brothers and
sisters? You and Lulu would have a lot more space. We could
even get you a larger tea table and ... Daniel began, using the lure
of Chenoa&apos;s tea ritual with Teal&apos;c to get her to consider the other
room.

Oh, no, Daddy. I love my tea set, Chenoa stated firmly.

Okay, Princess. We&apos;ll figure out something, but one more thing I
want you and Lulu to think hard about, Daniel stated.

What?

The baby is going to sleep a lot, and when he or she does, you have to
be very quiet. Bean Sprout will cry at night and wake you up and
...

We&apos;ll be good, Daddy. I promise, Chenoa interrupted, apparently
totally unwilling to consider a switch in room assignments.

I love you, Noa. How about some ice cream? Daniel
offered. ~She&apos;ll switch when she&apos;s ready, I guess. Lulu
would never move without her.~

Oh, boy! Ice cream! Chenoa exclaimed, climbing down. Can
I have a double-decker with strawberry and vanilla?

Daniel chuckled, You sure can.

====

Little Danny scrunched his nose in thought as he continued speaking
over the intercom to his brother-or-sister-to-be, The eighth month of
the Gregorian calendar is August, and that&apos;s where we are -- in
August. Its name came from Augustus Caesar. The little boy
chuckled, acting out, Et tu, Brute? He chuckled again as he
shifted in his spot on the sofa. That&apos;s another long story, Bean
Sprout. He added, But it&apos;s a good story.

Little Danny, what are you talking to Bean Sprout about? David asked
as he joined his younger brother.

I was telling Beany about August. Wanna help? Little Danny
inquired, still dressed in his pajamas.

Sure, David said as he searched his brain for August tidbits. I remember the obvious facts, Bean Sprout. The birthstones for
August are peridot and sardonyx, and its flowers are the gladiolus and
the poppy.

It&apos;s Weed Month, too, Little Danny commented.

It is? David asked, not having heard that before.

The little boy nodded, expounding, The Anglo-Saxons called it that
because that&apos;s when weeds and other plants grow really fast.

Oh, I remember that, David acknowledged. I forgot. Perking, he added, Yesterday was Lammas Day.

The beginning of the harvest, Little Danny added with a smile.

It comes from the Anglo-Saxon word Hlafmaesse, meaning Loaf Mass,
David commented, causing Little Danny to chuckle. What?

Dad would say we go to church for a loaf of bread, the boy mused.

David laughed, You&apos;re right, he would, but that is what it&apos;s for, Bean
Sprout. People go to church to celebrate the first corn to be cut in
their fields, and as part of that, the farmers would prepare loaves of
bread from their wheat crops and give them to the church.

It was part of communion, Little Danny explained, noting, But when
Henry the Eighth broke away from the church, the custom ended. Now, they do harvest festivals at the end of the harvest in
September. That&apos;s the ninth month, Bean Sprout.

What&apos;s going on down here? Daniel asked as he joined the boys in the
living room.

We&apos;re educating Bean Sprout about August, Daddy, David answered.

Okay, but, uh, let&apos;s get dressed first, Daniel replied, looking at
his namesake. David, would you check on Ricky for me? I
got him up, but he was lagging.

Okay, Daddy, David said, scurrying by his father and heading up the
stairs.

Bean Sprout, I&apos;ll tell you more later. Hafta go now, Little
Danny said, clicking off the intercom and monitor that fed into the den.

Daniel smiled at the young boy and then headed for the kitchen to
prepare breakfast. He and Jack had a busy day planned, and
breakfast was the first task to be achieved. Afterwards, they had
homeschooling to conduct and several errands to run. He didn&apos;t
estimate having time to breathe peacefully until all of their children
were in bed that night.

====

Roughly ten to twelve minutes away, the office at J-O Enterprises was a
madhouse of activity.

While Dora King was copying and sorting documents for several projects,
Karissa was conferring with Megan on several prospective jobs. As
her job duties increased, the object of Little Danny&apos;s affections was
learning how to bid on the more complicated projects. This meant
Ty Harper was standing by, ready to give her guidance on how to figure the
hours of labor and usage for each piece of equipment since he was J-O&apos;s
equipment and machinery expert.

Three different workers were vying with Dora for time at the copier,
all of them glancing at the clock on the wall and their watches
repeatedly.

Megan had two staff researchers looking over previous projects that
were somewhat similar to prospective projects in order to dig up
information that might save them some time in the long run regarding
customs and transportation costs.

Two field archaeologists were simply trying to use the computers to
complete their reports, which left one or the other tapping a foot,
waiting for a computer to free up.

Their in-house lawyer had also called a meeting, requiring several of
their in-house and field staff to be present as he needed to review
changes in the regulations for two upcoming digs.

All in all, it was a clear case of too many people and too much
activity at one time for the small space of the modest twelve hundred
square foot home. While everyone was attempting to keep their
frustration under control, it was causing them to lose focus on their
tasks, and some reports were bordering on being late.

As the morning passed, things only worsened, especially when four
people were vying for only two open desks. The employees&apos; tempers
were finally overtaking their patience as they bumped into one another
and had racing contests to see who could reach whatever vital piece of
equipment was necessary to complete their duties.

Everyone was calling out for Megan to find the answers, until finally,
the woman shouted out, Just get it done, People! and barricaded
herself in her office. ~Okay, it&apos;s time.~ Taking a deep
breath, she picked up the phone. When a man answered, she spoke
sharply, Jack, it&apos;s Megan.

Yeah, what&apos;s up, Megan? Jack asked as he carried Aislinn&apos;s latest
artwork to the kitchen where he used magnets to place it on the
refrigerator.

Daniel walked in from the backyard after doing some unplanned yard work
that had needed to be done before he could take care of his
errands. He was rubbing his sweaty brow and took a cleansing
breath. Seeing the artwork, he smiled at the picture -- a crowded sofa
with all eleven J-O children and a body with a question mark for its
face.

Who&apos;s on the phone? Daniel whispered, seeing Jack&apos;s grimace.

Megan. Danny, I&apos;ve never heard her like this, Jack whispered,
holding the phone out where Megan&apos;s currently shrill voice could be
heard. She&apos;s insisting we meet her at O&apos;Malley&apos;s for lunch, now,
or she&apos;s resigning.

Resigning? Daniel questioned.

Megan, we&apos;ll ... Jack began, silenced by the dial tone that suddenly
blared over the line. He stared at the phone as if it would help
him understand the strange conversation that he&apos;d just had with their
Director of Operations. ~That time of the month?~

She hung up? the younger man asked incredulously. ~That&apos;s not
like her; whatever&apos;s wrong is ... wrong.~

I think you&apos;d better take a fast shower, Love, Jack suggested. I&apos;ll get the brood who are home gathered together and see if Mrs.
Valissi can watch them.

Okay, Babe, Daniel said. ~Looks like my errands will have to
wait.~

By now, several of the children had already been chauffeured to
friends&apos; home for the afternoon. Only Jennifer, David, and the
Munchkins were home at the moment.

Dad, why do we have to go to Mrs. Valissi&apos;s? I&apos;m sixteen
now. Can&apos;t I watch them? Jennifer inquired. David can
help; you know he&apos;d love that.

Jack sighed as he considered it. Jennifer and David both were
always very responsible when placed in charge of the younger children.

**Danny, Jen wants us to let her babysit, with an assist from
David. What do you think?**

**Remind both of them of the rules, and tell Jen to keep the security
system on,** Daniel replied from the shower. **And, uh, talk to
Mrs. Valissi anyway.**

**Was planning on it,** Jack replied. Okay, Jen. Remember
... Jack began, reviewing the rules with their daughter, after which
he made a covert phone call to Mrs. Valissi who agreed to keep an eye
on the house and drop by for an unannounced visit to make sure things
were going okay a bit later.

====

Not quite an hour later, Jack and Daniel entered O&apos;Malley&apos;s and were
led to Megan&apos;s table.

Have a drink, their Director of Operations suggested, holding up her
glass. This is my fourth one.

Fourth? Daniel verified, sitting down and glancing at Jack with great
concern. Uh, I don&apos;t think you&apos;re driving when you leave here.

Already packed my keys, Megan noted, taking another drink. You
two can take me home when we&apos;re done here.

Uh, would you like to order some food? Daniel asked tentatively.

Nope, Megan answered without hesitation, shaking her head, causing
her brown hair to whip around her face, a few strands catching on her
lips. Removing the hair by blowing out some air, she added, Food
slows down the effects of the alcohol.

**Jack?**

**Definitely more than that time of the month,** Jack communicated.

Daniel stared at his lover in disbelief, but said nothing.

Hey, Marta, Jack greeted, seeing the waitress approach. How are ...

As the waitress began to hand her customers menus, Megan blocked her path, knocking the menus back and instructing, They&apos;ll take steaks, charred on one, medium well for the second; baked potatoes; salads -- ranch dressing, and two coffees. Oh, and I&apos;ll have another drink, thank you, she said in a business-like tone, dismissing the waitress with a wave of her right hand.

... you? Jack completed, surprised by Megan&apos;s actions.

Not missing a beat, Megan looked at her employers and instructed, You can pay for this and leave her a good tip for having to deal with me today.

Megan, what&apos;s wrong? a concerned Daniel inquired, leaning forward
with his arms resting on the table.

Jack was in a chair to the left of his husband, but the two chairs were
closer together so that both were somewhat opposite Megan&apos;s.

You can fire me, if you want to, but before I came here, I told Dora
to take all the non-sensitive material to Kinko&apos;s and then bring it
back to the office. I extended all the deadlines on our current
projects forty-eight hours, and I gave almost everyone the rest of the
day off. I told Karissa and Ty to make the necessary phone calls,
wait for Dora, and once she was back and they&apos;d rescheduled our
appointments, they could go home, too. All the phone calls are
being transferred to my cell phone which, at the moment, is on voice
mail.

Jack and Daniel remained silent as they watched their trusted employee
take another sip of her fifth gin and tonic.

Okay, this is the deal, Megan spoke a minute later. This
company, *your company*, is booming. It&apos;s grown, a lot. In
fact, it *is* out of control. Have either of you noticed that?

We&apos;re ... doing very well, Daniel answered quietly.

Daniel, your capacity for understatement is astonishing, Megan said a
bit sarcastically. She swallowed a third of her drink and sighed,
I realize you two never thought J-O would be as successful as it is,
but, Jack, Daniel, it is. When was the last time you looked at a
financial statement?

Like Daniel said, we&apos;re doing very well, Jack answered, well aware
that their archaeological company was giving them a nice return.

Both Jack and Daniel were well in tune with their company&apos;s financial
status, balance ledger, and reputation. They were also in touch
with their employees&apos; attitudes, all of whom were happy and had
expressed their feelings that working for J-O was a very satisfying
experience. In fact, they took a lot of pride in knowing that
their original six employees were still with them, and, in addition,
they had a very low turnover rate. In fact, it was zero, with a
possible asterisk for an employee who had been hired initially, but
before they had even opened their doors for business, he had received
another offer to work for a company in Chicago which he took.

Megan, what happened this morning? Daniel gently inquired. **Jack, she knows we&apos;ve read the statements; we review the numbers with
her regularly.**

**She&apos;s making a point, reinforcing our success, that&apos;s all,** Jack
replied.

You know how small the office is. It&apos;s a ... house and a very
small one at that. Frankly, we&apos;re bumping into each other. We have four times the employees we did when we started out a few years
ago. Megan chuckled, shaking her head. A few years
ago? Guys, we opened our doors in May 2007. It&apos;s been over
four years, and while you could afford to treat it like a hobby back
then, you can&apos;t any longer. We need new equipment, a place for
the surveyors to do their reports, a better reception area ...

As Megan talked, Daniel silently recalled how simple their operation
was when they first began. They hired Megan as their Director of
Operations and six others, four as field archaeologists and two as
researchers. Those two would be in-house while the other four
were out performing surveys and excavations. There was plenty of
room then for everyone to maneuver.

~We&apos;ve grown,~ Daniel silently admitted as he thought about their
current staff roster.

Aside from Megan and Karissa, J-O Enterprises now employed twenty-eight
people. Megan, who while retaining her same title, was
essentially handling all of the day-to-day operations, led the
group. Archaeologist Karissa Lewis had quickly proven her worth
and was now Megan&apos;s assistant.

The company employed three principal investigators who supervised
various projects and digs, eight field archaeologists with full
benefits, and five freelance archaeologists employed on an as-needed
basis. They still had the same two researchers, plus Dora, who
was a combination researcher and gopher.

In addition, J-O Enterprises also had a full-time geoarchaeologist who
specialized in geology, two historians, a part-time zooarchaeologist
who was an expert on animal bones, a GIS specialist who processed
spatial data and created mapping diagrams, one cultural resource lawyer
who kept tabs on the legal requirements of their projects and kept the
staff informed appropriately, one part-time editor who helped with
reports and publications, and a systems administrator who assisted with
database entry and collection.

The company&apos;s most recent hire was an underwater archaeologist, thus
expanding the capabilities and interests even further. Not only
that, Jack and Daniel were considering adding a full time environmental
archaeologist to their staff.

We get the idea, Jack interrupted Megan&apos;s long list of complaints,
sitting back and taking a breath. Okay, Megan, take a breath,
another sip of that drink, and then give us your list. We&apos;ll take
care of it.

Jack&apos;s words drew Daniel back into the conversation.

I&apos;m sorry if I sound pushy, but I&apos;ve been doing the best I can, but
with all the business we&apos;ve picked up in the last year, we&apos;re
overextended. I&apos;ve been trying to tell you, but ... Megan
paused, shrugging her shoulders.

We weren&apos;t listening very well, Daniel completed for her, now more
sympathetic as he realized just how much she was right. We never
thought we&apos;d be this successful, he said, echoing their friend&apos;s
words. But I&apos;m glad we are. Thanks, Megan, for doing what
you had to in order to get our attention.

I love J-O, and I suppose I lost control today because if I didn&apos;t, I
was afraid we&apos;d start to become just another company, and I know that&apos;s
not what you want, the female archaeologist said with a soft smile as
she held her glass tightly.

You&apos;re right, Daniel affirmed, pulling out his computer day planner
and opening up a notes page. Let&apos;s make some notes about the
changes we need to make.
 
====

The lovers had driven Megan home, one of them driving her car, the
other taking their Silver Fox sports car. Now, the two were
discussing the crisis at hand as they drove towards the J-O offices.

Danny, when we rejoined the Stargate Program two-and-a-half years ago
and did that small extension that enlarged those two back rooms at J-O,
I thought we were done. I never imagined we&apos;d get this big, Jack
commented.

The two owners of archaeological company had built an extension on the
back of the house/office that was about eighteen feet wide and eight
feet deep. It matched the ell on the front of the house which
projected toward the street, but was just a bit larger in both
dimensions. It transformed the location&apos;s previous ell shape into
a slightly unbalanced &apos;T&apos;. The left arm of the &apos;T&apos; was a bit
longer and thicker than the right. In the process, the closet and
hutch had been removed, and a door cut into the living room so one
could walk directly into the main room.

The initial change had resulted in a space nearly six by ten feet in
the old dining nook area. While the extension had turned the
small bedroom into an eight by sixteen space, the connecting area ended
up growing to nearly fourteen by ten and housed ToddlerTown, in its
original smaller form, the copy machine, and the plotter, which usually
was set to run at night after most of the employees had left for the
day due to the noise it made.

While the changes had been enough for a while, Jack and Daniel were now
recognizing that they needed to do more.

It&apos;s been right in front of us, Daniel replied as he made a left
turn. We&apos;ve been adding people all along, one here, one there, but
because they spend so much time out in the field, we just didn&apos;t see
the problem. Megan keeps things running so smoothly that I never
even noticed we were out of room.

Me, either, Jack noted. That&apos;s what a good leader does, Danny
-- never show how hard it really is to keep things in shape.

Yeah, Daniel affirmed. Looking back, I can think of at least
two occasions when Megan did try to tell us, though.

After we hired Sergei in January, Jack put forth about the employee
who had been their twenty-third hire.

We&apos;ve added a lot of employees this year, Babe, the archaeologist
noted. We should have known from that.

There&apos;s that, Jack agreed. I guess that explains the request
for more computers, too.

You mean the computers we told Megan we&apos;d buy next year? the younger
man inquired.

Yeah, those, the older man confirmed. We should have done more
sooner, he added.

We should have listened, Daniel opined.

Better late than never, Love, Jack stated.

You know what they say about being late, Danny.

I do? Daniel asked quizzically, glancing over at his lover as he
stopped at a stoplight.

Being late is okay, unless you get there and find the door locked,
Jack quipped.

Daniel stared at his lover for a moment, then shook his head quickly,
and stared at the light, hoping it would turn green soon.

====

It was a real mess, Daniel, Karissa said in reply to the
archaeologist&apos;s question.

Jack and Daniel had finally reached their company&apos;s office, which was
really just the house Daniel had purchased several years earlier and
converted to a small office. Dora and Ty had just left a few
minutes earlier, and Karissa was headed for the door when Jack and
Daniel walked in.

Currently, Jack was on the phone, checking in with Jennifer and making
sure all was well at home while Daniel conversed with Karissa for a few
minutes.

Karissa, how long has it been like that? Daniel inquired.

It usually isn&apos;t this bad, Daniel, or I think we would have had a
disaster a long time ago, the woman replied. What happened
today, though, was that everyone was in town at the same time, and
lately, that&apos;s beginning to happen. It wouldn&apos;t be so bad if we
had additional work areas, she said, pointing out at the workspace.

Daniel nodded as he looked around, then said, Thanks, Karissa. Go on home.

Are you sure? If you and ...

No, go home. Thanks, the archaeologist repeated to the
dedicated employee.

Tell Little Danny &apos;hi&apos; for me, okay? the woman requested.

I will, Daniel answered, watching as Karissa picked up her purse,
waved at Jack, and left the house/office.

A moment later, Jack disconnected his call, announcing, All&apos;s well at
home. What do you think?

One word, Daniel sighed.

Jack smiled, and together, they said, Alex!

====

Alex Dennison, the designer greeted.

Alex, it&apos;s Daniel Jackson-O&apos;Neill, the archaeologist announced.

Daniel, it&apos;s good to hear from you. How&apos;s Jack? Alex asked.

Daniel couldn&apos;t help but smile. In the past, anytime he&apos;d call
Alex, the first question was usually something about the house and was
everything okay.

~Dating Soncirria has been good for him,~ Daniel thought
silently. He&apos;s great, he answered aloud.

But? Alex prodded, sensing a hesitation in the man&apos;s voice.

Well, let me put it simply. HELP! Daniel said with a raised
voice, chuckling a little afterwards.

Alex laughed, too, and inquired, The house?

Yes. NO. I mean, uh, well, not exactly, Daniel answered,
suddenly losing his focus.

What exactly is it? Alex asked curiously.

Well, it may be a little hard to explain. Actually I&apos;m not sure
if anything can be done, but Jack and I ... I mean, we knew if anyone
could do it, it would be you. It&apos;s important and ...

Interrupting the man&apos;s ramblings, Alex laughingly teased, Daniel,
while you&apos;ve been talking, I just finalized the color scheme for a law
office, penciled in the next three weeks of meetings and deadlines,
and decided where to have lunch. Spit it out, man!

In one giant breath, Daniel answered, Alex, weareovercrowdedat J-O
Enterprises andneedyoutocomeandfixit -- soon!

Alex blinked, trying to decipher the statement. He&apos;d heard his
name, and the name of the business Jack and Daniel owned. He also
heard &apos;fix it&apos; and &apos;soon&apos;.

~Okay, they&apos;ve got a problem with their office.~ Glancing at his
calendar, Alex replied, I see. When did you want this project
completed? ~I&apos;ll figure out what he said later.~

Yesterday, came the reply from Jack, who had lifted the cell phone
from Daniel&apos;s ear. Seriously, Alex, we need this job completed
as soon as possible.

Sunny&apos;s going to visit her mother for a few days so that frees up some
time for me, Alex began.

Jack chuckled, silently communicating, **Danny, you&apos;ll love this. He has time because Sunny is going to visit Momsey!**

Daniel smiled in acknowledgement of the statement, as Jack listened to
Alex.

I&apos;ll meet you in the Springs the day after tomorrow at Archonics, 8
a.m. sharp, Alex instructed. I&apos;ll need a blueprint of the
house, the abstract, and a copy of the zoning restrictions for the
neighborhood. E-mail or fax those zoning laws to me ASAP; that
will tell me what we can&apos;t do. After I review it, I&apos;ll call you
later with questions about what you had in mind.

Done, the general said before disconnecting the call. Danny,
where are the blueprints?

For the next hour, the lovers worked on obtaining what Alex had asked
for, faxing him the zoning laws as well, adding a proviso to their fax
that their copy was now two years old and they&apos;d have to try and get an
updated copy in the morning. Then they did a walkthrough of
their office, each wanting to make sure they were familiar with the
current set up and problems on how things were situated while
discussing possibilities in their own mind.

====

Meanwhile, when Alex hung up from his call with Jack and Daniel, he
mused, Why do I keep saying yes to these guys? Growing serious,
he sighed inwardly, ~Because they believed in you when you needed a
chance to prove yourself to Byron.~ After a minute, he glanced
over at the photo of he and Sunny that graced his desk. And
because Daniel believed in more than my abilities. He believed in
me, the man, and now I have Sunny. I owe them both, the designer
spoke aloud as he made sure his calendar was clear for the trip to
Colorado Springs.

====

Bed! Daniel ordered.

But, Daddy, I wanted to tell Bean Sprout more about August, Little
Danny whined and then let out a big sneeze. Seeing Daniel&apos;s
resolve, he let out a giant sigh and marched upstairs to his
exile. I&apos;ll be all by myself.

No, you won&apos;t, Little Danny, Jonny said. I&apos;ll go to bed,
too. We can tell ghost stories.

Daniel smiled as Jonny put his arm around his brother and trudged
upstairs with him. He knew odds were good Jonny would catch the
cold, but keeping the Munchkins apart was something that had proven
nearly impossible over the years. He was about to wonder why
Aislinn wasn&apos;t part of the trio when all of a sudden he heard the
little girl&apos;s voice.

Wait for me! Aislinn called out. I know a good ghost story.

Hurry up, Ash, Jonny replied.

Daniel chuckled and walked into the study about to say something when
he realized Jack was on the phone.

Megan, you definitely were *not* out of line. When we promoted you to ... Jack stopped, sighed, and then said, Maybe we should have given you a new job title. After a brief chuckle, he continued, When we promoted you, we gave you the ball, relying on you to make sure things continued to run smoothly because we couldn&apos;t be at the office as much anymore. We asked you to take that ball and run with it, and you did.

I&apos;ve tried. I really care about J-O, Megan spoke sincerely.

We know, and you proved that again today, Jack asserted.

But I ...

You did your job today, Megan, Jack interrupted. It&apos;s Daniel
and I who should apologize to you for making your job so difficult.

I appreciate that, Jack, Megan gratefully intoned.

Daniel and I spent a couple of hours at the office this afternoon and
made some decisions. I think you&apos;ll like the outcome, Jack told
her. We just need to hear back from Alex.

I feel so bad. I sent everyone home and ... a regretful Megan
began.

Megan, you did what you had to do. Don&apos;t second guess
yourself. Enjoy your evening, and that&apos;s an order! Jack barked
with a smile in his tone.

Yes, Sir, Megan answered, hanging up the phone.
 
She feels guilty? Daniel asked as he sat down on the sofa.

Oh, yeah, Jack confirmed, moving to sit down next to his lover. We&apos;ve come a long, long way, Danny.

I think we have some good ideas, Daniel remarked.

So let&apos;s see what Alex comes up with, the older man suggested. Everything will be fine.

Jack ...

Trust me, Danny. Alex knows how to make things happen in the
construction and design world. He&apos;ll take our ideas and work his
magic, Jack spoke confidently.

I hope so. If he doesn&apos;t ...

Daniel knew it might be more sensible to sell the house and move J-O&apos;s
offices somewhere larger, but he really didn&apos;t want to for a number of
reasons. For one thing, the location was convenient for them, and
for another, he had a sentimental attachment to the house as being a
symbol for Jack and Daniel&apos;s life outside of &apos;Don&apos;t Ask, Don&apos;t Tell&apos;
which had run their lives for years. Besides, the company
wouldn&apos;t get any bigger. He was sure of it, so all they needed to
do was fix the concerns which Megan and Karissa had brought to their
attention.

He will, Jack intoned. I&apos;m confident.

Daniel chuckled, saying, I&apos;m confident, too.

====

During the next twenty-four hours, the office building of J-O
Enterprises was visited by the building code inspector; Garrett, who
was the construction foreman; and Gordon Leviwitz, the general
contractor. After communicating with each of them and also with
Megan, Alex felt ready to meet with Jack and Daniel as scheduled and
discuss his proposal. From his condo in Florida, he made a final
phone call to the couple.

Guys, if you approve of what I have laid out, we can begin right after
the meeting tomorrow. If you have no objection, I&apos;d like to
invite Megan to join us. I know you are footing the bill, but if
I am reading the situation correctly, she is the lady in charge of the
day-to-day operations, Alex deduced.

No problem at all, Alex, Jack affirmed. In fact, we think it
would be a good idea to include Karissa Lewis, Megan&apos;s
second-in-command, as well.

Hey, it&apos;s your party, Alex replied cheerfully.

And I&apos;ll cry if I want to, Jack chimed.

Standing nearby, Daniel rolled his eyes, groaning at Jack&apos;s jest. Jack just smiled, refusing to tell his husband that Alex had just
groaned as well.

I&apos;ll see all four of you tomorrow, Alex said, anxious to get a few
hours sleep before catching his early-bird flight to Colorado Springs,
especially since he knew that the Jackson-O&apos;Neills were always a
designer&apos;s challenge.

Goodnight, Alex, Jack spoke, hanging up the phone and then suddenly
chasing his lover through the house, ending up in their bedroom where
they kissed passionately for several minutes before being reminded that
their children were still up.

Remember where we left off, Daniel requested as he got up.

Count on it, Love, Jack smirked as he followed his husband back
downstairs.

====

Jack and Daniel left their house, leaving Jennifer and Jeff in charge
of their younger brothers and sisters, and headed for their scheduled
meeting.

At precisely 8 a.m. on Thursday morning, Alex Dennison greeted the
Jackson-O&apos;Neills, Megan, and Karissa cheerfully at the offices of
Archonics Ltd., quickly getting down to business as he suggested,
Let&apos;s begin, shall we?

While three faces smiled in eager anticipation, all Doctor Daniel
Jackson-O&apos;Neill could muster was a nod followed by another drink of his
Starbucks.

~Why&apos;d we make love last night? And when we woke up in the middle
of the night? And then again before breakfast?~ Daniel
glanced over at his husband and grinned. ~Oh, yeah, that&apos;s why.~

Daniel? Alex called out. DANIEL!

Wha...what? Yes, here, present!

Everyone laughed, and Daniel hung his head, shaking it quickly as he
gulped down more of his coffee.

Late night? Megan teased.

And morning, Jack replied, beaming with pride.

Too much info, Jack, Alex joked.

Hearing Daniel&apos;s groans, Jack said, Don&apos;t worry, Daniel; only fourteen
more hours of the day to get through.

Jack ... be quiet, Daniel replied in his best snarky tone.

Why don&apos;t we get to the point of this meeting, Alex suggested. Having spoken with each of you individually, I think I have a plan
that will meet most of your needs and can be done quickly with a
minimum of disruption both to your corporation and the neighborhood,
the designer said.

How fast can you get it done? Jack questioned.

After a burst of laughter, Alex countered with, Most people want to
know how much it&apos;s going to cost first.

After another round of chuckles, all eyes were again focused on Alex.

Let&apos;s begin with the structural limitations, but before we do that, I
want to address the aesthetics. I want to replace all the carpet
with an industrial-grade blue tweed carpet throughout that will pick up
the tan and brown accents. To make the entire interior space look
more upscale and professional, I would like to see some simple crown
molding installed throughout. That&apos;s pretty much it for the
background except for painting the walls and adding some artwork. Are we in synch?

Oh, yes, please, Karissa exclaimed. Seeing Jack and Daniel
staring at her, she shrugged and added teasingly, I like upscale.
 
What she means is that we&apos;re tired of looking at a house that&apos;s
supposed to be an office, Megan explained. We&apos;ve never quite
gotten far enough away from the fact that it is a house.

A hoffice, Jack quipped, earning him stares from everyone in the
room. What? he asked, shrugging. It&apos;s a house and an
office -- a hoffice.

Jack, so help me you start calling J-O a hoffice, and I&apos;ll ...

You&apos;ll what? Jack smirked, his sparkling eyes melting his slightly
irritated soulmate.

What&apos;s next, Alex? Daniel asked, closing his eyes to soak up the
aroma of his next sip of coffee and shut up the child in his husband.

Putting aside the sample board he had used to show off his ideas, Alex
continued, As I said, we need to know what we can&apos;t do, before we
proceed. There are restrictions on how much of the ground we can occupy
with building. Many of the houses in the neighborhood were once
ranch style houses, but have had second floors added. Unfortunately, the existing structure here will not support a second
floor. To the three crestfallen people and one bleary-eyed
archaeologist in front of him, the designer added, I said *existing*
structure. We can beef it up so it *will* support a second floor.

Beefing is good, Karissa interjected enthusiastically, smiling over
at Jack who gave her one of his intimidation stares, causing her to
cough evasively as she refocused on Alex.

Alex continued, Here&apos;s what I propose: Use what is here to its best
advantage. We can get by with almost no tear-out of the existing
house. I want to extend the front of the house out even with the
bedroom extension. This will enlarge the main workspace and the
entrance, giving the house some much needed curb appeal. The
extension will be supported by wood piers which will take the brunt of
the load of the second floor.

Wanting to get to the heart of the matter, Jack questioned, What goes
up on the high ground, and how long will it take to build?

All in good time, Jack. Let&apos;s finish the downstairs first, Alex
responded. Continuing on, he addressed Karissa, saying, As
you mentioned, the building needs to be an office, but the reality is
that it&apos;s a house. Since it is in a residential neighborhood, it
must look like a house and be able to be sold as a house, should the
need arise. However, since functionally it needs to be an office,
the closet in the front office is being put to very poor use.

Amen, Megan smirked.

Jack glared at her and teased, Are you bucking to get fired?

Go ahead, make my day, Megan deadpanned in response.

Jack, we need her, Daniel replied in a serious tone, his eyes still a
little fogged by the earliness of the hour.

Daniel, Jack replied, putting his hand on his lover&apos;s right arm that
was atop the table. Just drink your coffee. She&apos;s not
going anywhere. Tell him, Megan.

He&apos;s right, Daniel, the woman chuckled. I think he needs more
coffee.

Rolling his eyes, Alex walked over to the side table and brought over a
thermos full, stating, All Starbuck&apos;s.

Daniel grinned sappily as he poured more of his favorite coffee into
his near-empty coffee mug and then let out a contented sigh.

Megan and Karissa chuckled, and Megan couldn&apos;t help herself, leaning
over and whispering to Jack, What did you do to him?

Jack grinned, raised his eyebrows several times, and replied, Trust
me, Megan, you *so* do not want to know.

You&apos;re right, but next time, Jack, could you do whatever it was when
we don&apos;t have a morning meeting scheduled? Megan asked, smiling.

Jack simply grinned, pleased to the max with himself and his effect on
his lover.

Meanwhile, Alex just shook his head, thinking, ~I&apos;m glad I cleared my
calendar completely for today. Nothing goes by the book with
these guys.~

Go on, Alex, Jack instructed.

I propose installing a system of easily changed shelving and bins,
Alex suggested. There will be a space to hang two coats. The
desks are ergonomically designed to minimize physical stress, and,
Karissa, your desk will have a rounded side extension so you could have
a mini-conference with one or two people.

That sounds great, Alex, Karissa intoned. Um, what about the
bathroom? she asked.

We have one, Jack replied.

Yes, a very *old* one, Karissa bravely replied. Jack, you have
an office full of men and women, and it&apos;s getting fuller by the month.

Karissa, I&apos;m suggesting new fixtures and replacing the tub with a
shower to give more space, Alex responded.

How about a bigger mirror, Alex? Megan requested.

We can do that, Alex agreed.

Anyone care what we think? Jack inquired of the designer and two
females.

No! came the response from all three, along with instant laughter.

Just thought I&apos;d ask, Jack replied a bit hesitantly. Alex ...

Go on, Megan and Karissa gaily chuckled in unison.

Jack stared at them and asked, You two are enjoying this, aren&apos;t you?

We&apos;ve waited for this a long time, Jack, Megan answered truthfully,
Karissa nodding in agreement.

Jack nodded, and Alex seized the momentary silence as his chance to
continue.

All of you indicated the office is busier now than ever, which is why,
in part, I&apos;m suggesting some switching of your current locations, Alex
stated.

What? all four said.

Unless there&apos;s an objection, I propose that Karissa move into Megan&apos;s
old space, Alex explained.

Yes! Karissa excitedly exclaimed.

The designer continued, Since the enlarged living room will be devoted
entirely to workstations, we need another play space for the
brood. I checked out the basement and believe that would make an
excellent playroom for the children when they are at the office.

Alex, Megan interrupted. I like that idea, but when the brood
is there, we need a small workstation down there for whomever is
watching them.

Karissa added, The children are never left unattended.

She&apos;s right, which is why a small workstation with just a laptop and
the basics would be helpful for us, Megan suggested.

Jack and Daniel smiled at the intensity of both of the females&apos;
comments.

Nodding, Alex added, There is a water leakage problem which is easily
remedied. We&apos;ll only have to dig a hole in the backyard about
six-feet wide, so I propose we turn a disadvantage into an advantage by
installing an outdoor access stairwell in that location instead of
filling up the hole again. It can be used in case of fire or
emergency to get whoever is in the basement out to safety. Once
that is accomplished, the outdated heating/AC system needs upgrading
and a few receptacles installed upstairs in the main level.

Alex, I don&apos;t mean to interrupt, Megan said. The basement
works as a playroom in my opinion, but that puts them a long way from
the bathroom.

He&apos;ll have a plan, Daniel practically whispered as he sipped more of
his coffee.

Alex smiled at the archaeologist&apos;s confidence in him and interjected,
As a matter of fact, I do.

See! Daniel said, grinning as he began to come to life, a direct
result of his consuming more of his stimulant of choice.

Chuckling for a moment, Alex explained, Megan, I have a full bath in
the basement planned as well as a projects area with a sink and
countertop.

That works! Karissa happily expressed, sharing a smile with Megan.

Since they are children and the unexpected does happen, Alex
continued, I also would suggest a closet to keep a change of clothes
for each of the seven youngest children; and, if you need to change
their clothes, you will need to wash them, not to mention the towels
they use, too, so I have included a washer/dryer stack as well as tons
of sound deadening insulation in the ceiling.

Amen, Megan said with vigor. I wish we had had this the day it
rained, and the little darlings decided it would be fun to play
outside.

**Jack, do you know anything about this?** Daniel asked as his senses
began to work more fully.

**Not a clue, Love,** Jack responded.

Seeing the confusion on her employers&apos; faces, Megan explained, It
happened towards the end of winter while the two of you were out of
town, and your meeting got extended unexpectedly.

**We were off world,** Daniel recalled.

We never mentioned it because they were just being kids, and Jeff was
such a help in getting the boys cleaned up, Megan added.

Jeff? the two parents chorused.

Laughing out loud, Megan and Karissa stopped the meeting until they
could compose themselves, and still they were trying hard not to giggle
a couple of minutes later.

Megan expounded, Little Danny refused to take off his clothes in front
of us and his sisters. Jonny and Ricky followed suit.

I ... I off...offered to have ... Megan and everyone ... else ...
leave ... the room, but he said ... oh, oh, I can&apos;t, I can&apos;t ...
Karissa trailed off, laughing so hard she couldn&apos;t breathe.

Would you let us in on the joke, already? Jack asked, grinning from
the women&apos;s infectious laughter.

He ... he said ... he couldn&apos;t take his clothes off in front of me ...
be...because we weren&apos;t ... weren&apos;t ... m... ma...ma... married! the
helpless woman finally finished before holding her sides in rollicking
gales of laughter.

Daniel blushed for his namesake, and giggled, **Jack, that talk we had
with him must have sunk in.**

**Guess so. That little monkey -- shy just like his daddy,** Jack
mused.

Megan continued to explain the rest of the incident, saying, Little
Danny said only Dad, Daddy, or his biggest brother Jeff could help him
take a bath, so I called the school and went to pick up Jeff. He
took the three boys into the bathroom, and, in no time, they emerged
squeaky clean. We washed their clothes in the kitchen sink and
wrung them out as best we could. They only had to wear them while
I ran them home to change. Jeff showered and changed at the house
and came back with us to watch the Munchkins and the Spitfires until
Jen got home.

That&apos;s a go on the washer/dryer, Alex, Jack said, nodding as if he
had liked the idea from the get-go when, in reality, he had started to
balk at the idea.

The kitchen will become a beverage center with a ... Alex began authoritatively.

Beverage center? Jack asked, interrupting the man standing in front
of them. What makes up the beverage center, Alex -- vending
machines?

Alex chuckled, No, Jack. The beverage center is designed to
service the need for beverages, snacks, lunches, and maybe a working
late dinner. We&apos;ll install a larger refrigerator, with an ice
maker and a slightly larger sink, and lose the stove and the
dishwasher. We&apos;ll give the cabinets on the opposite wall a fresh
coat of paint, and that&apos;s it. The sink will also have an instant
hot water dispenser for tea, soups, and cocoa.

That&apos;ll be wonderful during the winter, Karissa commented.

Lose the dishwasher? Lose the stove? Megan questioned in
consternation. How do we make those lunches and dinners?

The appliances are old, and if there&apos;s no stove, you can&apos;t cook, and
where there&apos;s no cooking, there are no dirty dishes, Alex began,
quickly adding, Unless you really had your heart set on ...

Lose that stove! Megan cried. Lose that dishwasher, rah, rah,
rah! she cheered gaily.

Want some pom-poms, Megan? Jack asked jovially.

I have two, and they are just fine, thank you, the woman teased.

Pom-poms are ...

Jack, let&apos;s let Alex finish, Daniel requested, fearing the current
direction of the conversation.

Megan chuckled, Jack looked put out, and, smiling, Alex continued, The
refrigerator will be roomy enough to hold a few two-liter bottles, a
couple of cases of soda in dispensing racks, and some bagged
lunches. It will have a freezer compartment large enough for a
dozen frozen dinners.

We *have* to have a microwave, Megan stated with force. Cold
lunches and dinners only go so far.

Of course, Alex acknowledged with a tiny smile. If you want one, there would be room for a toaster oven, too, but that&apos;s about it.

Can we make that a convection oven? Karissa asked hopefully. You can do so much more with convection.

Yes, we can, the designer said, nodding as he made a notation.

Sounds good. Next? the general commanded.

Yes, Sir, Alex snapped amid chuckles from the others. The
former breakfast nook/Karissa&apos;s desk space/ kids&apos; play area will become
the copy and filing center. The necessary files will be moved to
there. As he continued to speak, he saw the approving smiles of
the two women in the room. We&apos;ll put a copy and collating
machine here and two laser printers, one color, one black and white.

A collator? Karissa spoke in awe, her voice actually lilting. Oh, Megan. No more trips to Kinko&apos;s!

**Gawd, Jack, have they asked for a collator before?**

**I don&apos;t think so, Danny,** Jack responded mentally.

Alex continued, The two offices will each have a printer in
them. Three additional printers will be shared by the permanent
workstations. You&apos;ll need to decide how many will be laser versus
inkjet printers and which ones you want to be color or black and white.

Noted, Megan replied, making a note in her binder.

The designer then reminded, Megan, you may want to put several of
these printers on a queue, so that when one printer is unavailable, the
job will automatically feed to the next printer, and the next, if
necessary. To do so, all of the printers on a queue should be the
same type to ensure identical printing in the case of legal documents.

Good idea, Alex, and I understand, the woman acknowledged, jotting
down more notes about decisions that would need to be made
quickly. Uh, we could have two different queues, if we desired,
right?

Yes, Alex explained. You can even change the queue set up as
needed. If it doesn&apos;t matter if something is printed with an
inkjet or a laser printer, it can go in an open queue and whichever
printer is available next will print it. You can exempt certain
printers from the open queue as needed or place them in a secondary
queue.

What if there&apos;s a rush job? Daniel inquired.

If a printer is needed for a priority project, or is not functioning,
it can be exempted from the queue and put back when the situation is
remedied, Alex answered firmly.

How about our field staff, Alex? Megan asked. Sometimes they
come in at the worst times and need immediate access to desks,
computers ...

That&apos;s why I&apos;ve added three &apos;floater&apos; workstations utilizing laptops
-- one at the reception desk, one near the filing cabinets in the copy
room, and one downstairs, Alex replied. If you have a full
house and everything is urgent, your extended desk would accommodate
still another floater. Each of these can access any of the three
main workroom printers via wireless routers. That would also be a
good reason to have a queue set up. If you start using more than
two floater stations on a regular basis, it&apos;s time to start looking for
a larger space, or a second location.

Making another note, Megan nodded and said, Okay. Silently, she
thought, ~Thank you, Alex, for planting that seed and for giving us a
definition of when we will need more space that these two will
understand.~

**We couldn&apos;t possibly get that big, could we, Danny?** Jack asked,
staring at the notes he&apos;d made while tapping his notebook with his pen.

**No, I&apos;m sure we&apos;ve reached our peak. I feel lucky we&apos;ve been
accepted as much as we have,** Daniel replied.

**It&apos;s you,** Jack commented.

**I don&apos;t know,** Daniel replied shyly, still finding it hard to accept that he was respected in his field of choice.

**I do,** Jack firmly replied, looking over at Daniel and giving him an
affirmative nod, prompting Daniel to smile in response before
refocusing on the meeting.

The plotter will be behind doors in the room in a cabinet. It
will pivot out to load and unload, but will be muffled in the
soundproof cabinet. The entire house will have sound-deadening
insulation in the ceilings, but this area will have the walls done as
well, Alex explained.

It&apos;s very loud, so everyone is going to like that improvement, Megan
commented.

We have the major areas to go over yet, but I, for one, could use a
break, Alex suggested.

The group got up, stretching and walking around. Alex went to his
office, placing a call to Sunny, just to say &apos;hello&apos;.

Megan and Karissa visited the restroom, each chattering away about the
impending improvements to their workplace.

Jack and Daniel, meanwhile, walked over to the window and stared out at
the street below.

Ah, Jack, Daniel quietly stated, knowing perfectly well that he&apos;d
been a bit out of it for the first part of the meeting.

Yes, Daniel?

Next time you ... you know ... before breakfast, I&apos;ll ... Daniel
began.

Yes, Daniel? Jack asked, his face bright with loving deviousness.

Paybacks, Love, and you know me, I *know* how to get payback, Daniel
smirked, heading back over to the table where he picked up a donut and
ate it seductively in front of his lover.

**Yes, you do,** Jack responded, using their special way of
talking. **But, Danny, you did ... like it?**

**Gawd, yes. Don&apos;t ask silly questions, Jack,** Daniel
communicated, smiling. His mind began to review the
meeting. ~Hmmm. Wireless router. We need a network so
we can link up at home.~

====

Ten minutes later, Alex reconvened the meeting.

We have two more areas to deal with on this level. The first is
the major work area. Once we do the extension of the house, we&apos;ll
have an area twenty-five feet long and twelve-feet wide. Let me
have your opinions on this, Alex requested, showing his sketch of the
space.

Down the center, with just enough room to walk around each end was a
single object. It was a long, narrow, and rectangular with seven
alternating arcs cut out of it, four on one side and three on the
other. The ends were arced. Drawers and printers occupied
the space beneath the straight sections of the surface.

This is brilliant, Alex. You&apos;ve created seven workstations, all
of them out in the center of the space, Megan ranted.

Look, Megan, they&apos;re equal. None of these work areas will make
any of the staff feel slighted or left out, Karissa pointed out, well
aware that in the past, they&apos;d had some internal issues over work space.

It&apos;s more than I could have imagined, Megan agreed.

What&apos;s the surface material? Karissa asked, looking up at the
designer.

To be determined, perhaps marble or granite-like. It will all be
cut and shaped from one solid piece, Alex answered.

And the color? Megan inquired.

You can choose the color, Alex responded.

What about the rest of the parts of the workstations? Daniel
questioned as he continued to review the plans.

The designer replied, The drawer units and printer stands are
free-standing component pieces that support the work surface. The
extra receptacles are run from the basement. The lighting is very
powerful indirect, but is supplemented by strategically placed recessed
lights.

I am truly impressed, Karissa praised.

Jack? Daniel? Alex called out.

So far, so good, Alex, Daniel responded, glancing at his lover for
confirmation.

The girls are happy, Jack chuckled. Like we said when we first
talked to you about the remodeling, Daniel and I are there two or three
days a week and only for a few hours at a time, but Megan and Karissa
are there every day, eight hours or more. From their comments and
expressions, I&apos;d say you&apos;re hitting the mark.

Nodding, Alex stated, Okay then, that leaves one area on this
level, the back office. I propose that it be left as an
office. You probably have someone you want to promote.

Good point, Jack acknowledged, two or three people immediately coming
to mind.

We&apos;ll discuss that later, but I agree we have a few people who have
definitely earned their own office, Daniel commented. Looking
over at the women, he asked, Megan?

Definitely, Megan agreed, nodding as she made more notes.

Great, Alex replied with a smile. Looking at his clients, he
asked, Now you are probably wondering where your offices are going to
be?

Second floor, both Jack and Daniel said, smiling at each other.

Chuckling, Alex confirmed, Yes, that&apos;s right.

Do we get a prize? Jack inquired jovially.

My bill, Alex retorted. After a few chuckles, he continued,
The changes I&apos;ve outlined up to this point have been limited and
largely cosmetic, with the exception of the extension of the entire
front out even with the front bedroom. Now we come to the large
changes. Jack, Daniel, Megan, you each need an office. You
also need a small comfortable lounge-type area where the senior staff
can hold informal meetings and brainstorming sessions. In
addition, you mentioned adding a conference room as being high on your
priority list. Of course, you&apos;ll need bathrooms as well; and, no,
I have not forgotten that this needs to retain a residential
appearance, as well as being readily convertible to a dwelling that can
be sold quickly.

We don&apos;t want to lose the ability to sell the place, if we wanted to
at some point, Jack commented.

I think Alex just said that, Jack, Daniel countered.

He&apos;s supposed to be talking about our offices, the older man replied.

He is, Daniel stated.

No, he&apos;s not, Jack refuted.

Yes, he is ... or would be, if you&apos;d stop interrupting him, the
younger man bemoaned a bit testily.

With his eyes closed, Alex counted to ten, thinking, ~Why am I doing
this? Oh, yes, I like them. Why do I like them?~ Taking a big breath to refresh his mental attitude, Alex pressed on,
saying, Boys, your attention, please.

Sorry, Jack quickly replied as Daniel rolled his eyes.

Knowing his lover was a tad unhappy with him at the moment, Jack
decided to try to impress him by continuing the discussion,
questioning, Alex, what about prefab? We used it before
successfully. Can something like that be done here?

Jack, you&apos;re right on target, but a prefab structure would have to be
trucked in and that would be difficult to hoist, unless a couple of
helicopters were at the ready to do a slick zip bang lifteroo right on
to the first floor, Alex replied.

A bit smugly, Jack muttered, I could arrange that.

**Jack!**

**Well, I could!** Jack silently argued with his husband.

I&apos;m sure you could, Alex began in reply, but you guys prefer to keep
a low profile and that would be an attention-getter for sure, no matter
how quickly and quietly it was done.

Just leave that to me, Jack said boastfully.

**Jack, we&apos;re talking a residential neighborhood, not Cheyenne Mountain
or Peterson. DOWN!** Daniel barked in their minds.

Alex shook his head, saying, Jack, it really won&apos;t be necessary.&quot;

It won&apos;t? Jack questioned.

No, it won&apos;t. I got to thinking ... Alex began, only to be
interrupted.

That&apos;ll cost us, Jack snickered.

It sure will. My fee went up about twenty minutes into our
session today, Alex teased, though looking very serious. &quot;And nothing
says it couldn&apos;t go up again.

Jack made a motion as if locking his lips with a key.

I&apos;m sure Marcel Marceau is shaking in his shoes, Alex
deadpanned. After the laughter settled, he continued, Moving
from levity to more important matters, I got to thinking. The
prefab houses are lifted into place with cranes, so we just need to use
cranes about ten feet taller. Is everyone with me?

Four people nodded, one thinking, ~I can see my reflection in this
table. Hmmm. Do I look fat?~ With a frown, Jack
communicated, **Danny, am I getting fat?**

**WHAT?** Daniel shouted in his mind.

**What?** Smiling at Alex in a diversionary tactic, Jack&apos;s mind
retreated. ~Bad idea, O&apos;Neill.~

**What?**

**What?** Jack nodded as if totally involved in the
meeting. ~Just act innocent. He can&apos;t prove a thing.~

**Jack, be quiet.**

A series of questions followed, each from a different person in the
room.

Can you do this? Daniel inquired.

Have you ever done this before? Megan asked with intrigue.

Do you have someone lined up to tackle this? Jack asked.

How long will this part take? Karissa queried, silently wondering how
long they would have to shut down the office.

The designer looked intently at each person and answered his or her
question in order.

Absolutely! Alex said, giving Daniel a convincing nod.

No, but I&apos;ve done a lot of things I&apos;ve never done before, the
designer told Megan. ~Just ask Sunny. Oops! Did I
really think that in public?~

Yes, Gordon and Stuart are ready and eager to begin, and I know you
trust their work, Alex replied to Jack, and then thought, ~Your
security measures might slow us up a bit. We need to talk about
that.~

Looking at Karissa, the man in charge answered, If we do as much prep
work in advance as possible, the actual lift in place will take a day,
possibly less.

Stunned silence caused the designer&apos;s confidence to wilt a little.

Can we see the plans, Alex? Karissa asked.

Unrolling a sheet with a floor plan, the designer recovered his poise
and began pointing out the design features of the space. Megan
and Karissa were delighted with Alex&apos;s ideas and were pleased to see
Jack and Daniel nodding in affirmation of the plans.
 
The upper floor was reached by a stairwell that was positioned directly
over the existing one to the basement. There were three large
offices, one each for Jack, Daniel, and Megan. Megan&apos;s office
included a walk-in closet and private bath with shower. Heading
off questions, the designer stated that if and when the office were
ever sold, Megan&apos;s office would be the master suite.

Her office would be ready for use as such with no construction or
conversion necessary -- just change the carpet and the furniture, Alex
expounded. He continued, Jack, Daniel, you requested new energy
efficient windows, and we can do that at the same time we install the
second floor. Any questions, opinions, or requests?

Can we have some greenhouse windows in our offices for plants Megan
asked.

Alex responded, Actually, the second level extends back even with the
rear addition. As long as Jack and Daniel have no objections, I
propose that this area be closed in with glass, like an atrium. It would make a wonderful break area with a couple of tables and some
chairs and maybe a small park bench. In the event of the office
being sold, it would make a great dining area. Seeing the woman
looking a bit disappointed, Alex added, Your office could include
greenhouse windows, Karissa&apos;s, too, since we are replacing all the
windows on the first level anyway. Jack, Daniel, does that meet
with your approval?

Just as long as you don&apos;t start talking to them instead of the
clients, Jack teased.

After a chuckle, Jack&apos;s, Megan suggested, What about skylights? That would be awesome.

Not on the first floor; there&apos;s nowhere to put them. However,
the upstairs floor could be cut back a few feet and let light from
skylights on the roof spill down.

Central vac? Daniel questioned, since they didn&apos;t have a separate
cleaning service for the house/office.

Alex responded, Absolutely, Daniel.

There is one more thing, Alex, Karissa asked, a charming smile on her
face.

Ask, Fair One, Alex replied, bowing to Karissa.

Careful, you&apos;ll make Little Danny jealous! Jack teased jovially.

No contest, Jack, Karissa said, acting offended. Suddenly, she
looked at Alex with a slight look of horror, apologizing, Nothing
personal, Alex, but Little Danny is the cutest little four-year-old
you&apos;ve ever seen in your life.

Alex chuckled, waving off the current joking.

More seriously, Karissa asked for a completely paved driveway.

Yes, please, Megan seconded, whining, my poor shoes!

Since when are Ellen Tracy&apos;s &apos;poor&apos; shoes? Alex kidded.

Megan looked down, embarrassed at having a pair of the designer shoes
and yet proud that someone had noticed, considering she&apos;d cut back on
her grocery budget and cut out entertainment for a couple of months to
save the money to get them.

We can do that, Alex replied.

What about a conference room? Daniel asked. We need that
desperately. With our increased staff size, we need a decent
place to gather together and brainstorm or discuss matters.

... as well to meet with our clients, Megan pointed out. She
chuckled, When Abayomi and Yazid come to town, sometimes they bring
seven to ten other staff with them. They aren&apos;t real happy when
they have to crowd into our small offices.

Good point, Jack acknowledged.

Grinning from ear to ear, the designer unrolled another drawing,
stating, We&apos;ll do it the same way we do the upper floor of the house,
only over the garage. It will actually be done first, so it&apos;s out
of the way when the larger modules are lifted into place.

The plans showed a large conference room, with an extension jutting out
to the one side for a beverage center, complete with microwave and coffee maker. The other side had two unisex restrooms, one
handicap accessible, one not, and a small vanity compartment with two
sinks and a large mirror with lighting for checking and applying
make-up, or simply combing one&apos;s hair.

Alex elaborated, The times when the conference room will be filled to
capacity are rare, but when it is, the vanity area will help alleviate
the need to have separate men&apos;s and women&apos;s restrooms. By sheer
practicality, the larger facility will be the women&apos;s, but it is not
written on the doors. Each can be used by either gender since the
doors do have locks.

Any comments or questions? Alex asked.

I&apos;m wondering how anyone who is handicapped would get to the second
floor? Megan put forth. I&apos;ve been thinking about poor Ty. He&apos;s going to be on crutches for a while yet.

Alex smiled, answering, Good question. See this little square
right here? When everyone nodded, he explained, It&apos;s an
elevator!

No way! Megan chuckled. I thought it was a closet.

Daniel inquired, Don&apos;t elevators have to have big counterweights and a
shaft for them to rise and fall in?

Not anymore, the designer responded. Nowadays, just the space
of a closet about three-and-a-half feet square will do the job nicely.

I&apos;m impressed, Megan commented.

I like the way the conference room connects to the lounge, Karissa
interjected.

Alex nodded, saying, It makes sense to tie the two spaces
together. After a pause, he asked, Anything else?

Isn&apos;t that enough? Jack mused, silently figuring out the price tag
for the entire thing.

Ignoring the general, Alex moved forward, saying, Okay, here&apos;s the deal. If we go forward and don&apos;t make any last-minute changes ... he stared at Jack and Daniel, both of whom sank a few inches in their seats, we can be finished and have J-O moved back in, up and running at full speed two weeks from Monday morning, 8 a.m. sharp. For that to happen, I need to start making phone calls by noon today. It&apos;s now 10 a.m.

Geez, Alex, nothing like putting the pressure on us, is there, old
buddy, Jack replied.

Jack, you called me, remember? I have worked on nothing else
since after your call on Tuesday evening. I&apos;ve rearranged and put
off commitments to be here and to pull this off, the designer stated.

Thank you, Alex. We really do appreciate it, Daniel
interjected. Uh, can you give us a brief summary of what would
happen when, he requested.

Of course, the designer stated, pulling over a notepad on which he
had previously prepared a summary. He made a couple of additional
notations based on the conversation that had occurred during the
meeting, and then he presented the outline to the group. This
may be more than you want to know, so please feel free to stop me if I
get too detailed.

You? Jack questioned with big eyes. Talk too much? Alex,
surely, you jest.

Did I mention my bill just went up again? the standing man asked.

Jack simply nodded, not even bothering to look at his husband whom he
knew was glaring at him.

What&apos;s first? Daniel finally inquired.

As soon as we&apos;re done here, I&apos;m going to call the manufacturer of the
prefab modules and tell them the order is a definite go. I&apos;ll
have the crew auger the holes for the support columns to support the
second floor. We&apos;ll set the form for the driveway as well as the
crawl space for the extension to the front.

You sent them the plans already? Jack asked incredulously.

The crews are ready to go? Megan asked at the same time, her surprise
evident as she glanced over at Jack and smiled.

Alex grinned, saying, I told them when we needed the modules, and they
insisted on seeing what they were getting into. Fortunately, it&apos;s
pretty straightforward construction, nothing elaborate, and they&apos;ll
have them ready.

Wow! Karissa exclaimed.

Gordon and Garrett are aware of Jack and Daniel&apos;s M.O. They&apos;ve
been on standby all day.

That&apos;ll cost us, Jack muttered.

Knowing it was exactly what the couple wanted, the suave and confident
man continued, saying, On Saturday, they will pour the driveway and
crawl space, plus set the columns for second floor. Sunday, we&apos;ll
need to do some preparation for Monday when the real construction gets
going.

I can&apos;t believe you can do this so fast, Karissa commented, shaking
her head in disbelief.

Money talks, Jack quipped.

Yes, it does, Alex affirmed. Most of the extra money is going
into double and triple crews working practically around the clock.

That&apos;ll cost us, Jack muttered again, his comment going completely
ignored by everyone.

As I was saying, Alex continued. On Monday, we&apos;ll finish the
basement waterproofing, install the new furnace and A/C system, and
pour the slab for the atrium area. The next day, the new bath
fixtures will be installed, we&apos;ll upgrade electrical and plumbing,
build the cabinet for the plotter, build the new stairs, and create the
beverage center. Wednesday is a cleanup day, though we&apos;ll start
the siding on the lower level. Dumpsters will be brought in on
Thursday.

The roof? Jack deduced.

Exactly, the designer confirmed. The initial inspections will
be done that day as well. On Friday and Saturday, the roof will
be removed, and then on Sunday, we&apos;ll prepare for the prefab
installation. The next day, the prefabs go up and will be
fastened to the first floor. We&apos;ll raise the roofs and join the
marriage walls.

Do we get cake? Jack teased.

You&apos;ll get it someplace you don&apos;t want it, Jack, if you don&apos;t let Alex
get through this, Daniel advised.

That sounds promising, Jack replied seductively.

Alex, please, Daniel stated with a nod for the man to continue. **Keep it up, O&apos;Neill, and cake is the only thing you&apos;ll be getting a
piece of.**

Immediately, Jack focused on Alex like he was speaking the wisdom of
the ages.

That takes us to Tuesday when we&apos;ll side the ends of the second floor
and put the glass in the atrium. The plumbing and electrical
connections for the second floor will be completed and we&apos;ll add the
railings over atrium as well. On Wednesday, we&apos;ll enclose the
front of the house, do the interior finish on the enclosure, and
install the central vac. The next day we paint the interior, lay
down the carpet, and install the crown molding.

We&apos;re up to Friday, right? Megan asked, taking notes just for the
heck of it.

Correct, Alex answered. That&apos;s when we do the landscaping of
the front yard and remove the dumpsters. Over the weekend, we&apos;ll
place the furniture, hang the pictures, make the necessary computer
connections, and you guys can prepare for a return to business on
Monday.

So we&apos;re definitely going to have to shut down for two weeks? Daniel
stated as a question.

Daniel, if you want to remain open, we can slow the pace ... Alex
began.

No! Jack interrupted forcefully. No way. If we&apos;re going
to do this, we&apos;re going to bite the bullet and get it done as quickly
as possible.

If you want, after Monday on week two, the downstairs offices could be
available, but I wouldn&apos;t advise it, Alex commented.

Noise, all four J-O representatives spoke in unison, causing a brief
breakout of laughter.

Excuse us, Jack requested, nodding at Daniel who followed him to the
back corner of the room. Quietly, he asked, Danny, should
we? It&apos;s not the money, it&apos;s the commitment we&apos;re making here,
not to mention the sudden downtime. I&apos;d like a little time to
think about this.

I don&apos;t think we have a choice. One more day like Tuesday, and
Megan is out of here, Daniel replied.

She wouldn&apos;t leave, Jack spoke confidently.

Maybe not, but, Jack, we&apos;ve prided ourselves on J-O being the best it
can be. Not one of our employees has quit, Jack. Even Dora is
staying, and archaeology is about as far away from dance as you can
get, the archaeologist observed.

They love working for us, Jack said a bit cockily.

Yes, they do, but that&apos;s not enough to keep all of them around
indefinitely. We have some wonderful employees, Jack, and I don&apos;t
want to lose any of them, Daniel stated. Pausing for a moment,
he sighed, his mind considering all of their options. We have a
responsibility to them to make sure they have a proper working
environment, the younger man eventually opined.

I ... Jack began.

Daniel teased, What? Is the great General Jack Jackson-O&apos;Neill
wavering? Seeing his lover smile, he continued, Jack, we&apos;ve
placed the burden on the day-to-day operation of J-O in Megan&apos;s
hands. Have you paid attention to how both she and Karissa have
been responding to Alex&apos;s ideas? Listen, we&apos;ve kept J-O close to
us because it&apos;s convenient *for us*. We owe them not just a good
emotional workplace, but a good physical environment as well, not to
mention proper office equipment.

Kinko&apos;s, Jack said, nodding.

Exactly. We aren&apos;t there eight to ten hours, five or six days a
week to really see this, and ... and Megan and Karissa have quietly
borne the brunt of our ignorance.

We owe them, Jack stated seriously.

We owe them, Daniel concurred.

Turning around, Jack smiled and said, Alex, you have a go.

Megan and Karissa smiled brightly as they gave tiny nods of approval to
their employers.

Ah, one minute, Daniel said, raising up his left hand with a finger
pointed in the air.

Megan&apos;s and Karissa&apos;s smiles faded, afraid their remodeling was about
to be vetoed.

Jack, Alex needs to start now, so we have another choice to make about
what to do over the next sixteen days, Daniel stated.

We could rent space somewhere, Jack suggested.

Megan, Daniel called out. Seeing her look up, he asked, Do we
have crucial deadlines coming up?

Just the Peters project, Megan replied. We&apos;ve personally
assured Mrs. Peters that the job will be done as scheduled.

Bibi&apos;s working on that, right? Daniel inquired.

Yes, she is, Megan affirmed. She&apos;s leaving for Baltimore
tomorrow morning, and the deadline is Wednesday.

Okay, well ... just a minute, Daniel said, returning to his private
conversation with Jack. Jack, let&apos;s give the in-house crew two
weeks off with pay.

What? Jack asked in a raised voice, attracting the attention of the
other three people in the room.

Jack, the expense of renting an office and moving all of our equipment
is worse than ... Daniel began.

You&apos;re right, Jack agreed, once the shock had left his body.

All I&apos;m saying is that we really don&apos;t have to shut down completely
the entire time. Those in the field can continue to do their
jobs. They can rent space at Kinko&apos;s or work with some of our
colleagues to get the reports filed on time. I know we can&apos;t do
that for all the projects, but the fewer clients we have to disappoint,
the better, the archaeologist remarked.

I agree, Jack stated. So, we give the in-house folks a little
vacation during week one, and in week two, we bring them back and try
to do as much catch up as we can.

Exactly, Daniel spoke quietly. It may not be totally fair to
the field workers, but we&apos;re going to lose some money with this,
Jack. We didn&apos;t plan on this.

Maybe we can give the field workers a few days later in the year, as a
thank you for the extra efforts they are going to have to make over the
next two weeks to get their reports processed and filed, the older man
suggested.

Sounds equitable, Daniel agreed. Motioning towards the others,
he led Jack back to the table where he instructed, Megan, Karissa,
we&apos;re giving the in-house workers a full week off with pay. Reschedule what you have to, but let&apos;s keep as many of our assignments
on schedule as possible.

We&apos;re keeping the field archaeologists working? Megan asked curiously.

Yes. Have them use Kinko&apos;s or whatever facilities they have
to. Have Bibi work with Hunter Sutton if she needs to use their
facilities. Uh, authorize any expenditures in advance so she
doesn&apos;t run into problems. Do the same with the others, within
reason. Reschedule anything internal. That second week is
going to be the toughest. See if you can find a space we can use
for a week or maybe everyone can work at their homes. Ask some
questions, see where we stand after you review the calendar, and get
back to us tomorrow, if not sooner. We don&apos;t want to lose two
full weeks.

Do the security thing in the office after you make the calls, Jack
added, referring to their normal procedures for whenever their office
would be vacated for more than a weekend.

Make sure to back everything up before you leave for the day, Daniel
added. He looked over at Alex and said, We need you to give
Megan and Karissa a couple of hours to secure things before you go
on. Megan?

We&apos;ll need about three hours, Megan replied, looking over at
Alex. After that time, we may still be finishing up with
proposals due today or tomorrow, but it&apos;ll be okay for you and ...
whomever to be in the office.

Karissa added, Daniel, I think you need to contact a couple of the
clients yourself. There are a couple of jobs I know we won&apos;t be
able to get to without access to our files and equipment.

Donaldson, Megan sighed.

Karissa nodded, looked at Jack and Daniel, and inquired, Will you be
by the office?

We&apos;ll drop by in an hour, Jack answered for his husband.

Okay, Daniel said, smiling. Megan will have a set of keys for
you and the security code for the office as well when you meet her
there later.

After finishing up their details, the meeting-goers left, all having
plenty they needed to accomplish for the day.

====

And where are you three off to? Jack asked two days later, stopping the Munchkins as they headed for the backyard on a pleasant Saturday afternoon.

We&apos;re just going outside, Dad, Jonny answered as he looked up at his
father with an innocent expression.

After nodding and with wide grins, the triplets bolted outside to where Jennifer was already playing with Jenny and Ricky.

~Okay, Munchkins, Spitfires, and Jen are outside, Bri and Jeff are at Little League, David&apos;s upstairs doing his homework, and Danny is picking up Noa and Lulu from dance class. Yep, all children accounted for.~

Heading into the kitchen to make a start on dinner, Jack had just
pulled out some vegetables when he heard the front door open and two
excited voices getting louder by the minute.

Dad, guess what? Chenoa asked. The little girl was first into
the kitchen, though Lulu was hot on her heels. We&apos;re giving a
recital, she blurted out without giving Jack a chance to guess.

All the classes are doing something different, Lulu added excitedly.

Chenoa chimed, We get to choose which we want to do, and I&apos;m going to
be in the tap and modern dance group.

Lulu beamed as she stated, And I&apos;m going to be in the ballet and jazz
group.

Let&apos;s go tell the others, Chenoa suggested, grabbing Lulu&apos;s arm.

Without even waiting to see their father&apos;s reaction, the two were out
the door and running into the backyard. A rather stunned Jack
looked up to see his amused soulmate leaning against the counter. Walking over to Daniel, Jack kissed him and pulled him into an
embrace. He sighed with contentment as Daniel nuzzled his neck.

As they enjoyed the warmth of each other, the lovers could hear the
enthusiastic chatter from the backyard.

Jack couldn&apos;t help but chuckle, I take it that they&apos;re a little
excited?

Daniel laughed, To coin a phrase, ya think? After more chuckles
at his usage of Jack&apos;s often-used phrase, he added, They haven&apos;t
stopped talking about it.

The two stood there for a while, just enjoying being in each other&apos;s
arms when they heard rising voices, this time with a note of panic in
them.

The two men were heading for the backyard even before Aislinn came
running in to fetch them, yelling, Dad, Daddy, come quick, it&apos;s Little
Danny.

The couple ran into the backyard to see Jennifer holding Little Danny in her
lap, talking to him and rubbing soothing circles on his back. As
they drew closer, they could hear the small boy wheezing.

Jen, what happened? Jack asked urgently.

I don&apos;t know. He just fell down and started making noises,
Jennifer answered.

Son, Jack asked kneeling down. What&apos;s wrong?

Jack, maybe I should call Sylvia, Daniel suggested, already beginning
to head for the house.

No call Doctor Syl, Daddy! Little Danny stated firmly. How&apos;d I
do, Ash?

Aislinn giggled, You did good, Little Danny.

Jonny added, You&apos;re a good actor, Little Danny.

Jack stared at the little boy, not sure if he wanted to kill him or
laugh at the prank. Likewise, Daniel stared at the little boy,
wondering if grounding him for life would be unreasonable.

Ricky and Jenny applauded while Jennifer looked as confounded as her
parents.

You little brat, Jennifer accused, getting up quickly, resulting in
Little Danny bouncing onto the grass. I was scared stiff, and
you were playing? she asked in a raised voice.

We&apos;re acting! Jonny stated proudly.

I&apos;m going to be a star, Aislinn announced with a coy smile, sounding very much like a little diva.

Little Danny added, I win a quarter!

Excuse me? Daniel asked.

Jonny didn&apos;t think I could do it, the little boy explained. He
turned to face his brother. You owe me a quarter, Jonny. Let&apos;s go get it from your piggy bank.

I&apos;ll pay you later, Jonny responded.

Na-huh. You pay me now, Little Danny insisted.

But ... Jonny started to argue.

Wait one minute, Daniel interjected sternly, glaring at the
Munchkins. It didn&apos;t escape his attention that the twins had
moved over by Jennifer at that moment. Let me see if I
understand what just happened.

Little Danny leaned over and whispered to Jonny, We&apos;re in
trouble. Daddy has general eyes.

Jonny gulped, nodded, and inched closer to his brother.

Daniel asked as calmly as he could, So, you decided to see if you
could pretend to be sick and fool Dad and me?

Little Danny mulled over the question and finally answered, Yes.

Okay, well, pretending to be sick is not a good thing, so I want you
both to go to your room and think about how you&apos;d feel if Dad or I
pretended to be sick, but really weren&apos;t, Daniel told them.

Daddy, it was my idea, Aislinn confessed.

But we agreed, Ash, Jonny said.

Yeah, we thought it would be funny, Little Danny agreed.

Jack said, Do you think Jennifer thought it was funny?

The Munchkins shook their heads, and then as one, ran over to their
sister, throwing their little arms around her legs.

We&apos;re sorry, Jen, all three said at the same time.

Well, that&apos;s okay, the teenager responded in a forgiving tone, having
softened with the realization it had all been a joke.

I &apos;specially sorry, Little Danny said, looking up at her. Just
wanted to see if I could act.

You can, Jennifer assured the little boy, nodding as she talked.

All three of you go upstairs, now! Daniel ordered. Dad and I
will be up shortly.

They&apos;re in big trouble, Chenoa whispered to Lulu, who immediately
nodded and was glad they hadn&apos;t ever decided to do something like that.

The Munchkins did as they were told while Jack told the other children
to continue playing.

Dad, Daddy, are you going to punish them? Jennifer inquired.

We should ground them for eternity, Jack stated. I think they
took ten years off my life.

Jennifer chuckled softly as she asked, Didn&apos;t you ever do that to your
parents, Dad?

That&apos;s beside the point. Seeing Jennifer&apos;s challenging look, Jack answered, I was them then. I thought it was funny, too.

Daniel closed his eyes and took a deep breath as he spoke, Gawd, they
were just playing. Maybe we&apos;re making too much of it, Jack.

They&apos;re kids, and they&apos;re good kids, but they&apos;re still kids, Jennifer
said wisely as she smiled, walking away to play with the twins a minute
later.

Danny, was she trying to tell us something? the silver-gray haired
man asked.

Yes.

Tell me, Jack insisted.

Daniel simply looked at his lover and smiled when Jack sighed.

Come on, Love. We have some Munchkins we need to talk to,
Daniel stated as he took his husband&apos;s hand and led him into the house.

**Are we going to punish them, Danny?**

**No, but we are going to talk this through with them and maybe remind
them of the &apos;Boy Who Cried Wolf&apos; story.**

A minute later, the two men were standing in the boys&apos; bedroom, looking
into three sad looking faces. Daniel sat down on one of the beds
and gestured for Jonny and Little Danny to join him while Jack scooped
up Aislinn and sat with her on the opposite bed.

We really sorry, Daddy, Dad, Little Danny apologized as he looked up
at his parents with soulful blue eyes.

Jonny nodded vigorously, and Aislinn sniffled as she did the same.
 
I know you&apos;re sorry, Munchkins, and I&apos;m glad that you know what you
did was wrong, but I think we need to have a little talk about things
that it&apos;s never okay to lie about, Daniel admonished gently.

And that isn&apos;t to say that it&apos;s okay to lie, because it&apos;s not, Jack
interjected.

The older man couldn&apos;t understand why his husband had just winced until Little Danny scrunched his nose in thought and asked, But sometimes it is, Dad. You told me it would have been okay to lie when I told Mrs. Grimshaw the truth that time.

Jack shuddered at the memory. He had taken the Munchkins and some
other homeschoolers to an education day at the zoo. One of the
other parents had kindly provided some snacks which had been received
happily, until the kids tasted them.

 //Flashback//
Aislinn refused the sandwiches, but took a cup of lemonade. Jonny
and Little Danny happily took a sandwich each and bit into them. Jack watched as their expressions froze. He saw Jonny bend down
and pretend to fiddle with his shoelace, carefully spitting out his
mouthful and wrapping it in his hanky.

~You are way too good at Special Ops, Jonny,~ Jack thought as the
little boy carefully hid the rest of the sandwich in the handkerchief
as well and then inched his way over to a nearby trash bin.

Danny, don&apos;t you like my sandwiches? the woman asked.

The concerned tones of the maker of the sandwiches, Leonora Grimshaw,
drew Jack&apos;s attention back to Little Danny.

Little Danny grimaced as he swallowed his mouthful and then hesitated
before admitting in a soft voice, No, Ma&apos;am.

Oh, you don&apos;t like chicken sandwiches? the woman inquired.

Jack frowned, knowing there must be something funny about the
sandwiches since Little Danny liked chicken sandwiches quite a lot.

Little Danny looked puzzled as he asked, Are you sure they were
chicken sandwiches? They didn&apos;t taste like chicken. They
tasted kinda like Mittens&apos; and Calico&apos;s cat food smells.
//End Flashback//
 
 Jack shuddered again at the memory and saw Daniel trying to hide a
smile. 

**It wasn&apos;t funny, Danny!**

**I agree, but according to Jerry&apos;s mother, Mrs. Grimshaw has stopped
making chicken sandwiches.**

Jack sighed as he refocused on the current situation, explaining, Son,
I know it&apos;s not easy to understand, but there is a difference between
not hurting someone&apos;s feelings on little things and playing a very bad
joke that causes people to think you&apos;re sick or hurt.

How do we know the difference, Dad? Aislinn asked in confusion.

Jack looked at Daniel who answered, Well, here&apos;s a good test. Put yourself in the other person&apos;s shoes. Let&apos;s say that while
we&apos;re talking now, Lulu ran in and told us that Noa was sick. We
all got up and ran to their bedroom. Noa&apos;s on the bed, making
funny sounds. Then, all of a sudden, she gets up and
laughs. How would you feel?

Little Danny sighed, I wouldn&apos;t like it. I&apos;d be scared.

Exactly, Daniel answered. Dad and I were very, very scared
after Ash came in and got us.

Let&apos;s try another situation, Jack offered. Mrs. Valissi brings
over a surprise, a new shirt for Ash. It&apos;s something she&apos;s sewed
herself, and she says she spent a long time working on it. Ash
opens up the box and sees the shirt. It&apos;s lime.

Ewww, Ash said, lime being one of her least favorite colors.

And it has a big red apple on it, Jack continued, knowing that the
littlest Munchkin wasn&apos;t a fan of clothing with food pictured on them.

Ash, are you going to go &apos;ewwww&apos; in front of Mrs. V? If you do,
how is she going to feel? Jack asked.

Daniel added, And before you answer, you need to decide something very
important. Is a little fib going to hurt more than the
truth? And think about this ... can you be thankful for the gift
without lying? Think hard. Sometimes, you don&apos;t need to
lie.

Aislinn thought for a minute and then she answered, I&apos;d thank Mrs.
Valissi for liking me and making me a present. I don&apos;t have to
say I love it, do I?

No, you don&apos;t, Daniel answered. So, did you lie?

No. I smile because I love Mrs. Valissi. Suddenly,
Aislinn smiled and added, I&apos;d even wear it ... once, because she made
it for me!

That&apos;s our girl, Jack responded, smiling.

Little Danny nodded and stated, I should have told Mrs. Grimshaw that
she was nice to make us sandwiches.

But, Dad, Jonny interrupted. That woman asked Little Danny if
he liked chicken sandwiches. He does.

Yes, but he didn&apos;t have to tell her that hers tasted like cat food,
Jack pointed out.

The conversation continued for a while, with the parents trying to help
the children sort out the rights and wrongs of little white lies, and,
preferably, how to never lie and yet still be able to get out of
embarrassing moments such as the one that had occurred with Mrs.
Grimshaw.

Okay, Daniel said at the end of the talk. Now, about this
desire to act.

It was fun, Little Danny confessed, although he had a repentant look
on his face still.

Acting is fine, Daniel opined. But there&apos;s a time and a place
for it.

Jonny gasped as a light exploded in his mind, and he said, We could
put on a show. Little Danny, you be the star.

We can all be the stars. We&apos;ll all do it. Come on, Little
Danny responded excitedly as he climbed down off the bed. He
stopped quickly, though, and turned back around, asking, Can we go
talk to the brood about doing a show?

Sure, go on, Daniel answered. With the triplets gone, the
lovers moved to sit together. Do you think they&apos;ll really put on
a show?

Jack chuckled, Maybe some little song and dance routine for us behind
a blanket for the stage curtain. Nah, they&apos;ll forget about it in
a day or two.

Daniel just sighed, his mind not really on a potential stage
production. Quietly, the two sat together, just trying to let the
calm of the moment relax them.

I could have killed him, Jack admitted a couple of minutes later.

Jen&apos;s right, Babe. We have great kids, but they are still going
to make choices that aren&apos;t always the best. It&apos;s especially hard
when they are all so bright. Daniel sighed thoughtfully, It&apos;s
easy to forget that they are still children and adolescents. We&apos;re their parents, and we have to help them understand when they make
a bad choice.

And not necessarily to ground them for every bad choice, Jack added,
though his tone was a bit hesitant.

Daniel chuckled, They were playing, and they made an innocent
mistake. They didn&apos;t break any of our rules, Jack.

Jack nodded his agreement, but added, It&apos;s a good thing my hair is
already gray, thanks to you.

Jack! Daniel said, laughing. It&apos;s silver -- silver gray. Gawd, I love you.

The lovers kissed, and then Jack teased, You just love my hair.

That&apos;s true, Daniel retaliated, getting up and walking out.

Hey! Jack was taken aback. Finally, he got up and called
out, Hey!

Hearing his lover&apos;s laughter, Jack took off after the man who was his
heart.

====

The next morning, the Jackson-O&apos;Neill children were busy working out the details of their first show.

We can do a dance recital, Chenoa suggested enthusiastically as Lulu
nodded her agreement.

I&apos;m not doing no dance thing, Jonny said firmly. Let&apos;s do a
dem&apos;stration of T&apos;s self-defense moves. Whaddya think, Little
Danny?

Little Danny was staring into space, a dreamy look on his face, when he
responded, We could write our own play and make parts for all of
us. Lulu and Noa can dance between the scenes.

David began chattering spiritedly, exclaiming, I know! We could
make it a historical play about Ancient Egypt or Medieval England, or
maybe the time of the Mayflower. We could all write it, or Little
Danny and I could write it.

Jennifer, Jeff, and Brianna exchanged looks of agreement about the
proposal, the oldest of them vocalizing, You and Little Danny can
write it, David.

Jonny sighed, looking torn between wanting to praise Little Danny&apos;s
idea and wanting to go with his own idea.

We can put in a battle scene just for you, Jonny. You can be the
battle commander, Little Danny told his brother.

Jonny grinned, jumped up, and raced out of the room, shouting, Great
idea, Little Danny. I&apos;m gonna go practice.

Hey, what&apos;s going on in here? Daniel asked, ducking out of the way as
Johnny dashed by.

Daddy, we going to do play! Jenny announced brightly.

A play? Daniel asked, not expecting that piece of news. ~I
thought they&apos;d forget about it like Jack said.~ Inwardly sighing,
he mused, ~Apparently not.~

Little Danny and I are going to write about something historical,
David explained.

I&apos;ll make the costumes. I&apos;m sure Mrs. Valissi will help me,
Jennifer said eagerly.

Daddy, when can we put on our play? Aislinn asked energetically.

Uh, well, Daniel responded, reaching into his pocket for his digital
calendar. He pressed a few buttons, flipping through the days,
while the children waited. You need time to organize, so we
should wait a couple of weeks. There&apos;s Friday the ...

No Fridays, Jenny said.

Why not? Daniel inquired.

Daniel was surprised to see so many &apos;oh, please&apos; and &apos;you&apos;ve got to be
kidding&apos; expressions on his children&apos;s faces.

It&apos;s your date night! Chenoa chastised.

Oh, so it is, Daniel replied with a slight chuckle. How about
that next Saturday then?

What date is that, Daddy? David asked, knowing there was an upcoming
activity with the Adventure Guides that he didn&apos;t want to miss.

The twentieth, Daniel answered.

David smiled, relieved that there wouldn&apos;t be a conflict. He was
sure that would give them enough time to write the play, make the
costumes, design the scenery, and give their intended audience a chance
to plan on attending.

Works for me, Jennifer said. How about it, brood?

The brood continued to chat away for another hour about their ideas as
Daniel watched and encouraged them appropriately.

====

Jack, Daniel called out to his husband, who was in the study.

I&apos;m not done with the analysis yet, Danny, Jack said, assuming his
lover had come to check on his progress reviewing a survey report just
submitted by one of their employees in the field.

No rush, Babe. Our field employees are paying the bills this
week, Daniel mused.

Jack chuckled, It&apos;s a good thing we didn&apos;t have fifty employees to
worry about.

Yeah, Daniel replied. Anyway, just wanted to let you know I&apos;m
going out for about an hour or so; I have some shopping to do.

We just did the shopping, Jack said, leaning back in the very
comfortable deluxe desk chair his lover had gifted him with several
years ago.

Daniel chuckled, Not for these items. You were wrong.

Me? Wrong? Jack replied in a shocked manner, though he looked
down, twiddling his pen in his hands as he tried not to laugh at
himself.

The archaeologist chuckled, saying, Yeah, imagine that. Anyway,
our children have decided to put on a play in a couple of weeks.

A play? a bemused Jack asked. So they didn&apos;t forget about it.

No, they didn&apos;t. Actually, uh, it&apos;s quite the opposite. They&apos;re very excited about it, so I thought I&apos;d take Bri and Jeff to a
couple of places to get some scenery supplies. By the way, your
pottery skills might be needed, the younger man spoke with a twinkle
in his eyes.

Pottery? Why? a puzzled Jack inquired.

I&apos;m not sure; something about having things to break, Daniel
teased. He leaned down and kissed Jack. Love you.

Love you, too, Angel, Jack lovingly intoned, smiling as Daniel left
the study. Breaking things? Hey!

====

That&apos;s perfect, Jen! Brianna said late the following morning about the invitations Jennifer had prepared. The teenager was good at calligraphy, and her skill was showing in the beautifully written invites. I&apos;ll go ask Dad if he can take us around to deliver them.

Thanks, Bri.

Jennifer, Brianna, and Aislinn had been working on the handmade invitations, deciding what they would say and how they would look. They finally decided on invitations made of heavy cream paper festooned with glitter and colorful ribbons. Jennifer wrote them all personally, while Brianna affixed the glitter, and Aislinn attached the ribbons and drew at least one little butterfly on each. She loved butterflies.

The trio was also given the task of deciding who to invite. Brianna printed out the list on the computer, and Aislinn helped to
check them off as each invite was sealed.

The guest list included several of their neighbors and all of their
family of friends. Jack and Daniel had also quietly given
Jennifer the obligation of making sure the children didn&apos;t get too
carried away, especially after Ricky suggested inviting President Hayes.

Let&apos;s use some discretion, Jen, Jack had suggested when told of the
guest list at that point in time, making sure the teenager
appropriately derailed the idea of inviting the leader of the nation.

The trio of girls had worked hard on the invitations, starting after lunch the day before and finishing them this morning. They were all happy with the results.

====

Danny, I&apos;ll be back in about six hours, Jack laughed a few minutes later.

Daniel looked up from his desk in the den and turned his chair around
as he asked, Where are you going?

I&apos;ve been shanghaied into chauffeur and invitation delivery duty, the
older man explained.

Oh, well, I&apos;ll have dinner waiting, Daniel chuckled, looking at the
clock and seeing it was just a few minutes after eleven in the morning.

You are the perfect househusband, Babe, biscuits in the oven and buns
in bed. Keep them both warm, Jack quipped seductively, moving
over for a kiss. Bri and Ash are going with me. Jeff&apos;s
watching the brood, and Jen&apos;s gone over to Mrs. V&apos;s to work on the
costumes.

Okay, Babe, and you keep your buns ... and other parts warm, too,
Daniel shyly requested.

I love you, Jack chuckled as he began to walk out.

Love you, too, Daniel replied, smiling as he returned to his work.

====

Poor Stephen. He wasn&apos;t very good at being a king, Little Danny
lamented as David wrote, &apos;THE END&apos; on the last piece of paper.

After a few phone consultations with their Aunt Sara, given her
background in teaching and her love of history, and a lot of time on
the computer doing research, David and Little Danny had finally
finished the outline of their script. They&apos;d decided to write
about the English Civil War of the twelfth century as it seemed to have
something for everyone. There were female characters for the
girls, lots of fighting scenes for Jonny, and plenty of scope for the
costumes to be as lavish or simple as they felt like making them.

David ruffled his little brother&apos;s hair, saying, You&apos;re right. Stephen wasn&apos;t suited to be king, but England wasn&apos;t ready for a female
monarch back then. Let&apos;s show the others the script and work out
our parts.

Little Danny&apos;s photographic memory had come in handy, as had Sara&apos;s knowledge of English history, in preparing the outline. They&apos;d worked all afternoon yesterday and all day today on laying down the basic plot and deciding what characters to use.

Once everyone chose their characters and saw what the budding authors had come up with, the others could start on the sets and wardrobe while the boys took a couple of days to complete their script. Sara had even promised to drop by and help them since they wanted the details of the play and its plot to be as much of a surprise as possible to their parents.

Immediately, Little Danny brightened and raced out of the study towards
the rec room, yelling for the family to gather together.

Son, no yelling, Jack said in a light reprimand.

I&apos;m sorry, but we finished the script, Little Danny told his father
while the other children gathered in the rec room.

Joining them, David clarified, We finished the outline for the play,
Dad. It&apos;s going to be awesome!

====

With the brood congregated in the rec room and their fathers barred
from their current activity, the children continued their preparations
for the play.

What&apos;s the story about, David? Give us a synopsis, Jennifer
asked her brother as she began reading a copy of the outline that she&apos;d
gotten from David.

What&apos;s a snop&apos;is? Ricky asked as he scrunched his nose, looking
confused.

Jennifer answered, It&apos;s a summary, Ricky, and the word is
synopsis. Little Danny and David can give us the basic idea of
what happens in the play they&apos;re writing for us.

Little Danny grinned and excitedly began babbling, It starts way back
in 1135 with the death of the old king, Henry the First. Henry
doesn&apos;t have any children, except Matilda &apos;cause his only son died in a
shipwreck. He made his barons swear their loyalty to Matilda, but
when he died, they didn&apos;t really want a woman as their queen ...

Typical, Brianna snorted in disgust.

Little Danny frowned at his sister&apos;s interruption, responding,
&apos;Twasn&apos;t really their fault, Bri; that was just the way it was back
then.

Brianna nodded, and the little boy smiled at her and then continued his
breathless explanation of the story.

Stephen is made king, but Matilda and her husband aren&apos;t happy about
that, and then Stephen&apos;s too nice, and his barons take advantage of
him, and law broke down and then Matilda&apos;s half brother fought to get
her crown in 1138, and civil war broke out. Lotsa fighting
scenes, Jonny, Little Danny told his brother.
 
Jonny grinned and high-fived his little brother.

Who won, Little Danny? Jenny huffed, impatient for the story to end.

No one really, Little Danny admitted.

Ricky frowned, saying, That&apos;s dumb, Little Danny. Gotta have a
winner.

Sometimes, there just isn&apos;t a clear winner, Ricky, David
answered. He explained, Stephen won in that he kept the crown,
but Matilda won in that she got her son recognized as Stephen&apos;s
heir. After Stephen died, Matilda&apos;s son, Henry, got the throne
and became Henry the second.

Jeff noticed that Ricky didn&apos;t seem convinced and figured a distraction
might be helpful. He looked down at his copy of the outline,
studying the various characters in the play.

Let&apos;s decide on the parts, Jeff suggested. We&apos;ve got the narrator, who&apos;s writing the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle; Henry the first -- that&apos;s a really small part; Matilda; her husband, Geoffrey of Anjou; Stephen; Matilda&apos;s half brother, Robert; Henry fitzEmpress, who becomes Henry the second; and Eustace, Stephen&apos;s son. Then there are minor characters like soldier number one and so on. So who wants to do what?

Jeff&apos;s distraction worked like a charm as various voices cried out
their choice.

Jonny should be Robert or Stephen &apos;cause they do the most fighting,
Little Danny said firmly.

Jonny eagerly nodded his assent to that.
 
====

Jack and Daniel walked arm in arm to their sofa and sat down, each man
wearing a smile. They&apos;d just checked in on the brood as they were
discussing their play, watching covertly for a few minutes as the
children negotiated parts and began working on a timeline to follow to
make sure everything was done in time for the big night. After
being discovered, the couple had been chastised for eavesdropping and
then shooed away by their offspring.

Our children, the thespians, Daniel chuckled, leaning his head
against Jack&apos;s shoulder.

They work well together, Jack observed as he rubbed Daniel&apos;s hand
which he held in his.

Jack, I&apos;m not sure they can get everything done. Maybe we ...

Maybe we shouldn&apos;t, Jack interrupted. Danny, this is their
show. We could easily make it perfect, but that&apos;s not the idea.

Daniel sighed, I know you&apos;re right. They obviously want to work
on this by themselves. He paused thoughtfully, and then smiled
as he opined, They&apos;ll be great.

They&apos;ll be fantastic! Jack countered enthusiastically.

The lovers laughed as they snuggled, both eager to see how their
children handled the pressure of putting on a stage show.

====

You&apos;re doing fine, Jen, Mrs. Valissi said encouragingly the next day.

The senior citizen was helping Jennifer to plan the costumes, but the
teenager was a bit frazzled at the moment.

I&apos;m making this too complicated, aren&apos;t I, Grandma Sophia? the
teenager sighed as she fidgeted with a row of delicate white lace.

With a warm smile, but taking advantage of the question, the woman
wisely responded, We only have a few days, Dear, and many costumes to
prepare. Think simple, and think about the power of
illusion. Do you really need all that lace, or is there a way to
achieve the look without all that intricate stitching?

Well, I don&apos;t know. Do I? Jennifer asked innocently.

Mrs. Valissi continued to smile as she answered, Costumes are all
about illusion, Jennifer. They are seen for only brief moments,
and the focus is on the actors. Costumes can be much more
dramatic than everyday garments, and they aren&apos;t subject to close-up
scrutiny, so you can get by with construction shortcuts that you&apos;d
never use in something you were actually going to wear on the street.

Jennifer nodded in understanding as she replied, Illusion is
good. You really sound like you know what you are talking
about. Will you help me?

Of course, Jennifer, the friendly neighbor agreed. Let&apos;s take
another look at the costumes you need to make and see what we really
need, and, yes, I&apos;ve whipped up a *few* costumes in my day.

I bet you&apos;ve made some wonderful costumes before, Jennifer responded.

In fact, in the attic I have a couple of huge moving crates full of
them, carefully packed away in mothballs. They come out once or
twice a year for pageants at the local churches. Suddenly, the
older women brightened as she said, I bet the basics of most of the
costumes we need are in there. If your fathers would ...

Yes! Jennifer squealed with delight. I&apos;m positive they&apos;ll get them down for us. Thanks so much, Grandma Sophia.

====

Can you do it, Aunt Sam? Little Danny asked over the phone.

Sam chuckled, Um, well, yes, I can, Little Danny, but ...

Sam stopped talking when she heard Little Danny informing some of the
others that, Aunt Sam says she can do it. Cheers, claps, and an
Oh, goodie! were heard.

Little Danny, have you asked your parents about this? Sam
inquired. ~You never know with these little dickens.~

No, but they&apos;ll say &apos;yes&apos;, Aunt Sam. We just want Bean Sprout to
be included. Is that bad? Little Danny asked, concerned about
Sam&apos;s hesitancy.

No, it&apos;s not. It&apos;s a good thing, Sam replied. Can I talk
to one of your fathers?

Okay. Hold on. I&apos;ll go find them, Little Danny said,
taking the cordless phone with him.

Sam heard him scampering along the floor. She could hear little
breaths as he ran up the stairs and, she assumed, in and out of a
couple of bedrooms before finally finding a parent.

Dad, it&apos;s Aunt Sam!

Carter! Jack exclaimed, pausing his cleanup in the storage room that
was located at the end of the long hallway of bedrooms.

Good afternoon, General, Sam said.

Yes, so ... what&apos;s up? Jack inquired.

Sam chuckled and responded, Little Danny just called me to ...

He did? Jack interrupted, wondering if he was going to have to punish
the little boy for making a call without permission.

Uh, I think Jennifer and David were there, too, Sam added.

~I&apos;ll check it out,~ Jack thought.

Anyway, Sam continued. Apparently, the children want Bean
Sprout to see their play.

They do? How? Jack quizzed.

They want me to set up a monitor in the den. You know, Sir, the
same kind of hook up I made for them in the living room, only in
reverse, the colonel commented.

Oh, that hook up. Of course, Jack said, shrugging.

Uh, well, is that okay, Sir? Sam asked after there had been a silence
of several seconds. I realize it&apos;s not really practical, but
Little Danny insists Bean Sprout will be able to see them. Who am
I argue to with a child prodigy? she chuckled.

Jack nodded, saying, Sure, go ahead. Can&apos;t leave Bean Sprout out
of the fun. I&apos;ll check with Danny, but I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll agree.

Okay, well, it won&apos;t take long to do, so I can just do it while I&apos;m
watching the kids on your date night, Sam decided.

Sounds like a plan, Carter.

====

Hey, Little Bit! Jack greeted as he entered the dance studio. Practicing for your recital?

Na-uh. This is for the play. Watch me, Dad! Lulu
requested. She moved to the cassette player and restarted the
music. Getting into position, she began to dance, her
concentration spot-on. When she was done, she smiled. Was
it okay?

It was wonderful! Jack exclaimed, smiling. What about the
recital?

This is more important; it&apos;s family. I&apos;ll work on the recital later. Lulu restarted the music and requested, Dad, tell me truth. I&apos;m not sure I&apos;m doing this right. The curly-haired brunette performed a few steps; then stopped and looked at her older father. Dad?

I&apos;m not a dance instructor, Little Bit, but from what I&apos;ve learned, I
think you need to try and extend your right arm up straighter, and when
you make that little leap thing, your arm is bobbing up and down.

Oh, that&apos;s not good. Thanks, Dad. I knew it wasn&apos;t
right. I&apos;ll work on it some more, Lulu said as she mentally
replayed the steps in her mind.

How about some ice cream? Jack asked.

Lulu smiled, but shook her head, wanting to practice some more.

You having fun, Lulu? Jack asked.

Jack and Daniel were constantly monitoring their young daughter, making
sure that dance remained a fun event for her. They were proud of
her dedication and devotion to the art and for practicing hard, but
they also didn&apos;t want her adding any pressure to herself, thinking she
had to be good for her parents.

Lulu smiled brightly, answering, Lots of fun, Dad!

Okay. Can I stay and watch? Jack inquired with a happy face.

With a smile that was the brightest yet, Lulu nodded and continued to
dance in front of her father.

What pleased the general was that when his princess stumbled here and there, she kept on smiling. It was different than how it had been before he and Daniel had realized the pressure she&apos;d been putting on herself to be perfect. Now her goal was to learn her craft, but perfection wasn&apos;t a requirement, even if she was hoping for it.

~Keep on smiling and having fun, Little Bit. Perfection is highly over rated. This is about the joy of dance. There you go!~

====

They won&apos;t let us help at all, Daniel chuckled over the phone a few
days later. David and Little Danny worked for hours on the
script.

Little Danny is an amazing child, Daniel, Catherine Littlefield
stated. I&apos;ll bet he grows up to be just like you.

Uh, a major pain in the butt? Daniel laughed.

And an excellent archaeologist, Catherine mused.

Daniel smiled. He loved Catherine. Since their very first
meeting at his disastrous final lecture in Academia, he&apos;d found the
woman fascinating. Now, she was like a mother to him. Of
course, Jack loved her, too, and both men were thrilled that she and
her husband, Ernest Littlefield, were so happy in their golden
years. Their only regret was that the Littlefields didn&apos;t live
closer to them.

I hope so, if, uh, that&apos;s what he wants, Daniel replied shyly.

Ernest and I are looking forward to seeing all the children
again. We miss them terribly. I do wish you could bring
them here for a visit sometime, the white-haired woman spoke.

We can&apos;t, Daniel sighed. We promised Noa. I don&apos;t know;
maybe when she&apos;s older. If she wants to try and go there, but we
can&apos;t go to New York until she&apos;s ready.

Chenoa&apos;s birth parents, the Morgans, had died during a vacation in New
York City, and the little girl associated their deaths with that
city. After Daniel had gone to the Big Apple on a business trip,
her fear had been revealed. From that moment on, Jack and Daniel
had promised their daughter that they&apos;d never go to New York City again
unless she agreed.

The poor dear, Catherine spoke. She was so young when her
parents died, but the mind is strong. Maybe Ptolemy could make
her curious.

~She might. Chenoa loves watching that bird.~ Daniel
laughed, How is Ptolemy?

Oh, a real riot. She walks around here like she&apos;s a queen;
which, of course, she is, the senior citizen stated with a chuckle.

Daniel replied, Well, I won&apos;t tell you what Jack said when you mailed
us that DVD last month, but ...

Daniel, you don&apos;t need to, Catherine interrupted. I&apos;ll tell
you the truth, though. Jack would love Ptolemy; give him someone
to order around since you&apos;ve got him under your thumb!

Catherine! Daniel exclaimed lightheartedly.

The woman laughed boisterously, then said, I am nothing if not a woman
of the truth, Daniel, and Jack is your captive slave.

Gawd, Daniel said, looking down bashfully. I can&apos;t wait to see
you Catherine.

Daniel and Catherine finished their conversation, and as Daniel hung up
the phone, he was full of good feelings. The Littlefields would
be flying in just so they could see the children&apos;s play. The
couple had cancelled their plans to attend a symphonic benefit so they
could travel from New York to Colorado Springs.

Jack! Jack, guess what? Daniel called out as he exited his den
and went in search of his husband to share the good news.

====

August had proved to be a difficult month and today, two days after Catherine&apos;s phone call, had been especially traumatic for the Jackson-O&apos;Neills. What had started out as a lovely, relaxing Tuesday at Pike&apos;s Peak had turned into a nightmare with a man trying to abduct Jonny and Little Danny, attacking Daniel in the process when he&apos;d gone after the two youngsters. While the family was all okay, it had been an upsetting experience, especially in light of Jennifer&apos;s additional information.

Daniel and the boys had sat down with a sketch artist, and the teenager
had recognized the man&apos;s portrait. She&apos;d then told her parents
that she&apos;d seen him earlier in the month when the family had been
picnicking at the Garden of the Gods.

Although the children seemed a little more settled after they&apos;d had
dinner, as a special treat the younger children were being allowed to
stay up an hour later than usual so that they could stage a run-through
of their play which would be presented to their family and friends in
just a few days. Jack and Daniel were hoping it would help the
brood unwind and forget about the worries of the day.

At the moment, the children were all busy with rehearsals, and Jack had
been unceremoniously kicked out of the rec room, being told, No one
can see the play &apos;til the opening night, and, yes, Dad that includes
you.

Jack didn&apos;t have to wonder about what to do. He planned on
pampering his husband thoroughly for at least a day since Daniel had
suffered a light concussion from his run-in with the man at Pike&apos;s Peak.

~Snuggling will be a good starter,~ Jack thought as he sought out his
lover, eventually finding Daniel in the den.

Daniel was sitting by Bean Sprout and caressing the womis, a pensive
expression on his face. Walking over to his husband, Jack
squeezed himself onto the chair as well, his arms snaking around
Daniel&apos;s waist.

You okay, Love? the older man queried with concern.

Daniel nodded and then sighed, I was just thinking. Jack,
where&apos;s the line between caution and paranoia? I mean, I can&apos;t
blame Jen for not telling us about seeing this guy ...

Creepy Guy, Jack said solemnly.

Daniel couldn&apos;t help but grin at the nickname Jack had bestowed on the
man who was stalking them.

After recognizing the man, Jennifer had told her parents about the man
in the Garden of the Gods who had returned a ball that David had
accidentally overthrown while they were playing catch.

The teenager had explained, I thought he was probably just trying to
be helpful, but there was something a little creepy about him.

Since then, Jack had referred to the man as Creepy Guy, though with the
events at Pike&apos;s Peak, Creepy Guy had gone from creepy to outright
disturbing.

Yes, Creepy Guy, Daniel acknowledged. I don&apos;t blame Jen for
not telling us about him; I mean, uh, all he did was hand her back the
ball but ...

But you kinda wish she&apos;d told us about him all the same? Jack
commented.

Daniel nodded, adding, But I don&apos;t want to make her start jumping at
shadows either, which she might start doing if we ask her to tell us
about everyone she sees that might be &apos;creepy&apos;.

Jack considered the matter for a moment, realizing that as parents,
they were in a precarious position sometimes.

I don&apos;t think she would, Angel, the older man finally said. She has good instincts about people. It&apos;s pretty obvious that
she was right about Creepy Guy.

So what do we do? Daniel inquired as he stared at the womis.

Jack answered, I think we need to let her know that she should listen
to her instincts. It&apos;s far better to overreact in these
situations than to underreact. Adults can fend for themselves,
kids can&apos;t.

Daniel looked at Jack and raised his eyebrow in a manner reminiscent of
Teal&apos;c.

Jack answered the unspoken question, saying, I knew the military
police would call them, but I phoned the local police station
anyway. I suggested they might like to swing by the Gardens and
the picnic area at Pike&apos;s Peak. On the slim chance that Creepy
Guy is just a &apos;normal&apos; degenerate who likes hanging around children,
hopefully, the sight of the police will scare him away.

Daniel felt his soul warm with the knowledge that Jack was protective
of all children, not just their own.

I love you, my Silver Fox, Daniel said tenderly.

Love you, too, Angel.

For the next half-hour, the couple didn&apos;t need words to express their feelings as they kissed and cuddled, making the most of their free time while their eleven children were otherwise occupied.

====

Okay, Dad, you have to get out now, Jennifer stated. She
grinned at her father who was trying to peer around the makeshift
curtains the children had erected in front of the stage in the rec
room. ~He&apos;s so curious.~

Can&apos;t I have just one peek? Jack whined. I&apos;m your father, for
crying out loud. You pushed me out just when it was starting to
get interesting.

Yup, and you&apos;re the one who chickened out, Dad, remember? Jennifer
reminded as she continued to push him towards the door, silently
remembering a few nights ago when the stage scenery was started.

 //Flashback//
How are we going to keep the backdrops from falling over? Jeff asked.

Well, Alex told us the floor was designed to be nailed into ...
Daniel mused.

You&apos;re kidding! the teen responded.

No, I&apos;m not, Daniel answered, expounding, It&apos;s made all of scrap
lumber two-bys.

What&apos;s that? a confused Aislinn asked.

The individual pieces of the floor are all the same thickness -- two
inches -- but with different widths, Daniel explained.

Oh, I understand, the little girl said, looking down. This one
is bigger than that one, she observed about one board that was six
inches next to a board that was ten inches.

Exactly, Daniel confirmed. Two-bys -- two-by-two, two-by-four,
et cetera. Alex said he&apos;s done this many times before for precisely
this purpose, he elucidated.

Elated at his good fortune, Jonny ran to the garage to grab three
hammers and a box of spike nails. He slowed to a brisk walk,
knowing he would be chastised for running, and as luck would have it,
just as he zipped past the open door of the study, Jack had caught a
glimpse of him going and coming.

Whoa, Speedy Gonzalez, Jack called out. Where are you going in
such a big hurry, and what are you going to do with those hammers and
nails?

We&apos;re going to nail the play scenery into the floor, Jonny excitedly
responded. Daddy says Alex d&apos;zined it that way. Alex is
cool, Dad! the boy said as he took off towards his destination.

Hey! Jack called out, hurrying after the ball of energy known as
Jonny. Seeing his husband, he said, Daniel, we&apos;re not going to
nail this into the floor. He waited for a moment and then asked,
Are we?

Would you prefer if the scenery fell over on one of the kids or pets?
Daniel replied in question. You heard what Alex said. The
floor is made for this. The first time&apos;s got to be the hardest,
Babe. Here, you go first, he suggested.

Handing his husband a hammer and a handful of nails, Daniel motioned to
the lengths of the two-by-four laid out where the backdrops were to be
erected.

C&apos;mon, Dad, Jonny eagerly urged.

The silver-haired man bent down on one knee, lined up a nail on a
board, and raised the hammer. With a sigh, he stopped with the
upraised hammer poised over his head.

I can&apos;t do it, Danny. We nearly drove ourselves, and everyone we
know, crazy getting this place done, not to mention Alex&apos;s fantasy of
burying us in the backyard with a bulldozer, Jack intoned, lowering
his arm.

Oh, for crying out loud, Jeff said, mocking his father. Here,
let me, he requested, taking the hammer and nails from Jack and
assuming the stooped posture.

Jack straightened up and announced, I can&apos;t watch, quickly walking
toward the door to the front hall.

&lt;Thwack!&gt;... Jack winced as Jeff hit the nail square on the head
and drove it through the two-by-four amid cheers from Jonny and David
...&lt;Thwack!&gt;... The hammer fell again.
//End of flashback//

 The group heard a thump followed by giggles and Jeff&apos;s muttered, For
cryin&apos;...

Jack, are you making a nuisance of yourself again? Daniel asked,
grinning at his husband and frustrated daughter.

Honestly, Daddy, he&apos;s worse than Ricky, Jennifer commented as she
rolled her eyes.

Ricky was the most curious of all her siblings, and it wasn&apos;t difficult
to see where he got it from.

Hey, I&apos;m not that bad, Jack responded defensively.

I&apos;ll keep him out of your hair, Jen, Daniel promised, earning him a
stare from his lover.

Thanks, Daddy.

Hey, I&apos;m standing right here, you know, Jack said as he glared at the
two.

Daniel and Jennifer exchanged an amused look before Jennifer retreated
and closed the pocket door firmly. With the other door to the rec
room already closed, the rec room was now sealed off from the original
part of the house.

Danny ...

Jack, they&apos;re fine. Come on. Let&apos;s go ... play, the
archaeologist suggested with raised eyebrows.

Play, eh? Jack said with a smile as he was willingly led away.

The lovers kissed their way into the living room where they enjoyed a
tender snugglefest on the sofa as their children rehearsed their play
undisturbed.

====

All set? Daniel asked, looking around the living room.

Yeah, I put the monitor and accessories upstairs in our room, Jack
answered.

It&apos;s safer, Jack, Daniel said. It would be too easy for one of
the brood to forget and start talking to Bean Sprout.

Nodding, the older man replied, It would be an unnecessary risk to
leave the equipment out here. We could invent a cover for it, but
why take the chance?

Especially when we&apos;re only talking a weekend, the archaeologist
agreed. While Catherine and Ernest knew about the Stargate, Suzanna
Simpson, Daniel&apos;s foster sister, didn&apos;t. He looked at his watch,
noting, Catherine and Ernest should be here anytime.

It&apos;ll be great to see them Jack opined.

Yes, it will, Daniel agreed. Oh, Bagel!

Bagel? The food or the rabbit? Jack mused.

Daniel glared, stating, She&apos;s out of her cage. I&apos;d better go
make sure the girls put her back in. Later, Babe.

After a quick kiss, Daniel headed upstairs to make sure the family
rabbit was properly secured.

====

Catherine! Jack exclaimed as he walked outside into the warm Friday
early afternoon weather to greet the Littlefields.

Jack, it&apos;s good to see you. It&apos;s been far too long, the female
scientist said as they hugged while her husband paid their taxi driver.

Much too long, Jack replied as they pulled apart. Ernest,
how&apos;s it going? Jack asked as he extended his hand.

Old bones, Jack. Don&apos;t get old, Ernest advised.

I&apos;m trying not to, but then I look at Danny and ... Jack began.

How is Daniel? Catherine asked, smiling warmly.

He can&apos;t wait to see you, Catherine, Jack responded with a
grin. He&apos;s inside with the brood.

Jack loved seeing Catherine&apos;s happy expression. Though they
didn&apos;t get to see her often, she was the closest thing to a maternal
figure Daniel had had since his own mother died. Jack knew his
husband&apos;s affection for the stately woman was huge.

Carrying their luggage, Jack led the couple inside.

====

We&apos;re very much looking forward to seeing your play tomorrow
afternoon, children, Catherine told the excited children after they&apos;d
settled in.

Catherine, tell me &apos;bout when you were in Egypt, Little Danny
requested as he snuggled in between Catherine and Ernest on the sofa.

Again? a bemused Catherine asked.

I want to hear about all the pyramids, the little boy replied.

Tell us &apos;bout Ptolemy first, Chenoa requested eagerly.

Ernest teased, Ptolemy is bigger than you, Noa. She&apos;s a
beautiful bird.

No, she&apos;s not, Chenoa giggled. Did you bring pictures? the
little girl asked.

We did better than that, Noa, Catherine responded. We brought
you a new DVD we recorded just last week.

Yay! Daddy, can we play the DVD now -- pleeeeeeeease? Chenoa
pleaded, jumping up and down.

Daniel looked at Jack and then Catherine as he asked, Catherine?

I&apos;ll go get it, the woman answered, rising from her spot on the sofa
and heading for the guestroom where her luggage was.

====

The children laughed at the DVD which depicted the antics of Catherine
and Ernest&apos;s bird, Ptolemy. Chenoa, especially, cheered and
applauded.

Maybe you&apos;d like to come and visit Ptolemy one day, Catherine coaxed
as Chenoa sat on her lap.

I don&apos;t like New York City, the curly-haired girl said sadly, her
head bowed.

Noa, we don&apos;t really live in the city. It&apos;s outside. It&apos;s
still New York, but we live in a beautiful suburban neighborhood,
Catherine said soothingly.

Chenoa pondered the situation, but she shook her head.

Catherine smiled and squeezed the little girl to her, saying, Well,
maybe someday, and if not, maybe we can bring Ptolemy to visit you.

Chenoa&apos;s face immediately brightened, and all of the children indicated
they&apos;d like that.

I&apos;ll teach Ptolemy Arabic, Little Danny announced.

Catherine laughed, saying, I bet you could, too!

====

As Alex prepared to leave J-O Enterprises that evening, he looked
around at the transformation that had been wrought in just eight days.

~Not bad at all. The furniture is coming tomorrow, and Sunday is the
preparation for work on Monday. Geez, these guys wear me out!~
the talented man thought as he locked up and headed for his car.

Hey! What are you doing back in town, Miracle Man? a boisterous voice
exclaimed.

Alex looked around to see a recent client, Casey Hemmings, smiling at
him.

Casey, nice to see you. What brings you to this part of town?
Alex asked as the two men shook hands.

I was visiting a friend who lives near here and was on my way home
when I saw your car, Casey answered, grinning. I just had to
stop and say &apos;thank-you&apos; for the work you did on my house. It
feels like home, now more than ever.

It&apos;s all in a day&apos;s work, Alex replied casually.

Nah, Casey responded, shaking off the denial. I didn&apos;t know
how sick I was of that stupid bar in the living room until you changed
it. Man, what an eyesore it was.

I am happy you like it, Alex intoned. Your extremely kind
words are what every designer longs to hear from a client. It
means the job was a success.

Very much a success. I had the house re-appraised last month,
and the bank that turned me down the first time loaned me more than I
asked for *and* at a lower interest rate, Casey raved.

That&apos;s great to hear, Alex said, beginning to walk towards his car
again.

Casey kept pace, replying, Especially since it means more work for
you.

It does? Alex asked, pausing his momentum for a moment.

With my new financial arrangements, I can spare enough now to buy the
leather furniture and the poker set for the game room. Can you
stop by tonight to discuss it? the nurse inquired hopefully.

Yes, I can. I&apos;ll stop by Archonics and pick up a few catalog
DVDs. Is seven okay? Alex queried, opening his car door.

Great! Casey exclaimed. I&apos;ll grill us a couple of steaks.

Thank-you, Alex spoke, adding, You&apos;re very kind.

Not at all, Casey said. See you later.

Alex left J-O and drove to Archonics, where he set out the catalog
discs, thinking, ~Sure a lot easier than lugging all those big binders
we used to have. All we need now is a disk and a few sample
sheets.~

====

Dropping by his home briefly, Alex showered and changed clothes as was
his custom before meeting clients for evening appointments. With
a quick check of his answering machine and a quick call to his
girlfriend to say, I love and miss you, he headed for Casey&apos;s home.

Alex was about ready to walk out the door when he caught a glimpse of
himself in the mirror in his front hall.

~Casey is not a new client. I don&apos;t need to impress him. It&apos;s been a long week; maybe I could ditch the jacket and tie for
once.~ Ten minutes later, Alex passed by the mirror again and
thought, ~That&apos;s better.~

The reflection showed a toned man, quite fit, in his early thirties,
wearing a crisp pair of tan poplin Bermudas and a trim red and tan polo
shirt. He had on a new pair of tan deck shoes and a suede
belt. Whistling, Alex picked up the large manila envelope
containing the samples and catalogs on disk and headed out his front
door.

====

At two minutes to seven, Casey heard the Jaguar pull into his
drive. He watched from the living room window, expecting Alex to
emerge wearing a fresh change of clothes, including jacket and
tie. He nearly dropped the vodka on the rocks he had just poured
when he saw what the object of his vision was actually wearing.

~That is one fine specimen of manhood. I can&apos;t believe it! Down, Casey! He&apos;s your designer, not your boyfriend ... but a guy can
dream, can&apos;t he?~ Answering the door and inviting his guest in,
the host said, Punctual as always, Alex. This is freshly poured,
and the steaks have just been put on the grill. Come on out back.

Thank you, Casey, Alex replied, putting the envelope he carried down
on the coffee table in the living room. I hope you don&apos;t mind
that I dressed down tonight.

~Mind? Hardly. I would have preferred you naked, but I
wouldn&apos;t have been able to contain myself. This is a vast
improvement.~ Verbally, the nurse responded, Not at all. It&apos;s not like you have to impress me. I&apos;m glad you felt free to
dress comfortably.

For a split-second, Alex wondered why Casey&apos;s off-hand remark made him
feel so welcome, but the question was forgotten when his host spoke
again.

How do you like your steak? Casey inquired as they walked into the
backyard.

Medium rare, Alex answered.

The two men chatted amiably, mainly about their educational and professional pasts, but Alex avoided any discussion of family, and Casey simply didn&apos;t discuss anything related to dating or past romantic entanglements. Of course, that might have been because the designer was overflowing with talk about Soncirria, his love for her obvious by his expression and tone whenever he talked about her.

I&apos;d better check the steaks, Casey said at one point, getting up from
his chair.

Alex nodded, watching from the lawn chair he sat in and silently
pondering, ~He&apos;s a nice guy to have me over for a meal when he didn&apos;t
have to. He&apos;s funny, too. Wonder why he&apos;s not
married?~ He smiled, thinking of his own love. ~Yeah, he
just hasn&apos;t met his Sunny yet.~

As Casey checked the steaks, he thought, ~How could I have been so
wrong? Is my gaydar on the blink? He&apos;s sure wrapped up in this
Sunny woman.~ He chuckled, but not so loudly that his guest would
hear. ~He never used to talk about anything but work; now, all he
talks about is work and her. Okay, Casey. Wrong or not
wrong, he&apos;s obviously not interested, so it&apos;s time to move on and stop
wasting my time over someone I don&apos;t even know that well.~

====

The actual selection of furniture only took thirty minutes. Casey
ordered the leather seating group and a nice poker table and chair set
as well as some additional furniture for his living room.

I&apos;m glad I listened to you about the carpet, Casey commented. With a smile, he added, Maybe I&apos;ll get around to redoing the other
side of the house, and, if I do, I&apos;ll give you a call. He
continued to smile as he extended out his hand in thanks. ~I&apos;d
like to call you from the other side of the bed. Casey, what did
you decide earlier? Ah well.~ As they shook hands, he said,
Please, consider yourself welcome here anytime you&apos;re in town.

Thank you very much, Casey. I appreciate that, Alex replied
warmly, appreciative of the welcome.

====

Alex drove back to his Colorado Springs condo, eagerly awaiting his
flight back to Florida and Sunny. Suddenly, he smiled as his cell
phone played the tune that meant she was calling.

Hello, Alex greeted. Do you miss me as much as I miss you?

More, Sunny lovingly replied. Honestly, Alex, I love Mom, but
she got on my last nerve. She ranted on and on about how my
decision to leave the pageant trail behind me is wasting all she and
Dad sacrificed for me.

That&apos;s not true, Honey, Alex rebuked.

I tried to explain that I am now in my late twenties, and my chances
of winning the state title are slim to none. She wouldn&apos;t listen,
not even for a minute, when I told her that winning a major title like
&apos;Miss United States&apos; to compete in the Miss Universe Pageant are almost
nil, Sunny stated.

You could, though. No one stands a chance against you, Alex
warmly replied.

You&apos;re so sweet, but you know how I feel, Alex. I haven&apos;t had a
normal life at all, not even when I was little. It was
competition after competition, dance class after singing lesson after
make-up session, after fabric selection for outfits. Enough
already! the woman wearily exclaimed.

Sunny, you know I support you, whatever you decide. You don&apos;t
need a title or a crown for me to know that you&apos;re the prettiest woman
in the United States or the universe, Alex sincerely stated.

Have I told you that I love you? Sunny asked, refreshed by her
boyfriend&apos;s words.

Not yet, Alex admitted.

Well, I do. Sunny sighed, I don&apos;t think you&apos;ll be meeting my
mother anytime soon. I&apos;m afraid she blames you for my decision to
stop competing.

I&apos;m sorry, Soncirria, the man sadly responded.

We know the truth, and that&apos;s what&apos;s important. I thought she
could be happy for me, that I met somebody wonderful, but that&apos;s not
her dream for me. I&apos;m sorry to dump all this on you, Hon, Sunny
spoke

You met somebody? That&apos;s great! I&apos;m happy for you! Alex teased.

You nut! Sunny laughed over the phone.

Yeah, but I&apos;m your nut, Alex replied, smiling.

And don&apos;t you forget it, Sunny instructed jovially. Seriously, Alex, whatever possessed me to stay an extra week? Remind me never to stay this long again with my mother.

Never stay that long again with your mother, Alex teased.

Thanks, the beauty queen chuckled. What time does your flight arrive? I&apos;ll pick you up ...

The couple continued their happy discussion, each looking forward to
their reunion.

====

The next afternoon, the Jackson-O&apos;Neill recreation room was full of
guests, including General Hammond, Sam and Pete, Teal&apos;c, Janet, the
Wilson clan, the Ferrettis, Dale and Nancy Rancolini, the Lapierre
family, Mrs. Valissi, the Paynes, Christa and Jacob Svenson, Suzanna
Simpson, Megan Williams and Yazid Awad, Karissa Lewis, the
Littlefields, Johanna Severson, Jeff and Margaret Cornell, Pam
Lawrence, Sylvia Preston, and several of the neighborhood
families. Naturally, there were as many children present as there
were adults.

Jack, it&apos;s at times like this that I&apos;m glad we listened to Alex,
Daniel whispered to his husband as they stood in the hospitality room,
preparing drinks and snacks for their guests.

Yeah. He knew what he was talking about, Jack responded about
the designer who had come up with the concept of the hospitality room,
not just for the large, family but for events just like this one.

The lovers had never imagined having a house full of guests, but right
now, they were glad for floor pillows that most of the children were
seated on in front of the stage, allowing the parents to occupy the
sofas and chairs brought in from other rooms.

Showtime, Angel, Jack quipped a while later, having gotten the signal
from Jeff that it was time to begin.

Together, Jack and Daniel made sure their guests, the audience, were
settled and then they took their own positions. With a nod from
Daniel, Jack gave his teenage son the go ahead to begin.

====

Places, everyone! Jeff called out.

Settle down, Spitfires, Jennifer called out.

Moments later, the lights dimmed, and the curtains opened. In the
left corner of the stage, a light that looked like a candle came on,
illuminating David who was sitting at a small table. He was
holding a quill pen and began to write while speaking out loud to his
audience.

In this year, 1135, King Henry went across the sea, and while he lay
asleep on his ship, the day darkened over all lands. Men became
very frightened, and it was said that something terrible would soon
come. And so it did. While in Normandy, King Henry died.

As David spoke, the lights on the stage went on to show a
bedroom. Ricky as King Henry was lying on a small bed surrounded
by grieving attendants, otherwise known as Jenny, Aislinn, Jonny,
Chenoa, and Lulu. At least four of the attendants were grieving,
but it looked like Jenny was trying to stifle giggles.

The lights dimmed on stage again, and David continued, over the sound
of thumps, giggles, and moving furniture.

Although the nobles of the land had been forced by the old king to
swear an oath of loyalty to his daughter, Matilda, no one was ready to
follow a queen. A queen could not be a soldier, could not defend
the land, and so despite their oath of loyalty to Matilda, the people
chose to follow the old king&apos;s nephew, Stephen of Blois.

The lights came on the stage again, and this time the scene was a
church, signified by cardboard cutouts of stained glass windows and a
huge cross. Stephen, otherwise known as Little Danny, was
kneeling in front of Lulu, who was holding a cardboard crown.

I, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Lulu said, do crown thee King
Stephen.

At this point, David held up a sign saying CHEER. An obliging
audience did so, and Little Danny turned and gave a small bow.

Jack smiled from the side of the room. He checked the recording
equipment to make sure it was running smoothly.

**Danny, everything okay with your camcorder?**

**Just fine. Aren&apos;t they adorable, Babe?**

**Yeah,** Jack communicated as he beamed with pride.

The lights on the stage dimmed once more, and David continued his
narrative, saying, Unfortunately, peace did not last long. One of the first traitors to rise against his king was Baldwin de
Revers.

The curtains opened, this time revealing King Stephen and Baldwin de
Revers (better known as Jonny), wearing a wig and false beard, circling
each other and holding plastic swords. They began to mock
fight. Stephen was the first to pull back, only to have Baldwin
follow after him, ignoring the royal glare sent his way as he began
backing Stephen all over the stage.

Jonny, we&apos;re both supposed to stop. We do more fighting later,
Little Danny hissed at his brother who looked guilty and dropped his
sword.

Sorry, Jonny whispered back. ~That&apos;s fun!~

Back in character as Stephen, Little Danny spoke his next lines:
Baldwin, this fighting is ridiculous. We are men of peace. I propose a truce.

Baldwin smirked, Very well. You give me Gre...uh, greee
... Jonny leaned forward, whispering, How do you say it, Little
Danny?

The audience chuckled good-naturedly as Little Danny helped his brother.

Oh, yeah. Back in character, Jonny as Baldwin stated, You give
me Grevesham Castle, and I will accept your truce.

Stephen shrugged his shoulders and said, It&apos;s a small price to pay for
peace. Come, let us drink together.

The two slung arms around each other&apos;s shoulders and walked off the
stage.

Those are my boys, Jack whispered to Johanna.

The woman laughed and replied, They sure are, Jack.

On stage, David resumed his narrative as he spoke, Word soon spread
that Stephen was a mild man, gentle and good, and would impose no
penalty on traitors. Rebellion sprung up everywhere.

Jonny, wearing a different colored wig and beard, returned to the stage
followed by Stephen. The two fought their way across the platform
and were soon joined by Ricky, Jenny, Chenoa, and Lulu, each carrying
swords and mock fighting each other.

Lawlessness reigned, David continued. Bishops ...

My beard!

Little Danny&apos;s cry of dismay, followed by giggles, interrupted David&apos;s
speech. He turned around and started chuckling himself. There,
stuck on the end of Jonny&apos;s sword, being waved around in the air, was
Stephen&apos;s beard.
 
Jonny grinned and announced, I shall hold your beard for ransom!

Then Jonny turned and ran off the stage, being chased by a beardless
&apos;Stephen&apos;.

David cleared his throat and began his speech again as Ricky, Chenoa,
Jenny, and Lulu continued their mock fighting.

Lawlessness reigned. Neither bishops nor abbots nor priests were
spared; every man who was stronger robbed those who were weaker, and it
was said openly that Christ and his saints slept.

The lights on stage dimmed, and David continued, Then in the year
1139, Matilda invaded England with the aid of her husband, Geoffrey
Plantagenet. Matilda believed that the throne of England was
rightfully hers. Her best soldier was her illegitimate half
brother, Robert, Earl of Gloucester.

The stage lights came on again to show Aislinn as Matilda with Jenny as
her maid, Jonny as Robert, and Ricky as Henry. Aislinn was seated
in a chair that had been dressed up to look like a throne, and there
was a plain background. Jenny was sitting on a stool next to her
sister. Both &apos;Robert&apos; and &apos;Henry&apos; had swords hanging from their
belts.

Henry, my son, Aislinn said as Matilda.

Ricky wrinkled his nose at the idea of being his sister&apos;s son. Finally, Aislinn poked him, and he sighed, Yes, Mom?

This is your Uncle Robert. He&apos;s going to help us defeat my
treacherous cousin; then one day, you will be king.

But first, Robert said with enthusiasm, I&apos;m going to teach you to
fight.

Immediately, Henry perked up, and the two began fighting making their
way off stage as they fought. Matilda turned to her assistant,
Jenny, and shook her head.

Boys, Matilda sighed. Now, let&apos;s enjoy some dancing.

At this, Chenoa and Lulu came onto the stage and began their dance
recital. When they finished, to great applause, a brief
intermission was held. Then the lights dimmed again and, in his
narrator&apos;s corner, David continued the story.

Matilda and Stephen were at a stalemate. Neither could defeat
the other, and so civil war might have continued had it not been for
the death of Eustace, Stephen&apos;s son and heir, in 1153.

The lights came on and showed Stephen sitting at the bedside of his son.

Goodbye, my son, Stephen said sadly. He walked to the other
side of the stage where Henry was waiting. I will recognize you
as my heir, Henry. Upon my death you shall inherit the throne.

Henry nodded, and the two left the stage, the light dimming as they
went.

David stood, laying down his quill as he spoke, And so ended nineteen
years of unrest -- the first English Civil War.

When David turned off his flashlight, the audience clapped
enthusiastically. The lights came back on, and all the younger members
of the brood marched back on and bowed.

Then, David stepped forward, encouraging, And please thank Jen, who
did the invitations, most of the costumes, and helped with the scenery
changes. After Jennifer bowed, David added, And please give it up for
Bri who also helped with the scenery changes and directed much of our
play. After Brianna bowed to her applause, he continued, And
one more round of applause for Jeff who did the lighting.

Jennifer moved forward again, saying, And we couldn&apos;t have done this
without our playwrights, she pointed to her siblings, David and
Little Danny. The audience again thundered their applause. We also need to thank Mrs. Valissi for helping me so very much with
the costumes and also our Aunt Sara who helped the boys with the
history and the script.

More applause broke out as both Mrs. Valissi and Sara blushed, their
smiles huge at having been able to help the children.

Let&apos;s see ... and how about some applause for our intermission
entertainment. Come on, Noa and Lulu. Do it again!
Jennifer urged.

As the crowd cheered, the young girls did a short encore and then
curtsied. They looked at all the smiles, each stopping when they
saw their happy fathers. Jack whistled while Daniel stood up,
starting a standing ovation for the two girls.

Noa, they liked it, Lulu whispered happily.

Finally, Brianna moved forward and addressed the still-standing
audience, saying, And we&apos;d like to thank Dad and Daddy for
chauffeuring us around and for, uh, paying the tab for this
award-winning production.

Jack shouted, I have the receipts to prove it, too!

Jack! Daniel warned.

And it was worth every penny! Jack added with a prideful grin. ~Hey, maybe we can charge people for the refreshments.~

**Jack Jackson-O&apos;Neill, you will do no such thing.**

**You heard that, huh?**

Daniel glared at his husband as the audience began moving around.

**It&apos;s getting to where a man can&apos;t think anymore without being
overheard,** Jack mused via their special communication.

The archaeologist was about to shoot daggers at his husband when he saw
Jack&apos;s loving smile.

**I love having you in my head, Angel, and in my ...**

**Jack!**

Little Danny came running over to his parents, anxiously asking, Dad,
Daddy, did you like it? Maybe next time we can do a play set in
Ancient Egypt.

**He&apos;s already planning another one?** Jack asked.

Daniel grinned at Jack&apos;s disbelief, replying, **Maybe he&apos;ll be an actor
when he grows up.**

**Nope, he loves digging in the dirt too much.**

It was a wonderful play, Little Danny, Daniel told their son with
Jack echoing the sentiment moments later.
 
The little boy beamed and ran off to talk to some of the other
guests. Daniel caught sight of movement in the stage area
and laughed.

I think we know what Jonny is going to be, Babe, Daniel said as he
continued to laugh.

Jack followed the direction of Daniel&apos;s eyes and saw Jonny teaching
other kids from the neighborhood how to sword fight. As they
watched, he dashed over to where Teal&apos;c was talking to Sam and Pete and
dragged the Jaffa onto the stage to help.

Soon, Teal&apos;c had all the kids lined up and doing moves with exact
precision, much to the amazement of their watching parents.

Daniel, they&apos;re growing up so fast, Suzanna commented. Daniel&apos;s
foster sister had changed her vacation plans to attend the
Jackson-O&apos;Neill play and visit the family, delaying her trip to Hawaii
for two days. Since the Littlefields were staying in the
downstairs guestroom, she was staying in the room upstairs between the
boys&apos; and Brianna&apos;s room. I&apos;m so glad they invited me.

Aunt Suz! Jenny exclaimed, running up and extending out her arms.

Suzanna picked her up, smiling, and said, Jenny, you were wonderful!

The redheaded girl beamed and replied, Aunt Suz, will you teach me how
to look pretty? You always look pretty.

Oh, girl talk. I&apos;ll leave you two alone, Daniel said as he
began to walk away, though he added, Jenny, you&apos;re always beautiful.

Aunt Sara, they liked it! David said ecstatically as he approached
Sara and Mark. Sara was holding Madeline, but Angela was off with
Chenoa and some of the other children. Did you like it, Uncle
Mark?

David, it was outstanding. You wrote a wonderful play, Mark
intoned as he patted the smiling boy on his shoulder.

Aunt Sara helped a lot. Thanks, David said, grinning in
gratitude at the blonde.

I didn&apos;t do so much. You knew most of the history. I just
helped you organize it a little bit, Sara said encouragingly as she
patted the boy on his shoulder.

Across the room, Jennifer hugged their energetic senior citizen
neighbor as she stated, Mrs. Valissi, thank you again for helping me
with the costumes. I wouldn&apos;t have made it without you.

Jennifer, for the time you had, you did an awesome job. You
could be a fine seamstress if you really put your mind to it, the
woman responded.

Thanks, Mrs. V, Jennifer stated.

In another corner of the rec room, Hammond was holding Ricky while
talking to some of the parents who lived in the neighborhood.

My grandchildren really know how to put on a play, the military man
spoke, his pleasure obvious by the tone of his voice and the pleased
expression on his face.

Nearby, Brianna was chatting with Megan and Yazid, whose long distance
courtship was going strong.

So when are you going to pop the question, Yazid? the mischievous
ten-year-old asked.

*Pop* the question? the handsome Egyptian asked.

Yeah, you know, ask her to marry you, Brianna chirped.

Brianna! Megan bashfully chastised, then looked away, trying to hide
her reddening face.

Brianna giggled at the couple&apos;s embarrassment, but then the
conversation switched to Megan&apos;s upcoming vacation.

I&apos;m so excited, Megan stated.

Let me guess, Brianna challenged. Guys, guys, and more guys!

I should think not! Yazid jealously stated, causing both females to
laugh.

Yazzy, you know better, Megan said, patting him on the chest and
leaning in for a kiss.

~Yazzy? Ooooookay.~ Brianna smiled and then asked, Where
are you going, Megan?

To the Bahamas for ... Megan began.

Guys, guys, and more guys, Brianna laughed.

Actually, no. Well, there may be some, but I&apos;m fulfilling a
dream, Bri. I&apos;m going to swim with the dolphins, Megan intoned
enthusiastically.

Brianna&apos;s eyes lit up, and her mouth opened wide. Her entire
expression was one of awe and wonder.

You&apos;re going to actually swim with dolphins ... in the ocean? the
young girl asked.

Yes, in October, Megan answered. Bri, are you interested in
doing that?

That would be so ... oh, Megan, you have to tell me all about it,
Brianna requested.

So you like dolphins?

Brianna nodded, saying, I saw this old TV show once; um, &apos;Flipper&apos; was
the name I think, and ever since then, I thought that would be the
coolest, most incredible thing I could ever do.

Have you mentioned that to your parents? Megan asked.

No, Brianna shrugged. They&apos;d probably think it was
silly. Take lots of pictures, Megan. Oh, man, you&apos;re so
lucky!

Megan was about to question Brianna further when Sam and Pete wandered
over, and the conversation turned in a different direction. She
made a mental note to herself to mention it to Jack or Daniel in a few
days, sure that they&apos;d like to know if Brianna wasn&apos;t going to tell
them herself.

Suddenly, the triplets ran by Megan, Aislinn looking back and
apologizing, Sorry, Megan. I didn&apos;t mean to bump into you.

That&apos;s okay, Ash, Megan said with a smile.

Aunt Janet! Jonny called out.

Hey, there&apos;s our little soldier, Janet chimed. You three did a
marvelous job tonight. I&apos;m very proud of you.

Thanks, Aunt Janet, Little Danny replied.

Aunt Janet, Dad and Daddy filmed our play. Will you make sure
Cassie and Dom get one? Aislinn asked.

I&apos;ll remind them. Cassie was so disappointed that they couldn&apos;t
come and see it in person, Janet responded, her hand brushing against
the little girl&apos;s hair.

We miss her, Little Danny noted.

Suddenly, Janet&apos;s cell phone rang. Pulling it out of her purse,
she chuckled, grinning at the children.

Is it Cassie? Jonny asked eagerly.

Janet nodded and without answering the phone handed it to the eldest
Munchkin.

Cassie, it&apos;s Jonny!

Jonny! Cassandra laughed. Where&apos;s my mother?

She&apos;s here. We miss you, Cassie, Jonny said.

I am *soooo* upset that Dom and I couldn&apos;t be there to see your first
play, the long-haired young woman expressed with sadness.

We&apos;ll have another one, Jonny promised.

Little Danny took the phone, saying, Cassie, Jonny made a great
soldier.

Hello, Little Danny. I&apos;m not surprised. Tell me all about
it, Cassandra requested, a huge smile on her face as she sat back and
got comfortable in her chair, well aware that Little Danny would give
detail after detail of the entire program. ~Good thing Mom knew
this was why I was calling.~

====

It was some hours later before most of the guests had gone home. Now only Sam, Pete, Teal&apos;c, Hammond, the Littlefields, and Suzanna
remained.

It was a wonderful evening, Jack, Daniel, Hammond said, standing up
to take his leave. He looked at the younger members of the brood
and smirked at the two men. Good luck getting the kids to sleep.

Ricky, Jonny, and Little Danny were pursuing each other with their fake
swords, Jenny and Aislinn were in the yard playing chase with Bij and
Katie, while Chenoa and Lulu were still practicing their dance steps.

I&apos;ve been a general in the United States Air Force for seven years,
George. I&apos;m sure I can get them settled, Jack said confidently.

Daniel gave his husband a smug grin and said, Well Babe, it seems
you&apos;ve just volunteered for bed duty. I&apos;m sure we&apos;re all looking
forward to seeing you in action.
 
Jack looked a little worried.

Go on, Sir. We were going to leave, but I don&apos;t think we can
pass up this chance, do you Pete? Sam asked her husband, though she
was grinning at her CO.

I, too, look forward to seeing you order your children to bed, Teal&apos;c
said solemnly, a slight twitch to his eyebrow the only sign of his
amusement.

Fine, Jack said, nodding as he strode to the middle of the
room. BROOD, ATTENTION!

Within seconds, all eleven children were lined up in front of their
father.

They look like the Von Trapps, Catherine chuckled to Ernest,
referring to the classic movie, &apos;The Sound of Music&apos;, in which the
children lined up according to age when being introduced to their new
governess.

Jack paced back and forth in front of them until Aislinn began to
giggle. Then Chenoa laughed which made Lulu laugh. Jenny
and Ricky joined in the merriment, and soon all the children were
laughing.

Without even trying, Jack sighed and said weakly, Time for bed.

Not yet, Dad, Aislinn protested. Aunt Suz is going to teach me
how to roll my hair.

Roll your hair?

One after the other, the children whined until Jack admitted defeat.

Thank you, Sir, Sam teased. That was very enlightening.

Yeah, Jack, do you think you can come down to the station and show the
guys your expert leadership techniques? Pete joked.

Jack glared and responded, Just wait until you have children,
Shanahan.

Pete gulped, and Sam&apos;s eyes widened, saying a quick Goodnight, Sir,
taking Pete&apos;s hand, and heading for the exit, stopping quickly to say
goodnight to the others.

As the others laughed, Daniel clapped his hands, saying, Okay, Brood,
bed -- now. Ash, Suz will be up in a couple of minutes. Jonny, Teal&apos;c&apos;s going to tell you about a special way of using that
sword *after* you&apos;re in bed. David, your stash of goodies will be
returned only after lights out. Jen ...

Jack chuckled as Daniel &apos;convinced&apos; the children to go upstairs and get
ready for bed.

~Blackmail. Geez, I could have done that.~

====

After finally getting all the kids to bed and checking on Bean Sprout,
the lovers were in their favorite position on the roof deck. Jack
was leaning against the wall with Daniel seated in front of him. Daniel&apos;s head was resting against Jacks left shoulder as they enjoyed
just being together and watching the stars above.

I think that the children are already planning the next play, Daniel
opined.

Why do you think that, Angel? Jack asked, snaking his hands under the
younger mans shirt to caress the soft skin.

I heard Jonny, Little Danny, and Ricky talking about how they could
make pyramids for the background when I walked into their room to tuck
them in, Daniel confided with a small chuckle.

I have a feeling we&apos;ll be having many more nights like tonight, the
older man observed with a smile.

So do I, Daniel agreed, turning to face Jack. I have plans of
my own for a little ... play.

Daniel kissed Jack, and they proceeded to engage in their play of
love. It was a play that went all night, calling for several
encores and curtain calls. The next morning, each gave the other
glowing reviews.

====

Alex, I can&apos;t believe you did it again, Jack remarked as they
examined the new conference room.

It was Sunday evening, and the last of the workers had left just an hour earlier. Now, Alex had led Jack, Daniel, Megan, and Karissa through their new office, ending with the second floor conference room.

I love the spiral stairway that leads up here, Karissa commented
about the stairs.

The designer had enclosed a few square feet of the garage to surround
the spiral staircase which led to the conference room. Immediately, Megan noticed the small serving center which occupied a
four-foot run of cabinet and included a small sink.

~That is really going to save us running up and down the stairs,~ Megan
thought. I&apos;m so glad you thought of this, Alex, she spoke aloud.

It&apos;s not room for much, but at least you can dump ice and leftover
beverages down the drain. If you ever serve a meal in here, I&apos;d
have it catered, Alex put forth.

I agree, Karissa responded enthusiastically since she often ended up
going after food and drinks during meetings.

No coffeemaker? Daniel asked with big eyes.

I didn&apos;t see the need to ... Alex stopped, realizing he&apos;d made a
snafu.

Alex, you *are* human after all! Jack laughed. Danny, we&apos;ll
get a coffeemaker, he promised.

Yes, we will, Daniel replied, moving on to examine another area of
the room.

Wanting to forget his rare goof, Alex pointed out the elevator.

I never would have believed that an elevator could be fitted in the
space of a shower. It&apos;s incredible! Karissa exclaimed.

The braking system is hydraulic cylinders. It&apos;s made it possible
to put elevators in places where conventional equipment would have been
physically or financially unfeasible before, Alex elucidated.

Ty will be the first to benefit, but I hope needing the elevator
doesn&apos;t become a habit, Daniel added, looking over at the two women to
communicate his &apos;stay fit&apos; message.

After everyone had admired the small elevator, they returned to
investigating the other features of the room. There was a
conference table that would seat twenty people with laptops. Internet, Ethernet, and electrical connections were built into the
tabletop for convenience.

I think you&apos;ll like this, Alex continued. This projection
screen lowers in front of the rear-facing the windows. Silently,
he thought, ~Okay, so I messed up on the coffeemaker, but, trust me, my
good fellows, this one is *not* a mistake.~ Alex smiled at his
secret. He&apos;d tried to convince Jack and Daniel to install a
videoconferencing setup, to plan for the future, but the couple had
steadfastly refused. Confident he was right, Alex had installed a
plasma screen that would lower from the ceiling for the video
conferences.

That&apos;s great, Alex, Daniel commented.

Alex smiled, silently smirking, ~Megan told me how you guys just don&apos;t
want to face how fast your company is growing, and from what I can see,
she&apos;s right. I&apos;d love to see your faces when you call and ask me
to hook you up, and I tell you which buttons to push. No, I&apos;ll
eat the cost for now. That&apos;s how sure I am that you&apos;ll be hosting
the videoconferences you can&apos;t even imagine having right now. Don&apos;t worry, Boys, I&apos;ll send you the bill when you make that call, and
you *will* make that call.~ Unseen by others, Alex shook his head
at Jack&apos;s and Daniel&apos;s denial of their own success. ~J-O&apos;s growth
has matched or exceeded Archonics&apos;, and that&apos;s saying quite a lot.~

No more searching for outlets, Megan, Karissa replied, still
reviewing the setup.

You mean no more runs in our stockings from crawling on the floor,
Megan laughed.

It&apos;s wonderful, Alex, Jack said when they were done. You did
it again. Extending his hand, he spoke a very sincere, Thank
you.

====

After a full weekend, Jack and Daniel put in a few hours of work Monday morning at the remodeled offices of J-O Enterprises. They were actually out of babysitters that day, so the children, except for Jennifer and Jeff, who were back in school again, were playing outside of the house/business office under the watchful eyes of Karissa and Dora.

Dora smiled as she watched Little Danny with Karissa. They were sitting at a picnic table, and Little Danny was drawing a picture of a pyramid for his Love.

Rissa, when I grow up, we&apos;ll go on lots of digs together, okay?
Little Danny asked casually.

Okay, Little Danny, Karissa said with a tender smile. Maybe
we&apos;ll go see this pyramid.

It&apos;s big, the boy commented.

Do you remember when you were there? the young woman asked.

Little Danny nodded and suggested, I&apos;ll show you, Rissa. We&apos;ll
have lots of fun.

We always do, Karissa replied. She smiled sweetly at the little boy as he went back to working on his drawing. ~He&apos;s so adorable. Too bad he isn&apos;t all grown up.~

====

Jack, Daniel, before you leave, I&apos;d like to ask you about something,
Megan said a bit hesitantly.

What is it, Megan? Daniel asked as the three stood in the office that
the lover&apos;s jointly used.

Uh, well, you know I&apos;m going to the Bahamas in October, the woman
said.

It&apos;s a vacation, not a honeymoon, right? Jack asked in fear.

Jack! Daniel said, jabbing his husband in the abdomen.

Megan blushed shyly as she shook her head.

I apologize for my husband, Megan, Daniel said.

Jack just shrugged, saying, We need you.

Thank you, Jack, but rest assured, this is just a vacation, and Yazid
is not accompanying me, the female replied. ~Unfortunately.~

So what did you want to tell us? Daniel prodded.

Did you know Brianna loves dolphins? Megan inquired, though she
already knew the answer from the girl&apos;s comments after the play.

She does? both Jack and Daniel said in unison.

Yes, she does, and, well, I&apos;m not sure how you two would feel about
it, but I checked, and it would be okay, arrangement-wise, Megan
stated as she went back and forth between looking her friends and
employers in the eyes.

What would be? Daniel asked.

Megan asked, How would you feel if I took Brianna with me so she could
see the dolphins up close and maybe even swim with them?

Wow! Daniel said in reaction to the question.

Jack pursed his lips as he thought about it.

Look, let me show you some information about the group I&apos;m going
with, Megan suggested, leading the couple over to their
computer. She brought up the website of the Wildquest group she
was going with and began describing various aspects of the trip. We&apos;d fly to Fort Lauderdale. From there, we&apos;re picked up by
Wildquest and take a twenty-five minute ride on a seaplane to the
Caribbean fishing village of Porgy Bay. Megan glanced at Jack
and quickly told him, And we don&apos;t need any Porgy and Bess jokes.

I wasn&apos;t going to say anything! Jack protested.
 
Jack saw Megan and Daniel simply snort in disbelief as Jack huffed
indignantly before smirking, Yet.

Anyway, Megan continued, we then spend the next week going out on a
catamaran and swimming with the dolphins. There are also yoga
classes, snorkeling, and other activities we can do.

Bri would love it, Daniel commented as he looked at the photographs
of the dolphins the website showed.

Ah, the thing is, these tours fill up really quickly, Megan stated
informatively. In fact, they&apos;re fully booked for the rest of the
year. I phoned Wildquest this morning, though, and they said that
they had just had a cancellation on one of their tours, not the one I
was originally booked on -- this one leaves the following week -- but
if my lovely kind bosses don&apos;t mind, I can easily rearrange my other
bookings. Wildquest is willing to hold the places for twenty-four
hours, but after that ...

Are you sure you want to even consider this Megan? It&apos;s really
throwing out your entire schedule, and we could always take Bri next
year, Daniel responded, worried that having Brianna along might
restrict Megan&apos;s holiday.

Jack obviously had the same concerns, saying, And are you sure you
want to be looking after a ten-year-old while you&apos;re on vacation?

Megan smiled at them both as she answered, I&apos;ve thought this through,
Guys. I really like Bri, and you didn&apos;t see her face light up
when I told her what I was going to be doing.

But still ... Jack said hesitantly.

And it&apos;s not as if I&apos;m going to want to meet people. Megan
blushed as she admitted, To be honest, I probably wouldn&apos;t have
offered if Yazid were coming with me, but he&apos;ll be working, and I&apos;d
really like the company.

We&apos;ll think about it, Megan. I don&apos;t know that I want any of the
brood going away while we have this madman after us, Jack sighed.

Daniel quickly rebutted, We&apos;ve been through this, Jack. We can&apos;t
protect the brood by keeping them at our sides all the time. Speaking of which, I&apos;d better take Noa to her gym camp.

Have you got Carter&apos;s doohickey? Jack asked with a smile.
 
Daniel nodded, then inquired, Megan, when&apos;s your trip?

The revised dates would be October twenty-third through the
twenty-ninth; I was supposed to go the week before, Megan answered.

We&apos;ll let you know. Jack, I&apos;ll see you at home, Daniel said as
he gave his husband a quick kiss and then walked out, leaving the two
alone.

Are you sure about this? Jack asked.

It would be my pleasure. I think Bri would have a fantastic
time, Megan answered with a big smile. Just think about it ...
for an hour or two, she quipped.

====

As Daniel headed home from dropping Chenoa off, he had an idea and
phoned Sam.

Sure, Daniel, Sam responded after hearing Daniel&apos;s request. It
wouldn&apos;t be a problem at all, and, in fact, I could make one so that
it&apos;s like a bracelet. It could even have a lock that you can keep
separately.

She&apos;s going to be in the water a lot.

The GPS will still work, Sam replied. We&apos;ve made great strides
in that. I&apos;ll explain the details when I show you how to work
it. Uh, when do you need this by?

Daniel smiled. Sam had already come up with a special pager they
could give the younger children for when they were separated from
them. He had just given one to Chenoa while dropping her off at
her gym group. The pager had one button that was an alarm and one
that sent a signal to Jack and Daniel, who had receivers with them at
all times.

Sam had just told the concerned parent that she could rig the same type
of device in a bracelet that Brianna could wear while on
vacation. Megan would have the receiver. It made Daniel
feel more secure about letting her go on this great adventure.

~We can&apos;t keep them in a bubble, no matter how tempting it is. We
... we just can&apos;t.~

Just before hanging up, Sam felt compelled to suggest, Daniel, you
could have the children chipped, like we were.

Yeah, I&apos;ve thought about that, Sam, but ... there are concerns, the
archaeologist intoned quietly.

The Trust?

Or worse. I know chipping would have advantages, but it would
open up some unpleasant possibilities for our children, and I&apos;m not
sure it&apos;s a good idea, especially ...

Daniel paused, smiling into his phone.

Sam chuckled lightly, Especially when you have an astrophysicist who
loves to create new doohickeys?

Unable to stop his laughter, Daniel answered, Apparently. Do you
mind?

If I did, I wouldn&apos;t do it. I think you and the general are
probably right, Daniel. I wish we didn&apos;t have to think that way,
though, the blonde opined.

Yeah, me, too. Thanks again, Sam, Daniel spoke before
disconnecting the call. ~I should mention it to Jack,
though. We should consider chipping them, but ... gawd, what if
the wrong people got access to their codes?~

====

So what&apos;s new? Daniel asked as he and Jack entered Brianna&apos;s room for
their nightly special time with their daughter.

Daddy, can we study something besides history for a while? I
don&apos;t mean forever, but just for a while? the young girl politely
asked.

Why? Daniel inquired.

Brianna shrugged and finally answered, I&apos;m not really into history,
and it seems like that&apos;s all we&apos;ve done lately.

Okay, well, we can study something else, Daniel agreed. Uh,
what would you like to learn about?

Shyly, Brianna looked down as she clutched her pillow to her
chest. Her parents were seated, facing her, one on each side of
the bed.

How about ... life sciences? Daniel asked coyly.

Science? Brianna echoed with a shrug.

Well, I was thinking more along the lines of ... marine science,
Daniel explained.

Oh, well ... Suddenly, Brianna brightened as the words sank
it. She looked up at Daniel and saw his grin. Marine
science as in ... in ...

Mammals -- whales, dolphins ... Daniel began.

Critters that swim, Jack teased.

Do you mean it? Really? Seeing Daniel&apos;s nod, Brianna
jumped into his arms, saying, That would be so cool, Daddy.

How cool would it be to swim with a dolphin? Jack asked.

Brianna pushed away from Daniel slightly, though her hands slid down to
his. She looked at Jack with wonder and then over at
Daniel. Her heart was thundering with anticipation.

Bri, Megan told us that you&apos;re interested in dolphins, Daniel began.

And, Jack continued, she&apos;s invited you to go on her vacation with
her so you could ...

OH MY ... swim with the dolphins? Brianna jumped up and began
running around her room. She screamed enthusiastically and then
said, You&apos;re not kidding?

The smiling fathers turned to face her, now that Brianna was in front
of her door.

No, Bri, Jack answered. Daddy and I have discussed it, and we
have a few things we need to make sure you understand, but if you&apos;d
like to go ...

Oh, yes, YES! YES! YES! Brianna shouted, running forward
to hug both of her fathers.

Just then, several of her brothers and sisters ran in, having heard the
screams, and Brianna began to joyfully tell them about her good fortune.

**I hope we&apos;re not making a mistake, Danny.**

**Look at her, Babe. For that smile, we just need to make sure we
take all the precautions we can.**

====
 
The next couple of days were filled with talk about dolphins. Brianna had taken to their marine science studies, in Jack&apos;s words,
like a fish to water. She had begun spouting dolphin facts at anyone
who would listen:

Did you know there are thirty-two types of dolphins?
Guess what? Dolphins can taste, but they have no sense of smell.
Wow, dolphins can swim up to forty miles an hour? They even have
a special skin for swimming that reduces turbulence.

We made the right decision, Jack, Daniel said when the lovers were
alone.

I know, Danny, but if we haven&apos;t found him by the time she&apos;s due to
leave, we can&apos;t let her go, Jack regretfully stated about their
ongoing August nightmare.

Despite Brianna&apos;s obvious excitement over the trip, both Jack and
Daniel were tempted to cancel it, now that they knew who had been
stalking them. The previous day, Chenoa had seen the man while at
her gym class, and the information they had gleaned from the
instructors had been sufficient for Jack to recognize the man as Burton
Taylor, someone from his Special Ops days who blamed Jack for the death
of his family.

Daniel sighed, Let&apos;s just hope we find him soon. We can&apos;t keep
the brood under lockdown indefinitely.

Jack gave his husband a wry grin. Jennifer was not enjoying
having to be accompanied everywhere by a chaperone and had referred to
the increased security measures Jack and Daniel had taken as a
precaution against Burton Taylor as putting the brood under &apos;lockdown.&apos;

Danny, what if we have the brood chipped? Jack wondered.

You mean with those locator beacons we had implanted? Daniel
inquired. ~I should have known Jack would think of it, too.~

Yeah. We have the girls chipped, Jack reminded about Bijou and
Katie, both of whom had chips inserted in case something ever happened
to them.

We could, Daniel spoke quietly. I ... Jack, I have given it
some thought lately.

But ... Jack prodded. You don&apos;t sound like it&apos;s a good idea,
he surmised, scratching his hand for a moment to alleviate an
itch. ~Not sure I do, either, but it is a solution to our
worries.~

It&apos;s a great idea, except ...

The government, Jack supposed. ~Which is why I haven&apos;t
mentioned it before.~

Nodding, Daniel said, I can&apos;t help it, Jack. If we chipped the
children, and someone like Kinsey got a hold of the tracking
information, then ...

Then we could be inviting disaster, Jack completed for his husband.

Sam might be able to rig it herself, but ...

Still a risk, Jack responded. At least Bean Sprout is easy to protect at the moment, he mused, looking down at the womis.

Daniel reached out and caressed the pouch carrying their child. Every time he looked at the growing womis, he was filled with a sense of
awe.

I still can&apos;t believe it, Jack. That&apos;s our child in there, yours
and mine, the younger man softly spoke with awe.

Jack pulled Daniel closer with one arm and reached out with the other
to join Daniel in caressing the womis as he spoke, We love you, Son.

Or daughter, whichever you are, Daniel added, glancing momentarily at
Jack as he smiled.

We can&apos;t wait to meet you, Jack said. We love you, Bean
Sprout.
 
Daniel turned around and snuggled into his lover&apos;s arms, saying, We&apos;ll
be all right, Jack.

Jack just nodded as the two enjoyed some quiet time with their unborn
child.

====

On Saturday, Jack, Daniel, and their brood happily cheered on
Chenoa and Lulu at their dance recital. The two sisters beamed to
the applause that came their way.

The next day, Daniel was sitting with Aislinn in the music room. They were at the piano, and Aislinn was practicing a new song.

Not so hard, Ash, Daniel advised. Feel the song in your heart,
and let the emotion you feel come out through your fingers.

Aislinn giggled, That sounds funny, Daddy.

Yeah, I guess it does, Daniel agreed with a chuckle. Try it
again, but try not to think so much. Let your heart guide you.

Daniel looked up and saw Jack standing in the doorway.

**She&apos;s pretty good, Danny.**

**She could be; if she can let herself feel the music more,** Daniel
spoke via their non-verbal communication.

**This sounds better.**

That&apos;s good, Ash, Daniel told his daughter, who smiled as she kept on
playing.

Hey, Ash, that&apos;s great, David said, brushing by Jack as he entered
the room and headed for his guitar. Can I play with you?

Sure, Aislinn answered. I&apos;ll start over. The little
girl waited for her brother to strap on his guitar, and then she began
the piece again. Don&apos;t play too loud, Aislinn called over to
David.

I won&apos;t, David answered, quickly adding, Ash, play it one
time. I only heard part of it.

Okay, Aislinn said as she played the song one time and then paused.

Ready, Ash. One ... two ... three ... David prompted.

Together, the siblings began to make music together. Aislinn
missed a few notes here and there, but David never missed a beat as he
accompanied her on the guitar.

**I can&apos;t believe he can play by ear like that,** Jack communicated
silently.

**I have always envied people who could do that,** Daniel responded as
he listened.

Are we making music? Jonny asked as he ran in. Wait for me!
the little boy said without waiting for an answer.

**Daniel, where are the earplugs?** Jack said as he looked around the
room in a small panic.

Daniel chuckled lightly and shook his head. He looked over at
Jonny, who was getting himself settled in on his stool.

Come on, little brother, David encouraged.

Jonny banged on a cymbal as he began to play the drums.

**Okay, he needs more lessons. I&apos;m calling an instructor
tomorrow,** Jack announced as he grimaced, but then smiled when Jonny
looked over at him.

Jonny, not so loud, Aislinn admonished.

**Thank goodness for girls,** Jack said.

**And little boys,** Daniel said. He put his hand on the back of
Aislinn&apos;s head as he stood up. Smiling down at her, he slowly
began to move away, going over to where Jonny was. He positioned
himself behind the child and then quietly began to say. Feel the
music, Jonny. Listen to Ash; she&apos;s got the melody. This is
a quiet piece. It&apos;s about love and gentleness, like at night when
you&apos;re asleep, all safe and sound in your bed. Like ... like in
the morning when you wake up and go say hello to Bogey. It&apos;s not
about shouting or jumping for joy. It&apos;s what you feel in quiet
times. I know you can do it. You&apos;re very smart. Just
... follow your sister&apos;s lead. Yeah. There you go. That&apos;s it. Softer ... little taps. How about the base drum
... now ... yeah, there you go, Son. You&apos;ve got it. Music
is in your heart and your soul. You never want to drown it out;
you want to let it become part of you.

Jack shook his head in wonder as he watched his husband coach Jonny on
playing the drums. Daniel hadn&apos;t a clue how to play the drums,
but he understood music ~and little boys,~ Jack thought with a smile.

**I love you, Angel.**

Daniel looked up and smiled brightly and then continued to guide their
little drummer boy.

====

Danny, Jack called out as he walked into the kitchen where Daniel was
preparing lunch.

After a peaceful weekend, the Jackson-O&apos;Neills were back into their
weekday routine.

Hey, how did the lesson go? Daniel asked, seeing his lover enter.

Jack had been giving the twins a lesson in biology, specifically
dolphin biology since dolphins seemed to be the current fad in the
household.

Good, Jack answered a bit distractedly. They&apos;re doing their
English assignment now. I just checked on the Munchkins.

There was something in Jack&apos;s tone that made Daniel turn around and
look at his husband.

What mischief have they got up to this time? the younger man asked
suspiciously.

Jack chuckled, Nothing. Little Danny had already finished his
math assignment so guess what he&apos;s doing -- making a set of passports
for the animals of the house, complete with paw prints, photos, and
everything.

Daniel smiled and shook his head. Then, he started giggling.

Arms slid around Daniel&apos;s waist as Jack whispered in his ear, What&apos;s
so funny?

Your face when the brood brought out the animals to be paw printed,
Daniel answered, remembering the chaos of the day the previous week
when Sam had taken the family&apos;s fingerprints as a safety
precaution. The brood had insisted that Sam also take prints from
the animal family members, even including Jonny&apos;s pet lizard. I&apos;m surprised Sam didn&apos;t mutiny.

She wouldn&apos;t dare, the older man spoke confidently. After a
chuckle, he observed, I guess Bri&apos;s trip made him think of passports.

Jack was startled when Daniel tensed and dashed into the living room
muttering, He wouldn&apos;t. Would he? No, maybe.

Completely bewildered by his husband&apos;s behavior, Jack followed Daniel
as he ran from the living room up the stairs to the boys&apos; room.

He did, Daniel sighed as he stood in the doorway, covering his
eyes.

As Jack peered into the room and took a closer look at Little Danny&apos;s &apos;passports&apos;, he understood why and exclaimed a mental, ~Crap!~

Ah, Son, Jack said, kneeling beside the little boy and surveying the
damage. He picked up what had been his own passport and flicked
through it. Next to his name, Little Danny had added in Bijou and
Katie&apos;s names. Opposite Jack&apos;s photo were pictures of the two
beagles. He picked up Daniel&apos;s passport and grinned despite
himself. Written beside Daniel&apos;s name were all the names of the
various family fish. A photo of the aquarium had been added to
the passport. Little Danny, how did you get these?

Neither Jack nor Daniel could understand how the Munchkin had gotten a
hold of them as they were usually kept safely in the study.

Little Danny looked guilty as he answered, I took them from the study
when Daddy got them out to look for the passport app&apos;cation for Bri.

Daniel closed his eyes and groaned. He remembered going into the
study to get the passport application, pulling out the passports which
were with it, and then being distracted by the twins before he could
put them back. He&apos;d meant to put them back later but had
forgotten.

Jack struggled to contain his amusement as he and Daniel explained to
Little Danny that he shouldn&apos;t ever take papers from the study without
permission, and if he ever thought any members of the family were
missing something, like passports, he should tell his fathers and they
would sort it out.

Daniel looked at his son and smiled, saying, Okay, so we need more
information on the fish. I mean, uh, the passport isn&apos;t complete.

Little Danny grinned as Daniel began to help him complete the passports
for the animals.

**Danny?**

**They&apos;re already destroyed, Jack, and we can get new ones. He
knows he made a mistake. Why punish him more?**

**I love you, Angel,** Jack communicated as he moved forward to help
with the animal passports.

====

Danny, calm down, Jack said late Wednesday evening as they stood
together on the roof deck outside their master bedroom. Burton
Taylor had died in his attempts to get his revenge on Jack, and the
latest threat to the Jackson-O&apos;Neill family was over. Brianna&apos;s
upcoming &apos;swim with the dolphins&apos; trip was a &apos;go&apos;, but on this night,
Daniel was not only tired, but disconcerted. It&apos;s okay, Jack
soothed.

I know, but it&apos;s, uh, unnerving, Daniel commented.

Jack chuckled, I&apos;m trying not to think about it.

Our daughter, Daniel lamented about Jennifer.

Danny, I don&apos;t think she stayed long, Jack tried to assure his
husband.

She saw enough, the younger man sighed.

Jennifer had unexpectedly walked out onto the roof deck last night when
the two soulmates were communicating with their bodies. All
morning she had giggled at her fathers, unable to look either of them
in the eye, until finally she admitted having seen them &apos;in the act&apos; on
the roof deck. Daniel, of course, was embarrassed. Jack
simply went to the hardware store to get a new lock for the door
leading to the roof deck, one that they could use from the deck and
ensure this didn&apos;t happen again.

We&apos;re not the first parents to be caught by their kids, and we won&apos;t
be the last. She&apos;ll live, and so will we, Jack noted with a
smile.

Jack, remember the children after they did their play? Daniel asked.

Jack was taken aback and gave his lover a funny look as he tried to
figure out how the conversation had turned to the play.

Danny, what does the play have to do with anything? Jack asked.

Daniel chuckled, I was just thinking. There they were, all
gathered in front of the monitor in the living room, talking to Bean
Sprout, sharing their feelings about doing their first play together.

Jack laughed, Jonny promised Bean Sprout he&apos;d let him be the lead
soldier in the first production that Bean Sprout is old enough to hold
a fake sword.

Lulu reminded Jonny the baby might be a girl, Daniel recalled.

Yeah, I&apos;m afraid Jonny has his heart set on another little brother,
Jack commented. That little frown he gave was priceless, kinda
like when we gave him sushi that time.

Even I don&apos;t like sushi, Babe, Daniel noted, cringing at the notion.

~Sexy even when he shivers like that.~ Jack took his lover in his
arms and kissed him, resulting in a tender moan escaping the younger
man&apos;s throat. Let&apos;s try out the new lock, Jack whispered and
then blew in Daniel&apos;s ear.

Jack, you&apos;ve *got* to be kidding! It wasn&apos;t even twennnmmmph ...

Jack silenced his lover with a slew of passionate kisses. In
lightning speed, he closed the door, locking it from the outside, and
then returned to his lover for more kisses.

As August came to a close, the married couple shared all the love they
had to give -- and that was enough to light up their world with warmth
and joy for quite some time.

====
Chapter Six: Growing Up
====

Glad to be home after a trying day full of meetings at the SGC, Jack
threw his keys onto the hall table and walked into the living
room. He smiled at the sight of Little Danny, Jonny, and Aislinn
doing their homework. None of the Munchkins had spotted him yet,
as Jonny soon showed.

Danny, what&apos;s the answer to question five? Jonny asked as he looked
at his brother hopefully, intentionally not using the &apos;Little&apos; moniker
that so often preceded the boy&apos;s name.

Little Danny sighed and shook his head as he answered, I can&apos;t tell
you, Jonny. You hafta find the answer yourself. I&apos;ll help
you work it out, though.

Jack smiled at the sight of the two heads bent over Jonny&apos;s book as
Little Danny explained how Jonny could figure out the answer.

How&apos;s it going, Munchkins? Jack inquired, revealing his presence.

Dad!

All three of the children raced over to Jack and started babbling about
their day.

Jack listened with amusement as Jonny added, Daddy said we could have
a party for our birthday, Dad.

Of course, you can, Son, Jack responded.

Jack noticed a look of disappointment sweep over Little Danny before
the boy resumed his cheerful demeanor. However, as an expert in
seeing through Daniel&apos;s &apos;I&apos;m fine&apos; masks over the years, Jack wasn&apos;t
fooled by the youngster&apos;s facade.

~It&apos;s all in the eyes, Little Danny, and right now yours are lacking
that spark that they usually have.~ He looked at Jonny and
realized Little Danny hadn&apos;t fooled the eldest Munchkin, either. Taking advantage of Aislinn&apos;s pause for breath, Jack asked, Where&apos;s
Daddy?

In the den, Jonny answered with a grin. Then he turned to his
brother and sister and said, Come on, Little Danny, Ash, let&apos;s go bury
some more stuff in Katie&apos;s play yard.

Little Danny brightened, and the three children ran off, leaving Jack
shaking his head in amusement.

~You&apos;re Little Danny&apos;s fix-it man, aren&apos;t you Jonny?~ He
considered reminding the children they had been in the middle of a
homework assignment, but decided against it. ~Little Danny needs
some playtime; I just need to find out why.~

====
 
Daniel looked up as Jack entered the den and smiled at his
husband. After a long &apos;welcome home&apos; kiss, Jack rested his
forehead against Daniel&apos;s, and the two simply stood for a while,
reconnecting.

Why is Little Danny upset about the idea of a birthday party? Jack
finally asked, breaking their silence.

Daniel sighed, He wants to invite Lya and some of the other Nox. I explained that it just wasn&apos;t possible, and he understands, but he&apos;s
disappointed all the same.

That&apos;s our boy; friend of all, including aliens, Jack teased.

Jack, he&apos;s serious. He loves the people he&apos;s met off-world,
especially the Nox. He&apos;s a little boy, and he wants the people he
cares about to be at their party.

Okay, well, we could probably have a party for the Munchkins in the
Land of the Light, Jack suggested.

Uh, Jack, I kind of already suggested that, Daniel stated hesitantly.

And? Jack prodded.

Little Danny didn&apos;t like that idea. He wants to show Lya our
house and introduce her to Bogey and the rest of the menagerie, Daniel
answered.

I don&apos;t think Anteaus is going to allow Lya and the gang to come
here, Jack commented.

No, but, uh, maybe ... Daniel began, tilting his head slightly.

Daniel, the *entire* brood? Jack asked incredulously.

Well, I contacted Thor ...

You phoned the little gray butt without asking me first? Jack asked
in mock ire.

I just wanted to see if he might be available for a ... the younger
man began.

Instant intergalactic beam, planet-to-planet? Jack quipped.

It was worth a shot, Daniel answered with a shrug.

What did he say? Jack questioned as he took a seat in the recliner at
about the same time Daniel sat back down in his desk chair.

Daniel intoned, That if he&apos;s within range, he&apos;d be happy to transport
us.

So ...

So, we need to contact the Nox and see if they&apos;d like to host a
birthday party for our children, Daniel instructed.

That should be interesting, Jack smirked. Danny, we need to
make sure the kids understand that if they choose that option, it means
none of their friends here on Earth can go. They might not like
that. Presents, or lack thereof, Jack mentioned with wide eyes.

Daniel chuckled, saying, I hadn&apos;t thought of that. We&apos;ll have to
give them the option.

We should do that first. The last thing we need is bad feelings
because our kids back out of a party due to the lack of gifts, Jack
said, standing back up. He reached down and took hold of his husband&apos;s
hand, pulling him up with the intention of them discussing the
possibilities with the Munchkins. As they reached the doorway,
though, he revealed another concern. Danny, what about the
twins? Their birthday is next week. With all that Taylor
mess, he began, referring to the stalker who had been after the family
during the previous month, we haven&apos;t had a chance to plan anything.

Good question, Jack. Why don&apos;t we talk to them and see what
they&apos;d like to do for their birthday? the younger man suggested.

Sure, we can ... Jack&apos;s words were interrupted by the telephone.

Sharing a very brief kiss with his lover, Daniel then walked back over
to his desk where he picked up the receiver, greeting, Hello.

Daniel, it&apos;s Sara.

Sara, Daniel responded with a smile. It&apos;s good to hear from
you.

Jack grinned evilly and crept up behind his husband, sliding his arms
around his waist and kissing his neck. He felt Daniel&apos;s heart
rate increase and smirked. Daniel tried edging away from his
lover, but Jack put a stop to that by pressing his body closer to
Daniel&apos;s.

... So we were wondering if the twins were doing anything for their
birthday, and if you haven&apos;t anything planned, did you want some help?
Sara continued, seemingly oblivious to the mischievous activities of
her friends.

Ah, Daniel squeaked, valiantly trying to ignore Jack&apos;s hand which was
moving towards his groin. We were just discussing that.

All right, Daniel, hand the phone to the degenerate that&apos;s currently
taking advantage of you, a knowing Sara instructed, no longer willing
to ignore the ensuing playfulness.

Daniel passed the phone to Jack, saying, She wants to talk to you.

Jack stared, noticing the mischief in his husband&apos;s eyes, but he took
the phone and, using his most innocent tone, greeted, Hey, Sara,
while moving away from Daniel.

Daniel looked at his lover and gave him an evil grin mouthing,
Paybacks, Babe, before advancing on the older man.

Jack tried moving to the other side of the desk, but found himself
quickly pushed into the recliner with a lapful of intoxicating
archeologist nibbling at his throat.

Sorry, what was that Sara? Jack asked, having no clue what his
ex-wife had said.

The soulmates heard Sara laughing into the phone as she said, Okay,
Boys, just phone me if you want some help for the twins&apos; birthday.

Thanks, Sara, Daniel called out.

Bye, Sara, Jack stated.

Jack hung up the phone and pulled his husband into a long passionate
kiss. When they eventually came up for air, both were panting,
and each had a little problem that they needed to take care of. Unfortunately, they both had children to take care of as well.

After thinking of a variety of things, from cold showers to Goa&apos;uld,
they were able to go downstairs and tend to their family obligations.

====

Do we get to have a party with the Nox? Little Danny asked, his whole
face brightening at his parents&apos; news.

We&apos;ll have to ask them first, but if they say yes, would you like
that? Daniel inquired.

Before Daniel had finished talking, Little Danny was already nodding
enthusiastically, and both Jonny and Aislinn were soon adding their
agreement.

Munchkins, you need to be sure, Jack informed them. It would
mean none of your Earth friends would be able to come, and traditions
on other worlds are very different. You may not get any
presents, he pointed out.

Jonny and Aislinn looked a little crestfallen at this, something that
didn&apos;t escape Little Danny. His smile faded a little, and he
began to chew on his lower lip, his brow furrowed in thought.

**He is such a little you, Danny,** Jack communicated with loving pride.

**Poor boy.**

**Lucky boy,** Jack mentally intoned, grinning.

**Love you, Jack.**

**Love you, too, Angel.**

Dad, Daddy, Little Danny said as he climbed onto Daniel&apos;s lap and
looked at them both with a very serious expression. I don&apos;t care
about presents, so can I have a party with the Nox and Jonny and Ash
have an Earth party? He looked at his siblings and added,
You&apos;re invited to my party!

Jack smirked, **Daniel, we&apos;ve just been had by an almost
five-year-old.**

Daniel, too, couldn&apos;t help but smile at his son&apos;s solution to their
dilemma, replying, **Just wait until they *are* five.**

Yeah, can we? Jonny and Aislinn asked eagerly, their eyes alight with
excitement.

And we&apos;ll invite Little Danny to our party, Aislinn added.

And I can give him half of my presents, Jonny volunteered, then
saying in a softer tone, But not my fighting gifts. He don&apos;t
like those anyway.

Doesn&apos;t, Daniel corrected.

Doesn&apos;t what? Jonny asked.

Never mind, the linguist decided, opting to leave grammar lessons for
another time.

Jack stared at Little Danny as a small smile formed on his face. He leaned forward and poked the little boy in his abdomen, causing
Little Danny to giggle.

You&apos;re a little con artist, you know that? Jack inquired.

Jack&apos;s answer was a knowing smile that reminded him of his husband.

**He&apos;s a little genius. Danny, we are so in trouble. He&apos;s
starting to use that brain of his to get his way; not unlike someone
else I know.**

**Oh, who would that be?** Daniel asked with a coy smile.

**Smart aleck.**

Can we, Dad, Daddy? Pleeeeease, Little Danny asked.

**Jack, we could say no. I mean, we&apos;ve always done their
birthdays together.**

**Yeah, group birthday.** Jack sighed, Munchkins, Daddy and I
need to talk about something. Go outside, please, and play with
your brothers and sisters. We&apos;ll let you know.

Obediently, the three headed for the door, Jonny and Aislinn praising
Little Danny&apos;s ingenuity as they walked. Once the Munchkins were
outside, Jack took a deep breath.

Babe, what are you thinking? Daniel asked.

That we need to make the right decision. Daniel, I was proud of
Little Danny just now. That was a pretty smart solution to their
problem, Jack praised.

Smiling, Daniel stood up and walked to Jack, remarking, Yeah, he saw
Jonny and Ash were disappointed and searched for a solution. He,
uh, found one. After a chuckle, he added, But you&apos;re concerned
that if we give in, we&apos;re setting a precedent. Separate
everything whenever it suits their purposes.

Exactly. But, there&apos;s something else, Jack stated seriously.

What? Daniel asked.

Danny, we&apos;ve worked hard to make sure the Munchkins, and the twins,
are united, but also separate.

You mean the individual play dates, their own friends, our special
days with just one or two of them -- that kind of thing? Daniel
deduced.

Yes. Angel, they deserve their own days. I want them to be
close, just like they are, but I also want them to feel ... grrr ...
Jack groaned, searching for the right words.

Like on their own, they are important and worthwhile. They are
special, each one of them, with *and* without their fellow Munchkins,
Daniel stated.

Yeah, Jack agreed.

So, Daniel said, turning around and walking a bit while he
thought. We have to decide whether it&apos;s better to reward Little
Danny&apos;s solution and subtly reinforce their individuality, or to
reaffirm that they all have the same birthday, and that&apos;s one day that
we are going to celebrate together. In other words, nice try,
Sproglet, but no go.

What do you think? Jack asked.

I think I&apos;m very proud of them, even Jonny&apos;s present solution. Gawd, giving half to Little Danny. Talk about a con artist -- he
knows we couldn&apos;t have a birthday party and not give Little Danny
presents, too. Jack, I don&apos;t know. They were both very
clever, and I&apos;m ... Daniel let out a tiny snort as he reviewed
the conversation that had happened with the triplets. I&apos;m proud
of them, but the other question is, do we let them get away with that?
If we do, I mean two parties, what about the gifts? What&apos;s the
answer, Babe?

We can&apos;t tell Jonny not to give anything to his brother, Jack
commented.

No, we can&apos;t, but do we buy just for him, or knowing what he intends,
do we buy things we know Little Danny would like?

Daniel, I have a headache, Jack groused.

Daniel smiled and admitted, Me, too.

The little genius con artists, Jack chuckled. Parenting is
tough.

Very, Daniel agreed.

It would be easier if Little Danny hadn&apos;t really meant it, Jack
admitted wryly.

You mean about not wanting presents? Daniel asked. After Jack
nodded, Daniel noted, Yeah, he really doesn&apos;t care much about material
things.

Wonder who he gets that from, Jack teased lightly.
 
Daniel looked at his soulmate and smiled as he replied, Both of us,
Jack. Our kids know what&apos;s important in life, family and people
... and animals.

I guess that kind of answers our dilemma, huh? Jack inquired.

I think so, Daniel replied. The fact that Little Danny is
willing to go without gifts and Jonny is prepared to share his presents
shows that they aren&apos;t selfishly out for all they can get.

So ... Jack prodded.

So ... we buy presents for Little Danny as well? Daniel asked, though
it was almost a rhetorical question since neither man had come to a
conclusion yet. He shook his head and chewed his lip
thoughtfully, just as his namesake had done earlier. Finally, he
suggested, I think we just make sure that in Jonny&apos;s and Ash&apos;s
presents there are things that all three of them will like, like
Legos. Only, there&apos;s, uh, another problem.

I&apos;m almost afraid to ask, Jack intoned.

What do we tell their friends? the younger man asked, his eyebrows
raised at the logical but stifling question. The children that
come to a party for Jonny and Ash are probably going to bring stuff for
Little Danny anyway, and not just that, Jack, but how do we explain
having a party for just two of the triplets?

Geez, I really am getting a headache! Jack exclaimed as he fell onto
the sofa and groaned.

Daniel chuckled, You know, I think we&apos;re making too much of
this. Let&apos;s just have the two parties. The Munchkins are
aware they might get fewer presents out of the deal and don&apos;t care, and
that&apos;s what really matters.

We still have to answer the pesky questions, Jack stated.

No, we don&apos;t. Jack, I&apos;ve got it!

You certainly do! Jack said with a shine in his eyes as he pulled
Daniel towards him for a kiss.

Are you two at it again?

The lovers broke apart upon hearing Jennifer&apos;s amused voice. Daniel blushed, and Jack smirked at their eldest daughter.

Hey, we&apos;ve earned it, Jack retaliated. Parenting is a tough
business.

Speaking of which, we need to let the Munchkins know our decision,
Daniel said as he stood up and held out his hand to help Jack up. Just follow my lead, Babe.

Jack took his lover&apos;s hand, but surprised Daniel by pulling him back
down onto his lap.

Jack! Jen&apos;s here, Daniel half-heartedly complained.

Hey, I&apos;ve seen ... well, uh, scratch that, the embarrassed teenager
said.

Jack kissed his soulmate and whispered, I love you.

I love you, too, but ...

Yeah, yeah, yeah, Jack whined.

Oh, the Beatles, right, Dad? Of course, I wasn&apos;t born
then. Actually, I&apos;m not sure Mom was, either, Jennifer spoke
about her birth mother.

Jennifer Renee, Jack mock-warned as he stood up. Smiling, he
said, Did you need something, Sweetheart?

No, I was just passing through. I wanted to get my history book
to take outside with me. It&apos;s really nice out, Jennifer
commented.

As Jennifer headed for her bedroom above the garage, her parents went
outside to talk to the Munchkins.

====

Munchkins, Dad and I have given it lots of thought, and, of course, it
all hinges on Lya and the others, but, uh, Son, Daniel said looking at
his namesake, for your present, Dad and I are giving you a trip to see
the Nox.

Oh, boy! Little Danny exclaimed.

We&apos;ll still have our party for the three of you, and there will be
presents for all of you, but Little Danny won&apos;t get as many because of
the trip off-world. Understand? Daniel asked, searching all of
their eyes for comprehension.

I&apos;m happy, Daddy. I want to see the Nox, Little Danny said with
a grin.

Good. Now if anyone asks why you don&apos;t have as many presents as
Jonny and Ash, what will you say? Daniel quizzed.

I&apos;ll say we&apos;re going on trip just for me, but I don&apos;t remember the
name of the place, Little Danny suggested.

You can say we&apos;re going to a big playground, Aislinn suggested with a
smile.

That&apos;s good, Ash, Jack praised proudly.

As the triplets went off to play, Jack grinned at his lover and said,
You come up with the best solutions, Love.

Thank you, Babe, Daniel said, leaning in for a kiss.

====

Three points! Mike Callahan exclaimed. Way to go, Jeff.

Thanks. You&apos;re up, Nick, Jeff said as he bounced the ball to
another of the boys as they continued their game of basketball after
school had let out for the day. As they played, he looked over
towards the parking lot which bordered the outdoor basketball court and
noticed a slightly older teenager watching them. ~Peter
Hamilton? Wonder what he&apos;s doing here?~

====

Thanks for the pickup, Daddy, Jennifer said as she settled in to the
Silver Fox and buckled her seatbelt.

You&apos;re welcome, Jen. Daniel headed for home, chitchatting with
Jennifer about her day. After a while, he asked, Jen, school&apos;s
been in session a couple of weeks now, and I was just wondering if
you&apos;ve seen Peter?

Peter? The teenager looked down and then out the window. After a pause, she said, I haven&apos;t seen him. We don&apos;t really
circulate with the same group of friends, Daddy. I&apos;m not even
sure he&apos;s still going to school here.

Are you okay with that? Daniel inquired as he made a left turn.

Jennifer let out a tiny snort and said a bit flippantly, I don&apos;t
really care what he ... Suddenly, she stopped and looked at her
father. Daddy, I liked him. I liked him a lot, but he
wasn&apos;t who I thought he was. I miss him, but then I get angry
because I realize that who I&apos;m missing isn&apos;t real.

Are you sure? Daniel queried.

Yes; he&apos;s a jerk, Jennifer responded harshly, her left hand gripping
her backpack tightly. But there is a cute new boy in school,
she noted perkily. His name is Todd, and he&apos;s so polite and
dreamy. He&apos;s in my science class and ...

Daniel smiled. He was proud of Jennifer for moving forward and
for doing so as honestly as she could. At the same time, he
wondered just how over Peter she really was.

====

From his vantage point in the kitchen, Jack watched with curiosity as
the Munchkins, Spitfires, Chenoa, and Lulu earnestly worked on their
latest project. Cardboard boxes, paper, crayons, children&apos;s
scissors, glue, and sticky tape were strewn about the living room.

This not look right, Little Danny, Jenny complained as she waved the
piece of paper she&apos;d been drawing on at her brother.

The little boy grinned at Jenny and passed her the piece of paper he&apos;d
just finished drawing on, suggesting, That&apos;s okay, Jenny. You
can color this one, and I&apos;ll draw that for you.

Jack shook his head in amusement. He&apos;d been certain the kids
would have tired of this project by now.

~Should have known better. They&apos;re all as stubborn as their
parents,~ Jack thought in amusement.

Ricky!
 
The exasperated voice of Aislinn was accompanied by the sound of
giggles. Jack looked at the children again and had to stifle his own
laughter at the sight of Ricky, who had somehow managed to glue a
cardboard box to his head. As the youngster began to tug at it,
Jack moved swiftly into the room. He really didn&apos;t need Ricky to
pull out all his hair, not on his watch anyway.

~Danny would kill me.~ As he worked on the problem, Jack asked,
Son, how did you manage to glue a box to your head?

Ricky looked up at his father sheepishly, answering, It&apos;s a hat. I forgot glue on it.

Of course, you did, Jack responded dryly. ~Makes perfect sense
-- when you&apos;re not quite four.~ After examining the box and
finding that Ricky had done a fairly thorough job of gluing his hair to
the box, Jack determined, We&apos;re going to have to soak it off.

At that moment, the front door opened. As soon as Jennifer had
stepped inside, she was surrounded by her younger siblings and being
dragged over to the &apos;project&apos; to help.

After greeting his husband, Daniel surveyed the busy brood, none of
whom had said a word to him as of yet.

**Glad to see they missed me.**

**I missed you, Angel.**

As if he&apos;d heard the unspoken exchange, Little Danny looked up at his
father and grinned, saying, Hi, Daddy!

A chorus of Missed you, Daddy and similar greetings followed. Daniel just stared at them and waved back weakly.

You don&apos;t think he heard, do you, Jack? Daniel asked once the
children had become engaged in their activities again.

Geez, I hope not, Jack quietly answered. Neither man wanted to
share their silent means of communication, even with their
children. I think it&apos;s just Little Danny being perceptive, as
usual.

What are they doing, anyway? And why does Ricky have a box that
looks like a hat glued to his head? Daniel inquired casually,
wondering if he&apos;d be better off leaving and re-entering the house again.

Jack laughed, saying, At least you knew it was a hat. After a
pause, he explained, They&apos;re making a model of the house to show the
Nox.

Daniel looked at Jack with a wry grin, asking, Little Danny&apos;s idea?

Jack nodded and replied, They&apos;re enjoying themselves, though. Giving his lover a smile, he added, I&apos;d better get that hat off Ricky.

Sure thing, Babe.

====

Having survived the twins&apos; birthday celebration on the eighth, Jack and
Daniel were continuing their preparations for the Munchkins&apos;
party. They still hadn&apos;t heard back from the Nox, and that was of
concern as both men were afraid of disappointing Little Danny.

Today, though, the little boy was contently playing outside with Carrie
Lapierre. Her parents, Stuart and Grace, had dropped her and her
dog, Tito, off at the Jackson-O&apos;Neills for an all-day play session.

Little Danny had met Carrie at a play camp two years earlier at a time
when the Jackson-O&apos;Neill residence was about to be expanded to better
accommodate the growing family. Jack and Daniel had bought the
property next door and planned on demolishing the house so that they
could simply add on to their own home. Little Danny, however, had
given his parents the idea of donating that home to the Lapierres, who
were in the process of being evicted from their then-residence.

The two families had become good friends, and the Lapierres were now
back on their feet and doing well. In fact, Grace was pregnant,
and Stu was beaming with pride about the upcoming birth.

Carrie, do you want a baby brother or sister? Little Danny asked as
he and Carrie played on the swings.

I want one of each, the little girl announced.

Little Danny laughed, saying, Lots of brothers and sisters is good.

Mommy says we&apos;re just having one, though. She has big, big
tummy. I think two! Carrie insisted.

Uh oh, Little Danny said, looking over at Katie&apos;s play yard.

What wrong, Little Danny? Carrie asked, slowing her swings since her
friend was doing the same thing.

That&apos;s Katie favorite toy, Little Danny announced.

Over by Katie&apos;s play yard, the youngest beagle and Tito, a basset
hound, were playing tug-a-war on the large tug toy. Both were
growling.

Be right back, Little Danny told Carrie. He marched over to the
play yard and put his hands on his hips. He made a &apos;hmmph&apos; sound,
but the dogs continued their war. Finally, Little Danny frowned
and said, Katie, Tito is a guest. Be nice.

Grrrr, Katie responded.

Katie! Tito&apos;s company!

Grrrrr ... Katie said, letting go of the toy, resulting in Tito
flying backwards slightly.

Katie seemed to smile and triumphantly trotted over to her doghouse,
lying down in a favorite spot. Bijou yawned and then licked
Katie&apos;s ear before going back to sleep.

Feeling victorious, Tito paraded around the backyard, carrying the tug
toy.

Little Danny walked over to Katie, knelt down, and gave her a
hug. He whispered, Always have to be nice to company. Love
you, Katie. You and Bij&apos; are best dogs in whole universe!

Katie gave the little boy three huge, wet kisses on his face, prompting
him to laugh. Then he got up and returned to the swing set.

Carrie, want me to push you? Little Danny asked gallantly.

Okay. I like to go high, the little girl replied.

Me, too, especially when you&apos;re here, the youngster responded
gleefully.

Carrie smiled as the two continued their day together.

====

Do you think we should tell Little Danny, Jack? the archaeologist
asked warily.

Daniel was lying in his favorite position, his head resting on Jack&apos;s
chest, listening to his husband&apos;s strong heartbeat. Another day
had gone by without them hearing from the Nox, and it wasn&apos;t looking
promising. They&apos;d even called Thor and asked him to check in with
the Nox, but hadn&apos;t heard back from him, either. If they didn&apos;t
hear something soon, they would have to cancel the party with the Nox,
and neither wanted to see the disappointment on their son&apos;s face if
that happened.

Let&apos;s wait until Thor gets back to us, Jack sighed in response.

I&apos;m worried, Jack. It&apos;s not like the Nox to not respond to one
of our messages, Daniel commented.

I know, Angel, but the Nox can take care of themselves, even if they
are still too trusting sometimes, the older man opined. ~Took us
a long time to figure that one out.~

The two talked a little longer before talking led to other
things. It was just after they&apos;d climaxed that a bright light
flashed, and a little gray alien appeared. Daniel was the first
to notice the appearance of the Asgard.

Thor, Daniel squeaked. ~I thought he knew better than to show
up unannounced in our bedroom. Oh, well; after all these years,
he&apos;s seen it all.~

Noooo, I&apos;m Jack. Should I be offended, Danny? I hope you
weren&apos;t thinking of Thor while we...ooomph.

Jack suddenly found a hand across his mouth as a blushing Daniel
whispered in his ear, Idiot, Thor is here.

Hey, I&apos;m not an ... Thor? Jack asked quietly.

O&apos;Neill, Thor spoke just as Jack turned to face him.

Hey, Thor, how are you, ole buddy? Jack asked as he pulled up a
sheet, sat up, and turned on the nightstand light.

I am well, O&apos;Neill. Have you finished, or should I come back
later? the nonplussed alien asked.

Daniel blushed an even brighter red and hid his face behind Jack.

Jack smirked, It&apos;s okay Thor. We&apos;ve finished, for now.

Jack grunted as Daniel elbowed him. Deciding he&apos;d better not push
his luck, Jack turned serious, asking, Are the Nox all right?

I was unable to contact them, Thor answered.

Daniel sat up, putting on his glasses, and making sure his bottom half
was covered.

Thor, this is unusual, isn&apos;t it? I mean, uh, normally they
answer their messages, Daniel remarked.

They did not answer ours. I shall continue to try and make
contact, but now, I must go. Carry on, Thor said as he
disappeared via the usual beam of light that transported him back to
his ship.

Jack, what are we going to do? Daniel asked.

With a heavy sigh, Jack answered, Sleep.

You&apos;re worried, too, aren&apos;t you? Daniel inquired.

Saying nothing, Jack flipped off the light and settled down into bed,
with Daniel following suit. Lovemaking had left their minds,
replaced by concern for their friends, the Nox, and the potential
disappointment for their son, Little Danny.

====

The next day, a battle was brewing inside the SGC. On one side,
there was the Munchkins, led by a glaring Jonny, his arms folded in
mutiny. On the other side, there was General Jack
Jackson-O&apos;Neill, leaning against the edge of his desk, trying to be
nonchalant while still being in command of the potentially disruptive
troops.

Jonny, remember, you promised, Jack reminded the eldest Munchkin.

That was a long time ago, Dad. We&apos;re not babies anymore, Jonny
refuted.

Yeah, Little Danny agreed, joining his brother in the same rebellious
stance. We&apos;re almost five, Dad!

We know how to behave, Aislinn argued as she moved between her
brothers, bumping Jonny to his left. She ignored his glare, and
he quickly resumed his posture. We&apos;re too big now, Dad!

Jack grunted as he stared at the triplets. They had accompanied
their parents to the SGC, and at the moment, Daniel was in a meeting
while Jack needed to concentrate on his duties. He had intended
to put the children into ToddlerTown, the large, portable playpen-type
structure that was kept at the SGC.

A year ago, the children had rebelled at being put in the ToddlerTown
used at the family home, promising to listen and behave. They
had, but their parents had also made them promise to continue using
ToddlerTown at the SGC, without argument, which they had, until
today. With Nyan, who oftentimes watched the children at the
secured facility when both Jack and Daniel were occupied, off-world for
a few days, Jack was on his own. He was grateful that the twins
were under the watchful eye of Mrs. Valissi for the day, while the rest
of the children were at school or various homeschooling and Kinder Camp
programs.

Okay, Jack said, kneeling down to look at his defiant children. Listen to me very carefully. I&apos;m going to give you a trial run,
but I have a lot to do, and I don&apos;t have time to go chasing after you
today. Jack stared at Jonny, seeing the internal
disappointment. Dad has a lot of deadlines today, so this is how
it&apos;s going to go. You *know* the rules. You stay right
where ToddlerTown would be, play with your toys, and be as quiet as
possible unless you really need me. If you can do that today,
I&apos;ll talk to Daddy about working out a new alternative for when you
come to work with us.

Yay! the three youngsters cheered, clapping excitedly.

But! Jack quickly interjected. If I have to go chasing after
you; if you get in my work things; or break any of the other rules,
which you also know, then it&apos;s back in ToddlerTown, no arguments, until
Daddy and I decide you&apos;re old enough. Deal?

The Munchkins circled together, hunched forward in a huddle, their arms
around each other&apos;s shoulders. When they were done, they clasped
their hands together and called out in unison, Munchkin Power!

Jack couldn&apos;t help but laugh. The triplets had long huddled
together to make decisions, but now they were finishing their huddle
with the Munchkin Power phrase, and he had no clue where or who they
had gotten it from.

~Watching football maybe,~ Jack silently deduced as he tried not to
laugh too overtly.

Deal! Jonny answered for the three.

Okay, go to it! Jack agreed with a confirming nod. He got up
and returned to his desk. ~This is either going to be great, or
Danny&apos;s going to kill me, and I&apos;ll be sleeping on the sofa tonight.~

====

Ninety minutes later, as Jack was on the phone with the Academy
discussing potential recruits, Daniel hurried in. He was out of
breath, clearly having hurried to his lover&apos;s office. He stood in
the doorway, one hand on the edge of the doorframe. Quickly, he
looked over and saw his children, obediently playing.

Daniel grimaced, realizing they weren&apos;t in ToddlerTown, but right now,
he didn&apos;t have time to think much about it. He nodded over at the
children, and as he did, Grace Satterfield walked by him, heading over
the triplets and sitting down to play with them. She covertly
looked up at Daniel and nodded.

Jack, Daniel called out quietly. Before Jack could respond,
Daniel silently communicated, **It&apos;s the Nox. Come on.**

In a flash, Jack ended his call, told the children to stay with Grace
and mind, and then followed Daniel towards the control room.

Daniel, what&apos;s going on? the older man asked urgently.

I have no idea, Daniel responded, his fast pace turning into a jog.

The two arrived in the gate room, just in time to see a MALP disappear
through the event horizon. As it emerged on the Nox home world,
General Hammond entered the room.

Sir, what the heck is going on? Jack asked, getting rather frustrated
at not knowing what was happening.

Hammond explained, We received a message from the Tok&apos;ra.

Jack rolled his eyes and muttered, That&apos;s never good news.

Jack, they aren&apos;t that bad, Daniel protested. When his husband
gave him a Teal&apos;c-like raised eyebrow, Daniel shrugged and turned back
to Hammond and inquired, What do the Tok&apos;ra have to do with the Nox?

Hammond responded, They&apos;ve heard murmurings about a new Goa&apos;uld,
someone called Nike.

As in my shoes? Jack snorted.

More likely as in the Greek goddess, personification of victory,
Nike, Daniel surmised, ignoring Jack&apos;s smirk.

Hammond nodded at Daniel and continued, Apparently, this Goa&apos;uld knows
of the Nox and a few other races like them. She believes that if
she can enslave them, she&apos;ll be able to increase her power base and
become a new System Lord.

MALP transmission commencing, the tech in the control room announced.

As they watched, the MALP&apos;s pictures transmitted the presence of
several Jaffa standing in the distance.

What&apos;s going on? Sam asked as she entered the gate room.

The shoe goddess wants royalties, Jack quipped.

Seeing Sam&apos;s confusion, Daniel explained, Apparently, Nike wants to be
a System Lord.

Nike? Sam questioned. Isn&apos;t she the goddess of victory? I mean, I thought she was associated with good fortune and good luck.

Apparently not, Daniel said dryly. Uh oh, he added, seeing
the oncoming Goa&apos;uld-infested Jaffa pointing their staff weapons at the
just-discovered MALP. A second later, the MALP was
destroyed. What now? Daniel asked.

We go in, Jack suggested boldly.

Jack, it&apos;s too risky, Hammond said. They&apos;ve got the Gate
covered.

There&apos;s always a Plan B. What about a Tok&apos;ra ship? Jack asked.

Colonel Carter, make the inquiries, Hammond ordered. We&apos;ll
meet in thirty minutes. I want options, People!

As Hammond turned and exited the control room and Sam began contacting
the Tok&apos;ra, Jack motioned for Daniel to follow him into the corridor
where he suggested, Danny, I think we should have Satterfield take the
Munchkins to J-O. Megan can watch them.

Daniel nodded, saying, She&apos;s supposed to meet with Mister Mortimer
today, but that can be rescheduled, unless she thinks she can handle it
with the children along.

Have her pull Karissa off the Tryson Project. We have plenty of
time to get that done, Jack stated.

Smiling, the younger man replied, Very good, my genius.

====

Having said their good-byes to their children who were being taken to
J-O Enterprises by Grace, Jack and Daniel went to the briefing room to
review the situation on the Nox home world. With the Stargate
guarded by the Goa&apos;uld and all Earth ships out of range, their only way
to gain access to the planet was via a Tok&apos;ra vessel.

If we gate to PX9-771, Sam began, a Tok&apos;ra ship can pick us
up. It&apos;ll still take about six hours to reach the Nox planet,
though.

General, Hammond began, leaning forward to look at Jack
intently. The intel already given to us and our MALP
transmissions indicate that the planet may have significant Goa&apos;uld
forces present. I&apos;m not sure we should tackle this one.

What choice do we have? Jack challenged. It&apos;s the Nox; they
believe in everyone. If this Nike is there, we have to
help. I recommend we take three teams on the ship, and you
standby here with four others ready to go on our command.

Doctor Jackson, what do you know about Nike? Hammond inquired.

Nike was the Greek goddess of victory and triumph. She, uh, was
the daughter of Pallas and Styx, and as clichéas it sounds,
General, Daniel noted, she was noted for being a fast runner. As far as we know, she didn&apos;t have any powers except for her
speed. She&apos;s often linked to Athena, and ...

Daniel, Jack interrupted as he sat back in his chair. She
sounds like a princess. Why would a *good* goddess want to
enslave the Nox?

Jack gave his lover a pointed look, but Daniel just tilted his head in
wonderment.

Hammond paused as he considered their discussion; then he nodded,
saying, Colonel Carter, notify the Tok&apos;ra of our intent to rendezvous
with them in one hour.

Yes, Sir, Sam responded, getting up and exiting the room.

We&apos;ll get ready, Jack said.

We will? Daniel asked.

Let&apos;s gear up. Teal&apos;c, those new ... Jack began.

Jack, can I talk to you for a minute, Daniel requested firmly. Excuse us, Daniel said, leading his lover to the most secluded nearby
corner he could find.

Daniel, what&apos;s wrong?

You&apos;re just dying to go in there, guns a blazing, aren&apos;t you? Daniel
challenged.

Daniel, what are you talking about? The Nox are in trouble; we
have to go in, Jack quietly argued.

Do we? Jack, the Nox can make themselves invisible. They&apos;ve told us over and over again not to be concerned about their
welfare, and they&apos;ve always been right, Daniel reminded.

What do you want us to do? Leave the Nox to fend for
themselves? Jack questioned a bit angrily.

They can take care of themselves, the archaeologist insisted.

Daniel ...

Jack, why are *we* going in? Daniel asked poignantly. We
aren&apos;t supposed to be doing these kinds of missions, remember?

We ... Jack sighed in defeat.

Daniel smiled, saying softly, You miss it, don&apos;t you? No, wait,
listen. I&apos;m not saying you regret our decision or our life, but
you&apos;re military through and through, and a little part of you misses
the big battles, going through the Gate with all that fire power so you
can play war for a while. Isn&apos;t that the truth?

Jack groaned as he ran his right hand through his hair and then took a
big breath, finally acquiescing, I guess you&apos;re right. We&apos;ll
have SG-3 lead ...

No, Daniel interrupted. We&apos;ll go.

But ...

Jack, I just wanted you to realize why you were so quick on the
bandwagon to put our lives at risk, but, uh, the truth us, I think we
should go, too, Daniel admitted.

But I thought you said the Nox could take care of themselves? Jack
quietly challenged.

They can ... I think ... I hope, but they are our allies and our
friends, and I don&apos;t believe we should take chances. We owe
them, Daniel remarked. Come on. He walked back into the
briefing room, calling out, Teal&apos;c, let&apos;s gear up.

Teal&apos;c and Hammond exchanged a look, neither really questioning the
short chat between their friends. They&apos;d both gotten used to Jack
and Daniel&apos;s quirks a long time ago.

General, is the Doc scheduled in today? Jack asked.

In two hours, Hammond answered. Jack, where are the children?

After being told the current location of the brood, Hammond assured the
couple that he&apos;d make sure they were properly cared for. He had
all the usual numbers, of course, and would confer with the other
regular babysitters to ensure all the children were safe and sound
while their parents were gone.

====

At J-O Headquarters, Little Danny was sitting quietly, ostensibly
reading a book. Jonny and Aislinn were playing a game of
Snap. Upstairs, in Daniel&apos;s office, Brianna and David were
studying and doing their homework assignments. The rest of the
brood were either at school or with other caregivers.

As she worked on her laptop, doing some research, Karissa was watching
over the Munchkins in the newly built basement playroom.

Little Danny sighed and tried once again to concentrate on his
book. It was no good. His mind kept on going back to his
parents. He was sure something was up and was pretty sure his
parents hadn&apos;t been entirely honest with them.

~They were worried. Dad and Daddy didn&apos;t tell us the whole
truth,~ the little boy silently determined.

 //Flashback//
Okay, Munchkins, listen up. Daddy and I have to go through the
Stargate for a little while, so Grace is going to take you all to J-O,
and Megan&apos;s going to look after you until we get back, Jack said as he
ruffled Jonny&apos;s hair and smiled reassuringly at the children.

When will you get back? Aislinn asked.

We&apos;re not sure, Princess, but we&apos;ll be back as soon as we can, Jack
answered.

Is everything all right, Dad? Little Danny asked as he looked up at
his parents, concern evident in his blue eyes.

The little boy didn&apos;t miss the quick glance his parents gave each other
before Jack bent down and pulled the boy into a hug.

I&apos;m sure it will be, Son, Jack said reassuringly.
 //End Flashback//

 While he had accepted his father&apos;s assurances, Little Danny hadn&apos;t
quite believed them.

~They didn&apos;t want to worry us,~ Little Danny thought. His brows
furrowed as his brain raced to make sense of what he knew -- his
parents were concerned and had made an unplanned trip through the
Stargate. He also remembered that no one had mentioned the Nox in
a while. ~Lya, Anteaus -- something is wrong with the Nox.~

Little Danny, you okay? Jonny asked, looking over from where he was
playing and seeing the worried expression on his sibling&apos;s face.

Not wanting his brother to worry, Little Danny mustered up a smile and
nodded, watching as Jonny went back to playing with Aislinn.

~The Nox are in trouble.~ Little Danny returned to his internal
debate. He wasn&apos;t certain why he was suddenly so sure that he was
right, he just knew that he was. ~Dad and Daddy have gone to help
the Nox. They must be in really big trouble and ... and ...~

The boy drew in a shaky breath. From listening to his parents, he
knew the Nox were very powerful and could take care of
themselves. If they were so powerful, though, then why did his
parents need to go and help them? Little Danny&apos;s imagination
began to take over. He thought back on the story Jack had told
Jonny, about the bad people in the universe.

~Glowy eyes ... Lego things ... Nuby ... Oma ...~ Little Danny&apos;s
imagination kicked into overdrive as he began imagining what his
parents could be facing. ~Maybe Dad &apos;n&apos; Daddy get hurt helping
the Nox,~ he thought.

His book sliding to the floor, Little Danny pulled his knees up to his
chest and buried his head in them. He felt like a lead ball was
sitting in his stomach and began to tremble as he realized he might
never see his parents again.

~Oh, that&apos;s not normal.~ Noticing her favorite Jackson-O&apos;Neill
clearly upset about something, Karissa flipped the top down on her
laptop and walked over to where Little Danny sat, sitting down across
from him. Hey, she said, smiling as she reached out and rubbed
gently against the top of his hands.

Rissa, Little Danny sniffled just before lunging into her arms.

Goodness! What&apos;s wrong? Karissa asked as she held the little
boy, rocking him gently.

Little Danny! Jonny called out as he put down his cards and leaped
up, followed immediately by Aislinn.

In seconds, the Munchkins were all standing by Karissa.

I&apos;m okay, Little Danny answered, still not wanting to worry his
siblings.

No lie to me! Jonny argued sternly.

Me, either! Aislinn said equally sternly.

I&apos;m just worried &apos;bout ... Little Danny stopped. He wanted to
be truthful, but he also knew that Karissa didn&apos;t know about their
secret. It&apos;s a secret, &apos;Rissa. Wish you knew secret, he
said, his face drooping.

You can&apos;t tell me the secret? Seeing her charge shake his head,
a frown on his face, Karissa sighed. Then she smiled and
commented, I may not know the secret, but I&apos;m always here to try and
make you feel better.

You always make me feel better, Little Danny responded.

He *loves* you, Jonny teased.

Jonny! Aislinn scolded as Little Danny blushed.

Well, I love him, too, Karissa answered. How would you like to
go for a little walk?

Little Danny smiled, though it was a tiny curve of his mouth and not a
big grin. He was worried about his parents, and though he
couldn&apos;t share his concern with Karissa, he decided he might feel
better going with her. Plus, he wouldn&apos;t worry Jonny and Aislinn
if he wasn&apos;t there.

Yes, the little boy answered as he stood up.

Jonny, Aislinn, you two keep playing. I&apos;ll send Dora down to be
with you, okay? Karissa spoke as she stood, too, and took Little Danny
by the hand.

We don&apos;t need babysitters, Jonny whined, his growing desire for
independence undeniable.

Humor us, Karissa requested as she and Little Danny headed for the
stairs that went upstairs.

Ooookay, Jonny reluctantly agreed as he sat down to continue the game
of Snap.

====

Upstairs, Karissa and Little Danny walked into Megan&apos;s office.

Megan, Little Danny and I are going for a walk. We&apos;ll be back in
a while, Karissa announced, smiling down at the boy and squeezing his
left hand gently.

Have fun, Megan said.

Wait a minute, Little Danny requested, hurrying over to Megan. He whispered in her ear, Megan, Dad and Daddy went to help the
Nox. I scared.

Megan smiled down at the boy genius and sighed; then she whispered,
The Nox are very strong; they won&apos;t let anything happen to your
parents.

You sure?

Where&apos;s your faith, Little Danny? Megan took his hands in hers
and said, Your dad and daddy are the two bravest and most incredible
people I know. No matter what, you have to believe in them.

And the Nox? Little Danny asked quietly, his eyes shining with hope.

And the Nox, Megan confirmed, nodding.

Smiling, Little Danny gave Megan a hug and then returned to Karissa,
happily slipping his hand back into hers.

====

Penny for them? Jack asked, nudging Daniel gently, bringing the
archaeologist out of his silent musings.

SG-1 had gated to PX9-771, met with the Tok&apos;ra, and were now en route
to the Nox home world. They&apos;d used the time to finalize their
battle plans. Now, though, Jack noticed that Daniel had spent the
last fifteen minutes staring out into space.

Did you ever wonder where that saying came from? Daniel asked as he
looked over at his husband briefly. It was first written by an
English playwright in the sixteenth century named John Heywood, but ...

Danny, Jack interrupted his rambling lover. You&apos;re avoiding
the question. What&apos;s wrong?

Daniel sighed, then gave Jack a wry smile as he answered, Nothing&apos;s
wrong. I&apos;m just wondering what kind of reaction we&apos;re going to
get from the Nox.

You mean whether it&apos;ll be a &apos;thanks for coming to help us out&apos; or &apos;you
shouldn&apos;t have come. We had everything under control; you&apos;re such
a young race, always running into danger, trying to run before you can
walk, yadda, yadda, yadda.&apos; Jack quipped.

Daniel nodded, asking, Remember when Bri tried running away, and
Little Danny went with her?

Jack shook his head, vividly recalling just a few months earlier when
Brianna had been fighting with Jennifer and had decided to run
away. Little Danny had discovered this and gone with her. After several frantic hours, Jack and Daniel had finally realized the
two were safely ensconced in the tree house.

I&apos;ll never forget, Jack replied softly. If you hadn&apos;t turned
all my hair gray, our children would&apos;ve.

Yes, well, Little Danny went with Bri because it was the right thing
to do, even though he knew it was also wrong. That&apos;s kinda how I
feel right now, Daniel explained.

Their conversation was cut short by Sam&apos;s shout of, General, we&apos;ve
reached the Nox home world.

Jack and Daniel exchanged a look, and then, at the exact same time,
each communicated, **I love you.**

====

On the planet, the teams made their way towards the clustering of huts
where SG-1 had first met the Nox years ago. They didn&apos;t get far,
though, before Jaffa troops spotted them and opened fire.

Spread out, Jack shouted as he fired his P-90 from behind a
tree. Seeing an opening, he moved to his left, headed for better
cover. As he made his way, he caught sight of a Jaffa heading
towards his husband; only Daniel was busy shooting it out with the
enemy in front of him. Daniel, look ... At that moment, Jack
felt a staff blast penetrate his body. Oh, not again, he said
as he fell dead to the ground.

JACK! Daniel shouted, ignoring the danger he was in. He sprung
up, running towards his fallen lover. He only made it halfway
when a staff blast permeated his body. ~Haven&apos;t we done this
before?~

Teal&apos;c! Sam yelled as she attempted to check on her teammates.

Soon, though, both she and Teal&apos;c were lying face down in the grass, no
longer breathing.

====

Jack groaned, Danny?

He is in the bed next to you, a voice calmly answered.

Wearily, Jack opened his eyes, and after squinting several times,
managed to focus on Lya&apos;s face.

Lya, how are ya doin&apos;? Jack asked as he slowly sat up.

I am fine, Lya responded, a small smile on her face.

At that moment, a groan from Daniel&apos;s bed caught their attention.

Danny? Jack asked, quickly albeit groggily, moving over to the next
bed.

J&apos;ck? Daniel asked groggily.

Come on, Daniel, show me those baby blues, Jack encouraged
tenderly. Daniel gave another groan before his eyes flickered
open. You died again, Daniel! I told you to stop doing
that! Jack said sternly, not being able to stop himself from rebuking
his lover for dying, yet again.

Daniel looked pointedly at Jack&apos;s chest, saying, I don&apos;t think you are
in any position to cast stones, General.

Indeed, Teal&apos;c spoke as he came into the small hut. After
nodding at Lya, he continued, It does not seem as if the Nox needed
our assistance, O&apos;Neill.

Jack sighed, Well, we know that now, Teal&apos;c, but we didn&apos;t know it
before.

Did DanielJackson not point it out several times before we left the
SGC? the Jaffa asked.

You can shut up anytime now, T, Jack said, glaring at their tall
friend. Where&apos;s Carter?

ColonelCarter is checking on your comrades, Lya announced.

Thank you, Lya, for, uh ... uh, you know, Daniel stated hesitantly as
he sat up, his right hand rubbing against the spot where he knew he&apos;d
been hit by the staff weapon.

You are welcome. You did not need to come, Friends, Lya told
them.

That&apos;s what I said, Daniel said as he continued to check over his
body.

Jack just glared at his husband and then looked back at Lya,
responding, You haven&apos;t responded to our messages, and then the Tok&apos;ra
told us about the shoe goddess ...

We have told you before that we do not need your help, Anteaus said
as he entered the tent. It is still true that ...

... the very young do not always do as they are told.

The words were spoken in unison by Anteaus, Jack, and Daniel.

Jack shrugged and admitted, We were worried about you.

Anteaus gave Jack a pitying look, but stated, You mean well, but we do
not need your help.

Where is Nike? Uh, that&apos;s the name of the Goa&apos;uld whose Jaffa we
were fighting with, Daniel said.

They have been sent back through the Stargate, Lya answered.

Well, why didn&apos;t you do that when they first came here? Jack asked, a
bit of frustration in his tone.

There was no need, Anteaus answered.

Right, Jack answered dryly. Why didn&apos;t you respond to our
messages?

To do so would have risked being discovered. We cannot
communicate with you while our city is cloaked, Anteaus revealed.

Oh, well ... Jack looked at his husband. Daniel?

Jack? Once Jack rolled his eyes and sighed, Daniel
grinned. He turned to the Nox, saying, We have a favor to ask of
you.

====

Little Danny sat with his brothers and sisters in the rec room. Jennifer was reading them a story, but he wasn&apos;t listening to it. He&apos;d had a wretched afternoon, despite Megan&apos;s and Karissa&apos;s best
attempts to reassure him. Sadly, his vivid imagination was
getting the better of him.

The little boy had enjoyed his walk with Karissa until he&apos;d caught
sight of a spider scurrying up a tree. It had suddenly occurred
to him that the Nox might not be in danger from anything they knew
about. Maybe the glowy-eyed bad guys had mutated. He
thought of Spiderman and shuddered, imagining his parents facing a bad
glowy-eyed man with Spiderman&apos;s abilities. Maybe that was why the
Nox couldn&apos;t fight off their attackers, and if the Nox couldn&apos;t fight
them off, what chance did his parents have?

Karissa had noticed his sudden retreat into misery again, but since the
little boy couldn&apos;t tell her why he was worried and upset, her attempts
to cheer him up had largely failed. When they&apos;d returned to J-O,
Little Danny had tried to plaster a smile on his face. It wasn&apos;t
very convincing, though, and Jonny certainly hadn&apos;t been fooled, nor
had Aislinn.

It had been a heartbreaking sight, watching Jonny and Aislinn trying
futilely to cheer up their brother, and Little Danny trying desperately
to pretend he was cheered up.

At the close of the business day, Megan and Karissa had gone to the
Jackson-O&apos;Neill home. The timing had all been worked out, and
soon, all eleven children were present. Due to various
obligations that night, Megan would be the one staying to care for the
youngsters while Karissa, having a big date planned, would be leaving
any minute now.

Go on, Karissa. You&apos;ve been planning on this date for a month,
Megan urged.

The young woman sighed and shook her head, saying, I know I should,
Megan, but look at him. I don&apos;t think I&apos;d feel right, and what
bugs me is that I don&apos;t understand why he&apos;s so worried. She
paused, glancing over at her friend and co-worker and then
challenging. You do, though. You understand why he&apos;s
worried, and he is worried.

As nonchalantly as she could, Megan replied, Ah, you know little boys
and their imaginations. Jack and Daniel had some business to take
care of, and ...

Business? Karissa challenged. I&apos;m not going to quiz you,
Megan, but please don&apos;t lie to me.

Megan nodded, replying only with, What about your date?

Megan, if you can tell me that Little Danny is just being a little
boy, imagining monsters all around that don&apos;t exist, then I&apos;ll go say
goodbye to him and leave. Can you tell me that? Karissa asked,
staring her co-worker and friend straight in the eye. After a
moment, she added, I was in Egypt and Mexico and Peru. Strange
things happen when we go on a major dig. I&apos;m not blind. I
know enough not to interfere, but I know when something is not normal
procedure. She looked over at her unhappy admirer and smiled
when he looked at her. Do I tell him goodnight, Megan, or should
I go hold him?

~He needs her,~ Megan thought as she pondered her unanticipated
situation. Finally, she answered, Go to him, Karissa. Try
to reassure him.

But don&apos;t make any promises?

Shaking her head, Megan answered, Tell him to keep the faith.

Karissa nodded and said, Thank you, Megan. I think I&apos;ll make a
quick phone call.

====

Welcome back, SG-1, General Hammond greeted his premier team as they
came through the Gate. Standing at the foot of the ramp, he
remarked, I hear the Nox ended up rescuing you rather than the other
way around.

Daniel hid a smile as Jack glared at the men he&apos;d sent back through the
Gate earlier, grumbling, Big mouths.

The archaeologist took pity on his husband and grinned at the general
as he said, That&apos;s one way of looking at it, Sir. Of course, you
could also take the view that we rescued them by making it necessary
for them to banish the Goa&apos;uld from their planet. If we hadn&apos;t
gone to their aid, who knows how long they would have forced themselves
to hide? We rescued them from themselves, Sir.

**Oooh, nicely put, Danny.** Jack looked at his husband with
admiration and pride. He couldn&apos;t help feeling a little smug,
too, at the fact that Daniel was his. ~All mine.~

**Thank you, Babe. I do my best.**

**And you do it so well, Angel.**

Okay, troops, lets hit the infirmary so we can go home, Jack ordered.

Before you do that, General, Doctor Jackson, you need to phone home,
Hammond told them quietly.

The lieutenant general immediately found four pairs of very worried
eyes looking at him, and he put a hand up to stop the various scenarios
that were obviously flashing through the minds of SG-1. He gave
an inward smile at the knowledge that Sam and Teal&apos;c loved the brood
almost as much as their parents.

Is anything wrong? Daniel asked.

Everyone&apos;s fine, Hammond answered. You just have a very
worried little boy, waiting for news that you&apos;re okay. He&apos;s
refused to go sleep.

Daniel and Jack looked confused. They specifically hadn&apos;t told
the children that they were going through the Gate on a rescue mission,
and the brood were used to them leaving on peaceful missions.

Megan phoned earlier to see if we had any news, Hammond explained.
Apparently, Little Danny is terrified you were going to get hurt
somehow. I&apos;ve spoken with him a couple of times myself. He&apos;s putting on a brave front.

Where on Earth did he get the idea that we might get hurt ? Jack
asked as the couple made their way to Hammond&apos;s office to use his phone.

Daniel shook his head, saying, I have no idea.

He didn&apos;t know about Jack, but Daniel was feeling very guilty. Although they were all fine now, all four members of SG-1 had actually
died on this mission, and if it wasn&apos;t for the Nox bringing them back,
their children would be suffering the loss of not only their parents,
but their &apos;Aunt Sam&apos; and Teal&apos;c. The knowledge was sobering to
Daniel, and he was kicking himself for putting his own nostalgia for
the &apos;old days&apos; ahead of his responsibilities.

Megan, it&apos;s Jack, Jack announced when Megan answered the phone at
their house.

Jack, it&apos;s good to hear from you, Megan responded, yawning.

I&apos;m sorry if I woke you, but General Hammond said ...

No, I was just relaxing ... with the lights out. What time is
it? Megan asked.

Jack glanced at his watch and announced, 0200 hours.

Time flies when you&apos;re having fun, Megan chuckled lightly. Are
you and Daniel all right? Little Danny has been so worried.

Quickly, Jack answered, We&apos;re fine. Is he asleep now?

I doubt it. Karissa was with him before I, uh ... Megan began,
getting up to see where the two currently were.

Began to relax? Jack quipped with a smile.

Okay, I feel asleep. Taking care of eleven children is hard
work. I don&apos;t know how you two do it! Megan responded as she
walked around the house.

Jack chuckled and then asked, Karissa stayed, too?

I thought she had a date, Daniel interjected.

Jack looked at Daniel and was about to repeat the question, but Megan
heard and replied, Yes, she stayed, and, yes, she had a date, but she
called it off to stay and help out. Truthfully, I think having
her here was reassuring for Little Danny.

He *loves* her, Jack teased, shaking his head.

He sure does, Megan chuckled. They were downstairs on the
sofa. The girls wouldn&apos;t leave him, either. I&apos;m heading
down there now.

Daniel interjected, Don&apos;t wake him if he&apos;s asleep.

I won&apos;t. Hold on a minute; I was in the upstairs
guestroom. I figured I should stay as close as possible to the
young ones, Megan said just as she approached the stairway.

That was a great idea, Jack affirmed over the phone; then he looked
over at Daniel and mouthed what Megan had just said.

Megan, is that them? Karissa asked, seeing Megan walk into the living
room.

Four beagle ears stood up, and Little Danny, who had been snuggled
against Karissa, sat up straighter and rubbed his tired eyes.

Dad and Daddy? the little boy asked.

It&apos;s for you, Megan said, smiling as she handed Little Danny the
phone.

Dad? Daddy? Little Danny spoke into the phone, his tremulous
voice, full of fear and hope, pulling at Jack&apos;s heart like nothing else
could.

Hey, Sproglet, Jack said calmly.

You &apos;n&apos; Daddy okay? Little Danny asked.

We&apos;re both fine, not a scratch on us, Jack clarified, knowing how
Little Danny might disbelieve the &apos;I&apos;m fine&apos; type of statement after
hearing all the stories about Daniel using that phrase. Aunt Sam
and Teal&apos;c are okay, too.

Little Danny breathed a sigh of relief, and with the relief, came his
tears. They trickled down his cheeks as he sought further
assurance.

Daaaaddy? Little Danny called out.

Daniel spoke out, Son, we&apos;re all just great. We love you!

The little boy sniffled, but his relief was complete now that he had
heard the voice of both parents.

The ... Little Danny began, but then stopped as he looked at Karissa
and realized he was unable to ask about glowy eyes, snake people, or
even the Nox with her in the room.

Picking up on the boy&apos;s hesitation, Karissa smiled sadly at him and
whispered, I&apos;ll go to the kitchen for a glass of water.

The tears came faster as Little Danny felt bad now for keeping secrets
from his special friend, and he let out a couple of sobs.

So glowy ...&lt;sob&gt;... eyes ...&lt;sob&gt;... didn&apos;t get you?
Little Danny cried.

Jack panicked for a moment, thinking that Little Danny was talking
about the Goa&apos;uld in front of Karissa. He quickly realized that
the boy knew better, and he knew Megan was there to make sure that
didn&apos;t happen. Unfortunately, Little Danny took his father&apos;s
hesitation as confirmation that the glowy-eyed people did in fact get
his parents.

The boy&apos;s imagination kicked back into overdrive as he envisioned all
sorts of horrible things happening to SG-1. The fact that they
were okay now didn&apos;t mean they hadn&apos;t been hurt, just that the Nox must
have healed them. He remembered how he had fallen on one visit to see
the Nox, scraping his knee. In mere moments, the Nox had not only
taken away the pain, but completely healed his knee.

You ...&lt;sob&gt;... home ...&lt;sob&gt;... now?

Jack ached at his son&apos;s distress, and he looked up to see the mistiness
in Daniel&apos;s eyes as he heard the loud sobs coming over the phone.

We&apos;re on our way, Son, Jack reassured the boy. We&apos;re okay,
Little Danny. I promise, he added.

At that, Little Danny gave up his battle for control completely and,
handing the phone back to Megan, buried his head in Katie&apos;s fur and
cuddled Bijou close, seeking all the comfort he could get.

~Poor baby,~ Megan thought as she immediately sat down and began
rubbing Little Danny&apos;s back to try and soothe him as she finished
speaking to Jack. She hung up the phone and called quietly,
Karissa.

Karissa poked her head out of the kitchen and, seeing the phone
conversation was over, came back into the room, exchanging places with
Megan and taking up rubbing Little Danny&apos;s back and whispering
reassurances. She looked up at Megan, silently asking why the boy
was so upset when Jack and Daniel were clearly okay.

Megan shrugged, indicating she wasn&apos;t sure what had Little Danny so
upset; then she mouthed, Long day. She watched Karissa try and
comfort the boy. ~Wonder if Jack and Daniel could get clearance
to tell her about the Stargate. It would make things a heck of a
lot easier for Little Danny, not to mention the rest of us.~

Little Danny shifted. He moved in as close as he could to Karissa
while keeping both Bijou and Katie as close as possible. He
needed to be near all three of them.

Your parents will be home in less than an hour. Rest until then,
okay? Karissa asked.

Rissa? the tiny voice asked.

Yes?

I love you.

I love you, too, Little Danny, Karissa replied warmly as she
continued to comfort the child.

====

Fifty minutes later, having left the SGC without participating in the
debriefing or submitting to post-mission exams, Jack and Daniel hurried
into their home.

**Gawd, Jack,** Daniel thought as he saw his namesake clinging to
Karissa and the girls.

Little Danny, Karissa said with a smile, seeing the lovers
enter. She placed a kiss atop her young beau&apos;s head and
whispered, Guess who&apos;s home?

Little Danny&apos;s head sprang up, and his eyes widened. It took only
a second for him to disentangle himself from Karissa and the beagles.

Daaaaaaaddy, the little boy sobbed as Daniel picked him up. I
scared.

Hey, everything&apos;s all right, Daniel said soothingly as he held their
son securely, hugging and kissing him.

Jack leaned into the hug, his hand rubbing the boy&apos;s back.

Daaaad?

I&apos;m just peachy, Jack responded as cheerfully as he could. We
love you, Son, he added.

**He&apos;s trembling, Jack. He really was scared.**

Want tell &apos;Rissa. We ...&lt;sob&gt;... tell her? Little Danny
cried into his father&apos;s neck, though his cry was intentionally quiet so
that the woman couldn&apos;t hear.

We&apos;ll talk about it, Daniel promised, But right now, you need to go
to sleep.

I sleep with you and Dad and Bij and Katie, &apos;kay? Little Danny asked.

Daniel looked to his husband who nodded and then replied, Okay. Let&apos;s thank Megan and Karissa for being here, Daniel suggested.

Immediately, Little Danny twisted his body around and reached for
Karissa. She smiled as she took him into her hold.

Thank you, Rissa, Little Danny said as he gave her a big bear hug.

You&apos;re welcome, Precious, Karissa responded, giving him a little kiss
on his head. When he pulled back, she pushed the hair out of his
eyes with one hand and said, I wish I could have made you feel better,
but see, all&apos;s well.

But ...&lt;sniffles&gt;... you did, the boy responded, hugging her
again.

Smiling, Karissa held her charge tightly.

Thank you, Daniel whispered to the woman.

No, thank *you*. He&apos;s my love, Karissa whispered in return and
then handed Little Danny over to Daniel once again.

Thank you, Megan, the boy said as she, too, leaned in for a hug.

Anytime, Little Danny.

Wanting to calm their son even more, Daniel intoned, Jack, I&apos;m going
to take him upstairs. Will you let the girls out and ...

Yeah, go ahead, Jack agreed.

Two minutes later, Jack walked Megan and Karissa to their cars. When Karissa left, Megan turned back and asked, Jack, any chance we
can tell Karissa about the Stargate? Little Danny wanted to talk
to her so badly, but he knew he couldn&apos;t.

We&apos;re going to check out the possibility. Thanks, Megs, Jack
said, opening her car door for her.

Megs, the woman replied incredulously. Jack, if you start
calling me &apos;Megs&apos;, I&apos;m going to call you Jackie.

Jack thought for a moment and then said, Goodnight ... Megan.

Chuckling, Megan started her car, gave a little wave, and then headed
home.

Jack locked up the house and walked upstairs, but he stopped short of
their bedroom.

**Danny?**

**Yes?**

**Do you want to look in on the brood with me?** the older man asked
via their near-telepathic language.

**Yes, but ... Jack, he&apos;s very clingy. I think I&apos;d better just
stay here with him. Kiss all of them for me,** Daniel replied,
holding his namesake&apos;s hand and rubbing his back.

**Okay, Angel. I&apos;ll check on them, let the girls back in, and be
there in a few minutes.**

====

Dad, is everything okay? a groggy Jennifer asked, becoming aware that
her father had entered her room.

Perfect. How were things while Daddy and I were gone? Jack
asked as he sat on the edge of the girl&apos;s bed.

The kids were okay, except for Little Danny. He was really
upset, but trying to pretend not to be. Having Karissa here
helped, Jennifer chuckled.

Match made in heaven, Jack teased. Go back to sleep,
Jen. As Jennifer yawned and settled back down in her bed, he
added a soft, We love you.

Love you, too, Dad.

====

Finding all the other children resting peacefully, and after doing some
extra tucking in and giving out lots of tender kisses, Jack walked into
their bedroom. Little Danny was still clinging to Daniel, and as
soon as Jack had changed into his pajamas, the little boy was
rearranging things, pulling out Daniel&apos;s arm for Jack to lie on and
then lying back, looking at Jack expectantly.

Jack obliged, and soon Little Danny was sandwiched in between them,
Bijou and Katie at his feet.

Sleep, now, Little Danny, Daniel whispered.

We&apos;ve got you, Jack assured, kissing the top of his son&apos;s head.

**I wonder what scared him so much, Jack.**

**I don&apos;t know, Danny. We&apos;ll ask him in the morning. Monsters and nightmares always seem less frightening in daylight,**
Jack responded.

Looking down at their son, Daniel responded, **It wouldn&apos;t surprise me
if he has a nightmare tonight.**

**Hopefully, he&apos;s too exhausted to do anything but sleep.**

**I love you, Babe.**

**Love you, too, Angel.**

====

No, no, NOOOOOOOOO!
 
Both Jack and Daniel woke up instantly at the frightened cries coming
from their son.

Guess he wasn&apos;t too tired, Jack sighed.

Carefully, the parents began to wake up the little boy.

No, a tiny voice cried. Then Little Danny blinked several times
as he looked his parents up and down, obviously making sure they were
unharmed. Once he was satisfied, he threw himself into their
arms, crying, Dad! Daddy!

**I think we better try and get him talking about it now, Jack.**

**I agree.** Jack rubbed his son&apos;s back and began the
questioning. Little Danny, why were you so upset? Daddy
and I have been through the Stargate before, and you&apos;ve never been this
upset, Jack asked gently.

Both Jack and Daniel were surprised and a little shocked to find
themselves being glared at.

You lied, Little Danny answered, a tremble in his voice. You
didn&apos;t tell us you were goin&apos; to rescue the Nox.

We, uh ... what makes you think we were trying to rescue the Nox?
Daniel asked.

Weren&apos;t you? the little boy asked pointedly.

Uh, well ... Daniel stuttered. Jack?

Yes, we were, Jack answered truthfully. But we didn&apos;t tell you
that. How did you know?

I just knew, the boy answered. I got scared. Glowy-eyed
people there?

**Jack, you and the glowy-eyed people. I warned you about telling
them all those stories.**

**Danny, they&apos;re just stories.**

**Tell that to our son,** Daniel silently argued.

Little Danny, Jack began. The Nox didn&apos;t need our help. We thought they did, but we were wrong.

Glowy-eyed people not there? the little boy asked.

**Tell him the truth, Jack.**

They were there, but the Nox kicked them off their planet, Jack
answered.

Lies bad, Little Danny chastised vulnerably.

We didn&apos;t lie, Son. We just didn&apos;t ... Jack stopped,
seeing his son&apos;s glare. ~He&apos;s just like Danny.~

Little Danny argued, You say lies we tell are bad, and lies we don&apos;t
tell but are lies are bad, too.

Huh? Jack quizzed uncertainly.

Lies of omission, Daniel clarified. Sproglet, parents try to
protect their children. Going through the Stargate is something
we do a lot, but, usually, now, it&apos;s safe. Sometimes, though, it
can be dangerous. We thought the Nox were in danger, and we had
to try and help them. Do you understand?

Yes, but no lie anymore, Little Danny admonished his parents.

We don&apos;t want to worry your brothers and sisters, Daniel responded.

I won&apos;t tell, Little Danny promised as he looked down. Wish
&apos;Rissa knew about the Stargate.

I know, Son, Jack comforted as he rubbed the little boy&apos;s back in
reassurance.

Little Danny looked back up at them with worried blue eyes and asked,
Did it hurt lots before the Nox fixed you?

What? Daniel asked and then shared a confused look with his husband.

Dad hes&apos;tated when I asked him if the glowy eyes were there, Little
Danny explained. They were there, huh? Did it hurt a lot?

Daniel looked at the teary eyes of his son and drew him into a
hug. The little boy had so much empathy for others, and it was
obvious he was agonizing over the pain he believed his parents had been
in.

No, it didn&apos;t hurt, Little Danny, Daniel assured. And it was
nothing that Lya couldn&apos;t fix all by herself.

Love Lya, Little Danny said with a smile. He looked up at them,
and they were pleased to see the usual spark of life in his eyes. Will Lya be at my birthday party?

She wouldn&apos;t miss it for the world, Sproglet, Jack laughed as he
tousled Little Danny&apos;s hair. Now, what about getting some more
sleep?

The little boy nodded and yawned before snuggling closer to Daniel and,
at the same time, pulling Jack closer.

Love you, Dad and Daddy, Little Danny sighed as he closed his eyes.

Murmuring sentiments of love back to the boy, Jack and Daniel watched
their son fall into a peaceful sleep.

Daniel sighed, **I think his imagination worked overtime today, Jack.**

**I can&apos;t believe the way he drew all the dots together. He is
way too smart for his own good,** the older man replied.

**You mean for our own good. We forget sometimes how observant he
is. If we&apos;d told him what was going on, he wouldn&apos;t have had to
imagine it.**

**Something to remember for next time,** Daniel pointed out.

Jack yawned and soon joined his son in slumber. Daniel, however,
lay awake for some time grappling with the guilt he was feeling over
going on a mission they had known would be dangerous.

~Change fast; hurry over to the auditorium; don&apos;t forget my science
book ...~

Jeff was quickly running through a list of things he needed to
do. His last period this semester was physical education, and the
class was ending. He was lagging behind, though, having stayed to
help the instructor pick up the equipment. Entering the locker
room as most of the boys were heading out, he was trying to make sure
he didn&apos;t forget anything.

As he changed and more of the students left the building, the remaining
voices began to echo. Then, Jeff heard a cackling laugh and
whispers. He wasn&apos;t really interested in the stories being told
until he heard a familiar name -- Jennifer. Now drawn to the
conversation, Jeff walked slowly past the aisles of lockers, buttoning
his shirt as he made his way. The voices became frighteningly
clear.

I have to give my sis credit, one boy laughed. She got that
snooty Jennifer but good.

How? another boy asked.

Right before classes were out last year, in one of her lab classes,
Mary Beth took the queer&apos;s water bottle and slobbered all over it, the
boy announced.

So? a third boy inquired. It&apos;s ugly, but ...

But Mary Beth had mono, and she knew it. She gave it to the
lesbo, the first boy boasted.

Jennifer isn&apos;t gay, the second boy defended, not really liking what
he was hearing.

Her parents are, and besides, she thinks she&apos;s some high and mighty
queen. Queen of the lesbos, probably, the boy sneered.

Did she get it? the third boy asked.

Yeah, and I heard she got in major trouble with her parents over
it. Awesome, Mary Beth, the boy stated in admiration of his
sister.

Jeff grew angry as he realized what he had heard. His first
instinct was to interrupt and beat Mary Beth&apos;s brother to a pulp, but
then it wasn&apos;t the brother who did the deed; it was Mary Beth.

~Crap, I wish I didn&apos;t need to go to drama, but it&apos;s the first day of
auditions,~ Jeff thought. ~Besides, Daddy would say &apos;count to
ten&apos; or something. Of course, Dad would say &apos;don&apos;t get mad, get
even&apos; ... and then he&apos;d pound Mary Beth to a pulp, girl or no girl.~

====

Places, everyone. Stagehands, your attention! the drama teacher
who was serving as the production director called out. Three
boys, including Jeff, and one girl hurried to the right hand side of
the stage. You&apos;ve all received instructions on how to handle the
equipment, but I want you to get some practice during the auditions so
that when the rehearsals roll around, we can concentrate on specific
movements rather than your trying to get comfortable with your
duties. Jeff, you handle the curtain. We&apos;ll raise and lower
it for every audition. Keith, you alternate with Jeff. By
the end of the day, you should both be pretty comfortable with
it. Bruce ...

Jeff nodded, but inside, he was still seething about what he&apos;d heard in
the locker room just thirty minutes ago. He wanted to get home
and tell his parents, knowing they&apos;d handle it. How dare anyone
do something so malicious as to give someone a disease, and yet, that
is exactly what Mary Beth had done. The girl had briefly been a
friend of Jennifer&apos;s; that is, until she found out about Jack and
Daniel. At that point, her so-called friendship faded, replaced
by hate.

Though Jeff hadn&apos;t been around to witness the confrontation at the
carnival with Mary Beth&apos;s family back in 2009, he had heard about it,
and he did know who she was. He had always tried to be polite to
her, but the teen girl looked upon any Jackson-O&apos;Neill with disdain.

Places, everyone, the director called out, clapping his hands as he
walked off the stage, taking a spot down front.

The teenage boy moved to his position at stage left of the large
auditorium. The curtain was controlled by pulleys with large
sandbags attached. He had to learn just how and when to release
the pulleys and control the sandbags so that the curtain would be
lowered or raised at the right time.

A bit nervously, Jeff reviewed his notes as he waited for the cue to
begin. Still, he couldn&apos;t forget the cackling boys.

First up, Mary Beth Cheney, the director called out.

Jeff&apos;s head shot up as he saw Mary Beth eagerly approach.

~That&apos;s right. She likes being a drama queen,~ Jeff thought.

Where&apos;s our costume lady? the director called out. Julia?

Sorry, Mister Crampton, Julia apologized as she approached the first
girl to audition. Mary Beth, we need you to put this on, she
said, carrying a short-sleeve dress. Come with me.

Julia, let&apos;s get on top of this, the director instructed as the two
girls hurried off to the dressing room.

The plan was for the costume fitters to get some practice in right from
the beginning, too. Plus, it would give the director a chance to
see those auditioning in attire relevant to the musical being
produced. Julia was supposed to get to the auditioning students
before the director called their name. Obviously, there&apos;d been a
slip up, and Mary Beth hadn&apos;t changed into the costume as yet.

From stage left, Jeff stewed just knowing Mary Beth was present.

~She loves attention. I should knock her lights out; that would
give her attention,~ the boy steamed silently.

Then Mary Beth walked out onto the stage, saying she was ready. Her dress was loose fitting with a hoop skirt and halter-like top.

Jeff stared at the sandbags, wishing he could take one and sandbag the
vicious teen with it.

~It would serve her right,~ Jeff thought.

Mary Beth, please hit your mark, the director advised, motioning
towards the tape that was on the floor, indicating where she should
stand.

Then Jeff saw it. It was right there ... just waiting ... in
perfect position ... tempting him ... taunting him ... it was like Fate
had stepped in.

~No, I couldn&apos;t. It wouldn&apos;t be right. No, no ... but she
does deserve it ... geez, I&apos;d be grounded for life ... I couldn&apos;t ...
really, I can&apos;t ... I ...~ Excuse me, Mister Crampton, Jeff
called out, walking forward across the stage, glancing slightly at the
put-out Mary Beth, who was tapping her foot at the interruption.

The teenager walked to the front of the stage and knelt down to ask his
question, just to make sure he knew what to do. It was a
legitimate question, one he&apos;d been intending to ask. He just
decided not to put it off, not since Fate was stepping in.

Thank you, Jeff said, backing up and then crossing over the stage and
conveniently dropping his notebook at center stage, two pens and some
papers scattering in the vicinity. Sorry, he called out,
bending down to pick up his items.

Mary Beth rolled her eyes upward as she crossed her arms and tapped her
foot impatiently, finally snarling, Will you hurry up!

It might go quicker if you help me, Jeff not-so-innocently stated.

With a nasty groan, Mary Beth bent down to help. After all, the
quicker Jeff was gone, the sooner she&apos;d be on her way to the starring
role, which she was certain she&apos;d get.

Jeff grinned at Fate. It was so easy. He wouldn&apos;t even have
to do much. Just ... yes, just a tiny tap and ... there, that was
easy.

Sorry, Jeff spoke again, grinning as he returned to his position at
stage left.

Students, let&apos;s get this show on the road. Mary Beth, whenever
you&apos;re ready, the director told her.

~And she thinks she can sing?~ Jeff thought as the girl began to perform. ~She&apos;s no Barbra Streisand; not even Alanis Morrisette. Gawd, she&apos;s not even Jessica Simpson. Where are the earplugs?~ he silently groaned.

The moment was approaching. The climax of the song was almost
here. Mary Beth would be walking forward, and that&apos;s when Jeff
was certain she&apos;d fumble. That&apos;s what he thought would happen --
that she would start to move forward and then have an awkward moment
because of Fate&apos;s intervention.

~Hmm. Jeffrey, m&apos;lad, that is a lot of lifting power in that
sandbag; more than Mary Beth weighs for sure. Could it lift her
up? Or maybe rip her dress?~ the teenager&apos;s conscience inquired.

The dangling object Jeff had given a nudge to was a flying hook,
designed to be used to let actors &apos;fly&apos; onstage. This was merely
one, and they were normally used in groups of three or four. He
looked up and, with his eyes, traced the path of the rope he was pretty
sure was attached to the flying hook he had nudged under the loose
cross strap of Mary Beth&apos;s costume.

Jeff paused momentarily. In his science class today, the subject
had been Newtonian physics -- &apos;For each and every action there is an
equal and opposite reaction&apos;. For a second, Jeff considered
backing away from his intention. Then he remembered Jennifer&apos;s
horrible summer recovering from mono and Mary Beth&apos;s sneers whenever he
uttered a polite &apos;hello&apos; to her.

The teenager decided this was his reaction and that he was justified in
taking advantage of the opportunity Fate had given him.

~I am merely the instrument of a greater wisdom. Let &apos;er rip,
Jeff.~ The moment arrived, and Jeff looked at the pulleys,
knowing that hitting the right one was key to Mary Beth&apos;s impending
embarrassing moment. ~It&apos;s fate, after all.~

Concentrating on his duties, Jeff mumbled, I think it&apos;s this
one. He whispered uncertainly, Or ... maybe it&apos;s this one.

The boy suddenly realized he really wasn&apos;t totally sure which pulley
was the right one. The pulleys for the three curtains had been
pointed out to him earlier. The ones that lowered and raised
backdrops were mostly on the other side, so that pretty much narrowed
it to two. The teen knew that one would lower the curtain while
the other stood a pretty good chance of being the one connected to Mary
Beth&apos;s costume.

~I need to study this some more,~ Jeff determined.

No matter what, though, either Mary Beth would have a less-than-grand
finish to her audition when she moved forward, or, if he chose the
wrong pulley, the curtain would close prematurely, and that would be
funny, too.

~I really shouldn&apos;t. Dad and Daddy wouldn&apos;t like it. No, I
can&apos;t. I just can&apos;t. It&apos;s not right. No, I shouldn&apos;t ...
but I&apos;m going to. Maybe it is too much weight, but my dad used to
tell me, Son, there are moments in every man&apos;s life when you have to
decide to play it safe, or just go for it. Okay, Dad, I&apos;m going
for it!~

Jeff made his decision, releasing the pulley he&apos;d selected, right or
wrong.

~Jen, this one&apos;s for you!~ Jeff enthusiastically thought.

Within seconds, Mary Beth&apos;s eyes grew wide. She looked up as her
arms were raised.

Oh no! Jeff exclaimed.

As the stunned onlookers watched, the fishhook that Jeff had only to
nudge to affix to the strapping of the back of Mary Beth&apos;s costume
caused the girl to raise up a few inches, but since it was just one
hook, she dropped back to the stage floor almost instantly. Unfortunately, the same could not be said for her costume.

When Mary Beth&apos;s arms raised, the loose-fitting costume slid right off
of her, leaving the girl center stage in nothing but her bra and
underpants.

Oh, my gosh. Snap the picture! Snap the picture! the
reporter from the school newspaper told his photographer.

The students giggled, while the teachers tried not to laugh. The
bad news for Mary Beth was that she wasn&apos;t well liked by either
faction, so no one was feeling that upset. Mary Beth, of course,
was mortified. She crossed her arms in front of her breasts and
screamed bloody murder.

Ah -- Julia! the director called out, urging her to help the
embarrassed teenager find her clothes.

As Mary Beth ran towards a hiding place, Jeff hurried out, saying, Oh,
gee, Mister Crampton, I&apos;m so sorry. I think I pulled the wrong
pulley.

Anyone know how that fishhook got attached to Mary Beth&apos;s dress? the
director asked, still trying to suppress his own laughter.

I&apos;ll bet it was when she helped Jeff pick up his stuff he dropped,
one of the boys offered.

Yeah, she was right by it, Jeff truthfully answered. I may
have even bumped it into her, he admitted, though altering the essence
of the truth slightly since his act had been intentional.

Accidents happen, Jeff, the director excused. It&apos;s not your
fault the flying hook was left lowered, and you couldn&apos;t have known it
wasn&apos;t supposed to be there.

I&apos;m so sorry, Mary Beth, Jeff called out to the still-upset teenage
girl, who was wrapped in a coat at stage right.

Yeah, right, Mary Beth spat back.

Boys, we have to be more careful, the director instructed. I
know it&apos;s confusing, but learn what every pulley and button is
for. Jeff, I want you to put in some extra time on that before we
leave.

Yes, Mister Crampton. I&apos;m so, so sorry, Jeff said, putting his
hands to his heart, figuring that since they were acting, he&apos;d add some
drama of his own.

Back to work, everyone. Viola Singleton, you&apos;re up next, he
called out.

Snickering silently, Jeff returned to his position, making no further
&apos;mistakes&apos; that afternoon.

====

Smiling, Jeff entered his house two hours later. After putting
his backpack in his room, he immediately sought out his parents,
finding them in the rec room, playing with the Munchkins.

Dad, Daddy, I need to talk to you. It&apos;s important, Jeff stated,
looking at the triplets. Munchkins, would you mind?

We&apos;ll go play on the swings, Aislinn suggested. Okay? she
asked her parents.

Okay, Jack answered.

As the Munchkins hurried outside, Jeff gave a cursory look around as he
walked over and took a seat on one of the ottomans.

No one else is home, Daniel pointed out, realizing that&apos;s what Jeff
was searching for.

I did a bad thing today, Jeff confessed right off the bat.

Surprised, the parents exchanged a look. They hoped it wasn&apos;t
anything too bad. The truth was, they were still tired from yesterday&apos;s
off-world adventure when they were rescued while rescuing their
rescuers. After all, they&apos;d only managed to get a few hours of
sleep before they had to get up and start the new day.

And, uh, what exactly was that? Daniel inquired as he and Jack sat
opposite their son.

I sort of bumped a fishhook into the back of Mary Beth Cheney&apos;s
dress, Jeff confessed.

Fishhook? Daniel asked. You went fishing?

Jeff chuckled, No, Daddy. It&apos;s what they use to help someone fly
in drama, like in &apos;Peter Pan&apos;. People wear harnesses, and the
fishhooks are attached to the harnesses. Normally, they wear a
few of those.

You made Mary Beth fly? Jack asked with an amazed expression on his
face.

Not ... exactly. You see, what I thought would happen is that
when she had to approach the audience, the fishhook would hold her
back. She&apos;d fall or something; that&apos;s what I thought, Jeff
clarified.

What did happen? Daniel asked.

Her dress flew off, Jeff snickered.

Her dress? both Jack and Daniel asked in surprise.

Back up, Jack requested. Son, why did you do this?

Suddenly, Jack and Daniel saw their son sober. The chuckling was
gone and his facial smirk only a memory, both replaced by a stern and
harsh expression.

I can&apos;t believe anyone would be so callous, Jeff commented. Dad, Daddy, Jennifer didn&apos;t get mono from Peter Hamilton. She
may have kissed him, but he didn&apos;t make her sick.

Daniel leaned forward, asking, How do you know?

I overheard Mary Beth&apos;s brother bragging about it in the locker room
at school today, Jeff expounded.

Bragging about what? Jack questioned, his face serious and cold all
of a sudden.

In science lab, right before school was out, Mary Beth got sick. She knew she had mono, but apparently, she didn&apos;t tell anyone. Dad, Daddy, gawd ... Jeff paused. He knew his parents
didn&apos;t like bad language being used, even though they sometimes fell
prey to it themselves. I&apos;m sorry, but ...

Go ahead, Daniel excused, certain Jeff had good reason for the anger
he was feeling.

She knew she was sick, Jeff repeated. She took Jennifer&apos;s
water bottle, and, well, I&apos;m not sure what she did ... if she spit in
it or ran her mouth on the straw or what ... but her brother said she
put her saliva on Jennifer&apos;s water bottle and watched as Jennifer drank
out of it a minute later.

THAT LITTLE ...

Daniel&apos;s hand flew over Jack&apos;s mouth, silencing him before a swearing
rant began that might be overheard from curious Munchkins.

I was so angry, I could have hit her, Jeff admitted. I wanted
to come right home to tell you, but I had the drama auditions today,
and as luck would have it, Mister Crampton assigned me to the main
stage curtain. I didn&apos;t even know Mary Beth was trying out, but
there she was, and then I saw the fishhook. I knew I shouldn&apos;t,
but I was so angry, Daddy, he said apologetically.

So you put the fishhook on the back of her dress? Daniel asked.

Yes, but I didn&apos;t know it would make her dress fly off, Jeff stated.

Are you sure about that? Jack queried.
 
When Jeff hesitated, Daniel prodded, Jeff?

Well, I wasn&apos;t sure, Dad, Daddy. I did wonder, especially since
we talked about Newtonian physics today, but I was sure she wouldn&apos;t
get hurt, and I wanted to see her get hers because of what she did to
Jen. To tell the truth, I was more concerned about having to come
home and ... &apos;fess up.

But you did it anyway, expecting to be punished? Daniel probed.

Mary Beth wasn&apos;t hurt, and all I could see was Jennifer&apos;s misery all
summer long. I ... Jeff&apos;s voice trailed off.

Jack and Daniel exchanged another look, and then Daniel verified, No
one was hurt?

No, no one, Jeff answered. I took responsibility; stepped
right up and said I must have released the wrong pulley. I even
admitted I *may* have pushed the fishhook into her.

They didn&apos;t punish you? Jack asked.

Mary Beth isn&apos;t very popular, Dad, the boy answered.

What you did was wrong, Daniel pointed out.

I know, Jeff agreed.

We should punish you, Jack stated firmly.

I know, the boy sighed.

You can&apos;t go around taking justice into your own hands, Daniel
warned, trying not to choke on the words, considering what he and Jack
had done in the past.

I know that, too, Daddy, Jeff replied, nodding.

We should ground you, Jack put forth.

Yes, you should, Jeff concurred.

Was she embarrassed? Jack asked, unable to continue the righteous
parent act any longer.

Mortified! Jeff exclaimed. She just stood there, arms in front
of her chest, staring up at her dress, and then she screamed. You
would have thought the place was on fire.

She was still dressed, Danny, Jack sniggered.

Probably wearing more than when we go swimming, Daniel acknowledged,
seeing a nod from the teenage boy.

Trust me, she doesn&apos;t have much worth ... Jeff began.

Jeff! both parents scolded lightly.

Sorry, the teenager spoke quietly.

We should punish him, Daniel suggested, echoing his husband&apos;s words
from moments earlier.

I agree. Let&apos;s make him pay a fine, Jack opined.

That works, Daniel agreed. Fifty?

Not enough, Jack said, shaking his head. One hundred.

Jack, it won&apos;t mean anything. Two hundred, Daniel recommended.

~There goes my savings account for my car,~ the teenager silently
lamented.

And we need to ground him, Jack stated. One?

Two, Daniel countered.

Not enough. That poor girl was stripped, the older man pointed
out.

Three? the younger man questioned.

Nodding his agreement, Jack looked at Jeff and stated, You&apos;re fined
two-hundred cents and grounded for three seconds. He looked at
his watch, mouthing, One ... two ... three.

You&apos;ve completed your grounding, Daniel said. The two-hundred
cents is payable to the Munchkins penny fund, as soon as you get
change.

Jeff laughed, Thanks, Dad, Daddy!

Reaching over to tap his eldest son&apos;s arm, Jack intoned, Son, I hope
you&apos;ve learned an important lesson here today.

Jeff looked at his two fathers and proclaimed, I have. I
shouldn&apos;t take justice into my own hands. I promise never to do
anything like that again, ever.

With a smile, the older man rebutted, No, Son, we covered that lesson
already -- you&apos;ve been fined and grounded, remember? And, Jeff,
while I appreciate the sentiment, don&apos;t make promises you may not be
able to keep.

So, what&apos;s the important lesson I&apos;m supposed to have learned? Jeff
inquired curiously.

With a wry smile, Daniel coaxed, Yes, Jack, do tell. Inquiring
minds want to know.

Jack began, Jeff, as you grow to be a man, you&apos;ll learn that
confession is good for the soul, but, sometimes ...

Both his husband and his eldest son leaned in, surprised that Jack was
capable of being profound.

Yes, Dad? Jeff prodded, waiting to hear the rest.

In a somber tone of voice, the older man finished, But, sometimes,
it&apos;s even better for the ego! before he cracked up with
laughter. When the three of them had composed themselves, Jack
admitted, In your shoes, Jeff, I wouldn&apos;t have been able to resist,
either. It&apos;s not like you planned this; if you had, we&apos;d be
handling the situation differently.

Likewise if your stunt had actually been dangerous, Daniel
interjected.

After exchanging a look of agreement with his soulmate, Jack continued,
Instead, Fate picked an apple and dangled it right in front of your
face. Now, how about some ice cream before dinner, just the three
of us in the study?

Enjoying the special moment, the three men selected their flavor of
choice and spent some quality fathers and son time together.

====

Daniel, I think we should report it to the school, Jack stated
seriously a bit later as the parents were working on dinner.

Report what? Daniel refuted. Babe, I agree with you. I
know in my heart that Mary Beth did that to our daughter. I am as
angry and upset as you are, but we don&apos;t have any proof. All we
have is the stupidity of her brother talking too much.

I called Sheila, Jack admitted, earning him a stare of disbelief from
his lover. Jack shrugged, saying, I wanted to know if Mary Beth
was sick, and Sheila confirmed it *and* that Peter was not sick.

I can&apos;t believe teenagers would be so vicious just because we ...
Daniel began, his voice a mixture of anger and vulnerability.

Jack put down his knife, leaving the onions on the counter. He
walked over to his agonizing husband and embraced him.

Jack, it&apos;s not fair. All we ever did was fall in love, and
because of our love, Jennifer has to suffer, Daniel spoke sadly.

Jennifer isn&apos;t suffering, Angel. She has a home and a family
because of us; you know that, Jack reminded. Life isn&apos;t
perfect, and if she wasn&apos;t having to deal with spiteful, ignorant
teens, she&apos;d be dealing with something else.

I guess you&apos;re right, Daniel admitted, looking into his soulmate&apos;s
eyes and giving him a little smile. Better finish dicing those
onions.

I love you, Angel, Jack intoned, placing a quick kiss on Daniel&apos;s
lips.

I love you, too.

====

Jennifer walked down from her room. She&apos;d had a late day herself,
going from school to accompanying Chenoa and Lulu to a matinee
movie. The trio had gotten home just before dinner was ready.

Let me tell her! Jeff pleaded with his parents.

Tell who what? Jennifer asked as she entered the hospitality
room. Anything you want me to do? she asked her parents about
the evening meal as she took note of the early preparations.

Jeff wants to talk to you, but not ... Daniel began, trailing off as
he motioned towards all the children nearby.

Jen, come on, Jeff urged, a smile on his face as he led his sister
into the living room where none of the children were. You&apos;ll
never guess!

Jeff, your room, Jack called out, hearing the voices carry.

Okay, Dad, the boy responded, leading his older sister to his bedroom.

====

Three minutes later, with Brianna watching the younger children, Jack
and Daniel decided to check on the teenagers. As they walked up
the stairs to Jeff&apos;s bedroom, they heard Jennifer whoop with laughter.

Oh, Jeff, you&apos;re the best brother! Jennifer exclaimed. You
don&apos;t have to worry about getting me a Christmas present this year
because that was all the present I needed, she said, hugging her
brother excitedly.

I gather Jeff&apos;s given you all the details, Jack interrupted as he and
Daniel walked in.

Do you believe the nerve of that witch? Jennifer lashed out.

Jen, Daniel warned. We don&apos;t have any proof, only what Jeff
overheard.

But you know it&apos;s the truth, Daddy! Jennifer refuted.

Yes, I do, the archaeologist admitted. Look, we let Jeff off
the hook pretty easy, but you both need to understand that this is an
exception.

We do, Jennifer acknowledged. She smiled as she kissed her
brother on the cheek. Thanks, Jeff.

No one treats my sister like that, Jeff responded.

Okay, it&apos;s over now, Jack stated. I wish we could do more, but
we can&apos;t, he sighed.

Jeff did enough, Jennifer stated gratefully. I&apos;m hungry.

Dinner&apos;s ready, Daniel said, stepping aside as the two teens hurried
downstairs. Jack?

Danny, how hypocritical do you feel? Jack challenged.

I&apos;d rather not think about it, but, uh, well, the truth is that I feel
so bad I&apos;m not sure I can eat more than two helpings of scalloped
potatoes, the archaeologist smirked.

Dinner&apos;s ready, Jack teased.

Laughing, the parents went downstairs to enjoy a pleasant evening with
their children.

====

The next day, the school newspaper&apos;s headline was, Student Sheds
Inhibitions at Audition! and sported a photo, neck up only, of Mary
Beth staring up in horror at her dress. Incensed, the girl
tracked down Jeff at lunch.

You did that on purpose, Mary Beth accused.

It was an accident, Jeff claimed.

Sure, and I&apos;m the Queen of England, the angry girl sarcastically
spoke.

What you are is the Queen of Spite, Mary Beth. Just leave my
sister alone from now on, Jeff bluntly advised.

I&apos;m going to tell the principal, Mary Beth threatened, turning and
beginning to walk away.

Go ahead, Jeff called out calmly. And I&apos;ll be sure to tell him
to round up your brother&apos;s cronies and ask them what your brother
boasted about you doing to Jennifer.

All of a sudden, Mary Beth stopped. She turned around, an ugly
expression on her face.

Jeff approached her, saying, I know what you did last summer ... to my
sister. He gave her a moment to let his words settle in before
adding, You contaminated her drink in science lab, giving her
mono. I *know* you did it on purpose.

You can&apos;t know anything, Mary Beth cautiously responded. ~Can
he?~

I know you have a brother who is blabbing about it all over campus,
Jeff informed her. He walked into the girl&apos;s personal space, and
following lessons learned from his general father, stared intensely
into Mary Beth&apos;s eyes. The only reason you haven&apos;t been arrested
is because we don&apos;t have proof. Neither do you, by the way, about
your little costume accident.

I ... Mary Beth began.

Not allowing her to speak, Jeff raised his voice to cut her off,
saying, I suggest we call it even, although my alleged offense is
punishable by grounding whereas yours could result in jail time.

Sexual harassment would get you more than grounded, Mary Beth huffed.

Everyone believes me, Mary Beth. They were there, and they saw
it. Even if they did believe you, I&apos;d still only be grounded and
maybe miss a day or two of school. You, on the other hand,
knowingly gave my sister a disease. That would not only get you
suspended, but a criminal record. What if she had died? Jeff
challenged.

From mono? Mary Beth spat. Get real, she spoke nastily.

Do your research, Mary Beth. In some cases, the spleen ruptures
or gets damaged. Some people have died from airway obstructions,
heart inflammation, and even from their nervous system being messed
up. Oh, yeah, Mary Beth, you could have killed her. I don&apos;t
know what the law is, but I know giving someone a disease is just like
stabbing them with a knife. So, go ahead, tell the
principal. I will gladly do the time for my crime.

You&apos;re a bore, Jeff, Mary Beth immaturely responded as she tried to
evade her guilt.

~Let&apos;s see if this bores her,~ Jeff thought. He moved another
inch closer, so close he could feel her breath against his skin. It was a move that unnerved the girl. Seeing her gulp nervously
as her defenses shattered, he added, Don&apos;t ... ever ... hurt my
sister, or any member of my family, again. Backing away, he
intoned, I hope we understand each other, Mary Beth. Besides,
you like attention. You made the front page. Everyone is
talking about you, just like you always like it.

Laughing, Jeff went on his way, his laughter growing louder as he heard
her grumble, crumple up the school paper, and kick a nearby garbage can.

====

Still angry, Mary Beth stormed into one of the bathrooms. A
minute later, Jennifer and Sheila entered, laughing about something.

STOP LAUGHING AT ME, Mary Beth ordered.

You are so self-centered, Jennifer remarked. We weren&apos;t even
talking about you. You aren&apos;t worth our time.

That&apos;s for sure, Sheila added. Jen, I&apos;ll see you after school.

Okay, bye Sheila, Jennifer said, getting ready to head into one of
the stalls.

Hold it right there, Miss Snooty. You and your brother have some
nerve, Mary Beth began.

Oh, shut up, Jennifer replied, tired of dealing with the girl. Listen, haven&apos;t you figured it out yet, Mary Beth?

That you&apos;re a stuck-up princess with queers for parents? Mary Beth
asked snottily.

Jennifer shook her head, sighing, I don&apos;t care what you think, but
what I was talking about is cause and effect. ~Daddy is so right
about his stuff,~ she thought. First, you lie about me and get
detention. Then you and your parents pick a fight at the carnival
and almost get arrested. Now you give me mono and end up being
the laughing stock of the school. Every time you try and do
something to hurt me, you get hurt. Cause and effect -- you cause
me grief, and the effect is that you end up in a situation worse than
me. Take the hint, and just leave me alone, Mary Beth. Get
a life!

You&apos;re not so high and mighty, Jen, Mary Beth called out angrily as
her adversary headed for the exit.

Jennifer just shook her head as she looked back and mused, Mary Beth,
my karma just ran all over your dogma. When Mary Beth just
gaped, her mouth wide open at the astute and subtle insult, Jennifer
lightly added, Bye, giving the frustrated teen a tiny wave of her
hand.

The oldest of the Jackson-O&apos;Neill children walked out, deciding to use
another restroom in another corridor. She felt proud of herself,
like she had truly learned the lessons her parents had tried to teach
her about ignorance and being true to yourself. Smiling, she held
her head high as she strolled through the corridor, feeling happy and
free.

====

The following Monday afternoon, Daniel stared out the kitchen window,
his focus on David who was sitting quietly in the gazebo. The boy
had a book open, but Daniel knew he wasn&apos;t really reading it. Curious, he walked outside and sat down across from the shaggy-haired
boy.

Dad always wants to give me a penny, Daniel said softly.

A penny? For what? David asked, looking up.

My thoughts. Sometimes, he offers me a nickel, and every now and
then, he makes it really tempting by dangling a quarter in front of my
nose, Daniel replied.

David smiled, but it wasn&apos;t a big one, just a tiny acknowledgement of
the humor in his father&apos;s statement.

What&apos;s going on, Son?

Nothing, David lied shyly, not making eye contact with Daniel.

David, I know something&apos;s wrong. You&apos;re not a very good liar,
Daniel stated as he leaned forward, showing his interest with body
language, too.

It&apos;s just ... David stopped, shaking his head. Nothing.

David, no holding out. Please tell me what&apos;s on your mind,
Daniel asked.

I feel guilty, the boy admitted.

Why would you feel guilty? Daniel asked, surprised by the comment.

Because I shouldn&apos;t feel how I feel, a meek voice replied.

Daniel moved over to sit next to his son. He put his arm around
David&apos;s shoulders and tugged him close.

Okay, let&apos;s try the process of elimination. Are you sick?
Daniel asked.

No, David answered softly.

Daniel prodded, Is there a problem with your homeschooling? Are
we going too fast or ...

No, I like that ... a lot.

Are you sure? Daniel asked, looking down at the boy. If you
want to go back to private school or even attend a public school, you
can. Dad and I told you that ...

No, Daddy, David interjected. I like how we study now, all
together. I learn more.

Okay, Daniel replied. Have you had a fight with your any of
your brothers and sisters? Seeing David look away, Daniel
thought, ~That&apos;s it.~

No, David answered truthfully, though still evading his younger
father&apos;s gaze.

~No? But it does have something to do with ... oh.~ Son,
are you feeling a little left out lately? When David didn&apos;t
answer at all, Daniel pulled him in closer. Don&apos;t be afraid to
tell us, David. Sometimes, there is so much going on that it&apos;s
hard to make sure everyone gets the attention they need.

No, Daddy, David said emphatically, adding, You and Dad give me lots
of attention. You give all of us attention. It&apos;s just ... I
shouldn&apos;t feel left out, but ...

But you do, Daniel asked pointedly.

A little, David admitted. The Spitfires had their party, and
the Munchkins are getting two parties, and ...

Hey, I have an idea, Daniel interrupted, glancing at his watch. Dad is going to be home soon, and then I have the rest of the day
free. How about we go flying?

Flying? David asked excitedly. Just you and me?

Yeah, just you and me, and, uh, maybe we&apos;ll do a little something else
special today.

What? David asked with big eyes.

Well, I&apos;ll have to clear it first. No promises, but let&apos;s start
with a short trip in Jo, okay? Daniel asked, referring to the family&apos;s
private airplane.

Okay! David exclaimed, hugging Daniel tightly.

As the hug continued, Daniel thought, ~I need to call Megan and have
her cancel that meeting. I don&apos;t care if we lose the deal; this
is more important.~

====

Have fun, Guys. Don&apos;t do anything I wouldn&apos;t do, Jack said a
bit later as he waved from the front door.

That leaves us with plenty of options, Dad! David yelled from the car
as Daniel turned on the ignition.

Hey!

You left yourself wide open for that one, Babe, Daniel called out as
he slowly backed down the driveway.

Jack closed the door, muttering to himself about how he got no respect.

At that moment, Brianna walked passed and smirked, Dad, talking to
yourself is the first sign of madness.

Madness, I&apos;ll give you madness, Jack mock-threatened as he gave an
evil mad scientist-type of chuckle and stalked towards his daughter, a
predatory gleam in his eye.

Dad, what are you doing? Brianna asked as she backed away, seeing
Jack waggle his fingers at her. She grinned, but still put up the
token protest, especially once she saw Little Danny coming down the
stairs. No, no, not the tickle monster. Help me, Little
Danny, help me.

Little Danny gave a grin of delight and called out to his fellow
siblings, It&apos;s the tickle monster.

Jack reached Brianna and began tickling her, only to be joined by
Little Danny, who started tickling Jack. Running footsteps could
be heard, and soon there was a pile of Jackson-O&apos;Neills lying giggling
on the floor, all tickling each other until finally, Jack, laughing
heartily, called out, Enough! The tickle monster gives.

Enough to give us ice cream? Brianna asked, winking at Chenoa and
Lulu, who quickly took up the refrain of, Ice cream, ice cream.

They were soon joined in their chorus by the twins and the
triplets. Jack gave a theatrical groan before surrendering with,
I&apos;m such a sucker.

Taking that for the permission it was, the children cheered and made a
beeline for the kitchen. Jack shook his head, pleased to see them
all happy. Little Danny seemed to have recovered from the trauma
of Jack and Daniel&apos;s attempt to rescue the Nox although the two men had
found it a little embarrassing the next time Teal&apos;c had visited. Little Danny had solemnly asked the Jaffa to remind his parents the
next time they went off on a rescue mission that lying to their
children was dishon&apos;rable.

====

Daddy, where&apos;s Bean Sprout going to sleep when he&apos;s born? David asked
as he and Daniel were up in the skies.

Bean Sprout could be a she, Daniel reminded.

He&apos;s a he, but it&apos;ll be okay if he&apos;s a she, but I know he&apos;s a
he. He has to be a he; we&apos;re outnumbered, boys to girls, I mean,
David replied.

Daniel chuckled, saying, Well, he, or she, will be in the
nursery. We need to keep him close.

See! David exclaimed.

What? Daniel asked innocently.

You said he! David happily exclaimed before breaking out into
laughter. What about Noa and Lulu?

Daniel sighed, saying, Noa likes being near you.

She has Lulu now, Daddy, David replied, staring out at the clouds and
silently naming the different types.

Son, is Noa scared about something? Daniel asked, sensing David might
have some insight on the situation.

Sometimes, she misses Mom and Dad. It was not getting to say
&apos;goodbye&apos;. It was good that time when we got to go back to our
old house, but sometimes ... David said, shrugging.

Daniel nodded, saying nothing, giving the boy time. Two minutes
passed by before David spoke again.

Daddy, it doesn&apos;t bother you that sometimes we, I mean Noa, remembers
Mom and Dad ... does it? David asked a bit hesitantly.

Quickly and without hesitation, Daniel shook his head, replying, Son,
they gave birth to you, Jen, and Noa, and they loved and adored you
long before Dad and I came into the picture. Suddenly, Daniel
blinked as a thought occurred to him. Do we need to talk more
about them?

David considered the question and said, I think for Jen and me, it&apos;s
good. We remember more, and it&apos;s easier for us to understand what
happened.

But Noa is still a little girl who misses her mother and father,
Daniel deduced.

Finding Uni, David remarked, referring to the little girl&apos;s homemade
unicorn that her mother had given her shortly before being killed in a
car accident, has helped her to remember Mommy, but ...

But ... Daniel drew a startled breath. Gawd, she&apos;s
younger. Dad and I keep trying to remind ourselves. She
needs to know it&apos;s okay to love and miss them and that&apos;s it&apos;s not ...
not disloyal to any of us. When David smiled, Daniel knew he was
right. Thanks, Son, he said. You know, right?

Sure, I do. We talk about them a lot. Daddy liked planes,
too ... Daddy, David said, suddenly giggling.

Daniel chuckled, too, as the father and son continued their special
time together.

====

After their plane ride in Jo, Daniel took David to the museum in
Denver. A new Syrian exhibition was due to open there soon, and
because he knew the curator accompanying the exhibition, Daniel had
managed to arrange a behind the scenes visit for his son.

Abdul Hamid, the curator who had traveled with the artifacts from their
home in Syria, was delighted to show them around, appreciating David&apos;s
curiosity, interest, and appreciation of the different artifacts. His fondness for the boy grew when he discovered David spoke quite a
bit of Arabic, and he beamed when David said wistfully how he&apos;d like to
visit Syria, Israel, Jordan, Iran, and a number of other countries.

Abdul looked at him curiously, asking, You do not wish to visit Iraq?

David scowled as he answered, My dad was a prisoner of war
there. Stupid government: they have no appreciation of history
and culture.

Daniel was surprised to see Abdul nod in sad agreement before telling
him, Your son is a very special boy, Daniel.

The archaeologist simply squeezed David&apos;s shoulder, saying quietly, He
certainly is.

After leaving Abdul and the museum, Daniel and David visited one of the
larger Denver bookstores. Daniel wanted to see if they had a book
he knew had come out recently, and he told David that he could choose a
book, too.

After all, you can&apos;t go into a bookshop and leave without a book; it&apos;s
just not right, Daniel said with a grin.

====

Hey, Guys, I&apos;ll be right back, Jeff told his basketball-playing
buddies at the high school.

The group of boys were shooting hoops outdoors, just for fun, after
school, something they frequently did whenever the opportunity
presented itself. Jeff still had a half hour before he had to be
home, and he was having a good time, but today, as had occurred on many
days recently, he had noticed a familiar figure standing next to a very
expensive car in the nearby parking lot.

Hamilton, what are you doing here? Jeff asked as he approached Peter.

Just watching? Is there a law against that? Peter asked as he
leaned smugly against his fancy, pristine car, arms crossed in defiance.

No, but I thought maybe you&apos;d like to play, too, Jeff suggested,
wanting to give the rich kid a break, considering that he&apos;d been blamed
for something he didn&apos;t really do in giving Jennifer mono, even though
he had also been a jerk for the way he treated the girl on their date.

Peter stared at Jeff in disbelief, and though he blinked, his response
was, Why would I want to do that?

Maybe because you like basketball? Jeff replied.

I ... wouldn&apos;t know, Peter hesitated in responding. I don&apos;t
need to get all sweaty and ...

Well, it was just a thought. Bye, Jeff said, turning and
running back to his friends, leaving Peter to whine to himself. ~I tried. I guess he really is a jerk, though.~

====

Meanwhile, Daniel and David&apos;s special day was continuing at the Barnes&amp;Noble bookstore.

After spending over an hour browsing through the history section and
practically drooling over a book on the history of Rome, David asked if
they could look in the wildlife section. Surprised by the
request, but happy to do so, Daniel led the boy to the relevant area of
the bookstore. He watched as David began looking for books on
wildlife in the Bahamas.

Son, what are you looking for? Daniel inquired curiously.

This, David said, finally finding what he&apos;d been looking for. Can I get it for Bri, Daddy? I know she loves dolphins most, but
she might like other fish, too, if she gets to know something about
them.

Daniel looked over David&apos;s shoulder as the boy began flipping through
the book.

Look, she might see a porcupine fish, David said as he pointed to
what looked like a spiky golf ball. Or a Flying Gurnard. That would be so cool.

~The photography in this book is great,~ Daniel thought as he looked at
the fish with wings and had to agree that it was a pretty cool
fish. He looked back at David, saying, It&apos;s a lovely thought,
David, but it&apos;s not necessary. Wouldn&apos;t you rather get a book for
yourself?

David shook his head, stating, I want this to be the best vacation Bri
can have.

I&apos;m sure it will be, Son, and this is a lovely thought, Daniel said
with pride in his voice.

Do you think she&apos;ll like it? David asked nervously.

She&apos;ll love it, David, Daniel reassured his son. ~We have the
best children, Jack.~

====

Just before starting for home, while David was in the restroom, Daniel
pulled out his cell phone.

Carter-Shanahan, Sam answered.

Daniel chuckled, I thought you weren&apos;t going hyphenated.

My husband&apos;s here, Sam said, smiling.

Daniel asked intuitively, Did you have a fight?

Little one. Not the first, not the last, but ... Sam said,
trailing off.

So ... you&apos;re just giving him a little reassurance? Daniel surmised,
his eyes focused on the direction of the restroom.

I knew you&apos;d understand, Sam said softly into the phone.

Been there, done that, Daniel laughed. Uh, Sam, if you have
time, I need a favor.

Shoot, Sam responded, prepared for most anything.

Well, uh, I&apos;d like you to do some research on the Morgans, Daniel
said.

The Morgans? Sam asked surprised, making a funny face while she
reached for a piece of paper.

Yeah, Phil and Ellen Morgan, the Mouseketeers birth parents. Seeing David returning, Daniel asked quickly, Sam, can we meet for
lunch tomorrow, about eleven?

Uh, yeah, sure, Daniel. O&apos;Malley&apos;s? Sam suggested.

Sounds good. I&apos;ll see you then. Thanks! Daniel put
his cell phone away just as David reached him. Ready to go home?

Ready, David contently replied. Daddy?

Yes, Son?

Shyly, the boy commented, Thanks for spending the day with me.

Believe me, David, I&apos;ve had a wonderful time; there&apos;s no other place
I&apos;d want to be today, the archaeologist spoke reassuringly.

The two shared a hug and then climbed into the Silver Fox to go home to
the rest of the family.

====

Daniel had met with Sam, giving her details that he knew about the
Morgans, and, all in all, it had been a normal day for the
Jackson-O&apos;Neill madhouse.

That evening, after eating dinner and finishing her homework, Jennifer
was at Mrs. Valissi&apos;s home, concentrating fiercely on the loom in front
of her.

~I can&apos;t believe I&apos;ve finished four of these already,~ the teenager
thought about the place mats she was creating.

The senior citizen had previously shown Jennifer how to do multiple
small pieces without re-threading, or re-warping, the loom by leaving
space between them. As soon as Jennifer was finished weaving all
fourteen, Mrs. Valissi promised to show her how to cut them apart and
finish the side edges by tying the cut threads together in little
bundles.

Seeing the hardworking teen, Mrs. Valissi urged, Jen, take a
break. The loom is not going to run away.

It&apos;s just so ... gee, I don&apos;t know how to describe it, but there&apos;s so
much to learn, Jennifer eagerly replied.

The grandmotherly woman smiled, responding, I do know you want to
learn it all, but it takes time, a lot of time. It&apos;s impossible
to learn it all in one day, or one week, or even one lifetime. People have gotten PhDs in weaving, and they still keep learning.

Sighing in agreement, the teen pushed her chair back and moved to the
dining room with her &apos;Grandma Sophia&apos;, who had brought out a plate of
biscotti -- Italian cookies -- for them to enjoy while they chatted.

Andie, here&apos;s a treat for you, too, Mrs. Valissi said, handing her
shepherd-collie mix a homemade biscuit. Now go lay down, she
instructed, smiling as the dog found its favorite spot near the sofa
and relaxed. Returning to the dining room, she sat down next to
Jennifer and inquired, How are things at home?

====

Almost twenty minutes later, Mrs. Valissi realized that, in spite of
her probing questions, she had been doing most of the talking. Putting her hand atop the teen&apos;s she said, I hope you know you can
talk to me about anything, Jen. Your fathers are both wonderful
men, but they are men.

Thanks, Jennifer said softly, looking downward.

The elderly woman smiled as she intoned, You haven&apos;t said anything
specific, but I can spot a broken heart a mile away. I wouldn&apos;t
presume to replace any of your aunts, Dear, but I was married for
several decades to a wonderful man, and I can keep a secret. Sometimes it&apos;s easier to talk to someone not quite so close. Patting the girl&apos;s hand, she gently coaxed, You&apos;ll feel better if you
get it off your chest.

I&apos;m fine, Grandma Sophia, now that I&apos;m over the mono, Jennifer
assured, adding, But, thank you, anyway.

You&apos;re welcome, Jennifer. Mrs. Valissi finished off her drink
and opined, I think I&apos;ve had enough of talking for a bit. How
about we put on some music?

Of course, Grandma, anything you&apos;d like, is how Jennifer responded,
but inwardly, she was thinking, ~I wonder how long would be considered
polite to listen before I can excuse myself? I just want to go
home and wallow for awhile.~

After putting on the CD, the astute woman brought over the CD case for
Jennifer to look at. It was Rod Stewart&apos;s &apos;Great American
Songbook, Volume IV&apos;. The first cut was a duet with Diana Ross
called I&apos;ve Got a Crush on You. As the voices filled the air,
the teenager became entranced by the voice of a singer who had been
born before her older father. Soft and melodious, with a trace of
a compelling rasp, Rod&apos;s voice blended with Diana&apos;s in a lighthearted
declaration of love, which ended with the line, The world will pardon
my mush, &apos;cause I&apos;ve got a crush, my baby, on you.

~That was good!~ Jennifer thought. ~That was really good.~

The teenager relaxed a little and decided to listen to a bit more as
the next cut began. It was I Wish You Love, a song about
wishing one&apos;s former beloved the simple comforts of living and the hope
that love will find them again. Jennifer found her eyes misting
as she thought about Peter. Though she was hurt and disappointed,
she couldn&apos;t find it in her heart to hate him.

As the song reached its crescendo -- My breaking heart and I agree,
that you and I could never be, so with my best, my very best, I set you
free. I wish you shelter from the storm, a cozy fire to keep you
warm, but most of all, when snowflakes fall, I wish you love. -- she
broke down and cried, holding her face in her hands.

Leaning in, Mrs. Valissi put her arms around the sobbing teen and
rubbed her back while she murmured soothing words, saying, It&apos;s all
right, Jen. Let it all out. That&apos;s right, just let it all
out.

Jennifer didn&apos;t need the woman&apos;s permission. In the shelter of
Mrs. Valissi&apos;s arms, unable to stop her outburst, she cried a flood of
cleansing tears that she couldn&apos;t have cried with her fathers, or even
alone. The hurt, disappointment, and confusion she had carried
all summer was finally being released.

After wiping her eyes, Jennifer looked at her adopted grandmother and
apologized, I didn&apos;t mean to lose control like that. I&apos;m sorry.

For what, Dear? For having emotions? Nonsense! Now,
Grandma Sophia is all ears. Tell me all about it.

Well ... I guess it was, golly, Grandma Sophia, it seems like
yesterday when I first saw him. He was so dreamy, Jennifer began.

For the next forty-five minutes, Jennifer talked non-stop about her
anguish -- all about Peter, meeting him, when he finally spoke to her
for the first time, their secret talks, their kiss in the park; and
about her illness, finding out that she had been deliberately infected,
her spat with Brianna and how badly she felt about it. She talked
about how much she hurt over Peter&apos;s behavior toward her, how much she
had trusted him, only to find out she&apos;d made the biggest mistake of her
life.

Finally, Jennifer drew a deep breath and sighed, I&apos;ll never trust a
boy like that again, not ever.

Intuitively, Mrs. Valissi replied, Jennifer, you may be fighting it,
but you still care a great deal for this boy who broke your heart so
callously.

I hate him, Jennifer practically whispered, not really believing it
herself.

Nodding in understanding, and looking a bit far off, the senior citizen
suggested, There are second chances, Dear, if you believe in someone
enough to forgive them.

Jennifer studied the woman and replied, Did ... No, he couldn&apos;t have.

What, Jen?

You had a great life with Mister Valissi. You&apos;ve told me so many
stories about your life together. He couldn&apos;t have hurt you, not
like Peter hurt me, Jennifer stated.

Jennifer, you *are* so young, the woman replied. Yes, I&apos;m
afraid we both hurt each other. It&apos;s part of growing together
with someone. I had to make a choice, forgive or move on. You see, Mister Valissi was once unfaithful to me.

Jennifer gasped and looked at the older woman as if she had sprouted a
third eye. Not saying a word, she shook her head in disbelief,
both at the words and of the action.

Jen, it&apos;s not uncommon for Italian men to keep a mistress. I
never thought my husband would do that to me, but I was busy with our
new baby and forgot about his needs and desires. He did what came
naturally to him as a man and what he had seen his father and the men
of that generation do. The women suffered in silence and nodded
knowingly to one another. When I found out about his betrayal, I
refused to play that game. I packed and left with our baby, &apos;my&apos;
baby, I thought.

Wow, Jennifer sighed, taking it all in. Um, so, how did you
get back together? she asked curiously.

Time passed; months went by. I found I couldn&apos;t dismiss my
husband from my mind. Angry or hurt, both maybe, I couldn&apos;t deny
that I missed him terribly, and I didn&apos;t want our son to be without his
father. He called one day, asking to see me. Mrs. Valissi
smiled warmly, letting out a contented sigh as she recalled, He wanted
to buy me lunch.

When Mrs. Valissi paused again and let out a chuckle, Jen urged, Go
on, Grandma.

I was dressed to the nines, and you know what? He showed up in
his best suit, the one I had always said was my favorite. I was
expecting a fancy restaurant, but he took me to a park, opened a bag of
sandwiches and two sodas, and handed me a few flowers that he picked
along the way. We couldn&apos;t take our eyes off each other. He
said he was sorry that he had been unfaithful and that he had not seen
his mistress, or any woman, since I had left. He felt ashamed and
told me that his guilt had kept him from calling, though he had
regularly sent me checks to help pay the expenses for Robert.

Lost in her reverie, the woman paused again. She closed her eyes,
and she smiled. In fact, Jennifer could swear she was glowing.

Grandma? Grandma Sophia? the teenager called out.

I got lost there for a second, Mrs. Valissi spoke brightly. Mister Valissi got down on one knee and opened a small box. It
held a ring with a much bigger diamond than the one he gave me when he
had first proposed. He asked me to marry him all over
again. Then he took me to a hotel downtown, and we celebrated our
love. Six weeks later, we renewed our vows. It wasn&apos;t easy,
Jen; we had to forgive each other. Seeing the teenager&apos;s frown,
she requested, Don&apos;t be too harsh on my dear husband. I made
mistakes, too. I took him for granted. We were married, and
I treated him like he was not important anymore. We had to put
the past behind us and learn to trust each other again. No, it
wasn&apos;t easy, but we loved each other enough to build our love, even
stronger than it was before.

Wow. You must have really loved him. I mean, wow. Thanks for sharing all of this with me, Grandma Sophia, Jennifer
replied.

Just think, Jennifer, of all the years of happiness and joy I would
have missed if I had felt sorry for myself and kept my heart hard out
of pride. If I had never let the pain and the hurt go, I would
have had a very different life, and my dear, you need to know, that my
husband and I had a *wonderful* and *fulfilling* life together. I
miss him so much, Mrs. Valissi intoned, a smile on her face, but her
eyes watery.

I think I understand, Grandma Sophia, Jennifer emotionally
responded. It&apos;s kind of late. I guess I&apos;d better go now.

Mrs. Valissi walked the girl to her front door, where they
hugged. She watched Jennifer go down the walk to her house next
door, and then turned around, ambling over to a picture of her husband
that sat on a table in the living room.

We did make mistakes, but what a life we had. We weren&apos;t
perfect, my love, but our life together was. I do miss you, Mrs.
Valissi sighed as she brought the photo to her chest and held it close.

====

Jennifer took her time walking home, ambling slowly, lost in her
strange newfound feelings. She felt lighter, somehow, as if a
weight had been lifted from her shoulders, and she felt strangely odd
about Mrs. Valissi&apos;s confession. She must have loved her husband
so very much to have forgiven him his infidelity.

~Dad and Daddy talk a lot about forgiveness and second chances. Dad says he&apos;d be out in the cold if Daddy didn&apos;t have such a forgiving
heart,~ the teenager thought as she began to walk up the driveway.

Could she give Peter a second chance? Should she?

~Yeah, right, like he&apos;d ever ask for one. Just not his style,~
Jennifer sighed just as she reached her front door.

We were about to send out search parties, Jack commented lightly when
Jennifer walked through the door.

Sorry, we were just talking, and I guess time slipped away from
me. Mrs. Valissi is an amazing woman. You&apos;d never guess it
to look at her, but boy, has she ever lived a life, Jennifer said with
admiration, after which she became very quiet and still.

Go on, Jen, Daniel urged after several seconds had passed.

Oh, I&apos;m sorry, Jennifer said, a shy smile on her face.

That must have been some girl talk; you were gazing off into space,
Jack surmised, smiling.

I&apos;m just a little tired, so I&apos;m going to go to bed. Goodnight,
Jennifer informed her parents, hugging both of them and then walking
towards the stairs that led to her upstairs bedroom.

Are you okay, Jen? a concerned Daniel asked as he followed her part
way down the hall, leaving Jack in the living room to answer a phone
call.

I&apos;m fine, Daddy, really. I worked really hard tonight and stayed
later than I intended to. I just need some sleep, Jennifer
answered.

Okay, Sweetie. Just don&apos;t push yourself too hard; you&apos;re still
recovering, Daniel reminded. He started back for the living room
but hesitated, turning back around. He called out, Jen?

The teen appeared at the bottom of the stairs and asked, Yes, Daddy?

Do you need to talk about anything? I ... I know we&apos;re not
women, and that limits us sometimes, but Dad and I are always here for
you, if you need us, the younger man told their daughter.

I know. Thanks. Daniel waited, and so did the teenager,
both somehow sensing that their conversation wasn&apos;t quite
finished. You never know what someone&apos;s story is until you take
the time to listen to them. Everyone has untold stories, don&apos;t
they, Daddy?

Surprised at the turn their talk had taken, Daniel responded, No Jen,
you really don&apos;t. That&apos;s what makes being with someone you love
and who loves you so special. They listen, don&apos;t judge you, and
they accept you for who you are. They also help you to accept who
you are, even the parts you think are ugly or unworthy. What
brought all this up?

Just thinking, Jennifer quietly answered.

About? Daniel prodded as he closed the gap between them.

About Peter and Mary Beth, Jennifer responded, pausing between each
name. They each hurt me, but in a different way. I can&apos;t
believe I&apos;m thinking this, but I&apos;m wondering what their stories are,
and if I knew, would it make a difference? Does that mean I&apos;m
wimpy, or weird?

Sweetheart, it means you&apos;re growing up. One piece of advice to
remember, though, Daniel gently advised. Just because you can
put yourself in someone&apos;s shoes doesn&apos;t mean you have to put yourself
in their path. Self-disregard can masquerade as heroism and
self-sacrifice. It isn&apos;t noble, if you don&apos;t value yourself.

That&apos;s a lot to think about, Jennifer intoned.

Nodding, Daniel replied, Yes, it is. Now, get some sleep, and
remember to take care of yourself.

I will, Jennifer promised. Daddy, Bri hurt me, too, the teen
noted almost as an afterthought.

Sweetie, when you love someone, somewhere along the line, you&apos;re going
to hurt them. It&apos;s part of life. Don&apos;t you think you hurt
Bri, too? Daniel asked gently.

Yes, I know I did. I ... I guess it sort of evens out in the
end, Jennifer remarked.

Don&apos;t keep score, Jen; that&apos;s a mistake, Daniel advised strongly, his
eyes boring into hers. We&apos;re human. We make mistakes, and,
as a result, sometimes we do hurt the ones we love. When that
happens, we apologize, do our best to fix whatever wronged was
incurred, or to at least try to truly understand what happened and
why. Then, Jen, we move on, and pray we&apos;ve learned a lesson we
won&apos;t forget.

Thanks, Daddy. Goodnight, Jennifer intoned softly, giving her
younger father a smile before she turned and went up the stairs.

~Spending time with Mrs. Valissi is good for Jen,~ Daniel thought as he
rejoined his husband in the living room.

====

Inside her room, Jennifer pondered all that had happened this
evening. She felt like a stranger to herself, and she knew she
wouldn&apos;t be quite the same after her talk with Mrs. Valissi.

As the evening wore on, Jennifer undressed, put on her nightgown, and
climbed into bed. The sandman made his appearance in a few
minutes, and the formerly burdened teen slept the most peaceful
untroubled sleep she had known in months.

====

She looks so peaceful, Jack, Daniel observed about Jennifer when the
parents did their nightly rounds to check on their children.

The lovers were standing next to each other, their arms around each
other&apos;s waists as they watched their eldest daughter sleeping, a tiny
smile on her face. That was something they hadn&apos;t seen for a
while. In fact, up until the last couple of weeks, Jennifer&apos;s
sleep had been restless. Tonight, though, she looked calm.

I&apos;m relieved, Danny. The extra time she&apos;s spending with Mrs. V
is good for her. I&apos;m not sure what&apos;s going on over there, but I&apos;d
bet a donut Mrs. V is responsible for Jen&apos;s being more relaxed lately,
especially tonight, Jack commented.

I think Mrs. Valissi likes having someone to talk to, and Jen is
listening to what she&apos;s being taught, Daniel noted.

Mrs. V has a lot to teach; she&apos;s lived through a lot, Jack added.

And I think that&apos;s what Jen is learning. We wouldn&apos;t want to
insult Mrs. Valissi by making her think we feel obligated, but maybe
something will come along that will allow us to show her our
appreciation one day, Daniel replied hopefully.

My genius, Jack said with a grin as rubbed against Daniel&apos;s
side. C&apos;mon, let&apos;s check on the rest of the brood and get some
sleep.

**Yeah, like you want to get me in bed to sleep!**

**Well, yes, afterwards.**

Smiling, the two lovers walked to check on their children, anticipating
enjoying each other just a few minutes from now.

====

Their check on the brood completed, Jack and Daniel readied themselves
for eventual sleep in their bedroom. At the moment, they were
discussing Jennifer and her growing attachment to their older
neighbor. Daniel had also told Jack about the exchange he and
their oldest daughter had shared earlier.

She did seem, well, a bit subdued, Jack commented.

Subdued can be good, Jack, Daniel responded.

I suppose so, Jack hesitantly agreed.

So? Daniel prodded.

So? a clueless Jack asked with a shrug.

So, subdue me, already, ya Big Hunk! Daniel seductively requested.

Smiling, the two lovers were anything but subdued as their passion
united their bodies before settling in for a good night&apos;s sleep.

====

Late the next afternoon, after having gotten a report from Sam, Daniel
entered the study. All the children were either upstairs or
outside, as were the various critters, with the exception of Mittens
who was having a great time annoying Jack as he tried to do some
business accounting.

Cats! Jack growled.

Meow! Mittens responded as she walked across the keyboard.

I&apos;ll meow you into meow stew! the general threatened unconvincingly.

Purrrrrrr, Mittens said, rubbing against Jack&apos;s hand.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, Jack groaned.

Having problems, Babe? Daniel chuckled.

No, just the usual. Danny, you&apos;ve got that look. What&apos;s
wrong? Jack asked, concerned.

Jack, I know there&apos;s a lot to do with the Munchkins&apos; birthday almost
here, but I have a little trip I&apos;d like to take, Daniel explained as
he leaned against the desk.

I&apos;m listening, Jack said, biting his tongue at the immediate
resistance that was wanting to come out.

I told you about my conversation with David; you know, about Noa,
Daniel stated.

Yes, I recall. And? the older man prompted.

I had an idea, Daniel answered, adding, And I had Sam do some
research, but I don&apos;t want her doing the legwork. I think we need
to do it, but since we can&apos;t both be gone right now, I&apos;d like to do it.

Okay, Angel. Tell me what&apos;s going on in that brain of yours,
Jack requested, feeling his resistance fading simply from the tone of
Daniel&apos;s voice.

Jack, Jen, David, and Noa don&apos;t have much of their parents. They
only have a handful of possessions and a few scattered photos. Noa needs to know who her birth parents were. I don&apos;t care that
she was a baby when they died, she remembers them. We know that,
Daniel stated emphatically.

I agree, Jack affirmed.

Noa needs more, Babe. She needs to ... to know her birth
parents, to ... to sense the connection between her and them, a
passionate Daniel explained.

There aren&apos;t any possessions, Danny. We got everything that was
left when we went to their old house, Jack replied.

Babe, what do we do anytime we go to a children&apos;s party or an event
held at someone else&apos;s house? Daniel asked. Seeing the vacant
stare on his soulmate&apos;s face, he answered, We take pictures, and who
is in those pictures?

Our children, Jack responded automatically, preparing to argue until
his brain processed what Daniel was intimating. Leaning forward,
he added, And pictures of other people.

Right. Jack, I tried to remember everything Jen and David have
told us about their old neighborhood, and I had Sam get some background
on the Morgans. Maybe ... maybe if we track down some of their
old neighbors, old friends, we can find some of those pieces that Noa
needs to make that connection, the younger man suggested, his hands
gripping the edge of Jack&apos;s desk.

What&apos;s the itinerary? Jack asked calmly.

You&apos;re not ... arguing?

No, because I think you&apos;re right about Noa. I talked to her
again about changing rooms, and she&apos;s insistent on staying in the
nursery, even after Bean Sprout is born. She&apos;s scared of being
separated from David, Jack observed.

And from us, because her birth parents died. I don&apos;t know why I
think this will help with that, but I do. I think if she could
see pictures, she&apos;d feel better. Gawd, I don&apos;t know. Maybe
I&apos;m wrong, Daniel lamented, staring downward.

~Never.~ Jack shook his head as he stood up. He pulled
Daniel into his arms and expressed with conviction, No, you&apos;re not
wrong. I&apos;ll handle things here.

I love you, Jack.

To the moon and the stars and back again, Angel, Jack crooned as the
lovers held each other tightly.

====

Daniel left early the next morning and headed out to the neighborhood
where the Morgans used to live. He had a list of names that
Jennifer had been able to give him, but it wasn&apos;t very long. The
names she knew were those of her own friends, rather than those of her
parents or Chenoa&apos;s friends. He&apos;d decided to start with those
names first, then move onto the neighbors. He figured that
friends were more likely to have photos of the Morgans than neighbors.

Daniel knocked on the door of the first house he had listed, and as he
waited for an answer, he sent up a silent prayer -- ~Please, let me
find something to help Noa.~

Hello, how can I help you? a woman asked politely.

Mrs. Lawson? Daniel asked.
 
The woman nodded, looking wary, and Daniel smiled, hoping to put her at
ease.

Hi, my name is Daniel Jackson-O&apos;Neill. I understand you used to
be friends with the Morgans and their children, Jennifer, David and
Chenoa.

Mrs. Lawson gave him a sad smile, saying, Yes, we did know the
Morgans. They were a lovely couple, had delightful children.

The children are still delightful, Mrs. Lawson, Daniel informed her
as his smile grew. And that&apos;s the reason I&apos;m here. A
number of years ago my partner and I adopted all three children.

Oh my.

At hearing this, all of the woman&apos;s hesitancy vanished, and she
beckoned Daniel in, eager to hear how the Morgan children were faring.

====

Half an hour later, having been thoroughly plied with coffee and
biscuits, Daniel left, carrying a small pile of photos and having added
a few more names to his list of people the Morgans had been close
friends with.

Daniel looked at the house he&apos;d just left, feeling a little guilty that
he hadn&apos;t been completely open with the woman. He and Jack had
decided it would be better to avoid mentioning that his partner was
another man. Hopefully, the type of people the Morgans had been
friends with wouldn&apos;t be bothered by it, but they didn&apos;t want to risk
it, if it meant not getting Chenoa the keepsakes she needed. Daniel refused to lie about the identity of his life partner if someone
asked, but he wasn&apos;t going to volunteer the information.

As the day went on, Daniel&apos;s little pile of photos grew, but it wasn&apos;t
until the late afternoon that he hit the jackpot. One of the
names Mrs. Lawson had given him had been of a couple that had children
the same age as Chenoa and David. Daniel had barely had time to
explain what he was after before being ushered indoors by a very
excited woman.

I have just the thing, Mister Jackson-O&apos;Neill.

Please, call me Daniel, the smiling man requested.

Daniel, and call me Chris. I&apos;m so pleased to hear Noa is happy
and well. Such a lovely child. Now you wait right there; I
just have to remember where it is.

Daniel watched the over-excited woman with a small smile, hoping that
she could find whatever she was looking for. She didn&apos;t seem to
be the most organized of people.

I know it&apos;s here somewhere ... now where did we put it ... Ah huh,
here it is! she said, jumping up and brandishing a video tape. Now, let&apos;s just make sure it&apos;s the right one.

Chris turned on the television and stuck the tape in. After a
couple of seconds of white noise a picture came onto the screen of a
young toddler taking some first tentative steps.

That&apos;s my Amy, Chris said proudly of the girl on the screen.

The woman fast-forwarded the tape a little until another scene came
on. Daniel had to swallow the lump in his throat as he saw a very
young Chenoa toddling her way over to a woman who Daniel knew from
photos was Mrs. Morgan.

Ellen was a wonderful mother, so devoted to her children, Chris said
mournfully about the Mouseketeer&apos;s mother. She was a pageant
queen, and she said one day, Noa would be, too.

Daniel nodded and then curiosity got the better of him, so he asked,
Didn&apos;t she think Jen would be a pageant participant?

Well, I think it was more that Ellen sensed that Noa was just like
her. Jenny took after both her parents, but she had a lot more of
Phil in her. Noa ... Noa was special. Chris took a gasping
breath as she hesitated. Then she looked at Daniel and said, I
don&apos;t think Jenny and David ever knew this, but Ellen had a very hard
time with Noa&apos;s birth, and Noa had a hard time herself. With a
small smile, she continued, Ellen believed that gave them a little
extra bond, something that went beyond the usual. Noa always
clung to her.

She misses her mother, Daniel said softly.

Any child would, Daniel. I think this is a wonderful thing
you&apos;re doing. Let me hook up a second VCR, and I can make you a
copy of this, the sympathetic woman offered.

Thank you, Chris, Daniel spoke.

As she hooked up the units, Chris asked, Have you spoken with Aida?

The name sounded familiar, so Daniel checked the list of names. Aida Martindale appeared on both Sam and Jennifer&apos;s list, but she lived
in a rural Idaho community.

No, uh, I haven&apos;t, Daniel answered.

You should. She was Ellen&apos;s best friend. They went to
college together. I didn&apos;t know her well, but anytime there was a
special occasion, Aida was there, Chris commented as she completed the
hookup and put in the videotapes.

Was she there when Noa was born? Daniel asked.

I think so, Chris replied as she double-checked the VCR connections,
not wanting to take a chance on a faulty recording.. I was out
of town at the time myself.

~I need to go there,~ Daniel thought.

====

Jack, it&apos;s Daniel, the archaeologist spoke into his cell phone after
the beep. I guess you&apos;re with the children. I *am* going to make
that trip. I already checked the routes. I&apos;ll be taking Jo;
that way I don&apos;t have to worry about flight times. I&apos;ll keep you
posted. I love you.

Daniel disconnected the call and headed for the airport. He
already had a bag packed. He hadn&apos;t been sure whether or not he&apos;d
have to make the trip that he had outlined tentatively with his husband
the night before, but after speaking with Chris, he knew it was a
necessity.

====

Mrs. Martindale, my name is Daniel Jackson-O&apos;Neill, and, uh, I&apos;d like
a few minutes of your time, Daniel requested as he stood at the door
of the home, his rental car visible on the street behind him.

My husband will be home soon, the leery woman spoke.

Would you like me to wait? Daniel asked.

What is it you want? Aida asked cautiously, keeping the door only
slightly ajar.

I&apos;d like to talk to you about Ellen Morgan. More specifically,
about her children, Daniel informed the woman.

Ellen, Aida sighed. I miss her. Suddenly, she stood up
a little straighter and let the door open back more. Do you know
where her children are?

Daniel smiled, reaching back into his pocket. He opened it,
revealing current photographs of Jennifer, David, and Chenoa.

Oh my, Aida commented, tears welling up in her eyes as she pressed
her hands against her chest. They&apos;ve grown so much. Ellen
would be so proud, she said. Please, come in.

====

Ellen laughed, having heard yet another funny story about the children
of her good friend, but then she queried, Daniel, you didn&apos;t come all
this way to fill me in on Ellen&apos;s kids. Why are you here?

Daniel explained about Chenoa and that he was searching for connections
to her mother, things that might help, and though he had hit the
jackpot with Chris, he still felt like there was more that Chenoa
needed.

I have exactly what that little angel needs, Aida told him. This will take a couple of minutes. I&apos;ll be back.

A few minutes later, Aida returned with a box load of treasures.

I&apos;m notorious for keeping things. My husband says that I&apos;m the
epitome of a pack rat, Aida laughed. She began to pull out a
pile of letters, bundled together. As I assume you know, Ellen and I
met in college. We kept in touch frequently. These are her
letters. In them, she sighed, taking a deep breath to avoid
crying, is the history of Ellen&apos;s love for Phil, their shock of being
pregnant so soon with Jennifer, David&apos;s smarts, and the near-agony of
Noa&apos;s birth. Daniel, Ellen was a prolific writer, but these are
her emotions. The woman handed the pile to Daniel, urging, You
give these to those children. Their mother was a wonderful
person, and they each deserve to know that.

Thank you, Daniel spoke quietly as he held the large stack in his
hands.

I was out of the country when Ellen and Phil died; I didn&apos;t even know
about it until a month later. I called, and the phone was out of
order. I made a few calls. Daniel, I tried to find those
kids, but they were gone. Please tell them that. I ask that
because Ellen and I had made a promise to take care of each other&apos;s
children. I swear on all that is holy, I tried to find
them. They wouldn&apos;t tell me anything. I ... I was so
angry. Dealing with the government was a nightmare, Aida
intoned, wiping a tear from her eye.

I understand; I&apos;m, uh, acquainted with red tape, Daniel sighed.

Maybe I should have tried harder, but they&apos;re together, and they&apos;re
happy. I can see that in the photos you showed me. You and
your wife are very lucky. She is a good mother? Seeing
Daniel&apos;s hesitation, Aida pulled back and prompted, Daniel?

She&apos;s a he, Daniel confided.

Oh, I see. Suddenly, Aida became nervous. She sighed,
closing her eyes. People sometimes are the best they can be, but
they aren&apos;t perfect.

I, uh, agree, Daniel replied, a bit confused by the woman&apos;s last
comment.

My husband will be home in just a few minutes. Daniel, I&apos;m going
to get one more thing that I have in my room. It&apos;s a compilation
tape that I made after Ellen and Phil died. It has friends and
family, but there&apos;s a segment devoted to Ellen. She was pregnant
with Noa towards the end, but ... then you&apos;ll have to leave. I&apos;m
afraid my husband isn&apos;t as ... tolerant as I&apos;d like.

I understand, Daniel acknowledged, realizing now that Aida was
talking about her husband being his best, but not perfect.

A minute later, Aida handed Daniel the tape, saying, I&apos;m glad I made
copies for people. You know, I&apos;m not even sure what else is on
here, but it&apos;s all related to Ellen. If you have questions,
please call ... during business days when my husband isn&apos;t home, she
requested, her eyes full of sadness about having to make that
request. After her visitor nodded, she tenderly requested, Take
care of those kids.

Thank you, Aida, and we will, Daniel spoke gratefully.

====

Daniel closed the front door quietly, setting his overnight bag and the
bag of collected Morgan treasures on the floor. He was
immediately greeted enthusiastically by two sleepy beagles.

Hey, Girls, I&apos;m pleased to see you too. Is everything all right
here? Is Jack asleep? Daniel inquired.

No, a quiet droll voice answered from the stairs. He couldn&apos;t
sleep without his Danny Blanket.

Daniel smiled and moved into his husband&apos;s embrace. The two men
just stood there for a few minutes, holding each other and savoring the
feeling of having the other in their arms after a day apart.

Missed you, Angel.

I missed you too, Babe. Sorry I&apos;m so late, but it was worth
taking that trip to Idaho, Daniel stated.

I wasn&apos;t sure you&apos;d make it back tonight, Jack stated.

Jack felt Daniel grin against his neck and smiled as well when he heard
the sheepish, I thought about staying the night in Idaho, but I need
my Jack Pillow to sleep well, so I came home instead. Good thing
I took Jo.

I&apos;m glad you came home, Danny, Jack intoned, stealing a quick kiss,
shortened when Daniel let out a huge yawn. Jack chuckled, saying,
Go on. I&apos;ll take the bags upstairs while you check on the brood.

The younger man kissed his husband lovingly, without yawning this time,
and then began making the rounds. No matter how late it was when
they got home, both men always checked the children before getting into
bed themselves.

~I think the items I collected today will help you, Noa.~ Daniel
thought as he checked on the little girl. ~You&apos;re a tough little
cookie, though, aren&apos;t you?~ He turned to look at Lulu, thinking,
~And you&apos;re our other tough little cookie.~ The loving father
pulled the covers up over the sleeping girl and suddenly cursed himself
for his thoughtlessness. ~Geez. Our poor little Lulu. I wonder if we&apos;ve done enough to help you remember your birth parents
and your first adoptive parents?~

Even though Lulu had lost her parents when she was a baby, she
undoubtedly still wondered about them. Then there was the first
couple that had adopted her. Lulu had spent five years with them before
their sudden deaths. Daniel vowed to talk to Jack about
that. In the end, it only took time and effort, and they had so
many resources at their disposal.

~Lil&apos; Bit, we&apos;ll find the answers to your questions, too. Dad and
I aren&apos;t afraid to let you love your birth parents and your adoptive
parents. They were good people, and they deserve to be remembered
by you.~

Daniel placed a kiss on Lulu&apos;s forehead and after a final glance back
at Chenoa continued his rounds. He had one more child to say
goodnight to.

====

Bean Sprout, you&apos;re going to have a lot of questions, and I&apos;m not sure
we&apos;re going to have the answers, but we&apos;ll try. Your brothers and
sisters are incredible people; you&apos;re going to love them so much. Goodnight, Bean Sprout. Goodnight to you, too, Toto. We&apos;re
trusting you to keep our baby safe.

Placing a kiss on the rubbery material, Daniel paused for a lingering
look before turning off the light in the den and going to the bedroom.

====

That&apos;s a good point about Lulu, Danny, Jack said, rubbing his lover&apos;s
back.

Maybe she&apos;s not thinking about it, but I think we should be
prepared. At some point, Jack, she&apos;ll want to know. That&apos;s
human nature, Daniel commented.

Yeah, Jack agreed, deep in thought about the subject.

Jack, do you think we should give the Mouseketeers the things I
collected right away or wait until after the Munchkins&apos; party? Daniel
asked as the lovers continued to snuggle in bed.

Jack thought for a moment, absentmindedly caressing Daniel&apos;s back as he
did so.

I think we should wait until after the Munchkins&apos; party. Mainly
because I think it would be nice for them to have time to explore
everything as much as they want to once we give it all to them. I
don&apos;t want to give them these mementos and then tell them they can&apos;t
look at them yet because they have to come to the party, Jack stated.

I don&apos;t want them to resent having to wait though. I would hope
that they&apos;d choose to come to the Munchkins&apos; party, knowing that
everything will be waiting for them when they get back, Daniel
remarked, his fingers toying with his husband&apos;s chest hairs.

Jack looked at Daniel knowingly as he responded, You&apos;re going to feel
guilty if we don&apos;t give them those things as soon as possible, aren&apos;t
you?

Daniel hesitated and then admitted, I just don&apos;t think we have the
right to keep anything from them. Even just knowing that we have
these things for them ... I want them to know that they have more of
their parents than they think they do.

Jack nodded as he agreed, We&apos;ll do it tomorrow.

====

You collected all this? For us? Jennifer asked as she looked up
at her parents with tears in her eyes.

Mommy, Noa said softly as she gazed at one of the photos Aida
Martindale had given Daniel.

In her letters to her friend, Ellen Morgan had often included photos of
her family. The one Chenoa was currently staring at showed Ellen fixing
the wings on a fairy costume that a fourteen-month-old Chenoa was
wearing. The photo had been taken just four months before the
Morgans had been killed.

Jennifer looked at the photo and hugged her sister, saying, I remember
that. David and I were both in a Christmas pageant, and you
wanted to dress up, too, so Mom made you a fairy costume.

David was looking through a pile of letters and then laughed.

David? Jennifer asked.
 
Grinning, David held up a piece of paper that had three different-sized
handprints on it, each with the names of one of the Morgan children.

You got the ink all over us, Noa, David said.

Chenoa laughed, not really remembering that event.

Noa, I want to show you something, Daniel said. He put a
videotape in the VCR and hit &apos;play&apos;, watching as the Morgan children
realized their mother was on the screen. See anyone you know?

Mommy, Chenoa answered softly, pointing to her big-bellied mother.

This was the same month you were born. Your mommy was at a baby
shower to celebrate your birth, Daniel explained. Look at her
smile.

That&apos;s me! Chenoa said, pointing at her mother&apos;s belly. Her
face was alight with wonder. Jen, that&apos;s Mommy and me!

Yes, it is, Jennifer confirmed. You were a big baby.

After digesting that tape, Daniel put on the tape from Chris, and
watched as Chenoa recognized herself toddling up to her mother. Several other moments, though brief and scattered, were on the tape.

Jen, Mommy&apos;s so pretty! Chenoa happily remarked.

She sure was, Jennifer agreed, smiling with an abundance of gratitude
at Daniel and trying not to lose control as the lump in her throat grew
in size with each new glimpse of her mother.

Listen, Daniel said. All these letters and everything here are
for all of you. There&apos;s no rush in going through them; uh, they
should probably stay with Jen for safekeeping, though.

Daddy, can we make copies of the video and convert it to DVD? David
asked.

I think that would be a good idea, Daniel agreed, looking at Jack and
getting a confirming nod.

Suddenly, Chenoa gasped as she found another special picture, one of
her mother actually crocheting Uni, her handmade unicorn.

**Her mother is becoming real again, Jack.**

**I think this is exactly what Noa needed, Danny.**

Just then, there was a knock on the door, and Jack answered it, finding
Sam and Pete there. In a flash, Chenoa ran up to Sam and grabbed
her hand.

Aunt Sam, come see my mommy. She so pretty. Come see, Aunt
Sam! Chenoa excitedly beckoned, grabbing her fellow blonde&apos;s hand.

A bit confused, Sam followed Chenoa back into the living room.

Daddy, play it again, please, Chenoa requested anxiously.

Hi, Sam, Pete, Daniel greeted before restarting the tape.

Look! Chenoa exclaimed, her eyes glued to the screen.

Wow, Sam expressed as she knelt down, her position just slightly
behind Chenoa. She put her arms around the young girl and smiled
as she said, Your mother was very beautiful, Noa.

I was in her tummy, too. Daddy, show Aunt Sam, Chenoa requested.

As Chenoa rambled on, going a mile-a-minute, Daniel put the other tape
back on. He and Jack were both amazed at just how much the little
girl remembered, though they weren&apos;t that surprised, especially since
they knew Little Danny remembered things from his first year of life,
too.

It seemed strange to Jack and Daniel in ways since neither of them had
such early recollections, but watching Chenoa&apos;s face, they had no doubt
that she did remember times spent with her parents. This current
stroll down memory lane was something they realized she needed to do in
order to remind herself that her birth parents were indeed real.

====

Along with the joy and thrill of the Mouseketeers&apos; exploring all the
items that Daniel had collected for them, the children were excited
about the Munchkins&apos; birthday celebration, the first part of which was
later this day.

We have an early birthday surprise for you, Little Danny, Daniel
informed with a pleased smile.

Daddy, how come Little Danny gets a birthday present early? Jonny
griped, while his brother smiled in surprise and Aislinn cheered.

The father and triplets were congregated in the living room, while the
rest of the children were upstairs, getting ready for their trip
through the Stargate later in the afternoon.

Before Daniel could answer, Jack came down the stairs with Ricky and
Jenny and answered for him, saying, You&apos;ll see why Little Danny is
getting his present early when it arrives.

It&apos;s arriving? Little Danny asked, looking completely bewildered.

Jack grinned and said, Yep, as he looked at his watch. In
fact, it should be arriving just about now. When nothing
happened, he scowled. It always works in the movies.

Daniel sniggered, and Jack fixed him with a glare. Fortunately,
at that moment, the expected flash of light came and deposited a little
gray alien and a funny-haired young woman in the middle of the room.

LYA! THOR! Little Danny shouted as he leaped up and
embraced the two aliens.

Uh, Little Danny, I think they might need to breathe, Son, Jack said
gently.

Little Danny stepped back and grinned at everyone, saying, This is
best present, Dad, Daddy.

Daniel smiled at the happy little boy and explained, We know you
wanted to show your off-world friends where you live. We can&apos;t
take the chance of bringing them all here, but we thought if Thor
brought Lya, then you could at least show her around.

Little Danny hugged both his parents, took Lya and Thor by the hand,
and began dragging them all over the house. They were followed by
Jonny, Ash, Ricky, and Jenny.

We did good, Danny, Jack said happily.

Very good, Jack, Daniel agreed. He&apos;s really going to love
Lya&apos;s present.

====

Two hours later, the Jackson-O&apos;Neills stepped through the Stargate to
the Nox home world. They were met by Lya, the rest of the Nox and
other friends the children had made from the worlds they&apos;d
visited. After Little Danny had greeted everyone, Lya came over
and bent down so that she was eye level with the little boy. She
held out her hand for little Danny to take and then smiled at him.

I have a present for you, Little Danny, Lya spoke.

The Nox woman closed her eyes and concentrated. Before the
stunned eyes of the brood, a building appeared. There was excited
chatter from the other people present, and Little Danny gasped in shock.

Our house? You brought our house here? Little Danny asked.

Lya smiled, explaining, I&apos;m afraid it is not real; it is merely an
illusion.

Little Danny looked a little disappointed, and then did his best to
pretend he wasn&apos;t.

Lya squeezed his shoulder as she spoke, It is not real, Little Danny,
but it is still real enough for you to show your friends everything you
showed me earlier.

Little Danny beamed at her, happiness radiating from him.

**He&apos;s a happy little Camper, Danny.**

**It&apos;s all he wanted. He really doesn&apos;t care about material
things Jack.**

The two smiled at each other, proud of their children and grateful for
their friends.

====

After Little Danny had shown his friends around their house, the Nox
hosted a birthday party on their planet for the Munchkins and all
present. Everyone was having a delightful time as the event
progressed. At the end, Lya and Nafrayu, with Jack and Daniel&apos;s
permission, took the Munchkins aside, leading them quite a ways from
the others.

Watch, Lya told them as she waved her hand out in front of her,
revealing the Nox city in the sky. It is our home; someday,
maybe we&apos;ll take you there.

Oh, boy, look! Jonny exclaimed.

It&apos;s beautiful, Lya, Aislinn said with big eyes.

Thank you, Lya, Little Danny said. This great present.

Remember, our home is a secret. Only very special friends know
about it, Lya advised them.

We no tell brothers and sisters? Aislinn asked a bit worriedly.

Lya smiled warmly, saying, Jennifer knows of our home. You may
tell the others, but, remember, they, too, must keep it a secret.

====

The next day was the big day -- Saturday, the twenty-fourth day of
September -- and the Munchkins were celebrating their fifth birthday.

Five years, Daniel sighed. Jack, they&apos;re five years old, he
spoke as if it were a tragedy.

Angel, they&apos;re still little, Jack assured.

Not for long. Five. Jack, they&apos;re five, Daniel whined.

Jack took his lover into his arms and teased, Wait until they&apos;re
fifteen.

Jaaaack!

Chuckling slightly, Jack held his husband. They had a big day
ahead of them, and when it was over, he knew they&apos;d need a vacation.

====

Wow, Dad, Daddy. Jonny looked at them in amazement, saying,
This is the best cake ever.

Na-uh, Aislinn said as she disagreed, looking at her own cake in
awe. Mine best, too.

Jonny&apos;s cake was shaped like an F-16, complete with a miniature pilot
that looked just like him. Since Aislinn&apos;s latest career ambition
was to be an intergalactic ambassador, her cake was in the shape of a
little gray alien that looked remarkably familiar. To those
unaware of the SGC, it looked like the typical Roswell depiction of an
alien. To everyone else, the little gray cake was definitely a
representation of the Asgard.

He really doesn&apos;t care, does he? Jack asked quietly.

Jack watched in amazement as Little Danny gazed back and forth between
the two birthday cakes. They had each worried that Little Danny
would feel the lack of presents and a cake at this party, but the young
boy didn&apos;t seem to mind a bit.

No, Daniel answered as he watched his namesake draw Jonny and Aislinn
into a three-way hug.

They&apos;re both the bestest cakes ever, Little Danny told them.

Danny, why you no have cake? one of the Munchkin&apos;s friends asked
curiously.

Little Danny grinned, answering, This is Jonny&apos;s and Ash&apos;s
party. I visited friends instead of having a party.

~Clever Sproglet,~ Jack thought as he admired the way his son twisted
the truth.

**Don&apos;t admire his ingenuity too much, Babe. Who do you think
he&apos;s going to use it on the most?** Daniel warned.

**Crap.**
 
Daniel grinned at his lover and decided they had time for a game of Pin
the Earth on the Universe. It was the variation of Pin the Tail
on the Donkey that they&apos;d come up with when Little Danny protested
that, Pinning tails on donkeys would be cruel. They had a map
of the planets in the solar system, and the children had to try and pin
earth in the right spot.

Jack snickered as Daniel arranged the children in a line, remembering
how Little Danny had responded to Jack&apos;s, It&apos;s just a game, Son,
with, I&apos;ll tell the SPCA.

**You&apos;re right, Danny, but I can&apos;t help but admire his genius and his
caring nature.**

====

A few days after the party, Jack and Daniel were making plans for their
October birthdays -- Chenoa, who would be six on October sixth, and
Brianna, who would be eleven on October tenth. Brianna would also
be gone for several days on her dolphin trip. They considered
making that her birthday, but decided against it, so now they had two
more parties to plan and lots of presents to buy.

Jack, did you talk to Sara? Daniel asked.

About the ponies? Jack responded.

Yeah, seeing if Mark&apos;s boss would let us do a party up there. Noa loves those ponies, Daniel commented.

I didn&apos;t get a chance to ask her, but I will tomorrow when I drop the
Spitfires off, Jack advised.

Don&apos;t forget, Daniel warned.

Where&apos;s your faith in me? Jack challenged. Seeing Daniel&apos;s
glare, Jack added, Right. I&apos;ll write it down.

Good idea, Babe! the younger man exclaimed with a grin. ~And
I&apos;ll ask the Spitfires to remind you when you forget to check your
list,~ he silently mused.

====

Well, that was ... different, Daniel commented as the lovers exited
the Ellie Caulkins Opera House in Denver.

Didn&apos;t you like it? Jack inquired as they casually made their way to
the Silver Fox.

No, I mean, yes, it was fine, but we&apos;ve never gone to an opera before
where they spoke so much, Daniel commented.

It&apos;s called German Singspiel, Jack stated informatively. The
arias express the emotion, but don&apos;t further the story.

I noticed, Daniel chuckled.

The two were talking about Mozart&apos;s The Abduction from the Seraglio,
which they had just seen performed.

Hey, it had a happy ending! Jack remarked as he paused for a moment
to avoid hitting a group of walkers going the other direction.

Yes, Belmonte and Constanze are together, but ... Daniel began.

Mister Negative, Jack whined.

I&apos;m not being negative, Daniel argued.

There was a &apos;but&apos; at the end of your sentence, Babe, Jack accused.

All I&apos;m saying is that Osmin is still out there somewhere, Daniel
spoke about the villain of the piece who had simply departed in a
rush. He could follow them back to Spain or ...

Daniel, let them have a happy ending, Jack requested.

Bobbing his head slightly as he reached for his keys, the younger man
agreed, Okay. Unlocking the car, he asked, How are we on time?

Jack checked his watch, answering, Right on schedule, Love. Tante Louise is about fifteen minutes from here.

And then ... Daniel smirked, looking over the top of his car at his
husband.

And then! Jack agreed, with shining eyes.

As their Friday date continued, Jack and Daniel looked forward to a
romantic dinner at one of their favorite, more intimate Denver
restaurants, after which they&apos;d join together in their nation of two at
a hotel they liked a lot.

====

Upon returning home, Jack and Daniel apologized to Mrs. Valissi, their
babysitter of the night, for being so late since it was almost
two-thirty in the morning when they walked in. She smiled, waving
off their unnecessary apologies, and the three chatted for a few
minutes before Daniel escorted the senior citizen safely to her home.

When Daniel returned, he and Jack locked up the house and checked in on
their brood, including Bean Sprout, before turning in.

Hey, Girls, Daniel greeted, smiling as Bijou and Katie both settled
in at the foot of their bed.

Looks like we&apos;re the winners of the night, Jack teased.

The two never knew where the beagles would choose to sleep at
night. Oftentimes, Katie would go back and forth between Daniel
and Little Danny, but there was really no set pattern except that if
any particular member of the family was sick or upset, both beagles
tended to stay with them.

We&apos;re winners every night, Jack. Bij and Katie are our first two
miracles, Daniel spoke softly, leaning down to pet the dogs.

Yeah, the little beasts, Jack chuckled, tickling Bijou and then
Katie, causing both dogs to roll over and let out little snorts.

After a few minutes of playing with the dogs, the men settled into
their normal sleeping position, Daniel atop Jack so he could listen to
his lover&apos;s steady and comforting heartbeat with one leg hooked inside
of Jack&apos;s. Jack&apos;s arms were gently wrapped around Daniel, warming
the younger man&apos;s back. They both loved this closeness the
nighttime brought.

I&apos;m sleeping in, Babe, Daniel said, yawning. Don&apos;t wake me,
he warned.

Like I could, Jack teased before kissing the top of his soulmate&apos;s
head as they prepared for a good night&apos;s sleep. Love you, Angel.

Mmmm ... love you, too, Daniel stated softly.

September had been a fun-filled month, one full of some unexpected
surprises that might even be called miracles, but October was on the
horizon, and it, too, promised to be a month of unexpected miracles.
