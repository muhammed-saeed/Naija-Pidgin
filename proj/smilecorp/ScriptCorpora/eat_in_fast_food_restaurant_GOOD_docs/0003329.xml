 Home cooking is adored by many. Almost everyone has their favorite home cooked recipe. And while more and more Americans eat out every year, there truly is no substitute for home cooked meals.

Home cooked meals are appreciated to almost everyone for many reasons. For starters, no one cares more about your food than your own loved ones. For instance, your mother will only serve you the very best food available. A fast food restaurant or casual dining restaurant will usually serve you something cheap or processed. Most restaurants cant compare to the TLC in every home cooked meal.

Additionally, with home cooked meals, you can easily prepare meals that fit your specific preferences. Dont like salt, not a problem, any other spice you like can be added to accomodate your taste buds. If you are trying to eat healthy, you can choose the specific types of food and the amounts of each food in your dish. Some of todays meals served at restaurants include so many preservatives food colorings, etc, you would probably run out of the restaurant if you saw the list of ingredients in a single meal.

For those that love homemade cooking, here are two of my favorite comfort foods; Grilled Cheese and Savory Meatloaf.

Homemade Grill Cheese
4 Slices of thick cut white bread
4 slices of American Cheese (I prefer Kraft yellow singles)
stick of butter
Salt to taste

In a non-stick frying pan, melt the butter gently and heat the frying pan on a low to medium flame. Place two slices of bread onto the butter and gently toast a bit. Now lay two slices of cheese on one piece of bread and cover with the other piece. Flip the grilled cheese sandwich several times until its nice and golden brown. Serve warm. This recipe yields two sandwiches.

Savory Meatloaf
Meatloaf is one of my favorite dishes. Not only is it a hearty dish that easily satisfies an entire family, but it also tastes good. There are many ways to prepare the right home cooked meatloaf, such as adding diced onions, chili, etc. Below is an easy, yet delicious recipe for Savory Meatloaf which is sure to please your loved ones and is easy to prepare.

Ingredients:
2 pounds of ground hamburger beef
cup of Italian bread crumbs
1 egg beaten
1 can of French onion soup
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a large bowl, blend the beef with the bread crumbs, egg and can of soup. Mold into a loaf. Bake in an oven for about 60 minutes at 350 degrees F. Once done baking you can top with ketchup, chili or even barbecue sauce. One idea is to prepare a Meatloaf Mashed Potato Pie. Prepare mashed potatoes, bake the meatloaf thoroughly and then layer the mashed potatoes over the loaf and continue baking for about 10 to 15 minutes baking the mashed potatoes.
